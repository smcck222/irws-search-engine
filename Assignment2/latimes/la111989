<P>
In Superman (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.), that romantic and thoroughly 
entertaining 1978 fantasy, we're introduced to the comic-book hero who comes 
from the planet Krypton -- Marlon Brando, no less, is his father -- to save 
Metropolis. Christopher Reeve is as perfect as shy, awkward, myopic Clark Kent 
as he is as Superman, embodiment of the invincible hero. 
</P>
<P>
Perry Mason: The Case of the All-Star Assassin (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a new 
TV movie in which an injured hockey star (Jason Beghe) is accused of murdering 
a sports mogul (Pernell Roberts). Raymond Burr stars as Mason. 
</P>
<P>
Outrageous Fortune (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is an often hilarious female-bonding 
movie that allows Shelley Long's upper-class aspiring actress and Bette 
Midler's earthy waitress-cum-actress to be sensational together and as 
individual presences. Under Arthur Hiller's direction, this 1987 
comedy-adventure has a smart, raucous drive. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 6 p.m.) is a 
disappointing Tom Hanks comedy that finds him cast as the most arrogant rich 
boy in Yale's class of '62, who wings off to the jungles of Thailand with the 
Peace Corps. Instead of satirizing the incipient activism of the New Frontier, 
it's essentially just another mean-spirited yuppie comedy. John Candy co-stars. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Brickman's Risky Business (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) is a genuinely 
funny comedy-fantasy about a young man (Tom Cruise) who, under the sway of 
seductive young hooker Rebecca De Mornay, turns his handsome suburban Chicago 
home into a brothel while his parents are away. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Sellecca and Wendy Kilbourne star in the new TV movie Turn Back the 
Clock (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.) in which a woman who kills her husband at midnight 
on New Year's Eve gets a chance to prevent this from happening. 
</P>
<P>
In the swift-moving 1986 series pilot Popeye Doyle (Channel 11 Tuesday at 8 
p.m.), Ed O'Neill of "Married . . . With Children" has the title role as the 
rough-and-tumble New York City detective first played by Gene Hackman in "The 
French Connection." 
</P>
<P>
In A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.), 
the morbid tone of the original has given way to horror comedy set off by quite 
spectacular and imaginative fantasy sequences. This installment is no less 
grisly than its predecessors, but at least it invites you to laugh at it. 
Robert Englund is back as the hideously disfigured child murderer Freddy 
Krueger. 
</P>
<P>
Once Bitten (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a modest, enjoyable 1985 comedy 
in which Lauren Hutton, undoubtedly the world's most beautiful vampire, is 
finding it harder and harder to locate male virgins whose blood is essential to 
preserving her eternal youth. 
</P>
<P>
Slick and scarcely subtle but undeniably potent, Steven Spielberg's Jaws 
(Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) builds single-mindedly to its big, scary 
climax involving that awesome shark. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard 
Dreyfuss star. 
</P>
<P>
Animal House (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) was the first in a long line of 
movies about the outrageous pranks of college kids obsessed with booze, bad 
language and nubile women. John Belushi stars as the worst slob on the campus, 
circa 1962. For all its exaggerations the film's roots are firmly established 
in the reality of the Greek system at the time. 
</P>
<P>
In the delightful Superman II (CBS Thursday at 8:30 p.m.) our hero (Christopher 
Reeve) must at last confront his invincibility, choosing between the woman he 
loves, Lois Lane (Margot Kidder), and the world he has vowed to protect. 
</P>
<P>
The Man in the Santa Claus Suit (Channel 2 Saturday at 8 p.m.), a 1978 TV 
movie, stars Fred Astaire (playing seven different characters) in a frothy 
Yuletide fantasy about how the proprietor of a costume shop changes the lives 
of many people. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Arthur Hiller, Silver Streak (Channel 5 Saturday at 8 p.m.) is 
pleasant and amusing, even if takes a tad too long to arrive at its literally 
smashing finish. Gene Wilder and Jill Clayburgh become entangled in adventure 
and romance aboard a train bound from L.A. to Chicago. Richard Pryor, as an 
amiable crook, steals the picture. 
</P>
<P>
The Freshman (Channel 28 Saturday at 10 p.m.), a 1925 Harold Lloyd classic, 
finds Lloyd in the title role as a wet-behind-the-ears frosh desperate to be 
liked.

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: BAKERSFIELD BLUES AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
FOR KNOCKING ITS RURAL NEIGHBOR, L.A. IS STILL A TOWN WITHOUT PITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
WHEN KFAC dropped classical music in favor of rock a while ago, The Times 
deplored this atavistic corporate decision editorially, noting that it left Los 
Angeles the largest city in the nation without a commercial classical music 
station. 
</P>
<P>
"Even Bakersfield has one," The Times observed. 
</P>
<P>
The Bakersfield Californian, on which I began my journalistic career, answered 
with an editorial of its own (a copy of which was sent to me by Mary De Armond 
of that city), noting that the reference to Bakersfield's KIWI-FM was "somewhat 
derisive." 
</P>
<P>
As a product of Bakersfield, I, too, felt that the phrase "even Bakersfield" 
was loaded with the stereotypical notion that Bakersfield is a cultural desert 
peopled by oil well workers who hang out in beer bars. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Los Angeles itself has so long been denigrated as a wasteland by New 
Yorkers that we needed some smaller town to serve as our cultural inferior, and 
Bakersfield has always been there to oblige. 
</P>
<P>
I happen to know that Bakersfield harbors many intellectuals and creative 
people, one of whom, Jim Day, was my first editor when I joined the Californian 
staff as a sports reporter. He is a psychology graduate of the University of 
Washington. He knew nothing about football, basketball or baseball, but he knew 
the English language. His first gift to me, even before I got my first 
paycheck, was Webster's Collegiate Dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
In listing Bakersfield's assets (such as affordable housing, Basque restaurants 
and the absence of youth-gang slayings) the Californian overlooked Russell 
Travis, a California State University, Bakersfield, sociology professor who had 
been the subject of a recent Californian profile. 
</P>
<P>
Travis himself has corrected the oversight by sending me a copy of the article, 
which described him as a creative humorist with a multiplicity of marketable, 
if absurd, ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Enclosed was a sample of his most profitable product -- a T-shirt. This one was 
black with the Batman logo in yellow and the word Batma'am across the chest. It 
was obviously a gift for my wife. 
</P>
<P>
Travis reminded me that I have on my desk at the office a Writer's Block -- a 
small, square block of oak and walnut that either does or does not have a 
therapeutic effect on a writer's most frustrating demon. The Writer's Block 
(Travis said he saw one in a picture of me sitting at my desk) was one of his 
earlier inventions. 
</P>
<P>
His muse at present seems to be devoted mostly to the T-shirt. Besides 
Batma'am, he has recently created T-shirts bearing such provincial legends as 
Hard Wok Cafe, Bakersfield; Why Waikiki When There's Bakersfield? and 
Bakersfield, California, It's a Gas. 
</P>
<P>
One that seems to put Bakersfield in its place among the world's most 
prestigious cities spells them out in letters of increasing size: Paris . . . 
Cairo . . . Sydney . . . Bakersfield. My wife has one that says Paris, London, 
Rome, Bakersfield. She wears it to the gym as a symbol of loyalty to her home 
town. 
</P>
<P>
Travis explains his perverse muse: "My penchant for wordplay finds its creative 
release in the design of T-shirts, including such subjects as the Santa Monica 
Pier, the UCLA Bruins, Alcatraz and many other themes that fall into the 
categories of humor: students, tourists, beach life and kid stuff." 
</P>
<P>
A favorite among students coming to class, he says, is one that reads This Is 
Only a Test, This Is Only a Test. An R-rated T-shirt has an aspirin and the 
legend: Not Tonight, Honey. One with an environmental theme has the words: One 
Oil Spill Can Ruin Your Whole Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Travis has so many ideas he doesn't expect to do them all himself. "I don't 
race around trying to follow up on all these ideas. There's just too many," the 
Californian quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
One of his ideas is Fortune 500 cookies, which, like the Chinese variety, would 
be wrapped around pithy sayings from the corporate world: "They would be great 
for business people -- 500 different sayings. As soon as you put this in your 
newspaper, somebody is going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
I've got a pithy corporate saying for him: What's good for General Motors is 
good for the country. And Calvin Coolidge's shrewd remark: The business of 
America is business. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't forget that Bakersfield is the Nashville of the West.

History tell us that the pen is mightier than the sword. Martin Bernheimer has 
a pen that he brandishes like a rapier and sometimes like a meat cleaver. The 
headline writers followed Bernheimer's lead and selected an equally derogatory 
title for the article, "The Tyrant of the Philharmonic." 
</P>
<P>
Would you be kind enough to grant Fleischmann eight pages to respond to 
Bernheimer? If not, then it is time for the Los Angeles Times to hire a 
critics' critic to review this famous self-proclaimed operatic authority.

A THIN TIME FOR 'FAT MAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If director Roland Joffe wants to know why "Fat Man and Little Boy" isn't 
drawing audiences, he need only look as far as his trailer (Outtakes, Nov. 12). 
Instead of a sober profile of the men behind the Atomic Age, the movie is 
presented in the trailer as a pious, bombastic, partisan star vehicle for Paul 
Newman's favorite pinup boy, Paul Newman. 
</P>
<P>
Newman is miscast, like having Tom Cruise as Westmoreland, or Dan Quayle as 
President. 
</P>
<P>
WILLIAM J. BECKER JR. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
Roland Joffe brought us "Fat Man" -- wasn't such a fun day, 
</P>
<P>
Now he wonders where he went wrong (Outtakes, just last Sunday). 
</P>
<P>
Says he thinks its message may have been rejected 
</P>
<P>
"At some gut level" by the public -- 
</P>
<P>
Now he's all dejected. 
</P>
<P>
Methinks there's just a whiff here of Hollywood self-delusion, 
</P>
<P>
My only gut reaction was yawns and deep confusion. 
</P>
<P>
The action dragged, the dialogue sagged, 
</P>
<P>
Clear plot was an illusion. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Newman hammed it as General Groves 
</P>
<P>
(No wonder we all stayed away in droves). 
</P>
<P>
So, Roland, if you're contemplating "Fat Man Number 2," 
</P>
<P>
Do us all a favor -- don't drop the other shoe!

Re Richard Cromelin's Nov. 5 Introducing column: In discussing the band Gavin 
Friday and the Man Seezer, Cromelin implied that the Virgin Prunes group was no 
longer in existence. Mary D'Nellan, a member of the Virgin Prunes, wrote to us 
on Oct. 3: "We've been recording in Dublin all summer -- our new record is 
coming out in Europe next week. . . . It's called "Nada" and we're all very 
proud of it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
For a band about which so little information is available, a bit of 
misinformation in a newspaper as widely read as The Times can be very harmful.

The Nov. 5 cover story presents a distorted impression of the Women's Culinary 
Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Support organizations such as the alliance, founded by chef Elka Gilmore and 
several other high-profile chefs, provide opportunities for members to learn 
from each other's trials and successes. It is unfortunate that in many such 
groups those who have become the most successful no longer take the time to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, the Women's Culinary Alliance counts among its members many 
hard-working chefs -- some high-profile and some working for their stars and 
toques -- as well as a wide variety of food industry professionals.

AN END TO CHARITY

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In their Nov. 5 letters, Elizabeth Gaines and John Termini expressed disgust at 
the treatment of animals in the filming of "The Bear." I agree completely with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
I was glad to learn from an editorial note at the end of their letters that the 
Fund for Animals and the Wildlife Fund had endorsed this film; I am now closing 
the trust funds I have established for each of these supposedly humane groups. 
I regret that for 30 years I have contributed generously to both. 
</P>
<P>
I have been in the motion-picture industry for 40 years and have witnessed the 
way humane officers are dealt with on sets. The film makers simply tell him or 
her to "take a walk" when they plan a cruel shot, so the humane officer does 
not see it.

Regarding the Nov. 5 articles that appeared under the headline "Women Chefs: 
Checking In on the Revolution": It was great to see such extensive pieces on 
women chefs. However, I was angered by Elka Gilmore's assertion that the 
Women's Culinary Alliance had "disintegrated into a catering coffee klatch." 
</P>
<P>
As a documentary film maker currently working with the WCA, I can tell you that 
the alliance is an active, committed group of professionals working in all 
aspects of food service. The organization not only provides support to its 
members but is active in community affairs. 
</P>
<P>
WCA members were involved in the American Wine and Food Festival benefiting 
Meals-on-Wheels. The group sponsors Dining for Dollars, which last year raised 
more than $30,000 for AIDS Project Los Angeles, and it is working with Avery 
Restaurant Supply to renovate the Union Rescue Mission's kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
These are hardly the pursuits of a "catering coffee klatch."

Many young artists could learn a great lesson from Jon Serl ("Inside the Mind 
of an Artistic Outsider," by Kristine McKenna, Nov. 12). While schlockmeisters 
such as Jeff Koons and Mark Kostabi are turning the art world into a joke with 
their crass commercialism, Jon Serl has been quietly making important art 
solely for the purpose of spiritual release.

Greed and irony may be hip nowadays, but how many of these younger artists will 
still be thriving when they're 96?

ART POTTERY

By SAM BURCHELL

<TEXT>
<P>
DURING THE LATE 19th Century, there was a strong reaction in the United States 
against the mass production of the Industrial Revolution. The Arts and Crafts 
Movement, which had made such an impact in Europe, had an equally powerful 
effect on the decorative arts in America. Many small, independent potteries 
sprang up in different parts of the country, employing artists and designers 
who turned out unique, handmade ceramics. 
</P>
<P>
Surely the most significant date in American art pottery history was 1880, when 
the famous Rookwood Pottery was established in Cincinnati, Ohio. Its products 
defined the essence of art pottery: ceramic work made of earthenware, stoneware 
or porcelain, created primarily for aesthetic and decorative purposes. Art 
pottery is a term indicating that special area of American ceramics made during 
a specific period and placing great emphasis on individual craftsmanship. The 
era of pottery lasted from about 1870 to 1920, and well into the 1930s in 
California. It has by no means vanished today. 
</P>
<P>
Characteristic art pottery pieces, and the ones likely to be found by the 
collector today, follow the general form and decoration of Rookwood Pottery. 
Every kind of ceramic was made in every shape and size, from tiles to dinner 
plates, but the typical piece was a vase, decorated with leaves and flowers in 
the art nouveau manner. 
</P>
<P>
During the years of its popularity, there were more than 100 potteries, many of 
them very small indeed. Some were located near the rich clay deposits of Ohio, 
and others appeared in many different states, from Colorado to Arkansas. In 
California, 15 groups of artists produced fine work in potteries ranging from 
California Faience in Berkeley to Rhead Pottery in Santa Barbara, from 
Robertson Pottery in Los Angeles to Valentien Pottery in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, much of the early art pottery has survived. Though the rarest work 
from the smallest potteries commands prices that can reach into the tens of 
thousands of dollars, a good deal of art pottery can be found today for far 
more modest prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for art pottery at Buddy's, Couturier Gallery and Atmosphere Gallery in 
Los Angeles; Main Street USA in Venice; El Adobe (by appointment), and Jack 
Moore Arts and Crafts in Pasadena; Roberta Gauthey Antiques in Laguna Beach; 
Snooty Fox and Old California Store in Ventura, and Wild Goose Chase in Santa 
Ana.

CITIES OFFERING BARGAIN PRICES TO AUTO DEALERS; 
</P>
<P>
TAXES: CAR DEALERSHIPS GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL SALES TAX REVENUES. AND SOME SAN 
GABRIEL VALLEY CITIES ARE CUTTING DEALS TO FILL THEIR NEW AUTO MALLS. 
</P>

<P>
Like a star high school quarterback among throngs of hungry college recruiters, 
the auto dealer has become the darling of many revenue-hungry San Gabriel 
Valley city officials in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
And in recent months, the mall skirmishes have become mall wars, as some 
officials offer increasingly sweet deals to lure dealers -- and their precious 
sales taxes -- to their respective cities, and others scramble to keep their 
established dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
"(Auto dealers) generate more sales tax per square foot of land than any other 
business a city can attract," explains Rob Steel, redevelopment director in 
Azusa. "That's why cities are fighting each other for them." 
</P>
<P>
But the zeal to retain and attract dealerships has sparked debate about the use 
of public funds to boost private enterprise, as well as exacting an emotional 
and financial cost to businessmen and homeowners who lie in the path of 
redevelopment and eminent domain. And some critics suggest that dealers are 
playing on cities' fears in order to win better deals. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, city officials forge on. Three new auto dealers will begin 
construction at the Glendora Auto Center along the Foothill Freeway this month, 
breaking ground on a 32-acre complex that will become the newest car-shopper's 
paradise in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Eight dealerships will buy the land from the redevelopment agency for 
essentially 50% of its value. In return, the city gets at least $1 million a 
year in expected new tax revenue once the mall is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The city manager called the project one of the council's most important and 
positive moves in the city's history. But critics have blasted it as a 
"sweetheart deal" that is setting back the city $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona is offering land valued at $6 per square foot for between $1.50 and 
$2.50 per square foot at a 57-acre auto center to be built north of the Pomona 
Freeway. Monrovia and Duarte had been selling land for their adjoining 
18-dealer, 47-acre 210 Freeway Autoplex, scheduled for completion next year, 
from as low as $7 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
In Pasadena, where six dealers have left the city in the last two years, the 
average cost of commercial land is $30 a square foot. Desperate to keep its 
remaining 16 dealerships from deserting, Pasadena is considering offering 
dealers rebates of up to 50% of the sales tax that would be due to the city 
should the dealers decide to build or expand. 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra -- whose 20 auto dealers are projected to generate $2.1 million in 
sales tax in the 1989-90 fiscal year -- has helped dealers on leased land 
purchase sites so they don't have to deal with skyrocketing real estate costs. 
And last month, Covina, which has lost two dealerships to a mall in neighboring 
West Covina, condemned a retail center to acquire land for up to two new 
dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
"They won't pay more than $5 per square foot for land valued at $10 to $20 per 
square foot, and cities are happy to offer them that," Covina Planner Hal 
Ledford said. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Eliot, assistant exececutive director of West Covina's redevelopment 
agency, said the dealerships are attractive because they are "large ticket 
items." 
</P>
<P>
"Cities are generally looking for revenue, and sales tax is one item we have 
the greatest amount of control over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say that since the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, cities 
have been forced to turn to sales taxes rather than property taxes as a steady 
source of general fund revenue. The landmark measure slashed property taxes to 
1% of a parcel's value and restricted increases in assessments to 2% annually. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the success of the Cerritos Auto Center -- which opened in 1980 and 
was one of the first in the Los Angeles area -- the malls have tempted city 
officials, said Mike Martin, redevelopment director of Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
"It also showed the impact on surrounding cities like Downey and South Gate," 
which had to fight to retain their dealers, he said. "That's a real sobering 
thought. The cities that have been able to respond will come out on top." 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra City Manager Kevin Murphy said several dealers in the city "came to us 
in '84, '85 planning to move out of town unless we helped them." The city 
decided then to develop an 18-dealership mall along Main Street. The project 
should be 90% complete within two years, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Although most officials maintain that competition for dealers is friendly, they 
admit they hate to see one leave. 
</P>
<P>
"Conflict has arisen when a city successfully gets an auto franchise from an 
adjoining city," Eliot said. "That has caused some bad feeling between some 
cities sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
But certain officials say they think cities are letting dealers take advantage 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora Councilman David Bodley, who voted against the Glendora mall last 
November, charged that dealers are exploiting cities by shopping around for the 
best deals. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very good businessmen, and they are using all of the fears of all of 
the cities about revenue, or the lack of it, to get the best deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"As dealerships become more sophisticated in realizing how great an asset they 
are to cities, they begin playing cities off against each other," said West 
Covina's Eliot. 
</P>
<P>
"One dealer (approached by Glendora) wants us to buy property for them to 
expand," he said. "We're looking into it." 
</P>
<P>
Warren Person, a West Covina Oldsmobile dealer who is asking the city to help 
him acquire 40,000 square feet for expansion, said he has to do what is in the 
best interest for his company. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in a redevelopment district, and obviously they don't want me to move to 
Glendora," he said, adding that he would prefer to remain loyal to West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
Chester Yoshizaki, West Covina's redevelopment manager, said the whole point of 
his agency was to help existing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"We automatically respond any way we can," Yoshizaki said. "Everything we can 
do to keep them here would be to our benefit." 
</P>
<P>
West Covina collected $1.7 million in sales tax from auto dealers in 1988-89. 
Of the city's 12 dealerships, nine are in the 18-acre West Covina Auto Plaza 
along the San Bernardino Freeway completed in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials complain that dealers will sometimes use the threat of 
leaving as a bargaining chip to get concessions from redevelopment agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are car salesmen; they can negotiate," said Martin, referring to 
Alhambra dealers who "will hint to make you understand there is cheaper land 
elsewhere in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Ledford said this encourages cities to "steal businesses from one another. It 
results in cities competing and giving money to businesses, instead of services 
to people." 
</P>
<P>
Eliot warned: "It's estructive for cities to upbid each other. It's going to 
cost them more and more." 
</P>
<P>
Because the creation of almost every mall is organized by a redevelopment 
agency, another complaint arises when the power of eminent domain is sometimes 
exercised in assembling land. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't put a price tag on people," said Sherry Passmore, a slow-growth 
advocate who has served as a consultant to residents fighting condemnation. "It 
adds insult to injury when you find it's for a businessman." 
</P>
<P>
Christina Lizardo, whose 9,000-square-foot lot was taken by eminent domain for 
the mall in Duarte, took the case to court and finally settled with the city in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very stressful trying to find a house when I hadn't planned to sell in 
the first place," she said. "If the school or freeway was expanding and they 
had to take homes, it would have been a lot easier for us to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
No homes were taken for the Glendora center, but a slow-growth group, Glendora 
Pride, objected to the project. "We're opposed to the use of public funds for 
private enterprise," said association president Judy Lawford. 
</P>
<P>
Darlene Avina, a past president of the group, called the arrangement with the 
dealers a "sweetheart deal." She pointed out that the redevelopment agency has 
already helped one of the dealers acquire his existing site. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora Finance Director Larry Shroeder said Fred and Carl Colley, who jointly 
own Ford, Volkswagen and Subaru dealerships in the city, owe the redevelopment 
agency $2.8 million for land the agency purchased for them in 1983. They have 
until 2008 to repay the debt. 
</P>
<P>
The Colleys already have "a low-interest loan from us, and now (they're) coming 
back and getting more. Why is the city helping them get rich?" 
</P>
<P>
Dealers contend that finding a good location is a matter of survival and that 
land prices make help from cities almost essential. 
</P>
<P>
"Dealers that don't get onto freeway locations will find it very difficult to 
survive," said Carl Colley, who was negotiating to move to San Dimas when 
Glendora approved its mall. The Colleys will relocate to the freeway mall next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Motorcar Dealers Assn. president Charles Pachdjian , will be moving 
his Oldsmobile dealership to the Monrovia mall next summer. 
</P>
<P>
"As these malls go in, it's got to hurt dealers in towns like Pasadena that 
don't have one," he said. "Every dealer in this town would move out" if there 
weren't similar franchises already at the malls, he said. He hopes the freeway 
exposure will increase his annual sales from $15 million to $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte, which expects $2 million to $3 million in additional sales taxes from 
the 10 dealerships on its share of the mall, expects to recoup the $7.5 million 
it spent to create the package within 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is to be conservative on sales tax projections. That will help even 
out those peaks and valleys in the industry," said City Manager Jesse Duff. But 
no matter how careful the analysis and planning, he said, "you always have a 
concern about giving away too much." 
</P>
<P>
HOW CITIES LURE AUTO DEALERS 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra Helped existing Main Street dealers upgrade and relocated others to 
that street to create an 18-dealership strip. Also helped dealers purchase land 
so they wouldn't have to continue leasing. 
</P>
<P>
Claremont;Assembled and sold land with no discount for a seven-dealership auto 
park that opened in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Covina;Condemned retail center last month to create space for up to two new 
auto dealerships on Citrus Avenue and intends to help two other dealers upgrade 
and expand. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora;Looking for dealers to fill two remaining slots in its 
eight-dealership mall along Foothill Freeway. The city is asking for about 50% 
of the land value as down payment. The remainder will be forgiven if the dealer 
generates the equivalent in sales tax over the next 10 years. Groundbreaking 
for the first three dealerships began this month. 
</P>
<P>
Monrovia-Duarte;Sold dealers land for $6 to $15 per square foot, depending on 
when dealers signed up for a space at their 18-dealership 210 Freeway Autoplex, 
to be completed in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena;Considering sales tax rebate to dealers who want to build or expand. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona;Asking for $1.50 to $2.50 per square foot for spaces in a 
nine-dealership mall along the Pomona Freeway. Three dealers have already 
agreed to move in. 
</P>
<P>
West Covina;Opened a nine-dealership mall along the San Bernardino Freeway in 
1986 and is considering helping a dealer outside the mall expand.

'PROBLEM' BOYS FIND SOLUTIONS AT ALTADENA HOME 
</P>

ALTADENA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill spent most of his sixth-grade year at Sherman Oaks Elementary School 
engaging in schoolyard fights and playing basketball. Schoolwork was, at best, 
a distant concern. 
</P>
<P>
But for the last 13 months, the 12-year-old North Hollywood boy has been in a 
very different kind of classroom. In the Re-Ed Program at the Sycamores, a home 
and school for emotionally disturbed boys in Altadena, he says he has improved 
a lot. 
</P>
<P>
The Sycamores has a capacity of 60 children, 12 of whom are in the Re-Ed 
Program. Six to 14 years old, most of them come from middle-class homes. Some 
have been abused and neglected. All suffer from psychiatric or psychological 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these kids have had some kind of trauma -- a divorce, a death; 
sometimes it's abuse -- and they've not been able to cope with or recover from 
those traumas," said Donna Parker, supervisor of the program. 
</P>
<P>
"They start to manifest a lot of behavioral and emotional problems, and it 
deteriorates to the point that they can't be managed at home or in school." 
</P>
<P>
The boys usually suffer from one of two problems: They are depressed and 
withdraw from social situations, or they get into fights, destroy property, 
throw tantrums and sometimes even assault their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids have learned a whole mechanism of inappropriate coping skills and 
inappropriate problem-solving skills," Parker said. "Therefore, when we receive 
the child, our goal is to re-educate the child, teach him new problem-solving, 
new coping skills." 
</P>
<P>
As Bill puts it: "They're here to re-educate you to do better in society." 
</P>
<P>
Parker said the Re-Ed Program employs an unusual brand of therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"The ecological approach tries to involve everybody who is involved in the 
kid's little 'ecosystem,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a neighbor who is really involved with the child and wants to help, 
then the clinician will be contacting that neighbor and talking about the child 
and saying: 'Here's what you can do to help.' " 
</P>
<P>
The treatment also emphasizes working with the group as a whole. The 12 Re-Ed 
children at the Sycamores are separated into two group homes of six. Each group 
does everything together: cooking meals, going to school and shopping for 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
They also deal with one another's problems together, whenever they arise. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's Johnny's turn to cook and Johnny is having a problem, well, that's 
going to affect whether or not the whole group gets their food on the table," 
Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to sit down and talk to the kid about whatever his problem is and 
help him resolve it and get on with his morning so that they can eat and get 
out the door to school." 
</P>
<P>
For the program to work, teachers must be involved in all aspects of the 
child's life. They work closely with the Sycamores' psychological and medical 
staff to serve the child's needs. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Sherwin, a Re-Ed teacher-counselor for the last four years, is there at 7 
a.m. to eat breakfast with the boys and stays with them most of the day, both 
in the classroom and outside it. 
</P>
<P>
Sherwin, who formerly taught at a high school in Colorado and at the Brooklyn 
Council of the Arts in New York, said he prefers the Sycamores because he can 
get to know the children better and have greater effect as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"In this situation, I have six students," Sherwin said. "We have breakfast 
together, so I see them in a home setting as well as an academic setting. And I 
get a better picture of who they are and really feel like I'm having an impact 
some of the time on some of these kids." 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the classes are geared to slower learners, some of the 
children are learning at a level consistent with their age group, Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
The boys' emotional and behavioral problems also prevent them from leading 
typical lives at home. The Re-Ed Program emphasizes working with each child's 
family and preparing a home environment that feels comfortable when he 
eventually returns. 
</P>
<P>
Re-educating the parents is as important as re-educating their children, Parker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to be good parents; they want their kids to do well in school," she 
said. "Some parents need some individual help before they can begin to be more 
effective parents, and so the clinician will provide that or hook the parent up 
with that service in the community." 
</P>
<P>
Weekend visitations -- required for most of the residents -- also help prevent 
the family from treating the child as an outsider when he returns home. 
</P>
<P>
Only three of the approximately 70 graduates of Re-Ed have had to return to the 
program. Most of the boys who leave are able to handle a less restrictive 
environment and move in permanently with their families while receiving regular 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
The Re-Ed Program was developed in the early 1960s by Nicholas Hobbs of Peabody 
College in Nashville, Tenn., as an alternative to psychiatric treatment in a 
hospital. The Re-Ed philosophy of treatment reached the Sycamores in 1983 by 
way of UCLA, where faculty in the Graduate School of Education had been 
studying it since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The Sycamores' Re-Ed program remains unique in Los Angeles County. 
Co-educational Re-Ed programs exist in Ventura County and in Berkeley, Parker 
said, but there are no all-girl Re-Ed programs in California. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of funding -- not lack of need -- is what stands in the way of more such 
programs, said Paul McIver, acting program director at the Los Angeles County 
Department of Mental Health. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it's the Re-Ed model or some other model, we need more programs and 
better programs to address the needs of our most disturbed kids," McIver said. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is difficult to measure the success of programs dealing with 
emotionally disturbed children, he said, "the philosophy of the Re-Ed Program 
is pretty sound and common sense. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids who go into the state hospitals often are there for long periods of time, 
maybe a year or two," McIver said. "Kids who are in that big an institution for 
such a long time are cut off from the mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Re-Ed program, with its weekend visitations and involvement by the 
community and family, helps prevent that. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Hewett of UCLA's Graduate School of Education said the Re-Ed Program can 
create positive changes in all but the most severely disturbed children. 
</P>
<P>
"Re-Ed doesn't rely on psychologists," he said. "It doesn't rely on physicians. 
It relies on teachers." 
</P>
<P>
Hewett considers mental hospitals such as Camarillo State Hospital to be 
"outdated and inferior to the ecological approach" that Re-Ed uses. 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, "the stigma of being in a program like Re-Ed is far less than 
(that of) being in a psychiatric hospital."

SUPERVISORS OK PROJECT IN ALTADENA; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: LA VINA COMMUNITY GROUP OPPOSES THE 272-HOME DEVELOPMENT ON 
ARCHEOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Developer Tim Cantwell whooped and clapped his hands Thursday as the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved his La Vina project, a plan to 
build 272 homes on 220 acres in Altadena located mainly in rural Angeles 
National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents, who have fought Cantwell's proposal for 3 1/2 years, only 
muttered. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't over yet, buster," one woman said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, representatives of Friends of La Vina, the group opposed to the 
project, say they intend to file a lawsuit against the Board of Supervisors 
within a month. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Bucksbaum, an attorney for the group, said the board should have 
required archeological and environmental surveys before approving the project, 
instead of allowing the surveys to be undertaken before the start of 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
"California law is so strong on this point that this project is sure to end up 
in court before these surveys are done," Bucksbaum warned the board. 
</P>
<P>
The warning did not persuade the board, which gave unanimous approval, with 
Supervisor Deane Dana absent. Still, the decision was not an easy one, 
particularly for Supervisor Michael Antonovich, in whose 5th District the 
project lies. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a difficult case, one of the most difficult cases we've had for our 
district since I've been supervisor in 1980," Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the difficulty arose over the twists and turns the project has taken 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Cantwell, of Cantwell-Anderson Inc. of Pasadena, purchased the site on 
the northern end of Lincoln Avenue. It contained a former tuberculosis 
sanitarium on land zoned for institutional uses. Most of the remaining land was 
zoned for low-density residential use. 
</P>
<P>
Cantwell formed a partnership with Southwest Diversified Inc., of Irvine, and 
requested a change in the zoning and community plan to allow construction of 
360 housing units, including townhouses. But, faced with opposition to the 
proposal's scale, Cantwell redesigned it, eliminating the multifamily housing 
and reducing the number of units to 272. He also set aside 108 acres for open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Cantwell worked with some area residents to propose a job training 
and employment program in cooperation with the Pasadena-Foothill Branch of the 
Los Angeles Urban League and the Pasadena Skills Center. Improvements at Loma 
Alta Park were also proposed. 
</P>
<P>
Cantwell also busied himself courting the community with barbecues on the 
property and chartered bus rides for supporters to hearings before the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition countered with Indian artifacts -- an ancient Gabrieleno Indian 
grinding stone found in July on adjacent property that opponents said justified 
a thorough archeological survey. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's board meeting, they also countered with a letter from the 
National Forestry Service indicating interest in the La Vina site as a home for 
a forestry service administration building. The letter allows Rep. Edward 
Roybal (D-Los Angeles) -- who earlier this year said the land should be used 
for a public purpose -- to pursue government funds to buy the land for the 
forestry service, Bucksbaum told the board. 
</P>
<P>
Bucksbaum also raised concerns regarding density, traffic and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich responded by saying that county planning staff reports indicated the 
density of 2.6 houses per acre was lower than nearby developed areas. The 
reports also said the project would cause the surrounding street system to 
operate at only 70% capacity and that archeological and biological surveys 
undertaken before construction would ensure that no artifacts or endangered 
species were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Antonovich said the developer had pledged to provide $50,000 to 
help relocate the Hawkins House, a 100-year-old home in Altadena sought for use 
as a town hall. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposal does have support from a variety of groups," he added, referring 
to proponents of the job training programs. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the Ribet Academy, a private school in La Canada Flintridge 
proposed for relocation on 11 acres in the center of the project, was left 
undecided, however. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission, in its report to the board, recommended that the 
acreage be used for open space instead. But the board decided to hear the 
matter in detail when the developer returns for a conditional-use permit, the 
next step required before construction can begin.

BANNER HOLIDAY; 
</P>
<P>
ARTISTS ADD A TOUCH OF THE SEA TO THEIR YULETIDE DESIGNS FOR SANTA MONICA 
</P>

<P>
Westside artists Laddie John Dill and John Van Hamersveld have designed 
original holiday banners for Santa Monica that will feature gulls, dolphins and 
kelp instead of the standard holly and mistletoe. 
</P>
<P>
"Both John and I felt that a leading arts community such as Santa Monica should 
have original, distinctive artwork for the holidays," said Dill, an 
internationally known artist who lives in Santa Monica. Dill said he and Van 
Hamersveld chose a marine theme, instead of "the generic candle and Christmas 
wrapping thing," because they wanted the banners to relate to the seaside 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioned by the Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce, the holiday decorations 
consist of 225 3-by-7-foot vinyl canvas banners that will be hung from light 
posts throughout the city. Each side will bear one of three designs: a gull, a 
school of dolphins and fish and a flowing arrangement of seaweed. 
</P>
<P>
Each image is distinctively marine, Dill noted, but suggests the holidays. "The 
seaweed almost reads like mistletoe." 
</P>
<P>
Dill, whose studio is in Venice, and Van Hamersveld, who lives and works in 
Malibu, collaborated on the designs using fax machines in their studio offices. 
Dill made initial drawings, Van Hamersveld said, "then I drew over them and 
cropped the designs." 
</P>
<P>
The images appear on the banners silk-screened in white. The banners also 
feature colored backgrounds hand-painted by Dill. Dill said he used durable 
vinyl acrylic paints for the abstract backgrounds. To paint the hundreds of 
banners, Dill spread them on the floor of his hangar-like studio. "It looked 
like an Iranian rug dealership," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Teri Klass of Dill's staff coordinated production of the decorations. 
</P>
<P>
Dill said he and his collaborators, who donated their services, originally 
proposed that the word heal -- a reference to their concern for the health of 
Santa Monica Bay -- appear on the banners. The chamber felt the reference was 
too negative, Dill said, and the artists opted instead for the words peace, 
friendship and joy. 
</P>
<P>
Though much less abstract than most of Dill's work, the banners are still 
decidedly contemporary. "The banners have a little more of an abstract edge to 
them than you might find in Des Moines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The decorations will go up the day after Thanksgiving and remain until Jan. 7. 
They can be reused each year. 
</P>
<P>
Van Hamersveld said the finished banners are "beautiful, like a Christmas 
card." A Chamber of Commerce official, who asked not to be identified, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past we've had very traditional Christmas decorations. That's a polite 
way of saying they were lousy."

GLENDORA IS PREPARING MORATORIUM ON HILLSIDE BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The city that touts itself as the Pride of the Foothills is preparing a 
building moratorium on hillside development and studying proposals to increase 
sales and property taxes to fund acquisitions of land for conservation. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted 4 to 1 at a special meeting Wednesday to draft a 
six-month building freeze after hearing a presentation by the Hillside 
Conservancy Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's report, which also calls for a citywide tree preservation 
ordinance, characterizes the foothills as "a priceless contribution to the 
visible natural profile that distinguishes Glendora from other Southern 
California cities." 
</P>
<P>
Stressing the urgency of quick action, the committee is seeking $3,000 in seed 
money from the city to create a private, nonprofit land conservancy that would 
acquire hillside parcels and protect the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, appointed by Mayor Leonard Martyns in June, prefaced its 
recommendations Wednesday with slides of spotted owls, red-tailed hawks and 
deer grazing beneath avocado trees in the undeveloped foothills. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy committee proposes to raise between $11.5 million and $14 
million through a combination of increased park and recreation fees over five 
years, a three-year, quarter-cent sales tax increase, and a three-year property 
tax override of 20 cents per $100 assessed valuation. On a home valued at 
$200,000, the additional tax would be $400. The 1988-89 assessed property value 
of the entire city is about $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The tax increases, which would go toward purchasing key foothill parcels, must 
be approved by a two-thirds majority of city voters. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Larry Glenn, who cast the only dissenting vote, supported most of 
the recommendations but opposed the moratorium as "morally wrong" because of 
property-rights concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Committee Co-Chairman Bill Robinett conceded that the moratorium, proposed to 
give the city time to tighten hillside building rules, was the panel's "most 
agonizing decision" because of those concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Business owners will probably not be happy either, said Tim Ferguson, a 
committee member who is also president of the Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber board will not discuss the proposed sales tax increase until its 
Nov. 30 meeting. But Don Boehn, the chamber's executive vice president, said an 
increase would probably hurt local merchants. The amount may appear small, he 
said, but "it will have a tremendous psychological effect on customers." 
</P>
<P>
The council will discuss the moratorium and hear a report on the feasibility of 
the other proposals from City Manager Art Cook at its Nov. 28 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Robinett said the creation of a conservancy is a key part of the package. "This 
is a new game in town," he said, noting that if Glendora approves such an 
agency, it will be only the second city in the San Gabriel Valley to create 
one. The Sierra Madre Mountain Conservancy was incorporated in September. 
</P>
<P>
According to a June report by Planning and Redevelopment Director Stan Wong, 
there are 2,112 acres of mostly vacant privately owned properties in the San 
Gabriel foothills and bordering South Hills Park. 
</P>
<P>
That 191-acre park north of the Foothill Freeway was purchased by the city 
through a special tax imposed in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the ultimate method of preserving hillside properties is public 
acquisition," Wong wrote. He estimated that the total land value of the 
hillside parcels was $112 million. 
</P>
<P>
During the moratorium, the committee would like the city to toughen existing 
guidelines for building in rural hillside residential zones. 
</P>
<P>
Among the suggestions for tightening building rules: 
</P>
<P>
* Change the maximum density from one dwelling unit per 40,000 square feet to 
one dwelling unit per 43,560 square feet (one acre). 
</P>
<P>
* Require the retention of major natural features such as significant ridges 
and rock outcroppings. 
</P>
<P>
* Expand the power of the city to regulate use of materials and colors that 
will be visible from outside the property. 
</P>
<P>
* Require a scale model of the development. 
</P>
<P>
Two projects proposing a total of 51 single-family homes in the northeast 
corner of Glendora would be affected by the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Everett Hughes, who has been working with the city for two years on a 
26-lot subdivision proposal and expects approval in January, protested that 
Glendora already has a "very adequate and restrictive hillside ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
In terms of residential development, Glendora is built to 95% of its capacity, 
Wong said. "The hillsides are the only thing that's left." Within the past 
three years the city has approved five development projects in the foothills 
with a total of 67 new homes. 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSALSThe Hillside Conservancy Advisory Committee recommends: 
</P>
<P>
Hillside building moratorium of up to six months. 
</P>
<P>
Citywide tree preservation ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Creation of a private, nonprofit land conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
A three-year property tax override of 20 cents per $100 assessed valuation to 
fund land acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
A three-year, 1/4-cent sales tax increase to fund acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
Increased park and recreation fees. 
</P>
<P>
Tightening of building guidelines in rural hillside residential zones.

WITNESS GETS ON ALL FOURS IN DEFENSE OF SLAIN DOG 
</P>

An animal behavior specialist draped in a white sheet and wearing a straw hat 
crouched on all fours in San Fernando Superior Court last week to demonstrate 
that a dog named Cuddles was neither mean nor aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
Cuddles, a brown-and-white springer spaniel, is the sister of Freckles, a dog 
that was shot and killed while the two animals were scampering on Earnest Lynn 
Reubens' ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Reubens, 59, a 15-year resident of Canyon Country, is on trial in San Fernando 
Superior Court, charged with one count of cruelty to animals and one count of 
using a firearm with gross negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Reubens pleaded not guilty, but according to prosecutors he admitted to Los 
Angeles police that he killed the dog because it was running on his land. 
</P>
<P>
Freckles belonged to 4-year-old Erica Owen, who received the puppy as a 
Christmas gift two years ago. Her 8-year-old sister's Christmas present that 
year was Cuddles, Freckles' littermate. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Rosalie Morton summoned Cuddles to rebut suggestions by 
defense attorney Richard P. Guluzza that Freckles was a big, aggressive animal 
that might have attacked Reubens' sheep. Owen family members said Freckles and 
Cuddles were almost indistinguishable in appearance and temperament. 
</P>
<P>
"I brought her to court so the jury could see the sweet, darling dogs that they 
were. They were not killers, or pit bulls; they were pets," Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Guluzza maintained that the canine victim's sister is irrelevant to 
the case, Judge Ronald S. Coen allowed Cuddles to appear, noting that the 
defense attorney had asked earlier about Freckles' size. 
</P>
<P>
Cuddles was brought to the front of the courtroom on a leash, and Morton asked 
Deena Case, a court-appointed animal behavior specialist, to demonstrate a 
segment of the "27-part Danish temperament test." 
</P>
<P>
As bewildered jurors looked on, Case draped a sheet over her body, put a straw 
hat on her head, crouched and began moving toward Cuddles, darting to the right 
and left. 
</P>
<P>
The dog cowered behind its owner. 
</P>
<P>
Case said the test demonstrated that Cuddles was "mildly fearful" when 
confronted with something she had never seen before and was not aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the trial, the Owens' housekeeper, Delia Villeda, admitted that she 
generally let the two dogs run on Reubens' land for nearly half an hour a day 
when she took walks with Erica's baby brother.

AROUND THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY: WITH HELP FROM A GAME CALLED HUMAN BINGO, PEOPLE 
FROM VERY DIFFERENT CULTURES ARE GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER. WHAT THEY'RE 
FINDING OUT IS HOW MUCH THEY'RE THE SAME.

<P>
They lined up in the cool fall evening, out the door, down the walk, past the 
Mercedes and the Jaguar pulled up to the driveway, and out into the parking lot 
of the Arcadia Masonic Temple. 
</P>
<P>
The line moved slowly, but it wasn't too cold this Wednesday night of the week 
before Thanksgiving. A horn-and-drum serenade from the high school band 
practice wafted across Duarte Road. 
</P>
<P>
Bee Hsu and Shirley Chan chatted about the price of turkey. They greeted Dana 
Junior High School Principal Joe Fox and his wife, Rosemary, and the 
conversation turned to Human Bingo. 
</P>
<P>
In Human Bingo, they explained, you fill your card by answering questions about 
the other people at a gathering. Each square poses a question about a person's 
background; the player must find a person likely to answer yes and get him or 
her to sign the square. 
</P>
<P>
Who understands or speaks a Chinese dialect? Who makes good German food? Who 
has studied in a school outside the United States? Who is a native of 
California? Who knows the names of 10 countries in Africa? 
</P>
<P>
Human Bingo is an icebreaker; its object is to get people who don't know one 
another and who come from very different cultures to talk with each other. 
</P>
<P>
At the third annual Intercultural Evening in Arcadia, it was working. As we 
moved forward in line toward the name-sticker desk, we could see excited people 
scribbling on the yellow Bingo sheets. No cocktails, no hors d'oeuvres, but 
more than 300 people were talking, many of them, clearly, to people they hadn't 
met before. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, thousands of Asian immigrants have moved to the San 
Gabriel Valley. Many of them live in Monterey Park, which is now more than half 
Asian and gets most of the press, nationally, as the country's first suburban 
Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
But with its students consistently among the top achievers in California 
Assessment Program scores, Arcadia has drawn a stream of professional, upper 
middle-class Asians, largely Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
If downtown Los Angeles and Monterey Park are the first stop for Asians moving 
to the United States, places like Hacienda Heights and Arcadia, an affluent 
community of just under 50,000, are where they go when they're ready to move 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Often, perhaps because of their insulation by miles and money, these second 
stops are less prepared to welcome new ingredients to the American melting pot. 
These intercultural evenings, a joint project of the Arcadia Unified School 
District and Chamber of Commerce, are an attempt to remedy that. 
</P>
<P>
On this night, dinner was Persian, Chinese and American, served cafeteria 
style. At a table in back, two very different couples, one middle-aged and 
Anglo, one young and Chinese, sat to eat. 
</P>
<P>
Richard and Marilyn Dootson live in Bradbury -- in the house, Richard Dootson 
volunteered, in which race car driver Mickey Thompson and his wife were killed. 
Richard Dootson has a real estate business in Arcadia. Xi and Shoping Wang are 
living with the Dootsons while they are students in Pasadena. The Dootsons call 
Xi Wang "Stanley," a name given him long ago by an English professor in China. 
Xi Wang is a doctoral candidate in robotics at Caltech; his wife takes English 
classes at Pasadena City College. They are from Harbin, in the far northeast 
corner of China. Xi Wang was 4, the youngest of four children in his family, 
when the Cultural Revolution came in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
His father, a college professor, his mother and his oldest brother were sent to 
the countryside to work in the fields. He and the other two children, the 
oldest 12, were left alone in their house. A friend of their mother's came to 
cook for them on weekends; they stored food for the week just by leaving it 
outside in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
Xi Wang laughed when he described reaching outside to break pieces off a loaf 
when he was hungry. His father is dead now; his mother lives in Oregon and, 
after last summer's massacre in Beijing, he is unsure of his future. The Wangs 
and the Dootsons, an intercultural household, left early because Xi Wang had to 
study. 
</P>
<P>
On stage, in front of welcome banners in five languages, Dana teacher Sherry 
Root and students from Australia, Colombia and Malaysia talked about living in 
America. Later, Angi Ma Wong gave tips on cultural differences in body 
language, and how they can be important in business. 
</P>
<P>
Do such experiments as this evening in Arcadia accomplish anything? 
</P>
<P>
Eloise Ward lives in Arcadia and works at a music store on South Baldwin 
Avenue. She was chairwoman of the first intercultural evening two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I volunteered to do it because I was afraid -- not afraid so much, but 
ignorant," Ward said. "I wasn't really happy about the changes . . . I don't 
know how to say that so it doesn't look bad in the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"When things change dramatically, it's scary. People like to see things stay 
the same. . . . But once you spend time with someone who's different from you 
are, you find out basically at the core, we're all the same, and the 
differences, instead of being strange, become exciting and fascinating. . . . 
</P>
<P>

open." MARY R. HEFFRON

NEIGHBORING AREA FEELS IMPACT OF EFFORT TO STOP 710 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What do council members Evelyn Fierro, James Hodge Jr. and Dick Richards have 
in common? They're South Pasadena politicians united to maintain the 30-year 
war against the Long Beach Freeway. All three are committed to preventing this 
freeway's completion within their city limits. (Times, Nov. 2, 9.) 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not you appreciate freeways, the fact remains that South Pasadena's 
successful crusade against the 710 has a hideous impact on surrounding 
communities -- on motorists and residents alike. 
</P>
<P>
One has to wonder how much longer motorists will put up with the untenable 
traffic conditions South Pasadena has created at Fremont and Valley, on 
Atlantic, on Garfield, on all north/south streets in this area. 
</P>
<P>
One has to wonder how much longer it will take for the tens of thousands of 
pedestrians and residents who live in the proximity of these streets to realize 
the 60% increase in traffic and exhaust fumes have been thrust upon them by 
South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
One has to wonder how long these affected motorists, parents of students and 
residents will allow South Pasadena to dictate everyone else's environment. 
</P>
<P>
We may not have the megabucks that South Pasadena has been spending with 
impunity for the last 30 years, but we must outnumber them 500 to 1. If only 
half of us wrote our elected state officials or telephoned their local offices 
and assured them that we were not second-class citizens and that their 
reelection depended on their efforts to expedite completion of the 710, want to 
bet some barriers will begin to crumble? 
</P>
<P>
We must remember Caltrans has been the only persistent agency trying to 
complete the "missing link." They can see the total picture, but the only 
critics they hear are from South Pasadena. It's critical they hear from the 
other side. If tens of thousands called Caltrans requesting completion of the 
710, that would essentially end South Pasadena's stranglehold on the last link 
of the Long Beach Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Should South Pasadena prevail once more, their greatest allies will have been 
the acquiescent motorists who quietly creep along side streets bumper-to-bumper 
and the non-complaining parents and residents, all of whom breathe incredible 
amounts of pollution that South Pasadena shoved out of their back yard into 
everyone else's.

The chief glory of every people arises from its authors. -- Samuel Johnson 
</P>
<P>
Great Britain has produced more than its share of great poets and novelists, 
and it is easily possible to visit their homes, to walk the country lanes they 
trod, to stay in their towns and villages, which now abound with bed and 
breakfast signs . . . and to relive the scenes they described so vividly. 
</P>
<P>
Although guided tours are available, my husband and I found it more exciting -- 
and less expensive -- to strike off on our own, not knowing what adventures the 
day would bring, to discover the "scept'red isle" of our imagination that we 
first encountered in books. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, after a rainy five days in London, we rented a car and headed 
south in search of sunshine and literary sites, staying where and when the mood 
willed. 
</P>
<P>
We agreed that our first destination should be Henry James' home, Lamb House, 
in Rye, East Sussex. It was a logical place to start, bridging the transition 
from America to England with the Boston expatriate who became a British 
citizen. Besides, we wanted to spend our first night with a view of the English 
Channel. 
</P>
<P>
After escaping the motorway to the quieter pace of a "single carriageway," we 
approached Rye with some dismay. This once-flourishing island town, one of the 
original Cinque Ports, was actually two miles inland, due to silting of the 
harbor in the 16th Century. But the ancient hilly town, with its cobbled 
streets, was still delightful, despite the proliferation of souvenir shops. 
</P>
<P>
We stopped at a bookshop and inquired about a good place to stay and have 
dinner. The clerk suggested the Mermaid Inn, an old smugglers' haunt dating 
from 1420. We took her advice and were charmed by the graceful decor, the many 
antiques and the mullioned windows. We ordered drinks by the huge fireplace, 
then treated ourselves to a traditional dinner of roast beef, jacket potatoes 
and Yorkshire pudding. 
</P>
<P>
Next we set out to explore the historic older section of town. Then, precisely 
at the opening hour of 2 p.m., we wound our way up West Street to the top of 
the hill, where we confronted a solidly respectable, brick-fronted Georgian 
house. 
</P>
<P>
A tall door admitted us to a paneled entrance hall, where a woman at a desk 
accepted our admission fee. Her family was privileged to rent Lamb House from 
the National Trust, she told us, and it was with pride and a certain 
proprietary air that she showed the house to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, we first wanted to see the study where James dictated his novels to 
his secretary. Alas, the Garden Room where he worked in summer had been 
destroyed by a German bomb in 1940, but we were welcome to browse in the Green 
Room, his winter writing room. Adjacent to it was a bedroom known as the King's 
Room because George I occupied it in 1726. 
</P>
<P>
The Green Room was smaller than we would have thought and crowded with 
mementos, photographs and books -- reminders of James' company of literary 
friends: Joseph Conrad, H. G. Wells, Stephen Crane and Ford Madox Ford, all of 
whom had homes nearby and were frequent visitors.

<P>
As we wandered about the house and the walled garden with its paths and lawn, 
its flowers and fruit trees, it was easy to see why James had fallen in love 
with it. He wrote: "The quiet, essential amiability of Lamb House only deepens 
with experience . . . All the good things that I hoped of the place have, in 
fact, properly bloomed and flourished here." From 1897 until James' death in 
1916 he wrote six novels here, among them "The Ambassadors," "The Wings of the 
Dove" and "The Golden Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
We thanked the current tenant, wishing we could trade places with her, but we 
had "promises to keep and miles to go before we sleep." The following day we 
saw Rudyard Kipling's home, Bateman's, another National Trust property, in 
nearby Burwash, another East Sussex village. 
</P>
<P>
The village had little to offer in the way of bed and breakfast, but we did 
find a farmhouse on the outskirts. The bed was concave, but no matter. We were 
served a rousing breakfast of bacon, bangers, fried tomatoes, toast and 
marmalade. After a hike through the countryside we drove the short distance to 
Bateman's, arriving at the opening hour, 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
We were impressed by the tall-chimneyed stone mansion with its grand entryway 
and extensive grounds, where Kipling lived from 1902 until his death in 1936. 
All this from the fruits of his pen. 
</P>
<P>
The living quarters were staid and unimaginative, unlike the man, reflecting 
solid middle-class respectability. 
</P>
<P>
Only in his upstairs study did he seem to take flight. There was his globe of 
the world, his maps, his books, his paintings, his guns, his sabers, his 
treasures from India. His view through large, leaded windows was of misty 
gardens and the countryside beyond. This was the ideal writer's workroom. 
Quiet, secluded. 
</P>
<P>
Our next destination lay to the west and promised a distinct contrast. After 
the vigor and thunder of Kipling, the international range of his writing, we 
were to visit the home of a quiet spinster who cooked and cleaned and sewed and 
rarely traveled beyond her tiny village. That such a confined life could 
produce elegant prose which ranks with the best in English literature is an 
enduring miracle. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Austen lived in a modest brick house in the Hampshire village of Chawton 
15 miles northeast of Winchester, where she wrote the final versions of her six 
novels from 1805 to 1817. It bore little resemblance to the country manor we 
had imagined. Her bedroom was cramped, the other rooms unprepossessing. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in front of a smallish fireplace in the living room, it was impossible 
to conceive that here she had written her novels secretively on scraps of 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
She was buried in Winchester Cathedral. There, the brass tablet makes no 
mention of her novels, describing her only as the daughter of a respected local 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Hardy's cottage in the county of Dorset -- a half-day's drive west -- 
was next on our list, and we doubted that he would be recalled merely as the 
son of a respected local family. Quite the contrary. Dorchester, where he lived 
and worked, and the neighboring hamlet of Higher Bockhampton where he was born, 
celebrate his genius with unabashed pride. 
</P>
<P>
There is a Hardy statue, a Hardy Room in the museum, guides to his imaginary 
county of Wessex. Hotels, restaurants and streets are named after the 
characters and settings in his novels. A National Trust gift shop overflows 
with his prose and poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Max Gate, the home in Dorchester where Hardy spent his mature years, is not 
open to the public, so we drove three miles northeast of the city to the 
cottage where he lived until he was 30. The approach from the car park was a 
10-minute walk through Thorncombe Wood to a picture-post card thatched cottage 
and a garden in riotous bloom. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy was born in 1840 in this house built by his grandfather, who, like his 
father, was a stonemason. Hardy walked to school in Dorchester, which he called 
Casterbridge in his novels. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 16 he was apprenticed to an architect and later pursued his 
architectural studies in London. After marrying, he moved to various towns to 
work on projects, finally returning in his 40s to Dorchester, where he died in 
1928. 
</P>
<P>
The interior of Hardy's cottage is less attractive than the exterior. The rooms 
are small, with low ceilings. A steep staircase leads upstairs and, in a tiny 
bedroom overlooking the garden, is the deep window seat where he wrote "Under 
the Greenwood Tree" and "Far from the Madding Crowd." 
</P>
<P>
We took a different walk back to our car. Lazing along fragrant country lanes, 
passing houses with signs offering eggs, herbs and honey, we reveled in Hardy's 
landscape. We were tempted to gather wildflowers, but they would wilt long 
before we arrived that evening at the elegant country hotel where, for once, we 
had made reservations. We were to be guests that night in the former home of 
William Wordsworth and his sister, Dorothy. 
</P>
<P>
It was a circuitous route to Alfoxton Park, near Holford in Somerset. In this 
handsome, two-story Queen Anne country house, Wordsworth began his great 
creative period in 1797-98. 
</P>
<P>
Amid 50 acres of woodland set in a hollow of the Quantock Hills, Alfoxton had 
everything. Even the modern swimming pool and tennis court did not detract from 
the tranquillity. Quince vines climbed the white walls. Herb and vegetable 
gardens flourished. Chicken, geese, pigs, sheep and cattle were raised in 
adjoining pens and fields for the hotel's kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
The bar was a wondrously inviting, dark-paneled room that had once been 
Wordsworth's study. As the tables filled, a wispy elderly woman paused 
uncertainly at the empty chair beside us. We invited her to join us. 
</P>
<P>
She was a Bristol University professor researching a book on Wordsworth, and 
she regaled us with stories about William and Dorothy. They had moved to 
Alfoxton to be near Samuel Coleridge, who lived three miles away in Nether 
Stowey. 
</P>
<P>
Coleridge's cottage was now a museum, according to the professor. There he 
wrote "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" and "Kubla Khan." It was a happy time 
for him, all too brief in his tormented life. 
</P>
<P>
Wales was our next stop. That mythic land of lilting voices, song and fable had 
long appealed to us and we were eager to explore the countryside described by 
its most famous poet, Dylan Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Caught in a twilight traffic jam in Swansea, we barely made it before dark to 5 
Cwmdonkin Drive, where the poet was born in 1914 and spent his first 20 years. 
The house is not open to the public, so we hurried on to the nearby seaside 
resort area, called The Mumbles, and the Mermaid Hotel, a drinking haunt of 
Thomas', where we planned to spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' carousing was legendary. An ancient barmaid at the Mermaid had known 
the poet. "A loud, rough sort," she said, "but he could charm the birds out of 
the trees." 
</P>
<P>
The next morning we drove to Laugharne (pronounced Larn), celebrated as 
Llareggub in "Under Milkwood." It is a weathered town built on a hill slope, 
with streets leading down to an old harbor. Thomas loved the town when he first 
saw it in 1934, and kept returning there, spending the last 4 1/2 years of his 
life at The Boathouse with his wife, Caitlin. 
</P>
<P>
To fortify ourselves for the half-mile walk to The Boathouse we stopped at 
Brown's Hotel, the poet's favorite pub, for a Buckley Best Bitter. The publican 
had been a friend of Dylan's and pointed out the table in the corner where he 
and Caitlin always sat -- and argued. 
</P>
<P>
We found our way to Dylan's Walk just outside town, and paused at his writing 
shed. The former garage, which he called "My Shack," was sparsely furnished 
with a deal table and chairs. But the view across the estuary was spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
Farther along the path, The Boathouse -- "my seashaken house on a breakneck of 
rocks" -- seemed to grow out of the cliff face. It has been almost too lovingly 
restored by the Carmarthen District Council with some of the original 
furnishings. The orderly rooms are out of character. One cannot imagine the 
untidy, temperamental Thomases staging one of their classic brawls in such 
immaculate surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
We browsed in the book shop, studied the photographic display in the bedrooms 
and stopped for tea and Welsh cakes in the former dining room. Later, standing 
in front of his grave in the town's St. Martin's churchyard, we were surprised 
by the simple wording of the inscription on the white cross -- "In Memory of 
Dylan Thomas, died November 9, 1953. RIP" 
</P>
<P>
It lacked a poet's touch: 
</P>
<P>
 "Do not go gentle into that good night, 
</P>
<P>
 Old age should burn and rave at close of day; 
</P>
<P>
 Rage, rage against the dying of the light." 
</P>
<P>
 Laugharne was the westernmost point and the last stop on our literary odyssey. 
Time to head back to Heathrow, drop off the car and await our flight to Los 
Angeles. As we sped along the M4 our minds, like Robert Browning's in his poem, 
shifted to "Home Thoughts, from Abroad."

VISITORS FIND SOVIET TRIP CAN BE RISKY BUSINESS; 
</P>
<P>
TOURISM: CRIMES AGAINST TRAVELERS TO THE SOVIET UNION ARE UP THIS YEAR. AMONG 
THE WORST CITIES ARE MOSCOW AND LENINGRAD. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tourists beware: The Soviet Union is not the "safe" travel destination it once 
was. 
</P>
<P>
Crime is up 33.3% this year, according to Tass, the official Soviet news 
agency. The news is worse when you look at the figures for violent crimes (up 
42.4%), property crimes (up 54.1%) and street crimes (up 77.1%). 
</P>
<P>
And more bad news: Among the areas where street crime is the worst are the 
prime tourist cities of Moscow and Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
Tass reported that between January and July of this year, 2,000 crimes were 
committed against foreigners. Eighty-five percent of those were property 
crimes, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is so serious that authorities recently decided to set up a 
special police force to deal with crime against foreigners in 46 cities in the 
Soviet Union, the official Communist daily paper, Pravda, reported. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to do something. They're anxious not to lose tourists," said Mark 
Sanna, regional security officer at the American Embassy in Moscow, which works 
closely with the local police. 
</P>
<P>
How to stay safe? Police here warn tourists not to enter into negotiations with 
black marketeers or prostitutes for the sale of foreign currency or other goods 
such as clothes or electronics. Most of the crimes against foreigners were 
committed during these negotiations, Tass reported. 
</P>
<P>
But Western diplomats consider taxis the most dangerous items for tourists. The 
mildest crime tourists may encounter with taxi drivers is their demand for 
foreign currency. It is illegal to deal in foreign currency in the Soviet Union 
and for Soviets to own it. 
</P>
<P>
But tourists leaving hotels more often than not find that drivers refuse to 
take them anywhere in exchange for rubles. And they are demanding exorbitant 
rates: $15 to $20 for a 3-ruble (about 50 cents U.S.) ride. 
</P>
<P>
"Tourists, especially those at the Cosmos Hotel on the outskirts of the city, 
feel trapped," one Moscow-based Western diplomat explained. "They don't know 
the language. Because they can't read the (Cyrillic) alphabet, it's difficult 
for them to ride the subways, so they are more dependent on taxis than they may 
be in other countries." 
</P>
<P>
More frightening was the diplomat's account of reports at other embassies of 
theft at knifepoint by taxi drivers. "One taxi will take you from the airport. 
About halfway to the city, another taxi will cut off the one you are a 
passenger in. The other taxi driver threatens you at knifepoint while your 
driver looks on helplessly. We expect they are operating as a team," the 
diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Brazilian journalist Jose Arbex reported his story to the Soviet weekly 
newspaper Moscow News after he was robbed in this fashion, to warn other 
foreigners. He lost $1,370 in the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
And Sanna said he receives six to seven reports a month of embassy staff being 
robbed in taxis. 
</P>
<P>
It's more expensive, but tourists may want to book drivers from the Intourist 
agencies at the airport and the hotels, one diplomat advised. She added that in 
another twist on the taxi scam, gangsters watch passengers getting into cabs 
with saleable items such as VCRs, then follow the taxi to the customer's home 
or hotel. That home or room then becomes the target of a break-in. 
</P>
<P>
The problem has grown to such an extent that Tass recently reported that the 
manager of the Soviet taxi agency promised to put lookouts at hotels and other 
tourist spots to watch for potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
Though foreigners who live here are less likely to use cabs because they often 
have their own cars and drivers, they still risk being robbed either on the 
street or through break-ins of their apartments or cars. 
</P>
<P>
Sanna said embassy personnel frequently have their pockets picked along a 
bridge leading from the embassy to the Ukraine Hotel, an Intourist hotel that 
attracts criminal elements who want foreign currency. He warned that tourist 
sites such as Novodevichy Convent, where former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev 
is buried, are other popular pick-pocket areas. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Meadows, director of day care and the preschool center at the American 
Embassy, was a robbery victim while shopping at the Georgian market -- another 
hot tourist spot -- in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
She was "jostled and pushed while she was carrying our 2-year-old and walking 
with our 7- and 8-year-olds," her husband Doug said. "When she got to our car, 
she realized that her purse had been unzipped and her wallet with all her 
credit cards and foreign currency stolen." 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the first time the Meadowses have been victims of crime in Moscow. 
Foreigners posted to Moscow live in compounds guarded by militia men whose job 
it is to report on their activities. However, as Soviet society continues to 
open through glasnost, some of these "mili men," as Westerners call them, have 
been withdrawn from residence compounds. 
</P>
<P>
Said Meadows, manager of the agricultural product department at DuPont's Moscow 
office, whose building has no mili man: "Our car has been broken into three 
times this year and our radio/cassette player and speakers stolen. In addition, 
we heard there was a break-in in an apartment on the top floor of our 
building." 
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper Nedelya recently reported that there were 4,000 break-ins 
in private apartments in Moscow last year. For foreigners with VCRs that can be 
sold for up to 11,000 rubles on the black market, the fears of break-ins are 
growing. 
</P>
<P>
Residents at a new foreign compound in Moscow that opened this summer without a 
mili man organized a petition after several break-ins of apartments and cars, 
and finally got 24-hour guard duty. 
</P>
<P>
Said John Lombard, Moscow bureau chief for the Australian Broadcasting Corp., 
whose wife Jean organized the petition: "The rising crime rate is quite 
significant. I don't feel personally threatened when I'm outside, but if you're 
a single woman walking back from the metro out here, you probably aren't too 
comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Carey Goldberg, a Moscow-based free-lance reporter for the Boston Globe who 
lives in the same building, agrees. "I feel less safe now than I used to. It 
used to be a plus to look like a foreigner. I felt as if it gave you immunity 
to crime. Now I play it down. 
</P>
<P>
"I bought dull-colored coats to try to look more Soviet because I'm more afraid 
of robbery now, though I'm not worried about being assaulted. I think people 
here are greedy for foreign currency, but they are not violent." 
</P>
<P>
But Sanna of the American Embassy said he has had reports from two American 
students who were raped here since January. And, he said, another diplomat was 
attacked on the street. Her assailants tried to push her into a cab, but she 
bit one of them on the wrist and escaped. "But she was traumatized," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a country where Westerners have access to food, clothing, electronic goods 
and other consumer items that Soviets do not, it is not surprising that the 
crime rate is increasing as Soviets become frustrated with their plummeting 
standard of living. "The gap is growing. You feel like the aristocracy now. 
It's uncomfortable," Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Tonsing, a Moscow-based free-lance photographer from California, said he 
and his wife, Ann Imso, a correspondent with the Associated Press here, are 
lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's even stolen our windshield wipers (a much-in-demand commodity)." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "I have a foreign car; I'm a marked target. I don't worry too 
much about being robbed, but I don't go to bad parts of the city, either. 
</P>
<P>
"One friend visiting us had his car broken into and his wallet and papers 
stolen within five minutes of parking his car in a bad section of the city. 
Though his car was a Lada, it was identified by its plates (which have 
different colors for foreigners) as being a foreigner's car." 
</P>
<P>
Once aware of the potential problems, most here agree, tourists should be able 
to avoid them by being careful. And as several Americans said: "I still feel 
safer walking around here than I do in New York City."

SKIING A HIGH ROUTE THROUGH THE SIERRA NEVADA 
</P>

SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dry whiffs of sagebrush streamed through the open windows of the pickup as the 
three of us, clad in shorts and T-shirts, headed north along U.S. 395 toward 
the high-desert town of Independence. 
</P>
<P>
The road ahead, wonderfully lonely at 1 a.m., was arrow-straight and lined with 
Joshua trees. 
</P>
<P>
North of Mojave, the dark mass of the Sierra Nevada began to loom higher, 
closer. We began to see small patches of what we hoped was snow on the tallest 
peaks. 
</P>
<P>
Was it snow or bare granite? Tough to tell with no moon. 
</P>
<P>
It was early spring and we were on our way into the Owens Valley to ski across 
the Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
California's Sierra Nevada is a range of superlatives. More than 400 miles 
long, it covers an area greater than that of the French, Swiss and Italian Alps 
combined. It's the longest continuous range in the conterminous United States, 
and also the highest. 
</P>
<P>
Dark clouds crowded the sky as we rolled past Mt. Whitney, the highest point at 
14,494 feet. By the time we pulled off Route 395 at Independence, all we could 
see was a narrow strip of dirt road fading into darkness. The stars were gone. 
The mountains had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
At dawn we get our first glimpse of our intended route over the Sierra Crest. 
The highest peaks along this section of the range soared more than 10,000 feet 
above the Owens Valley floor. This first view, stunning as it was, was also 
discouraging. We were there to ski, and there was virtually no snow in sight. 
</P>
<P>
We drove about eight hours from San Francisco to ski what has become a classic 
backcountry tour. Simply called the "High Route," it follows a line that 
crosses over the backbone of the High Sierra -- from the desert floor of the 
Owens Valley in the east to the giant trees of Sequoia National Park in the 
west, a distance of about 35 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The route entered the High Sierra through Shepherd Pass, a notch in the 
fortress-like eastern wall of the Sierra Crest. Once over Shepherd Pass, the 
route stayed above 10,500 feet for several days. 
</P>
<P>
Few trees survive at this elevation. During the winter there are no flowing 
streams, no visible lakes, no trails. The route is unmarked. Navigation was by 
map and compass using major peaks and ridges as guideposts. 
</P>
<P>
The high alpine country stands transformed by snow and ice into a world of 
radiant blue and white light -- an arctic landscape framed by serrated 
ridgelines of bold Sierra granite. 
</P>
<P>
Our surroundings at the Shepherd Pass trailhead the first morning were somewhat 
less than arctic. There was a cactus about three feet from my sleeping bag. The 
hillsides were covered with sagebrush and sand, instead of snow. And there was 
a lizard sunning itself on our pile of skis. 
</P>
<P>
We started up the trail in shorts, our foreheads wrapped in bandannas to hold 
back rolling beads of sweat. Six hours later we began to question the sanity of 
hiking up a dusty desert trail in ski boots, carrying skis, poles, ice axes, 
crampons, shovels, and pounds of cold weather clothing toward a promised land 
of snow. 
</P>
<P>
We had been told the High Route was best skied in late April or May. We decided 
to try it in early April, due to the season's meager snowfall. 
</P>
<P>
Just as we began to wonder if we should have gone in March, or maybe February, 
we turned a rocky corner and . . . snow at last. 
</P>
<P>
Towering above us, all the while hidden from view by a high ridgeline, was 
Shepherd Pass in all its icy glory. 
</P>
<P>
It took us all day to reach the snowline from the desert below. We were anxious 
to get our skis off our backs and onto our feet. But instead of climbing the 
high pass in late afternoon, a time when avalanche gods are the most rowdy, we 
set up camp just short of the notch. It was one last chance to camp on warm, 
dry gravel before stepping into winter. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning we started off early, before the sun hit the peaks above us. 
The snow was frozen solid. The front points of our crampons barely made a mark. 
Very little danger of an avalanche at that hour. 
</P>
<P>
This plan of attack became an accepted ritual. If in our travels we would reach 
the base of a steep pass late in the afternoon, we would stop, make camp, and 
wait for nightfall to consolidate the snow, starting our climb early the next 
morning before the sun has a chance to loosen things up. 
</P>
<P>
Shepherd Pass was steeper than expected. Our knees hit the snow with each step 
upward. Shards of crusted snow and ice were sent whizzing down the slope as we 
planted our ice axes between kicked steps. This was going to be as much a 
mountaineering route as a ski route. 
</P>
<P>
At the top of the 12,000-foot pass, the view opened up across the head of Kern 
Canyon to 13,641-foot Milestone Mountain. Square miles of untracked snow laid 
waiting at our feet. It was time to unpack the skis and cut loose. 
</P>
<P>
The five-mile, mostly downhill run to the rim of the canyon was fun, though a 
bit dicey; skiing with full packs was going to take some getting used to. The 
air was cold and the sun intense. 
</P>
<P>
One minute we were chattering across the tops of crusted, wind-sharpened 
suncups. Sort of like skiing over a giant cheese grater coated with ice. 
</P>
<P>
The next minute a sun-warmed hollow grabbed our skis like glue. Moving along at 
a good clip, our skis suddenly slow on the warm sticky snow, our bodies, 
propelled along by the heavy packs on our backs, continued on their way. The 
end result -- a perfectly executed face plant. 
</P>
<P>
Between the suncups and the soft stuff was Sierra corn snow. Each day, the 
spring sun warms the snowpack, coating the individual grains of snow with water 
that refreezes at night. The grains get larger as they are coated and recoated 
until they look like kernels of corn. 
</P>
<P>
Tight, smooth turns are effortless on the ball-bearing like surface of good 
Sierra corn. We were tempted to climb back up and ski the good spots again -- 
but this was only day two. The long haul up the dry side of the range quickly 
faded from memory. 
</P>
<P>
Our first high camp was on an airy ledge on the rim of magnificent Kern Canyon. 
The surrounding landscape was absolutely still, locked up tight until summer 
thaw. You can look 20 miles down a canyon this time of year and know that it is 
utterly empty -- wilderness in the true meaning of the word. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the afternoon we encountered a steep drop-off packed with deep, 
sun-softened snow. Dangerous to ski, impossible to down-climb in boots. 
</P>
<P>
Each ski-less step buried us waist deep in wet slush. The only way down was to 
try a zig-zagging ski traverse, executing a buttocks arrest at each end. 
</P>
<P>
When an obstacle such as a tree, rock or cliff presented itself, or when an 
unsafe velocity was reached, we sat down and firmly planted our posteriors in 
the snow. 
</P>
<P>
We reached the base of Milestone Pass too late in the day to climb it safely, 
but too early to just sit in camp. It didn't take long for a diversion to 
present itself. 
</P>
<P>
Directly above our tents, the finger-like spire of Milestone Mountain pointed 
skyward in a single 1,500-foot sweep of granite. I decided to ski to its base 
and poke around. 
</P>
<P>
Before long I was halfway up a steep rock wall, anxious to find a foothold big 
enough for my clown-toed ski boot. 
</P>
<P>
The view from the top was incredible. Rocky summits perfectly outlined in the 
sharp, clear air stretched away in every direction. It was nearly dusk -- magic 
hour in the Range of Light. 
</P>
<P>
The tallest peaks caught the last orange rays of the sinking sun and burned 
with alpenglow. Behind the glowing summits, a pastel sky separated into 
horizontal bands of rose, blue, then violet. The first star sparked on, 
reminding me that it was time to start down and return to camp for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Once over Milestone Pass, we followed the crest of the Great Western Divide to 
Triple Divide Peak and frozen Glacier Lake. Beyond the lake, the route dropped 
over what appeared to be a sheer wall into Cloud Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
We tied our skis onto our packs, strapped on crampons, tightened the wrist 
loops of our ice axes and inched our way across an uncomfortably exposed slope 
above the canyon rim. The snow was hard and glazed. 
</P>
<P>
We all made it across, but the fun wasn't done. A short but airy pass on the 
far side of Cloud Canyon led us onto a knife-edged ridge. We walked along it to 
a point where we could look down into upper Deadman Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Ahead was a wide-open bowl with a three-mile downhill free-for-all to the next 
pass at Big Bird Peak. After side-slipping on the edges of our skis down to the 
head of the canyon, we pushed off and glided for 25 minutes, nonstop, to the 
far side. Sweet payback for all the uphill work. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Big Bird we crossed the Tableland, an open expanse of rolling ridges and 
flat plateau at the headwaters of the Kaweah River. We were still above 10,000 
feet, but we could see dark green trees below along the banks of the Marble 
Fork of the Kaweah. Perfect corn snow slid beneath our skis across Table 
Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
As we descended, the air began to get noticeably thicker. For the first time in 
several days, we actually smelled something. Up high the air was thin and 
sterile; ice, snow and granite don't smell. 
</P>
<P>
Down low the air was suddenly rich with pine resin and the musky odor of 
sun-warmed tundra grass. We took long, deep breaths. 
</P>
<P>
Soon we left the open slopes behind and were sking through timber and the first 
shade in days. We played follow-the-leader through tree-lined slalom courses 
until rocks and fallen trees began to poke through the thinning blanket of 
snow. 
</P>
<P>
We finally ran out of skiable snow just below the Pear Lake Ranger Hut in 
Sequoia National Park. It was time to pack the skis and hoof it. 
</P>
<P>
Three hours later we stepped onto pavement at the Wolverton Ski Area parking 
lot. We had been shedding layers of clothing on the way down, and we were back 
to shorts and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
There was no sign of snow. The ski area had shut down months earlier. People 
walking by found it hard to believe that we had spent the last six days on 
skis. Most of them would probably drive through the park without seeing as much 
as a remnant roadside snowbank. 
</P>
<P>
After eating we hiked out of earshot of the road, rolled out our sleeping bags 
on a soft bed of sequoia needles and fell asleep looking up at impossibly huge 
trees. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The High Route can be skied using either Nordic or Alpine gear. A typical 
backcountry setup uses lightweight, metal-edged touring skis with stiff-soled 
leather boots, which are attached to the ski at the toe.

PUERTO VALLARTA, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This quaint and popular city is known equally for sun, surf and shopping. 
</P>
<P>
El Centro, however, has the most charming and reasonable shops. 
</P>
<P>
They are clustered along streets that run parallel to the beach, mostly north 
of the Rio Cuale that runs through Puerto Vallarta. 
</P>
<P>
On the boardwalk, Paseo Diaz Ordaz, there are dozens of shops with trendy, 
casual and beach attire. 
</P>
<P>
Best are ACA JOE (No. 588) and Ruben Torres (No. 590), which have their own 
lines of attractive slacks (from $20 U.S.), shirts (from $15), shorts (from 
$15) and tank tops (from $8) in lightweight cottons and lively tropical colors. 
</P>
<P>
At No. 880 is a small mall with several handcraft shops. Best of these is La 
Otra Galeria, with inexpensive watercolors and oil paintings by Mexican 
artists, plus signed prints by Lepe, a popular artist, for about $100. 
</P>
<P>
The next street inland is Morelos. The Designer's Bazaar (No. 500) sells 
Vercellino's lovely and lavish cotton jersey clothing. There are dresses (from 
$60), plus mix-and-match skirts (from $40), shirts (from $35) and slacks (from 
$40) in a palette of plush colors. 
</P>
<P>
Galeria Uno (No. 561) exhibits paintings, sculpture and prints by top Mexican 
artists. Canvasses sell from about $200 and up, although there are some less 
expensive prints and watercolors. 
</P>
<P>
St. Valentin Boutique (No. 574) sells home furnishings, including rough-hewn 
Mexican country furniture, handwoven tablecloths (from $15) and wall hangings 
(from $25), earthenware tablewares (from $15 per five-piece setting) and 
handwoven rugs from Oaxaca (from $45). 
</P>
<P>
The Rolling Stone Boot Co. (near Corona) sells cowboy boots in a full range of 
leathers and colors. Prices about $65 and up per pair, and you can buy a second 
pair (if it costs less than the first pair) for half price. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado (No. 586) shows the work of Mario Gonzales, an artist whose work is 
quite similar in theme and style to that of the surrealist-folklorist sculptor 
Sergio Bustamante. Pieces are made in limited editions of 100 and sell for 
about $50 and up. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Pacific (No. 660) has sports and casual separates from $15 up, and 
outlets for Ralph Lauren/Polo, Calvin Klein, Guess, Ellesse and others, on 
Morelos between Aldama and Abasolo, sell sportswear for less than U.S. prices. 
</P>
<P>
A little farther north, Puerto Vallarta Arts and Crafts Center (No. 779) 
specializes in heavy carved dark wood furniture, including sofas (from about 
$600), dining room sets (from about $800) and chests (from about $300), plus 
wood and leather equipales dining room sets (from about $275) and smaller home 
decorating items such as carved santos (from about $60) and ceramics. 
</P>
<P>
On Calle Juarez, La Reja (No. 201) features colorful papier-mache animals, 
figurines, fruit and vegetables (from $3 per item). 
</P>
<P>
Ric (No. 207) has a selection of distinctive gold and silver jewelry set with 
semi-precious stones. Earrings sell for as little as $30. 
</P>
<P>
Azteca (Nos. 244, 360 and 422) sells typical silver jewelry from Taxco as well 
as its own line of distinctive super-heavy silver (from about $200), 14- or 
18-carat gold necklaces and bracelets. This is Puerto Vallarta's oldest and 
best established jewelry store. 
</P>
<P>
Casa de la Artesania Jalisciense (corner of Zaragosa) is a government-sponsored 
outlet for the craftspeople of the state of Jalisco. The shop offers a 
selection of handcrafts made locally or in Guadalaraja, Tlaquepaque, Ajijic and 
other regional crafts-producing towns. 
</P>
<P>
Best are the ceramics, from earthenware birds or frogs (from $5) to full table 
settings (from $20 per five-piece setting), lamp bases (from $35) and vases 
(from $10), and there also is a display of glassware and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Bustamante, the surrealist and folklorist sculptor, has a gallery at No. 275. 
Decorative pieces show large rabbits emerging from chicken eggs, lizards 
ensconced in houses and figures that are half human half mythic creature. 
Fascinating and fun. All in limited editions, with prices about $200 and up. 
</P>
<P>
Huaracheria Lety (No. 478) is the source for Mexican-style woven leather 
sandals (called huaraches) that come in the traditional neutral or blond 
leather, and all colors of the rainbow, for about $20 a pair. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Pulos (No. 479) sells this designer's colorful handwoven cotton dresses 
(from about $185) and separates. The clothes are loose and comfortable, often 
adorned with appealing embroidery or applique for a sophisticated folk look. 
The shop also carries lovely accessories and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Max (No. 487) features designer Max Reinhard Jager Bussow's silk-screened 
cotton jersey clothes (from about $45 and up), plus wonderful capes made from 
handwoven wool (from $140), as well as handwoven ponchos and huipiles (from 
$80) from Guatemala and Oaxaca. 
</P>
<P>
Ole (No. 500) sells typical handwoven woolen rugs and blankets from Oaxaca, as 
well as embroidered textiles and clothing. A good quality rug the size of a 
blanket costs about $180 and up. 
</P>
<P>
Galeria Pacifico (No. 519) shows Mexican contemporary art, including 
collectible works by Montserrat Aleix, Lucia Maya, Guadalupe Sierra and Jose 
Estaban Martinez, plus the soft-cloth constructions of Rudolfo Morales and 
Alvaro Santiago's intriguing painted metallic furniture. Somewhat pricey, but 
the work is excellent. 
</P>
<P>
L. B. Martin (No. 524) offers silk-screened cotton fabrics in bolts (for about 
$8 per meter) or stitched into charming sun dresses (from $25). 
</P>
<P>
Casa Josefa (No. 533) sells clothing designer Josefa's fashions. Based on 
traditional Indian attire, Josefa's handwoven cotton caftans, dresses and 
separates are beautifully embroidered and trimmed with ribbons of contrasting 
colors. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Josefa was "discovered" by the film crew who came to shoot "Night of 
the Iguana" in Puerto Vallarta in 1963, her glorious fashions have been 
adorning the rich and famous. Prices about $250 and up per long dress or 
caftan. 
</P>
<P>
Gucci (corner of Iturbide) has fashionable shoes, handbags, golf bags, 
briefcases, wallets and other accessories. Prices are reasonable, but these are 
Mexican-made unauthorized copies or facsimiles of Gucci products. 
</P>
<P>
In the heart of El Centro, Cuale Island (in the middle of Rio Cuale) has dozens 
of outdoor selling stalls and the colorful Mercado Municipal. This is the place 
to find inexpensive handcrafts of all sorts. 
</P>
<P>
Prices quoted in this article reflect currency exchange rates at the time of 
writing.

HER WORLD: UNWRAPPING THE BEST GIFT -- TRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN, Morgan, author of California (with photographer Dewitt 
Jones), is a La Jolla travel writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Holiday gift-giving is in the air and polls show that Americans would like to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
Whether flying, driving, backpacking or cruising, Americans now list travel as 
their ultimate dream. Trips have replaced old luxuries -- diamonds, furs and 
sports cars -- as the No. 1 gift wish of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
I understand. For me, travel is an essential part of life and always has been. 
Even as a carsick child I loved the change of routine, the promise of surprise. 
Each summer my parents would pack us all into the family car in the middle of 
America and drive as far as they could in half of their vacation time. 
Inevitably, they returned home by another route. 
</P>
<P>
After reading that the wise men did much the same thing that fateful Christmas, 
I figured my parents got their travel plans from the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
They did not think small. One July it was Tulsa, Hannibal, Springfield, 
Chicago, Detroit, Niagara Falls (both the U.S. and Canadian sides), Boston, 
Salem, Newport, New York City, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Charlottesville, 
Lexington, Eureka Springs and home. 
</P>
<P>
Or, as I remember it, Mark Twain's white picket fence, Lincoln's law office, 
the windy beach by Lake Michigan, Greenfield Village with Henry Ford's cars, 
honeymoon chapels and daredevils in barrels, slices of chocolate pie in the 
windows of the Horn and Hardart's automat in Manhattan, the Rockettes, sleeping 
in a trundle bed near the Mayflower, visiting Paul Revere's church, lying awake 
with a head full of ghost stories in a timbered inn next to the House of Seven 
Gables, and sighing over a Mario Lanza movie on the same day that I saw the 
Liberty Bell and Ben Franklin's grave. 
</P>
<P>
I remember cringing as my kid sister danced around the base of the Washington 
Monument. I remember staying at a fancy hotel that had an indoor swimming pool 
that smelled just like the chlorine in the basement of the Tulsa YWCA. 
</P>
<P>
I remember celebrating my 14th birthday in the parking lot of Jefferson's 
estate at Monticello. I remember staring at the piano in Stephen Foster's old 
Kentucky home and knowing that he practiced more than I did. 
</P>
<P>
It was a summer of caves and escalators, big rivers and the Waldorf-Astoria, a 
crush on a handsome guide with a cleft chin and a pause at a Civil War 
battleground. There were lots of laughs and root beer. There were parks and 
merry-go-rounds. 
</P>
<P>
I was carsick often, but never for long. Someone suggested Mother Sills Seasick 
Pills from a corner drugstore in Missouri, but soda crackers worked best. When 
parents wonder about taking children on trips, I think of these best of times. 
</P>
<P>
Auto trips make great gifts, but there are longer and shorter holiday notions. 
</P>
<P>
From my mail it seems that a lot of readers have their hearts set on a summer 
mule trip among the High Sierra camps of Yosemite. They need to reserve space 
in December by writing to Yosemite Park and Curry Co., 5410 E. Home Ave., 
Fresno, Calif. 93727. 
</P>
<P>
Others hope that someone will take them away for a weekend at a fine city 
hotel, or a desert hideaway, or a resort by the sea. Travel gift certificates 
can be written for a week in London, a dinner in Marrakech, a round trip on the 
Concorde or camping gear from L. L. Bean. 
</P>
<P>
Small travel items make great looking stocking-stuffers: a Tekna-Lite II 
flashlight, the smallest of Swiss Army knives, a slim chain for the 
convention-going business woman who is faced with pinning another name tag onto 
a silk shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Travel videos (such as Society Expeditions' new "Project Antarctica") are 
winsome presents. Travel books are ever appealing, starting with a world atlas. 
Michelin green guides and maps add excitement to trip planning. 
</P>
<P>
The opposite of my parents' ebullient tours -- so laced with history and lore 
-- is the old keeping up with the Joneses routine, in which you try to 
duplicate a neighbor's allegedly perfect trip. These attempts can lead to world 
class disappointment. You may not have the same interests as your pals. And 
they may have glossed over the bad times. 
</P>
<P>
The only Jones I have ever tried to keep up with is a National Geographic 
photographer named Dewitt, with whom I recently collaborated on a book about 
California. That research took me to Burro Bend and Sausalito, Murphy's and 
Plantation, Lee Vining and San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Like all other trips, it made me eager for more. And now that I sit in the 
driver's seat instead of standing on my head in the back, I rarely get carsick.

NORMANDY MEMORIES STILL SHARP

<P>
We stepped off the tour bus in the square of Sainte-Mere-Eglise. It was a 
bright, sunny morning and the French countryside was peaceful and cool. 
</P>
<P>
Some of our fellow passengers lit cigarettes while others walked around, 
cameras at the ready, looking for the "picturesque" and glad for the chance to 
stretch their legs. 
</P>
<P>
"Hear anything?" 
</P>
<P>
"Just birds," Joyce said. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know why, but I had expected to hear small arms fire. Yet Joyce was 
right -- there were just birds and maybe a dog, a few hundred yards away, 
barking at a French mailman. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Some months before, when I was helping my son John put a sprinkler system in 
the front yard, he had gone across the alley and asked Dick Young to stop over 
"just to make sure we were doing everything right." 
</P>
<P>
Dick is famous around the neighborhood for knowing how to fix things and for 
his willingness to help out. He brought his shovel and pipe wrenches, "just in 
case." 
</P>
<P>
The three of us had been working for a while when the conversation got around 
to the trip Joyce and I were planning to the Normandy Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the biggest day of my life took place right where you're going," Dick 
said, leaning on his shovel. "I was at Sainte-Mere-Eglise. I don't talk about 
it much." 
</P>
<P>
This seemed to indicate he was about to. John and I sat on the edge of the 
trench. Joyce, curious about the apparent work slowdown, wandered out and sat 
down, too. 
</P>
<P>
Dick was 23 years old and newly married when the United States entered World 
War II. Figuring the Army had him for the duration and that he might as well do 
everything he could to get the war over as soon as possible, he volunteered for 
the 101st Airborne. 
</P>
<P>
His bride, Faye, wasn't crazy about the idea but it seemed to work for Dick. 
After little more than a year and 25 jumps, he was a platoon sergeant in 
Company E in the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. He was also overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The regiment was on extended training at Newberry, in southern England, when 
the word came down. It was in a personal note from Gen. Eisenhower. Everybody 
who was to be involved in the invasion got one. 
</P>
<P>
"It started out with, 'Men, you are about to take part in a great crusade. . . 
.' " Dick said. "Of course, Eisenhower was talking about the invasion. It 
really was a great crusade, you know. Nobody ever has to be ashamed of fighting 
in that war." 
</P>
<P>
"Were you in the invasion?" Joyce asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah," said Dick. "Airborne Infantry, you bet we were. We were all told 
we'd be jumping at night on the 4th of June, at least I remember it that way. 
And they also told us that for our own safety there'd be no mail, no phone 
calls and we'd all be confined to the post till we left." 
</P>
<P>
"But you didn't leave on the 4th, did you?" John asked. 
</P>
<P>
Dick shook his head. "The weather fouled us up. Almost fouled up the whole 
invasion. We didn't leave until the 6th." 
</P>
<P>
"Just before midnight the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment boarded the planes, 
C-47s they were. Shoot, it was the whole 101st Division, all 6,000 of us. We 
circled till we got our formation together and then started across the channel. 
</P>
<P>
"There'd been a lot of bad weather, the air was still bumpy and some of the 
guys weren't feeling so good. But it was a short flight. Maybe a half hour. 
</P>
<P>
"On the way over we were checking our gear and our weapons. We were each 
jumping with about 50 pounds, M1 rifle, bayonet, steel helmet, bandoleers of 
ammunition, blanket, K rations and pockets full of maybe 10 grenades. 
</P>
<P>
"Not talking much, just sitting there in the dark. Little bit of a dim light 
from up front and a red light over the door. We had a Mexican fellow who sang a 
few songs and that eased things a little." 
</P>
<P>
"Did you know the name of the place where you were going?" 
</P>
<P>
Dick told us that they all knew the name and they'd had a good briefing by good 
officers, one of whom, his captain, Robert MacDonald, was from West Point. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd said to look out for the bone yard," Dick said, "some kind of slough, 
near Sainte-Mere, running down to the ocean, where they processed animal bones 
for fertilizer or some such. They'd told us not to come down in it. We were 
thinking about things like that when we lined up and hitched up our static 
lines. There was just no time to be scared. 
</P>
<P>
"And we were jumping from 800 feet, which doesn't leave you a whole lot of time 
to worry while you're on the way to the ground, either. I tell you, when that 
door opened there was nothing else in the world but a big black hole with a lot 
of stuff coming up. Tracers . . . Lord, there were lots of different colors of 
tracer bullets and flack exploding everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"But the brightest thing was that little red light. You could hear and feel the 
wind coming in, but . . . you couldn't look away from that little red light 
over the open door. 
</P>
<P>
"And when that red light popped out and the green came on and the man said 
'Go!' we went, one after the other. Not one of the 25 jumps I'd had before was 
anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
No one spoke for a moment as Dick kicked the dirt off his shovel and shook his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you all make it?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Naw," he said, shaking his head. "All my platoon landed OK. Most of Company E, 
2nd Battalion, got down all right, but some of the 506th hit the bone yard. And 
like the 82nd and part of the British 6th Airborne up the line, we were 
scattered all to hell and gone over the French countryside. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and my bunch landed in a field, got together in a hedgerow and then, well, 
I guess you could say we went to war. Maybe 25% of our people died there in 
those little French towns and in Belgium. We even lost Capt. MacDonald, but 
come to think of it, that wasn't at Sainte-Mere-Eglise. That wasn't till the 
Rhine. 
</P>
<P>
"But that little village figured pretty big in my life at one time. I guess, 
since it's a part of me, you could say it figures pretty big in my life all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Joyce and I walked toward our tour bus. There really wasn't much to see in 
Sainte-Mere-Eglise. The village was just the square, a few shops, a church and 
the steeple. That was a landmark; there had been a paratrooper whose chute had 
fouled on that steeple. He'd hung there most of the night, watching the 
fighting and trying not to be noticed by the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
It must have worked. Either that or the enemy didn't figure a man hanging by a 
parachute from a church steeple constituted enough of a threat to shoot at. 
</P>
<P>
A few walls in Sainte-Mere-Eglise still showed the scars of battle, divots in 
the masonry from bullets fired more than 40 years before. Joyce used her long 
lens and took pictures of them in case Dick might figure he'd made some of 
those holes. 
</P>
<P>
Deter, who was our official tour guide, joined us. "Looks like just another 
beautiful little French village, doesn't it? One of thousands, eh? But the 
names -- Sainte-Mere-Eglise, Saint-Lo, Carentan, Caen. You see the marks of the 
bullets in the walls?" 
</P>
<P>
We both nodded. "The names of the places and the bullet holes, they remind us," 
Deter said, "of the battlefield this was, that almost all of France has been, 
time and time again. 
</P>
<P>
"The old song about the Allies having to come over every few years to fight 
France's wars is foolishness, eh? We come over to fight for ourselves. France 
is just the battlefield. Always the battlefield for thousands of years. Is it 
any wonder the French don't always seem to trust strangers?" 
</P>
<P>
Some time after we got back, Dick came over. "About Sainte-Mere-Eglise. You 
remember you asked me if I was scared that day and I said I wasn't. Well, I've 
been thinking back on it. How Faye and me hadn't been married that long, and 
how the invasion had been delayed and all of us had that extra time to think. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, jumping out that door into what we thought would be the whole German 
Army. Well, I got to remembering that feeling in the pit of my stomach. Yeah, I 
was scared." 
</P>
<P>
I walked with him back to his house. "I meant to go back to that village after 
the war," he said. "And when we got our final leave, some of us started that 
way from Germany but somehow we got sidetracked." 
</P>
<P>
"How so?" 
</P>
<P>
"Youth. We went to Paris, then the Riviera. Maybe someday I'll make it back to 
Sainte-Mere-Eglise. Then I'd like to go to the American Cemetery at Normandy, 
you know, to pay my respects. I got a lot of friends there." 
</P>
<P>
I believe more people should see Sainte-Mere-Eglise and the other beautiful 
little villages of Normandy and Picardy, Ardennes-Champagne and the other 
provinces. Perhaps if enough people see them at peace in the morning sun, then 
maybe we'll never let them be part of a battleground again.

BARGAIN CORNER: CONSOLIDATORS OFFER CUTS IN ROOM RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Consolidators -- companies that sell low-fare air tickets and cruises -- also 
deal with hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
One such company is Hotel Connections, established in 1985 and based in 
Petaluma, Calif. It offers discounts of $20 to $50 a night off regular room 
rates at about 70 hotels in the United States. Some of the properties are part 
of chains -- Hilton, Hyatt, Sheraton and Radisson. 
</P>
<P>
Another chain the company works with is Chatwal Inns, which has seven 
properties in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Among the cities with participating hotels are San Francisco, San Diego, 
Scottsdale, New York, Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, Denver, Orlando, Boston, 
Washington, D.C., and Las Vegas. The discounts are available all year including 
weekends, but there may be sold-out dates varying from property to property. 
</P>
<P>
Reservations are made through a toll-free number to Hotel Connections, which 
processes the information to the hotel. You get a confirmation number over the 
phone, but no written confirmation. However, Hotel Connections reconfirms your 
reservation a day before your arrival. Your initial reservation has to be made 
at least 48 hours before arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Payment must be made by credit card, with full payment required at the time of 
booking. No refunds are available for cancellations or date changes, but Hotel 
Connections will process a change of dates at no extra charge. 
</P>
<P>
You can also call Hotel Connections to have a free brochure and rate sheet sent 
to you that lists the regular rate, discount rate and amount of tax for 
properties around the nation. Sold-out dates for each hotel are also listed. 
The rates quoted are for single or double occupancy. This rate sheet is 
upgraded quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
You can also get a directory of the hotels working with Hotel Connections, 
including details about their amenities. 
</P>
<P>
There is no service charge this year, but Hotel Connections is planning to 
start such a surcharge in 1990 that will probably be in the $7-$15 range per 
transaction. The same $20-$50 range of discounts for rooms will be available 
next year, according to a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Contact Hotel Connections at 6 Petaluma Road North, Petaluma, Calif. 94952, or 
call toll-free (800) 456-1969. JACK ADLER

SOUTH ASIA: WHEN OLD HATREDS REACH THE SURFACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tad Szulc, Tad Szulc is a veteran foreign correspondent. 
</P>

NEW DELHI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Asia is in the grip of more turmoil and terror than at any time since the 
end of World War II and the start of world decolonization. Pick your worst 
strife -- ethnic, religious, social, political. All explode along the vast arch 
stretching from Afghanistan in the west to Cambodia in the east, with three 
full-fledged civil wars in progress and deepening instability within the entire 
Indian subcontinent. 
</P>
<P>
A random glance at the front-page headlines of New Delhi newspapers this month: 
"A Monster Stalks Bhagalpur" (a new wave of Hindu-Muslim communal slaughter in 
the state of Bihar); "Top Terrorist Among Five Shot In Punjab" (continuing mass 
murders involving autonomy-craving Sikhs); "45 Killed As Rival Tamil Groups 
Clash" (the bloody unabating ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka); "Pak Violence" 
(political murders in Pakistan). On and on, day after day. 
</P>
<P>
Then come stories about civil wars in Afghanistan and Cambodia, both directly 
affecting the security interests of every nation across this vast region; 
stories about the genocidal military dictatorship in Myanmar (formerly Burma); 
stories about the bitter dispute between huge India and tiny Nepal, and the 
complex and fragile relationship between India and China along their Himalayan 
frontiers. The third civil war is the ethnic bloodletting in Sri Lanka, where 
an Indian army peacekeeping force failed to keep it. 
</P>
<P>
The resurgence of ethnic and religious fury, of murderous conflict, virtually 
everywhere in the area is the most disturbing phenomenon. Nearly a half-century 
after decolonization, old hatreds reawaken in now-independent nations, taking 
sinister form. 
</P>
<P>
In India, general elections will be held this week. An estimated 490 million 
citizens (close to one-tenth of the globe's population) are eligible to vote in 
the world's largest democracy. Religious passions and ethnic pressures have 
been playing a pivotal role in the closing weeks of the campaign. Capturing 
Hindu and Muslim votes is the aim of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress 
Party and of the opposition's "national front," following October street 
battles between believers. Body counts are still uncertain; whole villages were 
razed and burned. 
</P>
<P>
Jawaharlal Nehru, Gandhi's grandfather, believed in a secular and independent 
Indian state; he thought religious tensions would give way to a happy 
Hindu-Muslim coexistence. Not so. Not now. Both political sides need the Muslim 
minority's votes to win a majority in Parliament and thereby form a government. 
</P>
<P>
There are no fundamental differences between the prime minister and opponent 
Vishwanath Pratap Singh, who once served as Gandhi's finance minister. So the 
election may hinge on the ethnic and religious vote, including the untouchables 
at the bottom of the caste system. 
</P>
<P>
Gandhi won the largest majority in Indian history in 1984 after his mother, 
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards. The 
young Gandhi's popularity later dropped as a series of rising financial 
scandals involved the government and the ruling Congress Party. When Gandhi's 
return to office became less certain, religious and ethnic strife grew. 
</P>
<P>
At home, Gandhi first had to contend with several sources of longstanding 
violence: the Sikhs in Punjab, who want their own nation, to be known as 
Khalistan; the Bodo tribesmen in the northern state of Assam, who demand 
autonomy and have unleashed a terrorist wave; the Gurkha Liberation Front, also 
demanding autonomy; the Naxalites and the Nagas in the north fighting for 
greater recognition, and tribesmen in Tripura on the northeast who demand the 
same -- claiming they have been victims of 87 political murders in just over a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The eruptions of religious unrest happened more recently, perhaps the worst 
outbreak of such conflict between Hindus and Muslims since the bloodshed that 
followed partition into Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan in 1947. At least 1,000 
people were killed in the populous northeastern state of Bihar in late October 
and early this month. 
</P>
<P>
The slaughter in the Bhagalpur district of Bihar, following a Hindu religious 
ceremony, shook the nation, especially after reports and photographs of 
villagers -- members of both faiths -- being murdered. The Hindus' holy Ganges, 
flowing past Bhagalpur, was a river of corpses. 
</P>
<P>
In Jammu and Kashmir, claimed by Pakistan since 1947, the recent religious 
battles were between Muslims and Buddhists in the Ladakh area of the high 
Himalayas. Ladakh Buddhists claimed separate status in India, and this claim, 
too, has become an election issue. Bombs killed several Kashmirians early in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
In Sri Lanka, "the whole society has collapsed," said a senior Indian official. 
The once-peaceful island nation now suffers a whole series of fratricidal wars 
along its shores: the Sinhalese ethnic majority versus the Tamil minority; two 
opposing Tamil rebel armies; a Sinhalese People's Liberation Front fighting the 
national government; the Sri Lankan national army battling all the rebel 
movements, and Tamils fighting Sri Lankan Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
The Indian peacekeeping force lost more than 1,100 men before beginning a 
phased withdrawal to be completed on Dec. 31. Sri Lanka is an Indian election 
problem because resident Indian Tamils blame Gandhi for mishandling the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
In Nepal, King Birendra and his advisers hope for Gandhi's defeat because the 
Indian government imposed a virtual economic blockade on the Himalayan kingdom 
last spring, after the Nepalese refused to renegotiate 40-year-old trade and 
border transit treaties. What irks India most, however, is that Nepal purchased 
anti-aircraft artillery from China last year after letting the Chinese build a 
road from Tibet to the Nepalese border. India lost a frontier war with China in 
1962; it sees Nepal's moves as a threat to Indian security and now treats the 
Nepalese as virtual enemies. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows exactly why Nepal would need Chinese anti-aircraft guns but they 
do know the guns further destabilize South Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh and Pakistan seem to be permanent trouble spots. In Bangladesh 
(named East Pakistan until the 1971 Indian-Pakistani war), the opposition is 
trying to bring down the military government through successive strikes; 50 
people were injured during a violentlabor clash earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto barely survived a no-confidence vote 
in Parliament; her democratic regime remains in danger and 11 people were 
killed in political clashes in southern Pakistan during the first days of 
November. 
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan have fought four wars since the 1950s. Their mutual 
hostility persists. 
</P>
<P>
Both are considered to have nuclear capabilities. Currently, India blames 
Pakistan for fueling the continuing civil war in Afghanistan, through the 
delivery of arms to fundamentalist Muslim guerrillas fighting the Moscow-backed 
Kabul regime. 
</P>
<P>
Resumption of civil war in Cambodia is another chapter in a modern history of 
massacre; more than 2 million Cambodians were murdered by the victorious Khmer 
Rouge in the mid-'70s. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the tragedy of Myanmar, where the army destroyed the democracy 
movement last year and imposed what may be the world's most repressive regime, 
featuring mass imprisonment and routine torture. 
</P>
<P>
While Europe rips down the old barriers, South Asia rebuilds them -- and even 
erects some new ones.

'WEDGE ISSUE' THAT PIERCES GOP'S HEART; 
</P>
<P>
ABORTION:THE GOP IS TRYING TO ADJUST ITS POLICY AS ITS 'PRINCIPLED' IDEOLOGICAL 
STAND NOW BECOMES A POLITICAL LIABILITY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater, it must have been like 
waking up on a bright sunny morning in his native South Carolina, looking out 
the window and finding 16 inches of snow on the ground. Nov. 8, 1989, was that 
kind of day. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican Party had endured mini-slaughter at the polls. Democratic Lt. 
Gov. L. Douglas Wilder was the newly elected governor of Virginia. Although the 
margin of victory was razor-thin, in the world according to Atwater, the fact 
that Wilder, a black man, had won meant something fundamental had shifted in 
American politics. 
</P>
<P>
In the "real" world, it was axiomatic that no state would elect a black 
governor. In 1982, amid the worst recession since the Great Depression, 
California voters had backed off at the last moment and elected white 
Republican George Deukmejian over black Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley. 
"Realists" knew that in a generic Virginia gubernatorial election, Wilder would 
receive 45% of the vote. He was attractive and enormously skillful. But he was 
black, liberal and had supported many tax increases over the years. In other 
words, he was, at best, a 45-percenter. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, on Election Day, Wilder defeated GOP stalwart J. Marshall Coleman by 7,000 
votes (subject to recount). Even more astonishing was Wilder's vote total -- 
roughly 900,000. That was 140,000 more votes than Charles S. Robb received when 
he defeated Coleman in 1981, 160,000 more than incumbent Gov. Gerald L. Baliles 
pulled when he won in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion was the difference. You only had to look at the returns from Fairfax, 
Chesterfield and Henrico counties -- George Bush country to the core -- to know 
that abortion was now a voting issue for white suburbanites. The Supreme 
Court's decision giving states the option of imposing new restrictions on 
abortion (Webster vs. State of Missouri) radically altered the political 
terrain. When the Wilder campaigners worked the final spending percentages, 
they found that nearly 40% of their media budget had been devoted to getting 
the word out that their man was pro-choice and that Coleman was not. 
</P>
<P>
Webster made abortion a voting issue for the white middle class and energized a 
previously complacent grass-roots organizations. If Democrats learn the lessons 
of Virginia, the abortion issue could haunt the GOP for years. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Webster decision, "social issues" seemed to be the sole province of 
the Republican Party, particularly on the national level. The reaction to the 
civil-rights movement, cultural liberalism and the Vietnam War had virtually 
destroyed the Democratic Party in presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, President Nixon's team had a quick summary of Sen. George S. 
McGovern's candidacy that seemed to capture the televised chaos of the 
Democratic Party and its national convention that year. McGovern was the 
"3-A's" candidate -- "acid, amnesty and abortion." The Nixonites drove that 
theme hard with white Catholics in the North and white Protestants in the South 
on the way to the largest Republican landslide in American history. 
</P>
<P>
It was the culmination of the grand Nixon plan -- the so-called Southern 
Strategy -- to drain the Democratic Party of white middle-class voters and thus 
deny it national political legitimacy for a generation. It worked, with one 
unhappy intermission -- when a "born-again" Christian from Georgia went to 
Washington -- and Republicans have controlled White House access ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater had his own spin on "social" issues -- he called them "wedge issues." 
His idea was to find the wedge issue that sharply divides the opposition, and 
drive it home. The wedge issues of 1968, 1972, 1980, 1984 and 1988 were race, 
cultural liberalism, patriotism, abortion, anti-communism and Big Government. 
Abortion is still a wedge issue, but post-Webster, it will more likely divide 
Republicans than Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Roe vs. Wade allowed Republican (and some Democratic) politicians to have it 
both ways. They could enlist anti-abortion constituencies with hard-line 
support of "pro-life" demands without fear of having to deliver on any promises 
made. White suburbanites, the GOP's core constituency, didn't care, really, if 
public funding for lower-income women was limited or eliminated here or there. 
They could still afford an abortion, and their right to the procedure was 
constitutionally protected. 
</P>
<P>
As the pro-life movement gathered strength within the Republican Party, its 
language was adopted into party dogma. By the end of the 1988 Republican 
National Convention in New Orleans, the GOP platform read: "That the unborn 
child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed. We therefore 
reaffirm our support for a human life amendment to the Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
That GOP endorsement nearly ruined Bush's performance in last year's 
presidential debate in Winston-Salem. Stumbling on his answer about how the 
"crime" of abortion would be punished, he said he hadn't "sorted out the 
penalties." Campaign Chairman James A. Baker III was quickly dispatched the 
next morning to "clarify" Bush's remarks. But the issue lacked traction with 
the press and with the voters, and it quickly disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
The abortion issue didn't disappear in Virginia. Wilder introduced it early and 
stuck with it right up to Election Day, positioning himself exactly with the 
majority and defining the terms of the debate. Coleman vacillated. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater's postgame analysis: "Don't let your opponent define your position on 
abortion, and be clear, don't vacillate. The Democrats did a skillful job of 
defining our candidates as extremists on the abortion issue." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, of course, is that the Republican position, clearly stated, is out 
of the mainstream of white middle-class views on the subject. They don't want 
abortion to be illegal, period. 
</P>
<P>
Alienating these voters is the definition of political stupidity. No one ever 
accused the GOP of being dumb, so immediately the repositioning began. Before 
the votes were counted, Bush held an Election Day press conference. "I think 
everyone knows that this is an issue that divides," he said. "Is it the most 
important issue for me? Absolutely not." 
</P>
<P>
Next came the "big tent" proclamation, which went something like: "The 
Republican Party is big enough for both points of view, it's a big tent." Sen. 
Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) was more direct, telling reporters, "We deserve to lose 
on (abortion) if we have the position that we've had in the past . . . I would 
hope some of these elections might bring us to our senses." 
</P>
<P>
That will be a delicate political task for Republicans. Watching them 
reposition themselves on the abortion issue will be a key party constituency: 
right-to-lifers. Bush has made it clear that he will not change his 
anti-abortion stance. With Democrats firmly in control of both houses of 
Congress, he may be able politically to maintain it. 
</P>
<P>
Other Republicans, particularly those running for executive offices, don't have 
that benefit. They will find themselves in the cross-fire of Republican 
abortion politics: They win party primaries with the support of the 
right-to-life movement, and that positioning will put them at odds with white 
middle-class pro-choicers. 
</P>
<P>
That is why 1990 may bring the GOP equivalent of perestroika on abortion. 
Principled positions on issues are well and good, but winning elections is 
Atwater's job.

A U.S. SCIENTIST FINDS GLASNOST IN BOONDOCKS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: AMERICAN ECOLOGISTS JOIN SOVIETS IN THE OKA BIOSPHERE RESERVE, TO 
MEASURE NATURAL SPECIES AND EXPLORE HUMAN GLOBAL CONCERNS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Among the many tales of glasnost is one about four U.S. and 17 Soviet 
scientists doing three weeks of old-fashioned biological fieldwork in the 
Russian backwoods. It's a story set amid mud and mosquitoes, the clash of 
American versus European ecological thinking and the gratifying discovery that 
the joy of working with nature -- the passion for saving it from humankind's 
toxic foolhardiness -- is a cultural common ground perhaps more potent than 
nationality. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, this was Project 02.05-41: Biosphere Reserves. For 15 years, the 
two governments have been signatories to an agreement promoting mutual 
development of environmental monitoring and protection schemes in their 
respective nature preserves. Like many -- maybe most -- such international 
agreements, "progress" had been marked by alternate visits of officials -- 
tours, toasts and occasionally productive conversation. The fortunes of working 
scientists on both sides rose and fell with the political climate. These days 
that climate, like the meteorological one, is warming markedly. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, meeting first in Idaho Falls and continuing in the River of No Return 
Wilderness, we finally found the political and scientific common ground to work 
together. There would be joint work on monitoring -- specifically to track and 
measure pollutants in air and water. That is a relatively straightforward 
business where Americans have held the high ground in science and technology. 
And we would seek standards for describing and monitoring "biological 
diversity." This 1980s catch phrase for the extinction of species and the loss 
of whole ecosystems goes to the heart of the science of ecology. It is an arena 
where European -- and Russian -- ecologists have marched to different tempos 
than Americans, and one where the Soviets are far better apprised of our work 
than we of theirs. 
</P>
<P>
But before we embark on our scientific expedition to the Oka Biosphere Reserve, 
a digression: For two decades, the U.N.'s Man and the Biosphere program has 
attempted to foster more harmonious relations between people and the natural 
world. Its International Biosphere Reserve designation seeks to link fully 
protected "core" areas with adjacent lands where agriculture, forestry or 
grazing may be taking place. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of biosphere reserves was intended to cover the spectrum of 
ecosystems planetwide, from tundra to tropical rain forest -- although politics 
has had a certain moderating effect on the character of the network. Ecological 
lessons learned in core areas are to be applied to improve management in 
occupied terrain, as well as to provide a protective buffer for natural areas. 
Some of the world's finest natural preserves have been designated Biosphere 
Reserves and, within them, a great proportion of global effort toward 
conservation has been focused. 
</P>
<P>
In America, most of the dedicated reserves have been national parks. With a few 
notable exceptions, such as southern Appalachia, little effort has been made to 
reach beyond the core parks to surrounding buffer areas. And only quite 
recently has the biosphere designation produced much more in the parks than a 
brass plaque. The difficulty stems from the very character of U.S. national 
parks. The National Park Service Act of 1916 was a mandate "to conserve the 
scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to 
provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will 
leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations." Nature lovers 
soon learned that providing enjoyment and leaving resources unimpaired is an 
oxymoron. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has largely avoided this problem because "parks" are designed 
for recreation, although typically in rustic surroundings. A special nature 
reserve designation, zapovednik, was established more than 50 years ago; these 
are entirely closed and protected except for approved scientific investigation. 
Most Biosphere Reserves in the Soviet Union are zapovedniks. In the United 
States, the reserve designation has most often been bestowed upon relatively 
unmodified "wilderness" parks that form the "crown jewels" of our system, where 
we have been able to imagine that "wild nature" still functions. In the Soviet 
Union, nearly all landscapes have been occupied, modified and remodified by 
people for centuries -- "wilderness" is a peculiarly American abstraction. 
</P>
<P>
For our late summer joint expedition, the Russian hosts selected the Oka 
Biosphere Reserve, a half-day drive south of Moscow. Oka occupies meager land 
of marginal value. Once farmed, once timbered, it is now densely forested with 
birch, pine and oak. Every spring, two rivers swell in this plain, flooding the 
reserve. By late summer, only boggy ground betrays a seasonally underwater 
existence. This biological island supports moose, wolves, beaver and the 
desman, a rare giant aquatic insectivore. This zapovednik, closed to tourism, 
is linked to a surrounding agricultural buffer zone; much of the research and 
monitoring is intended to improve stewardship of the entire region. 
</P>
<P>
The sociology of our Russian colleagues bore some curious parallels to my own 
experience as a park scientist. The lead scientists work for the Institute of 
Evolutionary Morphology and Animal Ecology, a division of the Soviet Academy of 
Science in Moscow: city folks. Joining us at Oka were some of the reserve's 
biologists: country folks. One group had the connections, the other the study 
site. They worked well together, but I was reminded of similar competition at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
We soon developed a routine. By day: collect data on the species present in 
different plant communities, on forest structure, on soil and moisture 
characteristics. By evening: confront our profound differences in scientific 
education and perspective. Just what are the important ecological parameters 
that can be measured and compared in Oka, in the Smoky Mountains, the rain 
forest? What is "biological diversity" anyhow? 
</P>
<P>
The Russians -- senior scientists and graduate students alike -- read and 
understand some English. We Americans are hopeless in Russian. Translating 
abstruse ecological theory back and forth is time-consuming and wearying, 
particularly after a full day. Sometimes we got crabby. American scientists are 
accustomed to spirited questioning. Russians are not. I occasionally detected a 
look somewhere between shock and illicit glee in the eyes of young Russian 
biologists when we scrimmaged with their elders. But an overriding concern that 
we must succeed, that our two nations must mutually address pressing 
environmental problems, drove us to learn from one another and to adopt the 
best points of both perspectives. So we did. 
</P>
<P>
Even though we were deep in the boondocks, the sensation of a society in abrupt 
transition was pervasive. Our hosts were utterly candid in discussing Soviet 
politics and social problems. No one cared what I looked at or photographed. 
There was a kind of national self-loathing among the Russians, sad and 
troubling. I remember one intense argument over whether the awful condition of 
Russian highways was a consequence of the communist government or intrinsic to 
the Russian character. The terrible bind of a highly sophisticated culture with 
a paralyzed economy -- no money for tools or toys -- is profoundly frustrating. 
Moscow is a most polluted city, as the Russians are painfully aware. Yet every 
ruble spend on abatement is lost to investment in production. 
</P>
<P>
A final note. One evening some younger Russians said that they found us 
Americans -- in contrast to Europeans -- quite like them in personality, in 
social style. We Americans saw that same similarity. But not until I had been 
back for a few weeks did I figure out what that commonality was. The Soviets, 
like us, are fundamentally egalitarian. Their revolution also banished 
inherited rank or privilege and championed equality. It hadn't taken them any 
time at all to get the hang of free speech. We scientists know there is little 
time to make some serious changes in planetary management. Now we know we can 
work together, sharing some burdens -- and some knowledge.

TO OUR HEALTH: THREE PLANS FOR BETTER U.S. CARE

The time for expanded U.S. health insurance has come -- and gone -- more than 
once in this country's recent history. Yet the last decade of this century may 
at last see all Americans obtaining the kind of universal coverage that 
citizens of other countries have enjoyed for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Support for the idea of universal care goes back many years. Even the American 
Medical Assn., which torpedoed President Harry S. Truman's 1949 national 
health-insurance plan by labeling it "socialized medicine," saw virtue in it, 
briefly, before World War I. There were other efforts, but pressures for 
universal coverage eased following the adoption of Medicare and Medicaid in 
1965. 
</P>
<P>
Now private corporations and public opinion both demand major change, and the 
Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care is developing 
recommendations for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
What needs to be done? 
</P>
<P>
Our top priority should be better access to care for the uninsured, who may 
number as many as 37 million. 
</P>
<P>
One of the leading current proposals, and the best of many market-oriented 
schemes, is the Consumer-Choice Health Plan by Alain C. Enthoven and Richard 
Kronick of the Stanford University School of Business. Its core idea involves 
organizational "sponsors," both private employers and public agencies that 
would be set up by state governments. Sponsors would contract with health-plan 
providers -- mostly health maintenance organizations (HMOs) -- to offer a range 
of coverages at varying prices. Sponsors would pay 80% of the cost. Consumers 
could choose the plan that best matched their needs and would pay the remaining 
20% for coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Building on the existing employment-based system, Enthoven-Kronick would 
require that all employers cover full-time employees and pay an 8% payroll tax 
on the earnings of uncovered employees. The tax would help subsidize 
health-care costs for those with incomes below 150% of the poverty line. For 
people below the poverty line, the subsidy would be complete: no premium. 
</P>
<P>
With the subsidies, Enthoven and Kronick expect to achieve nearly universal 
coverage. They claim a strong cost-control component for their program because 
there would be price competition among provider plans. 
</P>
<P>
But every panacea has problems. The emphasis on stimulating market competition 
also stimulates, as the authors acknowledge, competitive strategies "that could 
destroy efficiency and fairness" in pursuit of profits and position. Continuous 
monitoring would be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Asking employer sponsors to monitor their own plans forces private businesses 
to make sophisticated judgments, medical and financial, on details of health 
care. Not many firms are able to become health managers on such a scale. State 
sponsors would face the same problem. 
</P>
<P>
The assumption that competing plans will be available in sparsely populated or 
poor areas is quite dubious. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, many physicians are not likely to appreciate the possibility that 
large prepaid group practices could end up as the successful competitors. 
Available evidence also suggests that patients given a real choice display no 
great love for HMOs, except in the few parts of the country where 
long-established institutions of high repute exist. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the Consumer-Choice plan may be an economist's theoretical dream but 
it could be a nightmare, in practice, for patients, doctors and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians for a National Health Program, an organization of 400 doctors, 
offers a much different plan -- a universal program, nationally funded but 
state operated. Based on a program in Canada, private insurance would not be 
allowed for coverage duplicating the public plan. Each hospital would receive a 
"global budget" -- a fixed sum -- for the year, negotiated in each state. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents expect that, in the long run, funding for the program would come 
from a progressive national income tax. But for a transition period, a mix of 
national and local, public and private sources would finance the demonstration. 
As an eventual ideal, this proposal has much promise, since the Canadian system 
offers advantages in availability and cost. As a practical matter, within a 
time span that might help people currently uninsured, it is a dubious 
proposition. 
</P>
<P>
A President and Congress, reading the public mood after the demise of the 1988 
catastrophic-care law, is unlikely to adopt universal health insurance all at 
once. 
</P>
<P>
The political problems of interest-group accommodation would also be enormous 
in the physicians' plan. Canada is ideologically more open to public-sector 
initiatives than the United States. The proposal acknowledges that elimination 
of private insurance plans would be "politically thorny," but claims it is 
"within the prerogative" of Congress. Legal prerogative is not the issue; 
political strength is, and the insurance industry has plenty of that. 
</P>
<P>
The most practical approach, one that might stand a chance of legislative 
approval in a time of stringent budgeting, is a middle way -- building on the 
employment-based tradition and gradually adding a federal-state public program 
for those uncovered in any other way. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) has 
pushed a bill through the Senate Labor Committee that uses this approach. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's basic health benefits bill, S 788, requires employer-provided 
coverage for all full-time employees and dependents, but with financial aid for 
small businesses. For the uninsured, it would establish an income-related 
program phased in over the '90s, with those below the poverty line getting 
immediate coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Private employment would remain the core factor; we would not have to fight the 
battle of "socialized medicine" again. It would also ensure basic coverage for 
all persons in poverty, thus getting away from the complex categorical 
restrictions of Medicaid and Medi-Cal. And by requiring sliding-scale premiums, 
it would embody reasonable self-responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's proposal also has a political leg up: the American Hospital Assn. 
supports it and it fits the AMA's conditional approval of employer-mandating. 
</P>
<P>
A major disadvantage is that it would take a decade to reach all of the 
uninsured. But the phase-in pattern allows for incremental improvements along 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
The Kennedy proposal would also complicate an already fragmented U.S. system, 
adding a new public program to Medicare and Medicaid. We need to meld those two 
existing programs, while making the new coverages an incremental extension of a 
unified public-sector health insurance system. 
</P>
<P>
That could make the 1990s the decade in which the right to health care becomes 
a political reality.

COLD WAR: WE HAVE BEEN PORTRAYED AS INEPT DIPLOMATS, ROGUES, IMPERIALISTS, BUT

<P>
For more than 40 years the United States has waged the Cold War, despite 
ceaseless deprecation from many who benefited from American sacrifices without 
ever pausing to say thanks. 
</P>
<P>
Sophisticated Europeans such as Gen. Charles de Gaulle made us out to be 
reckless one minute and faithless the next. Through the decades we have been 
portrayed as inept diplomats, trigger-happy rogues, imperialists and, in the 
1980s, cowboys -- Hollywood cowboys, not even real cowboys! Now Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl of West Germany has expressed his gratitude, a wondrously 
appropriate sentiment. We who may now enjoy the benefits of peace should be 
grateful to many veterans of the Cold War, many of whom were Europeans and even 
Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
There are the writers who braved abuse and poverty by exposing the brutal 
nature of communism. When Malcolm Muggeridge returned to Britain from Russia in 
the 1930s to refute such celebrated defenders of Stalin as the playwright 
George Bernard Shaw, Muggeridge lost his job, leaving his wife and four 
children on hard times. 
</P>
<P>
George Orwell was not accorded a much friendlier reception for blowing the 
whistle on the communists in the Spanish Civil War and for satirizing communist 
totalitarianism. Let us also express thanks to Arthur Koestler, whose "Darkness 
at Noon" exposed Stalin's show trials, and to Whittaker Chambers, who in 
"Witness" exposed communism's versatile evil and who died in despair for the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
And let us give thanks for the Cold Warriors themselves, beginning with Winston 
Churchill, who had the grit to notify the world in his March 5, 1946, speech in 
Fulton, Mo., of the Iron Curtain drawn across Europe and of the dangers ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Let us be grateful for America's greatest secretary of state, Dean Acheson, 
whose diplomatic career was crucial to the establishment of the Truman 
Doctrine, Point Four, the Marshall Plan, NATO, the end of the Berlin air lift 
and the pursuit of the Korean War. Let us be grateful for Presidents Harry 
Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, who kept the United States on an 
internationalist course. The academic treatise of George Kennan gave the United 
States a scheme for pursuing the East-West conflict, namely: "containment." And 
a remarkable collection of American diplomats implemented the policy. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years every President, from John F. Kennedy to Richard Nixon, paid 
an onerous price for waging the Cold War. In the 1980s Ronald Reagan faced the 
renewed challenge of Leonid Brezhnev and his successors and demonstrated that 
an arms race is a race the United States could and would win. If there was one 
politician who brought the Cold War to an end, it was Reagan. And if there was 
one writer to rouse the West to a final awareness of the horrors behind the 
Iron Curtain, it was Alexander Solzhenitsyn, whose pitiless "One Day in the 
Life of Ivan Denisovich" began the tolling of the bell on Marxism. 
</P>
<P>
But of course no one person can be cited for bringing to an end so epic a 
conflict. Millions deserve gratitude. For instance: the voters who supported 
the aforementioned leaders and paid the bills; the intelligence agents and 
military personnel; the dissidents behind the Iron Curtain countries, many 
still incarcerated; and even the Communist leaders who now seem to realize that 
their opposites in the West only want peace and prosperity for all.

THE HEAVY-HANDED BISHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the confusions to which hierarchical institutions are particularly prone 
is the inability to distinguish between authority and authoritarianism. The 
heavy-handed intervention by San Diego's Roman Catholic Bishop, Leo T. Maher, 
in the campaign for a vacant state Senate seat is an ample demonstration of 
such confusion -- and of its unwelcome consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Maher banned Democratic Assemblywoman Lucy Killea, a 67-year-old 
practicing Catholic, from receiving Communion because she holds a pro-choice 
position on abortion. The prohibition will remain in force, the prelate said in 
a letter to the lawmaker, until she recants her views. They are the same views 
she has held and voted during four terms in the Legislature. Maher decided to 
punish Killea at this particular moment because she is contesting a pivotal 
election in which abortion has become an issue. Her opponent, Republican 
Assemblywoman Carol Bentley believes in abortion only in cases of rape, incest 
or when the mother's life is endangered. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is the vacant 39th District seat, which will be filled in a special 
election Dec. 5. The outcome is more than usually important because the 
40-member state Senate is at present evenly split on abortion. A victory by 
Killea would give proponents of choice a 21-19 majority. Pro-choice lawmakers 
already constitute a majority in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Though Maher characterized his action as "more pastoral than political," his 
larger intent was betrayed when he told The Times that "I doubt that Lucy 
Killea will get many Catholic votes." 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, is a matter for Roman Catholics -- and, for that matter, all 
the other voters in the district -- to decide in the privacy of the polls. It 
is not something that can or should be ordered from the pulpit, and that is 
precisely what is so thoroughly objectionable and improper about the bishop's 
attempt to intimidate Killea. 
</P>
<P>
The genius of America's pluralistic system is that it makes possible the 
assertion of all manner of moral values by giving official precedence to none. 
Societies in which lawmakers fail to exercise their moral consciences are vile 
places. But so, too, are societies in which conscience is nothing more than an 
expression of sectarian conformity. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Maher is not alone in his failure to respect this distinction. In his 
letter to Killea, he quoted an admonishment recently adopted by the National 
Conference of Catholic Bishops: "No Catholic," it said, "can responsibly take a 
'pro-choice' position." 
</P>
<P>
Some doubtless will use Maher's application of this unfortunate declaration to 
dredge up the hoary old Nativist slanders about Popish conspiracies and dual 
loyalties. Today, however, American Catholics are too numerous and prominent, 
too intimately involved in the broad defense of fundamental human rights for 
others to put stock in these ancient calumnies. It is, in some sense, a measure 
of the church's security and acceptance here that the bishops felt free to 
indulge their pique in this fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many will wonder why a lone woman was singled out for this chillingly 
harsh censure, when such leading male Catholics as Senators Edward M. Kennedy 
and Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo also are professed 
adherents of the pro-choice position.

Let's tell it like it really is. The insurance rate conundrum in California 
would not require Prop. 103 or any other type of voter revolt if our 
legislators would simply require the DMV to "tie" vehicle registration to proof 
of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
If the DMV can track a smog check and require proof of the check before issuing 
a car registration, certainly the same can be done for proof of insurance. This 
would take all of those uninsured motorists off the road and would curb the 
losses to the insurance carriers which, in turn, would lower our premiums.

Rosenfield brings us up to date on the battle. Perhaps we consumers have 
allowed the revolution to dwindle to a rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
All the good citizens who drive carefully, carry enough insurance and sigh 
resignedly when the premium arrives need to remind lawmakers of some economic 
facts. 
</P>
<P>
First, some prominent economists (James Flanigan, Business section, Aug. 16) 
write that legal, medical and insurance costs are current leading factors in 
inflation. Even the Labor Department admits the cost of auto insurance is 
rising faster than the price of cars. 
</P>
<P>
Second, law, medicine and insurance all get involved in accident fraud. 
Basically, this is the fault of consumers and a sign of our greedy times. 
</P>
<P>
Third, Californians have got to face the fact that we are tailgated, sideswiped 
and hit and run over by uninsured drivers. (The uninsured driver law was a joke 
in terms of enforcing insurance.) Let's get practical with something like 
everybody, regardless of age, pays a basic insurance fee in order to obtain or 
renew a driver's license. This fund could be handled by the insurance industry. 
Drivers with equity in a home/business, etc., would continue additional private 
coverage, of course. 
</P>
<P>
We need a simple, equitable insurance plan. Perhaps, if every licensed driver 
feels the pinch, he will be more responsible behind the wheel.

Socialist solutions to economic problems don't work. They never have and they 
never will. And yet, Rosenfield is recommending a socialist "solution" to the 
economic problem of auto insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Without questioning the wisdom of copying the economic solutions of a country 
whose economy is heading south compared to ours, let's look at the state-run 
Insurance Corp. of British Columbia (ICBC). 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield says that for every dollar paid in, the ICBC pays out a dollar in 
claims. That is not true. In 1988, 92 cents was paid out. That is still pretty 
good, but there is a reason for it: a surplus of over $2 billion which 
generates investment income that helps to pay claims. In 1988 the ICBC took in 
$1 billion in premiums. This means it has a surplus-to-premium ratio of 2-to-1. 
This is six times greater than the California Department of Insurance believes 
is sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield says that rates are cheaper in British Columbia than in California. 
Well, they are also cheaper in 47 other states -- none of which has a state-run 
system. There are many factors involved in insurance rates -- such as 
population density, tort laws and crime rates. These factors vary from state to 
state, and even more so from country to country. A more useful comparison would 
be to compare ICBC's rates to those of its neighbor Alberta. British Columbia's 
rates are higher. By the way, Alberta does not have a state-run system like 
ICBC. It has a private sector insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
But again, the many variables involved make comparisons suspect. So let's look 
at ICBC's system strictly by itself. In the past three years its rates have 
risen 35%. Now there is a useful comparison! It says that whatever ICBC is 
doing, it is not keeping the rates down. Despite the ICBC efforts to manage 
claim costs by "aggressively promoting safe driving, negotiating reduced auto 
repair rates and health care charges and really going after fraud" it is unable 
to provide relief from rising auto insurance rates. Some solution.

Rosenfield stated that in British Columbia for every dollar consumers pay in 
for premiums, their insurance company pays a full dollar back in claims. 
Further, he states that investment income covers all expenses and overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Wonderment and puzzlement: How do you achieve investment income to provide for 
salaries and other overhead if every dollar received is paid back in claims? 
</P>
<P>
If what Harvey says is true in British Columbia, he should be puzzled as to how 
B.C. pays salaries and other overhead if it is treated as above. Guess who 
would pay -- the taxpayer in the form of premiums and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Harvey, keep it up for a socialized insurance system and we can all go to 
Department of Motor Vehicles for prompt service.

UNFIT CONDITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Someone once calculated that by the time a typical American child reaches the 
age of 18 he will have spent more hours sitting in front of a television set 
than sitting in a classroom. It shows. Employers increasingly complain about 
the near-illiteracy and lack of usable skills of many young people entering the 
job market; tests reveal how ignorant even many college students are about 
basic history, geography and the language they speak. Now comes further 
evidence that children are not only neglecting to exercise their minds but 
apparently aren't bothering to exercise their bodies, either. Physical fitness 
tests administered to nearly 800,000 fifth-, seventh- and ninth-graders in 
California found disturbingly low levels of performance throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
The widespread inability to meet minimum flexibility, muscular and endurance 
standards continues a trend among young Americans first noted -- and deplored 
-- more than a generation ago. For all the talk in recent years about the 
health benefits of adequate exercise, California's children, who are probably 
representative of the nation as a whole, clearly aren't getting enough. 
</P>
<P>
What's wrong with being sedentary at the age of 11 or 13 or 15? What's wrong is 
that theinclinations of childhood all too readily become the habits of 
adulthood. Research by Dr. William Dietz, director of clinical nutrition at New 
England Medical Center Hospitals, has shown a clear correlation between TV 
watching by kids and obesity; the more time a child spends staring at the tube, 
the chubbier he is likely to be. An out-of-shape 13-year-old is far more likely 
than his fit counterpart to grow into an out-of-shape and ailing 33-year-old, 
with worse to come as the sedentary years roll on. A study of 6,000 men done at 
Auburn University in Alabama found that those who watched TV more than three 
hours a day were twice as likely to be significantly overweight -- and so more 
vulnerable to major illness -- than those who watched less than one hour a day. 
</P>
<P>
This year's California test scores provide a basis of comparison for coming 
years. They also strongly support findings by the President's Council on 
Physical Fitness and the Amateur Athletic Union that fitness among young 
Americans is on the decline. Obviously school districts ought to be doing more 
to promote physical education. Just as obviously, parents should start 
encouraging their children to engage in physical activities more strenuous than 
changing channels on the TV set.

ALL THEY NEED TO DO IS CATCH THE BUG; 
</P>
<P>
DEMOCRACY: NO PLACE IS REALLY IMMUNE, AND IT DOESN'T TAKE YEARS OF GRADUAL 
EXPOSURE TO TRANSFORM THE BODY POLITIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MUELLER, John Mueller, a professor of political science at the 
University of Rochester, is the author of Retreat from Doomsday: The 
Obsolescence of Major War (Basic Books, 1989). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1975, the usually ebullient Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then America's envoy to 
the United Nations, was downright pessimistic about the prospects for democracy 
in the world. It "has simply no relevance to the future," he proclaimed. He 
called it "a holdover form of government," one that manages to persist only in 
"isolated or peculiar places here and there." 
</P>
<P>
As if in conspiracy to embarrass Moynihan -- or to cheer him up -- the 
countries of the world have been on something of a democratic binge ever since. 
There have been setbacks in a few places. But for the most part, democracy has 
become all the rage as its two chief rivals -- inflexible right-wing 
authoritarianism and ideology-bound Communist dictatorship -- descend into 
disrepute. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly remarkable has been the ease with which many countries have 
adopted a form of government that has often been considered to be complicated, 
delicate and difficult. For centuries, political thinkers have been 
philosophizing about the "prerequisites" or "preconditions" that are necessary 
for democracy to flower. They often conclude that economic development and the 
gradual emergence of a democratic tradition are required, and that people must 
become comparatively responsible, selfless and informed. 
</P>
<P>
Recent history suggests, however, that about all a country needs to become 
democratic is the more or less general desire to do so. A democratic 
revolution, it now appears, is often quite easy to manage -- it requires 
neither special preparation nor notable improvement in human nature or 
capacities. 
</P>
<P>
This might have been evident in the immediate aftermath of World War II when 
totalitarian Germany, Japan, Italy and Austria became democracies. Democracy 
was forced upon them, of course, but they took to it very well despite little 
democratic tradition, particularly in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The current rage for democracy, however, seems to have been born in 1975 (even 
as Moynihan spoke) when Portugal and Spain, both economically backward 
countries with virtually no democratic preparation or tradition, became 
democracies almost overnight and almost entirely without bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
Since that time almost all new states (mainly in the Caribbean, but also in 
such unlikely places as Papua New Guinea) have adopted democracy with 
remarkably little apparent effort. In Latin America, it is the military 
dictatorship that has proven to be the form of government in decline. In 
country after country, military leaders have relinquished control in large part 
because they felt embarrassed that their countries were so out of fashion. If 
present trends continue, Paraguay -- once one of the most entrenched and 
unyielding dictatorships in the world -- will soon become a democracy under the 
guidance of a general who used to be a chief pillar of the authoritarian 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
The remarkably rapid recent progress toward democracy in the Soviet Bloc -- 
particularly in Poland and Hungary -- has often been attributed to the Western 
orientation of those countries. The democracy movement in China was undoubtedly 
similarly affected by increased knowledge of Western ways. But calls for 
democracy have also burgeoned in Myanmar (formerly Burma) -- one of the poorest 
and most isolated countries in the world. 
</P>
<P>
All this suggests that there is no reason to anticipate that the next 
democracies must necessarily emerge in countries that have been preparing for 
it for decades, like Turkey. Rather, any place -- Albania, Iraq, Zaire, Iraq, 
Romania, the Soviet Union -- can quite easily become a democracy. All they need 
is to catch the bug. 
</P>
<P>
Fans of democracy can take cheer from all this, but they are also entitled to 
wonder whether these developments present a firm trend or merely a fad. Some of 
those demanding democracy -- as in China, Burma, and South Korea -- may see it 
merely as an expedient gimmick to remove current leaders from office. 
</P>
<P>
And others find appeal in democracy because they simplistically associate it 
with prosperity. But while prosperity and democracy seem to have gone 
hand-in-hand in the developed Western world, prosperity has certainly not 
accompanied democracy in India or the Philippines, and some may eventually be 
led to notice that the present prosperity of South Korea and Taiwan was largely 
achieved under authoritarian regimes. 
</P>
<P>
There may well be setbacks for democracy, then, but the long-range prospects 
look rather good. After all, in 1789 there were only two democracies in the 
world -- Switzerland and the United States. By 1975, as Moynihan might have 
noticed, democracy had firmly taken root not merely "in isolated or peculiar 
places here and there," but in most of the major countries of the world. In 
that sense, democracy has been on a tear not merely for 15 years, but for 200. 
It's hard to dismiss that as a fad.

WHEN MEN WERE MEN AND WOMEN WERE RIVETERS; 
</P>
<P>
THE YEAR OF THE ZINC PENNY BY RICK DEMARINIS (W. W. NORTON: $17.95; 175 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Slocum Hinerfeld, Hinerfeld, a writer and editor, is at work on a 
novel set in Santa Monica. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Someone has to tell the story, every time. Sometimes the narrator is part of 
the story, in on the act, an "I." The "I" here is Trygve Soren Napoli, age 10. 
His own self of a later time looks over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The adult Trygve (one can't help thinking of him as a close friend of the 
author) probably was invited for his overview. He says such things as, "I was 
never aware of having choices," and establishes a time-frame wider than the 
story's, a future still to come, by comments like, "Years later I learned. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
He could have stayed home. Trygve Soren Napoli, age 10, is the hero of this 
book, its center and Best Person. This is the history of his year in Los 
Angeles, the wartime year the United States Mint made pennies of zinc -- 1943. 
</P>
<P>
"The Year of the Zinc Penny" is the story of Trygve's love for his mother, a 
story of unrequited love. 
</P>
<P>
When his mother divorced his father (a man strangely absent from his son's 
thoughts and life), Trygve was sent from New York to Montana, to the keeping of 
his mother's rigid parents. 
</P>
<P>
After four years, Trygve is sent for and delivered via the Great Northern and 
Northern Pacific railroads to his just-remarried mother in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, a gorgeous, laconic Norwegian-American, is a woman of little 
affection and little affect. To Trygve, stepping off the train to meet her 
after four years' separation, she is "a radiant blond stranger." She shakes his 
hand. "Well, it's been a while," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about bad beginnings. Terrified of being abandoned ("I didn't trust my 
mother. She was a disappearing woman."), Trygve refuses to stay behind when his 
mother and stepfather take his Uncle Gerald to Tijuana to show him a good time. 
</P>
<P>
So Trygve is a witness when drunken Gerald punches a policeman, and his three 
elders are arrested and jailed. Trygve's story begins: "My first night in the 
foster home . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Home -- a two-bedroom Westside apartment on Ridgely Drive, north of Adams -- 
fills with an instant family. Through the thin walls, a child can hear 
grown-ups arguing. 
</P>
<P>
Head of the house is Mitchell Selfage, theater-arts graduate, milkman and (thus 
enabled) black marketeer, who acquires his 1928 Cadillac with wood-spoked 
wheels in the same week he acquires his stepson. 
</P>
<P>
Uncle Gerald is married to Ginger, Trygve's mother's sister. Part Tlingit 
Indian, sometimes courtly and kind, a brutal drunk, Gerald is in the Canadian 
navy. His ship loads in Long Beach, and his shore leaves mean trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Aunt Ginger, Trygve's mother's dreamy and beautiful sister, as sweet and nutty 
as a fruitcake, follows Gerald from Vancouver, probably to stay for the 
duration. But duration is a relative concept for Ginger, who believes she's had 
many past lives. "Long Ago and Far Away" is her favorite song; here and now 
she's Gerald's punching bag. Gerald's son, William, foul-mouthed and sullen at 
15, has come with her. 
</P>
<P>
"Now then," Gerald says, when they assemble in the living room. "(Isn't) this 
quite a little family situation?" 
</P>
<P>
It's quite a Los Angeles situation, with clicking palm fronds, storm drains, 
bougainvillea, waiting lists for apartments, incinerators, lawn sprinklers, 
"red wind," Don the Beachcomber's, the just-renamed MacArthur Park, and a class 
full of children at the Marvin Street School who don't know what to make of 
Master Trygve Soren Napoli. 
</P>
<P>
A neatly lettered sign serves notice that the apartment house is "restricted" 
-- no pets, Jews or children allowed (and in 1943, no black or Latino person 
would have thought of an apartment in this territory). When the landlord comes, 
children run for the "fort," an earthen bunker in the lot next door. It is, 
Trygve thinks, "great fun, like war itself." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles at war is a city of blackout curtains (and Ken Murray's revue, 
"Blackouts") and crowded skies. For the top of a cereal box and a dollar, Tryg 
and his friend Malcolm receive air spotter kits -- "side-view and bottom-view 
silhouettes of both Japanese and German warplanes. You also got a pair of tin 
binoculars." 
</P>
<P>
The two spend their summer days on the roof. "Test pilots from all the major 
aircraft plants put their planes through the paces straight over our heads. 
P-38s dove and twisted through the stratosphere. Douglas Dauntless SBDs moaned 
at low level skipping imaginary bombs through the hot streets. Huge formations 
of B-25 Mitchells shook the buildings. Sleek P-51 Mustangs had dogfights with 
one another at altitudes so rarefied they could only be seen through the 
binoculars. The high-flying B-24s left vapor trails as they crossed from west 
to east on their way to England." 
</P>
<P>
Uncle Gerald's rooftop antenna, an absurd, magnificent addition to Tryg's 
two-tube shortwave radio, betrays them. The landlord discovers children in his 
building, and they are evicted. 
</P>
<P>
Tryg understands at once: "I had lost my home and there was no other." "It 
isn't the end of the world," his mother says. But it is to Tryg: "William and I 
didn't figure in her plans, not for the time being anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Mother and Ginger will go north to the Kaiser Shipyards, where welders make 
even more money than riveters. William (with a birth certificate made in 
Tijuana) will join the Marines. Trygve will be sent to Montana on the Super 
Chief. 
</P>
<P>
But first there is a burst of sound and color. Mother and Ginger play in 
Mexico. After a Margarita or two, joy enters their Norwegian souls. Tryg calls 
it "tequila happiness" and helps himself to the dregs of their glasses in a 
nightclub. The band leader announces a conga, and the crowd goes wild. So does 
Tryg. "La conga! La conga!" he yells, just for that moment caught in ecstasy. 
</P>
<P>
Like all good stories, "The Year of the Zinc Penny" has a shadow tale, the 
story of its times. Millions of Americans, most of them men, traveled to 
foreign theaters of war in the greatest movement of population the world had 
ever seen. Their women moved too, in search of adventure or companionship or to 
shed the past, freed from ties and responsibility by the ready money of war 
work. Some of them never grew up. Their children had to.

IN NICARAGUA, 'WE BELIEVE WE ARE ALL KINGS'; 
</P>
<P>
MEMOIRS OF A COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY BY ARTURO CRUZ JR. (DOUBLEDAY: $18.95, 267 
PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Seidenbaum, Seidenbaum is The Times' Opinion editor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Meet an ardent activist with a shot of wry, almost Holden Caulfield in 
Nicaragua, looking for the unphony cause and the dedicated leader in a thicket 
of intrigue, scandal, bloodshed, family grudges and fierce egos. 
</P>
<P>
Try to separate the Sanchez clan from the Chamorro clan from the infamous 
Somozas and the divided Sacasas who wound up half pro-Somoza and half 
anti-Somoza. Nicaragua, the reader learns, is small but divided -- a country of 
fewer than 4 million people settled, unsettled, across 50,000 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
Family is a potent force and a divisive force, reminiscent of Greek tragedy in 
the way brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces, in-laws and cousins wind up 
at war with each other. Arturo Cruz Jr. is the son of a man first jailed by 
dictator Anastasio Somoza in the late 1940s; Arturo Cruz Sr. would later become 
a revolutionary Sandinista, then a defector from the revolution, then a 
presidential candidate, then a self-removed ex-politician. Such zig-zags, in 
and out of power, in and out of revolution, for both father and son, make this 
a book of naive hope followed by sophisticated heresy. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz writes English with elan and fluidity, perhaps because he was educated 
here and because he spent so much time in the United States as an envoy for the 
Sandinista regime, as a sort of drum-beater/fund raiser for the Contras and as 
a source for the Central Intelligence Agency. Like his father, Cruz the younger 
kept finding his idealism dashed by the realities of politicians or generals or 
spies whose ambitions were larger than their abilities -- or their interests in 
the Nicaraguan people. 
</P>
<P>
The Contras, a disparate collection of counterrevolutionaries -- old Somoza 
conservatives, disillusioned Sandinistas and disaffected military men -- spent 
as much time fighting among each other as they did trying to oust the 
Sandinistas. The Sandinistas, in turn, were a junta of veteran revolutionaries 
-- some Marxist, others mercurial -- riven within factions headed by Daniel 
Ortega, Tomas Borge, Jamie Wheelock and more. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA and the U.S. State Department, almost adopting the internecine 
Nicaraguan manner, were just about as uncoordinated, especially after Oliver 
North set up his Contra command post in the White House. In the chaotic course 
of the North venture, Cruz, the seeker of love as well as liberty, even had a 
romance with Fawn Hall, the White House's most famous document-dumper. 
</P>
<P>
And the Soviets who people these pages as Sandinista sponsors also seem no 
better than bumblers. "Valentin," a KGB officer in Washington, was so obsessed 
about being tailed that "we'd meet at monuments, where he'd open the car door 
and I'd jump inside."

Such comic-opera moments punctuate the essentially tragic story of a country 
wrecked by earthquake (1972) as well as warfare. Eden Pastora, the once-revered 
revolutionary fighter, was betrayed by his beloved mistress, a Sandinista spy. 
Carlos Coronel, a gifted Contra, made the mistake of deciding that a New York 
Times correspondent, James LeMoyne, had to be a CIA agent because the real 
agents he met were "too stupid, too obvious." The boots and uniforms shipped to 
the Contras by the CIA were standard American sizes, much too large for 
standard Nicaraguans -- another proof to the "freedom fighters" that their 
North American allies knew nothing about what suits Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz does know about his country, with regret. "Conspiracy," he writes, "is the 
ancient legacy of Nicaraguan political culture. . . . Nicaragua's political 
history is rife with the sport of overindulgent conspiracy. My enemy today is 
my friend tomorrow and my enemy the day after, the saying goes. The Nicaragua 
tribe is too small, the country's players too few, and all the political chiefs 
are friends. Why should one of us wield power when another one could? And so we 
fight against anyone who emerges over the rest of us. We believe we are all 
kings." 
</P>
<P>
Therefore Cruz, however committed to the cause of Nicaragua's people, can never 
permanently commit to the movement or the man of the moment. He joins, defects. 
He discovers new hope only to discover new hypocrisy. Having been on opposite 
sides in various positions next to power, he at last realizes, "There is 
nothing worse than to stand too close to the gods. The more you see of them, 
the worse you feel about them. The mystery is gone, and with the mystery, the 
respect." 
</P>
<P>
Like all literary figures in a quest, Cruz Jr. is the indefatigable innocent. 
Smart, likable, earnest, he personalizes civil war as the most destructive kind 
of family feuding. Sad story. Good reading.

RICHARD EDER: UNDER THE TREE OF LIFE -- IT'S SUPERMAC ; 
</P>
<P>
HAROLD MACMILLAN VOL. 2. 1957-1986 BY ALISTAIR HORNE (VIKING; $24.95; 741 PP., 
ILLUSTRATED; 0-670-82980-3) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He would like to be prime minister like his grandfather, young Alexander 
Macmillan once announced, "and sit under a tree and read a book." 
</P>
<P>
Harold Macmillan, who started in his family's publishing firm and went back 
after a 40-year detour through British politics, never really left his books 
behind. In his periodic depressions -- "black dogs" he called them -- he would 
turn the government over to Rab Butler, his deputy, and go to the country for a 
couple of days to read Jane Austen. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his life, as Alistair Horne's haunting biography shows, this clever 
and sufficiently ruthless politician drew courage, high spirits, images and a 
self-image from his reading. Power, which expends so many other people as it is 
exercised, expends the exerciser most of all. The loneliness demands 
replenishment. Macmillan found company in his books, and resonance. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, for example, his recreational delight was in the prime-ministerial duty 
of keeping an eye on Britain's state religion. He would receive the Archbishop 
of Canterbury and remark, afterwards, that whereas he, Macmillan, wanted to 
talk religion, the archbishop wanted to talk politics. For a moment, he was not 
the expansive leader of a shrinking empire, but Trollope in Barset. 
</P>
<P>
Horne's biography is a superbly detailed account of the career of one of the 
more active and intelligent British leaders of the century. This second volume, 
which begins in 1957 when Macmillan took over from Anthony Eden after the Suez 
disaster, covers his seven years in office and the long and extraordinarily 
fruitful retirement that ended with his death in 1986 at age 92. 
</P>
<P>
The book has its awkwardnesses. The need to cover, at least cursorily, the 
range of problems that confronted the prime minister month by month and year by 
year makes for choppiness. There are a few pages on the Middle East, on Cyprus, 
on NATO, on weapons, on the Russians; and a new round a year or two later. It's 
like tugging a body stocking up a well-fleshed body -- a nip here, a nip there. 
</P>
<P>
Its unique virtue is not the thorough record and analysis of the public life. 
Emerging from the account of victories and defeats constructed upon the backs 
of events, and the unmanageable procession of "nexts" that wear out any public 
career, we get a portrait of the character that conducted the life. 
</P>
<P>
I say "character" rather than "man," and "conducted" rather than "lived." The 
man remains elusive, as Horne himself declares, despite his unparalleled 
access: Macmillan's unpublished diaries and correspondence, and years of taped 
and untaped conversation. 
</P>
<P>
What we get is a literary character extracted by two remarkable authors. There 
is Macmillan's account of himself: sensitive and unsparing at the same time, 
and colored by art; and Horne's: enthralled and detached at the same time, and 
also colored by art. On a lesser scale, of course, but still -- Johnson by 
Boswell. To speak of a literary character is not to contest its truth. The tree 
Macmillan read books under was his tree of life. 
</P>
<P>
The public image that lingers of him is buoyancy followed by droop. In the 
first years of his government there was a kind of euphoric resurgence in the 
country. The Beatles and Carnaby Street were icons of trendiness; there was a 
renaissance in the arts and the beginnings of a tourist boom; and the economy 
seemed to be perking up. 
</P>
<P>
"You never had it so good" -- a campaign slogan -- almost seemed true. Abroad, 
the jaunty figure of "Supermac" in a white fur hat, trying to revive summitry 
with an explosive Khrushchev, or speaking of the "winds of change" in Africa, 
or knitting a comrade-in-arms tie with Eisenhower and an avuncular tie with 
Kennedy, contributed to the brightness. 
</P>
<P>
It was on a curve of decline, though. Macmillan was only one of a procession of 
British leaders to wrestle unsuccessfully with sluggish domestic productivity 
and energetic domestic consumption. Despite his passion to keep Britain as one 
of the world's Big Three, Macmillan had to accept the shrinking of his 
country's role in the world, a partnership with the United States that owed 
more to personal relations than to reality, and De Gaulle's crushing veto of 
Britain's entry into the Common Market. 
</P>
<P>
It was these things more than the Profumo affair -- a sex scandal that erupted 
around a cabinet minister John Profumo -- that brought Macmillan low and 
discouraged him out of office. Without waiting for more considered medical 
advice, he decided that a prostate operation he was undergoing would 
incapacitate him permanently, and quit. He spent 23 years of subsequent good 
health regretting the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Regret can destroy a public man. For a man of letters, on the other hand, it 
can open a world. Macmillan took an active guiding role in the affairs of what 
was then his family's publishing house. More than that, though, his voice was 
freed. 
</P>
<P>
As chancellor of Oxford University, he turned a ceremonial post into a podium 
for a cycle of spacious, witty and beautifully turned observations on the 
affairs of the world, present and past. The same golden words electrified the 
House of Lords when, at 90, he finally accepted the earldom that Queen 
Elizabeth had kept on open offer for the previous two decades. They astonished 
visitors, and in a series of letters and visits over the years, they provided 
solace to Jacqueline Kennedy, widow of his friend. 
</P>
<P>
Filtered through his conversations with Horne, they turn an accomplished 
political biography into something much richer. It is a mosaic of vivid 
recollections, pungent comments on events and personages, and splendid 
observations by friends, old antagonists and the biographer. There was a 
quality in Macmillan's wit, as in Falstaff's, that encouraged the wit that was 
in others. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyant and suspicious, effervescent and depressed, capable of cutting irony 
and real personal and social compassion, Macmillan was an actor who wrote his 
own lines (with the help of Sophocles, Machiavelli, Burke, Lucretius, Conrad 
and Hardy, among many others). Harold Wilson, a fierce opponent and 
not-so-secret admirer, said that "his role as a poseur was itself a pose." 
</P>
<P>
Horne shows the poses. Macmillan did the effete Etonian snob to perfection; 
also the bookish gentleman with slipping eyeglasses, a stained cardigan and a 
Guards Regiment tie just showing. At 85, he was particularly good at suggesting 
senile collapse and then rising to deliver a stunning hour of elegance and 
passion. In office, he won the loyalty of his gifted subordinates by 
pronouncing all crises to be "fun" or "a bore," and by making a point of never 
coming in until late in the morning. He explained: 
</P>
<P>
"If you come to the Cabinet Room at 9:30 and start ringing bells you only upset 
them all . . . if you come down too early it's rather like an office too; all 
the work piles up, and you must let them have time to open the new letters, the 
urgent ones, the urgent telegrams, otherwise you become rather a nuisance." 
</P>
<P>
One can imagine an audience of executive overachievers ("He's always at his 
desk by seven, long before his secretaries," the publicity bio goes) listening 
to such advice. One hopes they might. It is the kind of thing that explains how 
this long-retired political in-fighter, statesman and besotted reader was able, 
in his ninth decade, to make his listeners feel wiser and more hopeful. It 
makes us feel that way too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 -- From "Harold Macmillan, Volume II: 1956-1986." 
</P>
<P>
After John F. Kennedy's death, a deep affection grew up between his widow and 
the man who had been her husband's ally, friend, adviser and fellow-wit. When 
he was alive, Macmillan and Jacqueline Onassis would see each other whenever 
either was in the other's country. The extracts from letters between the two 
that appear in this book -- mostly unpublished up to now -- give a rare and 
moving glimpse of Mrs. Onassis' feelings and her ability to express them. 
</P>
<P>
Here, she replied to Macmillan's initial letter of condolence: 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I become so bitter, only alone -- I don't tell anyone -- but I do 
truly think that any poor school child looking at the record of the 1960s -- 
could only decide that virtue is UNrewarded. The two greatest men of our time, 
you and Jack -- all you fought for and cared about together -- the Atlantic 
Alliance -- how full of charity were your relations always with each other even 
when unforeseen disastrous things like Skybolt happened. And how does it all 
turn out? De Gaulle is there (words deleted) and bitter old Adenauer -- and the 
two people who have had to suffer are you and Jack. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And then I remember this summer -- when we lost our son Patrick -- and he 
showed me the letter from you -- in your own hand -- and you said -- in the 
midst of all your troubles -- 'Private griefs are so much worse than public 
ones' -- you were in the most terrible time of your life -- but you could write 
that way to Jack . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
And here is the last part of Macmillan's reply: 
</P>
<P>
"I shall count it something I can perhaps do for Jack, just being a recipient 
of letters . . . I am writing this at home -- in this softly beautiful day, 
with the buds on the trees in the woods, just beginning to get that wonderful 
purple before the Spring. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"May God bless you, my dear child. You have shown the most wonderful courage to 
the bitter outer world. The hard thing is really to feel it inside. . . ."

HOW HEALTHY WAS PRIMITIVE MAN?; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH AND THE RISE OF CIVILIZATION BY MARK NATHAN COHEN PH.D. (YALE UNIVERSITY 
PRESS:$29.95; 320 PP.; 0-300-04006-7) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. Boyd Eaton, Eaton, with Marjorie Shostak and Melvin Konner, co-authored 
The Paleolithic PrescriptionA Program of Diet and Exercise and a Design for 
Living. (Harper &amp; Row, 1988). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Was there an Eden? Rousseau thought so; he admired the noble savage and wrote 
that in a "state of nature" men were strong of limb, fleet of foot and clear of 
eye. He contrasted this natural condition of health with the proliferating 
diseases of civilization and was "tempted to believe that in following the 
history of civil society we shall be telling that of human sickness." 
</P>
<P>
Anthropologist Marshall Sahlins concurred: He described technologically 
primitive hunter-gatherers as living in "the original affluent society." Of 
course, the opposing view had its proponents. Thomas Hobbes wrote that the life 
of primitive man "was poor, nasty, brutish and short," and more recently, Lewis 
Henry Morgan described human cultural evolution as a progression from 
"savagery" to "barbarism" and finally to our current enlightened state of 
"civilization." 
</P>
<P>
Can such conflicting views be reconciled? If not, what really did happen in 
history? Mark Nathan Cohen's "Health and the Rise of Civilization" provides 
challenging, thought-provoking and, for most of us, unexpected answers to these 
questions. Cohen's highly regarded "The Food Crisis in Prehistory" and 
"Paleopathology at the Origins of Agriculture," the latter co-edited with 
George Armelagos, have established him as a leading medical anthropologist with 
special expertise in the health consequences associated with the shift from 
hunting and gathering to agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
In his current book, Cohen uses health as a reasonably quantifiable measure of 
the human condition. He traces the progression from our late Stone Age 
(big-game-hunting ancestors of 25,000 years ago) through the "broad spectrum 
revolution" (which, in the Old World, began about 15,000 years ago); the 
"Neolithic Revolution," during which the shift from foraging to agriculture 
occurred, about 10,000 years ago; the development of large-scale "civilized" 
societies beginning perhaps 5,000 years ago, and finally to the modern 
industrialized states of the present. 
</P>
<P>
Rousseau and Sahlins notwithstanding, most of us maintain a Hobbesian 
perspective of the progression -- John A. J. Gowlett's "Ascent to Civilization" 
pretty well sums it up in a single book title. We live longer than our 
preagricultural ancestors did and our childhood mortality rate is lower. We 
have immunizations, antibiotics, anesthesia, open-heart surgery and MRI 
scanners. Surely our health is superior; how could anyone argue otherwise? 
</P>
<P>
Cohen can. He skillfully blends insights from the fields of epidemiology (the 
analysis of factors governing health and disease in contemporary societies), 
medical anthropology (actual field studies of health among recently 
investigated hunters and gatherers) and paleopathology (the use of skeletal and 
mummified remains to evaluate the health of prior societies). These related, 
yet independent disciplines permit "triangulation." Each, by itself, is 
imperfect, limited, biased; but when data from all three fields tend to support 
common conclusions, the resulting interpretation of past events is hard to 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen's analyses probably will upset beliefs, images and illusions that many of 
us hold. It appears likely that farmers worked harder and were less healthy 
than were the foragers who preceded them. Then why did the "Neolithic 
Revolution," the shift from hunting to farming, occur. Cohen postulates that 
game animals were becoming ever scarcer and that increasing population produced 
growing constraints on group mobility. Bands that previously had ranged widely 
to utilize seasonally available plant and animal resources now competed with 
other groups that wanted those same resources. In the end, people adjusted to 
the new circumstances by adopting a sedentary rather than nomadic existence and 
by increasing the productivity of the land they were able to hold -- they 
became farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Changes of this magnitude had to affect human health: Foragers walk away from 
their refuse, but it accumulates in sedentary communities -- especially ones 
with rudimentary or nonexistent sanitation facilities. The resulting boost in 
the prevalence of infectious disease was exacerbated by increased community 
size: Epidemic diseases cannot persist in cultures composed of small, mobile 
bands. In addition, trade, necessitated when people became confined to fixed 
locations that couldn't provide all requisite resources, promoted dissemination 
of epidemic infections still further. 
</P>
<P>
Nutritional quality declined even as quantity increased. In most locations, 
animal husbandry failed to provide the dietary protein that hunting had 
previously afforded. Concentration on a smaller number of vegetable crops 
suitable for the community's geographical location necessarily limited dietary 
breadth in comparison with that available to wide-ranging nomadic foragers. 
Furthermore, farmers are more vulnerable to climatic vagaries: Hailstorms, 
droughts, floods, late freezes and so forth can produce famine more readily for 
agriculturists than for foragers -- a contention Cohen documents by analysis of 
dietary stress markers in skeletal remains. 
</P>
<P>
The Neolithic Revolution's social and political consequences were of even 
greater import. Agriculture necessitated coordinated, future-oriented group 
activities. These, together with increased community size, led to the emergence 
of formal leaders -- chiefs, or "big men." The same factors also promoted the 
development of status hierarchies foreign to band-level hunting and gathering 
societies in which interpersonal relationships are essentially egalitarian. 
Despite our pride in the Declaration of Independence, men were more equal 
before the Neolithic Revolution than after the American. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen proceeds to make similar analyses for the shift from small- scale 
agricultural communities to the larger, commonly recognized civilizations that 
began to appear about 5,000 years ago, and also the changeover from agriculture 
to industry that occurred roughly 200 years ago. In each case, his observations 
are perceptive, balanced and insightful. Perhaps the central theme is that the 
health implications of these societal upheavals have been unevenly stratified. 
For the elite in most locations, health and longevity have slowly and fitfully 
improved. However, for the majority, and especially for people in disadvantaged 
geographical locations, health indicators suggest that overall welfare failed 
to achieve preagricultural levels until the 19th Century. In the world's poorer 
developing nations, people are almost certainly less well-off even today. 
</P>
<P>
Even affluent individuals in the world's most "advanced" industrialized nations 
suffer from chronic degenerative diseases -- heart attacks, strokes, cancer, 
diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis and hypertension -- which the best available 
evidence suggests were uncommon, rare, or practically unheard-of for hunters 
and gatherers. Cohen marshals impressive and convincing data from multiple 
disciplines to support this conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
The book is divided into three sections. The narrative text of 142 pages is 
followed by an 82-page appendix of footnotes -- readers of the prestigious 
periodical Science will be familiar with this arrangement. Finally, a 46-page 
bibliography provides documentation and further reading for individuals who, 
like myself, are stimulated by the book's ideas. Cohen's style is scholarly but 
clear and easily readable, not at all stiff and technical. Even the footnotes 
are straightforward and helpful, rather than arcane or excessively academic. 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, "Health and the Rise of Civilization" is certain to become a 
classic -- a prominent and respected source on this subject for years into the 
future. It should be of value for historians, anthropologists, and physicians 
interested in epidemiology or preventive medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Are there any qualifications? Of course, but they're hardly derogatory. Cohen 
might have broadened the scope of his work. For example, the place of women in 
society has varied with the "rise" of civilization just as health has. Many 
anthropologists believe that men and women were near equals, both socially and 
economically, before the emergence of agriculture. Thereafter women generally 
became second-class citizens or totally disenfranchised to the status of mere 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent fluctuations in women's status have roughly paralleled changes in 
health. Only in the recent past -- and then only in restricted cultural 
circumstances -- have women reclaimed the near equality that appears to have 
been their birthright. I wish Cohen had addressed this topic with the same 
perceptive, even-handed scholarship that characterizes his writing; the results 
would have been welcome amid the unscientific, largely politicized pro- and 
anti-feminist diatribes now extant. 
</P>
<P>
Reservations aside, this is a marvelous book. It's a well-written, scrupulously 
documented, finely reasoned treatise that will shake up prejudices, blast icons 
and broaden horizons. If you want to read something that will make you think, 
reflect and reconsider, Cohen's "Health and the Rise of Civilization" is for 
you.

DEATH, AND ALL THAT JAZZ; 
</P>
<P>
THE HOT JAZZ TRIO BY WILLIAM KOTZWINKLE ILLUSTRATED BY JOE SERVELLO (SEYMOUR 
LAWRENCE/HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $17.95; 153 PP.; 0-39550096-6) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By William Vollmann, Vollmann's most recent book is The Rainbow Stories 
(Atheneum, 1989). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are three stories in this slender volume. All have the word blues in 
their title. All are about death. The first takes place in a nostalgically 
conceived 1920s Paris of jazz and magic shows; the second in a cartoon of 
ancient Egypt, and the third in some America or other of hobos and traveling 
circuses. As is his habit, William Kotzwinkle has little interest in 
verisimilitude. Reality, we might say, is a crutch for those who can't handle 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Each tale in the trio reminds me of the interior of a crystal paperweight. 
Sharp edges have been banned, gravity is lenient (just watch the miniature 
blizzards, slower than falling feathers), and soft luminescence is the order of 
the day. Thus petted and protected from us, the inmates of the paperweight can 
live out their lives: the silk handkerchiefs sweetly reeking of ambisexuality, 
the wigs of great composers crawling with symphonies instead of lice, the boxes 
with their stolid lusts and greeds. . . . 
</P>
<P>
But Kotzwinkle takes every opportunity to remind us that gravity must get its 
prey in the end. How could it be otherwise? After all, the snow crystals do 
settle eventually to the bottom of the liquid, just as the handkerchiefs will 
die of old age or might even be killed. "The penalty for taking the heavenly 
silkworms back to the dimension of earth is death," says he. Magical 
commutations of execution occur when the author shakes his paperweight again 
and everything floats yet awhile longer, as in the last tale, when two 
high-wire circus performers elude Mr. Death several times by various 
stratagems, but in the end, "we tumbled on," presumably to be shattered on the 
hard ground below. In every story, whether the paperweight is a giant bottle or 
the Egyptian realm of dead souls, dust comes to dust at last. 
</P>
<P>
This is Kotzwinkle's operating principle, and a very true one it is, too. Now, 
how well is it expressed? In the publicity matter that slathered my proof copy 
of this book, I learned that Kotzwinkle is a necromancer, a fantasist 
extraordinaire, and a magician -- and this all on one page! (I wonder if he's 
also a prestidigitator?). Wiping away this diarrhea (for which Kotzwinkle is 
not responsible), I picked up the three paperweights one by one and looked into 
them 
</P>
<P>
The first of these, called "Django Reinhardt Played the Blues," is by far the 
longest. Unfortunately, it is also the most disappointing. The sculpture within 
the dream-glass is prettily crafted enough, being "the world of shadows, and 
the thought of flowers, and convulsive moments." Many of its denizens, its 
clock-cousins and semi-sentient umbrellas, deserve the life that Kotzwinkle has 
given them. But the story itself, the account of how LeBlanc the magician goes 
inside the paperweight to search for his beautiful Loli, is a series of 
blunders. Loli is LeBlanc's assistant in a disappearing act. Disappear she has, 
reappear she does, and so do far too many supernumeraries, with far too little 
reason, until the game grows thin. 
</P>
<P>
Kotzwinkle does not so much create character as an alloy of archetype and 
stereotype. So we have the master illusionist, the whore with the heart of 
gold, the sensual jazz musician, etcetera. It is not entirely a compliment to 
say that Kotzwinkle's nonhuman characters are his most delightful, such as the 
sweet young thing who helps LeBlanc and his cronies escape from a city of 
hulking wardrobes: 
</P>
<P>
"But then the box of chocolates under the American expatriate saxophonist's arm 
spoke to the crowd, in her sweet voice, words only another box could 
understand. Her bonbons poured out. . . . Bonbons bounced off the boxes below, 
and there was a sound of latches creaking open in response to the little 
heart-shaped creature in her dainty silver wrapping." 
</P>
<P>
This is quite simply beautiful. Such passages are good as the best of Bradbury 
and Brautigan. I wish I could say the same about descriptions of LeBlanc and 
Loli. 
</P>
<P>
For those who don't mind a flabby plot, "Django Reinhardt" may offer 
considerable pleasure. There is one droll scene, for instance, in which Django 
is only halfway pulled into the other dimension. " 'How can I play the guitar? 
Mon dieu, Mon dieu. . . .' He hopped around on one leg. 'This is the most 
uncomfortable arrangement conceivable. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
The second story, "Blues on the Nile," seemed to me more carefully written. I 
will not say very much about it because it is a mystery parable, with an ending 
that it would be unfair to reveal. Whereas death was an undercurrent inside the 
liquid of the paperweight in "Django Reinhardt," it is everything in "Nile." A 
Pharaoh dies, and is laid to rest, along with a few retainers conveniently 
suffocated to keep him company. All these characters, while neither novel nor 
individual, are nicely drawn. Kotzwinkle's depiction of Pharaoh sipping beer 
through a straw as he views the progress of his tomb is perfect. (Here the 
stereotype-archetype business works, because the story has a point to make.) 
Soon the tomb becomes the paperweight, whose liquid is the Black Nile of the 
afterworld. Instead of a slow snowstorm we have a weightless Solar Barque 
skimming through the blackness -- but gravity must have its due; the reckoning 
awaits. The images conveyed by the closing lines stay in the mind. (In my own 
short stories I fail all too often to be concise, so I admire the tightness of 
this piece.) 
</P>
<P>
The final story, however, "Boxcar Blues," is by far the finest in the 
collection. It begins with a brilliant screech: "Melrose rode his unicycle and 
I followed in my clown car. It crashed and I popped out the top in a 
spring-loaded seat, which is how I billed myself -- Poppo the Clown. This was 
with the General Lopez Circus, that traveled all over the country, with winter 
quarters in the poorhouse." And it goes on from there. If the Los Angeles Times 
would let me, I'd simply quote it all. There is hardly a false note in it. 
Melrose and Poppo go on the bum to flee the fishy-eyed Death who is determined 
to claim them, since their necks are technically broken. The paperweight is the 
life of boxcars and campfires. Again and again gravity is resisted, and Melrose 
and Poppo are saved by the generosity of their fellow losers. But we know what 
has to happen. There is a real sweetness to this story, as well as a sense of 
honest sadness. 
</P>
<P>
In "Django Reinhardt," there's a character in a similar fix -- a magician who 
was shot in the chest by his assistant and so is trapped in the paperweight for 
eternity. At the end, however, Kotzwinkle relents and lets him out -- which is 
implausible and even phony. Here in "Boxcar Blues," however, the author plays 
by his own rules: Gravity must win. Tramps can turn into butterflies. Tramps 
can turn themselves inside out. Tramps are eternally prepared to take off any 
minute. But tramps are no less doomed than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
So we see that "The Hot Jazz Trio" plays one theme, but the theme is big enough 
for any number of paperweights. As Kotzwinkle says: "The circus of General 
Lopez travels farther than we dreamed, Melrose." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Servello's illustrations deserve mention. There are 30 of them, so they 
make up a substantial proportion of the book! Speaking as someone who has had 
to wrangle with publishers over the illustrations to my work (and has generally 
lost the fight), I feel very strongly that more fiction should be accompanied 
by pictures. So I am delighted to see Servello's line drawings, for principle's 
sake, and also because they are good. The naked jugglers, balancing balls on 
their heads like seals, the discombobulated boxman, Pharaoh in his sunglasses 
and General Lopez's band are all there, and it is nice to see them. Servello is 
faithful to letter and spirit.

MENSCH BEFORE MOGUL

<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps Steven Zipperstein and I did not read the same book (Neal Gabler's "An 
Empire of Their Own," Book Review, Nov. 5), but when he singles out Jack Warner 
as a humanitarian and leaves out Carl Laemmle, not only does he misread Gabler, 
but the facts as well. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Warner was a movie mogul, but "Uncle Carl" was a warm Jewish mensch first. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving Carl Laemmle out of any discussion of Hollywood, "Where were you while 
the Holocaust was going on" is a travesty of omission.

I've never before written a fan letter regarding a book review, but I must 
express my thanks for Richard Eder's thoughts on Umberto Eco's "Foucault's 
Pendulum" (Book Review, Nov. 5),which I have not yet read and probably never 
will. 
</P>
<P>
When "The Name of the Rose" was published to so much acclaim, I felt like a 
skunk at a lawn party. Throughout his novel, Mr. Eco grandstanded his own 
erudition in tedious tangents to an otherwise nifty story. I found the writing 
just plain literary bad manners. Even worse, the book "turned off" many 
college-aged readers who might otherwise have learned from and enjoyed a 
fascinating period and milieu. 
</P>
<P>
You've summed it all up in writing that a novel is not a truffle hunt, nor 
should it be a mousetrap. Thank you. Literature is not an adjunct of aesthetic 
theology. That's another way of saying that the structuralist arguments make me 
scream.

PERESTROIKA TO THE PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Contrary to Marshall Goldman's reading, I found Abel Aganbegyan's "Inside 
Perestroika: The Future of the Soviet Economy" (Book Review, Nov.5) full of 
hope and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
It is a concise and illuminating picture of the process of restructuring the 
Soviet economy, placing perestroika in historical context and explaining how it 
differs from past economic reforms. It provides valuable quantitative data 
about the Soviet economy and explains the connections between perestroika and 
glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
Aganbegyan's discussion of managerial decision making is sociologically 
informed and of interest to any student of organizational behavior. For the 
socialist scholar, the book contributes to long-argued debates in political 
economy, such as the nature of the market under socialism. 
</P>
<P>
I found nothing sad about this book; it is unapologetic, honest, and 
astonishingly readable. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Goldman so sour about this book is perhaps a realization that his 
vintage brand of xenophobic "Soviet expertise" -- that, with a blind eye to any 
positive aspect of Soviet society, served only to obfuscate Soviet life, 
mystify Soviet politics and perpetuate the cold war -- is, at last, obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
With books like this one available in the United States, the American people no 
longer need to depend upon the Goldmans of Harvard for their information about 
the Soviet Union.

The first appearance in paper of this travel book, originally published in 1948 
by Nobel Prize-winning author John Steinbeck and news photographer Robert Capa. 
Both witnessed the destruction that World War II wrought in the western Soviet 
Union, and watched the Soviet people begin the daunting task of rebuilding 
their shattered country. Perhaps he was inhibited by the language barrier or 
the restrictions on his freedom of movement, but Steinbeck's effort to present 
a portrait of the Russian people never rises above the superficial. He finds 
the "average" citizens friendly, the accommodations abominable, the bureaucracy 
comically inept. But he fails to establish the connection between the land and 
the people that gives "Travels With Charley" its insightful warmth.

Originally published in 1857, "Tom Brown's Schooldays" was one of the first 
books written especially for boys. However, it's difficult to imagine modern 
children wanting to slog through Thomas Hughes' prose, which is as fussy and 
cluttered as a Victorian parlor. (The reader sometimes gets the impression that 
Hughes is trying to sneak up on the subject of a sentence and surprise it.) 
Ironically, most readers who pick up "Tom Brown" today are interested not in 
the hero, whom Hughes intended as the embodiment of wholesome, manly English 
Christianity, but in the villain, the cowardly, bullying Flashman, whom George 
MacDonald Fraser turned into the irredeemable but dashing hero of a series of 
historical novels.

<TEXT>
<P>
In this collection of short stories, Jane Smiley writes about contemporary 
romances that lack the commitment, understanding and respect which 
distinguished L'Engle's marriage. Her self-involved characters quickly tire of 
each other, their relationships and themselves. At the first sign of trouble, 
one or both partners simply decamp, physically or emotionally. The almost 
catatonic husband in the title story can't bring himself to confront his wife 
with his suspicions of her infidelity -- let alone face the problems that 
brought their marriage to this impasse. In another story, a young woman who 
wants a baby chooses a father who offers no possibility of emotional 
involvement: She feeds a gay friend marijuana-laced brownies, then consummates 
the relationship while he sleeps. The clean, vigorous style and strong 
characterizations in "The Age of Grief" reveal a young writer of considerable 
promise.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: HEADED UPSTREAM INTERVIEWS WITH ICONOCLASTS BY JACK

The writers, film makers and social activists in these brief profiles are not 
randomly chosen free thinkers but people with unconventional approaches to 
ecological issues and questions of Native American rights, particularly the 
dispute over the development of the Black Mesa region of New Mexico. Their 
opinions range from rather conventional liberalism to fuzzy-minded romanticism. 
Dave Foreman offers the untenable assertion that the existence of primitive 
hunter-gatherers was "the best life people ever lived." (To paraphrase Tom 
Lehrer, "By the time the average hunter-gatherer reached Foreman's age, he was 
already dead.") In contrast, historian Alvin Josephy and former Secretary of 
the Interior Stewart Udall offer more thoughtful reflections on the issue of 
nuclear power and the conflict between traditional Amerindian beliefs and 
Western culture. "Headed Upstream" raises many interesting questions; 
unfortunately, most of the answers it offers are simplistic and superficial.

OUTTAKES: TRACI DOES TV

<TEXT>
<P>
With a video distributor recently sentenced to a year in prison for interstate 
transportation of child pornography in connection with the much-publicized 
Traci Lords case, NBC is quietly moving ahead with a movie-of-the-week on the 
same subject. 
</P>
<P>
We're told that Lords is actively involved in the development of "Out of the 
Blue," which will portray her story from the time she was an Ohio junior high 
schooler through her reign as the under-age star of such hard-core fare as 
"Traci Takes Tokyo" and "New Wave Hookers." 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean "Blue" will present a one-sided view of her story, 
insists producer Larry Samitsky. 
</P>
<P>
"She is not being portrayed as a total victim," he said. "We're relying on her 
input, of course, but she does not have script approval." 
</P>
<P>
Dalene Young ("Little Darlings," "Cross Creek") is scripting, with no 
production start date or casting targeted as yet. 
</P>
<P>
Samitsky, who bought the rights to Lords' story with partner Frank Konigsberg a 
year ago, added that Lords "is being very forthright about what happened. To a 
certain extent she was a victim. To a certain extent she was responsible 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
"And yet, you have to wonder, considering she was 14 years old, how could it 
happen?" Stacy Jenel Smith

Biker pictures may be roaring back onto the big screen -- with director Walter 
Hill leading the pack. 
</P>
<P>
"48 HRS. -- NOW!" will find heroes Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) and Nick Cates 
(Nick Nolte) returning to face bad-guy bikers led by a lean, mean dude named 
Willie Hickok. An ex-con and member of the Aryan Brotherhood, Willie's got pals 
who sport lots of tattoos -- as well as some nasty attitudes about women. He's 
also got a little brother with 72 outstanding traffic violations as well as 
several outstanding warrants for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Look for plenty of gunplay and explosions -- some special cars get blown to 
smithereens. Not much in the way of female characters, though there is a femme 
detective who's got a thing for Jack.

Studios and producers often arrange special screenings for special-interest 
groups. In the case of "Communion," based on writer Whitley Strieber's 
best-selling account of his real-life abduction by aliens, that group was 
extra-special: These were folks who also claim to have had Close Encounters. 
</P>
<P>
Abductees and contactees -- that is, persons who claim to have been abducted or 
contacted by extraterrestrials -- attended the screenings recently in N.Y.C., 
San Diego, San Antonio and St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lorie Barnes -- a chronic abductee who's also Strieber's secretary 
-- the folks were rounded up via "Communion" network groups composed of 
"hard-core" abductees/contactees in 15 states. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes, 59, had her first contact with a UFO in 1954, she told us, when she saw 
a blue flying saucer with flashing white lights that hovered about 50 feet 
overhead. Four years later, she added, she was physically abducted -- like 
Strieber, taken aboard a spaceship for examination. She said she's since been 
abducted three other times physically, and numerous times "astrally." 
</P>
<P>
An admittedly biased viewer -- Strieber wrote and co-produced the film -- 
Barnes liked it "tremendously," though she found some of the depicted aliens a 
bit "plastic" looking. 
</P>
<P>
As for the screening she attended in N.Y.C.: "Oh, there was lots of applause. 
But not from everyone. Some people were also silent and thoughtful. You know, 
the film had brought back scary memories." 
</P>
<P>
Starring Christopher Walken as Strieber, the film -- from New Line Cinema -- 
opened last weekend to a down-to-earth $1 million in ticket sales. Pat H.

SOUND &amp; VISION: NENEH CHERRY'S 'MANCHILD' TOPS AMONG MUSIC VIDEOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I believe in miracles, words in steady doses," proclaims Neneh Cherry in 
"Manchild," the top video entry in this month's Sound &amp; Vision, and indeed 
there's something near-miraculous about how her seamless, sexy, mature mix of 
pop and rap has been captured on film this time out. Rap also figures at the 
bottom of our roundup -- in which music video clips are rated on a 0-100 scale 
-- in the sexist form of LL Cool J, who proves himself in his latest tune more 
child than man. 
</P>
<P>
CLIPS PICKED TO CLICK: 
</P>
<P>
Neneh Cherry's "Manchild." (Director: Jean-Baptiste Mondino.) Nothing less than 
one of the most visually arresting video clips ever produced, illustrating one 
of 1989's truly great singles, an accusatory yet compassionate balladic 
broadside. In keeping with the theme of the song, which is directed at a 
full-grown man who has a little more growing up to do, the camera slowly rocks 
back and forth throughout the clip, as if mounted on a swing set like the one 
seen in the background on the beachside playground. The camera stops moving 
only during the portions of the song when Cherry -- who is cradling her infant 
son through much of it -- stops singing and starts to rap. Using eye-popping 
visual trickery in the pursuit of thematically relevant imagery, this is a 
likely 1990 award winner and a must-see. 94 
</P>
<P>
Concrete Blonde's "Happy Birthday." (D: Jane Simpson.) This cheerful-sounding 
song, one of the year's catchiest, is really about an unhappy birthday, but 
Johnette Napolitano -- writing about spending the night of her own 30th at home 
alone -- is following in the great rock 'n' roll tradition of making feeling 
bad sound good. It's the best pop birthday song since the Beatles took a crack 
at it, and a little more substantive, too. The fine video is very much in the 
same anti-depressant, celebratory spirit, as Napolitano alternately knocks 
around her Silver Lake apartment in her pj's or kicks balloons around while 
fronting her ace band, with some clever animation thrown in for good measure. 
80 
</P>
<P>
The B-52's' "Love Shack." (D: Adam Bernstein.) On the mindless fluff front, the 
comeback of new-wave vets the B-52's has been one of the season's more welcome 
returns, with the ascension of their "Love Shack" up the singles charts 
certainly good news for the Top 40. This bouncy clip finds the immaculately 
colorful band rolling down the sunny Georgia highway to set up at the Shaque 
D'Amour, a wonderfully mythic place where old and young of all shapes and 
colors (but "no fools allowed") can bump and grind to their hearts' content in 
the middle of the day. Sharp photography and editing help make it seem like 
even more of a Shangri-La. Anybody got an address on this place? 79 
</P>
<P>
WORTH A LOOK AND A LISTEN: 
</P>
<P>
U2's "All I Want is You." (D: Meiert Avis.) The four horsemen of U2 make only 
cameo appearances in this black-and-white tale of a circus dwarf's unrequited 
love for a trapeze artist. It gets all unnecessarily weird toward the end, a 
funeral scene in which it's impossible to figure out which character is dead. 
But this still remains one of U2's more interesting videos, for what is one of 
the band's most inherently cinematic songs; neither the video nor the single 
have received much U.S. airplay, however. 69 
</P>
<P>
Exene Cervenka's "Leave Heaven Alone." (Director: Modi.) Cervenka's folkish 
song is a heartfelt plea for mankind to refrain from filling the heavens with 
the weapons of destruction, now that the Earth itself has been all mussed up; 
the video uses obvious but affecting footage of the environment and its 
spoilage to cement the point. 67 
</P>
<P>
Janet Jackson's "Rhythm Nation." (D: Dominic Sena.) Somehow, Sound &amp; Vision 
wonders if Jackson's world-uniting vision of a "nation without geographical 
boundaries . . . united by music and dance" is the sort of utopia that'll leave 
out those of us too old, too uncoordinated or too busy being activists to cut a 
rug. In any case, the baker's dozen of hot hoofers seen in this 
well-choreographed piece of noir-lit film certainly can. And unlike most 
directors of dance videos, Sena occasionally lets the camera stay on Jackson 
and company long enough for us to actually see what kinds of steps they're 
doing. 67

Tom Petty's "Runnin' Down a Dream." (D: Jim Lenahan.) Dreaming Tom returns to a 
surreal Wonderland, as visited in that great old clip for "Don't Come Around 
Here No More" -- only this time it's animated, in black and white, and he's 
Alice, not the Mad Hatter. 65 
</P>
<P>
Fine Young Cannibals' "Don't Look Back." (D: Kevin Godley.) Plenty of nifty 
visual trickery going on here -- just enough to distract us for several minutes 
from the fact that motionless singer Roland Gift is as uncharismatic a 
performer as he is a handsome man and gifted vocalist. 58 
</P>
<P>
Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire." (D: Chris Blum.) The title may be a 
heavy reference to original sin, or then again it may be as meaningless as the 
string of unrelated cultural icons of the baby boom era that Joel reels off. 
The video improves on the song somewhat with an amusing portrait of a nuclear 
family passing through its kitchen over the decades. But being a distraction 
there in the corner, looking too cool for school in his shades, is Billy J., 
acting all tense and pent-up like maybe this audio/visual parade of '50s-'80s 
touchstones is going to make his sensitive artist's soul explode in spontaneous 
combustion. To which one might suggest: If you can't stand the heat, get out of 
the kitchen. 50

GAMMA RAY ROT: 
</P>
<P>
Donny Osmond's "Sacred Emotion." (Director: Michael Bay.) While grown-up Donny 
does his very best George Michael under a scorching midday sun, a buncha models 
-- sweaty beefcake and sweet-thang cheesecake alike -- build a structure from 
scratch on the Bonneville Salt Flats. It's like a symbolic modern retelling of 
the story of the Mormons settling in Utah, as choreographed by Vogue or GQ. 23 
</P>
<P>
Bon Jovi's "Living in Sin." (D: Wayne Isham.) Bon Jovi's paean to secretive 
teen sex blooms forth in video with a full-scale narrative detailing this 
underage couple's tryst at a motel, as tragically cut short by the girl's 
party-pooping parents. Before the interruptus, shots of the groping, 
love-struck youngsters are intercut with shots of the fat, unhappy parents 
getting ready to settle into separate beds. If only there were some irony 
intended there -- say, the suggestion that someday these hormonally stricken 
teens will get married and turn into their parents, as we all know they will -- 
but there can be no such irony in a genre founded on the proudly immoral 
feeling morally superior to their elders. 1 
</P>
<P>
LL Cool J's "Big Ole Butt." (D: Paris Barclay.) The state of faithfulness has 
come to this: "Lisa got a big ole butt / I know I told you I'd be true / But 
Lisa got a big ole butt / So I'm leaving you." Complete, of course, with visual 
illustrations of the lyrical sentiment from more than one hip-heavy Lisa. The 
decline of Western civ continues. 0

POP EYE: NASH CLIMBS INTO 'RING' AS A TV TALK-SHOW HOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Graham Nash has done it all -- he's been everything from a pop superstar to a 
political activist to David Crosby's baby-sitter. But a TV talk-show host? 
</P>
<P>
Nash makes his debut Dec. 17 on the Arts &amp; Entertainment cable network 
(A&amp;E), where the politically active pop star will host a planned series of 
one-hour programs tentatively titled "The Ring." Produced by DIR Broadcasting 
and Dalrymple Productions, the shows will feature pop-star guests discussing 
social issues -- and performing favorite songs -- before a live, 
celebrity-studded audience. You might say DIR has run the gamut celebrity-wise: 
The debut program, with Nash interviewing Grace Slick, features appearances by 
Steve Garvey, Bonnie Raitt, Suzie Chaffee, Lamont Dozier and the head of the 
World Wildlife Fund. 
</P>
<P>
You also might say that Nash, despite his obvious enthusiasm, has mixed 
feelings about his new career path. "I'm not so sure whether I want to be this 
guy -- this talk-show character -- or not," he explained the other afternoon. 
"I have to admit that I was a little nervous, because in one way it made me 
feel like I was, well, getting old. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking to David Crosby the other day and he told me, 'Stop looking at 
this as something you have to do because you're retired or something. It's just 
another career move, another facet of your personality.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nash laughed. "But still . . . it really is strange walking around an audience 
with a hand-mike, asking people all these crazy questions. I don't want anyone 
to think I'm Phil Donahue." 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. Nash has no interest in tabloid-TV journalism. "I've always 
thought there were lots of musicians who really have something to say, but the 
problem with most TV shows is that you simply come on, sing a song, sit on the 
couch for five minutes plugging your new record and you're gone," he said. 
"We'd like to give musicians a chance to talk about things in depth. I'd like 
to have people on like Sting, who could discuss the rain forests, or Peter 
Gabriel or Midnight Oil or Stevie Wonder, who's a social activist of the 
highest order." 
</P>
<P>
An offspring of glasnost, the show was inspired by a Soviet talk show called 
"The Ring," which had Billy Joel on as a guest when he was touring Russia 
several years ago. "It was a truly unusual program," recalled DIR president Bob 
Meyerowitz, who was there handling a live Joel simulcast. "It was a heavy, very 
intellectual show. The audience was full of Politburo members and Communist 
Party functionaries, who would all ask Billy questions. He didn't know what to 
make of it when he went in, but he came out loving it." 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with Robert Dalrymple, DIR has Americanized the show, but they 
plan to stock each segment with provocative audience participants. A recently 
taped show, with special guest David Crosby, features appearances from a 
National Rifle Assn. exec and a woman whose son was recently killed with a 
handgun. Nash's guests will also perform -- Nash got Slick and Crosby together 
for an acoustic version of "Wooden Ships." 
</P>
<P>
According to Meyerowitz, A&amp;E is still waiting to see the final version of 
the two initial pilots before making a commitment, but DIR is hoping for an 
initial run of 13 hourlong shows. Meyerowitz insists that Nash was an obvious 
choice as host. "I'd heard him do a radio show a few years ago and he was 
tremendous," he said. "He's exactly what we needed -- someone who will command 
the respect of his guests." 
</P>
<P>
Nash is still a little nervous. "When we taped the first show, I was 
terrified," he said. "Put a guitar in front of me and I can keep going for 
days. But it was scary when I had to just go out by myself in front of an 
audience. So I just try to read up on my guests as much as possible. For Grace, 
I studied all sorts of articles and books." 
</P>
<P>
And for David Crosby, whom Nash has performed with for two decades? "With 
David?" he laughed. "I knew all I could ever possibly want to know!"

Graham Nash's last solo album featured a barbed broadside about the Berlin Wall 
titled "Over the Wall." After the historic events of the past week, Nash feels 
the song is more timely than ever. So he's rushed Steve Stills and David Crosby 
into the studio to redo the song's vocals, CSN style. Nash says the song will 
be out as a single within 10 days. "We're signed to Atlantic, so I'd like them 
to put it out," he said. "But if they don't want to get involved, we'll just 
press up 1,000 copies and send them out to radio ourselves." Nash added that 
CSN will begin recording a new album in January, with a proposed April release 
date, to be followed by a four-month summer concert tour.

Is it possible -- a rock album without guitars, keyboards or electronics of any 
kind? It's been done, thanks to Siouxsie Sioux and her drummer pal, Budgie, who 
have taken time off from Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees to make an all-percussion 
album under the moniker of the Creatures. Titled "Boomerang," the record 
features percussion, Siouxsie's vocals and a Budgie-propelled melange of bells, 
chimes and muted trumpets. Due at month's end from Geffen Records, it offers 
such songs as "Pluto Drive," "Speeding," "Killing Time" and "Strolling Wolf." . 
. . And Bryan Adams is still in the studio working on his new album -- he's 
switched producers from Steve Lillywhite to Mutt Lange.

NOTEBOOK: JUST TAKE THE LONDON BUS TO CHEZ JAY II

<P>
Restaurateur Jay Fiondella's longtime dream of sailing his 65-foot pirate ship 
in the South Seas may have ended when the homemade vessel fell off a 
boat-hauling trailer and capsized on Culver Boulevard recently, but the man who 
once financed the search for the sunken Andrea Doria's booty still has a few 
flamboyant schemes in the works. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, his Santa Monica bar/eatery, Chez Jay, moves from the little 
tropics-look building on Ocean Avenue that it has has occupied for about 30 
years (the property is owned by the neighboring Rand Corp., which needs the 
room to expand) to a new building slightly to the south. The original 
establishment will remain open for business as usual until the move . . . 
literally. On the evening that Chez Jay II is ready for opening, owner Jay 
Fiondella plans to welcome diners to the old restaurant and take their orders. 
Then he'll load them into a rented double-decker London-style bus for the short 
trip to the new premises -- where their dinners will be served. 
</P>
<P>
REYNALDO McDONALD: This column noted not long ago that McDonald's was testing 
pizzas at some units in Indiana and Kentucky. Now, according to the Wall Street 
Journal, the mega-chain plans to introduce McPizza to all 8,000-plus U.S. 
McDonald's. But don't throw away Domino's phone number quite yet: The pizza 
roll-out will take from one to three years. . . . And, meanwhile, even as the 
McRib sandwich makes a reappearance at McDonald's all over the country, four 
chain outposts in Jacksonville, N.C., are testing yet another new product -- a 
Carolina BBQ sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
ROCKIN' FUNGUS: Rockenwagner in Venice, noted for its special menus based on 
seasonal products, celebrates mushroom season with five or six added dishes 
nightly -- for instance, home-cured gravlax with porcini and extra virgin olive 
oil, mushroom mousse with truffle vinaigrette and mache salad; and mixed wild 
mushrooms with ricotta-filled ravioli and chive sauce. Rockenwagner has also 
recently instituted a nightly four-course prix fixe dinner for $35 a head. 
</P>
<P>
TALKING TURKEY: This column doesn't usually mention Thanksgiving activities -- 
on the grounds that probably every restaurant in town either plans a special 
dinner for the occasion or will close for the day. But this item deserves 
special mention: Lawry's the Prime Rib will feature a full-blown turkey dinner 
this Thanksgiving Day, marking the first time the landmark restaurant has 
offered the bird since 1944. At that time, due to wartime meat rationing, 
Lawry's was restricted to serving prime rib only once a month . . . and served 
turkey on other nights. 
</P>
<P>
AND NOW, LE PETIT SPAGO: Remember that modest Italian restaurant in London we 
reported about some time ago called Spago? (No relation, of course, to our own 
illustrious restaurant of the same name.) Now a colleague writes from Reims, 
the capital of the French Champagne country, to tell me of another Spago there 
-- a fast-food pizza and pasta place, in this case. Among the specials are a 
Salade Spago, with tuna, rice, corn, olives, cheese and a dressing of creme 
fraiche, lemon juice, and vinaigrette; and a Pizza Spago, topped with 
French-style cream cheese, egg yolks, onions, tarragon and bacon. California 
Cuisine it ain't. 
</P>
<P>
TABLE NOTES: Pasadena's Crown City Brewery -- a microbrewery and restaurant -- 
has just introduced Doo Dah Beer, in honor of the community's annual Doo Dah 
Parade. . . . The celebration of the bicentennial of the French Revolution 
originally announced for Nov. 5 at the Culbertson Winery in Temecula, has been 
postponed until Dec. 3 -- and Claude Segal of MaBe added to the stellar list of 
chefs to participate. For more information call (213) 545-5252.

GALLERY IN A GARAGE; 
</P>
<P>
SECOND-GENERATION ART ENTREPRENEUR THOMAS SOLOMON SHUNS TRADITION AND DISPLAYS 
ARTWORK IN A SPACE THAT OPENS ON AN ALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago Thomas Solomon opened a garage and went into the family business. 
</P>
<P>
He does not change oil, spark plugs or air filters in the two-car garage, 
located on an alley in the Fairfax District. What Solomon is trying to change, 
in a quiet way, is the way people think about art galleries. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to be on a boulevard. I didn't want a sign out front," said the 
soft-spoken Solomon as he leaned against his homemade desk. It is the only 
piece of furniture in Thomas Solomon's Garage, a gallery that specializes in 
work by young, avant-garde artists. "I do no listing and no advertising. I do 
not send out press releases. I started the garage with an intent of it being 
about the artwork, and not about making it in the art scene." 
</P>
<P>
Solomon, 30, could have drawn attention to his garage by capitalizing on the 
fact that his mother, Holly Solomon, is famous in art circles as a champion of 
contemporary artists. She opened one of the first art performance spaces in New 
York's Soho area in 1969 and her current gallery, located among the famed 57th 
Street showcases for art, regularly features works by such established artists 
as William Wegman, Robert Mapplethorpe and Nam June Paik. Thomas Solomon's 
godfather is Christo, the artist who wraps whole buildings in material. 
</P>
<P>
Although Holly Solomon also started out by showing young, unknown artists in an 
alternative space, she now has more traditional ideas about what a gallery 
should be. 
</P>
<P>
"When I walked into the garage, the first thing I said was, 'So, where is the 
sign?' " she said, speaking from her gallery in New York. "He said, 'Mom, they 
will find me if they want me.' 
</P>
<P>
"What can I tell you? It's not my way, but I am very proud of him." 
</P>
<P>
Her son, whose garage gallery is now showing "Paintings by the Pound" by 
Luciano Perna (there is a scale by Solomon's desk and paintings are priced 
according to weight), gratefully credits his mother as his inspiration not to 
travel a well-worn path, and he has used connections he gained by growing up in 
an art-intensive household. But he feels strongly that he has to make his own 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"You would think it's easy for me to be the son of someone famous in the same 
business," said Solomon, who speaks in a slow, measured stream of words. 
</P>
<P>
"But I've always learned everything on my own. I made my own mistakes. That is 
part of what I learned from my mother. I learned from her how to live 
surrounded by interesting, challenging art. And I learned from her how to be 
independent." 
</P>
<P>
Financially, he said, he's been on his own. "I'm not a trust-fund baby, that's 
for sure." 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager in New York he worked as an assistant to several sculptors, 
including Alexis Smith and Gordon Matta-Clark, and then curated shows at White 
Columns, an alternative art space in Soho founded by Matta-Clark. "From the 
beginning I was showing young, undiscovered artists, a number of whom were out 
of CalArts." 
</P>
<P>
He left White Columns in 1985 and lived for a year in Europe, curating an 
exhibit of works by 40 young New York artists at the Udstillingsbygning Ved 
Cholottenborgq Museum in Copenhagen, and traveling to take in the European 
avant-garde scene. Then he set his sights on California. He had long been a fan 
of such established West Coast artists as Edward Ruscha, James Turrel, Robert 
Irwin, Bruce Nauman and John Baldessari. But he also wanted to explore the 
works of a younger crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"In New York they are interested in the California work that deals with the 
same issues as New York or European art," Solomon said. "I wanted to learn 
about art out here that was less well-known, less safe." 
</P>
<P>
Solomon came to Los Angeles in 1986 to check out the local art scene and look 
for work. He interviewed for a job at the Museum of Contemporary Art, which he 
didn't get, and was asked to take over as director of the Los Angeles Institute 
of Contemporary Art, which he didn't want to do. He curated shows for six 
months at the Piezo Electric Gallery in Venice and then in the summer of 1987 
put together a show (titled "Breaking Through the Looking Glass") of new works 
by Los Angeles and New York artists. The exhibition was displayed 
simultaneously on both coasts -- at the Fahey-Klein Gallery in Hollywood and at 
his mother's gallery in New York -- with different works by the same artists in 
each show. 
</P>
<P>
He also resurrected a Christmastime event he had staged for several years at 
White Columns in Soho, his "First Pacific A/More Christmas Exhibit and Sale," a 
marketplace in which artists can set up booths and sell their works to invited 
guests. In 1987 he produced the A/More (from the French word for love) event in 
the basement of the regal Los Altos apartments near downtown. All proceeds went 
to the artists. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by the good feelings the event generated among artists, Solomon, who had 
settled in West Los Angeles, decided to look around for his own place to 
establish a gallery. Given his penchant for alternative spaces and basements 
for art happenings, it's not much of a surprise that he ended up in a two-car 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was making studio visits out here, I saw artists working in their 
garages," he said. "It started to come together for me. The garage has a 
history out here -- rock 'n' roll bands, inventions, experimentation, new ideas 
that start small. Mattel Toys, Apple Computers started in garages. 
</P>
<P>
"I started to look for the right garage in a quiet place with beautiful light." 
</P>
<P>
Through a classified ad, he found his dream garage near mid-block, off an alley 
in the rear of an apartment building. The garage, behind 822 Hayworth Ave., had 
long ago been converted to storage space and had been used as an artist's 
studio at one time. It was about 15 by 17 feet and had a skylight to let in the 
"beautiful light" Solomon wanted. 
</P>
<P>
He painted the walls white and the floor gray, and keeps the garage immaculate. 
"I think the only advice I gave him about operating a gallery was that he has a 
responsibility to keep the place clean," said his mother. "He should make sure 
it is the best possible space to show work." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Solomon listened to his mother. The garage looks like a minimalist stage 
set upon which art, whether hung on the walls or situated on pedestals on the 
floor, is the star. 
</P>
<P>
He has not checked to see if an art gallery fits into the zoning ordinance for 
the residential area. 
</P>
<P>
"I have done it low-key, I have insurance, I'm a good neighbor and I have had 
no problems with any officials," he said. He does, however, have friends in 
high places, including on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"Joel Wachs comes to see all my exhibits," Solomon said. "Al Nodel (general 
manager of the Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs) has come too." 
</P>
<P>
The gallery opened last November with a show of "eraser pictures" by Michael 
Gonzalez. "He does a kind of painting with sculpture," Solomon said. "He cuts 
up plastic erasers and places them on Masonite." 
</P>
<P>
The second show was of paintings by the best-known artist who has been shown at 
the garage: William Wegman, whose most famous works are his enduring 
photographs of his dogs Man Ray and Fay Ray. "I grew up with Bill," Solomon 
said, adding that Wegman was the only artist who got his works into the garage 
because of his family connections. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon changes the shows almost every two weeks, much faster than most 
galleries. Artists he has shown include painter Carl Ostendarp, who sprays 
thick linen with urethane foam; local sculptor Robert Millar; Theresa 
Pendlebury, whose show of photos taken of her television screen during 
newscasts was called "Why Go Outside When the Door Is So Pretty;" and Stephen 
Glassman, whose "Frozen Precedents" works use refrigerator units to produce a 
layer of ice over mounted photographs of past U.S. Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon said he does well financially, especially considering his low overhead. 
Solomon sold four of six sculptures he recently showed by Sean Landers, who 
suspends plaster casts of famous figures -- such as Abraham Lincoln and Dante 
-- in blocks of resin. The price was $3,300 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
In September he had a show of mixed media "self portraits" by Laura Stein, with 
price tags ranging from $900 to $2,200. He sold all seven exhibited in the 
garage, plus two more he had in storage. 
</P>
<P>
As with most of his artists, Solomon got a 50% commission on the Landers and

<P>
Visitors to the garage have included famed collector Count Guiseppi Panza, 
famed curator Pontus Hulten, and artists Baldessari and Jonathan Borofsky. 
</P>
<P>
Some days almost no one comes to the garage. That's when Solomon sits alone at 
his desk, doing business on the telephone or reading. He has no employees to 
help man the gallery and he normally does not leave during business hours. He 
brings his lunch. 
</P>
<P>
In a two-hour stretch one afternoon during the Landers show, the only visitor 
was a young man who wondered in from the alley, hoping to bum a cigarette. 
Solomon gave him a Kool. The young man lit up, looked around at the eerie 
display of plaster casts in resin, and quickly exited. 
</P>
<P>
"I like being part of a neighborhood," Solomon said. "I'm very open to talking 
to people. I'm not hidden away." 
</P>
<P>
But he is not settling down entirely. Solomon is drawn to ever-more-exotic 
locales for art displays. "I'm close to making a deal to have this year's 
A/More show in a swimming pool," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The pool, as Solomon envisioned it, will not be emptied for the event. "It will 
be a heated pool and I'll be telling people to bring their swimming suits," he 
said. "The art will be at the bottom of the pool, floating on the surface, on 
the sides. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted to have an art show underwater."

NIGHT OF THE DEADLY FUNNY LIVING SENDUP

Look out, boys and girls -- it's "Zombie Attack!" 
</P>
<P>
Not to be confused with the perpetual onslaught of "Halloweens," "Friday the 
13ths," "Stepfathers" or "Nightmare on Elm Streets," comes Justin Tanner and 
Andy Daley's "Zombie Attack!" at the Cast Theatre in Hollywood. It's a 
seven-character play that manages to cram in all the thrills, chills, laughs 
and gore (count on a couple of severed arms, but a tasteful allowance of blood 
and guts) of your favorite slasher film. 
</P>
<P>
The setting is, of course, an isolated cabin in the woods. Aunt Eva died there 
recently, and it's time to clear it out for the real estate agents. A group of 
30-ish show up to help out with the work. One of them brings along an old, 
dusty book on the occult. And then . . . 
</P>
<P>
The idea for a Halloween show began when Tanner, Daley and a group of buddies 
took a camping trip to a friend's snow-bound cabin and ended up playing 
hide-and-seek with a zombie theme. "We do it now in the theater too," said 
Tanner, 25. "One person is it, and everyone else hides. All the lights are off, 
and depending on how willing you are to let yourself be frightened, it can get 
pretty scary." 
</P>
<P>
Although its most obvious satirical target is horror flicks, Tanner -- who also 
co-directed with Daley -- admits that he had another agenda in mind: "We're 
spoofing 'The Big Chill,' spoofing 'thirtysomething,' spoofing those 
commercials for Gallo White Granache. All those self-serious people getting 
together, drinking and talking and having fun. It's a little nauseating to me. 
So more than zombie films, that's what I was really skewering." 
</P>
<P>
Since hooking up in Los Angeles City College's acting program, Daley, 27, and 
Tanner have worked together often, divvying up the duties on Tanner's "Changing 
Channels" and "Barbie and Ken at Home (Still Life with Vacuum Salesman)." For 
this, Tanner wrote the first draft; Daley came in on rewrites. Daley set the 
early blocking and direction, then Tanner took the reins. Since Daley has a 
good-paying construction job, he finances the shows. ("Zombie" came in at 
$1,000.) 
</P>
<P>
Although free lumber is a definite perk, Daley's heart clearly isn't in 
construction work: "If I could quit my day job, I would. But since I'm doing 
producing, I need to have money -- so I can lose it. Doing theater is sort of 
my recreational hobby. I'm not racing motor bikes, I'm not buying art. I'm just 
finding junk and slapping it on a stage." Of those set decorations, he says, 
"It's such a kick when I find something in the garbage in the morning and put 
it on stage, and someone says, 'Ooh, that is so amazing.' " 
</P>
<P>
The official result of the duo's collaboration has been the creation of Open 
City Productions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not definite," said Tanner, "but we kind of have an agreement with the 
Cast Theatre that I'll do as many plays as I can next year -- hopefully 10. I 
want to form a company of about 18 actors, so some of the smaller work will be 
taken over for us. And I've encouraged other people to start writing, so 
eventually I can give up directing and start acting again. I want a company 
almost entirely devoted to new works, plus some classics." 
</P>
<P>
For now, "Zombie" continues its popular run indefinitely; on Dec. 10, it will 
be joined at the Cast by Tanner's "Happy Time Xmas" -- described as "a play 
about the hypocrisy of the family unit at Christmastime." ("Xmas" will play at 
8 p.m.; "Zombie" will move to a late-night slot.) "We'll use the same set," 
Daley said cheerfully. "Any set I took $50 bucks to build, I'm not going to 
throw out. But we'll take some stuff off the walls, put in a new carpet, a new 
couch cover. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Audience members, they say, tend to be between 20 and 35. "Who knows where they 
come from?" Daley said. "They come from Hollywood, they come out of the cracks. 
It's a very mixed crowd. A lot are just freaks, especially late at night." On 
Halloween, Tanner said, the only person who showed up in costume wore a glitter 
gold dress, a glitter wig and carried a skull: "She was a scary woman. Never 
laughed or smiled, then sort of slunk out when it was over -- and left her 
glitter all over the seat." 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to build on the show's inherent party mood, Daley recently installed a 
beer garden at the side door of the stage, where audience members can drink 
beer and soda before and after the 70-minute show. The idea, Daley said, is not 
to get people drunk -- well, not really. "But it is fun to have a place where 
people can hang out, kind of a little club. It definitely gives the place 
atmosphere. And sure, it's nice to have happy people seeing the show."

GETTING THE DROP ON WILDFIRES; 
</P>
<P>
FIREFIGHTERS USE HELICOPTERS IN EARLY ASSAULTS TO STOP BLAZES' SPREAD 
</P>

<P>
VINA, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Helicopter 901 clattered toward the towering pillar of smoke with six men and a 
woman who would charge the wildfire alone, with only hand tools and little 
chance of getting away if things went badly. 
</P>
<P>
Just two weeks before, a firestorm had trapped a crew from the helicopter 
attack, or helitack, base in Vina. With no escape route, the firefighters 
weathered the inferno inside heat-resistant fire tents. It was too much for one 
of the firefighters, who panicked and ran. He was rescued by a crew captain and 
was later fired. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1973, one member of California's airborne firefighting corps has been 
killed and 11 have been seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
Aboard Helicopter 101, Fire Protection Capt. Dan Burns of the state Department 
of Forestry explained that once the helicopter drops off the firefighters, they 
are largely on their own. 
</P>
<P>
"We're breaking all the rules by going in in front of the fire and watching our 
escape route fly away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to swiftly control a small fire before it gets big. 
</P>
<P>
California, which claims to have the largest firefighting force in the world, 
places more emphasis on helitack than does the U.S. Forest Service, which has 
had to reduce crew sizes to five or less due to budget cutbacks. California, 
with nine helicopter bases, has more helitack units than any other state. 
</P>
<P>
"Air 901 is five minutes out," radioed pilot Jim Costa, his eyes scanning the 
flames racing over a mountain on a rugged oak-studded ranch in Tehama County, 
northwest of Chico. 
</P>
<P>
Gloved hands of the crew members rechecked yellow fire-resistant suits, plastic 
helmets and belts bristling with up to 30 pounds of gear. 
</P>
<P>
Each member of the crew, reduced by one to make room for a news reporter, 
packed a book-size pouch containing one of the heat-reflecting "shake and bake" 
tents they may have to dive into if they are overtaken by fire. 
</P>
<P>
Hand signals flashed across the cramped compartment of the lime-green UH-1F 
"Huey" helicopter, one of the workhorses of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the helicopter tilted so the crew was staring out side windows at 
flames below. As 901 circled the blaze, the two crew captains and pilot -- in a 
clipped language of their own -- picked a landing zone and path of attack for 
the firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of fire that will be up to us to hold," said Burns, the 
35-year-old lead captain. 
</P>
<P>
Air tankers dispatched to drop fire retardant had yet to arrive. Fire engines 
were still lumbering over winding roads miles away. 
</P>
<P>
The chopper touched down in an explosion of dust at the base of the mountain. 
The crew swung into action. 
</P>
<P>
Some pulled shovels and hoe-like brooms from an outside compartment, 
uncomfortably close to the copter's searing exhaust spewing into the 100-degree 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Others unpacked a bag and hooked it under the helicopter so the ship, stripped 
of the crew's weight, could drop water from a nearby pond on the blaze and on 
the firefighters if things went badly. 
</P>
<P>
The crew bounded up the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter that should have lifted off behind them did not. An air 
controller in a small fixed-wing airplane overhead had ordered it to hold. 
Within seconds, an air tanker roared over dropping retardant. The helicopter 
climbed and swung toward the pond. 
</P>
<P>
Burns waved half the crew one way around the fire; Capt. Mike Rivas, with the 
rest, went the other way. Flames licked at their elbows as they hacked control 
lines through walls of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Fire snaked through grass, dying at the control line. An inferno in an oak tree 
died in a crushing torrent of water dumped by the helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty minutes after landing, there came cheers of victory. The firefighters 
had linked up after encircling the fire. Their job was done: Ground crews were 
arriving. 
</P>
<P>
The engine crews would handle "mop up," the tedious, slog-through-the-ashes job 
of dousing every last ember. Investigators would probe the cause, but it was 
evident. A Jeep, a pile of firewood and a chain saw had been abandoned on the 
hilltop. 
</P>
<P>
The helitack crew, which had held the blaze to three acres, would fly back to 
base to be in place for the next run. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter is playing an increasing role in wilderness firefighting because 
it is more like a fire engine than an air tanker, according to a recent state 
study. Besides shuttling a helitack crew and dropping water, it can be used for 
reconnaissance, rescue, evacuation and cargo delivery. 
</P>
<P>
The effectiveness of the program is reflected in this year's statistics in 
California. As of Sept. 25, 6,056 fires had burned 68,880 acres, down from last 
year's 6,831 blazes over 167,696 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The human cost of the 16-year-old program is high at times. 
</P>
<P>
Helitack crewman Denis Lee Cullins was burned to death in a 1987 fire in 
Northern California's Mendocino region. 
</P>
<P>
The Vina crew itself was forced to deploy fire shelters as a wall of flames 
roared at them during Lassen County's Eagle fire in July. 
</P>
<P>
"We could hear the fire and the wind roaring from inside the tents," said Mike 
Weaver, a 22-year-old crew member with five years of helitack experience. 
</P>
<P>
A firefighter with less experience ran instead of deploying a fire tent. Rivas, 
33, finally was able to hold up one of the shelters so he and the firefighter 
could stand behind it. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't planned. I wasn't trying to be a hero or anything," Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured, but the firefighter was fired.

SOCIAL TREMORS STILL SHAKING S.F.'S SOUTH OF MARKET AREA; 
</P>
<P>
EARTHQUAKE: THE CITY'S SECOND-MOST-AFFECTED DISTRICT HAS BEEN ALL BUT FORGOTTEN 
IN THE DISASTER'S AFTERMATH. 
</P>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Market Street divides a corner of San Francisco into different worlds. One is 
the prosperous financial district, largely untouched by the earthquake; the 
other is South of Market. 
</P>
<P>
An intriguing mix of old and new, shabby and chic, South of Market is little 
known by outsiders. And in the days since the Oct. 17 disaster, it has been all 
but forgotten even here although it was one of the areas hardest hit. 
</P>
<P>
South of Market, where warehouses, residential hotels and wholesalers in recent 
years have been joined by fashionable restaurants, offices and artists' 
studios, was the second-deadliest place during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Five people died under a torrent of bricks when the 15-second upheaval wrenched 
off the top of a four-story building and sent it tumbling onto a narrow street. 
Only the Nimitz Freeway collapse in Oakland, with 41 known deaths, claimed more 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
As for damage, "South of Market is the second-most-affected area of San 
Francisco," said Michelle Pla, spokeswoman for the city's Bureau of Building 
Inspection. Pla said dozens of buildings were "red-tagged" as unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
The most affected city district was the Marina, an affluent neighborhood where 
entire apartment buildings crumpled and burned. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone feels sorry for the people in the Marina," said Eric Pryor, whose 
South of Market residential hotel was red-tagged. "But the people here are also 
victims of what I call the social disaster in the city -- the real victims." 
</P>
<P>
For some of the most unfortunate of the neighborhood's displaced, the quake 
also took their jobs. Goodwill Industries was forced to lay off about 150 
people after incurring $2 million in property damage and $3 million in 
equipment damage at its 83-year-old headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"We've laid off the disabled, the disadvantaged -- the working poor, South of 
Market people that we serve with our rehabilitation, job training and 
placement," said Goodwill spokeswoman Charleen Harty. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them live in the area. . . . They now stand to lose jobs and homes in 
one shot. Some of them aren't English-speaking or have hearing or vision loss. 
They cannot go through the normal channels to get help," she said. 
</P>
<P>
City and relief officials had no count of South of Market residents made at 
least temporarily homeless. For many, a traumatic time has been made worse by 
being moved to different shelters. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a certain amount of confusion to being in one place for only a couple 
of days, then have to go (to) the next place and the next. It makes things even 
more difficult," said Michael Robb, a registered nurse working in the mental 
health center of a Red Cross shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter, one of several in the city, started out at the Convention Center. 
Then single men were moved to a Navy helicopter carrier, then to a large 
building a few blocks from City Hall. Women and families were moved to the 
Presidio, an Army base. 
</P>
<P>
Although its residents differ from those of the Marina, South of Market is like 
that neighborhood in that areas most devastated are built on fill -- rubble, 
mud and sand extending the original shoreline into San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
South of Market was hard hit also because many of its buildings are decades 
old, often unreinforced. One historic warehouse facing possible demolition 
dates to 1867. 
</P>
<P>
In some places, narrow buildings lean slightly and the top lines of broader 
structures appear to wave, following the buckling of the street and soft earth 
below. Others show little or no damage from the outside but are blocked off by 
yellow plastic tape and a warning on the front door. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these buildings look OK, but go inside and step on some of the 
floors, and I'd be surprised if you don't fall through," Pryor said. 
</P>
<P>
South of Market's wholesale sellers of every product from flowers to expensive 
furniture, its discount clothing outlets and its restaurants and bars were 
mostly spared serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is a decline in traffic, affecting "mostly the service industries 
that depend on walk-in business -- retail, restaurant, car repairs," said 
Patrice McCarthy, spokeswoman for the South of Market Business Assn.

COMPUTER BREATHES NEW LIFE INTO SCUBA

Computers like those in new car engines will help Navy divers swim deeper and 
stay down longer without telltale bubbles. 
</P>
<P>
Experimental diving gear incorporating a microprocessor is under development at 
the Naval Coastal Systems Center and should be ready for use by early 1993, 
said Steve Gorin, project manager for what is dubbed the EX-19. 
</P>
<P>
A diver using ordinary gear can stay down 100 feet for about half an hour. 
"With this system . . . we can get in excess of six hours at in excess of 300 
feet," said Tony Ramey, head of the center's diving systems branch. 
</P>
<P>
Just how much in excess the Navy won't say. 
</P>
<P>
Workers at the center have been told not to disclose specific uses for the 
EX-19, although they could say it will be the first equipment used by all three 
types of Navy divers: fleet, explosive ordnance disposal and special warfare. 
</P>
<P>
With regular scuba gear, known as an open system, a diver breathes air from a 
tank and exhales it into the water, creating the bubbles. Most of the air is 
wasted as the body consumes only a small portion of the oxygen in each breath. 
</P>
<P>
The deeper a diver goes, the more air is wasted and the harder it is to breathe 
with an open system because air becomes denser. The diver has to breathe more 
air to get the same amount of oxygen and suck harder to get the dense air. 
</P>
<P>
The EX-19 is a closed system that recycles air instead of letting it escape 
into the water, Gorin said. It uses two tanks, one with pure oxygen and the 
other with ordinary air or with a helium and oxygen mixture for depths greater 
than 150 feet. 
</P>
<P>
A scrubber removes carbon dioxide from the used air and additional oxygen is 
injected as needed before it is breathed again through oversize hoses. The 
diver breathes as he normally would on the surface, Gorin said. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy already uses re-breathers and at least one is available commercially, 
but the EX-19 advances the concept by using the microprocessor to control the 
recycling operation and handle other data. The diver wears a liquid crystal 
display unit on one wrist to read depth and tank pressure. 
</P>
<P>
If something goes wrong, "idiot lights" like those on the dashboard of a car 
flash inside the face mask and an alarm, attached behind an ear, goes off. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the development team are civilians but many, including Bill Gavin -- 
lead mechanical engineer and a record-setting cave diver -- and Gorin, have had 
Navy dive training that lets them participate in testing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really strange to get into it because it makes no noise," Gorin said. 
</P>
<P>
Gavin, also a frequent user of open system gear, said he had developed habits 
he didn't know he had until he tried out the EX-19. "When you get into a rig 
like this you have to almost re-teach yourself. Your ingrained training says 
you should breathe a certain way . . . and you don't have to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Scuba divers can fill their lungs, increasing their buoyancy, to stop a descent 
or hover, or can exhale to sink, but those tricks don't work with a closed 
system. "When you inhale you are simply transferring volume out of this rig and 
into your lungs, and your net buoyancy doesn't change," Gavin said. 
</P>
<P>
Open-system bubbles can scare fish away, but they're less frightened of the 
re-breather, Gavin said. For that reason and its other advantages, re-breathers 
are used by some research scientists, but their civilian application is limited 
by cost. A commercial unit goes for more than $20,000, and Gorin estimated the 
production version of the EX-19 will cost about $30,000.

GLACIER NATIONAL PARK, Mont. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just west of the rushing whitewater river that marks the western boundary of 
Glacier National Park stands a 150-foot oil derrick, a thorn in the side of 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
This well is no longer a threat to the ecology of the park. After months of 
controversy, drilling was abandoned in late October and the well was capped -- 
not out of concerns for the environment, but because no oil was found. 
</P>
<P>
Now the oil exploration companies have their eyes on other drilling sites in 
the region, and that has environmentalists worried. 
</P>
<P>
National conservation groups have observed for years that environmental 
problems seldom observe man-made boundaries. They have warned that the national 
parks are threatened from development both inside and outside their boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilderness Society last year listed parks it considered endangered because 
of development. Glacier National Park was on that list, with oil drilling cited 
as a major worry. 
</P>
<P>
But the state Board of Oil and Gas Conservation in September voted unanimously 
to approve the project after 2 1/2 days of hearings in which four wildlife 
experts testified that drilling would affect grizzly bears, wolves and bald 
eagles. 
</P>
<P>
The board also heard from 9-year-old Shinnah Sullivan of Whitefish, Mont., who 
said she represented a group called Children for Wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
"Animals have rights too," she told the board. "I bet they would say a lot if 
they could talk about this. I worry and wonder if there won't be a place for 
them in the North Fork when I grow up." 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the well pointed out that it was on private property. 
</P>
<P>
"When a private landowner can't do lawfully what he wants to on his land, then 
we have the true endangered species: the free American," said Dan Blomquist of 
nearby Columbia Falls. 
</P>
<P>
The board issued a new permit with some conditions covering public safety and 
pollution. Board chairman Jim Nelson said the hearings were not in vain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear now that this board has a duty to ensure protection of the 
environment," he said. "That's one of the criticisms we've had on this: that we 
don't know what is going on." 
</P>
<P>
Now the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management have approved the 
drilling of two more wells south of Glacier next summer. 
</P>
<P>
"All the oil development scenarios have an impact," said Riley McClelland, a 
Park Service eagle expert. "A dry hole would have the least impact; however, 
with each incremental step in oil-field development, the degree of risk to bald 
eagles increases." 
</P>
<P>
"The industry thinks that no place should be out of bounds or off limits, but 
that's not true," said Jim Jensen of the Montana Environmental Information 
Center. "There are places on the earth where dangerous development, where any 
kind of industrialization doesn't belong. This beautiful corridor is one of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
The MEIC and another environmental group filed the suit challenging the state's 
initial decision to issue a drilling permit, contending that 
public-participation laws were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
The well, accessible from a gravel road where deer are a common sight, is just 
half a mile from the North Fork of the Flathead River, Glacier's western 
boundary and a designated wild and scenic river. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first well to actually be drilled in recent years near the park. 
Three others have been proposed but have been delayed by environmental 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Cenex, the exploration company, received speedy approval of its July 
application for the test well because it is located on private land and not 
subject to the review process required for drilling on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, concerns have been raised about logging, subdivisions, 
roads and -- in particular -- an open-pit coal mine proposed eight miles to the 
north of the park in British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
The coal mine proposal was recently dropped, logging has been scaled back and a 
compromise plan was accepted for improving the highway leading to the park. 
</P>
<P>
But proposals for oil and gas drilling remain alive, with little middle ground 
evident between the companies proposing wells and the groups opposing them. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials say modern drilling technology leaves little mark on the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been a little puzzled by the degree of public reaction," said Janelle 
Fallan, head of the Montana Petroleum Assn. "You'd think this was a major 
open-pit copper mine that was going to be there 50 years and disturbing 
hundreds of acres." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, she said, the rig takes up a relatively small area that will be 
reclaimed once the well is capped. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Keating, director of oil and gas operations for Cenex, said the industry 
believed for years that the portion of the Overthrust Belt near Glacier would 
not produce oil or gas, largely because the pockets were covered by such a deep 
layer of stone that they could not be reached by drilling. 
</P>
<P>
But Keating said speculative geophysical work done in the area during the era 
of high oil prices reversed that thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Park Supt. Gil Lusk has criticized the state Oil and Gas Conservation 
Division's decision to issue a permit for the Cenex well using criteria applied 
to other wells around the state, most of which are located on the range land of 
eastern Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Both the industry and the oil and gas board need to realize that "there's a 
hell of a lot different about this area" of snowcapped mountains and glacial 
river valleys, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lusk stressed that he believes some development might be acceptable near the 
park, if it is done properly. 
</P>
<P>
"There can be industry next to the park," he said. "That's not the issue. The 
issue is, is industry willing to invest to make it a good neighbor?" 
</P>
<P>
Lusk cited Columbia Falls Aluminum Co. as a business that has done just that by 
installing new equipment to reduce emissions that were blamed for killing trees 
and slowing tree growth in the area. 
</P>
<P>
But others believe a balance of development cannot -- or should not -- be 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
"This area is not appropriate for many reasons -- for aesthetics, for wildlife, 
for destroying the qualities of why people want to come here or live here," 
said John Frederick of the North Fork Preservation Assn., which filed legal 
challenges to both Cenex wells proposed in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick lives in Polebridge, a tiny community five miles north of the well 
site. The preservation group he heads also has opposed the British Columbia 
coal mine, some subdivision efforts and proposals to pave the dirt road that 
leads to Polebridge.

PAKISTAN MANEUVERS PUT INDIA ON ALERT

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Starting sometime in mid-December, 200,000 soldiers of the Pakistani army and 
air force are to hold the biggest military exercises in their 42-year history. 
</P>
<P>
The scheduled maneuvers have prompted neighboring India to strengthen its 
border force. The two countries have fought three wars since they gained 
independence from Britain in 1947 and still are not on the best of terms. 
</P>
<P>
Brig. Riaz Ullah, chief of Pakistan's Inter Services Public Relations 
Department, said the war games are code-named "Zarbe Momin" -- Urdu for "the 
blow of the perfect Muslim" -- and will test new tactics and weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have not disclosed details or announced an exact starting date. 
</P>
<P>
Riaz said the games will involve one armored division and seven infantry 
divisions in central Pakistan, at least 120 miles from the eastern border with 
India. 
</P>
<P>
The air force will conduct simultaneous operations under the code name 
"Highmark." 
</P>
<P>
Indian war games along the frontier in January, 1987, called "Operation Brass 
Tacks," triggered a precautionary mobilization of Pakistani forces. 
</P>
<P>
Riaz said the Pakistani exercises will be held in a north-south corridor 
defined by the Indus and Chenab rivers in western Punjab province. However, the 
area abuts an Indian-controlled section of the disputed Jammu-Kashmir state. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think these will cause the tensions we saw in 1987," Riaz said. 
</P>
<P>
Dilip Sinha, the first secretary of the Indian Embassy in Islamabad, said his 
government agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"No, we don't see it as a threat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a senior Indian military officer in southern Jammu-Kashmir said 
additional Indian troops and tanks were being stationed along the border to 
"deal with any eventuality." 
</P>
<P>
The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Indian security forces 
in Jammu-Kashmir would increase from 10,000 to 100,000 by the time the 
Pakistani maneuvers begin. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to be caught unaware in case of any possible offensive," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, which is predominantly Muslim, has fought three unsuccessful wars 
with mainly Hindu India since their partition at the end of British colonial 
rule in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
Wars in 1948 and 1965 were over Jammu-Kashmir. In 1971, the two clashed over 
the establishment of Bangladesh as an independent nation in what had been East 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistani and Indian troops still trade artillery fire across the desolate 
Siachen Glacier, 21,000 feet up in the Himalayas in northern Jammu-Kashmir near 
the Chinese border. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan occupies the western third of the 85,000-square-mile state. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides are separated by a diagonal cease-fire line drawn in 1949 that is 
still monitored by a U.N. military observer group. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, chief of the Pakistani army, has announced that foreign 
military observers, including some from India, will be invited to watch the 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
"Our exercise is above board, and not like the secret preparations India made 
two years ago to conduct its massive exercise, 'Operation Brass Tacks'," Beg 
said.

TRADITIONALLY NEUTRAL SWISS TO VOTE ON SCRAPPING ARMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID CHRISTIAN-EDWARDS, REUTERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ZURICH, Switzerland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a fierce national debate, Swiss citizens will vote this month on a 
proposal to abolish the army. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys show the proposal has no chance of being adopted. But opposition to the 
army has grown, particularly among the young, and this worries the government, 
which urges rejection of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"More than a third 'yes' votes would not be good," Defense Minister Kaspar 
Villiger said in a magazine interview. 
</P>
<P>
The government fears that such a result would harm neutral Switzerland's 
international image and cast doubt on its readiness to defend itself. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has come from the "Group for a Switzerland Without an Army," a 
coalition of pacifists, ecologists, religious groups, and left-wing political 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
It collected 111,300 signatures in 1986, and under Switzerland's unique system 
of direct democracy was able to force the government to hold the Nov. 26 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
The group argues that Switzerland, which kept out of World War II, could not 
survive a modern European war and it should set an example of disarmament for 
the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see the money and human talent which goes into the army 
directed at curing the causes of war, not the symptoms," the group's leader, 
Andreas Gross, says. 
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll published in the weekly Schweizer Illustrierte on Oct. 30 
showed only 27% of Swiss favored abolishing the army. While older age groups 
overwhelmingly supported the army, 43% of those between 20 and 29 wanted it 
scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
None of the major political parties backs the initiative. The Radical 
Democrats, Christian Democrats and Center Democrats urge its rejection. The 
Socialists are split on the issue and have advised members to follow their 
consciences. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has aroused strong emotions, even though the Swiss have not fought 
a battle since they were beaten by a French army under Francois I in 1515 at 
Marignano, in what is now Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that the army plays a vital role in the Swiss way of life and is 
often said to be the only unifying force in a country riven by linguistic, 
religious and geographical differences. 
</P>
<P>
For many men, the only time they ever meet compatriots of a different language 
or region is in the army. 
</P>
<P>
The army is a militia based on universal service. Young men are conscripted at 
20 to undergo 17 weeks of basic training and, if they remain privates, have to 
serve another 210 days spread over the next 30 years. Officers serve longer. 
Every soldier keeps his rifle and uniform at home. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics say the army might as well be abolished because it would stand no 
chance against what Swiss military manuals regard as the likeliest threat, a 
Soviet attack. 
</P>
<P>
Others say war is unlikely at a time of glasnost and growing liberalization in 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The government sees things differently. 
</P>
<P>
In a leaflet sent to all voters, it says times of change are also times of 
uncertainty and points out that disarmament negotiations have not yet yielded 
concrete results. 
</P>
<P>
It argues that Switzerland's neutrality has to be defended and adds: "The arms 
race continues and weapons arsenals in Europe have never been so big." 
</P>
<P>
With 625,000 men, or almost 10% of the population, the army reaches deep into 
civilian society and is probably more vulnerable to criticism than a 
professional army would be, as everyone has his own ideas about its role. 
</P>
<P>
Probably its most eloquent critic is 78-year-old novelist and dramatist Max 
Frisch, who took up his pen again last spring for the first time in seven years 
to write a pithy 86-page dialogue in which an old man and his grandson discuss 
the army. 
</P>
<P>
The old man describes the army as "folklore" and the "bodyguard of the 
bourgeoisie." 
</P>
<P>
He says to his grandson: "Why do we need the Cold War? If there were genuine 
peace and the clear picture we have of the enemy were to fade, the billions 
approved for defense spending would be put in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
He goes on: "That is why our army chiefs don't believe in peace research. Their 
thinking is realistic -- not world peace but only the lack of war saves the 
Swiss army from abolition." 
</P>
<P>
The book, "Switzerland Without an Army? A Palaver," was published in June and 
has become the country's top-selling nonfiction work. It has also been 
dramatized and is playing to packed houses in Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
Many who will vote to abolish the army say what they really want is to tell the 
government to cut its defense spending, currently running at $3.1 billion a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But the Defense Ministry says defense spending as a proportion of total 
government expenditure has fallen steadily and is now only 1.8% of gross 
domestic product, well behind West Germany's 3.1% or the United States' 6.4%. 
</P>
<P>
To keep costs down, military hardware is kept going long after other countries 
have scrapped or lost similar equipment in battle. 
</P>
<P>
Field guns dating from 1943 and Hunter fighters built in 1958 are still in 
service, and 34 F-18 McDonnell Douglas fighter planes that the government wants 
to order in 1990 will be expected to last 30 years.

MIAMI: MILITANT CUBAN EXILES INSIST THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO RELATIONS WITH 
CUBA, BUT INCREASING NUMBERS BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE SOME CONTACT BETWEEN THE 
TWO NATIONS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For many years, Cuban exiles here have seized on almost any opportunity to 
reinforce their hard line toward Fidel Castro's Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Sports and cultural events, artists and academicians all have been embroiled at 
times in controversy about attitudes toward Cuba. Some of the disputes have 
sparked threats, public protests and violence. 
</P>
<P>
While anti-Communist fervor among the exiles has not abated, there are signs 
that the viewpoint of the Cuban community here is more complex today than it 
was 30 years ago, just after the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The militants say there should be no relations whatever with Cuba, nor any 
overture made by the United States. Others, in increasing numbers, believe 
there should be some contact between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
Just 10 years ago, which side one was on could hold dire consequences. Bombings 
and bomb threats were not uncommon in the late 1970s and early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Such tactics now are rare. 
</P>
<P>
"There are strong business elements that would be damaged by a fanatic, 
destructive environment," Maria Cristina Herrera, a professor of social science 
at Miami Dade Community College and executive director of a Cuban studies 
institute, said. 
</P>
<P>
That is why some Cuban-American leaders were concerned when the recent Calle 
Ocho Festival became embroiled in politics and the organizer, the Kiwanis Club 
of Little Havana, banned three entertainers because they had performed in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in March, the popular Brazilian singer Denise de Kalafe, 
one of those banned, was grilled by Cuban exile reporters about her appearance 
at Cuba's Varadero music festival in 1979: Had she posed with Fidel Castro for 
a photograph? (No.) Had she praised him in an interview on Havana radio? (No.) 
Had she planned to record an album with a well-known singer in Cuba? (No.) 
</P>
<P>
Some exile leaders later denounced the "frenzy" and urged that the Kiwanis Club 
reconsider its policy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an isolated community in Iowa," Jaime Suchlicki, director of the 
University of Miami's Institute of Inter-American Studies, said. "There 
continues to be a connection with the island and the arrival of people that 
feeds into this kind of activity. "You have to understand how the Cubans feel 
about those collaborating with the Cuban regime." 
</P>
<P>
Xavier Suarez, Miami's Cuban-born mayor, said: "The position the Kiwanis have 
taken is really hurting them and the city. It is a very extreme position for 
them to take -- one I don't think too many people agree with, even in the Cuban 
community." 
</P>
<P>
But some did agree with the festival organizers. Erelio Pena, former president 
of the Hispanic American Builders Assn., said: "They are not hurting Miami's 
image. They are giving a lesson in civic and moral duty. The singers who go to 
Cuba should be punished for this." 
</P>
<P>
Another issue here has been art sold at auction by the Cuban Museum of Art and 
Culture, which has included some works of postrevolutionary Cubans. Anti-Castro 
activists planted a pipe bomb that exploded at the museum's doors in April, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, works of art belonging to the museum vice president, Ramon Cernuda, 
were seized by federal marshals investigating whether the U.S. trade embargo 
against Cuba had been violated. 
</P>
<P>
Cernuda accused the Cuban American National Foundation, an anti-Castro lobby in 
Washington, of orchestrating the incident. He called it "a political vendetta, 
a return to the epoch of McCarthy." 
</P>
<P>
There was more controversy recently over a Cuban studies institute to be set up 
at Florida International University. The state was to provide seed money, but 
the Cuban American National Foundation would match those funds with private 
contributions and, in effect, control the institute's board. 
</P>
<P>
"It was basically an independent entity which didn't respond to the 
university," Lisandro Perez, chairman of the university's committee on Cuban 
studies, said. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the plan said the institute would be forced by its backers to push a 
conservative agenda, and the swift response helped kill the project when state 
lawmakers withdrew the request for funds. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Mas Canosa, chairman of the influential group of exiles here, says the 
foundation has a strong background in research. He told Spanish-language radio 
there was a need to counter the "leftist liberals" currently doing Cuban 
research at the university. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1988, after she had organized a forum on the future of U.S.-Cuba 
relations, an explosion rocked the home of Herrera, the university professor, 
and damaged a car parked in her driveway. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera said the timing of the bombing, apparently meant to intimidate rather 
than to injure her, was important. 
</P>
<P>
"The message was not only sent to us, but the U.S. government" she said. It was 
one of disillusionment with events at the close of the Ronald Reagan 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Cuba reached agreement late last year on 
immigration-related issues, a development that suggested improvement in 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
Tomas Garcia Fuste, executive director of Spanish-language WQBA, said Castro 
has often used exile demonstrations and anti-Castro rhetoric to turn public 
opinion in Cuba against those who fled to this country. 
</P>
<P>
That is why exiles are becoming more careful about what they say and do, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
"Castro and Castro's friends in the U.S. use our reactions against us (to say) 
that we want revolution, to plant bombs and do other things," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
Alpha 66, a militant anti-Castro group in Miami, also recognizes that. Its 
leaders say the group has abandoned the violence it advocated in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we understand the world situation is not in favor of our line 
of fighting years ago," said Alberto Gonzalez of Alpha 66. "The world situation 
has changed completely, to more of the fight for human rights and peaceful 
maneuvers to force the dictatorships to understand that things have to change. 
. . . If we go against the grain, we'll be branded terrorists, which we are 
not." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of bombs and guns, Alpha 66 now concentrates on weapons such as 
broadcasts to Cuba that urge civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia cited the recent visit of the first Cuban athletic team to South Florida 
since pre-Castro days as further evidence that Cubans here want to be seen in a 
different light. A large contingent of Cuban protesters had been expected to 
disrupt the junior weightlifting championships in Ft. Lauderdale, but only a 
couple of minor confrontations were reported. 
</P>
<P>
"We are against Castro, but not against the weightlifters," Garcia said. 
"Communism is all that these kids know. They now have the opportunity to see 
how we live in the United States. We cannot get the freedom of Cuba without the 
people inside Cuba." 
</P>
<P>
Something else that would have been almost unthinkable a decade or so ago was 
an exile organization that openly favored relations between the United States 
and Cuba. The slogan of the new Cuban-American Coalition is "Reconciliation, 
Communication and Tolerance." 
</P>
<P>
Herrera attributes this mellowing to the younger generation of Cuban-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"They are educated here, and though they continue to be very Cuban they have 
been shaped by American values of pluralism, diversity and fair play," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And while there is still intimidation, she added, more and more people are 
daring to speak out against the militants. 
</P>
<P>
A little over a decade ago, retribution was swift. 
</P>
<P>
Emilio Milian, director at a Spanish-language radio station, spoke out against 
those who resorted to violence. A bomb planted in his car blew off both his 
legs below the knees. 
</P>
<P>
Milian, a hard-liner himself, survived and kept on broadcasting. Exile Miami, 
he says, has changed considerably in the 13 years since that attempt on his 
life.

RESTAURANT ISSUES ITS OWN 'DELI DOLLARS' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A new kind of currency is showing up in every corner of this Berkshire Hills 
town -- even in the church collection plate. 
</P>
<P>
It's called Deli Dollars, a limited local currency devised to try to help Frank 
Tortoriello move his delicatessen. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of a nonprofit group called Share, which promotes the region's 
economy, Tortoriello is selling notes redeemable in sandwiches or other deli 
fare in 1990. The bagel bucks are in the form of $10 certificates that sell for 
$8, or $100 worth for $75. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a wonderful new capitalist experiment," said the Rev. Charles 
VanAusdall, who discovered one of the notes on the collection plate at the 
First Congregational Church. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the 500 burgundy-and-cream Deli Dollars printed were snapped up 
within the first 10 days they were offered. The notes can be redeemed next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is for Tortoriello to get money up front to move his business to a 
better site. Loyal customers get a chance to show support -- and get a break on 
next year's sandwich bills. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really just a gift certificate, but it's (also) people acknowledging that 
they can be used more than once, can circulate more than once," said Susan 
Witt, administrator of Share. 
</P>
<P>
Dabbling in new forms of currency doesn't seem to be the main interest of those 
who buy the coupons from the unpretentious restaurant, which serves breakfasts, 
deli fare, soups and sandwiches with names like "Cool Hand Cuke." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, buyers say, they want to support an institution in Great Barrington, a 
small town dotted with New England clapboard houses and featuring an 1895 
statue of a newsboy at one of the main intersections. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank's a friend, and I'm willing to help him out," said Ron White, owner of 
White Knight Records, which will accept the notes at face value toward 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Share officials say that it is too soon to gauge the success of Deli Dollars as 
an alternative medium of exchange, but they contend that it could be a step 
toward regionally backed financing to spur local growth. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems that you get with U.S. dollars is that they tend to leave 
the region rather quickly," said Robert Swann. 
</P>
<P>
The last effort at an alternative currency in New England occurred in the 1970s 
with the introduction of the Constant in Exeter, N.H. That currency was 
designed to be inflation-proof, said Swann, who was involved in the project. 
</P>
<P>
The Constant was issued by banks in Exeter and was backed by a mix of 30 widely 
used commodities. The safeguard against inflation was that, if one commodity 
went up, it could be offset by a decrease in others. 
</P>
<P>
Although the idea never really took root, from 1972 to 1974 about 200 people 
converted about $100,000 into Constants through local trade. 
</P>
<P>
Share would like to see something similar in the Berkshires. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not advocating a departure from national currency," Witt said. "We would 
like to suggest that regions could create their own currency based on something 
of value in that area." 
</P>
<P>
Share is accepting Deli Dollars at face value for membership in the 
organization. Tortoriello said he will also use them as partial payment to 
contractors who do some of the renovation involved in the move. 
</P>
<P>
VanAusdall, who wrote about the project in his church newsletter, thinks an 
alternative exchange can work in a town where "we're all friends and 
neighbors."

EUCALYPTUS TREES STIR IBERIAN ECOLOGY ALARM AS THEY SOAK UP WATER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ecologists and farmers in Portugal and Spain are at war against spreading 
eucalyptus trees. The enemy is a paper pulp industry that encourages the 
planting of more and more of them. 
</P>
<P>
Eucalyptus plantations are sprouting in the two countries as the industry seeks 
a secure supply of the raw material it will need to meet the demand for paper 
as the European Economic Community lowers trade barriers in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
But farmers and ecologists claim that eucalyptus trees drink up too much water 
from the soil, endangering traditional olive trees, chestnut and other 
nut-bearing trees. They also maintain that the trees cause land erosion that 
kills undergrowth vital to the survival of brown bears and other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Cellulose producers dispute claims that the trees are harmful. They say 
eucalyptus trees grow fast and are ideally suited to Iberian soil and climate 
and that plantations will provide more export revenue and create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The arguments are passionate and tempers run high. In March, protesters in the 
Portuguese town of Valpacos clashed with police when farmers tried to rip up 
eucalyptus seedlings from a 396-acre private plantation. 
</P>
<P>
The region is Portugal's poorest. 
</P>
<P>
"We stopped them from planting more eucalyptus at Valpacos," said olive grower 
Joao Silva. "If they try anywhere else . . . we'll do the same again, but 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to plant eucalyptus, they should plant where there's plenty of 
water. Here we don't even have enough to drink." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists contend that the eucalyptus, brought from Australia in the 
late 1800s, can turn fertile land into desert. 
</P>
<P>
"The eucalyptus consumes more water than almost any other tree and impedes 
other plants from growing nearby," said Santiago Martin Barajas, vice president 
of the Federation of Spanish Wildlife Protection Groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Portugal's interior, already poor, is being turned into a giant eucalyptus 
plantation, and more people are moving toward the coast, leaving villages 
deserted," said Serafim Riem, a spokesman for the Portuguese ecology group 
Quercus. 
</P>
<P>
The European Economic Community, which faces a paper shortage, imports $19.5 
billion worth of wood annually. 
</P>
<P>
Timber and pulp command high prices, and this encourages landowners to plant 
eucalyptus, which can be harvested in 12 years, about half the time of more 
traditional trees. 
</P>
<P>
"Eucalyptus for us is green crude oil," said Luis Mira Amaral, industry and 
energy minister for Portugal, where wood pulp, paper and cellulose account for 
8% of yearly export earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish environmentalists fear that the European Economic Community will 
subsidize massive eucalyptus plantings in northern Spain, where the mix of 
Atlantic and Mediterranean climates favors growth. 
</P>
<P>
Portuguese landowners already tap European Economic Community funds via the 
government's Forestry Action Program. While assistance to traditional tree 
planters is higher, the forestry program pays up to 30% of project costs for 
small-scale eucalyptus plantations. 
</P>
<P>
"Portugal has no other vocation," said Eliseu Baena, forestry director at 
Caima, one of Portugal's four major cellulose producers. 
</P>
<P>
"If landowners want to restore their lands, they're going to do it with a 
profitable crop." 
</P>
<P>
Baena acknowledged that eucalyptus trees should be planted away from springs or 
rivers but denied that they erode soil or kill undergrowth vital to wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Navas, deputy director of Spain's Institute for Wildlife Preservation, 
suggested that the environmentalists might be poorly informed. 
</P>
<P>
"There hasn't been a clear debate," he said. "The eucalyptus is blamed for 
causing diseases -- for being malignant." 
</P>
<P>
According to Lisbon's General Directorate for Forestry, eucalyptus trees make 
up only 11.3% of Portugal's forests, or about 4% of the country's total land 
area of 35,600 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
But eucalyptus leads the list of trees being planted in Portugal.

CANADA WAGES LONG-RUNNING BATTLE ON OLD-GROWTH FOREST MANAGEMENT;

CANADA: NORTHERN SAWMILL OPERATORS AND SOUTHERN CITY DWELLERS AND 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS SQUARE OFF OVER THE PRESERVATION OF OLD-GROWTH FORESTS.

TEMAGAMI, Ontario 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mutterings can be heard in this sawmill town about the "southerners" and how 
the long-running battle over the region's forests could have been solved long 
ago without their interference. 
</P>
<P>
The talk is about city dwellers from urbanized southern Ontario, from such 
places as Toronto, where environmentalists have taken on the fight to preserve 
Temagami's old-growth red and white pine forests. The bulk of Canada's 
population lives in southern areas not far from the U.S. border. 
</P>
<P>
This is Canada's Near North, a term used to differentiate it from the more vast 
and less populated barren stretches leading to the Arctic farther north. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to environmentalists and other "southerners," the battle involves 
sawmill operators and forest product companies eager to preserve precedents of 
access to lumber supplies, and an Indian tribe trying to assert a land claim. 
</P>
<P>
Canadians have long debated how to develop their resource-rich, rugged northern 
areas. Since the 19th Century, Temagami has been a wilderness destination for 
Canadians and Americans looking for a remote escape. 
</P>
<P>
The diverging interests have resulted in a standoff over Temagami's majestic 
forests, defying solution at a time when environmental issues have surged to 
the top of public concern nationally and internationally. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Back of the Temagami Wilderness Society said he hopes that the chord of 
concern that the Brazilian rain forest's plight has struck in Canada can be 
translated into intensified interest in troubles closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
As the environmentalists tell it, the logging industry supported by the 
provincial government is threatening the largest virgin pine forest left in 
Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no comparable, accessible wilderness that we know about," Back said. 
</P>
<P>
Tourist brochures for the region note that it is within a day's drive of not 
only the eastern Canadian cities of Toronto and Montreal but also of Buffalo, 
Cleveland, Detroit and other American cities. 
</P>
<P>
Confrontations over forests also have taken place on Canada's Pacific Coast, 
most recently in the Carmanah and Stein valleys of British Columbia. But no 
dispute in the eastern part of the country has been as intractable or received 
as much attention as that in Temagami. 
</P>
<P>
The Temagami Wilderness Society has attracted 14,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Moulder, district planner for the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources 
that oversees land use for public lands, insisted that enough balance has been 
given to all interests and enough set aside for wilderness reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been harvesting (of trees) in this district for over 100 years," he 
said. "There must be economic advantage, or they would have quit a long time 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists respond that the ante was raised by the mechanization of the 
logging industry in the 1950s that required ever larger sawmills to be fed by 
clear-cutting of trees instead of selective harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
Canada is the world's largest exporter of forest products, sending 22% of all 
forest products traded on international markets. There are about 300 towns 
across the country where the industry serves as a mainstay. 
</P>
<P>
Temagami is a nondescript town of about 1,100 people on Canada's north-south 
Highway 11, about a five-hour drive north of Toronto. On first glance it would 
seem an unlikely spot as the centerpiece for an environmental battle, but the 
area around it includes not only the forests but also a vast system of 
interlocking waterways ideal for canoeing. 
</P>
<P>
The fight specifically is over whether logging roads can be extended to allow 
clear-cutting in previously inaccessible areas. 
</P>
<P>
A local Algonquin Indian group, the Teme-Augama Anishnabai, filed a claim in 
1973 for 4,000 square miles of land. The claim was rejected a decade later but 
development in the interim was halted on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
Appeals until recently kept any logging road from being extended and allowed 
time for the protests to gather support and symbolic value. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like how the land is being treated," Michael Paul, an Indian who 
performed the tobacco ceremony at a recent blockade of a logging road, said at 
his home on Bear Island. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians rejected a $35-million settlement offer from the government in 1986 
but recently resumed talks. 
</P>
<P>
The Ontario government gave the go-ahead for work on two logging road 
extensions to proceed after the last appeal was rejected in provincial court 
last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Those who favor allowing more clear-cutting say its effects can be compared to 
those of a forest fire, clearing out growth that no longer is productive and 
setting the stage for new trees to grow. 
</P>
<P>
They also say a steady supply of timber can ensure that at least some sawmill 
jobs will remain in Temagami, if not the 150 that existed when the mill could 
operate at its peak. 
</P>
<P>
The local William Milne &amp; Sons mill has been in receivership since last 
December, but a scaled-down version is expected to resume operations soon. 
</P>
<P>
The wilderness advocates, however, argue that the old growth, with trees dating 
back generations, cannot be replaced. They say the new forest that would spring 
up in its wake would not harbor the greater diversity of natural life now 
existing, especially in the fragile northern environment. 
</P>
<P>
"There's never been an adequate evaluation of what's there," said Don Huff, 
environmental director of the Federation of Ontario Naturalists. "There's no 
place else that still has this combination of things still relatively intact."

WILDLIFE RETURNS TO CITY AS POLLUTION, INDUSTRY DECLINE

<P>
Less pollution, more garbage and the decline of heavy industry have brought 
wildlife to London. 
</P>
<P>
Squirrels abound in the parks, perching on trash cans at Marble Arch to munch 
discarded sandwiches and lick candy papers. 
</P>
<P>
Crows strut in Hyde Park, contesting for fast food remnants with the squirrels, 
pigeons, blackbirds and sparrows. 
</P>
<P>
Salmon, migrating from the sea, were caught in the Thames this year, a tribute 
to two decades of pollution control. 
</P>
<P>
"Foxes have moved in, rearing cubs on railroad embankments and in derelict 
basements and finding food in streets and back yards," said Jeff Edwards, 
conservation officer at the London Wildlife Trust. 
</P>
<P>
One of London's glories is its parks and wild open spaces. It's also a 
gardener's city, in which almost every home has its green back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Turning up in the unlikeliest inner city corners are the ubiquitous allotments, 
small patches of land distributed to retirees to raise vegetables and flowers. 
It's a vestige of World War II, when the British were commanded to grow food on 
every possible square foot of their island. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said the 1956 Clean Air Act, prompted by killer smog, stopped coal 
fires being burned in homes, cleaned the air and improved the prospects for 
wildlife, although increased traffic cancels out some of the gains. 
</P>
<P>
"Kestrels are nesting in high places and preying on sparrows where they used to 
eat small rodents in the country. Magpies were once seen only in the country 
but are nesting in trees in the streets and pinching the eggs of smaller birds, 
as well as scavenging. 
</P>
<P>
"Wildlife can't survive in bits of formal parkland -- it needs wild places as 
well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A prime example is Camley Street in King's Cross, where volunteers cleared 
derelict land, dug ponds and then left nature to create a remarkable patch of 
the wild in the midst of one of the capital's seediest districts. 
</P>
<P>
"It is wonderful for children in the heart of London to see frogs, toads, newts 
and minnows a few yards from a busy street," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
But change has its price. 
</P>
<P>
The Camley Street park is under threat from its landlord, British Rail, which 
needs room to expand.

The pilot of a sportfishing boat had gone below deck and left no one at the 
helm just before a collision with a 564-foot tanker outside Los Angeles Harbor 
late Thursday night, Coast Guard officials said Saturday. Coast Guard Cmdr. 
Chris Desmond said 2nd Mate Tim Filson of the fishing boat Shogun was primarily 
to blame for the crash with the tanker Sealift Antarctic. He said Filson may 
have his operating license suspended. The Coast Guard spokesman said Filson, 
25, broke one of the "basic rules of navigation" by failing to keep a proper 
lookout before the crash, which injured seven people and spilled 2,000 gallons 
of jet fuel at the mouth of the harbor. But Desmond, head of the Coast Guard's 
Marine Safety Office in Long Beach, said that both vessels were to blame and 
that Capt. Arthur Irish of the Antarctic could also have his license suspended 
for failing to give way to the smaller vessel. Desmond said the fishing boat 
had the right of way at the time of the crash. Desmond said that at the 
completion of its investigation in about two months, the Coast Guard will 
probably recommend that Filson and Irish have their licenses suspended for an 
undetermined period.

MIRAMAR PULLS BIG GUNS TO BAR CIVILIAN AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Capt. Hoss Pearson is besieged by 26 proposals from San Diego city and county 
clamoring for a parcel of land that once nobody wanted: Miramar Naval Air 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as Pearson fends off one request, he's hit with another. In most cases 
the requests are for undesirable projects that most neighborhoods fight: a 
sewage treatment plant, sludge and garbage landfills, a jail, roads, a 
petroleum tank farm, a power plant, and a police and a fire academy. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants a piece of action out here," said Pearson, commanding officer 
of Miramar, one of the nation's four master jet stations, a hub for the Navy's 
sophisticated fighter jets situated 13 miles north of downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mind-boggling. You name it, if they don't want it in their back yard, 
they want to put it at Miramar," said Rear Adm. Phil Anselmo, commander of 
Miramar's Pacific Fleet fighter wing. 
</P>
<P>
But the most menacing of all the bids on the 24,000-acre Miramar is the 
proposal for a joint-use, civilian-military airport. It's a proposal that has 
been shelved and revived several times through the decade. But, with each 
revival, it gains more force as the city fumbles for a solution to replacing 
Lindbergh Field, which experts say cannot keep pace with San Diego's booming 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
A decision last week by the San Diego City Council to permit developers to 
build in the area around Brown Field shortens the list of alternatives for 
Lindbergh. And the spotlight on Miramar has intensified. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, the San Diego Assn. of Governments is scheduled to release 
recommendations for an airport site based on a 14-month, $350,000 study. There 
are two key options: Miramar or a multiple-airport approach that would involve 
Lindbergh and Brown fields. 
</P>
<P>
As the population of San Diego has doubled in the past 30 years, much of the 
city's land has been developed. By the middle of the next century, an estimated 
35 million passengers will fly into San Diego annually -- or more than three 
times the number now served at Lindbergh. 
</P>
<P>
"The handwriting is on the wall. The obvious choice is shared use at Miramar," 
said Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego). "It's not a question of being for the Navy 
or being for defense, but it's a question of what is in the best interests of 
all of us. Ultimately, that fighter training airport should be elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Saying that commercial airlines and military could safely share an airport, the 
Airline Pilots Assn. has also come out in favor of a joint-use facility. And 
shared-use proponents point to three joint-use airports used by the Air Force 
in North Carolina, Hawaii and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"It will work -- and it's the only solution we have for San Diego," said Tom 
Carroll, APA spokesman and a member of the Sandag committee. "The Navy is being 
short-sighted. If it poses a hazard, then I question whether they should be 
operating out there." 
</P>
<P>
Others, including Mayor Maureen O'Connor, note that the Navy is unlikely to 
relinquish its prized airfield, which employs 11,000 military personnel and 
2,500 civilians. About 350 aircraft take off from Miramar daily. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless you get a total change in Washington, we are really foolish to think 
the Navy is going to give up Miramar for our airport," O'Connor said last week 
at a City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials, feeling increasing pressure, are preparing to protect their 
turf. They cite Miramar's strategic role in defending the nation, the 
$10-billion price of relocation, the "untenable danger" posed by a joint-use 
airport and the potential damage to the environment at the base, which harbors 
endangered plants such as mesa mint. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here, and we're here to stay. We are not for sale -- we are a part of 
the community," Anselmo said. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials hope to stop the piecemeal assault on the base, in which city 
and county agencies approach with proposals. To help solve this problem, city 
officials recently selected one liaison to handle all their projects. Navy 
officials, in turn, agreed to seriously consider many of them. 
</P>
<P>
Some say this approach may help the Navy maintain its land and a desired 
buffer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Navy is looking to surround itself with uses so unattractive that 
it isolates itself from the city," said Councilman Ed Struiksma. 
</P>
<P>
Anselmo says the Navy is willing to cooperate on many of the proposals but 
there is one caveat -- the Navy wants city officials to sign an agreement 
acknowledging Miramar's right to exist and adopt a policy reflecting the city's 
intention to prohibit major buildings in the area dubbed the accident potential 
zone, 15 square miles around the flight path. 
</P>
<P>
The city may not make such an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"Realistically, I'm not sure we could ever strike such an accord because the 
city leadership changes, the various government bodies change and it would be 
difficult in my mind to make anything other than a short-term commitment about 
what the eventual use of Miramar will be," said Roger Frauenfelder, deputy city 
manager and the city's liaison with the Navy. "After all, we have to respect 
the independent thinking of our future leaders. I don't see how we can bind 
them in that fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Because it sits on federal land, Miramar officials do not always hold the 
reins. Until he read about it in newspapers, the day after the announcement, 
Anselmo did not know that Miramar was selected recently by the Federal Aviation 
Administration for a $114-million radar approach center for air traffic 
control. The center, which will have its own access road, will take a 10-acre 
bite out of the east side of Miramar, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're a taxpayer, and I'm your agent, so you expect me to do the best thing I 
can do with your taxpaying dollars -- we should be using our federal 
resources," Anselmo said. "I don't get upset about these things, but I 
certainly would have liked to have known about it." 
</P>
<P>
The problem of encroachment is not unique to Miramar. Across the nation, every 
military base feels the pinch as once-fledging communities develop and the need 
for land becomes greater. 
</P>
<P>
At Miramar, officials are developing a multi-pronged defense against 
encroachment. Some point to the Navy's economic muscle, saying that the 
military personnel are responsible for $1 of every $5 spent in San Diego. 
Others brandish their patriotism. Anselmo said, "If we want to continue to be a 
free nation and a free world, I think we're going to have to pay the price." 
</P>
<P>
But the Navy's most compelling argument may be safety. 
</P>
<P>
When city officials talk of a train station south of the intersection of 
Frost-Mar Place and Miramar Road, Navy officials speak about the hazard of 
having 150 people clustered a mile west of their runway. From 1972 to 1989, 30 
military aircraft have crashed within 10 miles of Miramar, according to a 
report prepared by Miramar and the Naval Facilities Command in Virginia. Of 
those crashes, 73% crashed within the Navy's proposed accident potential zones 
and two fell within a quarter-mile of the station site. 
</P>
<P>
Sandag officials, however, say they believe commuters would be safe because 
most stay at the station a very short time. They also say commuter rail is the 
only solution to escalating traffic. At the junction of Interstates 5 and 805, 
there are about 217,000 vehicle trips a day, which represents an increase of 8% 
each year. In 1984, there were 145,000 vehicle trips daily. 
</P>
<P>
"A station is very comparable to other industrial uses in the area, and it's 
compatible land use," said Michael Zdon, a Sandag senior transportation 
planner. "People come in 15 minutes before the train and then get out, unlike 
an industrial area where they are there for eight-hour shifts. The case is 
either station or no station; there really isn't any alternative." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed rail system would consist of about six trains, each containing 
about 500 passengers, running from Oceanside to San Diego. And it could also 
become a transportation hub. Councilman Ed Struiksma asked the city to study 
the feasibility of a trolley running to the proposed Miramar train station. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an extremely important transportation hub for the future of San Diego, 
and the fact is, that you don't have Navy jets coming out of the sky at all 
times," Struiksma said. 
</P>
<P>
Others say that, if the area is too dangerous for a station, then it's too 
dangerous for the neighboring residential communities. 
</P>
<P>
"The Navy has had some airplanes ditch; there's no question about that," said 
Jim Mills, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Development Board. "But 
everybody clear on over to Torrey Pines is probably equally in danger. I'm not 
convinced that the Navy's fears are well-grounded." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Miramar pilots have accommodated the growth of surrounding 
communities. They once flew straight to sea to carry out their training 
exercises; now they make climbing S-turns to avoid offending their neighbors 
with the roar of jet engines. Even so, complaints flood the base. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, operations Duty Officer Bill Hubert said he would handle 
fewer than 12 irate calls daily from residents. Today, he says he receives as 
many as 50 complaints a day. These tallies do not include notorious 
complainers, such as the woman several years ago who moved from 1.5 to 5.5 
miles from the base and still called 35 times in a three-month period to gripe 
about noise, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite noise complaints, Navy officials consider themselves good neighbors. 
Although Anselmo said he has no objections to a city-proposed jail on the base, 
he believes his neighbors might. When local builders needed to dispose of about 
100,000 cubic yards of fill-dirt, Miramar accepted it and used it to construct 
a berm around the rifle range. 
</P>
<P>
Base officials say one of Miramar's most important contributions has been 
preserving acres of chaparral-dotted open space, home to a variety of 
creatures, including deer, desert shrew, side-blotched lizard and one bobcat. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, the Navy set aside 2,000 acres in East Miramar as a "research natural 
area" to preserve rare plants and unusual wildlife. With a cemetery dating back 
100 years and the ruins of a homestead town, Miramar officials hope to woo 
universities to study pockets of environmentally and historically rich areas. 
And they also hope to preserve the area, much of it covered with sage scrub. 
One sailor was recently chastised for using a metal detector to find artifacts 
that he sold for scrap. 
</P>
<P>
In the southwest corner of the preserved area, there are a small number of 
vernal pools, depressions in the ground where water collects during the rainy 
season and hosts for mesa mint, which once covered the San Diego area but is 
now endangered. When the Navy built a new jail, officials paid $500,000 to move 
seven vernal pools, said Capt. Al Katz, Miramar's public works officer who 
oversees the base. 
</P>
<P>
"We coined the phrase 'island of ecological rarity' and we're trying to keep it 
that way," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
But Miramar's ecological bent is not without purpose. When the city expressed 
an interest in Miramar's East Gate Mall for a sewage treatment and water 
reclamation plant, officials deferred, saying the area was chock-full of vernal 
pools. 
</P>
<P>
"If an area is a natural resource area, it gives us the ability to say no, you 
can't build out there," Katz said. "That's the whole idea of Miramar being an 
'island of ecological rarity.' If someone says they don't care about ecological 
rarity, then part of our armor goes away. 
</P>
<P>
"You see the problem is that the Navy is always located next to coastlines. 
Where's the most valuable property? Coastline. And so the Navy will always have 
encroachment problems." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the decision about a project as major as an airport would be 
decided by Washington officials. Only seven months ago, the House cleared the 
way to close 86 military bases -- Miramar was not among them. 
</P>
<P>
"You come to the question of are there things that take place at Miramar that 
couldn't take place elsewhere. I suspect they could," Mills said. "Would the 
city want the Navy to relocate its activities and the payroll that goes with 
them? That's the question."

S.D. SHIPYARD HOSTS OPEN-TUNNEL PARTY INSIDE EXXON VALDEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first step in fixing the Exxon Valdez is done, so officials and workers at 
the San Diego shipyard where it's under repair had a party Saturday. It's not 
every day, they figured, that they could show off a 600-foot-long tunnel cut 
out of an oil tanker. 
</P>
<P>
All invited were encouraged to roam through the tunnel, cut through the belly 
of the giant tanker by slicing through 1,600 tons of steel, as well as to gaze 
up at the ribs, the skeleton and the scrubbed oil and ballast tanks rising 
above -- and to ponder the awesome destruction told in the eerie spectacle 
under the ship's right side. 
</P>
<P>
There, sitting on concrete and wooden blocks three feet above the ground, are 
what's left of the sheets of steel that used to form the starboard hull of the 
Valdez before it ran aground in March on a submerged reef in Alaska, causing 
the nation's worst oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
Illuminated by powerful work lights and criss-crossed with scaffolding, whole 
sheets of the ship's skin are shredded, twisted and crumpled. It looks more 
like a discarded beer can than steel three-quarters of an inch thick. 
</P>
<P>
"That it could be tangled this way -- unbelievable," said Dennis Krumweide, 
manager of structural engineering at the National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co., 
where the Valdez is in drydock. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the sort of damage I think happens in war, getting hit by torpedoes, 
the like," said Peter Zschiesche a machinists' union representative at Nassco. 
"Here you get the chance to put the ship back together." 
</P>
<P>
Nassco officials said candidly Saturday that putting the ship back together 
also means getting the chance to focus attention on their company, on U.S. 
shipbuilding and on the foreign competition that has defeated many other U.S. 
shipyards. 
</P>
<P>
Financially troubled and beset by bitter strikes over recent years, then the 
object of a management-led buyout last spring, Nassco is, however, still alive 
-- and the West Coast's only remaining shipbuilder. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the Valdez, so far, is ahead of schedule, and Nassco officials said 
they hope that kind of performance on the big ship will attract other building 
and repair jobs, large and small. 
</P>
<P>
Nassco has a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" because of the attention the 
Valdez has generated, said Dan Peoples, a spokesman the company has hired. "We 
could have people in here every day of the week, looking at repairs to some 
Navy ship, and they'd be yawning, saying, 'Ho-hum.' " 
</P>
<P>
Even with the great attraction, the company went to some lengths Saturday to 
impress. It transported visitors to and fro on modified golf carts, offered 
juice and doughnuts and hoisted photographers on a special motorized scaffold. 
</P>
<P>
All it asked was that visitors be careful and take heed of the signs warning of 
"rocks and falling debris." 
</P>
<P>
The Valdez was towed to Nassco, where it was built in 1986, after it slammed 
March 24 into an Alaskan reef, spilling some 11 millions of gallons of oil. 
</P>
<P>
The ship arrived off San Diego July 10, but its entry into San Diego Bay was 
delayed by the discovery of steel plates that were jutting from its hull, as 
well as an 18-mile slick nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The plates eventually were removed, and the state and Exxon reached an 
agreement to allow the ship into state waters. 
</P>
<P>
The ship, 987 feet long and 166 feet wide, was eased Aug. 15 into drydock. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the repair work involved cutting away those center sections 
of the hull that also were shredded or twisted. 
</P>
<P>
To do that, crews had to slice through the bow of the ship, which was 
undamaged, so they could get to the hull underneath -- and to create room to 
work. The drydock is only 33 feet longer than the ship and affords only two or 
three feet of space on the sides. 
</P>
<P>
After the bow was opened up, crews then removed the 15 structural frames -- 
each 40 feet long, 44 feet wide and 16 feet high -- that, welded together, 
comprised the damaged center. That part of the job took seven weeks, was 
completed Nov. 9 and resulted in the 600-foot tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
The job is "about five weeks ahead" of schedule, Krumweide said. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Tuesday, crews will begin replacing the frames, two a week, Krumweide 
said. Each unit, weighing 100 tons and supported by hydraulic lifts and air 
bags, must be navigated through the tunnel with precisely one-half inch of 
space on either side of its 44-foot width, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the center is repaired, workers will repeat the pattern on to the right 
side, tearing down the frames, then welding in the new ones, Krumweide said. 
When finished, the ship will be the "same strength" as before the accident, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Work is expected to be completed by next July, Krumweide said. Budget estimates 
for the work are $25 or $30 million, said Fred N. Hallett, Nassco's vice 
president for finance. 
</P>
<P>
Though expensive, the cost of repairing the ship falls far below the $130 
million to $150 million Nassco officials previously have said it would cost to 
build a new one.

SMUGGLING: UNREST SINCE THE STUDENT MASSACRE SPURS MANY TO FLEE CHINA. PAYING 
UP TO $30,000 TO SMUGGLERS, THE REFUGEES OFTEN BECOME INDENTURED SERVANTS.

<P>
The frightened Chinese immigrant spoke from his Mission Viejo hospital bed in 
broken English. 
</P>
<P>
"Who are you?" Zheng Kangxin, 32, finally managed as a telephoning reporter 
asked why he was with nine Latino immigrants in a van that was chased down 
recently in San Clemente by the U.S. Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Injured when he jumped from the moving van and tried to run, Zheng apparently 
was so startled by the telephone call that he bolted from his hospital bed that 
same night -- despite doctors' advice. 
</P>
<P>
He succeeded in disappearing back into a shadowy smuggling network that U.S. 
officials say is carrying ever-increasing numbers of Chinese into the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials say that although Chinese 
smuggling routes are old and well established, several factors, including 
unrest in China, are fueling the migration to America. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are arrested by the (Chinese) government, it is almost a death 
penalty," a Chinese pro-democracy activist who asked to remain anonymous told 
an immigration hearing Oct. 13 in Seattle about his decision to flee to the 
United States earlier this year. "If I leave the country, at least it is not a 
death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
Though exact numbers are impossible to document, INS officials say the number 
of major Chinese smuggling operations under their investigation, those 
involving large numbers of smugglers and international connections, has grown 
from about five a year ago to 30 this year. 
</P>
<P>
INS intelligence reports indicate that the Chinese rings are operating out of 
Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, El Centro and Tucson, said Ron Smith, an 
INS anti-smuggling agent in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
On July 1, the INS in Washington launched Operation Dragon aimed at cracking 
Chinese smuggling rings worldwide. Operation Dragon pools INS resources with 
those of other federal agencies to gather intelligence on the Chinese 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Though alien smuggling is hardly a new phenomenon, the upward trend involving 
Chinese has immigration officials particularly concerned from a humanitarian 
standpoint, said Robert Penlon, assistant commissioner in charge of the INS 
anti-smuggling program. 
</P>
<P>
With smugglers charging up to $30,000 to sneak an immigrant out of China, 
across the Pacific and into the United States, Penlon said, many of the 
immigrants wind up in indentured servitude. They work off their debt with 
manual labor or run errands for Chinese who pay the smuggling fee. 
</P>
<P>
"They (employers) give them a hovel to live in and pay them next to nothing," 
said Penlon, who is based in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Penlon added that the immigrants rarely complain. 
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of these people brought in are not sophisticated. They're 
used to taking orders," he said. "For them to venture out into our society, 
they might as well be going into the Gobi Desert." 
</P>
<P>
Other immigrants are smuggled in after relatives in the United States put up 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. seizure of Chinese immigrants has increased from 261 in 1987 to 318 in 
1988, and immigration officials say they have noticed a particular surge in the 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Most noticeable, officials say, has been the activity along the U.S.-Mexico 
border. Last year 79 illegal Chinese were captured, compared to 49 in 1982, 
according to Border Patrol figures. 
</P>
<P>
These figures represent only a fraction of the number of Chinese actually 
coming across, U.S. officials say, because smugglers take great care in making 
sure the illegals do not get caught. The smugglers route their charges through 
Mexico and Canada where INS officials say visa entry is easier for Chinese than 
it is in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese who are caught entering the United States illegally usually are quickly 
released on bond, which is routinely set at $10,000, said Ron Smith, who 
coordinates Chinese smuggling investigations for the INS Western Region 
headquarters in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds almost always are posted immediately, Smith said. Smith said INS 
intelligence reports suggest that the bonds are put up by the same Chinese 
syndicates that smuggle the immigrants into this country. 
</P>
<P>
Once bond has been posted, immigrants generally disappear into the smuggling 
pipeline, Smith said. They settle in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and 
other major cities with established Chinese communities. The vast majority, 
Smith and other U.S. officials said, are headed to the New York City area. 
</P>
<P>
After the June 3-4 massacre of pro-democracy students in Beijing, President 
Bush granted a one-year refuge to Chinese citizens who were in the United 
States as of June 5. 
</P>
<P>
The Beijing massacre accelerated the emigration from China but did not start 
it, Penlon and many other immigration officials said. The pro-democracy 
activist apprehended in Seattle, for example, said he fled his homeland after 
speaking out on behalf of the pro-democracy students. The man, 34, said his 
name wound up on a police list as a leader in the pro-democracy movement, 
prompting him to run for his life. 
</P>
<P>
"When they massacred the students, we felt like it was not safe to go home," he 
said in his Oct. 13 immigration hearing in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Penlon said other factors contributing to the Chinese emigration include a 
deteriorated economy in poorer provinces of China as well as growing concern 
over the status of Hong Kong when the British colony reverts to Chinese control 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Because Hong Kong, adjacent to the mainland, has been a traditional smuggling 
corridor out of China, Penlon said more Chinese immigrants are trying to leave 
by that route while they can. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese smuggling routes were first laid in the late 19th Century after passage 
of the Chinese Exclusion Acts, which denied entry into the United States by 
Chinese who had been flooding into this country to help build railroads. 
</P>
<P>
Staging areas for Chinese smuggling include Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, 
Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, according to a June 29 INS memorandum. 
There, immigrants receive phony passports and visas and are assigned an escort 
to accompany them to North America. 
</P>
<P>
Transit points identified in the memorandum include the Netherlands, the 
Dominican Republic, Belize, Guatemala and Mexico. Additionally, Nepal, Turkey, 
East Germany and Spain have at least once been associated with Chinese 
smuggling rings, the memorandum said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the volume and sophistication of Chinese smuggling has 
increased dramatically with the social disruption caused by the wars in the 
Indochinese peninsula, the opening of China, the uncertainty over the futures 
of Hong Kong and Taiwan and the "economic seesaw" that periodically affects 
Chinese populations, the memorandum said. 
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, the syndicates smuggling ethnic Chinese have now forged links with 
other ethnic groups involved in drug trafficking, criminal activities and 
racketeering enterprises producing substantial illicit proceeds," Bruce 
Nicholl, INS senior agent in Washington, said in the memorandum. "These 
alliances also extend to 'legitimate' businesses which utilize the smuggled 
aliens as an indentured work force to reap huge profits." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, Nicholl said, an immigrant must work off his debt in a restaurant or 
other legitimate business at below-minimum wage. The businesses, he said, are 
almost always run by Chinese. INS investigators have even obtained contracts, 
written in Chinese, between an employer and an immigrant working under 
indentured conditions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, one employer under investigation bunked as many as a dozen 
immigrants in a single room, Nicholl said. "He would sleep them in shifts. The 
first shift would work eight hours and then sleep. The next shift would work 
eight hours. And then the next shift would work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While immigration officials rely on intelligence reports to gain a general idea 
of how a smuggling network operates, they lack sufficient information to take 
action against them. That is the purpose of Operation Dragon. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Latino smuggling rings, which are easier to infiltrate, the Chinese 
syndicates have a closed nature that makes them virtually impossible to 
penetrate, U.S. officials say. For that reason, they say there have been only a 
handful of arrests involving suspected Chinese smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the few successful infiltrations of a Chinese organization, an 
undercover federal probe in Buffalo, N.Y., last May smashed a smuggling ring 
that brought Chinese aliens from Canada by hiding them in car trunks. 
Twenty-five people were arrested, including two suspects who officials said ran 
the ring. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. immigration officials say the odds that illegal immigrants will elude 
capture and blend into Chinese-American society are excellent.

NEGATIVE REPORTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is it with The Times San Diego Edition's sustained animosity toward our 
own city's Soviet arts festival? How come you've had such a nasty attitude 
toward this inaugural and triumphantly successful event? I read rave reviews 
from Los Angeles reviewers from the Los Angeles Times, yet most local San Diego 
reporting has downgraded, belittled and sneered at the festival, from beginning 
to end. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego arts community must be bursting with pride in its many 
outstanding achievements. The police must be encouraged having such crowds 
using Balboa Park, making for less crime. And all who long for international 
understanding and reconciliation are cheered with all this new interaction and 
friendliness. The thousands who saw any of the 70-plus free performances of the 
Georgian dancers were enthusiastic in their praise, as were other audiences 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
I cannot understand why local reporting was so negative, not that the people of 
San Diego paid any attention to your negatives. Now I'm wondering if I should 
comfort myself that fewer and fewer people read newspapers?

DEALING WITH 'MINIDORMS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego is not a college town in the sense of Berkeley or Iowa City. But San 
Diego State University and UC San Diego still dominate their immediate 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
At UCSD, 38% of the 17,600 students live on campus, the second-highest 
proportion of any public university in the state, and the university plans to 
increase that to 50% as it grows. But only 7% of SDSU's 35,000 students live on 
campus. More than 5,000 others live within a mile of it, mostly in apartments, 
but increasingly in single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, this has caused parking, traffic and noise problems, 
exacerbated by some landlords who rent to large groups, turning two-, three- 
and four-bedroom homes into "minidorms." Thus far, attempts to control 
minidorms have been mostly ineffective. Zoning restrictions limiting the number 
of residents in a home, based on the size of bedrooms, the number of baths and 
the amount of off-street parking, are difficult to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
Now some city officials and community leaders want to revive a concept struck 
down by the state Supreme Court in 1980 and impose different standards on 
"traditional" and "nontraditional" families. The city attorney's office is 
working on a measure that would impose stricter parking requirements on 
households of unrelated people. A citywide planning group wants to prohibit 
more than three unrelated people from living together in single-family 
neighborhoods. Proponents hope today's more conservative court would rule 
differently than the 1980 court. 
</P>
<P>
But both proposals are inherently unfair and violate individual rights as much 
today as 10 years ago. They are also likely to be as difficult to police as the 
current zoning restrictions. And, in the country's least affordable rental 
market, any restrictions on unrelated people sharing quarters would only make a 
bad housing problem worse. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State San Marcos may bring some relief, and the SDSU foundation plans to 
develop more student housing. But there will always be students wanting to live 
in single-family homes, and the city needs to find better ways to enforce 
zoning and parking restrictions. One promising proposal would treat rental 
properties as the business they are and require landlords to obtain permits. 
This makes more sense than the city trying to define a family.

RESTORING THE RIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with great interest the article "Urban River Seeks to Find Its Way" 
(Nov. 12). Considering that the San Diego River once flowed unimpeded from the 
mountains to the sea, it's quite distressing to accept a river that has since 
been bombarded by civilization. Fortunately we are witnessing a renewed 
interest in the San Diego River. What is desperately needed, however, is a 
comprehensive restoration plan which addresses land use, wildlife management, 
recreational opportunities, flood control and protection of water quality. 
</P>
<P>
Restoration of this once beautiful river will require two basic commitments. 
First and foremost is the dedication of open space along the banks of the river 
for preservation of wildlife habitat and public access. Second, a river 
management entity must be established to carefully balance wildlife management, 
recreational interests and water quality. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has traveled to San Antonio or Austin, Tex., realizes that a 
properly managed urban river can represent an aesthetically pleasing 
environment with numerous recreational opportunities. Imagine a linear park 
with bike paths extending along the banks of the San Diego River from Mission 
Bay to the Cleveland National Forest. Carrying that thought one step further, 
imagine if the water quality could be improved to the point where it was 
suitable for fishing, boating and irrigation. A comprehensive river management 
approach is far preferable to piecemeal mitigation of individual development 
projects in the flood plain.

TRAFFIC CONCERNS SPUR R.H. ESTATES TO OPPOSE CLOSURE OF MIRALESTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rolling Hills Estates City Council members said last week that they oppose the 
closure of Miraleste High School on the peninsula's east side unless steps are 
taken to control expected traffic and parking problems. 
</P>
<P>
The council's action was a formal response to an environmental impact report on 
the proposed closure that is being prepared by the Palos Verdes Peninsula 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1988, a judge ordered the district, which wants to close Miraleste 
because of declining enrollment, to produce the report after an east-side 
parents' group filed a lawsuit to keep the school open. 
</P>
<P>
In a Nov. 15 letter sent to school board President Jeffrey Younggren and signed 
by Mayor Nell Mirels, council members recommended that Miraleste remain open 
because it was not possible to mitigate the traffic and other problems its 
closure would create. 
</P>
<P>
"Since it would not be possible to mitigate the potential impacts caused by the 
closure of the school, the City Council of the city of Rolling Hills Estates 
recommends that Miraleste High School remain open to serve the community it is 
intended to serve," the letter stated. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, however, Mirels said the letter was drafted in haste and the 
city meant to convey the message that it opposes closing the high school only 
if the district refuses to take action to solve the problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess what we are saying is you have to do something," Mirels said Thursday. 
"You have to see something is done so you don't shut down the flow of traffic" 
on Palos Verdes Drive North. 
</P>
<P>
Marianne Kipper, a member of the parents group that filed the lawsuit against 
the district, said she was thrilled that the Rolling Hills Estates council had 
taken a position on the issue. She said the group hopes to persuade Rancho 
Palos Verdes council members to also take a public stance against the school's 
closure. 
</P>
<P>
The Rolling Hills Estates letter was forwarded to the consultant hired by the 
school district to prepare the report, according to a district spokeswoman. 
District officials have said the report will probably be completed by January, 
and the district has no other comment. 
</P>
<P>
A draft of the report, which was made public last month, concluded that if 
Miraleste is closed, congestion on major roadways would increase because 
students now attending the school would have to travel across the peninsula to 
attend class. The district's other two high schools are both on the west side. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the report concludes that traffic volume at the intersection of 
Palos Verdes Drive West and Cloyden Road would increase by 23% during the peak 
morning rush hours if Miraleste is closed. Volumes at other key intersections 
such as Silver Spur Road and Palos Verdes Drive North would also increase, 
although not by as much, the report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
The report also concluded that Miraleste's closure could cause congestion in 
neighborhoods near the two remaining high schools. Already, there are not 
enough parking spots at the schools to meet student demand. 
</P>
<P>
At Palos Verdes High School, for example, the report estimates that there is a 
shortage of 170 spots and, if Miraleste closes, the deficit would climb to 265. 
At Rolling Hills High School, the present shortage of 87 spaces would jump to 
237, the report states.

NEW DIRECTOR OF HOUSING COUNCIL TO DRAW ON PAST; 
</P>
<P>
DISCRIMINATION FIGHTER: FORMER URBAN LEAGUE EXECUTIVE MARY MILLER IS THE FOURTH 
HEAD OF THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY FAIR HOUSING COUNCIL IN THREE YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The scrutiny Mary Miller endured 10 years ago as the first black person to move 
into a Los Feliz condominium building was disquieting. It seemed to her that 
every move she made, every word she spoke, was examined by residents made 
uneasy by her presence. 
</P>
<P>
Today, she said, her neighbors acknowledge their past wariness. But Miller, the 
fourth executive director of the San Fernando Valley Fair Housing Council in 
three years, said they now value her as a neighbor. She said that turnaround -- 
from reluctance to acceptance -- is what comes of challenging preconceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The other residents of her complex "didn't escape from the building . . . and 
sell their condos," said Miller, 61, who assumed her new position two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they are in close proximity to . . . people other than their own ethnic 
group, they say, 'Hey, that wasn't so bad,' " said Miller, who worked for the 
Los Angeles regional office of the Urban League, the influential civil rights 
organization, for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said she expects to draw on that experience as head of the troubled 
nonprofit fair housing council, which uses government grants to uncover and 
battle housing discrimination against minorities as well as families with young 
children. 
</P>
<P>
She was the only candidate seriously considered during a six-month search by 
the council board of directors. Dozens of others who applied for the job, which 
pays between $27,000 and $33,000, lacked the proper credentials, board members 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's move to the Los Feliz condominium was not the first time she had been 
a pioneer. Her family was one of the first black families to live in the nearly 
all-white northern Chicago suburb of Glencoe. She was the first black woman to 
attend the National College of Education in Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Her professional experience and education will serve her well. As the assistant 
director of the Los Angeles regional office of the Urban League, she was 
responsible for education, training and management development for local 
affiliates of the organization. She holds a master's degree in management from 
the University of Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
Enthusiastic board members, who voted unanimously to hire her, say they are 
confident that she will end a turbulent period in the council's 30-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The council fired its last executive director, who had been in the job seven 
months, for incompetence last March. The Fair Housing Congress of Southern 
California, the umbrella organization that distributes city and county grants 
to the six housing councils in Los Angeles County, put the council on probation 
in August, 1988, when the council fired its previous executive director. 
</P>
<P>
That director was fired after only five months on the job for making an 
allegedly anti-Semitic remark. The fair housing congress became worried that 
the rapid turnover was causing a drop-off in housing discrimination 
investigations. Before that, the job had been vacant nine months after the 
departure of a director who had held the job less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
The congress was concerned about overly ambitious fund-raising goals and rumors 
of a power struggle on the council's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Marcella Brown, executive director of the congress, said the Valley council 
will remain on probation indefinitely. Brown said she was encouraged by 
Miller's extensive background. 
</P>
<P>
Said Holly Azzari, president of the Valley council's board of directors, "She 
has everything we wanted and more." Azzari said Miller's long involvement in 
civil rights issues, extensive experience as a fund-raiser, budget expertise 
and management background make her highly qualified for the position. 
</P>
<P>
Rafer Johnson, the well-known Olympic athlete who was on the search committee 
for the executive director's position, said the council's previous directors 
lacked the necessary qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
"What has happened in the past was . . . we hired some people that just 
couldn't do the job," Johnson said. "The fair housing history in the San 
Fernando Valley has been exemplary, and we haven't had it in our executive 
directors in recent years to continue that excellence. I think we have found it 
in Mary Miller." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said she knows about the council's problems but is optimistic about its 
future. "I'm going to approach this . . . in a positive vein because there is 
so much work that has to be done," she said.

FITNESS: TARZANA'S PORTOLA JUNIOR HIGH NINTH-GRADERS SCORE BEST AMONG LOS 
ANGELES DISTRICT SCHOOLS IN THE VALLEY ON STATE'S PHYSICAL FITNESS TEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Portola Junior High School is proud of its PTA. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I call our program: Pain, torture, agony," said Doug Dufay, 
co-chairman of Portola's physical education department. 
</P>
<P>
The method seems to be working. Last year's ninth-graders earned Portola the 
highest score on state fitness tests among San Fernando Valley schools in the 
Los Angeles Unified School District, according to results released last week by 
the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
What's surprising is that the Valley's best are also among the district's 
brightest. The ninth-grade class at Portola is part of a magnet school program 
that is limited to students who have scored 145 and above on IQ tests. Only 
about half of 1% of the general population can achieve such scores, district 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to think that people who are intellectually gifted don't have much 
physical ability, but that is not the case," said Kriste Mencher, coordinator 
of the Tarzana school's magnet program for the highly gifted. 
</P>
<P>
That is apparent. Nearly 50% of the students in Portola's ninth-grade class 
passed all four parts of the state fitness test administered last spring, 
compared with 10% of ninth-graders throughout the Los Angeles district. 
</P>
<P>
"Our ninth-graders want to achieve in every phase of school," said Katy Boukas, 
co-chair of Portola's physical education department. "They have that desire, 
and they want to get good grades." 
</P>
<P>
Portola ninth-grader Hyung Choi said running daily in his physical education 
class already has put him in good shape after his three-month summer layoff, 
and he believes he will be ready to pass the state tests this spring. "I like 
the weight training," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The state fitness test, developed by the American Alliance for Health, Physical 
Education, Recreation and Dance, requires students to achieve passing scores in 
four events: a flexibility test, sit-ups, pull-ups and a mile walk-run. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles school officials last week said their districtwide results are 
unreliable because some schools did not complete all four parts of the test, 
which automatically gives the student a failing score. But the Portola test 
results, which are nearly twice the statewide passing rate of California 
ninth-graders, are considered accurate because all parts of the test were 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Cord, Portola's principal, said he was not impressed by his 
ninth-graders' performance until he compared it to scores statewide. Education 
officials agree that the results of the first-ever state fitness test show what 
has been long suspected, that today's youngsters are less fit than youth of 
past years. 
</P>
<P>
Even at Portola, where students are in far better shape than their counterparts 
statewide, performance pales in comparison to former Portola students. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids are in far worse shape than they were even 10 years ago," said Dufay, who 
has taught physical education at Portola for 20 years. "It's getting harder to 
motivate them because they have so many distractions: TV, video games. They 
don't ride bikes or walk as much because they get rides everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Dufay said, the physical education department recently relaxed the 
requirements for boys to earn the school's "Golden Trunks." In the 1960s, he 
said, 10 boys a year earned the honor. Now, he said, one or two boys a year 
qualify -- even with the relaxed requirements. 
</P>
<P>
But Portola's regimen, compared to most schools, remains tough. For years, 
physical education classes have included -- in addition to the usual team 
sports -- a daily mix of distance running, sit-ups and pull-ups for boys and 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
So it's no coincidence that students did well on the state test, because they 
practice all year. The students in the school's regular sixth- through 
eighth-grade programs share physical education classes with the school's highly 
gifted students, who come from neighborhoods throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
To pass the state test, 15-year-old ninth-grade boys are required to do five 
pull-ups, complete 35 sit-ups in one minute and run a mile in 10 minutes, 30 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
But to get an A grade at Portola, those same boys have to do 12 pull-ups, 65 
sit-ups in one minute and run a mile in six minutes, 10 seconds. To earn the 
school's Golden Trunks, boys have to do 16 pull-ups, 70 sit-ups in one minute 
and run a mile in five minutes, 45 seconds. Previously, students had to do 20 
pull-ups, run the mile in five minutes, 15 seconds, and do the same number of 
sit-ups. 
</P>
<P>
"They expect a lot from us here, and we try to do a lot," said Boris Chernin, a 
student in the school's program for the highly gifted. "The toughest part is 
the mile. Pull-ups are hard too." 
</P>
<P>
Chernin said he took the advice of teachers and bought a pull-up bar to 
practice at home. 
</P>
<P>
At least once a week, students at Portola run either the school's mile course 
or a two-thirds-of-a-mile course called the "mini-mile." Twice a semester, 
students are tested in the mile run, pull-ups and sit-ups. The school also 
offers weight training for students. 
</P>
<P>
Working the students hard is also hard work for teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot easier to just throw out the ball and let them play," Dufay said. 
"But most students just don't know what they are capable of doing unless they 
are pushed. When they see their times in the mile dropping, they get excited. 
They come back to us after a year or two and say, 'Thank you.' "

BANK OF SAN PEDRO IS CRITICIZED FOR UNSECURED LOANS; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: BANK'S ISSUANCE OF MORE THAN $1 MILLION IN LOANS TO ONE OF ITS 
DIRECTORS DRAWS REPROACH FROM FEDERAL REGULATORS AND SHAREHOLDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Bank of San Pedro -- a prominent financial fixture in that waterfront 
community -- has been criticized by federal regulators for issuing more than $1 
million in loans to one of its directors in apparent violation of federal 
banking laws. 
</P>
<P>
In a detailed disclosure in last month's annual report to shareholders, the 
bank acknowledges that director Steven G. Podesta, who holds 14.4% of the 
bank's stock, borrowed $1.04 million in six unsecured loans that federal bank 
examiners cited as apparent violations because they were "substandard" -- poor 
credit risks that could have deteriorated into losses. 
</P>
<P>
For several months, four of the loans totaling $479,000 were in default, 
according to the bank's report. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure has upset several former directors and shareholders, one of whom 
recently complained in a letter to the bank president that the Bank of San 
Pedro was established "to service the local area, not to form a 'piggy bank' 
for the directors." 
</P>
<P>
Podesta declined to discuss the loans, but bank officials have denied any 
impropriety, saying they have not been penalized and that the institution's 
financial standing has not been hurt. The four loans that were in default have 
been paid off, and payments on the other two are current, according to bank 
chairman Peter Mandia. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Podesta, who was a guarantor of the loans, did what was required," Mandia 
said, adding that he believes Podesta came under greater scrutiny because he is 
a major shareholder and director. "If these loans were made to individuals who 
were not associated with the bank they would not have been criticized." 
</P>
<P>
A Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. investigator said that, in general, all 
substandard loans are criticized but that such loans might not be cited as 
apparent violations of law if they are issued to ordinary borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
In its Oct. 6 proxy statement to shareholders, the bank also revealed that 
Podesta and three other directors -- Bill A. Moller, Thomas B. Jankovich and 
his son Thomas J. Jankovich, who stepped down from the board last month -- at 
one time last year held loans from the bank totaling as much as $6.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
That amount is equivalent to 66% of the bank's equity capital -- the money 
shareholders have invested in the bank. Equity capital is generally considered 
a bank's cushion or safety net. The bank reported total assets of $159 million 
at the end of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Although state law places limits on the percentage of equity capital that may 
be loaned to individual directors, there is no limit on what percentage of it 
may be loaned to all directors as a group. However, banking regulators and 
experts say that most banks loan far less than 66% of their equity capital to 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
Said one banking lawyer, asked by The Times to review the disclosure statement: 
"I wouldn't run my bank that way, but there are those who would disagree with 
me. If you look at well-performing, generally clean banks, you'll certainly 
find a much lower level of insider transactions." 
</P>
<P>
Neither the State Banking Department nor the FDIC -- both of which regulate the 
Bank of San Pedro -- would comment on their examinations of the bank. The FDIC, 
which levied the criticism of the Podesta loans, also would not say whether any 
further action will be taken. 
</P>
<P>
However, bank officials say the matter has been resolved to the FDIC's 
satisfaction. Banking industry experts say that if regulators had imposed 
penalties or issued a formal cease and desist order, it would likely have been 
disclosed in the October shareholders' report. 
</P>
<P>
According to the proxy report to shareholders, as of Aug. 31 this year the 
Jankoviches, Podesta and Moller owed the bank a total of nearly $5 million, an 
amount that constitutes about 43% of the bank's equity capital. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the Jankoviches, who operate marine fuel and water taxi businesses in 
Los Angeles Harbor, owed $1.7 million. Moller owed $1.9 million, and Podesta 
owed $1.07 million. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, bank President Lance Oak defended all the loans to directors 
-- including those that banking regulators had criticized -- saying the 
Jankoviches, Podesta and Moller "are all excellent customers." 
</P>
<P>
He declined, however, to provide details about the six Podesta loans that were 
declared substandard, except to say the bank did not believe they were 
substandard when they were issued. 
</P>
<P>
The substandard classification is the least severe of three designations bank 
examiners use to describe assets that are less than prime quality. The other 
classifications are "doubtful," which means there is a 50/50 chance that a loan 
will have to be written off, and "loss," which refers to loans that are 
uncollectible. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources say the criticism of the Bank of San Pedro comes at a time 
when bank examiners are placing increasing scrutiny on insider transactions. 
Since the crisis in the savings and loan industry -- which government auditors 
have said was in part precipitated by insider abuse -- government regulators 
have looked more closely at banks that do business with their own directors and 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
"A loan to an insider we expect to be squeaky clean," said Dick Condon, chief 
investigator in the FDIC's San Francisco office. "We simply do not like 
anything that gives the appearance of being self-serving." 
</P>
<P>
According to banking experts, it is not uncommon for banks to make loans to 
directors -- especially independent banks such as the Bank of San Pedro, where 
directors are often the major shareholders and largest depositors. 
</P>
<P>
They are also often the bank's best customers. As one banking lawyer said: 
"What the regulators look for is to make sure they haven't overdone it." 
</P>
<P>
Federal law requires that when banks loan money to directors, they do so on 
terms no more favorable than those available to the general public. Thus, 
directors who have good credit are often doing their own banks a favor when 
they borrow, because they might receive better terms elsewhere. But directors 
who do not have good credit can put their own bank at risk by borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Findley, publisher of the Findley Reports, a respected banking 
newsletter, said he believes "the best policy is not to make director loans. . 
. . You really eliminate compromising situations." 
</P>
<P>
But Findley said he has seen no evidence that insider loans have hurt the Bank 
of San Pedro, which in 1988 reported $159 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
For the past nine years, he has rated the bank a "premier performing bank," 
based on its loan quality, profitability and growth. About one-third of 
California's banks receive that distinction, he said.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: LAWNDALE ANTIQUE RADIO MUSEUM OFFERS A CONNECTION TO 
BYGONE DAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Hugo Martin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When you walk into Mac's Old Time Radio Museum in Lawndale, don't expect to 
find a spacious museum with air conditioning and track lighting. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is nothing more than an 18-by-25-foot section at the back of an 
antique shop on West 147th Street. But there are some real gems among the 130 
antique radios, phonographs and wireless sets on display. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, the 1937 Stromber Carlson chair-side radio with its controls 
set in a mirrored top. You don't find many of those lying around any more, says 
museum owner Charles MacQuarrie. Or how about the 1932 cathedral radio that was 
once owned by Dennis Day, the Irish crooner who regularly appeared with Jack 
Benny. That one was a lucky find, MacQuarrie said. 
</P>
<P>
And you don't have to be a radio buff to appreciate the 1929 grandfather clock 
with the built-in radio and record player. 
</P>
<P>
MacQuarrie -- everybody calls him Mac -- is a 67-year-old bespectacled man who 
has spent most of his life around radios. He and his wife of 45 years, Terri, 
opened the museum last month and believe it is the only antique radio museum in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
That may be the case, according to William Denk, the secretary and treasurer of 
the Antique Radio Club of America, who said he is not aware of any other such 
museum in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not a large number of radio museums," he said. "They are rather 
rare." 
</P>
<P>
Over the last 20 years, MacQuarrie said he has collected at least 1,000 radios, 
phonographs and wireless sets, which he keeps at his home and in storage. He 
repairs and restores each antique himself and sees to it that every radio on 
display looks and operates like new. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you start repairing and collecting some of those that I call the old 
basket cases, you become rather attached to them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
MacQuarrie said he finds most of his antiques, as well as the spare parts for 
them, at garage sales and swap meets. He strips the old varnish from cabinets 
and refinishes them. And he adapts many old battery-operated radios to run on 
household current. The process can take two days of full-time work. 
</P>
<P>
MacQuarrie's love for radios dates back to the 1930s, when his father was a 
wireless operator for the Boston &amp; Albany Railroad Line in Charlton, Mass. 
When MacQuarrie graduated from high school he joined the Army Air Corps and 
became a flight radio operator assigned to a B-24 bomber crew during World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
After the war he worked a short stint as a wireless operator with a commercial 
airline. But when voice-operated radios came along in the 1950s, MacQuarrie's 
job became obsolete. He went into the insurance business for 22 years before he 
retired 14 years ago and opened "Yesterday's Treasures" antique shop in 
Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
MacQuarrie said he decided to display his collection because it was "just time 
to share these with someone else." His museum is open Tuesday through Saturday 
11 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Since he began collecting radios, MacQuarrie said he has found that a great 
number of people share his interest. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has received calls from Sherman Oaks, San Diego and as far as 
Sacramento from people who want to buy a radio or have one repaired. 
</P>
<P>
"I've watched the interest in (antique) radios grow in the last 10 years," he 
said. "It's just phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
As their popularity grows, so does the price commanded by antique radios, 
MacQuarrie said. For example, a 1934 Coronado cathedral radio which originally 
sold for about $60 is now worth about $450, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not too long ago, MacQuarrie said, someone offered him $2,500 for the 
grandfather clock-radio. 
</P>
<P>
Although the shop sells some old radios, the items in MacQuarrie's museum are 
not for sale. The radios, phonographs and wireless sets that he so lovingly 
maintains must stay on the shelves, where MacQuarrie said he plans to preserve 
them for future generations. 
</P>
<P>
"They bring back a lot of memories for people," he said. Hugo Martin

DISTRICTS BOOST DAY CARE AS NEED FOR AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS GROW; 
</P>
<P>
CHILD CARE: WORKING, MIDDLE-CLASS PARENTS HAVE KILLED SOCIETY'S MYTH OF A HAPPY 
HOUSEWIFE WAITING FOR THE CHILDREN TO COME HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Vista, parents on their daily commute to jobs in Orange County or downtown 
San Diego can drop children at one of 11 child-care centers run by the public 
school district, instead of facing the prospect of leaving them unattended at 6 
a.m. on a playground. 
</P>
<P>
The Poway district runs 13 before- and after-school programs -- all with long 
waiting lists -- not only during school sessions but during holiday and summer 
breaks as well, and principals in almost all cases have worked to make space 
available despite crowded classrooms at many sites. 
</P>
<P>
In small districts from Solana Beach to Imperial Beach, from Escondido to El 
Cajon, school trustees and administrators have bitten the bullet on educational 
child care, realizing that too many children are going without a safe, 
supervised environment, often with severe consequences for their social and 
academic futures. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, these districts offer widespread, fee-for-service care for the 
growing legions of middle-class parents whose working lives have put the final 
nail in the coffin of society's myth of a happy housewife waiting for the kids 
to come home. 
</P>
<P>
In stark contrast, the San Diego Unified School District, the nation's 
eighth-largest urban system with a growing elementary-age student population, 
sits almost alone among its smaller neighbors with no comprehensive child-care 
despite clear evidence that many parents within its boundaries are eager for 
school-based programs. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Solana Beach district points with pride to its Child 
Development Center for children from 6 weeks of age through the sixth grade. 
The center serves children on a first-come basis, even if they do not live 
within the Solana Beach school boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, private San Diego child-care operators have run into continuing 
bureaucratic red tape trying to put a couple of bungalows at two of the city's 
107 elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
At Jerabek Elementary in Scripps Ranch, a proposed program by a private 
provider has been stalled for almost a year because of conflicts over whether a 
classroom trailer for the child care, if placed on the playground, will 
encroach slightly on the foul lines of a softball diamond leased to the city 
Park and Recreation Department. The conflict also involves differing opinions 
by members of the neighborhood's Community Planning Group over additional cars 
that might use streets because of child care. 
</P>
<P>
"For an urban system, we haven't been in the forefront of districts trying to 
facilitate child-care programs," San Diego city schools trustee Kay Davis 
conceded. Davis is pushing administrators and fellow trustees to get more 
involved in the issue. She sponsored a workshop for the board in late September 
to hear about the district's few successes and a host of horror stories about 
unsuccessful efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Davis served on a city committee earlier this year that looked into ways to 
encourage businesses to work with schools in providing child care. 
</P>
<P>
"A strong policy statement supporting child care" would make it clearer to 
school administrators that they should encourage activities at their sites, 
said David Poole, a Pardee Construction Corp. executive whose company has been 
among five developers trying to set up child-care centers at several Mira Mesa 
and Scripps Ranch elementary schools. Parents prefer school-based programs, 
child-care advocates say, in large part for safety reasons, since children do 
not have to be bused. 
</P>
<P>
Why have other county districts moved so much faster than San Diego Unified in 
addressing part of the countywide need for child care? -- especially with 
estimates from the nonprofit Childcare Resource Service that as many as 80,000 
San Diego children up to age 14 could benefit from some type of adult care? 
</P>
<P>
"Partly it is due to the smaller size of the outlying districts and partly it 
is due to a greater level of commitment on the part of people," said Sylvia 
Selverston, child-care coordinator for the private nonprofit Social Advocates 
for Youth (SAY), who has persuaded a dozen San Diego principals to rent her 
space for child care. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Brunkow, director of Childcare Resource Service, said, "Like everything 
else, you have to have somebody who wants to make it happen, to make a real 
commitment" to bring parents, teachers and principals together. 
</P>
<P>
Brunkow's counterpart in North County, Paula Leard, said that "teachers often 
are territorial, they don't want to give up their classrooms after school for 
someone else, since they consider it disruptive . . . the success of a program 
depends on where a district's priorities lie." 
</P>
<P>
Given the large size of the San Diego district and the lack of attention that 
trustees have paid to child care, decisions whether to offer the service have 
been left up to individual principals. Their approval is key when they are 
approached by private providers to consider lending a classroom or authorizing 
a special trailer. Even when there is agreement at the school, delays can 
result because of liability or building code questions. 
</P>
<P>
Although not discounting the unmet needs, San Diego administrators say that too 
many of their schools are crowded and that they cannot afford to give up a 
classroom or auditorium for child care. Programs at these crowded schools would 
require portable classrooms -- a more expensive proposition -- and only if 
adequate playground space is available. Also, they say that fee-for-service 
child care would mean that some families unable to afford $35 or so a week 
would be left out. 
</P>
<P>
(The San Diego system, using state funds, does operate 27 child development 
centers for 2,128 low-income preschool and school-age children, under a program 
begun in 1942 by the federal government when World War II forced large numbers 
of women into the work force. Those centers provide before- and after-school 
care. It also offers a handful of child-care programs at certain magnet schools 
as a carrot to white parents who agree to voluntarily bus their children to the 
predominantly minority magnet schools.) 
</P>
<P>
But Brunkow and several North County child-care providers said that problems of 
space, janitorial service and parking all can be worked out if those involved 
recognize research that shows child care can boost a child's chances for 
academic and social success. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Van Zant, Poway elementary principal and one of 12 California Educators 
of the Year for 1990, began her district's efforts nine years ago at Garden 
Road School. At that time, many parents would ask about child care each time 
they visited the school, since there were -- and still are -- too few private 
providers in the county to meet demand. 
</P>
<P>
Van Zant found a spare room at the school and piloted the first program. 
</P>
<P>
Now Poway has more than 1,100 children in child care out of about 9,000 
eligible from kindergarten through fifth grade. Parents pay all fees, which are 
$275 a month for the first child and $140 a month for the second. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a time when they do homework, when they play, when they have a snack, 
in essence doing things that are appropriate for kids, so that's why we call it 
extended learning and not just child care, because we are not baby-sitting," 
Van Zant said. 
</P>
<P>
Although some Poway schools use multipurpose rooms, at others there are 
trailers on the playground. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all paid out of fees," said Leslie Fausset, the Poway program 
coordinator. "A portion of the fees offset business costs, pay rent to the 
district and pay for additional custodial services. We just haven't had a lot 
of logistical problems, since I think that our principals, given the (board of 
education) interest, understand that day care is a critical, critical need. 
</P>
<P>
"The program began as a voluntary program, but when other principals saw it 
working well at the first schools, they were happy to embrace it. Sure, 
trailers or use of rooms before or after school cause some negative impacts, 
but the program is worth such minor negatives." 
</P>
<P>
In Vista, coordinator Linda Maag said that several principals realized the need 
after finding students already on the grounds when administrators arrived at 
6:30 a.m. to open the buildings. Vista uses existing space at schools, and Maag 
said that principals must often compromise on providing a spare room, 
especially since district enrollment has ballooned in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think we have come a long way in persuading administrators that 
educating a child before or after school in some cases is a responsibility as 
well," Maag said. Although most of the parents who participate are middle- to 
upper-middle class, as in Poway, Maag does have those who cannot afford the 
$25- to $40-a-week cost. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been applying for grants, under which I set aside a certain amount for 
low-income families, since we don't get any funds from the district itself," 
Maag said. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido has expanded its program from one to three schools this fall with 
encouragement from its school board trustees, but it still cannot meet the 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran a little into the bureaucracy at first," coordinator Gloria Bond said. 
"But we talked a lot with the principals. They have personal experiences with 
latchkey kids and realize that they must do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
All the North County programs are run directly by the school districts, as are 
those in La Mesa-Spring Valley, Lakeside, Santee and South Bay. Leard said 
district control can help avoid transportation problems and can allow districts 
to satisfy building and safety regulations directly through the state education 
code, without having to wait for often time-consuming municipal regulatory 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
Those municipal regulations have slowed down Pardee significantly in its effort 
to provide portables for the several Mira Mesa-area schools in San Diego. 
Pardee agreed to cover the construction costs for a private social-service 
operator, Harmonium Inc., in an area where it has built thousands of houses 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Because the San Diego district runs no fee-for-service care of its own, a 
private group such as SAY or Harmonium must meet additional codes and 
requirements should it wish to use a trailer at a school. If the district 
placed the trailer itself and then leased it to a private child-care operator, 
the red tape would be unnecessary, Selverston of SAY said. 
</P>
<P>
But, beyond codes, the lack of direction from the school board has left 
proposals by private operators pretty much up to the whim of a principal, both 
regarding trailers and in trying to use an existing classroom or auditorium 
before or after school. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure we (as the public) build the schools and we ought to be able to access 
the rooms, but I have to negotiate with the site administrator at each school" 
and overcome questions of territory, of parking, "of all these things," 
Selverston said. 
</P>
<P>
At Vista Grande Elementary in Tierrasanta, principal Alex Cremidan acknowledged 
that he and his staff were not too enthusiastic when SAY approached them 
several years ago with a survey showing the need for child care. 
</P>
<P>
"The area they wanted already was being used for special education resource 
study and also by our English-as-a-second-language students," Cremidan said. 
"So we held several meetings with SAY and with the parents, and came up with a 
plan to move the resource specialist out of the area, but to have a cooperative 
use of the area with the language students." The program is now successfully 
operating. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, teachers are apprehensive, but once you sit down and adjust to meet 
the needs of the community -- of the kids, really -- we can work things out, 
especially since the parents are really thankful that we are doing this." 
</P>
<P>
Walker Elementary in Mira Mesa is one of the schools with the new program run 
by Harmonium using a trailer provided by Pardee. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a million reasons that a principal could come up to say this thing 
wouldn't fly, but I decided to help out, I didn't want to be a detriment," 
Principal Gilbert Gutierrez said. "Sure it can be a headache, but there is a 
need for this. I have young children of my own, so let's go ahead and try to 
work it out." The program, only two weeks old, already has a waiting list.

TWO S.D. COUNTY BLAZES BATTLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One brush fire burned some 50 acres and another at least 150, but no 
firefighters were hurt fighting the two blazes Saturday, California Department 
of Forestry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Crews contained the first fire, which began about 1:10 p.m., to some 50 acres 
in Rice Canyon, a mile east of Interstate 15 and about six miles south of the 
Riverside County line, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Some 200 firefighters contained the blaze without damage to any structures, 
including a hut in the area full of dynamite, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Some 275 firefighters, meanwhile, hoped today to contain the second fire, which 
has burned 150 acres southwest of Lake Wohlford, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which began about 3 p.m., was only 35% contained by late Saturday 
night and reportedly was near buildings in the rural area east of Escondido, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No people were threatened, however, they said.

WATER AND GROWTH

Kudos goes to staff writer Bill Billiter for his perceptive articles expressing 
the "essence" of South County's water problems. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, yes! The initial water crisis was over by September for San Clemente and 
the other customers of the Tri-Cities district; however, the water shortage 
problems were not. 
</P>
<P>
Billiter's articles stressed the need not only for emergency conservation 
measures but also for a permanent allocation plan -- a plan urged and 
supported. After all, four customers shared a single, finite water source. They 
will continue to share a single supply. Yet San Clemente, the largest and 
fastest-growing customer, has not recognized the need for the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Projected additional supplies are not guaranteed, and reclaimed water 
facilities won't release enough potable water to satisfy future demands, 
according to staff. Where does the city go from here? Councilman Tom Lorch 
wanted to know too, the only council member to express concern about the 
growth-water issue. More's the pity.

TOUGH LESSON ON RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week, three Orange County football teams were stripped of their status in 
their respective playoffs, two of them for using ineligible players and the 
third for a fight among players after a game. Cruelly, the teams and their 
supporters careened between elation and despair as the issues were decided and 
re-decided in the courts -- prompting a judge in one of the disputes to say 
that pretty soon a good lawyer will be more important to a team than a fast 
tailback. 
</P>
<P>
When the dust settled, it appeared that one thing survived for better or worse: 
the rules. That is good, because a healthy respect for the rules of the game is 
one of the primary lessons that sports has to offer to youths. But, at least in 
one case, it seems that the penalty was harsher than was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
At two high schools, Huntington Beach and Savanna in Anaheim, highly successful 
seasons were marred by the discovery that there were ineligible players on the 
teams. At Savanna, one teammate had played too many semesters. At Huntington 
Beach, a player did not live in the district with a parent or guardian as 
required. Especially in the latter case, it appeared that the ineligible player 
simply did not understand the residential rule, nor did the school offer much 
guidance. Initially, a Superior Court judge ruled that the penalty of an entire 
forfeited season was unfair. But California Interscholastic Federation lawyers 
argued successfully in appellate court that if an exception were made for the 
youth, any school could "take a chance" and field a player and then seek 
eligibility later. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, however, with these two fresh examples, the CIF, which is made up of 
school principals, can come up with a more reasonable set of penalties. Instead 
of throwing away the season, the CIF could declare the guilty player ineligible 
for playoffs and strip the team of a home-field advantage. Or fine the school, 
or put it on probation, or remove the coach, or prevent the school from playing 
in its division the next year. 
</P>
<P>
But what also seems clear from last week is that students either do not 
understand, or think they can flaunt, the eligibility rules rightfully designed 
to discourage athletes from "shopping" for schools and control out-of-district 
recruiting. Coaches and principals need to walk them through the rules and 
explain that they are serving no one -- certainly not their teammates or their 
schools -- by violating them. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Anaheim-Garden Grove Chargers, who play in a league for 12- to 
14-year-olds, the penalty for fighting was appropriate. As the team's coach 
noted, the team learned "the hard way" that "there's no place for fighting on 
the football field."

MARCHING THROUGH THE CANYON TO PROTEST LAGUNA LAUREL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In regard to the Nov. 12 picture and article covering the Laguna Canyon Walk, 
The Times has done another disservice to to Laguna Beach residents. The picture 
with the "class war" placard dead-center is totally misleading in describing 
the canyon walk. 
</P>
<P>
The article was more accurate in describing the event, but your readers will 
look at the picture and think: There go those lunatics again. 
</P>
<P>
I am a gray-haired member of the establishment who joined other senior 
citizens, young parents, babies in strollers and bicyclists to make the 
statement that at some point we had had enough of scraped hills with thousands 
of look-alike houses. We want something left in its natural state without man's 
engineering it. 
</P>
<P>
I live on a street bordering the greenbelt. Whereas we used to see deer 
regularly, raccoon, skunk and an occasional fox, it is now almost a 
neighborhood celebration to see one roadrunner. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. does have a right to develop its land, but it also has an 
obligation to preserve the balance of nature. Rearranging hills, producing 
run-off that alters ground water levels are real threats to be considered. Who 
really knows what happens when millions of gallons of water from thousands of 
developed acres percolates through the soil down to the coast? Ultimately 
tinkering with nature produces long-term, far-reaching effects. 
</P>
<P>
This concern plus all those others that have been addressed in regard to 
pollution, congestion, etc., prompted this writer to say to (developer) Donald 
Bren on Saturday: "Please reassess your plans for Laguna Laurel."

A 'THANKS' FOR DOUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Driving down Laguna Canyon Road recently, my car ran out of gas in the middle 
of nowhere. I was there all alone. After sitting in my car for what seemed like 
forever, I decided to walk before it got too late. I heard something rolling 
over the pebbles behind me, and there was a man sitting on a bike. He rode to a 
phone, and in 30 minutes my family was there to get me. 
</P>
<P>
All I know about the man is that his name is Doug. I would like to say thank 
you.

Re the picture on the front page of The Times on Nov. 12: 
</P>
<P>
You did an injustice to the thousands of people who marched to save Laguna 
Canyon. The sign you chose to depict (Nov. 12) was the only one there referring 
to a "class war." 
</P>
<P>
The thousands marching and attending the rally were indeed "a well-mannered 
cross-section of Orange County's middle class . . . to protest plans for more 
than 3,000 homes and a golf course in pristine Laguna Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
This is not a class war. This is a war between the people of Orange County, 
wanting to preserve some nature and the beauty spots of our environment, and 
the developers and elected officials, supporting insensitive development. 
</P>
<P>
Our tolerance limit has now been reached, and it is time for all Orange County 
residents to take a stand to save their remaining environment.

PROPOSALS FOR SOLVING COUNTY'S TRAFFIC JAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The citizens of the entire state, not just Orange County, need to come to grips 
with what faces us in the future. We need to develop well-planned rail systems 
that will serve us in the 21st Century. These systems cannot be built with 
half-cent tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
We need to raise gasoline taxes to whatever it takes to build these systems of 
the future. We have become spoiled on the relatively cheap prices of gas 
(adjusted for inflation, it is cheaper today than it was in 1965). This only 
encourages us to avoid car-pooling or using rapid-transit systems. Why wait for 
OPEC to dictate the price of gas or, worse, until we have exhausted the supply 
of fossil fuels? 
</P>
<P>
Raising fuel taxes would force all of us to become fuel-efficient. Car pools 
would become very popular, and we would stop thinking in terms of driving 
alone. Because there would be less traffic, work would be accomplished more 
expeditiously along freeway routes, and with proper funds available, a 
centrally designed rail system, interchangeable throughout the state, could be 
developed. Ecologically, we cannot continue to spew the waste products of our 
automobiles into the environment at our current pace. 
</P>
<P>
There is little doubt that the Orange County traffic problem will become worse. 
No one will watch it happen with more glee than I. Because only when we are 
faced with a crisis do we respond. When we finally reach a point of complete 
gridlock, I have no doubt that emergency legislation will be enacted, or 
desperate propositions offered. Then we will build the systems that have been 
needed for so many years.

Stan Oftelie ventures that ("After Measure M's Defeat. . . ." Nov. 12), "with 
some prudent revision" the 20-Year Master Plan of Transportation Improvements 
might win voter approval in a countywide election. He supports this risky 
proposition with the same puffery that doomed Measure M and Measure A before 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Prudent revision will not be enough. Starting with the Orange County 
Transportation Commission itself, a major overhaul of Orange County's road 
building system is in order. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-member commission is currently made up of County Supervisors Thomas 
F. Riley, Roger R. Stanton, and Harriett M. Wieder and Tustin City Councilman 
Richard B. Edgar, Brea Councilwoman Clarice A. Blamer, and Anaheim Councilman 
Irv Pickler. The supervisors appointed themselves, and the League of Cities 
appointed the council members. The seventh member, Dana Reed, a Newport Beach 
attorney, was appointed by the other six commissioners. Obviously the 
commission is a second, part-time job for all of its members. None has any 
transportation expertise and, as far as transportation issues, they do not 
report to anyone, not even the voters. They depend on Oftelie (an 
ex-journalist) to tell them what to do, and at an annual salary of $106,000, he 
is the county's highest paid executive. 
</P>
<P>
In the 11 years since its formation, the commission has spent more than $23 
million asking the voters to approve two sales tax increases. Both failed 
because Oftelie and the commission are completely out of touch with what a 
majority of the voters wants and are willing to pay for: more general purpose 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature created the present commission system in 1977. Now it is time 
for the Legislature to replace it with a full-time commission directly elected 
by the voters. The new commission's budget should be tied directly to the total 
road building funds allocated to the county. And to prevent future costly 
off-year tax increase elections, that give developers an opportunity to buy 
their way in, the new commission should not be allowed to make any law or 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Enough is enough and sometimes, enough is too much.

MARCHING THROUGH THE CANYON TO PROTEST LAGUNA LAUREL PLAN

Re Laguna Laurel: Irvine Co. spokesman Larry Thomas was dead wrong when he 
stated that the 7,000 to 8,000 protesters in Laguna Canyon on Nov. 11 
"represent a narrow, single-issue group." 
</P>
<P>
My husband and I, from Brea, walked with others from Newport Beach, Orange, 
Huntington Beach, Los Angeles, Costa Mesa, Silverado and Trabuco Canyon. We, 
and the thousands of other protesters, are not only concerned with keeping 
Laguna Canyon free from tract housing but are also very concerned about rapid 
overdevelopment throughout all of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
There are simply some places in Orange County that should be preserved in their 
natural state: Laguna Canyon, Trabuco Canyon, Silverado and Modjeska Canyon, to 
name but a few. Orange County does not need subdivisions in its canyons. Orange 
County needs to preserve its heritage and some of its beautiful natural lands, 
not only for us to enjoy, but for the plants and wildlife that were here before 
us. 
</P>
<P>
If Orange County residents want to continue to enjoy the quality of life this 
area is known for, we must insist on responsible development: Save the Canyons!

DON'T BE FOOLED BY MARKET MUMBO JUMBO

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who says newspaper editors don't have a sense of humor! The lead article of 
your business section asks rhetorically, "Are Stocks for Gamblers Only?" (Oct. 
22). 
</P>
<P>
Your apologist gives a convoluted answer, saying that for the last 62 years 
stock investments yielded a higher total return than all other investments. 
This argument ignores a basic consideration stated in every mutual fund's 
portfolio: Past performance is never a guarantee of future success. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Sing supports his argument with phony statistics used by stockbrokers to 
lure customers: "low annual average volatility" of the market. This is a 
deceptive concept bordering on fraud and is a completely meaningless figure. 
</P>
<P>
Then on your third page, guest columnist Martin Mayer really answers the 
question about gamblers: The market is manipulated by a pack of speculators, 
swindlers, arbitragers and other assorted crooks, while the SEC idly watches as 
the laws are broken left and right. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer's article answers Sing's question more realistically: Unless the SEC 
cleans out the den of thieves on Wall Street, no statistical mumbo jumbo will 
lure back the individual investors.

THE AIR FARE PUZZLE; 
</P>
<P>
SOME CONTEND THAT AIRLINE MERGERS AND DEREGULATION HAVE REDUCED COMPETITION AND 
BOOSTED PASSENGER RATES. SHOULD CONGRESS INTERVENE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Melanie Pickett , Times researcher 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recent reports from the General Accounting Office and Department of 
Transportation contend that reduced competition, anti-competitive practices and 
capacity limits are raising airline fares. In response, Sens. John C. Danforth 
(R-Mo.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) recently introduced the Airline Competition 
Enhancement Act. The bill would seek to increase competition by requiring 
airlines to sell their computer reservation systems, extend to the airline 
industry the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair competition, 
revise the current system of takeoff and landing rights, and allow local 
airports to tax passengers to finance airport expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 To gather opinions on issues raised by the bill, Times researcher Melanie 
Pickett interviewed Alfred E. Kahn, a Cornell University professor and chief 
architect of airline deregulation while former chairman of the Civil 
Aeronautics Board, and Michael E. Levine, dean of the Yale University School of 
Management and former staff member of the Civil Aeronautics Board. Also 
included are statements from Danforth and testimony from Robert L. Crandall, 
chairman of American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Should airlines be subject to antitrust regulations under the Federal Trade 
Commission Act? 
</P>
<P>
Danforth: Airlines are no longer regulated, so the only way they are governed 
is through competition. They should play by the same antitrust laws as other 
industries. Applying the FTC Act to airlines will allow airlines that suspect 
they are the target of unfair pricing techniques to seek relief from the FTC. 
It would also enable them to challenge dominant carriers' control of terminal, 
gate and baggage handling facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn: When we deregulated the airlines, we certainly did not intend to exempt 
them from the antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
Should passengers be required to pay a new tax tacked on to their ticket price, 
to finance airport construction? 
</P>
<P>
Levine: It is, on the whole, not a bad way to raise money. My concern is that 
cities have a monopoly over their own airports (and) cities often have 
political agendas other than expanding their airport capacity. The port 
authority in New York has for years used the airports as a source for all kinds 
of things, whether it was jobs for politically favored contractors or financing 
a fleet of buses for their rapid transit system. . . . My prediction would be 
that most authorities would raise money from the taxes, use some of it to 
expand airports but siphon a fair amount of it off. 
</P>
<P>
Crandall: Personally, I have no philosophical objection to passenger facility 
charges so long as the enabling legislation contains adequate safeguards to 
preclude their use for any purpose other than airport development. I do 
believe, however, that any such charges ought to be part of a cohesive pattern 
of taxes and user charges at both the federal and local levels to ensure 
adequate capital investment in the airports and airways system. 
</P>
<P>
Should takeoff and landing rights (slots) at airports be reallocated to allow 
entry of other airlines? 
</P>
<P>
Danforth: In 1985, we saw one of the great government giveaways of all time 
when the Department of Transportation gave airlines, without charge, the slots 
they were then holding. The DOT allowed them to buy and sell these scarce 
rights, which have commanded prices of up to $1 million each. . . . Slot 
holders know that without a slot, no competitor can enter a market with one of 
these four airports (Chicago's O'Hare, Washington's National and New York's 
Kennedy and LaGuardia) as an end point. Small or medium-sized airlines cannot 
afford slots, and even if they could, those holding them will not sell. 
</P>
<P>
Our bill would eliminate the buy-sell rule and recapture the windfall that was 
given the dominant airlines in 1985 by taking the slots back and auctioning 
them off. The proceeds of the auction would go for airport expansion, which 
will help eliminate capacity problems at overcrowded airports. Also, it would 
encourage new entry by giving entrants slot preferences and limiting the number 
of slots any airline can own. 
</P>
<P>
Crandall: The fact that operations are limited at four so-called high-density 
traffic airports by means of a slot requirement is a national disgrace. It 
exemplifies the monumental failure of the federal government to fulfill its 
responsibility of developing an airport and airways system capable of handling 
the growth in air transportation brought about by deregulation. . . . While we 
are not opposed to the entry of other carriers into slot-controlled airports, 
the withdrawal of slots from incumbents is neither equitable nor an appropriate 
method of achieving that end. 
</P>
<P>
A much better approach would be to compel the FAA to add one slot per hour at 
LaGuardia and National -- the two airports at which there is unsatisfied demand 
by new entrants and small incumbents. . . . The slots provided in this fashion 
would appear to be sufficient to meet the needs of new entrant and small 
incumbent carriers without disrupting the schedules of other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn: Various studies, including those by the GAO and the testimony by the 
airports people, seem to clearly show that a company is not going to sell its 
slots to a competitor. I'm not at all clear why it's the airline companies that 
should be permitted to pocket the benefits of scarcity that was created because 
there are inadequate slots. It gives an enormous financial advantage to the 
companies who happen to be there first. 
</P>
<P>
Should computerized reservations systems (CRS) be removed from control of 
individual airlines? 
</P>
<P>
Danforth: Department of Transportation studies have found that travel agents 
favor CRS-owning airlines in booking flights. . . . The CRS-owning airline can 
outmaneuver its competitors because it updates its own fare and seat 
availability in the system more quickly than its competitors' information. CRS 
owners charge non-owner airlines a booking fee of about $2 a flight segment. 
This gives the CRS-owning airline an annual subsidy of $300 million from (its) 
competitors. If a fledging airline attempts to create its own CRS, it finds 
that the travel agents have contracts that severely penalize them for switching 
from one CRS to another. 
</P>
<P>
Crandall: The view that competition is lacking in the CRS business has always 
puzzled me. . . . Although SABRE (American Airlines' system) continues to be 
the largest CRS vendor with a market share of approximately 37%, that fact 
should hardly be surprising since we pioneered the development of the business 
and have consistently offered a system that is technically superior to some of 
the others. 
</P>
<P>
Even if American's ownership of SABRE does give it some competitive advantage 
as an airline, is that a reason for divestiture? Every airline has some 
competitive strengths, just as every airline has some competitive weaknesses. 
Many airlines enjoy a much lower cost structure than American because they pay 
lower wages and offer fewer benefits to employees. Others enjoy a competitive 
advantage in the form of higher yields because of the less competitive 
composition of their route systems. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn: American Airlines points out that originally they proposed and were in 
favor of computerized reservations systems' being developed by the industry in 
concert. It's one of the dumbest things the Department of Justice ever did in 
saying they wouldn't look kindly on that. It may well be that the provision of 
computerized reservations is best organized as a monopoly serving everybody.

ROGER SIMON: THE EXIT POLL: NEWS BEFORE IT HAPPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ROGER SIMON

<TEXT>
<P>
In the old days, television brought us news soon after it happened. 
</P>
<P>
The event would be captured on film and that film would be rushed to the studio 
where it would be developed and edited and broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
But "soon after it happened" was not fast enough. Not by a long shot. Tape 
replaced film and that helped. Developing was no longer necessary and editing 
was faster. 
</P>
<P>
And then came satellites. You could broadcast live from anywhere on earth. 
Television could bring us news as it happened. 
</P>
<P>
Which was not fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
The next step was inevitable: TV began to bring us news before it happened. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, this was condemned. "Media events" were considered unethical. 
A famous example occurred in the '60s when a TV network staged a pot party at 
Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., as part of a story on the drug 
crisis in America. (Stories never change on TV. Just hair styles.) 
</P>
<P>
Staged events are now banned on every TV station in America. Except in one 
case. On Election Day, the media get to stage news. They get to create it. 
Invent it. And broadcast it. 
</P>
<P>
These staged events are called polls. 
</P>
<P>
Polls are pseudo-events paid for by news organizations. A poll is not something 
that occurs in nature that the media cover. A poll is news created by the media 
for the media to cover. 
</P>
<P>
Polls have been done by the print media for a very long time. But a special 
kind of poll was invented by TV. 
</P>
<P>
TV did this because it found that on Election Day, reality was too slow. 
Democracy was too slow. 
</P>
<P>
On Election Day, people had to go out and vote. This took hours. In some cities 
and states, voting didn't stop until 8 or 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
And then the votes had to be counted! TV couldn't wait that long. TV stations 
had fancy sets and million-dollar tote boards and big multicolored maps. But 
what TV stations didn't have was the vote results. So they decided to buy some. 
</P>
<P>
And the exit poll was born. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, pollsters went out and asked people how they voted. Then 
they fed these figures into carefully (ha-ha) constructed "models" and 
projected the outcome of the race. 
</P>
<P>
It was perfect for TV. Stations could broadcast the results seconds after the 
polls closed (or even before if they wanted to). 
</P>
<P>
No longer did television have to wait for democracy. Television was bigger than 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
An exit poll should never be wrong. It is not an opinion poll. It is based on 
how people actually cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
But a funny thing has been happening over the past few years: Exit polls have 
begun to turn out wrong. In the recent elections in Virginia and New York City, 
the exit polls were way off. 
</P>
<P>
And the next day, the pollsters howled. I saw one on TV talking about people's 
"dishonesty." People had "lied" to the pollsters, he said. Maybe there should 
be a law against this. Maybe people should be locked up. 
</P>
<P>
What never occurred to this dweeb is that people are sick of pollsters in 
America. That people are sick of being asked intensely personal questions by 
complete strangers. 
</P>
<P>
The secret ballot is supposed to be sacred in this country. But exit polls 
destroy the secret ballot. 
</P>
<P>
A person grabs you as you leave the polling place and demands to know how you 
voted and why. "You voted for the black guy? Why? You didn't vote for the black 
guy? Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
Maybe some people don't want to answer these questions. 
</P>
<P>
I know some who don't ever want to talk about whom they voted for: reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Try asking a reporter whom he voted for and he will gulp and turn red and shake 
his head and tell you that is nobody's business but his. 
</P>
<P>
And then he will go off to deliver the exit poll results. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, people are lying to pollsters. And they have every right to. It is the 
proper punishment for somebody trying to invade your privacy: Why refuse to 
answer so the pollster can go and bother somebody else? Why not just tell the 
pollster a lie so he will be as embarrassed the next day as you are now? 
</P>
<P>
There is no need for exit polls. In a few hours, the real results will be 
known. But TV does not want to wait for reality. Reality is too slow for TV. 
</P>
<P>
Exit polls also try to impose order and rationality on an act that may be 
neither orderly nor rational. Maybe you cast your ballot based on emotion or 
whim. 
</P>
<P>
That's fine. The Constitution allows for that. 
</P>
<P>
But pollsters don't allow for that. Pollsters want reasons. Highly detailed, 
deeply analytical reasons. Reasons you never dreamed of. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you vote for George Bush because Mike Dukakis took a ride in a tank and 
looked unpresidential?" they asked after the last presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
Well, gee, some people never thought of that. But it sounded logical. "Uh, 
yeah, I guess so," some said. 
</P>
<P>
And it got marked down. And the results got tallied. And there were stories 
about how the tank ride "doomed" Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
It became reality. Whether it was true or not. 
</P>
<P>
Pollsters plant ideas. Pollsters invade privacy. Pollsters create false 
"realities." Pollsters get things wrong. 
</P>
<P>
But you can always count on them for one thing: They always announce their 
results with absolute certainty. 
</P>
<P>
So remember this: 
</P>
<P>
How many pollsters does it take to screw in a light bulb? 
</P>
<P>
Two. Plus or minus four.

'THERE IS HOPE' FOR THOSE WHO MUST WAIT

Re: "Getting a Grip on Geriatrics," by David Larsen (View, Nov. 12): 
</P>
<P>
This is not an apology for those in the medical profession who neglect their 
patients, for whatever reasons. But as one who sees medical treatment given on 
a daily basis, there is hope! 
</P>
<P>
The only time our waiting room overflows is when an emergency patient has taken 
longer than expected, or treatment, such as a biopsy, must be administered 
immediately. This is always explained to those waiting. Our doctors value their 
patients' time; our patients realize this. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe I have been fortunate, but the offices I have worked in have always 
treated all patients with dignity and respect, regardless of age, race or 
financial status.

J. PAUL GETTY MUSEUM: LOCATION: 17985 PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY, MALIBU

Millionaire oilman J. Paul Getty in 1954 purchased a large ranch-style home on 
65 acres in Malibu, in which he opened a museum to display art objects he had 
been collecting. As his collection grew, Getty built a new museum, designed as 
a reconstruction of a Roman seaside villa that was buried in an eruption of Mt. 
Vesuvius in AD 79. Completed in 1974, the museum contains 38 galleries of art, 
including antiquities from Greece and Rome, as well as Renaissance and Baroque 
paintings and French decorative arts.

NASA technicians struggled to make up 12 hours in lost time to keep the space 
shuttle Discovery on schedule for the start of its countdown to a launching 
Wednesday on a secret military mission. Work to fix a booster control unit and 
a hydraulic leak led to the delay. The countdown was scheduled to begin at 4 
p.m. today, the same time that the shuttle's crew was expected to arrive at the 
Kennedy Space Center in Florida for final preparations.

Hundreds of anti-abortion protesters took part in a second day of 
demonstrations in the Washington area to test a federal law barring such 
demonstrations in front of abortion clinics. Twenty-six protesters were 
arrested and several injuries were reported at the Hillview Clinic in Suitland, 
Md., police said. During the demonstration by Operation Rescue, some of the 500 
people on both sides of the abortion issue smashed a pane of glass as they 
pressed against the doors of the clinic. Scuffles broke out, causing several 
injuries. There were also large anti-abortion protests in Houston and 
Indianapolis.

CLASSICAL MUSIC RADIO: WHAT'S NOT TOO STUFFY AND YET NOT TOO HIP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The same week that venerable classical music station KFAC-FM changed into a 
rock station, KUSC-FM (91.5) was featuring a two-week tryout by Canadian 
broadcaster Jurgen Gothe. And the out-of-towner's informal, lighthearted style 
raised many an eyebrow among L.A. classical music aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
"In the very week of the demise of KFAC, the Jurgen Gothe afternoon show is a 
veritable satire of the worst tendencies of pre-1987 KFAC: tasteless 
eclecticism, fatuous and overlong chitchat between selections, cutesy-pie 
programming conceits and, God help us, movements from symphonies and 
concertos," an angry listener wrote KUSC. "How can you so misunderstand your 
listeners?" 
</P>
<P>
KUSC program director Tom Deacon explained: "We were experimenting. It's fun to 
experiment." 
</P>
<P>
As part of that experiment, the station began playing less classical music and 
introduced a new entertainment magazine-style talk show in the afternoons. 
Specials featuring rock musicians David Byrne and Frank Zappa and the ragtime 
music of Scott Joplin pushed the likes of Vivaldi, Beethoven and Stravinsky off 
the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
The intent was to lure an as-yet-untapped audience: "those 25- 45-year-old 
people who go to all those good restaurants on the Westside and aren't really 
interested in classical music," said KUSC general manager Wallace A. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to figure out how to break down the barriers that keep people away 
from classical music, and that includes trying to find good music from other 
genres that appeals to people who are not currently classical music lovers, " 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the other side of town, KKGO-FM (105.1), formerly an all-jazz 
station, has inserted eight hours of classical music into its schedule. A play 
list is being selected and records and compact discs are being compiled to 
prepare for the station's debut as a 24-hour classical station in January. 
</P>
<P>
KKGO general manager Saul Levine said he doesn't intend to play much in the way 
of avant-garde music nor will he mix musical genres in the way that KUSC is 
doing, but he does want to draw -- you guessed it -- a younger audience. 
</P>
<P>
"The quickest way to drive away an audience is to play something that's atonal, 
unfamiliar and in that vein," he said. "We are going to play some avant-garde 
music, but (the play list) will be primarily the great classical, romantic and 
baroque music. We're not going to lighten things. We're not going to play 
semiclassical or pops or popular versions of Broadway music." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said his is not the only station in the country that has expanded its 
narrow focus. "I think radio in general should reach out to the largest number 
of people it can serve," he said. "It's only good stewardship of public 
resources to reach as many people as you can possibly reach with your radio 
service." 
</P>
<P>
This quest for a larger audience of younger listeners seems to have altered the 
face of classical music radio as it was known here for more than half a 
century. And it has touched off a ratings war. 
</P>
<P>
In targeting the younger audience, KUSC and KKGO appear to be gearing up to do 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping that we can bridge this terrible gap, the gap that seems to exist 
between classical music and a whole audience group that doesn't seem to be 
coming to classical music radio or coming to the Philharmonic or to classical 
music period," KUSC's Deacon said. 
</P>
<P>
Although public radio KUSC is pursuing this audience more aggressively and 
blatantly with its eclectic repertoire and emphasis on "radio personalities" 
rather than musicologists, commercial station KKGO has also rejected 
musicologists for its staff, fearing that any suggestion of pretentiousness and 
an academic presentation will alienate potential listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary thing that we'll be doing to get more mass appeal is to present 
classical music in a non-stuffy manner," Levine said. "This has been one of the 
biggest drawbacks, the impression of elitism and that you have to be a 
musicologist to appreciate it. It's the talking down. We don't do that. We'll 
just present it in a straightforward manner. It's not going to be taken like 
medicine or castor oil." 
</P>
<P>
But many of those who dearly love the music vehemently hate KUSC's new 
approach, and the station has been deluged with protest letters. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't stand Mr. Gothe's patter, his seeming fondness of his own voice, his 
playing of bits and pieces of "light classics" replete with the next best thing 
to commercials," wrote one listener. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said: "I'm getting an awful lot of hate mail about this -- let's say I'm 
just having a very vigorous dialogue with our listeners. The listeners that 
were most bothered by it were the long-term KUSC listeners, the hard-core 
classical music aficionados who really want a very pure classical music format. 
The people most outraged by what I'm doing are the ones who want to keep it 
elite. I think we ought to open it up and bring more people in because I think 
Beethoven and Mozart would love it. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people believe that they can't listen to classical music because they 
don't know enough," Smith said. "The people who are real classical music fans 
reinforce that by sort of ridiculing people who don't like or don't understand 
music that they listen to." 
</P>
<P>
Former KUSC announcer Rich Capparela agrees with some of Smith's remarks: "My 
philosophy is unstuff classical music radio by being human, by not taking it so 
seriously and at the same time having the necessary respect for the music." 
</P>
<P>
However, he believes that the timing of the programming changes was unwise. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are having trouble with the timing of KUSC's move forward 
coinciding with KFAC's demise," Capparela said. "It's been rough on listeners." 
</P>
<P>
Smith is worried that the classical music audience will eventually turn off the 
radio and confine their listening to compact discs. And he is determined to try 
to stave off that eventuality. To avoid that, and to keep listeners from 
abandoning his station, Smith has determined that KUSC should sound like most 
of the popular stations on the dial. 
</P>
<P>
"Our characteristics include an emphasis on personality, spontaneity and 
companionship," Smith said. "When we hire people we are going to look for ones 
who are radio personalities rather than classical music announcers." 
</P>
<P>
Said program director Deacon: "What I want is people to talk on the air the way 
they do in person; then I feel we'll be able to knock down a lot of the 
barriers that people, particularly young people, feel against classical music," 
</P>
<P>
Capparela -- a classical music announcer for 18 years who is now a deejay for 
soft-hits station KJOI (98.7) -- says he is not certain that a casual, top-40 
radio style of announcing will work. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that's appropriate for all formats," he said. "I don't know that 
classical music lends itself to (such deejay patter as) 'Hey, nice Spandex, 
babe'. . . . Certainly classical music has still got a lot of trappings of 
stuffiness, of pretentiousness and a lot of that does need to go, but as with a 
lot of things, it's the degree that counts." 
</P>
<P>
Along with playing selections that are not traditionally classical, KUSC 
listeners will hear shorter pieces of music, movements rather than whole works, 
as well as more talk (or as Smith puts it, "more opportunities for radio 
personalities to entertain and inform and inspire people"). That doesn't 
translate to big-money giveaways or trivia contests, but it does mean more 
chatter, more news and information and less music. There will be some giveaways 
featuring tickets to classical concerts, operas and ballets, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
At KKGO, a half-dozen announcers -- most of them 30ish and non-musicologists -- 
have been hired. Mozart's image is emblazoned on promotional T-shirts with the 
KKGO call letters. "It's appealing to 20-year-olds, very appealing," Levine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the youth campaign, Levine has formed an alliance with UCLA under 
which KKGO, starting in December, will broadcast a Royce Hall program that had 
been heard on KUSC. Levine also plans to work with area schools sometime after 
the station switches from its current all-jazz to all-classical in January. 
</P>
<P>
"I have personal friends in their late 30s who are devoted classical music fans 
and listeners," Levine said. "Obviously there are people in their 60s, 70s and 
80s who listen to classical music and obviously one day they'll be lost. But 
classical music enjoyment is a matter of exposure. I don't think anyone is born 
appreciating it." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that research on public radio shows that one way to draw listeners 
to classical public radio stations is to provide top-notch news and information 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've discovered in public radio particularly is that the growth is not 
amongst the classical music stations," Smith said. "Growth in public radio is 
around the news and information stations. News is bringing new listeners to 
public radio, and classical music is staying flat. . . . The consensus is that 
we cannot continue to do what we're doing if we want to be able to serve new 
audiences with classical music programming because we're static, we're 
stagnant." 
</P>
<P>
However, not all public stations regard classical as a moribund format. KCSN-FM 
(88.5), a tiny public station affiliated with Cal State Northridge, on 
Wednesday changed its current programming from all-country to all-classical, 
said the station's general manager, Ken Mills. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears as if classical is clearly a viable alternative," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
The station has only about 1,000 listeners per average quarter-hour period, 
according to Arbitron ratings survey data, and cannot be heard beyond the San 
Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, Mills said. Still he is considering the 
change because of the dissatisfaction expressed to him by disgruntled KUSC 
listeners. The station will confine itself to "traditional and familiar" 
classical fare, Mills said. "We are not going after a particular demographic. 
We'll take listeners of all ages." 
</P>
<P>
"Because we're not so much in the ratings game we can look at it more as 
serving a valid audience from a standpoint of just listeners and their 
interest, as opposed to a particular demographic sell," Mills said. "There are 
a lot of older classical listeners out there, so it would probably be smart on 
our part to try to incorporate as many as we could." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps KCSN will attract the longtime KUSC listeners who are threatening to 
tune out as the station works at enticing younger audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"It's simply driving us away into purchasing our cassettes and CDs," said Ellen 
Stern Harris, who co-chairs the Committee for Classical Music a Los 
Angeles-based organization with about 500 members formed after the demise of 
KFAC to promote the classical music radio. The committee wants a public hearing 
by the station's board of directors on the issue. "This whole concept where 
every day whether you like it or not you have to listen to Scott Joplin or 
Philip Glass is simply absurd. When a whole audience was waiting for a 
classical need to be met, Wally Smith decided to walk away. . . . He's ignoring 
the group that is dedicated to classical music." 
</P>
<P>
"This cute deejay concept is wonderful if you want adolescents. But those of us 
who have enjoyed the music for the sake of music and don't listen to KUSC for 
constant chatter or lengthy personal comments on subjects totally unrelated are 
continually irritated," Harris said. "It has enraged the audience." 
</P>
<P>
Countered Smith: "There's a rather small number of people who are so rigid and 
stubborn who won't support us while we try to search for ways to enlarge our 
audience." 
</P>

Long identified with tobacco and -- since the movie "Bull Durham" -- with minor 
league baseball, this city is moving to become a major jazz mecca with the 
drive to build the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, affiliated with Duke 
University. 
</P>
<P>
"We've become one of the more talked-about places in jazz," said Paul H. 
Jeffrey, a saxophonist and longtime Monk associate now teaching at Duke. 
Despite his role as a driving force in the jazz explosion, the astonished 
Jeffrey said "I don't know how that happened myself." 
</P>
<P>
Monk, the gifted pianist and composer known as "the High Priest of Bebop," died 
in 1982 at the age of 63. Best known for " 'Round Midnight" and "Brilliant 
Corners," he is the subject of a new 90-minute documentary, "Thelonious Monk: 
Straight No Chaser." 
</P>
<P>
When plans for the institute were announced in 1988, Thelonious Monk Jr., 39, a 
Brooklyn, N.Y., drummer, characterized the project as a step toward 
"collectively carrying on the sincere commitment that Thelonious Monk made to 
young musicians. It is historically appropriate that the institute be located 
in Durham, and affiliated with Duke, for Thelonious was born less than 100 
miles away in Rocky Mount, N.C." 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal of the institute, said Thomas R. Carter, the executive 
director, is nothing less than producing "a whole new generation of jazz 
musicians." 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking to turn out players," Monk said. Together with the institute and 
the documentary, he said, his father's music has recently enjoyed "almost a 
second, cult coming. He was always seen to be a conduit, a center of the 
universe. People always seemed to pass through Thelonious Monk on their way to 
higher ground -- and the institute is just a natural extension of that." 
</P>
<P>
The Monk Institute will be a four-year, independent institution accredited by 
the National Assn. of Schools of Music and will grant performance degrees, 
according to Carter. The first class of 35-40 students is scheduled to enter in 
1992. Earlier this week, Monk and Carter met with USC officials to explore the 
additional possibility of having Monk Institute students spend a year of study 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Current plans call for a three-building complex in Durham, one of which is a 
70,000-square foot academic facility, including classrooms, a library with 
Monk's papers and a museum with his instruments, rehearsal halls, a recording 
studio and 500-seat performance hall. The remainder of the $12-million complex 
would be a student dormitory and living accommodations for visiting faculty. An 
architectural design competition for the institute is under way at Howard 
University in Washington, D.C., and ground is scheduled to be broken within 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Durham city and county have enthusiastically embraced the institute, 
appropriating $750,000 to purchase a 1.62-acre site in the downtown area 
earlier this year. Mayor Wib Gulley called the institute the city's "crowning 
touch" of artistic activity, complementing a new arts center near the site, 
which includes the restored, 1,200-seat Carolina Theatre, nearby convention 
center and Omni Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
An endowment of $50 million, enabling many of the estimated 150 students to 
attend tuition-free, is also planned. Most of the funds will come from private 
and corporate sources, said Jeffrey, who also serves as vice chairman of the 
institute's academic council, but additional help from the city, county and 
state, as well as Duke, are also expected. Between $500,000 and $1 million has 
been raised so far, school officials say. Proceeds from this year's 3rd annual 
Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition held this weekend in Washington, 
D.C., are earmarked for the conservatory. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, a concert at Duke to "introduce" the institute to the community 
featured Steve Allen and Jayne Meadows, Clint Eastwood -- executive producer of 
"Straight No Chaser" -- Clark Terry, Percy Heath and Thelonious Monk Jr. Three 
months later, a fund-raising concert at the Omni featuring Dizzy Gillespie and 
Wynton Marsalis and hosted by Bea Arthur and Rue McClanahan of NBC's "Golden 
Girls" drew 900 people to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning this January, the institute will be kicking off a two-year series of 
fund-raising concerts in New York, Los Angeles, London and Tokyo, Carter said. 
The goal, Monk said, is to raise money from the corporate and private sector, 
including the broader community of jazz lovers. 
</P>
<P>
A partial list of members of the institute's advisory board reads like a Who's 
Who of jazz aficionados from the worlds of music, sports, entertainment and 
politics: Art Blakey, Wynton and Branford Marsalis, Jimmy and Percy Heath, Herb 
Alpert, Dizzy Gillespie, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Cosby (honorary chairman), 
Debbie Allen, Billy Dee Williams, Marla Gibbs, U.S. Sens. Robert Dole and Wyche 
Fowler, former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and Martin Luther King III. 
</P>
<P>
"By getting the community outside the musicians excited, the musicians have 
become excited," Monk said. "It has snowballed. It has become so real in the 
minds of the artists in this medium. It's important for America . . . When we 
came up with the idea of building a school it just seemed to be appropriate to 
absolutely everyone. There was a tremendous hunger out there for something like 
this. We have structure. What we're doing is unlike a lot of things in jazz. 
It's become believable. It seems do-able, plainly do-able to everyone 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a jazz conservatory, Jeffrey said, grew out of an observation read 
at Monk's 1982 funeral by jazz historian and critic Ira Gitler, that Thelonious 
Monk's stature in the jazz community paralleled that of Beethoven in classical 
music, because he was a maverick genius. 
</P>
<P>
That observation piqued the interest of Maria Fisher, founder of the Beethoven 
Society, when some Monk cousins approached her in Rocky Mount, N.C., where 
Fisher was hosting a society event. She took up the idea of creating a "living, 
vibrant memorial surrounding Thelonious' name," said Carter, who was then the 
Beethoven Society's executive director. "From this it evolved from a project to 
honor Thelonious Monk to the first conservatory in the world for jazz 
musicians," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carter eventually took on the position as executive director of the Monk 
Institute along with his duties with the Beethoven Society. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how small this idea began," said Monk. "It was very modest." But 
"right after the idea began to fly," Monk said, he signed up to be the 
institute's "chief fund-raiser and front man," putting aside his own career as 
a jazz and rhythm and blues recording artist to become chairman of the 
institute. Since then, he said, the effort has "consumed my life." 
</P>
<P>
After a preliminary search for sites that included Rocky Mount, Durham, New 
Orleans, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Detroit and Los Angeles -- both USC 
and UCLA were considered -- attention returned to Durham and to Duke. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past dozen years, Duke had quietly been turning itself into "Jazz U," 
picking on an earlier tradition that included undergraduates Les Brown, Pat 
Williams and Sonny Burke. In 1977, Frank Tirro, then chairman of the music 
department and later author of "Jazz: A History," invited pianist, composer and 
arranger Mary Lou Williams, known as "the Queen of Jazz," to become the 
university's artist-in-residence. 
</P>
<P>
Williams taught a perennially oversubscribed history of jazz course, as well as 
individual tutorials, and composed several masses for All-Saints Day services 
in Duke's soaring Gothic chapel. At graduation ceremonies in the spring of 
1981, days before her death, she received the university's Trinity Award for 
"significant service to the university and to humanity." Later, a campus black 
cultural center was named in her honor. A plaque on the wall reads "Dedicated 
to the memory of Mary Lou Williams, who lived music and loved people." 
</P>
<P>
An annual Mary Lou Williams Jazz Festival was also established on the campus in 
1983. That same year, Paul Jeffrey joined the Duke faculty after commuting from 
Rutgers University to teach part time in the music department. 
</P>
<P>
"I came down to teach the jazz history class and fell in love with the campus 
and Duke University," Jeffrey said last month, before a Mary Lou Williams 
festival concert featuring McCoy Tyner. Today, Jeffrey teaches full time, and 
despite a shoestring budget the Jazz Studies program attracts more than 200 
students in one capacity or another, including the Duke Jazz Ensemble, which 
Jeffrey leads. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Monk and Carter came to take another look at Durham as a home for 
the institute, Jeffrey and other boosters had lined up key local allies. Chief 
among these was heiress Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans, a Duke family descendant 
and university trustee, as well as the strong-willed fairy godmother of nearly 
every good cause in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"She never let up," Carter said. "She brought in a very heavy lobbying effort," 
including Republican Gov. James G. Martin and Democratic U.S. Sen. Terry 
Sanford, who is also a former Duke president. 
</P>
<P>
Semans, whose foundation helped underwrite both the cultural center and jazz 
festival named for Mary Lou Williams, then arranged a meeting with Duke's 
president, H. Keith H. Brodie, for herself, Jeffrey, Monk and Carter, where the 
group had quite a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"We literally fell out of our chairs," Jeffrey recalled, when Brodie said that 
he was familiar with Thelonious Monk's music. "He named a particular record and 
said that that was one of the records that started him listening to jazz," 
Jeffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
Brodie assured them that he "wholeheartedly supported the project," Jeffrey 
said. "He said that presidents like to leave a legacy. He said he would like 
to, as his legacy, be able to say that the first jazz conservatory -- 
full-fledged jazz conservatory in this country -- was affiliated with Duke 
University." 
</P>
<P>
"Duke University really wanted it for the right reasons," Monk said. "Some 
institutions wanted it because of the high profile, the glitter. But this thing 
is really about education. That's what Duke and Brodie were interested in." 
</P>
<P>
Another thing that made Durham attractive, Carter added, was that it was away 
from the potential distractions of too many clubs and agents in some big cities 
like Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more of a Tanglewood environment," Carter said, referring to the summer 
music festival in Massachusetts, a place that "would enable the students to 
totally concentrate on their music." 
</P>
<P>
"Duke University is perfect," Monk said. "The Carolinas are perfect. If you 
want to learn you have to be in a learning environment. We have to create the 
kind of environment where you eat and sleep jazz . . . It's important to us 
that we had a place where our students couldn't be immediately whisked away by 
the industry. You don't want to lose your students before they graduate." 
</P>
<P>
The details of the relationship between Duke and North Carolina Central 
University -- a historically black state school in Durham -- have yet to be 
worked out, but as Jeffrey envisions it, Monk students could take non-music 
courses at Duke and North Carolina Central, and Duke students could take 
non-performance courses at Monk and at North Carolina Central. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very comfortable landing in Durham," said Monk. "Thelonious was born in 
North Carolina. I know that sounds corny, but the setting is right. The respect 
begins sometimes with the location. It's a wonderful educational environment. 
The environment is ideal."

CLINT EASTWOOD PERSUADED WARNERS TO COME UP WITH A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS FOR

<P>
The story of the making of "Thelonious Monk: Straight No Chaser" took a lucky 
turn about two years ago, when a pair of documentary makers hooked up with one 
of the most powerful men in the movie business. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in Kansas City, doing research for the film 'Bird,' " jazz fan and 
one-man film industry Clint Eastwood recalled, "when I happened to see a poster 
on the wall at the Musicians' Union, advertising a film called 'The Last of the 
Blue Devils.' I went to see it, and was very much impressed by all this classic 
footage Bruce Ricker had put together with Count Basie and other musicians of 
the Kansas City era. 
</P>
<P>
"I contacted Bruce and asked if he'd be interested in my helping with the 
distribution. I got Warner Bros. to release it in France and other places where 
it had never been seen. Later on, Bruce came to me and said, 'We have this 
astounding material on Thelonious Monk; would you like to see it?' 
</P>
<P>
"I had never seen Monk in person, but of course I knew his records and had 
followed him through those same years of which Bird was a part. I liked what I 
saw so much that when it turned out Bruce and Charlotte Zwerin needed 
financing, I went to Warren Lieberfarb, who's the head of Warner Home Video, 
and told him I thought this was a worthy project." 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood became executive producer of the project, and Warners came up with 
$400,000 to purchase the footage and to pay for the music rights. 
</P>
<P>
The result: a poignant new 90-minute film about the legendary pianist and 
composer. Already a hit in New York, where it has been running for eight weeks, 
"Straight No Chaser" opened Friday at the AMC Century City 14. 
</P>
<P>
Thelonious Monk was a brilliant, eccentric and enigmatic figure who worked only 
sporadically and whose best known tunes were all written in the 1940s (" 'Round 
Midnight," "Well You Needn't," "Ruby My Dear," "Straight No Chaser"). In 1964, 
he enjoyed his 15 minutes of fame with a portrait on the cover of Time 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The film, which inexplicably neglects to make use of the title tune, brings the 
man and his music into sharp focus, from live performances to poignant comments 
by his son and others about his frustrations, his international successes, and 
his bouts of deep depression and hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
Since Monk's death Feb. 17, 1982 -- at the end of a decade of near-total 
retirement and seclusion -- there has been a flood of recordings of his tunes 
by other artists, along with countless reissues of his own albums. With such 
honors as an international piano competition named for him and a conservatory 
for jazz studies under his name now in the planning stages, Monk, like Charlie 
Parker, is more fully recognized posthumously than he ever was in his lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
"I began thinking about the Monk film when he was still alive," said Charlotte 
Zwerin, who directed the film and co-produced it with Bruce Ricker. "I didn't 
realize how ill he was in those last years. But then there was a lucky 
accident. In 1981, Bruce Ricker bumped into Christian Blackwood, who mentioned 
that he and his brother Michael had all this early footage on Monk. Bruce was 
shocked. He called me, and we started trying to raise money for this project." 
</P>
<P>
A music lover since childhood, Zwerin collaborated with Albert Maysles and 
Susan Froemke on "Horowitz Plays Mozart" and recently on "Jessye Norman Sings 
Carmen." She co-directed the acclaimed feature length documentary "Gimme 
Shelter" which examined the Rolling Stones' 1969 concert at Altamont. A few 
years ago, during a stint at NBC, Zwerin produced a 20-minute film called 
"Woody Herman, Road Father." 
</P>
<P>
"I had just finished making 'The Last of the Blue Devils,' about Kansas City 
jazz," Ricker said, "when I found out that in 1967 and '68 the Blackwood 
brothers had followed Monk around on the road for six months, in the studios, 
at home and in various cities, for a German documentary. They shot 14 hours of 
film and edited it down for a cinema verite special on West German television. 
It was shown just once in Germany and had been lying around unused and 
forgotten ever since. I worked out an agreement with Christian and Michael, 
then brought Charlotte into the picture." 
</P>
<P>
The search for funding was an arduous problem that began in 1983. The National 
Endowment for the Arts came through with a $50,000 grant in 1985, but more 
money was needed. There were unexpected difficulties, one of which was the 
discovery that the Monk family had sold the rights to the name for a film 
called "Music in Monk Time," in which Monk did not take part. 
</P>
<P>
To the Blackwoods' documentary material was added a series of interviews with 
Monk's longtime saxophonist Charlie Rouse; with his personal manager, Harry 
Colomby, his road manager, Bob Jones, and with the Baroness Nica de 
Koenigswarter, the wealthy patron in whose home in Weehawken, N.J. Monk spent 
the last decade of his life (but wife Nellie Monk visited him there often and 
was with him when he died). 
</P>
<P>
"This is an instance of something done by people who had their heart and soul 
in it, and when that happens, you know they're going to give it their best 
shot," said Eastwood. "They did a fine job and it was fun for me to be 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
One of the very few faults in the movie is its failure to seek out from other 
musicians who worked with Monk and knew him well, most notably Art Blakey, Milt 
Jackson and Sonny Rollins. 
</P>
<P>
Nellie Monk, anguished over the death in 1984 of her 30-year-old daughter, was 
reluctant to be involved with making the film and did not want to be 
interviewed; however, she trusted her son, Thelonious Monk Jr., to take care of 
the family's interests in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Monk, a 39-year-old drummer who worked with his father from 1970 
until his final public appearance in 1976, wound up becoming a moving force 
behind the picture. "Charlotte and Bruce did a bang-up job," he said. "I told 
them a lot of things that I and my mom would like to see in it, and they put 
everything in the proper perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"This film will provide a great opportunity, particularly for people who never 
saw Thelonious. He always inspired people; now he can continue to inspire them, 
even though he's not here."

THE EXORCISMS OF WILLIAM FRIEDKIN; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER 16 HITLESS YEARS, THE 'FRENCH CONNECTION' AND 'EXORCIST' DIRECTOR SEEKS 
TO TURN HEADS AGAIN WITH 'THE GUARDIAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Long before "Batman," before "E.T.," before "Star Wars," and even long before 
"Jaws," there was "The Exorcist." Buzzing with word of Linda Blair's head 
spinning full circles on her neck and those repulsive streams of green vomit, 
moviegoers lined up on the streets of 1973 America like never before, just for 
the chance to feel their stomachs turn flip-flops in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
"The Exorcist" broke house records in theaters everywhere. In some towns, 
fevered fans shattered glass doors to get in. Lines for even the midnight 
showing of the movie snaked through the sidewalks of Westwood like a boa 
constrictor wrapping itself around its prey. The lines grew even longer when 
the press reported that people were fainting in disbelief. One women, the 
legend goes, had a miscarriage while watching the film, which, some claimed, 
reached right up inside you, twisted your guts, made you squirm, cringe and 
cling fiercely to the arm of the stranger beside you. The bravest of men 
covered their eyes and shrieked out loud. 
</P>
<P>
And, like no so-called horror film before or since, "The Exorcist" grabbed 10 
Academy Award nominations and actually won two Oscars. If Robert Redford and 
Paul Newman hadn't been so cleverly charming in "The Sting," it probably would 
have won a bunch more. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, William Friedkin, "The Exorcist's" 34-year-old director who had 
already scored an Oscar for his direction of "The French Connection" two years 
earlier, stood at the top of the cinematic world -- right beside Coppola, 
Scorsese and Kubrick. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 16 years, three marriages and six hitless films later, Friedkin stands in 
a puddle of simulated blood, swatting away the mosquitoes that congregate 
around his baby-eating, blood-spurting, hydraulic-powered tree -- the tallest 
and most horrifying star of his latest film, "The Guardian." 
</P>
<P>
Such is the stuff of a career in film making. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the experience of making films. I love the mud. I love the dirt. I love 
all the inconveniences. That's why you do it," he says, on the set of his first 
return to horror since he terrified audiences with "The Exorcist." "If you do 
it because you're looking to be the Great American film maker, you're liable to 
experience disappointment. I have never experienced disappointment on any of my 
films because they all have great memories for me, even some of those that have 
done less well than others." 
</P>
<P>
Thinking he had come as close to his "vision" as he might ever come, it took 
Friedkin several years to attempt another film after the "The Exorcist." Though 
"Sorcerer," a spectacular remake of H. G. Clouzot's 1952 thriller, "The Wages 
of Fear," drew critical raves, it also proved to be a spectacular disaster. The 
movie cost $22 million, a big-time budget in 1977, but it grossed less than $6 
million at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
"Friedkin's career as a director has yet to recover," the editors of the Motion 
Picture Guide, an encyclopedia of film, wrote about "Sorcerer." "Though he 
bounced back slightly with the likable 'The Brink's Job' in 1979, his 
subsequent films ('Cruising,' 'Deal of the Century' and 'To Live and Die in 
L.A.') have been wretched efforts artistically and for the most part financial 
flops." 
</P>
<P>
Of his 1985 film "To Live and Die in L.A.," his last foray into mainstream 
movie making (his 1987 film, "Rampage," has been lost in the shuffle of the 
DeLaurentis Entertainment Group's financial troubles), the Motion Picture Guide 
comments: "Friedkin has become a parody of what he was, and is now little more 
than a glorified MTV director." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the mud and the blood of his latest effort, clad in blood-splattered, 
drawstring surgical scrubs and a T-shirt, Friedkin, 50, refuses to look back 
with regret. As blood oozes out of "The Guardian's" mechanical tree and he 
dodges a spongy limb that shoots like a missile from its trunk, Friedkin 
maintains that the only difference between making a hit movie and making a 
series of flops is "you get less money to make your next picture." 
</P>
<P>
"I have never dragged my tail and said, 'Aw shucks' when things went badly, nor 
have I said, 'Look what I just did' when it works. The life of a film maker is 
one film to another. You get on with it. There's a great reward when you 
connect with the public and people are lining up around the block to see your 
film. But the real joy is making the film. And if you want to make films, you 
find a way to make films. One day, if I make 'Citizen Kane,' which by the way 
was a flop in its day, then I would quit a happy man." 
</P>
<P>
But doesn't it gnaw at him that he was once revered and acclaimed and now 
labors in comparative obscurity? Doesn't it wear on his ego, his pride? 
</P>
<P>
"Four times you've asked me that and my answer is still the same," Friedkin 
snaps. "I never considered myself the great American anything. Not then and not 
now. I consider myself just another member of the crew, the highest paid member 
of the crew. Winning the Academy Award (and the Directors' Guild Award for 
1971's "The French Connection") was an enormous honor. But I thought I had won 
it prematurely, that I hadn't paid enough dues at that point." 
</P>
<P>
Friedkin even insists that bombing miserably, as he did with "Cruising," the 
much reviled and sexually graphic 1980 film starring Al Pacino, that showed a 
dark and violent side of the gay underground, hasn't made it more difficult to 
persuade a studio to hire him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always difficult to get a film made. The most difficult time I ever had 
was with 'French Connection.' Nobody wanted to make the picture. It got turned 
down by every studio twice (before going on to win five Oscars including best 
picture of the year)." 
</P>
<P>
The notorious path of his Hollywood career out of the way, Friedkin hungrily 
dives into a discussion of his film-making style, peppering his soliloquies 
with references to Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the late French author Georges 
Simenon and the films of Vincente Minnelli, Stanley Kubrick and Michelangelo 
Antonioni. 
</P>
<P>
He takes obvious pride in his prologue to "The Exorcist," a masterful cinematic 
sequence of images and sound, shot on location in Iran, that introduces the 
conflict between the priest and the demon and sets the frightful atmosphere 
that pervades the rest of the film. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all sound and mood, those things are what make a film, the detail," 
Friedkin explains. "What makes a story is what Simenon said, the way the light 
plays on a character's nose, not the philosophical idea that the character is 
expressing. What I did was try to take all the hard meaning out of that 
sequence and concern myself with detail. I was setting people up to sit on the 
edge of their seat for the rest of the movie. That's what I hoped to do." 
</P>
<P>
Friedkin's films are at their best when he sets the audience on the edge of its 
seat. It's not the actual horror of "The Exorcist" or "The Guardian," which is 
scheduled for release this spring, that fascinates him, he says. It's the 
suspense, the anticipation of danger or evil or the unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested in people who live without alternatives, whose backs are to the 
wall. What unites all my films -- 'The Night They Raided Minsky's,' 'The Boys 
in the Band,' 'Cruising,' 'French Connection' -- I think, is that they all 
involve people living on the edge of very intense situations that are forcing 
them into irrational behavior and a kind of last chance reaction to life. I 
guess it's because I find that situation in my own personal life very often." 
</P>
<P>
Friedkin, who was married to French actress Jeanne Moreau and British actress 
Lesley-Anne Down and is now married to KNBC-TV news anchor Kelly Lange, 
declined to elaborate on exactly when and where he has encountered such 
desperate situations in his own life. Although when praising "Fatal Attraction" 
as the best horror/suspense film of recent years, he deadpans, it's "a scary 
movie for all of us who have committed adultery in our lives." 
</P>
<P>
Though several of Friedkin's films have a strong documentary flavor, he 
contends that the true-to-life situations depicted in such movies as "Fatal 
Attraction" have to be "heightened" or sensationalized to help people remove 
themselves from the horror of the story. Friedkin says, for example, that the 
situation portrayed in "The Guardian" is like that, too. It presents a 
situation in which a young couple hires a nanny to care for their baby who 
turns out to be "the instrument of evil" for the infant-devouring tree. He says 
it is so primal and suspenseful that it could easily be told without any 
supernatural hocus-pocus. Friedkin points out that his own interest in the 
film, which is based on the 1987 novel "The Nanny," was born out of his own 
"horrifying" experiences with some of the people he hired to look after the son 
he had with Lesley-Anne Down. 
</P>
<P>
"But I remember being persuaded by the studio that without the supernatural 
element, the story is too real, too disturbing, too close to the bone," 
Friedkin says. "The supernatural element in a story like this or 'The Exorcist' 
gives the audience a chance to distance themselves from the horror of something 
like that actually happening to your 12-year-old daughter. That would be a 
documentary, but you would be repelled by it because there is no fictional 
distance." 
</P>
<P>
The cinematic razzmatazz inherent in occult-laden movie making, however, often 
overshadows the more substantive elements of the films. "The Exorcist" is 
acknowledged as a terrific movie, but what people often remember most about it 
are the special effects and the makeup. Friedkin concedes that because of the 
homicidal tree, "The Guardian" is likely to be classified, at least initially, 
as a typical horror film, even though what intrigues him most is directing the 
edge-of-your-seat interplay between the couple, played by Dwier Brown and Carey 
Lowell, and the nanny, played by Jenny Seagrove. 
</P>
<P>
Then why bother with the gimmicks? 
</P>
<P>
"The special effects are very important," Friedkin insists. "In (Garcia 
Marquez's novel) 'One Hundred Years of Solitude,' when the little girl dies, 
the bed sheets in the back yard wrap around her and lift her up in the sky. 
That's a wonderful effect from that novel that I remember as being really 
transcendent, but it isn't the whole book. 
</P>
<P>
"This film has a number of set pieces like that, mostly at the end. Creating 
the environment in which these unexplainable things take place concerns me more 
than what we're shooting now with the tree. Although what were shooting now has 
to be totally convincing on the screen or the whole picture is ruined." 
</P>
<P>
Friedkin means it. An admitted perfectionist, he fired the special effects team 
that had been working on "The Guardian" for seven months and shut down 
production for three weeks while the replacement crew built a new tree from 
scratch. Though Friedkin admits that the delay was expensive, he maintains that 
he will finish the picture on its $10-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
"Special effects are often trial and error," he says. "The first go we had with 
them was error, now we're doing it and it's trial. It isn't easy to just order 
them up. It's not like saying, 'Make me 12 of those shirts.' You can't just 
say, 'Make me a supernatural tree that does the following things.' The people 
who did it for seven months probably did the best they could, but it didn't 
work. Now it works." 
</P>
<P>
That kind of meticulous concern for detail affects more than just the crew. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my 20th movie, and I've never seen anyone go frame by frame like he 
does," says Joe Wizan, producer of "The Guardian" and such films as ". . . And 
Justice for All" and "Jeremiah Johnson." "He is convinced that if you lose or 
add just one frame it will make a difference in the visceral effect. It's 
fascinating. Most people don't work that way. It drives the producer crazy." 
</P>
<P>
"The studio has been totally supportive," Friedkin chimes in. "They realize 
that everything is for the betterment of the picture. It's not a whim of mine. 
This is not 'Heaven's Gate.' If they thought I was wrong, I'd hear about it 
real fast, and if I didn't adjust, I wouldn't be here for this interview." 
</P>
<P>
Universal executives declined to answer questions about Friedkin's track record 
or the current film. 
</P>
<P>
Friedkin insists that he has always aimed his films for the widest possible 
audience, then stood back in amazement the few times he has actually hit. The 
problem, he says, is that no one, except maybe Steven Spielberg, who Friedkin 
says has some kind of "mystical, oracular connection with today's audience," 
knows what works and what won't. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens is what happened to (German rocket scientist) Wernher Von Braun, 
whose autobiography was titled, 'I aim at the stars and sometimes hit Dresden,' 
" Friedkin says. "I always aim at the stars and sometimes I hit Dresden. But I 
set out, as Wernher Von Braun did with every rocket, to take it to the moon." 
</P>
<P>
Friedkin, who says he was enamored of films as a small child, started out as 
documentary film maker, but realized early on that audiences for such films are 
especially tiny. He made his first feature, "Good Times" starring Sonny and 
Cher, in 1967 when he was 27. 
</P>
<P>
"In my day, film making was the art for young people to aspire to. Today, young 
people aspire to music. They want to play guitar in a rock band. When I grew up 
. . . to be a side man in Harry James' band, who cares? But, today, you want to 
be in Guns n' Roses or you want to be on tour with Sting." 
</P>
<P>
So, considering that such young people make up the bulk of today's movie-going 
public, is it even more difficult for a 50-year-old director like Friedkin to 
hit it big? Many of today's wildly commercial directors, Robert Zemeckis, Tim 
Burton, Tony Scott and Adrian Lyne, all came of age cinematically after the 
George Lucas-Steven Spielberg "Star Wars/Close Encounters" movie revolution -- 
a film era that emphasizes pure visual images and glosses over most everything 
else. Is it possible that these visually flashy directors are simply more in 
tune with the tastes of today's MTV-weaned movie audience? 
</P>
<P>
"Possibly," Friedkin says hesitantly. "It definitely is more difficult (for me) 
to make movies today because the age of the audience has changed and 
perceptions of what is a good movie has changed. Today, the kind of movies that 
are successful are a hell of a lot different than the kinds of movies that were 
successful when I came up."

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In late 1985, Shirley Lampel was a woman in anguish. Her husband had just died, 
and years of suffering from diabetes had left her without sight in one eye and 
only limited vision in the other. 
</P>
<P>
The one ray of hope was financial. Her doting husband, Sy, an auto mechanic, 
had left a $30,000 life insurance policy. Prudently invested, it would help 
support her modest but comfortable life in Santa Maria, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
But Lampel reckoned without Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan and Arizona 
home builder Charles H. Keating Jr., who had acquired the thrift the year 
before. As a result of what she thought was a rock-solid investment with 
Lincoln, her savings were devoured in what was to become one of the great 
financial fiascoes of American history -- one that could eventually cost 
taxpayers about $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"Lincoln gives a whole new definition to bank robbery," a bitter Lampel said 
recently. "It used to be that a person puts on a mask and goes in with a gun 
and robs a bank. Now we go into the bank and we get mugged. When did the bank 
become the crook?" 
</P>
<P>
That's not how Keating and his subordinates see it. But what they did was use 
Lincoln's millions of dollars in federally insured deposits as new money for 
his cash-hungry real estate and financial empire. Shunning traditional home 
mortgages, they channeled the S&amp;L's funds into huge tracts of raw land in 
Arizona, luxurious hotel projects, a portfolio of junk bonds and other 
speculative ventures, according to federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Now, federal and state investigators, regulators and lawmakers are poring over 
the details of Keating's activities. Already, regulators have filed a civil 
racketeering lawsuit accusing Keating and other Lincoln executives of 
squandering $1.1 billion in federally insured deposits through a series of 
"illegal, fraudulent and imprudent acts." The suit and other documents allege 
that Keating and his associates sought to evade regulatory restrictions on such 
investments by making bogus loans to "straw" property buyers. 
</P>
<P>
They also devised a tax plan that let them divert $95 million to Lincoln's 
parent company by creating "phantom" profits through sham land swaps and loans, 
the regulators allege, and used accounting gimmicks, legal maneuvering and 
political string-pulling to further their operations and slow down 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Ethics Committee decided last week to appoint an outside counsel to 
investigate Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and four other senators who accepted 
large campaign contributions from Keating and then intervened with regulators 
on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the ultimate cost to others, Keating and his associates sold about 
$200 million in now-worthless debt securities to unwary customers such as Mrs. 
Lampel at Lincoln's branch offices. Many of the purchasers were elderly 
Southern Californians who thought the securities -- issued by Lincoln's parent 
company -- were federally insured. 
</P>
<P>
Keating has repeatedly denied the government's charges. He has accused 
regulators of seeking revenge against him, harassing his employees and failing 
to understand real estate development. That, not his own actions, drove Lincoln 
to ruin, he says. 
</P>
<P>
As a longtime home builder and mortgage lender, he said, his operation always 
has concentrated on single-family housing. He simply turned Lincoln, an 
institution whose financial health was questionable when he bought it, from a 
mortgage lender into a company that prepared raw land for residential 
construction, and he had a number of projects successfully built, he 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the various government investigations ultimately disclose, it is 
already clear that Lincoln is one of the worst disasters in the nationwide 
savings and loan debacle. 
</P>
<P>
Began as Lawyer 
</P>
<P>
Keating, a collegiate gold medal swimmer in the Pan American Games and a Navy 
fighter pilot in World War II, began his business career as a lawyer in 
Cincinnati. In a conservative business community that traced its antecedents to 
the days when the Ohio River was the key to settling the American heartland, 
Keating stood out as an aggressive risk-taker and a stubborn competitor. 
</P>
<P>
He was once described by his brother, William, as an "impatient" person who 
never worried about the popularity of his positions. 
</P>
<P>
Also, he showed an early taste for combining business with politics. In the 
political arena, he became a vociferous opponent of pornography, aiding 
prosecutions, lobbying elected officials. He was even appointed to a federal 
commission that studied pornography. 
</P>
<P>
And he managed his brother's successful congressional campaigns in 1970 and 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Keating pursued a career in real estate development that 
eventually made him a top executive in a firm owned by wealthy Cincinnati 
financier Carl H. Lindner, who specialized in making aggressive takeover bids 
for other companies. The close association they developed continued long after 
Keating left Cincinnati in 1976 to take over a foundering Lindner real estate 
development firm in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
A few years after moving West, Keating had his first serious brush with federal 
regulators. In 1979, Lindner and Keating consented to a Securities and Exchange 
Commission order prohibiting them from fraudulently diverting corporate assets 
to their personal use. 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1980s, Keating -- riding the tide of explosive growth in the Sun 
Belt -- had built the former Lindner construction firm, renamed American 
Continental Corp., into one of the nation's 10 biggest home builders. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he -- like others -- had noticed a new opportunity: Congress, trying 
to rescue a savings and loan industry saddled with traditional low-rate, 
long-term home mortgage loans in an era of soaring interest rates, was 
dismantling the web of federal regulations that had always circumscribed the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Under deregulation, banks and S&amp;Ls were allowed to place a part of their 
assets in direct investments such as ownership interests in real estate 
projects and other ventures, instead of just making loans on which they would 
collect interest. They were also allowed to place customer funds in high-yield, 
high-risk "junk" bonds and other non-traditional investments. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate developers saw the thrifts as ideal sources of cash for their own 
ventures. They liked savings and loans better than banks because they had 
broader investment powers and were cheaper to acquire. In addition, the rules 
required thrift owners to put up only $3 of their own cash for every $100 in 
S&amp;L investments. The capital requirement for banks was twice as high: $6 
for every $100 in assets. 
</P>
<P>
California was an especially tempting target for such takeovers. In an effort 
to prevent state-chartered savings and loans from converting to federal 
institutions, California had enacted an even more liberal deregulation law than 
the federal government. In 1983, the state allowed thrifts to put 100% of their 
money into direct investments. 
</P>
<P>
From his headquarters in Phoenix, Keating spotted a California thrift that 
seemed ideal for his expanding purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan was an Orange County thrift that had experienced 
losses in the early 1980s, but it had returned to profitability by the end of 
1983. Keating bought it in February, 1984, for $51 million. At the time, 
regulators say, they were assured that Lincoln's previous management and 
lending policies would be retained. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Keating transformed the traditional mortgage lender into a 
post-deregulation dynamo. Indeed, he said he bought Lincoln to take full 
advantage of California's deregulation law. 
</P>
<P>
Keating ousted the old executives, turned away from the S&amp;L's traditional 
areas of business and began seeking bigger profits from riskier strategies: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He used Lincoln's deposits to buy huge tracts of undeveloped Arizona desert 
in an effort to create shining new communities from dust. The most ambitious of 
those projects was Estrella, a 20,000-acre planned community 20 miles southwest 
of Phoenix that was to include 50,000 homes for 200,000 residents as well as 
retail, industrial and office space. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He assembled parcels of land in the affluent Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale 
to build a $296-million luxury resort hotel called the Phoenician Resort. He 
also bought the Hotel Pontchartrain, a troubled hotel in downtown Detroit, and 
initiated elaborate renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He used Lincoln funds to buy junk bonds and dabble in foreign currency 
trading. He bought big blocks of stock in other companies, prompting 
speculation that he might be a budding corporate raider. 
</P>
<P>
He even sold the home-building unit of American Continental as he created a 
complex organization with 55 subsidiaries primarily devoted to real estate 
investment and development. 
</P>
<P>
Efficacy in Doubt 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, meanwhile, some were beginning to question the efficacy of the 
government's prescription for the ailing thrift industry. Edwin J. Gray, whose 
position as chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board made him the nation's 
top savings and loan regulator, was one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Across the country, S&amp;Ls were using their customers' money to acquire 
stakes in windmill farms, restaurants and a host of other businesses they knew 
little about. Such investments, far from returning the industry to health, were 
bringing new losses so huge they threatened the solvency of the federal deposit 
insurance fund. 
</P>
<P>
Gray began speaking out. What's more, he proposed a rule to require all 
federally insured thrifts, including state-chartered S&amp;Ls such as Lincoln, 
to limit direct investments to 10% of their assets. 
</P>
<P>
Keating for one was furious. As he describes it, he had barely gotten into the 
S&amp;L game and already the rules were changing. Arguing that Gray's proposed 
restriction would destroy the industry, Keating began lobbying hard against it. 
</P>
<P>
He hired Alan Greenspan, a respected economist who had served as a senior 
official in the Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford administrations and now 
heads the Federal Reserve Board, to analyze the proposed rule. Greenspan 
produced a report opposing it. 
</P>
<P>
Although executives at other savings and loans also lobbied against the direct 
investment rule, Keating was perhaps the most prominent and persistent 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Keating arranged for a congressional resolution that called on Gray to delay 
implementing the investment restriction for six months. Although 225 House 
members signed the resolution, it failed to sway the regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to stop the restriction, Keating found a way to blunt its impact on 
Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
The Gray rule would be adopted in early 1985, Keating learned, but would be 
applied retroactively to Dec. 10, 1984; any direct investments made before that 
date would be permitted to stand, even if they exceeded the 10% limit. 
</P>
<P>
Three days before the expected deadline, Lincoln won approval from the 
California Department of Savings and Loan to move an additional $800 million 
into direct investments. That increased Lincoln's direct investments to about 
40% of its $2.2 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
Customers Targeted 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Keating and his executives came up with an innovative way to raise 
unrestricted funds for American Continental: They would sell debt securities 
similar to the bonds issued by most of America's major corporations. But, 
instead of selling them through Wall Street brokerages and other investment 
firms, they would peddle the securities to Lincoln customers. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Corporations routinely approved American 
Continental's first request to sell the debt securities, called subordinated 
debentures. About the same time, the state Department of Savings and Loan 
allowed American Continental to set up desks in the lobbies of Lincoln's 29 
branches to sell the securities. 
</P>
<P>
Although the securities were, in effect, junk bonds, Keating said he would have 
recommended them to anyone, even to the Roman Catholic charities he supported 
heavily with donations. In fact, the Sisters of Charity in Cincinnati bought 
$444,000 of the securities. 
</P>
<P>
In early 1988, American Continental sought approval for a second debenture 
offering. The California Department of Corporations approved the sales, even 
though the agency's own staff and the state's top savings and loan regulators 
expressed concern about the company's financial condition and ability to repay 
the debt. 
</P>
<P>
In little more than two years, American Continental sold about $200 million 
worth of debt securities to nearly 22,000 investors. About two-thirds of them 
were elderly Southern Californians who bought them at Lincoln branch offices. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them have said in lawsuits and congressional testimony that they were 
persuaded to buy the securities instead of certificates of deposit by American 
Continental sales representatives, who assured them that the securities were 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
Some have said they thought that the debentures were backed by federal deposit 
insurance -- a costly mistake, as things turned out. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators Cool 
</P>
<P>
By 1986, federal regulators in the regional office in San Francisco were 
becoming distinctly unsympathetic to Keating's operations. They began a 
detailed audit of Lincoln's books that stretched over a full year -- far longer 
than such examinations normally take. They concluded that Keating was handling 
Lincoln in an unsafe and unsound manner. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, examiners reported that Lincoln had made a substantial number of 
loans without proper appraisals, without verification of borrowers' credit and 
even, in some cases, without a loan application. 
</P>
<P>
To a large extent, the examiners said in their reports, it appeared that 
Lincoln was making bogus loans in an effort to get around the new restrictions 
on direct investments in real estate and to record profits that it had not 
really earned. 
</P>
<P>
Many major loans were made to "straw" buyers: people who bought properties with 
Lincoln funds on favorable terms and who never intended to repay the loans, 
thus leaving the savings and loan in control of the properties, the regulatory 
reports allege. 
</P>
<P>
The examiners said that, after making the loans, Lincoln claimed as profits the 
up-front fees and interest such loans normally generate. However, in many cases 
Lincoln had also provided the money for the fees and interest in addition to 
financing the entire purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1987, the examiners recommended to their superiors in Washington that 
the government seize the institution or at least impose a restrictive order to 
curtail its high-flying operations. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln executives defended their practices, saying government regulators did 
not understand the S&amp;L's development-oriented business. Regulators 
insisted, for instance, on using standards that applied to single-family loans 
to evaluate Lincoln's commercial loans. The thrift had obtained audited 
financial statements from the borrowers, and those documents provided a better 
picture of possible risks than a consumer credit report, they said. 
</P>
<P>
They contended also that regulators made simple mathematical errors in 
computing such items as how much Lincoln should set aside in reserves to 
protect against possible losses. 
</P>
<P>
The big loans were made to borrowers who came up with 25% down payments, 
company executives said. Lincoln did not finance 100% of the purchase price, 
they said, and any other loans that the buyers obtained were not for the 
purpose of providing the down payments. Lincoln, they said, was entitled to 
record the profits on the loans. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations of the regional regulators were not adopted by Gray or M. 
Danny Wall, who replaced Gray as head of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in 
July, 1987. Wall, a former staff aide to the Senate Banking Committee, said 
that there was insufficient evidence to justify the extreme action proposed by 
the San Francisco overseers. 
</P>
<P>
If the rebuff angered the regional examiners, what came next stunned them. A 
year later, Wall stripped them of their supervisory responsibility for Lincoln 
and transferred jurisdiction to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Wall said an internal investigation had determined that substantial animosity 
had developed between Lincoln and the San Francisco regulators and that leaks 
of confidential financial information had damaged the savings and loan. Wall 
ordered a new examination directed by Washington-based regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of absolving Lincoln, however, the new audit reached even more damaging 
conclusions. Among other things, it called into question the tax-sharing plan 
Lincoln and its accountants had devised in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
As a subsidiary of American Continental, Lincoln did not deal directly with the 
Internal Revenue Service on taxes. Instead, American Continental collected 
money from all its subsidiaries, then filed a consolidated tax return and made 
tax payments to the IRS on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Over a period of a little more than two years, Lincoln made $95 million in 
tax-sharing payments to its parent company, ostensibly to cover taxes on 
profits it had earned. 
</P>
<P>
But the government alleges in its racketeering lawsuit and other documents that 
Lincoln did not owe $95 million in taxes at the time and that American 
Continental never paid any of that money to the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and his subordinates engaged in a series of sham transactions designed 
to create the appearance of higher profits, and thus higher tax obligations, as 
a device for siphoning money out of Lincoln and moving it to American 
Continental, which kept the extra funds, according to federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Higher profits also boosted American Continental's stock price. That in turn 
helped Keating and his family collect $34 million over five years from 
salaries, gains on stock sales and other benefits, regulatory records state. 
The stock sales were made to American Continental's employee stock ownership 
plan, which obtained loans guaranteed by Lincoln to acquire the shares. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln executives said they did not misuse the tax-sharing arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
The executives contend the transactions that generated the profits were 
legitimate and that Lincoln owed taxes, although they acknowledged that the 
taxes might not have been due immediately. 
</P>
<P>
And, although Lincoln owed the taxes as a separate entity, they said, American 
Continental could use $250 million in tax credits it had accumulated itself to 
offset any profits on a consolidated basis that it or its subsidiaries made. 
Meantime, executives argued, the parent company could invest Lincoln's tax 
payments any way it chose. 
</P>
<P>
The tax plan was reviewed and approved by regulators, they pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
They sold stock to the employee stock ownership plan, the executives said, 
because the plan, by its very nature, required the purchase of American 
Continental stock. 
</P>
<P>
Because the stock was thinly traded, the plan could not acquire the big blocks 
of stock it needed except through sales by insiders. They said also that the 
price the insiders received for their stock was slightly below prevailing 
market prices. 
</P>
<P>
And any allegations of boosting stock prices to get money out of the employee 
stock ownership plan through the sales, they said, fall flat because most of 
such stock purchases occurred in 1985, long before the allegedly fraudulent 
transactions occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Example Cited 
</P>
<P>
One example of how Lincoln conducted its business, according to government 
regulators, is a loan it made to Ernest C. Garcia, a Phoenix-area developer. 
</P>
<P>
Early in 1987, Garcia approached Lincoln to see if he could borrow money to buy 
the remaining stock in a company in which he already held a 20% interest. 
Lincoln executives agreed to make the loan, regulators allege, but there was a 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
According to the government's racketeering lawsuit, the following events 
occurred: 
</P>
<P>
As a condition of lending him the money he wanted, Lincoln asked Garcia to buy 
1,000 acres of land owned by a Lincoln subsidiary for $14 million. The 1,000 
acres were part of an 8,500-acre tract called Hidden Valley Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia told Lincoln that he could not make the purchase himself, so he arranged 
for a firm called Westcontinental Mortgage &amp; Investment Corp. to buy the 
1,000 acres instead. Lincoln agreed to the arrangement and lent Westcon $10.5 
million, or 75% of the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Lincoln lent Garcia $20.2 million, and Garcia lent $3.5 
million of that amount to Westcon. The $3.5 million was used by Westcon to make 
the 25% cash down payment on the land purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln recorded an $11-million profit on the transaction, even though the only 
cash it received was $3.5 million that had come out of its own coffers, the 
suit contends. Westcon has never made a payment on its $10.5-million loan. 
</P>
<P>
In a May, 1988, letter, Westcon acknowledged that it had acted as Garcia's 
nominee and asked him to "arrange for the transfer of this property to its 
rightful owner as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
That transaction was the first of 10 involving Hidden Valley Ranch property. 
The government alleges that, altogether, Lincoln claimed "phantom profits" of 
$82 million from the 10 deals. Those profits resulted in Lincoln's making $31 
million in tax-sharing payments to its parent company. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental executives rejected the government's characterization of 
the Hidden Valley loans. They said that Garcia, for instance, obtained a 
$30-million line of credit and that the $20.2 million he borrowed on the line 
was wired directly to the Tucson Electric Power Co., which owned 80% of the 
company Garcia had founded in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The Hidden Valley deal, they said, was not a condition for obtaining the line 
of credit, and Garcia, a major developer, used his own funds to lend Westcon 
the down payment. 
</P>
<P>
Senators Intervene 
</P>
<P>
It was during this period that one of the most controversial episodes in the 
Lincoln case occurred. In his struggle against the regulators, Keating enlisted 
the aid of five U.S. senators, who intervened on his behalf in two 
now-controversial meetings with thrift regulators in April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The five senators -- Cranston, Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John McCain 
(R-Ariz.), John Glenn (D-Ohio) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) -- had 
received more than $300,000 in campaign contributions from Keating, his family 
and his business associates. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Cranston solicited $850,000 from Keating for three voter 
registration groups that signed up primarily Democrats. Glenn solicited 
$200,000 for a political organization he controlled. And McCain's wife and her 
father invested nearly $360,000 in a 1986 Keating partnership that put up a 
Phoenix shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
The first meeting, on April 2, 1987, involved bank board Chairman Gray and 
Sens. DeConcini, Glenn, McCain and Cranston. Gray later stated publicly that 
the four senators tried to make a deal for Keating by promising to get Lincoln 
to make more traditional home mortgages again if Gray would rescind the 10% 
limit on Lincoln's direct investments. 
</P>
<P>
Their effort, Gray declared, was an "abuse of senatorial authority" and 
"tantamount to an attempt to subvert" the regulatory process. 
</P>
<P>
The senators heatedly deny proposing any such deal. They say they met with Gray 
to discuss the unusually lengthy audit of Lincoln by the San Francisco regional 
office; their only message, the four senators say, was that the regulators 
should charge Keating with something or get off his back. 
</P>
<P>
The second meeting occurred a week later. Riegle joined the other four in a 
session with regional regulators who were conducting the protracted examination 
of Lincoln. Minutes of the meeting show that DeConcini mentioned the direct 
investment rule, but there was no subsequent discussion of the issue. The 
minutes indicate also that the session ended abruptly when the regulators said 
they intended to refer the Lincoln case to the Justice Department for criminal 
prosecution. That investigation is now under way. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of whether a deal over the 10% rule was ever discussed, critics of 
the senators' actions suggest that their involvement may have delayed the 
ultimate seizure of Lincoln by two years, adding at least $1 billion to the 
taxpayers' bill for bailing out the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the Senate Ethics Committee decided to appoint an outside 
counsel to investigate whether the five senators violated ethics rules by going 
to bat for Keating. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, meanwhile, filed a formal response to the committee contending that 
he had done nothing illegal or improper in connection with Keating. He said his 
efforts on Lincoln's behalf never went beyond what a member of Congress can 
legally do for a constituent who is experiencing problems with the government. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston denied that his actions were in any way responsible for the losses 
facing the government or the people who bought the American Continental debt 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
Bright Projections 
</P>
<P>
And what of Keating's enormous bets on the future of Arizona real estate? 
</P>
<P>
In brochures for Estrella, his big planned community southwest of Phoenix, 
Keating boasted that Phoenix would soon become the 12th-largest metropolitan 
area in the country. Employment was rising at an annual rate of nearly 4% as 
new residents flocked to the Grand Canyon state, and the future seemed as 
bright as the desert sun. 
</P>
<P>
A Lincoln subsidiary put in miles of sidewalks, created two lakes and made 
other improvements at Estrella. Some businesses began to move in. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Keating poured a total of $296 million into the Phoenician Resort in 
Scottsdale, which was designed to attract the affluent tourists who had been 
streaming into the state in increasing numbers every winter. 
</P>
<P>
Then things went bad. The influx of new residents and businesses to Arizona 
began to slow, but developers kept right on developing. Before long, the state 
was vastly overbuilt. The residential real estate market went flat. The 
commercial market fell through the floor. Even the tourist trade dropped off. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Estrella bears little resemblance to Keating's predictions; much of the 
land is still largely undeveloped. The Phoenician opened in late 1988, and, 
although it is generating tremendous income -- $4.3 million last month alone -- 
it is not generating enough to pay off its construction debt, regulators claim. 
</P>
<P>
"Lincoln never was a viable institution under Keating," said Bert Ely, an 
Alexandria, Va.-based consultant to the savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, government regulators seized control of the Phoenician and another 
Lincoln property, the Crescent Hotel in Phoenix, ousting Keating and as many as 
30 of his associates from management of the lodges. 
</P>
<P>
Seizure Occurs 
</P>
<P>
The government finally seized Lincoln on April 14, 1989, declaring that it was 
being operated in an unsafe and unsound manner and that Keating and his 
executives were dissipating its assets. 
</P>
<P>
The day before Lincoln was seized, American Continental filed for protection 
from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix. The bankruptcy case 
prevented regulators from assuming full control of some of Lincoln's assets. 
</P>
<P>
Also, it created an unusual group of victims. Lincoln's regular depositors 
would be made whole by taxpayers through the federal deposit insurance program, 
but the 22,000 investors who had bought the American Continental debt 
securities were left holding worthless paper. There was no federal insurance 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
One of those investors was Shirley Lampel. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Lampel's husband had died of a heart attack at the age of 58. Despite 
her inability to work because of the diabetes that had left her all but blind, 
Lampel sought no pity. With Social Security payments and the monthly income 
from her husband's $30,000 life insurance proceeds, she would make it. 
</P>
<P>
One day, after moving from Santa Maria to Tustin, she had noticed a large 
newspaper advertisement about an investment opportunity being offered at a 
Lincoln office near her condominium. She took her life insurance proceeds and 
"practically beat down the door" at the Lincoln branch to buy American 
Continental debt securities. 
</P>
<P>
After being assured that Lincoln was safe and sound, she had signed two pieces 
of paper and handed over a $30,000 cashier's check. She could not read the fine 
print, and she said no one ever read the documents to her. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was buying something similar to a certificate of deposit," she 
said. "I didn't know what debentures were. You have home insurance and car 
insurance, but do most of us really understand all that stuff? No. We trust."

U.S. AND SAUDIS AGREE TO FUND AFGHAN REBELS; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO PRESSURE MOSCOW INTO HELPING DEFUSE 
REGIONAL CONFLICTS.

<P>
In a concerted effort to pressure the Soviet Union to help defuse regional 
conflicts, the United States and Saudi Arabia have agreed to provide $715 
million to fund CIA covert aid to the moujahedeen resistance in Afghanistan, 
according to informed sources. 
</P>
<P>
The aid, which will be used primarily to provide military equipment and 
supplies over the next three months, is designed to nearly match an estimated 
$250 million a month in assistance that U.S. intelligence says the Soviet Union 
is providing the Kabul regime. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration already has received congressional approval to provide 
$280 million in U.S. aid to the Afghan insurgents through February. The 
remainder will be provided by Saudi Arabia to help finance the 
U.S.-orchestrated effort, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The aid reflects the Administration's desire to send a strong message to Moscow 
in advance of next month's superpower summit in Malta that the United States 
has no plans to back down on foreign policy issues because of sweeping 
political changes within the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Moscow's increasing assistance to the government of Afghan 
President Najibullah, the Soviets and the Cubans have provided new aid, 
directly and indirectly, to the Sandinista government in Nicaragua, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Administration sources said that the Sandinistas, in turn, have provided new 
assistance to the rebels in El Salvador, apparently to help the guerrillas 
mount the bloody offensive that has claimed the lives of hundreds of soldiers 
and civilians in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever is happening inside the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe, they (the 
Soviets) are not lowering their profile in regional conflicts," said one source 
close to the issue. "The Administration feels it has to be in a position to 
keep up the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and Saudi Arabia have assisted the moujahedeen 
resistance movement since shortly after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 
late 1979. The Saudis primarily have helped finance the CIA-directed covert aid 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. assistance to the rebels was cut back dramatically after the Soviet 
troop withdrawal in February, and diplomatic sources said the new effort 
represents a major challenge to the Soviets on the eve of the summit. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the Administration is 
concerned about continuing Soviet involvement in regional conflicts. He 
indicated that U.S. technical economic assistance to the Soviets would be 
contingent upon Moscow's future cooperation in reducing regional hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed in reality versus rhetoric in terms of regional conflict," 
Baker said. "We're not making all the progress there that we'd like." 
</P>
<P>
Administration sources have said that the civil war in Afghanistan, as well as 
other regional conflicts, will be given high priority in Malta. "Some sparks 
may fly in Malta" over those conflicts, predicted a source involved in the 
debate on new aid to Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA-directed assistance appears to be primarily a reaction to Soviet moves 
rather than a result of a broad strategy review of U.S. policy in Afghanistan, 
a step urged by Congress in the aftermath of the Soviet troop withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Administration official said the United States is uncertain why the 
Soviet Union, after pledging publicly to help coordinate an end to regional 
conflicts, instead seems to be raising the stakes in Afghanistan and Central 
America. 
</P>
<P>
"They're still pumping billions into Afghanistan; what they've given Cuba is 
certainly not insignificant, and what they're doing in Nicaragua costs," said a 
senior Administration official. "Why are they doing that? I can give you some 
guesses, but I have no idea whether they make sense." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets simply may be "as uncoordinated as the rest of us," the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A second possibility, he said, is that "in order to move broadly on reforms, 
(Soviet leader Mikhail S.) Gorbachev has got to give something on the other 
side." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials suggested that the aid will help the moujahedeen launch a new 
offensive before winter weather slows fighting in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudis have contributed to the Afghan resistance because the moujahedeen 
are considered Islamic brethren and Riyadh is concerned about Soviet 
encroachment in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the new assistance comes at a time when U.S. intelligence 
assessments are sharply divided on the strength and potential longevity of 
Najibullah's government. 
</P>
<P>
A recent CIA assessment predicts that a new offensive could topple the regime 
by the end of February. But a Pentagon intelligence report suggests that the 
moujahedeen are losing the edge in the conflict and that "Najibullah is not 
history," said an official who has seen both assessments. 
</P>
<P>
Despite U.S. frustration with the Soviets, State Department officials 
acknowledge that Moscow was helpful in pressuring Syria and Iraq, which supply 
arms to Christian and Muslim militias in Lebanon, to facilitate a recent 
agreement on a peace formula for Lebanon.

ANIMAL ACTIVISTS BLAMED IN WIDE RANCH SABOTAGE 
</P>

<P>
Militant vegetarians and animal-rights activists are being blamed by the FBI 
for a growing problem with sabotage and vandalism on Western ranches, 
apparently aimed at undermining the region's beef and wool-growing industries. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Whitaker of the FBI office in Las Vegas warned the annual Nevada 
Cattlemen's Assn. convention last week that recent attacks on remote ranches 
are believed to be the work of the same people already suspected of torching 
meat plants and bombing offices in California and Nevada. Animal rights 
advocates conceded that point in interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Whitaker said any livestock operator is a potential target for militant 
"vegans" -- people who shun meat, dairy products, eggs or cheese and don't wear 
leather or wool. Such people, he asserted, are determined to slow or stop human 
use and consumption of livestock. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI agent said such attacks are increasing so fast that he is beginning to 
reassess earlier attacks dismissed as random acts by cranks or pranksters. He 
declined to discuss specific numbers or situations, saying they are part of an 
FBI investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Two groups, the Animal Liberation Front and Earth First!, acknowledge increased 
"action" against remote farms and ranches, partly as an extension of their 
activity to end the use of animals in medical laboratory experiments. 
</P>
<P>
ALF spokeswoman Margo Tannenbaum of San Bernardino, Calif., said the group's 
goal is "the elimination of the livestock industry," but Dale Turner of Tucson, 
Ariz., said Earth First! merely wants to end livestock grazing on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason why the Animal Liberation Front is conducting economic sabotage to 
the poultry and livestock industries is to encourage those involved to quit and 
follow other pursuits," said Tannenbaum, 42. "We do not believe in eating 
animals. How can anyone eat and ingest such suffering and misery and expect all 
to be right with themselves and the world?" 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the grazing of livestock has a devastating effect on the flora and 
fauna," said Turner, 32. "Our position concerns the health of the wild." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Simmonds, director of lab animal research for the University of Nevada 
system, said sabotage is more likely to affect the health of the cattle 
industry first. "It's an extremely serious problem," he said. "These people 
want to wipe out the meat industry, want to end the manufacture of leather and 
wool products." 
</P>
<P>
Among the ranchers targeted by saboteurs in recent months was Jim Connelley, 
48, president of Nevada Cattlemen's Assn. He said someone drained oil from his 
four-wheel tractor, resulting in $1,800 in damage. 
</P>
<P>
Connelley said the mechanic who fixed his tractor reported doing similar 
repairs for six other ranchers in sparsely populated Elko County this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Other Elko County ranchers report herd bulls castrated, rendering them 
useless; fence and water pipelines cut, troughs and water tanks overturned, 
windmills decommissioned, steel dropped into well casings and other types of 
harassment," said Connelley, who lives 85 miles from the nearest town but only 
2 miles from Nevada State Highway 225. 
</P>
<P>
A man affiliated with Earth First!, who talked to The Times over the telephone 
without identifying himself, described a recent assault on a Nevada ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in southeastern Nevada recently with a friend and we were in an area 
overgrazed, vastly abused land," he said. "We decided to cut a couple of miles 
of fence. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I shot holes in oil reservoirs on the gear boxes of windmills. When the wind 
blows after a day or two it burns up the gears and destroys the gear box. I've 
thrown rocks and steel into wells to plug them up. There are hundreds of 
galvanized steel water tanks all over the place. I've shot holes in them and 
pulled out float valves." 
</P>
<P>
"I want to run ranchers out of business," he said flatly. 
</P>
<P>
Tannenbaum said the ALF usually prefers freeing animals from captivity, such as 
when its members raid turkey farms each year around Thanksgiving and rabbit 
farms before Easter. She said ALF also takes credit for releasing 300 wild 
horses from a Bureau of Land Management holding area in Northern California and 
several head of beef cattle from a Coalinga feedlot last year. 
</P>
<P>
With each release, she added, the group festooned walls and equipment with such 
messages as "Animal Auschwitz," "ALF Is Always Watching" and "Murderers, 
Butchers." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, guerrillas have bungled, as when they "liberated" thousands of 
farm-raised chukars, or game birds, near Elko last summer. Some of the freed 
birds were swiftly set upon by hungry dogs, while others were mowed down by 
cars after wandering onto Interstate 80. 
</P>
<P>
Whitaker of the FBI said he believes the growing number of ranch attacks is a 
natural extension of the urban "terrorism" attributed in recent years to 
militant vegetarians and radical environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Last Jan. 29, for example, someone set fire to the livestock auction building 
in Dixon, Calif., causing $250,000 damage. "Animals Are Not Slaves" and "Earth 
First" were painted on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Similar slogans were etched and painted on the windows of the Sacramento 
headquarters of the California Cattlemen's Assn. On May 25, a Molotov cocktail 
was hurled through the window of the cattlemen's office, where Executive Vice 
President John Ross was working late. The bomb failed to go off. 
</P>
<P>
An anonymous caller claiming allegiance to the ALF took responsibility for a 
1988 arson fire that destroyed a San Jose meatpacking plant; the ALF denied 
responsibility. Three other San Jose-area meatpacking plants were torched late 
in 1987. The initials "ALF" were found at one site, while the "Animal Rights 
Militia" claimed responsibility for the other two fires. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, however, such activity was confined to urban areas and 
immediately adjacent farmlands. Now, Whitaker said, activists appear to be 
directly attacking remote ranches that are difficult to defend. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something new for our industry," said Vickie Turner, 29, who runs a 
livestock operation with her husband and is the executive director of the 
Nevada Cattlemen's Assn. "Seminars . . . are being formed . . . to alert 
ranchers about the threat to their livelihood." 
</P>
<P>
If the rhetoric of animal-rights activists is any sign, the situation is 
unlikely to die down soon. 
</P>
<P>
Ingrid Newkirk, national director and co-founder of the 250,000-member People 
For the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said in a telephone interview from 
Washington that the livestock industry is "the single most destructive problem 
in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
"The meat producing industry by its very nature, considering the slaughter of 
animals, is a violent profession," she said, adding quickly that "our group, 
however, does not engage in violent activities." 
</P>
<P>
"We promote vegetarianism and veganism," she said. "We don't believe animals 
are to be eaten or experimented with by humans. . . . Eventually if our dream 
comes true there will no longer be a livestock industry." 
</P>
<P>
Writer Lynn Jacobs, 39, an Earth First member, also of Tucson, said in a 
telephone interview: "I advocate each person should do what he or she is best 
at even if it is illegal to accomplish this end, if it means cutting fences, 
decommissioning windmills, removing salt blocks, damaging ranching equipment. 
There are higher laws than the laws of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
John Marynik, a specialist on terrorism for the California attorney general 
told The Times that his office is keeping close watch on activities by 
extremist animal rightist organizations. 
</P>
<P>
He cited the ALF, which came to his attention after it took credit for the 1987 
arson that destroyed a $2.5-million animal research center under construction 
at UC Davis. In the ashes, a note read: "Retaliation in the name of thousands 
of animals tortured each year."

This nation's painful attempt to crawl from despotism to democracy has again 
been retarded by an inept and corrupt military government whose undisciplined 
troops have terrorized the population and stolen such vast sums that the 
economy is verging on collapse, according to civic and political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders say they fear another reign of Duvalier-style tyranny. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests of three major political figures late last month and their repeated 
display on national television -- faces bruised and bandaged and shirts 
bloodied from apparent mistreatment -- triggered general strikes throughout the 
country Nov. 7 demanding their release from jail. 
</P>
<P>
After the arrests, Louis Dejoie, a leading presidential candidate in elections 
scheduled for next year, was among nearly a dozen politicians who went into 
hiding in fear of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Dejoie and the three arrested politicians had called for civil disobedience and 
a mass protest march against the military president, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, on 
Nov. 29, the anniversary of Haiti's last bloodily aborted attempt at elections 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the beginning of Duvalier III," Dejoie said before slipping out of 
sight. He referred to the dynasty of Francois (Papa Doc) and Jean-Claude (Baby 
Doc) Duvalier, who ruled for nearly 30 years until February, 1986. "If Avril 
doesn't change his ways, this country is going down the drain." 
</P>
<P>
Haiti has undergone two years of increasing instability that saw a puppet 
civilian president, Leslie F. Manigat, deposed by the dictatorial Lt. Gen. 
Henri Namphy, who was in turn ousted in the "sergeants' coup" that brought 
Avril to power. The country is almost down the drain socially and economically, 
according to Haitian economists, human rights activists and civic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
They describe days and nights of uncertainty, violence and crime as 
undisciplined soldiers and armed ex-soldiers ousted in five recent unsuccessful 
coup attempts pull off holdups, run extortion rackets and bully ordinary people 
with terrorist threats. Joining the soldiers are roving bands of armed thugs 
from the old Duvalier regime. 
</P>
<P>
Jean-Claude Bajeaux, a leading human rights activist, told of innocent people, 
in one case a respected French Roman Catholic monk, chased down and shot by 
soldiers who may have been acting on orders or merely free-lancing as 
after-hours gangsters. 
</P>
<P>
Bajeaux said one young man, while being arraigned on a petty charge, was shot 
dead in the courtroom by an officer in civilian clothes. The officer apparently 
had been offended when the youth refused to accompany him to the army's 
notorious Researche Criminal, once the headquarters and torture center of the 
Duvalier political police. 
</P>
<P>
"That was in September, yet nothing has been done about it," said Bajeaux. 
"There are daily rights violations and nothing is done." 
</P>
<P>
Several businessmen who asked to remain unidentified told of extortion threats, 
at least three of them successful, in which callers demanded $40,000 to $50,000 
payoffs. Jean-Claude Roy, a young businessman who heads a fledgling political 
party called the Haiti Constitutional Union, said armed men appeared twice at 
his house after a death threat and were driven away both times by his own armed 
security men. 
</P>
<P>
It is not merely violent crime but economic crime on a massive scale that is 
bringing Haiti's economy to its knees, according to a number of reliable 
informants, including businessmen, economists and former government officials. 
They say Avril's urgent need to buy the loyalty of soldiers and officers is to 
blame for a wholesale raid on the country's treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Avril's biggest single reward to the armed forces, which one businessman 
characterized as "9,000 armed gangsters," was a one-third boost in this year's 
military budget, which at $42 million overshadows all other government 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
However, selected officers, sergeants and enlisted men whose support is crucial 
to keeping Avril in power have received extra personal rewards: special 
profiteering privileges at state-owned enterprises that would earn long jail 
terms in any other country. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, and others whose favor Avril depends upon, have been given 
virtually unlimited rights to buy flour, cement and other products from 
public-sector companies at low, state-controlled prices. They then sell the 
products on the black market at double or more the purchase cost. Meanwhile, 
legitimate buyers have been turned away, made to endure long delays or forced 
to buy from the black marketeers. 
</P>
<P>
When all of the country's major cement-using firms shut down in protest for 
three weeks last month, the Avril government relented, but not by much. It 
raised the controlled price of cement by $1 a bag, which still left the black 
marketeers a hefty profit margin. 
</P>
<P>
The result, according to two leading economists, is that the once-profitable 
state flour company, the cement company and the telephone company all show 
severe deficits for the first time in years. 
</P>
<P>
One businessman estimated that the 1,000-member Presidential Guard, which put 
Avril into power and is now the only elite unit in the army, takes more than $1 
million per month from the cement plant alone. "All told, during the past year 
the state enterprises hemorrhaged losses of more than $100 million," one of the 
economists said. 
</P>
<P>
The military government also has forced state enterprises to hire favored but 
unneeded relatives and friends. One result is that the Port Authority of 
Port-au-Prince, which once made money, is now deep in debt because of a payroll 
that has grown from $300,000 to $950,000 per month just since last April, said 
another top Haitian economist. "They even force schools to take in their 
relatives without entrance exams," he said, "just riding roughshod over 
everyone with their special status." 
</P>
<P>
"In most countries, the rich subsidize the poor, but here it's the other way 
around," commented a foreign diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling that Avril was a senior financial adviser to the Duvaliers, a foreign 
economist who has spent years puzzling over the poorest country in the Western 
Hemisphere said: "The way you stay in power in Haiti is you buy support. Avril 
is just going back to what he has been doing for the last 23 years: 
manipulating state corporations to turn them into cash cows to be milked by his 
supporters." 
</P>
<P>
Mismanagement and economic ignorance on the part of senior officials of the 
Avril government also are to blame for the country's plight, according to 
presidential candidate Marc Bazin, a former World Bank economist. Bazin is 
currently the favorite if next year's scheduled elections are held. 
</P>
<P>
Bazin cited a recent government decision to end Haiti's longstanding parallel 
market in hard currency in which businessmen and others could freely buy U.S. 
dollars at only a modest premium of about 20% above the officially fixed rate, 
which is five Haitian gourdes to the dollar. The free trade in dollars was 
essential to keep what had been a growing export sector as well as the 
country's importers in business, the economist said. 
</P>
<P>
But when the free market ended last month, the premium on dollars, if they 
could be found, more than doubled. 
</P>
<P>
"It was terribly counterproductive," said a foreign economist. "The banks have 
lost a third to a half of their deposits, and some businessmen have just closed 
up and left the country." 
</P>
<P>
"The government handled the foreign exchange situation so badly that it got 
worse than if they'd done nothing," said Bazin. 
</P>
<P>
Although most political leaders still harbor doubts about Avril's sincerity in 
agreeing to hold free and open elections next year, major figures such as Bazin 
are busily building political structures and trying to whip up grass-roots 
support as if the voting will take place as planned. 
</P>
<P>
Bazin's moderate centrist Movement to Install Democracy in Haiti (MIDH) 
recently drew 1,200 delegates and 2,800 supporters to its first convention, 
just outside Port-au-Prince. The one-time finance minister, who was favored by 
the United States in the aborted 1987 election, has forged what most believe is 
a binding alliance with two other parties, one slightly right and the other 
slightly left of center, giving him a commanding early lead. 
</P>
<P>
The country's constitutionally independent nine-member Electoral Council, led 
by respected 60-year-old economist Louis-Antoine Auguste, also is working as if 
its ambitious, three-phase electoral timetable will be met. But the work has 
proceeded slowly, according to Auguste, partly because the Avril government did 
not give the council an office until last month. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, the council's government-assigned office turned out to be the same 
one in downtown Port-au-Prince that was abandoned by an earlier electoral 
council when it was demolished in a bomb attack. The bombing has since been 
ascribed to the old military government's thugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people thought that might be a bad omen," Auguste said with a wry smile.

U.S. VS. SEARS: COURTS END DECADE WITHOUT A DECISION; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: THE RESULT HAS BEEN CALLED A 'JUDICIAL TRAGEDY.' THE CASE BOUNCED THROUGH 
THE HALLS OF JUSTICE FOR NEARLY 10 YEARS AND NEVER CAME TO TRIAL.

<P>
Nearly a decade ago, the U.S. Justice Department indicted Sears Roebuck &amp; 
Co., the nation's largest retailer, on charges of evading customs duties on 
thousands of Japanese televisions that were suspected of being "dumped" on the 
American market. 
</P>
<P>
Sears faced $130,000 in fines and considerable public embarrassment if the 
federal government proved that the Chicago-based corporation concealed more 
than $1.1 million in rebates and credits it allegedly received from Japanese 
suppliers between 1968 and 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-count fraud indictment, handed down in Los Angeles -- the port of entry 
for many of the televisions -- sent shock waves through the electronics 
industry because several American companies were accepting such rebates from 
Japanese firms. 
</P>
<P>
The government alleged that Sears tried to avoid duties imposed by the U.S. 
Customs Service on merchandise sold in this country for prices below those 
charged in their home market, a practice known as "dumping." Sears vigorously 
denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
From early 1980 until late in September, when it was quietly settled, the case 
of United States vs. Sears was one of the most controversial in local federal 
court history. 
</P>
<P>
It evolved into what some observers called "judicial Ping-Pong," with the case 
bouncing back and forth 10 times between the district court in Los Angeles and 
the appeals court based in San Francisco -- but never got to trial. It also 
caused considerable embarrassment for the U.S. Justice Department because of 
the initial prosecutor's questionable conduct before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, it became "a judicial tragedy," according to Donald C. Smaltz, a 
Los Angeles lawyer who was involved in the case briefly and followed it closely 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department quietly dismissed the case in return for Sears' making 
only a written admission that some of its employees had not complied with the 
Customs Service's interpretation of what a company had to do when importing 
goods into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 years, hundreds of hours of arguments and thousands of pages of legal 
briefs, the case ended "with a whimper, not with a bang," as one former 
prosecutor put it. 
</P>
<P>
That scenario seemed unlikely when the highly publicized charges were first 
lodged against Sears on Feb. 26, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
But Sears chose to fight. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies of its mammoth size and prestige might have quickly settled and 
launched advertising campaigns to stress a positive corporate image, but Sears 
counterattacked. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen D. Miller, the company's Los Angeles-based defense lawyer, asserted 
that the Customs Service "actively misled" Sears into following importing 
practices that led to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
He further contended that Customs officials had for years quietly approved 
purchasing practices that both American and Japanese firms were using to skirt 
unwieldly Japanese trade laws. 
</P>
<P>
Thus began a legal war that included charges of prosecutorial misconduct, the 
dismissal of the indictment four times by two federal judges and the 
restoration of charges four times by a federal appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
The Sears saga also featured an unseemly clash between Manuel L. Real, the 
chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, and some of his judicial 
brethren on the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, who ordered him to give up 
the case to another federal judge to preserve "the appearance of justice." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the sound and fury, United States vs. Sears never got to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides informally agreed not to discuss the details of the case, but a 
review of thousands of pages of affidavits, briefs, motions and transcripts 
show that although the government won several legal skirmishes, it probably 
lost the war because of tactics early on by an overzealous prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
That prosecutor's name was Paul G. Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Gorman was a young Justice Department lawyer working in Washington 
who was sent to Los Angeles with the important task of taking the Sears case 
before a federal grand jury. But Gorman's actions inside the grand jury 
hearings would haunt the Justice Department for years. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors routinely are given broad latitude in how they conduct grand jury 
proceedings and how they introduce evidence and question witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
But Sears' lawyers alleged that Gorman went much too far. They accused him of 
engaging in prosecutorial misconduct by being excessively hostile when 
questioning Sears' employees, keeping from the grand jury information that was 
favorable to Sears, expressing his personal views on the evidence, and 
permitting a key witness to make inflammatory statements that were prejudicial 
to Sears. 
</P>
<P>
One witness that Gorman vigorously questioned was Jerome F. Brennan, who was 
Sears' senior buyer of televisions from 1967 to 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Gorman, Brennan made what the government considered a key 
admission: Sears officials told Customs agents that they had paid more to 
Japanese suppliers than they really had because they had received rebates. 
However, Brennan also insisted that Sears "didn't think we were doing anything 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
But in an affidavit given last June, Brennan said that he had met with Gorman 
prior to appearing before the grand jury and that "it quickly became apparent" 
to him that Gorman was "not interested in learning my honest thoughts and 
perceptions concerning the matters under investigation or hearing my testimony 
in my own words." 
</P>
<P>
Court records also show that Gorman misquoted statements Brennan made to him in 
an interview outside the grand jury room and then presented the inaccurate 
statements to the grand jury and pressed Brennan to confirm them. 
</P>
<P>
Another witness whose testimony later tainted the prosecution's case was John 
J. Nevin, the chairman of Zenith Radio Corp., one of Sears' major competitors. 
Nevin testified before the grand jury at great length about the devastating 
effects that Japanese industry had had on the American economy. 
</P>
<P>
Several judges would later question the relevance of Nevin's testimony. At the 
time, Zenith was a plaintiff in a major antitrust case pending in Philadelphia 
against a number of importers and exporters of Japanese televisions, including 
Sears. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Hoffman, a Justice Department lawyer who took over the case from Gorman 
in 1981 and was the lead prosecutor for four years, said in a recent interview 
that it was "definitely wrong" for Gorman to have brought Nevin before the 
grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
"I never would have called him," Hoffman said, but stressed that there were 
several other witnesses who gave more relevant testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the indictment was filed, Sears' attorney Miller argued that the 
case should have been dismissed on the grounds of prosecutorial misconduct. But 
U.S. District Judge Robert J. Kelleher, the first jurist to preside over the 
case, denied the motion and the appeals court upheld him. 
</P>
<P>
From that point on, the Sears case took a tortuous path. 
</P>
<P>
It was transferred to Real, who in the fall of 1981 dismissed the indictment. 
He agreed with Sears that Gorman had engaged in several types of prosecutorial 
misconduct. The prosecutor, Real wrote, commanded Sears employees to answer 
"yes" or "no" to complex, unintelligible or argumentative questions that were 
peppered with sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
"Blind zeal in the prosecution of any criminal defendant . . . cannot be 
tolerated in an ordered society," Real wrote. 
</P>
<P>
He characterized much of Nevin's testimony as "irrelevant ramblings" that had 
no place in a grand jury proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Assistant California Atty. Gen. Andrea Ordin, who was the U.S. attorney 
in Los Angeles at the time, acknowledged that neither her office nor the 
Justice Department in Washington adequately supervised Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
"He did make mistakes," said Ordin, but added that prosecutors should have been 
allowed to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
The 9th Circuit agreed. Two years after Real first dismissed the charges, a 
three-judge appeals court panel reinstated the indictment. The judges said that 
Gorman's "behavior before the grand jury was, at times, abusive" but ruled that 
the misconduct was not serious enough to have tainted the grand jury's 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, other prosecutors took over the case but the impact of 
Gorman's conduct lingered. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Real dismissed the indictment a second time, saying that he had 
discretionary, supervisory power to do so. Again, the appeals court reversed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Four years had passed and still there had been no trial. 
</P>
<P>
A frustrated Justice Department convened another grand jury, and again Sears 
was indicted. 
</P>
<P>
Real weighed in a third time, dismissing the case on grounds that the statute 
of limitations on when the alleged crimes occurred had run out. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is one of the most egregious cases I have ever known about in my 
career as a lawyer," wrote Real, who served as U.S. attorney in Los Angeles 
from 1964 to 1966. "I think if I had been the U.S. attorney (at the time of the 
original indictment) I would have fired him (Gorman) on the spot." 
</P>
<P>
Gorman declined to comment on the case when reached by telephone at his Toledo, 
Ohio, residence. 
</P>
<P>
The Sears case was not the last time allegations of misconduct were raised 
about Gorman. In 1985, while working as a federal prosecutor in Ohio, he was 
convicted of criminal misconduct in a case unrelated to Sears. The misconduct 
included accepting an illegal gratuity. Gorman was sentenced to a year and a 
day in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Real's belief that the Sears case had been poisoned from the beginning, 
the government pressed on. "I always thought it was a good case," said former 
prosecutor Hoffman, now a San Diego Superior Court judge. "I think it became a 
matter of principle." 
</P>
<P>
In March of 1986, prosecutors secured a third reversal of Real from the 9th 
Circuit. This time, the appeals court not only reinstated the indictment but, 
in a rare move, ordered Real off the case. The appellate court said it had the 
right to remove judges in the interest of "the appearance of justice," but 
stressed that their decision "does not imply any personal grievance against the 
judge." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, some court observers said the Sears case came to be dominated by a 
clash of wills between Real and the appellate judges. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this was a really exaggerated case where the appeals court thought the 
trial judge was out of control and he thought they didn't understand what was 
going on in the case," said Jeffrey S. Brand, a University of San Francisco law 
professor, who publishes a journal on federal courts and characterized the case 
as "judicial Ping-Pong." 
</P>
<P>
Real appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the justices rejected the request. 
In July of 1987, an angry Real surrendered the case and it was reassigned to 
Judge A. Andrew Hauk. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Hauk dismissed the indictment a fourth time, saying that Sears' right 
to a speedy trial had been violated. But the appeals court disagreed and 
reinstated the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
With that ruling, it appeared that the Sears case would finally go to trial, 
even though some events that led to the indictment had occurred 21 years 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
By now, Brennan -- the former Sears purchasing official and a potential key 
witness -- was in ill health and was excused from testifying. Sears then won a 
ruling from Hauk that Brennan's decade-old grand jury testimony would be 
excluded from the trial, and the judge told prosecutors that their case was now 
"bereft" of key evidence. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, both sides decided it was time to call it quits and reached a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 20, Sears admitted in a court document presented to Hauk that some of 
its employees "though acting in good faith, acted unwisely" in not fully 
complying with Customs Service interpretations of the agency's rules. The 
corporation said that it had long ago changed its importing procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"Sears recognizes its obligation to set the highest standards of business 
conduct in its dealing with government agencies and its customers," the 
document said. "Sears will continue to maintain these same high goals in its 
future relations with government and its customers." 
</P>
<P>
The judge said Sears' statement was not an admission of guilt but "sort of an 
admission that the government wasn't on an absolutely wild goose chase." 
</P>
<P>
Judge Real said in a recent interview that he was pleased by how the case 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm vindicated," he declared. "The case should never have gone past the first 
appeal." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA law professor Peter Arenella, a criminal law expert, questioned the wisdom 
of the Justice Department's decade-long pursuit of Sears. 
</P>
<P>
"The government got nothing (for its years of effort in the case)," Arenella 
said. "For all this time, energy and expenditure of resources, the government 
gets a statement from Sears that Sears could run in a television commercial."

PROP. 103'S CRUX PERSISTS FOR GILLESPIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
More than halfway through hearings on implementing the auto insurance pricing 
provisions of Proposition 103, the central question posed for Commissioner 
Roxani Gillespie remains the same: How will she deal with the reform measure's 
mandate for less dependence on a driver's home address in setting rates? 
</P>
<P>
Under the so-called territorial rating system traditionally used by the 
insurance industry, it is not unusual for inner-city residents in California to 
pay rates four times higher than rural or suburban dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
The insurers continue to defend the system, claiming that each neighborhood 
must pay its own claims costs. They say accidents, thefts and resulting claims 
are far higher in the inner cities. Opponents, however, say the system is 
discriminatory, often hurting poor blacks and Latinos who can least afford the 
highest rates. A coalition of minority and low-income organizations has called 
at the hearings for abolishing territorial rating altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, insurer and consumer experts on a panel of actuaries -- appointed by 
Gillespie to try to develop a compromise pricing solution that would at least 
bear some relation to the language in Proposition 103 -- continued to differ 
widely on how to readjust the pricing mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
In separate testimony, both actuaries agreed that Proposition 103 allows a 
driver's home address to continue to be used as one factor in setting rates. 
But the insurer representative, Michael J. Miller, argued for pricing rules 
that would allow it to remain a leading factor, while the consumer 
representative, J. Robert Hunter, said its significance must be downgraded 
considerably if the spirit of the measure is to be honored. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie has already vowed not to do anything that would result in large rate 
increases for millions of suburban and rural drivers and has said that 
abolishing territorial rating would lead to exactly that outside Los Angeles 
and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
But the commissioner has also indicated she might accept some adjustments in 
price and downgrade territorial rating to some extent to make insurance more 
affordable for inner-city residents. How to accomplish this, without leading to 
higher prices elsewhere, is her problem. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 103 -- approved by voters last year -- states that rates shall be 
determined by the driver's safety record, the number of miles driven annually 
and the number of years of driving experience. Those factors, it says, are to 
be applied "in decreasing order of importance," along with "such other factors 
as the commissioner may adopt by regulation that have a substantial 
relationship to the risk of loss." 
</P>
<P>
Actuaries Miller and Hunter last week listed between them 25 other factors that 
could be used, ranging from make and model of automobile to litigation rates to 
home address. They did not always agree on whether a factor should be used. For 
instance, Miller said gender, marital status, academic standing of students and 
theft rates could be used, if justified as a risk factor. Hunter said those 
factors should not be used. He said use of gender, for instance, would violate 
the state's Unruh Civil Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
Both men agreed that the commissioner should not try to set numerical weights 
for each permissible pricing factor for all companies, but should allow each to 
decide for itself -- within certain parameters -- what weights to assign, and 
even whether to use the enumerated "other factors" beyond the three named by 
Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Where they disagreed profoundly -- the question Gillespie must ultimately 
decide -- was whether the three top mandatory factors must have more to do with 
making up the price than any of the other factors, especially territory. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, an actuary with the Tillinghast accounting firm, voiced the traditional 
insurance industry position. He argued that companies could comply with 
Proposition 103 by simply considering the measure's factors -- safety record, 
miles driven and years driving -- in that order, without necessarily giving 
them the most weight in fixing prices. He said hypothetically these three 
factors might make up only 13% of the price, while territory -- even if it is 
the last factor to be considered -- might be allowed to make up 40% of the 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said that if a company was told to ignore territory and charge a flat 
rate, it would lose money in urban areas and make money in rural areas. Under 
such circumstances, insurance would probably soon become easy to buy in rural 
areas and hard to obtain in the urban ones. So, Miller said, the use of home 
address as a pricing factor is essential to allow an orderly market to 
function. 
</P>
<P>
He added that if poor people in the inner cities could not afford to buy auto 
insurance under the territorial rating system, the state could provide the poor 
with insurance stamps -- just as it provides food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility Miller mentioned was subsidizing the urban poor through the 
assigned risk system, with drivers below a certain income level given lower 
rates. Under the assigned risk system, drivers are assigned to insurance 
companies in proportion to their total business in the state. Any losses 
incurred by a company in paying claims of assigned risk drivers are charged to 
the company's regular customers. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter disagreed with Miller's contention that Proposition 103's phrase calling 
for safety record, miles driven and years of experience to be applied "in 
decreasing order of importance" means that these factors have to be considered 
first, but need not be weighted highest in setting the price. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer representative said that if the first three factors are given less 
weight than a driver's home address, for example, then the commissioner should 
step in and simply assign the first three factors a higher weight, giving them 
the most impact on the price charged. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, president of the National Insurance Consumer Organization, said that 
under Proposition 103, territorial rating could legitimately make up no more 
than 24.7% of a driver's rate. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Hunter also observed that social policy factors should in 
some instances be viewed as more important in setting rates than insurance 
business considerations, particularly when business practices contravene 
Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Miller's testimony . . . attached to the actuary's philosophy of 
cost-based pricing great importance," Hunter said. "Cost-based pricing is, in 
general, a good idea, but it is an item of actuary ideology, not of law, and 
where it conflicts with the law there should be no question that it is our 
ideology which must yield." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter did agree with Miller that even if rates were adjusted downward to some 
extent in urban areas in accord with Proposition 103, the adjustments probably 
would not be sufficient to make auto insurance affordable to all in those 
areas. Even if the price were reduced, say, from $2,000 a year to $1,700, this 
would still not bring it within the range of many working people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, commenting briefly on the testimony in an interview, said she is 
considering a plan to subsidize low-income drivers through the assigned risk 
system -- as suggested by Miller -- if she finds that continued use of the 
territorial rating system as a major factor should continue under Proposition 
103. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that assigned risk rates have already been held down in the Los 
Angeles area, allowing some drivers to obtain auto coverage for less than they 
otherwise could. But, she said, under the present assigned risk system, the 
rich as well as the poor can benefit from the lower rates, which she said she 
wants to change. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter said more time -- perhaps two months -- should be allowed to gather 
statistical data before Gillespie draws up regulations for a new pricing plan.

REOPENED BAY BRIDGE CALLED 'INADEQUATE'; 
</P>
<P>
QUAKE RECOVERY: MORE REDESIGN WORK IS NEEDED, A GOVERNMENT AGENCY SAYS. 
ALTHOUGH THE SPAN IS AT LEAST AS STRONG AS BEFORE, IT POSES 'SERIOUS THREATS' 
IN A LARGER TEMBLOR.

<P>
As the first cars crossed the repaired Bay Bridge on Friday night, a 
governmental agency warned that the structure may not withstand an earthquake 
similar to the one that hit Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
At 11:19 p.m. Friday, a month to the day after the quake sent a 50-foot section 
of the upper deck collapsing onto the lower deck, Caltrans removed orange 
freeway cones, thus reopening the bridge to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists escorted by California Highway Patrol cars indulged in the event by 
honking their horns, hollering and giving the thumbs-up sign as they edged 
their way toward the toll plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day on Saturday, traffic was light on both sides of the bridge. 
CHP reported there were no back-ups or accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the opening of the bridge, officials say more work will have to be 
done before the most heavily used bridge in the nation's fourth-largest 
metropolis can withstand another major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Quentin Kopp, a San Francisco independent who chairs the Senate 
Transportation Committee, said he was virtually certain that the state will 
spend the funds for the additional work. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a panel of the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development 
Commission said that the repaired bridge is at least as strong as it was before 
the temblor. But major quakes closer to the bridge, or of the magnitude of 
those in 1906 or 1868, will likely cause "failures involving more serious 
threats to life safety." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure the public at large realizes that the criteria used for the 
original (Bay Bridge) design is inadequate," said Alan Pendleton, executive 
director of the planning and regulatory agency, which must grant Caltrans a 
permit to complete any large-scale retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
"While this criteria was appropriate to 1930s," Pendleton added, "it is not 
appropriate for the 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton noted that engineers can redesign supports to ensure that the bridge 
can withstand even stronger, closer quakes. But the expense would easily dwarf 
the estimated $4 million that the reconstruction has cost. 
</P>
<P>
The tone of the agency's statement contrasted with comments of Abolhassan 
Astaneh, engineering professor at UC Berkeley who is studying the bridge with 
funds from the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing weak about that bridge," he said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Astaneh did, however, add a qualification. He said the span's seismic safety 
features were "30 years ahead of its time" when it was built. Now, 53 years 
after the bridge's opening on Nov. 12, 1936, the design is "20 years behind the 
times." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, dignitaries praised Caltrans, contractors and crews for the repairs 
that were done and for getting the bridge back in service so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"We've beaten the bureaucracy on this one," Transportation Secretary Samuel 
Skinner declared in a visit to the bridge last week. 
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction involved such feats as shifting the eastern end of the 
bridge -- 10 million pounds of steel and concrete -- westward five inches. In 
all, 150 tons of new steel was used in the reconstruction, nearly all of it 
fabricated on barges in the bay below the bridge. Given the bridge's 
importance, time was of essence. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had a budget. They said, 'Fix the bridge.' This was a marching army," 
said Denny A. McLeod, 63-year-old founder of Rigging International, one of the 
main subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
McLeod had taken on big jobs before. In 1963, he helped figure out how to hoist 
a Japanese airliner that had belly flopped into San Francisco Bay. He and his 
firm helped build sections of the Alaskan pipeline, nuclear power plants and 
container facilities at ports in Long Beach and San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
"This took all the experience we could muster," he said. "There was nothing in 
the book that says what you do with a broken bridge that has been shook by an 
earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
For many of the ironworkers, it was the job of a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys really wanted to get on this job," ironworker Joe Kroll said 
after a month of 12-hour-a-day shifts. "It was a challenge, you might say. 
There aren't too many bridges being built these days." 
</P>
<P>
Kroll, 34, was among the first workers to arrive on the bridge the morning 
after the quake. At the time, the broken 50-foot section was teetering. With 
aftershocks coming without warning, the lower deck could have slipped. If it 
gave way, the upper deck would have followed -- perhaps taking with it hundreds 
of feet of bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Workers lashed the lower deck together with wire rope, three-fourths of an inch 
and an inch thick. Hard-hatted workers resembled mountain climbers as they 
prepared the collapsed section to be hoisted away. They clutched ropes as they 
scampered up and down the steeply tilted roadway. 
</P>
<P>
With the five-lane decks secured, workers cut the slabs using diamond-tipped 
saws on the concrete and torches on the steel. Once the slabs were halved, the 
general contractor, Smith Rice Co., moved in with a barge and crane. The 
northern piece was lashed to a giant orange hook that hung down from the crane. 
</P>
<P>
After 4 1/2 days of painstaking preparations, the first section of the upper 
deck was ready to be removed. The crane lifted the concrete-and-steel slab 
section, swung the 100-ton structure around and gently deposited it onto the 
barge. The procedure was repeated until all the sections of the 50-foot upper 
and lower deck were removed. 
</P>
<P>
While new steel for the bridge was forged, workers prepared the damaged section 
to receive the replacement parts. Old rivets, 4,000 to 5,000 of them, were 
busted out. As big as that job was, it paled compared to the job of moving the 
bridge back into place. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the earthquake had stopped shaking, the bridge was 5 1/2 inches to 
the east and about an inch to the north from where it had been. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers know from experience how much pressure is needed to move steel that 
is resting on steel. But McLeod noted that they could not be "dead sure what it 
would take" to move the out-of-plumb sections of the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"The surfaces had been scuffed. There was paint and debris," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers groped, calculated and finally concluded that two jacks exerting 200 
tons of pressure each could shift the bridge back into place. Crews built 
platforms for the jacks and braced them to a pier of the bridge. Two bridge 
towers had been knocked out of alignment to the west, and that helped, because 
the steel was elastic. When the towers snapped back, they helped pull the 
bridge into place. 
</P>
<P>
"It worked slick as hell. It was a sophisticated, homemade scheme and it 
worked," McLeod said, adding: "Just think of it as shortening your commute." 
</P>
<P>
A CHP traffic spokesman attributed Saturday's light traffic flow to people 
using the mass transit systems. 
</P>
<P>
An elated Sgt. Kevin Kelley, who led the 30-m.p.h. procession across the upper 
deck Friday evening, said: "It was my first time getting over to Oakland in the 
past month. It's a great feeling to have the bridge back in operation."

THREAT TO SALVADORAN PRIESTS IS NOTHING NEW; 
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL AMERICA: RIGHTIST EXTREMISTS VIEWED THE SLAIN JESUIT RECTOR AS THE 
BRAINS BEHIND THE GUERRILLAS.

<P>
Symbols are rarely subtle in El Salvador, as in the execution-style slayings of 
six Jesuit educators last week. The killers not only left the bodies for all to 
see but, in case anyone should miss the point, they shattered the priests' 
skulls, too. 
</P>
<P>
Father Ignacio Ellacuria, 59, rector of the Jesuit-run Central American 
University, was the country's leading intellectual and an advocate of peace 
with justice for the poor. For that, rightist extremists believed he was the 
brains behind leftist guerrillas in the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front. 
</P>
<P>
"Like in the Spanish Civil War, they are crying, 'Death to the intelligentsia!' 
" Father Cesar Jerez said after a Mass for the victims Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Jesuits have always wanted peace with justice -- not war, but justice, and 
there you touch very profound (economic) structures. That is why they were 
killed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jesuits, and Roman Catholic priests in general, are an integral part of 
Salvadoran history and society, and such violence against them is nothing new. 
The Jesuits have educated most of El Salvador's elite, including many of those 
who now view them as Communists and traitors. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout a decade of civil war, the UCA, as the university is called, has 
been a bastion of liberal thought in El Salvador. Ellacuria and the other 
university leaders who were killed had pushed for dialogue between the 
government and rebels and put forth proposals for a political solution to the 
decade-long civil war. 
</P>
<P>
When the media were bombed or gagged, the university was one of the few sources 
of independent information. Ellacuria tried to be a voice of reason. 
</P>
<P>
"These were not the only reasonable men in El Salvador," said a former faculty 
member. "But this shows that El Salvador is not a safe place for reasonable 
men." 
</P>
<P>
The Jesuits' first conflicts with the country's landed oligarchy were over 
education. In 1974, priests teaching at the elite Externado de San Jose decided 
to open the doors of its elementary through high school to poor students. The 
decision offended the rich. 
</P>
<P>
"The dominant classes felt betrayed," said Jerez, who served with the Society 
of Jesus then. Today, he is the rector of the UCA in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
In the following years, many young Salvadoran priests took up the Vatican's 
call to denounce institutionalized violence and to work for the "preferential 
option of the poor," a religious current that became known as "liberation 
theology." 
</P>
<P>
One of those, a Jesuit named Rutilio Grande, moved to the town of Aguilares, 
north of San Salvador, where he lived with impoverished farmers and backed 
their demands for land and better salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Grande was assassinated by unidentified gunmen in March, 1977. Two months 
later, another priest, Father Alfonso Navarro, was killed in his parish in the 
capital. More than a dozen others were expelled or denied re-entry into El 
Salvador. The Jesuit-run radio YSAX was bombed, and pamphlets circulated that 
said, "Be a Patriot! Kill a Priest." 
</P>
<P>
Amid the violence, several young seminarians joined the armed Popular 
Liberation Forces, one of the five groups that eventually would make up the 
Farabundo Marti front. Ellacuria opposed their decision, arguing that they 
should work within legal institutions; instead, they left the Jesuit order. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, a group of reform-minded army officers ousted the military government 
in a coup. The new civilian-military junta included Ramon Mayorga, the rector 
of the Central American University. The new Cabinet was filled with professors 
from the UCA, and Ellacuria replaced Mayorga as rector of the university. 
</P>
<P>
The violence continued. The archbishop of San Salvador, Msgr. Oscar Arnulfo 
Romero, issued a public plea to soldiers to "disobey orders" and cease the 
repression. In March, 1980, Romero was gunned down while saying Mass. Ellacuria 
spent much of that year in exile. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Roberto D'Aubuisson, a founding father of the ruling Nationalist 
Republican Alliance, often has been accused of masterminding the Romero 
killing. Now, a member of the Legislative Assembly, D'Aubuisson has always 
denied that charge and all allegations that he operated death squads. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1983 interview with The Times, D'Aubuisson said he considered Jesuits to 
be more dangerous than armed rebels -- the "worst scum," he called them. He 
said the "black Pope" -- invoking the ancient nickname of the head of the order 
-- may have masterminded leftist rebel operations in El Salvador, Cuba and 
other countries. 
</P>
<P>
To many church and political observers, the deaths of Ellacuria and the five 
other priests mark a return to the violence of the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The military has denied any involvement in the killing of Ellacuria and his 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
The church, meanwhile has renewed Ellacuria's call for dialogue. Pope John Paul 
II has appealed to the two sides for a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
A reply to the Pope was circulated among foreign journalists Saturday, calling 
for the expulsion of several unnamed Salvadoran bishops. The letter bore the 
seal of Atty. Gen. Francisco Colorado and a signature. Colorado could not be 
reached to verify its authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time in this suffering country, there has existed a tendency called 
the Popular Church, which large sectors of society blame for the violence that 
has shaken El Salvador for many years, which has culminated in the rebels' 
violent actions this week," the attorney general wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"For that reason . . . I would like to suggest to the Beloved Father, for the 
security and well-being of all the Salvadoran flock, the at least temporary 
withdrawal from Salvadoran territory of the bishops," the letter said.

SALVADORANS FLOCK TO SHELTERS AS FIGHTING EBBS ; 
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL AMERICA: THE ARMY GAINS THE UPPER HAND AS REBELS WITHDRAW FROM SOME 
AREAS OF THE CAPITAL. 
</P>

SAN SALVADOR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As fighting slackened in some guerrilla strongholds, thousands more Salvadorans 
fled bombed-out neighborhoods in the capital Saturday, filling churches, 
schools and stadiums in one of the largest exoduses in this country's tortured 
history. 
</P>
<P>
A Salvadoran Red Cross spokesman, Pedro Varela, said 19,000 people have crowded 
42 shelters over the last week of heavy combat in the capital, which has 
claimed at least 900 lives and left another 2,000 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The number of refugees is fast approaching the 22,000 who took emergency 
shelter after an earthquake in 1986, Varela said, and could easily double with 
a lull in the war. 
</P>
<P>
"The bombs fell so close to our house -- that is what gave us the valor to walk 
though the bullets and get out of there," said Miriam Diaz, 28, who set up camp 
in the capital's main soccer stadium with her parrot and eight other members of 
her family. "It was a tremendous nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Air force planes and helicopters strafed parts of the poor neighborhoods of 
Soyapango and Mejicanos early Saturday, trying to squeeze the leftist 
guerrillas into smaller and smaller areas of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas said in a clandestine broadcast that they shot down an air force 
A-37 fighter-bomber with machine-gun fire Saturday over the eastern city of San 
Miguel. An ABC News camera crew filmed the aircraft as it was apparently hit, 
and an air traffic controller in San Miguel confirmed that it crashed. He said 
the pilot bailed out. 
</P>
<P>
In San Salvador, most of the rebels holding Mejicanos had withdrawn by dawn, 
fleeing through sewer pipes and tunnels after mining some entrances to that 
northern neighborhood of 100,000 people, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels allowed hundreds of trapped and wounded civilians to flee along 
unmined paths before the army went in to look for the few rebels who remained. 
</P>
<P>
"They took (civilian) clothes from the people and put them on. Then, they 
buried their weapons and left," said Jose Mejivar, 55, as he abandoned 
Mejicanos with everything he could fit in a sack. 
</P>
<P>
But in Soyapango, the rebels held their ground, fighting off ground troops in 
house-to-house combat and withstanding another round of aerial strafing and 
rocketing in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"There is tremendously strong resistence in Soyapango," said a Western 
diplomat. "They are well armed and surprisingly tenacious . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The combat in Soyapango, in south San Salvador, appeared to be centered in two 
six-square-block areas that sprawl over steep hills. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-backed Salvadoran army has gained the upper hand since the rebels 
launched the offensive. But it is not clear whether the rebel retreat from 
Mejicanos, or from Zacamil a day earlier, is permanent or simply a regrouping 
for new attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The army has been spread too thin to even try to drive the guerrillas from two 
northern suburbs, Apopa and Ayutuxtepeque, which the government has held 
virtually uncontested for a week. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting has affected virtually every part of San Salvador and its 1.5 million 
people since the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front rebels descended on 
the capital Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
During a tour of neighborhoods still being fought over, residents and relief 
workers pleaded with American reporters to "tell them to stop the bombing" -- a 
reference to the government air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the jungle. They have no right to bomb here," said Leopoldo 
Campos, 47, who left Mejicanos weeping and pressing a bloodied gauze pad to his 
forehead. "Tell them to take the airplanes away from here." 
</P>
<P>
Campos was wounded and his 17-year-old son was killed, he said, when "a bomb 
fell on my house" Friday. 
</P>
<P>
For days, Salvadorans have complained, on the one hand, that the guerrillas 
will not let them leave their embattled neighborhoods, lest the army lose all 
restraint in attacking them. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, they say, the army has put their neighborhoods under curfew 
and then bombed them, sometimes without warning. Many have chosen to sleep 
outdoors on the theory that all houses are suspected rebel hide-outs. 
</P>
<P>
"First, the terrorists won't let us leave; then, the government refuses to 
evacuate us," said Nicolasa Quintanilla, 50, who fled to the soccer stadium 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're being squeezed by both armies." 
</P>
<P>
Relief workers estimate that hundreds of people wounded in combat zones cannot 
be evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
Red Cross ambulances raced to and from an entrance to Mejicanos on Saturday, 
taking away more than a dozen wounded civilians.

In its third such appeal in four days, the International Red Cross urged the 
government and the rebels Saturday to declare a six-hour truce so that it can 
evacuate the wounded. So far, the rebels have agreed to the truce, but the 
government has rejected it.

had minor wounds. They also complained that nobody was providing food for them

The plight of those trapped in combat zones was worse. Many have no electricity

But as they left, reporters were mobbed by residents who said they felt trapped 
and wanted help.

LATVIANS STAGE RALLY FOR INDEPENDENCE IN CAPITAL

Hundreds of thousands of people thronged the Latvian capital of Riga on 
Saturday to celebrate the small Baltic state's declaration of independence in 
1918 -- and to protest its incorporation into the Soviet Union two decades 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Singing "God Bless Latvia," the national anthem, and other patriotic Latvian 
songs, the crowd surged through the center of Riga to rallies where speakers 
demanded independence once again from Moscow. It was the first official 
observance of Latvian independence since 1940, when it was occupied by Soviet 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
The red and white flag of independent Latvia flew from most homes and public 
buildings in Riga, according to Soviet journalists in the city, and tens of 
thousands of people waving small flags lined the banks of the Daugava River 
through the capital in a protest impressive for its solemnity. 
</P>
<P>
"A page of history was brought back to life, preserving the memory of the 
events of 1918, when the Latvian state was proclaimed," the official Soviet 
news agency Tass reported from Riga in a rare appreciation of what independence 
meant to the Latvians after centuries of Russian, Polish, Swedish and German 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
"We must fight for independence," Janes Chakste, the grandson of the first of 
independent Latvia's three presidents, told the main rally. "Latvia must be 
independent, as it was before." 
</P>
<P>
The main complaint, as elsewhere in the Soviet Union's constituent republics, 
is the deteriorating economic situation, which is matched by a conviction, also 
shared by other republics, that local leaders could do better alone. 
</P>
<P>
According to state-run Latvian television, more than 550,000 people 
participated in the citywide demonstrations, although Riga has a population of 
little more than 900,000 and Latvia a total population of about 2.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Anatoly V. Gorbunov, the republic's Communist Party chief, said in a televised 
address that the independence-day observance should "unite all the people of 
Latvia" and "enrich and deepen the understanding of our historical roots."

LIGACHEV URGES CAUTION ON REFORMS;

SOVIET UNION: MOSCOW'S LEADING CONSERVATIVE COUCHES HIS PLEA IN BLAND LANGUAGE.

Yegor K. Ligachev, the leading conservative within the Soviet Communist Party's 
ruling Politburo, called Saturday for greater caution, more discretion and a 
slower pace in implementing the country's political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev's comments immediately put him at odds with President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, who reiterated his intention earlier last week to press for broader 
and faster reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not think that there are any people who (are) satisfied with the pace and 
extent of perestroika now," Ligachev said in an interview with Radio Moscow. 
"But at the same time, I would call for more caution and discretion. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The wisdom of leadership is revealed not only in decision-making but also in 
weighing the consequences of the decisions made. We are now mostly making 
decisions that will guide us for decades to come, and this calls for much 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Although couched in non-argumentative, non-confrontational, almost bland 
language, Ligachev's comments highlighted the sharp political divisions in the 
country at a crucial time when, according to most observers here, the fate of 
the whole reform push will be decided. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, attempting to rekindle the fervent support that his reforms enjoyed 
in their first years and to regain the momentum they have lost, called earlier 
in the week for the acceleration of perestroika, or restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
"We have now reached the point in the development of the current stage of 
perestroika when we must put forward the question of speeding it up," he told a 
student conference in a major policy address. "Perestroika must advance 
consistently in all fields." 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev, however, denied he had any serious differences with Gorbachev or 
other Politburo members, the majority of whom now are more liberal than he and 
take significantly different positions on major issues. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no differences between us," Ligachev said on his relationship with 
Gorbachev. "Claims to the contrary are no more than inventions motivated by 
mistakes or a desire to drive a wedge between members of the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"I joined the Politburo together with Mikhail Gorbachev. We held the same views 
then, and we hold the same views now. Naturally, however, we may have different 
points of view on some particular matter, but in the end we come to a shared 
point of view and one decision that we implement." 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev intends to set out his position in a major speech to the Congress of 
People's Deputies, the Soviet national assembly, after it opens next month, and 
supporters are describing it in advance as an alternative platform to 
Gorbachev's. 
</P>
<P>
"With these new policies, get-rich-quick policies for a few, we are determined 
to build a bourgeoisie to lead us into the future," Anatoly Salutsky, a 
prominent writer on the conservative side of the political spectrum, said in an 
interview. "Frankly, clearly, we have a better way, and we look to Yegor 
Ligachev to reaffirm the verities of Marxism-Leninism and to articulate our 
philosophy, our policies, our course." 
</P>
<P>
According to Ligachev's supporters, far more numerous now than in the past two 
years, Gorbachev has come to realize that he is the best protection that 
perestroika has against attacks from the far right -- but that the price is 
moderation of the leadership's overall policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Ligachev is not a personal threat to Gorbachev the way that, say, (Prime 
Minister Nikolai I.) Ryzhkov might be, because he knows he will never be No. 
1," a source close to Ligachev said. "He and Gorbachev are close enough to be 
hugging one another, and they do; Ryzhkov and Gorbachev aren't, and they 
don't." 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev, re-emerging as the spokesman for what his supporters prefer to call 
the "traditional" rather than the conservative viewpoint, has carefully but 
increasingly in recent months made clear his differences with Gorbachev on the 
nature and course of the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev sees himself and other reformers holding to a middle position among 
conservatives on the far right, radicals to his left and "extremists" who 
advocate the abandonment of socialism in favor of capitalism. And, while 
sharply criticizing the left, he usually moves against the right to consolidate 
his own power. 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev, in contrast, sees an "open power struggle" under way -- a struggle 
that has clear "class roots" that separate those who have profited enormously 
from perestroika and those who have seen little improvement in their daily 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
On one side, in Ligachev's view, are the party faithful, characterized by 
"their faith in socialism, the people and the principles of internationalism," 
as he put it in a speech to the Communist Party Central Committee earlier, and 
on the other are those who "play democratic games" but support capitalism and 
nationalist causes. 
</P>
<P>
As the Soviet Union moves deeper into its reforms -- an undertaking supported 
by both leaders -- the future role and form of the Communist Party has emerged 
as a fundamental issue, and one that divides them. While Gorbachev has 
continued to uphold the party's constitutionally guaranteed "leading role," he 
has waffled in question-and-answer sessions; Ligachev, in contrast, has urged 
the party to reinforce its role, tighten discipline and take firm stands. 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev had been effectively sidelined for much of this year by allegations 
that he had taken bribes to prevent the prosecution of party officials in 
Uzbekistan, in Soviet Central Asia, on charges of corruption. While the charges 
were flimsy and were ultimately rejected as groundless by prosecutors, his 
political position was undermined. 
</P>
<P>
Although his probity had always been unquestioned and he had been known for the 
stern ethical posture he assumed and imposed on his subordinates, Ligachev told 
the Radio Moscow interviewer that he was ready to accept criticism of his 
political stand and of his actions, but that the accusations of corruption were 
"downright lies and slander." 
</P>
<P>
He had received thousands of letters of support, Ligachev added, and this had 
enabled him "to endure with courage all that some people of questionable 
integrity and political careerists have to say." 
</P>
<P>
"History is the best judge, and in the end the people will judge everyone 
according to his true merit," Ligachev said. "I am an optimist." 
</P>
<P>
After he was cleared by prosecutors and the Central Committee in September, he 
has carefully repositioned himself politically through firm, conservatively 
phrased but moderate speeches and interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Now assigned to supervise agriculture, Ligachev acknowledged in the Radio 
Moscow interview that it would be years before the Soviet Union would be able 
to feed itself.

Masked assailants stabbed and beat an Arab woman to death Saturday, hospital 
officials said. Palestinian reporters in the Gaza Strip said she was suspected 
of immoral behavior and of providing assistance to Israeli authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital officials identified the woman as 40-year-old Atiyat Inajar and 
said she died of her wounds at Nasser Hospital in the Israeli-occupied Gaza 
Strip town of Khan Yunis. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military command confirmed the death and said the woman's death is 
under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Arab doctors said troops opened fire to disperse stone-throwing 
Palestinian youths in the Gaza village of Beit Hanoun and the Shati refugee 
camp, wounding 11 protesters aged 16 to 23. 
</P>
<P>
The army command said it had no information about the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Isa Ali Sabah, 29, of the village of Khadr, near Bethlehem, died at East 
Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital on Saturday after suffering head injuries when 
stones were thrown at his car in the West Bank last month. Israel Radio said 
that Sabah lost control of his car during the assault and it crashed.

IRAQ REJECTS IRAN PROPOSAL TIED TO POWS

<P>
The Iraqi government Saturday rejected Iran's latest proposal for peace in the 
Persian Gulf, declaring that the offer to swap prisoners if Iraqi troops pull 
out of occupied zones along the border amounts to "human barter." 
</P>
<P>
"The position adopted by Iran over the issue of the prisoners of war is a 
position of blackmail. We refuse to be blackmailed," Iraqi Foreign Minister 
Tarik Aziz told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement appeared to end any immediate hope for a resolution to the 
nine-year-old conflict and left each side again blaming the other for the 
protracted deadlock in peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Iran made its latest offer last week, even as U.N. envoy Jan Eliasson was 
admitting failure after a 17-day shuttle mission between Iranian and Iraqi 
officials that resulted in little more than plans for more indirect talks. 
</P>
<P>
Iran proposed a swap of about 100,000 prisoners held by the two sides -- 70,000 
of them still captive in Iran more than a year after the August, 1988, 
cease-fire -- if Iraq agrees to pull out of the more than 386 square miles it 
occupies on the border. 
</P>
<P>
Aziz, saying that international law requires immediate release of prisoners 
without military conditions, criticized Iran for what he said was an attempt to 
barter prisoners for territorial objectives. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to use human beings as hostages to achieve political ends," he 
complained at a news conference. "I am not surprised to see the Iranians do 
that. They do the same things with the hostages in Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati had called the proposal "a move of 
good will and a bid to break the present artificial impasse which benefits no 
one." But it was clear that his offer fell short of Iraq's longstanding demand 
that Iran remove itself from the Shatt al Arab waterway, the point where the 
Tigris and Euphrates rivers merge and cut a wide path into the Persian Gulf, 
providing Iraq's only major access to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
It is the Shatt al Arab that Iran and Iraq had been fighting over for years, 
and Aziz affirmed Saturday that it is unlikely there will be any lasting peace 
in the Persian Gulf until full sovereignty over the waterway is returned to 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Though he downplayed the likelihood of resuming active hostilities along the 
tense, 750-mile-long border, Aziz said the failure to conclude a peace 
agreement leaves that possibility open. 
</P>
<P>
But Iraq is not likely to make the first hostile move, he added. "After eight 
years of war, Iraq would not resort to the use of force to resolve a matter 
that can be resolved, and should be resolved, through peaceful means." 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 journalists flew to Baghdad for the press conference, most of 
them Egyptian reporters who had expected Iraq's response to an exodus of 
Egyptian workers from Iraq, many of them complaining of poor treatment and 
difficulty in getting their money. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 Egyptians have left since the beginning of October, when a new 
Iraqi regulation took effect barring unskilled Arab workers from transferring 
more than 10 dinars a month (about $55) out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Despite additional daily flights between Baghdad and Cairo to airlift the 
workers home, thousands remain lined up at Baghdad's airport seeking passage 
home, and tension among the workers left in Iraq is escalating. 
</P>
<P>
According to unconfirmed eyewitness reports, four Egyptians were killed and 
three were injured Friday night when a massive street celebration over Egypt's 
victory in a soccer match with Algeria erupted into a near riot. 
</P>
<P>
Two Egyptians who witnessed the disturbance said that an estimated 2,000 
Egyptian workers had poured into the streets near Baghdad's Little Cairo 
shortly before 7 p.m. when a truck they described as an army utility vehicle 
bore down on the celebrants. They said the crowd attempted to disperse but was 
unable to get out of the way in time, and the vehicle ran over three of the 
workers. It stopped briefly, then moved on and struck four more people. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials have refused to confirm the report.

A roadside blast killed three British soldiers on patrol in Northern Ireland on 
Saturday, hours after a car bomb at an English garrison town injured an army 
sergeant and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
The sergeant lost both legs in the explosion, Essex county police said. 
</P>
<P>
No one immediately claimed responsibility, but police and the Home Office 
suspected the outlawed Irish Republican Army, which has targeted army 
installations in England and continental Europe as well as in Northern Ireland 
in its bloody campaign to drive the British out of the province. 
</P>
<P>
The British army patrol was in two armored vehicles in the foothills of the 
Mourne Mountains, about six miles from the Irish Republic, when an explosive 
device was detonated, apparently from beside the road, the Royal Ulster 
Constabulary said. 
</P>
<P>
The blast hurled the first vehicle off the road. All of the casualties were in 
that vehicle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Helicopters flew into the area to help the injured soldiers, but three died 
before they could be treated, police said. A fourth was seriously injured and 
hospitalized in Belfast. 
</P>
<P>
At the British army headquarters for eastern England in Colchester, 50 miles 
northeast of London, a car bomb exploded as Sgt. Andrew Mudd and his wife were 
setting out from the parking area at the married quarters, police said. The two 
were dragged from the burning wreckage of their car by a lieutenant who was 
driving past, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
One neighbor said the car was "a mass of flames." 
</P>
<P>
The couple were taken to Colchester General Hospital, where General Manager 
Mark Shackell said Mudd had lost both legs and was in serious condition after 4 
1/2 hours of surgery. He said Mudd's wife, whose name was not released, 
suffered "relatively minor" injuries. 
</P>
<P>
David Waddington, the Home Office secretary, blamed the IRA. 
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense stepped up security at military establishments across 
Britain after the Sept. 22 IRA bombing at the Royal Marines Music School in 
Deal, in southeast England, that killed 11. 
</P>
<P>
The IRA has also claimed responsibility for a series of attacks on British 
soldiers and their families in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
A soldier's wife was killed this summer and a 6-month-old girl died last month 
along with her father, a Royal Air Force corporal, in an IRA attack.

PROBLEMS MAY LEAD TO CUTS IN COLLIDER PROJECT 
</P>

<P>
Plans for the superconducting super collider are likely to be scaled back 
because of technical problems that may cause its costs to jump by up to 30%, or 
nearly $2 billion, U.S. officials and independent scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
The technical troubles recently caused the scientific managers of the 
controversial project -- which is aimed at expanding knowledge about the basic 
nature of matter without any hope of immediate practical application -- to 
propose extensive design modifications. 
</P>
<P>
But angry Energy Department officials have responded that the program is 
unlikely to win a substantial increase in its promised $5.9-billion budget and 
should instead be "built to cost," the sources said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Several officials, who asked not to be identified, said that this preliminary 
decision by the Energy Department probably will require cuts in the power and 
size of the collider -- modifications that may, in turn, raise new questions 
about the project's technical merit, jeopardizing its political future and 
thousands of associated jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Congress recently approved a $225-million down payment on the collider's 
construction over an eight-year period at Waxahachie, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Beams of protons are to be accelerated in a 53-mile tunnel and crashed together 
so scientists can examine the interaction of subatomic particles and test 
theories about the building blocks of matter and the origin of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore said in an interview that project 
managers were told that "either we're going to build it for the figure of 5.9 
(billion dollars) or we're not going to build it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that "we know we can't get the additional money in these times of 
tight money, and we simply can't go back to the Congress six months after 
promising it would be one amount and tell them it's going to be something 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said he is uncertain about whether the collider plans will be scaled 
back, because some of the proposed changes associated with added costs may have 
been gold plating. 
</P>
<P>
But the scientists involved say that many of the changes were needed just to 
meet -- not exceed -- the original specifications, and "building to cost" will 
doubtless require some technical sacrifices. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Schwitters, director of the Dallas laboratory created to supervise the 
collider's construction, said his proposed changes were "not due to flaws in 
the previous (design) work, but to advances in the state-of-the-art technology" 
that scientists would like to see incorporated in the collider.

PILOT OF BOAT IN COLLISION ALLEGEDLY LEFT THE HELM; 
</P>
<P>
HARBOR: TANKER CAPTAIN SHARES BLAME, COAST GUARD SAYS, FOR NOT GIVING RIGHT OF 
WAY. BOTH OF THEIR LICENSES MAY BE SUSPENDED.

<P>
The pilot of a sportfishing boat had gone below deck and left no one at the 
helm just before a collision with a 564-foot tanker outside Los Angeles Harbor 
late Thursday night, Coast Guard officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Cmdr. Chris Desmond said 2nd Mate Tim Filson of the fishing boat 
Shogun was primarily to blame for the crash with the tanker Sealift Antarctic. 
He said Filson may have his operating license suspended. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard spokesman said Filson, 25, broke one of the "basic rules of 
navigation" by failing to keep a proper lookout before the crash, which injured 
seven people and spilled 2,000 gallons of jet fuel at the mouth of the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
But Desmond, head of the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office in Long Beach, said 
that both vessels were to blame and that Capt. Arthur Irish of the Antarctic 
could also have his license suspended for failing to give way to the smaller 
vessel. Desmond said the fishing boat had the right of way at the time of the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
"There is fault on both sides," Desmond said. "The greater error was on the 
part of Filson because he left the bridge. That is inexcusable. But the captain 
on the Sealift Antarctic failed to properly track the target or give way." 
</P>
<P>
Desmond said that at the completion of its investigation in about two months, 
the Coast Guard will probably recommend that Filson and Irish have their 
licenses suspended for an undetermined period. An administrative law judge must 
decide whether to follow the Coast Guard recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Filson, who is being treated for cuts and a concussion at St. Mary's Medical 
Center in Long Beach, said in a telephone interview Saturday that the tanker 
was to blame for the crash. "In the general rules of the road, the vessel to 
the right has the right-of-way," Filson said. "We were to the right." 
</P>
<P>
Filson declined to say whether he left the bridge of the 80-foot fishing boat. 
The Shogun had just embarked on an overnight expedition to San Clemente Island, 
where a crew of seven was taking 35 passengers to fish for sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Irish could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Desmond said the two vessels left the harbor just before midnight. Filson, he 
said, put his boat on automatic pilot and went below deck, thinking that his 
course was running parallel to the tanker's. Investigators do not yet know why 
Filson went below deck, or how long he was away from the helm. 
</P>
<P>
The Antarctic expected the fishing boat to stay clear, as most smaller vessels 
do, even when they technically have the right of way, Desmond said. The tanker 
blasted a warning from its ship's horn when the Shogun was five minutes away 
and then moments before the collision. 
</P>
<P>
At the last instant, the pilot of the tanker swung hard to the left and Filson 
rushed back to the bridge in time to shut down his engines, but not soon enough 
to take evasive action, Desmond said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Shogun's passengers, Raul Baca of San Pedro, said that he was 
rigging his fishing poles when he saw the tanker looming about 100 yards away. 
"I didn't think we were going to hit it," Baca said. "All of a sudden someone 
yelled, 'Look Out!' and it was right there on us." 
</P>
<P>
Baca dropped his poles and dove overboard. "I was so scared I didn't know what 
to do," said Baca, 34. He was plucked out of the water, unhurt, after treading 
water for 15 minutes.

ANTI-DRUG PUSH IN PICO-UNION AREA TAKES NEW TWIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The campaign to clean up the drug-plagued Pico-Union area took a new twist 
Saturday when residents armed with brooms marched into one neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
This time, drug dealers and users apparently fought back by attempting to sweep 
the volunteer crew off streets that were barricaded five weeks ago as part of a 
narcotics crackdown, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers were called to the intersection of Lake and 11th streets after 
passers-by harassed volunteers who were removing litter from curbs and alleys 
two miles west of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Later, onlookers identified by residents as drug dealers watched sullenly from 
the distance as a handful of volunteers finished picking up trash in a 
four-block area closed to non-residents by the barricades. 
</P>
<P>
Although similar cleanup efforts in nearby neighborhoods have attracted as many 
as 150 volunteers, Saturday's effort drew only about 30 people. Some blamed the 
low turnout on intimidation by drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
City officials immediately announced that a special community meeting will be 
held Monday in hopes of boosting residents' self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"Residents are frightened," said City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who joined in 
Saturday's trash-pickup effort and witnessed some of the harassment. "They've 
learned to live among the dealers. But they're afraid of repercussions if they 
come out here." 
</P>
<P>
Molina said that other neighborhoods have formed "MASH" units -- groups that 
call themselves More Advocates for Safe Homes -- and successfully scared off 
dealers. She said members of the groups have never been harmed by narcotics 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're intimidating the drug dealers, they aren't intimidating us," she 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
However, most of Saturday's volunteers at 11th and Lake were members of a 
year-old MASH group from a Magnolia Avenue neighborhood five blocks away. That 
organization has staged three successful cleanup campaigns since its first 
beautification effort seven months ago attracted 140 volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Moises Aquilar, leader of the Magnolia Avenue group, said his organization will 
help at Monday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll explain what we've done to clean up the neighborhood and how good it 
feels," Aquilar said. "We'll tell them they shouldn't be afraid of drug dealers 
-- the drug dealers are afraid of us." 
</P>
<P>
Although the barricades and heavy police patrols have ended most narcotics 
trafficking in the targeted Pico-Union neighborhoods, drug dealers still linger 
in the area, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
"Two of them walked by here a few minutes ago when people were out sweeping," 
said Sharie Helm, whose apartment is on the corner of Lake and 11th. "They 
don't bother me. But if dealers know you're afraid, they'll harass you." 
</P>
<P>
Martin Castro, who manages an 11th street grocery, praised the cleanup effort 
but said he was not surprised by the light turnout. "I think some people are 
scared," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although several cleanup volunteers said police took one suspect into custody, 
officers at the Rampart station had no details. 
</P>
<P>
"They were giving the people doing the work out there a bad time, with the bad 
guys saying they didn't want the area cleaned up," Sgt. John Wickham said. "We 
sent people out there to break it up."

MARKDOWNS MAY DAMPEN RETAILERS' CHRISTMAS CHEER; 
</P>
<P>
SHOPPING: STORE OWNERS FEAR A POTENTIAL PRICE-CUTTING WAR. SOME ARE FIGHTING 
BACK WITH SERVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This should be a white Christmas for America's leading retailers -- in fact, 
some already seem to be turning a little pale. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one is predicting an industrywide disaster, many department store 
and specialty shop executives fear that an unusually fierce price-cutting war 
will erupt during the holiday shopping season. While that is good news for 
customers shopping on a budget, it brings out the Scrooge in people on the 
other side of the cash register, who normally count on Christmas for a big 
chunk of their profits. 
</P>
<P>
For retailers, beset by worrisome long-term trends and financial turmoil at 
some big chains this year, "the primary objective is to escape with as few 
bruises as possible," said C. Scott Killips, a vice president with the 
consulting firm Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll see markdowns of 50% to 60%, no doubt about it," predicted analyst 
Sarah Stack of the Los Angeles brokerage Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, markdowns generally are not expected to be quite as 
sharp as elsewhere because of the relative strength of the region's economy and 
the financial health of most of its major stores. Even so, price reductions 
here began right after Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of a survey sent to 1,200 Southern California retailers by 
the accounting firm Touche Ross &amp; Co. show that roughly 80% of those 
responding expect their gross profit margins to be flat or down during the fall 
and winter months. The reasons: among other things, higher labor costs and 
profit-squeezing price competition. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from fretting over markdowns, retailers this Christmas season are 
emphasizing customer service -- in part, to shield themselves somewhat from the 
price wars. With the enormously successful Nordstrom department store chain 
setting the standard, everyone locally from C &amp; R Clothiers to Vons 
supermarkets is promoting the quality of its service to attract shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers are also looking for early signs of what will be the hottest-selling 
products. Although people with money will always buy gifts, there is concern 
that consumers are unenthusiastic about this year's offerings. "People are kind 
of spent out," said Rosalind Wells, chief economist of the National Retail 
Merchants Assn. "We've had a seven-year expansion, and a lot of things already 
have been bought." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Sandra Shaber, an economic analyst with The Futures Group 
consulting firm, added that the "jaded, bored, bargain-hunting consumer can 
still be captured by someone with a new gimmick." 
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, apparel is expected to do well compared to last year, when 
many women were cool to the available fashions. Television sets, videocassette 
recorders and other home electronics equipment are projected to sell fairly 
briskly as well, but analysts predict that big-ticket items such as furniture 
and appliances will move slowly. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, a handful of novelty gifts are expected to emerge as hits, but store 
managers say it is too soon to pick the big winner. A leading candidate is 
"Rock'n Flowers," battery-powered daisies selling for $30 that "dance" to the 
sound of music or a loud voice. 
</P>
<P>
Still, retailers are mainly preoccupied with the bottom line, amid a host of 
factors that are consorting to drive down prices and profits. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, much of the concern stems from the bleak financial condition of 
both Campeau Corp., parent of the Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores 
chains, and of L. J. Hooker Corp., which owns B. Altman and Bonwit Teller. The 
companies have been brought to their knees by hefty debts from acquisitions. In 
another move that recently shook the retailing industry, the Saks Fifth Avenue 
and Marshall Field's chains were put up for sale, but analysts say those firms 
are in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
Experts speculate that the Campeau and Hooker stores could grow desperate for 
cash and resort to sharp markdowns to bring in customers, triggering a 
cutthroat battle throughout the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Campeau nor Hooker has department stores or specialty shops in Southern 
California. Consequently, "people in New York may be getting better buys this 
Christmas than in California," said George Rosenbaum, president of the Chicago 
market research firm Leo J. Shapiro &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the fallout from the retailing industry's acquisition spree during the 
past few years may be felt in the Southland. Bullock's, now owned by debt-heavy 
R. H. Macy &amp; Co., recently surprised competitors with newspaper ads 
trumpeting that it will not be undersold on women's coats. 
</P>
<P>
Some retail experts suggested that the move could be part of a broad 
price-cutting effort to win back business from Nordstrom. That was denied, 
however, by a Bullock's spokeswoman. Bullock's will have "some sales, which is 
always the case this time of year, but we will not be involved in price 
slashing," said spokeswoman Kathleen Waugh. 
</P>
<P>
The Campeau and Hooker problems also may indirectly influence prices locally 
and nationally. Industry analysts have suggested that a number of apparel 
makers -- worried about the ability of Campeau and Hooker stores to pay their 
bills after the Christmas rush ends -- will try to ship more of their 
merchandise to off-price retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers, meanwhile, are struggling to change widespread consumer shopping 
patterns that have narrowed profit margins. Their main problem is that more and 
more shoppers are putting off their buying until merchandise is discounted 
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
"There were days when 15% to 20% reductions would bring shoppers in the store. 
That is no longer the case," said Gordon Cooke, executive vice president of New 
York-based Bloomingdale's. He said it now takes reductions of 30% to 50% to 
draw a rush of shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Several major companies, most notably Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., have responded 
by switching to "everyday low prices" -- that is, offering stable and 
relatively low, if not rock-bottom, prices. So far, though, there is little 
evidence that the strategy is working. The middle-of-the-road stores are being 
hurt by competition on one side from the high-end chains and on the other side 
by discounters and off-price shops. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the waiting-for-sales trend, for the past several years Christmas 
shoppers have increasingly put off much of their buying until the last days of 
the shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers commonly fear that last-minute shoppers will buy less expensive goods 
and fewer accessories or, worst of all, will take their business to other 
stores. The typical solution for reversing the pattern: offering more service 
and -- what else? -- earlier sales. 
</P>
<P>
With Christmas falling on a Monday this year, giving consumers a full weekend 
for last-minute buying, retailers are particularly nervous. Working in 
retailers' favor, though, is the apparently increasing awareness among 
consumers that if they wait too long, the merchandise that they want won't be 
around because of tighter inventories. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Violet Leisher, a department head at Midway Medical Center in West 
Los Angeles, says she started her holiday shopping a month ago. "Every year 
(before this one) I have shopped later and later, and you get less and less of 
a selection," she explained. "I've already shopped and taken advantage of 
sales." 
</P>
<P>
She also started shopping early to avoid the year-end crowds at the malls and 
the traffic tie-ups that result when winter rains begin. 
</P>
<P>
Other consumers who are pressed for time have taken more of their business to 
mail-order houses. Analysts expect mail-order firms to make further inroads 
this Christmas, but at a slower pace, partly because of the lower prices 
offered by some conventional retailers. Mail-order firms themselves, including 
Wisconsin-based Lands' End, have been hurt recently as dozens of newcomers have 
entered the field. 
</P>
<P>
The backdrop for the intensified price competition is a national economy that 
is giving mixed signals after a long recovery. The federal government reported 
last week, for instance, that lower auto sales brought overall retail sales 
down 1% in October, the biggest one-month drop since January, 1987. On top of 
that, job creation in the private sector and personal income growth have been 
slower in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that consumer confidence remains high but it could falter if more 
discouraging news breaks. "If on Nov. 20 we have a 300-point drop in the stock 
market, people could change plans very abruptly," Rosenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
All told, analysts expect consumers' Christmas spending to rise a modest 5% to 
7% this year, down from roughly 9% in 1988. After discounting the impact of 
inflation, the projected growth is in the 2% to 3 1/2% range. Economists are 
not giving earnings forecasts, but many say they expect profits to rise even 
less than sales because of the likelihood of price cutting. 
</P>
<P>
In some quarters, though, is a measure of optimism. Philip M. Hawley, chairman 
and chief executive of Los Angeles-based Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., said 
the Southland's retail market will benefit from having settled down after being 
roiled in recent years by corporate mergers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably as stable a market as we've seen in Southern California in a 
number of years," Hawley said. 
</P>
<P>
And even if retailing experts are more worried than usual this year, some note 
that concerns always run high around now. "This time last year everybody was 
saying it'll be a terrible year, but people now look back and say it wasn't 
that bad," said David W. Stewart, an associate professor of marketing at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in a market as tough as this year's, paying some extra attention to the 
business couldn't hurt retailers. "We're in a situation where a weekend can 
make or break your business," said Bateman Eichler's Stack. "Retailers have to 
be able to turn on a dime." 
</P>
<P>

Figures are all in 1982 dollars to compensate for the effects of inflation.

GOD'S FEMININE SIDE; 
</P>
<P>
MONTHLY WORSHIP GROUP FOCUSES ON BIBLICAL ISSUES OF INTEREST TO WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The service began with a story. It told the saga of Elisabeth, a woman of the 
Bible who for many years could not have children because of what was described 
as her own infertility. 
</P>
<P>
That inspired a sermon by the Rev. Nita Hooper-Todd, pastor of Dominguez United 
Methodist Church. "This is typical of male translation," she said of the Bible 
passage under study. In those days they didn't talk much about low sperm 
count." 
</P>
<P>
Thus began a recent worship service in Long Beach of Justice for Women, an 
organization dedicated to the controversial proposition that God has a feminine 
side. It was formed by a group of local women -- several of them ordained 
ministers of various denominations -- who feel left out of traditional worship 
services. Their mission: to promote broader participation of women in church 
life and to encourage the revision of church services, both in language and in 
concept, to include feminine interpretations of God and theology. 
</P>
<P>
"This nourishes and strengthens me so that I can go out and nourish others," 
said Caroline Roper-Deyo, who attended the recent service with her 3-year-old 
daughter, Darwyyn, named after the Celtic goddess of courage and friendship. 
</P>
<P>
Said Joan Daniels, another worshiper: "I sense something here that is rare in 
the regular church." 
</P>
<P>
What that is, organizers say, is a concept of God that includes women, 
expressed in a worship service that reflects God's feminine aspect. More 
precisely, an appreciation of the Holy Spirit as feminine as well as masculine, 
and the church as an institution fully accessible to women. 
</P>
<P>
It is an idea that has evoked strong objections in some quarters. And it is one 
that has become a major cause among the small cadre of local women dedicated to 
its dissemination. 
</P>
<P>
For too long, they say, most mainstream Christian churches nationwide have 
spoken of God in exclusively male terms; God is routinely referred to, and 
understood to be, a "He" rather than a "She." Most Christian liturgies, hymns 
and stories are presented with masculine pronouns and male imagery. And though 
most major denominations now allow women to be ordained as ministers, those 
women still tend to play supportive rather than major leadership roles, 
especially on the regional and national levels, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"Women are involved in the church," said Peg Beissert, a Presbyterian minister 
who helped found the group, "but mainly they're involved in the kitchens of the 
church." 
</P>
<P>
To begin changing that, Justice for Women holds monthly female-oriented 
interdenominational worship services attended by as many as 25 people at Long 
Beach's First Church of the Brethren. That is headquarters for the South Coast 
Ecumenical Council, an organization devoted to promoting local religious 
harmony, that sponsors the women's group. 
</P>
<P>
"God has many faces, both male and female," said Roper-Deyo. "We have damaged 
ourselves and our children by being in institutions that perpetuate the idea 
that God is masculine." 
</P>
<P>
Said Daniels: "I've had a difficult time connecting with the male imagery of 
God. This has been a healing time; I've been able to progress in my spiritual 
journey without being blocked by the (those) images." 
</P>
<P>
Reaction among mainstream churches has ranged from open support to staunch 
disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
"The Scriptures evolved out of a male-dominated society in which women were 
mere possessions, so most of the imagery of God we have is male dominated," 
said George McClaren, rector of St. Gregory Episcopal Church. While he 
personally endorses the aims of the women's group and has even hired a 
full-time female priest to help realize them in his church, McClaren said, many 
Episcopalians oppose rewriting church liturgy. That makes it difficult for him 
to consistently use non-sexist language in his services. 
</P>
<P>
"God to me is beyond being understood as exclusively male or female," McClaren 
said. "The witness we have of having women fully involved at every level (of 
the church) is a very powerful witness." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Giles, on the other hand, takes a different tack entirely. "Jesus was a 
man and Jesus was God," said Giles, an associate pastor at the 1,200-member 
Grace Brethren Church. "Jesus said 'I am the father' and that's what God 
intended." 
</P>
<P>
Based on his denomination's reading of the Bible, Giles said, women are not 
allowed to become pastors nor even to assume any major decision-making 
positions in the church. Nor does the denomination favor any revision of the 
male-oriented Scripture or liturgy. "There's an old saying that the hand that 
rocks the cradle rules the world," Giles said. "(Women) have tremendous input 
into the lives of children who then grow up to be the leaders." 
</P>
<P>
And even the head of the group's sponsoring organization says he has mixed 
feelings about what it is advocating. While fully supportive of women's 
participation at all levels of church life, he has serious reservations 
regarding the proposed revision of church liturgy to include gender-neutral 
language, said Ralph J. Mosby, a Baptist minister and president of the South 
Coast Ecumenical Council, under whose auspices the women meet. 
</P>
<P>
"There is the reality that women have been left out of the picture," Mosby 
said, "and that is changing quite a bit. But to change the name of the Father 
to include a feminine position -- I would not accept that." 
</P>
<P>
Even though much of the language in church services is male-oriented, he said, 
it is not meant to be exclusive of women. 
</P>
<P>
"My basic position," Mosby said, "is that the name Father was given as a means 
of expressing the culture out of which this theology came, which was very 
masculine oriented. I don't see how that subordinates women; whenever I read 
the Scriptures and I come to a word that refers to God as Him, I don't 
interpret it as meaning 'him' in gender, but (as meaning) humanity." 
</P>
<P>
Such criticisms do not seem to have dampened the spirits of those attending the 
monthly alternative services, which, although open to both genders, attract 
mostly women. There, sitting in a circle in one of the church meeting rooms, 
the recent worshipers engaged in a series of responsive readings about the 
labor of childbirth and sacrifices of valiant women in history, then joined in 
a discussion of marriage and motherhood, and finally sang a rousing anthem 
called "Mother and God." 
</P>
<P>
"It's liberating and empowering," Nola Lamkin, a member of the group, said of 
the experience. "It plays right into people's value structures and affects how 
they feel about each other and God." 
</P>
<P>
Added Marilyn Russell Bittle, another member: "What we're trying to do is 
educate. This will build self-esteem."

CITY'S 'ESSENCE' CAPTURED ON PAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long Beach is abandoning its old logo, a drawing of City Hall, for a slicker 
image of rolling waves and skyscrapers. The design was chosen from 137 entries 
in a logo contest, and the winner, Paul Showalter Design of San Gabriel, will 
receive $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Ernie Kell said the logo captures the "essence of Long Beach. It depicts 
the meeting of an important urban center with the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
The new logo will be used on city publications, stationery and signs.

STUDENTS LEARN HARD LESSONS ON WHAT IT MEANS TO BE POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The poverty was much worse than Lisa Tamburelli had ever imagined. 
</P>
<P>
On a back street of downtown Los Angeles, where tall buildings were shrouded by 
a smoggy haze and the stench of rotten garbage and human urine filled the air, 
Tamburelli and several other students from St. Paul High School in Santa Fe 
Springs worked tirelessly, setting up a food line on the sidewalk before the 
lunch hour. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, the poor walked out from behind shacks, cars and trash cans. Soon 
hundreds of hungry people, most dressed in rags, formed a straight line along 
the sidewalk and down around the corner. One by one, they came up to the food 
table, taking a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, a scoop of salad and a cup of 
cold water. 
</P>
<P>
Tamburelli, 17, said she did not really know much about poverty. It was just a 
topic she had read and heard about. The poor were faceless -- until now. By the 
end of the day, Tamburelli said she had learned hard lessons about the needy. 
</P>
<P>
She is ready to go back to Skid Row, she said. It is a place where she feels 
she can make a small difference. 
</P>
<P>
Every Monday students from St. Paul High School visit Skid Row in Los Angeles 
and Santa Ana to help members of the Catholic Worker, a Roman Catholic social 
service organization, feed the poor. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Paul High School volunteer program was started 17 years ago by social 
justice teacher Daniel Jiru. Jiru said he started encouraging students to 
participate in the program when he realized that they had little concept of 
what it meant to be needy. 
</P>
<P>
"I was teaching a contemporary issues class when I realized that the students 
were not connecting with what we were studying," Jiru said. "Many live in a 
white ghetto up here. They're middle-class kids and they just don't see it (the 
poverty.)" 
</P>
<P>
Jiru also started an annual March for Hunger. Every December students from the 
Catholic high school walk from the poorest parts of East Los Angeles through 
Hollywood and Beverly Hills to the beach at Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"They see the poorest of the poor to the playpens of the rich and famous," Jiru 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And when the march is over, the money the students raise is used to buy food 
and other supplies for the needy. 
</P>
<P>
Jiru, who was recently named a Reader's Digest Hero in Education for his 
efforts, estimates that several thousand students have participated in the Skid 
Row trips and the March for Hunger over the years. Last year, about 900 
students signed up for the march. Nearly $16,000 was raised. This year's march 
will be Dec. 10, Jiru said. 
</P>
<P>
The lessons the students receive from working on Skid Row abound. 
</P>
<P>
Several students who recently helped with the food line in downtown Los Angeles 
said they were shocked to see so many poor children, a memory they cannot erase 
from their minds. 
</P>
<P>
"When I thought about the homeless, I always thought about adults," Tamburelli 
said. "I never thought about whole families being out there." 
</P>
<P>
Mireya Medrano, 17, added: "When I go to bed at night, I think about the 
families out there, sleeping on the streets, sleeping in boxes, going without 
food. I want to do all I can to help them." 
</P>
<P>
The students' day downtown begins at about 8 a.m. at the Catholic Worker 
headquarters, a historic, but run-down house not far from Skid Row. There they 
make sandwiches in an assembly-line fashion, say a prayer, and then pile into a 
van. 
</P>
<P>
They usually set up the food line at Towne Avenue and 6th Street, where the 
homeless have come to expect them. 
</P>
<P>
"They're amazingly polite," Medrano said of the people who frequent the food 
line. "They really appreciate what we are doing for them." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the people in the food line responded favorably to the young 
volunteers. Several smiled and said, "Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
"When they see young kids, it brightens their day," Jiru said. "It shows them 
that the younger generation is a caring generation, they have not just chucked 
them out." 
</P>
<P>
Tamburelli said after she graduates in the spring, she plans to continue 
helping the poor.

Photo, Smoking Lamp Goes Out With Pomp and Big Puff There was a lot of smoke, 
but they put out the fire for good at the Veterans Administration Hospital in 
Long Beach. The occasion was a celebration at noon Thursday billed as "Kicking 
the Habutt." The kickoff centered around a giant, 20-foot-long cigarette that 
was cradled in an oversize 4-foot ashtray decked out with balloons in the 
hospital patio area. Archie Sanchez, left, of Paramount lights the symbolic 
cigarette he designed that looks the size of a cannon. Then team captains 
representing 40 quitters of the smoking habit run up with fire extinguishers to 
put out the cigarette, top left. Later, people who pledged to quit smoking were 
handed a survival guide and given a chance to autograph the cigarette before it 
was destroyed by a "Cigarette Buster" wielding a chain saw. Adding to the color 
of the occasion were uniformed cheerleaders from Monte Vista High School, a 
72-member marching band and special speakers. The veterans hospital declared 
itself a smoke-free environment beginning Monday to coincide with the Great 
American Smokeout day. The policy will apply to everyone -- employees, 
patients, volunteers and visitors to the medical center. Smoking cessation 
classes will be offered to assist people in kicking the habit. Officials said 
the policy is intended to set an example in the community for clean air and 
good health, and enhance the well-being of patients and employees. KAREN TAPIA

HARVARD, YALE OFFER GENTEEL 'THE GAME'

NEW HAVEN, Conn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chauffeured Rolls-Royces sit majestically in the late-autumn New England sun. 
Catered tailgate parties complete with caviar and candelabras dot the Yale Bowl 
parking lot. Tweed abounds, enough to warm what a smuggled swig of Chivas Regal 
can't reach. 
</P>
<P>
After 106 years of practice, these Harvard and Yale men know how to throw a 
football game. Modesty not being their strong point, they call it The Game. 
</P>
<P>
President George Bush, Yale Class of '48, was sent a written invitation by the 
team's seniors to attend Saturday's game. Bush declined -- busy with world 
stuff -- but no doubt he requested the final score before night's end. 
</P>
<P>
He would be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the MIT student body were not invited, however. The Cambridge, 
Mass.,-based scholars, well known for their high-tech game-day pranks, were 
shooed away from the Yale Bowl early Wednesday morning by campus security 
police. Security chief Harold McGrath later announced that he personally had 
checked "every single strand of wire" in the stadium and that the Bowl was 
absolutely, positively safe from intruders. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Jon Reese, Yale's 113th football captain, continued his remarkable 
comeback, though no one is quite sure how. 
</P>
<P>
On Halloween evening, a drunk driver rammed his car into Reese's small Pontiac. 
The collision shattered Reese's jaw bone, split his lip from top to bottom, 
tore the gums away from his teeth -- four of which were missing after impact -- 
and tore a ligament in his left arm. Surgeons spent two hours reconstructing 
his face that night at The Hospital of Saint Raphael. When Jon Reese awoke, his 
father gently kissed him on the forehead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing you're alive," his father said softly. 
</P>
<P>
Reese's father had gone to see the wreckage. There was only the suggestion of a 
car left. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, wearing a specially designed face mask and mouthpiece, Reese played 
his final game for Yale. The bitter wind aggravated the nerve endings in his 
mouth, so much so, he said, that it felt like "someone was pressing needles in 
there." 
</P>
<P>
But he played and cherished every moment of it, despite Harvard's 37-20 upset 
of Yale before 59,263. The Game touches people that way. 
</P>
<P>
For one wonderful weekend each season, time slows to a pace that Harvard and 
Yale, college football's most celebrated and lasting rivalry, can better relate 
to. It is a pace that allows for favored recollections, for handshakes between 
old friends, for moments, it seems, found only in the relative innocence of the 
Ivy League, where athletic scholarships, football dormitories, spring practice, 
redshirts, freshman eligibility and scandals don't exist. 
</P>
<P>
"The players work a job," Harvard Coach Joe Restic said. "They take out a loan. 
They get a grant from the school. That's the way it still should be done. He 
doesn't get anything for nothing. He paid a price for it. One thing that 
happens to you in these situations is that the institution and the program 
teach players to survive." 
</P>
<P>
There is a charm to The Game, beginning with the Harvard jerseys, which feature 
numerals and Latin. Above each shoulder pad is the motto, Veritas -- truth. 
</P>
<P>
And when's the last time you heard fight songs . . . in public? Here, you do. 
For instance, Cole Porter wrote "Bulldog, Bulldog" for Yale. And what lyrics. A 
sampling: 
</P>
<P>
"Bulldog, Bulldog, bow, wow, wow . . . " 
</P>
<P>
How often does a sports information office, as did Yale's this week, get phone 
calls from alums located across the world, all of them asking for coordinates 
so they could aim their satellite dishes for a closed-circuit television 
broadcast? 
</P>
<P>
And how many times do you see a freshmen football game pack the stands the way 
the Yale Bullpups and Harvard Yardlings did Friday afternoon at Yale's Clinton 
E. Frank Field, a cozy facility located next to the aging baseball stadium made 
famous by first baseman Bush? 
</P>
<P>
Try every November. 
</P>
<P>
Among those watching the mini-version of The Game was former Yale quarterback 
Brian Dowling, Class of '69. Dowling is the fifth-leading passer in Yale 
history and led the Bulldogs to Ivy League championships in 1967 and 1968. He 
inspired Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Garry Trudeau, another Yale 
graduate, to create a football character named B.D., in honor of the Yale 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact," Dowling said, reaching into his wallet, "I think I have a couple 
left." With that, he pulled out a business card. On it was his name, his 
company's name in New York City and a small replica of Doonsebury's B.D. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote Trudeau asking him if I could do this," Dowling said. "He said, 'Sure, 
I didn't ask your permission when I used you in the strip.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dowling watched the Harvard freshmen take a 14-10 halftime lead. Yale 
eventually overtook Harvard in the third quarter and won, 31-27, to cap an 
undefeated season. Meanwhile, the Yale jayvees defeated Harvard on an adjacent 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Bow, wow, wow. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Dowling joined other Yale alums in a touch football game against 
their Harvard counterparts. He even completed a touchdown pass to former 
Chicago Bear safety Gary Fencik, Yale '76. 
</P>
<P>
This is a weekend of shared experiences. The glee clubs joined voices. The 
debate clubs met to determine if Harvard still stood for excellence. The debate 
was a draw. There were croquet matches played on the campus golf courses. 
Intramural games were played between the two schools. There was drinking, 
sing-a-longs, speeches galore. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, there was The Game. 
</P>
<P>
Yale began Saturday guaranteed at least a share of the Ivy League title. But 
this being Coach Carm Cozza's 25th season, the Bulldogs were in a selfish mood. 
They wanted the championship for themselves, but they mostly wanted it for 
Cozza. 
</P>
<P>
Next to the Yale practice fields is a cemetery. Cozza often tells friends he 
would like to be buried there, the better to watch his beloved teams. 
</P>
<P>
"They really try here," he said. "Players come out for football because they 
really want to play." 
</P>
<P>
Cozza is a romantic. He recently walked into the Yale locker room and was 
blasted by the sound of heavy metal rock music. What happened to the good old 
days, asked Cozza, when players listened to Yale fight songs to get ready for a 
game? 
</P>
<P>
So shortly before the Bulldogs left their locker room Saturday, Cozza 
instructed someone to flip on a cassette player. Soon, rousing renditions of 
school tunes, courtesy of a Yale band recording, blared from the speakers. 
</P>
<P>
Across the way was Harvard. Restic's team had struggled early in the season, 
but it entered The Game healthy and hopeful. Once a preseason pick for first 
place, Harvard was reduced to playing for a .500 season and the satisfaction of 
denying Yale an outright Ivy League title. 
</P>
<P>
"Every game is so different," Restic said earlier in the week. "Things will 
happen in this ballgame that have never happened before. Someone will rise to 
the surface, do something you didn't know they could. You'll be shocked. You 
never know." 
</P>
<P>
Restic and Cozza take The Game seriously, as they should. A victory can save a 
season, to say nothing of a job. Last year, Yale struggled but upset Harvard in 
the final game. "And it made for a warm winter," Cozza said. 
</P>
<P>
This time Restic and Harvard (5-5) will warm themselves by the memories of 
Saturday's victory. It was the fifth time in the last 16 years that Harvard has 
forced Yale (8-2) to share the Ivy League championship, this time with 
Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking out the visiting locker room window today and I see a big 
American flag," Restic said, his voice cracking with emotion. "I see the Yale 
flag, the Harvard flag. I see people coming in, some barely able to walk for 
this game. That tells you something. 
</P>
<P>
"Amateur athletics at its best." he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Yale Bowl is 75 years old. It aged considerably as Harvard stunned the 
Bulldogs with two second-period touchdowns and a 14-0 lead. Halfback Silas 
Myers did most of the work with a two-yard scoring run and an 18-yard pass 
reception from quarterback Tim Perry for the other touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
And imagine McGrath's surprise when, with 7:27 remaining in the second quarter, 
the cap of a goalpost upright magically popped off, revealing . . . a red and 
white MIT banner. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed Yale couldn't shut anyone out Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Halftime was interesting. The Harvard Band made fun of Bush. The Yale Precision 
Marching Band made fun of itself. No two Yale members dressed alike. Instead, 
they wore Goofy hats, pith helmets, baseball caps or whatever else fell from 
their closet shelves that morning. The precision marching was just an 
unsubstantiated rumor. 
</P>
<P>
But the Yale Band can play. It coaxed about 60 Yale students to strip to their 
skivvies (bras and panties for the females) in the 30-degree temperature with a 
sexy little number made famous, no doubt, by Gypsy Rose Lee. And it played away 
as Yale, down, 21-0, in the third quarter, closed the gap to 21-20 by the end 
of the period. 
</P>
<P>
That would do it for Yale highlights. Harvard scored three times in the fourth 
quarter, adding 16 more points to its total. Restic had his treasured win and 
Cozza had his bittersweet Ivy League co-championship. 
</P>
<P>
At game's end, the public address announcer invited the remaining fans onto the 
field to meet the players, coaches and, in a fitting twist, each other. At The 
Game, it seemed the right thing to do.

DURAN IS CRAVING YET ANOTHER TASTE OF GREATNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Want to fight?" Roberto Duran asks suddenly in clear English, whirling from 
the heavy bag that he punished with his hands of stone. His eyes turn bright 
and he bares his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
As a shoeshine boy in Panama City, Duran must have struck fear in kids who'd 
crowd his corner. In fact he didn't wait for trouble; he'd walk around and 
shove the boys, looking for a fight. 
</P>
<P>
But that was long ago, when his glare meant something terrible was about to 
happen. Now he is middle-aged and only kidding. 
</P>
<P>
Like a lounge act, Duran works a small space off the Tropicana Hotel lobby as 
tourists laugh and applaud. He is at once training for Sugar Ray Leonard on 
Dec. 7 and for later life as an entertainer. Someday he wants to sing latin 
songs, and he'll have stories to tell: about knocking down a horse with one 
punch ("Si. One punch."), or slipping in a second steak on top of the first 
when his manager wasn't looking. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a sample of his current act. He kneels in the ring to kiss the gloved 
hands of two showgirls who have jeweled tiaras so tall it's a wonder they 
didn't tip onto their heads climbing between the ropes. With pictures taken and 
the blue-feathered ladies safely offstage, he renders a sparring partner 
helpless with a right hand. Finally he skips rope as the tightly packed crowd 
moves in, risking whiplash, while others lean from a balcony and shout, 
"Roberto, Roberto." 
</P>
<P>
It's a Las Vegas sideshow jammed outside the entranceways to the Folies Bergere 
and La Valise luggage and handbags, beneath an "atrium lounge" where men sit 
back with their drinks and tell women about Roberto Duran. They all note his 
cheerfulness. 
</P>
<P>
Duran has been known to be surly. Over the years he's rebelled from roadwork. 
Against his handlers' wishes he's filled his plate time and again, ballooning 
his body. The third of nine children from a Panamian slum called Chorrillo, he 
fought in the streets for his food; but since tasting greatness he's never 
wanted for an extra helping of dessert. 
</P>
<P>
Alvaro Riet, Duran's interpreter, observes him playing to the crowd and says, 
"I've never seen him so mean for a fight." 
</P>
<P>
In boxing, one can be told what appears to be the opposite. It seems that Duran 
is quite content, befitting one who is about to receive $8 million -- even if 
$1.5 million is due to the Internal Revenue Service, which reportedly by 
mistake sent him a whopping refund on his taxes from several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
This surprise money was sent to a man who at one count owned five Alfas, two 
Mercedes, one Mercury Marquis, one Fiat Sport, one van and a Trans Am. 
</P>
<P>
You think he didn't treat himself to an extra steak? 
</P>
<P>
He's said to have spent madly since he had anything to spend, and he is ready 
to receive and spend more. He seems to be casually awaiting his payday as if he 
resolved long ago what he's going to do against Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the fight that will make everything right for him," says Riet. He is 
referring to another time, Nov. 25, 1980, in New Orleans, when Duran cried out 
"no mas" against a taunting Leonard. Duran appears so much at ease one surmises 
he is thinking that he might or might not win, but at least he will regain his 
honor, to say nothing of the money. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, he enjoys his show. He used to perform in places like Gleason's Gym 
in New York, where men chewed cigars and the smoke was thick and he was in his 
prime. That too was long before the age of COMDEX, the name of the computer 
convention that has landed 130,000 extra people in this desert town and swelled 
the fighter's throng each day with software executives. 
</P>
<P>
The business suits also detect Duran's buoyant personality. What they don't 
seem to know is that he can be given to awful fits of violence, such as the 
terrifying punch to the groin that helped him lift the lightweight title from 
Ken Buchanan in 1972, or the burrowing thumb to the eye that Duran used to 
greet Davey Moore in 1983 when he took the junior middleweight title. Duran is 
said to have been relaxed before those fights; when he's been ready, he's been 
relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
Unpredictable sometimes, Duran never was as out of character as he was the 
night he quit against Leonard. For this, he gets another chance and $8 million. 
It's so improbable that Duran's mother, Clara Ester Samaniego, has to see this 
for herself. She is on her way to this land of opportunity to watch her son, 
now 38, fight here for the first time. It's been 18 years since he first fought 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Back then he was taught to be a two-handed boxer by wily Ray Arcel, now 
retired, but Duran still loves to brawl. He doesn't bother to set up Darwin 
Richards with a left but merely brings a right uppercut toward Richards's chin. 
Richards blocks it with his elbow, but screams in pain as if Duran has broken 
his arm. It is encased in ice. 
</P>
<P>
Ali Sanchez tries his luck. He peppers Duran's face with a left, as Leonard 
might. From nowhere Duran hits Sanchez with that right of stone. A roar from 
the crowd. Another right. Sanchez wobbles into Duran's arms. No mas. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care how Leonard comes, whether he comes to run or he comes to fight, 
I have been waiting for him for nine years," Duran tells the crowd in Spanish. 
So says Riet. Everyone who understands howls approval, and those who don't join 
in belatedly. His wife, Felicidad, mother of their six children, smiles. "He's 
in shape," she says through an interpreter. "He's better than I've seen him." 
</P>
<P>
He puts on his jacket and signs autographs. What a fine show, people say, as an 
entourage of men wearing Roberto Duran T-shirts clears a way through the lounge 
tables. 
</P>
<P>
"Good luck, Champ." 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you, Mister." 
</P>
<P>
Duran does interviews when the sun goes down in what may be described as a room 
of gloom. The mood-setter is manager Carlos Hubbard, a thin man with a tall 
Afro. Although there is plenty of furniture, Hubbard sits on a stool in a 
corner, cutting his nails. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Hubbard will take questions, which is more than trainer Nestor Quinones 
will do. Of Leonard's closed-to-the-public workouts, Hubbard says with 
contempt: "Sugar can hide all he wants. It's not going to help him." So while 
Hubbard may appear to be a mysterious prophet from a foreign land, his message 
is familiar and American, a variation on Joe Louis's "he can run but he can't 
hide." 
</P>
<P>
The sofa in Riet's room is so long Duran looks small sitting on the end. A man 
of Indian and Spanish descent, he has watery brown eyes and swept-back black 
hair. He has a mustache and trim beard and an aging brown face. His right hand 
of stone is soft as butter. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been waiting and praying to God that Sugar Ray would come out to say yes 
to this fight," comes Duran's words through Riet. "Praying and working." 
</P>
<P>
He has been working off weight. After beating Iran Barkley in February, Duran 
ate his way to the neighborhood of 200 pounds; now he is down to a fighting 
weight of 161. Still he'll never look like the lightweight rail of 135 he was 
before his appetite grew. 
</P>
<P>
Duran rubs the fingers of his left hand in his right, although it's hard to say 
he's nervous. He doesn't seem particularly happy or unhappy. He shows no sign 
of being in a hurry. He's talking on and Riet is saying, "He's been praying to 
God for this opportunity and he's going to be ready. He expects Sugar Ray to be 
ready," not like Leonard was when he and Thomas Hearns fought to a draw in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
"He is going to be much better," says Duran of Leonard. "More fast. Much, much 
better than he did." 
</P>
<P>
Ready mentally? 
</P>
<P>
"Si'." 
</P>
<P>
"He is happy Sugar will fight him," says Riet. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, Duran looks a bit sad. Does he want a fast car or a chocolate 
cream pie? 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard still clips his nails. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to get this over with," says Duran. Riet says Duran means the 
fight, not the interview. 
</P>
<P>
"This fight," says Duran, "I'm in tremendous condition." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't in condition for Hearns. He admits it. Hearns knocked out Duran in 
the second round in 1984. That punch was so devastating that it alone qualified 
Hearns to be called "The Hit Man." 
</P>
<P>
That seemed like the end for Duran. But then so had a loss to Leonard and a 
loss to Wilfred Benitez and, surely, a loss to Kirkland Laing, a welterweight 
of so little distinction that he was thrashed by one Fred Hutchings. 
</P>
<P>
Duran admits it: He was not in shape for Laing. 
</P>
<P>
Duran lost to Marvelous Marvin Hagler too, but that was close; as recently as 
1986 he lost to Robbie Sims, Hagler's half-brother, and that was yet another 
reason to retire. He was 72-1 and scored the only victory over Leonard before 
he quit against Leonard. His record from late 1980 through 1986 was 7-6. Then 
he beat guys named Victor, Juan, Ricky, Paul and Jeff. He went home to Miami 
and turned his melancholy to fire once more, training for a victorious return 
against Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
So now Duran, who can claim to have been the fighter of the '70s, is still 
around to put his mark on the '80s -- if he can land a telling right hand to 
some part of Leonard's anatomy. Duran hasn't been choosy since he knocked down 
the horse for two bottles of liquor and $10. "I'm praying to God the judges be 
equal and as fair as anything possible," he says, in case the fight goes the 12 
rounds. But he knows Leonard gets the close calls -- the win over Hagler, the 
gift draw with Hearns. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to win big," says Riet of Duran. 
</P>
<P>
"I will look for the knockout," says Duran. 
</P>
<P>
But what if Leonard acts like he did in 1980, tries to make a fool of him? 
Duran probably wasn't in shape then, but he won't admit that. He shakes his 
head. He won't talk about "no mas" except to say, "This is the real one." 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a glorious fight," he says. "I'm going to be happy, very 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
To the wish that he is "very happy," Duran replies with a tranquil, "Thank you, 
Mister."

HEISMAN RACE: WHAT SHOULD COUNT MOST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON MARKUS, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe the design of the Heisman Trophy should be forever altered. Instead of 
the now-famous, 25-pound, 13 1/2-inch, bronze statue of an old-time football 
hero, perhaps the award should be a glass-encased fax sheet with the winner's 
game-by-game statistics. 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of many, that is what college football's most prestigious 
individual prize has become. What is supposed to go to the best collegiate 
player in the country recently has gone, nearly without exception, to the guy 
who has put up the best offensive numbers. 
</P>
<P>
This year's race, which is still almost as wide-open as when the season began, 
has stirred an inordinate amount of debate. The merits of a player's stats vs. 
his worth to the team will be argued until, and possibly after, the voting is 
announced Dec. 2 at New York's Downtown Athletic Club. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the single-most controversial statement regarding the 1989 Heisman 
race was made this week by Syracuse Coach Dick MacPherson. 
</P>
<P>
Known for his bluntness in a profession filled with cliche-mongers, this time 
MacPherson went mouth first with both feet. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Indiana tailback Anthony Thompson's record-setting 377-yard rushing 
performance last week, MacPherson scoffed. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, he should be banned from the Heisman," MacPherson said. "That's a joke. 
To do that against Michigan, then you win the Heisman. Don't do it against 
Wisconsin and try to impress me." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who leads the nation's Division I-A players in rushing yardage per 
game (168.2) and points per game (16.4), is considered one of a handful of 
legitimate late-season candidates for the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
Others thought to be among the leading contenders, for various reasons, are 
three quarterbacks: Houston's Andre Ware (stats), West Virginia's Major Harris 
(one-man offense) and Notre Dame's Tony Rice (see eight other Fighting Irish 
winners). 
</P>
<P>
Asked this week if he thought he would win the Heisman, Harris said, "Not a 
chance. This is really a two-man race between that running back at Indiana and 
that quarterback at Houston. I'm not in in the race." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rice: "I'm not thinking about that. What I want is another (national 
championship) ring." 
</P>
<P>
From a strictly statistical standpoint, Ware and Thompson have moved to center 
stage. Ware has set nine National Collegiate Athletic Association records and, 
with 40 touchdown passes, is eight shy of breaking Jim McMahon's all-time, 
one-season mark. Thompson, who broke Rueben Mayes' record of 357 yards in a 
game, is also the National Collegiate Athletic Association's all-time touchdown 
leader (60). 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can ignore the numbers," Houston Coach Jack Pardee said of 
Ware. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some factors going against Ware and Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Houston is on probation and not on television, and Ware would be the first 
player in that type of situation to win the award. (Barry Sanders won it last 
year with very little television exposure, after which Oklahoma State went on 
probation.) 
</P>
<P>
Indiana is 5-4, and, against the top two rushing defenses in the Big Ten, 
Michigan and Michigan State, Thompson was held to 172 yards on 58 carries. His 
longest run from scrimmage this year is 35 yards, making him not the kind of 
game-buster you expect to see win the Heisman. 
</P>
<P>
In defending the way he used Thompson last week, during a 38-17 victory over 
Wisconsin, Indiana Coach Bill Mallory said, "You can't ask a kid to put more 
into his football. He trains and conditions himself to do that. You've got some 
guys who carry 52 times and you have to give them mouth-to-mouth." 
</P>
<P>
While Thompson and Ware continue their onslaught against the record books, 
Harris might have resuscitated his chances with back-to-back games of 300 yards 
or more total offense against Penn State and Rutgers. There is certainly some 
sentiment -- albeit from the East -- for Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Consider that Harris was the leading returning Heisman vote-getter from last 
year after the top four, including Sanders, went to the National Football 
League. Consider, too, that West Virginia lost its entire offensive line from 
last season, as well as two of its top receivers. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a vote for the Heisman, I'd go with Major because of the job he's 
done," MacPherson said of the player who has led the Mountaineers to a 7-2-1 
record, and could finish with more than 2,000 yards passing and close to 1,000 
yards rushing. "He has clearly done something special." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Luicci of The (Newark, N.J.) Star-Ledger, who does have a vote, will cast 
his for Harris. He said statistics alone shouldn't determine the Heisman. "If 
it was just stats, let the NCAA hand it out," said Luicci. "But it's not." 
</P>
<P>
One factor that always seems to rule out candidates is age. Call it the 
wait-till-next year syndrome. It might affect Ware, a junior, and certainly 
will put Colorado quarterback Darian Hagan and Notre Dame 
flanker-tailback-kick-returner Raghib Ismail, both sophomores, back in the 
pack. But their stats deserve some attention. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics are one reason that Rice won't win. Though he has made big plays in 
big games, he has had too many days when he was 1-for-7 passing and had 55 
yards rushing. The party line in South Bend, Ind., is that opposing defenses 
are geared to stop Rice, but the same is true for most of the other top 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the emergence of Ismail, as well as the abundance of tailbacks at 
Notre Dame, should give Rice more of an opportunity to stand out. Conversely, 
Thompson, Emmitt Smith of Florida and Penn State's Blair Thomas play on teams 
with virtually no passing game. 
</P>
<P>
But Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz, who still won't vote his team No. 1 in the 
country, said this week that he would pick Rice if he had a say in the Heisman. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't trade Tony Rice for any player in the country -- bar none," Holtz 
said. "I don't know another quarterback to do the things that Tony Rice has 
done. The main thing with Tony Rice is that he's a complete quarterback, a 
leader, a winner. He makes the throws when he has to. I don't know if anybody 
can get the statistics for us the way we do things." 
</P>
<P>
When Tim Brown won the Heisman as a Notre Dame senior in 1987, he didn't have 
the kind of statistics as during his junior year. Nor did he match up in a 
numbers game with Syracuse quarterback Don McPherson. It didn't matter that the 
Fighting Irish lost their last three games after an 8-1 start, or that Syracuse 
finished 11-0-1 and nearly won the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Momentum from his junior year, and an early-season game against Michigan State 
-- in which he ran back two successive punts for touchdowns -- gave Brown an 
insurmountable lead on the field. Even Dick MacPherson was not disturbed by 
Brown's getting the award. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Tim Brown did some things to excite a lot of people," said MacPherson. 
"For a guy like Donnie McPherson to come out of nowhere like he did (in the 
Heisman voting) really helped him. I was very happy for Tim Brown. What we 
really have to understand is that a deserving young man is usually going to get 
the award." 
</P>
<P>
Deserving, perhaps. But not always the best college football player in the 
country.

UNLV AND LSU MAKE POWERFUL MOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY COTTON, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There should always be a place for Cinderella at a ball -- except perhaps 
during the upcoming college basketball season. Instead of a fairy-tale affair 
that could elevate a rosy cheeked assistant coach like Michigan's Steve Fisher 
to a national title, this year's party resembles a brawl, with only the team 
with the most muscle likely to be left standing. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Vernel Singleton started at center for LSU. This season he may play 
in the backcourt, as the Tigers brandish two highly touted 7-footers: Shaquille 
O'Neal and Stanley Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
LSU isn't the only team resorting to the power game. The Georgetown Hoyas, ever 
the bullies, seem even more intimidating with 7-2 Dikembe Mutombo joining 
defensive force Alonzo Mourning in the starting lineup. Others suggest the ploy 
by Coach John Thompson is only being made to counter a Syracuse team that could 
feature the best front wall in the country -- Derrick Coleman, Billy Owens and 
LeRon Ellis, a transfer from Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV supposedly had the best junior-college transfers in the country last 
season, David Butler and Moses Scurry. So what do the Running Rebels do this 
time around? Add do-everything forward Larry Johnson from Odessa (Texas) junior 
college, a move that has sprung the team to the top of the pre-season polls. 
</P>
<P>
LSU is right behind -- at least pending the outcome of its likely meeting with 
UNLV this week in the Big Apple NIT finals. That is just one of a number of 
high-profile early-season matchups; others include Georgetown against North 
Carolina and Duke versus Syracuse in Big East-Atlantic Coast Conference 
challenges, after which Duke keeps busy with Michigan in Ann Arbor and the 
Rainbow Classic in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Duke has been in the Final Four three of the last four seasons -- which 
coincides with the career of forward Danny Ferry. Coach Mike Krzyzewski's squad 
doesn't figure to be as good without him and could stumble early with the tough 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
According to Thompson, a team "can get up for games just so many times," one 
reason why he's against the early-season showdowns. Such games, and the fact 
that many teams -- like Georgetown -- use November and December to prepare for 
March and April, are why the rankings likely will undergo weekly revisions. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't give a lot of credence to the pre-season polls," Thompson said. "I 
guess they're good for fans and alumni and the student body, but there's no way 
that you know what kind of team anyone has right now. The only way you can tell 
is to go through thq fire. ... I tend to get nervous when you come out of the 
blocks fast because sustaining it will be difficult. I'd rather take my time." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, television -- and the revenues produced by such matchups -- are at 
the root of the glamour contests, which rankles Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
"We preach education and vote money," Thompson said. "We need to accept the 
reality of that ... why don't we just (admit) that and go for it -- just go for 
the money." 
</P>
<P>
Michigan, Seton Hall, Duke and Illinois all made more than $1 million from 
advancing to the Final Four last season. With such rewards, there's pressure 
aplenty on programs, which is one reason why the Southeastern Conference 
dominated the news in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
There are three new coaches in the SEC this year. Rick Pitino left the New York 
Knicks of the NBA to join a Kentucky program that's beginning the start of a 
three-year NCAA probation. 
</P>
<P>
At Tennessee, Don DeVoe was cashiered despite a respected career with the Vols, 
including a berth in last year's NCAA tournament. The coach did manage to land 
on his feet -- in a fashion. He takes over on an interim basis at Florida, 
where Norm Sloan resigned on Oct. 31 amid the threat of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
The man who replaced DeVoe at Tennessee, Wade Houston, discovered immediately 
that life won't be easy in the SEC. Shortly after joining the Vols, Houston -- 
the first black coach in the conference -- was turned away from an exclusive 
country club to which membership for the school's coaches had prev)n sly been a 
formality. 
</P>
<P>
On the court, all three men will have to figure out a way to stop Dale Brown 
and LSU, which happens to have the most outstanding guard in the nation, Chris 
Jackson. Jackson averaged 30.2 points a game as a freshman last season; some 
claim Kenny Anderson, a freshman from New York City, will do the same for 
Georgia Tech this year. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow Jackets swingman Dennis Scott says he feels sorry for Anderson because 
of all the attention, then proceeds to comment that the freshman's ability to 
run the floor is "unbelievable. When he has the ball, if you keep running he'll 
find you." 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Cremins said he knew such hyperbole "would be a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
"People are expecting a lot," he said. "I remember I saw him in the McDonald's 
all-star game in Landover (at Capital Centre in suburban Maryland) last spring. 
I thought he threw some good passes, had a good game but the people there were 
disappointed. That's the sort of thing he's going to have to deal with 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
The same advice could apply to Arizona center Brian Williams. The transfer from 
Maryland is expected to keep the Wildcats among the nation's elite despite the 
loss of first-round draft picks Sean Elliott and Anthony Cook. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the coaches beginning new jobs before audiences that have been 
anxiously awaiting their arrival. Into that category falls Gary Williams, 
returning to his alma mater, Maryland and Bill Frieder, who left Michigan for 
Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
His replacement was Fisher, who won six games, the last an 80-79 overtime 
decision in the Seattle Kingdome against Seton Hall for the championship, then 
had the interim tag removed by Athletic Director Bo Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Fisher focuses on retaining the crown. There hasn't been a repeat NCAA 
champion since the UCLA teams of 1971-72 and '72-73. Although the Wolverines 
still have the irrepressible Rumeal Robinson, they will be hurt by the loss of 
Glen Rice to the pros. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Michigan will be hard pressed to hold off Illinois, which it beat by 
two points in Seattle last March. If there is indeed a trend toward the power 
game, teams like the Illini, a whippet-like group of athletes in the 6-4 to 6-8 
range, will provide the counterpoint.

MORNING BRIEFING: MORE THAN A YEAR LATER, HE REVEALS SOUL OF SEOUL GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The Los Angeles screening for Bud Greenspan's "Seoul '88: 16 Days of Glory" was 
held last week and attended by a number of Olympic greats. After the screening 
for the Nov. 29 Disney Channel premiere ended, filmmaker Greenspan asked a 
number of those in attendance to say a few words. Some samples: 
</P>
<P>
Greg Louganis, gold medalist diver: "The truth about Seoul is that, when I hit 
my head on the board, I lost all confidence in everything. I thought I'd gone 
to the other side of the world to make nine dives and go home a failure. If my 
coach, Ron O'Brien, hadn't been there to get me through, I never would have 
made it." 
</P>
<P>
(Louganis won gold medals in the platform and springboard events). 
</P>
<P>
John Naber, former gold medalist swimmer: "I worked for TV in Seoul, and I was 
right there, on the cutting edge, where everything was happening. But as 
always, the real stories eventually percolate out, away from everybody else, 
away from all the cameras. Except Bud's." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Spitz, former gold medalist swimmer, who will be attempting a comeback in 
Barcelona in 1992: "Bud had a lot to do with this comeback thing. I saw him at 
a party and I pulled him aside and I said, 'Bud, I know this sounds crazy, but 
I think I want to try a comeback in '92.' And Bud said, 'Good, 'cause I need 
something for my next film.' " 
</P>
<P>
And Sammy Lee, diving gold medalist and former coach of Louganis, who is 
featured prominently in the Louganis portion of the film and is captured by 
Greenspan's cameras singing the national anthem -- badly: "Now that all of you 
have seen this and heard me, I invite you, if you want to add some grief to 
your funeral, have me come and sing." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: The Indiana and Purdue football teams play for the Old Oaken 
Bucket. Which teams play for the Old Brass Spittoon? 
</P>
<P>
Crowd favorite: Bruce Berlet of the Hartford Courant on Michael Chang's 1-6, 
6-3, 6-4 victory over Jimmy Connors in the Aetna tennis tournament at the 
Hartford Civic Center Thursday night: "In a 2-hour, 2-minute match of mostly 
serious tennis, Chang rallied for his second victory in as many exhibitions 
with Connors. Chang won, 6-3, 7-6, in Chicago in February. 
</P>
<P>
"The one really light moment came when a spectator yelled 'Come on, McEnroe' 
with Chang serving the eighth game of the third set. Chang fired a ball toward 
the fan, then both players impersonated John McEnroe's mannerisms as the crowd 
roared." 
</P>
<P>
Deadline pressure: Mike Terry of the San Bernardino Sun was among reporters 
waiting to interview Clipper Coach Don Casey after a game against the Denver 
Nuggets at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters stood by impatiently as a well-dressed man walked up to Casey and 
congratulated him at length on the Clippers' come-from-behind victory. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Terry shouted, "Enough, I'm on deadline!" 
</P>
<P>
The man apologized and moved to one side. After reporters finished interviewing 
Casey, Terry asked the coach who the well-dressed fan was. 
</P>
<P>
Said Casey: "Oh, that was just Donald Sterling, the owner." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Indiana and Michigan State.

IT'S UGLY, BUT KINGS BEAT CAPITALS; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: FIGHT IN FINAL SECONDS MARS 5-3 VICTORY THAT EXTENDS THEIR UNBEATEN 
STRING TO FOUR GAMES AND EVENS THEIR RECORD AT 10-10-1.

Steve Kasper scored on Washington's empty net with 32 seconds left to wrap up 
the scoring in the Kings' 5-3 victory at the Forum Saturday night, but the game 
wasn't over. 
</P>
<P>
There was still time for one last scuffle. The last in a long series. 
</P>
<P>
As far as Marty McSorley was concerned -- and many in the sellout crowd of 
16,005 agreed with him -- he would have been remiss to let Neil Sheehy leave 
the ice without paying for the way he had treated Wayne Gretzky, Bernie 
Nicholls, Luc Robitaille and the rest of the Kings throughout the evening. 
</P>
<P>
So McSorley cross-checked Sheehy from behind, knocking him to the ice. And 
while Sheehy was face down on the ice, McSorley reached down and punched him. 
</P>
<P>
It was not a pretty sight. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of things happen on the ice that don't look good," McSorley said. "A lot 
of things happen on the ice that aren't felt in the stands, that aren't felt in 
the pressbox, but are felt by all the players. . . 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted our guys to know that after all the little things they took all 
night, I'm there for them. It is not open season on Wayne Gretzky and Bernie 
Nicholls. . . 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I knocked (Sheehy) down, but he knew I was there. He turned away. I had 
confronted him, and he turned away. So I knocked him down. And then I drilled 
him -- no, I didn't drill him, I hit him. Nobody rushed him off to the 
hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Sheehy, who is 6-feet-2 and 210 pounds, had been giving the Kings' stars 
trouble. And McSorley, who is 6-1, 230, takes that rather personally. 
Especially when Gretzky is involved, and Gretzky had picked up his only 
roughing penalty of the season trying to answer Sheehy's roughness on his own 
in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
As for whether McSorley had attacked Sheehy? McSorley said: "That wasn't an 
attack. He was involved in a scuffle. He just wasn't as involved as I was." 
</P>
<P>
Even the coaches were involved in the confrontations that turned the game into 
a marathon of mini-bouts. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, the Kings survived. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' record went to 10-10-1 as they remained undefeated in four straight 
to take over sole possession of second place in the Smythe Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals dropped to 6-10-4. 
</P>
<P>
It was a game played in spurts and spats. A little game action, a little 
jostling, a little jawing. And then, somehow, the Washington net would get 
knocked off its mooring, stopping play and sparking more debate. 
</P>
<P>
The clock stopped for a couple of minutes toward the end of the third period 
while King Coach Tom Webster and Washington Coach Bryan Murray shouted and 
pointed at each other and acted as if they might climb the plexiglass between 
the benches to get at each other. 
</P>
<P>
No, it wasn't the Kings' usual style, but it was interesting. 
</P>
<P>
Readers of the Washington Post would have expected to see the "chippy" style 
that the Capitals play, the style that leads to short fuses, after seeing the 
comments that Murray made after practice at Culver City earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not encouraging (my team) to go out instigating fights," Murray said. "I'm 
encouraging them to play a physical, solid type of hockey. So when teams play 
against us and go in to get the puck, they know they'll pay a price. So if they 
beat a defenseman and get between him and the boards, they know they're going 
to get hit. That goes a long way toward playing well and getting the overall 
play to a good level." 
</P>
<P>
Murray and Webster were not discussing styles of play when their war of words 
erupted. Said Murray: "Dave Taylor was gonna flip his mask down and I said to 
him, if you're going to go after people, take your mask off. Don't be pouncing 
on guys from the back while you wear a shield to protect yourself. And then 
Webster made a comment to me. That's all." 
</P>
<P>
Webster shrugged it off as "Nothing big. The kind of thing that happens in the 
heat of battle." 
</P>
<P>
No, it was not the Kings' kind of game, but, still, Gretzky was able to get two 
assists, helping on the two power play goals that gave the Kings their 2-2 tie 
after two periods. 
</P>
<P>
A goal by Kelly Miller on the Capitals' first shot, 7:24 into the game, gave 
Washington the early lead. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Nicholls tied it at 9:20 with a slapshot from the top of the left circle 
on the Kings' first power play. Robitaille gave the Kings a 2-1 lead early in 
the second period with his first goal of the night, scored on a wide-open net 
after Washington goalie Don Beaupre left the crease to chase a shot by John 
Tonelli that Tonelli gathered up and sent out front to Robitialle. 
</P>
<P>
Ciccarelli tied it before the second period was out. Geoff Courtnall had 
flipped the puck toward the Kings' net, pulling goaltender Kelly Hrudey out to 
his right. Ciccarelli got to the puck in time to take advantage of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings scored two quick goals at the start of the third period -- Dave 
Taylor passing to Robitaille and getting it back for the score at 1:14 and 
Robitaille scoring at 6:16 on a pass from McSorley as he and McSorley and 
Nicholls all rushed into the Washington zone -- but that was not a safe lead. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Christian's goal at 7:39 kept Washington in the game. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Kings will play at home Wednesday against the Chicago Blackhawks. In fact, 
the Kings will play their next six of seven at home. . . When Dave Taylor 
scored in the third period Saturday night, it was his first goal in 15 games. 
That is the longest stretch without a goal of Taylor's career. . . Going into 
Saturday night's games, Wayne Gretzky led the National Hockey League in scoring 
with 40 points (including 30 assists, which is also best). Mario Lemieux of 
Pittsburgh had 34 points. . .. The annual Skate with the Kings outing is today 
from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at the Culver City rink. Tickets are $8 for King 
booster club members, $10 for non-members.

CHARGERS: A SCORE OR TWO MAY DO IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

PITTSBURGH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once upon a time they used to advertise football games featuring a great 
offense against a great defense as "the irresistible force vs. the immovable 
object." 
</P>
<P>
When a lousy offense faced a lousy defense, the wags would turn it upside down 
and bill it as "the resistible force vs. the movable object." 
</P>
<P>
Today's game between the Steelers and the Chargers at Three Rivers Stadium is 
"the resistible force vs. the even-more resistible force." 
</P>
<P>
The Charger offense has gained fewer yards than any team in the NFL this 
yearexcept Pittsburgh, a team that has also scored the league's fewest points. 
The Charger offense has scored seven touchdowns in its past six games. The 
Steeler offense has produced one touchdown in the past nine quarters. 
</P>
<P>
This is a game between two 4-6 teams that appear to be going nowhere. The 
Steelers appear to be getting there faster. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the four shutouts in the NFL's 140 games this year have been at the 
expense of the Steeler offense. Last week, Chicago beat the Steelers, 20-0, 
taking the ball away six times, and prompting Steve Hubbard of the Pittsburgh 
Press to write: "The only object on earth whitewashed more often than the 
Steelers' offense is the graffiti on New York's subways." 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish I could play, 'I Dream of Jeannie' and flip all this stuff out of 
the way," said Tim Worley, Pittsburgh's rookie running back. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, everything's going backward," said Steeler defensive back Rod 
Woodson. "Everything's going the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
And it doesn't figure to turn around for the Pittsburgh offense against the 
Chargers, whose defense has allowed the fewest points in the league the past 
eight weeks (111). That's fewer than 14 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have won two consecutive games -- upset victories over 
Philadelphia and the Raiders. But Coach Dan Henning admitted last Monday it's 
more important for his offense not to "screw it up" for the defense than it is 
to score touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a bumpy road," says Charger guard David Richards. "You can win more 
games playing great defense than great offense. But we need to carry our share 
of the load." 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, Charger linebacker Gary Plummer, the team's leading tackler, 
told quarterback Jim McMahon that "all we need is 20 points a week." 
</P>
<P>
If the Chargers had scored just 20 points in each of their 10 games this year, 
their record would be 7-2-1 and they would be in first place in the AFC West 
(one of those victories would have been against Denver, which would have 
dropped the 8-2 Broncos to 7-3). 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, the last time the Chargers played in Three Rivers Stadium it was 
"the movable object vs. the even-more movable object." 
</P>
<P>
The two teams combined for 867 yards of offense. But the Chargers turned the 
ball over five times, quarterback Dan Fouts left the game early, and they lost, 
52-24. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh's quarterback that day was Mark Malone, who completed 18 of 22 
passes for 253 yards and four touchdowns. Malone wound up being traded to the 
Chargers before the 1988 season, and he failed miserably as Fouts' successor. 
Now the Chargers find themselves with McMahon, who has the birth certificate of 
a 30-year-old, the body of a 50-year-old and the sense of humor of a 
three-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of youth, Charger rookie Burt Grossman bruised the egos of several 
Steelers this week when he alternately ripped Worley, former Pitt teammates Tom 
Ricketts and Jerry Olsavsky and the Steeler personnel department. 
</P>
<P>
Those remarks, his own team's inconsistency on offense and the fact that two of 
Pittsburgh's four victories have come against Super Bowl contenders -- 
Cleveland and Minnesota -- have Henning worried. 
</P>
<P>
Henning is a good worrier. He got a lot of practice in Atlanta while coaching 
four seasons for the Rankin Smith family. The Smiths own the hapless Falcons 
and are referred to in impolite Atlanta society as "The Clampetts," a 
comparison that reflects poorly on Uncle Jed, Granny, Jethro and Elly May of 
the "Beverly Hillbillies." 
</P>
<P>
Henning is also worried about the artificial turf at Three Rivers Stadium. He 
says it is "old and slick." It is only the second game off natural grass for 
the Chargers this year. 
</P>
<P>
This is also the first of four road games in five weeks for the Chargers, a 
team that is 3-3 at home and 1-3 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman aside, the Chargers would like to enter quietly, win easily and sneak 
out of town before the winter arrives or the artificial turf gets any slicker. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the Steelers) will definitely use what Burt said to motivate their 
players and fans," Richards says. "It's difficult enough to play in that 
stadium. My motto is: Praise 'em, play 'em, and praise 'em after you play 'em." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Running back Tim Worley, the Steelers' No. 1 draft choice, is the team's 
second-leading rusher with 300 yards on 91 carries. He is unhappy he isn't 
getting the ball more. "I've never known a back worth his salt who didn't want 
the ball more," says Charger Coach Dan Henning. . . . Charger cornerback Gill 
Byrd is tied for the AFC lead with five interceptions. Defensive end Leslie 
O'Neal leads the conference in sacks with 10.5. . . . The Chargers have 
outscored opponents, 67-46, in the fourth quarter this year. Opponents have 
outscored them, 59-13, in the second quarter. . . . The Steelers have been held 
under 100 yards rushing seven times in 10 games.

RAMS TRY TO BEAT BEAT-UP CARDINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One local football team stopped counting its bruises and started on its 
blessings this week after swapping injury reports with the Phoenix Cardinals, 
whose recent medical printouts stack up nicely next to the Congressional 
Record. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams sincerely apologize for this week's meager offering: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Quarterback Jim Everett. His back is sore, but he will start. This week, 
Everett had chiropractors cracking (the same guy who works on Vice President 
Dan Quayle's back), trainers training and whirlpools whirling. Note: Everett 
completed 18 consecutive passes with the same back last week. Suggestion: Take 
two safeties deep and call us in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix report, and stand back, please: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Quarterbacks. Had one once. Name was Neil Lomax, and last year he diced up 
the Rams for 517 total yards in a 41-27 victory. Lomax and his arthritic hip 
haven't been seen since early training camp. That was 18 serious injuries to 
Cardinal starters ago. Today, Phoenix Coach Gene Stallings mulls over retread 
quarterback Gary Hogeboom and last week's savior, Tom Tupa, although the 
coach's heart isn't in it. This isn't exactly Montana vs. Young. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make that much difference," is how Stallings put it. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Will the Cardinals field a team against the Rams today? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Yes, if that well-placed classified advertisement works out. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Cardinals made it through last week's 24-20 win over Dallas 
without calling once for the stretcher, no small victory. Two weeks ago, the 
Cardinals lost eight players in a home loss to the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
The list of injured Cardinals starts with C for defensive tackle Bob Clasby 
(knee surgery) and extends to Y for safety Lonnie Young (shoulder -- missed 
weeks 2 through 7). 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix has played at times this year without any of the skill players 
projected to be starters in training camp: quarterback Lomax and/or Hogeboom 
(week 6, elbow), running backs Earl Ferrell (week 2, ankle) and Stump Mitchell 
(season-ending knee surgery) and receivers J.T. Smith (week 10, ankle) and Roy 
Green (weeks 6 through 9, collarbone). 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not the same offense at all as what we had," Stallings said. "And 
every defensive linemen we've got has been hurt, every one of them." 
</P>
<P>
Stallings has never seen anything like it. He has searched long and hard for 
answers but found none that satisfy him. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost 19 players for four weeks or more," he said. "That's a lot of guys. 
Several of them had broken bones -- you can't do anything about that. I'd say 
the majority have been knees. I've tried to research it, talk about it. We've 
discussed it. It seems like they've just been sort of freakish things." 
</P>
<P>
How does a Cardinal fly with clipped wings? Amazingly, it can. Phoenix wobbles 
into Anaheim Stadium at 5-5, only one game worse off than the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are a good football team that has had a lot of injury problems 
that have staggered them," Ram Coach John Robinson said. "But they're 5-5, and 
you have to admire them for that. I don't know that they've beaten anybody 
great or anything, but they managed to get to 5-5. It sounds like the guy is 
taking some heat, but he's a good coach." 
</P>
<P>
Stallings is drawing fire from management, despite garnering overwhelming fan 
support in recent public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
Stallings will make the decision more difficult should he win coach-of-the-year 
honors, and he will get some votes. A tough Texan who played for Bear Bryant 
and for years coached side by side with Tom Landry, Stallings draws from his 
football roots to pull him through the latest crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole football background has been with good people," Stallings said. "When 
I was in high school, I played for Coach Berry, Raymond Berry's daddy. When I 
was at Texas A&amp;M, I was playing for Coach Bryant, then I was on his staff, 
and then with Coach Landry at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been around people where quitting, or giving up, was never an option. 
That was never an option for me when I was playing. I've got a lot of faith. 
But it's been a tough year, no question about that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback LeRoy Irvin's bruised foot is considerably better, but he's talking 
as if the Rams are phasing him out in favor of Clifford Hicks. Irvin said the 
coaches offered no clues as to how much playing time, if any, he will get 
today. "When I first came into the league I was a wild stallion," the 10-year 
veteran said. "I wouldn't let no one ride me. I'd buck everybody. Now they got 
me tied to the post." 
</P>
<P>
For what it's worth, Phoenix hasn't beaten a team with a winning record, having 
defeated Dallas twice, Detroit, Seattle and Atlanta. . . . Another offering 
from Coach John Robinson's reporter's notebook: The Rams have played the three 
top teams in the NFC this year -- San Francisco, Minnesota and the New York 
Giants -- and allowed only one touchdown in 12 quarters.

NBA ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
BIRD, CELTICS NO MATCH FOR PISTONS, 103-86 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The return of Larry Bird has made the Boston Celtics a much improved team. They 
appear almost ready to challenge the top teams in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
One thing the 6-9 forward has not been able to do yet is make the Celtics the 
outstanding road club they once were. Four years ago, they were the best road 
team in the NBA. Last season, with Bird missing all but six games, the Celtics 
were 10-31 away from Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Although the year away because of surgery on both feet has not affected Bird's 
skills, the Celtics still can't win on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rodman came off the bench to spark a third-quarter rally Saturday night 
at Auburn Hills, Mich., that enabled the Detroit Pistons to beat the Celtics, 
103-86. It was the 25th consecutive homecourt victory for the NBA champions and 
the fourth loss in five road games for the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons built a 54-39 halftime lead, but Bird, who finished with 22 points, 
led a Boston surge that cut the lead to 67-62. Then came Rodman. He scored five 
consecutive points and the Celtics never made it close again. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jimmy Rodgers prepared the Celtics for this one by using his regulars 
sparingly Friday night against Minnesota. The strategy worked. They didn't get 
tired, they were simply outmanned. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Dumars, who was 10 for 14 from the field, led the Pistons, winners of three 
in a row after a rough time on the road, with 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
It was just a week ago that the Pistons lost to the Miami Heat. They seem to 
have straightened out at home. Friday night they trounced Milwaukee, 106-79. 
</P>
<P>
"Beating teams that good by those scores indicates we're back," Coach Chuck 
Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 110, New Jersey 95 -- One game of coming off the bench was all 
rookie David Robinson wanted. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-1 former Navy star returned to the starting lineup at East Rutherford, 
N.J. He scored 23 points and had 15 rebounds to lead the Spurs to their fourth 
win in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs broke it open when Frank Brickowski scored six points in a 17-0 rally 
that extended a slim lead to 19 points in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando 116, Philadelphia 103 -- Rick Mahorn and Charles Barkley were thrown 
out of the game as the Magic, led by Reggie Theus and Sam Vincent, ended a 
five-game losing streak in this game at Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
Mahorn was ejected on technicals with 9:50 left and the outcome in doubt. But 
Barkley didn't pick up his second technical until the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost to two expansion teams," Barkley said. "Obviously, we're better 
than they are." 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 112, Golden State 96 -- The Celtics aren't the only team with road 
troubles. The Warriors lost all four games on their trip East that ended in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Dominique Wilkins had 29 points for the Hawks and Cliff Levingston, filling in 
for injured center Moses Malone, added 21. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 100, Miami 99 -- Losing to the Heat in Miami is bad enough, but losing 
to the second-year Heat at home would be embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks avoided the problem when Rolando Blackman made a 16-foot jumper 
with 13 seconds left. With one second left, Miami's Glen Rice missed a 
15-footer. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 119, Chicago 110 -- Xavier McDaniel scored 16 points in the last 
quarter at Seattle to help the SuperSonics overcome a seven-point deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls, playing their third game on a seven-game Western swing, seemed to 
tire in the stretch. Michael Jordan had 32 points, 15 in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
New York 111, Minnesota 96 -- The Knicks have come to expect at least 20 points 
from Patrick Ewing and 11 rebounds from Charles Oakley. They've done that well 
in every game. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing scored 26 points and Oakley had 13 rebounds at New York in a surprisingly 
tough win over the expansion team. Tony Campbell and Sam Mitchell each scored 
29 points for the Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 141, Houston 111 -- Alex English came out of a season-long slump at 
Denver, scoring 24 points in 25 minutes to lead the Nuggets' rout of the 
Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
English was 11 for 15 from the field and the Nuggets, after building a 72-54 
halftime lead, eased to the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 118, Washington 107 -- The Bullets know all about the troubles on the 
road. When Armon Gilliam scored 12 points in the last 10 minutes at Phoenix to 
spark the Suns, the Bullets lost their fourth in a row away from home. 
</P>
<P>
The score was tied 23 times before Eddie Johnson sank a jumper with 10:29 left 
to put the Suns ahead, 90-89. Gilliam's spree finished the Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix playmaker Kevin Johnson injured his left hamstring early in the game 
and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento 107, Indiana 102 -- Rodney McCray scored seven of his 25 points in 
the last 83 seconds at Sacramento to lift the Kings to victory. DAN HAFNER

SMITH PLUS SMITH EQUAL BAD NEWS FOR UPSHAW

<P>
As the days and games continue, there is less and less doubt as to what the 
Celtics will do when Michael Smith is deemed fit to play. 
</P>
<P>
Against big odds, Charles Smith has survived. And Kelvin Upshaw, who provided 
more than a few bright moments last season, has not. 
</P>
<P>
Both players are safe now. Michael Smith practiced Thursday, but the No. 1 
draft pick is not ready to return. Said Coach Jimmy Rodgers, "It is getting 
close. We're trying to identify where he is and go from there." 
</P>
<P>
Barring an injury or unforeseen development, Upshaw is the odd man out. Even 
though his $150,000 contract is guaranteed, and Charles Smith's $110,000 
minimum deal is not, to reach any other conclusion would be silly. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is getting playing time. Upshaw is not. Smith is making the most of his 
time on the floor. Upshaw cannot. Even the always cautious Jan Volk, the team's 
general manager, didn't try to deny the obvious. Asked if the disparity in 
playing time was a sign Charles Smith had made the team, Volk said, "I'll let 
that speak for itself." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Smith further heightened his already solid chances by his play 
Wednesday. Twenty-five seconds after entering the game in the second quarter, 
he stripped the Nets' Mookie Blaylock and went in for a three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
Smith played 12 minutes and had five assists and three points. Upshaw got his 
first playing time since the opener in the final 2 minutes, 27 seconds. That's 
not particularly meaningful when your team wins by 34 points. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Upshaw has tried to remain optimistic in the face of the 
ongoing inauspicious developments. "I'm being patient," he said. "I feel good 
about what I've done and I haven't lost any confidence. I'm not down and out. 
Any athlete will tell you that not playing is disappointing, but that's all 
part of basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Upshaw joined the Celtics March 9 and who can forget his debut? Against the 
Nuggets, he had eight points (4-for-4) and four assists in 13 minutes. 
Afterwards, a mildly amused Doug Moe, the Denver coach, said Upshaw probably 
wouldn't make another basket in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Upshaw did tail off toward the end of the season and was not much of a factor 
in the playoffs. Then again, who was? Still, he worked on his game all summer 
in his native Chicago, showed up at rookie camp (where he accidentally undercut 
Larry Bird, forcing the fall that broke two bones in Bird's back) and seemed to 
have a spot clinched in the thin Boston backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he's on the cusp again. He'd like to remain where he is, but he also knows 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just waiting for the opportunity," Upshaw said. "I know I can play and I'd 
like to do it here. But things are out of my control so I can't worry about 
them. I don't think about other things, I think about the job I have to do 
here. I can live with whatever decision they make."

WALLACE IN CONTROL OF DESTINY

<P>
The Winston Cup stock car racing championship and its $1-million bonus is Rusty 
Wallace's to win -- or lose. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since NASCAR introduced its points-fund payoff, three 
drivers -- Wallace in a Pontiac, Mark Martin in a Ford and three-time champion 
Dale Earnhardt in a Chevrolet -- go into the final race of the season, today's 
Atlanta Journal 500, with a chance at the championship. But only Wallace can 
control his destiny. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace leads Martin by 78 points and Earnhardt by 79. If the driver from 
Fenton, Mo., finishes 18th or better today he will win his first championship, 
even if Martin or Earnhardt wins everything else. 
</P>
<P>
It sounds simple, but it might not be. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, when he found himself in almost the same position Martin and 
Earnhardt are in today, Wallace bitterly criticized Bill Elliott for not 
running hard and going for the win as well as the championship. Elliott started 
the final race here 79 points ahead of Wallace, finished 11th and won his first 
Winston Cup title by 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
"A man ought to be ashamed of himself, running like that," Wallace, the 
runner-up, said. "I'd never 'stroke' along like he did. I'd run for it like a 
champion ought to." 
</P>
<P>
Now Wallace is on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
Will he run for the lead and maybe take a chance of breaking, as he said he 
would a year ago? Or will be swallow his pride, pull an Elliott and cruise 
along safely toward the $1 million? 
</P>
<P>
Wallace maintains that he knows only one way to run, and that is to go all out 
from the starting flag to the checkered flag. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what got me here, so why should I change now?" he asks questioners. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he has almost apologized for the way he chastised Elliott 
last year. "I probably got carried away and hit him too hard, but it was 
frustrating for me to work so hard and see him cruising along in the middle of 
the pack winning the big prize," Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
He had won the pole, led the most laps and won the race, all in vain. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no speculation on what Mark and Dale will do," Wallace said. "They'll 
try and do exactly what I did last year and hope something happens to me. It's 
simple for them, as far as strategy is concerned. There isn't any, except to go 
flat out all the way. As far as what I do, I won't decide until they drop the 
green flag. The competition will dictate what I do, but I guarantee you, I'll 
drive as hard as I can, like I always do." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, who is not in the hunt today because of a slow start caused when he 
broke an arm while practicing last February in Daytona, had a word of caution 
for Wallace. "If I was Rusty, or if I was running Rusty's team, I'd go in with 
a conservative approach," Elliott said of his fellow redhead. "He criticized me 
pretty good for the way I ran here last year, but the way we looked at it, it 
was only one race in a complete season. The season is a total of 29 races and 
where you finish in every one counts." 
</P>
<P>
There can be pitfalls no matter what course Wallace takes. 
</P>
<P>
Five times this year he has failed to make it to 18th place. He finished 31st 
three times, here at Atlanta in the spring race, at Martinsville on the short 
track and at Charlotte in the Coca-Cola 600. Each time his engine failed. 
</P>
<P>
Failed oil pressure left him 22nd in the Miller 500 at Pocono and he wrecked on 
lap 26 at Talladega and finished 37th. 
</P>
<P>
"Running hard and running up front isn't what breaks engines or cuts tires," 
Wallace said. "I'd feel a lot worse in the middle of the pack, wondering who 
was around me. I like to get out front, where I know the guys. When you're in 
the middle, it can be a hornet's nest. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I'm going to take it easy on the gears and not go scorching out of the 
pits at 200 m.p.h., and I'll watch my step when I'm lapping cars. I'll give 
some of them a wide berth, but it won't be 'stroking.' It'll be being careful." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace might have learned his lesson two weeks ago at Phoenix, when he was 
nearly taken out by Stan Barrett in a situation that was as much carelessness 
on Wallace's part as inexperience on Barrett's. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace had an 18-second lead and seemed on the verge of clinching the 
championship when he passed the Hollywood stunt man between the first and 
second turns. But Wallace, in his haste to get back in the high-speed groove, 
cut in front of Barrett too quickly. When Barrett's brakes faded, his car 
clipped the rear end of Wallace's, sending it into the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Wallace, it didn't put him out of the race but he did lose a 
lot of time in the pits and instead of winning, finished 16th. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him he ought to be more careful than that," said Earnhardt, who is a 
close friend of Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
Earnhardt, who prepared for today's race by hunting last week near Calgary, 
Canada, where he bagged a 250-pound, 11-point white-tailed deer, said it would 
take a mistake on Wallace's part if he or Martin were to have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to wish my buddy any bad luck, but I'm going to watch him close 
and if he's stroking, I'm going to call him stroker. And if he wins the 
championship, I'll call him champion stroker. 
</P>
<P>
"The points can change in a hurry, though. I know. I lost 110 points in a 
single race at Charlotte. That's what put Rusty out in front and let Mark catch 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever happens, if he wins, or I win, or Mark wins, it ain't going to make a 
bit of difference what I'm doing Sunday night. No matter what, I'm heading for 
Alabama to do some deer hunting. I didn't get enough of it up in Canada."

PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the coaches and players of the U.S. national soccer team arrived at Piarco 
Airport here after midnight Friday, "under the cloud of night" as the disc 
jockey on Radio Trinidad said, there were about 3,000 people there to greet 
them. 
</P>
<P>
But only about 40 or 50 were Americans, most of them having arrived on the 
previous flight from San Juan. The staff from the U.S. embassy tried to even 
the odds, giving the Americans small U.S. flags to wave. 
</P>
<P>
Their chants of "USA, USA," however, were easily drowned out by the islanders, 
all of whom were wearing the national color, red. "No Way, USA," they shouted. 
"No Way, USA." 
</P>
<P>
Where did the Americans think they were coming, Grenada? 
</P>
<P>
The United States is here to play today at the National Stadium in arguably the 
most important soccer game of its history, a chance to qualify for the World 
Cup finals for the first time ever. 
</P>
<P>
It has played in three previous World Cups, the most recent in 1950, but all of 
those were by invitation. This would be the first time that it has earned a 
berth among the world's 24 elite teams. 
</P>
<P>
It also is the most important soccer game in the history of Trinidad and 
Tobago, which has never played in the World Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
But that might be an understatement. Some islanders believe it is the most 
important event, sporting or otherwise, since the small Caribbean islands 
gained their independence from Great Britain in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
"Charles DeGaulle said that the islands of the Caribbean are specks of dust," 
said Jack Warner, secretary general of the T&amp;T Football Assn. and a 
lecturer in history at the Polytechnic Institute here. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people in the world think it. He was frank enough to say it. This is 
a chance to fly our flag on the world stage, to put our country on the map." 
</P>
<P>
That stage will be next summer's World Cup in Italy. Two teams from the Central 
and North American and Caribbean region (CONCACAF) qualify. Costa Rica (5-2-1) 
already has earned a berth. With only today's game remaining, the United States 
and Trinidad and Tobago are tied for second at 3-1-3. 
</P>
<P>
T&amp;T needs only a tie because it has a better goal differential in the 
previous seven games. The United States must win to advance. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the region's weakest team, El Salvador, played the United States to 
a scoreless tie two weeks ago in St. Louis, it has been virtually impossible to 
find anyone here who believes T&amp;T is capable of losing. 
</P>
<P>
When that score was announced, T&amp;T was tied, 2-2, in an exhibition game at 
the National Stadium with a team from Lithuania. A roar went up from the 
stands, followed by two quick goals in a 4-2 victory for T&amp;T. That is 
viewed here as an omen. 
</P>
<P>
The entire country has since been in the grips of soccer mania. On Friday, it 
was difficult to find anyone not wearing red. People were dancing in the 
streets until dawn Saturday, creating an atmosphere that usually is reserved 
for February's Carnival. 
</P>
<P>
National Coach Gally Cummings has done nothing to douse the people's 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
"After having seen the Americans, I am convinced that they will be no match for 
us," he said last week. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coach Bob Gansler reacted to that remark Saturday in the same manner that 
he reacts to virtually everything: stoically. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't come here to deliver a win to them," he said. "We could have done 
that by staying home and sending it by mail." 
</P>
<P>
But, objectively, it is difficult to disagree with Cummings' assessment. In the 
previous game in May at Torrance, the teams tied, 1-1, T&amp;T scoring in the 
final two minutes. T&amp;T, however, appears to have improved while the United 
States has, if anything, gone in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of its outstanding goalkeeping and solid defense, the United 
States is not, by design, an offensive machine. In its first five games, it 
scored only five goals. But in the last two games, it has been impotent on 
offense. Both games ended scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
That, naturally, has created some dissension. The defenders are pointing their 
fingers at the forwards, who are blaming the midfielders. 
</P>
<P>
The players had a team meeting at their training camp last week in Cocoa Beach, 
Fla., to clear the air and emerged, they say, as one unit again. 
</P>
<P>
Their midfield could be helped significantly by the return of Hugo Perez, who 
has played only one game this year because of various injuries. In his last 
game, he scored the only goal in a victory over El Salvador at Tegucigalpa, 
Honduras. The United States has been scoreless in 208 minutes since then. 
</P>
<P>
Perez practiced with the team last week, but Gansler would not reveal Saturday 
whether he will play today. 
</P>
<P>
"I am important to the team," Perez said. "I want to play. But it's the coach's 
decision. It's difficult for him because I haven't been with the team for six 
or seven weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Although T&amp;T needs only to tie, it is not expected to play for one. A 
wide-open, attacking team, that is not its style. 
</P>
<P>
Gansler said Saturday that he hopes to take advantage of that aggressiveness by 
playing defensively early, waiting for a T&amp;T mistake and then countering. 
If the game is tied midway through the second half, then he will tell his team 
to attack. 
</P>
<P>
The game begins at 3:30 p.m. local time (11:30 a.m. in Los Angeles), but a 
capacity crowd of about 30,000 is expected to begin arriving at the stadium as 
early as 5 a.m. since the majority of seats are not reserved. A program 
consisting of steel bands, tassa drumming and calypso singers is scheduled to 
begin at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The game will be televised live here and also will be shown on Diamond Vision 
screens at three locations on Trinidad, including the 35,000-seat cricket 
stadium in Port of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Win, lose or draw, the government has declared Monday a national holiday. Win, 
lose or draw, few would have been able to go to work Monday, anyway. A major 
concern on the islands Saturday was that the bars would run out of beer before 
the end of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The game has attracted media attention from several countries besides the 
United States and Trinidad and Tobago. Veteran soccer reporters from Europe 
said they have never seen a entire country so mobilized behind its national 
soccer team as this one. 
</P>
<P>
There has been some criticism from within the country because the display at 
times has taken on militaristic overtones. The most popular chant among 
schoolchildren has been, "Search and Destroy." But, for the most part, the 
atmosphere has been festive. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, at an interfaith service last Sunday, Archbishop Anthony Pantin 
called upon the islanders to be on their best behavior today. 
</P>
<P>
"Respect the rights of others," he said. "We need a warm heart, one of 
sportsmanship. If the USA does something good, give them a little clap, too. Be 
proud, and keep everything in proper perspective." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador, Charles A. Gargano, issued a statement Friday to the 
people of T&amp;T. 
</P>
<P>
"This World Cup qualifying match -- important as it is -- will pass," he said. 
"Our nations' friendship will remain." 
</P>
<P>
It is, after all, only a game. 
</P>
<P>
Or is it?

Washington's Huskies overcame three intercepted passes and a lost fumble by 
quarterback Cary Conklin to beat Washington State, 20-9, Saturday in their 
annual Apple Cup rivalry to earn a trip to the Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, jubilant Washington students overwhelmed security police and 
tore down the goal post on the west end of Husky Stadium and threw it in nearby 
Lake Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Police sprayed tear gas on several students and scuffled and wrestled with 
others on the field. Some students pelted police with ice kept from behind the 
Washington bench. 
</P>
<P>
In the game, the Huskies' offense managed only one touchdown, a 21-yard run by 
Greg Lewis with eight seconds left in the third quarter, but their defense did 
an outstanding job against WSU quarterback Brad Gossen and Cougar star running 
back Steve Broussard. Washington sacked Gossen eight times for losses of 41 
yards and also intercepted two of his passes. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Briscoe intercepted a Gossen pass and returned it 35 yards for a touchdown 
on the first offensive play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
By winning the Pac-10 game, Washington (7-4) moved in line for its 10th bowl 
invitation in 11 years. The formal invitation is expected next week. Washington 
State dropped to 6-5.

Derek Loville and Terry Obee made the big plays in the final quarter Saturday 
as the Oregon Ducks beat archrival Oregon State, 30-21, to wrap up their best 
season in a quarter of a century. 
</P>
<P>
Loville rushed for 111 yards and scored two touchdowns and Obee caught six 
passes for 125 yards and one score as the Ducks finished the season at 7-4 
overall and 5-3 in the Pacific 10. Even though the record is Oregon's best 
since the Ducks went 7-2-1 in 1964, they aren't expected to get a postseason 
invitation. Oregon hasn't been to a bowl game in 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State is 4-6-1 and 3-4-1 with a game remaining next Saturday at Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers trailed 16-0 at halftime but rallied to pull within 23-21 on a 
24-yard scoring pass from backup quarterback Nick Schichtle to Pat Chaffey with 
7:51 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Then Loville, who moved up to No. 10 on the Pac-10 career rushing list, scored 
on a two-yard run to make it 30-21 with 4:41 left. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon's Bill Musgrave completed 19 of 38 passes for 267 yards to break the 
single-season passing yardage record set by Chris Miller in 1986. Musgrave, a 
junior, passed for 2,761 yards this season.

SOME FAMILIAR NAMES VIE AT ASCOT ON THANKSGIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The usual sprinkling of Indianapolis 500 veterans and a familiar generational 
continuity reflect the kind of tradition that surrounds the 49th running of the 
150-lap Thanksgiving Night midget auto race at Ascot Park on Oct. 23 
</P>
<P>
In this event, where 70 drivers will attempt to keep perennial favorite Ron 
Shuman of Tempe, Ariz., from victory circle, the Indy ranks will be made up of 
Rich Vogler of Indianapolis, Billy Vukovich III of Coursegold, Calif., Stan Fox 
of Janesville, Wis., and Johnny Parsons of Brownsburg, Ind., from recent grids. 
</P>
<P>
And in a field that follows some of the biggest names in auto racing, who have 
been at Ascot or its predecessor tracks since the Turkey night race began at 
Gilmore Stadium in 1934, Vukovich represents the best of a third generation. 
Grandfather Bill got a Thanksgiving win in 1948 and father Bill, Jr., had three 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons would like to emulate his father, Johnnie, who won in 1955. Also 
youthful P.J. Jones hopes to try and match the success of his dad, Parnelli, 
who won in 1964 and 1966. The series has had one father-son duo on its victory 
list with Tony Bettenhausen (1959) and son Gary in 19677 and 1970. 
</P>
<P>
However all those names -- and people like A.J. Foyt, Mario Andretti, Sam 
Hanks, Johnny Rutherford Rodger Ward and Jones (Indy 500 winners who have 
started in this event) -- didn't match the modern exploits of Shuman. The 
latter, better known for prowess in sprint cars, has won six times in the last 
10 years. And, in that span, his laps led -- 663 out of 1,000 -- is more than 
all the other contestants combined. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Shuman is coming off a third place in 1988 and will be most 
concerned with Vogler and defending champion Chuck Gurney, who will team in a 
pair of Arias-powered machines entered by Larry Howard of Murrietta, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Four of Shuman's six wins came in Howard-owned midgets. When Vogler broke a 
jinx on Ascot's half mile with his first victory in the midget half of the 
Pacific Coast Nationals, it was in a Howard machine. 
</P>
<P>
For Gurney, a repeat would cap a season that has seen him win the Belleville 
(Kan.) Nationals, midget racing's richest event and the United States Auto Club 
national championship for Silver Crown (championship dirt) cars. 
</P>
<P>
Two other former Turkey night champions, Kevin Olson of Machesney Park, Ill., 
and Brent Kaeding of Campbell, Calif., along with Southern California's two top 
pilots -- Sleep Tripp of Costa Mesa and Robby Flock of City of Industry.

MOURNING GROWS UP IN PUBLIC 
</P>

<P>
Alonzo Mourning's spring began when Duke's Phil Henderson dunked on him in the 
NCAA tournament East regional final. It took a turn with Georgetown Coach John 
Thompson's shocking statement on national television that he had learned 
Mourning and Hoyas starting power forward John Turner had been seen 
fraternizing with alleged drug kingpin Rayful Edmond III. By the time summer 
rolled around, Turner had disappeared from Georgetown's program and the usually 
engaging Mourning seemed to have disappeared from view. No interviews, no 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
But fall now has fallen and the 6-foot-10 center from Chesapeake, Va., is back. 
He is a year older, a year stronger, a year smarter -- on and, perhaps more 
important, off the court. Oh yes, he also has a new, left-handed hook shot as 
sweet as the melody of Al Jarreau's 1980 song entitled "Alonzo." Its chorus 
consists of one line repeated four times: "Alonzo declared that he must reach 
to heaven forever." 
</P>
<P>
Others say the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson: "I think Alonzo is like every other young person who is expected to 
be different because he's Alonzo Mourning. He's expected to be different 
because people know what he does because people are interested in what he does. 
But that's why a person comes to college. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't come to college to be mature, you come to acquire maturity. You 
don't come to college educated, you come to college to receive an education. I 
think that's part of the role and responsibility I have as a coach. Anytime I 
feel a person is not receptive to that or I am unable to contribute to that, 
then adjustments are made. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased with his actions." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Mourning said of his relationship with Edmond, now on trial 
on cocaine conspiracy charges: "I made a mistake and I have to learn from my 
mistake of a bad association. You know, it really hurt me. But that's something 
I can use for the rest of my life, learning about who I associate with, because 
I'm going to be introduced to so many people while doing what I do right now. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have happened to anybody, but I have (to) take that in stride and 
just use that as a positive thing and go on with my life." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, that life involves helping the Hoyas defend their Big East 
regular-season and tournament championships and make a run at the NCAA title. 
Georgetown's 29-5 record last season was built in large part on seniors Charles 
Smith, Jaren Jackson, Bobby Winston and Johnathan Edwards. But a large burden 
fell to Mourning. 
</P>
<P>
A freshman, he responded by leading the nation in blocked shots (five per game 
for a school single-season record 169), leading Georgetown in rebounding (7.3 
per game) and being the Hoyas' second-leading scorer (13.2 points per game). He 
was named Big East defensive player of the year and a third-team all-America. 
This season, he is expected to perform even better -- and as Hoyas senior guard 
Dwayne Bryant asked, "How much better can you get?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's any different from high school," Mourning said. "Everybody 
expected a lot out of me in high school and during my first collegiate season, 
and I think it's going to continue. All I can do is keep my composure because 
I'm not going to be able to play great in every game." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA tournament game against Duke was a good example. In the second half 
Mourning had three points, one rebound and one blocked shot. His nadir came 
with 9 1/2 minutes to play and the Blue Devils leading, 60-56. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, a 6-4, 165-pound guard, knifed down the lane, sprang and slammed in 
Mourning's face. The crowd ignited and so did Duke, which added eight points to 
its lead before the Hoyas began a futile comeback to which Mourning contributed 
virtually nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Things like that are going to happen," Mourning said. "I'm at a level now 
where I'm playing against guys that have tremendous athletic ability. Phil 
Henderson just got a step on me. It's nothing unreasonable. I'm learning." 
</P>
<P>
Part of what he learned was to become stronger and less predictable. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that people are going to watch the tapes of last season," Mourning 
said. "They will know that I love to go right, so I kind of figured I had to 
come back with something new." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to working on the lefty hook, Mourning spent a great deal of time 
this summer lifting weights with 7-foot-2 junior center Dikembe Mutombo. The 
results have been striking. "Both of them are stronger," Thompson said. 
"Dikembe's is a little different because his is a wiry strength, but with 
Alonzo, sometimes it's almost frightening. I see my players jumping out of his 
way." 
</P>
<P>
This is the last thing Georgetown's opponents needed -- particularly now that 
Thompson is heeding some advice he received this summer from Red Auerbach. 
</P>
<P>
"We were eating lunch," Thompson recalled, "and I said, 'What do you think 
about the two big guys?' As only Red could say, he said, 'I like 'em.' Then I 
said, 'You know, I didn't play them together a lot last year.' And he said, 
'Yes, John, and your opponents loved it.' He didn't say anything more. I got 
the message." 
</P>
<P>
So Mourning and Mutombo, who combined to account for 244 of Georgetown's 
NCAA-record 309 blocked shots last season (the previous mark was 233), will 
play together "as much as possible" this season, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Mourning and Mutombo figure to find the lane very crowded during a season in 
which the Big East will be experimenting with a rule requiring six (rather than 
five) fouls for disqualification. It could be a major test for Mourning. He 
will be expected by John Thompson to fall in behind the leadership of the 
Hoyas' five seniors. Yet, like the words in the song bearing his name, Alonzo 
declares that he must reach for heaven. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of the leadership should be left up to the seniors because 
they've experienced a lot more than I have," Mourning said. "But being that I'm 
looked at by so many people as the great Alonzo Mourning, I think I have to set 
an example for people, too. I have to be a leader by example, by my play and by 
my actions off the court."

NORTH CAROLINA ST., VALVANO START OUT AMID CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The exhibition game was over, and as the members of the North Carolina State 
basketball team filed back into their dressing room at Reynolds Coliseum, they 
seemed to know what was coming. Another round of questions, the kind of 
full-court press they are tired of seeing -- and reading about the next day. 
</P>
<P>
For the last 10 months, head coach Jim Valvano and his program have been under 
suspicion, and under siege. The Wolfpack, once the object of unabashed 
affection, now is being bashed along Tobacco Road. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is not going to like what you represent," center Avie Lester said. 
"You get to know who your friends are real quick." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy has swirled here since Jan. 7, the day a Raleigh newspaper 
printed the contents of the dust jacket on Peter Golenbock's book, "Personal 
Fouls: Broken Promises and Shattered Dreams of Big Money Basketball at Jim 
Valvano's North Carolina State." In essence, it charged Valvano with running a 
dirty program. 
</P>
<P>
It still is swirling, as the 1989-90 college basketball season begins Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
There is a great deal of uncertainty, both on and off the court, as the 
Wolfpack opens with a first-round home game against Richmond in the preseason 
National Invitation Tournament. Some of the questions will be answered possibly 
this week when N.C. State learns whether it will be sanctioned by the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the allegations contained in the book -- including grade-fixing, 
altering the results of drug tests and payoffs by boosters in cash and cars -- 
have proved unfounded after investigations by the National Collegiate Athletic 
Association and a commission appointed by the North Carolina University System. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA charged the program with eight potential violations (one of which was 
dropped), including players scalping their tickets to the Atlantic Coast 
Conference tournament and selling their sneakers for inflated prices. 
</P>
<P>
The state-appointed Poole Commission, in its 32-page report, concluded that 
Valvano and his coaching staff circumvented rules so they could keep players 
eligible. It recommended that Valvano, who also had been the school's athletic 
director for the past three years, keep just one of the jobs. To show it was 
serious about correcting the problem, N.C. State sanctioned itself by 
prohibiting any off-campus basketball recruiting this year. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the controversy remains. Whether it can be a rallying point, as it was last 
season when the Wolfpack won the Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season 
title, remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
"Last season the team pulled together during the adversity," Valvano said 
recently. "It could be the same this year, or it could tear things apart." 
</P>
<P>
A few questions are left to be answered, some pertaining to basketball: 
</P>
<P>
How will the 19th-ranked Wolfpack recover from the loss of starting center 
Chucky Brown, now with the Cleveland Cavaliers, and last year's one-man bench, 
Kelsey Weems? 
</P>
<P>
How will junior guards Chris Corchiani and Rodney Monroe handle defenses 
designed to stop them? 
</P>
<P>
How will Valvano deal with the first real significant, and widespread, 
criticism during his colorful and successful career? 
</P>
<P>
Another matter for debate is Lester's status. A senior whose eligibility this 
season hinged on his performance in summer school, Lester finds himself in 
limbo. He is eligible, according to the academic standards of the NCAA, ACC and 
N.C. State. But a recommendation made to the Poole commission by Valvano to 
toughen academic guidelines for his players has left Lester sidelined 
temporarily. As of Tuesday, it still was not clear whether he would be in the 
lineup Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
What no one seems to dispute is that the start of a new season is a welcome 
relief for Valvano and his players. "We're really glad to get out and play," 
said Monroe, a former St. Maria Goretti star who is considered the preseason 
favorite for ACC Player of the Year. "I don't know what's going to happen with 
the NCAA. If we do get some sort of probation, we'll deal with it, and just go 
on like we've done in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Valvano said, "Let the games begin." 
</P>
<P>
Much of N.C. State's success this year will hinge on Valvano's resiliency. 
After nine years at N.C. State, and nearly two decades as a college head coach, 
Valvano's horizons have continued to broaden. Last spring he did a nationally 
syndicated television show called "The Lighter Side of Sports." He was a 
candidate for a couple of professional coaching jobs, most seriously with the 
Los Angeles Clippers, and he turned down an offer from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Valvano's coaching peers say they believe this 10th season will be his 
last in Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to be in the NBA, or doing television," said a college coach who has 
known Valvano for 15 years. "This whole thing has worn him out." 
</P>
<P>
Harold Hopfenberg, a career academician at N.C. State who took over as the 
university's interim athletic director Oct. 16, said: "I have no idea if that's 
true. Our conversations have gone in the opposite direction. He has talked 
about what kind of team we'll have in a couple of years. I don't know Jim well 
enough to know what he's thinking about privately, but obviously this isn't 
unreasonable speculation. It would not shock me. It would not surprise me." 
</P>
<P>
There are some who think that Valvano might not have a choice, that the 
bright-red welcome mat Valvano turned into his own magic carpet by winning the 
national championship in 1983 is tattered. The recent episode, certainly the 
most devastating in terms of his reputation, has taken its toll. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano is trying not only to rebuild his team, but his image as well. He still 
quotes Mark Twain and Rudyard Kipling, as well as Princeton Coach Pete Carril, 
but Valvano has toned down his act considerably. The faucet of one-liners has 
been shut off, at least for public consumption. "I'm a more private person," 
said Valvano, 43. "I don't think I've lost my sense of humor, but I do share it 
more sparingly."

TYSON-RUDDOCK BOUT APPEARS HEADED FROM CANADA TO JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALLACE MATTHEWS, NEWSDAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It looks as if the Great White North is going to be left out in the cold. 
Frantic negotiations to try to salvage the Jan. 20 date for the Mike 
Tyson-Razor Ruddock bout failed Wednesday night, and now it appears the site of 
the bout will be shifted from Edmonton's Northlands Coliseum to the Tokyo Dome 
on Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to hold the Canadian deal together verged on the comical, what with 
11 people -- some in Edmonton, some in Las Vegas and a few in New York -- on a 
conference call that lasted 90 minutes and ended inconclusively about 6 p.m. On 
the call were HBO's Seth Abraham; promoter Don King and his attorney, Charles 
Lomax; Canadian promoter Garry Stephenson; Ruddock's promoter, Murad Muhammad 
and his trainer, Janks Morton; lawyers representing the Northlands Coliseum and 
the two Canadian financial backers, who now stand to lose a bundle. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no Tyson fight in January," Abraham said. "I believe now that 
the fight will wind up in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
The stumbling block apparently was the inability of the Canadians to guarantee 
financing for the Jan. 20 date. Previously, $2.5 million had been guaranteed to 
King and Tyson in the form of letters-of-credit that apparently expire in 
December. Additionally, King and Tyson were paid $600,000 in cash and ran up 
$800,000 in expenses that were charged to the promoters -- money they now will 
be hard-pressed to recover. 
</P>
<P>
The hectic negotiations turned out to have been dictated by the deadline for 
the January issue of the monthly HBO program guide, which had to be sent out to 
the printers Wednesday night in order to be ready for delivery to HBO 
subscribers by Dec. 31. The way things work in cable-TV boxing, if a deal 
cannot be completed in time to get the bout listed in the program guide for the 
month in which the promoters and fighters would like to have the fight, then 
the fight gets moved to the following month. If it sounds like the tail wagging 
the dog, it is. 
</P>
<P>
And according to Abraham, King has a commitment to Japanese promoter Akihiko 
Honda for a Tyson fight on Feb. 12 in Tokyo, so if Tyson-Ruddock goes in 
February, it goes in Tokyo. And a few people in Edmonton take a nice cold bath. 
</P>
<P>
And as its substitute for Tyson-Ruddock on Saturday night -- the heavyweights' 
original date -- HBO proudly presents Julio Cesar Chavez-Sammy Fuentes. What? 
That's right, Don King's favorite benefactor showcases a fight between Chavez, 
the formidable WBC junior welterweight champ, and a man who was starched by 
Freddie Pendleton in 15 seconds last year. To flesh out the show, HBO will have 
IBF champion Meldrick Taylor on a satellite hookup from Philadelphia to comment 
before and after the fight. Taylor is slated to face Chavez on March 17. HBO 
also says King has "promised to deliver Tyson for an interview." 
</P>
<P>
The men guiding the career of Bronx middleweight Dennis Milton are so sure they 
have hooked up to a winner they are paying Michael Olajide $100,000 to step 
into the ring with their tiger on Dec. 1 in Albany. Milton, suddenly hot with a 
win over Robbie Sims in August, will get $25,000. Lenny Menudo, Milton's 
well-heeled manager, stands to lose a bundle since he has no TV money to cover 
the purses. "I'm willing to live with the loss because I'm looking toward the 
future," Menudo said. "I want the world to see that Dennis Milton is the 
world's best middleweight." 
</P>
<P>
The friends of Hector Camacho are starting to worry about the flighty junior 
welterweight, who has not been seen or heard from in a couple of days. Most 
disturbing is this past weekend Camacho stood up a young lady who had bid 
$2,100 for a date with the Macho Man at an auction to benefit the Heart Fund in 
Fort Myers, Fla. Camacho's sudden disappearance has raised rumors that perhaps 
he is looking to pull out of his Feb. 3 date against Vinny Pazienza. Camacho's 
longtime friend, Patrick Flannery, was especially worried about Camacho, who 
was unreachable at his usual haunts. "This kid would never go four days without 
calling me," he said. "There is something traumatic in the wind." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Mercer's poor showing against Jerry Jones Tuesday night has killed plans 
for a proposed fight with Carl Williams in February. Mercer, the Olympic 
heavyweight champion, is not ready to face The Truth. 
</P>
<P>
Madison Square Garden pays a not-so-fond farewell to the Beacon Theatre 
Thursday night, which will be retired after hosting two shows that were 
displaced from the Felt Forum. Thursday night's show features lightweight Tunde 
Foster vs. William Rojas and unbeaten middleweight prospect Merqui Sosa facing 
slippery veteran Sanderline Williams. In December, MSG boxing has a show in 
Atlantic City and one in Missouri -- and no shows in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Joey Maxim is getting the Rocky Marciano Award and Eddie Futch the "Salute to 
Boxing Greats" Award at the Downtown Athletic Club's 14th annual dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Brooklyn's heavyweight hopeful, Riddick Bowe (10-0, 9 KOs), fights Bobby Jones 
(13-2) in Washington Saturday night, in an off TV date. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. spies report Marty Cohen, the 92-year-old manager of Michael Dokes, was 
furious with an overweight Dokes' lethargic performance against Lionel 
Washington Monday night. Dokes, who weighed 253 1/2, stopped Washington in the 
eighth, but was cut badly in two places and dropped in the seventh. According 
to earwitnesses, Cohen, whom Dokes calls "Popsy," told Dokes, "I won't let you 
fight again if you ever get this out of shape." Luckily for Dokes, his poor 
effort was seen only on L.A.'s Prime Ticket cable network. Otherwise he may 
have lost all hope for a shot at Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
It was lights, camera, distraction for Tommy Morrison Tuesday night in West 
Orange, N.J. Morrison, the 20-0 heavyweight who is John Wayne's grandnephew, 
agreed to allow Sylvester Stallone, Burt Young and Co. to invade his dressing 
room and corner before and after his bout with Lorenzo Canady at the South 
Mountain Arena to film scenes to be used in "Rocky V," Stallone's next 
excursion into phony pugilism in which Morrison will co-star as Stallone's 
protege. 
</P>
<P>
The whole thing turned into a giant pain for Morrison when 25 Hollywood types 
crowded his dressing room before the bout, disrupting his prefight 
concentration. As a result, Morrison turned in a subpar performance against 
Canady, suffering a cut under his right eye and getting nailed repeatedly by a 
fighter who was stopped in less than a minute by Tyson in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
John Brown, Morrison's trainer and co-manager, was said to be equally perturbed 
about the intrusion and regretted allowing it to take place. But still, Cayton 
and Brown will allow the 20-year-old Morrison, following a fight against 
washed-up Quick Tillis on Dec. 7, to put his career on hold for three months to 
complete the film. "It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that will in no way 
detract from Tommy's boxing development," Cayton said. "It will pay him more 
money than he has made in all his fights put together and give him more 
worldwide recognition than has been enjoyed by any fighter with the exception 
of Ali and Tyson." 
</P>
<P>
Funny P.S.: The last time celluloid boxing expert Burt Young was at the South 
Mountain Arena, he was collecting the limp form of Dave Sears, a Howard Beach 
light-heavyweight he managed who had just been KOd in 66 seconds by champion 
Bobby Czyz. "I don't understand this kid," Young said of Sears. "In the gym, 
he's the greatest fighter I ever seen. But in a fight, he just falls apart."

Seventh-ranked Miami waited until halftime against San Diego State to start 
thinking about next week's showdown with No. 1 Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
That was long enough, as the Hurricanes dashed to a 28-0 lead and went on to 
beat the Aztecs, 42-6, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"The first half, we were great," said Hurricane receiver Dale Dawkins, who 
caught two touchdown passes in the opening 18 minutes. "In the second half we 
were a little relaxed. We were looking toward the Notre Dame game, thinking, 
'What can we do to beat those guys?' " 
</P>
<P>
The win virtually assured the Hurricanes (9-1) of a Sugar Bowl invitation, 
which likely will be extended just before the Notre Dame game Saturday night. 
Miami's probable opponent in the Sugar Bowl is No. 4 Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
The win also kept the Hurricanes in contention for the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy to be through with this football game, to be honest with you," 
Miami Coach Dennis Erickson said. "We played better than I thought we would 
play. When everybody is talking about Notre Dame all week and you've got 
another game to play, this is a great win for us." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego fell to 6-4-1 with its first loss in six games. 
</P>
<P>
Miami's Craig Erickson overcame five interceptions with 424 yards and four 
touchdowns passing, including three in the first 18 minutes. The defense then 
took over, limiting the Aztecs to field goals of 50 and 49 yards by Andy 
Trakas. 
</P>
<P>
The Hurricanes sacked San Diego State's Dan McGwire 10 times. Defensive end 
Greg Mark had four sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"We just pinned our ears back and came," Mark said. "People have been saying 
we've been winning ugly, so we wanted to win pretty." 
</P>
<P>
Erickson had touchdown pass plays of seven and 19 yards to Dawkins, nine yards 
to Randy Bethel and nine yards to Pee Wee Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Against a defense that blitzed on most plays, Erickson threw for 299 yards in 
the first half and finished with 27 completions in 45 attempts. But during a 
stretch of six possessions midway through the game, Erickson threw four 
interceptions and lost a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
"Offensively we were very inconsistent," Dennis Erickson said. "I wasn't happy 
with the offensive performance at all, and that's not easy to say when you 
score 42 points." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire completed 18 of 41 passes for 163 yards with three interceptions. The 
deepest penetration by the Aztecs, who were averaging nearly 34 points per 
game, was the Hurricanes' 25-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State senior Monty Gilbreath caught six passes to break the school 
career record with 181. Tom Delaney set the previous record of 180 in 1968-70.

Peter Tom Willis threw a school-record six touchdown passes -- all in the first 
half -- and fifth-ranked Florida State won its eighth consecutive game by 
routing Memphis State, 57-20, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Seminoles (8-2) scored 21 points during a 68-second span en route to a 
51-13 halftime lead. Willis, who completed 23 of 31 passes for a career-high 
482 yards before leaving midway through the third quarter, threw five touchdown 
passes in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Willis, a fifth-year senior who sat on the Florida State bench until this 
season, completed 20 of 24 passes for 423 yards before intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State's corps of wide receivers, known as the "Fab Four," all caught 
scoring passes along with freshman tailback Amp Lee, who scored on a 51-yard 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Lewis was the lone player to catch two touchdown passes, combining with 
Willis on scoring plays covering 12 and 59 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Dawsey scored on a 26-yard pass, Bruce LaSane caught a 15-yard 
touchdown throw and Terry Anthony's 12-yard scoring reception ended the 
first-half outburst. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis State finished at 2-9.

NEW SPEED INDEX DOESN'T FIGURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Daily Racing Form carries the authority of holy writ; every symbol and 
number in its past performances is invested with significance. 
</P>
<P>
The paper's publishers rarely tamper with their product. But the Form now has 
introduced a whole new component to the record of every horse in North America, 
the Speed Index, and has ballyhooed the innovation daily in its pages. 
</P>
<P>
At the bottom of each horse's record there now appears a line such as this: 
</P>
<P>
"Speed Index: Last Race: (plus)2.0. 3-Race Avg.: (plus)3.3. 9-Race Avg.: 
(plus)0.9. Overall Avg.: -1.7." 
</P>
<P>
This is the Form's belated response to decades of criticism that its speed 
ratings are worthless. It was surely prompted by the arrival of a competing 
paper, the defunct Figs Form, which made its sophisticated speed figures the 
centerpiece of its product. 
</P>
<P>
The Speed Index is derived from the two numbers that always have appeared in 
every past-performance line, the speed rating and the track variant. 
</P>
<P>
When a horse's record shows a pair of numbers like 72-23, the 72 is the rating, 
which shows how fast he ran; the 23 is the variant, which supposedly reflects 
the condition of the racing strip. Horseplayers traditionally have added the 
two figures together, but now the Form saves them the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
It compares the sum with 100, and that's the Speed Index. In the case of the 
72-23 horse, those numbers total 95, so the Speed Index is -5.0. 
</P>
<P>
This calculation evokes the old aphorism of computer programmers, "garbage in, 
garbage out," because the speed ratings and track variants on which the Speed 
Index is based are riddled with flaws. 
</P>
<P>
In the Racing Form's speed-rating system, the best time run at a particular 
track and distance during the past three years has a value of 100. One point is 
subtracted from 100 for each fifth of a second slower than this standard. 
</P>
<P>
If the best six-furlong time at Laurel is 1:09, a horse who runs in 1:12 has 
run 15 fifths of a second slower than the record and thus gets a rating of 85. 
The defects of this method could be seen clearly in a race this week at Laurel. 
</P>
<P>
A horse named Daisy Patch has an overwhelmingly superior Speed Index for his 
last race -- which he earned by running 1 1/4 miles in 2:07 3-5 at Penn 
National. 
</P>
<P>
That is ridiculously slow time, but Daisy Patch gets a high rating because Penn 
National cards few races at this distance and the track record for the distance 
is unrealistically slow. 
</P>
<P>
Any horse who runs 1 1/4 miles at Penn National will get a good speed rating. 
Track records are a flimsy basis for evaluating horses' times. 
</P>
<P>
If the Racing Form's speed ratings are filled with such logical 
inconsistencies, the track variants are even more misleading. 
</P>
<P>
They purport to show how fast the racing surface is on any given day -- again, 
by making comparisons with the track record. Last Thursday, a filly named Find 
Rachele had the superior Speed Index in a field, based on a speed rating of 82 
and a track variant of 22 -- numbers that suggested she had run reasonably fast 
on a track that was fairly slow. But these figures proved to be misleading, 
because of the way the variant was calculated: 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 24, Find Rachele ran 1 1-16 miles in 1:46 1-5, earning a speed rating 
of 82, because she was 18 fifths of a second slower than the record for that 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
One other route race was run the same day; it happened to be an event for cheap 
maidens, and the time was 1:47 4-5 -- 26 fifths slower than the record. 
</P>
<P>
The Form averaged 18 and 26 to come up with the variant of 22. Find Rachele 
came up with a good figure because the other route race happened to be a cheap 
slow one. 
</P>
<P>
If Find Rachele had run on a day when a fast stakes race was being run, the 
variant would have been lower and she would have wound up with a much worse 
Speed Index for the same performance. 
</P>
<P>
Serious handicappers recognize these flaws and ignore the speed ratings in the 
Form but, even so, the introduction of the Speed Index is galling. 
</P>
<P>
If the Daily Racing Form wants to improve its product, it could make plenty of 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
It ought to show when horses have been treated with Lasix in previous starts. 
</P>
<P>
It might show (as Figs Form did) an indication that horses have worn bandages 
in their previous starts. 
</P>
<P>
It could show horses who were equipped with stickers on sloppy tracks. 
</P>
<P>
But the Racing Form has ignored these possibilities and instead put its effort 
and hype behind a calculation that is no more than a recycling of the same old 
trash.

The seventh annual Skins Game next weekend at PGA West in La Quinta could be 
called the Almost Seniors Skins Game if it weren't for Curtis Strange, the baby 
of the foursome that will shoot it out hole by hole for $450,000 in two days. 
</P>
<P>
Strange is 34, but Lee Trevino will turn 50 -- the legal age for senior 
membership in professional golf -- on Dec. 1 and Jack Nicklaus will do the same 
on Jan. 21. Raymond Floyd, the defending Skins champion, is 47. 
</P>
<P>
They will play nine holes Saturday and nine holes Sunday on the TPC's stadium 
course for a designated prize on each hole. If two or more players tie on a 
hole, the prize is carried over to the next hole. 
</P>
<P>
Strange, winner of the U.S. Open in 1988 and '89, will be looking for his first 
dollar in the event after being skinned last year. Floyd, on the other hand, 
will be trying to match or top the $290,000 he took home last year. 
</P>
<P>
Chi Chi Rodriguez will conduct his humorous and informative clinic Saturday 
before the Skins Game tee-off. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Charles and Orville Moody will continue their battle for the Senior PGA 
Tour's money-winning honors in the GTE West tournament Nov. 30-Dec. 2 at the 
Ojai Valley resort course. 
</P>
<P>
Charles, the New Zealander who began last week only $152 ahead of Moody, 
increased his margin to $15,111 with a second place in Las Vegas, where the 
Sarge tied for seventh. Charles has earned $592,390 with two tournaments 
remaining, Ojai Valley and the GTE Kaanapali event Dec. 7-9 at Lahaina, Hawaii 
(on the island of Maui). 
</P>
<P>
After a two-day pro-am Nov. 28-29, the 72 senior professionals will play 54 
holes for $350,000. Harold Henning of South Africa is the defending champion, 
and the field will include Arnold Palmer, Billy Casper, Gene Littler and Don 
January, as well as Charles, Moody and Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino, who missed becoming eligible to play at Ojai by one day, will have to 
wait until the following week to join the seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus will enter the senior ranks Jan. 27-28 in the Seniors Skins Game in 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four of the best collegiate men's and women's teams in the country will 
play this week in the Pioneer Electronics Bruin Desert tournament at the 
Mission Hills complex in Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
The festivities begin today with a pro-am that includes LPGA pros Amy Alcott, 
honorary coach of the Bruins, and two recent UCLA graduates -- Kay Cockerill 
and Kristal Parker. The three-day event will start Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Heading the women's field will be freshman Brandie Burton of Arizona State, 
recent winner of the Tulsa and Stanford Invitationals; senior Jean Zeditz of 
host UCLA, a first-team All-American last year and winner of the BYU and Oregon 
Invitationals this year, and Pat Hurst and Dina Ammaccapane, who helped San 
Jose State win the NCAA championship last season. 
</P>
<P>
First-year coach Dave Atchison and his UCLA squad are favored in the men's 
division. The Bruins are led by seniors Rob Sullivan and Ken Tanigawa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

NEWSWIRE: CRASH KILLS 2 FROM WOMEN'S COLLEGE TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A van carrying members of the Muskingum College women's basketball team slid 
out of control on an icy interstate highway Saturday morning and was struck by 
a tractor-trailer, killing two women and injuring five. 
</P>
<P>
The van was one of two carrying the team to a tournament at Frostburg State 
University in Frostburg, Md. The second van was not involved in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Killed were Michelle Simpson, 18, a freshman, and Mary Smith, 20, a team 
manager, said Patricia Ellertson, a spokesperson for the college. The injured 
were taken to Ohio Valley Medical Center in Wheeling, W.Va., about 10 miles 
away, where four team members were being treated in the intensive care unit, 
the hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident happened about 8:15 a.m on Interstate 70 near the town of St. 
Clairsville, in eastern Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
The van, headed east, apparently tried to slow down on a part of the road made 
slick by a snow squall, said Sgt. Cliff Russell of the highway patrol's St. 
Clairsville post. It and two cars behind it slid out of control, and a 
tractor-trailer approaching from behind clipped the rear of one car, then 
rammed the van's passenger side, Russell said.

AS SEASON SORTS OUT WINNERS AND LOSERS, 49ERS STILL NFL'S BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG LOGAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 10 games, the 28-team NFL field has sorted itself out so neatly that all 
six division races have a clear leader; strengths and weaknesses are 
well-defined; and the teams with enough youth and depth to withstand key 
injuries have come to the fore. The playoff contenders are leaving the 
backstretch, and as New York Giants Coach Bill Parcells said, "Now is when 
you've got to start thinking about the stretch run." 
</P>
<P>
That goes for NFL writers, too. Here is one man's analysis of each division and 
the wild-card situation: 
</P>
<P>
* NFC East -- The Giants should win it. Think of their 31-10 loss to the Los 
Angeles Rams as something comparable to a necessary correction in the stock 
market. It's a 16-game season, and the Giants were due for an off game after 
several weeks of peak performance. Parcells is pushing the right buttons, and 
the Philadelphia Eagles are two games back and playing poorly on offense. The 
true measure of the Giants will come in Weeks 12-14 when they play at San 
Francisco, home against the Eagles and at Denver. The Rams? They will have a 
tough time winning a divisional playoff game in January at Giants Stadium -- if 
they get that far. 
</P>
<P>
* NFC Central -- The Minnesota Vikings' pass rush is on a record-setting pace 
with 50 sacks, just 22 short of the NFL record set in 1984 by the Chicago 
Bears. But they still are muddling around on offense, trying to figure out how 
to use Herschel Walker, and their lone divisional loss was to the Bears. Only 
one of the Vikings' six remaining opponents has a losing record, so the Bears 
still have a shot. 
</P>
<P>
* NFC West -- The 49ers easily are the class of the league and have the best 
chance of any team to repeat as Super Bowl champs since the 1978-79 Pittsburgh 
Steelers. They're determined to prove they can win without former Coach Bill 
Walsh. His successor, George Seifert, has filled those big shoes, if not the 
big ego, admirably. 
</P>
<P>
* NFC wild-card situation -- The Bears-Vikings loser in the NFC Central should 
gain one wild-card berth. The Eagles, Rams and New Orlans Saints will battle 
for the other spot. The Rams have the most talent, but if the Saints complete a 
sweep of the season series with the Rams at home in Week 12, they will be in a 
strong position. 
</P>
<P>
* AFC East -- Buffalo has a rugged schedule, but the Bills' defense and 
quarterback Jim Kelly are up to it. Week 15 may provide a Super Bowl preview 
when the Bills visit the 49ers. The Dolphins have a soft schedule, but Miami is 
the only team with a winning record that has given up more points than it has 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
* AFC Central -- Bud Carson's Cleveland Browns have the No. 1 defense against 
scoring in the NFL, and they have fashioned an adequate running game with the 
emergence of rookie running back Eric Metcalf. They are capable of winning the 
division, but it might go down to the final game of the season at Houston. The 
Cincinnati Bengals will struggle to finish above .500. 
</P>
<P>
* AFC West -- The Broncos all but clinched it with a win over the Kansas City 
Chiefs for a three-game lead. They will be tough if they earn the home field 
advantage throughout the playoffs, especially since former Los Angeles Raiders 
Coach Mike Shanahan is working with quarterback John Elway again. 
</P>
<P>
* AFC wild-card situation -- The second-place finisher between the Browns and 
Oilers in the AFC Central will get one spot. The Dolphins have the inside track 
for the other but may stumble in two games with the Chiefs. If that happens, 
the Bengals or Raiders could sneak in. 
</P>
<P>
* NFC playoffs -- No one will stop the 49ers, but the Giants have the best 
chance if they can keep Ottis Anderson and the running game going strong enough 
to set up Phil Simms' passing in the playoffs. The Vikings have the talent but 
seem to lack the chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
* AFC playoffs -- The Bills are the best all-round AFC team, but the 
sentimental choice, the Browns, will pull off a couple of playoff upsets to 
reach New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
* Super Bowl -- The preseason choice here hasn't changed: 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from newspapers in Raleigh, N.C., and Atlanta that the New York Jets 
have contacted Duke Coach Steve Spurrier as a potential replacement for Coach 
Joe Walton don't necessarily mean the Jets are ready to make a move. After the 
1987 season, they explored the idea of hiring Carl Peterson, who since has 
become the Chiefs' president and general manager, but decided against making a 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, it will be surprising if the Jets don't recognize the 
need for change this time around and if they don't also research the top NFL 
assistants, as well as college coaches. Of course, it would help if they had a 
football man in charge of the search. 
</P>
<P>
No one should question the courage of Jets QB Ken O'Brien because he failed to 
go headfirst into Dolphins safety Louis Oliver at the goal line in one of the 
key plays of a 31-23 loss. If things were going well for the Jets and O'Brien, 
he certainly would have reacted differently. His instinct to avoid the hit 
showed not a lack of toughness, but rather that O'Brien has taken such a 
pounding in a 2-8 season that he is like a fighter bobbing and weaving and 
trying to survive with his back against the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
The search for the "next Lawrence Taylor" is over now that rookie outside 
linebacker Derrick Thomas has arrived with the Chiefs. He's stronger against 
the run than the Bills' Cornelius Bennett and a more consistent pass rusher. 
"He's in that class of player," Pro Bowl safety Deron Cherry said of Thomas. 
"They threw him in the fire from the first day. He had to learn or look bad, 
and he doesn't like to look bad." 
</P>
<P>
Eagles QB Randall Cunningham, whose receivers dropped 11 passes in a 10-3 loss 
to the Washington Redskins, heard boos from the Philadelphia crowd, which is no 
surprise. "The fans are used to seeing a high-powered offense," Cunningham 
said. Hinting he would like to be turned loose to throw more, he added, "I 
can't boo." 
</P>
<P>
Cowboys cornerback Everson Walls, a former Pro Bowl player, said Coach Jimmy 
Johnson's plan to give more playing time to Issiac Holt is the first step 
toward getting rid of Walls. Walls was responsible for giving up a 
fourth-quarter TD pass in a 24-20 loss to Phoenix, and Johnson shouted at him 
for talking to his friends on the Cardinals after the game. Said Walls: "He 
embarrassed me. Only college coaches and Mike Ditka do that ... I guess they'll 
Plan B me." 
</P>

Detroit Lions Coach Wayne Fontes on his 2-8 team's 31-22 upset of the Green Bay 
Packers, who held a 31-8 advantage in first downs and out-gained the Lions 432 
yards to 128: "We lost to ... uh ... won against a good football team. I almost 
slipped there. I've gotten used to that word."

REDSKINS' 5-FOOT-8 CORNERS WON'T ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE SOLD SHORT 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Washington Redskins' brand-new starting pair of pint-sized cornerbacks 
survived Randall Cunningham last Sunday.Few thought they'd survive training 
camp, so their ascension to first string is truly surprising. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, 5-foot-8 Anthony Johnson, is a particularly bold rookie. Regular 
starter Darrell Green used to gather the secondary in a semicircle before every 
practice and deliver a pep talk or entertaining story, and naturally the 
get-together was canceled the day after Green dislocated his wrist. But 
22-year-old Johnson jutted out his chest the second day and said, "Come on, 
come on. Everybody up, everybody up." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody budged. "He thinks he's Vince Lombardi," said free safety Todd Bowles. 
"But no one pays him any mind." 
</P>
<P>
The other cornerback, 5-8 Martin Mayhew, used to telephone his broker during 
lulls in training camp. Mayhew successfully partnered Deion Sanders in the 
Florida State secondary two years ago, but lasted through the 10th round of the 
1988 draft because some teams thought he preferred banking to football. The son 
of a school principal, he actually prefers law. "I'm really thinking about 
going to law school," he said. "But, hey, I want to play as long as I can." 
</P>
<P>
Few felt these two would be administering bump-and-run technique for the 
Redskins in November, but a series of circumstances has left them starters with 
Denver's John Elway looming Monday night. Green and Brian Davis began the year 
at the corners, but Green's injury against Tampa Bay -- coupled with Johnson's 
tender ankle -- left Barry Wilburn starting opposite Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Wilburn then went inactive two weeks ago after sources said he had tested 
positive for cocaine. That elevated Johnson, and Mayhew was then promoted over 
a struggling Davis last week. "I wouldn't have predicted this," secondary coach 
Emmitt Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
The most amazing fact is that the Redskins were the NFL's 26th-rated secondary 
before all-pro Green went down, and now rank 17th. Thomas and others say a lot 
has to do with Washington's improved pass rush (Manley had three sacks Sunday). 
Moreover, the secondary has operated the last three weeks against ineffective 
quarterbacks -- the Raiders' Jay Schroeder (after Steve Beuerlein burned them 
early), Dallas's Steve Walsh and Philadelphia's Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, a threat to pass and run, is certainly no lightweight, and Johnson 
and Mayhew's coverage was sticky enough. But without dangerous wide receiver 
Mike Quick, Cunningham throws more to his running backs, and the Redskins' 
offense kept the defense fresh by possessing the ball 37 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, it was Johnson's second league start and Mayhew's first, and it 
seems incomprehensible that they helped hold Cunningham to 177 yards passing 
considering he threw for 447 against the unit including Green and Davis in Week 
2. 
</P>
<P>
Davis may yet have his day. First he was losing jump balls to receivers (New 
York's Odessa Turner, notably) and then he was burned by pinpoint passes (to 
Phoenix's J.T. Smith, prominently). Only Green is faster, only Green can 
anticipate better, but Davis was benched last week for Mayhew. 
</P>
<P>
Redskins coaches will continue to deploy Davis in a nickel-back role with the 
hope that an interception or two will improve his confidence. 
</P>
<P>
That's not a problem with Johnson, who's garrulous and unafraid. On one Eagles 
run play Sunday, he decked Keith Byars at the line and asked defensive 
signal-caller Bowles to let him take on more runners. "He wanted more force 
calls, and Todd didn't give him any," Mayhew said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bowles: "Like his 100 pounds against Byars would work every time. You just 
had to laugh. He's a clown. He reminds me of Darrell Green a little bit, the 
way he acts. He's always saying something funny. It's his first year, and he's 
starting, and he keeps it fun for me." 
</P>
<P>
With a little more seniority, Johnson could be accepted as a leader, given his 
tendencies. While playing at Southwest Texas State, he and a teammate were 
lined up on the right side to block a field goal but Johnson saw the opponents 
were a man short on the left side, so he dragged his partner to the other side 
and blocked the kick from over there. "Good to hear," Redskins special-teams 
coach Wayne Sevier said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayhew is 24, but silent and thoughtful. After studying his Redskins playbook, 
he crams for the Law School Admissions Test he'll take in January. His goal, 
besides starting these last six games, is a career in corporate law. 
</P>
<P>
Drafted last year by Buffalo, he fractured a wrist and spent the entire season 
on injured reserve. The Bills left him unprotected following the season, but he 
said they begged him to stay. Being a finance major, he took Washington's 
generous offer of a $65,000 signing bonus instead. 
</P>
<P>
With the money, he said he did the following: bought a three-month certificate 
of deposit and three months later turned it into a land purchase with his 
father in Fort Lauderdale; bought two mutual funds; bought a stereo; bought his 
mother a car after hers caught fire; put the rest in a money-market account. 
</P>
<P>
He's good with numbers, and fortunately he curtailed wide receiver Ron 
Johnson's totals on Sunday. He was beaten on one fly pattern by Carlos Carson, 
mistiming his leap for the ball, but escaped when Carson dropped it. Cunningham 
completed a total of three passes on him. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Tallahassee, he was not widely known in high school. At Florida 
State, Sanders got by on speed, Mayhew on never-ending work. Their only loss in 
1987 was to Miami when Michael Irvin raced by Mayhew for a key touchdown, but 
the introspective Mayhew never pouted. "There probably aren't two people in the 
world who thought he could play pro ball," his Seminoles secondary coach, 
Mickey Andrews, said. "There probably aren't two that thought he could play 
college. But Martin was one of them." 
</P>
<P>
The greatest challenge for loud Johnson and quiet Mayhew is now Elway on Monday 
night. "We'll know better this week," Thomas said.

FERNANDO VALENZUELA GETS 60-DAY DRUG SUSPENSION; SUMMER SALE WINS EXPRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A little more than three weeks after cousin Patrick Valenzuela received a 
60-day drug suspension, jockey Fernando Valenzuela was given the same penalty 
by the Board of Stewards at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, 20, was fined $100 and submitted to a drug test Nov. 11 after he 
failed to show up the day before at Santa Anita and neglected to call stewards 
Pete Pedersen, Tom Ward and Hubert Jones. He was named on only one horse that 
afternoon, a $32,000 maiden named Bones M.D. in the second race. 
</P>
<P>
The stewards received written confirmation of the test results Friday morning 
from B.P.L. Toxicology Laboratory in Tarzana verifying the presence of cocaine 
and marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
So, Valenzuela, who had ridden one race in the first three days at Hollywood 
Park, is suspended for 60 days through Jan. 16, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
This determination was made after a Friday hearing at which Pedersen, Ward, 
Dave Samuel, Valenzuela and a California Horse Racing Board investigator were 
present. 
</P>
<P>
The jockey, who won with two of 46 mounts at Oak Tree, elected not to have 
counsel and readily accepted the stewards' ruling. He admitted to substance use 
on a "recreational basis." 
</P>
<P>
"He was very receptive," Ward said. "He didn't deny anything and he didn't 
challenge the test." 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen said Valenzuela was both cooperative and candid. "He said he's never 
bought cocaine," Pedersen said. "He said it's been available at parties." 
</P>
<P>
In order to be reinstated, Valenzuela will be required to enter a 
rehabilitation and testing program determined by the stewards and the Winners 
Foundation, an industry organization to help those with alcohol and/or 
substance abuse problems. When he does return to riding, he will continue to be 
subjected to drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
Besides becoming the first apprentice to ride five winners at Santa Anita in 
one day since Steve Valdez did so in 1973, Valenzuela finished fourth in the 
Oak Tree standings last year with 19 victories. 
</P>
<P>
He followed up with 30 winners at the subsequent Hollywood Park meeting, but 
the son of trainer Martin Valenzuela has been unsuccessful since losing his 
five-pound weight allowance last spring. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer season in Inglewood, he won only eight times with 196 mounts 
and he was three for 52 at Del Mar. He did, however, wind up second behind 
Corey Black in the standings at the abbreviated Orange County Fair meeting. 
</P>
<P>
According to the stewards, Valenzuela had five rulings issued against him 
during the 18-day Fairplex Park season in Pomona and this helped prompt the 
decision to test him a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Included were his failures to fulfill his riding engagements, to review films 
with the stewards after being involved in an incident during a race and to 
report to the paddock at the proper time. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these infractions, Valenzuela wasn't subjected to a drug test at that 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been good," Ward said. "He's had a couple of rulings as far as riding 
infractions go, but, to my recollection, nothing out of the ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Valenzuela's suspension came as a surprise to one trainer, who had 
used him to work a horse Saturday morning. "He just told me how well the horse 
went," the trainer said. "He's always very quiet and this is totally 
unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego-born jockey won't be able to work horses again at Hollywood Park 
during this meeting. He is denied privileges at all operating tracks in this 
jurisdiction, but he could work horses at Santa Anita until this meeting ends 
Christmas Eve. He could then reverse the procedure when Santa Anita begins Dec. 
26. 
</P>
<P>
Opening day in Arcadia is when Pat Valenzuela will be eligible to return. He 
was suspended Oct. 27 after testing positive for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The streak continues for Northern California-based horses in this part of the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Six days after Brown Bess dominated her rivals in the Yellow Ribbon and three 
days after Owiseone won the Moccasin, Summer Sale made it three in a row for 
the Bay Meadows brigade with a narrow victory in the $84,750 Hollywood Turf 
Express Saturday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Ridden by Brenna Hernandez for her husband-trainer Richard Tate, Summer Sale 
chased Sunny Blossom through some fast fractions, got the lead a sixteenth of a 
mile from the finish, then lasted by a head over Ofanto to score in 1:07 4/5 
for the six furlongs on turf. 
</P>
<P>
Sent off at 14-1, the 3-year-old Summertime Guy gelding out of the prolific 
producer General Store provided the Hernandez-Tate partnership with their 
biggest victory. 
</P>
<P>
Winless in his last five appearances, Summer Sale showed again sprinting might 
be all he really wants to do. Each of his five wins have come around one turn. 
</P>
<P>
Riding for the first time locally, Hernandez thought she had lost the photo to 
Ofanto, who rallied from far back under Gary Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he had caught us," said the jockey, who rides only sparingly in the 
north, primarily for her husband of six years. "It seems with this horse 
somebody is always catching us at the end. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad the jock's room was close to the paddock or I would have gotten lost. 
I'm one for one here, so maybe I just better quit and go home. It's just nice 
to ride such a good horse. He's still immature. We hope he'll keep getting 
better and better." 
</P>
<P>
This was also the first local win for Tate, 38, who met his wife while working 
in Billings, Mont. He trained at other small outposts before arriving in 
Northern California four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This is certainly a better place to win than Wyoming," said Tate, who trains 
Summer Sale for The Hat Ranch. "My wife doesn't ride for me all the time, but 
she really fits this horse. This is a real free-running horse who doesn't want 
to be taken a hold of. 
</P>
<P>
"He just wants to go and he gets real bold with her. Brenna gallops him every 
morning and really knows him. I have no idea what's next. You always look for 
the one big horse and this is my first big horse. I'll sit back, have a couple 
of drinks and I'll think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Favored Oraibi was third, a length back of Ofanto and a neck in front of Sunny 
Blossom, who showed the way through early fractions of :21 3/5 and :44. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Summer Sale paid $30.60 to win and the $51,000 payday boosted his earnings to 
$135,475. . . . Among others, General Store produced Double Discount, who holds 
the world record (1:57 2/5) for 1 1/4 miles on the turf. . . . When asked if 
she was older or younger than her husband, Brenna Hernandez would say only, 
"I'm lovelier." . . . The only other female jockey to win a stakes at Hollywood 
Park was P.J. Cooksey, who scored an upset on So Vague in the 1983 Hollywood 
Prevue. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the attention was focused on Hernandez, Russell Baze had four 
victories Saturday to take the lead in the jockey standings after four days. He 
won the first on 12-1 shot On Easy Street, the fourth aboard Afloat, the sixth 
on 11-1 outsider King Taufan and the seventh with another longshot, Secret 
Selection at 13-1. . . . Saratoga Chill, most impressive breaking her maiden by 
12 lengths in her first start at Oak Tree for Wayne Lukas, has a cracked coffin 
bone and will be sidelined for at least two months. . . . Ruhlmann, who hasn't 
been out since being blitzed by Rahy in the Bel Air Handicap last July, will 
return in the Citation Handicap at 1 1/8 miles on the turf a week from today.

Times handicapper Bob Mieszerski recorded a $79 profit Saturday when one of his 
$10 exacta boxes, Silver Hatchet and Best Picture in the third race hit for a 
$21.80 payoff for $2. The profit pushed Mieszerski back into the profit column. 
He started the meeting Wednesday with a mythical bankroll of $1,000 which now 
stands at $1,077. 
</P>
<P>
Each racing day Bob will make at least one bet. He could make a straight win 
bet, he could make a daily double bet, he could make an exacta bet, he could 
make other exotic bets, or any combination of bets. But, he will make at least 
one bet. 
</P>
<P>
For today, Bob's bets are $10 daily triples from Defend Your Man in the fourth

ROYAL BEATS ESPERANZA TO WALK OFF WITH TITLE 
</P>

It took a balanced attack, great serving, tough defense and about an hour for 
the Royal High girls' volleyball team to defeat Esperanza, 15-13, 15-4, 15-3, 
Saturday in the Southern Section 4-A Division final at Marina High. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the match, Royal (18-1) used a balanced attack with four players 
finishing with six kills or more. 
</P>
<P>
Wende Brown led Royal with nine kills and three blocks, Alison Bantel had eight 
kills and Jennifer Hamilton had six kills and four blocks. 
</P>
<P>
As swift and stunning as Royal's victory was, it came as little surprise to 
either side. Both had gotten to the final as unseeded teams. 
</P>
<P>
But the fact that Royal was unseeded is misleading. The Highlanders shared the 
Marmonte League championship with Thousand Oaks, which was the division's 
top-seeded team. "I'm not surprised we dominated tonight," said Royal Coach Bob 
Ferguson, whose team had advanced to the semifinals four of the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
"All the kids played so well. It's been like that for the past three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a good program," Ferguson said. "I think maybe some people found 
that out tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza, the Empire League champion, had had a surprisingly good year, 
dealing La Habra its only loss of the season -- the Highlanders won the 3-A 
championship Saturday -- and finishing second in the Orange County 
championships.

YEARS OF THE TIGERS; 
</P>
<P>
ANNIVERSARY: THE 75 SEASONS THAT SAN FERNANDO HIGH HAS BEEN PLAYING FOOTBALL 
ARE STEEPED IN TRADITION AND RICH WITH CHAMPIONSHIPS AND TALENTED PLAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Historians are fuzzy on the details, but sometime in 1914, the San Fernando 
High Board of Trustees bowed to community pressure and finally allowed the 
school to field a varsity football team. To say that the Tigers had humble 
beginnings is an understatement -- a 136-0 loss to Inglewood High didn't 
improve school spirit that first season -- but by the early '20s, the team was 
the scourge of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Wilbur (Ebbie) Elam was a 5-foot-7, 167-pound guard on San Fernando's unbeaten 
team in 1926 -- a team that did not allow a single point. "Nobody ever got 
inside our 20-yard line," says Elam, who today is believed to be the oldest 
living ex-San Fernando Tiger. "We were the first of the school's truly great 
teams." 
</P>
<P>
Now celebrating their 75th season, the Tigers have enjoyed a long tradition of 
success, winning 25 league titles and five City Section championships. Their 
1974 team -- featuring future Heisman Trophy winner Charles White -- is 
considered among the best ever in Southern California. This year, the Tigers 
posted a 5-5 regular-season record and made the playoffs for the 26th time. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always pressure to be successful at San Fernando," says Tom Hernandez, 
a starting guard on the 1974 City championship team and the Tigers' current 
coach. "The community and the students -- even the players -- expect to win." 
</P>
<P>
Like a lot of old grads Elam, San Fernando High Class of '28, still attends his 
alma mater's football games. With his daughter, a teacher at the school, he 
sits in the bleachers and remembers how it was when he played for the Tigers. 
The canvas pants and leather helmets. The single-wing. The average-size 
players. And he wonders: 
</P>
<P>
"Where the hell do all those big guys come from? So much has changed." 
</P>
<P>
And not only in football. The 75 seasons of Tiger football reflect broader 
changes in the Valley, from increased population to urbanization. The school, 
and the Tigers, have had to deal with these changes and adapt to them. Although 
the football team did suffer through a few down periods, its overall success -- 
a .600 winning percentage -- has been one of the only real constants at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
In the early years of Tiger football, San Fernando was an agricultural 
community and a railroad hub, the northernmost outpost of civilization in the 
Valley. It drew its students from a wide area extending from Canoga Park on the 
west, North Hollywood to the south and Burbank to the east. But there were only 
about 20,000 people in the Valley. Elam graduated in a class of 64, most of 
them white, he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
The '30s were marked by an influx of Latino and Japanese students at San 
Fernando. Not being big, the Japanese played mainly on the Tigers' B team. "Our 
B teams were good because they had a lot of 12th-grade Japanese players who 
were really tough," says Marvin Orland (Orlie) Schmidt, former Tiger player and 
the head coach for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
The end of World War II touched off a population boom in the Valley and 
radically altered the demographic mix. In the '50s and '60s, double sessions at 
the high school devastated the football team -- upperclassmen got off at noon 
and went to work, not practice. At the same time, new schools -- Poly, Monroe, 
Sylmar, Kennedy, Granada Hills -- were carved out of San Fernando territory. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like they built a new school every couple of years," says Schmidt, 
whose teams suffered through six consecutive losing seasons from 1955-60. "We'd 
get a bunch of 10th-graders going in football and then they'd move on, and then 
we'd get beat by kids we'd had." 
</P>
<P>
In the '50s, Schmidt recalls, defensive back Conrad Johnson was the first black 
player at San Fernando, but by the time the Tigers were winning back-to-back 
City titles in '74 and '75, the community's population was divided almost 
equally among blacks, whites and Latinos. Among City schools in the Valley, San 
Fernando High had the largest number of blacks, who were the stars of the 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, "the community is 85-90% Mexican and under 10% black," 
Hernandez says. Which affects the football team -- "We don't have as many skill 
kids as we used to have," he says -- and the balance of power in the Valley. 
"We used to be the only team with speed and team quickness. Now, because of 
busing, other schools have as much or more." 
</P>
<P>
But, Hernandez says, "We always seem to have enough kids at the skill positions 
to be a good football team." 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1896, San Fernando High is the oldest high school in the Valley, and 
the Tigers are believed to be the Valley's first varsity football team. Burbank 
High's varsity was thought to predate San Fernando by a couple of years, but 
Burbank High records indicate that the school didn't begin playing varsity 
football until 1919, five years after the Tigers. In their first season, the 
Tigers played "Burbank" twice, but the games probably were against the high 
school's club team. 
</P>
<P>
"Fields were dirt back then," says Bill Frazer, the Tigers' official historian. 
"I've heard that if you played a faster team, you'd water the dirt to slow them 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Frazer, with help from his wife Karen, compiled a 56-page football record book 
that came out before this season. It's just coincidence that the book 
commemorates 75 seasons of Tiger football: This would seem to be the 76th 
season. Digging through newspaper archives and old yearbooks, however, Frazer 
discovered that the Tigers -- along with probably all the other high school 
teams in L.A. -- didn't play in 1918 because of a worldwide flu epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
Frazer, who played football at San Fernando in the late '50s, has been a 
walk-on coach at the school since 1965, leaving his job at the Red Cross in the 
afternoons to help out at practice. He has his theories on why the Tigers have 
been so successful in football. 
</P>
<P>
"The program has continuity," he says. "A lot of the coaches were former 
players. Orlie Schmidt coached Bill Marsh who coached Tom Hernandez, and they 
all had relatives who played." 
</P>
<P>
Another reason given for the team's success is "the involvement of the 
community," Hernandez says. Despite changing demographics and homogenization of 
the Valley, San Fernando has retained a small-town identity and a dedication to 
the football team going back to the early days. When Elam and his brother Fred 
played in the mid-'20s, their father would close his service station to attend 
the Friday afternoon football game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of hard to find that involvement any more," Hernandez says, "but 
this is as close as you can get in the Valley. We get great crowds." 
</P>
<P>
Because so many ex-Tigers remain interested in San Fernando football, former 
Coach Phil Lozano founded the Football Alumni Assn. three years ago. It now has 
300 members. This year's reunion dinner will be held Dec. 5 at the Odyssey 
restaurant in Mission Hills. Schmidt's 1953 unbeaten city championship team 
will be inducted into the Tigers' Hall of Fame along with Ralph Bertell, a 
running back in the '30s. 
</P>
<P>
Previous inductees include Elam's 1926 team and the 1937 team that won what was 
then the minor school City title. But conspicuously absent from the hall are 
such stars as Charles White and Anthony Davis, who played in 1968-70 and still 
holds the school single-season and career rushing records. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to honor the older players first," Lozano says, "because they're 
either passed away or will be passed away." 
</P>
<P>
Lozano, who went to Franklin High, was head coach of the Tigers for three 
seasons in the mid-'60s, posting a 22-7 record, and is now assistant dean of 
student services at Mission College. He worries that when he retires in two or 
three years, nobody will step forward to take over the alumni association. 
</P>
<P>
"Seventy-five seasons is a tremendous legacy," he says. "We want to perpetuate 
it."

SERRA WINS PLAYOFF GAME, FLIP FOR HOME-FIELD EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Thanksgiving came early for Serra High's football team Saturday morning, as the 
Cavaliers won a coin flip to earn the home field for Friday's second-round CIF 
Division VII playoff game against Arroyo Grande. 
</P>
<P>
It spares Serra from having to make a three-hour bus trip to Arroyo Grande, 
located near Pismo Beach in San Luis Obispo County. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole school was praying we would win the flip," assistant coach Joe 
Griffin said. "Having the home field will help us." 
</P>
<P>
The second-seeded Cavaliers (11-0) opened the playoffs Friday night with a 
hard-fought 18-0 win over visiting Morningside, which gave Serra all it could 
handle with an aggressive defense. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a fine team," Griffin said. "They have the same kind of speed, size 
and quickness that we do. They had a very strong defense. They alternated 
between an eight- and nine-man front the whole night." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside's tactics resulted in the lowest offensive output of the season for 
Serra. The Cavaliers, who averaged 40 points a game in the first 10 weeks, 
managed only one offensive touchdown and had to rely on its defense, which has 
now posted four shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense is really the unsung hero of the team," Griffin said. "Our offense 
has gotten so much press, but this is a fine defense." 
</P>
<P>
Free safety Clayton Lopez enjoyed one of his best games. He returned a fumble 
30 yards for a touchdown, made his eighth interception and came up several 
times to deliver key tackles. Inside linebacker Steven Johnson was singled out 
for his play as well. 
</P>
<P>
However, Griffin felt it was far from Serra's best effort on offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a little lethargic," he said. "It was probably our second-worst game 
of the year. But I can't take anything away from Morningside. They played us so 
tough. I think that frustrated our kids." 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo Grande (8-3), the second-place team from the Northern League, posted a 
20-3 playoff win over La Canada. 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance, the South Bay's other survivor in the Division VII playoffs, 
lost a coin flip and will travel Friday to face Temple City in a second-round 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded West (10-1) cruised to its 10th straight victory Friday over 
Harvard, 29-9, behind the all-around play of running back/defensive back Josh 
Moore, who rushed for 125 yards and two touchdowns and intercepted his seventh 
and eighth passes of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, Serra's Lopez and Mark Antrobius of Palos Verdes are tied for the South 
Bay lead with eight interceptions apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Hondo League champion Temple City (8-3) figures to provide West with its 
toughest challenge of the season. The Rams are traditionally one of the 
Southern Section's top teams, and Friday they overpowered St. Bernard, 29-0. 
</P>
<P>
Temple City reached the semifinals last season, including a 49-6 win over 
Serra. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger prevented the Bay League from being swept from the playoffs by 
hanging on to defeat Buena High of Ventura, 10-6, in a Division II opener at 
Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Olympians (8-2-1) were on the road in the first round, they get the 
home game Friday against top-seeded Thousand Oaks (10-0-1), which advanced with 
33-6 victory over Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Third-string tailback Vernel Williams, pressed into action because of knee 
injuries to Leuzinger's top two backs, scored the game-winning touchdown on a 
56-yard run in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The final period wasn't as kind to Bay League co-champions Palos Verdes and 
Hawthorne. Two Palos Verdes turnovers in the fourth quarter led to two 
touchdowns by Newbury Park in its 19-9 win, and a 79-yard scoring run by 
tailback Mike Castelo with 2:23 left to play lifted San Marcos of Santa Barbara 
past Hawthorne, 33-26. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay League's other playoff representative, fourth-place Santa Monica, was 
destroyed by Canyon of Canyon Country, 70-20. The Cowboys (7-3-1), who led 49-7 
at halftime, rushed for 362 yards and five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne had an equally difficult time stopping San Marcos' Castelo. The 
5-foot-10, 170-pound junior rushed for 266 yards and three touchdowns on 25 
carries as the Royals (6-5) won their fifth straight game. They finished with 
274 yards rushing against a Cougar defense that was weakened by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Inside linebacker Sione Mahe, Hawthorne's leading tackler, played with a 
sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
"The backbone of our defense has been Sione Mahe, and he was hobbling out there 
and couldn't play with his full capabilities," said Hawthorne Coach Goy 
Casillas, adding that Mahe did not fill the gap off right tackle quick enough 
on Castelo's winning touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a stunt called; it was the perfect call for it," Casillas said. "We 
just didn't get there in time." 
</P>
<P>
The defensive lapse negated a furious comeback by Hawthorne, which rallied from 
a 25-6 deficit with 3:14 left in the third quarter to take a 26-25 lead on a 
20-yard touchdown run by quarterback Jamil Williams with 3:06 left in the game. 
Tailback Chris Alexander sparked the comeback with 99-yard kick return for a 
touchdown and catches of 34 and 39 yards to help set up the two other scores. 
</P>
<P>
Banning will play a 16-play California tie-breaker Monday against Crenshaw to 
determine the third and final L.A. City 4-A playoff entry from the Pacific 
League. Starting time is 2:30 p.m. at L.A. Southwest College. 
</P>
<P>
The teams each finished with 4-3 conference records Friday, as Banning lost to 
Dorsey, 18-10, and Crenshaw fell to Carson, 39-12. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how the tie-breaker works, according to Banning Coach Joe Dominguez: The 
ball is placed at midfield and each team runs eight plays, alternating 
possession after each play. The team that moves the ball the farthest at the 
completion of 16 plays is declared the winner. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's kind of crazy," Dominguez said. "I've never been involved with 
anything like this before." 
</P>
<P>
Banning (6-3-1) lost to Crenshaw, 20-18, two weeks ago when Kevin Hicks ran 
back a punt 79 yards for a touchdown with 4:37 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no special teams involved in the tie-breaker, so maybe we'll do OK," 
Dominguez said. "But he's a good athlete, no doubt." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez hopes Banning quarterback John Ma'ae and tailback Travis Davis will 
be ready Monday. Ma'ae saw limited action Friday because of a knee injury and 
Davis missed the game with a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the tie-breaker has one day to prepare for the City playoffs, 
which begin Wednesday because of the Thanksgiving holiday. 
</P>
<P>
In a showdown for the Western League title, Venice scored a touchdown on a 
two-yard run and followed it with a two-point conversion with 13 seconds left 
to come away with a 29-27 homecoming victory over Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
The decision means that Venice (10-0) will open the L.A. City 3-A playoffs with 
a home game Wednesday, while Westchester (8-2) must travel. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester was dealt a blow with 10:21 left when tailback Tim Holliday, who 
rushed for 274 yards and two touchdowns on 16 carries, left the game with a leg 
injury and did not return. He is questionable for Wednesday's game.

CSUN'S ARREOLA REVELS IN FULFILLING WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MARSHALLS CREEK, Pa. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She is one of the nation's top middle-distance runners, but Darcy Arreola of 
Cal State Northridge didn't consider herself a complete runner until her 
victory Saturday in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division II 
cross-country championships. 
</P>
<P>
Although Arreola had won three Division II titles in track, competed in the 
1988 Olympic Trials in the 1,500 meters and placed third in that event in this 
year's Division I meet, she never took cross-country that seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola's attitude adjustment was completed Saturday, however, as she surged 
away from Jill Wood of the Air Force Academy in the final 250 meters to win the 
5,000-meter race in 17 minutes, 14.2 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"I've really had a great time running this season." Arreola said. "I've enjoyed 
it more than ever. I never really enjoyed cross-country that much, but I 
learned to like it this year. It's a tough sport, but I like that it's tough. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to hate running hills, but I've learned to like it this season." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola's victory -- the first Division II cross-country title by a Northridge 
woman -- propelled the Lady Matadors to a surprising fourth-place finish in the 
team standings. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo -- led by freshman Jamie Park's third-place finish -- 
placed six runners among the top 14 to score 34 points and easily win its 
eighth consecutive women's title. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force (67 points), South Dakota State (108), Northridge (121) and the Naval 
Academy (141) rounded out the top five. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge placed fifth in the men's race, powered by the All-American 
performances of sophomore Sasha Vujic (eighth) and junior Jorge Castro (11th). 
</P>
<P>
South Dakota State defeated three-time defending champion Edinboro University, 
97-102, for the team title. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo placed third with 114 points, followed by UC Riverside (139), 
Northridge (164) and Humboldt State (192). 
</P>
<P>
The top 25 U. S. citizens in each race earned All-American honors, and for only 
the second time, Northridge had three women who accomplished the feat in the 
same year; sophomore Kelly Tremmel finished 15th in 18:12.0 and senior Gena 
Jauregui placed 25th in 18:26.7. 
</P>
<P>
"The women really came through," Northridge Coach Don Strametz said. 
"Especially considering the circumstances with Darcy." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, who placed 11th in the 1986 Division II meet and was fifth in '87 
before redshirting last season, was unable to jog the course Friday when a 
recurring tendon injury in her foot flared up. 
</P>
<P>
Strametz was worried that Arreola might not be able to race, but Arreola was 
more confident. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to run no matter what," Arreola said. "There was no way I was 
going to come this far -- and work this hard -- and not run." 
</P>
<P>
Knowing that her sprinting speed was better than Wood's, Arreola ran behind the 
senior for most of the race before pulling away in the final stages. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Megan Warner (54th in 19:09.6) and freshman Laura Doering (59th in 
19:15.4) rounded out the Lady Matadors' scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Although the CSUN men's team was ranked third, Strametz was pleased with its 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way we're going to place higher than that is for our third, fourth 
and fifth men to run faster," Strametz said. "They didn't run badly, but you 
can't ask for better races from Sasha and (Castro) . . . (Castro) ran the 
smartest tactical race I've ever seen him run. He did exactly what we told him 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
A Division II All-American as a freshman (26th) in 1987, Castro had a 
disappointing sophomore season but rebounded with a vengeance this season. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth and sixth at the two-mile mark, Vujic and Castro faded slightly in the 
next three miles before coming on strongly in the final mile. 
</P>
<P>
Vujic, 10th with 400 meters left, pulled away from Uriel Rivera of Edinboro and 
Tim Campbell of San Luis Obispo in the final straight to clock 32:21.1 over the 
10,000-meter course. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally used my kick," Vujic said. "I really wanted a plaque (top 15), so 
there was no way they were going to get away from me." 
</P>
<P>
Castro finished 11th in 32:30.3, and former Kennedy High standout Hebert 
Saravia of UC Riverside swooped past several runners in the final meters to 
place 12th in 32:31.6. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Jeff Gilkey (38th in 33:17.7), junior Derik Vett (64th in 33:53.3), 
and freshman Richard Gitahi (81st in 34:17.0) rounded out the Northridge 
scoring.

HARVARD FALLS IN WATER POLO SEMIFINAL, 13-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By STEVEN HERBERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harvard High's hopes for a third consecutive trip to the Southern Section water 
polo final came to a quick end Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded El Toro scored on its first three shots en route to a decisive 13-3 
win over the fourth-seeded Saracens in a 3-A Division semifinal game at Santa 
Monica High. The win puts the defending 3-A champions into Wednesday's title 
game against Capistrano Valley, a 7-6 winner over Marina in the other 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't play well at all," Harvard Coach Rich Corso said. "This was an 
old-fashioned butt kicking. We were tentative the first 14 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
El Toro Coach Don Stoll instructed his team to put early pressure on Harvard 
All-American goalie Larry Bercutt. 
</P>
<P>
While El Toro was shooting bullets at Bercutt, the Saracens weren't even firing 
blanks at Charger goalie Eric Terwilliger. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't even take a shot until the end of the second quarter," Corso said. 
"We just weren't aggressive enough." 
</P>
<P>
El Toro (25-5) built a 6-0 lead before Hasan Yardimci got Harvard (27-5) on the 
scoreboard 55 seconds before halftime. But any thoughts of a comeback were 
dashed in the third quarter as the Chargers scored four unanswered goals.

PALOS VERDES GIRLS WIN 5TH CONSECUTIVE CROSS-COUNTRY TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG GONZALEZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palos Verdes girls' cross-country team ran into the golden-brown hills of 
Mt. San Antonio College on Saturday and came back with the Sea Kings' fifth 
consecutive Southern Section 4-A championship. 
</P>
<P>
The hot weather seemed to bother only the spectators as Palos Verdes runners 
Maya Muneno and Tami Wilcox led their team to five of the top 17 places. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes scored 51 points to second-place Buena's 72. 
</P>
<P>
Muneno led the Sea Kings by finishing seventh with a time of 18:54 for the 
three-mile course. Wilcox, a freshman, was also timed in 18:54 and finished 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox, who was in the fifth grade when the Palos Verdes streak began, said the 
strategy was simple: "We just tried to beat people." 
</P>
<P>
Sea Kings Coach Joe Kelly said the five championships are a tribute to each 
individual team. "The only thing that's important is this year," he said. "The 
girls running today weren't around a couple of years ago. Now they are part of 
our tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes travels to Fresno next Saturday to compete in the state meet, 
where the Sea Kings have won two consecutive Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
Also bound for the state meet is Torrance's Israel Pose, who led the Tartars to 
an eighth-place finish in the boys' 4-A division. 
</P>
<P>
Pose ran a personal best for the Mt. SAC course, finishing fourth overall in 
15:19, but the real surprise was his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody ran 30 seconds ahead of their prelim time," Torrance Coach Jerry 
Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
In the City finals at Pierce College on Saturday, Carson's Steven Gonzales and 
Banning's Roman Rendon finished third and sixth to qualify for the state meet. 
Gonzales ran 15:30 and Rendon 15:55 for three miles. San Fernando's Obed 
Aguiree won in 15:16. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro's Lucy Diaz came in ninth with 20:20 to lead the Pirates to a 
surprising second-place finish in the girls' division that qualified them for 
the state meet.

BAKERSFIELD TAKES WSC SOUTHERN DIVISION TITLE BY BEATING VALLEY, 36-10

Fried. Baked. Boiled. Bakersfield College isn't choosy. 
</P>
<P>
The Renegades will take their potatoes any way they can get them. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday at Valley College, the Renegades took their potatoes in a bowl -- as 
in Potato Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield, playing near error-free football, defeated Valley, 36-10, to win 
the Western State Conference Southern Division championship. The Renegades 
(8-0-2, 7-0-2 in the conference, 5-0 in the division), unbeaten in two years, 
have accepted an invitation to play in the Potato Bowl in Bakersfield, probably 
against Taft. 
</P>
<P>
And Valley? The Monarchs (5-5, 5-4, 4-1), Southern Division runners-up, will 
accept an invitation to the Western State Conference Bowl, most likely meeting 
WSC Northern Division runner-up Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Against Bakersfield, Valley had all the ingredients of a loser -- four 
turnovers, a blocked punt and 112 penalty yards. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Coach Chuck Ferrero was so frustrated by the turn of events that he was 
flagged in the fourth period for unsportsmanlike conduct when he persisted in 
berating an official. 
</P>
<P>
"The blocked punt and the interception return for a touchdown -- you can't do 
that . . . against a good football team," Ferrero said. 
</P>
<P>
The interception return Ferrero spoke of was a 61-yard, third-period jaunt by 
Ty Bowden with an errant Trendell Williams pass. Coming as it did after Valley 
had cut Bakersfield's lead to 22-10 on Louis Melancon's eight-yard touchdown 
run with a blocked punt, Bowden's touchdown effectively ended any thoughts of a 
Monarch victory. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who dislocated his left shoulder last week against Santa Monica, 
relieved starter Mark Mengoni in the third period and completed seven of 14 
passes for 104 yards. JIM COLEMAN

Glendale 28, Ventura 14: John Cicuto's first season as head coach of the 
Glendale football team ended on a positive note as his recently struggling 
Vaqueros knocked off Ventura, 28-14, in a WSC game at Glendale High. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach has been telling us all season, 'Play every game like it's your last,' " 
Glendale quarterback Ronnie Lopez said. "But we didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the last game came, we did." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (5-4-1, 5-3-1) beat a Ventura team that began the season 7-0, but lost 
its last three games to finish 7-3 overall and 6-3 in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's defense played an inspired game, limiting the Pirates to just 30 
yards passing and 178 yards of total offense. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore running back Sean Hampton rushed for a game-high 97 yards in 14 
carries and scored two touchdowns to lead Glendale, which rolled up 440 yards." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a relief to win because we knew we could do it all season," Hampton said. 
"There's a lot of pressure to win because of the school's tradition. We finally 
came together. That's a good way for all the sophomores to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale, which had surrendered 52 first-quarter points during losses to 
Moorpark and Santa Barbara the past two weeks, beat Ventura by overcoming a 
14-0 first-quarter deficit that resulted from two Vaquero turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale closed the lead to 14-10 at halftime on a 24-yard field goal by David 
Bowen and Hampton's six-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Bowen's 27-yard field goal in the third quarter brought Glendale to within 
14-13 before the Vaqueros scored what proved to be the game-winning touchdown 
on a 32-yard pass from Lopez to wide receiver Danny Perez with 1:50 left in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Hampton scored Glendale's final touchdown when he raced 18 yards with 5:02 
left. GARY KLEIN

Although La Jolla has appeared in the San Diego Section 2-A or Division II 
final volleyball finals for the past eight years, the pendulum has swung more 
in favor of USDHS lately. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla won four consecutive titles from 1982-85 but has now lost to the Dons 
in the past four championship matches, including a 15-11, 8-15, 15-5, 15-11 
decision Saturday at San Pasqual High School. 
</P>
<P>
All three defending champions -- USDHS, Poway in Division I and Francis Parker 
in Division III -- won in the tripleheader of section title matches. 
</P>
<P>
"La Jolla's much improved by this match," USDHS Coach Rob Gorney said. "But we 
were really up for them. I thought our attack and our defense were strong." 
</P>
<P>
Both schools are representatives of the Western League. Second-seeded La 
Jolla's only two losses in the league were to top-seeded USDHS, both in four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a wonder La Jolla (18-2) even got this far, what with a graduation 
toll of nine starters and with three starting sophomores. La Jolla defeated 
previously unbeaten Escondido in three games in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bit of a consolation," said La Jolla Coach Vicki Eveleth, "but any time 
you get this far and lose, it's tough." 
</P>
<P>
Junior Michelle Rico had 23 kills and senior Amy Siedlinger had 13 kills and 
seven blocked shots to lead USDHS (19-2). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Division I 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Poway (19-0), ranked fourth in the state, defeated second-seeded 
Palomar League rival Torrey Pines, 16-14, 15-7, 15-8, for its fifth section 
title in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Poway and Torrey Pines, ranked ninth in the state, was the 
third this season. The Titans won the first two in four games. 
</P>
<P>
"This time it was just three," Poway Coach Lisa Reis said. "The only way they 
could have lost is if they had laid down and died." 
</P>
<P>
They did no such thing. In a somewhat shaky first game, where the lead changed 
six times, Poway pulled out the two-point victory, then got down to business in 
the second game. The closest the Falcons came was 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
"Their level just rose," Torrey Pines Coach Jim Harrah said. "We didn't let 
down. We just let it get away from us in the second game." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans were down, 8-3, in the third game, but Poway's front line kept 
pounding shots deep into Torrey Pines back court, and the Titans won the next 
12 points and the match. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Christy Fortney said this games marks the end of a season and a 
beginning of a new one for Poway, which will begin play in the Southern 
California Regionals Tuesday. (Seedings and sites will be announced today.) 
</P>
<P>
"This was our biggest game," she said, "but this is when our season starts." 
</P>
<P>
Even a first round victory would be a milestone. No Division I or II team from 
San Diego has ever gotten past the first round in the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Division I 
</P>
<P>
1-A Championship 
</P>
<P>
Three-time defending state and four-time defending section 1-A/Division III 
Francis Parker defeated Christian, 15-2, 15-11, 15-13. Mary Burt had 12 kills, 
and Juli Cheskaty added eight. 
</P>
<P>
First-year Coach Doug Huffman said there was pressure in inheriting a program 
with such success, but having four returning players with state playoff 
experience helped.

CORONADO GOALIE SURFACES TO DEFEAT POWAY FOR TITLE

Coronado High water polo coach Randy Burgess said he'd been waiting for his 
junior goalie, Jack Bowen, to have a game of the spectacular variety for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Burgess' wait ended Saturday night as Bowen put on a rejection show Mark Eaton 
would have proud of in Coronado's 13-8 victory over Poway in the San Diego 
Section title game at the Jewish Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
Bowen personally turned back any hopes Poway had of dethroning the two-time 
champs by holding the Titans scoreless with four fourth-quarter saves. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just an incredible player," said Bowen's teammate Pat Mitchell, who 
scored three third-period goals. "What you saw in the second half was the Jack 
Bowen show." 
</P>
<P>
The show's highlight came with three minutes remaining in the game and Coronado 
ahead, 12-8. With Bowen one-one with Poway junior Chad Aronen at point-blank 
range, Bowen leaped up out of the water and swatted away Aronen's rifle shot. 
</P>
<P>
"That was leg strength," Bowen said. "That's what lifting in the summer is all 
about. I visualized those kind of blocks in my room last night when I was 
listening to music." 
</P>
<P>
The music stopped for Poway (22-3) after they grabbed a 7-5 lead early in the 
third period. After the Titans led, they continually self-destructed with 
turnovers and missed opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
And while Poway was self-destructing, Coronado (23-3) was taking advantage of 
nearly every scoring opportunity it had. After trailing 7-5, Poway scored four 
consecutive goals, including long-range bullets from Mitchell and Chris Cote. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not concerned when we fell behind," Burgess said. "Everybody was in good 
condition and we stayed with our game plan."

LEARNING THE LESSONS OF A DYING EARTH: FUTURE'S NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL McKIBBEN, Bill McKibben has written hundreds of articles for New Yorker 
magazine. He also has written on nature for the New York Review of Books, the 
New York Times and other national publications. He and his wife live in the 
Adirondack mountains of New York. This series is excerpted from his new book, 
The End of Nature (Random House). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nature, we believe, takes forever, moving with infinite slowness through the 
many periods of its history, whose names we dimly recall from high school 
biology -- the Devonian, the Triassic, the Cretaceous, the Pleistocene. Ever 
since Darwin, nature writers have taken pains to stress the incomprehensible 
length of this path. 
</P>
<P>
We have been told that man's tenure is as a minute to the Earth's day, but it 
is that vast day which has lodged in our minds. The age of the trilobites began 
some 600 million years ago. The dinosaurs lived for nearly 140 million years. 
Since even a million years is utterly unfathomable, the message is: Nothing 
happens quickly. Change takes unimaginable -- "geologic" -- time. 
</P>
<P>
This idea about time is essentially mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
Our reassuring sense of a timeless future, which is drawn from that apparently 
bottomless well of the past, is a delusion. 
</P>
<P>
True, evolution, grinding on ever so slowly, has taken billions of years to 
create us from slime, but that does not mean that time always moves so 
ponderously. Events, enormous events, can happen quickly. We've known this to 
be true since Hiroshima, of course, but I don't mean that quickly. I mean that 
over a year or a decade or a lifetime big and impersonal and dramatic changes 
can take place. We're now comfortable with the bizarre idea that continents can 
die in an atomic second; even so, normal time seems to us immune from such huge 
changes. It isn't, though. 
</P>
<P>
In the past three decades, for example, the amount of carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere has increased more than 10%, from about 315 to about 350 parts per 
million. In the past decade, an immense "hole" in the ozone layer has opened 
above the South Pole. In the past half-decade, the percentage of West German 
forests damaged by acid rain has risen from less than 10% to more than 50%. 
According to the Worldwatch Institute, in 1988 -- for perhaps the first time 
since that starved Pilgrim winter at Plymouth -- America ate more food than it 
grew. 
</P>
<P>
In much the same comforting way that we think of time as imponderably long, we 
consider the Earth to be inconceivably large. From my house to the post office 
at the end of the road is a trip of 6 1/2 miles. On a bicycle, it takes about 
25 minutes, in a car eight or nine. I've walked it in an hour and a half. 
</P>
<P>
If you turned that trip on its end, the 25-minute pedal past Bateman's sand pit 
and the graveyard and the waterfall and Allen Hill would take me a mile beyond 
the height of Mt. Everest, past the point where the air is too thin to breathe 
without artificial assistance. Into that tight space, and the layer of ozone 
just above it, is crammed all that is life and all that maintains life. 
</P>
<P>
This, I realize, is a far from novel observation. I repeat it only to make the 
same case I made with regard to time. The world is not so large as we 
intuitively believe. Space can be as short as time. For instance, the average 
American car driven the average American distance -- 10,000 miles -- in an 
average American year releases its own weight in carbon into the atmosphere. 
Imagine each car on a busy freeway pumping a ton of carbon into the atmosphere, 
and the sky seems less infinitely blue. 
</P>
<P>
Along with our optimistic perceptions of time and space, some comparatively 
minor misunderstandings distort our sense of the world. Consider the American 
failure to convert to the metric system. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, if I read that there will be an 0.8 degree Celsius rise in the 
temperature between now and the year 2000, it sounds less ominous than a 
degree-and-a-half Fahrenheit. Similarly, a 90-centimeter rise in sea levels 
sounds less ominous until one stops to think that over a beach with a normal 
slope such a rise would bring the ocean 90 meters (that's 295 feet) above its 
current tide line. In somewhat the same way, the logarithmic scale that we use 
to determine the overall composition of our soils or waters -- pH -- distorts 
reality like a fun-house mirror for anyone who doesn't use it on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, normal rainwater has a pH of 5.6. But the acidified rain that 
falls on Buck Hill behind my house has a pH between 4.6 and 4.2 -- that is, it 
is 10 to 40 times as acid as normal. 
</P>
<P>
Of all such quirks, though, the most ephemeral may be the most significant. It 
is an accident of the calendar: We live too close to the year 2000. Forever we 
have read about the year 2000. It has become a symbol of the bright and distant 
future, when we will ride in air cars and talk on video phones. The year 2010 
still sounds far off, almost unreachably far off, as though it were on the 
other side of a great body of water. 
</P>
<P>
If someone says to me that a very bad thing will happen in 2010, I may feign 
concern but subconsciously file it away. So it always shocks me when I realize 
that 2010 is almost as close as 1970 -- closer than the breakup of the Beatles 
-- and that the turn of the century is no further in front of us than Ronald 
Reagan's election to the Presidency is behind. We live in the shadow of a 
number, and that makes it hard for us to see the future. 
</P>
<P>
Our comforting sense of the permanence of our natural world, our confidence 
that it will change gradually and imperceptibly if at all, is, then, the result 
of a subtly warped perspective. Changes that can affect us can happen in our 
lifetime in our world -- not just changes like wars but bigger and more 
sweeping events. I believe that without recognizing it we have already stepped 
over the threshold of such a change: that we are at the end of nature. Not that 
it could happen, but that it has. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of nature, I do not mean the end of the world. The rain will still 
fall and the sun shine, though differently than before. When I say "nature," I 
mean a certain set of human ideas about the world and our place in it. But the 
death of those ideas begins with concrete changes in the reality around us, 
changes that scientists can measure and enumerate. More and more frequently, 
these changes will clash with our perceptions, until, finally, our sense of 
nature as eternal and separate is washed away, and we will see all too clearly 
what we have done. 
</P>
<P>
Over the Earth's history, great amounts of carbon dioxide have been chemically 
transformed into calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate and organic matter. And 
almost all of this has been buried in sediments deep beneath the sea. There is 
about 100,000 times as much carbon dioxide buried beneath the ocean as in the 
atmosphere. When we drill into an oil field, we tap into a vast reservoir of 
this organic matter. We unbury it. When we burn that oil (or coal or natural 
gas) we release its carbon into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. 
This is not pollution in the normal sense of the word. 
</P>
<P>
Carbon monoxide is "pollution," an unnecessary by-product. A clean-burning 
engine releases less of it, but when it comes to carbon dioxide, a 
clean-burning engine is no better than the motor on a Model T. It will emit 
about 5.6 pounds of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide for every gallon of 
gasoline it consumes. In the course of about a hundred years, our various 
engines and fires have released a substantial amount of the carbon that has 
been buried over time. It is as if someone had scrimped and saved his entire 
life, and then spent every cent on one fantastic week's debauch. 
</P>
<P>
We are living on our capital, as we began to realize during the gas crises of 
the 1970s. But it is more than waste, more than a binge. We are spending that 
capital in such a way as to alter the atmosphere. It is like taking that week's 
fling and, in the process, contracting a horrid disease. 
</P>
<P>
There has always been, at least since the start of life, a certain amount of 
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and it has always trapped a certain amount of 
sunlight to warm the Earth. If there were no carbon dioxide, our world might 
resemble Mars. It would probably be so cold as to be lifeless. A little bit of 
greenhouse is a good thing, then -- the plant that is life thrives in its 
warmth. The question is: How much? 
</P>
<P>
On Venus, the atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide. As a result, it traps infrared 
radiation a hundred times more efficiently than the Earth's atmosphere, and 
keeps the planet a toasty 700 degrees warmer than the Earth. The Earth's 
atmosphere is mostly nitrogen and oxygen; there's currently only about .035% to 
.055% or .06%, which is not very much. But plenty, it turns out, to make 
everything different. 
</P>
<P>
Carbon dioxide at a very low level largely determines the climate; carbon 
dioxide at double that very low level, even if it's still small in absolute 
terms, could have enormous effect. It's like misreading a recipe and baking 
bread for two hours instead of one: It matters. 
</P>
<P>
The world's population has more than tripled in this century, and, according to 
United Nations statistics released in May, 1989, is expected to double and 
perhaps nearly triple again before reaching a plateau in the next century. And 
the tripled population has not contented itself with using only three times the 
resources. In the past century, industrial production has grown fifty-fold. 
Four-fifths of that growth has come since 1950, and almost all of it, of 
course, has been based on fossil fuels. And in the next half century, the 
United Nations predicts, this $13 trillion economy will grow another five to 10 
times larger. 
</P>
<P>
These physical facts are almost as stubborn as the chemistry of infrared 
absorption. They mean that the world will use more energy -- between 2% and 3% 
more each year by most estimates. And the largest increases may come in the use 
of coal. 
</P>
<P>
That is bad news, since coal spews more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than 
any other sort of energy (twice as much as natural gas, for instance). China, 
which has the world's largest coal reserves and recently surpassed the Soviet 
Union as the world's largest coal producer, has plans to almost double her coal 
consumption by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, this is not something that has been happening for a long time. 
It is not a marathon or the 24 hours of Le Mans. It's a 100-yard dash, a drag 
race, getting faster all the time. If energy use and other contributions to 
carbon dioxide levels continue to grow exponentially, a model devised by the 
World Resources Institute predicts that, by about 2040, carbon dioxide levels 
will have doubled what they were before the Industrial Revolution. If they grow 
somewhat more slowly, as most estimates predict, the level would double 
sometime around 2070. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the solutions are neither obvious nor easy. For example, 
installing some sort of scrubber on a power-plant smokestack to get rid of the 
carbon dioxide would seem an obvious fix. But a system that removed 90% of the 
carbon dioxide would also reduce the effective capacity of the plant 80%. 
</P>
<P>
Because so much of our energy use is for things like automobile fuel, if all 
the electricity in the United States were generated in nuclear power plants, 
according to William Moomaw of the World Resources Institute, our carbon 
dioxide emissions would fall by about 9%. Ditto, at least initially, for cold 
fusion or hot fusion or any other clean method of producing electricity. So the 
sacrifices demanded may be on a scale we can't imagine and won't like.

FORMER SURGEON GENERAL'S NEW SHINGLE COULD READ: 'AMERICA'S FAMILY DOCTOR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In uniform, in federal service, C. Everett Koop was a bearded bear in shoulder 
boards and braid. 
</P>
<P>
In retirement, Koop wears two-piece suits and oversized bow ties and lapel 
pins, and they make the man appear smaller, less forbidding. 
</P>
<P>
In his transition from title to person, home is no longer red-brick government 
quarters. Koop, like ordinary folk, has a new, huge mortgage on a small house 
in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
The beard stays. It never has been a statement of Amish beliefs, as often 
suggested, because Koop is Presbyterian. He grew the beard years ago to 
camouflage multiple chins. How many? "Triple chins," he admits. "But I haven't 
looked lately. I'm not sure I can feel them anymore." 
</P>
<P>
As surgeon general and leader of the 7,000-member Public Health Service, C. 
Everett Koop preached high health and balanced diet. As civilian practice, 
Chick Koop eats marbled steaks, likes his martinis dry and his macadamia nuts 
dipped in Cool Whip. 
</P>
<P>
"Darn good genes," Koop explains. "My cholesterol level is right on the border 
between normal and abnormal, but what you probably don't know and the country 
doesn't know, is that . . . at the age of 73, it doesn't matter what my 
cholesterol level is as far as predicting my heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the worst thing about the cholesterol effort in this country is that 
it has frightened about 30 million (senior) people that don't have to be 
frightened at all." 
</P>
<P>
So the Koop candor hasn't surrendered, the insights aren't retired and the mind 
remains open for his new business -- as America's family doctor. Or Dutch 
uncle. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be seen as an opinion maker," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Koop was in California recently making those opinions for audiences in San 
Diego, San Francisco and Los Angeles and to those "wanting to know what I 
thought because of who I was, rather than the title I used to have. 
</P>
<P>
"So I am very pleased to see news reports, headlines and magazine things 
talking about C. Everett Koop and not talking about the former surgeon 
general." 
</P>
<P>
Koop is writing his memoirs. He will be host of five prime-time television 
health specials for NBC and produce videotapes that may do for individual 
health habits what Jane Fonda has done for thighs. 
</P>
<P>
He was in Paris last week to receive an anti-smoking award and warn Europeans 
about their tobacco problems. He continues to visit AIDS patients in hospices, 
to lecture students in universities and offer free advice to the curious who 
still allow him no privacy in waiting rooms, on airplanes or riding the New 
York subway. 
</P>
<P>
And for the first time since leaving his federal post in July, Koop is talking 
to the media -- but only to interviewers selected by the Beverly Hills agent he 
now shares with Gerald and Betty Ford, Donald Regan, Alexander Haig and Bill 
Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to be very careful not to be overexposed," he said. "If I accepted what 
is offered, with radio and with television, you would see me every day and I 
don't think I could last six months. 
</P>
<P>
"I am approaching the limit of what people can take in the way of 'don't.' You 
must remember that all my messages begin: 'Don't.' " 
</P>
<P>
In this new life, there might even be a bluffer, tougher Koop. He always was 
direct. But in government service, he said, "there is a kind of an in-built, 
inborn restraint. I don't do that (government service) anymore. I can be as 
outspoken as I wish." 
</P>
<P>
So here is Koop on abortion, a procedure he adamantly opposes: "I'm absolutely 
disgusted with the rhetoric and the bashing that one side does against the 
other. I think they have both forgotten, in a sense, what their first love 
was." 
</P>
<P>
On the lighter side, on Betty, the woman he married 51 years ago: "My wife is 
the world's greatest non-accumulator of worldly goods. She should have been a 
nun." 
</P>
<P>
On smoking, from a man who quit his comfortable pipes 15 years ago: "I am 
making a plea for the European Common Market to fight smoking as a continent 
and not piecemeal as countries." 
</P>
<P>
Of his conflicting images as blusterer and humanitarian, as moral dictator and 
compassionate healer: "I'm all the good things." 
</P>
<P>
On AIDS: "Everything that turns up confirms heterosexual spread, numerically 
and geographically . . . most recent estimates are that there will be, in the 
year 2000, a hundred million people who are HIV positive." 
</P>
<P>
On the media that took years to warm to Koop: "I view the line between 
veneration and ridicule that the press can give you as a very narrow knife 
edge." 
</P>
<P>
On the past eight years when he became the most visible, the most controversial 
and, say even former detractors, the most effective surgeon general in the 
119-year history of the Public Health Service: "I'm bloodied and scarred. 
</P>
<P>
"But the veneer of approval and accolades has really removed any sense of 
bitterness I had about those first nine months (of nomination hearings). For 
the entire second Reagan term, really since October, 1986, when I put out the 
AIDS report, the acceptance and the appreciation that seems to come from the 
public has been very gratifying." 
</P>
<P>
And on the Holiday Inn in Torrance where he stayed before speaking to the South 
Bay Center for the Arts at El Camino College: "They actually put me in a 
smoking room." 
</P>
<P>
Had things gone a little differently 10 months ago, Koop might very well have 
rated the presidential suite wherever he stayed. 
</P>
<P>
His second term was nearing its end and not even a personal appeal from 
President Bush would have persuaded him to remain in office. 
</P>
<P>
"As surgeon general I had done it," he remembered. "I was still to some people 
a new voice but in another year, I wouldn't have been . . . and I think you 
need a new voice." 
</P>
<P>
But Koop did want a Cabinet post as Secretary of Health and Human Services. He 
made it known. A medical lobby ("probably as potent an affair as ever existed") 
formed. Bush appointed Louis W. Sullivan, president of the school of medicine 
at Morehouse College, Atlanta, to the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of reasons why I am not secretary," Koop said. "I am too 
outspoken and independence is viewed by some people around the President as not 
being a team player. I think they wanted to have a minority." 
</P>
<P>
Above all, Koop thinks he was tripped by his Washington record of never 
politicizing medical and personal opinions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when you sit at a cabinet meeting with the President and he says: 
'Chick, next week when you appear before so-and-so, the Administration position 
has to be . . .,' then I might have to say: 'Well, I can't go.' " 
</P>
<P>
Koop denied Washington rumors that he was angry at being passed over. 
</P>
<P>
"Friends had asked: But how will you feel if you don't get it," Koop continued. 
"I said: I'll be disappointed for a few days and happy for the rest of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Happiness for Koop is the pace of being on the road for two weeks of every 
month, the pressure of 51 speaking engagements ("that's a misnomer . . . you 
usually speak once, teach a class, perhaps go and talk to a high school on AIDS 
or smoking") since July -- and now the unique challenge of building a third 
career at the start of his eighth decade. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, between flights, Koop was home for only a few hours. He usually sees 
three films a year and they are in-flight movies. Most days are 14-hour sprints 
starting at 5 a.m with 10 minutes of prayer. Koop once went to bed at 2 a.m., 
slept until 7 a.m. and spent two days apologizing to his secretary for 
oversleeping. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never been a rester," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He also needs the money, Koop says, for two sons, a daughter and seven 
grandchildren. He can't build their inheritance on a federal pension. So, to 
cover his penchant for speaking for nothing "to any place where the message 
counts, where I will reach people who will reach others," he charges richer 
organizations $25,000 an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor has always treated himself this harshly. 
</P>
<P>
He was attending Dartmouth at the age of 16 and decided to specialize in 
pediatric surgery because there were only six such physicians in the nation. 
Doctors were reluctant to anesthetize babies. Surgery on infants was virtually 
unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"I was keenly aware that kids weren't getting a fair shake in surgery, that 
they were falling through the cracks," Koop said. 
</P>
<P>
He closed those gaps with pioneer surgeries on babies with birth defects and by 
establishing the nation's first neonatal intensive care unit at Philadelphia's 
prestigious Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Siamese twins, several sets, were brought to Koop for separation. And if a tiny 
patient died, Koop often would deliver the eulogy. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow doctors idolized this 200-pound ex-football player with the fingers of a 
watchmaker. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the forefather of pediatric surgery . . . one of the best surgeons I've 
ever seen," says Dr. Louise Schnaufer, associate professor of pediatric surgery 
at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some criticized Koop, the devout Christian, for co-mingling science and 
religion by praying at a child's bedside. Koop's retort was typically pungent: 
"I have found there are very few atheists among the parents of dying children." 
</P>
<P>
It was perhaps inevitable that he would become a pro-life devotee. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote two books on the subject, lectured nationwide and his message was that 
legal abortion could track to "the very beginnings of the political climate 
that led to Auschwitz, Dachau and Belsen." 
</P>
<P>
When Koop was nominated Surgeon General in 1981, liberal voices were unanimous 
that President Reagan only wanted this pro-lifer to support his own 
anti-abortion posture. 
</P>
<P>
The hostilities of nomination lasted nine months. Koop was insulted as "Dr. 
Kook," his family was "crushed." 
</P>
<P>
As he remembers it now: "Think how you would feel if you had been the darling 
of a city like Philadelphia, preeminent in your specialty and considered to be 
one of its founders, its sage. 
</P>
<P>
"And all of a sudden you're an absolute bum. Even in the city that nurtured 
you, there are cartoons showing you as a two-headed monster." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody, he said, saw him as a physician and public servant unwilling to 
compromise ethics for political ideology. 
</P>
<P>
"What the press missed totally, was that on the second day I was in Washington, 
I voluntarily went to the Secretary of Health and said: 'Mr. Secretary, I just 
want you to know, in case you are asked, it is not my intention to use this job 
as a pulpit for pro-life causes.' 
</P>
<P>
"I was mislabeled and misunderstood. It took successive press conferences where 
I called a spade a spade and did not succumb to pressure from either side (of 
the abortion question), for the press to begin to appreciate me." 
</P>
<P>
Yet abortion remained his albatross. It flew again this year when President 
Reagan promised right-to-life organizations a report on the psychological harm 
to women who had abortions. Koop's "report" was a five-page letter stating that 
such evidence did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
This time, it was his former allies, the conservative right-to-lifers, who 
crucified Koop. Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus, said that 
if the surgeon general "couldn't act on what he believed to be correct, he 
should have resigned." 
</P>
<P>
The irony, says Koop, is that he most certainly was acting on what he believed 
to be correct. 
</P>
<P>
"The President," he explained, "was led to believe that I would produce a 
document for him that would be very effective actually in reversing Roe vs. 
Wade," the landmark Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. "But the health 
of women who had abortions has never been an issue. It is the morality of 
whether or not you are destroying a person." 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, he sees a dangerous message in continuing efforts to prove 
psychological damage of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a subterfuge and I think a kind of admission of defeat on the part of 
the pro-life people," he said. "If in midstream, they suddenly shift their 
emphasis to the health of mothers, they must have forgotten why they got into 
this (abortion issue) in the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
He remains opposed to abortion, but not to contraception. He is concerned with 
life. "But I don't think that if you prevent a sperm and an egg from meeting in 
some way, that you are upsetting life." 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Koop wrote his rigid indictment of cigarette smoking, focusing 
exclusively on its connection with a dozen cancers. He proposed a smoke-free 
America by the year 2000, called for tougher health warnings on cigarette packs 
-- and was vilified by cigarette companies, their lobbies, their legislators 
and the governor of North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the cigarette habit continues to decline and Koop thinks his smoke-free 
society may not be a pipe dream. Looking back, he presumes the crusade will be 
considered among the highest triumphs of public health. 
</P>
<P>
"I called upon the citizens of the country to do it and they did it," he said. 
"We had 80 ordinances against smoking in 50 states at that time. It is now over 
480 and that is (an example of) militant nonsmokers getting on the stick. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday, in Greensboro, N.C., they voted for restriction on smoking in the 
city. That is unbelievable. That is the home of the tobacco companies." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Koop numbed but educated the nation with his report on AIDS. 
He researched it alone, talking for months to researchers, gay activists and 
sufferers. He wrote it alone, all 26 drafts, at a stand-up desk in the basement 
of his home. 
</P>
<P>
In graphic language and with stark definitions, Koop called for sex education 
at grade-school level and condoms for those who could not practice abstinence. 
</P>
<P>
Ultraconservative author and activist Phyllis Schlafly accused Koop of 
promoting immorality. 
</P>
<P>
David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist and chairman of a National 
Academy of Sciences task force on AIDS, told an interviewer at the time that 
history will remember Koop "as a hero, the one person in the Administration who 
attempted to act positively and decisively." 
</P>
<P>
Koop remembers the period as a test of his loyalty to President Reagan and "the 
toughest time in my life . . . when the country was demanding that the 
President say and do something about AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
At press conferences, his AIDS report would be lauded. 
</P>
<P>
Then came questions about Administration inaction. 
</P>
<P>
"My retort was: 'I thought you said you liked what I did. Well, I am the 
Administration. I am the person doing AIDS right now. You don't ask the 
President to talk about diarrhea or cholera. Why should he talk about AIDS?' " 
</P>
<P>
So at some "personal discomfort," Koop said, he defended President Reagan "for 
not using the dirty word. I had looked forward to Mr. Bush being quite 
different. But he hasn't said a word either." 
</P>
<P>
Koop remains concerned by those who deny the heterosexual spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"It stands to reason that if AIDS has been in Africa as long as it has been and 
its transmission now is largely heterosexual, it is going to be (like that) 
here eventually," he said. "The second thing that bothers me is the projection 
for the world by the end of the century." 
</P>
<P>
World Health Organization statistics, he said, indicate that 100 million people 
will be testing HIV positive 10 years from now. 
</P>
<P>
"If that is the case, and if you stopped it (AIDS) then," Koop said, "you would 
(still) have the deaths of 100 million people." 
</P>
<P>
These thoughts and fears are the stuff of the book he is writing, not a 
biography, he says, but memoirs of the Washington years where his motivation 
never shifted -- but where allegiances changed around him as times, labels, 
causes and people changed. 
</P>
<P>
Now there are new causes. 
</P>
<P>
He wants a fresh emphasis on the wellness of America through citizen adoption 
of preventive health measures. 
</P>
<P>
"If we spent one third of the effort on preventing things from happening that 
we do on trying to cure or repair them, we would be way ahead," he said. 
"Estimates say that the years you gain, the premature deaths that you postpone 
. . . you get about 70% of those from prevention and about 15% from repair." 
</P>
<P>
The payoff for a 45-year-old starting now, he said, will be a reduced need for 
medical repair in later years. 
</P>
<P>
For 20 years from now, Koop continued, health-care resources for the elderly 
"are going to be scarce . . . there are going to be so many people over 65 that 
the gravy is going to be very thin as far as medical care of the conventional 
sort is concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The health-care gospel according to Koop is simple: 
</P>
<P>
* Don't smoke. 
</P>
<P>
* Drink only in moderation. 
</P>
<P>
* Exercise proportionate to age. 
</P>
<P>
* Avoid stress. 
</P>
<P>
* Choose an appropriate diet. 
</P>
<P>
Koop's television specials, his book, the speeches and interviews will be 
conduits, he said, to the commercial videotapes that "I am just aching to do . 
. . health videos directed at people like you to buy for your mother. 
</P>
<P>
"There are three one-way tickets to nursing homes that don't have to be. 
Fractured hips. Diabetic amputations. Incontinence. And I have a good answer to 
all three." 
</P>
<P>
Yet if it all ended today -- with a repeat of a heart attack suffered in his 
50s, with a worsening of the arthritis he suffers, with a recurrence of the 
spinal canal closure that left him a temporary paraplegic in 1987 -- there 
remain many treasures in the past and present of Charles Everett Koop. 
</P>
<P>
Chick and Betty Koop did lose a son, David Charles Everett, a 20-year-old 
junior at Dartmouth who was killed in a New Hampshire climbing accident in 
1968. But there is Allen, 45, a history professor; Norman, 43, a Presbyterian 
minister, and Elizabeth Thompson, 38, a homemaker, and all their children. 
There was remoteness and much separation in those early years, said Koop. But 
today's family meetings -- especially when the Koops attend Norman's church -- 
are perpetual Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
Koop's opinions have been described as Commandments and his delivery and 
presence close to Moses. He says, mischievously, that he is not uncomfortable 
with that image. 
</P>
<P>
He keeps contact with hundreds of his 100,000 former patients, now productive 
adults. Especially Paul Sweeney, born 24 years and 56 operations ago with 
multiple defects. Three surgeons refused to operate on the baby. Koop said he 
would. Last year, Sweeney graduated from West Chester State College in 
Pennsylvania and is headed for law school. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that large legend is that in 1983, when Sweeney was facing his final 
operation, Surgeon General Koop flew to Philadelphia and, in full uniform, 
wheeled Sweeney to the operating room. 
</P>
<P>
About that uniform. 
</P>
<P>
It is the official wear of the Public Health Service and gave Koop the rank 
equivalent of three-star general. He insisted on wearing it in the office, he 
said, as "a pure morale builder" for a lightly regarded organization that 
eventually developed "into what they were supposed to be, a quasi-military, 
uniformed, unarmed service." 
</P>
<P>
That uniform, white ducks in summer, navy blue in winter, became a symbol of 
Koop. 
</P>
<P>
"The other day I was at a meeting," Koop said. "One of the curators of the 
Smithsonian said: 'I'd like your uniform.' "

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: HEART-HEALTHY DIET WITHSTANDS RIGORS OF HOLIDAY EATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five years ago, before Pauline Price had quadruple bypass surgery, she wouldn't 
even walk a block for better health. Now, she participates in an exercise 
program four times a week and has changed to a healthier eating regimen -- even 
during the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing this for the rest of my life, for my life," she said last week at a 
tasting of healthy holiday dishes, sponsored by the American Heart Assn. The 
recipes are included in the organization's free "Holidays a la Heart" brochure, 
a compilation of menu suggestions that are easy to prepare and have less fat, 
sodium and cholesterol, but are high in taste. 
</P>
<P>
Price, like the other samplers, who included cardiac rehabilitation patients, 
dietitians and the media, found the appetizer, beverage, entree and dessert 
recipes to be good tasting and not lacking the flavor and texture traditionally 
associated with holiday season menus. 
</P>
<P>
The event was designed, according to the organization, to demonstrate that 
holiday foods don't have to be calorie-laden and unhealthful to be enjoyable -- 
a fact upon which participants whole-heartedly agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had served this to friends not on the program," Price explained, "they 
would think it was some kind of gourmet food. You couldn't accuse it of being 
health food. I had seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Felando, one of the registered dietitians who prepared the dishes, and who 
conducts the risk factor management classes Price participates in, said that 
the freedom to have guilt-free seconds is among the benefits of serving items 
such as those included in the "Holidays a la Heart" booklet for Thanksgiving -- 
a holiday with a reputation for encouraging overeating. 
</P>
<P>
During this time of year, rich creamy dishes and fatty desserts are traditions, 
but they wreak havoc on a heart-healthy diet. By incorporating slender versions 
of these items, such as a zucchini toast appetizer or Bean Dip With Fat-Free 
Corn Chips, (both were the favorites at the event) it is possible to "eat a lot 
of food and still lose a few pounds here and there," Felando said. And the 
recipes (which follow) sampled by The Times, really did taste good. 
</P>

HINTS FROM HELOISE: THANKSGIVING IS ALSO A TIME FOR EXCHANGING PRESENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I would like to share an idea I used last year for a family 
get-together over the Thanksgiving holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Since all the family would be together during Thanksgiving but not Christmas, I 
thought of having a "turkey tree" with a nice gift for everyone underneath. 
</P>
<P>
I made it from a medium-sized tree branch. I placed the bare branch upright in 
a coffee can, then weighted it down with rocks and sand and put the coffee can 
in a beautiful wicker basket. 
</P>
<P>
Decorating the turkey tree was the fun part, just as it is with a Christmas 
tree. I applied ribbon bows, cross-stitch turkey and Thanksgiving-motif 
ornaments and maple leaves throughout the branches. At the base I placed a 
large table-top turkey decoration and set out all the presents underneath. The 
tree and presents fit nicely on a buffet table top. 
</P>
<P>
After a delicious Thanksgiving dinner we shared our gifts, and it was a most 
enjoyable day. Remember, you can't always gather on Christmas so make a special 
day when your family is lucky enough to be with loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MIMI, San Antonio 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Last year you had a recipe for a peachy substitute for cranberry 
sauce for Thanksgiving dinner. My family does not like cranberries and I would 
like to make this peach sauce that I think will go well with the turkey dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MS. M., Staten Island, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MS. M: The sauce you are referring to is called jelled peach sauce, and it 
is a great alternative to cranberry sauce with the Thanksgiving dinner. 
</P>
<P>
You will need: one large can of peaches, one-half cup of sugar, one-half 
teaspoon of nutmeg and one box of lemon gelatin. 
</P>
<P>
Drain the canned peaches, saving the syrup. Puree the peaches in the blender. 
To the drained peach syrup, add enough water to make one cup of liquid. Pour 
into a sauce pan and add the sugar and nutmeg. Bring mixture to a boil and let 
it boil for about one minute. 
</P>
<P>
Next empty the box of gelatin into a bowl and stir in the hot liquid mixture 
until the gelatin is dissolved. Add pureed peaches and pour into a mold. Chill 
until set. 
</P>
<P>
For those who are watching their weight or must limit their sugar intake, 
substitute diet gelatin and peaches in light syrup or omit the sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: For children who like to snap the wishbone of a chicken or turkey 
carcass, a few seconds in the microwave will dry it out immediately. 
</P>
<P>
This is a lot quicker than placing the wishbone on the windowsill and waiting 
three days for it to dry. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Katherine, Ventura, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: When a stick of butter or margarine is removed from the wrapper, 
measuring a tablespoon can become guesswork. 
</P>
<P>
A hint I found helpful is to score the stick at each marking before removing 
the wrapper. Afterwards, measuring is still accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- L. N., Winston-Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: In order to take advantage of special offers that demand proof of 
purchase (UPC symbol, the bar code), I have started cutting out the bar code of 
most empty food packages before throwing them out. I then write the name of the 
product on the back and store them all in an envelope until needed. 
</P>
<P>
This saves me time when a special offer is announced and all I have to do is 
look up the correct one.

Turkey preparation tips -- The New York City Health Department's Bureau of 
Nutrition offers the following tips for buying and roasting a holiday turkey: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Buying, allow 3/4 to 1 pound per serving from an 8- to 12-pound turkey. 
Larger birds have a larger proportion of meat to bones -- 1/2 to 1/4 pound a 
person should be sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fresh turkey, plan to roast within a day of purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Frozen turkey, purchase several days in advance to allow sufficient time 
for thawing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Thawing, leave turkey in the original wrapper. In the refrigerator, place 
the turkey on a shallow tray. Allow two to three days to thaw a 12- to 16-pound 
turkey. In cold water, place turkey in a pan or in the sink and cover with cold 
water. Change the water often. Allow about 1/2 hour per pound of turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Thawing at room temperature is not recommended. Surface bacteria can multiply 
to dangerous levels at room temperatures of 60 degrees and above. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Preparation for roasting, remove giblets. Rinse the inside and outside of 
the turkey and giblets in cold water. Drain well. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Giblets, gizzard, heart, liver and neck meat are savory additions to 
stuffing. Simmer giblets in water, seasoned as desired, until fork tender. 
Gizzard, heart and neck, about 1 1/2 hours; liver, about 20 minutes. Dice meat 
and add to stuffing. Use the cooking broth to moisten. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stuffing, do not stuff the bird until just before roasting. Stuffing a bird 
requires extra handling. It is safer to bake stuffing separately, particularly 
in warm weather. 
</P>
<P>
If bird is to be stuffed, allow approximately 3/4 cup stuffing for 1 pound of 
turkey. Spoon stuffing lightly into body and neck cavities, allowing room for 
expansion. Skewer neck skin to back and tuck wings under. Fasten legs by tying 
or tucking under skin band. 
</P>
<P>
 -- How to roast, if meat thermometer is used, insert into thick part of thigh, 
without touching the bone. 
</P>
<P>
Uncovered, place turkey, breast up on rack in shallow roasting pan and roast in 
a 325-degree oven. Baste occasionally, if necessary, with broth or fruit 
juices. Cover loosely with foil if browning too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Foil wrapped, place turkey, breast up, in center of well-greased wide heavy 
foil. Fold foil over securely on top and at ends. Place in shallow pan without 
rack and roast in 450-degree oven. Open foil last 20 minutes to permit 
browning. 
</P>
<P>
Roasting timetable for stuffed turkey -- If turkey weighs from 8 to 12 pounds, 
roast uncovered, 4 to 4 1/2 hours; foil wrapped, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. 
</P>
<P>
If turkey weighs from 12 to 16 pounds, roast uncovered, 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 hours; 
foil wrapped, 3 to 3 1/4 hours. 
</P>
<P>
If turkey weighs from 16 to 20 pounds, roasted uncovered 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 hours; 
foil wrapped, 3 1/4 to 3 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Unstuffed turkeys require about one-half hour less roasting time. 
</P>
<P>
Test for doneness -- About 20 minutes before roasting time is up, test bird. 
When done, the thickest part of the drumstick should feel tender, and drumstick 
should twist easily. If a thermometer is used, it should register 185 degrees. 
After removing from oven, let the turkey stand 15 to 20 minutes, for easy 
carving. 
</P>
<P>
Care of leftovers -- If possible, dismantle the bird completely after the meal. 
Always immediately refrigerate leftover turkey meat, stuffing and gravy in 
separate containers. The meat may be sliced or diced in accordance with plans 
for future use. The broken carcass can be simmered with water and seasonings 
for a soup base or stock. Use leftovers within one to three days, or freeze for 
longer storage. Plan to use frozen leftovers within one month.

CULINARY SOS: HONEY-GLAZED HAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR SOS: For Thanksgiving I want to make a honey-baked ham similar to the ones 
sold commercially. Can you help? 
</P>
<P>
 -- ROGER 
</P>
<P>
DEAR ROGER: Here is a recipe for a honey-glazed ham, with instructions for 
slicing the ham before heating, if you want the ham precut. 
</P>
<P>
BAKED HONEY HAM 
</P>
<P>
2 cups honey 
</P>
<P>
2 cups brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup cider vinegar 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons ground nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons ground cloves 
</P>
<P>
1 (5- to 6-pound) cooked ham, bone in, or 1 (3- to 4-pound) boneless ham 
</P>
<P>
Combine honey, brown sugar, vinegar, nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves. Bake bone-in 
ham at 350 degrees 1 hour to heat through, basting with honey sauce 
occasionally. Place in broiler to glaze top. 
</P>
<P>
To cook boneless ham, slice halfway through at 1/4-inch intervals, then tie 
with string. Place in roasting pan. Heat honey sauce and pour over ham to 
marinate 24 hours before baking. Then bake at 350 degrees 1 hour or until 
heated through. Glaze top under broiler, if desired. Makes 6 to 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: Approximately 10 years ago, The Times ran a recipe for a cake made 
with Bourbon. Although I made it once, I did not keep the recipe. It was an 
adult cake, and I had youngsters at the time and I failed to allow for their 
growing up. With no children around an adult cake would not only be delicious, 
but unique. 
</P>
<P>
 -- RITA 
</P>
<P>
DEAR RITA: Get out the bourbon. You are going to have a very nice cake. 
</P>
<P>
BOURBON NUT CAKE 
</P>
<P>
4 cups sifted flour 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
4 teaspoons ground nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
1 cup butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
2 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
6 eggs 
</P>
<P>
4 ounces bourbon, about 
</P>
<P>
4 cups coarsely chopped pecans 
</P>
<P>
1 pound dark raisins 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound candied cherries, sliced or chopped 
</P>
<P>
Powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
Sift together flour, baking powder and nutmeg. Cream butter well, then 
gradually add sugar and continue to cream until fluffy. Beat in eggs, 1 at 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Add sifted dry ingredients alternately with bourbon. Stir in nuts, raisins and 
cherries. Turn batter into well-greased 10-inch tube pan lined on bottom with 
wax paper. 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 300 degrees 2 hours, or until cake tester inserted near center comes 
out clean. If top begins to brown before cake is done, cover loosely with foil. 
Remove cake from oven and let stand 10 to 15 minutes, then turn out onto rack 
to cool completely. 
</P>
<P>
When cool, sprinkle with additional bourbon and wrap. Use more bourbon if 
fragrant cake is desired. Let cake mellow 1 week or longer for best flavor. 
Sprinkle with sifted powdered sugar before slicing. Makes about 16 servings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: The woman who wrote to you asking for the recipe for Mexican lasagna 
will be disappointed with the one you printed. I am enclosing the recipe from 
Lawry's Consumer Kitchens so you can update your files. This recipe is a 
favorite of many. 
</P>
<P>
 -- CINDY 
</P>
<P>
DEAR CINDY: Thanks. By the way, for those who wonder what in the world to do 
with all that leftover turkey, try using cooked, cubed or chopped leftover 
turkey meat in lieu of ground beef in this recipe. Brown the turkey lightly 
before adding seasonings, tomatoes and other ingredients. Continue to cook as 
directed, even though turkey has been cooked once before.

HOT PROPERTY: CAPTAIN &amp; TENNILLE CASTING OFF STUDIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Captain &amp; Tennille, husband/wife pop stars DARYL DRAGON and TONI 
TENNILLE, have put their Rumbo Studios in Canoga Park on the market so they can 
spend more time on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe, where they've had a home for 
the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
"They're both still recording," said Christina Paradise, who shares the 
$3.3-million listing with Bruce Conover at Douglas Properties in Malibu, "but 
Rumbo Studios is an ongoing business, not just for them, and the Captain is 
just getting tired of flying back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
Dragon said that he is selling the studios because "it's time to move on." 
</P>
<P>
He and Tennille have owned the studios since the complex was built in 1979. 
"They chose the location because they got their first recording deal half a 
block away," Paradise said. 
</P>
<P>
The complex has three studios and a number of separate isolation booths. It 
also has a pool room, tape library, full kitchen, kitchenette, three baths, a 
shower, several offices, a couple of lounges, a technical shop and a basketball 
half-court. Updated electronic equipment was recently installed. 
</P>
<P>
Among the studio's recording credits are Tom Petty's "Full Moon Fever," Roy 
Orbison's "Mystery Girl," Eddie Money's "Nothing to Lose," Guns N' Roses albums 
"Appetite for Destruction" and "G N R Live," as well as work by the Jefferson 
Airplane, REO Speedwagon, Trevor Rabin, Cory Hart and The Smithereens.

February, Hayden moved from their house in the northern part of Santa Monica to 
an apartment in Westwood. Fonda is still believed to be living in the Santa 
Monica home they shared. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden's new house is in Sunset Park, a neighborhood in the southern end of 
Santa Monica. The house was described as a "classic California-style bungalow" 
with three bedrooms and two baths. Hayden paid $750,000, according to sources 
not associated with the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The house had been listed with Shirley Bly and Bill Bolton, both in the Santa 
Monica office of Fred Sands Realtors.

Multimillionaire sportsman BRIGGS CUNNINGHAM, 82-year-old heir to the Procter 
&amp; Gamble fortune who skippered the United States to victory in the 1958 
America's Cup Race, and his wife, Laura, are building a 15,000-square-foot 
Italian villa at Fairbanks Ranch in the San Diego County community of Rancho 
Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
The couple, both of whom are former race car drivers, are perhaps best known 
for their Costa Mesa automotive museum, which was sold and moved to Florida in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
They bought three Fairbanks Ranch lots, each about an acre in size, several 
years ago for a total of $900,000. Marianne Whyte of Fairbanks Ranch Realty 
handled the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Cunningham created the design of her new house with the help of architect 
Cliff Mills. It will have nearly 100 columns, an elaborate stereo system that 
is even piped into the swimming pool and a seven-car garage when completed by 
year-end.

RICHARD PAGE, lead singer and bassist with the rock group Mr. Mister, got so 
interested in surfing when not working on the group's new album that he sold 
his Zuma Beach property and bought a house at Point Dume. 
</P>
<P>
"He got turned onto surfing, and it's better at Point Dume than at Zuma," said 
Jay Rubenstein of Malibu Realty, who represented Page in the transactions. "And 
now he can easily get to the beach on a pathway from his home." 
</P>
<P>
Page's house, a wood-and-glass contemporary, was built in 1949, but it has been 
remodeled and expanded. It has four bedrooms and 3 1/2 baths in 3,022 square 
feet. Page plans to add a second-story master bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
The home sits on an acre, with beautiful trees, a few hundred feet from Johnny 
Carson's house. Page paid, according to public records, $1.41 million.

The former BOB HOPE USO BUILDING at 1641 Ivar Ave. in Hollywood has just 
undergone a $1-million renovation for HKM Productions, a company that has made 
TV commercials for such firms as 7-Up, General Electric, Merle Norman and 
Levi's Youthwear. 
</P>
<P>
HKM Productions and its new affiliate, HKM Films, are already occupying the 
20,000-square-foot building as their new headquarters, complete with two 
casting stages, an off-line video editing system and a film-cutting room. The 
building was constructed in 1936 and was used for years by the Southern 
California Gas Co., according to an HKM spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob Hope opened it (for the USO) in 1973, dedicated it -- even had his logo 
there -- and entertained there a couple times," said Ward Grant, a publicist 
for Hope. The USO closed the building to relocate to Long Beach last year.

VENICE PROJECT MIXES HOUSING WITH SHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON, Whiteson is a Los Angeles free-lancer who writes on 
architectural topics. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the casual eye, the new Venice Renaissance building on Main Street does not 
seem out of the ordinary. Yet its cream stucco walls enclose a mixture of 
condos, apartments, shops and restaurants rarely found under one roof in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
This highly urban mix of residential and retail areas in one development, 
common in most U.S. cities, is unusual here, where zoning laws encourage -- or 
rather, enforce -- a physical separation of the places people live and shop. 
</P>
<P>
These long-entrenched ordinances encourage a suburban-style sprawl that 
separates housing from shops or offices. But as the city runs out of space to 
expand and the population continues to grow, different patterns are beginning 
to be considered in official quarters. 
</P>
<P>
A mixed-use ordinance, which will permit commercial and residential segments 
under the same roof, is now being drafted by Mayor Tom Bradley's staff. 
</P>
<P>
The Venice Renaissance is the first major project in the city of Los Angeles in 
many years to combine a mixture of uses in one complex. Its design demonstrates 
how this combination may be gracefully planned, and sets the tone for the 
city's evolution toward a more mature urban style. 
</P>
<P>
The real quality of the Renaissance's architecture is to be found in the clever 
way in which the condos, apartments, shops and restaurants have been seamlessly 
fitted together in a plan that keeps the various elements distinct, yet fuses 
them in a common identity. 
</P>
<P>
Conceived by architects Johannes Van Tilburg &amp; Partners for developers 
Harlan Lee &amp; Associates and the Anden Group, the design creates a lively 
pedestrian frontage while preserving the privacy of the residential units 
above. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to achieve an architecture that is both street-friendly and 
distinguished," Van Tilburg explained. 
</P>
<P>
"Given that the building densities in Venice have to grow as property values 
increase, we feel that this kind of mixed-use development enhances the 
character of the neighborhood while accommodating the needs of newcomers." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to some of its recently developed neighbors on Main Street, the 
Renaissance is a model of grace. Compared to the lumpish red-brick and 
black-glass mall across Navy Street or the crude modernist steel structure on 
the northwest corner of Main and Marine Street, the Renaissance is sensitively 
scaled, lightly handled and discreetly detailed. 
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean style chosen by Van Tilburg for the Renaissance may be bland, 
but the pleasant way the architects have elaborated the potentially chunky 
design with curved Streamline Moderne balconies and perky towers keeps the 
geometries crisp. 
</P>
<P>
The Renaissance's shops and restaurants are set back behind an arcade that 
recalls the original Venice colonnades. The column capitals are cast aluminum 
copies of Venice developer Abott Kinney's early-20th Century originals that 
include mustachioed faces. 
</P>
<P>
Each corner of the block-long building is anchored by a major restaurant, and 
the stores are a deliberately neighborhood-oriented mix, including a bakery, 
pharmacy, bookstore and dry cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
A giant clown created by artist Jonathan Borofsky will dominate the main corner 
at Rose Avenue and Main. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the retail space is a three-level parking garage for 473 autos, entered 
off Navy Street, under a steel sculpture by Guy Dill. The main level is for 
shoppers and, on weekends, for beach visitors. The lower levels are for 
tenants' cars. 
</P>
<P>
A deep concrete slab over the shops and garage creates a horizontal firebreak 
that also serves as a platform for the lightweight wood-frame construction of 
the two- and three-story living units above. 
</P>
<P>
To break up the long facade, the architects have divided the 66 condos into 
three inverted V-shaped sections that angle back from the street. Most of the 
condos have a seaward view over Venice Beach to the west. The smaller 
apartments set aside for senior citizens overlook Main Street and its colorful 
parade of increasingly upscale shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
This articulated layout makes the scale of the residential blocks more domestic 
and intimate and sets up a pleasant visual rhythm along Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
The two-bedroom condos are planned to seem spacious and bright. The top-floor 
units have lofts overlooking the living room, reached by circular stairs. Entry 
to all the residences is through separate ground-floor lobbies that are locked 
for security. 
</P>
<P>
The spaces on the first-floor platform between the condos are planted as 
rooftop communal gardens looking toward the sea. These gardens are particularly 
attractive for the occupants of the 23 senior citizen apartments located along 
the Main Street frontage. 
</P>
<P>
These self-contained one-room units are rented out for $100 to $300 per month 
to elderly and disabled people chosen by the developer from a list of 
applicants supplied by a local senior citizens committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We placed the units for older people on the street for a mixture of reasons at 
once commercial, architectural and humane," explained Michael Dieden, the 
Harlan Lee partner in charge of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"Commercially, we wanted the low-rent apartments to serve as a sound buffer 
between the noisy thoroughfare and the expensive condos at the rear. 
</P>
<P>
"Architecturally, we kept the street profile low to match the rest of Main 
Street by placing the senior citizen units out front. 
</P>
<P>
"Humanely, we felt that the elderly, who necessarily spend much of their time 
at home, would prefer to be able to look out at the life of the street rather 
than be stuck away at the back of the site." 
</P>
<P>
The design allows for open-air common walkways between the condos and the 
apartments -- internal mini-streets -- where young and old may casually meet 
and maybe mingle. 
</P>
<P>
Dieden hopes that mixing the affluent owners of the condos, which sell for 
between $300,000 and $500,000, with the budget-conscious seniors will avoid the 
kind of social and economic ghettoization that is occurring all over the 
rapidly gentrifying Westside. 
</P>
<P>
A former community activist and consultant who recently became a developer, 
Dieden helped guide the Venice Renaissance project through five troubled years 
of neighborhood resistance and drastic code changes. 
</P>
<P>
To overcome the objections of local residents who feel that Venice is becoming 
overdeveloped and in danger of losing its casual, arty character, Harlan Lee 
first offered to incorporate artists' studios into the project. 
</P>
<P>
No sooner had this agreement been negotiated with the community, when the 
project was threatened by the November, 1986, passage of Proposition U, which 
cut the amount of commercial building allowed on a majority of city lots in 
half. 
</P>
<P>
To exceed the allowable building density, the developer had to apply for a 
zoning variance, besides the building code variances required to construct a 
project that mixes retail and residential spaces. During this period Harlan Lee 
approached local senior citizens groups and offered to change the former 
artists' lofts into low-rent housing for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
"Harlan Lee told me they could put senior citizen rental apartments at 
below-market rates in the Renaissance," said senior spokesman Maury Rosen. " 
'What's the catch?' I asked. 'Support the project, fight the crazies and 
no-growthers,' they said. We did, and we won." 
</P>
<P>
The Renaissance is architect Van Tilburg's second mixed-use project in the 
coastal area. Janss Court, on 3rd Street along the Santa Monica Mall, combines 
ground-floor retail and several cinemas with offices above, topped by condos. 
</P>
<P>
The design of the Renaissance is more integrated and graceful than Janss Court, 
which seems like an oddly assorted architectural layer cake. The top-floor 
Janss Court condos look as if they were an afterthought, added like icing after 
the cake was stale. 
</P>
<P>
As the forerunner of a new wave of mixed-used urban developments in Los 
Angeles, the Venice Renaissance, though not great or striking architecture, is 
an excellent beginning. As local designers gain more skill and experience in 
this new type of development, we shall certainly see humane designs that are 
also works of art.

THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN PURCHASING A HOME FOR RETIREMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENNY L. KASS, Kass is a Washington lawyer and newspaper columnist 
specializing in real estate and tax matters. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: My husband and I would like to purchase a retirement home. We are in 
our mid-70s, and it would be our first home purchase. We are completely 
inexperienced in such matters. What are the best steps to take? 
</P>
<P>
Would we be wise to have an inspection and a title search? When should we 
obtain a lawyer? What other items should we look out for? Also, we are 
considering paying all cash. Do you think this is wise for people in our age 
bracket? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Whether you are buying a retirement home or any other residential real 
estate, there are a number of issues -- both legal and financial -- that should 
be considered before signing the contract to purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the very first question is whether the area and the property you are 
considering meet your needs. While you indicate that you are in your mid-70s, 
one hopes that you will live a long time, and thus it is important to determine 
whether the neighborhood is convenient for your needs. 
</P>
<P>
Are there adequate shopping facilities nearby, so that you do not have to worry 
about driving or other transportation merely to get groceries? Are there any 
plans for development in the area? You should investigate these matters with 
the local community planning officials in the town or county where you are 
looking to buy. 
</P>
<P>
Once you decide on a particular house, I recommend that you discuss the 
purchase with all of your advisers and with your family. From a financial point 
of view, can you afford the house? From a legal point of view, you should 
obtain a knowledgeable real estate lawyer who will be representing your 
interest -- and only your interests. 
</P>
<P>
I strongly recommend that the contract you sign to purchase the property should 
include at least the following: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Contingency on a satisfactory inspection by a building inspector of your 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
You want an independent professional to carefully inspect the property, to make 
sure that it is structurally sound and to make sure that the mechanical 
equipment is not only in operating condition, but has a long useful life 
remaining. Obviously, you do not want to consider buying a house where the 
furnace may go bad in a year or two or the air conditioning system may be on 
its last legs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Contingency on financing. 
</P>
<P>
You asked whether you should pay all cash for your house. There is no easy 
answer to this question. Much depends on your own financial situation. If, for 
example, you are considering buying a property worth $150,000, and if you have 
several hundred thousand dollars in reserve, then it might make sense for you 
to pay all cash. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind, however, that if you pay all cash, the only tax benefits you will 
obtain are the real estate taxes on the property that have to be paid yearly. 
You might be better off -- if you can afford a mortgage loan -- to take out a 
moderate loan and make the monthly payments, taking advantage of some of the 
available tax benefits for home ownership. I know of too many retired 
individuals who are house rich and cash poor. Many people in your age bracket 
prefer to have a nest egg in the bank in the event of emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
You should also consider whether your children would be interested in joining 
with you on the purchase on a shared-equity basis. Perhaps your children need 
some tax benefits, and would be interested in investing in your property. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Title search. 
</P>
<P>
It is important that you have a title company or a settlement attorney do a 
complete title report on the property prior to settlement. You are making a 
major investment and want to make sure that the title you receive will be free 
and clear of all outstanding liens, encumbrances or other defects -- which we 
lawyers refer to as "clouds on title." 
</P>
<P>
If there is a real estate broker involved in the transaction, you should be 
able to get assistance from that person. Keep in mind, however, that unless you 
are paying the broker directly, that broker represents the seller and owes a 
fiduciary obligation to the seller in connection with the purchase and sale of 
the real estate. 
</P>
<P>
If you decide to obtain a mortgage, you should talk to several local lenders in 
the community where your future house is located. There are numerous loans 
available today, ranging from six-month adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM) to 
fixed 30-year conventional loans. You may be eligible for an FHA loan, 
depending on the amount of the loan you are seeking, and you may also have some 
unused Veterans Administration benefits available to you if one of you is a 
veteran. 
</P>
<P>
These financial questions should be explored before you sign the contract. 
</P>
<P>
You should also keep in mind that it is now a buyers' market. In many parts of 
the country, real estate sales are slow, despite the fact that interest rates 
are relatively low. This gives you, as a potential buyer, an advantage, and you 
should be prepared to enter into some heavy negotiations with the seller so as 
to get the best possible deal for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, one thing should be kept in mind: In the real estate 
world, absolutely everything is negotiable.

BOOKLET AVAILABLE ON REMOVAL OF ASBESTOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Contractors State License Board wants to help consumers learn to identify 
asbestos and be aware of precautions to take in its removal. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos cleanup of more than 100 square feet requires certification by the 
state. Even if the work is done by a homeowner, state regulations apply. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos, a naturally occurring mineral fiber, can cause asbestosis and cancer. 
Asbestos has been used in vinyl floor tile, vinyl sheet flooring, patching 
compounds, textured paints, ceilings, stove and furnace insulation, pipe 
insulation, wall and ceiling insulation, appliances, roofing, shingles and 
siding. 
</P>
<P>
For a free copy of its 12-page booklet, "A Consumer Guide to Asbestos," send a 
self-addressed envelope to the board at P.O. Box 26000, Sacramento, Calif. 
95826. A current list of contractors certified by the state to engage in 
asbestos-related work can also be requested.

APARTMENT LIFE: COURT UPHELD RENTER'S RIGHT TO PAY IN CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, Postema is editor of Apartment Age Magazine, a publication of 
the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, an apartment owners' service group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Your Oct. 22 "Apartment Life" column answered a question from an 
Arroyo Grande tenant with no bank account. His landlord refused to accept cash 
for rent payment. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago I had a similar conflict. I worked nights and was paid 
weekly. The rental office was closing and banks had been closed for hours. The 
first of the month was a Monday and a holiday. I had to pay cash or get stuck 
with a $50 late charge (the following Tuesday), when banks opened. 
</P>
<P>
The rental agent maintained that the complex's insurance policy wouldn't allow 
him to accept cash. I pointed out the language in the corner of every U.S. bill 
. . . "legal tender for all debts." I won in Small Claims Court. What do you 
think about that? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: I think that you and the rental agent wasted a lot of time and effort 
needlessly in Small Claims Court. If Monday was the first and a holiday, the 
rent wasn't due until Tuesday. The rental agent should have known that. (When 
rent in California is due on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, it automatically 
becomes due on the next business day.) 
</P>
<P>
I don't know whether the judge found for you for that reason or because of the 
language you refer to, which is printed on all U.S. currency and would seem to 
support your theory. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, yours was the argument I used when discussing the issue with our 
general counsel, Trevor A. Grimm. His experience in Municipal Court was 
different than yours in Small Claims Court. 
</P>
<P>
If a rental agreement calls for a particular method of payment, the contract 
generally prevails. 
</P>
<P>
Security Deposit Does Not Earn Interest 
</P>
<P>
Q: First, could you tell me if the security deposit for my Los Angeles 
apartment is supposed to be earning interest? 
</P>
<P>
Second, when I move out, is my security deposit supposed to be applied to 
apartment repairs and cleaning even though I clean and make all the needed 
minor repairs myself? 
</P>
<P>
I heard that the tenant is only responsible to pay for damages over and above 
"normal wear and tear" and for cleaning costs if the apartment is left unclean. 
Is this true? If so, how much should the landlord refund? 
</P>
<P>
A: Your deposit does not earn interest for you in the city of Los Angeles. Very 
few California cities require apartment owners to pay interest on security 
deposits. West Hollywood is the only Southern California city I am aware of 
with such a requirement. 
</P>
<P>
In California, security deposits may be used to pay for three types of 
expenses: unpaid rent, cleaning (if the unit was clean at move-in and isn't at 
move-out time), and for damages over and above "normal wear and tear," as you 
said. (Lost keys, garage door openers and the like are considered damages by 
the courts.) 
</P>
<P>
If the rent is all paid up, you leave the unit clean and fix any damages that 
exceed normal wear and tear, the landlord should refund the entire security 
deposit. 
</P>
<P>
Can Fired Employee Get Relocation Pay? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I work for the landlord of my Laguna Hills apartment in Orange County. My 
job contract says that if I am terminated for any reason, I have to vacate the 
apartment. I was injured here on the job and will soon be having knee surgery. 
I am also being treated for a herniated disk, and, as you might suspect, I am 
on sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
But now, I've been fired and the management company is trying to evict me. Am I 
entitled to any relocation money, and is there any kind of rent control in 
Laguna Hills? 
</P>
<P>
A: There is no rent control in Laguna Hills, an unincorporated area of Orange 
County. There are, however, a number of apartment properties built there in 
cooperation with the county Housing Community Development Program Office 
(HCDPO). Many of these require owners who break their leases to pay relocation 
monies to renters. The amount of the assistance, if any, varies and is tied to 
the renter's moving expenses. 
</P>
<P>
From what you're telling me, it doesn't appear that either of you is breaking 
the lease, which means you are not entitled to relocation money in this 
instance. To find out whether or not your building is partially or all county 
funded, and whether or not any kind of relocation fee may apply to it, call the 
HCDPO at (714) 568-4190. 
</P>
<P>
Not Much Recourse for Noisy Neighbors 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have lived in the same Brentwood apartment for the last 12 years. We are 
under L.A. city's rent control regulations. Beginning this past year, we are 
aware of the upstairs tenants' every move. Now, any movement up there causes my 
apartment to vibrate and it feels as if the ceiling is coming down on me. I 
believe that prior to these tenants moving in, new carpet must have been laid 
over minimal padding. Do I have any recourse? 
</P>
<P>
A: It doesn't matter whether or not the landlord had "minimal" padding 
installed if, in fact, he did. There are no state or local remedies for such an 
occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
It's more likely that you simply have noisy new neighbors. I would talk to the 
new neighbors and ask them to hold it down a little. If they are uncooperative, 
there is little you or the landlord can do. While rent control holds your rent 
down, it also protects your noisy neighbors from eviction. Because of the law's 
"just-cause" eviction provisions, it is virtually impossible for a landlord to 
evict a noisy tenant.

GROWING UP IN BISHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1957, the small Owens Valley town of Bishop, 280 miles north of Los Angeles, 
was no less remote than today. Its first housing tract was completed that year. 
It featured ranch-style houses designed by the late Cliff May.

Our family bought a new one with three bedrooms and two bathrooms for $16,300. 
The tract, typically financed by the Veterans Administration, was named 
"Westridge Manor." (Some dubbed it "Mortgage Manor.") So great was the demand, 
the tract sold out before the houses were completed. 
</P>
<P>
The generous expanse of windows solar-heated us in the daytime; at night, we 
closed drapes for warmth and privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Garages, evolving from barns historically placed behind houses, now were 
attached at the front. Spacious yards resulted from this Cliff May innovation. 
Many of us redwood-fenced our back yards on Robert Frost's theory that "Good 
fences make good neighbors." With enormous pride we planted lawns, rose bushes 
and fruit trees. We ordered Jungle Gyms and swing sets and barbecues from the 
Sears, Roebuck catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
Garages and carports were easily converted into family rooms to accommodate the 
baby boom. In 1961, our tract had a kindergarten population alone sufficient to 
fill a classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Today, a new generation of baby boomers enjoy the good life in those same 
functional houses Cliff May designed.

WORKS ALONE, LIKES IT

As a structural engineer in practice since 1957, I take exception to R. D. 
Crowell's quote, "A one-man office is an accident waiting to happen," from the 
article "Architects Are Drawing Lawsuits for Malpractice" (Nov. 5). 
</P>
<P>
I have employed engineers, but I've worked alone for the last 13 years. My 
employees were first-rate, and many are now in practice. In recent years, it 
has become difficult to find people who wish to take on structural engineering 
with its headaches and responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
As a one-man engineering operation, I prepare calculations and details, review 
shop drawings, correct structural plans, coordinate with the other disciplines 
and make whatever changes or corrections are necessary. It may seem like a 
great deal of work for one person, but it is the most efficient way to do it 
and, I believe, the best way to eliminate costly errors. 
</P>
<P>
Also, on large projects with weekly construction meetings where all of the 
disciplines are present, when the contractor asks questions about facets of 
one's work, I have no problem responding. On the other hand, architect's or 
engineer's representatives often cannot answer until they contact their boss. 
</P>
<P>
Owners take a dim view of this delay, and later, if they feel that the 
professionals they hired let them down, don't mind calling an attorney for 
imagined or valid grievances. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, not surprisingly, I don't carry insurance.

PUMP SAVES ENERGY IN COOLING AND HEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
QUESTION: I should replace my old heat pump before winter. What are the newest 
and highest-efficiency heat pump designs (for both heating and air 
conditioning) available? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: There are several new designs of super-high-efficiency heat pumps that 
can reduce your annual utility costs by many hundreds of dollars. These new 
heat pumps may also be a cost-effective option for homes with natural gas 
furnaces and central air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
A heat pump works both as a furnace and an air conditioner. The heating 
efficiency is rated by co-efficient of performance (COP) and the cooling 
efficiency by SEER, like central air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
Some new super-high-efficiency heat pumps have a maximum COP higher than three. 
This means that you get more than three dollars worth of heat for each dollar 
you pay the electric company. Cooling SEER's are as high as 12. You can get 
indoor units designed to be located in a utility room, crawl space, or attic. 
</P>
<P>
One new high-efficiency heat pump design uses a two-speed compressor. When your 
heating or air conditioning needs are low to moderate, which is the majority of 
the time, the compressor runs at a lower speed. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the unit runs longer at a lower electrical usage rate. It does not 
cycle on and off as often as with a typical single-speed compressor. This 
reduces inefficiencies and greatly increases your comfort by providing even and 
continuous heat. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer, improved comfort is even more dramatic because continuous and 
slower operation dehumidifies the air better. You can get an optional kit to 
lower the indoor blower speed too for even better comfort. 
</P>
<P>
A further efficiency and comfort improvement is provided by a new, totally 
variable-speed compressor design. Sophisticated microprocessors determine the 
ideal speed for both the compressor and indoor blower to run. In effect, the 
heat pump capacity is always sized perfectly to provide reduced heating and 
cooling costs and optimum comfort. 
</P>
<P>
A geothermal heat pump design provides the lowest operating costs. These use 
the earth as a source for heat instead of the outdoor air. Since the 
temperature of the ground stays warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer 
than the outdoor air, the efficiency remains very high year-round. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a gas furnace and have to replace your central air conditioner, 
depending on your local utility rates, a high-efficiency heat pump may be a 
viable option. During mild fall and spring weather, it may be less expensive to 
operate a high-efficiency heat pump than an old gas furnace. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 391 showing a list of 
manufacturers, model numbers, and efficiency ratings for these new designs of 
super-high-efficiency heat pumps. Please include $1 and a self-addressed 
business-sized envelope. Send your requests to James Dulley, c/o Los Angeles 
Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244. 
</P>
<P>
Correct Window Size for Side Facing North 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm converting my utility room to a study and plan to add a window. Since it 
is on the north side, should I install a very small one? 
</P>
<P>
A: You are correct that you should minimize the amount of window area on the 
north side of your house. The coldest winter winds come from the north and the 
winter sun never shines in. 
</P>
<P>
First check your local building codes. Most require a minimum size since it may 
be needed for an emergency exit. A minimum opening height or width of 18 inches 
and minimum opening area of 4 square feet is common.

The Home Warranty Assn. of California offers the following tips to locate 
problems in a home's electrical system and to ensure your family's safety: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keep a supply of the required-size fuses on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make certain that all fuses are tight. Glass screw-in fuses tend to become 
loose in warmer weather. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Periodically check to make certain all breakers are set in the "On" 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A professional service contractor should be contacted if you reset the 
panel after an outage and the lights and electrical outlets still fail to 
operate or if your outlets or panel become very hot or begin to spark. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ground fault protectors are used wherever electricity might come into 
contact with water. If your circuit breaker trips without apparent reason, 
check to make sure that the ground fault protectors are in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
"While regular maintenance can help prevent problems with electrical systems, 
homeowners can further protect themselves with a home warranty plan in the 
event repairs or replacements are needed," said Daniel J. Brinker, president of 
the Home Warranty Assn. of California.

DIMENSIONS DICTATE 'WORK TRIANGLE' PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY LANG, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We are having our kitchen remodeled. We know there are several ways 
in which the so-called "work triangle" can be arranged. Any special one you can 
recommend? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Every basic floor plan has its adherents, but there is almost unanimous 
agreement when it comes to kitchens. If you have a compact work triangle that 
eliminates cross traffic, you have a good plan that will prove the most 
satisfactory. The number of possible arrangements is limited by the dimensions 
of the room and the location of doors and windows to adjacent rooms. 
</P>
<P>
In an ideal work triangle, each major activity center is at one point of the 
triangle. Again ideally, the sides of the triangle should add up to somewhere 
between 12 and 24 feet. While this is not always possible, it can be roughly 
achieved in almost any shape kitchen, whether a U, an L or a corridor. 
</P>
<P>
In a one-wall kitchen, where all of the activity concerned is on a line, the 
units should not be strung out too far. Areas over 12 feet in length become too 
long to be efficient. You say you are having the kitchen remodeled, which means 
it probably is being done by a contractor. Don't neglect his advice, especially 
if he has been in business for some time. 
</P>
<P>
Not Certain About a Third Layer of Shingles 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have our roof covered with asphalt shingles. There are two layers of the 
same kind of shingles there already, but our local roofer says the roof deck is 
strong and will support a third layer. Should I believe him, even though I have 
read that only two layers of shingles are safe? 
</P>
<P>
A: If he is a licensed roofer, he should know whether the deck will support a 
third layer. However, just to be certain, check your local rules on 
construction. Some communities will not permit the use of a third layer of 
shingles. 
</P>
<P>
Turpentine a Good Wax-Removal Agent 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have an old bureau that is in pretty good condition except for what 
appears to be an accumulation of many layers of wax. I don't want to touch it 
until I am sure of what I am doing. Turpentine has been suggested as a good 
cleansing agent. Is it? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. It will take off the wax and prepare the surface for rewaxing or 
refinishing or whatever is necessary. You also can buy a commercial wax remover 
for the purpose.

EXCELLENCE WAS THE MEASURING STICK; 
</P>
<P>
AS DIRECTOR, KEVIN CONSEY SAW NEWPORT'S ART MUSEUM GROW FINANCIALLY AND 
CRITICALLY; NOW HE TAKES ON CHICAGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After six years as director of the Newport Harbor Art Museum, Kevin E. Consey, 
37, has moved on to become director of the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art, 
where he will lead a fund-raising and building campaign similar to one he 
initiated in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly director of the San Antonio Museum of Art, Consey led the Newport 
Beach museum through the boom-boom years -- a period of growth in financial 
clout as well as critical esteem. 
</P>
<P>
During Consey's tenure, the museum's annual budget increased from $600,000 to 
$1.7 million while exhibitions like "The Interpretive Link: Abstract Surrealism 
Into Abstract Expressionism" (1984) and "Chris Burden: A 20-Year Survey" (1988) 
moved the museum into major-league art museum circles. 
</P>
<P>
Consey presided over the selection of internationally renowned architect Renzo 
Piano and the birth of the $50-million capital campaign for a new museum 
building and endowment. Scheduled to open in 1992, the 87,000-square-foot 
building will sit on a 10-acre tract of land at the corner of Coast Highway and 
MacArthur Boulevard, donated by the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 8, the day before he left for Chicago, Consey sat down for a leisurely 
lunchtime interview about the Consey years at Newport Harbor. ("Oh bliss bliss 
bliss," he crowed after a bite of the appetizer at a favorite restaurant. "This 
is serious food.") 
</P>
<P>
He did establish some ground rules: He would not speculate about the museum's 
future or the identity of its yet-to-be-chosen new director. But otherwise, the 
feisty, opinionated cast of mind that characterized his tenure in Orange County 
was amply in evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why did you choose to come to Newport Harbor back in 1983? 
</P>
<P>
CONSEY: I think what struck me about Newport was that it was a relatively small 
museum and (yet) it seemed to have great opportunity and great potential. It 
seemed to have done amazing things for an institution that really had been run 
primarily with volunteers and one or two curatorial-type directors. 
</P>
<P>
I think there was a combination of good luck and basic good sense. And (the 
founding group of volunteers) . . . didn't hesitate to pick the brains of 
museum professionals who were working in Southern California for their advice 
and thoughts about what exhibitions to do. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Another thing that attracted me about the job is that there was a tremendous 
growth situation, and I think the museum's founders and trustees had become 
victims of their own success. They were wrestling with this issue of, "Is it a 
volunteer organization? Is it a professional organization?" and a lot of that 
bloodletting went on (for) four or five years before I arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Bloodletting? 
</P>
<P>
What I had heard was that there was continuous conflict between the director 
and members of the board about acquisition policy, exhibition policy -- things 
that today we accept as the province of professional staff. But it wasn't so 
clear then because the organization was far smaller. 
</P>
<P>
It was probably not unlike some of the conflicts one hears about at the Laguna 
Art Museum. I think part of it simply has to do with the evolution in a 
museum's history and its relative size, and how dependent one is on volunteers 
and how dependent one is on paid staff. 
</P>
<P>
The climate was such that the trustees accepted that they had to be a little 
more relaxed and invest more confidence in the director and the professional 
staff because (the museum) couldn't stand to lose a director very quickly 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Paul (Schimmel, the museum's chief curator) was here nine months before I was, 
and Ellen (Breitman, curator of education) was here and Richard (Tellinghuisen, 
director of operations) was here. Then Margie (Shackelford) was hired as 
development director, then Jane (Piasecki, associate director) and then about a 
year after that, Sue Henger (museum editor). 
</P>
<P>
So five years ago we had the senior staff intact, and it has stayed that way. 
That's pretty rare in my business, to have that type of stability. To have it 
in an entire senior management staff in a small institution is remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
But you seem to have kept rather aloof from the staff, even though nearly all 
of you are still in your 30s. 
</P>
<P>
I think probably my basic theory about that is that you have professional 
relationships and you have personal relationships. One tries to have mutually 
supportive and decent relationships with the people you work with, but there 
has to be -- if you're going to lead people -- a certain amount of 
dispassionate distance. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It was very hard to do in a small organization, 'cause these people are like 
family. And we're all the same age and share pretty much similar values. And I 
think in almost all cases our personal politics are very similar. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I don't know if it suits my personality or whether my personality changed to 
deal with it. But my cool, aloof Scottish heritage probably helped make it 
somewhat easier to deal with that type of internal conflict -- of really liking 
and respecting the people you work with but not being able to really 
demonstrate or act that out on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
Did you have a specific mission in mind for the museum when you came in? 
</P>
<P>
Well, I came because they said the museum was a contemporary art museum and 
wanted to stay that way. And they also said that maybe if we could cure the 
chronic financial troubles and actually raise some money, they would entertain 
the idea of a building program and an expansion program. 
</P>
<P>
But, God, it was going to take so many years to erase the deficit and increase 
the budget. I don't think anyone believed it would happen. (The deficit) was 
$58,000 or $59,000 on an operating budget of $600,000, so it was almost 10%. 
</P>
<P>
That was gone the first fiscal year, and in the second year our operating 
budget was over a million and we were doing a surplus. Suddenly I think the 
trustees were quite surprised that the organization had the potential that I 
certainly saw was there. They . . . had never quite managed to put together an 
effective working coalition with a director and a board to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
How did you erase the deficit? By finding grants? 
</P>
<P>
Initially, yeah, we spent a lot of time with the (National Endowment for the 
Arts). But also with the business community, which we really weren't paying a 
lot of attention to. . . . It was (the same time) the Performing Arts Center 
was gearing up its program, so we were going head-to-head with them. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, we were using the strategy that we had a proven product. We had 
history. The Performing Arts Center had none. If you're going to fund a center 
based on promise, you should be willing to fund an art museum based on a clear 
record of service and performance. And for better or worse it worked -- on a 
much, much smaller scale than the Center, but for us it was an enormous 
(boost), to increase our operating budget about 70% in one year. 
</P>
<P>
I think it gave a lot of the trustees and the staff confidence that one could 
have a stable organization, a good place to work, a good place to build a 
career and to do interesting things. In the second year, we began to 
consciously plan and think about a new building program and how we'd go about 
it and how we'd do long-range planning. The third year we engaged the Orem 
Group (a San Francisco-based consulting organization) to do a feasibility 
study, and the fourth year we started actually to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
So it was a slow, evolutionary process, which I guess now in retrospect seems 
very simple and very logical. I guess as I think back on it, it wasn't exactly 
as clear-cut and likely to succeed then. I remember months and months of 14- 
and 16-hour days, endlessly grinding away. I wasn't alone, of course. Margie, 
Jane, Richard were (also working very hard). 
</P>
<P>
You were all putting in the time to persuade the community that the museum was 
worth supporting. 
</P>
<P>
Convincing ourselves was as important as convincing others (that) a major 
museum was possible in Orange County. It's a matter of getting the institution 
to believe in itself -- the staff, the board and so forth -- which is 90% of 
getting the community to believe in an organization. 
</P>
<P>
The community looks to the trustees, who are responsible for the fiduciary 
health of the organization, to make (growth) happen. If (the trustees) don't 
believe it, then someone in the community will say: "Oh, Harry, you're on the 
board of the museum. You've got a building program going. What do you think of 
it?" And if they're hesitant, they say: "Well, maybe it's a little too 
ambitious." 
</P>
<P>
But to be able to say, "Oh, it's great, it's terrific. We're really going to 
get this done!" That's the difference between success and failure. It's what 
the Performing Arts Center did and what South Coast Rep does. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, it seems astonishing that this museum can exist in Orange County, 
because most people who say they care in some way about art don't seem to like 
the kind of art Newport shows. It seems that what you invented or created was 
social cachet -- a reason why wealthy people feel they should get involved with 
the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, I think to a certain extent we made it socially acceptable to like 
contemporary art in Orange County. I think if there's anything I'll take credit 
for, it's being able to do that without, for a single (moment), compromising 
the cutting edge or the abrasiveness or the controversial aspects of our 
exhibition program. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, on some levels we never played to the community. My sense had always 
been that the exhibitions we were going to work on and the education programs . 
. . simply took the approach, 'What does the sophisticated consumer in Southern 
California want?' 
</P>
<P>
Rather than the Orange County consumer, per se? 
</P>
<P>
Or what does the sophisticated Orange County consumer want. Basically my answer 
was: the same thing the sophisticated art connoisseur wants in London or 
Cologne or Chicago or Honolulu or Mexico City. My philosophy is, in the long 
run you never make a mistake by having excellence as your measuring stick. 
</P>
<P>
You may take it on the chin short-term. You may be charged with being elitist 
and incomprehensible and not giving the community what it wants. But I don't 
think a public educational institution is in the business of giving the public 
what it wants. I don't think that's my job. I think my job is to create a 
climate of artistic leadership. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the job of a historical museum is to make a statement: This is art. 
That's the job of the Met (Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York) or the Art 
Institute (in Chicago) or the Getty (Museum in Malibu). The job of a 
contemporary art museum is to ask the question, "Is this art?" And to put (the 
work) up for the public's consideration. I think we did a great job of doing 
that, but I think many people who are critics of contemporary art museums in 
general and Newport in particular probably don't understand that. 
</P>
<P>
A good analogy would be, it's the difference between an historian and a 
journalist. A journalist is in the thick of things, trying to sort out events 
as they're happening. A historian has the luxury of dispassionate distance, 
both physical and temporal, to make more informed judgments. We don't have the 
time to do that. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I think it all comes back to this notion of a sense of history; a sense of 
place. There was something very special about (museum founders and early 
members) Betty Winckler and Judy Hurndall and Betty Steele and Snoozy Ullman. 
These women were on the one hand very proper and very community-conscious about 
doing the right thing -- being basically good, upstanding citizens, good, 
conservative people in the apolitical sense of the word. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there was an intellectual curiosity they had that transcended the 
specificity of the political content of any work of art. They were bright, 
well-educated individuals who wanted their lives and the community's lives to 
be better, and thought contemporary art was an interesting way of doing it. And 
they attracted like-minded people. Now, the fact that their husbands happened 
to be leaders in the social or business or yachting community didn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
And so the museum, even in its earliest days, was socially prestigious. But 
(not because it showed) . . . cruise-control art. . . . It's very, very 
difficult to look at Robert Morris' themes of death and destruction (subject of 
a museum exhibit in 1986) or container jars stuffed with vegetables and labeled 
as fetuses (in the Chris Burden retrospective last year). 
</P>
<P>
That's stuff that many people come to Orange County to avoid, because they 
don't want to deal with the grit and stress of day-to-day life. Art is about 
social consciousness and changing the way people think about their world. . . . 
It's sort of ironic that Impressionist painting seems to be ever-lovable and 
popular in Orange County, yet the social equivalent of the Orange County lover 
of Impressionism (in the 19th Century) thought Impressionism was degenerate and 
disgusting. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I've chosen to run Newport as almost an anti-Establishment institution, but you 
know somehow I've managed to do it with the blessing, support and even 
enthusiasm of individuals who represent the Establishment in the county. 
</P>
<P>
But many of the artists the museum shows are blue-chip figures in terms of the 
art market. Collectors are eager to own their work. There's nothing 
particularly anti-Establishment in that. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly we're on the cutting edge, (but) we're not always there. We try to 
bring before the public a variety of things that are interesting and 
meaningful, either to the history of art in California or the history of art 
internationally. You can't be endlessly consistent doing that and expect the 
same texture from a Wayne Thiebaud show (shown at the museum in 1985) as from 
Robert Morris. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some trustees have voiced the opinion that the museum should 
show different kinds of work. 
</P>
<P>
There have been a number of trustees who believed -- and, I think, still 
believe -- that the museum would be much better off if it were much more 
catholic in its approach to art. They believe we should be a general-purpose 
museum or a modified version of that: a 20th-Century museum that's equally 
interested in the earlier part of the 20th-Century as in the latter part. 
</P>
<P>
On philosophical ground, I can't disagree with their right to hold that 
opinion. That's what they're there for -- to provide opinions and ideas about 
what the mission of the institution should be. But . . . we had either three or 
four formal votes in six years on this exact question: Should we (have a) 
broader focus or should we be a contemporary art museum? And I think the most 
radical vote was something like 24 to 3 about maintaining adherence to a 
contemporary art program. 
</P>
<P>
It's always been very, very clear to me that the will of the board has been to 
be a contemporary art museum. Fortunately, I had the good sense to ensure that 
that question got asked often enough to give the board the opportunity to 
(change course) -- and they never much wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
I think that's because they were individuals who, in their quiet -- sometimes 
quiet, sometimes idiosyncratic, sometimes very vocal -- way, are very 
passionate about contemporary art. Or, let's say they're very passionate about 
art in general, they're reasonably passionate about the Newport Harbor Art 
Museum and basically, they are impressed with their own roles in building a 
successful enterprise. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Newport's board has, I think, tolerated and respected my outspokenness very, 
very well. That's one of the reasons I've enjoyed working with them so much. I 
can't think of a single instance when it was ever suggested that I should be 
more diplomatic, more balanced and more reasonable -- less partisan. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I've never been -- what would be the right way of phrasing this? -- very, um, 
disclosure-oriented in my various and sundry jobs. I've not tried to pull any 
punches. . . . I was fairly up-front that I was a liberal New York Democrat, 
and (the board) seemed to be more interested in my managerial skills than 
anything else. We've had a good time jousting about it ever since. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I don't know about the strange encounter (this fall) with the Laguna Art Museum 
(about the possibility of some form of merger). . . . Without putting value 
judgments on it, it's not unlike saying the American public is one large public 
of car lovers, therefore we should merge all automobile companies together to 
gain marketing strength and (lower) prices and everybody will be happy since 
everybody loves cars. 
</P>
<P>
There is a real value in excelling in a particular area and wanting to be 
Tiffany's and not Sears. Or wanting to be Ford and not General Motors. . . . It 
seems to me the consumer benefits from choice, not from the McDonaldization of 
the art world. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Some people have said both museums might benefit financially from some kind of 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, well, so what? What do finances have to do with cultural institutions? I 
think it's the same unfortunate attitude driving the business world about the 
short-term balance sheet versus the long-term profitability of a corporation. 
The attitude that you go with what's going to be appealing and "profitable," 
and you're not investing in idiosyncratic behavior, in excellence. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to measure in dollars and cents the extra benefit gained from 
independence. We need to look at New York City or London (or any city) that has 
a variety of institutions dealing with contemporary art. Something is really 
gained when there is separation and independence of institutions. 
</P>
<P>
People talk abut financial benefit, but if people in Orange County gave to the 
arts and social services at anywhere near the rate the rest of America gives, 
there would be no need to have this discussion. Orange County (residents) could 
well afford to support four or five institutions the size of Newport if they 
chose to. But they choose not to. So the financial savings argument doesn't 
hold water for me. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of money, there is talk that the reason the museum isn't flaunting 
long lists of major donors to the campaign is that there isn't much to 
publicize. In August, board member Rogue Hemley said the campaign was "above 
the first 20%" of its goal, but we haven't heard any news since then. 
</P>
<P>
Well, I can't speak to the last six to eight weeks (when Consey was vacationing 
in Europe), but I would say there was a conscious decision to postpone raising 
funds between November and May-June, while design details were being worked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
It was pretty much based on the fact that (we wanted to wait) until we had a 
product we were sure worked -- and that we could come within 15 to 20% of 
predicting the cost of. Campaign chairman David Tappan wasn't thrilled with the 
idea of getting out and asking for money for a project whose cost was unknown. 
It's a valid point of view. I'm not sure I agree with it, but it was 
nevertheless a philosophy that was (followed). 
</P>
<P>
With one or two exceptions, we did not solicit individuals who were not on the 
board of trustees, so the museum's campaign committee really hasn't gone 
outside the museum family, (except for) foundations. 
</P>
<P>
I think, with one or two exceptions, I've been present for every solicitation 
for funds. And I do know that no one turned down a request. Everyone we asked 
made a contribution. Many of the contributions were higher than our 
expectations; several of them were lower. 
</P>
<P>
Whether (the campaign goal) is 20 or 25 or 30 million dollars, I think there's 
a real desire to be as responsible as possible. . . . We know it's probably 
inevitable that building costs escalate. . . . And you also have falling 
interest rates, which affect the amount of money you'll actually end up with 
from the endowment principal. . . . And the thought was, the closer you get in 
completing the design, the more accurately you're able to target it and avoid 
surprises later. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I believe that is the approach that Tappan and (Irvine Co. Vice Chairman Thomas 
H.) Nielsen are using, and I think it's one that will work. Again, I perceive 
no absence of confidence in (architect Renzo) Piano's design or in the board's 
or the community's interest in supporting the project, so I don't know why it 
wouldn't work. 
</P>
<P>
It must have been, shall we say, an interesting experience working with Irvine 
Co. Chairman Donald Bren, who is empowered to veto aspects of the design 
because his company donated the 10-acre parcel of land. One hears that he was 
dissatisfied with the wave-shaped roof that Piano originally conceived, 
obliging the architect to go back to the drawing board and produce an 
alternative version. Have other aspects of the design changed greatly as a 
result of Bren's prerogatives? 
</P>
<P>
That's a question I'm not going to answer. I'll only say that the design that 
the board approved in June (in which the wave design was replaced with barrel 
vaulting) is one that satisfactorily met the criteria of the museum's board, 
staff, the architect and the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
And I'll also state that I enthusiastically support the plan that was approved 
in June (even if) it wasn't my first choice. On the other hand, it's probably a 
credit to Renzo Piano that the second draft in many ways was as brilliant and 
interesting as the first. So let's say that while the process was not 
particularly pleasant, the end product was great. I have a feeling that if 
Renzo were asked to change the design a third time or a fourth time, he would 
probably come up with an equally interesting configuration. 
</P>
<P>
It's just a question of: What do you sign away when you accept a gift? How much 
independence do you have over something that is at the core of your institution 
-- its self-image? Different people have different philosophies about how 
important that is to an organization. It's a lot more important to me than it 
apparently is to other people. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the end result is to get a museum that works for art and for the 
public. How you arrive at it is more painful for some than for others, but it's 
basically the building that's going to endure in the end, whether the museum's 
board or the museum's staff or the architect or the Irvine Co. had a large 
amount or a little amount of influence. A major public building is a 
partnership of an architect, an institution and its donor base. To think 
otherwise in the late '80s is self-delusional. 
</P>
<P>
You will have a different situation in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The land we're dealing with in Chicago is public land. . . . Being a good, 
liberal Democrat, I've never believed in the difficulty of (working with) 
government. But I think in many ways the particular private company we were 
working with is a quasi-government anyway, in the sense that it has much of the 
power and prerogatives that a government entity would have. 
</P>
<P>
If someone asked you what one aspect of your tenure at Newport you wanted to be 
remembered by, would you say the hiring of Renzo Piano and the creation of the 
new building? 
</P>
<P>
No, I think it would be the excellence of the museum's staff. Basically, it's 
the people who make the difference. If I didn't have really smart and talented 
people, I never would have been in the position of hiring Piano and building 
the building. . . . The heart and soul of an institution are the people who 
work there. That's what I feel good about: A very, very stable and very 
competent staff. I can't think of a weak link. 
</P>
<P>
But you couldn't resist the big-city lure of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Who knows what precisely goes into a decision like this. One is that, yes, 
there's something very attractive about Chicago. . . . Probably, it's the 
biggest livable city in the country. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The quality of the collections that are owned by board members and close 
supporters (of the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art) is the best in the 
country, maybe with the exception of the (Museum of) Modern (Art, in New York), 
maybe not. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And then, of course, the same thing that attracted me to Newport attracted me 
there -- which is: "Why is it that a city with a metropolitan area of 7 or 8 
million has a contemporary art museum that is relatively small compared to the 
marketplace?" I think (Chicago's) answer is probably similar to Newport's. 
They've had a history of difficulty between directors and board. It probably 
had to do with the same maturation processes we went through. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In some sense, you ask yourself, what did you want to accomplish in Orange 
County, what did you accomplish, and what's left? And you know, for my money, 
almost everything I wanted to do, I did. . . . (The museum) developed a great 
reputation; we've done great programs, I had a very, very large degree of 
autonomy through most of my tenure. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Do you have any regrets at all? 
</P>
<P>
Well, obviously the regret is not being able to occupy the building you feel 
you conceived and carried through the first third of its labor. But on the 
other hand, I think the part of that job that I can really contribute to -- the 
basic conceptual organization, the relationship between the (building) program 
and the academic mission (of the museum), is done. I know very little about 
building supervision and all of that. So I'm not going to be missed on that 
end. Fund raising should be a board function anyway, and Dave Tappan and Tom 
Nielsen obviously have competence in that area. 
</P>
<P>
So when we came right down to it, I sort of figured one of the things not 
essential to the success of the museum was the director. Chicago was very 
aggressive in their pursuit of me. . . . It's not something I consciously 
thought about, like sometimes you say, "God, this is really getting stressful 
and unpleasant. Maybe I should start looking." My sense is that if Chicago 
hadn't actively sought me out, and if it wasn't such an interesting 
opportunity, I'd be perfectly happy here for another 10 years.

NEWPORT BEACH SCRUTINIZES CLUB'S LEASE ON GOOD LIFE

<P>
In a 1970 special election, the public disturbed the peace inside the exclusive 
Balboa Bay Club, a tony enclave that sits on about 13 acres of Grade A property 
owned by the city on Lido Channel. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members and club managers -- confident of victory at the polls -- 
were stunned by the results. A proposal to extend the club's lease with the 
city from 50 years to 55 years was overwhelmingly defeated by an almost 2-to-1 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
That special election nearly 20 years ago was the first time the public voted 
on the club's use of the city's land, but it might not be the last. 
</P>
<P>
Although some decisions affecting the Balboa Bay Club have remained on the 
council level, there is mounting concern within the city about whether the 
public should have a say again, at this key time in the social landmark's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The club -- which has become an upper-class fun zone for hundreds of Southern 
California's most powerful and famous people -- is now pushing for a second 
50-year lease with the city and has plans to grant more public access and 
completely renovate its facilities at 1221 W. Coast Highway. Its current rental 
agreement expires in 2011. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Evelyn R. Hart and Jean C. Watt say a new lease should go 
before the voters because of city charter provisions and because the city-owned 
site has been designated state tidelands. As such, the choice bay-front 
property occupied by the private club is held in trust by the city for the 
benefit of the public. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think the people should have a say in some very expensive property in 
the United States," Hart said. "It's a very valuable piece of land, and 50 
years is a very long time to give it to someone to use." 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Clarence J. Turner and John C. Cox Jr. say elected officials, not 
the public, should decide whether to develop and approve a new rental agreement 
for the club, which has about 4,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Phil Sansone and Mayor Donald A. Strauss remain undecided. 
Mayor Pro Tem Ruthelyn Plummer says she is ambivalent about who should approve 
the lease, but would agree to a public vote "to keep peace in the community." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, citizens who live near the club have mounted a petition drive asking 
for a special election on the lease. They say they are concerned about the 
renovation plan and that the club's rent is too low. One petition with 77 
signatures was turned into City Hall on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side, members and officials of Balboa Bay Club have mounted a 
public relations effort in an attempt to gain support for a new lease and the 
redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
Members have written letters to city officials, urging the council to proceed. 
Club managers have met with community associations. They too have sent mailers 
to the public criticizing Hart and asking citizens to sign petitions in support 
of the club's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Their mailer states that Hart has been lobbying against negotiations for a new 
lease agreement, "obstructing the city from proceeding in good faith." 
</P>
<P>
The issues surrounding a new rental agreement are scheduled to be debated Nov. 
27, when the City Council considers whether to begin lease discussions with the 
club and reappraise the property. 
</P>
<P>
To club officials, the start of negotiations is a top priority. They say they 
need a new long-term lease in order to obtain loans for a planned $60-million 
renovation of the club, which Councilman Cox has jokingly described as the 
city's biggest "tear-down" -- Newport parlance for a rundown beach dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
"A 50-year lease is the minimum necessary to get financing," said Balboa Bay 
Club President Tom Deemer. "Most banks require 75 years to 99 years. The lease 
is key to redeveloping the property." 
</P>
<P>
The Balboa Bay Club entered its first 50-year agreement with the city in 1948, 
when the Coast Highway site was little more than a stretch of debris-filled mud 
flats with docks and a few frame structures. The rent was $25,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the grounds have been improved dramatically and include a huge 
swimming pool, clubhouse facilities, hotel accommodations and a 145-unit 
apartment complex, now a second home to many of the county's elite. According 
to the city, the facility will generate more than $1.5 million a year in 
revenue for the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The city, however, has never done a detailed analysis of what uses of the land 
-- club included -- might be the most beneficial to the city, said former 
Councilman Hans Lorenz. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about voter involvement in the Balboa Bay Club first surfaced in 
1963, when the club indicated that it wanted to extend its lease by 15 years. 
Club attorneys concluded that under city law the extension could be granted 
without a vote of the people. 
</P>
<P>
The city charter states the city cannot sell or lease waterfront or beachfront 
property it owns unless approved by the voters. But the charter states that the 
provision shall not invalidate any leases in effect when the charter was 
adopted in 1955, or the future renewal of those leases. Club lawyers pointed 
out that the facility's first lease was signed in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Another charter provision states that the City Council cannot lease city land 
or extend a lease for more than 25 years without voter approval, unless 
improvements and buildings revert to the city at the end of the lease. Club 
attorneys pointed out that the extension was only for 15 years, therefore it 
didn't require a vote. Also, the buildings would revert to the city, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Then-City Atty. Walter Charamza in 1963 was more cautious. He leaned toward a 
public vote, to prevent the possibility of circumventing the charter by 
granting a series of leases or lease extensions that totaled more than 25 years 
but none of which alone totaled 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Charamza suggested that the city might want to ask a court to rule on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
The extension proposal was dropped and did not surface again until the late 
1960s, when the club sought a five-year extension and wanted to build two 
high-rise towers. Club attorneys reiterated their position, and then-City Atty. 
Tully Seymour, now a Superior Court judge, said the controversial matter should 
go to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was decisively defeated at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
"On the lease extension, the interpretation was unclear whether the Balboa Bay 
Club was exempt (from the city charter). We decided to put it on the ballot," 
said Lorenz, a council member in 1970. "No one thought there was much 
opposition, but it got clobbered." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the defeat was blamed on widespread anti-growth sentiment 
and public bitterness toward the club's new six-story apartment complex, which 
some opponents dubbed "The Great Wall of China." 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, then-City Atty. Dennis D. O'Neil again mulled over the legalities 
surrounding a possible lease extension. He noted the 1970 special election, but 
concluded that he did not believe the charter provisions required a public 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
The lease-extension issue lay dormant once again until 1986, when the council 
approved a 12-year extension and new lease conditions, including phased-in rent 
increases. A study by a city committee at the time concluded that rent for the 
club's site had been far below market value for years. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the City Council began considering negotiations for a new 50-year 
lease, but postponed a decision when questions were raised during a public 
hearing about the necessity for a public vote and whether use of city-owned 
tidelands for a private club was appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The city then obtained another legal opinion in May. It said the city might 
want to turn the matter over to the voters because of the "unique nature of the 
Balboa Bay Club." But the opinion stated that the council has the power to 
enter into a proposed lease with the club without voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
"The power rests with the council and we need to do our job," Councilman Turner 
said. "We are here to analyze complicated issues and make decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Also figuring in the debate over whether voters should have a say in the lease 
is a 1985 State Lands Commission determination that the club sits on tidelands 
and must be held in trust for the public's benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Curt Fossum, an attorney for the commission, said that under tidelands 
regulations the club eventually must provide the public with more access to the 
bay front and remove permanent residences in the 145-unit apartment complex. 
Club officials say their redevelopment plans address those changes. 
</P>
<P>
"The land is supposed to be used for the public benefit. That could be money or 
it could be something else," Councilwoman Watt said. "I think this should go to 
a vote of the public to let them decide." 
</P>
<P>
A group of citizens who say they are concerned about the club's rent and the 
potential impact of the club's redevelopment have circulated a petition calling 
for a public vote on the 50-year lease. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Eisendrath, a local real estate investor involved in the petition, said 
that the club has paid far less rent for its bay-front property compared to 
other tenants of city-owned land. 
</P>
<P>
Citing city figures, Eisendrath pointed out that the club pays $642,000 a year 
for 13 acres, while the Balboa Parking Lot pays $825,000 a year for 6.2 acres, 
and the Marina Trailer Park pays $506,000 a year for 4.9 acres. 
</P>
<P>
City and club officials say, however, that the club's rent will be increasing 
under terms of the lease approved in 1986, and the property will be reappraised 
if negotiations are approved for a 50-year lease. 
</P>
<P>
Balboa Bay Club opposes the petitioners and maintains that a public vote is not 
required on a new lease. Club Chairman William Ray contends the City Council 
clearly has the power to develop and approve a new lease. "I feel comfortable 
that it does," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure they'd like to avoid a vote for fear that it would go against them," 
Councilwoman Watt said of the private club. After all, former councilman Lorenz 
pointed out, a vote would pit the 4,000 club members against almost 80,000 
people who think they "gain no advantage" from the club.

Holding paper crosses bearing the names of six Jesuit priests murdered this 
week in San Salvador, about 700 people marched Saturday to MacArthur Park for a 
rally to protest the U.S. government's financial involvement in El Salvador's 
escalating civil war. 
</P>
<P>
The high turnout for the march was fueled by concern after a week of guerrilla 
warfare in El Salvador culminated in the murders of the priests. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the protest said the priests were killed by the army or 
right-wing death squads at the behest of the Salvadoran government, a charge 
the government has denied. 
</P>
<P>
Father Mike Crotty of St. Vincent's Church, and the Right Rev. Frederick 
Brosch, bishop of the Episcopalian diocese, were among the clergy at the rally.

BOAT PILOT LEFT HELM, SAY CRASH INVESTIGATORS

The pilot of a sportfishing boat had gone below deck and left no one at the 
helm just before a collision with a 564-foot tanker outside Los Angeles Harbor 
late Thursday night, Coast Guard officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Cmdr. Chris Desmond said 2nd Mate Tim Filson of the fishing boat 
Shogun was primarily to blame for the crash with the tanker Sealift Antarctic. 
He said Filson may have his operating license suspended. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard spokesman said Filson, 25, broke one of the "basic rules of 
navigation" by failing to keep a proper lookout before the crash, which injured 
seven people and spilled 2,000 gallons of jet fuel at the mouth of the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
But Desmond, head of the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office in Long Beach, said 
that both vessels were to blame and that Capt. Arthur Irish of the Antarctic 
could also have his license suspended for failing to give way to the smaller 
vessel. Desmond said the fishing boat had the right of way at the time of the 
crash.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: INJUSTICE EATS AWAY AT PLAINTIFFS WHO FILE SMALL CLAIMS

<TEXT>
<P>
In this pleasant suburb, the most intriguing story in years involves a man, a 
woman, and some edible underwear. 
</P>
<P>
It would seem that he left her for another woman. She claimed that he had moved 
out with some of her things. So she tromped down to the courthouse and swore 
out a complaint, spelling out each and every missing item. The edible underwear 
was high on her list. 
</P>
<P>
Grand drama is rarely found in the musty Manila files that fill many shelves in 
the Small Claims division of Orange County Municipal Court in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
But the furies and frustrations of daily life at the close of the 20th Century 
are amply documented. 
</P>
<P>
The stuff you buy that doesn't work, for one thing. A small businessman from 
Huntington Beach is suing a Beaumont software company for $2,000. "Defendant 
misrepresented this software program, stating it could do a part of my business 
that in fact it could not do," the complaint alleges. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the stuff just doesn't work out. One woman wants a refund for her 
new couch and love seat. She says the store told her it would break in, but six 
weeks later the couch is still hard and uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the things people won't pay for. A printer claims he made 
$736.01 worth of matches for a restaurant owner who now refuses to pay; a woman 
says she's owed $140 for baby-sitting her neighbor's kids; and a milk 
distributor is going after a Palmdale woman for a $148.65 milk bill. 
</P>
<P>
Automobiles account for a large chunk of the cases. Pity the plaintiff who 
alleges that after eight repair jobs, the car now does not run at all. 
Landlords are forever suing tenants for unpaid rent and damages, and tenants 
sue their landlords for not returning their security deposits. Car dealers, 
furniture stores, doctors and stereo shops also seem to suffer inordinately 
from deadbeats. 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes the sordid spats over money are elevated to the sublime. 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of Pets, Pets, Pets, a Huntington Beach partnership, versus the 
Irvine man who became the proud new owner of a chow. 
</P>
<P>
Pets alleges the dog was purchased with a $215 bad check. That was in May, Pets 
snarls in the complaint, and ever since, the owner has refused to make good. 
"Always insufficient funds," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Marcia J. Mass of Huntington Beach is suing a Garden Grove restaurant for $650. 
Her single sentence tells all: "Broken tooth from rock inside burrito." 
</P>
<P>
And Mr. Oliver Henry Roberts of Anaheim wants the judge to know he is of sound 
mind. According to his complaint, he paid $2,000 last June for a set of 
scratched and damaged bedroom furniture, which the furniture store allegedly 
agreed to replace. 
</P>
<P>
"All I get are excuses and put off a month at a time," he fumes. "Seller tells 
me that I am insecure!" 
</P>
<P>
Twelve thousand small claims cases pass through the court in Westminster every 
year -- and it is just one of five small claims courts in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"The people now are more determined," said Shirley Sterrett, a 30-year veteran 
who has patiently listened to more horror stories than most psychotherapists. 
"They've become more sophisticated as to what their rights are." 
</P>
<P>
Some plaintiffs become irate when told that clerks, by law, may not dispense 
legal advice, can't locate defendants for them, and won't help collect the 
judgments. Says Sterrett: "They think everything is like Judge Wapner." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the "People's Court" television judge, who forces warring parties to 
come right to the point, "in real court, the judges listen a lot," said the 
court's division manager for civil and small claims. "They let them go on and 
on." 
</P>
<P>
For every funny case, though, there's a pathetic one. 
</P>
<P>
A day-care center has sued a number of women for non-payment of their 
children's tuitions. No co-defendants appear on any of the forms. A Torrance 
man, the victim of an assault and battery, claims $2,000 for lost wages, 
medical bills and irreparable damage to his clothes. 
</P>
<P>
But most memorable are the folks who seek not money, but vindication. Small 
claims court supervisor Carol Kuzio remembers the case, three or four years 
back, of the man who sued over a postage stamp. 
</P>
<P>
And Sterrett recalls a 9-year-old paperboy whose distributor refused to pay him 
$1.57. The boy could barely see over the counter, but he wanted justice. 
</P>
<P>
"He had to have his father with him to file, so his father came in," said 
Sterrett. "He took a day off work to do it because it was so important to the 
boy." 
</P>
<P>
Sterrett and Kuzio sent the case of the edible underwear to Judge Wapner, and 
never learned how it turned out. 
</P>
<P>
But the paperboy won. 
</P>
<P>
SMALL CLAIMS FILING RULES* $6 to file a claim. 
</P>
<P>
* Claims up to $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Defendant must reside in the court district, or the transaction must have 
taken place in the district. Plaintiff's residence is irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
* No attorneys allowed.

DINKY THE RAT GIVES PUPILS LESSON ON DEATH, LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Compared to her street-dwelling cousins and country relatives, Dinky the rat 
has enjoyed a pampered life. 
</P>
<P>
As the class pet for Scott Leaman's third-grade students at Trabuco Mesa 
Elementary School, the brown-and-white rodent has lived two of her 2 1/2 years 
in an air-conditioned building with smooth, palm tree-lined walkways, carpeted 
classrooms and a spectacular view of the Saddleback Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Leaman, who brought Dinky to Orange County when he moved from Carlsbad to 
Rancho Santa Margarita, uses the gentle animal to teach his students about the 
responsibilities of caring for another living creature. Students take turns 
feeding him and cleaning the cage, and some are allowed to take Dinky home 
during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Dinky lived a quiet life, the object of affection and curiosity, until she 
developed two large, life-threatening tumors. 
</P>
<P>
Leaman said he was faced with the prospect of preparing the children for the 
death of something they loved. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid Dinky would have to be put to sleep," Leaman said. "I had to get 
the children ready for that, so I read them a story called 'Ten Good Things 
About Barney,' in which a cat dies and everyone talks about their good memories 
of him. 
</P>
<P>
"So we discussed the good things we would remember about Dinky," he said. "We 
also made a decision as a class about what to do with her, and agreed that we 
would do whatever the doctor said." 
</P>
<P>
"I was sad," said student Melissa Chapin, 8. "If she had to be put to sleep, we 
said it would be the best thing." 
</P>
<P>
The lesson never had to be learned. 
</P>
<P>
Local veterinarian Dr. Ron Kelpe was able to save Dinky by surgically removing 
a 1 1/2-inch tumor from her mammary glands and a 3/4-inch tumor from her neck, 
at no charge to the school district. 
</P>
<P>
After a nearly two-week convalescence, Dinky was recently returned to the 
classroom amid cheers from her pint-sized guardians, who share the chores of 
feeding their pet and cleaning her cage. 
</P>
<P>
"I see it, but I don't believe it," said Billy Glas, 8, yelling, "All right, 
buddy! 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a class pet before," Glas explained, his wide-eyed, freckled 
face turning serious. "She's one of the best rats I ever knew." 
</P>
<P>
Kelpe showed up for the reunion to give an impromptu science lesson, snipping 
Dinky's nine stitches as the students crowded around a table to watch. Some 
winced and asked why she didn't scream, but Kelpe assured them that their pal 
felt no pain. 
</P>
<P>
Dinky, on the other hand, sat calmly through the ordeal, twitching her whiskers 
as if it was an everyday occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, Dinky will actually lick your face," Kelpe said. "She is 
such a nice little rat." 
</P>
<P>
Now that she has recovered, Dinky is back in her glass cage on a countertop in 
the corner of Leaman's classroom, sitting under a huge computer-printed sign 
introducing her by her full title, "Dinky C. Reeboks." 
</P>
<P>
"The C stands for Chainsaw," Leaman said of the name concocted by his former 
elementary school students in Carlsbad, Dinky's classroom birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
"The boys all wanted Chainsaw and the girls wanted Reeboks," Leaman explained, 
laughing at the memory. "I liked Dinky the best, so we used all three names." 
</P>
<P>
Although Kelpe rated Dinky as "strong and healthy," he warned that the tumors 
could recur because they are common as rats near the end of their average 
three-year life span. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you were a rat, it would be a pretty good life," he said.

LUCK STRIKES SPINNER WITH $1 MILLION;

LOTTERY: A BUSINESS EXECUTIVE FROM BREA HITS THE JACKPOT WITH A SCRATCH-OFF 
TRIP TO BIG SPIN.

<P>
Dean Foley is confident that he will be more than able to face up to Uncle Sam 
when he comes for a chunk of his $1-million winnings from Saturday's Big Spin. 
</P>
<P>
Foley, a Brea resident and head of taxation for the food giant 
Beatrice/Hunt-Wesson in Fullerton, said he will stash most of his windfall in a 
variety of investments and a fund for early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Paying taxes on large winnings "are the kinds of problems you'd like to have," 
said Foley, one of 12 California Lottery scratch-off players who were whisked 
to the state capital for a turn of the big wheel Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Other than a promise to treat his daughter Jill to a long-hoped-for vacation in 
Ireland when she graduates from Cal State Long Beach next year, Foley said he 
has not made any other spending plans for the $40,000 he will receive each year 
for the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton-based corporate executive became the day's big winner when the 
ball bypassed slots that offered prizes from $10,000 to $100,000 and landed in 
the $1-million hole. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't really thinking about it," Foley said. "I would have been happy to 
get the $10,000." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Foley said, he was so numb from the thought of standing in front of an 
imposing bank of television cameras that he had trouble thinking about money at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking about how terrible I looked on TV," Foley joked minutes after 
he became a millionaire. "I was extremely nervous. Now I know why I am not 
working in TV." 
</P>
<P>
Foley said that the $1 million he won in the Big Spin is only the latest in an 
ongoing lucky streak. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, he said, he won big during a gambling trip to Las Vegas, although 
he declined to say how much he took home with him. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, he won $60 in the state lottery when he had four of the six 
numbers drawn. And last Wednesday, he collected five bucks for having three 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're on a streak, I guess there's no stopping you," Foley quipped 
before making plans for a night out on the town in Sacramento with Jill and his 
other daughter, Kim, both of whom accompanied him Friday from Brea. 
</P>
<P>
An avid lottery player, Foley learned that he was eligible for the Big Spin a 
week ago, not by watching the weekly Big Spin broadcast on KCOP-TV, but by 
neighbors, who called him to tell him that his name had been drawn. 
</P>
<P>
"It was chaos for the whole week" while he prepared for the trip to Sacramento, 
Foley said. It even affected his ability to concentrate on his duties at 
Beatrice foods. "They really didn't get much work out of me," he said, still 
breathless from the appearance, which was scheduled to be aired on Channel 13 
at 7 p.m. on Saturday. "They were all wishing me good luck." 
</P>
<P>
Foley picked up the scratch-off ticket that earned him a spin on the wheel from 
the Country Hill Liquor and Deli in Brea, where he spends up to $10 a week for 
a chance at winning money in the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
He sent the ticket in to lottery headquarters and then immediately forgot about 
it. The Monday after his name was drawn to appear on the Big Spin, he got a 
call from lottery officials. "Then I realized it was really happening," he 
said. "It feels pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Other winners were Cluster Christian of Running Springs, who won $60,000; Ralph 
Gallardo of Chino, Rodger Waples of Riverside and Manuel Ramirez of El Monte, 
who each won $50,000, said lottery spokesman John Schade. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Casetta of San Mateo, Maximino Cruz of San Jose and Tracey Reed of Los 
Angeles each received $40,000, Schade said.

ANTI-ABORTION GROUP MARCHES AT CLINIC;

PROTEST: PREGNANT WOMEN ENTER THE FACILITY, PASSING PROTESTERS OFFERING HELP, 
INCLUDING ADOPTION SERVICES.

Graphic anti-abortion posters carried by protesters outside a health clinic 
Saturday belied the gentle messages that some of the more than 200 participants 
quietly voiced to pregnant women coming and going during the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ever need any help, or if any of the gals you know ever need anything, 
you give us a call," said Rick, a sidewalk counselor for Operation Rescue (who 
withheld his surname), speaking in soft, earnest tones to a young woman as she 
was leaving the Family Planning Associates facility. He said that although the 
woman said she wasn't pregnant, he wanted to let her know that if she was, the 
group could offer whatever she needed -- a temporary home, medical care, 
counseling, parents to adopt her baby -- if she chose not to have an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was one of eight in Southern California to show solidarity 
with the D.C. Project, a three-day political and informational workshop for 
anti-abortion adherents in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people with homes who will take in a girl with an unwanted 
pregnancy, and they'll help her get on her feet again," said Le Ann John, a 
spokeswoman for Operation Rescue in Orange County. John was one of two 
spokesmen for the group on Saturday. "Right here, there are people who would 
adopt right now -- I'd take one (baby) in a minute." 
</P>
<P>
Father Leo John Celano, a teacher at St. Michael's Abbey in El Toro and the 
other official spokesperson for the group, said those picketing had been called 
upon by God to help prevent abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"We have actually been impelled by the Holy Spirit to join in solidarity to 
save the slaughter of the innocents. . . . These are crimes against humanity, 
and that's why we're here: to rescue those children who are being dragged to 
the slaughter." 
</P>
<P>
Celano led the group in prayer and blessings throughout the five hours of 
picketing, while other leaders of the group initiated prayer-like chants such 
as "Shut the Door, Keep Out the Devil." A few guitarists strummed as group 
members sang "Amazing Grace" and other songs. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 women entered the health facility on Chapman Avenue. Most were with 
boyfriends and few seemed interested in the Operation Rescue pickets. Some 
women whisked their cars into the driveway to avoid waiting pickets, while 
others accepted the handout literature and continued to their appointments. 
About eight Family Planning Associates security guards and two Orange police 
officers helped to escort a few of the more intimidated visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the facility on Saturday refused to comment on anything else 
relating to the event. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Cady, a spokeswoman for the National Organization for Women in Orange 
County, said the Orange County Pro-Choice Coalition chose not to counter the 
pickets. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that Operation Rescue hasn't really accomplished anything since its 
inception in California -- except to cost the taxpayers a lot of money," Cady 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old Mission Viejo High School senior named Dave (who asked to 
withhold his surname) was smoking a cigarette outside while he waited for his 
15-year-old girlfriend to have her abortion. The two have dated for about six 
months without using birth control, but Dave said that from now on, they would. 
</P>
<P>
"At least they're not violent or nothing," he said about the picketers. He said 
they were told that a group would be outside the facility the day his 
girlfriend was scheduled to have her abortion, and it worried them. "I didn't 
expect to see this many. . . . It's what she was afraid of most -- these 
people." 
</P>
<P>
A 20-year-old woman, who had just had an abortion and asked not to be 
identified, had tears in her eyes as she walked with her friends to their car. 
"They have no business telling anybody what to do with their lives," she said. 
"I think they can do a lot better things with their lives than aggravate people 
like this."

Blaise Bryant ran for 208 yards and two touchdowns Saturday, setting five 
school records along the way, and Iowa State held off Oklahoma State, 31-21, in 
the teams' Big Eight Conference final. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State's Mike Gundy completed 25 of 41 passes for 315 yards and three 
touchdowns, becoming the first player in conference history to throw for more 
than 2,000 yards in three seasons. He rallied the Cowboys (4-7 overall, 3-4 in 
Big Eight) in the fourth quarter, pulling them within 24-21, but a late drive 
ended on downs at Iowa State's 36 with 1:05 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Then Bryant, a transfer from Golden West College who had 33 carries, sealed the 
victory for Iowa State (6-5, 4-3) with a 1-yard touchdown run that came one 
play after he ran 62 yards on a delay. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant finished the season with 1,516 yards rushing, surpassing the school 
record of 1,312 set by Dwayne Crutchfield in 1981. He also set school records 
with 19 touchdowns, seven 100-yard games, 120 points and 1,718 all-purpose 
yards.

EDISON'S TAYLOR UP TO LATEST CHALLENGE, CAPTURES 4-A TITLE

There may come a time when Shelley Taylor of Edison High School realizes that 
she has become one of the finest female distance runners in Orange County 
history. In only her second year of competition, she has accomplished more than 
most runners her age dare dream. 
</P>
<P>
But now, Taylor seems content with running, winning and heaping praise on the 
few who have been able to challenge her this season. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case on Saturday at the Southern Section cross-country 
championships at Mt. San Antonio College. In the girls' 4-A final, Taylor met 
Westlake junior Jeannie Rothman. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rothman pushed her the entire three miles, Taylor had the strength to 
pull away in the final 200 yards to win by two seconds and remain unbeaten this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
But Taylor seemed less impressed with her performance than with Rothman's. 
</P>
<P>
"Gosh, she ran one heck of a race," Taylor said. "She was breathing so hard. I 
mean she really hung in there. What a great race she ran. I really envy her for 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Envy? Taylor was asked if she remembered that it was she, not Rothman, who had 
won the race. 
</P>
<P>
"Well . . . you know . . . I don't think I run well unless I feel good," she 
said. "And I didn't feel that good today." 
</P>
<P>
It's doubtful that those who finished behind Taylor felt much better. 
</P>
<P>
As the race started, Jennie Logan of Wilson immediately opened a 20-yard lead 
on the front-running pack that included Taylor, University's Tanja Brix, Villa 
Park's Susannah Thrasher, Katella's Martha Pinto and Terri Smythers of San 
Clemente. Although Logan led through the first mile, the pack caught her and 
soon left her behind. 
</P>
<P>
Up the switchbacks, the pack began to string out with Taylor taking the lead 
and Rothman a step or two behind. Through the next 1 1/2 miles, Taylor set the 
pace while Rothman struggled but managed to hang on. 
</P>
<P>
"She made me really nervous," Taylor said. "I really was surprised, because 
when I started to take off, I felt her drop a little, but then she came back. 
I'm not used to people being that close to me, so I wasn't as relaxed as I 
should've been." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the two hit the air strip portion of the course, about 300 
yards from the finish, that Taylor made her final move. It was not her usual 
devastating kick, but it was enough to win in 17 minutes 59 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman (18:01) was followed by Brix (18:22), Pinto (18:43) and Thrasher 
(18:48), all of whom qualified for Saturday's state meet at Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
In the team competition, San Clemente fared best among county teams, taking 
third in the 4-A with 137 points. Palos Verdes won its fifth consecutive title 
with 51 and Buena was second with 72. Corona del Mar, fifth with 158, will 
advance to the state meet in the medium-schools division. El Toro was sixth 
(161), Capistrano Valley eighth (199), El Modena ninth (209) and Tustin 12th 
(230). 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A, Woodbridge, competing without two of its top runners -- Kaci Keffer 
(bronchitis) and Kim Tardif (stress fracture) -- finished third behind Agoura 
and Arroyo Grande. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1-A, Santa Margarita, in its first year of varsity competition, placed 
third with 109 points. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Although Shelley Taylor's time in winning the Mt. SAC Invitational last month 
was not her best on the course -- she finished in 17:50, the fourth-fastest 
time for any sophomore girl and the third-fastest in Orange County history -- 
it was enough to earn her the first sectional title for a county girl since 
1981, when University's Polly Plumer (4-A) and Sonora's Lesley White (3-A) did 
it. Plumer (17:27) and University's Teresa Barrios (17:43) are the only county 
girls who have run faster than Taylor at Mt. SAC. The girls' course record is 
17:16 set in 1983 by Kirsten O'Hara. . . . La Habra's Tish Williams is it 
qualified for the state meet by placing fifth in the 3-A in 19:07.

SADDLEBACK IS SECOND IN 4-A FINAL

After a nerve-wracking week, Mel Silva looked refreshed, rejuvenated and very 
much relieved after watching his Saddleback High School boys' team run to a 
second-place finish at the Southern Section 4-A cross-country championships 
Saturday at Mt. SAC. 
</P>
<P>
Although Camarillo, the 4-A's top-ranked team, came away with the title after 
placing five runners in the top 16, good for 56 points, Saddleback defended its 
No. 1 ranking among Orange County teams. The Roadrunners had 103 points; San 
Clemente was third with 118. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley finished sixth (166), Santa Ana seventh (168), two-time 
defending champion Dana Hills ninth (189) and Villa Park (263) 12th. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very nervous, very, very nervous," Silva said. "I told the kids, 
'Maintain on the hills, and just attack on the downhills.' That's what they 
did." 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday in the Southern Section preliminaries, San Clemente, the county's 
No. 2-ranked team, edged Saddleback, 62-96, to win its heat. But Saddleback was 
running at that time without one of its top five, sophomore Joey Heredia, whose 
father died last week. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Heredia rejoined the team, placing 32nd overall after teammates Eddie 
Salinas (10th, 15:32), Rob Price (15th, 15:45) and Albert Ochoa (25th, 16:21. 
Elias Gil (34th, 16:32) rounded out the Roadrunner top five. 
</P>
<P>
"Joey wanted to run this race real well for his dad, and the whole team wanted 
to help him out that way," Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids . . . they're . . . they're . . . they're so tough." 
</P>
<P>
And they're not finished yet. Saddleback, which before Saturday had never run 
in a Southern Section final, qualified for Saturday's state championships at 
Frenso, as did San Clemente. The two schools will represent the Southern 
Section along with Camarillo, Hart and Agoura in the large schools division. 
</P>
<P>
In the race for the best county individual, Dana Hills' Daniel Niednagel and 
San Clemente's Mike Farrell again staged their one-on-one duel, with 
Saddleback's Salinas trying to keep them both in check. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the race, Niednagel had a 2-1 edge on Farrell this season. Saturday, 
Niednagel placed seventh overall in 15:24, two places ahead of Farrell (15:30). 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Niednagel, it wasn't quite fast enough for a berth at the 
state meet, which he could have earned as an individual had he been among the 
five fastest overall runners in the state's large schools division (enrollment 
1,600 and up). 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I want to go to state, but the season's been so long," Niednagel, a 
junior, said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Farrell who, unlike most of the top 10 finishers, started the race 
conservatively, at mid-pack: "I was trying to work my way up. I had my eye on 
him (Niednagel). I should've beat him, but he just got away from me today. . . 
. I'm not disappointed, though. He just had a better race than me." 
</P>
<P>
And besides, Farrell's going to Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach, led by David Crain (ninth, 16:05), placed fourth in the 2-A 
division and will advance to the state meet in the small schools (under 700 
enrollment) division. . . . Trabuco Hills' Mike Cowdrey (sixth in 16:00) also 
qualified, as did Mark Gonzales of La Habra, 10th in the 3-A race in 16:07. 
Gonzales' teammate, Tim Mahon, placed 11th, narrowly missing a state qualifying 
berth. . . . In the 1-A, Whittier Christian was third and Santa Margarita 
seventh.

Corona del Mar Coach John Vargas was overcome with emotion after his Sea Kings 
had defeated El Dorado, 7-6, on Saturday to reach the Southern Section 4-A 
water polo final. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best possible feeling," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The best? 
</P>
<P>
"Well . . . if you want to get technical, the second best," said Vargas, 
grinning. 
</P>
<P>
The best would come on Wednesday, if the Sea Kings can beat Villa Park in the 
final. But for now, Vargas will be happy with what he's got. 
</P>
<P>
It's the sixth consecutive season that the Sea Kings have reached the final. 
They have won two consecutive championships and three of the past four. 
</P>
<P>
This time, though, getting there was a problem. Corona del Mar (27-3) had lost 
twice to El Dorado during the regular season, including the final of the 
California state tournament at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
In both of those games, Corona del Mar had opportunities and had failed to 
capitalize. This time, it was El Dorado (25-4), the No. 1 seeded team, which 
let chances get away. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings rallied from a 2-0 deficit to take a 4-2 halftime lead. But in 
the third quarter, the Golden Hawks put on the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Maclear scored with less than a minute gone in the second half to cut the 
Sea Kings' lead to 4-3. El Dorado then had three chances to score, but came 
away with nothing. 
</P>
<P>
With a man advantage, the Golden Hawks worked the ball in close to Larry Felix, 
but his shot was blocked by goalie Rob Pike. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Hawks were again on the attack with a man advantage. This time, 
however, bad luck denied them. 
</P>
<P>
First, Kyle Utsumi beat Pike to the left, but his shot hit the post. El Dorado 
got the rebound and worked the ball around to the left wing, but Jim Leonard's 
shot hit the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Leonard hit the post with another shot. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings weathered the attacks and then scored two goals to take a 6-3 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our chances, we just didn't cash them in," El Dorado Coach John Bowman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And the Golden Hawks would keep getting them. In the fourth quarter, Utsumi 
scored two goals in 23 seconds to get El Dorado within 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Hawks had two chances to tie. The first shot, by Greg Milton, hit 
the post, and the second, by Maclear, was blocked by Pike. 
</P>
<P>
Pike finished with 10 saves, seven in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a perfect example of team defense," Vargas said. "Everybody worked 
together and helped each other." 
</P>
<P>
In the teams' first two encounters, the Sea Kings had trouble holding onto the 
ball against the Golden Hawk defense. Corona del Mar turned the ball over five 
times in the first quarter and only took one shot. 
</P>
<P>
However, El Dorado led only 1-0 after the first quarter, on a goal by Maclear. 
The Golden Hawks missed three open shots and three others were blocked by Pike. 
</P>
<P>
"Being down only one goal was a blessing," Vargas said. "I think we were too up 
for this game. I told the kids to move around more, and that helped settle them 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar did, scoring four goals in the second quarter. Ryan Weir, who 
had four goals in the game, and Gunnar Gustafson each scored two in the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings then turned away the Golden Hawks in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great," Vargas said. 
</P>
<P>
But not the best, technically. Not yet. 
</P>
<P>
In the other 4-A semifinal: 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park 8, Sunny Hills 5 -- The Spartans (25-4) reached the final for the 
first time in six years with a victory at Newport Harbor High School. Villa 
Park had been eliminated in the quarterfinals every year since reaching the 3-A 
championship game in 1982. Gavin Arroyo scored four goals, including one with 
3:14 left, to give the Spartans a 7-4 lead. Villa Park led, 4-1, at halftime, 
but Sunny Hills (20-9) got within 4-3 in the third quarter. Gary Larson and 
Neal Brockmeier each had two goals for Villa Park.

UC Irvine, ranked No. 2 in the nation, stopped a UC Santa Barbara rally to win 
its final Big West Conference water polo match of the season, 13-11, Saturday 
at Goleta, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Down 10-4 in the third quarter, Santa Barbara (10-18, 3-7) scored three 
consecutive goals to tie the match, 10-10. The Anteaters' Dan Smoot, who led 
all scorers with six goals, then scored two consecutive goals, the last with 
4:15 remaining. Seconds later Santa Barbara's Brian Ballard scored to make it 
12-11. 
</P>
<P>
A steal by Irvine's John Redd with 15 seconds remaining led to a goal by Tom 
Warde that assured the victory for the Anteaters (24-6 overall, 8-2 in the 
conference). 
</P>

<P>
On a night when "punt team get ready" frequently echoed through Santa Ana 
Stadium, Rancho Santiago College managed an 8-7 victory over Orange Coast in a 
Mission Conference football game in front of about 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast punted 12 times and Rancho Santiago 10, and neither team scored in 
the first three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 7-0, Rancho Santiago finally scored on a one-yard run by Estrus 
Crayton with 2:24 left in the game. The Dons then went for the victory. Crayton 
caught a short pass in the right flat and crossed into the end zone behind a 
block by Paul Peters to give the Dons the 8-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Soares and Mark Maldonado both had interceptions in the final minute to 
sew it up for Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
The winning score was set up on a 39-yard pass from from Scott Wood to Peters 
to get the ball to the OCC four. But the drive was set up by -- what else? -- a 
punt. 
</P>
<P>
First, Rancho Santiago's Mike Noble punted 41 yards, pinning OCC on its own 
five. Three plays netted just five yards, and OCC was forced to punt it back. 
</P>
<P>
Tommee Walker punted to the Rancho Santiago 45, but Peters returned it 12 yards 
to the OCC 43, setting up the key pass play. Noble averaged 37.5 yards on his 
10 punts, and Walker had a 35.1 average in his 12 tries. 
</P>
<P>
The victory give Rancho Santiago a 9-1 overall record and its best season since 
1962, when the Dons were 10-0. Rancho was 8-1 in conference and 4-1 in Central 
Division play. Rancho Santiago appeared headed for the Orange County Bowl Dec. 
2. Bowl bids will go out today. 
</P>
<P>
For the first three quarters neither team did much offensively, but each did 
miss a field goal. Rancho Santiago's offense finally started to move and got to 
the OCC 15, where the drive stalled, and Scott Feldman came on to try a 22-yard 
field goal attempt early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But OCC's Joe Hester broke through the middle and blocked it. Morris Turner 
picked the ball up at the OCC 39 and ran 61 yards for a touchdown with 11:32 
left in the game. Chris Sekeres added the extra point to give OCC the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Crayton rushed for 95 yards and Peters had nine catches for 113 yards to lead 
an otherwise struggling Rancho Santiago offense. The Dons came in averaging 430 
yards a game and had only 289. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't execute and haven't done so for two weeks," Rancho Santiago Coach 
Dave Ogas said. "We didn't block and just weren't very crisp . . . But I'll 
take 9-1 that is like a dream season for me." 
</P>
<P>
In other Central Division games; 
</P>
<P>
Riverside 30, Golden West 24 -- The Tigers finish 10-0 and will play El Camino 
(10-0) Dec. 2 in the 7 p.m. game at the Orange County Bowl at Orange Coast 
College. El Camino is ranked second in the J.C. Gridwire national poll, and 
Riverside is third. The teams tied for the Mission Conference title. El Camino 
won the Northern Division, Riverside won the Central Division and Palomar won 
the Southern Division and will host the National Football Foundation and Hall 
of Fame Bowl also Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 47, Saddleback 13 -- Jeff Andrews rushed for 87 yards and a touchdown 
to help Fullerton (6-4, 5-4, 3-2) win at home. Andrews ends his career as the 
leading all-time rusher with 2,403 yards. Quarterback David Chisum was 15 of 24 
for 216 yards and two touchdowns. He passed for the 2,179 yards this season, 
the second highest single-season total at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
John Burns rushed for 87 yards for Saddleback (1-9, 1-8, 0-5), giving him 1,022 
this season.

AVOCADO GROWERS FEELING THE PINCH FROM CROP THIEVES; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: PILFERING IS BOLDER, MORE ORGANIZED. THE CROOKS ADD TO WOES OF 
GROWERS ALREADY IN TROUBLE AFTER SUCCESSIVE WINTER FREEZES AND A HEAT WAVE THAT 
RAISED PRICES.

<P>
It was no Brinks robbery. No gold, gems or greenbacks were involved in the 
heist. But the cargo was valuable enough for bandits last February to hijack a 
truck at gunpoint and knock its driver unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
The scene of the crime was a remote road in the Valley Center area of North San 
Diego County. And the bounty was about 10,000 pounds of avocados. 
</P>
<P>
The case is just one of scores reported by growers in Southern California this 
year as the price of avocados has soared due to poor weather. The pear-shaped 
fruit has attracted thieves -- more organized than ever -- intent on cashing in 
big with the dark-green, delicious goods. 
</P>
<P>
"In days gone by there was a little petty thievery by workers. It has now 
become a very organized kind of effort," said Warren Currier, executive 
secretary of the Avocado Growers Assn. in Fallbrook, a town in North San Diego 
County that is a major avocado producer. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is costing California avocado growers an estimated $10 million a 
year at least. And it has caught the attention of the California Avocado 
Commission in Santa Ana, which has allocated $268,000 this year for a program 
to try to alert law enforcement agencies to the seriousness of avocado theft 
and cut off the marketing outlets for the stolen fruit. 
</P>
<P>
With 74,600 acres of avocado groves and about 6,500 growers, California 
produces about 90% of the nation's avocados, with an annual value of $200 
million. Irvine Ranch in South Orange County has the state's largest avocado 
grove with 1,250 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Successive winter freezes have stunted the state's yield of avocados for two 
years. If that wasn't enough, a searing heat wave last April hit the tender 
young fruit. As a result the next 12-month avocado harvest is expected to be 
even more meager, about 23% smaller than the 324 million pounds produced in the 
growing year that just ended Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
The scarce supply has boosted prices that avocado growers get for the fruit 
from an average of almost 17 cents a pound in the 1986-1987 growing year to an 
average of 62 cents in the latest year. As the avocado harvest winds down, 
wholesalers now have been paying as much as $1.60 a pound and supermarkets 
selling them for up to $1.69 each. 
</P>
<P>
But increasingly, avocado growers are losing profits to rustlers, who for two 
years have been busily plundering the largely unprotected avocado groves in the 
coastal hills stretching from San Luis Obispo through Orange County to the 
Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
The thieves usually come at night or on weekends. They pick as much fruit as 
they can reach, stuff it into burlap bags and wait for it to be hauled away by 
a passing vehicle, according to law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Or they may not bother to pick at all. In the evening they may simply help 
themselves to the bins of avocados that pickers have filled and placed on the 
roadside to be trucked to packing houses. 
</P>
<P>
Often the next day footprints, tire tread marks, holes cut into fences, broken 
irrigation pipes, discarded flashlights, an occasional pile of avocados missed 
in the dark or empty bins are telltale signs of the thieves' work. 
</P>
<P>
The stolen avocados then are sold at a substantial discount to restaurants, 
road stands, packing houses and fruit brokers, say growers and law enforcement 
authorities. Among those thought most likely to be dealing in stolen avocados 
are brokers and packing houses that offer to pay cash for the produce, thus 
leaving no record of who sold it to them. 
</P>
<P>
Reuben Hofshi, a grower, grove manager and co-owner of the Del Rey Avocado 
packing house in Fallbrook, figures that even if a thief, who must take a 50% 
discount when he sells his avocado loot, a few weeks ago could have pocketed 
$150 for an hour of picking. 
</P>
<P>
While avocado theft has reared its head previously when avocado prices rise, 
industry observers say that this time the thieves seem to be much more 
organized. "There is a larger-scale operation going on," said Robert Siemer, 
also a part owner at Del Rey Avocado. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1,500 pounds of avocados disappeared from a cooler at Bear Creek 
Ranch in Fallbrook and some of the fruit was discovered in a packing company 
truck at the Los Angeles Wholesale Produce Market, still nestled in boxes 
sporting Bear Creek Ranch labels. 
</P>
<P>
"We now believe a larger network of thieves is involved," said Lt. William 
Flores, commander of the San Diego County sheriff's substation in Fallbrook 
that has been spurred by the Bear Creek incident to conduct a larger 
investigation of organized avocado theft. 
</P>
<P>
Avocado industry officials say there is no way of knowing exactly how many 
avocados have been stolen and resold. Estimates of grove yields are imprecise 
and many avocado thefts aren't reported or go undetected, according to growers 
and law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said that in the past two years his office has recorded 18 avocado 
thefts in Fallbrook. But he said he suspects "many more go unreported" and that 
some avocado thiefs are prosecuted for crimes that are easier to prove, such as 
for stealing a pickup truck or for drug offenses. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's substation in Vista, another avocado-growing area in North San 
Diego County, has received about 50 reports of avocado theft in the past 12 
months, a patrol sergeant there estimated. And the nearby Valley Center 
sheriff's substation arrested 11 avocado theft suspects in the last picking 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Avi Crane, industry affairs director for the California Avocado Commission, an 
organization created by the state Legislature in 1978 to help avocado growers 
jointly promote avocado consumption, said a survey of state growers last year 
showed that at least 5% of the crop's value was lost to theft. At that rate, he 
said, the avocado industry in California was robbed of $10 million during the 
last year. He added that he thought that estimate was low. 
</P>
<P>
Groves suffering the greatest losses from theft tend to be owned by people who 
live and work in the city and thus can't keep a close watch on them. "The 
percent of absentee owners in the avocado industry is higher than for any other 
commodity in California," Crane said. He estimates that "a couple hundred" 
residents of Orange County, which has lost most of its avocado groves to 
housing tracts over the past 20 years, own avocado ranches in surrounding 
counties that are less developed. 
</P>
<P>
But even some growers who reside in houses on their groves say they have been 
plagued by repeated pilfering. 
</P>
<P>
Al Vangelos, president of CALAVO Growers, a Tustin-based cooperative of 2,500 
California avocado growers, said: "I have had growers call me and tell me they 
literally lost everything. One grower said he had lost about 20 acres over a 
period of a year. He felt helpless." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Hendrick, a retired engineer who with his wife owns an avocado ranch in 
Temecula, a city in the Santa Rosa Mountains of southwest Riverside County, 
estimates that in the past growing year he lost $10,000 in potential profits to 
thieves who probably entered his property on weekends when the grove manager is 
off duty. 
</P>
<P>
He said that earlier in the year the head of the picking crew and a packing 
house representative toured his grove, looked at the avocados on its trees and 
estimated it would would yield 20 bins. But when it came time for his crew to 
harvest, "they went in to pick and came out with one bin," Hendrick said. "It 
kind of burns you up." 
</P>
<P>
John Bartlett of Valley Center is one of a few growers who have managed to 
catch thieves red-handed on their property. He recollects that on a Wednesday 
evening last April he was taking an evening jog with his two dogs when the dogs 
darted into a group of trees. 
</P>
<P>
He said when he followed, "two pickers dropped out of the trees and ran. I also 
saw a third." His wife summoned the sheriff, who caught two of the three 
trespassers. They were convicted of theft and sentenced to 60 days in jail, 
Bartlett said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in July, Bartlett said, he traced tire tracks along his grove to a car 
that was filled with 400 pounds of avocados in the trunk and back seat. He said 
the authorities "impounded the car but lost the pickers. They got away." The 
very next day, he said, he found more fresh car tracks in his grove. 
</P>
<P>
"I've become an excellent tracker," Bartlett said dourly. Nonetheless, he 
estimates that this year thieves got away with 1,000 to 2,000 pounds of his 
avocados. 
</P>
<P>
Growers in San Diego and Riverside counties frequently complain that the law 
enforcement system there doesn't take avocado stealing seriously. Not enough 
avocado thieves are arrested, they say, and those who are prosecuted frequently 
receive light punishment. Under the state criminal code, the stealing of 
avocados worth more than $100 is a grand theft that can be prosecuted as a 
misdemeanor or felony. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Smith, a grove manager in Temecula, said he and a friend on the evening 
of July 17, 1988, heard suspicious noises and saw a truck inside a neighboring 
avocado grove. He said the two men then armed themselves with 12-gauge 
shotguns, arrested the suspects and turned them in to the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith said he had difficulty persuading the sheriff's deputies to press the 
case. He said he couldn't immediately determine who owned the grove and the 
deputies advised him him that without a victim to file charges, there was no 
case. "I got the feeling they thought there were more important things to do," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officers concede that avocado thieves are not often apprehended 
because of a host of factors, including the difficulty of locating absentee 
grove owners and of patrolling many square miles of unpopulated orchards. 
</P>
<P>
Some grove managers say they believe that some workers who are hired to pick 
avocados for a grove owner at the same time may be setting aside a portion for 
themselves. Honest workers are often afraid to turn in the dishonest, they say, 
because of threats of violence. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my personal view that the largest amount of fruit lost is embezzled by 
people legally on the" grove, contends Currier of the Avocado Growers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to stem the avocado industry's theft losses, the California 
Avocado Commission this year launched a program aimed at shutting down the 
market for stolen avocados. The program, which will also provide monetary 
rewards for information leading to the arrest of avocado thieves and seek to 
obtain more vigorous law enforcement, is paid for from an annual assessment 
fund on growers' avocado sales. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's new anti-theft program has expanded the scope of the state's 
longstanding consumer protection program for inspecting packing houses to make 
certain that avocados have been certified for proper weight and ripeness. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with a four-month pilot program that was launched in July, the state 
Department of Food and Agriculture's division of inspection services has also 
been sending field representatives to restaurants, roadside fruit stands, 
farmers markets and fruit brokers to hunt for avocados that are not properly 
certified or receipted. 
</P>
<P>
Donella Boreham, who supervises the state's anti-theft program, said that, by 
state law, anyone who buys or transports avocados must have proof of ownership 
in the form of a receipt that shows where the fruit was purchased. If such a 
receipt can't be produced, she said, chances are good that the avocados were 
stolen and the state can confiscate them. 
</P>
<P>
The threat of confiscation is hoped to deter restaurants and other businesses 
from buying -- purposefully or unwittingly -- hot avocados. Between July 1, 
when the anti-theft inspection pilot program started, and Oct. 21, 12,765 
pounds of avocados were confiscated and discarded or distributed to charities, 
Boreham said. 
</P>
<P>
While avocado growers say they welcome the new marketplace inspection program, 
they generally concede it won't solve the problem of theft. Just six state 
inspectors are assigned to Southern California, a number that soon will 
increase to seven as a result of an additional allocation from the Avocado 
Commission. And the inspection program does nothing about arresting avocado 
thieves. 
</P>
<P>
Some avocado industry officials praise a special task force set up by the 
Ventura County Sheriff's Department for catching and prosecuting thieves and 
suggest it as a model that could be duplicated by other avocado growing 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County sheriff's Sgt. Ken Cozzens, who was instrumental in establishing 
the task force in 1985, said it is based on close cooperation among growers, 
the Sheriff's Department, the farm bureau, the agriculture commissioner and the 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Cozzens said that while other fruit such as lemons and oranges have also been 
stolen from groves, "the big target has been avocados" because of their greater 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Cozzens said the entire legal system in Ventura County has become determined to 
catch and punish avocado thieves. "We have sent guys to state prison for three 
years for theft of avocados," he said. He also said that in the Santa Clara 
Valley, which is his enforcement area, avocado theft seems to have abated 
significantly with the program. 
</P>
<P>
Still, as California's avocado growers prepare for a new growing year, they are 
putting up more chain link fences topped by barbed wire. Some are also hiring 
private security guards. Carl Lindgren, general manager for Treasure Farms, a 
farming company that operates the grove on land leased from the Irvine Co., 
said that while thefts have been limited in his grove, he plans to beef up 
night patrolling because of the anticipated short crop this coming year. 
</P>
<P>
This year more growers are also saying they will harvest as soon as possible, 
rather than let their avocados hang on tree limbs longer while they collect 
weight and size that adds to their value. 
</P>
<P>
"Some are talking about picking early so there will be no fruit there for the 
thieves to take," a grove manager said.
