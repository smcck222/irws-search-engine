A WARNING TO DEFENSE COMPANIES; 
</P>
<P>
ANGRY JURY SENDS A $45-MILLION MESSAGE ABOUT MILITARY PRODUCT SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raising ethical questions on the job is never easy, but it sure is the right 
thing to do when it involves the potential safety of our armed forces. Or so 
thought a conscientious Los Angeles jury, which has put the entire defense 
industry on notice that companies must allow their employees to raise 
product-safety questions without fear of losing their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The Calabasas-based Lockheed Corp. apparently didn't. So jurors sent their 
message through a verdict handed down in the case of three Lockheed employees 
who were fired in 1985 after raising questions about the C-5B cargo jets the 
company was building for the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
The three former employees, Clyde W. Jones Jr., Terrence F. Schielke and Thomas 
R. Benecke, sued the company for wrongful termination. They claimed they were 
sacked after they tried to warn management that the C-5B aircraft had problems. 
</P>
<P>
In what is believed to be the highest punitive damages against a defense firm, 
the jury voted to award the trio $45.3 million. That will probably be reduced 
before all is said and done, but such a staggering amount reflects a good 
measure of public dissatisfaction with and distrust of the actions of not only 
Lockheed but the entire defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Northrop Corp. pleaded guilty to criminal charges that it 
faked tests on a sensor system that helps stabilize the AV-8B Harrier jet used 
by the Marine Corps. Northrop paid a record fine, but that doesn't help the 
Marines now in Saudi Arabia, who are in desperate need of replacements for the 
sensors. Last year, the McDonnell Douglas Corp. plant in Long Beach got a very 
bad review from the Air Force on the quality of its work. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed has indicated it will seek to overturn or appeal the judgment, noting 
that neither the company's competence nor the airworthiness of the C-5B was on 
trial. The Air Force is currently using the cargo jets to transport troops to 
the Persian Gulf for Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
But clearly job security should not be the trade-off for raising, in good 
conscience, questions about the safety of any program, government or otherwise. 
Defense firms ought to be accountable for their actions to employees and 
taxpayers alike. 
</P>
<P>
As juror Julio Barrious, put it, "We felt that if taxpayers pay for a product 
that we should get what we ask for and not something less. We felt that if we 
gave Lockheed a large (penalty), we would send out message, not only to 
Lockheed but (to) the defense industry." 
</P>
<P>
That they did.

KEEPING A HOUSING LIFELINE OPEN; 
</P>
<P>
LOW-INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS ARE SPARED THE BUDGET-CUTTERS' AX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress spared a tempting target during the recent budget battles. The 
lawmakers extended the life of low-income housing tax credits, the principal 
government resource for financing new and affordable rental housing. 
</P>
<P>
Eliminating the tax credits would have saved the federal government as much as 
$300 million a year. But it would have hurt thousands of poor families, 
low-income senior citizens and homeless Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The credits provide a major tax break for private corporations that invest in 
affordable housing. The businesses pay for the rehabilitation or construction 
of low-income housing in exchange for a credit deducted from their federal 
income tax bill. The work is typically done by nonprofit developers who claim 
to leverage the private investment by as much as 10 times the initial amount. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the tax credits generate investments used to produce 100,000 
apartments, townhouses and rooms in single-resident-occupancy hotels every 
year. In California, the tax break produces enough money to build or preserve 
10,000 homes. Locally, tax credits have translated into renovated 
single-occupancy hotels on Skid Row, rehabilitated housing for senior citizens 
in Little Tokyo, townhouse apartments in Watts and new family housing in East 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The rents are subsidized to keep them within the reach of poor families who 
live on the minimum wage or welfare, senior citizens who live on fixed incomes 
and homeless people who live on general relief. The tenants pay up to 30% of 
their incomes for rent, a limit that keeps the apartments affordable in 
expensive housing markets like Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The tax credits have taken on even greater significance because of the recent 
defeat of Proposition 145. That bond measure would have generated $315 million 
to help moderate-income families buy their first homes and to assist thousands 
of poor people, including farm workers and their families, to either get in, or 
stay in, decent apartments and rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The bond measure was significant because California, unlike other states, does 
not adequately fund a variety of vigorous statewide housing programs despite an 
affordable housing crisis and a highly visible homeless population in many 
cities. The new state funds would have helped. 
</P>
<P>
Given the uncertain economic climate, it's unlikely that federal or state 
housing funds will grow significantly. There is no doubt, however, that 
millions of Americans need better and more affordable housing.

MATH AND SCIENCE EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading "How U.S. Failed in Science" (Nov. 8), we are disgusted at the 
quality of scientific knowledge possessed by most Americans. It is obvious to 
most of us here at Caltech that the U.S. school system is unable to teach 
science properly. 
</P>
<P>
Indicative of this lack of knowledge, the sample questions printed in the 
article, as used by the National Science Foundation's poll, show a lack of 
scientific understanding. Of the 10 survey statements printed, two were 
impossible to answer. Most of the others were very vague and subjective. 
</P>
<P>
Statement 6, "The universe began with a huge explosion," is known as the Big 
Bang Theory. Even though it is widely supported in the scientific community, it 
is only a theory. 
</P>
<P>
Statement 7, "In the entire universe, there are thousands of planets like our 
own on which life could have developed," is pure conjecture. The best 
telescopes have only been able to recognize dual-star systems in nearby solar 
systems. The resolution of current telescopes is far from capable of 
distinguishing planets in any solar system but our own. There is neither proof 
nor counter-proof of the existence of life outside of our solar system. 
</P>
<P>
How can we expect people to answer these questions correctly when many of them 
cannot be answered? Perhaps the members of the National Science Foundation 
should themselves be judged before judging others.

DEFEAT OF LIQUOR TAX PROPOSITIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
So the "nickel-a-drink" tax was defeated and now the county-run mental health 
clinics may have to cut $42 million in programs. 
</P>
<P>
This is such an absurd way to get funding for mental health clinics by taxing 
all of those who enjoy an occasional cocktail, beer or glass of wine. County 
health programs should be supported by taxpayers in general and not just by 
those who enjoy alcohol. Why didn't they simply place a proposition on the 
ballot that was designed to help fund county health programs? Maybe if they 
would have been straight about it, they would have gotten their funding.

I have a suggestion for supporters of the Prop. 134 and/or environmental 
initiatives. It also would apply to those who are in favor of the causes, but 
not the costs. 
</P>
<P>
For those worried about the environment, buy only recycled/recyclable paper 
products and biodegradable household cleaning products; recycle newspapers, 
cans, bottles and plastic foam and bags (even if you are not paid); collect 
"warm-up" water and other relatively clean water and use it to water plants and 
flush toilets, and contribute your money and efforts to the environmental 
organizations that are closest to your beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
For those worried about the alcohol problem: Contribute to Mothers Against 
Drunk Driving and other organizations against alcohol abuse; work through your 
PTAs and school boards to initiate or expand abuse programs in schools, and set 
a good example for your own children. 
</P>
<P>
Not all important advances spring from the ballot box, and there's always 1992.

INCOME TAX CHOICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Deville's suggestion (letter, Nov. 11) that the National Endowment for 
the Arts be funded by a "checkoff box" on the federal income tax form is such a 
good idea that I would like to expand on it. Why not have checkoff boxes for 
all the major categories in the national budget? We could have boxes for the 
Defense Department, the National Park Service, federal aid to education, 
Medicare, federal law enforcement agencies, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
That way, each taxpayer could be assured that his taxes went to government 
functions he approved of. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the checkoff would also serve as a national referendum on the 
budget. If money were spent only on those things the people are willing to be 
taxed for, the budget would be automatically balanced, and the unseemly budget 
battles between Congress and the White House would be eliminated.

'BODY TJAK' AT WADSWORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Out of the factious, alienated '80s, a longing for community is fueling a 
resurgence of tribal art in America. From such small, experimental performing 
collectives as San Francisco's Contraband and our own Open Gate Theatre on 
through the Hollywood epic "Dances With Wolves," we see the accommodating 
extended family presented as a social model. 
</P>
<P>
"Body Tjak" accepts the premise and offers its own paradigm. Seen at the 
Wadsworth Theater on Saturday, the project enlists two dozen performers -- half 
of them Balinese, half American -- in an attempt at cultural synthesis. 
</P>
<P>
From American percussionist Keith Terry they learned Body Music: methods of 
slapping, stamping, clapping and vocalizing common to many world cultures. With 
Balinese choreographer I Wayan Dibia they practiced Kecak, an intricate, often 
guttural sacred chant increasingly secularized and hybridized in Bali since the 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
As long as "Body Tjak" remained focused on alternating and then combining Body 
Music and Kecak, the evening had great mastery to recommend it, along with 
rhythmic innovation galore. Besides high-energy displays of interlocking body 
percussion, singing and chant, the ensemble made music on newly developed 
metallic instruments capable of both Balinese and Western tunings, along with 
delicate, soothing bamboo. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the dance component of "Body Tjak" proved nowhere near this 
distinguished. 
</P>
<P>
The intense physicality of Body Music makes a dancelike statement in itself, 
but became dulled here by the flat-footed boogie processions led by Terry. 
Except during the slowest, simplest music, the U.S. contingent evaded the 
challenge of dancing to the new Bali-American rhythms. Brief displays of tap, 
ballet, juggling and lambada served as an index of possibilities but led 
nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
Dibia and the Balinese came closer, borrowing potent movement ideas (most of 
them gestural) from their traditional culture. But dance still seemed an 
afterthought -- as did the masks, puppets and philosophical baggage of the 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the giant effigies who bleated in two languages about "new world 
transition" ("seek justice, build bridges") brought the whole experience close 
to self-parody. 
</P>
<P>
In a lecture after the performance, Terry defended the smug, simplistic 
references to war, racism, sexism, religious intolerance and class strife, 
saying that these were issues he wanted to address, and citing the moral 
commentary in traditional Balinese dance dramas. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, "Body Tjak" never began to address those issues but merely scattered 
greeting-card homilies -- while traditional Balinese dance drama belongs to a 
continuum of moral art utterly different from Terry and Dibia's diversionary 
showpiece. 
</P>
<P>
No, the most profound statement made by "Body Tjak" is the company itself: 
pan-cultural, multiracial, full of distinctive individuals yet unified in 
style, purpose and spirit. The members are talented, versatile, beautiful in 
many different ways -- and we don't need to see them in their unfortunate, 
'60s-style tie-dyes to understand the message of their solidarity.

KOSTABI WORKS ON VIEW IN FULLERTON; 
</P>
<P>
THE ARTIST'S NOTORIETY IS BASED LARGELY ON KOSTABI WORLD, THE ASSEMBLY LINE 
ENTERPRISE HE FOUNDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few years ago, I had the misfortune to be backed up against the punch bowl at 
a holiday party, listening to an angry and rather sozzled young Laguna Beach 
painter rant about the awfulness of on-the-edge contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
"People like you think Mark Kostabi is a great artist!" she shrieked. It was no 
use assuring her that I'd never written a word about him. For a lot of people, 
the Whittier boy who made good in New York is the epitome of all that's wrong 
with taste and standards in today's art. The flaw in this reasoning is that 
Kostabi in no way represents the seriousness and range of contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
His notoriety is based largely on Kostabi World, the assembly line enterprise 
he founded in his adopted city, where a staff turns out "Kostabis" that are 
said to sell for anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
At the tender age of 29, he now has the honor of a retrospective of sorts (a 
group of paintings from 1982 onward) at the Main Art Gallery at Cal State 
Fullerton, his alma mater of sorts (he studied there for 3 1/2 years but didn't 
earn a degree). 
</P>
<P>
"A degree can work against you," he claimed last week when he phoned from his 
parents' home to plead for a kind review -- a first in this critic's 
experience. Without the degree, he said, "a lot of successful people are 
impressed by your nonconformity." 
</P>
<P>
The virtue of the show is that we get to consider the guy's art (the pre-1986 
works are apparently actually by his own hand, though he signs his name to all 
the products of his factory), as apart from his jejune remarks ("I am a 
champion of creativity") or hype-riddled media reputation. 
</P>
<P>
His large and economy-size paintings are peopled by sexless, egg-headed 
androids who tend to be plugged into earphones, hanging out at nightspots, 
slaving away at Kostabi World or engaging in the sort of activities "symbolic" 
of man's fate (tug of war, trying to balance on the edge of a cliff) that have 
long been the province of lowbrow knickknacks. 
</P>
<P>
Other paintings are based on famous works of art, such as Rembrandt's "The 
Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp," Leonardo's "The Last Supper" or Manet's "Fifer." 
</P>
<P>
In his Rembrandt shtick, Kostabi casts himself in the role of Dr. Tulp, and the 
anonymous cadaver on which he is demonstrating is Andy Warhol -- the artist 
whom Kostabi childishly views as a competitor ("I think I'm more bizarre," he 
once told an interviewer). The rest of this vacuously self-serving painting is 
a generalization of the famous work -- this time with "normal" human faces and 
bodies rather than the faceless androids. 
</P>
<P>
Kostabi's version of "The Last Supper" is a reworking of the famous original 
with neutral android types and an invisible Jesus. On first look, the viewer 
may strain to perceive why the heads of certain apostles have been rendered as 
toilet seats. But figures in Kostabi's paintings of entirely different subjects 
are also equipped with the same plumbing fixtures, rendering the gesture simply 
a tiresome gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
"The First Step" looks like a pastiche of several Renaissance Madonna and child 
paintings. Illuminated by sickly fluorescent yellow lighting and augmented with 
a TV set (the solemn child holds up the plug like a cross) and the distant 
scaffolding for a modern office building, the painting cynically proposes a 
savior born to deliver a message about the supreme importance of media. 
</P>
<P>
Kostabi's most recent piece in the show ("The Visitor") is a bronze sculpture 
with a curiously milky patina. It is a demure seated nude who rests her chin on 
one hand and crosses her ankles. Kitsch incarnate, down to the "artistic" 
patina and a title that could have come directly from the Franklin Mint, the 
piece adds no new revelations to the genre of contemporary art that deals with 
the obtuseness of popular taste. 
</P>
<P>
The cleverness of Kostabi's work lies in the way it panders to the confusion of 
the hapless uninformed consumer who wants to be art-hip but doesn't know how to 
go about it. 
</P>
<P>
His figures, landscapes and interiors are generally composed of cold geometric 
forms modeled in perfectly calibrated shades of black and white -- the kind 
that gets an A in art class. This meticulous good grooming reassures the 
consumer that the artist has some basic skills (unlike the rarefied variety of 
contemporary art that appears to involve no real "talent"). The futuristic look 
brings to mind nattily executed sci-fi art, yet the works are reassuringly 
stocked with familiar objects sold in electronics stores. 
</P>
<P>
But what separates this work from important contemporary art are the underlying 
assumptions of the artist. When Kostabi talks about "reaching out and trying to 
make the world a better place" with "art for everyone, love for everyone," he 
is spouting the kind of drivel found in greeting cards and smarmy corporate 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Given a chance to talk about art at length, as in a recent FlashArt magazine 
interview (Summer 1990 issue), he reveals his lack of direction and apparent 
inability to deal with substantial ideas in depth. 
</P>
<P>
Somebody who refers to "the gullible, malleable American public," notes his 
pleasure at being on the cover of People magazine, professes his love of Old 
Master painting and calls himself "just a simple person who wants to express 
himself on canvas" is someone acting the role of 
artist-provocateur-with-heart-of-gold. 
</P>
<P>
That's just what a certain segment of the art-baffled public wants to hear, but 
it doesn't add up to a cogent view of the world -- just a view of how to build 
a personal career. If his jumble of thoughts isn't a put-on, it just shows how 
confused and desperate for public affirmation he is. 
</P>
<P>
Warhol, on the other hand, was his own man. He had a clear-cut art agenda apart 
from his media image. As my colleague Christopher Knight has explained, the 
artist was packaging ideas related to the dominant art style of his time -- 
abstract expressionism -- in popular culture forms (for example, by 
transforming the liquid manipulation of paint -- called "soup" -- into literal 
renderings of Campbell's soup cans). 
</P>
<P>
The big void in this exhibit -- and a particularly shameful one, too, in a 
university setting -- is context. Exhibit curator Stephen Verrell, a master of 
fine arts candidate at Cal State Fullerton, fails to explain how Kostabi's work 
fits or doesn't fit into the larger arena of contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
This is one show that shouldn't have been attempted without a catalogue, but 
the university art department doesn't have the money for one. (Conversely, of 
course, one can be grateful that the Kostabi empire didn't get any more 
permanent documentation.) 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, a slide-and-sound presentation, strongly geared to a 
youthful audience. The 15-minute program opens with pounding rock music, then 
shoots rapidly through a jumble of images (including portraits of Picasso and 
Warhol, and a reproduction of Van Gogh's auction record-setting painting, 
"Irises"). 
</P>
<P>
The text is nothing if not boosterish, rife with buzzwords that appeal at once 
to a vague sense of novelty and piously old-fashioned notions of artistic 
creation: "Yuppie sensibility," "personifies Now," "crusader," "quest," 
"truth," "reputation." 
</P>
<P>
But never do we hear how Kostabi relates to Jeff Koons or Chris Burden or 
Mitchell Syrop or any of the other conceptual artists who are significant 
today. Listening to the blather on the tape, you might think that Kostabi has 
been obliged to uphold the fabled outrageousness of contemporary art all by 
himself. Sorry, but art today is preeminently about ideas, not about 
titillating the readers of People magazine. 
</P>
<P>
So let's not envy Kostabi's 15 minutes of fame. Let's just hope that this 
self-professed lonely guy who dreams of "building the world's tallest building 
devoted to art and humanitarian pursuits, in Brooklyn" finally finds happiness 
and considers early retirement or perhaps a new career in real estate.

THE COAST BALLET AT CURTIS THEATRE

For the past three years, the fledgling Coast Ballet Theatre has been gathering 
strength and experience at its San Juan Capistrano studios and several Orange 
County performance sites. 
</P>
<P>
Formed in late 1987 out of a merger of three local companies (two of which 
dated back to 1981), CBT has undergone several name changes in the interim. But 
its repertoire remains dominated by Sarma Rosenberg, the company's co-artistic 
director, with her husband, Larry Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
In a program over the weekend at the Curtis Theatre here, four of the five 
works were choreographed by Sarma Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
She made speedy, if not hectic, energetic and challenging demands on the 
dancers, and they responded to the running jumps, frequent turns and overhead 
lifts with clean lines and security. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, in an age in which many choreographers are concerned with 
abstract movement pieces, Rosenberg appears to favor works of moral persuasion. 
At least, the Friday program opened and closed with such pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the tempo of its telling, Rosenberg's "Beauty and the Beast," set to 
Peter Warlock's "Capriol Suite" and Britten's Variations on a Theme of Frank 
Bridge, is an old-fashioned story ballet that uses mime. 
</P>
<P>
It even has a moral: "Love evokes either the man from the beast or the beast 
from the man." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg tells the story swiftly, deftly, with imagination, but with only 
sketchy characterization. She calls to mind parallels with the "Cinderella" 
fairy tale but never establishes the two other sisters (Jennifer Freedman and 
Betsy Schamet) as wicked characters. 
</P>
<P>
As Beauty, the fine-featured Sara Lane proved poised and secure in the 
technical demands but projected little emotional involvement in the drama. 
</P>
<P>
With his matted hair and blackened cheeks, the virtuosic Gary Franco resembled 
less a scary beast than the moodily handsome magician David Copperfield, so 
Beauty's fainting upon seeing him seemed a bit inexplicable. 
</P>
<P>
Two serious choreographic miscalculations: Despite some bravura steps by 
Franco, the central pas de deux remained thin and disappointing. Second, at the 
end, Beauty and Beast merely walk forward (a la Fokine's "Firebird"). Before 
that, a gymnastic but emotionally flat pas de deux is given to the animated 
statues of Venus (Stephanie Balmer) and Cupid (Tyrone Baker). It's not enough. 
</P>
<P>
"Dana's Ocean: Two Years Before the Mast" (set to Bliss' ballet score "Adam 
Zero") pits good against evil in emblematic, non-narrative fashion, with an 
earnest Richard Henry Dana (John Denniston) aligned with natural forces such as 
Oceana (Kaylee Orrell) against the villainous Capt. Thompson (Franco). 
</P>
<P>
Despite some striking visual elements (Dana perched on the ship's rigging), the 
work rushes through its elements, verges on Hollywood kitsch and bears little 
logical scrutiny about what exactly is happening. The piece doesn't support the 
noble program note about protesting "our current inhumanities and our 
mistreatment of our oceans." 
</P>
<P>
Completing the program were Rosenberg's "Waltz in Ragtime" (Joplin), a plotless 
company divertissement; her facile "Ballerina Girl" (Lionel Richie), danced by 
a lithe Lane and a supportive Denniston; and Inese Birzniece's circusy 
showpiece "Valsis" (Tangejena Igenberga), danced with stylish vigor and 
commitment by Balmer and Bret Rijke.

TOP SOPRANO HAS AN UNEVEN NIGHT

Soprano Kathleen Battle had an uneven night at Civic Theatre Saturday. In the 
opening half of her recital, she started two songs over again, apparently 
fighting drainage or some other vocal discomfort. And, on several occasions, 
the diva was at odds with her overly independent accompanist, Kenneth 
Griffiths, whom she gave numerous corrections with unsubtle hand signals. After 
intermission, however, Battle regained her customary composure and, after the 
closing set of Richard Strauss lieder, compensated her approving audience with 
five encores. 
</P>
<P>
At her best, Battle approached the sublime. Her four Franz Liszt songs on poems 
by Victor Hugo radiated an innocent sensuality. She caressed the playful French 
texts, spinning out a delicate web of shimmering vocal lines. Especially in 
"Oh! quand je dors," her floating tones invited the listener into a secret, 
magical realm. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did Battle shy from displaying her coloratura bravado, which she unleashed 
with vigor in an aria from Handel's secular oratorio "Semele." In "Myself I 
Shall Adore," a text whose subtleties no soprano should have trouble conveying, 
Battle's pinpoint accuracy and constant focus through rapid passage work 
reminded the capacity house that this diva belongs in the most exclusive vocal 
circles. 
</P>
<P>
What was disturbing about Battle's Saturday night performance was her 
intermittent presence. When singing Strauss' engaging "Sausle, Liebe Myrthe," 
or Sylvia Olden Lee's pathos-filled arrangement of the spiritual "Lord, How 
Come Me Here?" Battle's emotional commitment became palpable and her timbre 
warmed considerably. But in a group of three Mozart songs (including "Das 
Veilchen" and "Abendempfindung" and a rarely performed aria from "Le Nozze di 
Figaro," the comely singer seemed distant and uninvolved. Since Battle is a 
Mozart specialist, her emotional retreat was doubly disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
According to officials at the La Jolla Chamber Music Society, the recital's 
sponsor, Battle changed her original program at the last moment, inserting 
additional three pieces with flute obbligato. (Her program bio announced an 
upcoming joint recital in New York with French flutist Jean-Pierre Rampal.) 
These were the only works for which she used music, and, although her 
performance of them was far from tentative, they lacked the conviction of the 
rest of the program. Flutist Judith Pearce's precise but dull-timbred line 
added little. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Phillipe Rameau's "Rossignols Amoureux" was charming and full of 
predictable echoes between flute and soprano. If Michael Head's "Bird-Song" 
added a welcome note of gentle contemporaneity to the proceedings, Sir Henry 
Bishop's "Lo! Here the Gentle Lark" was little more than turgid Victorian 
posturing. Although Bishop wrote 130 operas -- none are performed today -- he 
is chiefly remembered for having composed the maudlin tune for "Home, Sweet 
Home." 
</P>
<P>
As Battle's keyboard accompanist, Griffiths lacked both accuracy and empathy 
for the singer. His touch was brittle and heavy-handed, although he evidenced 
some affinity for the dense textures of the Strauss lieder.

Good-by to the Big Top: Animal trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams performed in 
places like Madison Square Garden more times than Frank Sinatra and lots of 
other big names. But after 11,697 shows and 44 years working in circuses, 
Gebel-Williams performed his last death-defying act Sunday in Pittsburgh with 
the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to step down when I am really good," Gebel-Williams, 56, said. Plus, he 
says, training tigers is getting a little riskier because he has lost some of 
his quickness and his eyesight is not what it used to be. Known for his 
soft-spoken training methods based on mutual respect, Gebel-Williams announced 
two years ago that he would retire at the end of the 1990 season. He plans to 
settle at his winter home in Venice, Fla., with his 20 Bengal and Siberian 
tigers, and will yield the ring to his 20-year-old son Mark. CLAUDIA PUIG

THE CAMERATA HONORS SAINT

Perhaps St. Cecilia listened and was touched by the celebration given in her 
honor Saturday night by the Irvine Camerata. The patron saint of music and 
musicians certainly could not have asked for a more refined remembrance than 
the understated gala led by Robert Hickok at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Festivities revolved around music by Henry Purcell, with two of his four odes 
for the saint's day -- "Welcome to All the Pleasures" and "Hail! Bright 
Cecilia" -- as well as a birthday ode actually intended for Queen Mary -- "Come 
Ye Sons of Art." "Hail! Bright Cecilia" stood apart as the most ambitious and 
the most polished of the offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Here, the 20-member orchestra that had begun the program mired in tenuousness, 
with ragged entrances and little attention to chromaticisms, came together in 
the opening symphony in well-defined imitation and a bleatingly plaintive 
adagio. Dialogue between the strings and a trio formed by Alfred Lang, Karen 
Tkaczyk and Danielle Squyres on trumpets and timpani created attractively 
lively allegros. Continuous work by Malcolm Hamilton on harpsichord and Ian 
McKinnel on cello remained unerringly rhythmic, stylish and attentive 
throughout. 
</P>
<P>
Vocal soloists proved uneven in natural prowess, though not jarringly 
mismatched. Countertenors Drew Minter and Brian Asawa shone through pristine, 
elegant projection. Minter, especially, illuminated "Tis nature's voice" with 
unusually free tone and control of dynamics, vibrato and enunciation. He 
conveyed the text with sympathetic flexibility and formed a flawlessly matched 
blend with tenor Bruce Johnson for "In vain the am'rous flute and soft guitar." 
</P>
<P>
Earl Patriarco brought clear sonority and straightforward reading to "Wondrous 
machine" and outstripped his fellow baritone Bruce Bales in consistency of tone 
during register changes in "Let these among themselves contest." Soprano Linda 
Williams lent her small, unremarkable instrument to a bland "Thou tun'st this 
world below," which was nevertheless enlivened by oboists Joseph Stone and 
Laura Stone. 
</P>
<P>
The Camerata gave balanced and sensitive support to featured vocalists during 
Purcell's works but were given the spotlight primarily in Benjamin Britten's 
"Hymn to St. Cecilia." Under Hickok's economical direction, choristers shaped 
lines with precise accentuation and well-trained mastery of dynamics. In louder 
sections, balance fell to the male voices, but in lighter portions -- such as 
"I cannot grow" -- the choir reacted with busy, clipped clarity.

SWENSON AND FAHEY MAKE LONG NIGHT OF ROCK WORTHWHILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LONG BEACH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blow Up magazine's second anniversary party Friday night at Bogart's Bohemian 
Cafe was a little like the Orange County-Long Beach alternative rock scene that 
the publication was founded to cover: scattered and hard to define (like the 
suburbs themselves), but worth delving into. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of stylistic overlap among the five acts which played on the 4 
1/2-hour bill was indicative of the absence of a unifying sound on the local 
scene. That's bad for marketing (Seattle has established itself as the new hot 
spot on the alternative rock map by exporting a relatively uniform and 
consistent product: loud sludge rock), but good for the long-term health of the 
scene. In music, as in the biosphere, the more varied the gene pool, the 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting until the end of the long evening had its rewards: Top billed 
singer-songwriters Tim Swenson and Peter Fahey are two talents worthy of 
championing the Orange County-Long Beach scene to the outside world. Swenson 
nearly got his chance last year while fronting the now-defunct Lunchbox, which 
landed a recording deal but watched it fall through. Fahey's shot is due to 
come next year with the release of a debut album on one of the PolyGram Records 
affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
The two represented effective, but markedly different, approaches toward 
acoustic singer-songwriter performance. 
</P>
<P>
Fahey fit the traditional image of the singer-songwriter that reaches back to 
the '60s folk boom and (fortunately for him) is back in currency again. Tall 
and sturdy-looking, he wore a flannel shirt, unbuttoned over a white T-shirt, 
and strummed his guitar in a basic, unadorned way, embellishing it with wails 
from a harmonica worn in a collar brace. Fahey's singing was forthright and 
homespun, nasal but tuneful. He fit the bill as an American Everyman 
troubadour. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with that mold, Fahey's 45-minute solo acoustic set was full of 
melancholy introspection. His performance was often like personal reverie -- 
there was even a sense of solitude in the floor-jarring kicks of his left boot 
with which he kept the beat. 
</P>
<P>
But Fahey's was an inclusive sort of reverie that drew a listener in. His 
brief, low-keyed but occasionally humorous song introductions clued a listener 
in, and his caressing melodies held attention. So did his lyrics, which didn't 
strive for poetic grace notes but did manage to set a scene and evoke feelings 
in direct, economical terms. As personal as Fahey's songs were, they touched on 
emotional situations that almost everyone has experienced. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, the set's eight songs sketched a man chastened and wary in his 
understanding of life's pain but stoically able to accept it without self-pity. 
"Depend On" reflected on how existence can be a lonely thing, even when it's 
colored with love and companionship. "I'll Remember You" got to the heart of 
one of life's unique emotional experiences: the mingled sense of loss and 
relief that comes when death ends an aged grandparent's suffering. Fahey's 
directness and simplicity allowed him to pull off songs such as that without 
sinking into pathos or sentimentality. 
</P>
<P>
That was true, at least, when he sang from his own point of view. "Picking Up 
Pennies," in which Fahey tried to step into the shoes of a Skid Row denizen, 
voiced the usual sentiments about extreme poverty, without any imaginative 
flashes to make them hit home. 
</P>
<P>
Over a longer set, some counterbalancing lightheartedness or hopefulness would 
be in order. The closest Fahey came was "Sweet Dreams" (not the Patsy Cline 
song), a combination of Everly Brothers winsomeness and John Lennon's "Imagine" 
-- style utopianism. 
</P>
<P>
Where Fahey was meditative and self-contained, Swenson let it rip. Attacking an 
acoustic guitar he borrowed from Fahey, accompanied by an electric bassist and 
electric guitarist, the Long Beach-based singer showed his roots in the Orange 
County punk scene by performing his entire 35-minute set at a hot pitch of 
passion. Punk emerged in the aggressiveness and all-out emotionalism of the 
performance rather than in the music itself. Swenson sang with a soul-tinged 
cry, not a punker's snarl. The shaggy, tattooed singer writhed spasmodically 
and stomped in a kinetic display that obviously rose from honest feeling, not 
calculated design. Swenson'sa connection to the emotions in his songs was 
immediate, complete, and unquestionable. 
</P>
<P>
Swenson sang about frayed inner states, chronicling betrayals suffered, sins 
committed, at one point allowing for a vision of redemption conferred. The high 
moral stakes in his songs justified the high drama of his fevered delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Bassist John Wersbee and guitarist Dave Davis backed Swenson with just the 
right blend of raggedness and sensitivity. Davis' spare, countrified lead 
guitar fills and vocal harmonies were consistently on target. The players 
interacted, watching each other, exchanging nods of recognition and 
satisfaction and making the set seem less a performance than a shared emotional 
release. 
</P>
<P>
The other three acts on the bill are still developing, but not without promise. 
Medicine Rattle and Spanish Fly front man Dave Pedroza lose points for shirking 
the evening's challenge -- it was billed as "An Acoustic Hoedown" -- by 
performing electric sets with full-rock rhythm sections. Better to review them 
down the road, in full-blown rock settings where they aren't trying to present 
a more subdued fish-nor-foul version of themselves (Kirsten Konte of Children's 
Day turned in a fine guest appearance, dueting on several songs with Pedroza in 
a voice that was clear and firm, but with a strong shading of world-weariness). 
</P>
<P>
Kristi Lewis, formerly the backup singer in Too Many Joes, opened with a set 
that made a strong claim for her own place in the spotlight. Playing in an 
as-yet-unnamed duo with harmony-singer Tracey New, Lewis sang beautifully, 
recalling such pure-sounding sources as Joni Mitchell, Maria McKee and some of 
the more ethereal female singers on the British alternative rock scene. She 
strummed guitar purposefully, and displayed lots of confidence and the ability 
to project herself on stage. New was a reticent performer, but blended with 
Lewis in fine close harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis and New clearly have ability, but they didn't have any good songs. 
Everything in their 35-minute set meandered without melodic or lyrical focus, 
sounding more like outpourings in a diary than well-shaped songs. The duo's 
outlook, though not its sound, resembled the Indigo Girls': ever-earnest 
examinations of what it's like to be in limbo between adolescence and that 
elusive moment when one figures out an adult purpose for one's life. It's 
perfectly legitimate to sing about that post-adolescent search for identity and 
meaning, but it has to be done in a way that's resonant, not self-involved. 
</P>
<P>
Blow Up is the creation of co-editors John Surge and Bobbi Villalobos, Long 
Beach residents who met when they were journalism students at Humboldt State. 
Surge said he saw a need for a publication that would spotlight the Long 
Beach-Orange County alternative rock and poetry scene, which he felt received 
short shrift from the underground music press in Los Angeles. Using their home 
computer, Surge and Villalobos publish a 16-page tabloid edition every other 
month and distribute 4,000 copies for free. 
</P>
<P>
Surge said his next goal -- not yet in sight because of tight finances -- is to 
have Blow Up sponsor a compilation album that would spotlight local performers 
and perhaps serve as a first step toward creating a regular independent label 
to go with the magazine.

Billy Sings the Blues: Billy Joel, almost a year into a 15-month world tour to 
promote his triple-platinum "Storm Front" LP, says he is touring primarily to 
get himself out of a sea of red ink. "The reason for the length of this tour is 
financial," he told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, at this age, you don't want to go out on the road for fun and games. 
When I started the tour, I was in deep financial straits . . . I was looking at 
a deep, deep, deep, deep financial hole that would take two years to get out 
of. So I said, 'OK,' and put my head down and went to work and I'm getting back 
in the black." CLAUDIA PUIG

COUNTRY SINGER'S OFF-CENTER LICKS AND GUITARIST PETE ANDERSON'S STINGING RIFFS 
STEAL THE SPOTLIGHT.

It was good news, at least for local yokels, that Dwight Yoakam is not on tour 
right now, and that his show on Friday at the Universal Amphitheatre was his 
only scheduled concert of the year. That meant that his lead guitarist would 
almost certainly be stalwart Pete Anderson, who is too busy as a producer and 
session guitarist to tour with Yoakam anymore, but does show up at isolated 
gigs. Sure enough, Anderson -- like Yoakam a veteran of the L.A. country scene 
-- was on hand, and true to form he nearly stole the show. 
</P>
<P>
Over four albums, Yoakam has established himself as one of contemporary 
country's most gifted songwriters, with a plaintive voice to match. But he's a 
laconic enough stage presence that he needs a strong foil in concert, and 
Anderson's stinging riffs and slightly off-center licks provided just that, a 
constant delight of rockabilly-inflected invention. 
</P>
<P>
This indeed offered some of the fun of a "living room gig," as Yoakam promised, 
in noting that the lack of a tour made it seem that his band had virtually 
stepped onto the stage from their bedrooms. Which is not to suggest it was 
anything but tight. 
</P>
<P>
The show featured energized, well-thought-out rearrangements of selections from 
Yoakam's early LPs -- sometimes turning standard country fare more rock-ish 
(the opening "Ring of Fire"), or sometimes just the opposite, giving his more 
rock-flavored numbers a bluegrass lilt. 
</P>
<P>
His fine new effort, "If There Was a Way," was also well-represented. This 
included a bit of monkey business at the end when Yoakam encored with "Wooly 
Bully" -- in tribute to the opening act, Tex-Mex all-stars the Texas Tornados 
-- then launched into the new LP's "Since I Started Drinking Again," only to 
stop mid-chorus and start up "Wooly" again. This process was repeated twice, to 
general crowd delight. He might not want to take that irreverent routine on the 
road next year, but it played just great in the hometown. CHRIS WILLMAN

COUNTERPUNCH: WHOSE 'FAMILY VALUES' DOES BURGER KING SUPPORT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANNY GOLDBERG, Goldberg is president of Gold Mountain Entertainment and 
chair of the ACLU Foundation of Southern California. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am one of the American people to whom Burger King's recent newspaper ads were 
addressed -- the ads in which they promised to spend their TV ad budgets only 
to support "traditional American family values on television, especially the 
importance of the family." 
</P>
<P>
My parents have been happily married for more than 40 years. I have the warmest 
feelings for my brother and my sister, and my wife and I are having the time of 
our life with our 3-month-old daughter Katie. I share Burger King's enthusiasm 
for the family, but I have a terrible feeling that the values of my family are 
not the values Burger King was referring to. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently Burger King took this ad, not because of a sudden wave of sentiment 
coursing through their corporate headquarters, but shortly after having 
meetings with the Rev. Billy Melvin of the pressure group CleaR-TV who had been 
engaged in a boycott of Burger King because the fast-food chain was sponsoring 
TV shows that Rev. Melvin didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
One of the programs that CleaR criticized was a TV airing of the Oscar-winning 
film "Platoon." My family considers "Platoon" a work of the highest moral 
caliber, brilliantly expressing the horror of war. Our values lead us to 
appreciate sponsorship of such a broadcastand to seriously doubt the moral 
center of anyone who would agree that the film should be shunned. 
</P>
<P>
CleaR also criticized the NBC drama "People Like Us" for its positive portrayal 
of two gay characters. I didn't see this particular show, but I was raised to 
respect the humanity and potential for good in everyone, not just 
heterosexuals. My parents taught me to detest a narrow-minded philosophy that 
would require negative portrayals of millions of people just because of their 
sexual preference. I am raising my daughter to have respect for every human 
being. 
</P>
<P>
Rev. Melvin told Howard Rosenberg that "traditional American values" are 
defined in part by "a man and a woman not engaging in premarital sex until they 
are married, of a man and a woman committing to this relationship the rest of 
their lives." 
</P>
<P>
I wonder how Rev. Melvin feels about former President Reagan, who was divorced 
before he married Nancy. According to Nancy Reagan's book "My Turn," she was 
pregnant before they got married. I guess that CleaR would object to a 
dramatization of the Reagans' marriage. This seems pretty nutty to me. 
</P>
<P>
I just can't understand why Burger King would be intimidated by a group like 
this. 
</P>
<P>
CleaR-TV also accused Burger King of sponsoring TV shows with anti-Christian 
bigotry. I have not noticed this theme on prime-time TV. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the fact that the vast majority of Americans describe themselves as 
Christians, it's hard to imagine that a program with "anti-Christian" bigotry 
would get any ratings. One must assume either that Rev. Melvin is inventing a 
bigotry that does not exist or that his perception of what constitutes bigotry 
is out of step with most Christians. Surely Burger King must know that there 
are hundreds of Christian denominations in this country and that no reverend or 
group of reverends has the authority to speak on behalf of all American 
Christians. 
</P>
<P>
When my family wants to think about religious values, we go to church or 
synagogue or we talk or pray or meditate. When we watch television, it's for 
entertainment not for religion. I think that most Americans watch TV as an 
escape from day-to-day pressures. What's so bad about that? 
</P>
<P>
According to American tradition and law, Buddhists, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, 
members of other religions, atheists and agnostics are just as much American 
citizens as Christians are. Are these various groups still welcome at Burger 
King or are they only interested in selling food to people with the exact 
religious beliefs as Rev. Melvin? 
</P>
<P>
Americans are realists and they know that the purpose of Burger King's TV 
commercials is not to "support" certain moral themes -- the purpose is to sell 
burgers. Unfortunately, it appears that Burger King has been fooled into 
believing that Americans expect fast-food chains to be spiritual leaders. 
Because of the meetings that Burger King had with CleaR-TV and the subsequent 
newspaper ads about their "values," they have left the impression that they now 
will only sponsor programs that appeal to Rev. Melvin and the families of his 
followers. 
</P>
<P>
In light of this my family will certainly not be eating at Burger King any time 
soon.

CHARLES OWENS A STUDY IN PURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Owens has the look of a lonesome traveler on the uncertain highway of 
jazz. Never highly recognized, he has nonetheless persisted in finding his own 
way through the twists and turns of the music's multitude of changing styles. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at St. Marks Restaurant in Venice, he made one of his too-rare 
appearances outside the environment of studio dates and back-up bands. 
</P>
<P>
Until his final number, he chose music that was uncompromising in its jazz 
purity, with pieces like John Coltrane's "Equinox" and Cedar Walton's 
"Clockwise" demanding skill in every aspect of improvisation. Backed by the 
superb rhythm section of Bill Henderson on piano, Donald Dean on drums and 
Richard Reid on bass, Owens played a series of solos as thoughtfully 
well-crafted as they were stirringly emotional. His tone light and airy, his 
rhythms as loose and flowing as those of Coltrane -- who is an influence but 
not a model for him -- Owens approached every number as though it were a 
challenge to the breadth of his skills. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the other players also performed impressively in extended solo 
sections, with Henderson's piano work particularly attractive in its ability to 
blend contemporary styles ranging from fleet Bud Powell-like single note lines 
to massive block chording. 
</P>
<P>
Owens wrapped up the set with a slow, inexorably driving blues that sprung his 
tenor saxophone loose for a whimsical salute to every jazz man who has had to 
honk his way across a bar to excite an audience. The noisy St. Marks crowd 
loved it. Somehow, you just knew they would. DON HECKMAN

COUNTERPUNCH: THE LEFT IS CRYING WOLF OVER 'SOUTH AFRICA NOW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOROWITZ, Horowitz is chairman of the Committee on Media Integrity. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Shocking!" comments critic Howard Rosenberg about the recent flap over KCET 
Channel 28's decision to cancel "South Africa Now." And what does he find 
shocking? The fact that, within days of its decision, KCET management folded 
under threats from L.A. city councilmen, self-appointed media vigilantes and 
"community activists," reversing a programming decision that took a year to 
make -- a feat beyond the wildest dreams of Jesse Helms and his watchdog 
minions? 
</P>
<P>
No, for Rosenberg this frighteningly effective intrusion of the political left 
into the area of programming is neither shocking nor a threat to the integrity 
of public broadcasting. That is because Rosenberg agrees with the vigilantes. 
Therefore, what in other cases he would see as political interference with 
artistic freedom, in this case he regards as simple justice. 
</P>
<P>
What is shocking for Rosenberg is that KCET should have even considered 
removing such an embarrassing, low-grade propaganda effort masquerading as a 
"news" program in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
And why would KCET management have done such a thing? Might they have concluded 
that the producers of "South Africa Now" were little more than "solidarity with 
the ANC" committeemen and that for KCET to air ideological claptrap from the 
left might be a disservice not only to their viewing public, but even to black 
South Africans struggling to free themselves from the shackles of apartheid? 
</P>
<P>
No, in the politically jaundiced eyes of Rosenberg, such considerations can 
only be smoke screens. Only sinister pressure from right-wing apologists for 
the apartheid state could have prompted such a decision. For, in Rosenberg's 
view, "South Africa Now" is irreplaceable: "Unlike the preponderance of 
reporting on the region, ("South Africa Now") views not only the nation of 
South Africa, but also the whole of Southern Africa through black eyes." 
</P>
<P>
All blacks see alike, and in particular see like the ANC. This is the 
patronizing attitude that passes for moral wisdom on the left. Of course, like 
everybody else, Rosenberg has heard that there is a fratricidal conflict going 
on between blacks in South Africa that has taken nearly a thousand lives since 
Nelson Mandela was freed. But the ANC party-liners, who produce "South Africa 
Now," have assured us that this violence is due to the manipulations of 
"security police and right-wing death squads," while Rosenberg ludicrously 
suggests that it is charges like these that may have been "too bold" for KCET! 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, only a few days ago I was sitting in a cafe in Johannesburg with 
four members of the executive committee of the Pan African Congress (PAC), 
including Philemon Tefo who was imprisoned with Mandela in Robben Island for 27 
years for his efforts to overthrow the apartheid regime. 
</P>
<P>
Tefo was complaining about the ANC's current negotiations with the deKlerk 
government, which the PAC opposes. He said: "If it's the ANC and Inkatha, it's 
the ANC and AZAPO (Steve Biko's organization) it's killing. But if it's the ANC 
and the government, it's kissing." Nor was Philemon Tefo the only black 
anti-apartheid activist who complained to me about the ANC's hit men while I 
was there (there is even a name for them -- "comtsotsis," a contraction for 
"communist thugs"). Clearly there are more things in South Africa's heaven and 
earth than are dreamt of in the left-wing philosophies of Howard Rosenberg and 
the producers of "South Africa Now." 
</P>
<P>
The Committee on Media Integrity has no interest in censoring programs on KCET, 
although it reserves the right to judge them on their merits. (For the record: 
there was no pressure from our organization on KCET -- not even a "letter 
writing campaign." There was just civilized dialogue between us and KCET 
management.) The Committee on Media Integrity is an organization that seeks to 
promote balance in public television by adding voices that are not now heard. 
For example, in the area of current affairs documentaries, KCET, in our view, 
has veered far to the left, to the exclusion of other perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem we have experienced in attempting to redress this imbalance 
at KCET lies with the only true watchdog of the media in Los Angeles, the 
Calendar section of The Times itself. Its chief television critic, Howard 
Rosenberg, is an articulate champion of the cultural left. But that makes him a 
poor arbiter and/or defender of cultural integrity. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most significant step that could be taken to improve the quality of 
public television, would be for The Times to balance Rosenberg with a less 
ideologically committed television critic.

JUST IN TIME: A THANKSGIVING TURKEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Surely, Mary Tyler Moore will never be involved with any project more tasteless 
than the uncooked turkey that is "Thanksgiving Day" (tonight at 9 on Channels 
4, 36 and 39). Just in time for the holidays, this TV movie is like the drunken 
uncle with a lampshade on his head who won't go away until he tells you every 
gag he learned from Playboy's Party Jokes twice. 
</P>
<P>
It's a "black comedy," the promotional material tells us; this, of course, 
almost inevitably means that someone will fall over in some food and die, with 
uproarious consequences for a side-splitting ensemble cast. The cuisine here is 
turkey, and the wacky victim is Tony Curtis, making a merciful early exit as 
the scion of a wealthy family that made its name in high-quality industrial 
gloves. (Tittering already, are you?) 
</P>
<P>
Moore, as his widow, grieves, but not for long. "Even though your father and I 
only made love biannually, I'm starting to get horny," she tells her three 
bickering children -- a shiftless, bratty ne'er-do-well, a pale TV addict and 
an insecure lesbian. There's a happy ending in store for everyone, though, 
including the wayward daughter, who meets ladies' man Sonny Bono and 
straightens out. 
</P>
<P>
Since one child has struck up a romance with a forgotten TV personality, poor, 
put-upon Moore also attempts to start a new life by going out with Morton 
Downey Jr., who shows up just long enough to vomit in the bushes. There are 
jokes aplenty about butch women and death and vibrators. 
</P>
<P>
Sample dialogue: "I can't believe Daddy's gone. I've got a pain in my stomach 
that won't go away." Rejoinder: "Maybe if you stopped eating the pistachios." 
Black comedy really doesn't get much more irreverent than this, does it? 
</P>
<P>
"Thanksgiving Day" (written and produced by "Revenge of the Nerds' " Steve 
Zacharias and Jeff Buhai) may indeed cause you to count your blessings, 
starting with being grateful that so very little TV is anywhere near this 
relentlessly moronic. Just say no thanks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Amnesty Files' True in Spirit to Activist Group 
</P>
<P>
In attempting to dramatize what the human-rights activist organization Amnesty 
International does, the creators of the TV movie "Forgotten Prisoners: The 
Amnesty Files" have gone for a fictional treatment that lands squarely between 
"Mission: Impossible" and "Missing." It's probably the best possible approach 
they could have taken to the subject matter, and it nearly succeeds -- but for 
a debilitating over-generalization. It airs three times tonight, at 7, 9 and 11 
on the TNT cable network. 
</P>
<P>
It was thought too risky to existing Amnesty operatives overseas to dramatize 
an actual case study, so the story is a composite, set in the country in which 
almost anyone would least like to be arrested, Turkey. Knowing that weakens the 
viewing, because "Forgotten Prisoners" would be more compelling if it were a 
real-life tale. As a homogenized one, true in spirit but not in characters, the 
case seems a bit too generic. 
</P>
<P>
Writers Rex Weiner (whose L.A. Weekly story provided the basis for the 
teleplay) and Cindy Myers do flesh out their two leads, Ron Silver and Hector 
Elizondo, with likable quirks. Silver, an American attorney on his first 
mission to document cases of government torture, keeps a sense of humor amid 
his growing horror: "You won't believe this," he says into a pay phone. 
"They've got a guy watching me who looks like Tom Cruise. Yeah, Tom Cruise in 
Turkey." Elizondo, as his Turkish liaison, playfully patronizes Silver, but the 
urgency of the situation is foremost; it thankfully never degenerates into a 
buddy movie. 
</P>
<P>
Less intriguing detail is given to the political cartoonist (Chris Hunter) 
they're trying to save via international pressure. He stands up to gruesome 
torture admirably and lengthily, and as such is a sort of Everyprisoner, but 
his plight never takes on the significance it might if we learned a little 
about his life as a free man and social antagonist. Good intentions are almost 
good enough for "Forgotten Prisoners," which repeats Tuesday, Saturday and 
Sunday. CHRIS WILLMAN

A CHARMING, ENLIGHTENING LOOK AT 'CRASH OF 1929' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's easy to be bullish about "The Crash of 1929," an "American Experience" 
documentary airing tonight at 9 on Channels 28 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
A look at a time of seemingly endless prosperity and its rapid, inglorious 
finish, the program is a charming hour of newsreel footage, film clips and 
interviews with present-day descendants of some of the most notorious figures 
of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Like a bemused, still-in-wonder-at-it-all Greek chorus, the interviewees frame 
the show as well as illuminate it. "The pools (a small group of investors who 
controlled a stock) were a little like musical chairs," says Michael Nesbitt, 
grandson of Michael J. Meehan, one of the era's prime stock manipulators. "When 
the music stopped, somebody owned the stocks -- and those were the sufferers." 
</P>
<P>
The suffering was universal. Everyone from janitors to heiresses played the 
market, all hoping for a big score. Oddly enough, as "Crash" makes clear, most 
felt that the market was being manipulated. But they didn't care; they wanted 
to be in on the ride and hoped that they played it as well as the money men. 
</P>
<P>
"Crash" is full of choice anecdotes, ranging from an indignant Al Capone 
complaining about "crooked guys" in the stock market to a clip from 1929's 
"Cocoanuts" of Groucho Marx selling Florida swampland in much the same way that 
worthless stocks were trumped up and sold. The kicker: Despite his satirical 
prescience, Groucho was hopelessly addicted to the market and lost all his 
money in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market of the '20s was not a level playing field: There was no 
regulation, insider trading was common, and journalists at all the major 
newspapers were on the take (there is a great shot of canceled checks that had 
been used to buy off newsmen). Economist John Kenneth Galbraith says there's 
"nothing unique about this. It is something which happens every 20 or 30 years. 
. . . It's about the length of time that it requires for a new set of suckers.

DIPLOMACY: END OF THE COLD WAR, POLITICS AT HOME AND INSTABILITY IN BEIJING 
COOL U.S. ARDOR FOR CLOSER TIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past year, President Bush and his top aides have shelved their 
campaign to patch up the once-cozy U.S. relationship with China, reluctantly 
conceding that China's political upheavals of 1989 have caused lasting damage 
to ties between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve months ago, China ranked as one of the main preoccupations of the Bush 
Administration. Last Dec. 9, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and 
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger flew off on a secret mission 
to Beijing in which they offered friendly toasts to some of the same Chinese 
leaders who had called in troops six months earlier to clear protesters from 
Tian An Men Square with brute force. 
</P>
<P>
Now, by contrast, the Administration is maintaining a cool distance from 
Beijing. Administration officials no longer treat China as so important to the 
United States as it was a year ago, and some of them remain miffed over what 
they see as a failure of the Chinese leadership to respond to Bush's overtures. 
</P>
<P>
"Their (Chinese leaders') failure to continue to be responsive to the President 
has changed the political landscape," one Administration official acknowledged 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, Japan and European governments have moved to lift many of their 
sanctions against China, unblocking frozen loans and restoring diplomatic 
exchanges. While the Bush Administration may take some small steps in the same 
direction, another senior Administration official said that "I wouldn't look 
for anything dramatic" in new U.S. overtures to China. 
</P>
<P>
"All of our allies have decided to move ahead with China, leaving us 
increasingly isolated," observed Harry E. Harding, a China scholar at the 
Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
There are a several reasons underlying the Bush Administration's pronounced 
change of attitude: 
</P>
<P>
Domestic politics. Bush's efforts last year to mend fences with the leadership 
in Beijing proved extremely unpopular and were attacked both by Democrats and 
conservative Republicans. In Congress and in the American business community, 
there has been a marked decline in support for close U.S. ties with China. 
</P>
<P>
* Instability in China. Many U.S. policy-makers believe that China's current 
leadership is deeply divided and won't last long. Indeed, some officials and 
analysts now foresee the possibility of dramatic political changes or even a 
coup d'etat in the struggle for power that may follow the death of paramount 
leader Deng Xiaoping. 
</P>
<P>
* Geopolitical strategy. The end of the Cold War has reduced the importance to 
the United States of close relations with China, which since the early 1970s 
had been based upon a shared perception in both Washington and Beijing that the 
Soviet Union was a formidable military adversary. 
</P>
<P>
* Bitterness over the failed Scowcroft trip. Last December and January, Bush 
Administration officials believed the Chinese regime would quickly allow 
dissident Fang Lizhi to leave his confinement inside the U.S. Embassy in 
Beijing and would end its ideological attacks on the United States. Instead, 
Fang was not released for another six months, and the ideological diatribes 
continue even now. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Chinese leaders) don't understand what's happened to this relationship," 
says one Administration official. "They don't understand the political costs of 
what they did last January and February." 
</P>
<P>
Those political costs were demonstrated Oct. 18, when the U.S. House of 
Representatives cast a series of votes against China that would have been 
unimaginable even a year earlier. The House voted 247 to 174 to strip China of 
its most-favored-nation trade status, the privilege that permits foreign 
producers to sell their goods in the United States under the lowest available 
tariffs. And the House voted 383 to 30 to attach a series of tough human rights 
conditions that China must meet before it gets the trade benefits next year. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of these measures became law. They died in the Senate during the final, 
hectic days before Congress adjourned. But the congressional efforts to place 
human rights conditions on the renewal of trade benefits for China will almost 
certainly be revived next year. 
</P>
<P>
Even within the U.S. business community, which lobbied Congress for a 
continuation of the benefits, enthusiasm for China is clearly on the wane. 
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investment in China is entering a new phase that may offer fewer 
opportunities for American firms," the U.S.-China Business Council declared 
last month. "Although official Chinese statistics show foreign investment on 
the rise in 1990, recent changes in the investment climate are working to the 
detriment of many American, European and Japanese investors." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, after the crackdown on the democracy protests in Tian An Men Square, 
China accused the United States of seeking to undermine and overthrow communism 
in China through a long-term strategy of subversion. The regime called this 
strategy "peaceful evolution." 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Bush Administration officials now believe the President's 
repeated efforts at reconciliation with China have failed because hard-line 
elements within the leadership in Beijing killed them. The hard-liners feared 
that a thaw with the United States would give a political edge to more moderate 
forces in the Chinese leadership, these U.S. officials say. 
</P>
<P>
China's campaign against "peaceful evolution" began soon after Scowcroft and 
Eagleburger's first top-secret mission to China in July, 1989. A similar 
anti-American campaign was launched soon after their second trip to Beijing in 
December, 1989, and there were echoes of the campaign once again after the 
release of dissident Fang last June. 
</P>
<P>
"When we have done things and the moderates (in China) have tried to do things 
to improve the relationship, a very strong reaction has set in and stymied 
efforts to get things moving in a consistent manner," one Administration 
policy-maker says. 
</P>
<P>
Within the U.S. intelligence community and among American academic experts on 
China, the belief is growing that over the next few years, China will face 
further political upheavals. 
</P>
<P>
Deng, who took the reins of power in China in late 1978, is 86 years old. He 
has not been seen in public since July.

"We don't dismiss the reports about him being in ill health," says one U.S. 
intelligence specialist. "But we've got nothing firm." 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is latent instability there (in China) that we ignore at our own 
peril," observes Jonathan D. Pollack of the RAND Corp. "I think we ought to be 
looking at a whole range of options, in which a seizure of power by the 
military is one possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Pollack adds, "I don't see stability in the military ranks. These 
are very anxious, frightened people." 
</P>
<P>
Last September, officials of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA 
sat down at a conference with U.S. China scholars to swap ideas about the 
future of China's People's Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the big questions was, 'When Deng dies, what will the PLA do?' " says 
Paul H. B. Godwin, a China scholar at the National War College, who took part 
in the conference. "Everyone agreed there are deep fissures in Chinese society. 
There were divergent views on whether the PLA could fracture or not." 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. experts at the conference contended that China's army could split up 
along regional lines or that there could be disputes among competing factions 
within the military. Other participants argued that the PLA will remain a 
unified force and will try to refrain from intervening in politics. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, a month after the death of Mao Tse-tung, senior leaders in China's 
army and security apparatus engineered the sudden arrest and imprisonment of 
Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, and other top Chinese leaders who had propelled the 
Cultural Revolution. Some U.S. officials and scholars suggest such a scenario 
could be played out once again after the death of Deng. 
</P>
<P>
"The military is going to be all-important in determining the succession," says 
a Bush Administration official. "China has a long tradition going back many 
dynasties of the praetorian guard overseeing the succession and sometimes 
changing the dynasties. . . . There's a good chance it's going to happen again 
when the current leadership array, the elder generation, passes away or becomes 
incapacitated." 
</P>
<P>
The unpredictability of the political situation in Beijing reduces the 
incentives for the Bush Administration to renew a close relationship with 
China. In any event, experts say, the need for close U.S. ties with China has 
been dramatically undercut by the changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-1989, at the time of the Tian An Men Square upheavals, some 
Administration officials still believed that the changes in the Soviet Union 
under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev might not be permanent. One senior 
Administration official privately warned that a new hard-line Soviet leadership 
could emerge and link up with hard-liners in China in a way that would threaten 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Now, by contrast, even the doubters within the Bush Administration see the 
Soviet Union more as an ally than as an enemy. The unprecedented changes in 
U.S.-Soviet relations have given the Administration new freedom to ignore China 
in its global strategic calculations. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials still view China as significant to American foreign 
policy in some lesser ways. China is a permanent member of the U.N. Security 
Council. Its cooperation is important for the Administration's current efforts 
to obtain U.N. resolutions against Iraq and for efforts to bring peace to 
Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
For these reasons, the Administration may clear the way for more frequent 
high-level contacts with Chinese officials, such as the two meetings this fall 
between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to stay in touch with them," one Administration official says. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials make clear they will make no new attempt at reconciliation 
with the Chinese leadership such as the missions by Scowcroft last year. 
</P>
<P>
"In the absence of any evidence that the (political) situation has been 
resolved in China, it's not very fruitful to try to make a new effort on our 
part to reach out to the Chinese," an Administration policy-maker said.

SOVIETS SHED SUPERPOWER ROLE, STRESS EUROPEAN TIES

<P>
A new European power will make its debut at the all-European summit meeting in 
Paris this week -- the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will not be attending the Conference on Security 
and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) as the leader of one of the two global 
superpowers, except to end a role that the Soviet Union has played for four 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he will be anchoring his troubled country firmly in Europe, which he 
calls "our common home" and which his advisers describe as "the growth 
Continent." 
</P>
<P>
Moscow, to put it directly, is taking itself out of superpower politics and 
resuming its position as "a great European power," in the words of Soviet 
foreign policy specialists. 
</P>
<P>
The implications of this shift in Soviet policy are far-reaching, affecting the 
balance of power around the world, ending the bipolar Soviet-American rivalry, 
extending the unification of Europe and strengthening the development of 
international institutions. 
</P>
<P>
While other important elements are also at work, the fundamental transformation 
of Soviet foreign policy in the past five years has been crucial to the recent 
international realignment, and Soviet foreign affairs specialists predict more 
changes, particularly in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Europe is coming into an absolutely new stage of its history," Alexander 
Churbanyan, a leading Soviet specialist on Europe, said last week in an 
interview. "In the next two or three years, we will be creating a new 
architecture, politically, economically and socially, for Europe, and not just 
for this decade but for the start of the century we will be entering. 
</P>
<P>
"For the Soviet Union, this is of the utmost importance because it means our 
reintegration into a civilization from which we have been cut off, not just for 
the 45 years of the Cold War, but even longer. . . . And this reintegration 
will come, we hope and believe, at the point of 'takeoff,' economically and 
politically, both for Europe and for us." 
</P>
<P>
Although it retains a substantial nuclear arsenal and conventional military 
power, a special relationship with the United States and interests in Asia and 
the Middle East that befit it as a transcontinental nation, the Soviet Union 
considers itself very much a down-sized superpower today, lacking both the 
resources and the desire to play the global role it previously pursued. 
</P>
<P>
"We never understood ourselves as a real superpower," Sergei A. Karaganov, 
deputy director of the Institute of Europe, a leading Soviet think tank, said 
in an interview. "We saw ourselves as underdogs, in fact, and in trying to 
compensate we pretended that we and our allies were the equal of the United 
States and its allies. In fact, we overreached, and it brought us very few 
pluses politically and none economically. 
</P>
<P>
"We are renouncing this status -- that is one quite significant meaning of the 
Paris conference -- and we are resuming the role that Russia has played 
historically, that of a great European power. Our efforts to match the United 
States as a superpower hastened our decline and masked that of Washington." 
</P>
<P>
To those who have advocated this basic rethinking of Kremlin foreign policy and 
attempted to turn the loss of its superpower influence into an advantage, this 
transformation frees the Soviet Union to concentrate its energy and resources 
on resolving its own multiple political and economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
"This reduces the potential for foreign conflicts and gives us a freer hand in 
foreign policy," Karaganov argued. "But the key thing its that it allows us to 
concentrate on what is really decisive for our security and prosperity -- the 
restructuring of our economy and our political system. The Soviet Union's 
difficulties are, in some respects, the concern of all Europe; certainly, they 
are the greatest threat to our security today. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If we resolve these problems, we may in time reverse our country's 
international decline, which has been going on for some years. If we don't, 
well, then we are really talking about the survival of the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
But Karaganov, Churbanyan and others argue that the restoration of the Soviet 
Union's place in Europe will have important consequences for the country's 
political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"The postwar division of Europe was a strategic disaster for the Soviet Union, 
a blunder of enormous magnitude," Karaganov asserted. "Yes, we gained a buffer 
in Eastern Europe, and Stalin had the satisfaction of seeing socialism spread. 
</P>
<P>
"But look at the hatred that brought the Soviet Union, the suspicion, the 
isolation. We were forced into alliances with weak countries. We were cut off 
from European civilization and the continental economy. Internally, it created 
a system of conservative politics and institutionalized the military-industrial 
complex. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"To put it another way, 1989 brought our liberation along with that of Eastern 
and Central Europe," he said. "With the reduction of NATO troops, particularly 
that of American forces on our Western borders, our security is enhanced. Our 
neighbors no longer view us as occupiers. The European Community is opening its 
market to us and investing here. Real changes are coming." 
</P>
<P>
And Soviet foreign affairs specialists increasingly are convinced that Europe 
is where their country should position itself. To them it means greater 
security, political stability, economic growth and cultural ties. 
</P>
<P>
What they are now discussing is the "architecture" of this new Europe, hoping 
to shape it to Soviet needs. 
</P>
<P>
"When we proposed the concept of a common European home, many in the West saw 
it as a tricky new Soviet attempt to dominate the Continent," Vladimir G. 
Baranovsky, a European specialist at the Institute of World Economy and 
International Relations, another prominent Soviet think tank, said in an 
interview, "and there were probably grounds for suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
"But the pan-European movement has won wide acceptance. Hans-Dietrich Genscher 
(the German foreign minister) talks about the 'new European political order,' 
and President Francois Mitterrand (of France) speaks of the 'confederation of 
Europe.' The idea of the 'common European home' was ours, and we are happy to 
see others develop it because we will need a new framework to replace that 
(which was) built in the Cold War and now, thankfully, gone." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union is pushing for the transformation of the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which for the past 15 years has been mostly 
a series of multilateral negotiations and occasional ministerial meetings, into 
a full-fledged institution of the new Europe to deal with the aftermath of the 
Cold War and the new problems likely to develop in the future. A key project is 
creation of a conflict-prevention center, but further arms-reduction talks are 
also a priority over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
"Problems are not going to disappear, the euphoria will quickly wear thin and 
the reality of this 'new Europe' will be harder than people think," Alexei G. 
Arbatov, a specialist in security and arms control, commented in an interview. 
"And the ways in which we dealt with problems and with one another during the 
Cold War are no longer appropriate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We still have huge standing armies, but it matters a great deal how we reduce 
them so we do not disrupt the stability we have achieved. We have the 
possibility of internal unrest that could now spill across borders. There is 
the issue of migration from the East, there is the potential for old rivalries 
and nationalisms to stir again and there is the possibility perhaps of an 
upheaval like the breakup of Yugoslavia. These could even make some yearn for 
the 'good old days.' " 
</P>
<P>
A senior Western diplomat, asking not to be quoted by name as he briefed 
journalists on the Paris meeting, said that the United States and its North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization allies are ready to support this transition. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Soviet Union wants to use this process for legitimate security goals, 
let's help them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Soviet diplomat, who also has been involved in the CSCE since the 
preliminary talks began in Helsinki in 1972, described its evolution as "a 
demonstration of flexibility, pragmatism and adaptability." 
</P>
<P>
"If there was the political will, this all-European process provided the way, 
and we are convinced that it will continue to do so and deserves to be 
institutionalized further," he said, asking not to be quoted by name. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a process that our country is quite happy with. It is productive, it 
enhances security, it encourages a multilateral approach to problems, it 
stresses cooperation rather than confrontation. The gains may have been 
incremental, but they now add up to quite a change."

JUSTICES REFUSE TO ALLOW AIRING OF NORIEGA TAPES; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: THE ACTION AGAINST CABLE NEWS NETWORK MAY SIGNAL A NEW WILLINGNESS TO 
LIMIT PRESS FREEDOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a decision that may signal new willingness to limit press freedom, the 
Supreme Court on Sunday refused to allow Cable News Network to broadcast 
government-recorded phone calls between deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel A. 
Noriega and his lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The high court on a 7-2 vote let stand an order by a judge in Miami requiring 
CNN to turn over the tapes to him for his examination. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court has never formally upheld an order barring the publication or 
broadcast of news and information. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's action by the high court is not a ruling on the issue, but rather a 
refusal to lift a temporary ban issued Nov. 8 by Judge William M. Hoeveler. 
After CNN complies with Hoeveler's order, the justices could later hear a 
formal appeal and issue a written ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the court's decision Sunday marked a sharp departure from how 
"prior restraint" orders had been treated before. For nearly 60 years, the 
court had characterized as "presumptively unconstitutional" any order blocking 
a publication. 
</P>
<P>
Press attorneys and CNN officials said they were "stunned" by the court's 
action and said it amounted to "censorship" of a news organization. 
</P>
<P>
In his order, Hoeveler said he was not imposing a "prior restraint" on CNN 
because the broadcast ban was only temporary and intended only to give him a 
chance to decide whether a permanent ban was needed. The Justice Department 
took the same view in briefs filed Saturday, arguing that a "temporary" ban on 
publication is not a "prior restraint." 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court issued only a brief order Sunday and did not explain the 
reasons for its decision. However, if the justices now accept the view that a 
"temporary" ban is not a "prior restraint," it could have a far-reaching impact 
on the news media, television broadcasters and book publishers. 
</P>
<P>
Under this view, the subject of an unfavorable news story, TV program or book 
could seek a judge's order to block its publication or broadcast until the 
contents were turned over to the court for examination. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, it has been assumed by 1st Amendment lawyers that such court orders, 
even if "temporary," are unconstitutional restrictions on the freedom of the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the court would be willing to tolerate a prior restraint in 
these circumstances signals a new era in 1st Amendment jurisprudence," said 
Jane Kirtley, executive director of the Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the 
Press. "It will have a far-reaching impact going beyond this case extending to 
many cases in state and federal courts around the country." 
</P>
<P>
Justice Thurgood Marshall, who dissented Sunday along with Justice Sandra Day 
O'Connor, called the CNN case one of "extraordinary consequence for freedom of 
the press." He called the ban that was left intact Sunday a "drastic remedy" 
not justified by any potential harm from the broadcast of Noriega's phone calls 
from prison. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue raised by this petition," Marshall wrote, "is whether a trial court 
may enjoin publication of information alleged to threaten a criminal 
defendant's right to a fair trial without any threshold showing that the 
information will indeed cause such harm and that suppression is the only means 
of averting it." 
</P>
<P>
Voting against CNN were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron 
R. White, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. 
Kennedy and David H. Souter, the court's newest member. 
</P>
<P>
CNN President Tom Johnson called the court's decision "a loss of a battle in a 
continuing war against censorship." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said in a statement that the network would immediately turn the tapes 
in its possession over to Hoeveler. He said CNN is "confident that after he 
reviews them he will decide on the merits to deny the prior restraint. 
</P>
<P>
"CNN is committed to establishing its full freedom to telecast newsworthy 
information to the American people and it will pursue this case vigorously in 
order to do so," Johnson added. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, who is awaiting trial on drug-dealing and money-laundering charges, is 
being held in a federal prison near Miami. Federal prison authorities monitor 
and tape record all inmates' telephone conversations -- except those between 
inmates and their attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
But the CNN tape recordings reportedly contain some conversations between 
Noriega and his defense lawyers. CNN began airing the tapes last weekend, but 
the federal judge slapped an order on the network barring further broadcasts 
until he had heard them. 
</P>
<P>
The network refused to comply with Hoeveler's order and appealed the question 
to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's defense attorney, Jon May, said Sunday that CNN had opened a 
"Pandora's box. This is a case of the messenger shooting itself. To whatever 
extent the media may complain this is a significant adverse decision, CNN has 
only itself to blame." 
</P>
<P>
Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr, who argued the government's case, said in 
papers filed Saturday that while the press has a right to freely disseminate 
news, the "rule of law" allows a judge in some rare instances to temporarily 
preempt publication. 
</P>
<P>
He argued that the 1st Amendment does not supersede other laws and did not in 
this case provide sufficient cause for undermining the government's 
high-visibility drug-trafficking case against Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Starr acknowledged that extended prior restraint may be justified "only in the 
most extraordinary circumstances." But, he added, the rule of law demands that 
a judge determine whether the current case meets those criteria. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this means a fairly important change in the law, definitely a 
retrenchment from what they said in the Pentagon Papers case," said Georgetown 
University law professor Louis M. Seidman. "After all, the government in that 
case was asking for more time to study what is in the papers. I think you'll 
see more judges issuing gag orders now." 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, the Supreme Court ruled 6 to 3 that the Richard M. Nixon 
Administration could not block the New York Times and the Washington Post from 
printing the Defense Department's secret history of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
University of Colorado Law Dean Gene Nichol, a 1st Amendment expert, noted that 
Sunday's decision shows the loss of Justice William J. Brennan Jr., a staunch 
free speech advocate who retired in July. 
</P>
<P>
"The court that decided the Pentagon Papers case would not have done this," 
Nichol said. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, prior restraints have been considered permissible only in the most 
extreme cases, such as to preserve military security during wartime. 
</P>
<P>
"Our precedents make unmistakably clear that any prior restraint of expression 
comes to this court bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional 
validity and that the proponent of this drastic remedy carries a heavy burden 
of showing justification of its imposition," Marshall wrote in his dissent, 
quoting from earlier cases. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not see how the prior restraint imposed in this case can be reconciled 
with these teachings," he said.

<P>
Mamie Eisenhower, chin in hand and hair upswept, smiles subtly from the canvas 
hanging on the wall. Not far away, oil paintings of snowy landscapes hang amid 
desert scenes, mountain vistas and several more portraits -- a young boy, a 
military leader, Abraham Lincoln, even a self-portrait. 
</P>
<P>
The artist is the same but the signature in the lower right corner of each 
piece varies a bit: "DE" on one. "DDE" on another. On most it reads simply 
"Eisenhower." 
</P>
<P>
Dwight David Eisenhower never fancied himself to be a serious artist, but an 
exhibit of his art, opening today at the Richard Nixon Library, shows the 
nation's 34th President had talent with a brush and a canvas. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was very good," said Amanda Fish, acting curator at the library and 
an artist herself. "I think people will be surprised." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit is made up of 22 paintings and one drawing -- a sketch of an 
unidentified man made when Eisenhower was President -- that show the gentle, 
expressive side of a man who rose to power commanding U.S. troops in World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
"He called them his daubs," Fish said. "He did this as pure enjoyment. You can 
see how peaceful and serene they are. 
</P>
<P>
"He always resisted any efforts to read philosophy or hidden meanings into his 
paintings," said John H. Taylor, director of the Nixon Library. Eisenhower 
often did not even date the paintings, give them titles or identify the places 
he depicted, Taylor said. "He described them as a way to relieve pressure. They 
were pure relaxation, pure recreation for him." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the paintings are of landscapes. The family farm in Gettysburg, Pa., 
was a favorite subject -- one painting shows the house surrounded by green 
trees, with a putting green in the foreground; another shows the home's old 
brown barn, swathed in snow. There are several paintings of lakes, with 
villages or mountains nearby. The desert scenes possibly are depictions of the 
sights near Palm Desert, where Eisenhower had a home, Fish said. 
</P>
<P>
Another painting shows Eisenhower's grandson, David, at about age 7, with a 
golf club, squinting into the sun as he prepares to hit a golf ball. That 
painting, and several others, are on loan from David and Julie Nixon 
Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
And there are five traditional portraits -- wife Mamie, granddaughter Anne, a 
self-portrait, Viscount Montgomery of Alamein and Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
The Lincoln portrait was painted in 1953, Eisenhower's first year in the White 
House. Eisenhower probably based his painting on another portrait of the 16th 
President but may have drawn inspiration from his surroundings, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
The artwork is displayed next to a permanent exhibit at the library that 
chronicles Nixon's years as vice president under Eisenhower. Taylor denied a 
report that two new Watergate tape shows were delayed to make way for the 
Eisenhower art exhibit. "It was not an either/or proposition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One Watergate tape is now available for listening at the library, and Taylor 
plans eventually to offer two more tapes. But the current Watergate exhibit 
offers "a complete Watergate story. We feel utterly confident of that. And we 
decided we wanted to concentrate on other areas. . . . My aim is to put on 
diverse, exciting exhibits here." No date has been set for offering the other 
two Watergate tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said Eisenhower's first venture into oil painting came at age 58. While 
he was president of Columbia University, Eisenhower watched as artist Thomas 
Stephens painted a portrait of Mamie. After Stephens left the room, Eisenhower 
reportedly picked up the pallet and brush and, using Stephens' artwork as a 
model, began painting his own portrait of Mamie on the back side of a crate 
that was handy, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens, upon seeing Eisenhower's first attempt, pronounced it quite good and 
a few days later sent Eisenhower a full set of oils. Eisenhower left the set 
alone for a while, "but then he went at it," creating about 260 paintings in 
the last 20 years of his life, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Eisenhower kept a studio on the second floor of the White House, and despite 
his busy schedule, kept up his hobby while President. 
</P>
<P>
All of the paintings in the exhibit are privately owned by friends and family 
of the Eisenhowers -- with the exception of the portrait of Lincoln, which 
belongs to a Gettysburg museum, and the one of Montgomery, which is on loan 
from the British Embassy in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit will be presented in the museum's Lobby Gallery through Jan. 27.

THE DEATHS OF 6 WHALES, 3 OF THEM PRIZED ORCAS, RAISE QUESTIONS AT THE SAN 
DIEGO THEME PARK

When Bob Lavenberg called Sea World last month to say that a live megamouth 
shark had been captured off Dana Point -- only the second such known occurrence 
ever -- he thought he was making the San Diego theme park an offer it could not 
refuse: the opportunity to house and study a species so rare that, until 1976, 
scientists were not aware it existed. 
</P>
<P>
Lavenberg, curator of fishes at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural 
History, was surprised when Sea World officials declined. They told Lavenberg 
they lacked the expertise and facilities to ensure the 15-foot megamouth's 
survival. But as well as worrying about the shark's health, Sea World officials 
seemed to fear for the park's image. 
</P>
<P>
"They said, 'One of the things we don't want to do is take this animal and have 
it die on us,' " Lavenberg said. "No. 1 was they did not have the facilities to 
take it, and No. 2 was there was a potential that it would die. They were very 
sensitive about this. . . . They did not want to have it die on their hands." 
</P>
<P>
In light of the park's recent history, such sensitivity is not surprising. In 2 
1/2 years, six whales have died at the San Diego park -- including three killer 
whales, the park's most popular attraction. Officials maintain that except for 
Kandu, a killer whale that died after an accident during a performance, all 
died of old age or diseases that could have stricken them in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
The string of fatalities has cast a shadow over the private amusement park. Sea 
World officials acknowledge that the losses have taken a toll on staff morale. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we would ever step back away from helping animals just because 
we were concerned that somebody was going to start taking (shots) at us," said 
Brad Andrews, a Sea World vice president and assistant zoological director 
based in Florida. How decisions are made about housing animals "boils down to 
what's best for the animal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"No one likes to accentuate the negative," said Bob Gault, president of Sea 
World of California, who added that people come to the park "to escape the 
day-to-day hassles of life," not to confront them. Gault asserts that, 
especially since they were bought by Anheuser-Busch from Harcourt Brace 
Jovanovich in 1989, the four parks have dealt more frankly with the passing of 
their animals. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not like Disney, where a ride breaks down and they can just go plug in 
another one," Gault said. "In life there is birth and there is death, and at 
Sea World we experience both of them." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, questions have arisen about how deaths may affect future births -- 
specifically the captive breeding of killer whales. This September, Kanduke, 
one of the chain's two remaining male killer whales, died unexpectedly at the 
Florida park. Since then, Sea World veterinarians have been shuffling breeding 
plans to manage what some experts say is a poor gender ratio. 
</P>
<P>
Without federal permits to capture killer whales in the wild, the four parks -- 
in San Diego; San Antonio, Tex.; Aurora, Ohio, and Orlando, Fla. -- depend 
largely on newborns to stock their exhibits and shows. But, among them, the 
four parks have 12 females and just one male: Kotar, an orca at the Texas park. 
</P>
<P>
"That's certainly not optimal," said Tom Laughlin, a marine biologist with the 
National Marine Fisheries Service in Seattle. "Biologically, one wants to have 
heterozygosity in the gene pool -- more than one male contributing. The more 
vibrant the strain -- the more diverse -- the more resistant offspring is to 
disease." 
</P>
<P>
The necessity of breeding healthy young is heightened by Sea World's economic 
dependence on killer whales. As well as being the star attraction in the San 
Diego park's "Baby Shamu Celebration" show, killer whales are the centerpiece 
of the park's marketing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World visitors are invited to shop for Shamu-embossed gifts, from sweat 
shirts to jewelry, and to pose for $4 framed snapshots with a stuffed orca at 
the Shamu Photo Stand. The name "Shamu," which is used for whichever whale is 
performing in the 5-million-gallon Shamu Stadium, is a registered trademark. 
</P>
<P>
"They're one of the key elements in the draw," said Harrison Price, a 
consultant in attraction management and development and a former Sea World 
board member. 
</P>
<P>
A National Marine Fisheries Service inventory of Sea World's marine mammals, 
living and dead, shows that over the San Diego park's nearly 30 years of 
operation, scores of animals have died largely unnoticed by the public. When an 
animal has a public identity, its passing attracts attention. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1988, Orky sank to the bottom of his pool and died just three 
days after the birth of a calf he fathered -- Orkid, commonly known as Baby 
Shamu. Estimated to be 27 to 32 years old, Orky was the oldest killer whale in 
captivity at the time, and a necropsy conducted by Sea World showed he had died 
of acute pneumonia brought on by old age. 
</P>
<P>
Nine months later, a 15-year-old beluga whale named Little Girl died of 
cardiopulmonary collapse. On loan from the Minnesota Zoo, Little Girl had come 
to San Diego to accompany Big Mouth, a sick male beluga receiving treatment for 
an inflammatory bone disease. Big Mouth died the next summer, as did an ailing 
false killer whale named Asia. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Kandu's death that shocked most people. In August, 1989, during a 
performance, the 4,600-pound mother of Orkid charged into another whale, Corky, 
and broke her jaw. The impact caused hemorrhaging of major arteries in the 
14-year-old whale's nasal passages and Kandu bled to death. 
</P>
<P>
Memories of that fatality -- called a freak accident by Sea World officials -- 
were still fresh when Knootka, a killer whale in her mid- to late-20s, died of 
a rare fungal infection last March. Knootka's was the first death at the San 
Diego park since Anheuser-Busch had taken the helm, and officials were 
noticeably more open about the whale's illness and death. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to be up-front about it," said Dan LeBlanc, who handles media 
inquiries at the San Diego park. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews said the recent deaths have prompted changes in breeding schedules -- 
some of which reach 15 years into the future. The lone male, Kotar, is not 
related to any of the 12 females, he said, so there is probably no genetic 
reason why he cannot mate with them all. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews said the program -- which has produced five healthy captive-born babies 
in as many years -- is self-sufficient. Recent blood samples taken from Keneau 
in Texas and Kasatka in San Diego indicate a high likelihood that both are 
pregnant by Kotar, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the park's new openness will affect public opinion is unclear. Sea 
World's attendance, like that of most Southern California amusement parks, is 
down this year from last year -- a downturn that Price, the consultant, 
attributes to a decrease in long-distance tourism. During the first eight 
months of 1989, nearly 3 million people visited the park -- about 200,000 more 
than the same period this year. 
</P>
<P>
A study by the Southwest Fishery Science Center in La Jolla found that the 
probability of a whale surviving one year in a U.S. park is roughly the same as 
in the wild -- 90% to 95%.

<P>
THINK TANK: HOOVER INSTITUTION BECOMES HEADMASTER TO YOUNG FOREIGN SERVICE 
OFFICERS FROM EASTERN EUROPE.

<P>
George P. Shultz sauntered by, heading to his office where he is working on his 
memoirs, while Michal Wyganowski and Wojciech Iwanczyk, rising stars in the 
Polish foreign ministry, chatted on a shaded bench at the Hoover Institution. 
</P>
<P>
In an auditorium down a flight of stairs, Edwin Meese III was telling an 
assembled crowd why drugs should never be legalized. Wyganowski, Iwanczyk and 
10 other Polish and Hungarian diplomats could catch up with the former attorney 
general at a dinner that evening. They had another engagement that afternoon 
more relevant to their mission: a seminar about the intricacies of the World 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The irony of it all is not lost on anyone involved. The Hoover Institution, a 
think tank renowed for its conservative bent and the primary brain trust for 
President Ronald Reagan, is taking on a new mission -- acting as headmaster to 
a dozen young diplomats from Eastern Europe in a fledgling program designed to 
train them in the ways of modern statecraft. 
</P>
<P>
"We never would have predicted it," said John Raisian, director of the Hoover 
Institution on the Stanford University campus. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, many of Hoover's scholars were part of an Administration that 
declared the Soviet Union to be an evil empire. But for the past two months, 
Shultz, physicist Edward Teller and many lesser known yet important architects 
of the Reagan Revolution have lent their talents and expertise to one of the 
more extraordinary examples of the dramatic changes in East-West relations. 
</P>
<P>
"The things that have happened (in Eastern Europe) were the object of our 
policy, and it worked," Hoover fellow Shultz said in matter-of-fact tones, as 
he prepared to get back to work on his papers. 
</P>
<P>
The former secretary of state pointed out that when "you end the Cold War, 
societies come out of their cocoons and there are new problems that need to be 
addressed." 
</P>
<P>
One such problem became evident to Shultz when Jerzy Makarczyk, Poland's deputy 
minister of foreign affairs, told him in February that there was a lack of 
trusted officers in the foreign ministry, and there was no place to train new 
diplomats. Shultz suggested that Poland send some of its promising foreign 
service officers to the Hoover Institution. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of political scientists, free-market economists and former U.S. 
State Department officials, Shultz and the other Hoover fellows are hoping to 
help mold some of the new generation of Eastern European foreign officers and 
perhaps shape policies in those nations. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to change things, you've got to start with the young people," 
Shultz said. 
</P>
<P>
In this first group of diplomats-in-training, the oldest is 29, though they all 
have post-graduate degrees. Most worked for their ministries for only a few 
days when they boarded jets bound for California. They never would have gone to 
work for their governments if they still were controlled by the Communist 
Party. As it was, many of them replaced old-line party members. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aware that we are lucky," said Ervin Szucs, 27, one of the four 
Hungarians in the program. When he returns to Budapest next month, he will be 
one of two officers on the U.S. desk responsible for analyzing developments in 
this country. Two other Hungarians are private secretaries to their foreign 
minister. The fourth, a lawyer, will work in the legal affairs department. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats have high aspirations. Some hope to become ambassadors. One spoke 
of running for a parliamentary seat one day. Some may stay in the ministries 
for only a few years, then become capitalists. None is certain what is in store 
for them or their countries. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like a well-established institution," Wyganowski, 29, said of the 
Polish foreign ministry. "The country has been through hell. You don't know 
what will happen." 
</P>
<P>
Hoover scholars have high hopes for their proteges. "These are people who will 
percolate up in their systems," said economist Charles McLure, a tax specialist 
who served in Reagan's Treasury Department. "Twenty years from now, you may 
have high-ranking Polish or Hungarian officials who went through this program." 
</P>
<P>
Early in the program, McLure noticed that one of them bought a telephone. 
Simple though that act was, such a purchase in any Eastern European country 
could have taken months or years. 
</P>
<P>
"These lessons are not lost on them," he said. "There is an interplay between 
economic freedom and political freedom. They are not divorced. We're not 
teaching it. But I think they are seeing it." 
</P>
<P>
They have been serious students, learning quickly the basics of free market 
economies that were unknown in their countries. They have sat through dozens of 
lectures on topics ranging from basic economics to the ethics of statecraft, 
global warming and the workings of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
There also has been time for play. McLure took them to Yosemite for a weekend, 
though they talk as much about the grandeur of El Capitan as they do about the 
sleepless night spent in the unheated tent cabin. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the Poles pooled their capital and bought a 1975 Rabbit for $150 and 
have gone on excursions to Santa Cruz and beaches. They have spent time in 
Monterey, gone wine tasting, and last week, took an all-too-short tour of that 
true monument to American consumption, the massive Price Club warehouse store a 
few miles north in Redwood City. 
</P>
<P>
Jacek Sawicz, 27, a specialist on American arms-control policy, studied the 
stereos until he found what he was looking for: a dual cassette model with 
detachable speakers and compact disc player for $189.99, made in Japan. He paid 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
Others left with piles of towels, tennis balls, multicolored underwear and 
Snickers bars in bulk. Wyganowski, 29, bought a watch he long had promised his 
wife. He could have found the same brand in Poland, but it probably would have 
been a counterfeit. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, you're practically sure it's a Seiko," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During their stay, the diplomats lived with Stanford students. Along the way, 
they heard long-standing criticism that Hoover and its scholars, with their 
ties to the Reagan Administration, have a conservative and Republican slant. 
</P>
<P>
These Poles and Hungarians find the criticism somewhat curious. As they see it, 
Reagan was the President who challenged the Soviet Union's dominance over 
Eastern Europe. Hoover provided him with the thinkers who shaped that policy. 
</P>
<P>
Iwanczyk spent the Christmas of 1981 in New York, separated from his father. 
Martial law had been imposed in Poland, and it was the saddest Christmas of his 
life, he said. He remembered how moved he was when Reagan urged people to light 
candles in solidarity with the Polish people. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's great," Iwanczyk said of Reagan. "To be here, where Shultz is 
still working, is an honor." 
</P>
<P>
Like the other diplomats, Iwanczyk, 28, was drawn to the foreign service by the 
prospect that he could help his nation. A graduate of Warsaw University law 
school, he was working for the Polish airline when he heeded his government's 
appeal for young people to join the ministry. He signed an employment contract 
on Sept. 3, and was bound for the United States on Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a patriotic way to help the country," Iwanczyk said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of them had no idea that Stanford or Hoover existed, let alone that people 
such as Hungarian-born physicist Teller were among its fellows. Teller helped 
persuade Reagan to create the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Though SDI remains controversial here, the Hungarians and Poles believe it 
forced the Soviet military into realizing that it could not compete with the 
United States. That helped bring about changes in the Soviet leadership that 
allowed Eastern European nations to break away, they believe. 
</P>
<P>
Sawicz, the U.S. arms control policy expert, made a point of visiting the 
"father of the H-bomb" to ask him about Star Wars. Teller opened the 
conversation by probing Sawicz's knowledge of SDI. "I passed and he decided to 
talk to me," Sawicz said. 
</P>
<P>
As the program nears its conclusion, goodby dinners have begun. McLure hosted 
one last week. Conversation ranged from the legalization of drugs to American 
light beer -- a liquid that "has nothing to do with beer," one of the 
Hungarians said in disgust. At the end, the McLures served a cake, inscribed 
with the words, "Best wishes to you and your countries." 
</P>
<P>
Hoover director Raisian said he is "virtually certain" that the program will 
continue, though the cost may be pared. Hoover spent $20,000 per student this 
time, funded by about half a dozen corporations and foundations. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous amount of interest," he said. "Czechoslovakia is calling 
us on a practically weekly basis asking when the next session starts." 
</P>
<P>
When the Eastern Europeans turned to the Hoover Institution for help, there was 
no hesitation. How could there be? Hoover fellow Charles Hill, a top aide to 
Shultz during the Reagan years, pointed out that a founding principle of the 
institution was that "our system works, your's will fail." 
</P>
<P>
"So when it fails, and they come to us and say, 'Help us out,' we can't say, 
'No,' " Hill said.

PRESERVATION: A CARLSBAD WOMAN, REMEMBERING WHEN THE CISCO KID AND HIS

<P>
Once a week, the Kindle kids tumbled into place before the family's clunky 
black-and-white Muntz television set, waiting for the man with saucer-wide eyes 
and the trim, bent-nail mustache. 
</P>
<P>
Within moments came the words that seemed to stretch all the way around the 
block, the very words that always catapulted the four little viewers into 
laughter and goofy imitation. 
</P>
<P>
"Ohhhhhhh CEEEEEskohhh," said Pancho. 
</P>
<P>
"Ohhhhhhh PAAAAnchohhh," replied Cisco. 
</P>
<P>
"You could have given my kids banana splits and they wouldn't have come away 
from that TV show," Joan Kindle recalled of those days back in the '50s, when 
they lived out East and when Leo Carrillo and Duncan Renaldo thrilled children 
across America in "The Cisco Kid." 
</P>
<P>
The Kindles especially liked Carrillo as Pancho, whose mirth, malaprops and 
other inventive mutilations of the language ("Leh's went!" for "Let's go!") 
could not disguise his simple dignity and a winding, backhanded wit. 
</P>
<P>
The series rode off into the sunset in 1956 after 176 largely nonviolent 
episodes, and it took destiny about another 30 years to bring the Kindles and 
Carrillo back together again. 
</P>
<P>
When Kindle and husband Alan retired to Carlsbad five years ago, they peered 
from their home's upstairs window toward El Camino Real and Palomar Airport 
Road and wondered about the cleft of land amid the area's burgeoning 
subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
They learned the property was the 10-acre remainder of Carrillo's 
once-sprawling Rancho of the Spanish Daggers, where the famous Broadway stage 
actor, Hollywood star and proud descendant of a pioneer family entertained 
Gable, Lombard and countless others, and kept the past alive. 
</P>
<P>
Kindle wangled a tour of the rancho's hacienda complex, some of it looking worn 
and vaguely soon-to-tumble, and was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
Carrillo was gone, having died of stomach cancer at age 81 in 1961. But Kindle 
was driven by the recollection of a kindly actor who gave her children joy, and 
in time dedicated herself to the restoration of the authentic early California 
hacienda that Carrillo built in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
Kindle's interest, which infected her husband, led them to visit other places 
where Carrillo had lived, devour books and articles about him and conduct 
research in newspaper morgues, public libraries, and through historical 
societies. 
</P>
<P>
"Leo wanted that place as a memorial to his family, but it never happened," 
said Kindle. "The man is dead and his dream put in a closet." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not quite. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-acre site now belongs to Carlsbad, donated under the city's parkland 
dedication requirement by developers who in recent years bought much of the 
surrounding rancho to build new homes. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the city won a $490,000 state preservation grant, but it will take 
more like $2 million to restore the adobe, tile-roof hacienda and turn it, 
along with the surrounding land, into a public park, which is exactly what the 
city and Kindle have in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Kindle's academic fascination with Carrillo grew into a new-found cause when 
she learned that a proposed nearby road extension would have cut across the 
grave of Conquistador, Carrillo's palomino. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing her protests, the city agreed to change the road realignment, and, 
"from that point on, I began to sit in on (Carlsbad) Historical Preservation 
Commission meetings." 
</P>
<P>
Her zeal for Carrillo and the rancho eventually got her named the city's 
volunteer curator of the Carrillo Ranch Archives, but she's not alone in her 
love for the place Carrillo designed by pacing off yards and pronouncing where 
he wanted rooms built. 
</P>
<P>
After the city took control of the land, Keith Beverly became the resident 
caretaker, spending six years living in Carrillo's home and wandering the 
quiet, remote grounds, among the old cantina, the carriage house and other 
places once noisily alive with animals and throngs of Carrillo's guests. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the experience of a lifetime. I wouldn't trade it for anything," said 
Beverly, now a senior management analyst for the city and involved in planning 
the rancho's future as a park. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1992, the city plans to begin turning the 10-acre property into a 
park and hopes to buy another 5 to 8 acres to enlarge it. 
</P>
<P>
But, for the time being, "we have no strict development plans for the ranch," 
said Beverly, and the hacienda's seclusion and minimal access have kept it a 
virtual secret from much of San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
It's not completely forgotten, as workers early next year will begin 
reinforcing the old structures to make them earthquake safe, an eight-month 
project expected to cost $360,000. 
</P>
<P>
It will take a lot of time, money and effort to preserve something built by a 
man whom most people under 40 never heard of, a man who, if anything, is rather 
remembered is an oafish footnote to entertainment history -- sort of a Latino 
flip side of Gracie Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there was far more to Carrillo than that. 
</P>
<P>
And, as for his beloved rancho, although it was built in this century, it is 
considered a finely-constructed reminder of the young California developed by 
Carrillo's ancestors, who belonged to an original Spanish land-grant family. 
</P>
<P>
His great-great-grandfather, Jose Raimundo Carrillo, rode from Baja to San 
Diego in 1769 with Father Junipero Serra. Pio Pico, the last Mexican governor 
of California, was another relative. 
</P>
<P>
"He was creating his own heritage," said San Diego architect Wayne Donaldson, 
who is overseeing the project to strengthen the hacienda complex. "He was 
trying to impose the essence and warmth of early California living." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Los Angeles in 1880, Carrillo's perambulations led him to become a 
cartoonist for the San Francisco Examiner, where he would cover events, then 
recount them for the newsroom in uproarious Chinese, Italian or other dialects. 
</P>
<P>
He was a well-known stage actor in New York and a vaudeville veteran before 
comfortably settling into the glamour age of Hollywood, being featured in 100 
films, including Viva Villa and Phantom of the Opera. 
</P>
<P>
Carrillo's most endearing and enduring role was sidekick Pancho in "The Cisco 
Kid" series, a character he was chosen to play at age 75. The Cisco Kid first 
appeared in literature as a murderous Anglo in a short story by O. Henry. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood perpetuated the Cisco Kid in various movie incarnations, but what 
finally evolved was a gun-loving Latino cavorting about the Old West. The 
Pancho role was played as a stereotypically slow and dim-bulb character, an 
offensive interpretation that drew diplomatic protests from Latin American 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Renaldo and Carrillo brought their Cisco and Pancho to television, 
the duo portrayed Latinos who were poised and amiably committed to thinking 
their way out of trouble and using humor as a foil. 
</P>
<P>
Renaldo and Carrillo often appeared publicly before children, and Carrillo 
furthered his celebrity by riding in Rose Bowl parades and speaking always of 
California's proud Spanish history.

<P>
His refuge from the world was in Carlsbad, where he bought 1,700 acres in 1937, 
then added 3,000 acres to constitute his Ranch of the Spanish Daggers. Carrillo 
also had a little spread in Santa Monica, but Carlsbad was a working rancho, 
with hundreds of cattle and horses. 
</P>
<P>
The buildings included the "Deedie House" where Carrillo's wife, Edith, could 
steal away to work alone on her pottery and painting. 
</P>
<P>
Waxing eloquent in his autobiography, "Now, here on the Rancho of the Spanish 
Daggers, the past, the present and the future flash their many-prismed mirrors 
before my eyes. The ever-lasting hills are my proscenium. The vaulted sky is my 
roof. The stars lean down to pronounce their benediction." 
</P>
<P>
Very poetic, but the hacienda also was one helluva party house, where 
Carrillo's friends, including Renaldo, enjoyed legendary barbecues, music and 
demonstrations of Carrillo's horsemanship. 
</P>
<P>
But all that ended with Carrillo's death, and his only child, an adopted 
daughter, Antoinette, eventually sold the rancho by the piece before she died 
in 1978 at age 60. 
</P>
<P>
Now, there remains just the 10 acres, the hacienda complex and the 
determination not to let them crumble away. 
</P>
<P>
Kindle and others will see to that. 
</P>
<P>
As a transplanted New Yorker, Kindle still gets emotional about visiting the 
ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a religious experience. There is a feeling there. He left so much of 
himself and old California history. For someone from outside California -- you 
just don't realize." Her most challenging task as curator of the Carrillo 
archives is to relocate the furnishings, possessions and memorabilia that 
vanished largely through the family's estate sales. 
</P>
<P>
She put the word out and has received hundreds of phone calls, including one 
from a struggling artist who had come into possession of many original 
photographs of Carrillo and the rancho. 
</P>
<P>
Kindle is asking for help to obtain more Carrillo artifacts, hoping for 
donations to the nonprofit Carrillo Ranch Trust Fund. The items would establish 
a park museum, and Kindle also envisions showings of Carrillo's movies. She has 
contacted studios and other owners of the movie rights, so far tentatively 
securing permission to use seven films. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Leo would be honored," she said.

San Diego County sheriff's deputies were searching late Sunday for a 9-year-old 
boy who became lost on Mt. Laguna during an afternoon outing with his parents, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ashworth, whose address was not available, apparently walked away from 
his parents during daylight hours Sunday. By 6 p.m., more than 70 deputies from 
the Sheriff's Department's search and rescue team were scouring the area south 
of the 6,000-foot summit. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said cold weather might be a factor in the child's survival. 
Temperatures were expected to dip into the 40s by Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"They say it's extremely cold on that mountain right now," said Sgt. Roy 
Stamper of the Sheriff's Department. "And it's going to get colder." 
</P>
<P>
The rescue team -- which included dog trackers, foot trackers and a search 
helicopter -- began its search at dusk and was expected to continue throughout 
the night. There was also a team of searchers from the U.S. Border Patrol whose 
members are trained to track from horseback. 
</P>
<P>
A command post was also established at the Meadow Information Center, at the 
19-mile marker on Sunrise Highway, where the boy's parents were holding vigil, 
Stamper said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not outfitted for any cold temperatures, so we're worried," he said. "And 
he doesn't have any specific skill for such an ordeal. He's probably walking 
around crying. He'll probably wander around until he gets exhausted and then 
sit down. That's how we find a lot of these lost kids." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities could not say how the boy became separated from his parents.

STUDY TIES CHOLESTEROL TO ANGER

Hostile teen-agers are likely to grow up to be adults who have high 
cholesterol, according to a study that finds new links between anger and heart 
trouble. For years, many experts assumed that hard-driving, impatient people 
with classic Type A personalities were at high risk of heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
But many of the researchers have grown skeptical of this theory, and some now 
believe that the truly lethal personality trait is hostility and anger. 
</P>
<P>
"People with high hostility at age 19 tend to have high cholesterol levels at 
40," Dr. Redford B. Williams of Duke University said last week at a Dallas 
meeting of the American Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' study was among several presented at the association's annual meeting 
to suggest that hostile people are more prone to heart trouble -- both because 
of the effects of adrenaline and other hormones on their bodies and their 
tendency to have unhealthful living habits.

<P>
The first cancer therapy using genetically altered living cells was approved 
last week, and doctors at the National Institutes of Health said the first 
patient should start treatment within a few weeks. Steven A. Rosenberg said his 
team has been poised to start the revolutionary gene therapy in patients 
critically ill with advanced melanoma, a deadly skin cancer, and was only 
awaiting the final approval from the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The still-experimental therapy amplifies the body's own cancer-fighting 
ability. It uses natural cancer-fighting cells, called tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes, that have been removed from a patient's tumor and given extra 
genes that should enhance their ability to attack the tumor. The technique has 
been shown to be effective in laboratory animals. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this fall, other NIH researchers were granted permission to use gene 
therapy to treat children with an inborn defect in their immune systems that 
renders them highly susceptible to infections. Those studies are already under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg's team was given permission to treat up to 50 melanoma patients using 
the new gene technique.

JUNGLE COMPUTER PROBES MAYAN RUINS; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHEOLOGY: DESIGN SOFTWARE AND LASER MAPPING CAN CHART A SITE MORE ACCURATELY 
AND QUICKLY THAN TRADITIONAL METHODS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY BAER, Baer is a free-lance science and technology writer based in New 
York City. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Mayan culture remains an enigma. The remnants of roughly a thousand 
communities have been identified, but in most cases not much is known about 
them. Credit that to their locations -- often in the heart of some of the 
world's most forbidding jungles -- and to the fact that Mayan history has not 
been as well documented as that of the ancient Mediterranean civilizations. 
</P>
<P>
What is left of this vast legacy is disappearing rapidly. Even those remains 
that survive the elements may not survive the looters or the needs of modern 
civilization. Today, Mayan statues might wind up in somebody's villa, while 
building stones are recycled in modern schools or highway roadbeds. 
</P>
<P>
Modern archeology has barely kept pace with the rate of deterioration. Even if 
funding were infinite, there are not enough Mayan scholars to go around, says 
archeologist and Mayan specialist Nicholas Hellmuth of Rollins College in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
And even when a ruin gets the right attention, the process of mapping it often 
falls short. But that is changing now that Hellmuth has introduced the personal 
computer into the heart of the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
Using computer-aided design (CAD) and highly precise laser mapping techniques 
to chart the ruin site, the researcher has produced animated displays of the 
ruins as they are -- and once were, at the height of their splendor 17 
centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional methods involve a lot of elbow grease and subjectivity. First, a 
compass was used to determine a structure's orientation; measuring ropes or 
tapes established its dimensions, and an artist's sketch provided the visual 
rendering. Later, surveying techniques commonly associated with building or 
highway construction added a degree of geometric accuracy, but they still fell 
short. "These methods make a lot of assumptions, such as that the lines are 
always straight and that everything is always squared off," said St. Louis 
architect Daniel Hellmuth, Nicholas Hellmuth's brother. 
</P>
<P>
Photogrammetry, a process using stereoscopic cameras, enabled archeologists to 
visually reconstruct a site stone by stone (such a process is being used to 
help reconstruct the Great Sphinx). 
</P>
<P>
But photogrammetry is costly and time-consuming, requiring that the pictures be 
assembled back at the lab to derive the building's geometric coordinates. By 
the time a site is mapped, a hurricane could have washed most of the remains 
away. 
</P>
<P>
To gain a critical edge in the race against time, Nicholas Hellmuth tried yet 
another tack: Backpack a personal computer into the heart of the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
But computers can be delicate. Traditionally, large mainframe systems serving 
businesses were housed in cooled control rooms. When the PC came along, it 
became possible to operate units at room temperature -- as long as there was a 
room in which to situate one. 
</P>
<P>
There were plenty of rooms at the Mayan site -- a 44-room palace at Santa Rosa 
Xtampak, an ancient regional capital in the heart of the Yucatan. But the 
temperature inside was hardly what is thought of as room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
"We had climate control from Mother Nature," said Hellmuth, noting that 
temperature and humidity percentage both typically ranged in the high 90s 
during the course of the project, which, as luck had it, was done during the 
height of the rainy season. "People swore the computer wouldn't work, that 
fungus would grow on the floppy disks, and that the power surges (from the 
portable generator) would blow the computer." 
</P>
<P>
But the computer lived to tell the story -- one with a few unlikely plot 
twists. "None of the walls were perpendicular. Not one of them went up in a 
straight line for more than a few inches," said team member Daniel Hellmuth, 
who plotted the data on some of the palace's rooms, vaults and stairwells on 
the PC using AutoCAD, a popular CAD program. "The Mayans weren't sloppy," said 
Nicholas Hellmuth. "They were interested in monumental ideas, and the fact that 
the walls weren't straight wasn't very important to them. 
</P>
<P>
"These people were incredible engineers," he added, noting that many of the 
palaces they constructed dwarf anything built in southern Mexico or Guatemala 
since. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinary surveying may not have caught all these irregularities, while 
photogrammetry -- which was also used at Xtampak to validate the CAD data -- 
would not have revealed them until several months later. Furthermore, it is 
difficult to take a stereoscopic photo inside a closed space and get it 
properly correlated. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, a team from the Technical University of Graz, Austria, is analyzing 
the photogrammetric data of the palace exterior, while Hellmuth's team is 
assembling CAD data to produce three-dimensional, shaded visualizations of the 
winding internal staircases. The ultimate goal of the project, says Hellmuth, 
is to train local archeologists to use inexpensive tools like CAD to document 
their heritage before it disappears. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of a CAD system on site also provided more immediate advantages. 
CAD's precision, said Daniel Hellmuth, quickly revealed gaps in the data. 
Furthermore, added Nicholas, the computer running the CAD program could also be 
used to write the field report while the work was still under way, making it 
more accurate and complete. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time that CAD has been used in archeology, but typically 
it had been run back in the lab to tabulate field data. "I wouldn't be 
surprised if CAD will be used in the field a lot more in the future," said 
University of Chicago Egyptologist Mark Lehner. "But I don't know of anyone 
taking it out there now." 
</P>
<P>
Besides filing more accurate and complete reports, perhaps the most significant 
advantage of using CAD may be in visualization. Animated displays can depict 
eerily accurate walk-through views of the ruins. 
</P>
<P>
The animations are not just bells and whistles, insists Hellmuth. They could be 
used to let people walk through the ruins on a computer screen in a museum, 
rather than trampling all over the site. They could also become critical in the 
increasingly competitive quest to solicit financial support from foundations. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, such visualizations may soon become necessary now that the United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization is frowning on site 
restorations that, in the past, proved merely cosmetic. Under the new 
international guidelines, archeologists will be allowed only to shore up 
existing ruins, not rebuild them. 
</P>
<P>
CAD may help in those consolidations, said Atlanta-based consulting engineer 
James O'Kon, adviser on the project. CAD data could be fed into structural 
analysis programs that can help project workers decide how to reinforce 
existing ruins. 
</P>
<P>
With all its advantages, noted the University of Chicago's Lehner, CAD still 
lacks the fine detail of photogrammetry. (Lehner is using photogrammetry as 
part of the Sphinx restoration project.) "If you want a detailed map on how the 
stones are placed, you will need photogrammetry," he said. Such detail, 
responded Hellmuth, is overkill when mapping individual sites cluttered with 
vegetation, such as Xtampak, or ancient cities involving large numbers of 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
But in the future, it might not be an either-or question. Hellmuth predicts 
that CAD and photogrammetric technologies could merge within five years, thanks 
to more powerful personal computers. With such a system, technicians would take 
digitized stereoscopic pictures, rather than photographs, on the spot, readily 
feeding them to a computer. 
</P>
<P>
The Xtampak expedition, conducted in mid-1989, was a joint undertaking of the 
Foundation for Latin American Anthropological Research, a publicly funded 
nonprofit organization founded by Hellmuth, and the Universidad Autonoma de 
Campeche in the southern Yucatan peninsula, where the ruins are located, under 
the leadership of Prof. William Folan of Campeche.

A 20-YEAR UPHILL BATTLE TO SAVE THE MOUNTAINS; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA SUSANAS: A GROUP TOASTS THE PROGRESS IT HAS MADE TOWARD SETTING ASIDE 
OPEN SPACE FOR A PARK THAT WOULD STRETCH TO THE OCEAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most of the 100 million years since the Santa Susana Mountains were pushed 
up out of the ocean, the craggy hills needed little from man. 
</P>
<P>
But 20 years ago, Chatsworth resident Janice Hinkston decided that the hills 
around her home were in danger of being bulldozed into housing tracts, so she 
and some friends formed the Santa Susana Mountain Park Assn. Their dream: to 
protect the mountains from encroaching development and to create a wildlife 
corridor that would stretch from the Santa Clarita Valley to the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
This great Santa Susana Park is still just a dream, but about 75 people turned 
up Sunday to celebrate the association's accomplishments over two decades -- 
which include setting aside 600 acres of parkland and lobbying successfully for 
initiatives to protect open space. 
</P>
<P>
"We are desperate to take care of them," Hinkston said of the mountains, where 
she leads members of the public on monthly hikes. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, when Hinkston and her group set out to create an uninterrupted 
corridor of wild land from the Santa Clarita Woodlands near Magic Mountain to 
the ocean, people laughed. It was an impossible task, Hinkston was told. Why 
not settle for something less ambitious? 
</P>
<P>
Hinkston would not. And still will not. 
</P>
<P>
It may take another 20 years to realize her dream, but Hinkston -- a retired 
kindergarten and first-grade teacher whose car license plate reads SUSANA -- is 
not discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it would take a while," she said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 20 years, the association has finagled a variety of public agencies 
into purchasing hundreds of acres at the mountains' rugged base in Chatsworth. 
None of the land belongs to the association. Instead, members introduce 
legislators and parks officials to the land, explain their cause and let others 
do the actual buying. 
</P>
<P>
"We expose the potential of this land to different government agencies," said 
Zelma Van, former president of the association. 
</P>
<P>
Members lobbied heavily in 1988 in favor of Proposition 70, a statewide parks 
bond initiative to raise $776 million for acquisition and restoration of 
parkland, some of which is expected to be used to purchase land in the Santa 
Susana Mountains. They also lobbied this year on behalf of Proposition 117, 
which banned sport hunting of mountain lions in California. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, the association persuaded the federal government to place the Santa 
Susana Stage Coach Trail on the National Register of Historic Places. The 
trail, which winds through Santa Susana Pass south of the Simi Valley Freeway, 
was the main commercial overland route between Los Angeles and San Francisco 
from 1861 to 1874. The 400-mile trip took about three days. 
</P>
<P>
The stagecoach trail, lengths of which are still visible, followed the Indian 
foot trails and paths used by people making their way between missions in San 
Fernando and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the ultimate goal of connecting the Santa Clarita Valley and the 
ocean with uninterrupted open space, the association wants the Legislature to 
declare land already set aside as a state park. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Hinkston and her group said they will work to clean up areas 
in the mountains scarred by graffiti and illegal dumping, as well as defend 
them against development.

DOMINIC J. SANCHINI, RETIRED ROCKWELL OFFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dominic J. (Dom) Sanchini, a retired Rockwell Corp. vice president who helped 
develop the main engines for the space shuttle orbiters, died Saturday at his 
home in Thousand Oaks after a long battle with cancer. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchini, who was the second-ranking executive at Rockwell's Canoga Park-based 
Rocketdyne division until 1986, headed Rockwell's effort to obtain the 
government contract to build the shuttle orbiters' main engines, a company 
spokesman said. The main engines are attached to the rear of the orbiters to 
help guide the craft in space, and are separate from the booster rockets that 
launch the shuttle into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchini retired in August as vice president-major programs at Rockwell's El 
Segundo headquarters. He had been employed by Rockwell for 37 years.

BUSH SALUTES KOHL IN CAMPAIGN BOOST FOR GERMAN LEADER; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T QUARREL WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S CALL FOR SEEKING 
A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION IN GULF.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush on Sunday returned briefly to the campaign trail -- 
international style. En route to the Paris summit, he stopped here briefly to 
praise Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who faces a key election in two weeks, as "the 
man who united Germany." 
</P>
<P>
And Bush, who has ordered a dramatic escalation of the U.S. military commitment 
in the Persian Gulf as a signal of resolve against Iraq's Saddam Hussein, did 
not quarrel with Kohl's reassertion of the need to pursue all possible 
diplomatic options. The two leaders are "on the same wavelength," the President 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's appearance, a 5 1/2-hour visit after an overnight stop in Prague, was 
carefully designed by German officials to showcase Kohl as a world leader. 
White House aides had wanted Bush to visit Berlin during his current European 
tour, but Kohl's aides insisted on a visit to this, his hometown, U.S. 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who is almost certain to win reelection in the Dec. 2 voting, has been 
making a point of demonstrating that, as the leader of the newly united 
Germany, he is sufficiently important that major world figures are willing to 
travel to this somewhat off-the-beaten-track town to talk with him at his home. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, for example, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev made the visit. 
And the Soviet leader's visit followed a script quite similar to that of Bush, 
right down to the organ music -- Bach's Tocata and Fugue in D Minor -- that 
both men heard when visiting the 11th-Century cathedral in the city of Speyer, 
not far from here. 
</P>
<P>
The main difference between the two visits was security. While Gorbachev walked 
the streets of Speyer with relatively little protection, Bush's visit was the 
subject of unusually tight precautions, as was also true in Bush's visit to 
Prague. 
</P>
<P>
The precautions were not without reason. Since April, German political figures 
have been the targets of three assassination attempts, the latest of which left 
Kohl's interior minister partially paralyzed. An earlier incident left Kohl's 
chief political opponent, Social Democrat Oskar Lafontaine, near death after a 
mentally disturbed woman slashed his throat at a political rally. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, U.S. officials have been wary of increased terrorist threats 
because of the confrontation with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the security, a large and friendly crowd of several thousand greeted 
Bush at Speyer, where the President praised Kohl as a "great chancellor" and 
thanked him for his support of U.S.-led efforts against Iraq. Germany has 
pledged roughly $2 billion to help pay the costs of the anti-Iraq effort but 
has declined to send troops, citing limits on overseas troop movements put into 
its constitution after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
With rain threatening to soak his audience in the town square -- and Kohl 
gesturing agitatedly for an aide to give Bush an umbrella -- the President 
tossed aside most of his speech, including a passage that would have called on 
Germany to "take responsibility for leadership in our commonwealth of nations." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, for his part, praised Bush and the United States, saying that German 
unity "would not have been possible, indeed, would have been inconceivable, 
without the help and support we received from Americans." 
</P>
<P>
After visiting the medieval cathedral, the two leaders went to Kohl's home for 
lunch in this drowsy suburb on the banks of the Rhine. 
</P>
<P>
Curious neighbors peeked through their lace curtains at the press stampede down 
their modest street, while police kept a few dozen spectators behind barricades 
at the top of the block. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl joked about the nasty weather, noting that it did not reflect the climate 
of relations between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
"In Germany, unfortunately, November means rain," the chancellor said as the 
two emerged after nearly three hours of talks inside Kohl's gray and white 
house. 
</P>
<P>
While there, Kohl treated Bush to some of his regional German luncheon 
favorites -- stuffed sow belly, warm blood sausage and liver dumplings. 
</P>
<P>
Asked repeatedly by German and American reporters whether the Bushes ate the 
stuffed sow belly -- a particular favorite of Kohl's -- the chancellor's 
spokesman, Hans Klein said, "Yes, and it wasn't the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you a little secret," he confided. "Sometimes, Chancellor Kohl sends 
President Bush packages of sausage from this region, and these often contain 
saumagen." 
</P>
<P>
He said he didn't know what treats Bush sends Kohl in return. 
</P>
<P>
After the repast, the leaders discussed the Persian Gulf crisis, current 
international trade talks and aid for the Soviet Union, according to Klein and 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. Bush, afterward, called the meeting 
"terrific," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
"They discussed joint help for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe this coming 
winter, when the situation is acute," Klein said. "They agreed we must be ready 
to support reforms in the Soviet Union with food and consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
"Chancellor Kohl said that Germany cannot solve problems of these dimensions 
alone," Klein added. Germany already has sent millions of marks worth of food 
and aid to the Soviet Union and has pledged to spend 1 billion marks ($700 
million) over the next four years to help build housing for the estimated 
300,000 Soviet troops returning home from duty in what used to be East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Bush generally agreed on the need to help the Soviets but had no 
specific new aid proposals in mind. 
</P>
<P>
On the Persian Gulf, Klein and Fitzwater each said separately that Bush did not 
ask for more German involvement in the gulf and that he is well aware of Kohl's 
support for constitutional changes that would clearly permit Germany to deploy 
troops outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization theater. 
</P>
<P>
In a radio speech shortly before Bush's arrival, Kohl called for caution in 
considering using military force against Iraq. "Anyone who believes that this 
can be solved militarily must think of the end, not the beginning" and "what 
the consequences may be," Kohl said. Bush read excerpts of Kohl's speech before 
meeting with the chancellor and had "no problem" with it, Fitzwater said. 
"We're on the same wavelength," he added. 
</P>
<P>
On the trade talks, Fitzwater quoted Bush as saying the two men made "progress" 
but offered no specifics. In keeping with their desire to help Kohl 
politically, U.S. officials said that Bush planned to avoid pressing Kohl to 
make any public statement on trade until after the December elections.

GORBACHEV'S DEAL: A SHARE OF POWER FOR REPUBLICS, A STRONGER HAND FOR HIMSELF

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is offering his country a new political 
deal, a broadening of local government rights in exchange for an increase in 
his powers. Most here will doubtless ask: Will this put meat in the shops? Will 
it end the turmoil in the Caucasus? 
</P>
<P>
"People are tired and expect radical measures," one member of the Supreme 
Soviet (legislature) said last weekend. "They have no faith in the president, 
the prime minister, the Supreme Soviet." Give them dependable supplies of bread 
and medicine, she said, and again there will be trust. 
</P>
<P>
By eliminating the post of chairman of the Council of Ministers, or Soviet 
prime minister, and taking direct command of the state bureaucracy, Gorbachev 
seeks to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
At one stroke, he would become the day-to-day chief of the ministries that 
millions of his countrymen accuse of thwarting reform and also gracefully 
dispose of an ally, Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who is now a political 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's proposals for the overhaul of the executive branch, sketched in his 
brief speech to the national legislature Saturday, raise many questions, but 
perhaps the most fundamental is what the reaction of populist Boris N. Yeltsin 
will be. 
</P>
<P>
If Yeltsin, the president of the Russian Federation and the most respected 
politician in the country, were to declare his opposition to the plan, its 
success would be inconceivable. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Yeltsin associates such as Vladimir K. Varov, chairman of the Russian 
legislature's panel on political reform, seemed to reject Gorbachev's ideas as 
an infringement on Russia's sovereignty. But on Sunday, the Tass news agency 
said that Deputy Prime Minister Grigory Yavlinsky had concluded that 
Gorbachev's proposals and Yeltsin's appeal for a national coalition government 
"are not incompatible." 
</P>
<P>
Everything now depends on "how people will implement the president's ideas, 
what course of action they will take and what mechanism they will use," the 
Russian government official told Tass, sounding as though the only remaining 
dispute with Gorbachev could be over means and tactics. 
</P>
<P>
However, the exact opinion of Yeltsin himself remained unknown. He pointedly 
stayed away from the Kremlin the morning that Gorbachev spoke, and he flew to 
the Ukraine on Sunday to sign a treaty establishing "fundamentals of relations" 
with that republic, another manifestation of the fracturing of Soviet political 
power. 
</P>
<P>
However, comparing Gorbachev's plan and the emergency measures Yeltsin had 
recommended to the national legislature on Friday showed apparent points of 
convergence. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin asked for a vote of no-confidence in Ryzhkov and his ouster; Gorbachev 
wants the 61-year-old prime minister's job eliminated, although the longtime 
Gorbachev ally from the Urals could conceivably wind up with some other post. 
</P>
<P>
* Yeltsin seeks an "anti-crisis committee," with representatives from all 15 
Soviet republics, to lead the country out of crisis; Gorbachev called for 
upgrading the Federation Council, on which Yeltsin and leaders of the other 
republics serve, to make it the supreme organ of government. 
</P>
<P>
* Finally, Yeltsin called for a government of "national unity" in which other 
parties and factions could share power with Communists; Gorbachev told the 
Supreme Soviet that he wants to infuse the Kremlin leadership with "new, 
enterprising people with a modern mentality." 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, Gorbachev's proposals are the core of the new union treaty he is 
advocating to replace the 1922 agreement that created the Union of Soviet 
Socialist Republics, and which soon became a cover for dictatorial Communist 
Party rule from Moscow. The text of the proposed new treaty should be published 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
In brief, the Soviet president is offering local elites a stake in a revamped 
Kremlin power structure by granting the leaders of the republics, sitting with 
him on the Federation Council, the right of review over "everything touching 
the interests of the entire country." 
</P>
<P>
That sounded alluring, but Soviet officials later made it clear that Gorbachev 
would have the final say, even if the leaders of the 15 republics dissented. 
What's more, a totally separate body, the National Security Council, will take 
charge of defense, security matters and foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
To have no direct say in those key elements of statehood would be unacceptable 
for republics such as Latvia and Georgia, which aspire to complete 
independence, and perhaps for Yeltsin's Russia as well, although he has spoken 
in favor of a new union treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov, Gorbachev's prime minister since nearly the beginning of the social 
and economic reforms now collectively known as perestroika, has become the 
bugbear of progressives and radicals. They blame him for torpedoing their 
efforts to dismantle the "command system" of state economic management and 
create the basis for free enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, many conservatives have come to see in him a weak and ineffective 
technocrat. On Saturday, speakers from the left and right joined in the Supreme 
Soviet to call for a stronger hand. The president should be given such powers, 
Grigory Podberezsky of Byelorussia told Gorbachev, "so that people not only 
obey you, but also fear you." 
</P>
<P>
A deeper question is how great an effect even Gorbachev can have on the 
nation's economic and social life if Soviet legislators grant his wish and 
create the institutions he wants. 
</P>
<P>
If Gorbachev, already the general secretary of the Communist Party and Soviet 
president, has been unable to arrest economic decline and force obedience of 
laws and his decrees with the already impressive powers and institutions at his 
command, there is a question how much an institutional reshuffle can 
accomplish.

SECURITY CONFERENCE HAS SOME INTERESTING ANTECEDENTS; 
</P>

HISTORY: THE CONGRESS OF VIENNA, TREATY OF VERSAILLES, THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS 
ALL HAD A HAND IN SHAPING EUROPE. NOW, THE CSCE PROMISES TO LEAD IT IN A NEW 
DIRECTION.

<P>
The 34-nation summit meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE) in Paris is designed to mark the end of the Cold War and to chart 
a new future for Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Its broad sweep has evoked images of other major international conferences that 
shaped the Europe of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Notable among these was the Congress of Vienna, which redrew the map of Europe 
in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars. That assembly, which met in the 
Austrian capital in 1814-15, agreed to boundaries that lasted more than 40 
years and had even more far-reaching significance. 
</P>
<P>
The congress condemned the slave trade, recommended extension of rights granted 
to Jews and formally established a system of international diplomacy. But in 
reorganizing Europe, it also strengthened Prussia at the expense of France. And 
Prussia, later buoyed by the victorious war against France in 1870, became the 
dominant Continental power. That, in turn, led indirectly to World War I. 
</P>
<P>
The end of that great war resulted in another historic meeting on Europe's 
future, the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, dominated by President Woodrow 
Wilson, French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau and his British counterpart, 
David Lloyd George. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty was signed outside Paris at Versailles, and the severity of its 
peace terms -- loss of territory, acceptance of "war guilt," crippling monetary 
reparations and other humiliations -- shocked and embittered a defeated 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The Treaty of Versailles included a Covenant of the League of Nations, under 
which members guaranteed each other's territorial integrity. But the U.S. 
Senate refused to ratify the treaty and the United States never became a member 
of the League of Nations, which proved to be ineffective in preventing or 
reversing aggression. 
</P>
<P>
As postwar tensions mounted in Europe, a series of international conferences 
were held in 1925 in Locarno, Switzerland, and produced treaties confirming 
existing agreements. The process was viewed as a resounding success until the 
rise of Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
The late 1920s euphoria was enhanced by the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact (named for 
Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg and French Foreign Minister Aristide 
Briand), which was signed in Paris by 15 powers, with an additional 56 nations 
adhering to the principles later. It formally renounced war as an instrument of 
national policy. 
</P>
<P>
In 1932-34, 60 nations met in Geneva under the auspices of the League of 
Nations in a major disarmament conference, which failed, partly because of 
Hitler, who came to power in January, 1933. Germany withdrew from the 
conference in October, 1933. 
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of World War II led to several major conferences, perhaps the most 
important of which was the 1944 Dumbarton Oaks Conference near Washington to 
discuss the proposed United Nations organization. The results of the 
negotiations were forwarded to a 50-nation conference in San Francisco in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
There, the U.N. Charter was drafted. It was later ratified at the first meeting 
of the U.N. General Assembly in London on Oct. 24, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Potsdam Conference in July-August, 1945, the last of the wartime 
meetings, was held outside Berlin to discuss Allied control of Germany and 
postwar borders. During the conference, British Prime Minister Winston 
Churchill was defeated in a national election and replaced by the Labor Party's 
Clement Attlee. 
</P>
<P>
In 1948, faced with the threat of possible Soviet aggression, five European 
nations signed the Treaty of Brussels in the Belgian capital. That served as 
the template for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which was completed in 
Washington in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
(The term "summit conference" was coined by Churchill in 1950 when he called 
for a "parley at the summit" with East-West leaders.) 
</P>
<P>
In 1957, the Treaty of Rome signed by representatives of six European nations 
established the European Economic Community, otherwise known as the Common 
Market, which was eventually to abolish internal barriers between the 
countries. The EC, as it is now called, has grown to 12 members. 
</P>
<P>
The first CSCE meetings began in 1972. Thirty-three European nations plus the 
United States and Canada attended. (The total dropped by one when East and West 
Germany merged in October.) The negotiations, lasting three years, resulted in 
broad agreements on European security, human rights and economic issues that 
were codified in a document called the Final Act, signed in Helsinki, Finland, 
in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
This provided for conferences to monitor implementation of the agreements which 
were held in Belgrade, in 1977; Madrid in 1980; and since 1986 in Vienna, where 
most of the new set of agreements scheduled to be signed at the Paris summit 
were hammered out in prolonged negotiating sessions.

OMAN PLANNING DEMOCRATIC STEP, WILL FORM CONSULTATIVE ASSEMBLY

<TEXT>
<P>
The ruler of Oman, a key state in the international alliance against Iraq, took 
a major step toward political reform Sunday by announcing plans for a 
consultative assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Sultan Kaboos ibn Said, who made the announcement in a speech marking the 20th 
anniversary of his reign, said the assembly will be formed within a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have decided upon the formation of a consultative assembly in which all the 
counties of the sultanate are to be represented," he said. The country has 42 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
The only other popular assembly among the rich Persian Gulf Arab states 
disappeared in Kuwait under the tracks of Iraq's invading tanks on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Omani officials said the means of choosing members of the assembly had not yet 
been decided. 
</P>
<P>
One official said it would be an elected legislature, unlike the existing State 
Consultative Council, which has 52 appointed members from the central 
government, the counties and the private sector. But others said it was not yet 
clear if assembly members would be elected or appointed. 
</P>
<P>
The assembly would "provide more opportunities for Omani citizens' wider 
participation in the responsibilities and tasks in the construction of the 
fatherland," the sultan said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials and Western diplomatic analysts said the establishment of the 
assembly would be a significant step for Oman, a member of the Gulf Cooperation 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Oman is currently the head of the council, which also includes Bahrain, Qatar, 
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jon Petter Oie, a pudgy Norwegian businessman and rolling stone, seemed certain 
why he had come to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
"This situation is very dangerous," he told a reporter over the weekend on the 
grounds of Iraq's newly opened World Peace and Friendship Camp. "It demands 
action. This could be the start of World War III. This is a good opportunity to 
speak for peace. 
</P>
<P>
"When will your article appear so I can get a copy?" 
</P>
<P>
It takes all kinds to form a peace movement, and Oie is a beginner. 
Nevertheless, the Iraqi government has taken him in, along with a rotating 
group of 20 to 30 other foreigners who want to spread the message of a peaceful 
solution to the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Their presence here is hailed by Iraqi officials as proof of international 
support for President Saddam Hussein's policies, even though most of the 
activists say they are not taking sides in the gulf confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
They know why they are in Baghdad -- to testify for peace -- but they are not 
quite sure how they ended up in the World Peace and Friendship Camp. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we would be staying at a hotel," said Prof. Stanislav Korolev of the 
Moscow Spiritual Academy, an Orientalist who came as an adviser to a group of 
Soviet writers. "They just picked us up at the airport and brought us here. But 
we can't change the rules. We are completely in their care." 
</P>
<P>
The camp was established last week on a small island in the Tigris River on the 
outskirts of the capital. Speakers at the opening ceremony included former U.S. 
Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign dignitaries coming to Baghdad in the name of peace -- and for the 
release of their hostage countrymen -- are invited to pay a call. 
</P>
<P>
The activists -- from Europe, Latin American and Asia -- are housed in cottages 
of the Al Aaras Tourist Center, which Baghdadis call Honeymoon Island, a garden 
spot frequented by young Iraqi couples. Food and lodging are free for the 
foreigners, but phone calls home are paid for in dollars, and the activists 
pick up their own air fares in and out of Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, the residents included Oie, a Swedish transport worker, a group 
of Italians and the Soviets. Most expected to stay only a week. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, their program included a visit to a Soviet-built garment factory 
where hundreds of Iraqi women were busy turning out men's suits and military 
uniforms, pausing only to give the visitors a few rounds of boisterous 
pro-Hussein chants. On other days, they will receive lectures by Iraqi and 
foreign academics and tour farms, schools and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
How in this schedule, with nightly entertainment at the camp or downtown 
theaters, will they spread the message of peace? 
</P>
<P>
Ulf Ansell, a 47-year-old Stockholm transport worker, jobless since he was laid 
off at the first of the year, sees a range of possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"I can make statements," he explained, grasping the nut of P.R. for peace. 
"I've written many times to Swedish peace organizations." 
</P>
<P>
But Ansell also envisions a more dramatic course. "The idea is filling the 
battlefield with peace workers before a war breaks out. That is my aim. 
</P>
<P>
"If more people follow my idea, it can be effective. Perhaps 5,000 would be 
enough. That is my purpose." 
</P>
<P>
How 5,000 civilian activists would impose themselves at the front, presumably 
in Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, is one of the details that will have to be worked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Nesi Manlia, a 36-year-old activist from Livorno, Italy, sees his participation 
in personal terms. "I have a job, a car, a house," he explained, "but it is too 
easy to stay in Italy and say you are against the war. Here I risk my life. 
It's important to me." 
</P>
<P>
Oie, the Norwegian neophyte at peace campaigns, prefers the obvious path for 
spreading the message. "By talking to reporters like you," said Oie, 31, who 
runs an import business in the Norwegian port city of Stavanger. 
</P>
<P>
He said he works about half the year and travels the rest. "I've lived in the 
United States, in Texas, Hawaii and Alaska. I drove a taxi in Alaska. Put in 
your article that I say hello to the people in Alaska. Tell them I'm in Baghdad 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"In January I was in Berlin, picking at the wall. I've been eight times to 
Poland, and to Mexico and Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider myself as a citizen of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Oie, as did many others in the camp, said he was here to support the Iraqi 
people, not the Hussein government. Despite Norway's support of the United 
Nations-mandated force in the gulf -- "We have only one ship, and we sent it," 
he observed -- Oie said he did not want to be "used as an aggressor" to favor 
one side or the other. "I wasn't told there was a camp," he explained. "I was 
just going to Baghdad on my own to see the situation." 
</P>
<P>
He is not residing in what could be called neutral territory, however. The 
streets of the camp are lined with posters of Hussein and propaganda posters. 
"Man Is More Precious Than Petrol," says one. "United States of America: Enemy 
of Humanity," proclaims another. 
</P>
<P>
Antonella Straface, a 28-year-old doctoral candidate in Islamic philosophy at 
the University of Naples, said she came to Baghdad to try to visit two friends 
who are among the Italian hostages and wound up at the camp. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi officials seem very interested in this place," she pointed out. And 
she's interested in what is happening in Iraq. "I came to see with my own 
eyes," she told a reporter. "I had some impressions from reading the newspapers 
in Italy, and I wanted to test them out. 
</P>
<P>
"I condemn the precedent in this situation, the Israelis in Palestine and the 
Syrians in Lebanon. I also condemn the invasion of Kuwait.'

A former state senator who now is assistant budget director of Philadelphia 
Traffic Court owes $1,967 in traffic fines and says he has no intention of 
paying. 
</P>
<P>
"Why . . . should I pay," T. Milton Street told the Philadelphia Inquirer, 
using an expletive to emphasize his resolve. "My rights have been violated. 
They violate people's rights (at Traffic Court) every day." 
</P>
<P>
Street contended the court violated drivers' rights by requiring them to post 
collateral in the amount of their fines before an appeal hearing.

The oldest living person celebrated her 116th birthday on Sunday with hundreds 
of well-wishers, smiling and eating several slices of cake. 
</P>
<P>
Carrie White didn't seem to notice the greetings sent by Gov.-elect Lawton 
Chiles, or the recorded phone call from former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Once the six-tiered cake was cut, she perked up. 
</P>
<P>
"She's wide awake now," Paul Allen, owner and administrator of Putnam Memorial 
Nursing Home, said as hundreds of well-wishers gathered around to watch her 
enjoy the cake. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan called about an hour before the festivities began on the lawn of the 
nursing home. His remarks were recorded and played back later for the guest of 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want you to know there will be a prayer for you in my heart while I'm 
in church," Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
White was born in Gadsden County, Fla., on Nov. 18, 1874. Ulysses S. Grant was 
President. 
</P>

The Guinness Book of Records identifies her as the oldest living person whose 
date of birth can be reliably authenticated.

Two crewmen from a factory trawler were in federal custody after a shipboard 
riot over unpaid wages. 
</P>
<P>
The skipper and the chief engineer of the 205-foot Arctic Hero barricaded 
themselves inside the wheelhouse and engine room after about seven of the 45 
crew members rampaged through the vessel Friday, authorities said. The men were 
being held on federal charges in Unalaska, adjacent to Dutch Harbor in the 
Aleutian Islands. Damage to the Seattle-based ship, which catches and processes 
fish, was estimated at $25,000.

Women who do not show the anger they feel could be making a deadly mistake, a 
researcher believes. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of 372 women found that those who habitually suppressed high levels of 
anger were three times more likely to die than those who did not, Mara Julius 
of the University of Michigan School of Public Health reported. Women studied 
ranged between 30 and 69 in 1971. Julius tracked their mortality rates through 
1989. To determine the levels of their anger and how they showed it, Julius 
asked the study participants to describe how angry they would feel if their 
spouses yelled at them for something they did not do or if a policeman did the 
same thing.

RADIOACTIVE WASTE AT SEA CONFIRMED

<P>
Scientists have confirmed that corroded and collapsed drums of radioactive 
waste litter at least 30 miles of ocean floor in the Gulf of the Farallones 
National Marine Sanctuary. The U.S. Geological Survey team mapping the 
sanctuary also has detected what may be the remains of the USS Independence, an 
aircraft carrier used as a target in the 1946 Bikini Atoll atomic bomb tests in 
the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists caution that it is too early to confirm its identity. The 
Independence was sunk Jan. 26, 1951, because it was considered too expensive 
and difficult to decontaminate. The barrels filled with plutonium and other 
dangerous nuclear material were disposed of under the Atomic Energy Commission 
contracts between 1946 and 1970 at the Farallon Islands Radioactive Waste Dump, 
located four to 15 miles southwest of the islands.

PIPE BOMB HIDDEN IN STEREO EXPLODES

A pipe bomb hidden in a borrowed stereo blew up when the stereo was plugged in 
at a motel and an apparently unrelated bomb exploded on a store roof, police 
said. "It's kind of unusual to have them so close together," said Sgt. Bob 
Ensley, but he doubted that the explosions were at all connected. 
</P>
<P>
The booby-trapped stereo went off when Kathy Dastrup plugged it in at her motel 
room. Dastrup, 32, suffered only minor injuries because she was bending near a 
table at the time, said Ensley. An acquaintance, Herman Nathaniel Belkins, 21, 
who had borrowed the stereo, was sitting on a couch 12 feet away and was 
uninjured. Ensley said he did not know who loaned Belkins the equipment. About 
90 minutes earlier, a pipe bomb exploded on the roof of a K mart store. Police 
released no additional information on the store blast, and K mart officials 
were not available.

VANISHING SPECIES; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: EAGLES, FALCONS, HAWKS AND OTHER BIRDS OF PREY ARE IN DANGER AS 
HUMANS ENCROACH ON THEIR HABITAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The graceful hawks that circle Ventura County skies will all but disappear 
early next century unless drastic steps are taken soon, wildlife experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Hawks and other birds of prey -- such as eagles, falcons, owls and vultures -- 
were once plentiful in the county's treetops, river bottoms, grassy flats and 
rolling hills. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they share the same fate as other wildlife that competes with man for open 
space. Their numbers diminish each year as creeks are channeled between 
concrete embankments or fields and hillsides are landscaped with buildings and 
lawns. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the red-tailed hawks that nest in the upper reaches of eucalyptus 
trees are still common sights in the county. But, like their fellow raptors, 
the red tails have dwindled from thousands in the last century to several 
hundred today, said James Wiley, research biologist with the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service office in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"These are sleek and beautiful and fairly intelligent birds," Wiley said. "And 
their populations will all continue to decline." 
</P>
<P>
Swainson's hawks still migrate through the county, but they can no longer find 
adequate nesting grounds here, biologists say. The golden eagle and the bald 
eagle are down to several pairs now living in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The great California condor, the largest of the hawklike birds with an 8- to 
10-foot wingspan, has fared worse still. There were once hundreds or thousands 
of them in Northern Ventura County and the Pacific Northwest. They are now 
extinct in the wild. Forty birds, 13 of them born in captivity, survive at the 
San Diego Zoo and the Los Angeles County Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
"Those birds will not be here again," said Wiley, who heads a project to bring 
the population back from extinction. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the state nor the federal government has an active program to protect 
raptors, other than the giant condor, the Peregrine falcon and the bald eagle. 
Fish and Wildlife's condor program evolved only after the bird was declared 
endangered. And at that point, it's often too late to save the species, said 
Pete Bloom, a biologist with the Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology in 
Orange County, who has studied raptor populations in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't protect the endangered species, let alone all the raptors that are 
not yet on an endangered species list," Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Jurek, a wildlife biologist with the state Department of Fish and Game, 
said the state had a large raptor conservation program during the 1970s to 
study and monitor populations. 
</P>
<P>
"But since then, the numbers of endangered species have overwhelmed the people 
we have in the program to deal with them," Jurek said. Of the 39 species of 
hawks, falcons, vultures and owls found in California, 22 are listed as 
endangered, threatened or species of concern, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of those, the condor, bald eagle, golden eagle, Swainson's hawk, Ferruginous 
hawk, Peregrine falcon and burrowing owl live in or migrate through Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The population declines can be blamed primarily on the disappearance of the 
birds' habitat, Wiley and other scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural fields, though not as perfect a feeding ground as natural 
savannas, provide insects and rodents for birds of prey. But those fields are 
disappearing as the county continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
The birds also suffer from amateur hunters, poachers or children with guns, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, the county Animal Regulation Department takes in 30 or 40 raptors 
that have been shot, said Jane Gorden, a county Animal Regulation clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Other birds of prey are hit by cars or poisoned when they feed on rodents that 
have eaten pesticides, Gorden said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they just come down to the ground from exhaustion or hunger," Gorden 
said. "Some are just not able to find food." 
</P>
<P>
There is still some illegal trade in raptors for their feathers or for pets, 
officials said. But the birds inevitably fall ill from improper handling or 
feeding in captivity, said Ventura veterinarian Ron Dalzell, who donated his 
time to care for the county's injured birds for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year, we had babies stolen from their nests, brought in by people who 
said they found them," Dalzell said. Tree trimmers also dump birds from their 
nests every spring. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Dalzell stopped being a volunteer rehabilitator for the county 
and Jerry Thompson of Simi Valley took over some of his duties. Thompson has 
set up a network of three veterinary clinics to take care of the medical needs 
of the birds. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the raptors, besides the pleasure they give to bird watchers, provide 
an important source of rodent control for agricultural interests and city 
dwellers, Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a finely tuned ecosystem out there, and raptors are an essential part of 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the habitat survives for birds of prey and the land-dwelling 
creatures on which they feed, developers should be required to donate open 
space before they can build, the biologists said. Parks and open spaces should 
be linked by wildlife corridors of undisturbed land or riverbed. But Bloom 
doubts that will happen. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Holmes, director of government affairs for the Building Industry Assn., 
said wildlife is already protected by the California Environmental Quality Act. 
That law requires an environmental impact report on any potential harm to 
wildlife by development. 
</P>
<P>
"By law, we are required to look at the impacts any development will have on a 
species," Holmes said. He added that developers already give away more land 
than they are required to. 
</P>
<P>
He referred to the Ahmanson Ranch project in eastern Ventura County, where 
developers want to build 3,000 houses and 3 million square feet of office and 
commercial space. The developer, Ahmanson Land, has offered 3,000 acres of land 
to the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
"This is far and away above the amount we are required to set aside by law," 
Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of the deal, including Save Open Space and County 
Supervisor-elect Maria VanderKolk, say Ahmanson had to offer the land to 
receive any consideration for a project that creates new development outside 
Ventura County city boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"We have got to set aside more open space for wildlife," she said. "That has 
got to be the way of the future, because Ventura County is running out of land 
very quickly."

CAL LUTHERAN DISCONTINUING INTERIM SESSION; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGES: THE DECISION TO KILL THE ONE-MONTH TERM HAS MET WITH MIXED REACTIONS 
FROM STUDENTS AND FACULTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Undergraduate students at California Lutheran University traditionally spend 
January retracing St. Paul's footsteps in the Mediterranean, dabbling in 
improvisational theater, or perhaps working as interns in local schools or 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
But all that's ending at the 3,000-student campus in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
This is the last year that the private, liberal arts university is offering an 
interim session. The 20-year tradition is dying not only at Cal Lutheran but 
throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
The one-month sessions between the fall and spring semesters were required at 
least three of a student's four undergraduate years. The decision to kill the 
interim session has met with mixed reactions from students and faculty. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Ponto, a premed junior from Camarillo, said he enjoyed interim classes in 
personal financial management and film noir and is looking forward to taking 
Japanese in January. 
</P>
<P>
"They were something different from the regular courses," Ponto said. "The 
whole goal of interim is to do something other than your major." 
</P>
<P>
But other students and some professors questioned the scholarly value of the 
interim session, and many faculty members complained that they had no time to 
prepare adequately for their spring semester classes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think interim had been abused," said Michael Arndt, drama professor and 
chairman of Cal Lutheran's faculty. 
</P>
<P>
"Students found ways of getting by without doing much work, and some classes 
were not the same quality" as courses offered during the regular semester, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to eliminate the interim session stemmed from an accreditation 
study conducted two years ago by the Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges, 
which recommended that the university "take definite steps to reduce faculty 
workloads." 
</P>
<P>
"By dropping interim, we were able to meet this goal," said Hoda Mahmoudi, 
associate dean for institutional planning and director of interim. 
</P>
<P>
Professors currently teach nine courses a year -- four each in the fall and 
spring semesters and one in the interim -- and also are expected to do research 
and scholarly work. 
</P>
<P>
Mahmoudi said the university surveyed the faculty members and held hearings to 
get student opinions. Most professors favored the elimination of interim, and 
student opinions varied, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some students thought it was a wonderful experience," Mahmoudi said. "But we 
also had a number of students who said the course was too easy, or 'I'm an 
adult and I'm working and it's difficult.' " 
</P>
<P>
Started in 1970 as a move away from the quarter system and toward the system of 
other liberal arts colleges throughout the nation, the interim session offers 
dozens of classes in all major disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
In January, for instance, students can pick from more than 70 courses, some of 
which are tailored to this year's theme, "The Earth as Teacher." 
</P>
<P>
The classes, all pass-fail, range from traditional art, humanities and science 
topics to unconventional offerings such as "Crossword Construction for Profit 
and Fun," "Cinematic Jesus" and "Some Fun Things to Do with Math: Games of 
Chance, Fractals, Secret Codes." 
</P>
<P>
Also offered are trips such as "In the Footsteps of Paul: Greece &amp; Turkey," 
"Earthscape," a study of Northern European architecture, and "Tour with the 
Arts," a performance-study excursion for the university choir. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, students have the option of doing independent study projects, 
getting credit for internships, or studying -- at no extra cost, except travel 
expenses -- at one of 25 exchange colleges and universities throughout the 
nation that offer the interim session. 
</P>
<P>
Mahmoudi said the interim has offered a good opportunity for professors to 
experiment with courses -- some of which later become part of the regular 
curriculum -- and to try different teaching styles. 
</P>
<P>
But the system's advantages were outweighed by the workload, she said, and a 
traditional two-semester calendar was adopted for 1991-92. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to drop the interim classes at Cal Lutheran is apparently not 
unusual. In 1973, interim sessions were offered at 393 institutions of higher 
education throughout the nation. That had dropped to 250 by the 1989-90 
academic year, Mahmoudi said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the end of interim at Cal Lutheran, the travel trips may continue to be 
offered, though for only three weeks, and they may be limited, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Donaldo Urioste, a Spanish professor who has led interim excursions to Mexico, 
said he "loved to take students on these trips -- it's living language." But he 
said he also favored eliminating the interim "because the workload is 
tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
Karin Nussle, a senior majoring in athletic training and physical education, 
said she thought the travel courses had no educational benefit. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people feel interim is a waste of time," she said. "I used it to my 
advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most students who take courses outside their disciplines, Nussle took 
athletic training courses and this January will do an independent study with a 
ski patrol in her home state of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, senior Gunvor Hatling, a Norwegian student who has taken two 
interim trips to her home country to study marketing and advertising, said the 
travel sessions are particularly valuable for American college students. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great for them to see the rest of the world," she said. "It's not just 
California that's the world." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Cal Lutheran's biggest mourner of the interim's demise is Fred Tonsing, 
a professor of religion and Greek who is leading the "Paul's Footsteps" trip in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very sad about it for a number of reasons," Tonsing said. "It's been for 
me one of the most delightful class periods of the year because the students 
can concentrate on one class. And you have time for field trips." 
</P>
<P>
Tonsing, who in 17 years has taught courses on apocalypse and on daily life in 
the time of Jesus, said the interim schedule allowed all-day trips to such 
places as the J. Paul Getty Museum and Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
"The other thing that was delightful was it attracted students from throughout 
the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tonsing doesn't believe that eliminating interim really addresses the faculty's 
workload because it does not reduce the number of classes required to be taught 
each semester. And he disagrees with critics who contend that interim classes 
are not scholarly. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret that some professors didn't take it seriously," he said. "That 
attitude was communicated to the students, who then believed it. 
</P>
<P>
"To have fun in a class, to be intrigued by subject matter, to be excited about 
it, doesn't mean it's not scholarly."

COUNCIL MAY MOVE MOBILE HOME PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years after a consultant recommended that the city of Oxnard move an aging, 
crowded mobile home park, the City Council is scheduled Tuesday to decide 
whether to hire a firm to plan the move. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the proposal would allow the city to hire a firm to draft a plan 
to acquire land and develop finances for a 150-unit mobile home park, according 
to a city report. 
</P>
<P>
The firm would be asked to recommend a developer for the park. 
</P>
<P>
One of the three mobile home parks considered for transfer to the proposed site 
is the Oxnard Mobile Home Lodge in the 1300 block of Commercial Avenue, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the consulting firm of Sanchez Talarico recommended that the city 
develop a new park for the tenants at the Oxnard Mobile Home Lodge. The firm 
said the park was overcrowded and code violations posed a threat to the health 
and safety of the occupants. 
</P>
<P>
Residents, some of whom are living two families per mobile home, have 
complained to the City Council about the park's conditions on several 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
The most likely site for the new park would be on the east side of Olds Road, 
next to Ocean View Junior High School, according to the report. The land is 
within unincorporated county area, but within the city's sphere of influence. 
</P>
<P>
The recently approved General Plan for Oxnard designated the site for a mobile 
home park. HUGO MARTIN

WATER OFFICIALS TO DISCUSS FINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Public opinion will help determine whether the Casitas Municipal Water District 
decides to levy stiff fines on an Ojai water company for violating the 
district's moratorium on new hookups, Casitas officials said last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Water Co. faces fines of more than $500,000, which 
could mean higher water bills for its 2,688 Ojai customers, Casitas General 
Manager John Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
If Casitas does not fine the company, Johnson said, other district customers 
and resale agencies will clamor for equal treatment and expand their water use. 
</P>
<P>
"The result of all this will be a greater demand on the Casitas system, with a 
possible drying up of the lake should a long-term dry spell be encountered," 
Johnson said. The Lake Casitas reservoir provides water for about 55,000 
residents of western Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The Casitas board voted last week to ask officials in Ventura County and the 
city of Ventura for opinions on whether the fines should be imposed. Board 
members will meet today with Ojai officials and Southern California Water Co. 
executives in San Dimas to discuss the matter, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing will be scheduled in December for agricultural, residential 
and other commercial water users in the district to give their opinions, 
including those not directly served by Casitas. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Southern California Water Co. have said they are caught in the 
middle. When the company complied with Casitas' order to impose a moratorium on 
new or expanded service connections in April, it was criticized by the 
California Public Utilities Commission. The company lifted the moratorium Oct. 
26 and is waiting until it receives the commission's approval to impose one.

CAT'S EYE GOUGED IN ATTACK WITH SPRAY PAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura woman told police that someone sprayed her 10-year-old cat with 
fluorescent pink paint and gouged out an eye. 
</P>
<P>
Michele Marie Galvan, 20, called the Ventura Police Department to report the 
attack Saturday after she discovered the cat in the back yard of her house in 
the 3300 block of San Pablo Street, according to a report filed by Officer Rod 
Giles. 
</P>
<P>
Galvan said she became concerned when Burba, an outdoor cat that usually stays 
close to home, disappeared Thursday about 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
She found him Saturday morning covered with paint. His eye was severely 
damaged. Galvan took Burba to a veterinarian who removed the eye and washed off 
the paint. The cat is recuperating. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he'll ever want to leave the back yard, even to go out front, 
because what happened to him was pretty traumatic," Galvan said. 
</P>
<P>
Galvan said police told her that children in some neighborhoods have been using 
pellet guns to shoot paint capsules. CAROL WATSON

A CUTE, FUZZY LITTLE PROBLEM; 
</P>
<P>
SQUIRRELS: THE DEBATE RAGES AT COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS AFTER AN ORDER TO REDUCE 
THE CAMPUS'S POPULATION OF THE RODENTS, WHOSE FLEAS CAN TRANSMIT THE PLAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The squirrels seem harmless enough -- furry, little creatures, scurrying busily 
across the College of the Canyons campus in search of nuts or food left by 
their human friends. But look again. 
</P>
<P>
Squirrels may have cornered the market on cute, but they carry fleas that are 
potential carriers of plague, and Los Angeles County health officials have 
ordered the Valencia college to get rid of some of the creatures. That mandate 
has alarmed some COC students and animal rights activists, and left school 
officials reluctantly searching for the best method to carry it out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like killing animals any more than anyone else," said Cal Allsup, COC 
facilities director. "But I fully understand that there's a problem and the 
squirrels need to be suppressed." 
</P>
<P>
Although some students and animal rights activists are opposed to killing any 
squirrels, others are mostly concerned that it be done humanely. 
</P>
<P>
County agriculture officials recommended killing the squirrels using the 
chemicals Diazinon, diphacinone and aluminum phosphide. Diphacinone, an 
anti-coagulant, dilutes the squirrels' blood so that it seeps out, causing them 
to bleed to death. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the squirrels would probably return to their burrows to die but 
that the bodies of those found aboveground would be disposed of immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Some students and animal rights activists have proposed trapping the squirrels 
and putting them to sleep painlessly. Better yet, the squirrels would not have 
to be killed at all if they were sprayed with a chemical to eliminate the 
fleas, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Squirrels on the Valencia campus are as common as students, and their burrows 
dot the hillsides and fields. Some are so tame "they'll actually come up and 
take food out of people's hands," Allsup said. 
</P>
<P>
The order to reduce the campus's large squirrel population was issued after a 
routine inspection in September. 
</P>
<P>
"Ground squirrels and the fleas that they carry are important in the 
transmission of plague," said Franklin Hall, chief of the county Health 
Services Department's vector-borne disease control program. 
</P>
<P>
Squirrel eradication programs are common. "In recent years, there has been an 
increase of plague occurring in wild rodents throughout Los Angeles County," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The fleas that live on the squirrels can carry sylvatic plague, Hall said. When 
the squirrels come in contact with people or domestic animals, the insects can 
be transmitted. 
</P>
<P>
When contracted by people, the disease is known as bubonic plague, whose 
symptoms include inflamed lymph glands, fever and delirium. The disease can 
lead to death. 
</P>
<P>
Although no squirrels examined on campus have been found to have fleas carrying 
plague, the population still must be reduced as a precaution. "It's similar to 
inoculating children for measles," Hall said. "We're taking the measures to 
prevent something from occurring rather than waiting for it to occur." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the school's board of trustees allocated $5,000 for an eradication 
program but did not decide what method should be used. 
</P>
<P>
The plan proposed by the county agricultural commissioner has met with 
opposition from some student activists and others. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that we should look for and find the most humane and realistic method 
possible to take care of the problem," said Michael Daly, a student. "I think 
ideally we can find a solution where none of the squirrels have to be killed." 
</P>
<P>
Daly and others have posted Save the Squirrels banners around campus and held 
meetings to inform students and faculty members about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Community animal rights activist Kathleen Ungar said a suppression program was 
unnecessary. "As far as I'm concerned, people overreacted," she said. 
"Everyone's just guessing" that the squirrels might carry the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Daly has expressed concern that the chemicals suggested for use may also harm 
people or animals that eat the poisoned squirrels. 
</P>
<P>
Sentiment on campus ranges from apathy to adamant support. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the health department mandate, the squirrels kept groundskeepers 
busy. Workers constantly refill holes made on athletic fields by squirrels. 
Allsup said squirrels have even caused structural damage to buildings by 
burrowing underneath. 
</P>
<P>
"I say, 'Kill 'em,' " said Jim Blankenship, a natural resources major. "I'm an 
environmentalist and all that, but they're undermining the grounds." 
</P>
<P>
But other students disagree, just as adamantly. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they need to suppress them at all," said Shannon Stark, 19. "We 
took their area. We destroyed their home, basically, so where else are they 
going to live? They're just trying to survive." 
</P>
<P>
College of the Canyons is all too familiar with animal controversies. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, college officials attempted to rid the campus of swallows 
roosting on the ledges over the entrance to the campus's main building. 
</P>
<P>
Officials tried driving them off with gooey repellents, sonic beepers and 
high-powered water hoses. Nothing seemed to work and six of the birds, which 
are a protected species, were killed in the attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, however, the school seems to have learned to live with the birds 
and now even has a festival celebrating their annual return. 
</P>
<P>
"The student community and faculty at COC realize the value of having the 
swallows come home to their college, and now I would like to see the squirrels 
given the same respect," Ungar said. "If we can save the swallows, we can save 
the squirrels." 
</P>
<P>
Although the swallows and squirrels are a cause celebre on campus, officials 
have been killing gophers for years without causing an outcry from students or 
community animal rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
"People aren't concerned about the gophers because gophers are ugly things," 
Allsup said. "They look like rats."

WOLF DREAMS HOWL WITH FEARS FROM LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
DREAM OF THE WOLF, BY SCOTT BRADFIELD. ALFRED A. KNOPF. $18.95, 256 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Bradfield's 13 stories in "Dream of the Wolf" are strange, weird, 
bizarre, freaky and right on the money. 
</P>
<P>
In the title piece, a nice man named Larry works in Santa Monica in some hell 
pit called The Tower Tire &amp; Rubber Co., but lately he's been dreaming of 
wolves. 
</P>
<P>
As Larry tells his company counselor, "When I dream of the wolf, I am the wolf. 
I've been wolves in New York, Montana and Beirut. It's as if time and space, 
dream and reality, have just opened up, joined me with everything, everything 
real. I'm living the one life, understand? The life of the hunter and the prey, 
the dream and the world, the blood and the spirit. It's really spectacular, 
don't you think?" 
</P>
<P>
The counselor doesn't particularly think so. Soon Larry gets fired, his wife 
and daughter leave him, the frozen dinner cartons pile up, and the message of 
our own fragmented, messed-up world becomes clear: Stop dreaming of wolves! 
(And, for that matter, stop being part of the wolves' dreams.) 
</P>
<P>
Too many people right now are too taken up with all the other stuff: 
Restaurants and bills and weird jobs and shopping and hanging out. There's a 
terrible hopeless loneliness upon the land. 
</P>
<P>
Our place on Earth is so sad now that even the dogs feel bad. In "Dazzle," the 
eponymous dog is so overcome with melancholia that he goes off his feed. His 
distraught family hauls him off first to the vet and then to the dog 
psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
But Dazzle won't be comforted: "He just felt a sort of vague and indefinable 
anxiety, a certain fundamental sadness at the inconclusiveness of things. It 
was the way he felt when he saw a dead cat in the road. Dazzle hated cats, but 
when he saw them squashed and senseless in the spattered street he didn't hate 
them at all anymore. . . . Sometimes Dazzle just lay on his blanket for hours, 
contemplating the meaninglessness of dead cats." 
</P>
<P>
Dazzle eventually runs away, and from this new existential freedom finds 
Edwina, a decent sort who bears him many a litter in the mountains above the 
city whence they came. Dazzle learns to try to be content with the limitations 
of physical life as we know it: "I guess what I'm trying to say about all this 
nonsense is simply try to be happy with your life and don't worry too much 
about experiencing it. Let's all relax and enjoy ourselves a little." 
</P>
<P>
Dazzle -- with his dog's life falling halfway between mysterious wolf-wildness 
and the tearing loneliness of humans -- has got a pretty good handle on life. 
But the humans in these stories have lost their grip. 
</P>
<P>
In "Unmistakably the Finest," a girl gives her money to a lady evangelist in 
the mistaken assumption that the money she spends will come back vastly 
multiplied. 
</P>
<P>
In "Greetings From Earth" a woman married to a crazy man who spends all his 
time building things in the basement decides to attempt out-of-body 
experiences, while her physical shell eats Cheese Puffs all alone in front of 
her television set. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these stories don't work quite so beautifully. There's one where a kid 
squishes a mother termite and later explodes himself. 
</P>
<P>
But "The Darling," about a pretty serial killer who finally has to settle down 
(into the world of Cheese Puffs and frozen TV dinners) is terrific. There is 
only the one life, the author insists. When we veer away from it, we fragment 
and self-destruct.

RAMS FIND HOW LOW YOU CAN GO; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: COWBOYS CAPITALIZE ON DEFENSIVE SLIPS AND GARY'S FUMBLE FOR 24-21 
VICTORY.

<P>
Although the laws of mathematics may insist otherwise, the Rams Sunday stumbled 
into one of the axioms of late-season football logic: 
</P>
<P>
When you lose to the Dallas Cowboys to drop your record to 3-7, when your 
stumble out of the gate lasts 10 games and counting, when the fight to restore 
personal pride becomes your last best battle call, your season is gone. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers say the Rams still could make the playoffs, but the real proof is 
in the pounding. Just roll this around in your mouth: Those awe-inspiring 
Cowboys (4-7) are now in better shape to make a playoff run than the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody will write in here (that) the Rams give up, so I cannot say that," 
Ram Coach John Robinson said after his team's 24-21 loss to Dallas Sunday in 
front of 58,589 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) neither can I try to give you some scenario that sees us winning five of 
the last six and going 8-8." 
</P>
<P>
He is not alone, especially after a Dallas offense that had not scored a 
touchdown in the past two weeks made every play it had to and rolled up 359 
yards against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"The playoffs," said quarterback Jim Everett, "are out of the picture." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, who chugged into this season convinced they were a well-oiled, 
well-drilled, well-stocked Super Bowl contender, discover themselves after 10 
weeks only well-done. 
</P>
<P>
And Sunday afternoon they were forced to concede that their only lasting hope 
for 1990 is to regain at least a fraction of their former respect, if that is 
at all possible in this winter of discontent. 
</P>
<P>
"We may not make the playoffs, but we've got to play for pride from here on 
out," cornerback Jerry Gray said. "We can't let people come in here and just 
steamroll us. We can't let this year break us down." 
</P>
<P>
What's left are two games -- including next Sunday -- against the 10-0 San 
Francisco 49ers, a team so far ahead of the Rams now that it seems hard to 
believe. What's left is the role of spoiler, a fallback position for failed 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's game was a symbol of why the Rams find themselves peering up at the 
Cowboys and almost everybody else in football. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams did not play dismally, but were done in by a handful of game-turning 
plays that went Dallas' way. 
</P>
<P>
The pivotal moment came when tailback Cleveland Gary had the ball knocked loose 
and recovered by Cowboy linebacker Ken Norton at the Dallas five-yard line 
early in the fourth quarter. Three plays later, Troy Aikman dropped a short 
pass to tailback Emmitt Smith, who ran past three Ram defenders for a 44-yard 
gain to the Ram 27, setting up Ken Willis' game-deciding 23-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
When the Ram offense got the ball back, down by three points and with 4:05 
left, a Tony Tolbert sack of Everett on third down ended it. 
</P>
<P>
On the day when Gary (24 carries for 103 yards) was the Rams' main offensive 
weapon, Everett was only 14 of 25 for 139 yards, the fourth consecutive game he 
has struggled. 
</P>
<P>
"We should've dominated them, but we didn't do it," Gray said. "We're not a 
good team right now. We've got good personnel, but the chemistry just isn't 
there. Our record proves we're not a good team." 
</P>
<P>
Not being a good team on Sunday meant a defensive secondary that allowed Dallas 
pass plays of 61, 57, and 44 yards; it meant the fumble by Gary just as the 
Rams were about to break a fourth-quarter 21-21 tie; it meant an offense that 
got one last real chance to pull off a comeback and ended up losing five yards 
in three plays and punting the ball meekly away. 
</P>
<P>
It meant that right here and right now, the Rams are a worse team than the 
Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as low or as difficult a situation as any team that I've been involved 
with has been in," Robinson said. "I think we all know what's happened is 
nightmarish to us, very painful to us, and I cannot or I will not try to 
dissect and define it other than it seems to be teamwide, it seems to cover all 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot give you an explanation why. I think we're working hard. We just are 
playing games horribly." 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys and Aikman did their best to get the Rams off to a quick-strike 
start, throwing a pass straight into the arms of safety Vince Newsome on the 
game's third play. 
</P>
<P>
Newsome returned the pass 11 yards to the Cowboy 36, and five plays later, Gary 
squirted through a huge hole on the left side of the line for a 16-yard 
touchdown and a 7-0 Ram lead. 
</P>
<P>
But two possessions later the Cowboys, who had converted only one third-down 
attempt last week against the 49ers and were zero for their first three Sunday, 
converted three consecutive third-down tries, including a 10-yard touchdown lob 
to receiver Michael Irvin to even the score. 
</P>
<P>
On the scoring play, Ram cornerback Darryl Henley was with Irvin until the ball 
was thrown. At that moment, Henley slipped and tumbled face down to the turf, 
freeing Irvin for the easy catch. 
</P>
<P>
Quickly enough, the Rams churned out a 12-play, 98-yard, 7:25 drive concluding 
with the second of Gary's three touchdown runs, the kind of march the Rams had 
grown used to yielding, not taking, and it gave them a 14-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But the big-play defensive blunder soon hit the Rams hard again. 
</P>
<P>
This time it started with Smith catching a medium-range pass over the middle 
and breaking by several Rams for a 57-yard completion to the Ram 22. That was 
the Cowboys' longest pass play of the season. 
</P>
<P>
A late hit on Aikman pushed the ball to the seven-yard line. And only 1:58 
after the Rams' long drive, Aikman hit fullback Tommie Agee for a six-yard 
touchdown pass, knotting the score at 14. 
</P>
<P>
On the next Cowboy possession, Aikman simply lofted a deep throw to Irvin, 
streaking down the left side, and the Ram secondary did all the rest. Like 
Henley before him, Ram cornerback Bobby Humphery was reasonably close to Irvin 
until the ball dropped down, when Humphery, too, picked the wrong time to 
stumble to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
That left Irvin alone to haul in the pass and score a 61-yard touchdown -- the 
new longest Cowboy pass play of 1990 -- giving Dallas a 21-14 lead at the half. 
</P>
<P>
Gary opened the second half with a career-long 48-yard jaunt through the right 
side of the line to the Cowboy 24, and soon after jumped in from one yard out 
for a 21-21 score that set up the scenario that lost the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the coaches, it's not the mangement who's losing these games," tackle 
Jackie Slater said. "Every player has to look at himself. We're the ones who 
are losing them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ram receiver Henry Ellard re-aggravated his right hamstring during the first 
half and did not play in the second. Aaron Cox played in his place. . . . The 
Rams' two deactivations were offensive lineman Joe Milinichik and cornerback 
Clifford Hicks. . . . Brett Faryniarz replaced starting outside linebacker Mike 
Wilcher, who had been having headaches all week, but Wilcher did play.

STORRS, Conn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A cold New England wind rides through north central Connecticut, scattering 
yellow leaves and sending the unmistakable message that winter is close behind. 
</P>
<P>
Students on the University of Connecticut campus bundle up against the cold as 
they walk stiffly into the wind. Heads covered, hands shoved deep into pockets 
of bulky jackets, they make their way to class. 
</P>
<P>
Many pass the domed structure at one end of the campus, the Gampel Pavilion, 
known by students as the Conn Dome, where inside the Big East champion Husky 
basketball team is practicing and the temperature is rising fast. 
</P>
<P>
"Enjoy our win last night, Shawn?" Coach Jim Calhoun asked freshman forward 
Shawn Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," said Ellison, who did not play in the Huskies' one-point exhibition 
victory over the touring Soviet national team. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you enjoy your view?" Calhoun asked. "Keep playing like you are and it'll 
be permanent." 
</P>
<P>
Lyman DePriest, a 6-foot-5 senior forward, put up a shot and missed. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck," DePriest said. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, from now on, let's all yell 'Heck, heck, heck,' every time we miss instead 
of getting back on defense," Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
Three hours later, Calhoun blew his whistle and sat down heavily in a chair at 
one end of the court. Practice was over for the Huskies, but expectations are 
running rampant and Calhoun is trying his best to defuse as much as he can. 
</P>
<P>
It's not an easy job. The Big East coaches have made the Huskies, who were 21-6 
last year, the conference favorite, and news-service polls has UConn ranked No. 
13 and No. 17. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not the No. 13 team in the country and we aren't No. 17, either," said 
Calhoun, 48, in his 19th year of Division I college coaching. The 6-5 Calhoun 
is a golfer, fan of Woody Allen films and a marathon runner. 
</P>
<P>
Calhoun went on to list something else the Huskies aren't. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't the Rockefellers or the Cabot Lodges yet, the aristocrats of college 
basketball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But what about last year? 
</P>
<P>
"We say this to our players all the time: We want to build on last year. We 
can't live on last year." 
</P>
<P>
Around basketball crazy Connecticut, that may be in dispute. Picked near the 
bottom of the Big East, the Huskies not only finished first, but also won the 
conference tournament on their way to the No. 1 seeding in the East Regional of 
the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Who will ever forget the play that beat Clemson in the East semifinal at the 
Meadowlands? 
</P>
<P>
UConn trailed by a point with one second to play when Scott Burrell threw a 
90-foot inbounds pass to Tate George, who sank a turnaround jump shot as the 
game ended for a 71-70 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The play is known simply as "The Shot" among Husky faithful, who were equally 
stunned by the outcome of the East final when Duke scored on a last-second shot 
and beat Connecticut in overtime, 79-78, to end the dream season. 
</P>
<P>
Calhoun remains convinced that the Huskies could have won the NCAA title last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"I still believe to this day, although we didn't get a chance to prove it, 
there wasn't anyone in the country we couldn't beat," he said. "I just knew we 
were good enough to win the national championship." 
</P>
<P>
This year, they probably aren't, for two reasons: Nadev Henefeld and George. 
Henefeld, the team's best passer and defender, returned to his native Israel to 
sign a pro contract with Maccabi of Tel Aviv, and George was a first-round 
draft choice of the New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld's loss will be felt the most. A 6-7 forward who could play inside or 
outside, Henefeld made the Huskies' full-court pressure work. Calhoun said 
Henefeld's defection was a major blow. 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried to downplay it to the kids," Calhoun said. "I've told them it 
presents opportunities for some of them. People do a lot of things with 
opportunities. Sometimes they blow them, and other times they make the most of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Like last year? 
</P>
<P>
"We were special," Calhoun said. "We were locked onto the track. We were in a 
groove all the way. 
</P>
<P>
"This year's team is fun to coach, too," he said. "They're not as good, but 
it's fun." 
</P>
<P>
A sellout crowd at the Hartford Civic Center watched the Huskies take a 
19-point lead against the Soviet team, then saw them fall behind, 81-80, with 
three seconds to play. Calhoun called a timeout and drew an inbounds play, much 
like the one that beat Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell, who pitched for the Toronto Blue Jays' farm club last summer in the 
Class-A New York-Penn League, would throw the ball in. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell's pass was caught past midcourt by Murray Williams, who took three 
dribbles past two Soviet defenders expecting a jump shot and dropped in a layup 
as the game ended in an 82-81 Connecticut victory. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Soviet Coach Vladas Garastas was asked if he knew that Connecticut 
had done nearly the same thing in the last-second victory over Clemson. Vladas 
nodded and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, everybody know," Garastas said. 
</P>
<P>
The Clemson game is something Husky fans will never forget, even if Calhoun 
prefers that they try. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson's David Yates made a three-pointer for a 70-69 Tiger lead with 12 
seconds left. It was Yates' only basket of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies moved the ball upcourt quickly. George penetrated the middle, 
wanting to pass to Chris Smith or John Gwynn, but both were covered. So George 
took the shot himself, but missed an open 16-foot jumper with five seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost started crying," George said. "I think I realized my college career 
was coming to an end. After that miss, I wanted the ball back in my hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Well, it's been a dream season,' but I was upset that it was going 
to end like that." 
</P>
<P>
Clemson's Sean Tyson rebounded George's shot and was fouled by Burrell with 1.6 
seconds left. Tyson missed the free throw, Burrell rebounded and called time, 
almost in the same motion. The clock showed :01.0. 
</P>
<P>
"(Calhoun) kept yelling, 'It's not over! It's not over!' " Burrell said. "He 
picked our heads up and said, 'We're going to get a shot off.' I don't know if 
I believed him. I thought it was over, to tell you the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Calhoun drew the play. Burrell would throw the ball to one of the Huskies' big 
men past midcourt and he would turn and heave the ball in desperation. But in 
the huddle, George told Burrell that should pass all the way downcourt. 
</P>
<P>
That's what happened. Burrell fired a fastball over the outstretched hands of 
6-11 Clemsoncenter Elden Campbell. George caught the pass with his back to the 
basket, whirled as Tyson backed off and lofted the ball at the basket. It fell 
through. 
</P>
<P>
The play was called "home run," which is pretty close to what George hit. In 
the pandemonium afterward, George's mother cried in the stands, Clemson Coach 
Cliff Ellis stared in disbelief and George caught Big East Commissioner David 
Gavitt in a bear hug. 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Connecticut Gov. William O'Neill was moved to announce that George or 
possibly Calhoun ought to succeed him in the statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
"The Shot" was seen by rabid Husky fans as the natural progression of the 
season: a miracle shot by a miracle team. 
</P>
<P>
Calhoun does not ordinarily like the word miracle used in connection with last 
year's Husky team. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, miracle means something happened that wasn't based on fact or 
substance," he said. "But that shot, yeah, that was a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
However, miracles seem to get spread around a little bit. The 17-foot jump shot 
by Duke's Christian Laettner that beat Connecticut at the end of overtime might 
not qualify as a miracle, but it was close enough. Somehow, the Huskies had 
lost their chance to make the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it just wasn't meant to be. Moments before Laettner's winning shot, there 
was George picking off a pass by Bobby Hurley intended for Phil Henderson in 
front of the Duke bench, but fumbling it out of bounds and then sticking his 
hands in his mouth in horror. 
</P>
<P>
"When Laettner made it, it was like a curtain had closed," Calhoun said. "It 
was a sudden stop. I could still see Tate with the ball, coming to me. He was 
going to dribble right to me and we were going to dribble to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the play," he said. "I could feel the bench behind me, everybody was 
up. We had the ball stolen. And the game." 
</P>
<P>
But Huskymania remains. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters from 15 of the state's 20 daily newspapers covered the exhibition 
game with the Soviets, which was carried on the 15-station Husky radio network. 
</P>
<P>
The athletic department had to return $250,000 in season ticket requests for 
the 8,500-seat Gampel Pavilion after cutting off season ticket sales at 6,500. 
In the Hartford Civic Center, where the Huskies play eight games, season ticket 
sales have reached 13,100. Three years ago, season tickets in the Civic Center 
were not even half that. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut has mailed 100,000 full-color catalogues of Husky merchandise such 
as T-shirts, hats and sweat shirts, targeting its alumni base, season 
ticket-holders and boosters. Last year, sales of such merchandise netted more 
than $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies will play their first full season in the new Gampel Pavilion, which 
opened last January at a cost of $28 million -- $22 million from state bonds. 
And the team that plays there? Well, it considers itself new, too. 
</P>
<P>
"We're nothing like last year," Burrell said. "Last year is last year. It's 
over. Gone. It's not the same team. We want to find out what we're all about 
this year. We may not be as good as last year, but we don't ever want to dwell 
on what happened then because we can never get it back." 
</P>
<P>
Said Smith: "It's a feeling that probably won't ever happen again." 
</P>
<P>
A streak-shooting 6-2 junior guard from Bridgeport, Smith leads the team. 
Chosen the most valuable player in last season's Big East tournament, Smith 
spent the summer touring with the U.S. national team, played in the Goodwill 
Games and was a starting guard during the World Championships in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
He started all eight games in the World Championships and averaged 9.4 points 
and 1.9 assists as the U.S. won the bronze medal. Smith's backcourt partner 
this year is point guard Gilad Katz, a 22-year-old from Tel-Aviv, a member of 
the Israeli national team who has completed his military service. 
</P>
<P>
The other Huskies who will log most of the playing time are veterans: 6-9 1/2 
junior center Rod Sellers, Burrell, Williams, DePriest and John Gwynn coming 
off the bench. Toraino Walker, a 6-7, 226-pound sophomore, will be back as soon 
as he makes up incomplete class work. 
</P>
<P>
Even without George, it would have been a complete team if Henefeld were still 
around. Calhoun fully expected Henefeld to come back for a second and probably 
final season, but the Huskies' success combined with Henefeld's status as 
Israel's top player prevented that. 
</P>
<P>
"Nadev had become bigger than life in Israel and here," Calhoun said. "He had a 
feel for the game that you could only hope to coach. If we had him back, then 
the polls would have been right." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Huskies' average margin of victory was 15 points, best in the 
nation. This year, Calhoun figures his team is going to have to grind it out, 
hope for the best and forget about the past. 
</P>
<P>
Calhoun remains a big man in these parts. Last week, he was a guest conductor 
of the Hartford Symphony Orchestra. He began the "William Tell Overture" by 
blowing his coach's whistle. A drummer donned a Husky cap. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to put a Lone Ranger mask on, but, naw, what the heck," Calhoun 
said. 
</P>
<P>
University of Connecticut basketball fans share the feeling. Love those 
Huskies? Still replaying "The Shot?" Well, don't feel like the Lone Ranger.

GOLF: COUPLES' DRIVES SET THE TABLE FOR FLOYD AS TEAM SCORES FIVE-SHOT VICTORY 
OVER PALMER-JACOBSEN AT SHERWOOD COUNTRY CLUB. 
</P>

A golf partner of Yogi Berra tells of the day the Hall of Famer played in a 
scramble format tournament and was told on one hole that despite hitting by far 
the longest drive, the tee shot of another member had to be used instead, to 
abide by a tournament rule. 
</P>
<P>
"OK," a dejected Berra yelled while standing beside his ball, far up the 
fairway. "But if I was playing by myself, I'd use this one." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Floyd and Fred Couples didn't need Berra's tee shots Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd and Couples took a six-shot lead in alternate-shot play Saturday over the 
Sherwood Country Club Course and shot a 61 for a five-shot victory over Arnold 
Palmer and Peter Jacobsen Sunday in the $1-million Ronald McDonald Children's 
Charities tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd and Couples got a birdie on the first hole and an eagle on the second en 
route to a victory that was worth $125,000 to each. 
</P>
<P>
Their strategy was based on long drives by Couples and Floyd's precision short 
game, 
</P>
<P>
Example: Sunday, on the 341-yard first hole, Couples hit a drive that came to 
rest 10 yards in front of the green. Floyd then chipped to within a few feet 
and Couples sank the putt for an easy birdie. 
</P>
<P>
The team finished the unique tournament with a score of 34-under-par 182. 
Palmer and Jacobsen closed with a 60 and earned $70,000 each. The teams of Ben 
Crenshaw-Lanny Wadkins, defending champions Curtis Strange-Mark O'Meara and 
Mark Calcavecchia-Ian Baker-Finch tied for third place at 26-under-par and 
earned $44,500 each. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament host Greg Norman and partner Jack Nicklaus finished ninth in the 
10-team field. Quipped Norman: "I guess I need a new partner. Someone a bit 
younger and stronger." 
</P>
<P>
None were stronger that Couples. 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old who has won four PGA tournaments in his 10 years on the Tour, 
including the 1990 Los Angeles Open, spent three days hitting drives that made 
Floyd's task easy. Sunday, on the ninth hole, he drove the ball nearly 350 
yards down the middle of the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started with a birdie and an eagle today, I knew it was over," said 
Floyd, winner of the 1976 Masters, the 1986 U.S. Open and the PGA Championship 
in 1969 and 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"When a man is hitting a ball off the tee like Fred did this week, his partner 
doesn't have a very difficult job." 
</P>
<P>
Couples said that he might have picked up something during the three-day event 
that will be worth much more to him than the $125,000 check. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned so much from playing with this man," he said, nodding toward Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
"His intensity on the course, the intensity in his eyes, was something to see. 
He'd make a joke or two, but as soon as he turned to walk to his ball, the 
smile disappeared and he'd get that look in his eyes. I sometimes relax on a 
golf course, and when I do, I can't always focus on the game again. 
</P>
<P>
"Raymond does not have that problem, and maybe from now on, after this 
experience, I won't have it anymore, either." 
</P>
<P>
Couples indicated that maybe the change had already begun. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we had a big lead going in, and we didn't want to rub anyone's face in 
it," he said, "but we really wanted to win this thing by 10 strokes. That's 
what we decided before we teed off. I think we needed that to keep our 
intensity, to keep grinding away out there. We didn't want to let anyone back 
into the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
The event, held for the first time last year, was Norman's idea. The top career 
money winners and 1990 money winners were invited. In 1989 it raised more than 
$1 million for several charities, and Norman said he expected this year's event 
to surpass that total.

TENNIS: TEEN-AGER OUTLASTS SABATINI IN FIRST FIVE-SET WOMEN'S MATCH SINCE 1901.

<P>
The last important women's tennis match of the year lasted until almost, oh, 
the first of next year before Monica Seles ended the first five-set women's 
match since 1901 with one final blistering backhand into the corner that 
Gabriela Sabatini could not track down. 
</P>
<P>
Match time could have been kept by calendar instead of a clock, but after 3 
hours 47 minutes Sunday, Seles outlasted Sabatini, 6-4, 5-7, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, to 
win the Virginia Slims Championships, her second major title of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The winner's reaction? "It was so long out there," Seles said. 
</P>
<P>
But it took a while before Seles said so long to Sabatini. Seles, the 
16-year-old Yugoslav who lives in Florida and who won the French Open in June, 
came from a set down to take the fourth set on a critical double fault by 
Sabatini, then out-hammered her 20-year-old counterpart in a historic fifth 
set. 
</P>
<P>
The last five-set match in women's tennis was 89 years ago in the final of the 
U.S. Nationals when Elizabeth Moore defeated Myrtle McAteer, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5, 
2-6, 6-2. Five-set matches were abolished in 1902 and the format was not 
revived until the Virginia Slims Championships began in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
However, Seles said she did not feel tired after playing five sets. No, it was 
something else. 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting hungry," Seles said. "I didn't have my lunch." 
</P>
<P>
But if Seles missed her meal, she didn't miss her paycheck. Seles collected a 
check for $671,851, which includes $350,000 and the remainder from bonus pools. 
</P>
<P>
Seles won nine tournaments and $1.6 million in 1990, which probably means if 
she ever gets lost in Bloomingdale's again, as she did last week, at least she 
will have a nice way to spend the time looking for her parents. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini, who knocked off No. 1-ranked Steffi Graf in Saturday's semifinals, 
may have deserved a better outcome against Seles, but seemed strangely content 
to remain on the baseline and trade groundstrokes late in the match. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't much she could do about that, said Sabatini, who attacked the net 
consistently against Graf. 
</P>
<P>
"Today I play more from the baseline," Sabatini said. "Monica didn't give me 
many chances. It was the only way I could beat her." 
</P>
<P>
The key game in the match occurred in the fourth set when Sabatini served in 
the 10th game, down 4-5. But she double-faulted to 15-30 and double-faulted 
again at 30-40 to allow Seles to force a fifth set. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, it looked as if Seles' best chance already had come and gone. Seles 
led, 5-4, in the second set and seemed on the verge of taking a two-set lead, 
but won only one point as she served for the set. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini's touch volley winner broke Seles and evened the set at 5-5. Sabatini 
held for 6-5, then broke Seles again for one set all. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Seles said she was becoming a bit discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tried to forget what happened in the second set," Seles said. "I just 
kept telling myself 'You got to take chances, and then I just went for a lot 
more shots." 
</P>
<P>
It probably also helped that Sabatini made 15 of her 57 unforced errors in the 
fifth set. But even more vital to Seles' cause was how she attacked Sabatini's 
second serve. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini won only 22 points on 66 second serves. 
</P>
<P>
"The key was who might attack the serve more," Seles said. 
</P>
<P>
Sabatini, who picked up a total of $322,529 for the day for her runner-up 
finish as well from the bonus pool, ended the year with $973,062 in prize 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say what is happening inside," Sabatini said. "All I was caring 
about was the match, each point. I felt like I could play forever." 
</P>
<P>
They almost did.

<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe this was one game that should have ended in a tie. Neither UCLA nor USC 
deserved to lose. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I've seen the last 40 renewals of the cross-town rivalry and Saturday's was the 
best, minute-for-minute. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Overheard on the USC sidelines after Johnnie Morton caught the touchdown pass 
that put the Trojans ahead with 16 seconds remaining: "We scored too early." . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Thumbs up to Jim Sprenger, Dave McCullough, Jay Stricherz, Chuck McFerrin, 
Nardy Samuels, David Becker and Rich Freitas. They're the officials who let the 
players do their thing. Not one big play was called back. No holding penalties 
were called. No penalties of any kind were called in the second or third 
quarters. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Postgame snapshots: Two wide receivers who caught 15 passes between them, USC's 
Gary Wellman and UCLA's Scott Miller, shaking hands, exchanging compliments, 
and wishing each other good luck at midfield. . . . Larry Smith interrupting 
his news conference to hug and kiss wife Cheryl. . . . USC players wearing 
ear-to-ear smiles nearly as big as their tiny Rose Bowl dressing room. . . . 
Terry Donahue patiently answering questions in the interview room and then 
granting every request for a one-on-one interview. . . . Tommy Maddox doing the 
same. . . . 
</P>
<P>
All Maddox needs to become a high first-round draft pick is three more years -- 
well, maybe two. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Todd Marinovich conducts the coolest, most proficient game-winning touchdown 
drives this side of Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest play that won't be remembered was USC fullback Raoul Spears 
apparently being stopped and then spinning off a tackler for three yards and a 
first down on fourth and one on the UCLA 24 in the fourth quarter. On the next 
play, Marinovich threw the first of his two touchdown passes to Morton to put 
the Trojans ahead, 38-35. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It was also Spears, a second-stringer, who made Smith's gamble look good when 
he dived for two yards and a first down on fourth and one on the USC 39 early 
in the third quarter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Longest time between touchdowns in the fourth quarter was 6 minutes 39 seconds. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Only one field goal was attempted all day and Quin Rodriguez's three-pointer 
was the difference. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Another thing that made this game unusual -- neither coach was criticized. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Theme of Troy Week was "Another Trojan conquest. Ho hum." . . . 
</P>
<P>
The rematch next Nov. 23 in the Coliseum should be something. Of the 44 
starters Saturday, only 14 were seniors. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Won't those intellects in the California rooting section and Stanford band ever 
learn to stay off the field until the end of the game? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Most USC fans were disappointed that Notre Dame lost to Penn State. They wanted 
the Trojans to have an opportunity to knock off the top-rated team Saturday in 
the Coliseum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I doubt that there will be a quarterback controversy at USC this week. 
</P>
<P>
If the Orange Bowl had shown some patience, it could have had hometown Miami 
vs. Colorado with the national championship most likely at stake. Actually, 
Notre Dame still should be rated ahead of Miami. Notre Dame is 8-2, Miami 7-2, 
and the Irish beat the Hurricanes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Sugar Bowl looks real smart, too, for inviting Virginia, which lost to 
Maryland and probably won't have injured quarterback Shawn Moore in the lineup 
New Year's Day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Washington has UCLA to blame for not ending the regular season as No. 1. . . . 
</P>
<P>
An asterisk should be put beside the 11 touchdown passes thrown by David 
Klingler Saturday in the Astrodome. After all, Houston was playing Eastern 
Washington. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In coaching Cal State Long Beach to a 6-5 season, George Allen proved that he 
hasn't lost his winning touch. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This time, Boston College would have needed five Hail Mary passes to beat 
Miami. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Howard Schnellenberger, who is bringing Louisville to the Fiesta Bowl, may stay 
in Tempe, Ariz., to replace Larry Marmie as coach of Arizona State. . . . 
Nothing like the Rams' defense to bring out the best in Troy Aikman. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Pity Orange County, home of the Rams and Cal State Fullerton. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The well-balanced Buffalo Bills won't lose by 45 points if they play in the 
Super Bowl. . . . 
</P>
<P>
How about those streaking Indianapolis Colts. . . . 
</P>
<P>

PRO BASKETBALL: CLIPPERS BEAT SEATTLE SUPERSONICS, 78-65. KIMBLE BENCHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Clippers and Seattle SuperSonics played a game for the ages Sunday night at 
the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The Dark Ages. 
</P>
<P>
In a performance lowlighted with ineptitude, sprinkled with some defense and 
bottomed off with silliness, what will be best remembered from a night barely 
worth remembering is that the Clippers beat the SuperSonics, 78-65, in an 
honest-to-goodness four-quarter, 48-minute game before 10,980. So help us, 
Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably a situation where I wish we were still in warmups," said 
Seattle's Xavier (who hit three of 14 shots) McDaniel, a teammate of Sedale 
(four of 11) Threatt and Gary (five of 15) Payton. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel shouldn't complain. He got credit for two of his seven points when 
Clipper center Benoit Benjamin, unchallenged for the ball, tipped McDaniel's 
missed free throw into the basket. So much for the Seattle highlights. 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSonics, losers of four in a row after opening the season 3-0, shot 
32.1%, hitting on 27 of 84 attempts. By quarter, they scored 12, 21, 16 and 16 
points. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers countered with 25, 11, 25, 17, while shooting 39.7%. Good enough 
to win. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a slow-paced game," said Clipper Charles (six for 18) Smith. "(Sonic) 
Derrick (McKey) said to me on the court, 'What are you guys doing playing that 
Minnesota ball?' I said, 'You guys aren't really playing like Denver, either.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
But both sides did play like record-setters, or close to it. 
</P>
<P>
The combined 143 points ties the fourth-lowest mark in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
The 65 points are the fewest in the SuperSonics' 23-plus seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The 65 points also set the Clipper record for fewest points allowed and tied 
for the fifth-worst single-game showing in league history. 
</P>
<P>
The 65 points established a season high for Seattle Coach K.C. Jones for most 
times bewildered in one game. 
</P>
<P>
"No one had more than 28 minutes or thereabouts last night (when the 
SuperSonics played Chicago at home), so it's not a question of fatigue. We just 
couldn't hit the shots. We were missing layups, eight-footers, five-footers. 
Sedale couldn't hit the side of a barn. 
</P>
<P>
"Our two shooters were missing, Sedale and 'X,' so you say, 'Well, it's not 
happening,' and scratch back on defense. We made some layups and free throws, 
so then we went back into the same old thing -- 'Let's see what our outside 
shooting can do.' Nothing again." 
</P>
<P>
And again and again and again. 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSonics, playing without injured scoring star Dale Ellis, gave the 
Clipper defense some of the credit. The Clippers, playing without benched 
semi-scoring star Bo Kimble, accepted that as a reason for their second victory 
in three games. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to give ourselves credit on the defensive end," guard Winston Garland 
said. "That was the only way we were able to win the game, because our offense 
was just standing around. The defense saved us." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, 4-5 and with a very good chance to reach .500 with lowly New 
Jersey coming to the Sports Arena Wednesday, led, 25-12, after the first 
quarter. Then, shooting only 22.2% in the second period, they were up by only 
36-33 at the half. They had been outscored, 21-11, in the second quarter even 
though the SuperSonics hit only 42.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle went ahead, 37-36, on Threatt's layup 1:04 into the second half, but 
the offense, no doubt having over heated with two baskets in as many 
possessions, downshifted again. Some 6 1/2 minutes later, the Clippers led, 
55-45, and soon pushed that cushion to 61-47. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd started shouting for Kimble in the fourth quarter, but a presidential 
pardon wouldn't have gotten him into this game. The Clipper rookie, a starter 
in each of the previous eight outings, was shooting 39.1% and had more 
turnovers than assists in all but one of them, but this clearly wasn't about 
struggling on the court. Exactly what it was about, no one would say, but 
healthy bodies averaging 14.4 points and then sitting out an entire game seems 
something along the lines of a minor disciplinary matter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a team-related matter," Coach Mike Schuler said. 
</P>
<P>
Was Kimble being disciplined? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a team-related matter." 
</P>
<P>
But by not disclosing the reason a starter doesn't even play make it into a 
bigger deal? 
</P>
<P>
"It is not an issue, per se," he said. "I certainly hope there's not going to 
be more made out of this than there should be. . . . The Bo Kimble incident is 
over and done with." 
</P>
<P>
So will he be back in the opening lineup against the Nets? 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble followed the party line. 
</P>
<P>
"It's team related," he said. "We made an agreement to keep it among ourselves. 
There's nothing to panic about. Everything will be back to normal the next 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Garland opened in his place and played well, a seven-for-10 night making him 
the only starter for either team to shoot 50% or better. A bright spot in the 
darkness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
The fewest points the Clippers/Buffalo Braves have ever scored is 63, against 
Milwaukee on Oct. 21, 1972. . . . The SuperSonics scored 31 points in a half 
against the Clippers in 1972, so Seattle's 32 in the second half this time 
wasn't a record, either. . . . Ken Norman led all scorers with 22 points, 
though he made only seven of 25 shots. Benoit Benjamin added 16 points and 12 
rebounds for the Clippers and Charles Smith contributed 14 points and 12 
rebounds. Shawn Kemp led Seattle with 11 points, seven rebounds and three 
blocked shots in 20 minutes off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Despite scoring a basket for the other team, Benjamin wasn't alone in his 
embarassing moments. Coming out of a timeout late in the third quarter, 
referees mistakingly gave the ball to the SuperSonics. While the Clippers went 
to the other end to set up on offense, Seattle's Dana Barros scored an 
uncontested layup. Only then did officials realize the mistake, with a little 
help from a bothered Clipper bench, and disallow the basket.

PACKERS WIN IN LAST MINUTE, 24-21;

NFC: A ONE-YARD TOUCHDOWN PASS PLAY WITH 16 SECONDS LEFT LIFTS GREEN BAY OVER 
PHOENIX.

<P>
Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski goes by the nickname "Majik." 
</P>
<P>
And now, Packer backup quarterback Anthony Dilweg has adopted a similar 
moniker. 
</P>
<P>
"Just call me 'The Wizard,' " Dilweg said Sunday after he led the Packers to a 
24-21 victory over the Phoenix Cardinals. "This team has a lot of character. 
It's not just me. I just went out there and did my job." 
</P>
<P>
The Packers (5-5) trailed, 21-10, with 13:14 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But Dilweg, who entered the game after Majkowski strained his right shoulder 
nine minutes before halftime, pulled the Packers to within 21-17 on a 15-yard 
touchdown pass play to Clarence Weathers with 6:20 left. 
</P>
<P>
He then connected with Ed West on a one-yard touchdown pass play with 16 
seconds left to give the Packers the win. 
</P>
<P>
"The offense missed Don, but they rallied very, very well around Anthony," 
Packer Coach Lindy Infante said. "It was a great win. This gives us another 
little step to get us into the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix (2-8), which lost for the fifth consecutive time, gave the Packers the 
opportunity for victory by turning the ball over on downs at the Packers' 
43-yard line with 2:10 left. 
</P>
<P>
Dilweg, who completed 11 of 21 passes for 134 yards, connected on passes of 19 
and nine yards to Herman Fontenot and 16 yards to Weathers before a three-yard 
run by Herman Fontenot got the ball to the Phoenix one. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, Dilweg rolled right and found West in the back of the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a running play called, but there was 22 seconds left and we wouldn't 
have had enough time left if we got stopped, so we changed it to a passing 
play," Dilweg said. "We faked left, went right and I saw our tight end (West). 
He did a nice job to get open." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals tried to salvage a tie on Al Del Greco's 58-yard field-goal 
attempt on the game's final play, but the ball barely reached the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal quarterback Timm Rosenbach, completed 17 of 30 passes for a 
career-high 285 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix rookie Johnny Johnson, the NFC's leading rusher, gained 103 yards in 15 
carries despite straining his right ankle early in the game.

BUTLER'S KICK MAKES UP FOR BEAR OF A MISS; 
</P>
<P>
INTERCONFERENCE: AFTER BLOWING A FIELD-GOAL ATTEMPT AT THE END OF REGULATION, 
HIS 44-YARDER IN OVERTIME BEATS BRONCOS.

<TEXT>
<P>
To err is human. To forgive is possible for Chicago Bear Coach Mike Ditka, only 
if you redeem yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka, who had a tantrum on the sideline when Kevin Butler's field-goal attempt 
at the end of regulation bounced off the left upright, embraced his kicker 
after Sunday's 16-13 overtime victory over the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
Butler drilled a 44-yard field goal with 1:46 left in overtime to lift the 
Bears (9-1) to their sixth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The first one (from 41 yards) missed by inches," Ditka said. "He's entitled." 
</P>
<P>
The clincher was a low line-drive that managed to sail over the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible feeling to miss a kick like that, but fortunately it hasn't 
happened much to me in my career," Butler said. "It felt like I hit it good, 
but it just started to hook at the end. Actually, the one in overtime felt 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
Butler's winning kick was made possible by poor field position endured by 
Denver (3-7) on three possessions in overtime. Denver started drives at its 12, 
eight and four-yard lines. 
</P>
<P>
When the Broncos couldn't move out of the hole on their last series, Johnny 
Bailey returned the punt 20 yards to the Denver 34, and Butler converted four 
plays later. 
</P>
<P>
"Maury Buford did an outstanding job of punting," Ditka said. "We kept them 
pinned in there, and he gave us field position. As it turned out, the only 
difference in the game was field position." 
</P>
<P>
Denver Coach Dan Reeves agreed with Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like we were in a hole going into overtime," he said. "We were 
backed up constantly, and we couldn't make a play to get out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Another big difference in the game was the two turnovers. Chicago never turned 
the ball over, they never made a mistake. That's the kind of team they are. 
They're forcing you to beat them, and they're not helping you. This is the 
thing that has plagued us, the mistakes, but I was proud of the way we played." 
</P>
<P>
Denver got even, 13-13, with 1:14 left in regulation on John Elway's nine-yard 
run. 
</P>
<P>
A pair of field goals by David Treadwell gave Denver a 6-3 lead at the half. 
But the Bears converted two turnovers into 10 third-quarter points to take a 
13-6 advantage. It marked the ninth time in 10 games the Broncos have blown 
halftime leads this season. 
</P>
<P>
After Bobby Humphrey fumbled at the end of a 14-yard run on a vicious, head-on 
hit by Chicago safety Mark Carrier, Mike Singletary recovered at the Denver 
35-yard line. Butler's 32-yard field goal made it 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, Jim Morrissey made a diving interception of Elway's pass at 
the Denver 40. Seven plays later, Brad Muster ran 10 yards for a touchdown with 
14 seconds left in the quarter.

AFC: GEORGE SHOWS IMPROVEMENT, BIASUCCI'S 38-YARD FIELD GOAL WITH 1:46 LEFT

<P>
Indianapolis rookie Jeff George continued his progression as an NFL quarterback 
Sunday against the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
George, the No. 1 pick in the 1989 draft, passed for a season-high 249 yards 
and two second-half touchdowns to lead the Colts to a 17-14 comeback victory. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Biasucci provided the Colts (4-6) with their winning margin by kicking a 
38-yard field goal with 1:46 left. 
</P>
<P>
"He is taking giant steps forward," Indianapolis Coach Ron Meyer said of 
George. "The thing he gives you is a striking ability. Down, 14-0, you're not 
out of the game." 
</P>
<P>
The Jets (4-7) took a 14-0 lead on four field goals by Pat Leahy and a safety. 
</P>
<P>
But George, who completed 14 of 22 passes, including eight of 13 in the second 
half, overcame a defense that held the Colts to 88 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
It was a team-record 10th consecutive game the Colts failed to reach 100 yards 
on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"We struggled in the first half," George said. "It seemed we couldn't run or 
pass, but once we learned their defensive schemes, we seemed to move the ball 
better in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the momentum started going our way, everything worked." 
</P>
<P>
The momentum swung when Erik McMillan intercepted a pass by George and then 
tried to lateral the ball while he was being tackled. George recovered at the 
Jets' 43. On the next play, George connected with Jessie Hester on a 43-yard 
touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts tied the score with 7:22 left when George connected with Stanley 
Morgan on a three-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets managed only 13 yards on their next possession, and a 33-yard punt 
return by Clarence Verdin gave the Colts the ball at the Jets' 41. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts reached the eight, but a holding penalty and sack forced them back to 
the 23, where Biasucci kicked the go-ahead field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Jet quarterback Ken O'Brien, who completed 25 of 35 passes for 272 yards, 
sustained a concussion in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Eason replaced O'Brien and took the Jets to the Indianapolis 33 in the 
final minute. 
</P>
<P>
An offensive pass interference penalty cost the Jets 10 yards, and after a 
five-yard pass to Johnny Hector, a fourth-down pass was incomplete.

BILLS SLOWED BUT NOT STOPPED BY PATRIOTS; 
</P>
<P>
AFC: THOMAS SCORES ON 80-YARD RUN IN FOURTH QUARTER AS BUFFALO BEATS NEW 
ENGLAND, 14-0.

<P>
The Buffalo Bills entered their game against the New England Patriots with an 
NFL-high 274 points. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the Patriots held the Bills to 14 points, but that was still more 
than enough against the league's worst team. 
</P>
<P>
Thurman Thomas provided the clinching touchdown on an 80-yard run with under 
two minutes left Sunday to lead the Bills to a 14-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills (9-1), who scored 87 points in their previous two games, won for the 
eighth consecutive time. The Patriots (1-9) lost their eighth game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got bad breaks," Patriot running back George Adams said. "We took the 
field like we were 8-1, not 1-8. We know what we can do; it's just a matter of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second shutout in three weeks for the Bills, who blanked Cleveland, 
42-0, two weeks ago. The Patriots had not been shut out since Nov. 20, 1983, by 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who had 22 carries for 165 yards, also scored in the first quarter on a 
five-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly, the AFC's top-rated passer, completed only five 
of 15 passes for 79 yards as the Bills managed only 288 yards of offense. 
</P>
<P>
Patriot quarterback Marc Wilson completed 21 of 33 passes for 234 yards and had 
two passes intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots came closest to scoring early in the second quarter after driving 
54 yards. 
</P>
<P>
With the Bills leading, 7-0, the Patriots had a first and goal from the Buffalo 
one-yard-line. Three plays later, it was fourth-and-goal from the one and the 
Patriots went for it. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Allen, who ran effectively early in the game, tried to run off the right 
side of the offensive line. But Buffalo linebacker Ray Bentley shot through and 
stopped him for a one-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
"About four guys hit me and I shed them all and got in there," Bentley said 
jokingly. "Actually, the guard pulled out of there and I just went in where he 
left and came through untouched." 
</P>
<P>
Bentley said he was surprised the Patriots tried to run the ball, but once they 
came to the line of scrimmage, he said he knew what play was coming. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't necessarily know that the guard would pull, but that's a scheme they 
do have," he said. "We had great penetration on the other side to keep the back 
from bouncing outside so I could get to him." 
</P>
<P>
New England Coach Rod Rust said he didn't regret the call. "It was a good 
defense against the play." 
</P>
<P>
The play seemed to inspire the Bills' defense, which kept the Patriots in check 
until New England's next-to-last drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots moved from their 14 to the Buffalo 38. But the drive ended when 
rookie James Williams intercepted a pass by Wilson in the end zone that was 
intended for Irving Fryar. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a feeling they were going to try and go toward me because I was a rookie 
out there," said Williams, the Bills' first-round draft choice who was starting 
for injured Kirby Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo got the ball on its 20 and the Patriots let Thomas slice through the 
line on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
"We were basically just trying to get a first down," Thomas said. "The 
offensive line came off the ball well. Usually, that play doesn't cut back all 
the way to the right, but the hole was so big I just had to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Patriot safety Fred Marion said his team was "cutting down on giving up the 
easy stuff. But he (Thomas) broke right, they made good blocks and we didn't 
get over to make the play."

BIG WEST PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
UNLV'S CHANCE AT BEING NO. 1 MAY LIE IN THE CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Big West Conference has long been awash in the reflected glory -- and 
shared tournament revenue -- of Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
So if you think UNLV is in limbo as it awaits the result of its appeal of the 
NCAA ruling barring the Rebels from defending their NCAA tournament title, 
consider the rest of the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Put it this way: If Duke is safe from another tournament final onslaught, who 
pays? 
</P>
<P>
Some Big West coaches think they know. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can't play in the (NCAA) tournament, they'll be driven to prove 
they're No. 1 anyway by winning all their games, and by winning them all by big 
margins," said UC Santa Barbara Coach Jerry Pimm, whose team holds the 
distinction of being the last to defeat UNLV, 78-70, on Feb. 26. "Whether or 
not they could do that would be their quest." 
</P>
<P>
Say you're San Jose State, which lost to the Rebels by scores of 100-80 and 
105-69 last season; or UC Irvine, which lost one game by 103-67? And now UNLV 
is going to get mad? 
</P>
<P>
Even New Mexico State, which beat UNLV early in the season and went 26-5, lost 
to UNLV by 23 points in February. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, they've always played knowing they would get in the tournament 
anyway," Pimm said. "But every week, every game, would become very important. 
They could take the challenge like that, to show they're the best team in the 
country and say, 'OK, we can't play, but let's end up No. 1 in all the polls.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
As Cal State Long Beach Coach Seth Greenberg sees it, every Big West team could 
become party to UNLV's vendetta. 
</P>
<P>
"If (UNLV is barred from the NCAA tournament), I think they'll use the regular 
season as a postseason tournament so as to make a potential farce out of 
whoever wins the (NCAA) tournament," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
So Big West coaches say they support UNLV's appeal. Is it fraternal good will 
or just self-preservation? 
</P>
<P>
UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian said there would be neither a let-down nor vengeance 
from his team if the NCAA ruling stands. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guys are good guys. They play hard all the time," Tarkanian said. "They'll 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
"You would be shocked if you sat through a week of practice. The Rebels never 
talk about any of that stuff. When we won the championship, we never talked 
about vindictiveness." 
</P>
<P>
If UNLV's appeal is denied, the Big West will have to decide whether to allow 
the Rebels to play in the conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
To include UNLV could deny another team a chance to win the automatic NCAA bid 
that goes with a conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
But to exclude the Rebels would be a blow to image, TV ratings and gate 
receipts. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a tough decision," said Jim Haney, conference commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
And the Big West, like UNLV, would rather not face it unless absolutely 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
A look at the conference: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CAL STATE FULLERTON 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 13-16, 6-12 
</P>
<P>
Conference finish: Seventh 
</P>
<P>
A promising team went awry last season. The Titans won six games in December, 
but played erratically after that and lost eight of their final nine. 
</P>
<P>
The players responsible for most of the scoring, Cedric Ceballos and Mark Hill, 
are gone -- Ceballos to the Phoenix Suns. Junior point guard Wayne Williams is 
the only returning starter. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach John Sneed says this team's chemistry has improved, and, although 
chosen to finish last in the Big West by conference coaches, he says the Titans 
can be better than that. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Agee Ward, a junior, is the most experienced returning player other 
than Williams. The top newcomer appears to be guard Joe Small, who was the top 
community-college scorer in the state last season, averaging 25.3 points at the 
College of the Sequoias. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CAL STATE LONG BEACH 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 23-9, 12-6 
</P>
<P>
Conference finish: Fourth 
</P>
<P>
One conference coach says Long Beach has more good players than any team in the 
Big West -- including UNLV, which he concedes has the best starting five. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Seth Greenberg has most of the players back from a team that was left out 
of the NCAA tournament on a controversial decision by the selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest loss was point guard Tyrone Mitchell. Bobby Sears, a junior, 
probably will steer the 49er running game. Lucious Harris, a sophomore guard 
who was conference freshman of the year and scored in double figures 26 times, 
is on top of a pile of talent that runs very, very deep. 
</P>
<P>
The schedule includes road games against Arizona and Syracuse, but Greenberg 
says the biggest questions about his team concern its green neon "California 
Gold" uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
"They're so ugly they're nice. And if you think they're so ugly, wait until you 
see our warm-ups." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FRESNO STATE 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 10-19, 4-14 
</P>
<P>
Conference finish: Ninth 
</P>
<P>
With the departure of Ron Adams, the last vestiges of the Boyd Grant era are 
gone. Gary Colson, the former Pepperdine and New Mexico coach, will junk the 
Bulldogs' trademark deliberate, defensive style in favor of an up-tempo game, 
despite the personnel he has inherited. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for (the players), but I think I have to go with what I think 
will work," Colson said. "Maybe we could win a few more games this year by 
controlling the ball, and they have done a nice job with that before. But I 
don't think that's the answer in the long run for us. We need to play up-tempo 
so we can recruit to be competitive in the league." 
</P>
<P>
The top three scorers, juniors Wilbert Hooker and Tod Bernard and senior Chris 
Henderson, are back. Bernard, at 6-5, has moved inside, where he and Henderson, 
6-6, will play on the league's smallest front line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEVADA LAS VEGAS 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 35-5, 16-2 
</P>
<P>
Conference finish: First (tie) 
</P>
<P>
Larry Johnson, a consensus first team All-American; Stacey Augmon, the MVP of 
the NCAA West Regional; Anderson Hunt, the MVP of the Final Four; and Greg 
Anthony are back from a team that won the NCAA championship game by the largest 
margin in title game history. 
</P>
<P>
The only starter who is not back, center David Butler, is replaced by George 
Ackles, who started 27 games two years ago but redshirted last year after 
breaking his wrist. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that concerns me, and I know it's something that concerns all 
coaches, is that we can't afford any injuries to our key people," Tarkanian 
said. "We have a tremendous drop-off any time we go from one of our starting 
positions to the next person, but our starting five is very, very good." 
</P>
<P>
Ask Duke, a 103-73 loser in the NCAA final. 
</P>
<P>
The one freshman is an important addition: H Waldman gives Tarkanian a backup 
for Anthony at point guard. And yes, his name is H with no period; his mother 
disliked the family name Herb. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW MEXICO STATE 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 26-5, 16-2 
</P>
<P>
Conference finish: First (tie) 
</P>
<P>
UNLV's guards had the Final Four as their showcase last season, but they were 
beaten for first-team all-conference by the Aggies' Keith Hill and Randy Brown. 
Only Brown is back to lead the next of a succession of stunningly athletic and 
balanced teams Coach Neil McCarthy has constructed from community college 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy says Brown can be the first player he has coached in his 16-year 
career to play in the NBA. Forwards Reggie Jordan and Michael New are the other 
starters back from the team that relegated UNLV to the second seed in the 
conference tournament after sharing the title. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies faded at the end last season, losing to Long Beach in the Big West 
tournament and to Loyola Marymount in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PACIFIC 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 15-14, 7-11 
</P>
<P>
Conference finish: Sixth 
</P>
<P>
Three years after going 0-18 in the Big West, the Tigers are on the brink of 
breaking into the conference's upper division. Coach Bob Thomason took over the 
season after the Tigers reached their nadir, and in two years he has made them 
a threat. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific beat UC Santa Barbara in two of three games last season, including in 
the Big West tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The team's top scorers, junior guard Dell Demps and senior center Don Lyttle, 
are back, and both have a touch from three-point range, a favorite tactic of 
Thomason's. 
</P>
<P>
Lyttle's consistency and rebounding will be critical for a team that had 
particular trouble at defensive rebounding, Thomason says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SAN JOSE STATE 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 8-20, 5-13 in the Big West 
</P>
<P>
Conference finish: Eighth 
</P>
<P>
A year after the walk-out against Bill Berry decimated the program, Stan 
Morrison coaxed eight victories out of the Spartans, and a team that was a 
consensus last-place pick finished eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Batiste, a scrappy guard whose 12-point average was second on the team, 
and sophomore guard Charles Terrell, a walk-on last season, are co-captains and 
the emotional core of the team. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison said he may play 12 players, but adds a caveat: "That may mean we have 
a lot of mediocre guys." 
</P>
<P>
The talent pool should be deepened by new players such as freshman forward Mike 
Brotherton and Michael St. Julien, a 6-4 forward who won the national 
community-college high jump title with a leap of 7' 3 1/4." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UC IRVINE 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 5-23, 3-15 in the Big West 
</P>
<P>
Conference finish: 10th 
</P>
<P>
This Anteater team will be better. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got to be better, after what we went through last year," said Coach Bill 
Mulligan, whose team set a school record by losing 15 games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Butler, a 6-7 senior center who has weighed close to 300 pounds at times, 
was driven by the misery of the season to slim down to 245 and should exceed 
his team-leading averages of 14 points and seven rebounds a game. Forward Jeff 
Herdman is the only other senior, and after losing his touch last season, will 
try to regain the form that helped him briefly lead the nation in three-point 
shooting percentage two seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Dylan Rigdon and forwards Jeff Von Lutzow and Craig Marshall will try to 
fulfill the promise they showed as freshman. But the player who might be most 
crucial is Gerald McDonald, a point guard out of Compton College who must steer 
the all-out running game on which Mulligan has staked hopes of a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UC SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 21-9, 13-5 in the Big West 
</P>
<P>
Conference finish: Third 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos were the winners of a strange either/or NCAA bid game between Santa 
Barbara and Long Beach last season, and proved they belonged in the field by 
beating Houston and advancing to the second round, where they lost to Michigan 
State. But superb rebounder Eric McArthur and guard Carrick DeHart, who each 
averaged 15 points, are gone from a team that was the only one to beat UNLV 
after January. 
</P>
<P>
The best returning players are senior forward Gary Gray, junior guard Paul 
Johnson and junior forward Lucius Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Six players will rotate in the guard positions, and Coach Jerry Pimm says the 
Gauchos will turn to more of a running game by handing the ball to sophomore 
point guard Ray Kelly, a strikingly quick transfer from Texas Christian. 
</P>
<P>
The area of concern is inside, where Pimm hopes Gray will get help from another 
transfer who could make a difference, Sam Robson, a 6-11 center from North 
Carolina Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UTAH STATE 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 14-16, 8-10 in the Big West 
</P>
<P>
Conference finish: Fifth 
</P>
<P>
Three seasons ago, Utah State won the Big West tournament, earning its first 
automatic NCAA bid in Rod Tueller's last year as coach. In the two seasons 
since, neither of the teams coached by Kohn Smith, Tueller's hand-picked 
successor, has broken .500. 
</P>
<P>
This could be the first. 
</P>
<P>
His best player, Kendall Youngblood, was the conference freshman of the year 
two seasons ago and has played everything from point guard to small forward. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the top eight scorers are back, including four starters. Rich Jardine, 
a slender forward with a long-range shooting touch, and Randy Funk, his more 
rugged counterpart, give the team experience inside.

NO JOKE THIS TIME: REBELS ARE THE COACHES' CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nevada Las Vegas, the defending NCAA champion and the preseason No. 1 in many 
national polls, has been picked to win the Big West Conference title by 
conference coaches. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, they picked Cal State Long Beach in a half-jesting effort to draw 
attention to teams other than UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
But this season, with Larry Johnson, Stacey Augmon, Anderson Hunt and Greg 
Anthony back from a team that defeated Duke by 30 points in the NCAA 
championship game, the coaches made UNLV a unanimous choice. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV is preparing to open its season Dec. 1 against Alabama Birmingham, but 
still is awaiting the result of an appeal to the NCAA asking for a reversal of 
a ruling that bars the Rebels from defending their NCAA tournament title. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope we're going to be in the tournament," said Coach Jerry Tarkanian, who 
has made an offer to sit out the event if the team is allowed to play. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State, which tied UNLV for the regular-season title last season and 
lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament, was picked second. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach, which was 23-9 and barely missed making the NCAA field, 
was chosen third, and UC Santa Barbara, which was 21-9 and lost in the second 
round, was fourth.

A NEW COACH, BUT THE OLD INTENSITY; 
</P>
<P>
CS LONG BEACH: GREENBERG TAKES OVER FOR HARRINGTON AND VOWS TO MAINTAIN 
FAST-PACED ATTACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With his intense nature, run-and-press philosophy and fondness for fluorescent 
uniforms, Seth Greenberg, the new basketball coach at Cal State Long Beach, is 
similar to his predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can't be Joe Harrington," he said. "Joe is such a handsome guy that when 
he walked into a room, every one would kind of turn. I'm just a bald-headed 
Jewish kid from New York trying to coach a little basketball in Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg, 34, is a head coach for the first time in a 12-year career that 
began at Columbia University when his hairline had yet to recede. He got the 
49er job last March when Harrington left after a 23-9 season for the University 
of Colorado, and the team Greenberg has inherited is receiving more national 
attention than any at Long Beach since the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach has been rated as high as 20th in preseason publications and is 
picked to finish third behind Nevada Las Vegas and New Mexico State in the Big 
West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they have more good players than Vegas," UC Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan 
said. "But Vegas has a more talented starting five." 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg, who was an assistant at Pittsburgh, Virginia and Miami of Florida, 
knows that because his reputation is mainly that of a relentless recruiter, 
skeptics will question whether he can actually coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't just concentrated on recruiting for 12 years," he said. "I've spent 
a lot of time learning how to teach the game and developing a philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"I know people are going to say, 'Maybe they could have been a little better if 
he had more experience.' It's almost like if we win this year, we're going to 
win because of good players and if we lose it's because we're not well-coached. 
That's fine, I can't concern myself with that." 
</P>
<P>
As a 49er assistant the last three years, Greenberg would throw his coat and 
become even more inflamed than Harrington. He intends to be less hyper, though 
at a practice in the little university gym he seemed the same, reprimanding his 
players profanely if they didn't respond to his shouts of "Quick, quick . . . 
run hard, run the floor . . . push it . . . pressure." 
</P>
<P>
He wondered recently how personally his players take those tirades, and center 
Frankie Edwards told him, "It makes us feel like you care about us." 
</P>
<P>
That pleased Greenberg, who describes his program as people-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what makes us successful," he said. "That's what enables us to drive 
kids hard. Yet when practice is over, we have a different relationship with 
them. Some people think you can't, as a head coach, have a relationship with 
your kids off the court. But I want them to feel free to come over to my house. 
I want them in my office." 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach's recruiting brochure, the father of a former 49er player calls 
Greenberg the "best coach from the standpoint of dealing with the human side of 
things." 
</P>
<P>
That theme pervades the brochure, which includes two pages of laudatory 
comments about Greenberg from former players and coaches Lute Olson, Mike 
Schuler and Rick Pitino; a photo taken last spring of Greenberg with two 
players wearing graduation robes, and a list of players he has recruited since 
his days at Columbia and the type of degrees they attained. 
</P>
<P>
The brochure, Greenberg insists, is a reflection of his sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
"I coach because of the relationships you have with kids, going through the 
good times and bad times with them," he said. "If you're just coaching for the 
good times, when the cameras are on, you're in it for the wrong reason." 
</P>
<P>
All of the 49ers were recruited by Greenberg. They average 6 feet 7 and fit the 
pressing system that Harrington installed in 1987, when he took over a losing 
program, and which the new coach plans to make even faster. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be an aggressor," Greenberg said. "Because we have tremendous 
depth, we have the opportunity to play with fresh legs for 40 minutes. We can 
wear people down." 
</P>
<P>
He plans to use 10 players, the best of whom is guard Lucious Harris, last 
year's Big West freshman of the year. The 6-5 Harris likes to swoop down the 
baseline for dunks, but can also shoot from outside -- a talent few 49ers have 
shown in recent seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a chance to be as good a guard as there is in the country," Greenberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach also has strong inside players, among them 6-8, 250-pound Edwards 
and 6-9, 220-pound Kevin Cutler. 
</P>
<P>
The big question is how the team will perform in close games without the fierce 
spirit of graduated point guard Tyrone Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
But for the first time in more than a decade, Long Beach appears to be starting 
a season with respect. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting there," Greenberg said. " We're not feared, but I think people 
around the country know that this team is going to fight, that it's going to 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
"Who would have thought three years ago that we would be in our position now 
with our preseason rankings and our talent base and expectations? Last year, I 
thought we made our greatest stride when we were playing Vegas in the Long 
Beach Arena and people were there to see Long Beach State. To me, that was 
progress." 
</P>
<P>
Last season's team received nationwide sympathy when, despite a 22-8 record, it 
wasn't selected for the NCAA tournament. The 49ers instead went to the NIT and 
lost in the second round to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
They will continue to wear glow-in-the-dark lime uniforms that caused almost as 
much of a stir last year as their record. 
</P>
<P>
"That 'California gold' kind of reflects the beach and our style of play -- 
free-flowing, fast, sharp," Greenberg said. "It's an easy way to make the kids 
feel good about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
He wants happy players: "Happy players work hard at practice. Happy players go 
to class. Happy players are a positive reflection on the university because 
they end up as graduates." 
</P>
<P>
One player was not happy Thursday night. Harris was not allowed to practice 
because he had missed a class. Afterward, Greenberg met with him for a quiet 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a really good kid," Greenberg said after Harris had left. "But he has to 
realize he's not invincible. When we recruit them, we tell them this is the way 
we are." 
</P>
<P>
Later, the coach sat behind his desk and, noting the nearness of his debut, 
said, "We'll see if I know what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
He ran his hands over his forehead and, after a moment's thought, decided that 
he does.

Clyde Drexler scored 30 points, the fourth consecutive game he has had at least 
that many, and the Portland Trail Blazers remained the NBA's only unbeaten team 
Sunday night with a 125-112 victory over the Bulls at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Portland (9-0) equaled a club record for its best start, set in 1979, when the 
Trail Blazers finished the season with a losing record. 
</P>
<P>
Drexler added nine assists and seven rebounds. Chicago's Michael Jordan had 20 
of his 29 points in the second half to go with seven assists and five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 103, Minnesota 94 -- Karl Malone scored 24 points and the Jazz ended a 
four-game losing streak by turning back the Timberwolves at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
John Stockton added 22 points for Utah, and Tyrone Corbin and Tony Campbell 
each scored 24 for Minnesota.

BRUINS' 42 POINTS ARE RECORD FOR THEIR MOST WITHOUT WINNING

<TEXT>
<P>
It's small consolation to UCLA, but the 42 points it scored in losing to USC, 
45-42, Saturday at the Rose Bowl was the most ever by the Bruins without 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
The previous record for scoring futility was a 41-40 loss to Oregon in 1970 at 
the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, UCLA's 42 points was the most ever scored by a USC opponent in a 
losing cause. The previous record was a 48-41 victory over Arizona in 1982. 
Larry Smith, USC's coach, was Arizona's coach at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Maddox, UCLA's redshirt freshman quarterback, earned a footnote in the 
opponent's section of the USC media guide. 
</P>
<P>
He passed for 409 yards, second only to the 526 yards Notre Dame's Joe 
Theismann compiled in 1970 against USC. Like Saturday, it wasn't enough to win. 
USC won that year, 38-28. 
</P>
<P>
Maddox set a school passing yardage record and also one for total offense. He 
had 445 yards, breaking the record of 400 set by Steve Bono against Brigham 
Young in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
There were five lead changes in Saturday's game, prompting Smith to say: "There 
has never been a better game for a rivalry game that I've been involved with. 
It's just too bad that we weren't playing for the Rose Bowl (bid)." 
</P>
<P>
The condition of Raghib (Rocket) Ismail, Notre Dame running back and kick 
returner, is day-to-day regarding whether he will play Saturday at the Coliseum 
against USC, according to Notre Dame. A thigh bruise kept Ismail out of the 
second half of last Saturday's game against Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
One of Coach Lou Holtz's rules has been that a player must practice at least 
twice during the week to play in a game. MAL FLORENCE

SHUMAN WINS FINAL SPRINT-CAR RACE AT ASCOT

After all the speeches and all the tears, they finally ran the final sprint-car 
race at Ascot Park Saturday night, and Ron Shuman's victory seemed as 
inevitable as the closing of the little track. 
</P>
<P>
Shuman, the California Racing Assn. points leader from Tempe, Ariz., won the 
13th annual 50-lap Don Peabody Classic after passing leader Mike Kirby of Long 
Beach on the 42nd lap. 
</P>
<P>
Cary Faas of Yorba Linda finished second. 
</P>
<P>
About double the average attendance -- 8,224 -- was on hand and they stayed 
well after midnight. The feature race didn't begin until 11:37 p.m. and was 
slowed by two caution periods. 
</P>
<P>
The Peabody wasn't the track's last event. The curtain is scheduled to come 
down for good with Thursday night's running of the 50th 100-lap Turkey Night 
Grand Prix for USAC midget race cars.

NO CONTEST, EARNHARDT WINS; 
</P>
<P>
MOTOR RACING: HE IS THE NASCAR SEASON CHAMPION AFTER FINISHING THIRD AT 
ATLANTA. MORGAN SHEPHERD WINS RACE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Mark Martin failed to mount a challenge for the Winston Cup stock car 
championship Sunday in the season-ending Atlanta Journal 500, Dale Earnhardt 
contented himself with motoring his Chevrolet Lumina to a third-place finish to 
clinch the $1 million season championship bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who had led much of the season until the next-to-last race at Phoenix, 
finished sixth, one lap behind Morgan Shepherd, the race winner in Bud Moore's 
Ford Thunderbird. It was Shepherd's first victory since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got nothing to be embarrassed about," Martin said. "We ran as hard as we 
could all day, all year in fact, and we got beat by the best. Maybe we'll be 
the best next year. I guarantee you we'll be better, but right now it's Dale's 
party. We probably weren't good enough to win anyway. We're just happy we 
pushed them as hard as we did." 
</P>
<P>
Shepherd's victory pulled Ford into a tie with Chevrolet for the manufacturers' 
championship with 194 points, but Chevy won the most races, 13 to 11, which was 
the tie-breaker. 
</P>
<P>
"After the way the year started in Daytona (where Earnhardt lost to Derrike 
Cope on the last turn of the last lap when a cut tire went flat), it's been a 
tough year," Earnhardt said. "We won nine races and four poles, more than 
anyone else, but we kept having things go wrong and got behind in the points. 
We're happy now, though, and it's more satisfying because we had to race right 
to the finish to get it. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a close call today when that car (Jim Bown's Pontiac) spun in front of 
me and I couldn't see for the dust, but after that we had no trouble. When we 
found out we weren't going to catch Morgan or (Geoff) Bodine, we decided to 
settle down and take third place and be sure we had the championship." 
</P>
<P>
A crowd estimated at 75,000, attracted by the possibility of a million-dollar 
shootout between Earnhardt and Martin, jammed the newly renamed Atlanta Motor 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
Earnhardt, who also picked up five bonus points for leading the race, finished 
26 points -- 4,430 to 4,404 -- ahead of Martin, who will collect $330,000 as 
the season runner-up. Earnhardt's take Sunday, including season-long 
contingencies for winning the championship, will amount to about $1,326,000. 
</P>
<P>
This pushes the year's take for the 38-year-old second-generation driver from 
Doolie, N.C., to an unofficial $3,202,830, which includes $170,000 for winning 
the International Race of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
It is Earnhardt's fourth Winston Cup championship. Only Richard Petty, with 
seven, has won more. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we'll make seven. It's getting tougher and tougher to win with 
guys like Jack Roush (Martin's car owner) in the game today, but even if I got 
to seven or even eight, Richard would still be the King," Earnhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
Geoff Bodine finished second, 2.52 seconds behind Shepherd, and Dale Jarrett 
fourth, both in Fords. They were the only other drivers on the same lap with 
Shepherd, who won $62,150. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I look at it, this was a $400,000 win for us," said Moore, 65, who ran 
the late Joe Weatherly's cars when he won the championship in 1962 and 1963. 
"It got us back on the Winner's Circle program (of financial incentives for 
racing next year), and that's what it's worth for a season." 
</P>
<P>
Shepherd averaged 140.911 m.p.h. for the 328-lap race, which included 34 laps 
run under caution flag conditions. There were 19 lead changes among nine 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came around the saw that checkered flag, I had tears in my eyes," said 
Shepherd, 49, who started 20th. "I'm glad we saved our best tires for the end. 
We needed them to finish as strong as we did."

CHIEFS: CHARGER RUNNING BACK HELD TO SEASON-LOW 40 YARDS ON 14 CARRIES. CHIEFS 
QUARTERBACK STEVE DEBERG MADE THE MOST OF SUPPORT FROM DEFENSE AND OFFENSIVE 
LINE.

<P>
Marion Butts' words came back to haunt him Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Butts, the Charger running back, told HBO's "Inside the NFL" last week that the 
team the Chargers were most concerned with in the AFC was the Los Angeles 
Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the Kansas City Chiefs were watching. Their inspired defense held 
Butts, who came into the game as the NFL's leading rusher, to a season-low 40 
yards on 14 carries in Kansas City's 27-10 victory over the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched the show," Chiefs linebacker Dino Hackett said, "and when you make 
statements like that, he was acting like he was overlooking us." 
</P>
<P>
Butts had reason to be confident against the Chiefs, a team the Chargers had 
beaten five consecutive times. Last season, he carried 54 times for 248 yards 
against Kansas City, including a 176-yard performance in a 20-13 victory at 
Arrowhead Stadium in December. 
</P>
<P>
But he never got untracked Sunday. Butts, who was averaging 4.7 yards a carry 
going into the game, managed only 2.9 yards per attempt against the Chiefs, and 
his longest run was a 13-yard sweep. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an outstanding back," Chiefs Coach Marty Schottenheimer said, "but if he 
only gets 14 rushes, it's going to be hard for him to get his 100 yards. You 
have to run the ball a significant number of times to make rushing yards." 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs were so consumed with stopping him that backup safety Danny Copeland 
scrawled on the notebook containing the game plan, "BUTTS." 
</P>
<P>
"The guy is young, and he doesn't understand, you don't take anybody for 
granted in this league," Chiefs outside linebacker Chris Martin said. 
"Everybody has the same amount of talent. It's a matter of performing on 
Sunday. You try to not to give any added fuel to an opposing team." 
</P>
<P>
Butts, a two-year veteran, insisted he was saying the Raiders are the team to 
beat in division, "and I still believe so, regardless of the (Chiefs') 
victory." 
</P>
<P>
Though the Chargers ranked sixth in the NFL in rushing going into the game and 
Kansas City was 13th in stopping the run, the Chiefs have been improving in 
that area since their open date three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two games, they held the Raiders' tandem of Bo Jackson and Marcus 
Allen to 64 yards, and Seattle's Derrick Fenner and John L. Williams to 56 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought they could come in and run the ball and do whatever they wanted," 
linebacker Derrick Thomas said. "We were determined that wouldn't happen 
because for the last three or four weeks, we've been playing great run defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Our attitude today was different than against them last year. All the marbles 
are on the line right now. Given the Dolphins take care of business (tonight 
against the Raiders) we're in first place in the AFC West. That's on all our 
minds, so every game from here on in is like a playoff game." 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Chiefs simplified their defense against the Chargers' power running 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year against them, we were out of position a lot," strong safety Kevin 
Porter said. "We weren't coordinated in our run support. Today, we only had 
three defenses coming into the game." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Butts touched the ball, San Diego was trailing 10-0 and had to play 
catch-up the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs struck early on Steve DeBerg's 90-yard pass-run play to J.J. Birden 
on Kansas City's third play of the game. It was Kansas City's first offensive 
touchdown in 10 quarters, or since DeBerg hooked up with Birden on a 33-yarder 
Oct. 21 at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a well-designed play," DeBerg said. "It was a new wrinkle we did 
this week, and it worked perfectly. They got confused by the snap of the ball 
because we did a little motion and we got them." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was DeBerg's first against the Chargers in five starts with the 
Chiefs and only his second in eight career starts against the Chargers. In 
fact, in two starts against the Chargers last year, he threw seven 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"The great thing as far as I'm concerned was the outstanding pass protection," 
said DeBerg, who was sacked only once. "What a difference a year makes. Both 
times we played them last year, I was very beat up. The offensive line played 
outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the line give DeBerg time and enable him to extend his streak of 
passes without an interception to 135, it paved the way for Barry Word's 90 
yards in 17 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Word, a free agent who sat out nearly two years after leaving the New Orleans 
Saints, took over as the Chiefs feature back, replacing Christian Okoye, who 
managed only 43 yards in 15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll find out who's got the hot hand and, whoever (does), we'll let him run," 
Schottenheimer said. "It is our intention to play both." 
</P>
<P>
Word had seven runs of four yards or more, including a long run of 23 as he 
darted quickly to the outside on sweeps and made effective cutbacks on inside 
runs. He also caught a pass for nine yards. 
</P>
<P>
"They had all sorts of people all around the line of scrimmage," Word said, 
"and we didn't expect to get really long runs. But I did want to get a few 
situations where I was in the secondary. When you can do that, you're winning. 
When the defensive backs are making tackles, you're beating them pretty well. 
</P>
<P>
"The offensive line leaned on those guys, they blocked them, they opened up 
some cracks for me, and I was able to exploit that."

BOWL CONFIRMS ITS INTEREST IN AZTECS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: INDEPENDENCE BOWL OFFICIAL SAYS, HOWEVER, THAT 'SOME PEOPLE 
HAVE TO FALL ON THEIR FACES' FOR SAN DIEGO STATE TO WIN AN INVITATION.

<P>
An Independence Bowl official confirmed Sunday that San Diego State is one of 
several teams being considered for the Dec. 15 game in Shreveport, La., but he 
cautioned that the possibility of the Aztecs being selected is remote. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say, right now, some people have to fall on their faces before (SDSU) 
gets here," said Cecil Lloyd, President of the Shreveport Sports Foundation, 
the governing body of the Independence Bowl. "They would add some color to the 
game, but it's an outside possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd said there are at least five teams other than the Aztecs (5-4) under 
consideration to play a Southwest Conference team, most likely Baylor (6-3-1): 
South Carolina (5-5), North Carolina (6-4-1), Temple (6-4), Louisiana Tech 
(8-3) and Maryland (6-5), which sneaked into the picture after Saturday's 35-30 
upset of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
According to NCAA rules, official bids cannot be tendered before Nov. 24. The 
Independence Bowl Selection Committee met Sunday night in Shreveport and will 
meet again tonight. They have not yet decided whom they will scout Saturday, 
although Lloyd said nobody will be in San Diego for the SDSU-Texas El Paso 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"Limited funds," Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee has seen every team mentioned play except for SDSU and Maryland. 
Lloyd said the committee has spoken with officials from both of those schools, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU Athletic Director Fred Miller was in contact with committee members via 
telephone Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We presented our case," Miller said. "I think at this point, everybody is 
holding their cards in. They have some options, and some limitations, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're interested in us. All I can do is take them at face value." 
</P>
<P>
Although Independence officials will not publicly acknowledge their top 
choices, SDSU seems to be facing long odds: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Louisiana Tech battled Auburn before losing, 16-14, has the best record of 
the bunch and is the hometown favorite. The school is only 70 miles from 
Shreveport. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Temple would give the Independence Bowl good play in the East Coast media, 
something that the committee would like. Plus, Temple told the committee it 
thinks it can get alumnus Bill Cosby to Shreveport for the game, which would 
enliven festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 -- North Carolina and Maryland are both from the high-profile Atlantic Coast 
Conference, which is attractive to the bowl. North Carolina has indicated a 
possible problem with final exams, although schools have been known to work 
around that. 
</P>
<P>
 -- South Carolina has a large following that likely will buy tickets and boost 
the local economy. As bowl officials put it, the Gamecocks travel well. 
</P>
<P>
"The con part about San Diego State is they would not bring many people," Lloyd 
said. "The pro is they have some real good athletes on their team. A couple 
have a chance to get national recognition." 
</P>
<P>
Miller initially piqued Independence Bowl interest in SDSU early last week with 
a telephone call after Louisville decided to play in the Fiesta Bowl. 
Louisville's announcement caused a series of moves, including Southern 
Mississippi's decision to play in the All-American Bowl -- which sent the 
Independence Bowl scrambling. Southern Mississippi had tentatively agreed to 
play in the Independence Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you what, this is the worst year I've ever seen as far as bowl 
selections," said Lloyd, who has been associated with the Independence Bowl for 
15 years. "Look at Virginia, and Notre Dame (both losing Saturday). It's 
absolutely wild." 
</P>
<P>
Western Athletic Conference Commissioner Joe Kearney, like Miller, has also 
made a few calls to the Independence Bowl attempting to sell SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
"We do that every year for our teams, try to get them placed," Kearney said. 
"First of all, with (Dan) McGwire at the helm, the (Independence Bowl) would be 
able to showcase an exciting offense. That's one thing I've been telling them." 
</P>
<P>
The way it now stands, at least four WAC teams will participate in bowls: 
Brigham Young (Holiday), Air Force (Liberty), Wyoming (Copper) and Colorado 
State (Freedom). 
</P>
<P>
With a victory Saturday against Texas El Paso, the Aztecs (5-4) will clinch a 
winning season. That's what is on Coach Al Luginbill's mind this week, although 
any bowl game excites him. 
</P>
<P>
"Geez, to have a chance . . . even if it's an outside chance," Luginbill said. 
"Who knows? I think we would be a very attractive draw." 
</P>
<P>
One reason, Luginbill said, is because he thinks the Aztecs could produce high 
television ratings. 
</P>
<P>
"An audience is not going to leave a TV game with us on it, I'll tell you 
that," he said. "We'll do something to keep them there." 
</P>
<P>
The Independence Bowl is played in city-owned Independence Stadium, which seats 
50,000-plus. The payout to each team is $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the crack is in the door, we'll keep pounding away," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Dan McGwire set an SDSU record in Saturday's 40-34 victory over New 
Mexico by producing 528 yards of total offense. He surpassed Dennis Shaw, who 
held the old record with 526. . . . Free safety Damon Pieri severely bruised a 
hand Saturday, but Coach Al Luginbill said he doesn't think Pieri will miss any 
practice time. Linebacker Andy Coviello, who suffered a bruised back in 
practice last week, was sore but OK Sunday after starting Saturday. "I thought 
he showed some mental toughness," Luginbill said. Otherwise, the Aztecs are 
healthy.

USD KNOCKED OUT OF PLAYOFFS 
</P>

<P>
The University of San Diego had a shot Sunday, but UCLA had many more. 
Therefore, it was bound to happen and did, but not until 12 minutes, 41 seconds 
into the first overtime period. 
</P>
<P>
That is when the UCLA men's soccer team, which had been hammering away at USD 
all afternoon, scored the winning goal in a 2-1 victory to advance to the NCAA 
West Region championship next weekend against Southern Methodist University. 
</P>
<P>
USD, the region's fourth-seeded team, finished its best season 16-3-5. It was 
the Toreros' second playoff game. It won its first Nov. 11, 4-2, at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
USD held the lead early, but could not keep it long, nor could it keep up with 
the speed and depth of UCLA (16-1-4), which is ranked No. 2 in the nation. It 
was only a matter of time, it seemed, before UCLA put things to rest. 
</P>
<P>
A gutsy performance by the Toreros' defense, particularly sweeper Trong Nguyen, 
kept the game's outcome in doubt until the 103rd minute. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied 1-1, Joe-Max Moore scored his sixth game-winning goal of 
the season. It came off a neat touch pass from Cobi Jones, who managed to 
dribble around and beat defenseman Kevin Arthur near the goal line to the left 
of the box. Moore's goal, his 11th of the season, came from about 10 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to come out and make him commit to one side," USD freshman goalie Tom 
Tate said. "He just hit it to the other side. I got a hand on it but not 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
USD Coach Seamus McFadden said the goal was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, this is a game where you can only absorb so much pressure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And the Bruins did keep up the pressure. UCLA outshot USD, 15-6, including 11-2 
in the second half and overtime periods. UCLA also had a 10-2 advantage in 
corner kicks. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin wing Chris Henderson took as many shots (six) as USD, including an 
open-net attempt that sailed just over the crossbar with five seconds left. 
Moore took four shots. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the public address announcer informed the paid crowd of 1,548 at 
North Field that USD was the highest scoring team in the West Region with 59 
goals, the Toreros scored their 60th, taking a 1-0 lead 10 minutes into the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Ronces, a senior from USDHS who led the Toreros in scoring last season with 
13, put one in from 10 yards out and off to the left side of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Setting up the goal, Ronces' ninth, Tom Crane (Poway High) made a pass in front 
of the goal that was headed away by UCLA's Mike Lapper, then tapped to Ronces 
by Alex Streicek. Crane and Streicek were awarded assists. 
</P>
<P>
Lapper and UCLA came back five minutes later to tie it. Lapper took a pass from 
Moore 25 yards out and to the right of the goal and looped a shot over Tate's 
head. 
</P>
<P>
Lapper, who broke his right leg in July, was playing his first game of the 
season. UCLA Coach Sigi Schmid had given Lapper, a junior, the option to 
redshirt, but Lapper wanted to play, citing the Bruins' chances of winning the 
national championship this season. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision was Mike's," Schmid said. "There's no way I'd make that decision 
for a kid like that. . . . His feeling was, 'Hey, this might be my only chance 
to win a national championship.' " 
</P>
<P>
USD midfielder Phillip Button, a sophomore from The Bishop's School, had a 
breakaway opportunity just outside the UCLA penalty box midway through the 
first half, but Chris Henderson caught him from behind and tackled him. 
Henderson drew a yellow card for unsportsmanlike play, but perhaps saved a 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
What goes around comes around, though. USD was whistled for a similar play -- 
Brenden Griffin taking down All-American forward Billy Thompson, who leads the 
West Region with 17 goals and 41 points -- with about a minute left in 
regulation. When regulation play ended, Schmid came out to midfield to have 
talk with the officials. He was not pleased that his star player received such 
treatment without the issuance of a red card. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that was a red card," Schmid said. "I thought that's one of the 
things that the World Cup had shown us that in soccer they want to cut down on 
that sort of thing so we get more scoring." 
</P>
<P>
USD had a couple of chances in the final 18 minutes. Most notably, Ronces got 
off a clean shot from 20 yards out but that was saved by goalie Brad Friedel. 
</P>
<P>
USD, which is 0-5-2 against UCLA, tied the Bruins earlier this year, 3-3, in 
San Diego. USD was the only team to score three goals off UCLA and Friedel. In 
fact, only one other managed two.

SHORT-HANDED GOAL HELPS EAGLES TIP GULLS

The hope of the moment chipped away slowly at first, then the wall came 
tumbling down. 
</P>
<P>
What should have been the most productive five minutes of the Gulls' Sunday 
night generated nothing but the winning goal for Salt Lake, who took a 4-2 
International Hockey League victory from the Gulls in front of 4,283 at the San 
Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Power-play efficiency has been a strong suit for the sporadic Gulls all season, 
but they let a five-minute advantage go to waste Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
At the same moment -- 10:44 -- the Gulls tied the score at 2-all in the third 
period, Salt Lake's Kevin Grant was tagged with a five-minute major penalty for 
attempting to injure Mike Gober. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls had wasted 3:19 of the opportunity before right wing Taylor Hall lost 
control of the puck as he tried to get out of the Eagles' zone. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew McKim stole the puck inside the blue line and put it past goalie Glen 
Hanlon for the 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"That sometimes happens," Gulls Coach Mike O'Connell said. "We were on the 
power play, and we were pressing. It was unfortunate, but we didn't spot the 
guy the way we're supposed to on a play like that." 
</P>
<P>
Said Clark Donatelli: "It wasn't there tonight. Who knows, we could come back 
the next game and go five-for five. They just didn't go in tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls didn't even get a shot on goal until there were just 42 seconds left 
of the power play. 
</P>
<P>
With 20 seconds left in the game and the Gulls' net empty, Martin Simard was 
awarded Salt Lake's final goal when Clark Donatelli kicked the stick from his 
hand to stop a breakaway. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what the rule was," Donatelli said. "I figured they were going 
to get the goal anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Derek Mayer continued his offensive punch with a second-period goal 
that narrowed the margin to 2-1. It was the only point of the period. 
</P>
<P>
When a short shot by Darren Lowe richocheted off goalie Steve Guenette's pads, 
Mayer capitalized and took a high swing from outside the right circle, and the 
puck danced over Guenette's shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive game, the Gulls' scoring line of Donatelli, center 
Larry Floyd and right wing Brent Sapergia was shut down. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd was assisted off the ice at 3:15 in the third period with a cut to the 
right eye after puck bounced up and hit him. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls allowed Salt Lake to scored twice for a 2-0 lead after one period. 
</P>
<P>
At 15:45, Hanlon anticipated that C.J. Young, skating in from the right circle, 
would circle behind the net. Instead, he was beaten easily when Young quickly 
tapped the puck in from outside the crease for the second goal. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Sabourin scored first for the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Holland evened the game at 2-all on the power play at 10:44 in the 
third.

The company said it expects an undetermined number of layoffs as a result. Work 
on the Strategic Defense Initiative and National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration space flights will be transferred to the space division; 
defensive missile systems and support systems projects will be shifted to the 
missile division. Together the three divisions employ about 18,600.

PLAN TO PAY LINCOLN S&amp;L UNITS' CREDITORS IS OKD; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: IT COVERS CLAIMS AGAINST 11 SUBSIDIARIES. A SETTLEMENT OF DEBTS OWED 
BY THE PARENT AMERICAN CONTINENTAL CORP. IS EXPECTED SOON.

<P>
A U.S. District Court judge in Phoenix has approved a plan to repay 700 
creditors of 11 Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
The action on Friday by U.S. District Court Judge Richard M. Bilby clears the 
way for resolution of bankruptcy filings involving the subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
The court action does not affect bondholders of American Continental Corp., 
Lincoln's parent company. Bilby will decide Nov. 30 whether to approve American 
Continental's bankruptcy plan after a vote by 25,000 creditors -- many of them 
bondholders -- who are owed more than $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
About 22,000 bondholders purchased $200 million in American Continental bonds 
at 29 Lincoln Savings branches in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix financier Charles H. Keating Jr. sought bankruptcy protection for the 
parent company and the subsidiaries on April 13, 1989 -- one day before 
government regulators seized Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L is expected to become one of the nation's costliest failures, with 
a taxpayer bill of $2 billion. Its collapse has been linked to risky junk bond 
investments and real estate projects -- many of which were undertaken by the 
subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
Since the government seized it, Lincoln has lost $1.3 billion, most of it 
attributed to write-downs that regulators contend Lincoln's owners should have 
made. 
</P>
<P>
The Lincoln Savings failure has also resulted in numerous criminal 
investigations and civil lawsuits. Keating is fighting securities fraud charges 
in Los Angeles stemming from the thrift's failure. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidiaries involved in Friday's court action developed some of Lincoln's 
better-known projects, including the $296-million luxury Phoenician Resort 
Hotel, the Crescent Hotel -- both located in Arizona -- and other residential 
and commercial developments in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, the subsidiaries have assets of $1.8 billion. They owe 
creditors more than $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
Among the creditors are contractors who worked on Lincoln Savings development 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
The American Continental plan calls for liquidation of the company within two 
years and payment to creditors of 21 cents for each dollar owed. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, both repayment plans would take effect in two months. At that 
point, the companies -- American Continental and the Lincoln subsidiaries -- 
would be freed from bankruptcy court control. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidiaries' reimbursement plan calls for an immediate payment of $62 
million to creditors from the subsidiaries' cash reserves. Contested claims 
represent another $60 million.

McCartney Brother Sues Larry Flynt: Singer Paul McCartney's brother, Michael, 
sued sex magazine publisher Larry Flynt's LFP Inc. and a Hollywood bookstore 
for alleged copyright infringement in the publication of an early photograph of 
the singer with fellow Beatles George Harrison and John Lennon. In the federal 
lawsuit against LFP and Book City, Michael McCartney, who penned a biography on 
his family and put together another book of Beatle photographs on which he 
claims to hold all rights, asserts that the defendants violated his copyright 
on the photo he took called "John, Paul, George and Dennis." 
</P>
<P>
The photograph was published by LFP last May in "Sh-Boom" magazine, which is 
distributed at the book store. The suit, which also alleges a violation of 
foreign moral rights, seeks unspecified damages. (Case No. 90-6099. Filed Nov. 
13).

Comptroller of the Currency Rebuts Critics: The top U.S. bank regulator 
dismissed criticism that his tough policies are pushing the nation into

said: "We have to maintain proper lending standards and proper supervisory 
standards to keep the banks in business. We can't afford to go back to 
pretending the problems don't exist."

A DREAM OF DEMOCRACY FOLLOWS THE NIGHTMARE

<P>
Far, far from home, Shen Tong writes on a computer in his office on a 
tree-lined street here. He is a biology student, but this passage was about 
China, for a speech that he would deliver to the Asia Society in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The land of Shen's birth is never far from his thoughts or from his dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"The story that I want to tell is the story that lies behind the closed door," 
he wrote in the preface to "Almost a Revolution," (co-written with journalist 
Marianne Yen and published this month by Houghton Mifflin) about his life and 
the events leading up to the massacre at Tian An Men Square on June 3, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"There is my childhood, the silent Changan Avenue that holds our history and 
our future. There is my family, that splendid earth and my people. There is my 
dream and my friends in prison who wait for that dream to come true. That dream 
belongs to the young, who love to imagine." 
</P>
<P>
Shen Tong was 20 years old, when he brought his dream of democracy to Tian An 
Men Square. He established the Dialogue Delegation that negotiated with 
government officials. From a wing of his dormitory at Beijing University, he 
ran the student news center. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting at his computer here, the Brandeis University student dreams still. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like an earthquake, change will come to China," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"The big earthquake will come, even if you try to stop the little ones." 
</P>
<P>
Shen became involved in Chinese student politics when he was 17. He arrived at 
Beijing University, known as Beida, and soon became an official in the Beida 
Student Assn. In early 1989, he established the Olympic Institute, an 
independent student organization that promoted discussion of new ideas about 
science, philosophy and, eventually, politics. 
</P>
<P>
Shen's dream of freedom for China was so powerful, he said, that he could never 
have been prepared for the nightmare that happened in Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't imagine the outcome," Shen said. 
</P>
<P>
From his home near Changan Avenue, Shen saw people cut down by tanks and felled 
by soldiers' bullets. Most were citizens and workers, not students. Horrified 
by what he was witnessing, Shen challenged a soldier, "Tell the other soldiers 
that they cannot shoot any more." 
</P>
<P>
In response, an officer got up and aimed a pistol at Shen's head. An uncle 
dragged Shen away. He heard firing and screaming and turned around to see the 
girl who had been standing next to him lying dead. 
</P>
<P>
Shen was not in Tian An Men Square during the turmoil. So while he doubts, he 
cannot challenge the Chinese government claim that no one was killed there. 
</P>
<P>
"Not a lot of people died in Tian An Men Square, but that is not the point," 
Shen said. "First of all, they were killing people and a lot of people did die. 
Not in the square but nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"I was one mile west of Tian An Men Square, and that turned out to be the No. 1 
most brutal killing field in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"People left the big cities. They went into hiding; some went into exile, like 
me. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot are still in China. They are in danger. The government keeps arresting 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Shen cites a well-publicized figure from Amnesty International, which has 
reported that 30,000 protesters were arrested following the democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
Shen's prominence in the demonstrations in Tian An Men Square made him a target 
for government retribution. Had he remained in China, he certainly would have 
faced imprisonment -- or worse. Naively, he admits now, he participated in 
anti-government activities with a kind of devil-may-care defiance. 
</P>
<P>
"I was even thinking, well, to put me in jail for a year is fine," Shen said. 
"I thought, 'It's a terrible thing. I'll be in jail, then they'll release me 
and I'll go back to college.' " 
</P>
<P>
But that was impossible. When the tanks turned on the people of Beijing on June 
3, Shen saw that he had no choice but to flee. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, Shen offers just two cryptic sentences about his escape. In 
person, too, he hesitates to describe details about how he came to board a 
Northwest Airlines flight from Tokyo to the United States. But he does not 
rebut a story attributed to him that his airline ticket out of Beijing was 
issued to him directly, without ever being recorded in the airline's computers, 
and that sympathetic customs agents were among those who shepherded him to 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people helped," is all he will say, including "quite high-ranking 
officials." 
</P>
<P>
His escape left him with mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt so guilty, especially for the close friends of mine who were working in 
the democracy movement," Shen said. "They are in jail, they cannot continue 
their studies, and some are dead." 
</P>
<P>
Shen also carries the burden of having left his family under trying 
circumstances. A week before the massacre, Shen's father, Shen Tiansen, was 
admitted to a hospital. His mother pleaded with Shen to pay a visit. But, "I 
didn't think anything was seriously wrong with him; my mother had told me he 
suffered from gallstones." 
</P>
<P>
While Shen Tiansen's condition worsened, his son's political activities 
continued to consume him. The afternoon of June 3, hours before the massacre, a 
friend of Shen Tong's sister told him Shen Tiansen had leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel anything," Shen Tong says now. "My mind was full of things in 
the square." 
</P>
<P>
Shen disguised himself just before he left China and sneaked in to visit his 
father at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"Get out of this country as fast as you can," his father told him. 
</P>
<P>
Shen Tong was traveling around the United States with several other Chinese 
students when he learned that his father had died. The news came in a letter 
from his sister's old boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Shen longed to return to China, but friends persuaded him it was too dangerous. 
"Almost a Revolution" is dedicated to Shen's father. 
</P>
<P>
Tall and slender, Shen has an impeccable command of English. His comfortable 
style of speaking and his intense commitment to his cause make Shen "a very 
special person," said Marshall Strauss, executive director of the Democracy for 
China Fund Inc. Shen, chairman of that organization, often disarms listeners by 
his mere appearance, Strauss said. 
</P>
<P>
"You forget he's only 22," said Strauss. 
</P>
<P>
Shen said he and other Chinese exiles remain in close contact with their 
colleagues in China, and that the spirit of cooperation with the dissidents 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
"The underground movement is very much alive," he said. On the one hand, he 
said, "the central government polices what is going on. There seems no chance 
you can take. But meanwhile, people are very sympathetic. Not just individuals, 
but people in government, lower government officials." 
</P>
<P>
Shen remains in contact "with people who worked with me, but who are not in 
jail." All sorts of information is exchanged, he said -- "people, their 
escapes, how many people are arrested by the government." This information is 
vital, Shen said, "because the government lies all the time." Shen also 
maintains "indirect" contact with his family in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
To return to China now would be so perilous as to be unthinkable. But as an 
exile there is a question as to how great his involvement and influence on his 
own country can be. 
</P>
<P>
Although he says his age may hinder his effectiveness ("In . . . the Chinese 
culture, you don't have much influence on the nation's politics when you are 
22"), there are things he can accomplish while living here. "There is so much 
we can do (as exiles) with cooperating with international organizations, and 
with lobbying to influence various governments' actions toward China." 
</P>
<P>
And exile does afford certain benefits, Shen said. 
</P>
<P>
"This exile life is a wonderful opportunity for us to learn democracy," he 
said. "It gives us the chance to see what kind of road, or means, China must 
take for democracy." 
</P>
<P>
When the democracy movement took force in spring, 1989, "we weren't ready," he 
said. "We need time for different factors to develop." 
</P>
<P>
The student movement will be instrumental in carrying China toward democracy, 
Shen predicted. "Definitely, the movement will continue," he said. "It is 
continuing; it is going on still." 
</P>
<P>
As the movement grows, he will certainly be part of it, Shen said. He will 
finish his degree in biology next year, then -- thanks largely to his 
activities in the last year and a half -- shift to political science for 
graduate school. He will speak out whenever possible. He will meet with 
government leaders from this country and from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
It is a perfect balance, Shen said, "quiet campus life" and his fervent 
political activities. He will probably go back to China, he said, and sooner, 
rather than later. But for now, said Shen "this country is teaching me great 
lessons."

<P>
At almost midnight, drug dealers still hover outside under the street lights, 
thick as mosquitoes, the cops a feeble hand waving to shoo them off. 
</P>
<P>
Inside his apartment at the John Hays Homes housing project, Mbanna Kantako 
cannot see them, but he knows they are there -- the dealers and the cops, the 
mosquitoes and the hand. They are always there. He speaks to them, whether or 
not they listen. 
</P>
<P>
 The people's choice. Zoom Black Magic Liberation Radio. Stereo 107 point 1 
F.M. 
</P>
<P>
 From a corner of his living room, he speaks every night, to them and to 
everyone else with a radio within a 1 1/2-mile radius. 
</P>
<P>
 We're in our 406th consecutive night of broadcasting . . . Mbanna Kantako with 
you until Wednesday morning sometime. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's listen to the news. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . The Israeli government has imposed their version of the South African 
government iron-fist policy . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Blind, black and 31, Kantako plays music, talks politics, criticizes "the 
system," denounces drugs and goads the police, favorite whipping boys. 
</P>
<P>
It's outrageous stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Scott Heron sang in a more militant era that "The Revolution Will Not Be 
Televised." He may have been right. But in Springfield you can tune it in every 
night on your radio dial. 
</P>
<P>
 The house Negro Colin Powell is in the Middle East talking to the troops now. 
Why did Colin Powell all of a sudden go to the Middle East? 
</P>
<P>
 Kantako has an answer, albeit a somewhat fanciful one. The way he sees it, the 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was trying to stop black servicemen from 
converting to Islam. 
</P>
<P>
With less than a watt of power, Kantako's unlicensed and brazenly illegal radio 
station seems an unlikely catalyst for revolution. Because of Springfield's 
segregated housing patterns, though, he says he covers three-quarters of the 
black community, about 11,000 people, along with most of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's an educational thing," he says of the broadcasts, which he has 
made into a family affair. His wife, Brenda, or one of his two children kicks 
off each evening's programming after dinner. They play highly politicized rap 
or reggae as a warm-up for Kantako, who takes to the air at 10 and sticks with 
it through early morning. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to build community," he says of the broadcasts. "We're really 
trying to raise the consciousness of the people." 
</P>
<P>
On uninspired nights, Kantako's on-air discussions lapse into unintentional 
self-parody, seeming almost like a skit from TV's "In Living Color." The host 
and a stable of regular political activist callers and guests from Springfield, 
Chicago and elsewhere discuss the news of the day in low-key fashion, 
punctuating everything with the obligatory accusations of government 
conspiracies and genocide. 
</P>
<P>
But Kantako and his supporters say his broadcasts are an important act of 
social protest, one which they hope to expand, by encouraging the development 
of other low-watt, unlicensed stations across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Townsend, a professor of social work at Sangamon State University in 
Springfield, helped create the station four years ago. He says they are 
challenging the Federal Communications Commission because they believe 
government regulations, which include capital funding requirements, 
discriminate against poor people and blacks and deny them access to the media. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a definite sociopolitical motive behind what we're trying to do, 
(which is) to find a way to empower low-income people," says Townsend. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who have provided some degree of moral support and advice are 
influential media theorists Noam Chomsky and Ben Bagdikian. 
</P>
<P>
Bagdikian, professor emeritus at the UC Berkeley School of Journalism, says he 
cannot wholeheartedly endorse Kantako's illegal station because it is "clearly 
civil disobedience" and "untenable in the long run. . . . I don't think there's 
any question that broadcasting has to be regulated," he says. "You have to have 
somebody who's a traffic cop." 
</P>
<P>
But he says the station was created in response to government policies that 
over the last 25 years have made it increasingly difficult for small low-power 
radio and television broadcasters to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"The field has been dominated by the big corporate operations" that ignore the 
concerns of non-white communities, he says. "They're all making money hand over 
fist and they're only interested in wide-market audience." 
</P>
<P>
Kantako has already been fined $750 by the FCC for operating without a license 
and told to shut down. He has refused to pay. If the FCC takes legal action to 
shut him down, he says he and his supporters will challenge the licensing 
requirement in court. 
</P>
<P>
James A. Lewis, an assistant U.S. attorney in Springfield, is responsible for 
collecting the fine. He says neither he nor the FCC has pursued the matter 
because Kantako -- who lives on Social Security disability payments -- has few 
resources, the fine is so small and the government has much bigger cases to 
handle. "It's a matter of proportion," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"What (Kantako) is doing is wrong," he says, "but it's not the worst wrong that 
goes on. I wish he wouldn't do it, but it's not drug crime or corruption." 
</P>
<P>
Also, he says, Kantako "likes to ignore you. So at this point I'm into leaving 
him alone until I think that it's time to examine his resources again." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kantako and Townsend have been contacting social activists in other 
cities and publicizing their activities in hopes of getting others interested 
in starting similar radio stations. They've created a how-to videotape in an 
effort to spawn a network of independent micro stations. 
</P>
<P>
So far, only one spinoff station has made it to the air, in Decatur, Ill. 
Townsend says he and Kantako are talking with several other people who may give 
it a try, but most of the people who contacted them have been "white yuppie 
types" who saw a story about Kantako in Playboy magazine and thought it would 
be fun to own a radio station. 
</P>
<P>
"It can't just be a lark," says Townsend, who is white. "This has to be 
something that becomes a part of your daily life and you have to be committed 
to it. You don't find those kinds of people every day." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Kantako's low wattage, his station has received coverage from national 
and international media including National Public Radio. 
</P>
<P>
One NPR story played a portion of a Kantako broadcast that captured him at his 
most compelling. 
</P>
<P>
A domestic dispute at a nearby housing project in March, 1989, turned into a 
hostage situation when the police arrived. After a two-day standoff, shooting 
erupted. When it stopped, two residents were dead. 
</P>
<P>
Kantako was on the scene, broadcasting the pandemonium, describing the action 
with the help of friends who whispered to him what they saw. In later 
interviews with people who said they witnessed the police action, Kantako 
called into question the official version of events. 
</P>
<P>
He made no attempt to be even-handed. He reports from what he considers "the 
people's" perspective. Nevertheless, it was chilling stuff, both because of the 
immediacy of the broadcast and Kantako's crusading, adversarial stance. 
</P>
<P>
After the shootings, his broadcasts, originally less political, began to deal 
more and more with issues of alleged police brutality. And soon the Springfield 
police chief, citing complaints about profanity on the air, called in the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
Kantako was cited for operating without a license and went off the air for 
about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he called a press conference to announce his reappearance. In a hilarious 
bit of political theater, Townsend videotaped Kantako's efforts to get himself 
arrested. When the police wouldn't take him into custody for operating his 
station without a license, he and a group of supporters went to the courthouse 
in Springfield where they also were turned away. 
</P>
<P>
Humor is very much a part of Kantako's performance. One night he showed a 
visitor his "farm animals" tape -- "90 minutes of barnyard pigs" -- which he 
sometimes plays to heckle the police. Sometimes he intercuts the tape with live 
broadcasts off a police scanner to "translate" the pigs' oinking. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the national and international attention he has received, he says he is 
largely ignored by the local political Establishment. He says the city's 
mainstream black leaders "hate my guts. . . . They haven't been supportive at 
all of the station or the concept." And the black press, Kantako says, "has 
never uttered a word about us." 
</P>
<P>
Reaction from residents of the projects and nearby is mixed. Sarah Horton says 
she listens, but complains that on her car radio reception is good only within 
a three- or four-block radius. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the music," she says. As for the political talk: "To be honest, he can 
keep that for himself." 
</P>
<P>
Partially blinded by glaucoma as a child, Kantako (whose name then was Dewayne 
Readus) spent his youth in state schools and did well in that protected 
environment. But after he graduated and returned to the projects he began using 
drugs and getting into minor trouble with the police. 
</P>
<P>
The radio station was born four years ago. Kantako and Townsend met through 
Kantako's sister, who then was president of the housing project's tenant 
organization. The two men hit it off and Townsend asked Kantako to help him 
publish an alternative newspaper. Kantako, who had once made extra money by 
performing as a disc jockey at parties, thought a radio station was more 
practical. They used a $600 grant from the Catholic Church's Campaign for Human 
Development to buy the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the radio station, the two men work on a summer education 
program for youth and are setting up a library in the drug-infested housing 
project. Everything is paid for through donations. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognized fairly early on that we were on to something special here," 
Townsend says of the radio station. 
</P>
<P>
"And we knew that if we could do it -- we knew nothing about electronics -- we 
knew that just about anybody could."

DRIVING A WEDGE IN SAUDI SAND; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: THE MIDEAST NATION'S GOVERNMENT MAY THINK WOMEN NEED TO BE KEPT OFF 
THE ROADS, BUT AMERICAN FEMINISTS DON'T. AND ALL JOKES ASIDE, THEY'RE PROUD OF 
THEIR HARD-DRIVIN' SAUDI SISTERS.

<P>
America's first woman driver was Genevra Delphine Mudge. 
</P>
<P>
She drove a Locomobile in New York City in 1899, skidded on a patch of snow and 
knocked down five pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
In the near-century since, chauvinists have made sure the reputation of women 
at the wheel has remained in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
Now the government of Saudi Arabia, responding to religious conservatives, has 
said women motorists are "portents of evil" who will be banned from driving. 
</P>
<P>
And a hundred drive-time disc jockeys, several dozen stand-up comedians and 
most late-night monologists are poised to ask if we've heard the one about the 
Saudi woman who hopped into her Mercedes, turned left leaving Riyadh and 
collided with Yemen. She was later cited for driving under the influence of 
Western women. 
</P>
<P>
To some veterans of the feminist wars, the issue may provide another somber 
moment for boycotts and marches, protests and padlocks. For other women, 
however, it is a time of levity -- and revenge for jokes about women drivers 
that began the day Genevra Delphine Mudge arrived at traffic school. 
</P>
<P>
"There are going to be many terrible jokes on late-night shows about women 
drivers, all based on untrue stereotypes," said feminist attorney Gloria 
Allred. "That's the problem. Whenever women try to win their rights, it is 
trivialized and people laugh at it as though it is a joke." 
</P>
<P>
In truth, she continued, the Saudi ruling has nothing to do with traffic 
safety. Or the abilities and inabilities of Saudi women drivers. It has 
everything to do, she said, with Saudi subordination of women and a new extreme 
in discrimination that amounts to gender apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
And that was the precise, furious thrust of a letter of protest that Allred, as 
president of the Women's Equal Rights Legal Defense and Education Fund, 
delivered Friday to the Saudi Arabian Consulate here. She drove to the 
consulate, of course. Earlier, there was an interview by car phone. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm sitting here on the freeway not moving, let alone driving," she said. 
Then a thought occurred: "At this point, I'm not going to say it wouldn't be a 
bad idea if men weren't driving. Then I could just breeze right along here." 
</P>
<P>
So even for Allred, there is a little lightness in the Saudi situation -- a ban 
that has led to demonstration drive-ins, job suspensions for women who 
participated in the protests, and government threats of "appropriate 
punishment" for defiant drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Denise McCluggage, of Santa Fe, N.M., has raced and rallied cars in Europe and 
the United States, and is a columnist for AutoWeek and Glamour magazines. 
Tongue in cheek, she has decided on an "appropriate punishment" for the errant 
Saudi women drivers. "She'd have to change a flat tire that some guy has put on 
with a jackhammer," McCluggage said. 
</P>
<P>
That, she continued, isn't the only foible of macho motoring: "Men assume they 
know everything about driving. Women are teachable and are aware that they 
don't know everything about driving. 
</P>
<P>
"And the reason they don't know much about driving is because men taught them 
how to drive. Therefore, they can't know much because men don't know much." 
</P>
<P>
But Betty Friedan, author of "The Feminine Mystique" and America's first 
feminist, is not amused. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very proud of the Saudi women who staged that protest and insisted on 
their right to move," she said from New York. "Let them find new ways of 
fighting their authoritarian oppressors. 
</P>
<P>
"But don't put any funniness stuff in my mouth. OK? Bye-bye." 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood's 250-miles-per-hour Shirley Muldowney, the only woman to win 
world drag-racing titles, thinks focusing international attention on one small 
problem of Arab women will have the positive result of "bringing the situation 
to light . . . and if you fight long enough for anything, you will make headway 
and you're bound to win." 
</P>
<P>
Muldowney has her own solution to the crisis in the Persian Gulf: "Although I 
probably wouldn't go over very big over there . . . I'd love to take Hussein 
for a drive. I'd give him a ride he'd never forget. He'd more than blink. He'd 
say uncle." 
</P>
<P>
Jean Lindamood, executive editor of Michigan-based Automobile magazine, thinks 
that as the world shrinks and influences spread, cultural insulation will 
weaken in nations like Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people from all over the world passing through these countries, 
staying there, being there, and they will be the ruination of the Saudi 
culture," she said. "Thank God." 
</P>
<P>
Lindamood derives much satisfaction from America's military presence in Saudi 
Arabia, where "our women are guarding their country," she said. "That must 
drive 'em berserk, just nuts."

Are women better drivers than men? 
</P>
<P>
Well, a recent Los Angeles Times computer analysis of the driving records of 
179,000 Californians indicated that women generally are much safer drivers than 
men their age. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen-year-old girls had a ticket rate lower than boys their age. Although 
the worst drivers were 18-year-olds of both sexes, women tended to have fewer 
accidents than men at other age levels. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly portents of evil. 
</P>
<P>
Except to Jon Winokur of Pacific Palisades, author of "The Portable 
Curmudgeon," "A Curmudgeon's Garden of Love" and clearly California's reigning 
grouch. 
</P>
<P>
"Portents of evil? Portents? They already are," he grumbled. "Only last week, 
on Olympic in West Los Angeles, I saw a woman driving while talking on the 
telephone and putting on her makeup. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a quinella I've not see before. I can only presume she was driving with 
her knees." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back at the record books. 
</P>
<P>
They list one English woman who passed a driving test after 40 attempts, but 
had spent so much money on driving lessons she couldn't afford a car. Then 
there was the Arkansas lady who passed her written test after 104 tries. 
</P>
<P>
But hold the chortles. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the world's worst driver is a 
Texan who in 1966 received 10 tickets, drove on the wrong side of the road four 
times, was involved in four hit-and-runs and caused six other accidents within 
20 minutes. 
</P>

MURDER CAPS RISING GANG VIOLENCE IN SOUTH COUNTY

<P>
A night of taunting between rival gang members at a restaurant ended Sunday 
when a 26-year-old man was gunned down in the parking lot -- the first homicide 
here in five years and the city's first-ever gang slaying, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Roman C. Calvillo, 26, was shot in the head and stomach at 1:30 a.m. outside 
the Great Wall, a Chinese restaurant and nightclub, Police Sgt. James Thomas 
said. Friends rushed Calvillo to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead on 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
The slaying underscores a growing gang problem in affluent South County, where 
officials this year launched a gang prevention task force. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente Mayor Candace Haggard said Sunday: "This is totally unacceptable. 
The cities in South County have been trying to get a handle on the gang problem 
here. This is a terrible thing, and we must do everything in our power to drive 
gangs out." 
</P>
<P>
Calvillo, a member of a San Clemente gang, was apparently killed by a member of 
a San Juan Capistrano gang, Thomas said. The same gangs, which have been 
enemies for several years, were involved in the drive-by shooting last 
Christmas Eve in which a 4-year-old girl was shot in the face and upper body as 
she played on the porch of a neighbor's apartment in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
The rivalry between the two South County gangs has intensified recently because 
of their battle over territory, said Thomas, head of the Police Department's 
gang investigation division. 
</P>
<P>
Calvillo and about five friends had gone to the Great Wall, located in the Pico 
Plaza shopping center on Calle de Industrias, at about 9:30 p.m. Saturday to 
listen to a band, Police Sgt. Russ Moore said. Shortly after, a group of 10 men 
arrived and were seated nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"The two groups promptly began to exchange rude remarks and gang gestures," 
Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
The exchanges continued throughout the night, he said. Then at 1:30 a.m., the 
taunts escalated and the two sides began flinging beer bottles, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
At least 50 customers were still in the restaurant, and several of them saw a 
member of the San Juan Capistrano group pull out a handgun and point it at 
Calvillo and his friends, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Calvillo then ran out of the restaurant, police said. The gunman followed and 
shot Calvillo in the parking lot. Police said the killer and his companions 
fled in a dark-brown Chevrolet van. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman was described as a slender, 20-year-old Latino, 5 feet, 6 inches 
tall, with slicked-back black hair. The van's driver was described as a husky, 
20-year-old Latino with a full beard. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the night, the taunts kept going back and forth, and the last straw 
was this bottle fight," Thomas said. "The bottle-throwing triggered something 
between the gunman and Calvillo. Something like this always starts off minor, 
and it ends up to be something major like homicide." 
</P>
<P>
Calvillo's friends drove him to Samaritan Medical Center-San Clemente but left 
before police got there. Police said Calvillo is survived by three brothers, 
all of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
At the Great Wall on Sunday morning, there was little evidence of a brawl. A 
few cans and bottles of beer littered the bar. In an adjacent and dim dining 
area, tables were ready for the 11:30 lunch trade. 
</P>
<P>
At the shopping center, which includes fast-food restaurants, a 24-hour market 
and a drugstore, workers had already heard of the shooting. Until now, the 
center had remained untouched by the increasing gang crime that had hit the 
West Escalones and West Canada sections of the city, shop owners said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised," said Eileen Ream, a shopper who has lived in San Clemente for 
25 years. "We have such a nice city. It's ridiculous. But I guess it can happen 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Allen, 36, of Dana Point said he remembers growing up in San Clemente 
when it was a "quiet retirement town: only the Marines, the retired people and 
a handful of us kids. There was never any violence. Robbery was nil." 
</P>
<P>
The shooting was the second major gang-related incident in the city this month. 
Last weekend, Antonio Ramires, 20, of San Juan Capistrano was stabbed several 
times in the back and legs after he argued with a man in a back alley, police 
said. Police arrested Lorenzo Hurtado, 20, for the assault. Thomas said that 
the incident was gang-related but that investigators have not determined 
whether Calvillo's death was connected to it. 
</P>
<P>
In the Christmas Eve incident, Floyd Avery, 19, a member of the San Juan 
Capistrano gang, and his friends made three attempts to shoot rival gang 
members. In their second attempt, 4-year-old Prisca Caudillo was wounded by 
gunfire but recovered. In September, Avery pleaded guilty in the case to 
assault with a deadly weapon after a jury failed to reach a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
That incident marked a violent turn in South County's gang problem. Area cities 
banded together in the Gang Awareness Prevention Task Force, which was launched 
after a string of gang-related crimes. "For two years, the use of firearms and 
knives was unheard of in South County," said Police Sgt. Richard Downing, who 
is investigating the Calvillo murder. "Then with the Christmas Eve incident, 
more and more gang members are carrying weapons and using them." 
</P>
<P>
Residents in South County have also reported an increase in gang graffiti on 
bus benches and gated community walls. In Mission Viejo, a 24-hour hot line was 
established for residents to report "graffiti sightings."

MEANWHILE, AT HOME: Obscured for the moment by the "Keating Five" hearings in 
Washington (D2), state prosecutors today will restore part of the securities 
fraud indictment against Charles H. Keating Jr., former owner of failed Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine. . . . An L.A. judge set aside 22 counts earlier 
this month, the only bright spot so far for Keating. But prosecutors plan to 
restore those and add several more accusations of lying to state officials.

ANTI-ABORTION COALITION FORMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIK HAMILTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new anti-abortion coalition at Cal State Fullerton hopes to generate debate 
among students by holding weekly meetings and other activities, which already 
have drawn speakers such as Archbishop Roger Mahoney and Rep. William E. 
Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton). 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping that by forming Students for Life Coalition, we can fight to defend 
a basic human right -- the right to life," said Kevin La Point, a 21-year-old 
psychology major who helped establish the group. 
</P>
<P>
La Point believes a valuable lesson can be learned from the 1960s, when protest 
and change was in the air, and the students became one of the single most 
powerful movements during that decade. 
</P>
<P>
"College students can make a difference," La Point said. "They can force change 
when organized." 
</P>
<P>
Abortion-rights advocates already have numerous organizations on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on our membership, I'm encouraged by student interest," he said, adding 
that he hopes the coalition spreads to other campuses in the area. About 40 
people have joined the organization. 
</P>
<P>
La Point launched the coalition in September, believing there had to be people 
on campus who shared his views. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, abortion is no different in importance as issues of racism, sexism or a 
government's domestic or foreign policies," he said. "I recognize that a lot of 
people have differing views, but we still have a right to express our 
differences." 
</P>
<P>
La Point said the coalition, in addition to holding meetings and attracting 
speakers, hopes to educate students who are undecided about the abortion issue 
and to encourage student participation in anti-abortion politics. 
</P>
<P>
Still, La Point distances the coalition from such anti-abortion groups as 
Operation Rescue, which use civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't advocate breaking the law," La Point said. "All our activities are 
legal and nonviolent. This organization does not support other pro-life groups 
which encourage violent, illegal or socially disruptive behavior." ERIK

SADDLEBACK TRUSTEE AREAS TO BE REDRAWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saddleback Community College District officials will soon redraw boundaries for 
the district's seven trustee areas to account for southward population shifts. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Richard Sneed said the boundaries should be redrawn by February, 
alleviating imbalances in which some trustees represent 24% or more of the 
district's 583,400 residents, while others represent less than 7%. 
</P>
<P>
A higher percentage of residents now live in the southern third of the district 
compared to 10 years ago, Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a plan that we presented recently that had a distribution of 11% up to 
17% (of the residents) within the areas," he said. "But we have taken that back 
because we think we can draw areas that will be even closer in population, 
close to even." 
</P>
<P>
When the current lines were drawn in the early 1980s, the trustee areas held 
roughly equal populations, Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
But now, the areas range in their percentage of the district's population from 
the 31.1% who live in Area 6, which is primarily in Irvine and is represented 
by Robert L. Moore, to the 5.3% who live in Area 2, which includes Tustin and 
is represented by Joan J. Hueter. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they have to try to balance the areas," Hueter said. "Obviously if you 
live in a larger area, there is more of a chance that somebody will try to run 
against you. In a smaller area, chances are you'll run unopposed." 
</P>
<P>
While the trustees must live in the areas they represent, they are elected from 
a districtwide ballot. Sneed said there are no plans to change this system. 
</P>
<P>
The advantage of the system is that all communities within the district are 
represented, while the district's overall welfare takes precedence over local 
concerns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Without designated trustee areas, he said, one community might have two or 
three board members, while another has none. 
</P>
<P>
Election by voters within a single area would start pitting "my area versus 
your area," Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
The new boundaries are being drawn carefully so that current board members 
won't have to run against each other in the next election, he said, adding, 
"there would be no sense in disturbing anyone's incumbency." TERRY SPENCER

ADULT EDUCATION IS BOOMING AT COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A record number of students have enrolled in continuing education classes 
offered by Rancho Santiago College this fall, making the program one of the 
largest of its kind in the state, campus officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The wide array of classes, which are not for college credit, include seven 
levels of courses in English as a second language, parenting classes, 
vocational training, literacy classes, high school subjects for those wanting 
to earn their diploma, and citizenship classes for immigrants who have applied 
for amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment in these courses has jumped to 15,232 students, almost 1,500 more 
than were enrolled last year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
This increase is consistent with growth patterns during the last five years 
that have seen enrollment in the classes more than double, said Jan Parks, dean 
of continuing education for the Santa Ana area. 
</P>
<P>
"Our demographics are very similar to those of the Santa Ana Unified School 
District," Parks said. "When they have a tremendous increase in students, which 
they have had in recent years, we have a tremendous increase because we get 
many of the parents of the new children." 
</P>
<P>
About 75% of the students enrolled in the classes are Latino, 15% are Southeast 
Asian and the remaining 10% are split among other ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
The classes are taught at more than 100 locations throughout Santa Ana and 
Orange, including elementary schools, community centers and the program's two 
administrative headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
There are 350 part-time faculty members working in the Santa Ana area and 160 
working in the Orange area. About 40 faculty members teach courses at the 
Orange County Jail and the county's other correctional facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Funding provided by the federal government for amnesty classes has helped the 
program expand. But Parks said that federal aid is decreasing and that soon 
there will be fewer classes available in the already overcrowded program. 
</P>
<P>
"There is such a large need for these types of programs in this area, and 
unfortunately, we have to turn people away all the time. But those who are 
persistent and really dedicated usually end up with a spot," Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
Many students originally enroll for 40 hours of amnesty classes and, after they 
complete them, are eager to enroll in other classes, Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the most exciting and rewarding areas to be working in because 
what you do has such significant and immediate effect on the lives of people," 
Parks said. "You are giving them tools to lead a quality life." GREG HERNANDEZ

EDUCATION PROGRAM TURNS LIVES AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Four years ago, while working as a waitress at a local Denny's, 26-year-old 
Maureen McKennon had a baby. With the arrival of her son, Cody, she decided to 
make a few changes in her life. 
</P>
<P>
"My last year of school had been eighth grade," McKennon explained. "But when I 
had a baby, I decided that I should take things more seriously. . . . I'd been 
a waitress since 15, and I don't really want to do it forever." 
</P>
<P>
So McKennon approached Coastline Community College. She enrolled in her first 
class three years ago and was simultaneously accepted into the Extended 
Opportunity Program and Service project. EOPS is a statewide program that 
provides counseling, tutoring and career placement for economically and 
educationally disadvantaged students. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, McKennon's confidence has grown to the point that this fall she was 
selected -- along with 19-year-old Coastline student Brandy Ostrom -- to attend 
a statewide student leadership conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I would have been as successful if I hadn't been in EOPS," 
McKennon said, explaining that her counselor, program coordinator Ruth Dills, 
was supportive from the beginning. "I was really afraid to go back to school . 
. . but she was my cheerleader all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Dills said that the participation of two Coastline EOPS students in the state 
conference next week in San Diego is a real boon for the Coastline program, one 
of the smallest in the state. Golden West College serves 400 students through 
its EOPS program, while Orange Coast College has more than 600 participants, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first year that I've been able to send students to the 
conference," Dills said. "And they are participating in the very first class 
that (Coastline) has ever had in college leadership skills." 
</P>
<P>
Both McKennon and Ostrom are enrolled in the leadership skills class taught by 
Jim Garmon, dean of student services. Among the topics covered in the class are 
public speaking, parliamentary process and the responsibilities of leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was going to work the rest of my life at Taco Bell or something," 
said Ostrom, who, like McKennon, is a single mother without a high school 
degree. "As far as the leadership class goes, I think it's wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a real problem with public speaking, but if I want to be a lawyer, I 
better get used to it." 
</P>
<P>
Ostrom plans to attend law school after earning her degree next fall. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dills, the two days of workshops at the state conference should 
round out some of the skills that McKennon and Ostrom have learned in the 
classroom situation. 
</P>
<P>
McKennon said that some of what she has learned is already applicable to her 
life. She has taken an active role in activities at her son's preschool. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been getting skills in the student leadership class, so I don't feel so 
stupid anymore," she said. "Now I have to interact with people that have their 
master's program or Ph.D.s. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, I never would have gotten involved. I would have been one of those 
parents who just throws birthday parties." LAURA MICHAELIS

CHURCH MARKET OFFERS GIFT CHOICES WITH POOR IN MIND 
</P>

GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People at an outdoor church market on Sunday shopped busily for Christmas gifts 
-- such as cows, bricks and toilets. 
</P>
<P>
Some bought shelter for a homeless family and bus fare for an unemployed father 
to interview for a job. 
</P>
<P>
These unusual gifts were offered at the Garden Grove United Methodist Church's 
Alternative Christmas Giving Market. Holiday shoppers had the chance to buy 
specific items for the poor and to make the donations in the name of someone as 
a Christmas gift. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the sixth year our church has done this," said Hannah Lafler, who is 
in charge of the alternative-giving program. "Last year we raised $9,500 for 
the various groups." 
</P>
<P>
She and other volunteers at the church at 12741 Main St. said many people like 
the idea of giving things to the poor in the name of someone being remembered 
at Christmas. The church workers said the gifts go to the poor in Orange County 
and to poverty-stricken countries around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
Items for the poor in Orange County included donations to the YWCA Hotel for 
Women. A $15 donation would buy one night of shelter for a homeless woman. A 
shopper could buy 10 bricks for $10, and those bricks would be used by Habitat 
for Humanity in constructing housing for Orange County homeless. A $50 donation 
would buy and install a toilet in such housing. 
</P>
<P>
For poor people in Haiti, Ecuador, Ghana and other Third World nations, 
shoppers could buy livestock from Heifer Project International, a non-sectarian 
charity based in Little Rock, Ark. For a $1 donation, for instance, a person 
could buy a live chicken that would be sent to a poor family in a Third World 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"The poor families can use the chickens to produce eggs," said Tom Quental, a 
church volunteer at the Heifer Project International booth. "They can use the 
eggs for food, and they can barter the eggs for other things they need." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the gifts come with cards for the person in whose name the gift was 
purchased. 
</P>
<P>
Quental's booth proved to be popular with children. Several live animals 
surrounded the booth: a baby pig, a rabbit, a calf and some chickens. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids like to come see these animals," said Quental, whose own three small 
children were in the crowd of sightseers. 
</P>
<P>
Lafler, the head of the program, said the outdoor booths were a one-day event. 
But alternative-giving donations will be taken every Sunday between now and 
Christmas after each service at the church. Anyone wanting more information may 
call her at home in Anaheim at (714) 991-5558.

RAMS PROVE PANACEA FOR AIKMAN, WHO HAS BEST GAME OF SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
NFL: SOFT ZONE DEFENSE HAS SOOTHING EFFECT ON FORMER UCLA STANDOUT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The quarterback wanted to put it up more. The coaches told him to shut up more. 
Heck, there were lots of discouraging words being heard at home on the Dallas 
Cowboys' range last week. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Aikman, the former UCLA standout, was complaining to anyone who would 
listen that the Cowboy offense was too conservative. He wanted to throw some 
long passes. The Dallas coaching staff thought Aikman was spending too much 
time talking to the media and yelling at receivers. They suggested he quit 
whining and start winning. 
</P>
<P>
But just when the Cowboys were teetering on the verge of self-destruction, they 
ran into the Rams, the NFL's favorite panacea for quarterbacks who are 
suffering from flagging confidence. It's a sports psychologist's dream: "Take a 
game with the Rams and call me in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning, the Cowboys, who hadn't scored a touchdown in November, were a 
clubhouse brawl waiting to happen. Sunday afternoon, they were all but singing 
a country-Western version of "We Are Family." 
</P>
<P>
Aikman completed 17 of 32 passes for 303 yards and three touchdowns as the 
Cowboys defeated the Rams, 24-21. It was by far his best game of the season, 
surpassing his previous best by more than 50 yards. It also was the first time 
he had thrown for more than one touchdown in a game this year. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Aikman is one of those quarterbacks who can testify to the soothing 
effects of the Rams' soft zone defense. He's thrown only 17 touchdown passes in 
his NFL career, but seven of them have come at the expense of the Ram 
secondary. Sunday, he even got that long pass he wanted, a 61-yarder to wide 
receiver Michael Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally aired it out today," a jubilant Irvin said. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson and offensive coordinator David Shula maintained 
that the game plan didn't change, however, just the opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been throwing it long, but we haven't had people open," Johnson said. 
"It's the same offense we've been running all year. We tried to mix it up, 
tried to throw some on first down and run on second down. But they were the 
same plays we've run all year." 
</P>
<P>
Shula said it was just a matter of taking what's available, and with the Rams, 
that's often a long pass. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we had some advantages, personnelwise, over their defensive backs and 
thought we could throw it up to Michael (Irvin) and have a good measure of 
success, and it happened that way. It wasn't new plays or anything like that. 
It was just something we saw in their defense that we could take advantage of." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Aikman would like to point out that he never said the Cowboys 
didn't have enough passing plays. He said they didn't call enough passing 
plays. But Sunday afternoon, with Ram defensive backs so often sprawled face 
down as if they were grazing on the Anaheim Stadium turf, Shula couldn't resist 
the temptation to grab huge chunks of yardage through the air. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say we took more shots than we've taken in weeks past," Aikman 
said. "We didn't necessarily change what we were doing, we just did a lot more 
of it. And I think it was good. It kept them from really zeroing in on us." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't always look as if it would be a Sunday stroll through the ballpark 
for Aikman. On the third play of the game, he tried to force the ball through 
three Ram defenders and Vince Newsome intercepted the pass and returned it 11 
yards to the Dallas 36-yard line. Five plays later, the Rams led, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a very tough week," Aikman said. "All of this has been a distraction 
coming into the game. I think a lot of things that have been written and said 
this week caused me to press a little bit early in the ballgame. I was trying 
too hard there early. I didn't feel like I was throwing the ball well early in 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he awarded Aikman with a game ball, not so much for his 
outstanding performance as for his resiliency. "He started off shaky," Johnson 
said, "but he responded and played fantastically in the last three quarters." 
</P>
<P>
Shula, too, was monitoring the emotional status of the Cowboys' sometimes 
volatile quarterback. He couldn't see the look in Aikman's eye from his vantage 
point in the press box, but he kept a long-distance relationship via the 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very tough times for everybody involved with the offense," Shula 
said. "Then we started out with the interception. I'm very happy and proud of 
the way he hung in tough and kept throwing. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked on the phone after the first series and I said, 'Hey, how are you 
doing?' He said, 'I'm doing fine. I'll get into a rhythm and then I won't have 
any problems.' " 
</P>
<P>
As predictions go, that one was right on target, like most of Aikman's passes. 
The Cowboys doubled their first-down output of last week -- nine against the 
San Francisco 49ers -- and picked up 12 of them passing. 
</P>
<P>
"I never questioned our ability to make this offense work," Aikman said, "and I 
hope the team never has. I'm not out to prove anyone wrong. It was just a 
matter of us executing better. We were able to get touchdowns when we were 
inside the 20. That was the biggest difference in this game." 
</P>
<P>
By schedule-makers' quirk, after 10 games, seven losses, and countless 
re-examinations of their 1990 course, the Rams will finally get a shot at their 
nemesis, the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
If they win Sunday, the Rams will be only six games behind the 49ers, who are 
10-0 and looking as if they might never lose again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great opponent for us to go in there and try to put together a good 
football game," defensive end Doug Reed said. "Hey, if we can't get up for that 
team, maybe it signifies that we just can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Said quarterback Jim Everett: "It's a chance for us to regain some of our 
pride, to come together against the best and play good football."

STARTING OVER AT UC IRVINE;

<P>
BASKETBALL: AFTER AN EMBARRASSING FINISH LAST YEAR, THE MEN'S TEAM IS EAGER TO 
MAKE AMENDS.

The players have run and run, and the coach has worked harder than ever before 
in 35 years of coaching, he says. 
</P>
<P>
But the weight of a terrible season can never be shed until another season 
takes its place, and that is why Bill Mulligan needs this one to begin. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time I ever finished a season and wanted to start back a week 
later," said Mulligan whose UC Irvine team went 5-23 last year, setting a 
school record with 15 losses in a row and finishing with the worst record in 
the school's history. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the players felt the same. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the season ended and we were 0-0 again, I looked forward to starting 
again," said forward Jeff Herdman. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan didn't even particularly want a break. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually you want to take time off, but we want to get in and go so we can 
redeem ourselves," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
The urge to go took a different form in some of his players. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Butler, the Anteaters' 6-foot-7 senior center and top player, considered 
transferring. So did Dylan Rigdon, the freshman who hit seven of seven 
three-pointers in a victory over Cal State Fullerton last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy I stayed. I want to play, and we've brought in some good players," 
Rigdon said. He had several meetings with Mulligan, who was trying to be sure 
the future of his program didn't walk away. 
</P>
<P>
After last season, Mulligan, 60, was given a one-year contract extension, 
through the end of the 1991-92 season. It was a way of easing the pressure of 
this season, but it is no long-term commitment, even though Mulligan was 
conference coach of the year five seasons ago, when the Anteaters beat Nevada 
Las Vegas twice. 
</P>
<P>
Rigdon stayed, as did the other two freshmen -- Jeff Von Lutzow and Craig 
Marshall -- who keyed a late-season surge in which the Anteaters won three of 
their final six games. 
</P>
<P>
While Rigdon was deciding, Butler says he also was weighing his options. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to stick around in the spring, when (Mulligan) told me what he 
thought I could do this year," said Butler, who has lost 25 pounds since last 
season. "I tried to get in the best shape possible to have a chance to play 
after college." 
</P>
<P>
But for a while it was touch and go. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you going to do, Dylan?" Butler would ask. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, what are you going to do?" Rigdon said. "It would help me decide 
if I knew what you were doing." 
</P>
<P>
But here they are, back to try to improve the record that threatens to diminish 
Mulligan's reputation as a proven winner in the later years of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to do it for him," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
There is little doubt that Irvine will be better -- new players such as guards 
Gerald McDonald and David Hollaway and forward Cornelius Banks seem to ensure 
that. But with a schedule that begins Friday against UCLA in the Great Alaska 
Shootout in Anchorage, and includes games against Maryland, Stanford and 
California, it is not certain how much the record will reflect the improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, Rigdon, Von Lutzow and Herdman will begin the season as returning 
starters. 
</P>
<P>
The most crucial player to the team's success, though, is probably point guard 
McDonald, who will handle the reins of the fast break, the run-and-Mulligan 
style this team is committed to for the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
In the Anteaters' first exhibition game, McDonald jumped center against a 6-9 
player -- and won. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan and the Anteaters can only hope he can deliver such feats all season. 
</P>
<P>
A closer look at the team: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GUARD 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, a Compton College transfer, is capable of injecting speed into an 
Irvine fast break that at times has been more broken than fast. "He's a jet," 
Butler said. He replaces the only lost starter, Rod Palmer. The pace of 
Irvine's games will mean McDonald will commit turnovers, but he has had more 
than Mulligan would like in preseason exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
Rigdon is the off guard, and has the most defined role on the team: Keep 
shooting. He made 41% of his shots last season and 27 of 65 three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
David Hollaway, a transfer from West L.A. College, gives the team another man 
capable of playing the point or shooting guard, and Marshall, who started 15 
games last season, can play guard or forward. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FORWARD 
</P>
<P>
Herdman, the only senior other than Butler, lost his touch last year, making 
only 38% of his shots and falling out of the starting five. The previous year, 
he had been one of the nation's leaders in three-point percentage. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't change anything last year," Herdman said. "It wasn't a matter of my 
shot, just my concentration level." 
</P>
<P>
Von Lutzow, by contrast, shot 56% as a freshman last season. This season, he 
replaced Marshall, a swingman, in the starting lineup between the first and 
second exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
Other players in the mix at forward, the team's deepest position, include 
Banks, juniors Don May and Elgin Rogers, former El Toro High player Khari 
Johnson and freshman Gabe Higa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CENTER 
</P>
<P>
Butler is prepared to be the player he was predicted to be out of Ocean View 
High School. The weight loss makes him better suited to the running game, and 
more confident, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a big-time player," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson can also play behind Butler, and freshmen Rick Swanwick, who redshirted 
last season, and Dan Augilis will be backups at the position as well. 
</P>
<P>
Butler is out to prove himself and improve the team's record. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-three losses," Butler said. "Wow."

TITANS BRACING FOR TOUGH YEAR; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: INJURIES ABOUND, AND SEASON HASN'T EVEN STARTED. BUT TEAM WILL HAVE 
NO TROUBLE LIVING UP TO EXPECTATIONS.

FULLERTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton basketball Coach John Sneed was expecting a rebuilding 
season -- not a rebuilding preseason. 
</P>
<P>
But with the 1990-91 opener at Lamar still a week away, the Titans have been 
hit by a wave of injuries and ailments that makes football Coach Gene Murphy's 
tattered troops look like Team Health. 
</P>
<P>
Junior point guard Wayne Williams, the team's only returning full-time starter, 
missed four days of practice in October after doctors detected a heart murmur 
during a preseason physical. Williams was cleared to play but has been slowed 
by a bone chip in his ankle, which sidelined him for a few days last week. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Bruce Bowen, who is challenging J.D. Green for the starting small 
forward position, missed a week of practice after undergoing surgery to have a 
small polyp removed from the back of his throat. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Ron Caldwell and junior Agee Ward, probable starters at center and power 
forward, have missed some practice time because of the flu. Freshman Greg 
Vernon, expected to be the second guard off the bench, has been out twice 
because of a bad back. 
</P>
<P>
Backup point guard Dareck Crane, a senior, is playing with tendinitis in his 
knee, and freshman guard Marcus Bell had tonsillitis last week. 
</P>
<P>
Even Sneed hasn't escaped the injury bug. The third-year coach was limping 
around last week when an old knee injury flared up. 
</P>
<P>
"We have that training room full at 3 p.m. every day," Sneed said. "It's 
amazing that all these things are happening. I'm just thankful they're 
happening now and not during the season. Maybe we've got it out of our system." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the problems, Sneed is pleased with his team's progress. Things have 
just gone a little slower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
"I've conditioned myself as a coach to take things a little slower this year," 
Sneed said. "I have to have a fair realization of where we're at and why. I 
have to be more patient." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans' nonconference schedule could offer a reprieve. Of Fullerton's nine 
nonconference opponents, six -- Lamar, Butler, San Francisco, Mississippi 
Valley State, Portland and Division II Chapman -- are coming off losing 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But there will be no easy Big West Conference games for Fullerton, which picked 
a bad year to rebuild. Six conference teams, including 1990 NCAA champion 
Nevada Las Vegas and conference tournament runner-up Cal State Long Beach, 
return four starters, and many of the conference's best players from last 
season are back. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's best player from last season's 13-16 team, Cedric Ceballos, is 
coming off the Phoenix Suns' bench. The Titans' best three-point shooter and 
second-leading scorer, Mark Hill, is gone. The Titans have two seniors on their 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprising, conference coaches recently picked Fullerton to finish last. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough year to be rebuilding when you look at all the players coming 
back," Sneed said. "But if we can stay healthy and keep the right combinations 
on the floor, we'll have a chance to be better than people expect." 
</P>
<P>
Here's a closer look at the Titans: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GUARD 
</P>
<P>
Sneed plans to use a three-guard rotation with Williams at the point, Joe Small 
at the wing and Crane backing up both. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is a two-year starter who averaged 9.8 points and 7.2 assists last 
season. He's not a great shooter, but his percentage from three-point range 
(.391) was better than his overall field-goal percentage (.344) in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
Small, who led state community college players in scoring with a 25.3 average 
for College of the Sequoias, is the team's best shooter. The former Bolsa 
Grande High School standout is a legitimate three-point threat who is expected 
to inherit much of the offensive void created by Hill's departure. 
</P>
<P>
Crane, a former Orange Coast College standout, is a decent shooter who saw 
minimal action last season. He's not a natural point guard, but Sneed says he 
has improved his ball-handling and passing skills during the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SMALL FORWARD 
</P>
<P>
J.D. Green, the 6-foot-6 junior transfer from Southern Methodist who redshirted 
last season, and the 6-5 Bowen will share this position. 
</P>
<P>
Green, who played on an outstanding Fairfax High School team with Sean Higgins 
and Chris Mills, is no Ceballos, but he's a good athlete who runs the floor 
well. He's also a good defensive player and rebounder, but he might not be the 
offensive savior Titan fans are hoping for. 
</P>
<P>
Bowen has been slowed by the surgery but looked surprisingly strong in the 
team's Blue-Orange scrimmage. He's a quick player who jumps well and will be 
effective on the fast break. But he might not be physical enough to provide 
much help inside. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
POWER FORWARD 
</P>
<P>
Ward, a 6-5, 225-pound junior, and Kevin Ahsmuhs, a 6-8, 215-pound community 
college transfer, will split time at this position. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of his bout with the flu, Ward, who was slowed by illnesses 
and an ankle injury last season, is in excellent shape. A 13-game starter who 
averaged 6.4 points and 4.8 rebounds in 1989-90, Ward will provide much-needed 
muscle inside. He scored 21 points in an exhibition game Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Ahsmuhs, whose playing experience consists of one high school varsity season 
and one community college season, is a versatile player who will provide 
defensive help, and his offensive skills are improving. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CENTER 
</P>
<P>
The Titans don't have a true center, but Caldwell, a 6-8, 220-pound senior, and 
Aaron Wilhite, a 6-7, 225-pound sophomore, will play the No. 5 position in 
Fullerton's two-wing alignment. 
</P>
<P>
Caldwell, who transferred from Washington in 1988, had major knee surgery in 
1987, but Sneed says he's in tiptop shape this season. Caldwell is extremely 
physical under the basket and has a nice inside shooting touch. 
</P>
<P>
Wilhite saw extensive action as a freshman last season, averaging 3.7 points 
and 3.1 rebounds. He's another muscular inside player who is more of a 
rebounder than scorer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
The Titans go two-deep at the forward and center positions with little talent 
drop-off from starters to reserves. But the talent level isn't as high as most 
Big West Conference teams. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton doesn't have much size or a dominating inside player, and a lack of 
depth at point guard and shooting guard could hurt the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
One factor that may work in their favor, though, is that the Titans don't have 
the pressure of high preseason expectations like they've had in recent years. 
They'll be underdogs in most conference games, and that should motivate the 
players and keep them loose. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a middle-of-the pack finish in the Big West would be a major 
accomplishment.

BUSH WILLING TO SEND EMERGENCY FOOD TO SOVIETS

<P>
President Bush said today that he would be willing to provide emergency food 
supplies and humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union, saying, "I worry about the 
Soviet people during the bleak winter coming up." 
</P>
<P>
Bush made his suggestion in advance of a two-hour meeting with Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose country is reeling under political and economic 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Sunday that the United States has 
not been asked for food or money. But U.S. officials said last week that they 
are preparing contingency plans in case of a Soviet request. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, during a morning news conference with British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher, appeared sympathetic to the plight of America's onetime chief 
adversary. 
</P>
<P>
"We would always be open-minded on humanitarian aid if there's a real need 
there," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. law limits direct economic aid to Moscow, Bush said the United 
States could help alleviate food shortages, for example. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's the right and humane thing to do as a country moves toward us and 
relations are greatly improved. And I would want to try to help," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Food rationing will begin next month in Leningrad, the country's second-largest 
city. Some smaller cities have been rationing for more than a year. In Moscow, 
some items such as sugar are restricted. The City Council is debating whether 
to issue coupon booklets.

GRAMMY AWARD STRIPPED FROM MILLI VANILLI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The music industry's Grammy Award for best new artist was stripped today from 
Milli Vanilli, the pop duo that admitted last week it did not sing a note on 
the "Girl You Know It's True" album. 
</P>
<P>
"This action comes as a result of admissions and revelations by Milli Vanilli's 
producer, record label and the two performers Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan that 
the label credit on their album . . . was incorrect," the National Academy of 
Recording Arts &amp; Sciences said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The Grammy was rescinded by a vote of the academy's National Board of Trustees. 
It wasn't known if the award will be given to another artist. 
</P>
<P>
"The disposition of the Grammy for the 1989 best new artist is currently being 
reviewed by the academy, and an announcement regarding the decision of the 
academy's Board of Trustees on this issue will be made in the near future," the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Pilatus and Morvan told The Times over the weekend that they wanted to give up 
the Grammy and return it to the artists who actually sang on their hit album. 
They had planned to forfeit the Grammy during a Tuesday news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The lip-sync controversy erupted last week when Milli Vanilli's German 
producer, Frank Farian, disclosed that others actually sang on the record 
credited to Pilatus and Morvan. The photogenic, dreadlocked duo also lip-synced 
their way through live performances, including one at the Grammy Awards show, 
Farian said.

POLICE SEEK CROSSBOW HUNTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burbank police are searching for a man who used a crossbow to shoot and kill a 
deer as it was feeding outside a house at the base of the Verdugo Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The dead animal was found early Sunday morning in a driveway in the 2400 block 
of Scott Road. 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Caven, 22, said she heard a noise outside her bedroom window about 2 
a.m. When she looked outside, she saw three deer eating in the front yard. Deer 
living in the rugged hills often venture into residential areas to find food 
and water. 
</P>
<P>
Caven said she watched for several minutes and took a few photographs before a 
dark four-wheel-drive vehicle with three men inside stopped in the street 
outside her house. One of the men climbed out of the vehicle, carrying what 
appeared to be a crossbow. He raised the weapon and fired a single arrow at the 
deer. 
</P>
<P>
The animals scattered, and the vehicle drove away. 
</P>
<P>
Police later found the carcass of the deer, a 100-pound female, in the driveway 
of a house a block away. Goldberg said the animal had a puncture wound in the 
upper back and police found bloodstained pieces of a broken arrow in the 
driveway. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said the man who shot the arrow is being sought on animal cruelty 
charges.

Orange County Registrar of Voters Donald Tanney released final vote totals 
today after workers spent the weekend tabulating about 55,000 absentee ballots 
from the Nov. 6 election held up by a court challenge from a state attorney 
general candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The additional votes did not change the outcome of any races in the county, 
including two City Council battles where the candidates were virtually 
neck-and-neck. 
</P>
<P>
In Costa Mesa, City Council candidate Jay Humphrey widened his narrow lead over 
Karen McGlinn, and Anaheim City Councilman Irv Pickler maintained his lead over 
Miriam Kaywood. 
</P>
<P>
In the 72nd Assembly District, where freshman Assemblyman Curt Pringle 
(R-Garden Grove) had held out slim hopes of closing the gap on Democratic 
challenger Tom Umberg, it was Umberg who got the majority of the remaining 
votes, winning the race by 1,836 votes. 
</P>
<P>
The vote count was halted by a court order Nov. 10 after attorney general 
candidate Arlo Smith's campaign complained that the tabulation procedures 
violated state laws designed to prevent fraudulent applications for absentee 
ballots. Smith dropped the complaint Friday but still has a second lawsuit 
pending challenging absentee ballot procedures statewide. Lungren won 392,456 
votes, and Smith received 194,013. 
</P>
<P>
In the race for governor, Republican Pete Wilson's final margin over Dianne 
Feinstein in Orange County was about 216,000 votes.

The Philippine justice secretary narrowly escaped a bomb attack on his home 
early today. 
</P>
<P>
Police said unidentified men hurled four bombs from a car at Franklin Drilon's 
home in the fashionable Manila district of Greenhills, damaging his two-story 
house and five other homes nearby and slightly injuring a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Drilon and his family escaped unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
"They were aimed at me because some of the bombs exploded just below the 
bedroom where I was sleeping," Drilon said in a radio interview. "Perhaps this 
is a message for me to go slow on the people we are investigating. I don't know 
who sent this message because we are investigating so many people." 
</P>
<P>
Drilon is in charge of prosecuting rebel soldiers linked to last December's 
sixth and most serious army coup attempt against President Corazon Aquino.

IT'S ANOTHER (YAWN) HISTORIC ARMS TREATY FOR LEADERS

Tomorrow's schoolchildren who have to learn this historic date will be relieved 
to know that august leaders yawned, doodled and joked while the world's most 
far-reaching disarmament treaty was signed today. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush lounged back in his gilt chair, drawing a series of horizontal 
lines on his note pad with his left hand. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
chuckled at a whispered joke from French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas. 
</P>
<P>
Naked cherubs in a carved and painted ceiling gazed down at the ceremony 
through the blaze of glittering chandeliers to the marble columns and red 
velvet of the Elysee Palace, residence of French President Francois Mitterrand. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take a little while, but it proves we are all here," Mitterrand said 
as aides began passing the treaty declaration, bound in red leather, around the 
tables. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, his first words were "Where's my chair?" 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two leaders, representing NATO's 16 states and the six Warsaw Pact 
allies, signed the document, which slashed Cold War arsenals, consigned 
mountains of weapons to the scrap heap and reversed the biggest arms buildup in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
A further 12 leaders of neutral, nonaligned and European mini-states, all 
members of the 34-state Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
looked on. 
</P>
<P>
They had arrived at the palace by the back door, a long slow convoy of official 
limousines gliding along graveled lanes into Mitterrand's private park in the 
heart of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The captain of a presidential military honor guard raised his saber 33 times to 
his chin to salute the arriving guests. 
</P>
<P>
Snipers guarded rooftops, and heavily armed SWAT-squad police in coal-black 
jumpsuits glared at crowds on the smart Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore, by the 
front entrance. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a great day, and a very grand occasion. It is the biggest treaty we've 
ever signed," said a beaming senior aide to British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher afterward. "I think the prime minister takes very great pride in it." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, dressed somberly in black and facing the outcome of the most serious 
challenge to her leadership at home, flashed pearl earrings and brave smiles at 
photographers. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in the middle of a grueling 
diplomatic odyssey to bolster the American-led coalition in the Persian Gulf 
crisis, yawned twice behind his hand. 
</P>
<P>
It all took less than 30 minutes, punctuated at the end by smiles and applause 
all round. 
</P>
<P>
The text back in Mitterrand's hands, he patted a blood-red leather box on the 
desk before him, the receptacle of the full 160-page document. 
</P>
<P>
Handing it on to Foreign Minister Hans Van Den Broek of the Netherlands, 
official keepers of the milestone pact, Mitterrand told the gathering: "This 
treaty is in good hands."

Barbara Bush joined Europe's first ladies today on a sightseeing trip 
encompassing the Louvre and Versailles. It proved to be a pain in the neck -- 
literally -- for one of the group, Hannelore Kohl, wife of German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
The tour concluded with a gourmet luncheon hosted by French First Lady Danielle 
Mitterrand. 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests at Versailles' Grand Trianon palace was Mrs. Kohl, whose meal 
ended prematurely. As photographers rushed to take pictures of Mrs. Bush, one 
of them accidentally bumped into Mrs. Kohl. The French photographer's camera 
and heavy lens grazed her neck as they slipped off his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Kohl winced and began rubbing the wound while Mrs. Bush expressed her 
concern. Mrs. Kohl excused herself from the table after being hurt. The 
photographer said he was unaware of the incident when it happened but later 
apologized to Mrs. Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
Raisa Gorbachev was the last to arrive -- skipping the guided tour of the Grand 
Trianon, built in pink marble in 1687 by Louis XIV to accommodate his volatile 
private life. She exchanged warm greetings with Mrs. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The group enjoyed a four-course meal prepared by one of France's leading 
caterers. The menu included coquilles St. Jacques and shrimp mousse, roast 
beef, vegetables, cheese, fruit and chestnut ice cream, accompanied by three 
vintage French wines.

YELTSIN CALLS FOR REFERENDUM ON GORBACHEV

Boris N. Yeltsin called today for a referendum in his vast Russian republic on 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's performance as president. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, largest of the 15 Soviet 
republics, said his region is ready to conduct such a referendum. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Kiev, where he was to sign a treaty with the Ukraine, Yeltsin said 
the referendum would also ask Russians whether they have confidence in the 
central government. 
</P>
<P>
"Russia is ready to hold a referendum on two questions -- the entire presidency 
of Mikhail Gorbachev and on faith in the central government," he told the 
Ukrainian Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Such a plebiscite would ask more than half the Soviet Union's 290 million 
people to cast judgment on Gorbachev's performance, possibly laying the basis 
for a more direct challenge from Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin censured Gorbachev's new plan, announced Saturday, to take charge of 
all government ministries as a bid to increase his personal power and a 
betrayal of promised decentralization. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin compared Gorbachev's recent steps to the failed rule of the late Nikita 
S. Khrushchev, "when the center tried to recentralize everything and the 
reforms died." 
</P>
<P>
The burly Siberian also took issue with Gorbachev's recent decree requiring 
enterprises to give up most of their hard currency earnings to the central 
government, calling it the "biggest mistake" of Gorbachev's eight-month 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the hard currency order, if implemented, "will force us to our 
knees."

The United Auto Workers said today that its members have ratified the last of

Bob Barbee said.

Precise figures were unavailable.

The union initially focused its bargaining efforts on General Motors Corp., and 
bargainers reached tentative agreement Sept. 17. Less than a week later, a 
tentative agreement was reached with Ford Motor Co. The UAW and Chrysler 
reached tentative agreement Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Each contract provides for a 3% base wage increase in the first year, 3% 
lump-sum payments in the second and third years and increases for current and

Melbourne, Montreal and Seattle-Tacoma are the best cities in which to live, 
the private Population Crisis Committee said after surveying conditions in the 
world's 100 largest metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
Lagos, Nigeria, is the worst, the group said today in an analysis based on two 
years of research. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon L. Camp, the organization's senior vice president, said the study isn't 
a guidebook for retirement or business or vacations but rather a warning about 
the dangers of rapid population growth. 
</P>
<P>
"More than half of these cities are sinking from the weight of too many 
people," she said. "More than anything else, the numbers . . . add up to human 
population overload." 
</P>
<P>
Lagos averages 5.8 people per room in living space, only half the city's houses 
have water and electricity and there is only one telephone per 100 people.

ASBESTOS VICTIMS' COMPENSATION PLAN ALTERED;

HEALTH: THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE MANVILLE TRUST WILL SLASH ATTORNEYS' FEES AND 
SPEED PAYMENT OF CLAIMS.

<P>
A plan was unveiled today to restructure the Manville trust set up to 
compensate victims of asbestos by slashing attorneys' fees and paying victims 
according to the severity of their disease. 
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited plan is designed to speed payments to tens of thousands of 
workers nationwide who contracted cancer and other diseases inhaling fibers 
from Manville-made asbestos. Thousands have died before being compensated. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring plan, submitted today to U.S. District Judge Jack B. 
Weinstein, includes up to $520 million in new contributions to the trust by 
Manville Corp., which was driven into bankruptcy court in 1982 by its asbestos 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
It also provides for dismissal of tens of thousands of lawsuits against the 
trust pending in state and federal courts across the country, potentially 
eliminating a huge backlog that has jammed judges' dockets. 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein is expected to approve the restructuring. He initiated a class action 
today consolidating all the pending Manville trust cases for resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The plan caps a year of turmoil that began when the Washington-based trust ran 
out of cash to pay new claims and said some victims would not be paid until 
well into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
The trust has paid out more than $1.1 billion to settle nearly 26,000 claims to 
date. But an additional 130,000 claims are pending, and more are being filed 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
Average payments to date by the trust have been more than $43,000. Under the 
plan, they are expected to fall 45% from what the trust had been paying for 
serious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos is a white mineral with natural insulation and heat resistance that 
was used widely for decades in shipbuilding, construction and other industries. 
A high incidence of cancer and other respiratory ailments attributed to 
asbestos began to appear in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Payments to all Manville claimants except those with urgent health or financial 
needs were suspended by Weinstein in July. They will not resume until the 
restructuring plan is reviewed by Weinstein and court appeals of the plan are 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
But the plan marks a major step toward resolving asbestos litigation and is 
intended as a blueprint for dozens of other companies facing bankruptcy because 
of asbestos liability. 
</P>
<P>
"These steps . . . will more effectively, efficiently and equitably compensate 
those injured by asbestos exposure," Tom Stephens, Manville chairman and chief 
executive, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The plan provides for annual payments to claimants based on a percentage of the 
trust's available resources. Claims are split into two groups: those for cancer 
and other serious asbestos ailments, and lesser diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Payments will be made only to claims from the first group, known as Level One, 
during the first two years of the plan. An estimated 23,000 serious claims are 
expected to be paid in the first two years. 
</P>
<P>
Level Two cases, of which more than 100,000 are pending, will begin to be paid 
in the third year of the plan.

Cincinnati Reds outfielder Eric Davis underwent arthroscopic surgery today to

<P>
Dr. Michael Lawhon, the Reds' team physician, performed the surgery this 
morning at Christ Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Reds spokesman Joe Kelley said Davis was judged able to leave the Cincinnati 
hospital in a matter of hours to return home and continue recuperating. 
</P>
<P>
Lawhon said he found evidence of wear and tear on the kneecap's underside. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no major ligament or cartilage damage," Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, 28, is still recovering from the kidney injury he suffered while diving 
for a ball in Game 4 of the Reds' World Series sweep of the Oakland Athletics. 
The Reds say Davis is expected to be fully recovered from that injury by spring 
training.

The New York Yankees signed free agent pitcher Tim Leary to a three-year 
guaranteed contract for a reported $5.95 million today. 
</P>
<P>
Leary, acquired from Cincinnati in a trade last winter, was 9-19 for New York 
with a 4.11 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
His career record is 54-75 in six-plus major league seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Leary led the Yankees in innings pitched with 208, the fourth straight year he 
has worked more than 200 innings. He was often victimized by slim support, with 
the Yankees scoring only 38 runs in the 19 games he lost. 
</P>
<P>

A psychology professor says having sex the night before a big game can improve 
an athlete's performance -- provided he or she does not get carried away. 
</P>
<P>
University of British Columbia Prof. Susan Butt, Canada's top-ranked female 
tennis player in the 1960s, said sex is a form of exercise and the same rules 
about overtraining apply as in sports. 
</P>
<P>
"Depending on the athlete's personality and physical makeup, sexual activity 
within reason might even enhance his or her performance," she told Reuters in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Too much exhausting activity wouldn't be recommended for anybody," said Butt, 
whose findings are published in a recent issue of Sports Medicine, a scientific 
journal published in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
The findings were developed from a comprehensive review of the literature on 
the subject that includes references to more than 70 authors ranging from 
Sigmund Freud to Masters and Johnson.

Illinois All-American nose tackle Moe Gardner broke his right forearm and will 
miss the season finale against Northwestern, an Illinois trainer said. 
</P>
<P>
The senior -- one of four finalists for the Lombardi Trophy, given annually to 
the best defensive lineman in the country -- broke the arm in Saturday's 24-10 
victory over Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know exactly when it happened, but it was late in the game," Gardner 
said. "It was bothering me then, but I wasn't quite sure whether or not it was 
broken. But when I woke up (Sunday), it hurt pretty bad. I knew something was 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Gardner will be in a cast for three weeks. Trainer Al Martindale said Gardner 
could be ready for the Hall of Fame Bowl on Jan. 1.

TALK-LINE GIRDS FOR 10TH YEAR OF TALKING TURKEY

It's time to talk turkey again. 
</P>
<P>
The Butterball Turkey Talk-Line is back in business for its 10th year of 
answering sometimes wacky questions with serious advice. 
</P>
<P>
In 10 years, the experts who answer 1-(800)-323-4848 have heard just about 
every question and disaster that can befall the preparation of that 
Thanksgiving turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Some questions are simple: "How do I turn my oven on?" a caller from Lawrence, 
Kan., asked. 
</P>
<P>
Some are odd: "Do you baste under the turkey's armpit?" a fledgling cook from 
Mankato, Minn., wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
Judging by some questions, some cooks might have been better off if they had 
not figured out how to turn that oven on. 
</P>
<P>
A Baltimore woman said no one told her to remove the plastic wrap before 
cooking the bird. A newlywed from Quincy, Mass., prepared the bird for the oven 
by washing it -- with soap. A Philadelphia woman called to ask about the rubber 
glove she left inside the turkey. 
</P>
<P>
"I called my mother and asked her how to fix a turkey," an Indiana cook said, 
"and she told me to call the Butterball Turkey Talk-Line." 
</P>
<P>
Talk-Line staffers still chuckle about the Egg Harbor City, N.J., secretary who 
apparently didn't think much of her boss's culinary ability and left a message 
for him to return a call to the Talk-Line. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the most-asked question was how to roast the bird. Answer: Use the 
conventional open pan method, with the uncovered turkey oiled and sitting on a 
rack in a 325-degree oven. 
</P>
<P>
Other inquiries included how best to thaw a frozen turkey, how to stuff it and 
what to do with leftovers.

BOWL COMMITTEES PAY THE PRICE FOR ACTING TOO EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM LAYDEN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The timing is just wonderful. The college football bowl system, already under 
siege from those who lust after a national playoff (Four teams! Eight teams! 
16! 64! Play until February!) has completely embarrassed itself this fall, 
lowering its pursuit of attractive matchups to untold depths and, in the 
process, leaving itself at the mercy of late-season upsets. Which it is 
getting, by the fistful. 
</P>
<P>
Is this a surprise? In a season that began with Miami of Florida losing to 
Brigham Young and followed with Notre Dame falling to Stanford, Colorado losing 
(should have, anyway) to Missouri, Virginia first reaching No. 1 and then 
immediately falling from it . . . can we be shocked that after all the bowl 
hands were shaken, Notre Dame should lose to Penn State at home and, less 
dramatically, Virginia should be beaten by Maryland? Come now. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the bowl folk went ahead and rolled their dice, sealing up all the 
December and January arrangements two weeks before Nov. 24, the NCAA's official 
invitation date. By last Sunday, it was known that Notre Dame will play 
Colorado in the Orange Bowl, Virginia will play the Southeastern Conference 
champion in the Sugar Bowl and Miami will meet the Southwest Conference winner 
(probably Texas) in the Cotton Bowl -- along with 16 other matchups. And that 
was that. Three weeks to go in the season and the bowls were set. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Saturday. Notre Dame's 24-21 loss guaranteed that the Orange Bowl's 
pure national championship scenario is dead. Colorado will be ranked No. 1, but 
the Irish, 8-2 with a deadly late-season loss, will drop into the second five 
and have no shot. 
</P>
<P>
The Sugar Bowl gambled on Virginia, which had captured No. 1 and the country's 
attention (great academics, lovely setting, Thomas Jefferson, all that) before 
folding in the spotlight against Georgia Tech and being exposed Saturday at 
home against Maryland. How many teams look better than the Cavaliers now? 
Twenty? But the Sugar Bowl is stuck with them, probably against a Tennessee 
team with four non-victories (two losses and two ties). 
</P>
<P>
If the bowls had the courage to take control of a system they created, they 
could play this silly autumn game from strength and not from desperation. What 
the colleges have done is play the bowls' insecurity against them and squeeze 
early invitations (and big per-team guarantees) out of them. Each of the bowls 
that isn't tied to a conference lives in fear of being left without a viable 
matchup. 
</P>
<P>
without Notre Dame). 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA has rescinded, effective next year, the bowl invitation date. That's a 
good idea, because people paid it less attention than "Cop Rock." On the down 
side, bowls will be able to line up games whenever they please, which means 
that we can get Notre Dame and Miami committed to the Fiesta Bowl next October. 
And then watch each lose twice in November. 
</P>
<P>
The bowls can handle this if they wish to show just a touch of spine. They have 
a useful system, which often has produced a lively debate and a defensible 
national champion. It's better, if handled correctly, than a playoff that 
extends a season that's already too long. If the bowls had not been so quick to 
jump this fall, they might have matched No. 2 Miami with No. 1 Colorado in the 
Orange Bowl, Texas with Notre Dame in the Cotton and Penn State with Tennessee 
in the Sugar. Guys, do one thing next year: Wait.

MELVIN DURSLAG: SANTA CLARA STADIUM: ANOTHER OPTION PLAY THAT DIDN'T WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the recent elections, sports sustained a serious setback in Arizona when 
voters refused to recognize Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday as a national 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
In the Santa Clara Valley of California, King's birthday, indeed, is 
recognized. All voters wouldn't do is recognize the need for a new stadium for 
the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Community leaders in the area had worked exhaustively to talk the Giants into 
locating in a spot just outside San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
They even persuaded the owner of the Giants, Bob Lurie, to change the name of 
his club to Santa Clara Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Everything was in place, except with the voters, who defeated the stadium 
measure by roughly two percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago voters recently had approved a stadium for the White Sox. Cleveland 
voters had approved one for the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
And down in Texas, Arlington voters agreed to build a stadium for the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
But Santa Clara says no on the ground it doesn't want new taxes, and the owner 
of the Giants now sits down to think about his problem. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, a stadium measure hits the ballot in San Francisco. It loses. It comes 
up again in '89 and loses. 
</P>
<P>
And now at the polls, the Giants have stretched their streak to 0-for-3, 
blowing the decision at Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
So what is owner Bob Lurie going to do? 
</P>
<P>
Well, the first thing he says is that he is going to review his options. People 
in sports are always reviewing their options. Most of us say we are up a creek, 
hoping to stumble onto something -- but in sports, they review options. 
</P>
<P>
While he is reviewing, Lurie will keep the Giants in 1991 at Candlestick Park, 
from where he has been trying to escape since shortly after buying the team in 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
His predecessor, Horace Stoneham, just about went broke at Candlestick Park. 
Lurie and a partner he rounded up -- a Phoenix meat packer -- bought the Giants 
to prevent outsiders from snatching the club and moving it to Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Lurie would buy out the meat packer, arranging to get butchered at 
the gate all by himself. 
</P>
<P>
But the investment would prove wise, considering how much baseball franchises 
have escalated the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Lurie has no complaints. All he wants is a stadium more suitable for baseball 
than Candlestick Park, an atmospheric disaster since its opening in 1960. And 
he prefers the stadium in the Bay Area, where he was born in 1929 and from 
which he hasn't strayed. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed stadium in Santa Clara was modest, designed to accommodate only 
45,000. And agreeing to call the team the Santa Clara Giants, Lurie was 
rejecting the so-called big-time label, so precious to other owners in sports. 
</P>
<P>
Departing Los Angeles, did the pro football team accept the handle of Anaheim 
Rams? Did another call itself the Pontiac Lions? And another the Irving 
Cowboys? 
</P>
<P>
The two New York teams fleeing across the river refused to be known, 
respectively, as the New Jersey Giants and Jets. 
</P>
<P>
And would the basketball and hockey worlds find in their midst the Inglewood 
Lakers and Inglewood Kings? 
</P>
<P>
Lurie was trying hard to please Santa Clara, but, in the end, the majority 
asked: 
</P>
<P>
"Should we pay for a stadium for a multimillionaire? Instead of our building 
the stadium and inviting him, would it not be better if he built the stadium 
and invited us?" 
</P>
<P>
So the leader of the Giants is now reviewing his options, meaning it is 6-5 and 
pick it where the team will be residing in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
In behalf of the Giants, it can't be said they are a burden on society. In 
return for the stadium, they would have delivered to the Santa Clara region a 
lot of fun for the populace and they would have stimulated a measure of fringe 
business. 
</P>
<P>
But reviewing their options, voters concluded they will do without the fun, 
without the fringe business -- and without the tax with which they would have 
been nailed. 
</P>
<P>
That's life today: one option review following the next.

TROTTER MACK LOBELL AIMS AT PERFECT RECORD 
</P>

<P>
Mack Lobell, the world's fastest trotter, was supposed to retire at stud in 
Sweden when American Lou Guida sold him to John-Erik Magnusson for $6 million 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But as a 6-year-old, Mack Lobell continues to come out of stud service and 
continually win on the competitive Swedish harness racing circuit. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Mack Lobell is still the world's No. 1 trotter, even when he's 
not in top shape," driver Thomas Nilsson said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Mack Lobell beat Mr. Moxy by nearly two lengths in the feature 
race at Solvalla Racetrack outside Stockholm for his 14th consecutive victory 
in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Nilsson, one of Sweden's leading drivers, has not lost a race with Mack Lobell. 
They will try to close the year with a perfect record Dec. 22, Mack's next 
scheduled start. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-bred Mack Lobell has turned into a gold mine at stud and is not doing 
badly on the race track either. With one race left this year, Mack Lobell has 
won more than $454,000. 
</P>
<P>
Magnusson, who said Mack Lobell is fully booked for next stud season, also has 
big plans for him on the track next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I may enter him for the Prix d'Amerique, but I'd like to see Peace Corps in 
that race, too," Magnusson said. "It would probably be too much to race Mack 
Lobell alone against the best French trotters." 
</P>
<P>
Peace Corps, the U.S. Trotter of the Year in 1989, was purchased by Swede Bjorn 
Pettersson's U.S.-based stable in 1988 and was brought to Sweden this year. 
</P>
<P>
Mack Lobell easily beat Peace Corps in the May 27 Elitloppet over one mile at 
Solvalla in the first meeting between the world's fastest male and female 
trotters. 
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 22 race is expected to get Mack Lobell ready for the Prix d'Amerique. 
Europe's premier harness race will be held at the Vincennes track in Paris in 
late January. 
</P>
<P>
Mack Lobell, whom Guida purchased for only $17,500 in 1985, has set eight world 
records. He was the 1987 U.S. Harness Horse of the Year and is a three-time 
Breeders Crown champion. 
</P>
<P>
Dance for Lucy led wire-to-wire, weathering a late rally by Betty Lobelia to 
win the first division of the $60,425 Cardinal Handicap by a nose Sunday at 
Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Dance for Lucy, ridden by David Penna, picked up her third win in 11 starts 
this year.

RIVALRY FOR CARL REINER IS ON FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl Reiner was in an especially jovial mood the other day during one leg of a 
daunting, nationwide promotion tour for his new film, "Sibling Rivalry," that 
would have tired a man half his age. 
</P>
<P>
But Reiner, tall, trim and as busy as ever at 68, still looks a lot like his 
most well-known character, Alan Brady, the arrogant variety show host on the 
old "Dick Van Dyke Show." 
</P>
<P>
His good humor was evident despite decidedly mixed reviews about the movie, his 
latest film in a career that spans 40 years. Reiner directed "Sibling Rivalry." 
</P>
<P>
The critics have not been not especially kind to the comedy, which stars 
Kirstie Alley and involves a man who died during sex with her and the various 
cases of mistaken identity that occur as a result. 
</P>
<P>
"The prospect of a new Reiner comedy is a lip-smacking one. Rob Reiner, that 
is. Not papa Carl, whose best comedies were made years ago," wrote the New York 
Post film critic in panning "Sibling Rivalry." 
</P>
<P>
Carl Reiner does not dispute those sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"Rob had the toughest time of all my kids," he said. "He wanted to be in show 
business, and he had a father who was going on all cylinders. He was in 
competition with me, and he was impatient. Then he ended up outrunning Dad." 
</P>
<P>
Reiner lists his son's movies with pride, saying, "He's been up at bat six 
times, and you can't find anything really wrong with his work." 
</P>
<P>
Reiner also said that his son "outstripped me as far as acting, too. Whenever 
they'd see us on the street, they'd start yelling, 'Hey Meathead!' One time, 
somebody called him Meatloaf, and I yelled back, 'No, it's Meathead!' " 
</P>
<P>
According to Carl Reiner, family members have always been competitive with each 
other, but they've also remained loyal. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner's brother, Charlie, who owns a printing business in Atlanta, was always 
the "funnier one" when they were growing up in the Bronx, the sons of a 
watchmaker. 
</P>
<P>
"But Charlie suffered because I was the more quiet, studious one and my mother 
would always say, 'Why can't you be more like your brother, Carl?' We still 
talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
But it was his brother who urged him to enroll in drama school and become an 
actor. And his brother still religiously tapes all Reiner's appearances on TV 
and saves all news clippings about him. "Every time I'm on Carson, he still 
tapes it," Reiner said. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner's other two children are daughter, Annie, a playwright and artist, and 
Lucas, who directed the film "Spirit of '76." 
</P>
<P>
"My other kids have had a problem with it," said Reiner of both his success and 
Rob's. "Annie was showing some of her work recently, and the first people who 
greeted her at the door said, 'Aren't you Carl Reiner's daughter?' She's trying 
to have her own identity. You want to make it on your own." 
</P>
<P>
But Reiner said his family is very close-knit and often gathers for dinners at 
the Beverly Hills home he shares with his wife of 47 years, Estelle. 
</P>
<P>
Even if he believes Rob has surpassed him as a director, Carl Reiner is keeping 
as busy as ever. He continually sifts through new scripts in search of a movie 
to direct. He was eager to return to Beverly Hills, where he's in the midst of 
a novel about Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a worker," he said. "I've worked steadily all my life. I've become 
venerable. I've gone through several incarnations, but I've kept current. 
There's a whole generation of adults who grew up with me."

CBS REPORTS 4TH-QUARTER LOSS, BAD FORECAST FOR '91

<P>
CBS Inc., once called the "Tiffany network," painted a grim profit picture 
today, saying it will report a loss in the fourth quarter and lower earnings 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based company said surprisingly steep losses arising from the 
short baseball playoffs and World Series games hurt results, while a tough 
advertising climate pressured the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
CBS agreed to pay $1.1 billion in 1988 to televise four years of Major League 
baseball, resulting in $275 million in costs for the right to air the games 
this season alone. 
</P>
<P>
When the Cincinnati Reds swept the Oakland Athletics in four straight games to 
win the World Series, the network could not recoup its licensing expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The network also said it expects earnings to decline next year because it will 
not be covering two premier sporting events that it broadcast this past year: 
the NFL Super Bowl and NBA playoffs and championships.

"As a result the CBS Television Network is currently expected to show an 
operating loss in 1991," the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The CBS network is the hub of the company's vast broadcast operations, which 
include local television and radio stations and the radio network. 
</P>
<P>
The losses come at a particularly hard time for CBS, for its standing in the 
television ratings has inched up in the past few weeks from its third-ranked 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
Costs for entertainment programming and sporting events have also risen as the 
economy has slowed, sapping advertising revenues during its prime-time programs 
and sports events. 
</P>
<P>
"These are not just short-term problems," CBS chief executive Laurence Tisch 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"It is now apparent that increased competition for both viewers and advertising 
dollars, combined with rapidly escalating programming costs, is changing the 
fundamental economics of network television." 
</P>
<P>
The quarterly loss will be its first since the fourth quarter of 1986, when the 
company recorded a $20-million operating earnings shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
The company's shares lost $2 to $161.75 in midday trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

Actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner believes that he's ready for life after "The Cosby 
Show" -- behind the camera. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been preparing to be a director since I was 17," Warner says in an 
interview published in the Nov. 24 issue of TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had to learn it." 
</P>
<P>
Warner, 20, has starred as Bill Cosby's son, Theo, on the hit series for seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Where do I go from here? To think that I reached my peak as a teen-ager would 
be a sad and scary thought." 
</P>
<P>
He directed his first episode of "The Cosby Show" last spring and is set to 
direct two more episodes this season. He's negotiating to direct a feature 
film, has already directed six music videos and is co-producing four television 
children's specials.
