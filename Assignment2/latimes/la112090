DOMINATOR EWING EYES ROLE OFF COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HUBBARD, NEWSDAY 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dominating games has become second nature. Patrick Ewing does it naturally. He 
scores, he rebounds, he blocks shots. He is almost unstoppable offensively and 
impenetrable defensively. 
</P>
<P>
His effect on his team's success is as great as any player's in the National 
Basketball Association. In a very large way, Patrick Ewing is the New York 
Knicks. And the Knicks are Patrick Ewing's. 
</P>
<P>
The bond continues to grow, but as it does, the relationship becomes more 
complicated. The Knicks have asked for big statistics from Ewing, and he has 
provided them. The Knicks have asked for leadership from Ewing, and he has 
begun to give it to them. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Ewing wants respect and cash. He has demanded a huge contract and 
although no dollar figures have been leaked, it is safe to assume Ewing wants 
to be the highest-paid player in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing is in the sixth season of a 10-year contract that will pay him more than 
$30 million, but unless he is one of the four highest-paid players in the game, 
he could become a restricted free agent at the end of this season. Ewing is 
earning $4.2 million, but by the end of this season, he will not be among the 
top four. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing also wants the off-court respect accorded a player of his stature. He 
would like to be more involved in some of the important decisions made by the 
team. He would like to be the elder statesman, the player team owners consult 
when they are contemplating a significant move. Before the Los Angeles Lakers 
make a big deal, Lakers owner Jerry Buss asks for input from Magic Johnson. 
Before the Detroit Pistons make a big move, Pistons owner Bill Davidson 
consults with Isiah Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing said that is not the case in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"No," he said, "unfortunately that doesn't happen here. I'd love for them to 
come to me. I think they need to make the effort." 
</P>
<P>
Knicks officials say the opposite is true. After the season ends, Ewing is not 
always available. In the past, it has been difficult to get Ewing to attend 
face-to-face meetings, where General Manager Al Bianchi said every player is 
asked for input on the team. 
</P>
<P>
When Coach Stu Jackson wanted to discuss Ewing asserting himself in a 
leadership role, Jackson had to drive to Ewing's home in Washington, D.C., 
twice to discuss it with him. Jackson said Ewing is becoming more of a force in 
the organization, but that this is only Ewing's sixth season and it is not 
unusual for such a role to develop slowly. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a new area for him," Jackson said, "and it's one that I think myself as 
well as management would encourage him to do. We're a team this year, but he's 
our superstar. And I think anything he says will be listened to. He's not done 
it in the past. ... but with guys like Isiah and (Michael) Jordan, that's come 
over time. It's something that is steadily built. In Patrick's case, it will 
continue to build each year. It's not something that just happens instantly. 
Even Magic had to work his way into that role. It didn't take him quite as long 
as most people, but he's Magic." 
</P>
<P>
With the Knicks, however, there are obstacles that prevent Ewing from having 
the type of close relationship with the owner that Johnson or Thomas has. The 
Knicks are owned by Madison Square Garden. Madison Square Garden is owned by 
Paramount Communications. Each group is run by an executive. Paramount is owned 
by Marvin Davis. MSG is run by Richard Evans. 
</P>
<P>
But the Knicks are run by the MSG Sports Group, whose president is Jack Diller. 
And although Diller is involved in the most important dealings by the Knicks, 
he allows Bianchi to run the basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
The corporate structure is not conducive to creating a close player-owner 
relationship because the person in charge either has to report to someone 
higher, or defer to someone lower. Perhaps it is that lack of closeness caused 
by a corporate setup that led to a situation where Ewing said he was "insulted" 
by the Knicks' most recent contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is the corporate setup that should make Ewing feel confident of getting 
a lucrative contract. As Bianchi said of Paramount Communications and MSG, 
"These people are very good business people. They are very bright, and they are 
aware of Patrick's value and who he is and what he is. We have all the 
expertise in the world, plus we have the means to pay him." 
</P>
<P>
Ewing said he prefers not to talk anymore about his contract status. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a lack of confidence," Ewing said. "The Knicks have been good to 
me during my six years here. I said what I felt I had to say about my contract 
situation, and I'm just going to leave it at that." 
</P>
<P>
But even though he denies having a lack of confidence in the Knicks, his words 
indicate otherwise. Not only did he speak out on the contract, but last week 
during the Knicks' 3-1 West Coast road trip, he admitted he was frustrated with 
the Knicks' inability to compete for a championship. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing, however, has done an excellent job of playing through any disappointment 
he might feel. Not only does he play hard, but every aspect of his game 
continues to develop. 
</P>
<P>
Last year he increased his scoring by more than 25 percent from the previous 
season. He also averaged more than 10 rebounds for the first time in his 
career. He made the All-NBA first team for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
This season he leads the league in blocked shots with an average of 4.78. He 
has made a subtle yet significant improvement in court awareness, more actively 
looking for the open man when he is double-teamed. 
</P>
<P>
But even more significant is that Ewing has asserted himself as the team leader 
for the first time. In the past, club officials said they wished he would 
become more of a leader, but that he was more likely to lead by actions than 
words. 
</P>
<P>
That has changed. This season Ewing constantly has pumped up his teammates and 
gone out of his way to encourage and motivate them. They have noticed the 
change. 
</P>
<P>
"He has to make us feel good about ourselves," guard Trent Tucker said. "When 
he comes by and says, 'Good job,' that gives us that extra confidence that we 
need. In a basketball game, confidence can waver very easily. You can be very 
confident in the first half, and in the second half you can lose it. So when 
your best player is for you and telling you that you can get the job done, that 
keeps you more confident. He's a great player, and a team player." 
</P>
<P>
Ewing obviously has asserted himself in many areas. If he and the organization 
are willing, there still is room to grow.

NUGGETS SLOW IT DOWN, CAN'T STAY UP WITH MAGIC; 
</P>
<P>
LAKERS: DESPITE GETTING SPECIAL ATTENTION, JOHNSON HAS A TRIPLE-DOUBLE IN 
122-105 VICTORY OVER DENVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

DENVER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lakers prepared themselves for the full running, trapping, mile-high 
oxygen-sucking fury of Paul Ball, and what did they get? 
</P>
<P>
Token pressure. Out of respect for Magic Johnson, Denver Nugget Coach Paul 
Westhead pulled his press back Monday night, hoping to tire out Johnson, 
instead. Magic's fatigue didn't preclude posting his third triple-double in 
five games as the Lakers cruised, 122-105. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since the mousse era, the Lakers have won two games in a 
row. They play Denver again Wednesday night at the Forum as new Coach Mike 
Dunleavy chases that elusive .500 mark. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets' pressure might have bothered Curt Gowdy's Wyoming team or Hank 
Iba's Oklahoma State but for the Lakers, it was a red carpet to the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had 21 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds. The rest of the roster 
celebrated get-well night. The shooting guards, Byron Scott and Terry Teagle, 
firing at 39% and 38% respectively, went a combined 14 for 26. A.C. Green came 
off the bench to post his season high, 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, I thought they were pretty conservative tonight," 
Dunleavy said. 
</P>
<P>
"The only adjustment we made was to change our press to start the game," 
Westhead said. "We didn't want to trap Magic because he'd just pass it ahead. 
We wanted to work him the full length of the court. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't succeed. It didn't succeed because we didn't work him hard enough. 
Come the third quarter, our guys are tired and he's playing half-court 
basketball with us. He's playing in the pivot and having a good old time." 
</P>
<P>
It almost succeeded in a sense. The Lakers were forced to call time out in the 
third quarter, as Johnson and several others came wheezing back to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
However, they were tired from scoring baskets. They had just outscored the 
Nuggets, 12-4, to open up an 85-66 lead. 
</P>
<P>
To an increasing crowd of Denver skeptics, Johnson later politely pointed out 
Westhead's burden: new, young personnel, a new system. 
</P>
<P>
The system, itself: Would Johnson like to play it? 
</P>
<P>
"If I was younger," he said. "If he (Westhead) had had me a few years ago, yes. 
Right now, I don't think I could, at this age." 
</P>
<P>
Westhead did have Johnson a few years ago, when Magic was younger. You'll 
remember they had a disagreement about pace, but that's another story. 
</P>
<P>
"The running might be nice," Scott said, "but I wouldn't like the trapping. I 
don't want to be critical, but it's not practical, not in the NBA. Teams are 
too good. Players are too good. You get layups. If you don't, you pull the ball 
out and run your offense." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Lakers played Sunday night in Los Angeles, flew to Denver after the 
game, slept in Monday, then prepared for this game by walking through a 
practice in a hotel ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
With that much drill, they committed only 12 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
They also got to shoot many layups, dunks and what have you. This made them 
feel a lotbetter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad it's come slow," Johnson said, "but the good thing is, it's 
coming. We wanted to see some of the old Lakers and here they come now. Our 
game is to get up, get into the open court and do the things we do best." 
</P>
<P>
In that case, here's good news for them: Westhead says the Nuggets are going to 
turn it up in Wednesday's rematch. This time, the Lakers will be the home team 
and they'll be coming off a day off, rather than four games in five nights in 
four cities. 
</P>
<P>
"If that (a slowdown) was a byproduct, it wasn't intended," Westhead said. "If 
anything, we'll try to up the tempo Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
If you don't see the Lakers of old, it won't be for lack of opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
James Worthy shot nine for 22 and scored 25 points. He was to fly all night -- 
on the Laker charter back to Los Angeles, then on a red-eye to Houston -- to 
appear at his arraignment this morning. . . . The Lakers failed to shoot 50% 
for the eighth time in nine games. On the other hand, by holding Denver to 
43.1%, they lowered their defensive average below 50% for the first time this 
season. . . . Byron Scott was fined $1,000 by the NBA for his part in Friday 
night's fight with James Donaldson of the Dallas Mavericks. Donaldson was fined 
$3,000. Said Scott: "I'm surprised. You look at the films and he initiated 
everything. I guess I was fined for retaliating. I'm not upset, but I'm 
surprised."

CAN AZTECS SEND TOURISTS TO SHREVEPORT?

<P>
The Independence Bowl Selection Committee met again Monday evening in 
Shreveport, La. and the Aztecs still appear to be a longshot for the game. 
</P>
<P>
"As I told their athletic director (Fred Miller) today, there are a few teams a 
lot more in contention than (San Diego State)," said Brant Goyne, president of 
the Independence Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the reason you have a bowl game is to bring tourists to town and have 
people stay in your hotels. I don't have a good feeling about (SDSU)." 
</P>
<P>
Baylor is nearly a lock for one of the bids unless the Bears upset Texas 
Saturday, which would keep them in the running for the Cotton Bowl. As for the 
other bid, Louisiana Tech, South Carolina, North Carolina, Temple and Virginia 
Tech all are ahead of SDSU on the committee's priority list. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is scheduled to meet again Wednesday, at which time they hope to 
narrow down the field. 
</P>
<P>
Statistical updates after SDSU's 40-34 victory Saturday over New Mexico: 
Quarerback Dan McGwire is rated third nationally in passing efficiency (153.2), 
trailing Virginia's Shawn Moore and Brigham Young's Ty Detmer. Receivers 
Patrick Rowe and Dennis Arey rank first and fourth in receiving yards per game. 
Rowe is averaging 125.44 and Arey is at 101.33. Rowe, who has 1,129 receiving 
yards this season, is currently eighth in both the SDSU and Western Athletic 
Conference single-season yardage lists. He tied an Aztec record Saturday with 
his seventh consecutive game with more than 100 yards receiving and is one 
short of an NCAA record. SCOTT MILLER

</P>
<P>
The game will be a College Football Assn. telecast, aired live on ESPN.

Vania Popova scored with 18 seconds left to lift the Bulgarian National team to 
a 70-68 victory over the University of San Diego in an exhibition game at the 
USD Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing by 16 with six minutes left, the USD rallied to tie Bulgaria 
with 45 seconds left. Senior forward Christi English, who made 11 of 15 shots, 
led the Tereras with 27 points and 15 rebounds. Both were game highs. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of those points came during an 18-2 run down the stretch, as USD tied the 
game, 68-68, with 45 seconds to go. After Bulgaria took the lead in the final 
seconds, USD took two shots but missed both. Polina Tzekova had 20 points for 
Bulgaria but fouled out with 2:49 left. Chris Enger was the only other scorer 
in double figures for USD. She had 10 points in 21 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased that we came back," USD Coach Kathy Marpe said. "That was the 
key. I liked the way we adjusted to the game." JIM LINDGREN

NORTON SUCCEEDS ENGER AS PIERCE HEAD FOOTBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Norton, an assistant football coach at Pierce College for the past two 
seasons, has been hired to replace Head Coach Bob Enger, who announced his 
resignation Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Norton, 43, was introduced as the new Brahma coach at a press conference at 
Pierce on Monday, three days after Pierce's final game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came here two years ago, my goal was to become the head football coach 
at Pierce College," Norton said. "So I'm excited. I think this program is 
headed in the right direction. . . . I think Pierce is a potential gold mine." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce had a 9-21 record under Enger, 55, who took over in 1988 after the 
school had not fielded a team in the previous two seasons due to budgetary 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Norton was an assistant at Glendale College in 1987 and 1988 before coming to 
Pierce. He was head coach at Palmdale High from 1984-86 and at Bishop 
Montgomery High from 1977-83. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery advanced to the Northwestern Conference championship in 1983, 
losing to Canyon, 40-24. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce has posted 4-6 records in the past two seasons after finishing 1-9 in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't improve in the win-loss column this season," Norton said. "But we 
were a much better team. We played several teams much closer this year than we 
did last year." 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield, the No. 1-ranked team in J. C. Grid-Wire national poll, came from 
behind to defeat the Brahmas, 38-35, in a Western State Conference finale 
Friday, when Renegade kicker Jon Baker hit a 47-yard field goal with one second 
left.

Injuries continue to plague the Chargers' offensive backfield. Running back 
Marion Butts suffered a knee strain in Sunday's 27-10 to Kansas City, though it 
doesn't appear he will miss next week's game against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Rod Bernstine, who shares duties with Butts, played only a few downs 
Sunday before taking himself out. Bernstine missed last Sunday's game against 
Denver after sustaining a hamstring injury during practice the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the mend is quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver, who played the second half 
of Sunday's game with both a groin strain and a knee strain. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fine," Tolliver said. "The groin's a little stiff, the knee is fine. All 
us fast guys have those problems with our muscles getting pulled all the time." 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Tolliver's time in the 40-yard dash is 5.0. 
</P>
<P>
The linebackers aren't in great shape either. Junior Seau suffered a groin pull 
in practice last week and sprained his ankle in Sunday's game, and Richard 
Brown and Cedric Figaro both have hamstring strains. 
</P>
<P>
After Charger players finished their meetings Monday morning, they spent the 
afternoon boxing food and distributing it to needy families around the county. 
For the second year in a row, safety Martin Bayless organized the project. 
</P>
<P>
Bayless got the idea from his days in Buffalo, where he played for the Bills 
from 1984-86. 
</P>
<P>
"In Buffalo, a lot of the veteran players would get together and raise money," 
Bayless said. "We're here to play football, and that's our number one job. But 
during the holiday season it's awfully nice to go out and be able to meet a lot 
of people and touch some hearts of people who really need help in this 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver took part in Monday's food distribution. A reporter asked him if he 
was booed by anybody he visited. 
</P>
<P>
He laughed, and then told the story of his first NFL start last season against 
Seattle. His parents were in town. He played and was yanked midway through the 
game after a subpar performance. That night, his father had a chat with him. 
</P>
<P>
"He just looked at me and said: 'You're a flop, aren't you?' " Tolliver said. 
"That's my dad. I guess if I can handle it from my dad I can handle the fans."

Fast Book or Fast Buck?: Bret Easton Ellis' gruesome novel, "American Psycho," 
was scooped up quickly by a new publisher after being dropped by Simon &amp; 
Schuster. Alfred A. Knopf is rushing the book into print while it is still hot. 
</P>
<P>
Simon &amp; Schuster dropped the book because of lurid descriptions of 
dismemberment and torture of women by a deranged yuppie. Knopf President Sonny 
Mehta said Ellis has merely "written a novel depicting aspects of a society 
that he and the rest of us are living in." 
</P>
<P>
Banzai: Thousands of people carrying lanterns and waving flags thronged to the 
Imperial Palace in Tokyo over the weekend to celebrate Emperor Akihito's 
enthronement. Akihito, accompanied by Empress Michiko, waved to the crowds from 
a palace balcony, then waved lanterns as the crowd, 47,000 strong, shouted 
"Tenno heika banzai," or "Long live the emperor." Akihito is the first Japanese 
monarch enthroned as a symbol and not a living god.

Homecoming: As little girls squealed and a high school pep band played, Gina 
Marie Tolleson made her triumphant return home to Spartanburg, S.C., as the new 
Miss World. "I'm just really, really touched," said the 21-year-old student 
Sunday after being crowned Nov. 8 in London. As to the future, that's 
uncertain, except that, "I'm not interested in being a movie star or film 
star," said Tolleson, who is studying broadcast journalism at the University of 
Georgia.

Emergency Ambulance: U.S. Rep. Barney Frank's quick response when he suffered a 
mild heart attack prevented more serious problems, a doctor says. The 
50-year-old Massachusetts Democrat had a taxi rush him Saturday night to a 
hospital after he suffered chest pains while exercising at a health club. 
Doctors performed an angioplasty to clear a blocked artery to the heart, and 
the congressman was resting comfortably Monday.

JACK SMITH: MENUS WRITTEN IN STONE: DINERS OFTEN JUST BITE THE BULLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JACK SMITH

<TEXT>
<P>
The stubbornness of restaurants in refusing to depart from fixed menus seems to 
have generated a subculture of anecdotes. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, many of the stories I have received concern eggs and toast. These 
breakfast staples may be served in various ways, but the chef will not vary the 
listed combinations to suit a willful customer. 
</P>
<P>
One story, sent to me by Harold M. Koenigsberg of Beverly Hills, is an excerpt 
from Ernie Pyle's "Home Country." Pyle went into a coffee shop in Carmel and 
ordered orange juice, one egg, medium boiled, crisp bacon, dry toast and 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
The waitress told him: "That would be No. 3, but No. 3 is a poached egg. You 
can't substitute." 
</P>
<P>
Pyle said he was not ordering a number, he was ordering what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
The waitress said: "But the cook won't boil one egg. He'll poach one, but not 
boil one." 
</P>
<P>
Pyle asked how much his breakfast would be a la carte. The waitress left to 
talk to the chef. She returned and said: "The cook won't boil one egg under any 
circumstances, for any price." 
</P>
<P>
"And so I left," Pyle wrote, "my vexation completely overshadowed by my 
admiration for such a man." 
</P>
<P>
W. E. Easton recalls a comic scene that befell a bed and breakfast in London 
when his wife ordered a boiled egg with bacon. The waitress, an au pair, said 
bacon was served only with fried eggs, not boiled eggs. Thinking the au pair 
was French, Mrs. Easton pursued her point in French, only to discover that the 
waitress was Spanish, which further complicated the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists at other tables were soon involved. Not understanding any of the three 
languages thus far employed, a group of Germans was thoroughly confused, but no 
less voluble. The proprietress appeared. A British woman offered her services. 
Apprised of the question, she said that if a person ordered a boiled egg with 
bacon in her home she would not serve it. 
</P>
<P>
Easton solved the problem by ordering a fried egg with bacon and sharing the 
bacon with his wife. This subterfuge was viewed with mixed reactions by the 
other guests. 
</P>
<P>
An even more ingenious solution was hit upon by Walt Hopmans of Santa Barbara 
when he asked for hot cakes and eggs and the waitress said, "How do you want 
your eggs?" 
</P>
<P>
Hopmans said he didn't care. "Why don't you just surprise me?" 
</P>
<P>
The waitress insisted. "I can't take your order, sir, unless you tell me how 
you want your eggs." 
</P>
<P>
Hopmans said he'd take his eggs the way the waitress would take them. She said 
she didn't eat eggs. 
</P>
<P>
"OK," Hopmans said. "I'll take one scrambled and one sunny side up." 
</P>
<P>
That's the way he got them. "But she had her revenge. They were cold." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Emmey recalls an incident when she and her boyfriend were walking along 
the ocean front walk in Venice, watching the dancers, listening to the music, 
dabbling in the shops. 
</P>
<P>
"We noticed a sign on the sidewalk. 'Free pretzel when you buy a lemonade.' My 
boyfriend walked up to the window and ordered a pretzel. After he paid, he said 
'Where's my lemonade?' Their reply: "If you order a lemonade we'll give you a 
free pretzel, but if you order a pretzel you have to pay for the lemonade.' " 
</P>
<P>
I can understand that if the lemonade cost more than the pretzel. 
</P>
<P>
Morton Moskowitz recalls stopping at a coffee shop in Sequoia National Park 
about 30 years ago. His daughter ordered a jelly sandwich. The menu listed only 
peanut butter and jelly. Moskowitz offered to pay for a peanut butter and jelly 
sandwich if they would hold the peanut butter. The waitress said that could not 
be done. Finally they ordered some toast, which came with butter and jelly. "We 
never used the butter and my daughter had her jelly sandwich." 
</P>
<P>
A similar gambit failed Jim Webber in a beautiful restaurant in Boothbay 
Harbor, Me. He ordered a lobster dinner with iced tea. The waitress told him 
the dinner came only with hot tea or coffee. Webber ordered hot tea and a tall 
glass of ice. The waitress told him, "We do not permit substitutes." 
</P>
<P>
Chalk one up for the system. 
</P>
<P>
The system also overwhelmed Emma Adler before World War II when she was a 
student at UCLA. With a group of six students she stopped at Dolores' Drive-In 
on Wilshire at La Cienega. Having studied logic under Dr. Hans Reichenback they 
agreed that if they all ordered the same thing they should have no trouble 
getting the order straight. 
</P>
<P>
They ordered hamburgers, fries and six Cokes. When the order came it was six 
grilled cheese sandwiches and six milks. "We informed the waitress of the 
mistake, and she, without blinking an eye, informed us that the order she 
delivered was more nutritious. Needless to say we ate what we were served." 
</P>
<P>
When I patronized Dolores', before World War II, the waitresses were not known 
for their maternal instincts. 
</P>
<P>
I wish we had that drive-in back. 
</P>
<P>
There's a question for Dr. Reichenback and his colleagues. What caused the 
demise of drive-ins?

The government could save $274.1 billion in medical costs in the year 2000 by 
regulating fees and replacing private insurance companies with universal public 
coverage, consumer groups said. A report by Families USA Foundation and Citizen 
Action said doctors and hospitals could cuts costs by eliminating unnecessary 
treatment and holding down increases in providers' income. A spokesman for the 
Health Insurance Assn. of America, a private insurers' group, said in a 
statement that a system funded and administered by the government would lead to 
health care rationing and would be costly.

Charline Chable Rotondo, 78, a member of the French underground who was honored 
with the Medal of Freedom for helping save American fliers from the Nazis. She 
was the first foreign-born woman to receive the Medal of Freedom, America's

American fliers from the Nazis during World War II. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower 
presented the medal in Paris in 1945, after Rotondo escaped from the Germans,

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Herbert B. Maw, 97, who served two terms as governor of Utah in the 1940s. Maw 
was born in 1893, in Ogden, the Territory of Deseret, three years before Utah 
became a state. 
</P>
<P>
He received a law degree from the University of Utah in 1916 and a doctorate 
from Northwestern University in 1927. During World War I, Maw served as a pilot 
and was among the Army's first Mormon chaplains. A Democrat, he was elected to 
the Utah Senate in 1930 and won the governorship in 1940. At 93, Maw was still 
practicing law, often for free to those who could not afford legal services. In 
an interview in 1984, he said he walked three miles a day, a habit from the 
days when he could not afford a streetcar ride. In Salt Lake City on Saturday.

BUCHANAN ON IRAQ CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his typically arrogant fashion, Patrick Buchanan again attacks America and 
the democratic concepts we stand for ("We Still Don't Know Why We Must Fight," 
Column Right, Commentary, Nov. 12). 
</P>
<P>
He asks what vital interests of ours are threatened by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
I realize that Buchanan considers himself an expert on political matters, but 
his failure to consider historical events and precedents greatly lowers his 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Can Buchanan name even one military dictator who has ever been stopped, or even 
discouraged, by appeasement? Of course not. Putting the Middle East in the 
hands of Saddam Hussein would result in the slavery of countless Arabs and 
their states. It would make the world's largest oil reserves subject to 
blackmail, which could result in the economic destruction of Western Europe, 
Japan and even possibly ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan asks, if the destruction of Iraq's war machine is achieved, will that 
bring stability? Probably not, in the sense that we'd like it to be. That 
region hasn't really been "stable" for thousands of years. But is this any 
reason not to continue attempts in that direction? 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan should know better than to be duped by the Arabists into attacking his 
nation's attempt to defend Western civilization and to prevent the Mideast 
crisis from flaring up into a catastrophic world war.

trenchant of comments by Ronald Reagan, "When you've seen one redwood, you've 
seen them all!" Any hope that the timber industry can be shamed into reining in 
its greed and leaving untouched what remains of this ancient forest is pure 
wishful thinking. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing left for us to do for our children and grandchildren is to 
add one more game to our state lottery: This game would take bets on the date 
that the last redwood in that forest would be felled. At least our schools 
would be given a share of the money wagered!

SEN. JESSE HELMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks to Huntington Williams (Opinion, Nov. 11), we now understand Sen. Jesse 
Helms (R-N.C.). 
</P>
<P>
First, Helms wants to limit the power of government except for pork-barrel 
items for his state and government policies which encourage school 
resegregation. 
</P>
<P>
Second, Helms believes in the sanctity of private property except for women. 
Third, Helms believes in individual responsibility and so wants to abrogate 
social safety net programs, thus allowing those now covered to fall by the 
wayside. Fourth, Helms believes in charities except for endowments to the arts 
and to charities servicing those with a lesser right-wing tilt, using his 
perspective. Williams says that Helms represents a large and growing 
constituency that extends beyond North Carolina. No wonder the country is in 
trouble.

<P>
You are certainly correct in your view that something needs to be done about 
the monster initiatives (editorial Nov. 12). However, your fine editorial 
failed to mention one small remedy that would make the monster much easier to 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Make it illegal to pay people to collect signatures for the initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
This would eliminate initiatives designed to protect financial interests -- 
certainly at least all the "poison pill" initiatives. In fact, it would likely 
have eliminated at least three-quarters of the initiatives from the last 
ballot. One initiative designed to promote the logging industry was called 
protection for our forests. 
</P>
<P>
If the people who designed and understood the real purpose of the initiative 
also had to put in the time collecting signatures, laws protecting financial 
interests would be limited to their traditional champions -- the politicians. 
This solution might not turn the monster into a pussycat, but it would 
certainly shrink it to much more manageable proportions.

COURT HEADS IN A DARK DIRECTION; 
</P>
<P>
CNN RULING MEANS PRESS HAS LESS FREEDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court, ignoring its own precedents, has let stand a federal judge's 
gag order forbidding Cable News Network from broadcasting tapes of Manuel 
Noriega's jailhouse telephone conversations. The court offered no explanation 
for its stunning and potentially far-reaching decision. Its 7-2 vote, refusing 
both CNN's emergency request to lift the stay and its appeal on the merits of 
the gag order, means that for now at least the effort to deny CNN its right of 
free speech remains in force. 
</P>
<P>
Let there be no mistake about it. The ultimate loser in all this is the public, 
for it is the people's essential liberties that the First Amendment is intended 
to protect. 
</P>
<P>
The highest judicial authority in the land has approved the notion that a court 
can censor newspapers, magazines or broadcasters in advance of publication -- 
on a finding that the right to free speech may be outweighed by another claimed 
right. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers call this form of censorship "prior restraint." The Supreme Court 
specifically considered it in a 1976 Nebraska case. At that time the court 
unanimously struck down a gag order issued by a Nebraska judge who sought to 
bar pretrial publication of an alleged murderer's confession. 
</P>
<P>
The judge thought publication might make a fair trial impossible. The Supreme 
Court held that this possibility was insufficient to justify prior restraint. 
The court said that gag orders may only be used as a last resort -- with judges 
obligated first to consider less drastic measures. 
</P>
<P>
Judge William M. Hoeveler ordered CNN to stop playing the Noriega jailhouse 
tapes on the air due to the outside possibility that they might prejudice the 
former Panamanian dictator's right to a fair trial. But there was virtually no 
showing of need behind this order, or any apparent consideration that less 
drastic measures might suffice. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for himself and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, 
the other dissenter to Sunday's decision, went right to the heart of the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Our precedents," said Marshall, "make unmistakably clear that any prior 
restraint of expression comes to this court bearing a heavy presumption against 
its constitutional validity and that the proponent of this drastic remedy 
carries a heavy burden of showing justification for its imposition. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not see how the prior restraint imposed in this case can be reconciled 
with these teachings . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It's possible that Judge Hoeveler, after listening to the tapes in CNN's 
possession, will lift his gag order. Even then, a dangerous precedent allowing 
courts to temporarily silence the press will have been set, inviting judges to 
invoke prior restraint on the most problematical of claims. 
</P>
<P>
It's by no means inconceivable that "temporary" censorship could be used to 
deny the public timely information about official misconduct, financial 
manipulations, threats to public health and safety. Justice Marshall is right. 
This is a case of "extraordinary consequences for freedom of the press," and, 
by extension, for American liberties.

THE ICE FINALLY MELTS; 
</P>
<P>
BUT FORMAL END TO COLD WAR COMPETES FOR ATTENTION WITH MIDEAST THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The end of the Cold War was put in writing Monday at a gathering as momentous 
as any in civilized history. 
</P>
<P>
But the Paris meeting that formally called off a past dominated by armed 
confrontation in Europe had to compete for attention with a fitful future. 
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, for example, both 
noted that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait threatens the peace that the treaty 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
And while the superpowers declared themselves partners under the treaty, 
Gorbachev again declined to pledge support for the use of force to drive Iraq 
out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the chief business of what Bush called "a glorious day for Europe" was 
the signing by the 16 nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the 
six members of the Warsaw Pact of an agreement that could compete for attention 
with anything. In the next four years, it will strip Europe of tens of 
thousands of tanks, armored vehicles, artillery pieces and aircraft. Formal 
limits on troop levels will be negotiated starting late this week, although the 
collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and its failure in the Soviet Union 
would leave Europe free of Moscow's forces by 1994 under any circumstances. 
Agreements also will be negotiated on aerial inspections to verify that East 
and West are abiding by troop and arms limits. In sum, the treaty ends the 
turmoil Europe has known since the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
That done, another 12 European counties joined the 22 signers of the arms 
treaty Monday for yet another meeting, this one of the Conference on Security 
and Cooperation in Europe. Its discussions will try to avert conflicts not just 
between nations, but among peoples whose animosities are rooted in 
centuries-old tribal rancor. It will also try to keep East European politics 
open and free while the arms-control treaty suppresses the military threat. 
</P>
<P>
The intrusion of the Middle East did not ruin Europe's celebration. It may even 
be a useful reminder that, even while hoping for the best, it helps to prepare 
for the worst.

BUCHANAN ON IRAQ CRISIS

<TEXT>
<P>
As a perennial Buchanan-basher I never dreamed I would be writing this letter 
in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
But I am delighted! Not with his every word of course, but with his general 
conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
In our last two wars in Korea and Vietnam, we wasted thousands of lives first 
and then we sat down and talked for thousands of hours. Why don't we reverse 
the procedure for this one? Let us talk with the "madman" for as long as it 
takes, even while he's in Kuwait. I don't think the future dead will mind the 
delay a bit. 
</P>
<P>
Talk is cheap; it's our children's lives that are expensive.

Congratulations to the voters of California who voted no on the 
professional/radical environmentalist Props. 128 and 130. 
</P>
<P>
You showed that just tacking the word "environment" on to bad law won't get it 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
Now that we've cleaned up the trash, maybe we rational environmentalists can 
get to work on the many real environmental problems we have here in California.

WORLD SPORTS SCENE; 
</P>
<P>
10-YEAR-OLD MIGHT MEET HER MATCH ON TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Television talk show host David Letterman wants to take a shot at a 10-year-old 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
Her name is Natasha Dennis, the goalkeeper for an under-12 girls' soccer team 
in Lewisville, Tex., who received worldwide attention when two fathers of 
children from another team wanted to check her gender. She said someone should 
check between their ears. Touche. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Letterman would like to put her in goal on his show and see whether she's 
a match for him. 
</P>
<P>
Calling her with advice last week was the goalkeeper for the U.S. national 
team, Tony Meola, who is playing this season for Watford in the English League. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to encourage her," he said by telephone from England. "It's her 
generation that's going to help make soccer popular in the United States, and I 
didn't want her to be discouraged by an unfortunate situation." 
</P>
<P>
Also participating in the call to Natasha was John Harkes, a midfielder for the 
U.S. team who plays for Sheffield Wednesday in the English League. The call was 
arranged by Harkes' agent, Shelli Azoff of Beverly Hills. Meola and Harkes were 
teammates on junior teams in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Natasha about a girl who played on one of our teams," Meola said. 
"There was a lot of controversy because she was the only girl in the league. 
There were no teams then for girls. But she stuck with the sport and became an 
All-American at Rutgers." 
</P>
<P>
Meola wouldn't reveal the advice that he gave to Dennis about defending against 
Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a secret," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement last week that Du Pont has bailed out the professional cycling 
race on the East Coast that formerly was known as the Tour de Trump by signing 
a three-year sponsorship agreement was not good news in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
The May 9-19 Tour Du Pont will coincide with the final 11 days of the Tour of 
Spain. That race has been considered the third most prestigious behind the Tour 
de France and the Tour of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
But Michael Plant, executive director of the Du Pont race, said that he has 
heard from a number of top teams that are considering competing in the United 
States instead of Spain despite a significant difference in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Spanish are very intimidated by what we're doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In its third year, the U.S. race already has the fourth-largest purse, with 
cash and merchandise prizes equal to $250,000. Spain offers $450,000. But Plant 
said cyclists prefer to race in the United States because of the amenities. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you rather come here and stay in first-class hotels every night or go to 
Spain and sleep in gyms?" said the U.S. race's publicist, Steve Brunner. 
</P>
<P>
Plant, a former speedskater who serves as chairman of the U.S. Olympic 
Committee's Athletes Advisory Council, recently returned from a one-day visit 
to Cuba with two other former U.S. athletes, swimmer Mary T. Meagher and 
weightlifter Bruce Wilhelm. 
</P>
<P>
Like a seven-member group from the Canadian Olympic Assn. that also recently 
toured Cuba, Plant said that he and his two companions were satisfied with the 
Cubans' preparations for next summer's Pan American Games in Havana and 
Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he will deliver a positive report to the U.S. sports federations, 
which will meet in Chicago on Dec. 1 to discuss the situation. Anticipating 
substandard living and playing conditions, officials in some sports have 
indicated reluctance to send athletes to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on what we saw, there is no reason for the USOC to take a position of 
not going to the Pan American Games," Plant said. "If some individual sports 
decide not to go, that's their decision. But I don't think there's any 
legitimate excuse." 
</P>
<P>
The USOC's unprecedented decision to suspend funding to one of its governing 
bodies, the Bobsled and Skeleton Federation, could cost the federation as much 
as $400,000, about half its annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
In its investigation into alleged financial improprieties, the USOC learned 
from one member of the federation's board of directors, John Miller, that there 
has been no detailed treasurer's report for years. Miller told the Associated 
Press that former treasurer Jean Chaintreuil once stood before an annual 
meeting and read from a piece of crumpled paper that he had pulled from his 
pocket. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the report," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
The British Amateur Athletic Board is campaigning to have athletes who test 
positive for anabolic steroids suspended for four years. "It only seems like 
yesterday since (Ben) Johnson got banned, and he will return to competition 
amid a lot of hype," said Tony Ward, spokesman for the BAAB. He criticized 
International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch and 
International Amateur Athletic Federation President Primo Nebiolo for sending 
welcome-back messages to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The International Equestrian Federation has recommended that its competition at 
the 1992 Summer Olympics remain in Barcelona despite an African equine fever 
that has spread into southern Spain and killed more than 1,200 horses in three 
years. The FEI considered moving the equestrian events to another European 
city, but the European Commission's veterinary experts found that the area 
around Barcelona was free of the sickness. . . . In France's biggest sports 
scandal, Jean Claude-Darmon, the promotions director of the French soccer 
federation, was charged last Friday with forgery, receiving stolen goods and 
misappropriation of funds. After his release on bail of $200,000, he made a 
brief stop at a Marseilles synagogue to pray, then boarded a plane for an 
unknown destination. 
</P>
<P>
Sampdoria of Genoa remained in first place in soccer's Italian League after a 
4-1 victory Sunday on the road against Maradona's Naples team, the defending 
champion. Salvatore Schillaci, Italy's World Cup hero, scored three goals in 
Juventus of Turin's 5-0 victory over AS Roma. In Italy's version of the 
USC-UCLA game, Inter-Milan beat AC Milan, 1-0. . . . A team of part-timers from 
the Irish League almost upset the English League professionals in an all-star 
game last week. Queen's Park Rangers forward Roy Wegerle, a South African who 
wants to play for the United States in the 1994 World Cup and is trying to 
obtain U.S. citizenship, spared the English embarrassment by scoring with 30 
minutes remaining in the 1-1 draw.

THE PREPS: LONE STATISTIC THEY KEEP TRACK OF AT SERRA IS 9-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In today's world of high school football, statistics are frequently overrated. 
</P>
<P>
Too often, the importance of statistics seems to outweigh the game itself. 
Players, coaches and fans are usually up to the minute on the rushing or 
passing statistics from a prep game. 
</P>
<P>
But at Serra High in Gardena, keeping data on the football team is taboo. Over 
the past two seasons, the only mark documented by the Cavaliers is their 
winning streak, which reached 23 games with a 34-21 opening-round victory over 
Mission Viejo Trabuco Hills in the Southern Section Division VII playoffs last 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't keep stats," Serra Coach Leo Hand said. "What we stress is team 
unselfishness, and statistics do not play a part in our philosophy. We know 
that we're different and that we are on a different page, but we think that it 
is a healthy one." 
</P>
<P>
That philosophy has been successful for Hand, who last year brought winning 
football back to Serra, which last had a winning season in 1984. In his first 
season, Hand led the Cavaliers to a 34-31 victory over Lompoc in the Division 
VII championship game to finish with 14-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Serra defended its Camino Real League title and is 9-0. The 
Cavaliers, The Times' 15th-ranked team, have the longest current winning streak 
in the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
"This system, where we have no superstars, has worked for us," Hand said. "The 
kids believe in it because they have seen it work. We talk all of the time 
about unselfishness. When we have our first practice of the year, every player 
starts out at right guard, which is probably the most unglamorous position on 
the team. He can't play for us if he is not willing to be a team player." 
</P>
<P>
Serra, though, has several talented players who have caught the attention of 
college scouts. But when the scouts visit the campus, they find no statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"I have heard that by not keeping stats, we are being unfair to the kids," Hand 
said. "But the recruiting process is not based on stats. It is based on ability 
and not high school statistics. Coaches pad stats all of the time and sometimes 
that is more of an injustice. People know who the players are." 
</P>
<P>
One of the players who has flourished in Hand's system is senior running back 
Jerald Henry. In the victory over Trabuco Hills, Henry rushed for 351 yards in 
21 carries -- reporters kept those statistics -- and ran 78 yards for the 
clinching touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Henry is a great player who will probably go to any college he wants to," Hand 
said. "But, he is more of a team-oriented player than a superstar. Some games 
he might get the ball 20 times, and then in another he might get it twice, 
depending on what the defense gives us." 
</P>
<P>
In one game this season, Henry scored five touchdowns in only seven carries. 
</P>
<P>
Hand, who coached at Anaheim Servite before taking over at Serra, said that the 
Cavaliers have been more fortunate than good the past two seasons. The school 
is all-boys this year with an enrollment near 300 but will become co-ed next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"At this stage, our program is in good shape, but we need to improve," Hand 
said. "Nearly one out of every four students is playing football. We've been 
lucky in that we have not had injuries, but we've also been successful in 
developing our players academically. 
</P>
<P>
"For our program to get better, we have to continue our dedication with 
academics because football games are always won and lost, but you'll always 
need academics." 
</P>
<P>
Serra, top-seeded in the Division VII playoffs, plays at La Mirada Friday in 
the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Further proof that the Southern Section needs to reduce the number of teams 
qualifying for its football playoffs is contained in the results of first-round 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Most noticeable in Fontana's 56-6 victory over Palmdale, the average margin of 
victory in the eight Division I games was a staggering 30.3 points, with no 
game decided by fewer than three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Routs also were common in the lower divisions, such as Mission Viejo's 56-15 
thrashing of Arcadia in Division II, and Anaheim Esperanza's 47-6 victory over 
Alhambra in Division III. 
</P>
<P>
Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
The biggest upset in the first-round of the Southern Section playoffs was 
Riverside Rubidoux's 44-19 victory over Huntington Beach Edison. Edison (9-1), 
the Sunset League champion, was seeded fourth in Division I. Rubidoux (4-6) 
finished third in the Citrus Belt League. . . . Other surprises included 
Lynwood (5-5) defeating Marmonte League champion Thousand Oaks, 31-27, and 
Beverly Hills (5-5) over Foothill League champion Schurr, 29-28. 
</P>
<P>
The City playoffs begin Wednesday night with first-round games in the 4-A and 
3-A divisions. The top four seeds in 4-A -- Carson, Banning, Dorsey and Granada 
Hills -- all have byes.

Dominicans angry over the government's economic austerity program paralyzed 
much of the country on the first day of a three-day general strike. Seven 
people were reported wounded in clashes and bombings, and about 100 protesters 
were arrested. Schools and businesses were closed, and thousands of people were 
without public transportation.

MISHAPS SET SUMMIT TONE FOR PRESIDENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's started off as that sort of summit for President Bush: Not only did the 
Soviets balk at his Persian Gulf policy, but his limousine sideswiped a palace, 
the fuses blew in his embassy and the Germans upstaged him at the ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the blown fuse was a bad omen for Bush's meeting with Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The Soviet chief had barely entered the palatial 
residence of U.S. Ambassador Walter J. P. Curley on the Champs Elysees and sat 
down for a photo opportunity with Bush on Monday night when, suddenly, there 
went the lights. 
</P>
<P>
The strain of dozens of television lamps may have been to blame for the outage, 
but some embassy officials blamed a short-circuit in the kitchen of the huge 
19th-Century mansion. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the car, Bush's presidential limousine. The armor-plated, 
specially wired, ultra-sophisticated machine is constructed to withstand 
virtually any assault or catastrophe -- except, apparently, bad driving. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night, when Bush's motorcade pulled into the U.S. Embassy, the 
President's driver made too tight a turn into the building's entrance and 
smashed the door handles on the car's right side. 
</P>
<P>
The backup limousine, dutifully following the leader, apparently suffered the 
same fate, Administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, these are no ordinary door handles. Like everything else on the $600,000 
automobile the White House bought last year -- one of several presidential 
limousines the government flies by military transport to carry the President 
wherever he travels -- the door handles are made with security in mind. 
</P>
<P>
They are specially constructed to ensure that if a crowd ever attacked the car, 
it could not force open the doors. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that, fixing the battered handle was not simply a matter of driving 
down the Champs Elysees to the neighborhood station de reparations. Instead, 
the call went out to Federal Express to deliver new door handles across the 
Atlantic from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Cars, of course, are a major part of any summit. While the details of 
documents, declarations and diplomacy may occupy the time of higher-level 
officials, most of the people who staff a summit -- from police to protocol 
officers -- spend their days making sure the world leaders simply get where 
they need to be. 
</P>
<P>
And get there in correct style. At least most of the time. The French, who are 
hosting the summit, provided Renault and Peugeot sedans for lesser leaders who 
did not have their own vehicles flown in. The elegant cars came complete with 
national flags. 
</P>
<P>
All 36 delegations at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe got 
one -- 34 nations, the European Community and the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Hungarian delegation showed up at the Elysee Palace for lunch 
Monday, the flag on its car was flying upside down. 
</P>
<P>
And some delegations apparently found the Renaults insufficient for their 
needs. In addition to Bush and Gorbachev, who both brought their own custom 
limos to Paris, and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who brought a 
Rolls-Royce across the English Channel, the delegation from Liechtenstein 
showed up driving a Jaguar. 
</P>
<P>
Getting there on time is also a major issue. Protocol demands that officials 
arrive at events in a certain order. At the ceremony Monday morning to sign the 
treaty limiting conventional arms in Europe, protocol dictated that heads of 
government -- prime ministers and the like -- should arrive first, followed by 
heads of state -- presidents and such. 
</P>
<P>
That gave Bush the right to arrive last, the most desired spot because the last 
person gets to keep everyone else waiting and perhaps get the most media 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Things didn't work out that way for him, though. 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived, accompanied by his top aides and Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), 
the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee -- political protocol 
matters, too -- all the leaders were there but one. 
</P>
<P>
Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl showed up late. Some European leaders have 
been complaining about the new assertiveness of German officials ever since the 
unification of the formerly divided East and West. But German officials 
insisted that Kohl's tardiness was the result of an innocent problem: His 
motorcade got stuck in traffic, they said. 
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, when time came to arrive for lunch at the Elysee Palace, the 
seat of France's presidency, Kohl made up for his morning tardiness by arriving 
first. 
</P>
<P>
But as the official greeter, French protocol chief Andre Gadaud, stepped out to 
shake his hand, Kohl, who is running for reelection as chancellor, spied a 
German television crew. Turning his back on Gadaud, he made a beeline for the 
cameras, holding a quick press conference while palace functionaries, decked 
out in dark blue tail coats, vermilion vests, white tie and gloves, milled 
around looking nervous. 
</P>
<P>
After a few minutes, Kohl finished his photo opportunity and said hello to his 
greeters. About 45 minutes and 34 greetings later, Bush arrived. The new door 
handles worked, and he stepped out onto the palace's gravel courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the last?" he asked Gadaud. 
</P>
<P>
"You're the last," Gadaud confirmed.

MIDEAST CRISIS: BUSH'S LONG LOBBYING EFFORT FAILS. AIDES SAY THEY WILL PUT THE 
PROPOSED U.N. RESOLUTION ON HOLD. SOVIETS REGARD IT AS PREMATURE.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, despite almost a month of intense lobbying, failed Monday to 
win endorsement from Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for a new United 
Nations resolution authorizing a military offensive in the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had counted heavily on obtaining Gorbachev's blessing of a tough new U.N. 
measure, but a Soviet spokesman made it clear Monday night that Gorbachev still 
considers a military offensive premature. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's failure to win the Soviet leader's support, combined with the alarm 
expressed in Congress last week when he ordered the dispatch of more than 
200,000 additional American troops to the gulf, sharply reduces the President's 
freedom to orchestrate the confrontation with Iraq's Saddam Hussein or control 
the pace of events. 
</P>
<P>
It is potentially even more damaging for Bush, whose handling of the crisis is 
already slipping badly in public opinion polls, to have sought and failed to 
win Soviet support for a tougher line on the opening day of the Paris summit. 
This may strengthen the hand of critics who say he is rushing precipitously 
toward war. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials indicated determination to continue pressing Moscow 
for its support on the resolution. And Gorbachev, even before his meeting with 
Bush, suggested that this may not be his final position on the sensitive issue. 
</P>
<P>
But the setback posed both diplomatic and political problems for the American 
President. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater sought to put the best face on the 
development after Bush and Gorbachev completed a lengthy dinner meeting at the 
U.S. ambassador's residence. He insisted that Moscow remains unwavering in its 
support for the existing U.N. sanctions and condemnation of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
And the Soviets continued to agree with Bush that a resort to military force 
cannot be ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
"We are unified on this issue," said Fitzwater, who added that in their 
discussions the two leaders "were concentrating on the areas we were together 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Both countries, he said, agree that aggression cannot be rewarded, both seek 
the immediate release of all hostages, and both believe that it is time to 
discuss the gulf crisis further in the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the failure to win an endorsement Monday for a new U.N. resolution was a 
clear setback for Bush, who had worked tirelessly in recent days to line up 
support not only from Gorbachev but from the leaders of other nations belonging 
to the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials claimed privately that they had assurances of support 
from at least seven of the Council's 15 members, and Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III plans to visit three others in the next four days. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev was to be the capstone on the U.S. drive. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Administration officials say, they will have to put the tougher resolution 
on hold while they renew their efforts to win over the Soviets and reassure 
domestic opinion in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials say Bush has not decided whether to go to war against 
Iraq but considers the U.N. resolution vital in his campaign to ratchet up the 
pressure on Hussein and reaffirm international support for a military attack to 
drive Iraq out of Kuwait if, in the end, economic sanctions fail to force him 
to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
The White House, obviously anticipating success with the Soviet leader, moved 
the only formally scheduled Bush-Gorbachev meeting from a breakfast on Tuesday 
to a dinner on Monday. And officials told reporters to be prepared for a joint 
press conference by Bush and Gorbachev, the format normally used for announcing 
major agreements. 
</P>
<P>
Some told reporters privately that they were confident of success. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, after the dinner, Fitzwater appeared in the temporary White House 
briefing room here along with Vitaly N. Ignatenko, Gorbachev's press secretary, 
and offered a bare-bones summary of the dinner meeting. When asked why the two 
leaders had failed to appear as previously announced, Fitzwater said it had 
been a long day for Bush and Gorbachev and they had "confidence in their 
spokesmen." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater declared that the two leaders had reached "a conceptual agreement 
that force cannot be ruled out" if sanctions fail to compel Hussein to withdraw 
his troops from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Gorbachev in the past has said publicly that force cannot be ruled out, 
but he has repeatedly cautioned that sanctions should be given time to work. 
Further, the Soviets have expressed fears that a war with Iraq not only would 
result in heavy casualties but would be disastrous economically and 
environmentally. 
</P>
<P>
Ignatenko called the dialogue between the two leaders "very important and 
useful" but said the existing U.N. resolutions and sanctions have not been 
given enough time to work and that additional consultations still must be held 
by Secretary of State Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, meanwhile, continues to try to line up support in the Security Council 
for a new resolution authorizing a military offensive. He leaves Wednesday to 
seek the support of other members of the Security Council -- Yemen, Colombia 
and Malaysia -- for the proposal even though Fitzwater insisted that "a 
decision on the U.N. resolution has not been made." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Hussein's announcement in Baghdad on Monday that he is 
dispatching another 250,000 troops to Kuwait is another example of "his 
thumbing his nose at the U.N. resolution" and shows that he "has no intention 
of a peaceful resolution . . . a treacherous course to take." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush-Gorbachev meeting came during the three-day meeting of the 34-nation 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which ends here Wednesday. On 
Monday the two leaders joined the leaders of 20 other countries -- 15 belonging 
to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and five members of the Warsaw Pact 
-- in signing a sweeping non-nuclear or conventional arms reduction treaty 
calling for the destruction of tens of thousands of tanks and other weapons. 
</P>
<P>
At a brief press conference Monday morning, Bush, in answering a reporter's 
question, said he saw no irony in the fact that international forces headed by 
the United States were aligned against the Iraqi army at the same time the 
historic arms reduction treaty was being signed and peace was being celebrated 
in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"What I see," he said, "is the fact that we are able to enter into a CFE 
(Conventional Forces in Europe) agreement with full cooperation and support of 
the Soviet Union, who heretofore has been an enormous adversary of the West, 
and this now reduces to practically nil the tensions that have existed. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the farthest-reaching arms control agreement in history," Bush 
continued, "and it signals the world order that is emerging . . . and that is 
the best hope for rolling back the brutality and the aggression of Saddam 
Hussein, who has nothing to do with the CFE agreement." 
</P>
<P>
The message to the Iraqi strongman, he declared, is that the United States and 
the Soviet Union "are together as they stay in the United Nations against your 
brutal, naked aggression." 
</P>
<P>
Prior to the dinner meeting with Bush, Gorbachev told reporters that there 
would be no retreat from demands that Iraq, the Soviets' onetime ally, withdraw 
from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"We all need patience," Gorbachev said. "But that does not mean that we are 
going to relax, we are going to retreat. No, we are going to demand in a very 
resolute way. And the fact that we are working together -- not only the Soviet 
Union and the United States, but the United Nations and the whole world are 
acting together -- allows me to expect that in this very difficult crisis, 
resolutions will be found. And we will not waste time." 
</P>
<P>
Neither leader was available for comment after their dinner session, but 
Fitzwater said they agreed to continue meeting, but in a less formal way, 
"without hoopla" and in settings that would be "something less than a 
full-blown extravaganza." 
</P>
<P>
Although Gorbachev has sided with the United States ever since Iraq invaded 
Kuwait on Aug. 2, the Soviet leader consistently has counseled patience in 
dealing with the crisis and has expressed hope that negotiations could lead to 
a peaceful settlement. 
</P>
<P>
While Bush also has expressed hope for a peaceful ending, he has insisted that 
this could come about only by Iraq's unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait, and 
on Monday the President declared that "you cannot negotiate with a terrorist." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, continuing his hard-line stance at his press conference and in a brief 
opening statement at the security conference here, said he agreed with German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl that it would be nice to have a peaceful resolution to 
the gulf crisis, but "there will be no concession" to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is "ratcheting up pressure" on Hussein, he said, and the only 
way for there to be a peaceful settlement is for the Iraqi leader to comply 
with existing U.N. resolutions and withdraw unconditionally from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the only way to get a peaceful solution," he declared, "because it is 
not going to go on forever, it simply cannot go on forever, it will not go on 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, can there be room for any other view here?" Bush continued. "In a 
Continent that has suffered so much from aggression and its companion, 
appeasement? The principles that have given life to CSCE, that have guided our 
success in Europe, have no geographic limits. Our success here can be neither 
profound nor enduring if the rule of law is shamelessly disregarded elsewhere."

IRAQ TO SEND MORE TROOPS INTO KUWAIT

<TEXT>
<P>
The Iraqi government Monday ordered 250,000 more troops to Kuwait and decried 
American criticism of its plan to release foreign hostages over three months 
beginning Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
The military command, in a statement released Monday evening, said seven more 
divisions will be sent to Kuwait and additional reserves will be activated. 
</P>
<P>
Talking peace and preparing for war, President Saddam Hussein's regime sent 
mixed signals to the Western alliance and its Arab allies. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated quarter-million troops will join the reported 430,000 Iraqi 
troops already in Kuwait and southern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 150,000 reservists will be sent into training, the command 
statement said. Western diplomats here say that Baghdad is drawing on its last 
reservoirs of reserves. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Defense Department officials played down the significance of the 
new Iraqi deployments, noting that they will likely come from the ranks of 
reserve forces that are poorly trained and ill-equipped. 
</P>
<P>
While Iraq's vaunted million-member army would permit Hussein to field greater 
numbers of troops than the United States and its allies, only a risky decision 
to divert forces from the Iranian or Turkish borders would free effective new 
troops for a fight to keep Kuwait, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly 3,500 of Iraq's 5,000 tanks already are committed to Kuwait and the 
surrounding area, and officials expect that the new influx of troops will run 
the remaining armored vehicles. Analysts have said that these vehicles are the 
oldest and least reliable of the Iraqi force and already have been raided to 
supply parts for front-line armored forces. 
</P>
<P>
"He is starting to scrape the bottom of the barrel," said one senior defense 
official of the announced Iraqi increase. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon, citing past increases and significant improvements in the Iraqi 
deployment, recently announced that it would dispatch a second wave of U.S. 
troops to Saudi Arabia, numbering more than 200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Western forces in the Persian Gulf region, mounting steadily since the Aug. 2 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, will total more than 430,000 once American 
reinforcements are in place in January. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Information Minister Latif Jasim rejected American criticism of the 
proposed hostage release as "cynical manipulation." 
</P>
<P>
"We expect evil of all these persons and are taking precautions," he said. ". . 
. We think they are in a crisis and an impasse. The only outlet is peace and a 
peaceful dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
The American hostages got word of the proposed Christmas holiday release from 
one of their colleagues who was on the telephone to his family when the report 
was aired Sunday night in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Roland Bergheer, 62, a traffic and logistics consultant from Las Vegas who was 
working on contract for the Baghdad government when Iraqi troops invaded 
Kuwait, said the Americans sheltered in diplomatic quarters here viewed the 
Iraqi announcement with restraint. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to think about," said Bergheer, who serves as a press liaison for 
the U.S. hostages. "But it really didn't generate a great deal of excitement. 
It (the diplomatic shelter) was very subdued. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of things have happened here in the past that might have suggested the 
same thing," he said, characterizing the mood as one of caution "so we may not 
get our hopes up too high, or false hopes." 
</P>
<P>
"It really didn't generate any jumping up and down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another Western hostage, an unidentified physician, agreed. "Sure, if it 
happens, I'd go," he said. "But how can you believe this government?" 
</P>
<P>
Despite Sunday's conditional pledge to release all hostages beginning Christmas 
Day, Jasim made clear Monday that the trade in foreign captives remains open in 
the interim. 
</P>
<P>
The hostage bazaar, as some diplomats call it, is still in business for a 
speedy release of some of the hundreds of Westerners denied exit permits here, 
he disclosed at a morning press conference. "It depends on the representation 
made for them," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Jasim denied that the Iraqi government made a political mistake in holding the 
foreigners hostage in the first place. "We still consider ourselves doing 
something appropriate and correct towards ourselves and humanity in general," 
Jasim said of the government's Aug. 17 decision to deny Westerners the right to 
leave Iraq, subsequently sending hundreds of them to potential military targets 
as so-called human shields. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's ruling Revolutionary Command Council announced Sunday that all the 
hostages would be released in batches from Christmas Day to March 25. 
</P>
<P>
Several tests of the starting date were on the table as Jasim spoke. A 
five-member Swiss delegation, led by Edgar Oehler, a member of the National 
Assembly here ostensibly as a private citizen, was urging Iraqi officials to 
free 24 Swiss hostages, 25 foreigners working for Swiss companies and 150 other 
foreign nationals. 
</P>
<P>
Oehler said the Iraqis had told him the release was under consideration. Asked 
at his press conference about the prospect, Jasim said "there were several 
other considerations," mentioning Oehler's suggestion of Switzerland as the 
site for a peace conference on the Persian Gulf crisis and the possible 
shipment of Swiss medical supplies to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Western sources, without identifying the country, said a European government, 
presumably Switzerland, is preparing to send a large shipment of medical goods 
to Baghdad. Supplies of medicine are permitted under the U.N. Security Council 
trade embargo of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
French and Canadian political delegations also have arrived in Baghdad. French 
citizens have already been given permission to leave, but the Canadian group 
will be seeking the release of Canada's estimated 50 hostages in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi pledge was conditioned on the absence of any disturbance of what the 
ruling council called "the atmosphere of peace." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what development might derail the release of the hostages, Jasim 
responded with the obvious -- war. "When the groups start to leave . . . and an 
attack takes place, the process would be affected," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding a prospective U.N. Security Council resolution endorsing military 
action to drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait, he said, "We will have to watch 
that." 
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that the plan means release for all hostages, even those held 
as human shields at military targets. "This is our policy, and nobody will be 
excluded from this policy," Jasim remarked. 
</P>
<P>
The information minister appeared to dodge a question on whether American men 
hiding from the Iraqi authorities in Kuwait would be permitted to leave. "This 
is a procedural thing not related to the political attitude," he said, 
insisting that the hard-pressed fugitives in Kuwait are required to turn 
themselves in to Iraqi officials "so they can be put under the protection of 
the Iraqi government." 
</P>
<P>
So far, every American man in Kuwait who fell into the hands of the Iraqis has 
been sent out as a human shield.

PARCHED SOUTHLAND DOUSED WITH FIRST RAINFALL IN MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A powerful storm system moved into Southern California from the Pacific Ocean 
on Monday, bringing the drought-gripped region its first significant rainfall 
in months and kicking up desert winds that forced the space shuttle Atlantis to 
delay its landing. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters had offered a 60% chance of light rain with a half-inch of rainfall 
possible in some coastal and mountain areas before skies begin to clear later 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Their predictions were right. By 9:30 p.m., showers were reported as far south 
as San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a real big storm system . . . but it does have a pretty good punch," 
said Marty McKewon, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides 
forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The storm came onshore in the Los Angeles area at Malibu just before 8 p.m., 
knocking out power to more than 700 Southern California Edison customers from 
Trancas Beach to the Ventura County line, a power company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Malibu station described the rain 
as "heavy." A power company official said there were at least three reports of 
downed power lines. Electrical service was being restored to customers "a few 
at a time," the spokesman said, but he could not estimate when power would be 
fully restored. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 9 p.m., Los Angeles Department of Water and Power crews were 
attempting to resume service to about 800 customers in an area bounded by 43rd 
and 53rd streets and Van Ness and Normandie avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Another outage affected about 800 homes in exclusive Bel-Air, the DWP said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, one hopeful weather forecaster on a local television station 
reportedly counted six drops of rain by noon, but instruments at the National 
Weather Service had not detected any measurable precipitation by early evening. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, anticipation ran high. People pulled out their umbrellas and 
slickers, brought in their dogs and cats and cast watchful glances from office 
windows before stepping outside. 
</P>
<P>
"All the media and every John Doe is calling in, wanting to know if it is 
really going to rain, what are the chances of rain, how much rain are we going 
to get, when is it going to rain," said meteorologist Jerry McDuffie of the 
National Weather Service in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't rained in so long, and it's just something people in California do 
out here, period." 
</P>
<P>
Just how long has it been since that last rain? In August, 0.02 of an inch of 
rain fell at the Los Angeles Civic Center -- hardly enough to notice. 
</P>
<P>
Back on May 28, a freak storm dumped 1.17 inches onto Los Angeles, setting a 
seasonal record and ruining the Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
For the last four years, Southern California has been suffering a drought, with 
rainfall levels far below normal. The average amount of precipitation recorded 
by the end of October is 11.03 inches; this year, 6.3 inches has been measured 
during the same period, McDuffie said. 
</P>
<P>
The rain is not expected to greatly relieve the parched local landscape. It 
might be enough to make roads slick for the morning commute, and motorists were 
being cautioned to drive carefully. 
</P>
<P>
"It could fool us and rain harder in some spots. But (the storm system) should 
move across at a decent rate so it won't drop a lot of rain in any particular 
place," McDuffie said. "It's nothing that's going to wash any houses away." 
</P>
<P>
Added McKewon: "The system looks like it's got quite a bit of moisture. But I 
don't think a widespread range, from Santa Barbara to San Diego, is going to 
get rain. Unfortunately, some locations will get very little, if any." 
</P>
<P>
The high temperature in downtown Los Angeles on Monday was a mild 64 degrees, 
with slightly warmer temperatures expected today. The long-range forecast calls 
for a sunny, windy Thanksgiving, with highs in the low to mid 70s. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Fernando Valley, where temperatures were expected to drop below 50 
degrees overnight, city officials activated a foul-weather shelter program and 
opened a National Guard armory in Van Nuys for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
City vans picked up the homeless and took them to the armory, which holds 150 
people, for a hot meal and a bed away from the elements. By late Monday, 
however, only 18 people were in the shelter, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
High above the Mojave Desert, a disappointed shuttle crew had to remain in 
orbit an extra day -- at least -- after shifting gusts at the last minute set 
up crosswinds in excess of the 15-knot safety level for the spacecraft. 
Officials said the landing on a dry lake bed at Edwards Air Force Base could be 
delayed until as late as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The swirling winds are not expected to let up today, McKewon said.

INDICTED DEPUTIES TELL OF CASH HOLDINGS; 
</P>
<P>
CORRUPTION TRIAL: THEY SAY THEY KEPT LARGE SUMS AT HOME, ACCUMULATED FROM 
GAMBLING, SAVING LOOSE CHANGE, INHERITANCES, OVERTIME, BABY-SITTING AND OUTSIDE 
WORK.

<P>
One deputy stuffed a shaving kit with hundred-dollar bills as an "emergency 
fund" in his bedroom closet. Another deputy stashed tens of thousands of 
dollars in a cookie tin and a locked box in his home. A third deputy kept 
thousands in an attic safe over his stepson's bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
The money, deputies said, came from refurbishing cars, baby-sitting, garage 
sales, savings and collecting loose change. Or from gambling winnings, spousal 
incomes, outside businesses and gifts from relatives. 
</P>
<P>
None of the money came from stolen drug cash, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses for five of the seven Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies accused 
of stealing money seized from drug dealers gave these financial scenarios in 
testimony before a federal jury in a corruption trial that resumes today. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran officers -- all former members of the Sheriff's Department's elite 
narcotics investigation teams -- are accused of stealing $1.4 million during 
drug raids in 1988 and 1989 and spending much of that money on cars, boats, 
vacation homes and other luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
During the six-week trial in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, prosecutors 
have produced a parade of federal agents, convicted drug dealers and a former 
sheriff's sergeant in a bid to prove the theft allegations. Prosecutors also 
have called financial experts and Internal Revenue Service agents to attempt to 
show that the deputies spent money well beyond their means and made cash 
purchases shortly after drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
But the deputies have produced their own witnesses and have taken the stand to 
explain the sources of their incomes and defend the practices of saving money 
at home and using cash for purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Terrell H. Amers, for example, testified last week that he and his wife, 
Jan, who also worked as a sheriff's deputy, had saved more than $45,000 in an 
attic safe in their home by January 1, 1988 -- the date that prosecutors claim 
the money-skimming conspiracy began. 
</P>
<P>
Amers, a 22-year Sheriff's Department veteran, said half that money was savings 
that he and his wife brought to their marriage in 1983, as well as $5,000 from 
his father-in-law and another $15,000 the couple saved from their salaries and 
from overtime. An additional $5,000 came from cash wedding gifts, the sale of a 
car and a court settlement, Amers told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
With some of that money, the couple eventually purchased vacation property in 
Bullhead City, Ariz., partial interest in two boats, a satellite dish and other 
items, Amers said. 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas A. Hagemann charged that Amers and other 
deputies devised elaborate stories about the stashes of money because they 
"needed an explanation of where the cash was coming from." 
</P>
<P>
Amers insisted that the practice of keeping money at home was meant partly to 
hide his assets from an embittered former spouse. 
</P>
<P>
"That was because my ex-wife had made threats against me that she would take me 
back to court every six months to see what money I had (saved) and file suit," 
Amers said of his decision not to bank the money. 
</P>
<P>
Another defendant, Deputy Daniel M. Garner, also testified that he accumulated 
more than $45,000 in cash that he kept at home -- from an earlier severance 
settlement, money given to him by his ailing mother, cash gifts from other 
relatives and extra income he had saved from buying and selling cars at local 
auto swap meets. 
</P>
<P>
Garner testified that he kept much of the money at home in a safe rather than 
in a bank because he distrusted financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy James R. Bauder testified that he and his wife saved money at home in a 
cookie tin, a security box and a safe and estimated that he, too, had saved 
more than $45,150 in cash by January, 1988. The bulk of that money came from 
refurbishing and selling old Volkswagens, garage sales, baby-sitting jobs by 
his wife and the couple's practice of collecting loose change around their 
house, he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutors, Bauder accumulated more than $79,500 in unexplained 
cash during 1988 and 1989 -- a figure that the deputy disputed. Bauder did tell 
jurors, however, that he did not report for income taxes some of the $45,000 he 
saved at home. 
</P>
<P>
"I used it as supplemental income, and I never thought about it," Bauder 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
The other deputy who has taken the stand, John C. Dickenson, had been with the 
elite narcotics investigators team for only five months when the deputies were 
suspended. But Dickenson also testified that he kept an "emergency fund" of 
cash at home -- about $3,000 stashed in a shaving kit that agents found when 
they searched the home last year. 
</P>
<P>
As they cross-examined the deputies, prosecutors expressed incredulity at the 
cash surpluses and the officers' explanations of how they accumulated their 
money. And as the trial nears a conclusion next week, three remaining deputies 
have yet to take the stand -- Eufrasio G. Cortez, Ronald E. Daub and Macario M. 
Duran. 
</P>
<P>
Government lawyers claim that Daub amassed more than $218,000 and Cortez 
accumulated more than $276,000 in unexplained cash during 1988 and 1989. 
Although it is unclear whether any of the three will take the stand, earlier 
testimony indicates that attorneys for Daub and Cortez will contend they 
received money from gambling winnings, from relatives and other legitimate 
income. 
</P>
<P>
Daub's brother, Reid, testified last week that his brother was a habitual and 
successful gambler who won $32,000 during a weekend of gambling in Las Vegas in 
June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Daub's mother, Shirley, said her son had another source of money to supplement 
his Sheriff's Department pay: a cash inheritance from his dying father in 1971. 
Shirley Daub said her husband, who later died of cancer, left her $30,000 in a 
shoe box in their closet and gave similar shoe boxes of cash to his two sons. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me to keep that money stashed and not to put it in the bank," Shirley 
Daub testified. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Daub said she did just that for 17 years before using $20,000 of the 
money in 1988 as her contribution -- along with $30,000 from Ron and $20,000 
from Reid -- toward a retirement home in Bullhead City. That same year, she 
said, she gave Daub another $10,000 in cash to buy a used car for her. 
</P>
<P>
But the federal government seized both the Arizona property and the car, 
contending that Ron Daub bought them with stolen money.

DEATH OF GIRL PROMPTS REVIEW OF SCHOOLYARD EUCALYPTUS TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE BECKLUND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
The towering old eucalyptus whose branch fell and killed a 4-year-old girl in a 
Highland Park schoolyard had not been pruned in recent memory and belonged to a 
species known for dropping large branches, tree experts and a school official 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A large branch from a nearby tree crashed to the ground about a month ago as a 
fifth-grade class looked on, according to a school official and a witness, but 
no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the fatal accident at Buchanan Street School last week, the Los 
Angeles Unified School District has ordered an inspection and pruning program 
involving the estimated 750 eucalyptus trees throughout its school grounds, 
district legal adviser Ron Apperson said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Apperson acknowledged that the tree had last been pruned "a good time ago" and 
was scheduled for pruning in the next few months. However, he said it showed no 
signs of disease and denied that the tree was unsafe. "Such sudden limb drops 
are rare and difficult to predict," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several tree experts told The Times that it is difficult to predict which limbs 
will break. They said that the 80-foot-high ribbon gum variety that killed the 
preschool girl is one of several types of large, heavy eucalyptus trees prone 
to suddenly drop branches. 
</P>
<P>
"That tree was dangerous," said John Sevier, who owns a San Diego firm called 
Tree Safety and frequently testifies in liability cases involving death or 
injury because of falling tree limbs. He examined the tree over the weekend and 
found evidence of the break in the other tree just a few yards away. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just finishing PE and we saw it fall," said Sharah Salvador, 11, 
recalling the earlier incident. 
</P>
<P>
She said her fifth-grade class, including the teacher, heard a loud crack 
across the playground and turned to see a limb crashing on the sidewalk just 
outside the playground. "It scared a few of us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Apperson confirmed that the other incident occurred, but said the breaks were 
the only ones at the school in years. 
</P>
<P>
Carmen Munguia of Highland Park was killed Wednesday afternoon by a falling 
limb when she went to the school with her mother to pick up an older brother. 
It was a windless, sunny day, and witnesses said the branch cracked and fell 
for no apparent reason. The branch was about 35 feet long and 10 inches in 
diameter. 
</P>
<P>
Such breakages are known to horticulturists as "sudden limb failure" or "summer 
branch drop." The causes are not fully understood. 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, most such accidents happen on calm, sunny days in the seemingly 
safest of places -- parks, playgrounds and golf courses -- and the victims 
frequently are children, experts say. A 4-year-old girl was killed in 1983 when 
a eucalyptus branch just two inches thick fell on her at the entrance to the 
San Diego Zoo. A 10-year-old boy was killed at the Los Angeles County Arboretum 
in 1977 when a eucalyptus branch fell on him during a school field trip. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason, this often happens in hot, calm weather in the afternoon, or 
after such weather," said Richard Harris, a professor emeritus of landscape 
horticulture at UC Davis and one of the few acknowledged experts on the 
phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it has something to do with moisture content. But we don't really 
understand it because the most common time for it to happen is in the afternoon 
when large branches can be many pounds lighter than in the morning, when they 
are filled with moisture." 
</P>
<P>
Such accidents kill an average of one person a year in California and injure 
many more, according to Allison Berry, assistant professor of environmental 
agriculture at UC Davis, who is coordinating a three-year study of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 such limb failures have been recorded by certified arborists, or 
tree specialists, in California in the past three years, Berry said. At least a 
quarter of the incidents involve eucalyptus trees, partly because the trees are 
so common. 
</P>
<P>
"But eucalyptus does seem to have a high incidence of branch failure in 
general," Berry said. "I must say, I always look up when I'm under a 
eucalyptus." 
</P>
<P>
In Australia, Sevier said, some eucalyptus species are known as "widow makers." 
</P>
<P>
While many of the hundreds of eucalyptus species in California are considered 
safe, some of the largest and most common are known for their limb breakage. 
Among them are the blue gum, red gum, sugar gum and ribbon gum. 
</P>
<P>
The tree that killed the preschooler last week was probably planted about 40 
years ago when horticulturists were less aware of its danger, according to 
Vance Tucker, a Cerritos tree expert who is a consultant to several local 
cities, golf courses and racecourses. 
</P>
<P>
"Certain varieties (of eucalyptus) should never be planted in high-use areas," 
Tucker said. Asked if such trees should be planted in schoolyards, he said: 
"It's not something I would want to be responsible for." 
</P>
<P>
Eucalyptus were imported from Australia in the mid-1800s to provide wood for 
railroad ties and trestles, and furniture for the growing population. But the 
wood warped, making it unusable. One of the largest and most common species, 
blue gum, was put into service making windbreaks in citrus groves. Many other 
varieties of eucalyptus are considered safe and well suited to California, 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Careful maintenance over the life of a tree can reduce hazards, Tucker and 
others said. Poor pruning can create more hazards, they said. Inexperienced 
trimmers can mistakenly "hatrack" large eucalyptus, or cut the foliage so far 
back that the remaining trunk and limbs look like a hatrack. In such cases, 
experts warn, new foliage grows back so fast it is much weaker -- and vastly 
more dangerous in most cases -- than the old.

<P>
TRANSIT: BUILDERS OF THE SUBWAY SPONSOR A CELEBRATION TO CHEER UP 
CONSTRUCTION-WEARY MERCHANTS ALONG A RESTORED 7TH STREET STRIP.

Builders of the Metro Rail subway system threw a party Monday for merchants 
along a two-block strip of 7th Street, an affair intended to celebrate the 
district's freedom from three years of construction fences, earthmoving 
vehicles, hard hats and, most important, a construction-related slump in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Even with a 30-piece brass band, clowns and hard-working mimes, few store 
owners at the "Street Restoration Celebration" were in a festive mood: They 
have been freed from the machinations of Metro Rail construction just in time 
to enter a Christmas shopping season threatened with recession. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody hopes this season isn't as bad as it's being forecast," said Sieg 
Lindstrom, owner of Fowler Brothers bookstore. "All we can do is hope. That's 
all we could do for the last three years." 
</P>
<P>
Since late 1987, the chaos caused by the $48-million construction of Metro 
Rail's first station kept customers away, forced delivery trucks to maneuver 
around earthmoving vehicles and allowed burglars and vandals to use the 
barricades' nocturnal cover to commit crimes. Three stores closed. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until last month that subway workers began removing the jutting 
fences that had turned sidewalks into narrow pathways and leisurely lunch-hour 
strolls into acrobatic feats. 
</P>
<P>
"It became a real hassle," said attorney Bari Vaughn, who works nearby. "The 
maneuvering, the noise, the dust. Every time I came around the corner, I had to 
calculate where I was going so I wouldn't bounce into someone." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning, Vaughn managed to make it to the Roosevelt Pharmacy without 
worrying about whether her heels might break. This was no small concern. 
Vaughn, who had been used to going to 7th Street as many as four times a week 
before the construction, had ventured there no more than once a month over the 
last few years. Behind the counter, Ron and Neva Dashjian, the pharmacy's 
owners, said that they are just beginning to see the return of old customers 
such as Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
"We are slowly seeing faces we haven't seen in more than two years," said Ron 
Dashjian, who has owned the pharmacy at the 7th Street site for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Dashjians estimated that their business dwindled by 20% to 25% over the 
last three years. They said they complained often about the narrowed and 
darkened walkways outside the pharmacy, but received little sympathy from 
subway officials. 
</P>
<P>
At one meeting, Dashjian recalled, a construction superintendent told him they 
had no intentions of deviating from their contract despite the merchants' 
complaints. "He just said there was nothing he could do," Dashjian said, "and 
that was that." 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, the county Transportation Commission took over administration 
of the project from the RTD and, according to some merchants, began to show 
some leeway, widening the sidewalk slightly. By then, many merchants had 
already had enough. 
</P>
<P>
Laurent Quenioux, chef and owner of Seventh Street Bistro, became so angry that 
last December he filed suit against the agencies involved in the Metro Rail 
project, claiming that he was owed $800,000 for his business losses. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't even imagine how much I've lost since then," Quenioux lamented as he 
prepared the menu for his lunch-hour crowd. Like other merchants, Quenioux said 
it may be a year before he sees all of his old customers return. 
</P>
<P>
Along 7th Street, some merchants joined transportation officials in their 
determination to hold a party despite a gray horizon and a steady drizzle. As 
merchants distributed free marking pens, candy and plates of penne with 
mushrooms to reacquaint customers with their wares, Neil Peterson, executive 
director of the Transportation Commission, declared that 7th Street "has been 
revitalized in time for the Christmas holiday." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, commission spokeswoman Robin McCarthy acknowledged that transportation 
officials have learned much from their mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
In future Metro Rail construction projects on Wilshire Boulevard, Vermont 
Avenue and in Hollywood, McCarthy said, sidewalks will be wider, warning signs 
will be more plentiful, delivery trucks will have better access and merchants 
will have better lines of communication to subway officials. 
</P>
<P>
Sieg Lindstrom of the Fowlers bookstore is not so sure. When subway officials 
visited recently to strongly urge him to give discounts for the Monday 
celebration, Lindstrom bridled at the notion. "Here they were, imposing again," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
A customer, overhearing Lindstrom's complaint, liked the discount idea. "Do I 
get one?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," said Lindstrom. "Tell you what I'll do. I'll double the price on any 
book you want and then sell it to you half price. Well?" 
</P>

PRESIDING JUDGE DEFENDS SEARCH OF SPECTATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Municipal Court judge's order that spectators be detained, searched for 
weapons and checked for arrest warrants is "no different than what we are 
subjected to in order to board an aircraft," the court's presiding judge wrote 
Monday to critics of the practice. 
</P>
<P>
In cautiously backing Judge Steven Hintz's actions, Presiding Judge Lee E. 
Cooper Jr. said in a letter to Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury and Assistant 
Public Defender Duane Dammeyer that people entering courtrooms "have a right to 
do so without fear of violence." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Cooper's letter, however, Public Defender Kenneth I. Clayman said his 
office plans to ask a Superior Court judge to enjoin Hintz from repeating the 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury and Dammeyer on Friday said Hintz's mass search and warrant check the 
day before was illegal. Hintz had ordered bailiffs to exclude attorneys and 
police from Courtroom 12, lock the doors from the inside, then use hand-held 
metal detectors to search the about 20 spectators for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
On Hintz's orders, bailiffs also asked the spectators for identification, which 
court clerks then checked for outstanding arrest warrants. One woman was 
briefly detained but was released when computer records of a warrant in her 
name proved to be incorrect. No weapons were reported found. 
</P>
<P>
Hintz said last week that he ordered the procedure to show the public that the 
court could enforce laws that allow it to order spectators searched for 
weapons. He cited signs warning court-goers of the laws, which have been posted 
permanently on engraved plaques outside the courthouse and which were 
duplicated on paper and posted last week on his courtroom door. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Cooper wrote: "The procedure essentially was no different than 
what we are subjected to in order to board an aircraft, to enter Federal 
Courts, to enter many state courts, or to attend many other public gatherings, 
such as sporting events." 
</P>
<P>
However, the presiding judge did not address the warrant checks ordered by 
Hintz. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper wrote that Hintz's actions have not been adopted as policy by the 
Municipal Court, nor have the 12 judges discussed whether Hintz's actions 
should be repeated in his or other courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be foolish for us to compromise our security measures by publicly 
proclaiming what they are or how they are to be effectuated," he said of any 
changes in procedure that might be considered. 
</P>
<P>
Hintz said last week that Cooper agreed to the search and warrant check. The 
presiding judge could not be reached for comment Monday. But his letter 
concluded: "A presiding judge has no authority whatsoever to control what 
another judge does in his courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said Monday that he considers the incident closed. 
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate Judge Cooper's response and assume that the matter will be 
resolved by the court without the need for further expressions of concern from 
this office," Bradbury said. "It appears that the court is cognizant of our 
concerns, and I doubt if we'll see a repeat of that type of conduct." 
</P>
<P>
Clayman said Monday that he was disappointed that Cooper's letter did not 
address complaints about the warrant searches. 
</P>
<P>
And he said that locking the courtroom violated the public's right that court 
proceedings be conducted in the open. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no reason to do the search and no reason to lock the room, and I 
don't understand the relationship of the warrant check to the weapons search at 
all," he said.

JURY REHEARS BRODERICK'S ACCOUNT OF KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After asking to hear again how La Jolla socialite Elisabeth Anne (Betty) 
Broderick described the killings of her ex-husband and his new wife, jurors in 
Broderick's double-murder trial left for the day Monday without reaching a 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
The panel asked to have reread a court reporter's record of Broderick's account 
of the shootings. Testifying Nov. 2 in her own defense, Betty Broderick said 
she crept into her ex-husband's house, stole into the bedroom where he lay in 
bed with his new wife and, intending to kill herself, was startled by movement 
in the bed and began firing. 
</P>
<P>
The jury's request for Broderick's testimony was included in one of three notes 
it passed to San Diego Superior Court Judge Thomas J. Whelan during its third 
day of deliberations. The notes gave no hint of agreement or division among the 
jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the Nov. 
5, 1989, killings of her ex-husband, Daniel T. Broderick, and his second wife, 
Linda Kolkena Broderick. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of both counts of first-degree murder or of one count of 
first-degree and another count of second-degree murder, Betty Broderick could 
be sentenced to life in prison without parole. The jury has five options: to 
find Broderick guilty of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary 
manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter or not guilty on any charges. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Broderick, who was 44, was a prominent medical malpractice attorney and 
a former president of the San Diego County Bar Assn. Linda Broderick, who was 
28, was his office assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Betty and Daniel Broderick separated in 1985, after 16 years of marriage. 
During their bitter divorce, which did not conclude until 1989, Betty Broderick 
accused him of using his legal influence to cheat her out of her fair share of 
his seven-figure annual income. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick has been held without bail at the Las Colinas Jail in Santee 
since she surrendered to police only hours after the killings. 
</P>
<P>
She appeared in court Monday dressed in street clothes. In her last court 
appearance, she had dressed in jail sweats to protest what she viewed as unfair 
rulings that kept from jurors her secret diaries and the bulky court file in 
the divorce case, material she felt backed up her testimony. 
</P>
<P>
When she testified Nov. 2 about the killings, she said she remembered very 
little about them, only that she fired the gun, then fled. Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Kerry Wells, the prosecutor, did not ask her about the shootings on 
cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
One of the other two notes the jury passed Monday morning asked for help in 
defining the word act in the legal definition of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
In a note signed by foreman Lucinda L. Swann, 26, the panel asked whether the 
word meant the "moment of pulling the trigger" or the "setting up of a 
dangerous situation." 
</P>
<P>
Whelan said it was whatever conduct that "directly inflicts the injury that 
causes death." 
</P>
<P>
The third note asked to have read the testimony of Robert W. Weller, a clerk at 
the Neighbor-Saver Food Store in La Jolla. In his testimony, which took 
precisely three minutes Nov. 6, he said that Betty Broderick bought a cup of 
coffee and one of cocoa early most weekday mornings.

FREE THANKSGIVING MEALS, VOLUNTEERS ARE BOUNTIFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The holiday -- and the volunteering -- season begins this week with 
Thanksgiving, and, although San Diego is responding with its usual generosity, 
area service groups say what they need more of is off-season charity. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with shelters, churches and community groups preparing to serve 
Thanksgiving meals to thousands of homeless and disadvantaged people say they 
have been flooded with calls from people volunteering to cook, serve and clean 
up during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"People began calling in August to volunteer at Thanksgiving and Christmas," 
said Mary Ruth Hansen, volunteer coordinator for the Salvation Army. "They've 
just been so gracious. They always are, too." 
</P>
<P>
Many shelters reported having more than enough volunteers to help during 
Thanksgiving and Christmas. But officials said there often is a shortage of 
help during the rest of the year, particularly the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We have plenty of volunteers now, and we appreciate all the offers to help, 
but we need more volunteers year-round," said Dan DiCarlo, volunteer director 
for the St. Vincent de Paul Center. "We have all kinds of programs where 
volunteers are needed." 
</P>
<P>
Karl Whicker of the San Diego Catholic Worker echoed: "We have plenty of 
volunteers now -- we've even had to turn a few away -- but we could use many 
more year-round." 
</P>
<P>
Shelter officials encouraged those volunteering during the holidays to keep 
their giving spirit through the year by volunteering on a regular basis, 
perhaps once a month, or on non-holidays when the number of volunteers usually 
is lower. 
</P>
<P>
Free Thanksgiving meals will be offered at many sites in San Diego County. On 
the menu are tons of turkey, ham, stuffing, cranberries, yams, rolls and other 
traditional fare. Much of the food was donated by businesses, community groups 
and churches, which also are contributing donations and volunteers to prepare 
the meals. 
</P>
<P>
Among those offering Thanksgiving meals are: 
</P>
<P>
* San Diego Catholic Worker, which expects to serve about 1,500 meals, complete 
with all the traditional fixings, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Wednesday at St. 
Vincent de Paul Center, 1501 Imperial Ave. 
</P>
<P>
* San Diego Rescue Mission, 1150 J St., which will host a Thanksgiving prayer 
service from 11:30 a.m. to noon Wednesday. The Stewart and Stewart gospel 
singers will perform from noon to 1 p.m. The mission's 36th annual Thanksgiving 
meal will be served starting at 1 p.m. Up to 1,000 homeless and needy people 
are expected to attend, mission spokesman Mike Cage said. 
</P>
<P>
* Super Junior Market, 1036 7th Ave., which will serve complete takeout meals 
starting at 11 a.m. Thursday. Meals will be served until there are no more 
takers, said market owner Victor Salem, who has provided the meals to the 
homeless since 1982. Salem's employees and other volunteers will prepare the 
estimated 1,000 pounds of turkey, dressing, rolls and other fixings. About 730 
meals were distributed last year, and the market is preparing to serve the same 
number Thursday. Salem declined to reveal how much the spread costs him each 
year, saying he does it "to give something back to the downtown community. It 
has been good to me, so this is our way of saying thanks." 
</P>
<P>
* St. Vincent de Paul Center, which will serve a Mexican brunch to transients 
from 9 to 11 a.m. Thursday. The food will be donated and served by El Indio 
Mexican Restaurant. From 4:30 to 5:30 p.m., the San Diego Trial Lawyers Assn. 
will serve dinner to homeless people enrolled in the center's social service 
programs. The day's fare will include 1,800 pounds of turkey and other 
Thanksgiving fixings. The center expects to serve 1,300 meals during the day. 
</P>
<P>
* The Salvation Army, which will prepare 2,600 pounds of turkey for 
Thanksgiving meals at two locations from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Thursday: 
downtown at Golden Hall in the Civic Center, 202 C St., and in Escondido at the 
Knights of Columbus Hall, 515 W. Valley Parkway. An estimated 2,700 needy 
people were served last year, and 3,000 are expected Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
* Our Lady of Angels Church Hall, 653 22nd St., which will serve a traditional 
Thanksgiving meal to about 200 senior citizens at 12:30 p.m. Thursday. A $2 
donation is requested. 
</P>
<P>
* St. Jude's Nutrition Center, 3751 Boston Ave., which expects about 50 senior 
citizens to attend its Thanksgiving meal from noon to 1 p.m. Thursday. A $1 
donation is requested. 
</P>
<P>
* Samahan Senior Center, 2952 Market St., which will provide holiday music from 
10 a.m. to noon and a Thanksgiving meal from noon to 1 p.m. About 90 people are 
expected. A $1 donation is requested.

SCHAEFER FIRES AIDE WHO TOOK JOB WITH VANDERKOLK; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY SUPERVISORS: DOUG JOHNSON SAYS HE DID NOT TELL HIS BOSS ABOUT THE NEW 
JOB BECAUSE SHE WAS UPSET ABOUT HER MOTHER'S ILLNESS. 
</P>

<P>
Ventura County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer fired an administrative aide Monday 
after she discovered that he will soon go to work for Maria VanderKolk, who 
defeated Schaefer in a stunning upset last June. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer fired Doug Johnson, 27, after a brief meeting in which she told her 
aide of two years to clean out his desk and not report back to the supervisor's 
Thousand Oaks office, Schaefer and Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that under the circumstances I didn't feel it was best for him to 
stay in the office," said Schaefer, who lost to VanderKolk, a political novice, 
by fewer than 100 votes after a bitter campaign last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, however, will continue to receive his pay through Jan. 7, when 
VanderKolk is sworn in and he begins work for her. Aides serve at the 
supervisors' pleasure but are entitled to a 60-day notice when dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who is paid $43,848 a year, will work in VanderKolk's Thousand Oaks 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very difficult for us both," Johnson said of his meeting with Schaefer. 
"I tried to explain to her that this really was in the best interests of the 
residents she has served, and that she ought to feel happy that Maria feels 
someone on her staff qualifies to still serve those residents." 
</P>
<P>
"She said I should have talked to her about this first," he said. "But I didn't 
think it was the right time." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he interviewed with VanderKolk in October. He said he did not tell 
Schaefer of the appointment early this month because the supervisor was upset 
about her mother's illness. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer said she learned of Johnson's appointment through an anonymous letter 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I was upset about what I considered to be a lack of loyalty, a lack of 
sensitivity," she said. "I didn't think an anonymous letter was an appropriate 
or professional way to (find out) about this." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is the third assistant appointed by the 25-year-old VanderKolk in a 
week. Last Tuesday she named Russ Baggerly as chief of staff and Lenora Kirby 
as an aide. 
</P>
<P>
Both Baggerly and Kirby have been active in county environmental causes -- 
Baggerly as a well-known critic of the county on growth issues and Kirby as a 
member of Save Open Space, which has vigorously opposed development on the 
Ahmanson and Jordan ranches in the southeast part of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to the ranch projects was a central theme of VanderKolk's 
slow-growth campaign, and she said Johnson's appointment represents "a 
much-needed balance" on her staff. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment "rounds out the environmental expertise of my other staff 
members with a solid knowledge of federal, state and local government issues," 
VanderKolk said. "Doug knows all the players and is very politically savvy. He 
also has a lot of knowledge in things like the jail, health issues, and the 
budget." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a political science graduate of USC, was an aide to Connie Mack III of 
Florida when he was a congressman and to state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita) 
before being hired by Schaefer in October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk said she had hoped that Schaefer would allow Johnson to work out his 
term, "but I can understand that she would feel uncomfortable having him stay 
on, knowing that he will be working for me." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson praised Schaefer as a good mentor. "I think she's done an outstanding 
job, but the voters asked for a change in June and life has to go on."

DECISION DELAYED ON GATED COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Moorpark Planning Commission on Monday voted to delay consideration of a 
subdivision of a 348-acre site that would become the first privately gated 
community in Moorpark, with ranch-style houses costing more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The commission wanted more information on the use of bridle trails by 
non-residents of the subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
The commission was also concerned about drainage for three proposed lots. 
</P>
<P>
The project would be located north of downtown on Walnut Canyon Road and about 
half a mile north of Casey Road. Walnut Canyon Road is the city's only northern 
outlet to Fillmore and carries about 7,000 vehicles per day, according to a 
traffic report. 
</P>
<P>
The exclusive community would have an elaborate gated entry on Walnut Canyon 
Road and an electric gate at the west end. 
</P>
<P>
The 66 lots, each a minimum of five acres, would cost $400,000 to $650,000 and 
would be surrounded by three-rail white fencing. 
</P>
<P>
The next hearing on the development is scheduled for Dec. 3. GERRY BRAILO

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE SETS TRIAL DATE IN RAPES OF 
TRANSIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge on Monday set a Dec. 10 trial date for a convicted sex offender who 
police say has systematically raped and imprisoned women transients and 
prostitutes in the city's most blighted areas over the past 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge James A. Bascue set the trial date for Lemuel Z. Harris of 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 35, has been charged with 22 felony counts stemming from the alleged 
kidnaping and rape of one woman last August and the alleged rape of another 
woman he is accused of holding forcibly in his apartment for a week last July. 
</P>
<P>
Harris has pleaded not guilty and is being held in Los Angeles County Jail in 
lieu of $500,000 bail. Interviews with authorities and a review of court 
records indicate that Harris is suspected of having committed rapes and other 
sex crimes against at least 12 women since 1976, during periods when he was not 
in prison on sex-related offenses and parole violations.

<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies, following up the discovery under the Antelope Valley desert 
of one of the most sophisticated marijuana farms ever found in Los Angeles 
County, pressed the hunt Monday for more of the subterranean plantations. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies looking for evidence of additional growing sites served search 
warrants at several locations in the Antelope Valley, said Stephen L. Cooley of 
the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities also conducted searches Sunday in Barstow and Palm Desert but found 
no farms. 
</P>

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN GETS 4-YEAR TERM IN B-1 CONTRACT FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Rockwell International supervisor was sentenced Monday in Los Angeles 
to four years in prison for running a sham machine shop that received Rockwell 
subcontracts for B1-B bomber parts. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter imposed the sentence and a $12,000 fine on 
Ralph Affinito, 49, of Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
Affinito, a former Rockwell purchasing department supervisor, pleaded guilty in 
July to three felonies in connection with the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Affinito's sham shop, Draw Industries, received 48 subcontracts worth more than 
$430,000 from Rockwell's purchasing department beginning in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
As a company supervisor, Affinito authorized Rockwell's approval of Draw as a 
subcontractor and "systematically directed contracts to Draw by revealing 
confidential bidding information to his partner (at Draw)," Assistant U.S. 
Atty. John F. Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
Draw did no machine work for Rockwell. Its subcontracts on the B1-B bomber were 
farmed out to other machine shops.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STATE OFFERS $50,000 REWARD IN GIRL'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian offered a $50,000 reward Monday for information leading 
to the arrest and conviction of the killer of a 14-year-old runaway girl whose 
body was found on a roadside in Lancaster last month. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's action -- providing the maximum reward allowable by law from the 
state's General Fund -- brings the total offered in the death of Angela 
Migliore to $60,000. Last week, county supervisors posted a $5,000 reward 
proposed by Supervisor Mike Antonovich. The Lancaster City Council matched 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Migliore's body was found near 70th Street East and Avenue N on Oct. 11. 
Investigators said she had been strangled elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said Migliore had run away from home after arguing with an older 
brother.

<TEXT>
<P>
A preliminary hearing for the Los Angeles Raiders fan who allegedly attacked 
and seriously injured a Pittsburgh Steelers fan during a game between the two 
teams at the Coliseum on Sept. 23 was continued until Dec. 10 following a 
request by the defense attorney for more time. 
</P>
<P>
Shane C. Geringer, 19, of Agoura Hills, has pleaded not guilty to one count 
each of assault with a deadly weapon and battery causing serious bodily injury, 
both felonies. 
</P>
<P>
Geringer's attorney, Leslie Abramson, told Municipal Court Judge Alban Niles 
she needed time to study the medical records of the victim, Paul Albrecht, 35, 
of Tucson, Ariz., and to talk to witnesses. 
</P>

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 GANG MEMBERS GUILTY IN SCOUT'S DRIVE-BY 
DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two gang members were convicted Monday in the drive-by slaying of a sheriff's 
Explorer Scout who was killed in a South Los Angeles neighborhood where he had 
admonished youngsters to stay out of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
After seven days of deliberations, a Superior Court jury found Omar Butler, 18, 
and Reginal Malone, 19, guilty of first-degree murder in the Sept. 19, 1989, 
slaying of Anthony Jerome Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner, 19, was sitting in a car with four friends in the 1000 block of South 
Haas Avenue when he was struck in the chest by shots fired from a passing car. 
No one else was hit by the blasts. Witnesses who testified during the two-week 
trial said Butler fired the gunshots and Malone drove the car. Both men were 
members of a gang from a nearby neighorhood, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies said Gardner, who often tipped off authorities about crime 
in the area, warned neighbors shortly before he was shot that gang members were 
cruising the neighborhood.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN ONOFRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 8-month-old girl was among six people taken to a hospital Monday morning 
after a four-car, chain-reaction accident south of the San Onofre Border Patrol 
checkpoint, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
No one was seriously injured, but all six were taken to hospitals for 
examinations, said Jerry Bohrer, spokesman for the CHP's Oceanside office. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 11:05 a.m. when Salvador Ortega, 26, of Chula 
Vista, failed to slow for traffic in the northbound lanes of Interstate 5 at 
the checkpoint and rear-ended the car ahead of him, Bohrer said. Ortega's car 
hit that of Roy Anderson, 79, of Encinitas, who then struck Elvira Matta, 31, 
of Santa Ana, who in turn hit Molly Hagan, 29, of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Matta's 8-month-old daughter, Brenda, was in a child safety seat and was not 
visibly injured, but was taken to a hospital as a precaution, Bohrer said. 
Juana Ibarra, Matta's 65-year-old mother, was also a passenger in the car and 
taken to a hospital, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic was snarled for about half an hour as three lanes on I-5 north were 
closed because of the accident, Bohrer said.

FIGHT OVER FORMER SITE OF CARWASH TAKES A NEW FORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The celebrated carwash itself may be gone, but Studio City's battle over the 
site where the neighborhood landmark formerly stood continued Monday, with 
development opponents citing liquor and zoning laws instead of the cultural 
memorabilia of the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of a neighborhood group fought the issuance of city conditional-use 
permits for three trendy Westside restaurants and a stereo store proposed for 
the two-story Laurel Promenade shopping center under construction at Ventura 
and Laurel Canyon boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
The construction site was the focus of a nationally publicized controversy last 
year when opponents of the shopping center development led an effort to declare 
the carwash that stood on the site a culturally significant example of 1950s 
architecture. The preservation effort was widely viewed as a creative ploy to 
stop more development along busy Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Although the developer, Ira Smedra, eventually won a lawsuit against the city 
over the cultural landmark issue and successfully obtained a building permit, 
the carwash battle left bitter feelings between the developer and neighborhood 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
Studio City Residents Assn. President Polly Ward complained during Monday's 
hearing at the Van Nuys Woman's Club that Ventura Boulevard already has too 
many bars and restaurants serving alcohol, and that installation of car stereo 
systems by a proposed store would disturb neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Smedra called Ward's objections just an extension of "the ongoing campaign 
against us." 
</P>
<P>
"I would deny blocking anything," replied Ward. "He is exhibiting such chutzpah 
coming in and asking for three restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
Zoning Administrator Robert Janovici said he would issue a written decision in 
10 days. Both sides vowed to appeal the outcome if it is not to their liking. 
</P>
<P>
The three restaurants -- Kaktus, the Daily Grill and Louise's Trattoria -- have 
signed leases with Smedra and are in the process of applying for liquor 
licenses with the city's Alcohol and Beverage Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Grill and Louisa's would serve beer and wine, their managers told 
Janovici. Kaktus needs a hard-liquor permit, owner Richard Sneider said, 
because margaritas are "part of Mexican culture." 
</P>
<P>
Ira Handelman, a consultant to Smedra, called all three restaurants 
"first-class establishments" and told Janovici the shopping center would 
provide adequate parking. 
</P>
<P>
But Ward said three alcohol-serving restaurants was too many for one shopping 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with a list of neighborhood restaurants and bars, she said there are 
already 30 restaurants with alcohol permits within a one-mile radius of 
Smedra's shopping center, and more than 60 such establishments in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just too much. And this doesn't count the liquor stores in all the 
mini-malls," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
She also objected to a conditional-use permit for The Good Guys, an 
audio-visual retail outlet that installs stereo systems in customers' cars. 
</P>
<P>
Handelman said the stereo installation would take place in an area of the 
shopping center's underground garage, too far for residents to hear any 
equipment testing. He and Smedra also suggested that Ward's objections were 
hypocritical because her group had attempted to save a busy gas station and 
carwash. 
</P>
<P>
Ward and association board member Neil Finestone were the only residents to 
attend the afternoon hearing. Ward said the Studio City Residents Assn. 
represents the occupants of 1,300 homes.

SEABEES DONATE FOOD FOR THANKSGIVING

A Port Hueneme-based battalion of Seabees helped combat hunger Monday by 
donating 2,200 pounds of food to the Zoe Christian Center in Oxnard for its 
traditional Thanksgiving Day dinner for the needy. The 600-man Naval Mobile 
Construction Battalion 3 delivered the load of canned goods, potatoes, rice and 
other non-perishables to the Zoe Center, the only shelter for homeless families 
in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time the Seabees have contributed to this cause and this is 
the first year we have had an overabundance of canned goods," said Annie 
Burney, volunteer coordinator at the Zoe Center. 
</P>
<P>
Burney said the shelter served 1,300 meals to the homeless and poor last 
Thanksgiving Day and expects to dish out an even greater number of dinners this 
Thursday. "The Seabees really helped cut our costs, but we need more hams and 
turkeys," Burney said. 
</P>
<P>
The donations from the Seabees were coordinated by the battalion's First Class 
Petty Officers' Assn., said battalion spokesman Lt. Dennis Tucker. The three 
other Seabee battalions from Port Hueneme are in Saudi Arabia building 
facilities for U.S. troops stationed in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Zoe also received about 500 cans of food Monday from two Girl Scout and two Boy 
Scout troops made up of children of Navy employees at Point Mugu. The scouts 
collected food and cash donations from Navy personnel shopping at the Point 
Mugu commissary over the past two weeks, said Lt. Cmdr. Jack Winston, 
administration officer of the Naval Air Station. KENNETH R. WEISS

A NEW USE FOR THE HAIR OF THE DOG; 
</P>
<P>
ANIMALS: SOME PET OWNERS HAVE TAKEN UP SPINNING FUR INTO YARN FOR SWEATERS. 
THEY SAY IT'S WARM AND MAKES FOR A NICE MEMENTO. 
</P>

<P>
This yarn is about dog yarn. 
</P>
<P>
Liz Kusak loves her aging dog so much that she turns the hair it sheds into 
sweaters she can wear. 
</P>
<P>
She spins the hair into yarn on an old-fashioned spinning wheel and then knits 
it into shawls, vests and cardigans. 
</P>
<P>
When Kusak weaves an Afghan, it's actually keeshond. When she wears her 
creations around her Canoga Park neighborhood, she adds a new dimension to 
walking the dog. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people cringe when you tell them it's a dog sweater," Kusak said. "Others 
love it. My grandchildren love it. They say, 'Oh, you're wearing Cindy!' " 
</P>
<P>
Cindy is a 12-year-old keeshond -- a long-haired, gray-and-black dog who dozes 
peacefully at Kusak's feet while she operates her wooden spinning wheel. 
</P>
<P>
The wheel is turned by a simple foot treadle. It twists short clumps of dog 
hair into a long strand of yarn. The yarn is washed and dried before it is 
knitted or woven into a garment. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a domestic 'sheep.' Except this one is housebroken, is a good watchdog 
and a great companion," said Kusak, a retired aerospace metalographic 
technician. "Long after Cindy's gone, I'll have her sweaters." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike wool, dog sweaters do not attract moths, Kusak said. Or fleas. They are 
attracting increasing numbers of fans, however. 
</P>
<P>
Dog Fancy magazine recently reported that "more and more people are discovering 
the beauty and warmth" of what it labeled "chiengora chic." (Chien is the 
French word for dog.) 
</P>
<P>
"What you can make with your yarn is limited only by your imagination and your 
supply of yarn," the magazine said. But it warned that "flea powders and heavy 
dirt in the hair can pose health hazards . . . discard any hair that has a lot 
of grass in it." 
</P>
<P>
Dog-yarn spinners say some breeds are better than others at growing sweater 
material. Collies and other long-haired dogs whose fur has a slight crimp to it 
produce the best yarn; smooth fur from such dogs as cocker and Maltese spaniels 
and Shih Tzus pulls apart too easily, they say. 
</P>
<P>
But dog sweaters leave many people cold. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't wear one," said Jan Dill of Bellflower, who wore a red wool sweater 
as she shopped recently at the Beverly Center. "It's bad enough that my dog's 
hair is always getting on my sweaters." 
</P>
<P>
Westchester resident Joe Smith, wearing a brown cotton sweater sporting a maple 
leaf, shuddered at the idea. "How would you know that it wouldn't attract 
fleas?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
People who wear dog-hair sweaters say those who make such comments are barking 
up the wrong tree. They say more and more dog lovers are making and wearing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Dog breeder Joanie Fraser, who lives in a geodesic dome in the mountains 80 
miles north of Los Angeles, said she uses a keeshond sweater she knitted all 
winter long. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like wearing a heating pad around my neck," she said. "The men in town 
just crack up when I tell them what I'm wearing." 
</P>
<P>
Her dogs recognize the sweater, too, Fraser said. "They get excited when I wear 
it. They jump all over and kiss and nuzzle me more. After they're gone, I'll 
have a constant memory of them." 
</P>
<P>
Calabasas schoolteacher Gay Latta said that her two Samoyed dogs "probably know 
it's them" when she wears a white sweater knitted with dog hair she spun from 
their thick fur. They shed so much that she has collected enough for a second 
sweater. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people assume a negative connotation at first. They say, 'Ugh . . . dog 
hair.' But you win them over when they touch it. It's a real nice memento of 
your dogs. I've spun yarn for two people whose dogs have died." 
</P>
<P>
Dog-grooming school operator Nick Jamieson said dog lovers often ask if there 
is a use for the fur he piles daily into a 33-gallon trash can at his Canoga 
Park shop. 
</P>
<P>
Approached by Kusak, Jamieson agreed to set aside some of the clippings for her 
and others. Jamieson is not interested in wearing a sweater knitted from dog 
yarn, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I own a cat," he said.

Helen and Dean Skovlin may be victims of Murphy's Law, a bizarre twist of fate, 
or just plain bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
On three different occasions in the last six years, speeding motorists have 
crashed into a 6-foot-high wall surrounding their Northridge home, each time 
costing the couple thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
As fate would have it, while construction workers were repairing a section of 
the wall Monday, a driver crashed into the construction company's truck and a 
barricade, sending workers scurrying for safety. 
</P>
<P>
"It's bizarre," Skovlin said. "When I called my husband at work to tell him, he 
thought I was jesting," she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Though ironic, the situation is also frightening, Skovlin said. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets worse every day," she said. The Skovlins live in the 17000 block of 
Parthenia Street, dubbed "Parthenia Speedway" by residents. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, residents have clamored for and received increased patrols by 
traffic officers citing speeding motorists, Skovlin said. 
</P>
<P>
Accident investigator Greg Pfeifle, of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Valley Traffic Division, said the street is known for speeding. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had crashes up there at 100 m.p.h. impact," he said. "Any time you have 
speed, you have speed-related accidents. Usually it's people pulling in and out 
of driveways. Those poor people that pull out of their driveways are doing it 
in front of people who are speeding down the street." 
</P>
<P>
Pfeifle said the average traffic citation is for speeds between 60 and 80 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The Skovlins' wall was hit most recently two weeks ago when a speeding city 
garbage truck braked to avoid hitting their neighbor, who was pulling into his 
driveway, Helen Skovlin said. The driver lost control and crashed into her 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it had been the big one," she said. "It felt like an earthquake. 
This place literally shook. It gives you an idea of the impact." 
</P>
<P>
The truck also knocked out a power pole, leaving live power lines in their yard 
for about an hour, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Skovlins are not alone. Their neighbors have also had parts of the walls 
surrounding their homes destroyed by speeding drivers. And the street has seen 
several serious accidents, one that left a pedestrian dead and eventually led 
to the installation of a stoplight, the Skovlins said. 
</P>
<P>
But Helen Skovlin did not know of anyone else who had suffered through three 
wall accidents and another mishap in the midst of a repair. 
</P>
<P>
"Not many people can claim that fate," she said.

DEPUTIES PRESS HUNT FOR MORE POT BUNKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies, following up the discovery under the Antelope Valley desert 
of the most sophisticated marijuana farms ever found in Los Angeles County, 
pressed the hunt Monday for more of the subterranean plantations. 
</P>
<P>
As two men arrested at one of the farms were charged with possession and 
cultivation of the drug, deputies looking for evidence of additional growing 
sites served search warrants at "several locations" in the Antelope Valley, 
said Stephen L. Cooley, head of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests were made, but Cooley said new arrests and raids on additional 
plantations were possible. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities also conducted searches Sunday in Barstow and Palm Desert but found 
no farms, said Sheriff's Capt. Larry Waldie, commander of the narcotics bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lancaster Municipal Judge Ian R. Grant set bail at $1 million for 
Ronald Podratz and Calvin James, two men described as caretakers at an estate 
east of Lancaster where deputies Thursday confiscated 6,000 marijuana plants 
and high-technology growing equipment from an underground bunker. 
</P>
<P>
The arraignment of Podratz and James was continued until Nov. 27 at the request 
of their court-appointed attorneys. The two face up to three years in prison if 
convicted of charges of possession and cultivation of marijuana for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors will decide today whether to charge a third suspect being held in 
Lancaster, Richard Yerger Jr., Cooley said. Documents indicate that Yerger, who 
surrendered in Long Beach Saturday, owns the property containing the marijuana 
farm near Lancaster, but prosecutors said they were looking for further 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Yerger's father, Richard E. Yerger, was still being sought for questioning, 
deputies said. Documents show the elder Yerger, owner of a Lancaster 
contracting firm, owns a house in the desert community of Llano where a raid 
Friday turned up a second marijuana plantation that was smaller but more 
sophisticated than the first, authorities said. The farms are about 20 miles 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
The Yergers and Frank Gegax, a Lancaster contractor in federal custody in Los 
Angeles, are believed to have played "high-level" roles in the operation, a 
federal Drug Enforcement Administration agent said Monday. Gegax, owner of KMG 
Construction Inc. in Lancaster, surrendered to deputies Thursday and was 
charged in Phoenix Friday with conspiracy to possess marijuana for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The DEA agent, who declined to be identified, said investigators believe the 
Yergers and Gegax financed the plantations, which authorities say cost about $1 
million to construct and produced a harvest worth between $75 million and $150 
million on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Cooley would not comment on that description. He said investigators are still 
trying to determine the scope of the case, which also involves two additional 
underground marijuana farms in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents in Phoenix are holding six suspects after an Oct. 30 raid on 
those sites, which DEA agent John Albano described Monday as the DEA's largest 
seizure ever at an underground operation. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors in Lancaster said both Gegax and the Yergers had the construction 
expertise needed to build the elaborate plantations. The Lancaster plantation 
appeared to have been in operation for at least two years, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities also noted that Richard Yerger Inc. was the general contractor and 
KMG was a subcontractor on a Lancaster senior citizen housing complex under 
construction that was destroyed in a $4-million fire in November, 1987. Arson 
investigators suspected that the fire was deliberately set but no arrests were 
made. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the arson investigation may be reopened as a result of the 
arrests of Gegax and the younger Yerger, who reportedly worked in his father's 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday, Richard Yerger Jr.'s brother-in-law -- Alfred Brand of 
Sebastopol in Northern California -- said the construction firm has been in 
difficult financial straits for the past three years as a result of the 1987 
fire and expensive litigation that ensued. 
</P>
<P>
"They were essentially shut down because of the arson," Brand said. Brand said 
he found it hard to believe that the Yergers could take part in the expensive 
marijuana production operation because of their financial problems.

4 PLEAD NOT GUILTY ON COCAINE CHARGES

<P>
A Ventura hotelier and three Los Angeles County men pleaded not guilty Monday 
to charges that they sold two kilograms of cocaine to Ventura undercover 
officers last month. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Waters, 31, general manager of the Harbortown Marina Resort Hotel in 
Ventura; Cesar Fernandez, 59, of Los Angeles; Henry Munoz, 36, of Van Nuys; and 
Alfonso Amaya, 34, of Los Angeles entered pleas at Ventura County Superior 
Court on one count each of conspiracy to possess for sale and to sell cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Waters had been negotiating with the undercover officers for several months to 
sell them cocaine, which he then obtained through Fernandez, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Gregory Phillips said. Phillips said Munoz and Amaya delivered the cocaine and 
that Waters handed it to police at the Olivas Park Golf Course on Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, all the men face a maximum of eight years in prison, and 
Fernandez faces an additional three years because he was convicted in Los 
Angeles County of possessing one kilogram of cocaine for sale, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
Their trial is scheduled to begin Dec. 31. MACK REED

POLICE GRADUALLY TRIM UNIT WORKING ON SERIAL KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a diminishing number of new leads, the San Diego Police Department has 
begun trimming the force investigating the Clairemont-University City serial 
killings from 27 detectives down to a single five-person homicide team, said 
Lt. Gary Learn. The process could take a month or longer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the 27 detectives already has been reassigned, Learn said. The team 
investigating the stabbing deaths of five women in their homes in Clairemont 
and University City now includes 26 detectives, and four senior officers. 
</P>
<P>
As each detective on the case eliminates his share of the 2,600 leads, each 
will be reassigned to normal duties, Learn said during the department's weekly 
press briefing last week. 
</P>
<P>
The process of reducing the task force could take a month or longer, depending 
on how long it takes each detective to finish checking tips. Meanwhile, the 
number of new tips coming in from the public has slowed to a trickle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still a lot of work to be done," Deputy Chief Cal Krosch said in a 
telephone interview. "But, in the absence of any new information, we'll have to 
cut back some." 
</P>
<P>
The force was beefed up to 27 detectives in September in response to the huge 
number of leads, Learn said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we do cut back, we will still have the original team of five," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are looking at six to eight suspects, but the suspects change 
from day to day, Learn said. "We're used to having our hopes dashed. It's not a 
static number we're looking at." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to say whether particular suspects were under constant observation 
and being followed. Noting that the killer has not struck in more than two 
months, Learn said it is possible he has left town. 
</P>
<P>
The Clairemont-University City suspect is said to be a light-skinned, black 
male, 5-foot-7 to 5-foot-10, with a medium build and short, dark, curly hair. 
</P>
<P>
Since Jan. 12, four women between the ages of 18 and 21 have been slain inside 
their homes in the middle of the day after the killer entered through an 
unlocked or open door, police say. The fifth victim, 42-year-old Pamela Gail 
Clark, was the mother of one of the victims, 18-year-old Amber Clark. Both were 
stabbed inside their home in University City on Sept. 13. The three other women 
lived within two blocks of one another in a row of apartment houses in 
Clairemont. 
</P>
<P>
During a tour of the Clairemont-University City area last week, Learn said he 
noticed numerous open doors and windows. 
</P>
<P>
"Even without a murderer running around, people should still be cautious," 
Learn said.

JURY FINDS ARLETA MAN GUILTY OF DISFIGURING LABORER IN ACID ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Arleta man was found guilty Monday of felony charges for blinding and 
severely disfiguring another man by tossing acid in his face in an attempt to 
rob him and steal his car. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Gregory Tristan, 43, faces possible life in prison for the Sept. 5, 1989, 
attack on Andres Chaidez, 22, of Van Nuys. Chaidez, a laborer who came from 
Mexico in search of a better life, was left blinded, scarred and unable to work 
after Tristan threw a cup of sulfuric acid in his face at a Van Nuys 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors found Tristan guilty on one count each of second-degree robbery, 
aggravated mayhem and assault with a caustic chemical, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Maureen O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
Trial testimony revealed that Chaidez was in his car near the intersection of 
Haskell Avenue and Bassett Street when Tristan demanded money. Tristan admitted 
that he was in the area to buy heroin. Chaidez said he was driving to visit 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
When Chaidez refused the demand for money, Tristan threw a coffee cup full of 
sulfuric acid in his face. Chaidez hit the accelerator and raced wildly down 
the block before losing control of the car. He rolled out of the car in agony. 
Witnesses said his screams were audible a block away. 
</P>
<P>
Tristan followed Chaidez in another car. As Chaidez lay on the pavement in 
pain, Tristan stole between $80 and $100 from his pockets and took his car. 
O'Brien said Tristan drove to another location and ransacked the car in search 
of items to steal. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Tristan testified that he was at the intersection and saw 
what happened, but was not involved. Deputy Public Defender Thom Tibor argued 
that although Tristan's fingerprint was found on the cup containing the acid, 
he did not attack Chaidez. Tibor said he did not know how the fingerprint got 
on the cup. 
</P>
<P>
Sulfuric acid is a colorless, highly corrosive liquid used in the manufacture 
of paints, dyes, fertilizers and explosives. It was unclear why Tristan had the 
acid. 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 17.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STATE OFFERS REWARD ON LANCASTER GIRL'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian offered a $50,000 reward Monday for information leading 
to the arrest and conviction of the killer of a 14-year-old runaway girl whose 
body was found on a roadside in Lancaster last month. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's action brings the total offered for information about the death 
of Angela Migliore to $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors offered a $5,000 reward 
proposed by Supervisor Mike Antonovich. The Lancaster City Council has also 
offered $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Migliore's body was found behind a tumbleweed near 70th Street East and Avenue 
N on Oct. 11. Investigators said she had been strangled elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said Migliore had run away from home after arguing with an older 
brother. The girl left in the family car, planning to meet a friend in 
Lancaster. The two never met and the car was found in a residential 
neighborhood near downtown Lancaster the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
The reward offered by the governor is the maximum allowable by law from the 
state's General Fund.

TUNA CANNERS SEND BUYERS A MESSAGE WITH 'DOLPHIN-SAFE' LABELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The three biggest players in the nation's tuna-canning industry are now 
shipping their product in cans with labels that describe the contents as having 
been caught through techniques that do not kill or injure dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
The "dolphin-safe" labeling is prominently featured on labels of cans shipped 
by San Diego-based Van Camp Seafoods, which packages Chicken of the Sea brand 
tuna, and San Diego-based Bumble Bee Seafoods. StarKist, the Long Beach-based 
subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Co. also is shipping tuna in cans bearing the 
"dolphin-safe" label. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the manufacturers' labels now includes a variation on the 
"dolphin-safe" theme as well as a drawing of a dolphin. Van Camp, Bumble Bee 
and StarKist account for 75% of the tuna sold in the U.S., and the U.S. 
accounts for about half of the worldwide market for tuna. Cans with new labels 
are gradually replacing older cans on supermarket shelves, according to 
spokesmen for the companies. 
</P>
<P>
Van Camp, Bumble Bee and StarKist pledged in April not to buy or sell fish that 
were caught using methods that kill or injure dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
The canners' agreement to ship only "dolphin-safe" tuna followed years of 
pressure from environmentalists, who estimated that then-current fishing 
techniques were killing an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 dolphins a year. 
</P>
<P>
The three canning companies have pledged to no longer process tuna that is 
caught with gill or drift nets, which indiscriminately kill large numbers of 
marine animals, including dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the San Diego-based American Tunaboat Assn. earlier this year 
argued that the ban was not needed because of improved fishing techniques that 
have dramatically reduced the number of dolphins killed by the U.S. tuna boat 
fleet. 
</P>
<P>
ATA member boats, which use giant purse seiner nets to catch tuna, killed 
12,643 dolphins during 1989, far below the 20,500 quota that had been set by 
the federal government, according to ATA statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Bumble Bee "initially began packaging and labeling the (dolphin-safe) tuna back 
in mid-summer," said spokesman Tim Larrick. Cans bearing the new labels, which 
feature the "Bumble Bee" and a dolphin, are being shipped to all San Diego 
retail outlets, Larrick said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego-based Van Camp Seafoods has designed a new label for its Chicken of 
the Sea brand. The new, red-on-white logo includes wording that alerts 
consumers to the fact that the tuna was caught without injuring dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
"We selected this new logo so consumers can quickly recognize they are 
selecting the right (tuna)," said Don George, Van Camp's marketing director. 
"Our research shows consumers strongly prefer our new design, and that it 
enhances the product's image." 
</P>
<P>
George said consumers are aware of the "dolphin-safe" label. "There are some 
consumers who are concerned if (the dolphin-safe language) is not on the 
label," George said. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's been communicated that Van Camp" won't process tuna caught in a 
manner that injures or kills dolphins, George said. 
</P>
<P>
StarKist began shipping its "dolphin-safe" cans June 19, said Erik Bloemendaal, 
the company's general manager of product quality and communications. "Our label 
bears a symbol of a dolphin leaping across water with the words 'no harm to 
dolphins.' " 
</P>
<P>
"The general public has been very much supportive of our dolphin-safe policy," 
Bloemendaal said. "They've sent us a lot of letters, postcards and things 
commending us for our leadership on this issue."

REGIONAL EARNINGS: STORAGE EQUITIES POSTS 19% RISE IN QUARTERLY PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Storage Equities Inc., a real estate investment trust based in Glendale, said 
its third-quarter profit rose 19% from a year earlier, to $3.09 million from 
$2.59 million. 
</P>
<P>
Storage Equities is one of several affiliates of Public Storage Inc., a 
Glendale-based operator of self-storage warehouses that invest in such 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Storage Equities has also been buying stakes in other Public

result, it has merged the partnership's financial results with its own, and it 
restated its year-earlier results to reflect the change.

despite a slight decline in revenue, to $8.66 million from a restated $8.77 
million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of 1990, the company's profit rose 30%, to $9.18

REGIONAL EARNINGS: TRIO-TECH REPORTS LOSS FOR 1ST QUARTER

Trio-Tech, a San Fernando company that makes semiconductor testing equipment, 
said it lost $81,000 in its first quarter, which ended Sept. 28, compared with

</P>
<P>
Trio-Tech's sales fell 16% to $3.73 million for the period from $4.42 million 
last year. Christopher J. Ebert, chairman of the company, attributed the loss

its credit facility and put off loan payments on the debt until January, 1991.

Orr-Cahall, who resigned earlier this year after an uproar involving a Robert

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: DIXIELAND JAZZ INCLUDED IN THANKSGIVING 
FIXIN'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dixie, not turkey, will be the traditional Thanksgiving feast for San Diego 
jazz fans, courtesy of the 11th annual San Diego Thanksgiving Dixieland Jazz 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday through Sunday at the Town &amp; Country Convention Center in Mission 
Valley, 25 bands from throughout the United States will keep 10 stages hopping 
with music. Last year, 14,000 jazz fans attended, roughly 60% of them came from 
distant locations. 
</P>
<P>
"We've grown from a little over 1,000 people the first year," said Len Levine, 
who has been on the board of the America's Finest City Dixieland Jazz Society 
since 1982, when it was formed to take over the festival started by the Town 
&amp; Country. "Sacramento was the original Dixieland festival, and they're way 
beyond everyone. They draw 150,000. After that, out of about 150 festivals, we 
are among the top few in attendance, and, based on what we hear from musicians 
and in fan letters, quality." 
</P>
<P>
Dixieland encompasses several forms of jazz from the period between the 1890s 
and 1930s. Bands at the festival represent a variety of these styles. Local 
groups appearing include: High Society, South Market St. Jazz Band, Tami Thomas 
and her Jazz-Ma-Tazz, the Chicago Six and the Yankee Air Pirates. Out-of-town 
bands include Buck Creek, the Golden Eagle Jazz Band and the Rent Party 
Revellers. 
</P>
<P>
How to decide what to hear? A few highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Uncle Yoke's Black Dog Jazz Band from Kissimmee, Fla., combines music with a 
canine sense of humor. Led by Steve (Hot Dog) Yocum, and including members with 
other doggish names, the group purportedly prefers woofing and howling to 
applause. In addition to a fetching sense of humor, band members are sound 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
* Buck Creek is known for strong ensemble and solo work, plus a selection of 
tunes other bands don't play. 
</P>
<P>
* The Rent Party Revellers is composed of musicians from all over the country 
who only get together a few times a year. 
</P>
<P>
* The 9-year-old High Society band, led by cornet player Larry Channave, 
concentrates on Chicago-style jazz, which peaked in the late 1920s and early 
'30s. Characterized by a four-beat format (as opposed to two), this is the 
upbeat swing music originally popularized by bands like Eddie Condon's. 
Channave's 13-year-old nephew, Matt Lair, will make guest appearances on 
cornet. 
</P>
<P>
* Led by Dominic Addario, the Yankee Air Pirates is a 12-piece ensemble fronted 
by four banjos. 
</P>
<P>
* Sunday morning at 8:30, Night Blooming Jazzmen -- the only group that has 
played the festival every year -- opens the day with religious hymns in the 
Presidio Room. 
</P>
<P>
* South Market St. is celebrating its 25th anniversary. Since 1965, about 20 
musicians have passed through the eight-piece band. Original band members 
reunited for a set at 5:30 p.m. Saturday in the Presidio Room. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't make very much off the festivals," said the band's banjo player Carol 
Dendle, whose husband, Bill, started the group. "We did 10 this year, and the 
main reason is they're so much fun. It's great to have a full audience that 
wants to hear what you play. It's not like when we get hired to play 
conventions, and we're just background music." 
</P>
<P>
* Mission Bay High School, which offers a Dixieland jazz program within its 
music deparment, is sending a band, as is Escondido High School. 
</P>
<P>
Festival hours are 7 p.m. to midnight on Thanksgiving; noon to 1:30 a.m. 
Friday; 10 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. Saturday; and 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday. Badges 
good for the entire four days cost $55; $45 gets you a Friday-through-Sunday

<P>
Local 325, the musicians union, regularly locks horns (or basses or drums) with 
players who don't live by its rules. One of the most frequently violated bylaws 
prohibits union members from playing dates with non-union members. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego bassist Bob Magnusson and drummer Jim Plank, both union members, are 
on probation with the union because of two incidents earlier this year. In 
April, they invited non-union saxophonist Daniel Jackson to join them behind 
fluegelhorn man Art Farmer at Elario's, and the union warned them not to work 
with non-union players again. 
</P>
<P>
After backing saxophonist James Moody with non-union pianist Harry Pickens a 
few weeks later, Magnusson and Plank were each fined $100, with the fines "in 
abeyance for one year pending future conduct," according to a letter to Plank 
from Earl J. Smith, Local 325's secretary-treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Elario's talent coordinator Rob Hagey can't be faulted much. His top priority 
is top talent. Jackson is an under-utilized local saxman with excellent skills, 
and Pickens, a former New Yorker, is nationally recognized. 
</P>
<P>
But the union has other priorities than just talent. 
</P>
<P>
"Our members make the rules," said Local 325 president Joe Pallazola. "Our 
prime purpose is to stick together to make conditions better for our lot in 
life." Benefits include low-premium medical, dental and instrument insurance, 
credit union membership, access to contract forms, $1,500 in life insurance, 
and use of the union's rehearsal hall. 
</P>
<P>
That's still not enough to entice Pickens, Jackson, and such local jazz 
fixtures as drummer Chuck McPherson and saxophonist Joe Marillo to join. 
</P>
<P>
"It has good points and bad," McPherson said. "If you have a monetary 
discrepancy (with a club), they're a good intermediary. But the bad side is 
that most jazz rooms here, including Croce's, are non-union. If you work with 
non-union musicians, they fine you. How are you supposed to make a living? What 
are we supposed to do, not pay our bills? Not eat? To me, the bottom line is 
music."

New Rumors on the Block: Is Tiffany going to turn out to be the Yoko Ono of the 
'90s? The Boston Herald reports that the teen singing queen is involved with 
Jonathan Knight, 21, of New Kids on the Block, and the other New Kids want him 
to break it off with her because their fans want them romantically unattached. 
"His fellow band members have told him bluntly that if he continues with the 
romance, his career could be over -- as well as Tiffany's and the rest of the 
New Kids," the Herald quoted an insider as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Knight is quoted as saying: "I love Tiffany a hell of a lot more than I love 
the New Kids on the Block. I don't want to break up the group but if they don't 
leave me and Tiffany alone, I will." CLAUDIA PUIG

PARKENING GUITAR RECITAL AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although he rarely challenges himself or his listeners anymore, guitarist 
Christopher Parkening continues to be an exceptionally popular recording artist 
and recitalist. Saturday night, a sold-out audience at Ambassador Auditorium 
witnessed the native Angeleno performing his usual fare of light guitar 
classics. 
</P>
<P>
His mellow sound can soothe even the most unsophisticated of ears, while his 
hands and memory are perhaps less dexterous than those of many of his peers. 
</P>
<P>
Free use of sul ponticello, vibrato and other effects, as well as fluctuating 
tempos, gives less authenticity to his Baroque and Classical repertory, though 
Parkening banks on these techniques to give him his signature style. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the lack of his usual Bach piece, the program offered no 
surprises. The performance of Sor's Variations on a Theme of Mozart proceeded 
joyfully, though not without its rough edges. 
</P>
<P>
Three suites -- a transcription of selections from Praetorius' "Terpsichore," 
four Catalan dances arranged by Andres Segovia (Parkening's teacher) and 
guitarist Miguel Llobet, and a short opener by Murcia -- were the best examples 
of Parkening's penchant for simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
Three transcriptions of Albeniz piano pieces proved colorful and satisfying 
items. Other works such as Sanz's "Canarios," Granados' "Villanesca" and 
Tarrega's "Capricho Arabe" were all executed with engaging vim. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist David Brandon, who has toured with Parkening since 1984, collaborated 
dutifully on the last four works by Falla, Castelnuovo-Tedesco and local 
composer Andrew York, plus an encore of Gordon Young's "Hymn of Christian Joy." 
Parkening closed by himself with another encore, his own quirky arrangement of 
the Shaker hymn " 'Tis a Gift to Be Simple." GREGG WAGER

A PROBLEMATIC 'KHOVANSHCHINA' IN S.F. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>

<DATELINE>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Terence McEwen's tenure at the helm of the San Francisco Opera was cautious and 
conservative, brief and baffling. It wasn't particularly brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
McEwen did muster a few undisputed triumphs, however. One of the most memorable 
was the first local production, back in 1984, of Mussorgsky's sadly neglected 
"Khovanshchina." 
</P>
<P>
It is a very Russian opera, in tone, in emotional thrust and in historical 
ambience. That may help explain its neglect outside the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Its sprawling, melodramatic convolutions threaten to alienate audiences in this 
country. They know little enough about their own Civil War, never mind the 
conflicts between the old and new orders in Moscow at the time of Peter the 
Great. 
</P>
<P>
It might be useful to perform so forbidding a challenge in English. That is 
what the Metropolitan Opera did in 1950. Unfortunately, the raw and pungent 
sound of the Russian language, so crucial to the idiom, gets lost in 
translation. Supertitles, though distracting, may be a valid compromise in this 
especially difficult case. 
</P>
<P>
The original San Francisco production was a stylish ensemble effort, led with 
passionate conviction by the German conductor Gerd Albrecht. The strong cast 
was dominated by Matti Salminen, wildly ferocious as the lusty Prince 
Khovansky, and Helga Dernesch, broodingly poignant as the mysterious Marfa. 
</P>
<P>
None of these paragons returned for the current revival, which was planned by 
McEwen but executed by his successor, Lotfi Mansouri. Of the newcomers, only 
the conductor achieved an unmitigated success. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri Simonov brought genuine Bolshoi authority to the podium. Using the 
splendid Shostakovich edition, he sustained blazing urgency without sacrificing 
lyrical detail. He worked on a broad scale, inspiring heroic efforts from both 
the orchestra and the somewhat underpopulated chorus, trained by Ian Robertson. 
He accompanied the agitated singers with reasonable tact. 
</P>
<P>
His "Don Carlo" at the Music Center Opera last April represented an obvious 
case of miscasting. "Khovanshchina" found him in his estimable element. 
</P>
<P>
Nicolai Ghiaurov, the new Khovansky, obviously knows his way around the role. 
He enacted it on Saturday with authentic theatrical flair supported by 
reasonably fervent vocalism. His characterization of the brutal leader of the 
Streltsy musketeers seemed oddly benign, however, and, at 61, his 
once-formidable basso shows signs of wear. 
</P>
<P>
Dolora Zajick sang gloriously as Marfa -- with warm, suave, generous, rolling 
mezzo-soprano tone, and with no discomfort at either range extreme. 
Unfortunately, she did little but stand and sing. She acted with neither her 
body nor her face. She didn't even act with her voice. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Noble returned as the scheming boyar, Shaklovity, his dramatic 
intensity intact but his hearty baritone now strained at the top. Gwynne Howell 
again brought dark, mellow and monochromatic tone to the saintly platitudes of 
old Dosifei -- platitudes once enlivened by Feodor Chaliapin. 
</P>
<P>
The secondary roles were all in new hands. John Treleaven, the British tenor, 
made his San Francisco debut as a properly nasty, improperly tight-voiced 
Prince Golitsin. Michael Myers whined even more than necessary as Andrei, 
Khovansky's weakling son. Maria Fortuna squeaked the plaints of his would-be 
victim, Emma. Steven Cole offered a pointed character study of the terrified 
Scrivener. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Miller of the San Francisco Ballet appeared as the deft soloist in the 
hoochy-kooch dance of the Persian slaves, choreographed by Carlos Carvajal. The 
lush music for this divertissement, incidentally, was arranged not by 
Shostakovich but by Rimsky-Korsakov. 
</P>
<P>
Sonja Frisell directed the complex traffic efficiently if rather mechanically. 
The marvelously atmospheric sets and generic costumes were facsimiles of famous 
designs created for La Scala in 1925 by Nicola Benois. Thomas J. Munn 
illuminated the old canvases with poetic sensitivity.

POST-PUNK AVATAR PLAYS MUSIC TO FEEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It didn't take Bob Mould long to figure out Saturday that the reserved-seating 
Embassy Theatre downtown was the wrong place for him to play. Fans sitting 
calmly in their seats? Couldn't have that. 
</P>
<P>
So after just two songs, the former Husker Dude stopped the show and insisted 
that all on hand come down the aisles and rock. 
</P>
<P>
They did, and Mould responded with a performance that exceeded even his own 
pressure-cooked standards. Expanding on the monsoon of emotional rage and 
anguish of the recent "Black Sheets of Rain" album, the music made by 
singer-guitarist Mould, bassist Tony Maimone and drummer Anton Fier rivaled 
that of Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse and Sonic Youth for sheer fury. This was 
music to feel -- literally -- as much as hear. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that's pretty much expected from post-punk avatar Mould. What made 
this a great show was the unexpected -- not just a closing version of Cheap 
Trick's lighthearted "Surrender," but the formerly stocky-and-stock-still 
Minnesotan's lean, animated, even chatty manner. It brought new dimensions to 
his songs and encouragement to those who feared that Mould's solo route would 
turn into a dead end. Judging by this show, he's just started his journey. 
Mould also appears tonight at San Diego State University's Montezuma Hall.

'A PINCH OF PINTER' AT ROSE THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harold Pinter is a playwright who fiddles with words but in "A Pinch of Pinter 
with a Twist" at the Rose Theatre, the actors don't use his words. They are 
members of a new group of deaf actors, using American Sign Language. 
</P>
<P>
Pinter survives beautifully and, surprisingly, so do his famous pauses. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Leslie Byrne, the production is a good chance to see some of 
Pinter's unfortunately obscure "cabaret pieces." 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the pair is "Night," an oblique and often funny conversation in 
which a couple tries to remember the foggy details of their first meeting. It 
features compelling performances by Charles (C. J.) Jones as the Man, and Vae 
as the Woman. 
</P>
<P>
More interesting textually is the longer "Silence," but it's less effective 
because Lilly Benedict as the girl straddling a romantic fence, and Donald 
Lyons as her older, gentler lover, don't have a firm grasp on their 
characterizations. Ken Elks is the only one to have evolved a full persona.

PARTNERS SAY BIG ACCOUNTING FIRM MAY FOLD; 
</P>
<P>
SERVICES: LAVENTHOL &amp; HORWATH HAS BEEN HURT BY THE POOR ECONOMY AND 
MALPRACTICE SUITS. SOME OF ITS OFFICES MAY BECOME INDEPENDENT; SOME MAY 
AFFILIATE WITH OTHER FIRMS.

<P>
Laventhol &amp; Horwath, the nation's seventh-largest accounting firm, may be 
dissolved or put into bankruptcy, with some of its offices operating as 
independent partnerships or affiliating with other firms, partners said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, whose legal and financial troubles have mounted in recent months, 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
But its 350 or so partners met over the weekend in Houston to decide the 
Philadelphia firm's fate. Options reportedly included dissolution, filing for 
bankruptcy court protection from creditors and shrinking the firm to a few core 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is they're taking whatever actions are necessary to dissolve 
the firm," said Richard Pimentel, partner in charge of the San Francisco 
office, who attended the Houston meeting. No date for the dissolution was 
given, but a clear message was sent "to go about our lives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other partners and former partners reached Monday echoed Pimentel. Orange 
County Managing Partner Richard Carpe said he expects the company to file a 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition by month's end. He doesn't expect it to survive 
as a national firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Hmm. I have no information on that," spokesman Thomas Derr said when asked if 
the firm is shutting down. 
</P>
<P>
The company released a brief statement by Chief Executive Robert N. Levine, 
saying that partners had discussed "a number of scenarios regarding both the 
short-term and long-term future of Laventhol &amp; Horwath." 
</P>
<P>
"At this time, we cannot comment on any of the business plans discussed at the 
meeting," the statement said. "The partners and staff remain dedicated to 
providing the highest quality of professional service to their clients." 
</P>
<P>
In an angry statement issued last week, the company acknowledged that "of 
course, L&amp;H has problems. Every single accounting firm in the nation has 
severe problems -- many caused by the 'sue the accountants; they have deep 
pockets' mentality so prevalent today. The soft economy has also hurt the 
profession, L&amp;H and hundreds of other companies worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
Laventhol &amp; Horwath, with 50 offices and 3,400 employees, has been hit hard 
by litigation. The suits, including a multimillion-dollar one arising from the 
company's audit of imprisoned evangelist Jim Bakker's PTL ministry, have 
alleged poor accounting and consulting work. 
</P>
<P>
The company has been laying off employees. In October, it cut wages for those 
that remained by 10% -- a reduction that it said would last only three months. 
</P>
<P>
In was unclear Monday if pension plans for employees are secure. Some partners 
said basic pensions are fully insured but that an added amount for partners 
will be lost. One former partner said pensions were being funded by current and 
future earnings. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the Century City office will reorganize into three firms 
serving the entertainment industry, said partner George Savitsky. They will be 
Savitsky, Satin &amp; Geibelson, an entertainment business management 
corporation; Satin &amp; Lever, a music industry accounting firm; and Sills 
&amp; Adelmann, a film and television accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is "90% certain" that the mid-Wilshire office, which did accounting 
and consulting work for various industries, will fold. On Monday, only an 
answering machine greeted calls to the mid-Wilshire office. 
</P>
<P>
Pimentel said the 70-employee San Francisco office will continue to operate, 
perhaps by affiliating with another accounting firm. The 40-employee Orange 
County office of Laventhol &amp; Horwath will become independent and be renamed 
Carpe, Wachs, Kipper &amp; Davis, after the four partners, Carpe said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our intention to liberate the local office from the national firm and 
take whatever steps were necessary to see it happen as quickly as possible," 
Carpe said. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 of the 50 offices probably will become independent practices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carpe said business is growing at the Costa Mesa office, with projected 
earnings of $4.5 million for the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, compared to $4 
million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the San Diego offices could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Laventhol &amp; Horwath specializes in audit and consulting work for the hotel, 
entertainment, real estate and health-care industries. The company had about 
$350 million in revenue last year.

NEGOTIATORS SAID TO BE GETTING CLOSER ON PRICE FOR MCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CIEPLY and ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Top officers of Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and Hollywood's MCA 
Inc. have narrowed their price discussions to a range that would pay MCA 
stockholders between $75 and $85 a share, according to people familiar with the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides have begun face-to-face meetings in New York and could reach a 
deal as early as next weekend despite continued differences over the exact 
buyout price, one of the people said. 
</P>
<P>
A price in the reported range would point to a total payment of between $6.85 
billion and $7.79 billion for MCA's approximately 91.3 million shares, on a 
fully diluted basis. The price would include the value of stock in a new 
spinoff company that would own MCA's New York-area TV station. 
</P>
<P>
Several people familiar with the talks said MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman 
remained unlikely to make any deal for less than $80 a share, though he 
apparently has softened a bargaining position that sought as much as $90 a 
share for the entertainment conglomerate. Wasserman is said to be demanding 
employment guarantees of as long as five years for a wide range of MCA 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita, an Osaka-based consumer electronics giant, apparently has accepted 
a bargaining framework that would require it to pay at least $75 a share for 
MCA, even though the Japanese company had initially hoped to pay less. 
</P>
<P>
The current meetings began with a dinner last Sunday in New York. MCA is 
represented by Wasserman, company President Sidney J. Sheinberg and others in 
the talks. Matsushita's delegation is headed by its executive vice president, 
Masahiko Hirata. 
</P>
<P>
Hirata was quoted in a Japanese news report late last week as having said that 
he and company President Akio Tanii weren't planning to attend any bargaining 
session in New York. But people close to the discussions placed Hirata at the 
table. It remained unclear whether Tanii would join the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Both companies declined formal comment on the progress of the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan being discussed in New York, MCA's WWOR-TV station, based in 
Secaucus, N.J., would be spun off to shareholders to avoid delays and 
regulatory problems that might accompany a sale. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, foreigners cannot own more than 20% of a broadcast station 
in the United States. The Federal Communications Commission would have to 
approve a license transfer if WWOR were sold but wouldn't be required to act if 
the station were spun off to MCA shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
MCA paid $387 million for the station in 1986. If the station were currently 
valued at roughly the same price, or about $4.25 for each share of the newly 
created spin-off, Matsushita would have to pay $75.75 to reach an $80 payout 
for MCA stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals familiar with the talks have said that Yosemite Park &amp; Curry 
Co., through which MCA operates concessions in Yosemite National Park, might 
also be disposed of separately. But returns from any such transaction would 
represent only a tiny fraction of the total purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, MCA shares rose $2.375 to close 
Monday at $67.25 as traders became more confident that a deal was near. 
</P>
<P>
The price range of $75 to $85 per share, or $6.85 billion to $7.79 billion, for 
MCA appears to fall within market expectations for a buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Various analysts -- according to reports compiled by the Boston-based InvesText 
research service -- have come up with values as low as $5.2 billion and as high 
as $7.4 billion for MCA's assets, which include Universal Studios' film and TV 
operations, the MCA Records group, theme parks in Southern California and 
Florida, as well as interests in book publishing, movie theaters and other 
areas. But virtually all have assumed that a buyer, such as Matsushita, would 
be forced to pay a premium for control of the entire company. 
</P>
<P>
In a report dated Oct. 4, for instance, Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. estimated MCA 
to have asset values of between $5.2 billion and $6 billion. But Dean Witter 
assumed that Matsushita or any other buyer might pay as much as 30% more, or up 
to $7.8 billion, because of the company's "trophy value." 
</P>
<P>
A Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. report dated last March, before the buyout was 
announced, reckoned MCA to be worth $75 a share. The report at the time called 
it "disconcerting" that the company had, in effect, sold 11.1% of its equity 
for $575 million, or about $58 a share, by issuing stock valued at that amount 
to music mogul David Geffen in return for his record company. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen, Wasserman and various trusts over which he shares control, and mutual 
fund manager Capital Group Inc. of Los Angeles are MCA's biggest shareholders.

Columbia S&amp;L Says Seizure Probable: The Beverly Hills thrift, insolvent by 
nearly $710 million because of junk bond losses, for the first time conceded in 
an SEC filing that it is "extremely likely" to be taken over by federal 
regulators. The disclosure comes as no surprise. Regulators have held off 
seizing the Beverly Hills thrift while its management tries to sell its 
portfolio of junk bonds, now worth about $2.5 billion.

MORE CHARGES FILED AGAINST KEATING, OTHERS; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE EXPANDED 46-COUNT INDICTMENT AGAINST THE FORMER LINCOLN SAVINGS 
OWNER AND THREE EX-OFFICERS COMES AFTER 22 COUNTS WERE DISMISSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles County prosecutors Monday filed an amended and expanded 46-count 
indictment alleging securities fraud against former Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan 
owner Charles H. Keating Jr. and three others. 
</P>
<P>
The new charges were submitted to Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lance 
A. Ito 10 days after he set aside 22 counts in the original 42-count grand jury 
indictment. He said the 22 counts either did not state a criminal offense or 
were vague. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. William Hodgman, who had promised to 
present a "bulletproof" amended indictment, said Monday that the latest version 
should make it "easier to get a conviction" because a trial court jury would 
better understand the complicated case. 
</P>
<P>
Hodgman said the addition of four new counts won't expose the defendants to a 
harsher penalty because a conviction on only six counts carries a maximum 
10-year prison term. But the new charges increase the chances of getting the 
convictions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and the co-defendants -- Judy J. Wischer, Ray C. Fidel and Robin S. 
Symes -- have pleaded innocent to the original 42 counts. Attorneys for the 
four said they would seek dismissal of the amended indictment. They argue that 
only the grand jury, not prosecutors, can alter the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an invasion of the grand jury's province," said Donald Smaltz of Los 
Angeles, attorney for Symes, a former Lincoln president. 
</P>
<P>
Keating is the former chairman of American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, which 
owned Irvine-based Lincoln. Wischer is former president of American 
Continental, and Fidel succeeded Symes as Lincoln president. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action Monday, an administrative law judge in Washington denied 
Keating's request to halt an administrative hearing on a $40.9-million 
restitution claim that regulators have filed against him. Keating wanted the 
hearing delayed until other civil and criminal cases are concluded. The judge 
also denied Keating's request to change the location of the hearing from Los 
Angeles to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Administrative Law Judge Paul J. Clerman said the hearing will start within 
four months, adding that any "unwarranted delay . . . could only increase the 
public's concerns." Regulators are seeking restitution from Keating and others 
for three Lincoln deals. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury indictment accuses Keating and the three co-defendants of fraud 
in connection with the sale of more than $200 million in American Continental 
bonds to 17,000 investors -- mainly elderly Lincoln depositors -- at 29 Lincoln 
branches in Southern California. Many investors said they were misled into 
believing that the bonds were insured or safe. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds have become worthless since American Continental filed for bankruptcy 
protection in April, 1989, and regulators seized Lincoln the following day. 
Lincoln's collapse is expected to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In an indictment unsealed Sept. 18, Keating and his co-defendants were charged 
with securities fraud in the sale of the bonds. But defense attorneys argued at 
a Nov. 9 hearing that the charges were too vague and should be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Ito ruled that 20 of the 22 counts he set aside did not state an offense. They 
allege that the defendants sold bonds in ways that exceeded the authority given 
them by the state Department of Corporations, which approved the sales. The law 
makes it a violation only if sales are conducted without authority. 
</P>
<P>
Ito ruled that two other charges -- ones that accuse the defendants of lying to 
the Department of Corporations and failing to clear advertising with the agency 
-- did not give Keating and the others a specific idea of what they did wrong. 
</P>
<P>
In amending 20 of the 22 counts that were set aside, the prosecution still 
alleges that Keating and the others sold securities without authority, but it 
left out the passage alleging that they exceeded the authority they had. 
</P>
<P>
Smaltz contends that since American Continental had authority to sell bonds, 
the defendants didn't violate the state law listed in the indictment.

</P>
<P>
Union members at Chrysler plants ratified the agreement by better than 4 to 1, 
the UAW said. The contract calls for a 3% wage increase in the first year and 
3% lump-sum payments in the second and third years. The deal also provides 
income guarantees for workers laid off from factories shut down because of 
slumping sales for more than 36 weeks.

Scientists Develop Superconducting Transistor: Government and University of 
Wisconsin researchers have developed the world's first high-temperature 
superconducting transistor, a device some hope will lead to faster computers 
and other improved electronic equipment. The transistor, used to control 
electrical current, is able to operate at higher subzero temperatures than 
earlier superconductors, scientists said. The transistor was developed at the 
University of Wisconsin and Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M.

MALL MAY GIVE BURBANK SOME RESPECT; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: THE MODEST DOWNTOWN HAS BEEN THE BUTT OF MANY JOKES, BUT THE EARLY 
SUCCESS OF THE NEW MEDIA CITY CENTER COULD PUT AN END TO THAT. 
</P>

The night before the Ikea furniture store opened its doors in Burbank, Fred 
Bruning had trouble sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
"I was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, saying what if they don't come?" 
recalled Bruning, chief of staff of Alexander Haagen Co., developer of the 
$300-million Media City Center shopping mall where Ikea is the first tenant. 
</P>
<P>
But shoppers came in droves, making Bruning's job easier. The hoopla 
surrounding Ikea's opening persuaded at least three other retailers to go ahead 
and open stores in the 1-million-square-foot center, which is Burbank's first 
major shopping mall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The mall's developers weren't the only people breathing a sigh of relief. 
Burbank officials see the development as a beginning of a renaissance for its 
downtown -- long lampooned by Johnny Carson and others who poked fun at the 
city, partly because of its downtown of modest, mostly single-story buildings. 
For example, KNBC weatherman Fritz Coleman once quipped about Burbank's 
founding: "A town with one bank and one Burger King, so they just shortened the 
name." 
</P>
<P>
But the development -- designed to ultimately include four office buildings and 
a hotel -- is going forward at a time of uncertainty for the economy. It is the 
only big shopping center currently under development in California -- others 
have been shelved because of the sluggish economy, Bruning said. Ikea's hit 
opening does not guarantee success for the entire mall in the long run. The 
mall might even run into problems signing up smaller stores if they suffer 
through a weak Christmas elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Zugsmith, who runs a commercial real estate brokerage in the San Fernando 
Valley, said: "If this holiday goes poorly, they'll have a difficult time 
leasing out those satellite shops." 
</P>
<P>
Bruning agreed, conceding: "Some tenants that have given us commitments might 
not go forward if it's a terrible Christmas" for them. But he and city 
officials said Ikea's initial splash bodes well, particularly because Ikea will 
always be crucial to the entire mall. 
</P>
<P>
"We were pleasantly surprised and pleased," said William Kelly, deputy city 
manager and director of redevelopment for Burbank. "It clearly showed how 
strong a magnet or target store it's going to be." 
</P>
<P>
The mall might also benefit from the relative affluence of Burbank residents. 
Haagen's studies show that, despite an old stereotype about Burbank being a 
blue-collar town, the average household income within a five-mile radius of the 
Media City Center is $2,500 higher than that in the same radius around the 
nearby Glendale Galleria. 
</P>
<P>
That statistic helped persuade Bullock's, a unit of R. H. Macy &amp; Co., to 
come aboard, Bruning said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruning said Burbank has other factors that should help the mall. For instance, 
the Glendale Galleria suffers from its own success, with parking and congestion 
frequently a problem that will send people next door to Burbank, Bruning said. 
The Media City Center's site alongside Interstate 5 offers easy access from the 
San Fernando, San Gabriel and Santa Clarita valleys, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Novak, a marketing consultant for Haagen, also noted that the 
entertainment industry -- an enormous presence in Burbank -- often does well 
when the economy suffers. (The mall's name refers to the area's entertainment, 
or media, district.) People look to the movies and other entertainment for 
escape and as a less-expensive outlet than, say, a vacation, Novak said. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Burbank has more at stake in the shopping mall than its pride. 
Instead of buying the property, Haagen, a Manhattan Beach-based concern that 
has built about 50 shopping centers over its 35-year history, leased the land 
from the city for 95 years in exchange for giving the city 50% of its profit 
from the project. Estimates show that the profit could be $1 million by 1996, 
with half going to the city, Bruning said. If Haagen ever sells the center, the 
city would get half of the proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
Although signing up tenants for the shopping mall is going well, things are 
moving much slower for the other elements of the 41-acre project. 
</P>
<P>
No major tenant has yet signed up for the office space. The first tenant is 
expected to sign on by early next year, said C. Drew Planting, senior broker at 
Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the offices' leasing agent. The first office buildings 
are expected to break ground next summer. 
</P>
<P>
However, broker Zugsmith sees potential problems there as well. There's ample 
office space in the area, and Lockheed Corp.'s departure from Burbank is adding 
to it because firms that served Lockheed are cutting back or closing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the hotel, negotiations are under way with Sheraton, a unit of ITT 
Corp., but that project also has not been finalized, Bruning said.

LABOR: GOP'S FIGHT WITH UNION POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Union strength in the workplace has dwindled, but, not satisfied with that, 
many Republicans are now pressing for legislation to weaken labor's still 
impressive strength in the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to blunt the increasingly sharp political tools that unions use to 
get their nearly 20 million members to vote for labor-endorsed candidates, most 
of whom are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican battle plan is primarily designed to block the methods unions 
utilize to register members, get them to the polls on time and explain why 
their leaders think they should vote for labor-endorsed candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Unions have long used phone banks, door-to-door visits, mass mailings and 
computers to ask their members to support labor's endorsed candidates. Now they 
have refined and increased the use of those techniques, employing computers and 
sophisticated telemarketing methods. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional Republicans have introduced bills to stop the use of union dues 
to finance these labor tactics, which depend on costly communications between 
union leaders and their members in political campaigns. That restriction of 
freedom for unions will be tricky for Republicans to impose because it would 
also mean restricting support they get themselves from business and other 
political action committees. That was one reason why campaign-financing 
legislation wasn't adopted by the just-concluded session of Congress. But 
determined Republicans such as Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) say they are going to 
push ahead "to protect the rights of the working man" by limiting the use of 
union money in politics. 
</P>
<P>
Most Democrats oppose the bills, and the Democrats control both the House and 
Senate. However, if the Republicans accept limitations on the support they get 
from their own allies, they might get the limitations they want on the 
political freedoms of unions too, all in the name of campaign reform. 
</P>
<P>
The GOP would get the best of the bargain since unions are still the single 
most effective political institution in the country, because their influence is 
felt in almost every race from presidential contests to small town elections. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of union members -- between 60% and 65% -- usually votes Democratic 
and that makes them a decisive force, especially in close elections. 
</P>
<P>
Unions have been the decisive force in nominating the Democratic presidential 
candidates through primary elections. The defeats by Republican rivals in 
general elections in recent years don't diminish the importance of the role 
unions play in choosing the Democratic Party's presidential nominee. 
</P>
<P>
True, the continuing influence of unions in politics contrasts sharply with 
their declining strength in the workplace: While the total number of union 
members has remained steady in recent years, unions now represent only about 
17% of the work force, compared to more than 40% a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But even so, unions' political strength remains greater than that of any other 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Liberals, labor and minorities who once formed a solid core of support for the 
Democrats are still predominantly Democratic voters. In fact, a larger 
percentage of Jews (74%) and blacks (78%) voted for Democratic candidates in 
races for the House on Nov. 6 than union members (65%) did. 
</P>
<P>
But only labor unions have a national organization to help coordinate their 
political activities among their widely disparate members whose only common 
bond is their union. About 30% of union members are Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Business puts up more money for Republicans than labor does for Democrats, but, 
like Jews, blacks and other identifiable blocs of voters, business doesn't have 
something like the AFL-CIO Committee on Political Education (COPE) to unify 
their political activities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Another union strength is the proportion of them who actually vote. Nearly half 
of all union members voted in the last election, in contrast to about 36% of 
the electorate as a whole, and one key reason for that turnout is labor's 
registration and get-out-the-vote campaign that the Republicans are so anxious 
to stop. 
</P>
<P>
In the closely watched governor's race in California, the loser, Democrat 
Dianne Feinstein, got 60% of the labor vote statewide and 65% in this area, 
where the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor put on a particularly strong 
campaign for her. The Republican effort to weaken labor's political influence 
is aimed at just such tactics used by labor here. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, William R. Robertson, head of the county labor federation, said 
the federation assembled 75 members who made more than 24,000 phone calls 
beginning a month before the election asking members whether they were for 
Feinstein, Republican Pete Wilson or undecided. They were also asked which 
issues were most important to them in the governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
Then the name of each undecided member and the issue of most concern to him or 
her were sent by computer modem to the AFL-CIO COPE in Washington. A 
"persuasion" letter signed by Robertson was sent to each of the undecided 
members explaining the position of Feinstein and labor on that issue. The 
members were called again to see if they had decided to back Feinstein, and 
finally, all the Feinstein supporters received a postcard from the federation 
reminding them to vote, and they got another "don't-forget-to-vote" phone call 
on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
You don't need to be a political consultant to understand why most Republican 
politicians want to deny unions the right to use union money to try and 
persuade their members to vote for labor-backed candidates: It would be a 
quick, if unsavory, way to cripple some of the GOP's most effective opponents.

HAWAIIAN AIR REPORTS $13.3-MILLION LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The parent company of Hawaiian Airlines, a troubled firm part-owned by former 
Olympic organizer Peter V. Ueberroth, said Monday that it defaulted on some 
aircraft leases and on a loan from Security Pacific Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The defaults came amid continued losses at HAL Inc. HAL said Monday that it 
lost $13.3 million for the third quarter, bringing its loss to $56.3 million 
for the first nine months of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the third quarter was $101.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The loss wiped out the company's net worth, which now stands at negative $50.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
HAL's default on its bank loan is surprising, since it came less than two weeks 
after Security agreed to give the firm an additional $20 million. The fresh 
financing brought HAL out of default on a $111-million loan, also from 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
As previously reported, HAL at that time granted Security warrants that could 
make the bank its biggest shareholder. Federal regulations, however, prevent 
Security from exercising most of the warrants. Banking industry analysts have 
said that Security could possibly sell the warrants at a profit if the airline 
ever works out its problems. 
</P>
<P>
HAL said that during September and October it failed to pay $3.3 million on 
leases for 17 aircraft and is in default on those leases. Glen Stewart, senior 
vice president-finance, said the firm has negotiated new leases with five 
aircraft lessors and is attempting to negotiate new agreements with others. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian leases all but two of the 36 aircraft in its fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said the company hopes to save $2 million a year by negotiating either 
lower lease payments or the postponement of payments. Stewart said HAL, with 
$12.5 million in cash at the end of the third quarter, had funds needed to make 
the lease payments.

GLENDALE PROPERTY APPRAISER GETS 5 YEARS PROBATION 
</P>

<P>
A Glendale real estate appraiser on Monday was given five years probation for 
conspiring to falsify the books of defunct Consolidated Savings Bank in Irvine 
and for failing to file income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Harry Hupp also ordered Harlan Wolfe to provide 750 
hours of community service, cooperate with the Internal Revenue Service in 
figuring his tax bill from 1983 through 1987, and file timely and truthful 
income tax returns in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe, 61, pleaded guilty Aug. 27 to conspiring to prepare a phony appraisal of 
a home for Consolidated so that the thrift's books would disguise a crooked 
real estate loan to unnamed straw borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Los Angeles court's sentence, Wolfe needs approval from probation 
officials to do any appraisal work during his probation. He had faced a maximum 
sentence of nine years in prison and a $650,000 fine. Prosecutors sought a 
one-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Gregory D. Schetina said Wolfe, who completed 80 to 100 
appraisals for Consolidated in little more than a year, was asked by 
co-conspirators to provide a fraudulent appraisal to create a phony impression 
for regulators that a loan to two straw borrowers was sound. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe falsely represented that a Laguna Beach property was a custom-built 
oceanfront home worth $850,000 when it really was a tract home several miles 
from the beach worth $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift funneled $500,000 of the loan amount to Pyrotronics Corp., an 
Anaheim fireworks company that was owned by Orange County businessman W. 
Patrick Moriarty. Moriarty, a business associate of Consolidated owner Robert 
A. Ferrante, served 29 months in jail for his conviction in a separate case on 
charges political corruption.

HOLIDAY RUSH: Sheriff Brad Gates, trying to keep the jail population within 
court-ordered limits, has asked local judges to forsake a longstanding holiday 
tradition. . . . Reluctant to lock up less serious prisoners over the holidays, 
judges typically stay sentences until Jan. 2. The result: up to 1,000 people 
lining up for booking on the day after New Year's. . . . Gates is asking that 
the rush be spread over four to six weeks, and Superior Court Presiding Judge 
Leonard Goldstein says judges will try to cooperate. Jim Newton and Jerry Hicks

SOVIETS WANT TO BE PARTNERS BUT NOT 'YES MEN' TO WEST; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: GORBACHEV PLEDGES COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. AND ITS ALLIES. BUT HE 
RESISTS A ME-TOO POLICY.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev pledged a new relationship of cooperation 
with the United States and its Western allies Monday, but he immediately made 
clear that for Moscow it will not be a me-too partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring the Persian Gulf crisis a "grave test" for those framing the new 
international order, Gorbachev nevertheless refused to give President Bush an 
immediate go-ahead for the use of military force to oust Iraq from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush pressed Gorbachev hard to endorse a new U.N. Security Council 
resolution authorizing the use of force in the gulf, the Soviet president 
called instead for further efforts to secure a political resolution of the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we all need patience," Gorbachev said as the two leaders, who are 
attending the summit-level Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
began a lengthy dinner meeting that focused on the gulf crisis. If he was not 
ready to sign on to Bush's timetable during the opening day of the Paris 
summit, Gorbachev also kept his options open for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"That does not mean that we are going to relax or retreat," Gorbachev 
immediately added. "No, we are going to demand (Iraq's withdrawal) in a very 
resolute way. 
</P>
<P>
"And the fact that we are working together -- not only the Soviet Union and the 
United States, but the United Nations and the whole world are acting together 
-- allows me to expect that in this very difficult crisis a solution will be 
found. And we will not waste time." 
</P>
<P>
The point that Gorbachev made emphatically to Bush, according to senior Soviet 
officials, was that the time had not yet come for war -- and thus, a new U.N. 
resolution authorizing the use of force was premature, even as a threat. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the united front the world has taken in opposing Iraq's 
aggression is proving effective and that, fully enforced, the sanctions that 
the U.N. has imposed will work," a Gorbachev adviser said earlier Monday. "We 
have not exhausted the political means at our disposal, and we must use every 
such possibility before we contemplate the use of force. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that this crisis not only challenges the peaceful world order that 
we see emerging here in Europe, between the East and the West and between the 
Soviet Union and the United States, but that it is important -- very important 
-- for the crisis to be resolved politically in order to incorporate this 
approach in the pattern of international relations." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Soviet Union would veto a U.N. resolution authorizing the use 
of force, a senior Gorbachev aide told a news conference, "No, we would discuss 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Vadim V. Zagladin, one of Gorbachev's foreign policy advisers, said, "This 
question does not really stand before us because we have not exhausted the 
political and economic measures that are available. We have many possibilities, 
many ideas, and we will continue on the political path." 
</P>
<P>
In taking this approach, Gorbachev is creating problems for Bush. But he is 
carefully positioning the Soviet Union in its new relationship with the United 
States and the West, believing that the crisis and its outcome will not only 
test the new world order but also shape it. 
</P>
<P>
"Our unity in condemning (Iraq's aggression) and our shared concern over the 
outcome of the crisis are indicative of a radical shift in our mind-set and the 
perception of the goals and means available in world politics," Gorbachev told 
the CSCE gathering. "Any armed attack, wherever it may occur, now serves to 
close our ranks rather than divide us further. 
</P>
<P>
"In urging the aggressor's withdrawal from Kuwait, we are defending the hope 
millions of people have begun to pin on the ability of the international 
community to cope with exceptionally sharp conflicts. Otherwise, much of what 
we have accomplished in the past few years would be in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev told the conference that "today the Soviet Union and the United 
States no longer act as adversaries but as partners." But he also made clear 
that Moscow brings to that partnership its own perceptions, analyses and 
approaches. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union is looking for dialogue based on what Gorbachev calls "common 
human values" and is seeking cooperation based on equality. 
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to cooperate, but we will not be led," another senior Soviet 
official said Monday, referring both to the U.S.-Soviet discussions on the gulf 
crisis and the evolving relationship. "The Bush Administration may be 
misreading us on this. We are not the classic ally, we are not subservient, we 
are not yes men. We want to be partners, and we do have our own ideas and 
principles." 
</P>
<P>
Under Gorbachev, the Soviet Union has adopted a foreign policy based on the 
peaceful resolution, if possible, of all conflicts based on what Moscow calls 
"a balance of interests." 
</P>
<P>
From the outset of the gulf crisis in August, Moscow has condemned Iraq's 
seizure of Kuwait and supported Washington in the mobilization of the 
international community against the action. Its assistance was essential in 
securing United Nations sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, Moscow has insisted that every effort be made to find a 
political solution based on Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait; the restoration of 
Kuwaiti sovereignty and independence, and then perhaps a settlement of Iraq's 
grievances against Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Zagladin said the Soviet Union believes that the disastrous consequences of a 
full-scale war in the Persian Gulf have not been fully assessed by the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict would have "a potentially catastrophic impact" throughout the 
Middle East, he told a news conference, and would result in a new Arab-Israeli 
war. "The economic impact would be even larger, reaching from London to New 
York to Tokyo to Frankfurt . . . and even, in ecological terms, the use of 
chemical weapons and the destruction of the oil fields should not be 
underestimated." 
</P>
<P>
THE SUMMIT -AT-A-GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
Leaders representing 34 countries in the CSCE were on hand in Paris on Monday 
for the start of a three-day summit billed as an epic event that will set the 
stage for cooperation in post-Cold War Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE CONFERENCE HISTORY 
</P>
<P>
The present-day CSCE has its roots in the 1975 signing of the Helsinki Final 
Act, which aimed to foster improved relations within the European community. 
The agreement touched upon issues of security and formed a basis for 
collaboration in humanitarian, economic, scientific and environmental fields. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MAJOR AGENDA ITEMS 
</P>
<P>
The signing of agreements to reduce non-nuclear forces in Europe and to commit 
NATO and the Warsaw Pact to closer cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Institutionalization of the CSCE, setting up a small secretariat in Prague, a 
center in Vienna for the prevention of conflict and an office in Warsaw to help 
monitor elections. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal that the heads of member states meet at least once every two years, 
their foreign ministers annually. 
</P>
<P>
France is proposing creation of a conciliation process to resolve differences 
between member states regarding ethnic minorities.

FRENCH PREMIER SURVIVES VOTE; 
</P>
<P>
LEADERS: LAST-MINUTE SUPPORT FROM MODERATE RIGHTISTS HELPS ROCARD TURN BACK A 
CHALLENGE. THATCHER FACES HER TEST TODAY.

<P>
French Prime Minister Michel Rocard, whose minority government faced loss of a 
censure vote in the National Assembly that would have forced him to resign, won 
last-minute support from moderate right-wing parties late Monday night to 
survive the most serious challenge of his two years in office. 
</P>
<P>
Rocard was the first of two key European heads of government threatened with 
the embarrassing prospect of losing their jobs while a 34-nation summit of 
world leaders, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, meets here 
in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Today, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will be tested when 
Conservative Party members of Parliament vote on a challenge to her party 
leadership from former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine. If Thatcher loses, 
she would have to step down from the prime minister's post she has held for 
more than 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
The last British leader to lose his post during an international meeting was 
Prime Minister Winston Churchill during the Potsdam conference in 1945. Despite 
the pressure, Thatcher was the picture of poise and confidence Monday morning 
as she met with reporters at the British Embassy in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"I most earnestly believe I shall be at No. 10 Downing at the end of this 
week," she said, referring to the prime minister's official residence in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the short, combative French leader Rocard was being credited by 
supporters with "Churchillian" courage as his minority Socialist Party 
leadership overcame its ninth censure vote since it was installed after 
parliamentary elections in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
This time the challenge was based on opposition to a 1.1% income tax Rocard has 
proposed as part of a reform of funding for Social Security programs. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Socialists do not have an absolute majority in the 577-member 
National Assembly, Rocard needed 17 votes or abstentions from other parties to 
survive the censure vote. In the past, the Socialists had always been able to 
count on the 26 Communist Party deputies in the Assembly to back them in 
censure votes, the French equivalent of a parliamentary vote of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
However, this time the Communists decided to vote for censure, forcing the 
Socialists to find the needed votes among independents and members of center 
and center-right parties. In the end, the Socialists survived the vote by 
persuading six right-wing deputies, mostly from the French overseas 
territories, to break ranks with their parties. The opposition mustered 284 
votes, five short of the absolute majority needed. 
</P>
<P>
Rocard, 60, never gave signs of losing confidence. "I approach this vote with 
serenity," he said. However, he gave a deep sigh of relief when National 
Assembly Speaker Laurent Fabius read the vote results before the packed 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
If Rocard had lost the vote, French President Francois Mitterrand would have 
had to appoint a new prime minister or call for new elections. Mitterrand has 
been criticized for not giving longtime Socialist Party rival Rocard enough 
support during the censure vote debate. 
</P>
<P>
But the French president, 73, whose seven-year term will not expire until 1995, 
is also known to dread the possibility of elections leading to a right-wing 
opposition majority in Parliament, forcing him to install another so-called 
cohabitation government like the one he shared with Gaullist Prime Minister 
Jacques Chirac in 1986-1988. 
</P>
<P>
Because he has been forced to govern without a majority, Rocard has been under 
constant challenge since his appointment by Mitterrand two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, however, is the longest-serving national leader among the 34 CSCE 
member countries meeting in Paris. She became party leader when she deposed 
Edward Heath in 1975, when the Conservatives were in opposition, and became 
prime minister in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the opposition Labor Party, the Tory party rules provide for annual 
elections to determine the party leader. And whoever is voted leader 
traditionally becomes prime minister if the party is in power. 
</P>
<P>
British public opinion polls published Sunday and Monday show Thatcher trailing 
Heseltine -- among voters -- by a considerable margin. 
</P>
<P>
However, Tuesday's balloting is restricted to the 372 Tory members of the House 
of Commons. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews Monday, the prime minister accused Heseltine of holding political 
views indistinguishable from those of the Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Heseltine contends that Thatcher is only lukewarm in supporting a 
strong role for Britain within the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Asked at a press conference at the British Embassy here Monday if she would be 
returning home to a new address, the prime minister said she expects to stay in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Why is she so confident? 
</P>
<P>
"I have a marvelous team working with me," she replied. "We are all confident." 
</P>
<P>
Is she under a strain? 
</P>
<P>
"Not in any way. I've been attending conferences like these for 11 1/2 years. 
It's an almost everyday occurrence."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was supposed to be a summit marking the end of the Cold War, but Paris 
looked like a city under siege. The three-day meeting of the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe opened Monday in a tense melange of pomp and 
high security that snarled traffic and pushed the short-fused Parisian populace 
to the verge of explosion. 
</P>
<P>
At times Monday it was difficult to tell which looked more threatening -- the 
lines of heavily armed police or the outraged French citizenry who live and 
work in the central Paris neighborhoods where most of the summit events are 
taking place. 
</P>
<P>
Incensed over traffic jams and summit-related security zones accessible only to 
people bearing special passes, Parisians vented their rage to neighbors, 
television crews, parking meter police and anyone else who would listen. 
</P>
<P>
Although the French government had worked hard to win the summit for Paris, 
doctors complained that they were blocked from visiting their patients. 
Truckers fumed about missing deliveries. Restaurant owners faced empty dining 
rooms and demanded that the government pick up the tab. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm writing (French President Francois) Mitterrand," said Michele Plante, 73, 
owner of Le Cotton Restaurant, not far from the Kleber International Conference 
Center, where the summit meetings are being held. "In order for our customers 
to get here, they would have to park 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) away and come by 
foot. I pay taxes. The government owes me for this. A three-day summit is three 
days too long." 
</P>
<P>
With 34 heads of state and government in town for the meetings, the French were 
taking no chances on the security front. Ten thousand Paris police, gendarmes 
and military security specialists lined the streets in central Paris near the 
Kleber Center and outside key hotels and embassies. 
</P>
<P>
Tough-looking Compagnie de Securite Republicaine (CRS) police -- including 
specially trained anti-terrorist brigades outfitted in black flight jackets and 
paratroop-style jumpsuits -- stood outside luxury hotels next to doormen in 
livery and top hats. Upscale shopping streets such as the Rue du Faubourg 
Saint-Honore -- where Hermes, Yves Saint-Laurent and Gucci all have boutiques 
-- were virtually closed to shoppers who did not have special passes during key 
hours of the day. 
</P>
<P>
In the ultra-sensitive three-block area surrounding the Kleber Center, not far 
from the Arc de Triomphe in the stolidly bourgeois 16th District of Paris, 
subway stations were closed and all traffic halted except for police and 
official motorcades. Police units even took the precaution of cramming coiled 
bunches of razor-sharp concertina wire into manholes to block potential routes 
for terrorists through the famous Paris sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
But while security was extremely taut in some spots, it was surprisingly loose 
in others. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters attending the signing of the historic conventional arms treaty Monday 
morning at the Elysee Palace were amazed when guards barely glanced at their 
credentials, although President Bush, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and other world leaders were all 
inside the palace, sitting comfortably under crystal chandeliers and priceless 
Gobelin tapestries in the ornate Salles des Fetes ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the summit, traffic and the perpetual Paris traffic jams known as 
bouchons (literally, "corks") or embouteillages ("bottlenecks") were already 
favorite topics of conversation in the French capital -- second only, perhaps, 
to the traditional French preoccupation with liver problems. But the Parisian's 
frustration with traffic has reached a new high with the CSCE summit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to closed streets, roadblocks and the presence of hundreds of 
additional police vehicles in the city, the continual high-speed parade of 
official motorcades on the narrow streets has the city tied in knots. At one 
point Monday morning, 48 different official motorcades, each with a fleet of 
security cars and motorcycle escorts, were on the road, klaxons blaring and 
lights flashing. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the summit gridlock in the capital, an anchorman on one of the 
French television networks came up with a new meaning for the acronym CSCE. 
Instead of Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, he suggested the 
following French version: Conducteurs Serieusement Coinces dans Embouteillages 
("Drivers Seriously Trapped in Traffic Jams"). 
</P>
<P>
Given all the pre-summit hype comparing the event to the 1813-1814 Congress of 
Vienna and other epoch-changing events, it was nice to see that the 
literature-loving French hadn't lost their sense of priorities. Only moments 
after the historic conventional arms reduction treaty was signed Monday morning 
at the Elysee Palace, the leading story on Antenne 2, the main state-owned 
television network, was not the summit but the announcement that the 
prestigious book award, the Prix Goncourt, had been give to author Jean Rouaud 
for his novel "Champs d'Honneur" (Fields of Honor). 
</P>
<P>
Before winning instant fame for his novel, Rouaud worked selling newspapers at 
a corner stand. The novel centers on the lives of a French family that lost 
many of its members in World War I, which Rouaud, oblivious to the fall of the 
Berlin Wall and the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, called "the main 
event of our age." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem in maintaining security at the Paris summit is that with 34 
national leaders attending, the number of enemies and potential attackers 
increases almost exponentially. Nearly every leader has some group or national 
separatist movement back home that opposes him or her. Nearly all the 
separatist movements have representatives in France, which prides itself as a 
haven for political exiles. 
</P>
<P>
Several leaders have multiple opponents. For example, French police are giving 
special security protection to Turkish President Turgut Ozal, who is opposed by 
Armenian as well as Kurdish militants. Other world leaders given enhanced 
security are British Prime Minister Thatcher, the leading target of the Irish 
Republican Army, and Gorbachev, who may have been the target of a potential 
assassin in Red Square last week. 
</P>
<P>
An additional police unit was assigned to Canadian Prime Minister Brian 
Mulroney after police received a tip that French-speaking Mohawk Indians were 
in town and looking for the Canadian leader's scalp. 
</P>
<P>
Back home in Quebec, the Mohawks are involved in a bitter, occasionally 
violent, feud with the Canadian government over land rights and other issues. 
According to the police tip, a contingent of Mohawks planned to set up camp 
under Mulroney's window at the luxury Plaza Athenee hotel on the Avenue 
Montaigne. 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney spokesman Gilbert Lavoie said Monday that the Canadian delegation was 
on the lookout but so far had seen no sign of the Mohawks. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush is well known for his fast-paced golf game, but he may have set 
an all-time speed record of a sort that will win no hearts here: shortest time 
spent eating dinner at the Elysee Palace, where he dined with President 
Mitterrand on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner is usually a leisurely ritual at the Elysee, official residence and 
office of French presidents. Although Bush staffers had set aside a respectable 
hour-and-a-half for the meal, French spokesman Hubert Vedrine said it concluded 
after only 45 minutes -- a rarity in the French culture, where food is often 
accompanied by conversation. 
</P>
<P>
The menu has not been disclosed. But the President may have simply been saving 
room for Thanksgiving, when he and wife Barbara are scheduled to eat a 
traditional turkey dinner with three different American units stationed in 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The world leaders were treated to a more traditional feast Monday at the 
Elysee. Presidential chefs presented Mitterrand's guests, including Bush, with 
a menu of a mousse of scallops accompanied by fresh-water crayfish; grilled 
Charolais beef with roasted shallots; artichoke heart cooked in olive oil; 
assorted cheeses, and a rich desert of chestnuts and cream. The wines were a 
1985 Burgundy, Beaune Clos des Mouches (about $100 a bottle); a 1978 Bordeaux, 
Chateau Grand Puy Lacoste ($80 a bottle), and a 1982 Champagne, Louis Pommery 
($75 a bottle). 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the menu was reviewed critically by leading chefs and restaurateurs. 
Jean-Claude Vrinat, owner of Taillevent, a Paris restaurant renowned for its 
wine list, praised the menu and the first two wines. 
</P>
<P>
He described the Bordeaux as a perfect wine for the beef course. "It's a wine 
that lets you go on working after you eat," he said. "I presume these people 
needed to work." However, Vrinat declared himself very disappointed by the 
choice of Champagne as the dessert wine. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't understand it," he said. "The chestnuts are a very rich dessert. 
It is an excellent Champagne, but I am afraid it may have been destroyed by the 
chestnuts. It is very sad."

ROMANIA STRIVES FOR STABILITY IN BREAK WITH PAST AS ECONOMY TAKES A FREE FALL

BRASOV, Romania 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is dividing and conquering Romania nearly a year after its anti-Communist 
revolt is that "some people are satisfied with half a loaf of bread." 
</P>
<P>
Engineer Raluca Nan's condemnation of those who feel they have blessings to 
count is a view shared by many educated professionals seeking to oust the 
Romanian leadership elected only six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Her assessment is accurate but unsettling, since it highlights a broadening 
chasm separating Romania's 23 million citizens. 
</P>
<P>
There are those willing to tough out continued privation, hesitantly putting 
faith in government assurances of eventual relief from the suffering 
institutionalized under late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
And there are those, like Nan, who accuse fearful countrymen of being taken in 
by ex-Communists who hijacked the revolution in order to thwart its intended 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
What bodes ill for Romania's stability is the opposition's ready concession 
that it is a minority unwilling to submit to majority rule. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the majority supports a second revolution, because the majority 
is not thinking," said Nan, one of 12,000 who marched through this 
Transylvanian industrial city recently to protest price increases and demand 
that the government resign. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations that have drawn as many as 200,000 Romanians to the streets have 
called for the ouster of President Ion Iliescu, who won 87% of the May vote 
that foreign observers said was flawed but generally reflective of the people's 
will. 
</P>
<P>
Unrelenting opposition has nudged Romania dangerously close to the kind of 
turmoil paralyzing Bulgaria, where another intellectual minority angered by the 
peasantry's electoral choice has rendered the new government powerless to 
arrest an economic free fall. 
</P>
<P>
Getting tough with dissenters is not an option for Prime Minister Petre Roman, 
who has been struggling to show democratic tolerance and win back Western trust 
since Iliescu's disastrous June decision to quell unrest with a vigilante 
rampage. 
</P>
<P>
Roman and his technocrat allies are intent on radical transition of the 
stagnant economy and have vowed not to be deterred by opposition efforts at 
"government from the streets." 
</P>
<P>
Yet some ministers seem to have distanced themselves from the president and his 
populist National Salvation Front, perhaps hoping to save their reform program 
-- and their positions -- in the event Iliescu is forced to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Introduction of sink-or-swim capitalism on Nov. 1 has turned up the volume of 
the anti-government protests, but Roman insists the transition to a market 
economy is irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times, the 44-year-old prime 
minister said radical reforms are needed to stir Romanian workers from a 
post-revolutionary slumber that has decimated the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"We explained very clearly to everyone several times that price liberalization 
is the first tool to affect a new economic dynamic," said Roman, whose 
ministerial headquarters is still abuzz with activity at 7 p.m. "It's very 
simple. No work, no pay. Now, people have to work at a certain level to live in 
normal conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Romanians underwent a much-needed "decompression" after Ceausescu's overthrow 
and execution, but Roman said the relaxation has gone too far. Industrial 
output is down 30% from last year, threatening Romania's very survival. 
</P>
<P>
"We have calculated that the best way to reduce the adverse effects of 
unemployment and inflation is to step very quickly over this transition 
period," Roman said. "We believe the old saying 'Long illness, sure death.' I 
want to avoid the funeral of the Romanian economy." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most other countries in Eastern Europe, Romania carries very little 
foreign debt, which gives it some leeway with credit to revamp outdated 
production equipment. 
</P>
<P>
But Roman said his country will not make the mistake of borrowing to finance 
consumption, even though imports could ease mounting popular resistance to his 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"For the basic, immediate needs, we are not worried," said the English-speaking 
prime minister. "Food products exist, as our agricultural performance this year 
was acceptable. We can ensure sufficient supply for at least the next three 
months, and we are not touching the price of basic foods, heat or electricity 
or, for the moment, the question of rents." 
</P>
<P>
Expecting producers to set prices for their goods according to what the market 
will bear has effectively frozen internal trade, as inexperienced buyers and 
sellers learn the art of negotiation and compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Store shelves are virtually empty, but Bucharest officials promise that relief 
is on the horizon. Cars and appliances costing twice what they used to are now 
available, and perishable foods not exempt from the price increases are 
appearing at random in produce stands. 
</P>
<P>
Most enterprises remain under state ownership but have been put on notice that 
they must pay their own way or declare bankruptcy in a state incapable of being 
generous with its jobless. A law requiring wages to be negotiated between 
management and labor is expected within a few weeks, and modest funds for 
unemployment are already being set aside. 
</P>
<P>
The government has advised failing factories that return to a six-day workweek, 
as was standard practice under Ceausescu, may be their only hope of recovery 
and survival. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the worldwide oil crisis and the trade embargo against Iraq, which 
repaid debts to Romania with fuel shipments, Romania's energy outlook this 
winter is grim. The government has promised to maintain home heating at 68 
degrees Fahrenheit, but harsh temperatures could force rationing of electricity 
or closure of inefficient factories on the coldest days. 
</P>
<P>
The economic difficulties add up to living conditions only marginally better 
than before the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
At grocery stores in the heart of Brasov, one of Romania's biggest cities, the 
stock in mid-November was limited to macaroni, six types of canned fruits and 
vegetables, pretzels, Vietnamese shrimp crackers and powdered detergent. 
Shoppers queued for hours at separate stores selling meat and bread, which 
cannot be distributed efficiently because of a lack of portioning and packaging 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no cause for hope in young families," complained Ovidiu Popa, a 
27-year-old building engineer at a Brasov protest against the ruling front last 
week. "There's no money for our work, and now it costs a year's salary to buy a 
kitchen stove." 
</P>
<P>
"No leadership can submit to government from the streets," claimed Roman's 
chief of staff, Baltazar Bogdan. "But we are powerless to stop the protests." 
</P>
<P>
Western governments have refused to lift economic sanctions against Romania 
stemming from the June crackdown on anti-government demonstrators, which has 
served to deter further excesses of power as well as foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a retroactive guilt complex in the West," Bogdan said, alluding to 
U.S. extension of special trade status to Romania during the years of 
dictatorship. "They feel they were taken by Ceausescu once, and they will look 
very carefully at 'these bloody Romanians' this time around." 
</P>
<P>
But without Western support, "we won't make it," Bogdan said. "Romania is 
coming out of a long, long illness."

EGYPT RAISES TOLLS FOR SHIPS IN SUEZ CANAL

The Suez Canal Authority on Monday announced increases in tolls for ships 
passing through the waterway and predicted a heavy decline in revenues if war 
erupts in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Suez Canal Authority Chairman Mohammed Ezzat Adel said that toll fees for all 
vessels, except dry bulk carriers, will increase by 6% in January. The increase 
for dry bulk carriers will be only 4% due to market slackness, Adel said. 
</P>
<P>
Adel, speaking to reporters on the 121st anniversary of the opening of the Suez 
Canal and the passage of the 500,000th ship, said he expects the gulf crisis to 
reduce revenues this year by about 10%.

A building in the early stages of construction four blocks from the White House 
collapsed Monday night. Three construction trailers and a van, parked on the 
sidewalk or in the street, tumbled into the excavation site at 14th and H 
streets northwest as ground at the site caved in, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They said the apparent cause was vibrations from a faulty transformer, whose 
spectacular arcing could be seen for blocks. 
</P>
<P>
The noisy collapse forced workers to evacuate from United Press International 
World Headquarters next door and from other nearby office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word on any injuries. Special teams were called to 
descend into the four-story-deep hole on ropes as officials sought to determine 
whether the site was vulnerable to further collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Service was suspended on a subway line running past the area, with trains 
turning back at nearby stations on either side.

BENNETT, BUSH CHOICE FOR GOP CHAIRMAN, CRITICIZES AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAMS; 
</P>
<P>

STRATEGISTS SEE IT AS A WAY TO DIVIDE THE DEMOCRATS.

William J. Bennett, President Bush's choice to be the next Republican national 
chairman, Monday declared his unequivocal opposition to the principle 
underlying most affirmative action programs, an issue that is expected to be a 
focal point for partisan debate in the 1992 struggle for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the idea of affirmative action -- giving people credit for a 
job in the absence of a showing of prior discrimination simply on the basis of 
their race -- is wrong," Bennett told reporters at a press luncheon here. This 
was his first public appearance since Republican sources disclosed over the 
weekend that Bush had chosen him to replace the ailing Lee Atwater as chairman 
of the Republican National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's wrong to say to somebody in the absence of a showing of prior 
discrimination: 'You are black you get X points, you are white you don't"' get 
any, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how big an issue affirmative action will be in the 1992 campaign debate, 
the 47-year-old Bennett, who recently announced his resignation as director of 
the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, said: "It all depends 
how much Democrats want to do about it." 
</P>
<P>
But Republicans believe that the potential effectiveness of the issue was 
demonstrated during the recent midterm election campaign when Republican Sen. 
Jesse Helms of North Carolina used an ad accusing Harvey Gantt, his black 
Democratic opponent, of favoring racial quotas. The ad showed the hands of a 
white worker tearing up a job rejection letter. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover some Democrats have accused Bush of setting the stage for Republicans 
to attack on this issue by contending that the 1990 civil rights bill that he 
vetoed would impose quotas in hiring and promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Most affirmative action programs are designed to correct for deep-rooted and 
long-standing patterns of discrimination without requiring specific evidence in 
each case. But Bennett called this approach "a violation of our most basic 
values." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett indicated that he supports what he called "the original notion of 
affirmative action . . . to make sure that everybody has the opportunity to get 
their name in" when there is competition for jobs and promotion. But he said 
that he objects to the idea of implementing this principle by showing 
preference to a job applicant simply because of his or her race, religion or 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
He said that most Americans "are troubled" by this concept and do not believe 
that "this is a recipe for improving race relations." 
</P>
<P>
As Bennett pointed out, he has long held these views on affirmative action and 
once set them forth in a book he co-authored called "Counting by Race." But 
these opinions take on extra salience with his choice as party leader. 
</P>
<P>
Republican strategists see affirmative action as what they call "a wedge 
issue," a way to split the various constituencies, such as blacks and 
blue-collar workers, which in the past have made up the Democratic Party's 
electoral coalition. Affirmative action is considered to be particularly 
important for the Republicans in 1992 because another wedge issue -- abortion 
-- has lost much of its potency for conservative candidates as a result of last 
year's Supreme Court decision that energized supporters of abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the possibility of a recession is threatening the economic 
prosperity which was a mainstay of Bush's appeal in the 1988 election. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett was reluctant to discuss his views on political strategy until his 
choice by Bush is officially announced. That is expected after the President 
returns from his current trip overseas. But he pointed out that he campaigned 
for Helms and said that he considered the controversial "white hands" 
television ad used by Helms as "perfectly legitimate."

APPLE GROWERS TO FILE LAWSUIT IN ALAR DISPUTE; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: ELEVEN FARMERS WILL SEEK $250 MILLION FROM '60 MINUTES' AND AN 
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP. THEY CHARGE 'PRODUCT DISPARAGEMENT.'

Washington state apple growers said they intend to seek $250 million in damages 
from CBS-TV's "60 Minutes" program and the Natural Resources Defense Council, 
an environmental group, for "product disparagement" stemming from last year's 
controversy over the use of Alar, a growth enhancement chemical, on apples. 
</P>
<P>
The Alar Class Action Committee, a coalition of growers, said it will file a 
lawsuit in Yakima County Superior Court on or before Nov. 30 charging that the 
NRDC used "bogus" information to create a hysteria about red apples last year. 
</P>
<P>
The NRDC published a study last year entitled "Intolerable Risk: Pesticides in 
Our Children's Food." In publicizing the report, the NRDC and a 
Washington-based public relations firm, Fenton Communications Inc., focused on 
the use of Alar, which in some cases is a suspected carcinogen. 
</P>
<P>
News of the study, which claimed that children are at a heightened risk of 
cancer from pesticide residues in produce, first aired on "60 Minutes" in 
February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"As apple growers, we suffered tremendous losses (because of) unscientific and 
unfounded information," said Robert Brody, a Wenatchee, Wash., apple grower who 
is one of 11 plaintiffs in the planned suit. "Extremists such as NRDC . . . are 
telling the American public that the farmer today is poisoning the food supply. 
We want to stop that crap." 
</P>
<P>
Industry estimates place 1989 losses to growers from consumer resistance to 
fresh apples at $150 million. Processors of juice and other apple products also 
lost another $100 million, the growers claim. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Burnett, a press representative for "60 Minutes" in New York, said: "We 
stand by our report." He declined to discuss the growers' specific complaints. 
Al Meyerhoff, a San Francisco-based attorney for the NRDC, said that the group 
had little to say until the growers' suit is actually filed. 
</P>
<P>
Food industry scientists charged that the NRDC study was not scrutinized by 
outside experts before publication and that it exaggerated cancer risks and 
embellished worst-case scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
David Fenton, president of Fenton Communications Inc., said that the NRDC 
report did undergo a peer review process and that "apple growers knew for years 
that Alar was dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Alar was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 1989 by its manufacturer, 
Uniroyal Chemical Co. Inc., after the federal Environmental Protection Agency 
announced a proposed ban of the compound.

SALARY PLAN WOULD BOOST PENSIONS FOR DEUKMEJIAN AND VAN DE KAMP; 
</P>
<P>
PAY: GOVERNOR'S RETIREMENT WOULD BE $72,000 ANNUALLY; THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S 
$40,000.

<P>
Proposed salary increases for state constitutional officers and legislators, 
slated to go into effect Dec. 3, would also give Gov. George Deukmejian a 
$21,000 higher annual pension, bringing his total to $72,000. Atty. Gen. John 
K. Van de Kamp would get a pension increase of $9,000, to $40,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Deukmejian and Van de Kamp served only one day at their higher 
salaries, they would be entitled to the increases, David Tirapelle, director of 
the state Department of Personnel Administration, said Monday. Each will have 
served about a month. 
</P>
<P>
The increases would result from a provision in state law providing that a 
retired official's pension is based on the highest salary he or she received 
before leaving office. Officials' pensions also get a cost-of-living increase 
each year, so the higher base would lead to future increases. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the new California Citizens Compensation Commission, created by 
Proposition 112 last June and then appointed by Deukmejian, tentatively decided 
to raise the governor's salary by 41%, from an annual $85,000 to $120,000, the 
attorney general's salary from $77,500 to $102,000, and legislators' base 
salary from $40,816 to $52,500. 
</P>
<P>
The commission has scheduled a public hearing on the matter Nov. 30, but has 
indicated that it will adopt the salary hikes with the increases to go into 
effect Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Because Dec. 3 is the day the new Legislature convenes, departing legislators 
would not be eligible for higher pensions, but Deukmejian and Van de Kamp, 
serving until January before giving up their offices, would be. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's press secretary, Robert Gore, said that comment on the governor's 
prospective higher pension would be premature because the salary increases are 
not final. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Van de Kamp said the attorney general was ill with the flu 
and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the Citizens Compensation Commission, George Nesterczuk, a 
Washington, D.C. management consultant, said that commissioners knew the salary 
recommendations would trigger pension increases, but did not know how much in 
individual cases. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Nesterczuk said, "If I were asked to take Mr. Deukmejian or Mr. 
Van de Kamp's pension into account at this point, it would seem punitive to 
reduce the increases we have agreed upon. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see that it is appropriate for us to be making a salary decision on 
the basis of its impact on pension benefits," Nesterczuk said. A friend of 
Deukmejian's executive secretary, Michael Frost, Nesterczuk was the only 
non-Californian on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman Claude S. Brinegar, a Union Oil vice president who was U.S. 
transportation secretary in the Richard M. Nixon Administration, agreed with 
Nesterczuk's remarks and added: "I would note that the statute called for us to 
make a decision effective Dec. 3. The only alternative would be to put it off 
for a year, and that would be certainly punitive to the new governor." 
</P>
<P>
The commission's tentative salary increase decisions last week came two days 
after it was revealed that state officials were instrumental in withholding a 
$17 monthly increase in benefits to 849,000 poor and disabled Californians 
because of state budgetary problems. 
</P>
<P>
On the same day the commission made its tentative decisions, Deukmejian 
proposed $1 billion in state budget cuts, including $546 million for schools, 
on grounds that the state could not afford the budget adopted earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Proposition 112 wanted to reduce the outside income legislators 
could receive, while setting up an independent commission to annually set their 
salaries commensurate with other states. 
</P>
<P>
Common Cause, the citizens' lobby group, campaigned heavily for the measure, 
and its Sacramento lobbyist, Ruth Holton, said she believes Proposition 112 was 
worthwhile even if big pension increases result. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be perfect, and unfortunately, yes, there are some problems," she 
said. "But setting the salaries this way is less of a conflict than when the 
Legislature did it."

LENSES RESTORE A PRICELESS HELPMATE; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: TELESCOPIC BIFOCALS WILL ALLOW A SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO SURGEON TO 
CONTINUE HIS 'MISSIONARY' WORK IN THE RAIN FORESTS OF MEXICO.

<P>
Since 1978, when he gave up his post-retirement gardening in San Juan 
Capistrano and became a part-time "missionary doctor" in the rain forests of 
southeast Mexico, Dr. Theodore Whittington had made do without many essentials 
of his trade. 
</P>
<P>
Sterile needles, local anesthetics, incubators, even scalpels -- all were in 
short supply as the Welsh-born surgeon sought to carry out what he calls "God's 
work" at an eight-bed, makeshift hospital. Still, he worked with what he had. 
Then, about four years ago, Whittington discovered that he was losing a tool he 
thought never could be replaced: his eyesight. 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, through the aid of the the Center for the Partially Sighted in 
Santa Monica and local contributions, the 67-year-old Whittington was fitted 
for a pair of $1,000 "surgical telescopes" and declared himself ready to return 
to the operating room. 
</P>
<P>
"They're amazing," Whittington said after testing out the lenses by picking up 
a needle from a table, then later reading -- practically singing, in fact -- 
from the tiny bottom line of a chart before him. "This means I can go back to 
doing surgery." 
</P>
<P>
After having spent an estimated $35,000 practicing medicine six months each 
year among the Mayan Indians in the rain forests, Whittington said he could not 
afford the pricey spectacles, which blend bifocals with a telescoping device 
that can magnify objects up to 10 times larger than they normally appear. But 
officials at the Center for the Partially Sighted, so impressed with his story, 
stepped in after hearing from Whittington earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"As we got deeper into what he had done down there, I said, 'We're going to get 
this man some help,' " recalls Dr. Wayne Hoeft, a professor at the Southern 
California College of Optometry in Fullerton and a nationally known specialist 
in low-vision rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
"When you hear about a guy dedicating his life like this to a cause, it's 
impressive," Hoeft added. And so, as a past district leader of the Kiwanis 
International, Hoeft called together several local Kiwanis groups -- from 
Hollywood, Glendale and La Canada Flintridge -- to help foot the bill for what 
is known technically as a "bioptic telescopic magnification device." 
</P>
<P>
The lenses aren't new. They've been around for 30 years, said Peter Murphy, 
co-owner of Designs for Vision Inc., a Long Island, N.Y., firm that makes them. 
The company sold 7,000 pairs last year, but the telescopic lenses aren't widely 
known. 
</P>
<P>
Whittington, for instance, had never heard of them until earlier this year when 
he caught a late-night public service announcement. For four years before that, 
as he gradually lost virtually all sight in his right eye and much in his left 
because of an aging disease called macular degeneration, he struggled with 
remedies that proved ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
He gave up surgery in the rain forest but still practiced medicine there for 
six months every year, searching all the while for a way to go back to the 
operating table. Then he found the Santa Monica center and Dr. Hoeft. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have here," said Samuel Genensky, founder of the Center for the 
Partially Sighted, "is a man who in any other circumstance would have been 
told, 'Friend, you're blind. You can't function anymore.' But he refused to 
accept that." 
</P>
<P>
How well will Whittington be able to see now? 
</P>
<P>
Hoeft, the low-vision specialist, said: "He won't be doing any heart surgeries, 
but boy, he can do a lot of things now that he couldn't before and can see 
sharp and clear at a distance of 13 inches," the distance needed to perform 
operations. "I wouldn't be surprised if he dies with a scalpel in his hand." 
</P>
<P>
Whittington himself says the improvement in vision is, in the context of the 
operating room, the ability to distinguish between human tissue and a suture. 
By the time he stopped performing operations, he couldn't do that, Whittington 
says. 
</P>
<P>
The realization that he was losing his sight four years ago was a grudging one, 
Whittington recalls. 
</P>
<P>
"You feel inadequate because your eyesight is failing. You feel that if you 
can't continue (as a surgeon), you're letting people down." 
</P>
<P>
In Whittington's case, the people he felt he was letting down were about 50,000 
Mayan Indians who live around the village of Yajalon, or "mountain of green" in 
local Mayan dialect, in southeast Mexico near the Guatemalan border. 
</P>
<P>
There, for almost the last dozen years, during the non-rainy season from 
roughly December through May, Whittington has volunteered his time to deliver 
babies, perform operations, give out shots, and treat broken bones, hiking each 
day up a steep hill to a mountain-top, government-run hospital. In recent 
years, while he has to put aside his operating duties because of his eyesight, 
he has spent $8,000 of his own savings to buy land in the village, opening an 
orphanage there and introducing new seeds for planting to the local growers, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
His wife stays behind in San Juan Capistrano for those six months. 
Occasionally, Whittington wishes he had, too. 
</P>
<P>
"You always have doubts," he concedes. "You either have to be dedicated or a 
little crazy to do what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
Restless after his retirement from private practice in Santa Ana, Whittington 
started his work among the Mayan Indians after being asked to take part in a 
church-sponsored study in the rain forest, aimed at building a new hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The project foundered, but Whittington ended up going back. 
</P>
<P>
The question that Whittington repeatedly confronts -- from former colleagues, 
from friends, from reporters -- is: Why? 
</P>
<P>
"The only way I can really answer that," he says, "is for them to come with me 
and then perhaps they will understand -- that there is more in life than making 
money, more noble things. There is an expression in French that mean 'those who 
are gifted are obliged to help those who are not,' and that is my place. 
</P>
<P>
"If they came, they would see the daily hardships, the suffering, the poverty 
of my people. There are no tomorrows in these people's lives -- no hay manana,' 
" he says. "And this is the saddest part."

VANDALS LEAVE SIGNS OF RACE HATRED; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: A BLACK FAMILY FEELS THE FULL IMPACT OF BIGOTRY, AND THEIR HOME IS 
HEAVILY DAMAGED.

<P>
At the crest of a softly rolling South County hill, the wide street of big 
homes set off by rosebushes and plum trees hardly seems the setting for a hate 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
But six days ago, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Department, bigotry 
accompanied by a particularly vicious brand of vandalism visited a black family 
on Barents Street, leaving behind tens of thousands of dollars worth of 
destruction and spray-painted racial slurs, an act that has outraged and 
alarmed the Orange County Human Relations Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no place in the county any more that is immune to it," said 
Commission Chairman Rusty Kennedy, who has scheduled a news conference for this 
morning with religious and community leaders and representatives of the 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We are coming together to join hands to say this county does not tolerate this 
kind of bigotry," Kennedy said. "It's sort of a reach-out to the family. 
There's a victim here; there's a family feeling isolated." 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no firm count of hate crimes in Orange County -- money 
earmarked to monitor such crimes was axed from the budget last year by the 
governor -- some officials fear that this particular kind of violence is on the 
rise. They cite the vandalism earlier this month committed in the home of a 
gay-rights activist in Anaheim, and the attack in August on high school 
cheerleader Amber Jefferson, whose mother is white and father is black. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday evening, Delano De Silva and his wife, Laverne, led an insurance 
adjuster through their two-story, $370,000 home to assess the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Across their newly re-upholstered ivory brocade couch, across the cathedral 
ceilings, across a mirror in the living room, the same racial slur is 
spray-painted in black. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood, says the 42-year-old father of three teen-age sons, has been 
in shock since the vandals went on a rampage inside his home last Wednesday 
afternoon. Law enforcement officials say the break-in on Barents Street is the 
first such serious hate crime that they can recall in South County. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been violated like this," De Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
De Silva, who works as an insurance underwriter in Irvine, was born in Panama, 
one of eight children of a Panamanian boat builder. He joined the U.S. Air 
Force in his early 20s, later became a U. S. citizen and went to college on his 
GI benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we had already dealt with things like this," said De Silva, who 
speaks with a faint Spanish accent. He said he has told his children that, 
"this is a part of growing up, this is a part of the real world. . . . You 
can't hate. There are things you are just going to have to walk away from." 
</P>
<P>
It was 14-year-old Duvahn De Silva -- a Laguna Hills High School freshman who 
plays trumpet in the band -- who discovered the break-in after walking home 
from school. The vandals hadn't stopped at graffiti: every faucet in the house 
had been turned on and the sinks blocked, flooding the house. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the wall-to-wall carpeting has been been heavily damaged and sits in 
warped rolls; the dining room ceiling is cracked and falls in chunks onto the 
floor. A chandelier sits on an antique oak table, among several family mementos 
that were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most serious losses for Duvahn were his Nintendo video games and his 
Air Jordan sneakers. Both were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"We are definitely looking at this as a hate crime," said Sheriff's Lt. Robert 
Rivas, who said investigators worked through the weekend but have no suspects. 
Under a 3-year-old state law, so-called hate crimes, that is, crimes sparked by 
bigotry, are automatically prosecuted as felonies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first one we've dealt with down south that I know of. . . . It will 
not be tolerated," Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
De Silva said he will send news accounts of the break-in to his oldest son, 
19-year-old Jason, who is serving in the Marine Corps in Atlanta. He worries 
that Jason is not "conscious enough of security." 
</P>
<P>
"I want him to know things like this can happen." De Silva said. "Then I want 
to get on with my life."

KILLED GIRL, 9, TO ESCAPE ARREST, SUSPECT SAYS;

OVER FOR TRIAL.

An Anaheim woman said she robbed a friend's house of $300 worth of household 
items to buy drugs and then, to keep from being caught, killed a 9-year-old 
girl who was alone there, according to transcripts of a police interview made 
public Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Maria del Rosio (Rosie) Alfaro, 19, who was bound over for trial Monday by a 
Municipal Court judge, told investigators she had already taken drugs twice 
that day, but needed money for more. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really wired, really coked out and stuff," she told them. 
</P>
<P>
Alfaro could face at least a life sentence without parole if convicted in the 
June 15 stabbing death of Autumn Wallace of Anaheim. The girl, an A student at 
Jonas E. Salk Elementary School, had been waiting for her mother and sister to 
come home from work on the afternoon of her death. 
</P>
<P>
Alfaro, an acquaintance of the girl's sister April, said she had two men drive 
her to the house because she knew Autumn would be home alone at that hour. The 
two men kept Alfaro's infant son in the car with them while she went inside. 
</P>
<P>
Alfaro has been the only one arrested, but the investigation is ongoing. Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Bernadette Cemore said there is corroborating evidence that it was 
Alfaro who stabbed the young girl. 
</P>
<P>
But still unresolved is the role of the two men who participated in the 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
In her police interview on June 27, nearly two weeks after the crime, 
investigators from the Orange County Sheriff's Department asked her whether the 
two men participated in the robbery. If they had, they could face first-degree 
murder charges, the same as Alfaro. Her statements were inconsistent as to the 
extent of their participation, but Alfaro said they knew she was going to 
Autumn's home to commit a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Alfaro's attorney, William M. Monroe, said his client is either protecting the 
actual killer or was too high on drugs to know what she was doing. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rosie Alfaro I've gotten to know the last few months isn't the kind of 
person who could do this," Monroe said. 
</P>
<P>
The transcripts show that Alfaro, who was 18 when the murder occurred, said she 
first got the idea for killing the girl when she happened to see a knife in the 
laundry room. But she later admitted that she had taken the knife from a 
kitchen drawer. She said she went into the bathroom and thought for about a 
minute about the killing before she did it. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators questioned her repeatedly about her motive: 
</P>
<P>
"Rosie . . . do you believe in God? I want you to tell me the truth. Why did 
you pick up the knife?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, something just got into me and I thought of doing that. I don't 
know," she replied, according to the transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
Alfaro said she knocked on the door and asked the girl if she could use the 
bathroom as a pretense for getting inside the house. After she got the knife, 
she said, she lured the girl to the bathroom by asking Autumn if she would 
clean some eyelash-curler tools. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, an investigator told her: "Don't try and convince me that you 
were out of your head." 
</P>
<P>
"No, I wasn't out of my head," she answered. 
</P>
<P>
Alfaro said she and the two men stole a VCR, a mirror, a clock radio, an iron, 
some boots, a video game set, a small television and some clothes. She started 
to take a microwave, she said, but it was too heavy. 
</P>
<P>
Alfaro said she sold the items for about $300 later that day. She said she 
spent about $30 of it for drugs and her boyfriend took the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"So what did you end up getting out of it?" one of the investigators asked her. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing," Alfaro replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Autumn knew who you were and the only way you could rip off and get away with 
it was kill Autumn, is that right?" an investigator asked her. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," she answered, " . . . cause she knew who I was." 
</P>
<P>
Alfaro described for investigators a life of living in one seedy motel after 
another with a boyfriend. She was addicted to both heroin and cocaine, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Alfaro also told officers that she knew only one of the two men with her, and 
him only by the nickname of "Shorty."

LONG-AWAITED RAINFALL BRINGS FREEWAY HAVOC; 
</P>
<P>
WEATHER: SOME PORTIONS OF THE COUNTY ARE DRENCHED, BUT FORECASTERS DOUBT IT 
WILL MAKE A DENT ON THE FOUR-YEAR DROUGHT.

<P>
Rain, a rare sight the past four years, poured down Monday night on parched 
Orange County, causing havoc on the freeways as motorists tried to remember how 
to drive on on slick roads. 
</P>
<P>
At least 30 "fender-benders" were reported on county freeways late Monday, 
California Highway Patrol officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The roads are really slick because the rain lifts the oil from the surface," 
said a CHP dispatcher. "There's been a lot of accidents. People aren't used to 
driving in the rain. It's been so long." 
</P>
<P>
Scattered power failures were reported in Garden Grove and Stanton, a Southern 
California Edison spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night's downpour was the first measurable precipitation since Aug. 5 and 
the most significant rain in the Southland since May 28. 
</P>
<P>
Although the compact but powerful storm system, which arrived from the Pacific 
Ocean during the afternoon, dampened the Southland, it was not expected to be 
the "drought buster" the county needs, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
The storm should leave the county early today and give way to cooler, clear 
skies and gusty winds by mid-morning, according to Marty McKewon, a 
meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
As much as half an inch of rain could fall in some mountain and coastal areas, 
McKewon said. No precipitation figures were available late Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a real big storm system . . . but it does have a pretty good punch," 
McKewon said. 
</P>
<P>
"The system looks like it's got quite a bit of moisture. But I don't think a 
widespread range, from Santa Barbara to San Diego, is going to get rain. 
Unfortunately, some locations will get very little, if any," McKewon said. 
</P>
<P>
By Thanksgiving, the temperatures throughout Orange County should warm up to a 
pleasant 70 degrees, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
The high temperature in the county Monday was a mild 65 degrees in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The foreboding weather Monday, which included gusting winds over the Mojave 
Desert, forced the space shuttle Atlantis to delay landing. The swirling winds 
are not expected to let up today, McKewon said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, before the downpour, anticipation ran high. People pulled out 
their umbrellas and slickers, brought in their dogs and cats and cast watchful 
glances from office windows before stepping outside. 
</P>
<P>
"All the media and every John Doe is calling in, wanting to know if it is 
really going to rain, what are the chances of rain, how much rain are we going 
to get, when is it going to rain," said meteorologist Jerry McDuffie of the 
National Weather Service in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't rained in so long, and it's just something people in California do 
out here, period." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Orange County has received only several hundredths of an inch of rain 
for the season, which started July 1. The average precipitation at this point 
of the season is 1.59 inches. 
</P>
<P>
For the last four years, Southern California has been suffering a drought, with 
rainfall levels far below normal. The average amount of precipitation recorded 
by the end of October is 11.03 inches; this year, a mere 6.30 inches has been 
measured in the same period, McDuffie said.

'THE BIG GUY' RETIRES AFTER RECORD SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Mayor Don E. Smith moved to Orange in 1950, the bedroom community of 
10,000 still boasted fragrant orange groves and a farm town atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Advertised as "exciting, sun-filled suburbia" and now crossed by five freeways, 
the central Orange County city over the years has attracted commercial centers, 
manufacturing plants and become home to nearly 110,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Smith has watched it all. 
</P>
<P>
Today, "the big guy," as he is called by City Hall insiders, retires after 
nearly 25 years on the City Council, a tenure that makes him the 
longest-serving-elected official in Orange County. And when Smith leaves the 
council chambers, many believe that a little of Old Orange goes with him. 
</P>
<P>
"He never lost (the ideal) that he represented the people, and he kept thinking 
of Orange as that rural city with a traffic circle," said 4th District 
Supervisor Don R. Roth, who first met Smith while serving on the Anaheim City 
Council in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Smith is credited by many with spearheading a movement to preserve the 
downtown traffic circle and plaza that symbolize Orange's small-town history. 
</P>
<P>
"What you see in the preservation of the old part of town has to do with his 
drive and his enthusiasm," said David Hart, an Orange native who served 19 
years on the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Old Towne isn't the only place on which Smith leaves his mark. It was also 
Smith who persuaded state leaders to name the Orange Freeway after the city and 
who promoted the addition of the Taft and El Modena library branches. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was even honored by the County Board of Supervisors, who designated Nov. 
16 as Don E. Smith Day in recognition of his service on countywide agencies 
addressing such issues as sanitation, solid waste and traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was elected to the City Council in 1966, a fiscal and political 
conservative on a board that was considered liberal for the city. Imposing at 
6-foot-5, Smith earned an early reputation for being a stubborn "bulldog" who 
rarely would let an issue slip away. In his early years on the council, his was 
often a lone voice of dissent. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his willingness to take unpopular positions, Smith handily won seven 
consecutive elections, and served two other terms as mayor from 1968 to 1972. 
Smith believes that his forthright manner earned him a loyal constituency. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and his wife, Gladie, raised five children in the city while his 
successful real estate business made him a millionaire. He announced that he 
would not run for reelection during his recuperation from surgery last June to 
remove blood clots from the arteries leading to his lungs. 
</P>
<P>
Smith says he will retire to spend time with his family and travel. 
</P>
<P>
Colleagues say Smith's political contacts and savvy will be missed, but few 
expect him to disappear completely from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that he will miss "being where the action is" but added that if it 
doesn't "cause any political problems," he would continue some involvement with 
city matters. MARY HELEN BERG

With all absentee votes tallied, write-in candidate Wally Linn fell short in 
his bid for City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents Larry A. Herman and Orbrey Duke were able to fend off Linn, who 
received only 571 votes. Linn, a real estate broker, finished fifth behind 
challengers Christian Basquette and Kenneth Tipton. The candidates were 
competing for two four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
Herman and Duke, who were ahead after the original counts, maintained their 
strong leads. In the final tally, Duke received 2,276 votes and Herman received 
2,134. 
</P>
<P>
Linn entered the race on the last possible day and campaigned hard in the weeks 
before the election. However, because he was a write-in candidate, his name did 
not appear on the ballot. LYNDA NATALI

FORECAST FOR WEATHER CLASS SUNNY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After peering at thermometers, a barometer and a wind gauge one recent morning, 
Viejo Elementary School sixth-grader Sarah Connor looked into the sky. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are low clouds," the 11-year-old said. "Maybe they're high clouds. I 
think it's going to be sunny the rest of the day." 
</P>
<P>
She then went into Principal Richard Campbell's office, called local radio 
station KSBR-FM and, with barely a stammer, taped the noon weather report. She 
even tossed in a daily weather fact: In 1939, an English rainstorm swept up 
frogs from local ponds and dropped them on the town of Trowbridge. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. George Fischbeck hardly could have done better. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah is one of 20 Viejo sixth-graders who, as members of the school's Junior 
Meteorologists Club, have been taking turns the past three weeks giving KSBR's 
weekday weather reports using the school's newly purchased weather station. It 
cost $6,270 and was purchased with a grant from California Education 
Initiatives, a coalition of 10 California corporations that funds education 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing the kids like about this is that it is not conceptual; it's not just 
reading about science in a dry school book," said teacher David Dunbeck, the 
project's adviser. "It's hands-on, real-life science. The added fact that they 
get to be on the radio magnifies their excitement." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said the idea for building the weather station, which is in a corner 
of the school's playground, came last year. He said it will be used to teach 
all of the school's students about meteorology. 
</P>
<P>
"Every classroom will be getting two weeks of weather instruction," Campbell 
said. "They will be learning all aspects of meteorology -- where rain comes 
from, what causes the wind, how fronts develop, air pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the kindergartners will receive instruction, at their level," he said. 
"Maybe they wouldn't be able to understand air pressure, but they can learn 
what causes it to rain." 
</P>
<P>
He said meteorology instruction will begin in January, after the teachers 
attend a workshop. 
</P>
<P>
Other students will then be allowed to give the weather reports, with the help 
of a Junior Meteorologist. 
</P>
<P>
Dunbeck said that while the students are learning meteorology, they will also 
be learning other subjects as well. 
</P>
<P>
"In math, they can learn charts and graphs and percentages," he said. "They 
will be reading and writing reports and stories about the weather. For social 
studies, they will learn about historical events that were affected by the 
weather. Even in art, a teacher could bring in pictures that utilize weather. 
</P>
<P>
"Using the weather is going to heighten their interest in a lot of areas," he 
said. "In sales, they would call this a great hook."TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;

TRAFFIC STALLED BY KNOTT'S FIREWORKS

<P>
A massive fireworks show Sunday night at Knott's Berry Farm brought traffic to 
a standstill as fire officials cordoned off streets near the park to allow for 
a fireworks "fallout" zone, officials told the City Council on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The more than 2,000 pyrotechnics also prompted more than 50 calls from 
residents who thought there had been an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
But both fire and police officials said there was no danger to residents. 
</P>
<P>
"From our perspective, it went very well," Fire Chief Sam Winner said. The 
"fallout," which included burned fireworks and paper scraps, landed in a vacant 
lot near the park, he said. 
</P>
<P>
During the 18-minute show, drivers were not allowed along portions of La Palma 
and Western avenues. 
</P>
<P>
"We restricted the area for safety purposes," Winner said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight off-duty fire fighters were hired by the radio station that sponsored the 
show. Two on-duty fire officials were also on hand to oversee the actual 
discharge of the fireworks. It was the largest fireworks show ever to be held 
at the park, Winner said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Richard Tefank said 22 police officers working overtime helped 
control traffic and crowds within the park. Knott's has agreed to pay the 
$2,600 for the officers' overtime, Tefank said.LYNDA NATALI

PEOPLE: TO HIM, COLLECTING OLD MINIATURE KITS IS A MODEL HOBBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Keller started collecting model kits in 1974, figuring that after he 
retired he would spend his time piecing together the miniature cars, airplanes 
and ships. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong! 
</P>
<P>
He has amassed 4,000 of the kits, but they have become so valuable as 
collectors' items that Keller dares not open them. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be throwing away money," says Keller, 45, who runs a kennel in 
Stanton. "Right now an original kit issued in 1960 runs from $15 to $50." When 
they were new, most such kits cost $1. 
</P>
<P>
"In those days kids were into model-building," he said. "It was something you 
did at home where it was quiet and you could research everything you built." 
Keller knows. He was one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Keller says, "kids into building kit models are looked on as antisocial 
by their peers," and model-building is thought of as a hobby for nerds. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for that, he says, is probably the fast tempo of life for 
children today. "It takes time, and the quick gratification isn't there," he 
says of model-building. "Kids can get that quick gratification by putting a 
quarter in a video game and setting a new score." 
</P>
<P>
Keller's current challenge is finding kits -- out of production and unopened -- 
for his collection. 
</P>
<P>
"I sometimes can find kits from people who had them stored away, but most of 
what I collect comes from trading with other collectors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keller stages model-kit swap meets three times a year in Buena Park. The 
gatherings have been held since 1984, and they draw a good crowd from the 
estimated 5,000 kit collectors in the United States, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Keller said he started collecting after leaving General Dynamics, where he 
worked for 10 years along with his mother and father. His last position there 
was as a data processing programmer. 
</P>
<P>
"I though it would be nice to build from kits the things the company made, such 
as missiles, aircraft and submarines," he said. Keller wisely bought two of 
each model -- one to build and one to save. 
</P>
<P>
Three of his most prized kits, however, contain the makings for car chassis 
made of clear plastic. Kits such as these were once used as high school 
instructional aids in the early 1960s. Keller put their value at $400 each. 
</P>
<P>
Keller did own a hobby shop for a time, but it never became profitable. "I 
spent most of my time making models because I didn't have that many customers. 
But I did have the best display." 
</P>
<P>
Keller also tried making and marketing a kit model of his own -- of an airplane 
built in the early '30s. 
</P>
<P>
Keller believes that the companies producing kits nowadays are not nearly as 
creative as those of the past. "There isn't much variety in the type of models 
being built today," he says. 
</P>
<P>
So far, there are two name plaques on the old-fashioned oak cradle that Ron 
Kautz built for his grandchildren, but there's plenty of room for more. 
</P>
<P>
"I built it with the idea that we would pass it on to our daughters to use as 
they gave birth," said Kautz of Santa Ana, who has three daughters. A third 
grandchild is due in March. 
</P>
<P>
Between babies, wife Bernadine will put an antique doll in it and keep it in 
their bedroom.

TWICE-VICTIMIZED WOMAN TESTIFIES AT RAPE TRIAL;

<P>
She had just bought a huge, live lobster, and she had fun showing it to a good 
friend who lived near her in a Fountain Valley apartment complex. She had just 
returned to her own apartment and put water on to boil the lobster when she 
heard a noise. 
</P>
<P>
A man was in her living room. It was the same man who had raped her 14 months 
before. He raped her again, then taunted her about the earlier rape. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember when I was here before, when I had to wait until your boyfriend 
left?" he asked her. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors at Robin Scott Dasenbrock's serial rape trial sat transfixed Monday as 
the woman, in her mid-30s, described the two assaults. 
</P>
<P>
"I was terrified," she said softly. "I couldn't believe that it happened twice 
in my life. I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
The woman was one of four victims who have testified so far at Dasenbrock's 
trial on 44 sex-related charges involving 16 victims. One is a man whose home 
was burglarized, and several others are women who were not home. But the rest 
were either raped or assaulted or managed to scare off their assailant, who 
attacked them in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
Dasenbrock, 25, of Fountain Valley has admitted to committing many of the 
assaults and burglaries but denies that he is responsible for all of them. One 
attack he has not admitted to is the rape of the woman who testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
She, however, has identified him twice in court, and during a police lineup, 
she picked him out of six men and wrote on a card: "No doubt about it!" 
</P>
<P>
The woman told jurors that she had not seen the rapist the first time she was 
attacked, in November, 1985, but that when he returned in January, 1987, she 
knew his voice and his build, and he told her he was the one who had raped her 
before. 
</P>
<P>
She was hysterical afterward, she said. She could barely make it up the stairs 
to knock on her friends' door. They urged her to call the police, but she 
wouldn't do it. 
</P>
<P>
"He said that he lived in the area and that if I called the police, he would 
return and kill me and my daughter," she said. "I believed him." 
</P>
<P>
But the police called her; they had found her purse, which the rapist had 
stolen. Through that contact, she eventually told police what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
Her testimony left people in the court audience shaking their heads in 
sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
In both rapes, the woman said, she had searched for some kind of understanding 
about what had happened. The first time, she said, she had tried to stop the 
rapist as he was leaving. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'Wait, don't go; we can talk about this,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman said that since then she had followed in the newspapers the series of 
rapes in Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley apartments, which were all 
attributed to the same man. During the second assault, she said, she asked the 
rapist: "Why are you doing this to us?" 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Koski asked her if the second rape was more 
terrifying than the first. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, she said, because the rapist only threatened her the first time. In the 
second incident, she could see his knife, and he put it point-first to her head 
as he forced her head into a pillow. 
</P>
<P>
During the second rape, she testified, her mind was not on what was happening 
to her but rather on her daughter, who was at a gymnastics class. She was 
thankful that her daughter wasn't there and at risk of being hurt, she said. 
</P>
<P>
When the rapist left, she testified, "I was just thankful I was still alive." 
</P>
<P>
The woman said she moved out of the apartment, where both rapes had occurred, 
within a week of the second assault. 
</P>
<P>
Dasenbrock listened to the testimony with his left hand to the side of his 
face, to avoid a news camera. He also sniffed loudly throughout the woman's 
testimony, which his attorney, James S. Odriozola, said was because of a sinus 
condition.

IF SLIDE CONTINUES, CHANGE IS EXPECTED; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: TEAM EXECUTIVE SHAW SAYS IT'S TOO EARLY TO TALK ABOUT ROBINSON'S FUTURE, 
BUT HE OFFERS NO VOTE OF CONFIDENCE.

<P>
Although acknowledging that management is deeply disappointed with the Rams' 
3-7 record, Executive Vice President John Shaw said Monday that it was "far too 
premature" to start drawing conclusions about Coach John Robinson's future with 
the club. 
</P>
<P>
But Shaw also suggested that if the team does not show improvement over the 
final six weeks of the season, management would take some major actions. And he 
did not rule out the possibility of replacing Robinson, who has coached the 
Rams since 1983 and has, until now, enjoyed remarkable job security. 
</P>
<P>
"We really haven't addressed the issues as to what changes we'd make," Shaw 
said. "All I can tell you is that if the team isn't turned around, there are 
sure to be a lot of changes. 
</P>
<P>
"But as far as speculating about the head coach, it's far too premature because 
right now there have been no indications about making that change." 
</P>
<P>
When pressed on the matter -- asked directly if Robinson is likely to be the 
Rams' coach in 1991 -- Shaw wouldn't go much further than saying that the whole 
organization will be "reviewed and examined" at the end of the season, as is 
normal team practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I would really have no comment to that," Shaw said in response to the 1991 
question. "We're going to look at all our options at the end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
But by not giving Robinson a vote of confidence, Shaw was asked, isn't he 
opening the door to rampant speculation about Robinson's status? 
</P>
<P>
"I think you're reading more into the speculation than actually exists," Shaw 
said. "I don't believe the organization will make any decision until after the 
season. It's obviously an ownership decision. The situation will be examined at 
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"But if things don't turn around, I would think that the organization would 
make every effort to make those decisions that would turn us back into a 
winning organization." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Robinson said that he knows his job might depend on what happens 
in the final six weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
After falling one game short of the Super Bowl last season and an off-season of 
high expectations, Robinson said talk about his job is natural. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he prefers to concentrate on his team's status, not his own. "My 
own particular job security or future isn't as important to me now as being 
able to find a way to get this football team playing," he said. "That's 
important to me. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to be cavalier about my job or any of that, but I've been 
coaching a long time, and I think I've coached well. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm suddenly in a position where my team is not doing well. And I want to 
try to change that." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who has had only one losing season, the strike-torn 1987 season, in 
his seven full seasons with the Rams, and who fielded a consistent winner in 
seven years at USC, said winning is a matter of individual and team pride. 
</P>
<P>
"You're willing to leave the job, or go on to the next job -- we're all going 
to have different jobs in our lives -- that's not the key issue," Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The key issue is we're a group of people who, going into this year, had the 
fifth-most wins in this league over the last seven years, had the second-most 
playoff appearances in this league, a club that had won 13 games last year, 
suddenly now we've gotten ourselves in a lot of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we would like to get back to being able to believe in ourselves the 
way we have in the past. That's what the issue is." 
</P>
<P>
Particularly in Sunday's 24-21 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, but also throughout 
this dismal season, Robinson said that he is troubled by his team's inability 
to play with passion. 
</P>
<P>
And he said he will begin putting younger players such as safety Pat Terrell 
and offensive lineman Bern Brostek into the game more, just to see what 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a point there where you're getting shoved off the end of the cliff 
and you better damn sure do something about it," Robinson said. "You better go 
off fighting. And I'm not sure that I believe we're doing that. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working and we're trying and we're improving on the practice field . . . 
but I just don't see the kind of fight where we should be absolutely panicked 
in our fight for survival. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the key to any semblance of recovery for the rest of this year. . . . 
Right now that's the area I find repulsive about us. We're not able to let go 
of whatever rage or whatever fight there is in us at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has been trying all season to keep his team's hope alive, to encourage 
the players and expect them to return to form. 
</P>
<P>
Now, though, with a game against the San Francisco 49ers (10-0) looming Sunday, 
Robinson just seems frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a season like this," Robinson said. "Disappointing . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not used to losing. I've won the 15 years I've been coaching. And I've 
also had competitive teams. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I've felt, always when it came down to crucial moments in games or crucial 
plays, our guys gave it their best at that point. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a passivity, and just seemingly allowing this to happen and not being 
concerned and perplexed and not striking out at whatever, at the gods of 
football or something for the position that we're in." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

<P>
EMMITT SMITH 
</P>
<P>
No one had to educate the Rams on the rushing reputation of the Cowboys' Emmitt 
Smith. He had lit up Southeastern Conference member score-boards for three 
years while at Florida. The Ram defense keyed on Smith and held him to but 54 
yards on 21 carries. But, the same can't be said when the Cowboys used the 
5-foot-9 speedster as a receiver. He broke the Rams' back on the four passes 
thrown him, averaging 29.25 yards per reception. In the second quarter, he took 
a short one from quarterback Troy Aikman and was at his elusive best as he 
raced 57 yards to set up Dallas' tying touchdown. Then, in the fourth quarter 
with the score tied at 21, he took another short pass from Aikman and turned it 
into a 44-yard gain to put the Cowboys in winning field-goal range.

RABBITT PLACES 4TH AT NCAA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine's Buffy Rabbitt finished fourth in the NCAA women's cross-country 
championships Monday, leading the team to fourth place, the best finish in the 
program's history. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbitt was 25 seconds behind the winner, Villanova's Sonia O'Sullivan, whose 
time of 16 minutes 6 seconds on the 5,000-meter course sparked her team to the 
NCAA title at Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Villanova scored 82 points, defeating second-place Providence by 90 points. 
Clemson was third, and Irvine was fourth, six points out of third and 11 points 
ahead of fifth-place Oregon, which had defeated Irvine by one point in an NCAA 
regional championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Finishing fourth is a great effort for our team," said Irvine Coach Vince 
O'Boyle. "It's especially pleasing to be the top team from the West Coast. 
Those were three great teams that finished ahead of us." 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas won the men's team title, scoring 68.2 points to defeat second-place 
Iowa State by 28.1 points. Notre Dame was third, Texas was fourth and Oregon 
was fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa State's Jonah Koech won the individual title, running the men's 
10,000-meter course in 29:05. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's race, Wisconsin's Suzy Favor was second, 12 seconds behind 
O'Sullivan, and Missouri's Susan Bliss was third, a tenth of a second ahead of 
Rabbitt. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Akraka, a Swedish half-miler in her first season running for Irvine, was 
the Anteaters' second runner, taking 18th with a time of 16:52. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's Rayna Cervantes finished 24th. Traci Goodrich, who has beaten 
Cervantes in two meets this season and often runs close to her time, finished 
96th. The final runner to score for Irvine was Roberta Moronez, who was 136th. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's Sita Jones was 138th, and teammate Jade Preato was 139th. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters' best finish at the NCAA championships before Monday was eighth, 
in 1987. Irvine was 10th last year.

PARTNERS SAY BIG ACCOUNTING FIRM MAY FOLD; 
</P>
<P>
SERVICES: LAVENTHOL &amp; HORWATH HAS BEEN HURT BY THE POOR ECONOMY AND 
MALPRACTICE SUITS. SOME OF ITS OFFICES MAY BECOME INDEPENDENT; SOME MAY 
AFFILIATE WITH OTHER FIRMS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Laventhol &amp; Horwath, the nation's seventh-largest accounting firm, may be 
dissolved or put into bankruptcy, with some of its offices -- including its 
Orange County operation -- forming independent partnerships or affiliating with 
other firms, partners said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, whose legal and financial troubles have mounted in recent months, 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
But its 350 or so partners met over the weekend in Houston to decide the 
Philadelphia firm's fate. Options reportedly included dissolution, filing for 
bankruptcy court protection from creditors and shrinking the firm to a few core 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is they're taking whatever actions are necessary to dissolve 
the firm," said Richard Pimentel, partner in charge of the San Francisco 
office, who attended the Houston meeting. No date for the dissolution was 
given, but a clear message was sent "to go about our lives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other partners and former partners reached Monday echoed Pimentel. Orange 
County Managing Partner Richard Carpe said he expects the company to file a 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition by month's end. He doesn't expect it to survive 
as a national firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Hmm. I have no information on that," spokesman Thomas Derr said when asked if 
the firm is shutting down. 
</P>
<P>
The company released a brief statement by Chief Executive Robert N. Levine, 
saying that partners had discussed "a number of scenarios regarding both the 
short-term and long-term future of Laventhol &amp; Horwath." 
</P>
<P>
"At this time, we cannot comment on any of the business plans discussed at the 
meeting," the statement said. "The partners and staff remain dedicated to 
providing the highest quality of professional service to their clients." 
</P>
<P>
In an angry statement issued last week, the company acknowledged that "of 
course, L&amp;H has problems. Every single accounting firm in the nation has 
severe problems -- many caused by the 'sue the accountants; they have deep 
pockets' mentality so prevalent today. The soft economy has also hurt the 
profession, L&amp;H and hundreds of other companies worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
Laventhol &amp; Horwath, with 50 offices and 3,400 employees, has been hit hard 
by litigation. The suits, including a multimillion-dollar one arising from the 
company's audit of imprisoned evangelist Jim Bakker's PTL ministry, have 
alleged poor accounting and consulting work. 
</P>
<P>
The company has been laying off employees. In October, it cut wages for those 
that remained by 10% -- a reduction that it said would last only three months. 
</P>
<P>
In was unclear Monday if pension plans for employees are secure. Some partners 
said basic pensions are fully insured but that an added amount for partners 
will be lost. One former partner said pensions were being funded by current and 
future earnings.

The 40-employee Orange County office of Laventhol &amp; Horwath in Costa Mesa 
will become independent and will be renamed Carpe, Wachs, Kipper &amp; Davis, 
after the four partners, Carpe said. Besides Carpe, 42, who will be president 
and chief executive, the other partners are Brian Wachs, 39, Richard Kipper, 
48, and Charles Davis, 38. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our intention to liberate the local office from the national firm and 
take whatever steps were necessary to see it happen as quickly as possible," 
Carpe said. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 of the 50 offices nationwide probably will become independent 
practices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carpe said business is growing at the Costa Mesa office, with projected 
earnings of $4.5 million for the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, up from $4 million 
in earnings for the previous year. The office employs 34 accountants, many of 
whom have expressed a commitment to stay, Carpe said. 
</P>
<P>
"The local market has enabled our audit practice to grow 30% in the current 
year despite the bad publicity" about the litigation embroiling other Laventhol 
&amp; Horwath offices, he said. "We have no lawsuits of any kind and have been 
sitting here building a practice." 
</P>
<P>
Carpe said he anticipates that the new accounting firm will retain the bulk of 
its clients. He said while the office has a general accounting business base, 
it is "big in real estate and leisure time, including hotels and restaurants, 
and very big in health care." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the Century City office will reorganize into three firms 
serving the entertainment industry, said partner George Savitsky. They will be 
Savitsky, Satin &amp; Geibelson, an entertainment business management 
corporation; Satin &amp; Lever, a music industry accounting firm, and Sills 
&amp; Adelmann, a film and television accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is "90% certain" that the mid-Wilshire office in Los Angeles, which 
did accounting and consulting work for various industries, will fold. On 
Monday, only an answering machine greeted calls to the mid-Wilshire office. 
</P>
<P>
Pimentel said the 70-employee San Francisco office will continue to operate, 
perhaps by affiliating with another accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the San Diego offices could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Laventhol &amp; Horwath specializes in audit and consulting work for the hotel, 
entertainment, real estate and health-care industries. The company had about 
$350 million in revenue last year.

FINDING WHAT'S IN A USER-FRIENDLY NAME; 
</P>
<P>
TITLES: COMPANIES WITH AN IDENTITY CRISIS CAN CALL ON CONSULTANTS TO MATCH 
BUSINESS STRATEGY WITH A MARKETABLE LABEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

When computer scientists Gary Knott and Barry Bunow started their own software 
company on a shoestring, a big advertising budget was out of the question. 
That's why the pair from Bethesda, Md., picked a name that expressed what they 
invent: Civilized Software. 
</P>
<P>
"You should be as descriptive as you can about what you really produce," 
advised Knott, chief executive officer. The company, which does mathematical 
modeling for academics and research scientists, prides itself on software 
that's more than user-friendly and wanted to convey that in the name. 
</P>
<P>
"User-friendly doesn't capture the idea of civility," said Knott, who went into 
business for himself after retiring from the U.S. Public Health Service. "We 
produce software that is not condescending or obscure, software at which people 
don't become annoyed." 
</P>
<P>
With just $30,000 in sales in the 2 1/2 months since its product went to 
market, Civilized Software is too poor to launch a big marketing drive. But 
experts say the company took the right approach by selecting a name that was 
relatively simple and descriptive rather than arcane or technical. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest mistake high-tech companies make is that they talk to themselves 
and not to their customers. They look inward rather than outward," said S.B. 
Master, the president of Master-McNeil Inc., a San Francisco company that helps 
technology companies name themselves and their products. Too often, Master 
says, such companies select overly technical names that can intimidate rather 
than attract would-be customers. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of names is to communicate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It's a rare company that can get away with an obscure name, say identity 
consultants, who are paid to assist in the naming process. In particular, use 
of founders' own names, which rarely have meaning to the public, offer little 
to a new company, they say. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to overestimate the importance of a company's identity, says Joel 
Portugal, a partner in Anspach Grossman Portugal Inc., a New York-based firm 
that helps businesses select names, logos and other identifiers. 
</P>
<P>
Before seeking a specific name, Portugal says, a client is asked how the name 
will fit with the client's business strategy. American Express, for example, 
wanted to create a credit card distinct from its traditional card. It also 
wanted the name to convey that the card would allow a user to maximize personal 
finance options. "Optima" was derived from optimize and maximize. 
</P>
<P>
Anspach Grossman Portugal uses its own software to process the answers to key 
questions about naming criteria. Working with the criteria, the computer offers 
numerous words related to the client's objective. "Navistar," for instance, was 
a computer-generated name related to the former International Harvester's 
objective that the name relate to navigation and direction. 
</P>
<P>
But identity consultants caution that a computer program isn't the be-all and 
end-all in the naming process. Even when a computer is used, it is usually a 
person who refines the rough suggestions into proposed names. Then the names 
are often placed before a focus group to determine how they will sound to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
"What's a stupid name today usually in three to five years from now isn't 
stupid," Portugal said. Both "Exxon" and "Xerox" sounded silly to the public 
when first presented, he said. But the idea is not to solicit emotional 
reactions from a focus group. Rather, it is to present the group with a list of 
criteria and have members select the names that best fit the criteria. 
</P>
<P>
A fabricated name is often best for a company with widespread operations. 
That's because a name must clear a rigorous search to be sure it's legally 
available in all states and countries where a business intends to operate or 
sell its products. And the proliferation of global products has made name 
competition all the keener. 
</P>
<P>
"Trademark lawyers earn their money -- it's a very tedious process," Portugal 
said. It's far better to go through this often lengthy process beforehand 
rather than be faced with a lawsuit or the need to change a name later, 
identity consultants say. 
</P>
<P>
Another vital step involves clearing the name in foreign languages. A name may 
sound fine in English, yet have a negative or embarrassing meaning in a foreign 
language. And with more overseas sales, cross-cultural implications are 
becoming more important, Portugal says. American Express, for instance, was 
extremely careful that "Optima" had no bad connotations in the Far East, since 
it is determined to market the card there. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the importance of a name, too many companies wait until the last minute 
to make a selection, Master said. "If you wait that long, it becomes a big, 
emotional thing within the company," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's best to start thinking about a product name at least six months before 
the product is due to be shipped," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cute, tricky names are typically poor choices, even if they meet an initially 
warm reception around the office, according to Masters. Once the novelty has 
worn off, the name can become tiring and work against the company's best 
interest in the marketplace. There are exceptions to the rule, however. Such a 
name could work well, for instance, for a computer game or children's company, 
she noted.

SPACE STATION BUDGET CUTS CRITICIZED BY SYMPOSIUM MEMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Congress' decision to cut the budget of space station Freedom isn't very 
popular in the aerospace community, judging from comments at a symposium 
Saturday that addressed aspects of the $37-billion project. 
</P>
<P>
Congress cut the space station budget from $2.45 billion to $1.9 billion for 
the current year and ordered NASA to submit a redesigned station by the end of 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Charles (Pete) Conrad Jr., a former Gemini and Apollo astronaut who is now a 
staff vice president for new business at McDonnell Douglas Space Systems in 
Huntington Beach, said the mandate to redesign the space station is "a bunch of 
junk." 
</P>
<P>
"I like to say the future is running a little late," Conrad said, noting that 
the NASA budget was cut sharply during the Johnson and Nixon administrations. 
"We're 25 years behind schedule and we're about to make it worse. I don't 
understand what Congress is up to." 
</P>
<P>
The symposium in Huntington Beach was sponsored by the Los Angeles chapter of 
the Human Factors Society, a group involved in efforts to design products and 
equipment that suit human needs. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad said the reduced budget could also affect decisions by international 
players, such as Japan and the European Space Agency, to continue their 
participation in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Other sources at the symposium, which included a tour of McDonnell Douglas' 
mock-up of the space station, said a space station redesign would lack the 
years of research and billions of dollars already spent on the program. 
</P>
<P>
If NASA goes forward with plans to shorten the 508-foot truss assembly that 
serves as the main framework for the station, then McDonnell Douglas could see 
an impact on its work force, sources said. McDonnell Douglas is leading a team 
of contractors that are building a major portion of the station, including the 
truss assembly. 
</P>
<P>
But Tom Williams, a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas, said speculation that the 
company could trim its work force is inaccurate. The company expects to 
maintain its current employment on the project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is we can build a very good space station with $15.7 billion" in 
funding through 1996, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which employs 2,000 people on the space station in Huntington 
Beach and Houston, has frozen its hiring on the program.

HAWAIIAN AIR DEFAULTS ON LEASES, LOAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The parent company of Hawaiian Airlines, a troubled firm partly owned by a 
Newport Beach investor group headed by Peter V. Ueberroth, said Monday that it 
has defaulted on some aircraft leases and on a loan from Security Pacific Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The defaults came amid continued losses at HAL Inc. HAL said Monday that it 
lost $13.3 million for the third quarter, bringing its loss to $56.3 million 
for the first nine months of 1990. Revenue for the third quarter was $101.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The loss wiped out the company's net worth, which now stands at negative $50.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
HAL's default on its bank loan is surprising, since it came less than two weeks 
after Security agreed to give the firm an additional $20 million. The fresh 
financing brought HAL out of default on a $111-million loan, also from 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
As previously reported, HAL at that time granted Security warrants that could 
make the bank its biggest shareholder. Federal regulations, however, prevent 
Security from exercising most of the warrants. Banking industry analysts have 
said that Security could possibly sell the warrants at a profit should the 
airline ever work out its problems. 
</P>
<P>
HAL said that during September and October, it failed to pay $3.3 million on 
leases for 17 aircraft and is in default on those leases. Glen Stewart, senior 
vice president-finance, said the firm has negotiated new leases with five 
aircraft lessors and that it is attempting to negotiate new agreements with 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian leases all but two of the 36 aircraft in its fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said the company hopes to save $2 million a year by negotiating either 
lower lease payments or the postponement of payments. Stewart said HAL, with 
$12.5 million in cash at the end of the third quarter, had funds needed to make 
the lease payments. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a cash question," he said. "We thought it prudent to enter 
negotiations before making the payments." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said the airline previously obtained concessions from its employees and 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
HAL was in poor shape last December when it was acquired by Ueberroth and his 
associates, Newport Beach lawyer J. Thomas Talbot among them. The company board 
has attracted successful businessmen such as ex-Seattle Mariners owner George 
Argyros and department store magnate James F. Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
But the company's condition has worsened with the sharply higher interest costs 
related to the Ueberroth-led takeover. Third-quarter interest expense rose to 
$3.2 million in 1990 from $855,000 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
HAL has also been hurt by the high fuel prices and lower travel demand 
troubling the industry as a whole.

COLLEGE TO OPEN CENTER FOR SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

Rancho Santiago College plans to open the Orange County Small Business 
Development Center early next year. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which will provide consulting and referral services to residents 
who need help in starting or maintaining a small business, will be the only one 
of its kind in the county, college officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to direct people so they don't have to stumble around through a myriad 
of agencies," said Bonnie Slager, assistant dean of the business division at 
Rancho Santiago College. 
</P>
<P>
The center will offer counseling, technical assistance, loan packaging and 
access to government small business finance programs. It will also sponsor 
classes, workshops and conferences in cooperation with other business 
organizations within the county. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a really good way for people in a small business to get into an organized 
support system," Slager said. "There are a lot of people out there who are 
really lost in terms of knowing what they have to do to get started and where 
to get help." 
</P>
<P>
The center is being funded through a three-year $500,000 grant from the 
California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office and is one of 18 such centers 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
It will be housed, rent free, at the city's Santa Ana Business Enterprise 
Center at 901 E. Santa Ana Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The center will have one full-time consultant and one full-time clerical staff 
member as well as a number of part-time consultants. They will make referrals 
to relevant agencies and aid in problem solving, Slager said.

federal prosecutors to transfer Capistrano Beach resident Douglas P. 
Blankenship to a prison in Tacoma, Wash., while he awaits trial on charges that 
he conspired to defraud financial institutions in seven states of $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney's office in Tacoma, headquarters for the alleged scheme's 
largest victim, is trying the case against Blankenship. 
</P>
<P>
Rose scheduled a a hearing for Nov. 29 on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The magistrate also denied a second bail request by former Huntington Beach 
resident Michael E. Hilander, one of 14 co-defendants with Blankenship.

DRIVE IS MOUNTED TO MAKE FURS EXTINCT; 
</P>
<P>
WRAPS: ORANGE COUNTY GROUP DECLARES A "FUR-FREE FRIDAY." SLUMPING SALES AND 
PROTESTS HAVE RETAILERS WONDERING IF THE MERCHANDISE IS WORTH THE RISK. 
</P>

<P>
These days, just talking about fur causes many people to bristle. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Orange County People for Animals have declared the Friday after 
Thanksgiving "Fur-Free Friday" and they hold an annual anti-fur demonstration 
at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. This year they will give a "Cruelest 
Retailer of the Year" award to a store that carries fur. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with slumping fur sales and protests like these by animal-rights 
activists, some merchants are finding fur coats to be a fashion risk they'd 
rather not take. 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom became the latest retailer to abandon the fur business when it 
announced it would close its remaining fur salons by Feb. 1. The Seattle-based 
company had two fur salons in Orange County at its stores in South Coast Plaza 
and MainPlace/Santa Ana, but those salons have been closed for nearly a year as 
part of the fur phase-out. 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom attributed the closing of its remaining salons to sluggish sales. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really a business decision," said Linda Luna-Franks, spokeswoman for 
Nordstrom in Orange County. "We were seeing a decline in customers' requests -- 
they did not see this as a needed service." 
</P>
<P>
Some retailers have stopped carrying fur to avoid the wrath of animal-rights 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid the fur controversy, Nils Skiwear of Fountain Valley took the fur off 
of its 1990-91 collection of ski jackets, even though the styles had sold well 
during the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Amen Wardy, the high-fashion women's clothing store at Fashion Island in 
Newport Beach, has marked down its furs by 40% in an attempt to sell off its 
inventory by the end of the year. Soffia Wardy, general manager, is trying to 
keep her store out of the fur fracas. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd rather stay neutral," said Soffia Wardy. "There's too much controversy. 
It's attention we don't want." She declined to discuss the matter further. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, animal-rights activists are trying to drive furs into 
extinction. With each closure of a fur salon, they see a victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Fur sales are dying in the U.S.," said Ava Park of Costa Mesa, founder of 
Orange County People for Animals. "Last year it was Sears, now it's Nordstrom. 
Large retailers are being forced to take their fur departments out." 
</P>
<P>
She maintains that a combination of local pressure and education has made more 
people conscious of the plight of fur-bearing animals, and that has turned many 
off on fur. 
</P>
<P>
"People are becoming more aware," she said. "Since early 1988, our membership 
has doubled to 1,600 members in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Her group has been the most active in protesting fur. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the year, they pass out anti-fur leaflets at theater openings and 
black-tie galas. 
</P>
<P>
"Wherever women are wearing fur, we're there, too," Park said. 
</P>
<P>
They carry small cards that read, "Wearing fur promotes the idea that it is 
acceptable to kill an animal for vanity and profit. Please don't wear fur." 
</P>
<P>
"All winter long we discreetly give it to a woman wearing fur, or we slip it 
into a coat pocket," Park said. 
</P>
<P>
Those in the fur industry deny that these tactics have affected sales. The Fur 
Information Council of America in Washington, D.C., blames a sluggish economy 
and warm weather for any slowing of fur sales. 
</P>
<P>
"The retail industry in general is suffering reductions all over the place, so 
fur sales like jewelry and everything else are slightly down," says Bill 
Outlaw, spokesman for the council. "We think when the economy rebounds and the 
weather gets colder the sales figures will rise." 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the industry enjoyed its best year ever, with U.S. sales of $1.8 
billion, up from $1.5 billion in 1984, according to the Fur Industry of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
"If animal activists are having an effect, why did we have a record year last 
year?" Outlaw asked. "These people have been around for years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had steady growth through the '80s until the economic problems of the 
last six months." 
</P>
<P>
While Outlaw said his council's indicators show a slight dip in fur sales for 
September and October, sales for 1990 still could surpass those of 1989 after 
the winter months, traditionally the peak fur-selling season. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some furriers claim they have experienced no decline in sales. 
</P>
<P>
"Our fur business is very strong," said John Anderson, director of stores for 
Jindo Inc., a New Jersey-based national retailer which owns Jindo Furs in 
Fashion Island, Newport Beach. "We've seen no declining interest in sales." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson attributes the closing of Nordstrom's fur salons to a natural 
"contraction" after too many retailers overextended themselves on fur. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these retailers are not equipped to deal with a very special market," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did Anderson claim that animal activists have not hurt sales, he 
suggested some of their tactics have backfired. 
</P>
<P>
"Customers tell us, 'No one will tell me what I can wear.' We've had people buy 
coats just to say, 'I have freedom of choice.' " 
</P>
<P>
Fur sales also remain healthy at Neiman Marcus, according to Jan Roberts, 
spokeswoman for Neiman Marcus in Dallas, Tex. The retailer does not intend to 
follow Nordstrom and dismantle its fur salons. 
</P>
<P>
"Our business is good or we wouldn't do it," Roberts said.

TREATING VARICOSE, SPIDER VEINS WITHOUT SURGERY; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: INJECTIONS FOLLOWED BY COMPRESSION BANDAGES COST A FRACTION OF THE MORE 
TRADITIONAL TREATMENT.

You are looking at your legs one day and notice the beginnings of unsightly 
varicose or spider veins. "Well," you might say, "I may have to have surgery on 
those one of these days." 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Terrance Walsh says that is not necessarily the case. All you may need 
to do is get a few virtually painless injections to make those lumpy veins 
disappear. 
</P>
<P>
Symptoms include aching, swelling, a sense of heaviness, itching and leg 
restlessness. Complications range from leg cramps to severe disability. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said varicose veins are caused by malfunctioning valves which allow blood 
to be pulled down into a vein and accumulate. Large veins swell and have a 
bluish hue while smaller ones become thread-like purple lines called spider 
veins. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't know that there is any alternative other than surgery," 
said Walsh, head of the Atlanta office of the Vein Clinics of America. 
</P>
<P>
The method Walsh and related clinics use is called refined compression 
sclerotherapy. It uses the drug Sotradecol and special compression bandages to 
treat diseases of the veins. 
</P>
<P>
During the procedure, the drug is injected into a varicose vein. The walls of 
the vein become irritated and fuse to each other, sealing the leaking blood 
valve. Special compression bandages used in the three- to seven-day treatment 
speed the fusion. 
</P>
<P>
The clinics claim a success rate of nearly 100% for all patients, including 
those who have had previous vein surgery. Treatment is performed on an 
outpatient basis. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said his clinic charges between $1,000 to $2,500 per leg for the 
treatment, which is about one-fourth of the cost of traditional surgery to 
treat varicose and spider veins. 
</P>
<P>
There are a variety of other techniques available for treating vein disorders 
without surgery. They include laser beams, electrocautery and saline 
sclerotherapy, in which saline solution is injected into veins. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jerry King, an independent Chicago vascular surgeon, said the use of 
refined compression sclerotherapy "is a very acceptable way" of treating veins 
as an alternative to surgery. 
</P>
<P>
There are cases, he said, when refined compression sclerotherapy should not be 
used, such as when veins are ulcerating. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers say varicose veins are largely hereditary but other factors can 
exacerbate them, such as obesity or standing for long periods of time, 
increased estrogen levels brought on by pregnancy, menstruation or taking birth 
control pills. 
</P>
<P>
Prevention strategies include proper nutrition and exercise, avoidance of 
long-term standing, keeping legs elevated and wearing support stockings, 
experts say.

TRAVIS TRITT IS REAL CERTAIN HE'S FOR REAL

<P>
It's a good thing Travis Tritt is an engagingly gritty performer, because it 
takes that and more to rise above the young singer's love for what may be the 
dullest trend in contemporary country music. Like the glut of 
"how-ol'-Hank-woulda-done-it" songs in the last decade, the 27-year-old 
newcomer larded his 85-minute performance at the Bandstand on Sunday with 
protestations of how the music is supposed to be, instead of just shutting up 
and being what it's supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
On the hit "Country Club," he not only ran through a litany of requisite 
good-ol'-boy traits, but when he sang "I drive an old Ford pickup truck" he 
interjected, "I really do!" -- as if it was some remarkable proof of what a 
real guy he is. Defending his moribund mix of country and rock on "Put Some 
Drive in Your Country" (as if the styles hadn't previously been paired by 
everyone from Elvis and Johnny Cash on down), Tritt found it necessary to 
declare: "I'm just as country as anybody you're gonna see in your entire life." 
The thing is, ol' Hank and just about everybody else who had an effect on 
country music sang about the life they knew, rather than just spewing out 
credentials trying to prove they had a life. 
</P>
<P>
When the material gave him a chance, Tritt showed he's certainly capable of 
injecting real feeling into his music. He's an impressive singer, with a voice 
like a twanged, somewhat-less-impassioned Stevie Ray Vaughan. 
</P>
<P>
On "I'm Gonna Be Somebody" his singing rose above a hackneyed lyric to convey a 
sense of blue-collar desperation and yearning. His ballad vocals on the 
country-soul "If I Were a Drinker" and the hit "Help Me Hold On" earned the 
screams offered by his female fans in the packed club. 
</P>
<P>
Sporting a black, fringed and studded buckskin jacket and somewhat manicured 
redneck hair and beard, Tritt definitely has his star sparkle and stage moves 
down. 
</P>
<P>
He has a competent five-piece band, though it didn't leave much of a signature 
on the songs. That may be due in part to the fact that these aren't the same 
Nashville studio pros who played on the records. Still, his stage outfit, which 
shares the name Country Club with his debut album and song -- moved nimbly from 
hard country to Southern boogie. 
</P>
<P>
Tritt performed most of the tunes from his album, including "Dixie Flyer," "The 
Road Home" and "Drift Off to Dream," as well as boogie-ized versions of Chuck 
Berry's "The Promised Land" and the Doobie Bros. 1973 hit "Long Train Runnin'." 
There were also a couple of unreleased numbers, including Tritt's own 
hook-filled breakup song, "Here's a Quarter, Call Someone Who Cares." He 
recently recorded a pair of songs with the re-formed Little Feat, "Bible Belt" 
and "Time for a Change," but neither appeared in his set. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, if there's a jukebox in Hell, it surely will be crowded with 
those "gee-stardom-is-tough" road songs that so many artists feel compelled to 
share with us, and Tritt's unrecorded essay on that theme deserves inclusion. 
Given a country/space-jazz backing that fully warranted the ersatz fog that had 
been rolling off the stage throughout the show, Tritt -- who only landed three 
Top 10 hits (including two at No. 1) with his debut album and who is handled by 
megastar manager Ken Kragen -- delivered five minutes of solid self-pity about 
how rough it is up there giving away every ounce of energy he has. Jeez, if 
it's all that draining, maybe he'll need to get someone to drive his pickup 
truck for him.

MEMORIES ARE BACK AT UCLA; 
</P>
<P>
BRUINS: AND SO ARE THE FANS, SPURRED BY THE OPTIMISM GENERATED BY THE LAST TWO 
SEASONS OF BASKETBALL UNDER HARRICK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hanging outside the office of UCLA basketball Coach Jim Harrick is a picture of 
the Omni scoreboard in Atlanta, which shows the score of the Bruins' most 
important victory since 1980: 
</P>
<P>
UCLA 71, Kansas 70. 
</P>
<P>
That a second-round NCAA tournament victory would be celebrated by UCLA in such 
a way illustrates how far the Bruins have fallen. Second-round victories used 
to be routine for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The victory itself, however, showed how far they have advanced. 
</P>
<P>
Winners of only 16 of 30 games in the 1987-88 season, their last under Walt 
Hazzard, the Bruins won 21 in their first season under Harrick, 22 in their 
second. Included were three victories in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Between the 1979-80 season, when they reached the Final Four in their first 
season under Larry Brown, and the '87-88 season, when they failed to reach even 
the National Invitation Tournament, the Bruins won one NCAA tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
They made the tournament only three times in eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Under Harrick, the Bruins have brought excitement back to Pauley Pavilion, not 
to mention paying customers. The announcements last August by local high school 
stars Ed O'Bannon and Shon Tarver that they would enroll at UCLA after having 
made spoken commitments to troubled Nevada Las Vegas, sparked a run on season 
tickets. The Bruins hope to average more than 12,000 fans a game at Pauley for 
the first time since the 1975-76 season, their first after the retirement of 
John Wooden. 
</P>
<P>
They have landed in the top 10 in the United Press International's preseason 
poll of coaches for the first time since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
And until the highly regarded O'Bannon suffered a season-ending knee injury 
last month, Sports Illustrated was planning a cover story on UCLA's resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
On the down side, the Bruins finished in a tie for third place in the improved 
but still not imposing Pacific 10 Conference two seasons ago, fourth last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
And the Bruins have failed to bridge the gap between themselves and Arizona, 
which has developed into a national power and become the overwhelming favorite 
to win the Pac-10 championship for the fifth time in six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick, however, won't concede anything to the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
"They have everything -- size, decent speed, good ability," he said. "But when 
I was at Pepperdine, San Francisco had some great teams, and the second year I 
was there, we tied for the conference championship. The third year, they were 
seventh in the country and we went 14-0 in the conference and beat them twice." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has four starters back from last season's team, which was 22-11 and lost 
to Duke in the round of 16 in the NCAA tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Junior forward Don MacLean, who set a Pac-10 freshman scoring record two 
seasons ago, ranked second in the conference in scoring and third in rebounding 
as a sophomore, averaging 19.9 points and 8.7 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
He added 20 pounds over the summer, has since lost six and, at 230 pounds, said 
he feels stronger. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I'm most happy about is that it hasn't cut down on my quickness," 
MacLean said of his weight gain. "I'm probably even a little quicker because my 
legs are stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Only two former Bruins, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton, averaged more 
points as sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sophomore forward Tracy Murray averaged 14.9 points and 6.4 rebounds in 18 
games as a starter last season. His free throws with nine seconds left provided 
the margin of victory against Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
He is expected to fill the void left by Trevor Wilson, a three-time Pac-10 
rebound leader who is playing for the Atlanta Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Junior point guard Darrick Martin was inconsistent in his second season as 
a starter, but still averaged 11.3 points and led the Bruins in assists and 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Junior guard Gerald Madkins was a reluctant shooter as a sophomore, but 
ranked second on the team in assists and steals and was the Bruins' best 
backcourt defender. He made a team-high 42.2% of his three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Joining those four as starters will be Mitchell Butler, a 6-5 sophomore 
swingman who will join Madkins on the wings in the Bruins' new 1-2-2 offensive 
alignment. 
</P>
<P>
One of those spots originally was earmarked for Murray, a 6-8 long-range 
shooter. O'Bannon, a 6-8 forward, was expected to join the 6-10 MacLean on the 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
After O'Bannon's injury, a former walk-on, 6-8 senior Keith Owens, was 
considered to have the inside track at a starting position, but Owens was 
bothered by a back injury and Butler squeezed him out. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick was reluctant to start such a small lineup -- Martin is 5-11, Madkins 
6-4 -- but Butler, who was a reserve guard last season, has impressed him. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect big, big things from him," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
To utilize their quickness and compensate for their lack of size, the Bruins 
will run at every opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have that kind of talent," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
The top reserves will be Owens, once the pain in his lower back subsides, and 
Tarver, who will push Martin, Madkins and Butler for playing time in the 
backcourt and could end up starting before the end of the season, Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Zimmerman, a 6-9 freshman from Colorado Springs, Colo., also is expected 
to play after recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery. Zan Mason, a 6-7 
sophomore forward, probably will play more than he did last season, when he 
averaged 6 1/2 minutes in 22 games, but didn't get off the bench in 11 others. 
</P>
<P>
O'Bannon was considered by many to be the nation's No. 1 prospect last season 
at Artesia High in Lakewood. For two weeks after O'Bannon was injured, "it was 
like there was a black cloud over our whole program," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
The cloud has since lifted and UCLA has accepted its fate. 
</P>
<P>
"We were really looking forward to playing with Ed, but I think once we got 
past that, we all said, 'This is what we've got, we can do it,' " MacLean said. 
"We never had Ed, so basically we're the same club (as last season)." 
</P>
<P>
At least, most of the personnel is the same. But the Bruins will be improved 
defensively, Harrick said. And, potentially, they are a better shooting team. 
</P>
<P>
"This team's a little closer and shares the ball a little better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said MacLean: "Hopefully, this year, when we get to the Sweet 16, it won't be 
as much of a shock. It will be like, 'OK, we're in the Sweet 16. Let's go 
farther.' "

MANLEY REINSTATED, BUT HE IS WAIVED BY THE REDSKINS

Dexter Manley got the new chance he has been looking for from the NFL. Now he's 
looking for a place to resume his career. 
</P>
<P>
The former Pro Bowl defensive end was reinstated to the league Monday, a year 
after he was banned for substance abuse, but he was also waived by the 
Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new beginning," Manley told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"I am most grateful to the commissioner for the faith, trust confidence he has 
placed in me," Manley said in a statement through his lawyer. "I will make 
every effort never to violate that trust." 
</P>
<P>
Several teams have expressed an interest in picking up Manley when he becomes 
eligible for waivers today. He would go to the team with the worst record that 
claims him. If no team claims him by Wednesday afternoon, Manley would become a 
free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Manley's attorney, Bob Woolf, said he had heard indirectly that the Rams and 
Raiders are interested, but Phoenix, which has the second-worst record in the 
NFL, has also expressed an interest, as have Miami and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Manley would be eligible to practice this 
week but not allowed to play in a game until Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL, in a statement released from New York, said Manley must avoid drug 
involvement and participate in a "structured support program" to remain in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Joe Gibbs said the Redskins released Manley because the team already has 
enough defensive linemen. He said Manley, who has had several problems and a 
previous suspension in Washington, could do better in a different city. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to miss him. He gave a lot to us," Gibbs said.

IF SLIDE CONTINUES, EXPECT CHANGES; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: TEAM EXECUTIVE SHAW SAYS IT'S TOO EARLY TO TALK ABOUT ROBINSON'S FUTURE, 
BUT HE OFFERS NO VOTE OF CONFIDENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Although acknowledging that management is deeply disappointed with the Rams' 
3-7 record, Executive Vice President John Shaw said Monday that it was "far too 
premature" to start drawing conclusions about Coach John Robinson's future with 
the club. 
</P>
<P>
But Shaw also suggested that if the team does not show improvement over the 
final six weeks of the season, management would take some major actions. And he 
did not rule out the possibility of replacing Robinson, who has coached the 
Rams since 1983 and has, until now, enjoyed remarkable job security. 
</P>
<P>
"We really haven't addressed the issues as to what changes we'd make," Shaw 
said. "All I can tell you is that if the team isn't turned around, there are 
sure to be a lot of changes. 
</P>
<P>
"But as far as speculating about the head coach, it's far too premature because 
right now there have been no indications about making that change." 
</P>
<P>
When pressed on the matter -- asked directly if Robinson is likely to be the 
Rams' coach in 1991 -- Shaw wouldn't go much further than saying that the whole 
organization will be "reviewed and examined" at the end of the season, as is 
normal team practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I would really have no comment to that," Shaw said in response to the 1991 
question. "We're going to look at all our options at the end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
But by not giving Robinson a vote of confidence, Shaw was asked, isn't he 
opening the door to rampant speculation about Robinson's status? 
</P>
<P>
"I think you're reading more into the speculation than actually exists," Shaw 
said. "I don't believe the organization will make any decision until after the 
season. It's obviously an ownership decision. The situation will be examined at 
the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"But if things don't turn around, I would think that the organization would 
make every effort to make those decisions that would turn us back into a 
winning organization." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Robinson said that he knows his job may depend on what happens in 
the final six weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
After falling one game short of the Super Bowl last season and an off-season of 
high expectations, Robinson said talk about his job is natural. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he prefers to concentrate on his team's status, not his own. "My 
own particular job security or future isn't as important to me now as being 
able to find a way to get this football team playing," he said. "That's 
important to me. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to be cavalier about my job or any of that, but I've been 
coaching a long time, and I think I've coached well. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm suddenly in a position where my team is not doing well. And I want to 
try to change that." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who has had only one losing season, the strike-torn 1987 season, in 
his seven full seasons with the Rams, and who fielded a consistent winner in 
seven years at USC, said winning is a matter of individual and team pride. 
</P>
<P>
"You're willing to leave the job, or go on to the next job -- we're all going 
to have different jobs in our lives -- that's not the key issue," Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The key issue is we're a group of people who, going into this year, had the 
fifth-most wins in this league over the last seven years, had the second-most 
playoff appearances in this league, a club that had won 13 games last year, 
suddenly now we've gotten ourselves in a lot of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we would like to get back to being able to believe in ourselves the 
way we havein the past. That's what the issue is." 
</P>
<P>
Particularly in Sunday's 24-21 defeat by the Dallas Cowboys, but also 
throughout this dismal season, Robinson said that he is troubled by his team's 
inability to play with passion. 
</P>
<P>
And he said he will begin putting younger players such as safety Pat Terrell 
and offensive lineman Bern Brostek into the game more, just to see what 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a point there where you're getting shoved off the end of the cliff 
and you better damn sure do something about it," Robinson said. "You better go 
off fighting. And I'm not sure that I believe we're doing that. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working and we're trying and we're improving on the practice field . . . 
but I just don't see the kind of fight where we should be absolutely panicked 
in our fight for survival. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the key to any semblance of recovery for the rest of this year. . . . 
Right now that's the area I find repulsive about us. We're not able to let go 
of whatever rage or whatever fight there is in us at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has been trying all season to keep his team's hope alive, to encourage 
the players and expect them to return to form. 
</P>
<P>
Now, though, with a game against the San Francisco 49ers (10-0) looming Sunday, 
Robinson just seems frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a season like this," Robinson said. "Disappointing . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not used to losing. I've won the 15 years I've been coaching. And I've 
also had competitive teams. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I've felt, always when it came down to crucial moments in games or crucial 
plays, our guys gave it their best at that point. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a passivity, and just seemingly allowing this to happen and not being 
concerned and perplexed and not striking out at whatever, at the gods of 
football or something for the position that we're in."

PACIFIC 10 PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
OUTSTANDING DEPTH MAKES NO. 3 ARIZONA THE CLEAR CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arizona, which has has won or tied for the Pacific 10 championship in four of 
the last five seasons, is expected to run away with the conference title this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that Arizona is one of the 
top two or three teams in the country," Washington State Coach Kelvin Sampson 
said. "And they have the best players in the league. There's no reason for them 
not to win it. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked at their roster and counted seven possible NBA draft choices, and I 
think that's being conservative." 
</P>
<P>
Cal Coach Lou Campanelli agreed, saying: "Arizona is head and shoulders above 
everyone else. They've got three subs who could probably start for eight of the 
10 teams in the Pac-10." 
</P>
<P>
The third-ranked Wildcats, who advanced to the Final Four in 1987-'88, have 
started quickly this season, advancing to the semifinals of the Dodge National 
Invitation Tournament Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford, which has all five of last season's starters, among them forward Adam 
Keefe, and UCLA, which has four starters back, could challenge the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can give Arizona some competition," Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery 
said. "They look awfully strong on paper." 
</P>
<P>
Here's a team-by team look at the conference, exclusive of UCLA and USC, which 
are previewed elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
ARIZONA 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 25-7 overall, 15-3 Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 finish: First (tie). 
</P>
<P>
After winning the Pac-10 tournament, Arizona lasted only two games into the 
NCAA tournament, losing to Alabama by 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats, who have six of their top seven scorers from last season, figure 
to get farther than that this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Arizona has the makings of a team that could win the national championship," 
said TV analyst Dick Vitale. "They're going to be a dominant, dominant force." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona's front line is clearly the best in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Mills, a 6-foot-6 transfer from Kentucky, will replace Jud Buechler at 
small forward, with 6-11 junior Brian Williams at power forward. A transfer 
from Maryland, Williams was a disappointment last season, averaging 10.6 points 
and 4.7 rebounds after sitting out a season. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Lute Olson, however, is confident that Mills won't have a similar letdown 
after sitting out last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Sitting out a year doesn't help anyone, but Chris is a real gym rat," Olson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Rooks, a 6-10 junior, and Wayne Womack, a 6-8 junior, give Arizona depth 
at forward. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Stokes, a seven-foot sophomore who led the Pac-10 in blocked shots last 
season, will start at center. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Muehlebach, a 6-2 senior, and Matt Othick, a 6-1 junior, will start in the 
backcourt. The co-MVP of the Pac-10 tournament, Muehlebach averaged 11.3 points 
and 5.7 assists last season. 
</P>
<P>
Khalid Reeves, a 6-2 freshman from Christ the King High in Queens, N.Y., is 
expected to get plenty of playing time. One of the top prep basketball players 
in New York, Reeves averaged 25.5 points last season. Arizona's biggest 
weakness has been its lack of quickness in the backcourt, but Reeves could 
remedy that. 
</P>
<P>
ARIZONA STATE 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 15-16, 6-12 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 finish: Seventh (tie). 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Michigan for Arizona State, Coach Bill Frieder led the Sun Devils 
to the NIT in his first season and then hit the recruiting trail. 
</P>
<P>
A tireless, compulsive recruiter, Frieder signed five talented high school 
players and a junior college transfer. 
</P>
<P>
ASU got front-line players: Jamal Faulkner, a 6-7 teammate of Arizona's Reeves 
at Christ the King High in Queens; Robert Conslick, a 6-11 center from Los 
Alamitos High, and Ian Dale, a 6-8 forward from South High in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Stevin Smith, a 6-2 freshman guard from Spruce High in Dallas, could start this 
season. The other recruits are Dwayne Fontana, a 6-4 All-American guard from 
Riordan High in San Francisco, and Lynn Collins, a 6-1 guard from Odessa Junior 
College in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
ASU also has three starters returning, 6-10 center Isaac Austin and guards 
Brian Camper and Matt Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
CALIFORNIA 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 22-10, 12-6. 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 finish: Third. 
</P>
<P>
After making the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1960 last season, 
eliminating Indiana before losing to Connecticut, Cal might be hard pressed to 
make the tournament again this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears must replace point guard Keith Smith, a three-year starter who broke 
Kevin Johnson's school assist record. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you lose a point guard who has started for three years and replace 
him with someone with no experience, it's tough," Campanelli said. "We'll 
struggle early until we get used to playing with someone new at that position." 
</P>
<P>
DeShon Brown, a 6-2 sophomore who played in only 10 games last season, and 
Billy Dreher, a 6-4 sophomore, are competing to start at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of the Bears will be the front court of Brian Hendrick and Roy 
Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-8 sophomore swingman, Hendrick averaged 15.9 points and 7.7 rebounds last 
season and made the All-Pac-10 team. Fisher, a 6-7 senior forward, averaged 
14.9 points and 6.3 rebounds last season. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Drew, a 6-3 senior, will start at shooting guard. One of the best 
three-point shooters in the Pac-10, Drew averaged 9.8 points last season and 
shot 42% from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
OREGON 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 15-14, 10-8. 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 finish: Fifth. 
</P>
<P>
After being picked to finish in the cellar last season, the Ducks finished 
fifth and made the NIT for the second time in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
And Oregon, with four starters back, should be improved this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Ducks have one of the best backcourts in the league with sharpshooters 
Terrell Brandon and Kevin Mixon. A 6-0 junior, Brandon averaged 17.9 points, 
six assists and 3.6 rebounds. Mixon averaged 12.5 points last season. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Richard Lucas and center Bob Fife, who became a starter midway through 
last season, also return. A 6-7 senior, Lucas averaged 10.9 points and 8.5 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Ducks also recruited well, signing six players, among them guard Orlando 
Williams, the Oregon high school player of the season. Williams averaged 26.3 
points at Benson Tech High in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
OREGON STATE 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 22-7, 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 finish: First (tie). 
</P>
<P>
After tying Arizona for the Pac-10 title last season, the Beavers lost 
All-American point guard Gary Payton and might slip into the second division. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding problems, Will Brantley, a senior from Seattle who is the Beavers' 
leading returning scorer, and Allan Celestine, a senior from Ridgecrest, 
Calif., were suspended for a week Monday by Coach Jim Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Brantley, who averaged 11 points last season, was apparently involved in two 
assault incidents last weekend, according to Corvallis police, although charges 
have not been filed in either case. 
</P>
<P>
Celestine, Charles McKinney and Kevin Harris are vying for the vacancy left by 
Payton. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-1 senior, Celestine averaged 4.1 points and three assists last season as 
the first player off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
But it will be hard to replace Payton, the No. 2 pick in the NBA draft, who led 
the Beavers in scoring, rebounding and bragging. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Teo Alebegovic, a 6-9 senior who averaged 8.9 points and 3.3 rebounds 
last season, might have to score more to pick up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
STANFORD 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 18-12, 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 finish: Sixth (tie). 
</P>
<P>
After making the NCAA tournament in 1989, the Cardinal was expected to struggle 
last season. But Stanford got off to an 8-0 start and went on to make the NIT 
for the second time in the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal, with its entire starting lineup intact, should be even stronger 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a little too much is being made of the fact that we have five starters 
back," Montgomery said. "Realistically, we were a sixth-place ballclub last 
year. We've got to prove that we can do the things that we didn't do last year, 
which caused us to finish sixth." 
</P>
<P>
Keefe, a 6-9 junior center who led the Pac-10 in rebounding and field-goal 
percentage last season and was third in scoring, could be the best big man in 
the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Keefe are forwards Andrew Vlahov, a 6-7 senior, and Deshon Wingate, a 
6-7 senior. 
</P>
<P>
Vlahov, who played for the Australian national team last summer, has become 
more assertive. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the ability but he never knew when to assert himself," Montgomery said. 
"If he missed a shot, he'd let it affect him." 
</P>
<P>
Senior guards Kenny Ammann and John Patrick also return. Ammann shot 46.5% from 
three-point range last season. 
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 11-17, 5-13. 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 finish: Ninth. 
</P>
<P>
After replacing Andy Russo last season, Coach Lynn Nance was unable to 
revitalize the Huskies, who have had three consecutive losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Although Russo recruited well, signing four players, the Huskies might still be 
a year away. 
</P>
<P>
Two starters return from last season, 6-5 forward Dion Brown and 6-8 forward 
Mike Hayward. 
</P>
<P>
The Pac-10 freshman of the year four years ago, Hayward hasn't reached his 
potential, averaging 5.2 points and 2.8 rebounds last season. Brown averaged 
11.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Lautenbach, a 6-10 senior, will start at center with 6-4 sophomore Quentin 
Youngblood at shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON STATE 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 7-22, 1-17. 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 finish: Last. 
</P>
<P>
After watching his team lose its final 18 games, Sampson revamped the Cougars, 
signing nine players, four of them junior college transfers. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the junior college transfers, all from Texas, will start for the 
Cougars: Neil Derrick, a 6-3 guard from Trinity Valley Junior College in 
Garland; Terrence Lewis, a 6-4 All-American guard from Howard Junior College in 
Big Spring, and Ken Critton, a 6-8 forward from West Texas Junior College in 
Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Paine, a 6-10 junior forward-center who averaged 9.3 points and 4.3 
rebounds last season, is being challenged by David Vik, a 6-11 freshman from 
Everett High in Everett, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have depth in the front line and we've never had that before," Sampson 
said. 
</P>

Although WSU has won only five Pac-10 games under Sampson the past two seasons, 
he isn't worried about his job. "Kelvin Sampson puts pressure on Kelvin 
Sampson," Sampson said. "Nobody puts more pressure on me than I do. But I think 
we may be the most improved team in the league this year."

<P>
In the beginning, the rabbi in the rumpled suit could not compete with Ted 
Koppel. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it appeared to be a collision of opposites -- the rabbi, known as a 
grand master of digressions, a storyteller who tells stories within stories, 
versus the anchorman, known for his slam-dunk questions. 
</P>
<P>
But then, about halfway into "An Evening Dialogue Between Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz 
and Ted Koppel," 455 American Jews in the audience seemed to stop breathing 
after Koppel asked a question about the rabbi's lifework: "What good is it 
going to do, sir?" 
</P>
<P>
Adin Steinsaltz -- condemned by some as a "heretic," gushed over by others as a 
"once-in-a-millenium-scholar" -- was ready. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm saying, the Jewish people, in general, are in the strange situation of a 
person who somehow lost a part of his soul. For many of them it's like some 
hereditary malady. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something like a machine with some of the parts out," he continued. "For 
our people, what I'm trying to do is replace some of the parts." 
</P>
<P>
By translating a book. But not just any book. The Talmud. 
</P>
<P>
And Steinsaltz, 53, of Jerusalem, has found a way to make this complicated work 
accessible enough so it has made its way into chain bookstores and on to night 
stands and coffee tables across America. 
</P>
<P>
The Talmud is a centuries-old compilation of the combined wisdom of thousands 
of debates and discussions among rabbis about Jewish law and life -- what is 
acceptable and what is not. It is an in-your-face, prove-it-to-me discussion 
that Jews have used for generations as a portable reference to their history, 
identity and culture. But for scholars who study it in the now-dead Aramaic 
language and in an exceptionally arcane form of Hebrew, the 2.5 million words 
often obscure as much as they reveal. And many American Jews don't even know 
what the Talmud is. 
</P>
<P>
The rabbi decided they should learn. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 20 years Steinsaltz has been consumed by translating this 
compendium of Jewish learning into modern Hebrew. He has labored page by page, 
volume by volume. In keeping with ancient readers' traditions, he has added his 
own commentary. He has subsumed others' into his translation under a rubric he 
calls "Notes." His has completed 22 volumes and hopes to finish No. 40 by the 
year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Big deal, you say? 
</P>
<P>
It is, in fact, a very big deal. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 1 million copies of the various volumes have been sold in Israel, and 
young scholars have been known to study the traditional edition in school and 
keep their Steinsaltz edition at home, under the bed for emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
But the rabbi didn't stop with the translation into modern Hebrew. Once 
Steinsaltz began helping would-be scholars unscramble the Talmudic codes in 
Hebrew he decided to try it in English. And last year, Random House published 
his inaugural volume in English and a reference guide. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, the Talmud sold. At $40 a clip. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 60,000 copies are out there, and in the notoriously unsentimental 
business of publishing, there is no better evidence of success than what is 
happening this week: Volumes 2 and 3 of "The Talmud: The Steinsaltz Edition" 
are on their way to Los Angeles bookstores. Volumes 4 and 5 are expected to be 
off the presses next fall. 
</P>
<P>
"The extraordinary thing about the project is that it truly works," says Random 
House's Peter Osnos. "We're talking about the Talmud! We're talking about 
something that is 
</P>
<P>
one of the great sacred works of Jewish history. There is this whole new 
audience for it." 
</P>
<P>
There is much arguing in the Talmud. There is occasional bitterness and 
one-upmanship. But mostly it is a passionate debate over interpretation of 
Jewish law, about assumptions and viewpoints. 
</P>
<P>
And as valuable as the text is considered, the Talmud is venerated as a 
demonstration of a method of learning that has made Jews a skeptical, 
questioning, learning people. 
</P>
<P>
The rabbi wants to bring all of that and more to his people. 
</P>
<P>
For some, therein begins The Problem. 
</P>
<P>
Since his English edition was issued, the rabbi has been lauded like nobody's 
hero. He's gotten The Treatment: big, splashy newspaper profiles, morning 
television show appearances, invitations to lecture at prestigious 
universities, and, of course, the moving testimonies. 
</P>
<P>
They have cascaded upon the rabbi like a thick snow, smoothering him, yet 
urging him to go further. 
</P>
<P>
The rabbi's critics, mostly Talmudic scholars, have been less restrained. 
</P>
<P>
They are disdainful that he has done "Good Morning America," that he talks to 
People magazine and has these intimate chats with the likes of Koppel, an event 
sponsored by the Washington, D.C., Jewish Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
It is, they say, as if he is selling the Talmud. 
</P>
<P>
Which he is. 
</P>
<P>
Steinsaltz's critics call him a "popularizer," in the worse sense of the word 
and a "vulgarizer," in the best sense. They say that while he has added his 
commentary to his Talmudic translation -- something that has not been done for 
the complete Talmud in 1,000 years -- it is not a particularly original 
addition. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all, they dislike what the rabbi omitted. While a traditional 
Talmud includes almost a dozen commentators, Steinsaltz dispenses with all but 
one. Rashi, an 11th-Century French scholar who was the last to comment on the 
entire Talmud, survived in Steinsaltz's English edition -- in idiosyncratic 
Hebrew script. 
</P>
<P>
It is this sort of condensation, pre-digestion and fiddling that troubles 
Steinsaltz's critics, mostly Talmudic experts. They fervently hold to the 
ancient Judaic notion that "You should learn from teachers and not from books." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Samuelson, a book editor who critiqued Steinsaltz's English edition for 
The Nation magazine wrote: "In making the Talmud overly accommodating to 
strangers, the translators have betrayed its essence. Reading the Steinsaltz 
Talmud in English is like trying to understand what a crossword puzzle is when 
the words have been filled in. You get the idea but you miss the point: Process 
is everything." 
</P>
<P>
In a long, detailed review in the New York Times Book Review that itself had 
the cadence of a Talmudic discussion, Leon Wieseltier, the New Republic's 
literary editor, expressed concern about what the student loses by this 
translation: "The duty of the translator, of course, is to provide Talmud, not 
Talmudism. As a translator, and as an amplifier of his translation, Rabbi 
Steinsaltz succeeds nicely. But this is not only a translation of the Talmud. 
It is also a mimicry of the Talmud. It leaves the student on the surface, but 
it dupes him into feeling that he has dived below. 
</P>
<P>
"For this reason," he warned, "it should be issued with a little care. . . . 
The Steinsaltz Talmud is light only at the beginning of the tunnel, and the 
road is long." 
</P>
<P>
It certainly comes as no surprise that this version of the Talmud has created a 
storm of criticism. Osnos said he was not surprised: "If there weren't critics, 
it wouldn't be the Talmud." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the rabbi has accumulated scores of defenders -- and in some of the oddest 
places. There are the synagogue sisterhoods and brotherhoods who flock to his 
lectures across the country; the writers and opinion makers he periodically 
leads in Talmud classes in Manhattan; and people like the president of Italy 
and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), who are listed as advisers of the 
Aleph Society, an organization of admirers dedicated to supporting the works of 
one Adin Steinsaltz. 
</P>
<P>
Although feminist author Letty Cottin Pogrebin finds the rabbi "very 
problematic on the women's issue" she ardently praises what his new English 
text has done for "the people." 
</P>
<P>
"It's such nonsense what these arrogant purists and elitists say," she said. 
"These are really people who don't want the masses to know unless they do it 
step by baby step which simply isn't the way modern life works in the Jewish 
community. 
</P>
<P>
The rabbi himself seems the least concerned with the blistering he has taken 
from his Talmudic contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to say, nobody reads the all the commentaries," he said. "That's 
one thing. Nobody reads them. 
</P>
<P>
"You see what I am doing in my work on the Talmud is a very simple thing, which 
is done and has been done for the last few thousand years, just in a slightly 
different form. You see, I am not writing a new book. I am just sitting there 
and teaching a class. It's like having a portable teacher. . . . Obviously, you 
never expect, if you are not a complete fool, to get everything that has to be 
known from that class." 
</P>
<P>
Steinsaltz is not such an easy man to know. 
</P>
<P>
Ask him a direct question about himself and you get an answer that goes off in 
many directions; he dawdles, intellectually, at each and every aside; he 
derails his own train of thought. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, he speaks like a Talmudic scholar. 
</P>
<P>
So here's a question: 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi, what was going on in your life at age 27, when, of all things, you 
decided to begin to translate and create a modern Talmud? 
</P>
<P>
First, always, he smiles and squirms his narrow shoulders and bounces a little 
in his seat. The eyes are so lively that even behind the thick square glasses 
they radiate a little message -- a combination of brilliant scholar and Peck's 
bad boy. 
</P>
<P>
"What was in my mind?" he says, finally hunkering down the shoulders. "Well. It 
is a good question. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, it is a book that I love. You see, I got entangled with it. I 
did not intend earlier to do anything like this. It was not that a person plans 
his life to do one specific thing. It was my hobby, a very big hobby. So I got 
entangled with a hobby." 
</P>
<P>
And he goes on for a while about hobbies, until after three detours, several 
references to the Torah, "Alice in Wonderland," and, of course, his own 
writings, he gets back to himself and the "hubris" -- his word -- that drove 
him to such an undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
"I have done since many other outrageous things," he continues. "But in one 
way, see, there was a feeling that there is something that has to be done. . . 
. It is like I am walking a long a way and find somebody wounded and I'm the 
only person that can do something about it. Now I know that I am not qualified, 
I am not the best person to do it, I am not the right person to do it, but I'm 
here. So in a way it is not hubris." 
</P>
<P>
Adin Steinsaltz came to religious life and scholarship the way many a have 
found a cause -- through rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Israel to a typically secular family of socialists, Steinsaltz read men 
like Marx and Lenin before he got to Maimonides. It wasn't until his mid-teens 
that he discovered the sages of the Talmud. He was introduced to Jewish studies 
by a private tutor whom his parents hoped would give him not only the knowledge 
of what he was rejecting but also the skills to refute it. 
</P>
<P>
His father Avraham, an early Zionist, was said to have told him, "I don't care 
if you are a heretic, I don't want you to be an ignoramus." 
</P>
<P>
But something happened. 
</P>
<P>
The slight boy with the blondish red curls became impassioned by spiritual 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
At 15, he took a year off from a secular school to attend a Yeshiva. Although 
he was to complete a university degree in physics and mathematics, he was more 
engrossed in Jewish studies. As he once explained, "I came to the point that 
this world was not enough." 
</P>
<P>
Now a father of three and husband to an Israeli psychologist, Steinsaltz has -- 
in between his work on new versions of the Talmud -- written numerous other 
books including a detective novel and relatively well-known work on Jewish 
mysticism called "The Thirteen Petalled Rose." When he is in Israel, he said, 
he works like a mad man at his computer -- 10, 12, 15 hours without stop. With 
success and support from wealthy contributors, he has become a mini-industry. 
He has about a dozen translators working for him on his various projects, 
including his newest adventure in the vernacular, translating the Talmud into 
Russian. 
</P>
<P>
Yet this frail man with a searing wit is also a man for all seasons. 
</P>
<P>
He is as well versed in fundamental Jewish texts as he is in modern literature 
and scientific studies. 
</P>
<P>
He talks about the "Wind in the Willows" as easily he does Dickens; he knows as 
much as about zoos across America (he visits them when he is lecturing) as he 
does biblical landmarks in his homeland. And he's no stranger to rich and the 
famous -- not that he thinks much of them. But in his own self-effacing way 
he's a natural politician and a pretty good schmoozer. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of his Koppel side-by-side he managed to both flatter him for his 
work on "Nightline" and point out that in his work of informing the people he, 
as the son of German Jews, was also fulfilling his role as one of the chosen 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people," said the rabbi, "for whatever they are, always get involved in 
somebody else's business." 
</P>
<P>
So when Ted Koppel concluded their evening precisely on time at 9:30 p.m. so he 
could get back to the studio in time for his 11:30 show, the rabbi insisted on 
having the last word. 
</P>
<P>
After Koppel said he "enjoyed it and I rather suspect everyone else here did 
too," the rabbi waited for the applause to die down and tacked on a little 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
"You see Ted, you asked me to call you Ted so I do it," Steinsaltz began with 
an impish grin, "When you said you enjoyed it I was slightly offended because 
if you said it was an hour or an hour and a half that was most uncomfortable, 
then when you go to work maybe something I said would stick with you and 
possibly make somebody else think, then I would really be proud. But that you 
enjoyed it, no, now I am afraid that I wasted my time."

THE DISCOVERY OF A GENE LINKED TO A DISEASE BRINGS JOY TO AFFLICTED PATIENTS 
AND THEIR FAMILIES. BUT SOON AFTER COMES THE LETDOWN: THEY MAY NOT LIVE LONG 
ENOUGH TO SEE THE CURE.

Paul Motenko recalls the day last year when researchers announced they had 
discovered the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis. The father of a 4-year-old 
daughter with the fatal disease, Motenko was elated to hear that news, but he 
didn't expect the event would also leave him feeling empty. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, it was almost a depressing day for me," Motenko said. "All 
of a sudden, after hearing hype, you're hearing reality. You still really don't 
know where you stand. The discovery happens and yet nothing changes. No one has 
been cured." 
</P>
<P>
The roller-coaster ride between hope and pessimism is a common experience for 
families touched by genetic disorders. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of a gene, while thrilling to researchers, doesn't mean that a 
cure or even improved therapy is immediately available to patients. 
</P>
<P>
Patients and their families are heartened to see progress, but the discovery of 
a gene can set them on a nail-biting race against the clock, hoping that they 
can outlast the disease until treatment or a cure is found. And, sometimes, the 
discovery yields information that indicates a cure will be much more 
complicated to achieve than expected. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bittersweet time right now," says Francis Collins, a University of 
Michigan researcher who co-discovered the cystic fibrosis gene last year. 
</P>
<P>
"On one hand, we are beginning to get a glimpse of how we might treat 
(patients). But there are people who don't have much time left." 
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the genes for debilitating, often fatal hereditary 
disorders such as cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Huntington's 
disease have been identified within the body's complex hereditary code. And, 
with 3,000 such disorders known, scientists are closing in on many more 
stunning discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
A flawed gene ultimately gives rise to a disorder or allows it to be passed on 
to subsequent generations. Identifying the gene is the icebreaker that gives 
scientists an opportunity to learn what is going wrong in the body and how to 
fix it. 
</P>
<P>
But the sudden windfall of long-hoped-for gene discoveries has heaped 
unexpected emotional turmoil on patients and researchers. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the recent cystic fibrosis discovery pinpointed the gene in a key 
protein that malfunctions in patients with the disease. However, scientists 
were dismayed to uncover almost 50 mutations within the CF gene. The mutations 
will make a potential prenatal screening test and treatment much more difficult 
to construct. 
</P>
<P>
"They were more optimistic before they found the gene than afterward," Motenko 
says. 
</P>
<P>
For other hereditary disorders, a potentially lifesaving treatment is only a 
few more experiments, perhaps one major clinical trial, away. Even the best 
hope for curing genetic disorders -- gene therapy -- no longer seems like a 
fantasy. In September, researchers initiated the first human gene therapy, 
inserting copies of healthy genes in a boy stricken with adenosine deaminase 
deficiency, an immune system disorder. 
</P>
<P>
But it will be many months before the success of that treatment is known. And 
medical experts are still unable to say just how long it will be before 
patients begin to benefit from gene discoveries and gene therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the question that is the most frequently asked and is the most 
difficult to respond to: How long will it be before there is a treatment?," 
Collins says. "I try not to list a number of years because I don't know, nor 
does anyone without a crystal ball." 
</P>
<P>
Discovering just where a faulty gene lurks in the body is a major hurdle. 
Making the leap from the gene discovery to understanding how the gene disrupts 
or destroys can be just as challenging, says Harvard University pediatrician 
Louis J. Kunkel. In 1987, Kunkel's research team discovered the gene that 
causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a disorder that causes muscle weakness and 
eventually cripples. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very satisfying to accomplish what was so difficult and long and arduous 
to do," Kunkel says. "But there is always a little bit of a letdown after that 
discovery. You think, 'Where do you go from here?' We've known about (the cause 
of) some other genetic diseases for many years, but we still don't have 
treatment for them." 
</P>
<P>
When the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene was discovered it was "like 
Christmas" for Albert and Cindy Almada of Pomona and their three children. Four 
years ago, they learned that their oldest child, Christopher, then 4, had the 
disease and would probably not live beyond his teen-age years. 
</P>
<P>
The gene discovery gave the family hope that researchers would find a way to 
help Christopher and others stricken with the disease. But Albert, a dentist, 
and Cindy, a nurse, knew the discovery didn't mean that a cure was immediately 
at hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Being in science, my wife and I know that it takes a while for things to 
happen," Albert says. Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which strikes one in 3,500 
people, usually males, causes a gradual weakening of the muscles, including 
those in the heart and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Albert heard about animal research in which healthy cells were 
transferred to an animal with diseased muscle. He learned that doctors in San 
Francisco would soon test the procedure, called myoblast transfer, in humans. 
And, after several phone conversations with a researcher there, Albert was 
invited to enter Christopher, now 8, in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
The therapy will consist of injecting Albert's healthy cells into Christopher's 
muscles in the hope that the healthy cells will fuse with his son's and cause 
them to make a protein that is missing in muscular dystrophy patients. 
</P>
<P>
Because the therapy is experimental, father and son have spent the past year 
making frequent trips to San Francisco so doctors could test the compatibility 
of their tissues. Researchers also conducted tests to see if Christopher could 
tolerate the powerful medication needed for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Albert says Christopher remains a good candidate for the therapy, which they 
hope will begin in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The Almadas say they carefully weighed the risks of undertaking an experimental 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel my son is a guinea pig," Albert says. "We aren't sitting back. As 
long as there is no harm to my son, we want to be part of the cure, part of the 
breakthrough." 
</P>
<P>
For most genetic disorders, those patients most in need may be the last to 
benefit, researchers acknowledge. Experts usually predict that before a cure 
becomes available several other milestones will be reached, such as 
identification of carriers of the gene, identification of affected fetuses 
before birth, newborn screening and development of treatment to prolong life. 
</P>
<P>
Cure is a word that is still used with restraint among cystic fibrosis 
patients, says Dr. Robert J. Beall, executive vice president of medical affairs 
for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Since the discovery of the CF gene, for example, researchers have focused on 
the gene's normal function and what goes wrong. The hallmark of cystic 
fibrosis, the leading hereditary cause of death in whites, is excessive buildup 
of mucus in the respiratory and digestive tracts. Bacteria thrive in the mucus, 
causing infection while digestive imbalances cause poor nutrition. These 
problems usually result in the death of patients in their teens or 20s. 
</P>
<P>
"While gene therapy is a very exciting area, we have five to six other 
(treatments) with CF that will be going to clinical trials within the next 
year," he says. "In fact, some are already under way. So we're not putting all 
of our eggs in one basket. We have a very large spectrum of options available 
to (patients). Some will pan out, and we'll be able to keep these people alive 
for gene therapy." 
</P>
<P>
Optimism can vary among the newly diagnosed and those who have lived with a 
disorder for many years, says Prissi Shapiro, state coordinator for the 
National Neurofibromatosis Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis, which is commonly called by the misnomer 
Elephant Man's disease, affects one in every 3,500 people. The disorder causes 
symptoms ranging from skin discoloration to mental abnormalities to tumor 
growths around the body. The NF gene was discovered by Utah and Michigan 
researchers in July. 
</P>
<P>
"For parents, for them to know the gene has been found means that in their 
child's lifetime there may be a cure," Shapiro says. 
</P>
<P>
"For people who have the disease, it's much harder. It's what about me? I do 
get calls from people who say, 'OK, the gene has been found, what does that 
mean to me?' I tell them we're on the road in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro says it helps to remind patients and their families how far research 
has progressed. Just four years ago, she says, few people knew what 
neurofibromatosis was. Now, because of studies that show the NF gene belongs to 
a family of genes that suppresses tumor formation -- a significant aspect of 
cancer research -- interest among researchers has exploded. 
</P>
<P>
"Here was this disorder that no one had really taken a look at," Shapiro says. 
"In 1987, the genetic markers were found and in 1990 the gene was announced. 
So, for people who never had a hope, all of a sudden there was this 
excitement." 
</P>
<P>
Patients and their families do find solace in the rapid pace of research. 
</P>
<P>
Motenko, an accountant who lives in Mission Viejo, says he and his wife, 
Debbie, still cling to every bit of news from labs worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
When their daughter, Stacy, was born with an intestinal problem related to 
cystic fibrosis, Motenko checked out a library book on the disorder that turned 
out to be terribly outdated. The book listed the life expectancy of CF patients 
at three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy's doctor reassured the Motenkos that the outlook had improved, 
emphasizing that life spans can range into the 20s and that doctors are 
constantly learning more about reducing infections and improving the quality of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors were very compassionate," Motenko says. "But no one gave us much 
hope of a cure in my daughter's lifetime. That wasn't even talked about." 
</P>
<P>
With so much recent progress, and their loved ones demand frequent updates on 
genetic research. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to know what's happening in research," says Motenko, who also has a 
healthy older daughter, Lisa. "It gives me hope. And how can you keep going 
along without hope?" 
</P>
<P>
Physicians say it is common for families dealing with genetic illness to be 
highly knowledgeable about the disorder and the prospects for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"My sense is they do want to hear about what's going on," says Michigan's 
Collins, who also helped discover the gene for Von Recklinghausen 
neurofibromatosis. "I think they do want to hear about something that raises 
hopes." 
</P>
<P>
Harvard's Kunkel says he is sometimes bothered that such discoveries receive 
intense media coverage. He worries that patients' hopes will be unrealistically 
inflated. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much hype in the media that you think that a treatment is the next 
thing around the corner," he says. But he acknowledges that the publicity is 
good for morale and raising funds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good thing to anticipate a treatment or cure." 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Almadas are involved in research that could help their son as 
early as next year, they try not to let their hopes soar too high. They 
concentrate on daily challenges, such as helping Christopher, who can still 
move about with the aid of a walker, maintain what little muscle strength he 
has left. He undergoes frequent checkups at Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center, 
where many muscular dystrophy patients are treated. The hardest part, they say, 
is when Christopher asks his parents what the future holds for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell him they are working on (treatment) and it's important that we take 
each day at a time, and that we have to pray," Cindy says. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to be honest with him," Albert says. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes when they walk down halls at Rancho Los Amigos, Christopher sees 
children with muscular dystrophy who are in wheelchairs or on respirators. He 
knows how bad it can become, Albert says. 
</P>
<P>
"He says to me, 'Dad, I sure hope they find a cure.' " 
</P>

SOVIET EMIGRES MAKING OWN NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN HENDRIX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet emigres came out in force Sunday night to celebrate the 10th anniversary 
and 500th issue of Panorama, a Los Angeles-based, Russian-language weekly. More 
than honoring a newspaper, however, the ebullient crowd of 1,100 who packed 
Temple Beth El in West Hollywood seemed to be celebrating their own coming of 
age in America. 
</P>
<P>
It was a moment between the old and new countries and cultures. The buffet 
tables were so numerous and groaned with such an abundance of Russian salads 
and snacks that, in spite of the crowd, there was nothing remotely resembling a 
Soviet queue. 
</P>
<P>
The women wore everything from gold lame to casual pants and tops; the men 
ranged from tuxes or double breasted suits to unmatched jackets and trousers. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually everyone spoke Russian as they stood under clusters of colorful 
balloons and accepted sweet wine or Champagne from bartenders wearing berets, 
scarves, and T-shirts bearing the Panorama logo printed in Russian. 
</P>
<P>
Editor and publisher Alexander Polovets took to the stage with some of the 
paper's contributors and supporters, such as actor Ilya Baskin, columnist Si 
Frumkin and lawyer Boris Gorbis, to read greetings from President Bush, Vice 
President Quayle, Mayor Bradley, Governor-elect Pete Wilson and Gov. 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Testimonials and plaques were read and presented from the county, the city and 
the Jewish Federation Council of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
And then, on to a Russian language multimedia performance, most of it comedy or 
satire, relying heavily on reminders of the hardships of life in the old 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"Panorama is the one thing we can all be proud of," Gorbis said. 
</P>
<P>
Describing himself as Panorama's "first paid subscriber," Gorbis, who 
immigrated here in 1975, said: "There are things in the community that divide 
us. These are people who never wanted to be a community. They were suspicious 
of community. It meant connection to the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"That Panorama has become such a unifying force and voice in the Russian 
community is an incredible feat."

YOUR BODY: LAW AFFECTS WAYS DOCTORS ADVERTISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On business cards and in advertisements, physicians often boast their 
medical-board certification to demonstrate competency. But does that guarantee 
a well-trained doctor? 
</P>
<P>
Not necessarily. But sponsors of a new state law to restrict advertising of 
board affiliation say this latest legislation may help. 
</P>
<P>
While some specialty boards that took root outside the medical establishment 
have achieved mainstream legitimacy, others have been condemned by medical 
associations and license-enforcement agencies as "bogus," even "phony." 
</P>
<P>
The law signed by Gov. George Deukmejian in September is designed to prevent 
physicians from using the names of "illegitimate" boards to advertise. Under 
this so-called "truth-in-advertising" law (Senate Bill 2036), physicians and 
surgeons can state they are board-certified only if: 
</P>
<P>
* The board is recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties, an 
umbrella organization for 23 boards that certify physicians as specialists; 
</P>
<P>
* The board is approved by the Medical Board of California; 
</P>
<P>
* Or, the board has a residency program approved by the Accreditation Council 
of Graduate Medical Education, an organization that accredits medical residency 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Medical boards that fail to meet these criteria have until January, 1993, to 
comply with the law. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone praises this new law. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an anti-competitive bill," said Kimberly Davey, spokeswoman for the 
American Board of Cosmetic Surgery, an Arcadia-based organization that 
certifies doctors in cosmetic surgery and has not sought recognition from the 
American Board of Medical Specialties. 
</P>
<P>
"Plastic surgeons accredited by the American Board of Plastic Surgery 
(recognized by the ABMS) were trying desperately to prohibit physicians outside 
their organization from advertising their board certification in cosmetic 
surgery procedures." 
</P>
<P>
Even advocates of the new law say it is no panacea. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because a physician is board-certified (by the American Board of Medical 
Specialists) is no guarantee a patient will have an acceptable result," said 
Dr. Norman Leaf, a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon who is certified by the 
American Board of Plastic Surgery and the American Board of Surgery. 
</P>
<P>
And with the new law, patients must still take care in selecting specialists, 
said Leaf, a UCLA clinical assistant professor of plastic surgery. He suggests 
patients ask doctors if they are affiliated with a major teaching institution 
and if they have staff privileges at local community hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Doctor-shopping is another good idea, he added. "Go and meet the physician. See 
several doctors before deciding on one." 
</P>
<P>
Patients contemplating a specific cosmetic surgery procedure should ask the 
doctor how many such surgeries he or she has performed and what the results 
have been. 
</P>
<P>
"If a doctor is performing a particular surgery 100 or more times a year, it 
demonstrates a high level of experience," Davey said.

FALLOUT FROM THE MILLI VANILLI FIASCO; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: INSIDERS SEE THE DEBACLE PROMPTING A CLOSER LOOK BY ARTISTS AND 
RECORD COMPANIES AT THE CONTRACTS THEY SIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN and STEVE HOCHMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's less than a week after pop duo Milli Vanilli revealed that they did not 
sing on their Grammy-winning album or in their live appearances, but 
repercussions from the hoax are already beginning to be felt throughout the 
music industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Grammy, for best new artist of 1989, was revoked Monday by the National 
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, an Oakland woman has sued the group for 
fraud and legislators are proposing to outlaw undisclosed lip-syncing. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, according to music industry executives interviewed for this 
story, the Milli Vanilli debacle -- whether or not the deception is as serious 
as critics contend -- will prompt record companies and artists to look more 
carefully at the contracts they sign and at the protections required before an 
artist is signed with a label. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a consumer fraud issue," said Thomas A. White, a music 
industry consultant who specializes in fraud and ethical issues. "I think 
people have been misled into believing that the images that they've responded 
to are the talents that appear on the recording. I think a damage issue is 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
White said that legal responses to the Milli Vanilli hoax could include a 
recall of their albums, states' attorneys investigations and legislation that 
would require full disclosure regarding recorded and live performances. 
</P>
<P>
And the misrepresentations by producer Frank Farian and purported singers 
Robert (Rob) Pilatus and Fabrice (Fab) Morvan could lead to changes in standard 
recording contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Today's standard contract, said entertainment attorney Michael Rosenfeld, does 
not contain a specific clause which requires the artist to ensure that the 
material presented is actually the work of that artist. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing," Rosenfeld said, while looking through a number of current 
contracts, "But I don't see anything that makes a representation that what the 
artist delivers embodies the artist's performance and only the artist's 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
The clause may have been left out because record companies believed that the 
idea was covered implicitly in clauses that involve assigning rights to the 
artist's work to the label, Rosenfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it's a 'loophole' but it might be added in the future," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Al Cafaro, vice president and general manager of Los Angeles-based A&amp;M 
Records, said that the addition of such a clause would diminish the lack of 
control record companies have when they make deals with producers rather than 
directly with artists, as was the case with Farian and Arista Records. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't honestly say at this time that we are protected contractually," 
Cafaro said. "If we're going to do a production deal it would behoove us to 
make sure that what we're getting and marketing is consistent with what's 
behind the music. I think it would be appropriate to pursue a legal safeguard." 
</P>
<P>
Assurances that the artist performing is indeed the artist on the album cover 
would protect not only record companies, but also the singers and 
instrumentalists whose work appears -- uncredited and not remunerated -- on the 
album, according to attorney Steven Ames Brown. 
</P>
<P>
A&amp;M is currently being sued by Brown's client, singer Martha Wash, formerly 
of the group, the Weather Girls, who alleges that her vocals were improperly 
used on a song by the group Seduction. 
</P>
<P>
"She went in to cut a Martha Wash record, and (the producers) simply stole it," 
Brown said. "Martha has a suit (to get) A&amp;M to pay her for the copyright." 
</P>
<P>
Wash has a filed a similar suit against RCA Records in connection with the 
group, Black Box. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lawsuit filed by Sheila Stalder in Alameda County Superior Court 
asking for refunds of the purchase prices of the album, compact disc, tapes and 
videotapes to consumers, most experts interviewed agreed that it would be 
easier to rewrite contracts to protect record companies and "ghost singers" 
than it would be to help consumers. But White, Brown and others are pushing for 
disclosure laws similar to those regulating the sale of other consumer 
products. Legislators in both California and New Jersey have already sponsored 
bills requiring concert promoters to inform the public if a performance will 
involve taped backing tracks or lip-syncing. 
</P>
<P>
"We want adequate disclosure in pharmaceutical, children's products, and car 
safety," White said. "We want it in all kinds of products and there is no 
reason we should not have it in (music) products. If someone is producing a 
sham, let the consumer know it and if he still wants to buy it, fine." 
</P>
<P>
Legal ramifications aside, however, it could be that the momentum to change 
industry practices in the wake of the Milli Vanilli fiasco may come from 
something much more personal: embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely think it's an embarrassment," said Hale Milgrim, president of 
Capitol Records. "It sort of proves that anything can happen in this 
marketing-oriented world we live in. Anything can be sold." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the problem, according to some, is the emphasis on image that goes 
along with today's video-driven pop music world. 
</P>
<P>
But MTV, the music television service that has borne the brunt of such 
criticism, reacted sharply. 
</P>
<P>
"That's an absurd premise," said Abbey Konowitch, MTV's senior vice president 
of music and talent. "It's the record companies' job to be honest with the 
consumers and not mislead them by having artists lip-syncing performances that 
aren't their own." 
</P>
<P>
Will MTV monitor new videos? 
</P>
<P>
"We're not the music credential police," he said.

BUILDING CONTROVERSY OVER NC-17; 
</P>
<P>
MPAA OPPOSES ATTEMPT TO TURN THE NEW GUIDELINE ON ADULT FARE INTO LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Kissimmee, Fla., the city commission tonight will consider making the new 
NC-17 movie rating a part of the community's already tough restrictions on 
adult entertainment, and forbidding children from attending adult-rated movies 
under any circumstances . 
</P>
<P>
But the Motion Picture Assn. of America, which administers the movie ratings, 
isn't happy about the prospect. While the MPAA says it shares the goals of 
advising parents on guidelines for movies, it doesn't cotton to having its 
voluntary -- and copyrighted -- rating system written into anyone's law. 
</P>
<P>
The Kissimmee vote is only the latest in a growing number of problems and 
challenges the MPAA has encountered since September when it introduced NC-17 -- 
meaning no children admitted under age 17. The rating replaced the 
much-maligned, porn-tainted X category. 
</P>
<P>
In Kissimmee, a community of 30,000 not far from Walt Disney World and 
Universal Tours Florida, the operators of the city's three movie theaters 
already have given the city commissioners their assurances that they will not 
show NC-17-rated fare, let alone sexually explicit movies. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was a perceived need for revising the city's restrictions on adult 
entertainment among three of the five city commissioners and support from 
spectators at last week's meeting when the ordinance was first introduced. "We 
had a houseful of people for something I thought was a simple thing," said 
Richard Herring, one of the commissioners who supports a change. 
</P>
<P>
"There was standing-room only," said Mayor John Pollet, who opposes the 
ordinance, "but it came from a lot of Southern Baptists who want to restrict it 
(movie going)." 
</P>
<P>
Like many communities, Kissimmee already has restrictions on adult 
entertainment. Herring and his allies want to add the phrase "NC-17" to the 
law, which currently prohibits sexually explicit movies from being shown to 
children unaccompanied by adults. The change also would make the person who 
sells the ticket the responsible party. And since NC-17 means no children under 
17 without exception, Herring said that the addition of a specific rating to 
the city's law would prohibit children from attending -- with or without an 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew what 'X' was," explained Herring. "So now the movie industry changed 
the terminology, so we're updating the terminology in our ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
Herring said he saw MPAA President Jack Valenti on TV and, "took Mr. Valenti at 
his word . . . that NC-17 is purely adult entertainment. He looked like a 
grandfather to me. Very smiley. And I said, 'Gee, gramps, we'll take you up on 
that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pollet, however, sees the change as pointless. "We haven't had an X-rated 
movie as far back as I can remember. . . . If we go too far, we start 
legislating morals. And that's not our job." 
</P>
<P>
To date, 12 movies have been given NC-17 tags -- ranging from the critically 
praised "Henry &amp; June," distributed by mainstream Hollywood studio 
Universal Pictures, to such independently distributed, sexually explicit movies 
as "Centerspread," "Midnight Woman" and "Blonde Emanuelle in 3-D." 
</P>
<P>
Next week, the Los Angeles based distributor of "Blonde Emanuelle in 3-D" will 
screen the uncut, version -- formerly known as "Disco Dolls in Hot Skin in 3-D" 
-- for the MPAA's ratings board. Parliament Films President John Parker said 
the uncut version, which features former Penthouse magazine centerfold Serena 
in the title role, is sure to receive an NC-17. "The way I see it, there's no 
other option for the MPAA." 
</P>
<P>
The NC-17 doesn't bother Parker, however. He feels that the MPAA label will 
give his movie more of an entree into certain theaters around the country and 
some video stores, than the old X-rating would. 
</P>
<P>
But it's exactly this kind of example that has given rise to a variety of 
anti-NC-17 feelings. One leading film critic -- Janet Maslin of the New York 
Times -- questioned the very purpose of the new rating. "The new NC-17 rating 
has already been recognized as little more than a new way to spell X," Maslin 
charged in a recent column. 
</P>
<P>
On that point, Maslin is in agreement with two town councilmen in the Boston 
suburb of Dedham, where their objections in October persuaded a local theater 
to pull its booking of the first NC-17-rated movie, "Henry &amp; June," before 
it even opened. They complained, in effect, that, "an X by any other name is 
still an X." 
</P>
<P>
Only a week ago, a Dallas-Ft. Worth chapter of the American Family Assn. 
announced that it would have its 2,600 members call local theaters to urge them 
not to show NC-17 movies. And just after the new rating was announced, the 
National Council of Churches and the U.S. Catholic Conference issued a 
statement opposing the rating on the basis that it would make movies that 
otherwise would have been X-rated appear more acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Amid these complaints, Valenti last week admitted, "there probably is some 
confusion in the public's view" of the adults-only NC-17 rating." But he 
predicted, "Over time it will work out just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Valenti said that the MPAA soon would embark on an education program through 
the media to remind the public of the intent of the ratings and the definitions 
of the categories -- G, PG, PG-13, R and NC-17 -- which advise parents on 
suitability of movies for children. 
</P>
<P>
Valenti said the information campaign will attempt to persuade local 
politicians, parents groups and religious organizations that a voluntary rating 
system works best to protect free expression and free enterprise, while at the 
same helping parents to safeguard the interests of children. 
</P>
<P>
In the two months since NC-17 replaced the X, Valenti said, "Only one (studio) 
film has gone into the (national) marketplace ("Henry &amp; June") with the 
NC-17 rating. . . the hard porn stuff is not going into the theaters. Oh, there 
may be some NC-17 movies, eventually, that are tough, and they may play in, 
say, 15 theaters out of the 27,000 (nationwide)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But the hard porn movie business is virtually extinct." 
</P>
<P>
He said that most of the films applying for NC-17 are going into the home-video 
market. "When you can get a (sexually explicit) video for home," Valenti added, 
"why would you want to go into town and join the raincoat crowd in some seedy 
movie theater?" 
</P>
<P>
One of the chief reasons why the MPAA dropped the X rating was to avoid the 
porn stigma that was attached to it. Most movie theater chains have policies to 
not show X-rated fare and most publications refuse advertising, leaving 
filmmakers with serious adult-themed movies that received X ratings, mostly out 
in the cold when it came to marketing their movies. 
</P>
<P>
Since the ratings system was introduced in 1968, Valenti said, "The X was 
absconded by nasty, dirty, filthy pictures. There was a time when X ratings 
were applied to such fine adult movies as 'Midnight Cowboy' and 'A Clockwork 
Orange.' " 
</P>
<P>
But unlike the other MPAA rating symbols, the X was never copyrighted. 
</P>
<P>
Valenti acknowledged earlier criticism from some filmmakers who wanted the MPAA 
to introduce a new category for "adults," in addition to the X. "Some people 
think you should try to make a distinction between hard core and non-hard core. 
But that's not something the ratings board should do. Our attorneys advise me 
that we can't make a quality judgment and then be able to defend it in court." 
</P>
<P>
The decision should be made in the marketplace, Valenti said. "Movie exhibitors 
make this distinction all the time. A theater owner asks himself: 'Is this a 
picture I want to play in my theater?' Once you book an NC-17, you knock out 
30% of your business," Valenti estimated. "All we're trying to say with this 
rating is the NC-17 simply means it is an adult film." 
</P>
<P>
Film critic Gene Siskel, who with partner Roger Ebert had advocated an "adult" 
rating on their television program, believes the change from X to NC-17 is a 
"potential improvement. "It will work if it's used, since there won't be as 
much pressure for filmmakers to cut a picture to an R rating." He predicted 
that fewer than three films a year from the major studios will even be rated 
NC-17 during 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the public has focused on the new rating yet," said Blockbuster 
Video's Ron Castell, senior vice president of programming and merchandising. He 
noted that, so far, there's no video product out carrying the NC-17. 
</P>
<P>
"The Debbie-doing-Dallas type of movies -- we've never carried them and we 
never will," Castell said. As for the NC-17 rating, Castell said the 
Florida-based national retailer "will decide on a case-by-case basis on whether 
to stock films." 
</P>
<P>
The same holds true for Los Angeles-based Wherehouse Entertainment. Bruce 
Jesse, vice president of advertising and sales promotion, said the rating will 
help his company in categorizing films. "But we do not say we will carry each 
and every NC-17 rating that comes out." 
</P>
<P>
If the NC-17 issue isn't causing enough problems, the MPAA is also acting as 
watchdog in an estimated 350 cases on the state and local levels across the 
country in which laws are pending to regulate the depiction of violence on 
screen and impose community standards on the movie business. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always a lot of activity in an election year, and lately we have seen 
a move to the right," said the MPAA's legislative counsel Gail Markels. "There 
are a lot of groups out there that are only too willing to tell people what 
they can or cannot see." 
</P>
<P>
The case in Kissimmee, Fla., is somewhat different, however. City officials 
there are trying to write the MPAA ratings into the local law. Markels said the 
MPAA opposes that as strongly as it opposes content regulations, because the 
ratings are predicated on being a voluntary system. "The minute you write it 
into law, it ceases to be voluntary." 
</P>
<P>
Markels, who attended the Kisimmee commission meeting last week, said "the 
ratings are not a legal determination. They are intended as a voluntary guide. 
A (local government) can't delegate the decision of what people can or cannot 
see to a private organization like the MPAA."

NBC PULLS AIDS-THEMED 'LIFESTORIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NBC has pulled from the prime-time schedule an episode of the innovative 
medical drama "Lifestories" that deals with AIDS and replaced it with an 
episode about bone marrow transplants. 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS episode, which centers around a gay television news reporter who tests 
positive for the HIV antibodies and then sees his lover die of AIDS, had been 
scheduled to air Dec. 2, the day following World AIDS Day, and NBC publicists 
had sent tapes of the episode to the media to drum up publicity. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' will air an episode of "The Hogan Family" that deals with AIDS and ABC is 
planning a late-night entertainment special centered on the topic that same 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm upset and terribly disappointed," Jeffrey Lewis, the series' creator and 
executive producer, said in an interview Monday. 
</P>
<P>
NBC executives could not immediately be reached for comment Monday. NBC 
Entertainment Group chairman Brandon Tartikoff, who has been an ardent champion 
of the series since its inception, had said recently that the low-rated series 
would be given a tryout in different time periods during December. 
</P>
<P>
"They must think that this is the kind of show that will get us in trouble," 
said Lewis, who had not received an explanation from network executives about 
why they had pulled the episode. "But the show is already in trouble. This is 
the kind of episode that might make an impact for our series. It will show 
everyone that we are serious about putting out work that has strong moral and 
artistic merit. And it is inconceivable to me how anyone would want to put a 
serious medical show on the air and then not want to deal with AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said that he did not know if NBC, which he said had approved the script 
for the episode without reservations, had been experiencing trouble with 
advertisers over it. Last summer, ABC decided not to repeat a "thirtysomething" 
episode that showed two gay men talking in bed together because it had had 
trouble selling commercials on the program the first time it was broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
The "Lifestories" AIDS episode does not include any depiction of sex, focusing 
instead on medical information about AIDS and the TV station's reaction to the 
reporter's series of on-air reports about AIDS, HIV and his personal 
experiences.

CRITIC AT LARGE: THAT'S A WRAP: END OF MGM/UA THAT WAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The transmogrification of the old Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is, as it turns out, the 
end not of one era but of two. The purchase of the MGM/UA Communications Co. by 
Pathe Communications Corp., completed at the start of November, is the last 
cutting of the cord to the MGM that was. The new logo will be MGM-Pathe. And at 
the same time the UA logo will disappear into history after 71 memorable years. 
</P>
<P>
By present plan, "Rocky V," just being released, and the next (and probably 
final) James Bond film will be the last to carry the United Artists label. 
</P>
<P>
The great MGM lot that Louis B. Mayer built is now the home of Columbia, a 
Japanese corporation. From somewhere up in the clouds, Louis B. Mayer and his 
arch-rival, Columbia's Harry Cohn, must both be gazing down with extremely 
mixed emotions at what Mammon hath wrought. 
</P>
<P>
From adjoining clouds Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and D. 
W. Griffith could look down with equally mixed emotions. The four of them had 
founded United Artists in 1919 with the thought that they would enjoy a good 
deal more creative freedom -- and very likely more money -- if they made and 
distributed their own films. 
</P>
<P>
In the silent era, the company did well, releasing films by the founders and by 
others as well, including Buster Keaton. For a while in the '30s UA also 
released the films of Sam Goldwyn and Alexander Korda. 
</P>
<P>
But there were problems. Mary and Doug, America's sweethearts, ceased to be 
such. D. W. Griffith, ill and out of favor in a changed Hollywood, could no 
longer work. In later years, Pickford and Chaplin did not speak at all. As the 
'50s began and television was making its heavy inroads in Hollywood, UA was 
virtually moribund. Pickford wanted to sell; Chaplin resisted; Mary won. 
</P>
<P>
New owners, led by Robert Benjamin and Arthur Krim, took over from the founders 
in 1951 and led UA into a golden era that lasted just over a quarter-century. 
The company had no production facilities, which once seemed a handicap but 
which, in the post-television era of independent production, suddenly became a 
virtue. Under David Picker and subsequent production executives, UA's operating 
philosophy of approving a project, providing the money and then leaving the 
filmmakers alone was almost unique in the industry. It paid off. 
</P>
<P>
UA had a smashing hit in Tony Richardson's sexy, witty period romp, "Tom Jones" 
(1963). It had the lucky foresight to finance the Harry Saltzman-Cubby Broccoli 
production of Ian Fleming's "Dr. No," which in 1962 introduced Sean Connery as 
James Bond 007 to a waiting world, thus begetting a hugely profitable series 
whose end is not yet. 
</P>
<P>
The hands-off policy at UA attracted Woody Allen, whose unique contracts with 
the company allowed for two week at least of reshooting if Allen wanted it. The 
association began with "What's New, Pussycat" in 1965, which Allen wrote but 
did not direct. 
</P>
<P>
An impressive string of commercial and critical successes began to bear the UA 
label. There was an Oscar for best picture for "In the Heat of the Night" in 
1967, another for "Midnight Cowboy" in 1969. There were best picture Oscars for 
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Rocky" and "Annie Hall" in successive 
years, 1975-77, and a nomination the next year for "Coming Home." 
</P>
<P>
Then in the late '70s, Transamerica Corp. bought control of UA. The 
conglomerate was more accustomed to dealing with insurance policies than with 
creative artists, and at the start of 1978 the UA leadership departed en masse 
in rebellion against head office interference. They formed Orion Pictures. 
Woody Allen, significantly, also left to go with Orion. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest news out of UA in its Transamerica period was the horrendous 
cost-overrun on Michael Cimino's "Heaven's Gate," a $48-million loss from which 
UA as an independent entity never really recovered. Acquired by Kerkorian as an 
MGM hyphenate, MGM/UA has continued to release the James Bond films and the 
Robert Chartoff-Irwin Winkler "Rocky" productions. 
</P>
<P>
In the '80s, the UA or MGM/UA output grew thinner and thinner, and yet the firm 
released Martin Scorsese's "Raging Bull" (produced by Chartoff and Winkler) and 
the Oscar-winning "Rain Man." 
</P>
<P>
The decline and demise of a studio, or a production company like UA, is very 
much like the death of a magazine or a newspaper. It is the silencing of a 
voice, the loss of an option available to the writer or the filmmaker with an 
idea and a passion to see it made, a diminishing of choices and variety within 
the whole output of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
It means a dozen or more films a year that won't get made, any one of which 
might have turned out to be something special. 
</P>
<P>
The voice of a studio, like the voice of a publication, may sometimes have been 
foolish, superficial, shrill, cynical or any one of a number of other things a 
voice can be. But it may also have had its moments of greatness, when it rose 
above the mundane and created something of lasting worth and importance. 
</P>
<P>
Film history would be significantly poorer without the UA legacy, from its 
formative silent days, more particularly from its great period between the '50s 
and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
It made films -- I think immediately of Bob Fosse's "Lenny," with Dustin 
Hoffman -- that might not have found a home elsewhere in the industry. In 1974, 
a film about the controversial comedian Lenny Bruce was a bold commercial 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
With the notable exception of "Annie Hall," Woody Allen's films have been only 
narrowly profitable, a special urban taste almost unmarketable in some parts of 
the country. But the pre-Orion UA was a firmly supportive if occasionally 
nervous patron for him. And by now the Allen films constitute a body of work 
unique in its ever more aspiring creative intentions. 
</P>
<P>
There were UA flops; there always are, it being impossible to repeal the law of 
averages or unvaryingly second-guess the audience. But it is always the 
successes one looks to. The lesson of UA's hands-off regard for its filmmakers 
has not been lost, surviving at Orion and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Still, you watch with melancholy as the UA logo fades from the scene. In its 
various guises it has spanned three quarters of the life of American movies. 
Its best days had come and gone, but it leaves memories that will be a good 
deal slower to fade.

One of China's so-called "Special Economic Zones" -- Shenzhen, located next to

starting next Monday.

<P>
The commemoration is expected to highlight the zone's rapid growth and to 
promote its image for potential investors. Coming in the midst of private 
debates within the Chinese government over the pace and direction of economic 
reforms, the celebrations appear aimed at defending those gains already made 
and promoting the case for further change.

TORIES' TORMENT: WHAT TO DO WITH THATCHER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flamboyant former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine's challenge to Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher for leadership of the Conservative Party has caused 
a political sensation in Britain. A crucial first vote of Tory Members of 
Parliament (MPs) is scheduled for today, and if Heseltine should wrest control 
of the party from Thatcher -- the longest-serving British head of government in 
modern times -- she would also have to give up the prime minister's job that 
she has held since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a sampling of editorial comment on the contest that has stirred 
Britain: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Thatcher era in British politics is almost over. . . . It is more likely 
than not that she is finished altogether. The coup de grace may not be 
delivered at this moment. The nature of the era that comes afterward is far 
from clear. But as a political force, she is condemned at best to an 
unrelenting rear-guard action which will end sometime in a humiliating abyss. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"The party may sullenly support her now, but they will ask the question again 
in the spring, knowing that if they do not do so the country will ask the same 
question even more pitilessly when the general election comes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"An alternative, however, stares her in the face. . . . It is to acknowledge 
that an era has passed, and preserve its achievements by standing down, 
releasing her lieutenants and urging her party, in the interests of a vanished 
unity, to support Mr. (Foreign Minister Douglas) Hurd." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Thatcher biographer Hugo Young in The Guardian 
</P>
<P>
"The contest for the leadership of the Conservative party . . . should not be 
occurring. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It would be foolish to deny that, today, the prime minister is politically 
beleaguered as never before. . . . But the task of the Conservative party, in 
the year and more that remains before the next general election, must be to 
rally to enable Mrs. Thatcher to rebuild her personal position, and give her 
the confidence and support to win the fourth term she deserves." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Daily Telegraph 
</P>
<P>
"Who could have guessed . . . from watching the prime minister answer questions 
in the Commons that she was fighting for her life? She was as brisk and 
well-briefed as ever. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Bloodied Margaret Thatcher may be. Bowed she most certainly is not." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Daily Mail 
</P>
<P>
"British Conservative MPs must be prepared to reject Mrs. Thatcher when they 
vote in the party's leadership election. . . . It is no longer in the interests 
of the United Kingdom, which are now inextricably linked with the development 
of a strong and united Europe, for her to remain in office. 
</P>
<P>
"The European derives no satisfaction from reaching this conclusion. Apart from 
her domestic achievements in reviving the British economy in the 1980s, Mrs. 
Thatcher has contributed much more to the development of the European Community 
than she is often given credit for. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But The European believes that her nightmare vision of Europe, of 
ill-intentioned people trying to destroy democracy, is not shared by most of 
the British people. They reject her view that pooling of sovereignty is no 
different from surrender. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The Conservative Party faces a stark choice. Either it will reelect Mrs. 
Thatcher and see the United Kingdom slip into isolation as it is left behind 
the rest of the Community. Or it can choose a new leader who is prepared to 
participate genuinely in the argument about economic and political union." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The European 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 "A prime minister in total command for 11 years could not be unseated, and 
cherished policies abandoned, without an explosion within the party. It would 
take a Solomon to heal the divisions and prevent civil war. Frankly, we cannot 
see Mr. Heseltine in that role. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sun also deeply questions his ability to be a successful or even adequate 
prime minister. . . . This is the man who for the past five years has professed 
loyalty to the government and yet has been its most divisive force. We discern 
just one constant loyalty -- and that is to Michael Heseltine." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Sun 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Thatcher deserves better than to be dismissed in the shoddy and demeaning 
manner some Tory MPs are minded to have in store for her. To be defeated by the 
people in a general election, as was Winston Churchill in 1945, that was an 
honorable rejection. To be brought down by a vote of censure in the House of 
Commons, as was Neville Chamberlain in 1940 -- even that was a constitutionally 
respectable form of political demise. But what they are proposing to do to Mrs. 
Thatcher, unquestionably the greatest peacetime prime minister of this century, 
is quite simply unworthy. Her fate could be sealed, if her opponents have their 
way, behind closed doors in smoke-filled rooms. . . . Persons of quality were 
always accorded the dignity of execution by ax or firing squad, rather than the 
humiliation of hanging. These plotters would like to dispatch Mrs. Thatcher, 
who almost single-handedly has won three elections, by the political equivalent 
of the rope. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"You can find Heseltines wherever you go. But there is only one Mrs. Thatcher. 
Handle with care. This valuable object is irreplaceable." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Sunday Telegraph 
</P>
<P>
"This newspaper has long maintained that the best result in the next general 
election would be for Margaret Thatcher to lead the Tories to a fourth victory. 
Sadly, the course of events has conspired to make that unlikely. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The British have never liked Margaret Thatcher; but as long as she delivered 
the goods they respected her, and voted for her. When her government fails (as 
it has recently), that lack of affection turns to growing resentment. For 
reasons that are probably unfair and undeserved, Mrs. Thatcher is now a victim 
of that strongest public mood of all: time for a change. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Thatcher is right to feel bitter that a prime minister with her track 
record and prestige can be so easily challenged. If she goes, the manner of her 
ousting will leave much to be desired; no other party could so lightly dispose 
of its leader in government, this side of an election, largely for reasons of 
unpopularity. But the Tories have a nose for survival in power unmatched by any 
other party in the democratic world, and politics is an unforgiving business. 
The issue before Tory MPs . . . is not the reelection of Margaret Thatcher, it 
is the defeat of (opposition Labor Party leader) Neil Kinnock. That requires 
saying a reluctant goodby to Mrs. Thatcher, and the endorsement of Michael 
Heseltine."

There is probably no public activity in the Holy Land, barring perhaps 
religious and communal strife, older than the gentle autumn harvest of olives.

To hike into the stone-laden valleys and to clamber over the worn terraces to 
pick the ripening fruit is to travel to an elemental age. Yet, there are 
details that break the trance. On a recent afternoon in the groves near this 
ridge-top village, F-16 jets of Israel's air force screamed overhead. A boom 
box blared news of Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
But imagine that the jets are arrows and Hussein is the ancient Babylonian king 
Nebuchadnezzar -- he himself is said to imagine so -- and focus again on the 
core rhythm of the harvest. It seems to beat much the same as it did thousands 
of years ago when the Bible said this was a land "of wheat and barley and vines 
and fig trees and pomegranates; a land of olive oil and honey." For a few hours 
at least, there is a partial release from the compression of violence that 
dominates news from the lives of Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
As in many contemporary scenes of rustic charm, it is deprivation that gives 
the olive harvest beauty. The Palestinian population of the West Bank is 
sufficiently hard-pressed to continue the Mediterranean chore of picking olives 
in the old-fashioned way. Unlike wealthy Italy, for example, no chemicals are 
sprayed to encourage the olives to fall here; no fork-tongued machines grab and 
shake the twisted trees to loosen stubborn fruit. No waves of migrant workers 
are imported to do the picking, for the Palestinians themselves are migrant 
laborers in large numbers -- in the fields and factories of prosperous Israel, 
and in the offices and plants of oil-rich states in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Families harvest on plots too small to produce more than side income. They 
come, young and old, girls in jeans and aunts in long, black, embroidered 
peasant dresses, boys in UCLA sweatshirts and their fathers in checkered-cloth 
headdresses, to pass the day on and under the trees, alternately reaching and 
stooping, picking and sorting, sipping tea and, at midday, eating in the shade. 
</P>
<P>
So last month, when the Israeli government forbade Arabs from the West Bank 
from entering Israel to work in order to ensure a break in the whirl of civil 
violence that threatened to spin out of control, the timing was not bad. No one 
sat at home moping about lost income. Hands were in demand all across the West 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome. A hundred welcomes!" Hajeh, a graying grandmother in Husan shouted to 
an arriving visitor and two nephews who, having been turned back by soldiers on 
their way to Jerusalem, were available to start picking. 
</P>
<P>
Hajeh, her cousin Rima and Rima's family had left their hilltop house early. 
They were planning not only to pick from their own rows of 10 trees, but also 
from groves owned by other relatives who hold steady jobs and cannot pick the 
olives themselves. In return, they will receive half the harvest and perhaps 
make $300 for three weeks' work, plus a two-year supply of oil for their own 
use. 
</P>
<P>
It's not much, considering that anywhere from four to 10 family members are 
involved in the picking. A single worker hauling bricks in Jerusalem can make 
$15 a day. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, olive income will supplement earnings from a hodgepodge of 
sources: the father and three of the young men in the family work as house 
painters; another son is working in Saudi Arabia; a fifth studies in the Soviet 
Union, and two others are in local schools. 
</P>
<P>
The family network of jobs has been shredded by local rebellion and foreign 
politics. Frequent strikes called by leaders of the Arab uprising interfere 
with the building trade. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the sons, Abed and Basal, both in their 20s, spent four months in jail 
and then, for six months, were forbidden to enter Israel. The military 
government of the territories issues orange identification card covers to 
quickly pinpoint those who have been jailed for stone-throwing or other 
anti-Israeli activity. Palestinians can retrieve the regular green cover only 
by staying out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Majid, the son in Saudi Arabia, held a good-paying job working in a Riyadh 
storeroom until Iraq invaded Kuwait three months ago. But then widespread 
Palestinian support for Saddam Hussein prompted a Saudi backlash, and Majid's 
boss fired him. He found another job, but at lower wages, in another warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can say it doesn't hurt when Israel cuts us from working or we go on 
strike," said Nimer, the oldest son. "There are simply not enough jobs in the 
West Bank to keep us busy." 
</P>
<P>
In these autumn days, the sun, appearing offended by the skimpy rain clouds 
just now gathering, has lost its usual vigorous shine. The paler light softens 
further the already dull green of the olive trees and of the scrubby bushes 
that push out everywhere from the flinty rock, so that the valleys sometimes 
seem to be in a perpetual dawn. 
</P>
<P>
The harvest begins with the laying of mats around the base of the trees to 
catch the falling olives. The pitter-patter of the fruit as it lands on the 
burlap and plastic sheets is the most characteristic sound of the picking, 
along with the whistle and bleat of pack donkeys and the songs that from time 
to time burst from the lips of the women or young men. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," continued Nimer, "if the Jews want to keep us out of Israel 
forever, fine, if we get a state. For that, the sacrifice would be worth it." 
</P>
<P>
In villages like Husan, the struggle over who owns the land is described as a 
battle between Arab and Jew, not Palestinian and Israeli. 
</P>
<P>
Nimer, 33, reconsidered as he reached up from a ladder's height to the farthest 
olives. "Even with a state, we would probably have to go back to Israel to work 
because, really, there is no economy over here." 
</P>
<P>
He pulled down on the branches, massaging off the strands of olives with a 
milking motion. In some places, harvesters whack the olives to the ground with 
sticks, but that bruises the fruit and randomly knocks off branches, which take 
a long time to grow back. 
</P>
<P>
The sorting -- fat olives to eat, skinny olives to press into oil -- gives time 
for gossip. Marriage and births or lack of births -- "Why doesn't Noor have any 
children, do you suppose?" -- are hot topics. 
</P>
<P>
Courting can go on in proper view of relatives but with the minor privacy 
offered by the foliage. Basal, the former prisoner, arranged himself shyly atop 
a tree to pick opposite his fiancee, Fatma. When their conversation descended 
to a whisper, Khaled, a high school student, launched a well-aimed olive to 
break the spell and two old women began a song about a wedding dress and a 
young groom. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmed, the father, arrived leading a goat. The animal was meant to feast on 
broken twigs, although with customary contrariness, he preferred to leap up on 
the bark and help himself to leaves growing low on the tree. 
</P>
<P>
The goat appeared to be a pet, but it was nameless. 
</P>
<P>
"Why give it a name if you're going to eat it?" explained Ahmed, who at 52 has 
lost most of his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
The idyll is broken by the excited arrival of Farres, a friend of Khaled's. 
Groups of youths threw stones at an army patrol in nearby Hader; the soldiers 
fired tear gas. There is trouble also in Bethlehem, where soldiers chased 
someone through the open-air market. Abed sent word that he wouldn't come home 
until the uproar was over. 
</P>
<P>
"He can't afford to get caught in a roundup," Nimer explained. "They will throw 
him in jail again." 
</P>
<P>
The talk turned to personal experiences in the intifada. An old woman recalled 
a raid on her house, with young stone-throwers scurrying out the back and 
soldiers running in through the front. In the hubbub, someone stole a pair of 
gold earrings. 
</P>
<P>
Khaled boasted of the minor bullet wound in the leg as he was running from 
soldiers on the same day that a young man from Husan was killed. His mother, 
Rima, sighed and rolled her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Lunch came in a big pot. It was dumped onto a platter, revealing yellow rice 
and chicken, a dish called maklube or -- appropriately enough -- "upside-down." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone sat on the mats and ate with spoons. Nimer talked about emigrating to 
the United States where a cousin earns $48,000 a year making neon signs. Ahmed 
slowly ate a hard-boiled egg and remembered harder times when eggs were never 
eaten but sold in the market in Bethlehem. Basal and Fatma sat apart. Mother 
Rima reclined and put her head on Khaled's lap. 
</P>
<P>
The family's youngest son, Riyad, 12, arrived with more news of tear gas in 
Hader and everyone wondered where Abed was. 
</P>
<P>
A radio nearby reported that an Israeli soldier who, with two others, beat to 
death a Palestinian in their custody two years ago was sentenced to two months 
in prison. Then Police Minister Ronni Milo came on, explaining why Palestinians 
are being barred from their work in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"The closing of the transit points for workers is a message to those murderers 
and those who think they can do things without a response," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmed urged everyone back to work because the sun was going down and the wind 
was whipping up. Abed arrived to pick his share and said no one had been hurt 
in Bethlehem. 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome. One hundred welcomes," shouted Hajeh. 
</P>
<P>
The radio was turned off and Khaled began a song: 
</P>
<P>
 The olives of my land are very beautiful, 
</P>
<P>
 the olives and nuts of my land. 
</P>
<P>
 And the mint, and don't forget the spices. 
</P>
<P>
 When the omelet is ready, how good it tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 With olive oil, 
</P>
<P>
 bread and soft cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of food that makes us forget the cold of December. 
</P>
<P>
Khaled stopped and his mother joked that he sings so that everyone will forget 
that he doesn't like to work. Soon, only the sound of falling olives broke the 
silence of approaching night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
California and the Olive 
</P>
<P>
California accounts for most of the olive production in the United States, 
primarily in Tulare, Tehama, Kern, Glenn and Madera counties. 
</P>
<P>
While there are olive trees in Israelthat probably date back to the beginning 
of the Christian era, the olive didn't arrive in California until the 18th 
Century, brought here from their Mediterranean homeland by Franciscan monks and 
planted lovingly at the various missions they founded. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the so-called California olive -- large, smooth-coated and black or 
green -- dominates the $300 million-a-year U.S. olive industry. 
</P>
<P>
So where is the nation's olive capital? Livermore, east of Oakland, claims that 
title. But so does Lindsay, east of Tulare. 
</P>
<P>
Take your pick.

A RAUCOUS CHURCH-STATE DEBATE OVER ARTIFICIAL BIRTH CONTROL PLAGUES A NEW 
PRESIDENT.

<P>
"A Sector of the Church Takes a Medieval and Recalcitrant Position." Displayed 
in bold headlines, those were fighting words from President Alberto Fujimori. 
</P>
<P>
"Medieval is when medicines do not reach the sick," responded Roman Catholic 
Bishop Luis Bambaren, rising to the challenge and making more headlines. 
</P>
<P>
It's all part of a dispute between church and state over birth control here, 
and it has been big news in Peruvian newspapers and magazines. It has also 
shown how press coverage of flaring tension between major power centers in an 
impoverished Latin American country can focus public attention on important 
issues underlying its poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Is population control needed to overcome poverty? How can the power of the 
Catholic Church in a predominantly Catholic country be used to foster economic 
and social development? What should be the government's priorities for 
development? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was neither side's main goal, but the polemics between Fujimori and 
the church have brought a thorough airing of those issues as, day after day, 
the story plays out on front pages. 
</P>
<P>
The friction between Fujimori's administration and the Catholic leadership 
marks a low point in historically close relations between church and state in 
Peru. 
</P>
<P>
About 95% of all Peruvians are baptized Catholics, although many have joined 
evangelical Protestant congregations in recent years. Fujimori, the son of 
Japanese immigrants, is Roman Catholic. But because his presidential campaign 
earlier this year received key backing from evangelical Protestants, many 
Catholic leaders were said to have supported his opponent, novelist Mario 
Vargas Llosa, an agnostic. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking office in July, Fujimori has shown no favoritism toward 
Protestants, but he has bucked his own church's position by advocating 
artificial birth control. 
</P>
<P>
The church-state dispute broke out late last month with the news that the 
Fujimori administration would begin a birth-control information campaign, 
distributing free contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
"The development of Peru is threatened and retarded by the growing increase in 
the population," the president was quoted as saying. Peru's population is 
expanding at an annual rate of 2.5%, one of the highest in Latin America, while 
economic production is shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
Catholic leaders quickly went to the media with arguments against artificial 
methods of birth control. Bishop Bambaren, chairman of the Peruvian church's 
Family Commission, suggested that Fujimori's birth-control program might be a 
response to pressure from international lending institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori denied that, and he countered by calling the church position against 
contraceptives "medieval." He says his program will not foster a "culture of 
death," as some critics charge, but rather will seek a dignified life for all 
Peruvians. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing terrible in wanting there to be no more children eating 
garbage in the streets, abandoned and prostituted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Bambaren suggests that the government could do more for the poor by 
improving such social services as health care. "Medieval is treating the poor 
like animals with the abandonment that the sick suffer in the hospitals," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Ricardo Durand, president of the church's Episcopal Conference, told 
reporters that Peru's economic conditions require a concentration of efforts on 
problems of malnutrition and unemployment. "That is the central concern of the 
church," he said. "The important thing is economic reactivation to solve the 
problems of misery and hunger." 
</P>
<P>
The Episcopal Conference also issued a widely publicized statement saying 
official population policy cannot ignore ethical concepts in the name of 
development and "such development is not acceptable when human and moral values 
do not have primacy." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Expreso questioned congressmen of the left and right who 
supported Fujimori's birth-control program, but some also criticized the 
president for confronting the church. 
</P>
<P>
"What should be done is to work in a harmonious and intelligent way, avoiding 
offenses to other entities, especially the Catholic Church," said Sen. Enrique 
Bernales of the Socialist Left. 
</P>
<P>
Without the dispute, however, it is unlikely that the issues raised by the 
birth-control program would have received as much press attention and 
stimulated as much discussion as they did. Even feminists -- who generally 
receive little notice in Peru -- used the controversy as an opportunity to draw 
attention to their views. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an inalienable right to exercise voluntary maternity," said a newspaper 
advertisement placed by the Feminist Movement. "We reject the interference of 
the Catholic Church with regard to contraceptive methods." 
</P>
<P>
Columnist Manuel Dornellas advised the church leadership to back off. 
</P>
<P>
"It has expressed its opinion, and now each citizen and each parishioner will 
act according to the dictates of his conscience," Dornellas said. "In a 
democracy, no one has a crown. Not even the Catholic Church." 
</P>

Drawing, Alberto Fujimori is taken to task for concerning himself with birth 
control rather than the economy. He says: "Ma'am, if you don't want that

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After almost two centuries of mostly despotic dictatorship and two dismal 
recent attempts at free elections, Haiti has ventured another shot at popular 
democracy, running the first election campaign in an independent member state 
ever to be officially observed and, hopefully, verified by the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
If the U.N. presence encourages politicians to campaign fairly, and gives 
Haitians enough confidence to actually go to the polls, the combined national 
and local elections on Dec. 16 may be a watershed in the history of the 
impoverished, violence-prone country. 
</P>
<P>
It could be a watershed, too, for the international organization whose past 
election experience has been confined to helping former colonies become 
independent and keeping warring populations from one another's throats. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 U.N. technical advisers, election observers and unarmed military 
security specialists are in place after the unanimous U.N. General Assembly 
approval on Oct. 10 of Haiti's controversial request for help in reassuring 
voters that it will be safe to cast their votes. 
</P>
<P>
By election day, there will be about 400 U.N. observers and 65 unarmed U.N. 
military specialists, the latter keeping an eye on Haiti's undisciplined armed 
forces to verify that they are doing their job to maintain peace throughout the 
election campaign. Along with 200 or more observers from the Organization of 
American States and scores from various other governmental and private groups, 
there should be about 1,000 observers by election day, according to Jean 
Casimir, secretary general of Haiti's independent Electoral Council, which is 
supervising election preparations. 
</P>
<P>
According to the career international civil servant who will direct it, this 
unprecedented U.N. interjection in the political life of a sovereign member 
state -- Haiti was one of the founders of the United Nations -- may represent a 
fresh beginning for the organization that has been looking for new roles since 
the end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears to us to be very important because we see more and more countries 
that are coming apart, and the only way out is to have legitimate elections," 
said Reinhart W. A. Helmke, the soft-spoken but energetic chief of the U.N. 
Development Program here and head of the newly formed U.N. Observer Group for 
the Verification of Elections in Haiti (UNOVEH). "This could become a new 
international model." 
</P>
<P>
But to Cuba, Colombia and China, which initially resisted the U.N. move, as 
well as to other countries where the principle of noninterference reigns 
supreme, the prospect of the international body injecting itself into the 
electoral affairs of an independent country in anything other than an 
international peacekeeping role was frightening precisely because it could 
become a model. It was only after four months of wrangling and diplomatic 
maneuvering that their objections were overcome by strong assurances from the 
United States and other major powers that Haiti is a unique case. 
</P>
<P>
Like other countries that only reluctantly went along with the General Assembly 
resolution approving UNOVEH, Cuba conditioned its approval by stating that it 
wanted to "make it quite clear that we entirely reject any future attempt to 
make use of this resolution or this United Nations activity in order to seek to 
interfere in the internal affairs of that fraternal country." 
</P>
<P>
But while Haiti may be unique, its present desperate straits may not be too 
dissimilar from troubles that could face other countries, according to Helmke. 
"Here is Haiti, where all national institutions are falling apart and with 
desperate social, political and economic problems. It's clear there is no other 
solution than credible elections," he said, explaining the country's 
unprecedented call for direct U.N. help in verifying the elections. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we have to prove that the concept we designed can work in Haiti's complex 
situation. If it can work under these very complex circumstances, it may become 
an example of new ways to help countries in desperate internal situations." 
</P>
<P>
Few countries have had more trouble making the transition to democracy than 
this one, independent since its slave population ejected their French masters 
in 1804 but doomed to live under one tyrannical regime after another until 
then-President-for-Life Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier fled on Feb. 7, 1986. 
When the Duvalier dynasty collapsed, a succession of army-dominated governments 
held sway. All promised free elections while simultaneously squelching 
political activity and human rights. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Haitians turned out in large numbers for a try at democracy, in 
1987, hundreds were killed in pre-election terrorism and more than 34 voters 
were shot or hacked to death by army-supported thugs on election day, forcing 
cancellation of the voting. Another attempt at an election on Jan. 17, 1988, 
boycotted by all but a handful of voters, was rigged by heavy-handed army 
officers and resulted in a short-lived, army-dominated puppet civilian 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Against that background, Haitians at all levels of society made it clear that, 
however much they want free elections, there must be some guarantee of personal 
security for voters before they would risk going to the polls again. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the General Assembly approved the observer group, a small group of 
U.N. specialists arrived to assist the mostly inexperienced members of the 
Electoral Council in writing an electoral law and organizing the mechanics of 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"The number varied from four to seven, and they were highly specialized," said 
Helmke. "For example, one had to do a time-and-motion study on how long it 
takes a Haitian to vote because it was necessary in determining how many voters 
to assign to each polling place. You don't want people still waiting in line 
after dark with the security situation in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Military specialists, like the international poll watchers, will try to cover 
as much ground as they can, Helmke said, observing the behavior of a Haitian 
army of less than 8,000 men. Considering that army's recent record of spoiling 
elections, the presence of 65 unarmed U.N. military men may seem to be a 
too-thin blue line. But U.N., OAS and diplomatic officials here believe it will 
suffice to deter the kind of anti-democratic mischief that derailed the 1987 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the role of both the military and civilian observers, Helmke said: 
"It really is verification of all phases of the electoral process from the 
beginning of registration through the certification of results and including 
the campaign. The United Nations cannot afford to put its stamp on an election 
without certainty. Our capital is the confidence put in us."

Robert Rifkin -- A statement in a Nov. 5 story about grand jury testimony in 
the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan investigation was incorrectly attributed to 
Robert L. Rifkin, a state Department of Corporations official. 
</P>
<P>
William D. Davis, commissioner of the state Department of Savings and Loan, 
testified that he believed that Lincoln's parent company could not repay debt 
securities offered at Lincoln branches, and he provided information to 
Corporations Department officials in an effort to block the sale of those 
securities. The agency, though, approved the sale. Rifkin testified that his 
agency considered ordering a halt to advertising for the securities, but the 
agency decided not to issue such an order.

Woman misidentified -- An article Saturday misidentified a woman arrested in 
connection with the seizure of a Lancaster area marijuana farm. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, Kathleen Gegax, is the wife of Michael Gegax of Arizona, federal

UNEARTHING THE SET OF DEMILLE'S 1923 'TEN COMMANDMENTS'

An ancient Egyptian eye, unblinking in the sandy wind, stared up at Peter 
Brosnan. And Peter Brosnan, a bearded Angeleno with $10,000, a borrowed 
ground-penetrating radar system and a crazy dream, stared back. 
</P>
<P>
"Take a look at this guy," said Brosnan. "That's the Pharaoh." 
</P>
<P>
And that's why Brosnan, 38, a screenwriter, teacher and documentary filmmaker, 
started digging in the dunes near this Santa Barbara County city of 5,500 in 
1983. This is where Cecil B. DeMille filmed the silent movie version of "The 
Ten Commandments" in 1923, and where DeMille buried and abandoned one of the 
largest sets in feature film history -- the City of the Pharaoh, with walls 
that rose 110 feet and sprawled 750 feet in width, its entrance flanked by 21 
sphinxes and four 35-foot Pharaoh statues. 
</P>
<P>
Brosnan was at the site Monday to announce his most substantial progress so far 
in unearthing the city: a $10,000 grant from the Bank of America, most of it 
already committed to covering costs of equipment rental and consultation from 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
Archeologist John Parker, who labored with Brosnan, geophysicist Lambert T. 
Dolphin and a handful of others, reported radar readings that indicate several 
large objects beneath the sand just where the old sphinxes should be. Parker 
said several other findings match with old charts and suggest that while many 
objects have been dismantled or damaged, most features remain largely where 
they were in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew this was up here, but we figured it was rubble," said Ed Edwards, a 
volunteer on the site and a member of the Santa Maria Valley Archeological 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
"This is utterly unique, and it gives you a sense of time having passed -- that 
movies are now a part of history," Jarell Jackman, executive director of the 
Santa Barbara Trust for Historical Preservation. "Some archeologist may be 
uncovering Disneyland 500 years from now." 
</P>
<P>
"It would be an awfully interesting acquisition. And it would be nice to send 
somebody out there," said Ellen Hughes, historian with the Smithsonian 
Institution's National Museum of American History. Any decision, however, 
Hughes said, would require further study. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America officials were quick to note their company's own history with 
the film and the site. DeMille, a former bank employee and personal friend of 
bank founder A.P. Giannini, finished making the $1.4-million production by 
persuading Giannini to make him a loan. (Shortly before his death, DeMille 
remade "The Ten Commandments," released in 1956, with sound, a genuine Egyptian 
setting, and Charlton Heston in the role of Moses.) 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping the Hollywood community will take this on as a family project," 
said Duncan Knowles, vice president and director of organizational 
communications for Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
If Brosnan has his way, the team will make a detailed mapping and extensive 
excavation of the site, use that data to attract more donations, and eventually 
either pack the choicest artifacts off to an American museum or use them as 
centerpieces for an educational center at the dunes site. Hollywood Heritage 
Inc., a Los Angeles preservation group, is acting as the umbrella organization 
handling donations and inquiries. Last and not least, Brosnan hopes to complete 
his documentary video on DeMille and his sand-bound legacy. 
</P>
<P>
But the imponderables remain nearly as imposing as the walled city once was. 
Until this week's findings could be analyzed in detail, neither the scientists 
nor the bankers were willing to estimate the cost of a more ambitious 
excavation. The Nature Conservancy manages the property, and has the fate of 
the dunes and the local shore birds to consider. No museum has made any 
commitments to display anything. And while the film industry has been generous 
with data surrounding the old film, Brosnan acknowledged, it has been less so 
with financial support. 
</P>
<P>
Brosnan's own history with the site dates back to a late-night conversation in 
1983 with Bruce Cardozo, a former New York University film school confederate 
who mentioned the remains of the old set. Brosnan traveled to the site, quickly 
unearthed a DeMille horse's head, and was soon embarked on a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign stalled, however, while the property's owners made the complicated 
arrangements that gave control of the site to the Nature Conservancy. It was 
1989, Brosnan said, before he again began investing substantial amounts of time 
on the project. The one certainty, he added, looking down at the detritus in 
the dunes, is that many such hours lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hobby," said Brosnan, "that got out of control."

GORBACHEV AND BUSH PLAN SOVIET SUMMIT IN JANUARY

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush are planning a January 
summit in Moscow, American and Soviet officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials in Washington said that they are confident obstacles to a 
long-range nuclear weapons treaty can be resolved in time for the meeting and 
that setting a summit date could spur negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush is keeping to his 
plan to hold a Moscow summit only if a strategic arms reduction treaty is ready 
for signing. But they expressed confidence that the outstanding issues can be 
resolved by the first half of January. 
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed the treaty, which would reduce their long-range 
nuclear missiles by up to 50%, at a dinner meeting Monday night, White House 
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet spokesman Vitaly Ignatenko did not tie the summit to an arms reduction 
signing. 
</P>
<P>
He said only, "U.S. President George Bush will pay an official visit to Moscow 
at the beginning of January." Asked about an agreement, he said, "If it's 
ready, they will sign it."

SOVIETS 'VERY UNLIKELY' TO BACK GULF WAR SOON, U.S. SAYS

The White House said today it is "very unlikely" that President Bush will be 
able to muster support at a European summit from the Soviet Union for a 
compromise U.N. resolution on using military force against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few hours earlier, Bush had voiced optimism that some agreement would be 
found to overcome Soviet objections. 
</P>
<P>
But, as the second day of the summit wound down, White House spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater said it did not appear that Bush would have a deal in hand before he 
goes to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The Persian Gulf crisis continued to dominate the unofficial agenda of the 
34-nation Paris summit today, although French President Francois Mitterrand's 
spokesman said the Conference on Cooperation and Security in Europe would not 
issue any statements on the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Bush flies to front-line Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to meet with Saudi leaders 
on the crisis. He will spend Thanksgiving Day with U.S. forces in the region 
and will meet with Egyptian leaders Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The President, who was stung by his failure to win over Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in private talks Monday, voiced optimism that he would be 
successful in overcoming Soviet objections. "Just be patient and all will be 
well," he told reporters when asked about Gorbachev's reluctance to support a 
U.N. resolution authorizing force. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets today publicly held to their position that diplomatic efforts to 
force Iraq out of Kuwait have not been exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
"Both presidents are concerned about the issue," Gorbachev's spokesman, Vitaly 
Ignatenko, said. "They agreed that both sides should use maximum effort to 
fulfill the sanctions, and that the issue should be discussed in the (U.N.) 
Security Council." 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III have been unsuccessful in 
winning Soviet support for any kind of resolution authorizing a military 
strike. A meeting between Bush and Gorbachev on Monday night failed to produce 
a breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration would like the U.N. Security Council to pass some sort of 
resolution authorizing in advance a military strike to force Iraq from Kuwait.

STORM LEAVES IN ITS WAKE SCORES OF ACCIDENTS ON COUNTY FREEWAYS

The fast-moving Pacific storm that dumped more than half an inch of rain in 
South County moved out of the region this morning, leaving in its wake scores 
of traffic accidents along the county's freeways, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol reported that more than 70 traffic accidents 
occurred during a 12-hour period that ended at 6 a.m, mostly fender benders 
caused by motorists unused to the slippery roads. 
</P>
<P>
"Cars were just going too fast and they lost control," CHP spokeswoman Linda 
Burrus said. "As soon as the officers were cleared from one accident, they were 
sent to another scene." 
</P>
<P>
County Environmental Management Agency officials said the storm produced the 
first measurable rainfall since June. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago Peak, part of the Santa Ana mountains, was hit hardest, measuring 1.1 
inches of rainfall, while San Juan Capistrano and El Toro each recorded .71 
inches, EMA spokesman Shailesh Batel said. 
</P>
<P>
Some parts of central and north Orange County had far less rainfall, he said. 
Santa Ana had .16 inches, Anaheim and Fullerton both had .28, Brea had .24 and 
Cypress had only a trace of rainfall at .08 inches.

Officials today found no victims at the site of a spectacular overnight cave-in 
at a construction site four blocks from the White House that forced evacuation 
of the adjacent building that houses United Press International. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think (anyone is there), but we just want to make sure," Fire 
Department spokesman Ambrose Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden collapse swallowed several construction trailers, part of an 
adjoining alley and a light pole. Witnesses said the accident caused an 
explosion that lit the night sky. 
</P>
<P>
UPI spokesman Milt Capps said the news service was able to restore service 
quickly to its clients by switching some operations to other bureaus. For 
example, he said, the Los Angeles bureau was temporarily filing the agency's 
main domestic news wire.

CNN TURNS NORIEGA TAPES OVER TO JUDGE

Cable News Network today handed over to a federal judge tapes of Manuel Noriega 
talking on the telephone from his prison cell. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving the tapes from a team of CNN lawyers, U.S. District Judge 
William Hoeveler gave them to federal Magistrate William C. Turnoff. 
</P>
<P>
CNN unsuccessfully appealed Hoeveler's earlier temporary order barring the 
network from airing the tapes. Some of the tapes were broadcast before an 
appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the order. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler previously said he would give the tapes to the federal magistrate so 
that Hoeveler, who will preside over Noriega's drug-trafficking trial, is not 
"tainted" by any disclosures about Noriega's defense strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's attorneys claim that the tapes disclose defense maneuvers and have 
damaged the deposed Panamanian dictator's chances for a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler said today the tapes would be transcribed and translated from Spanish, 
then would be studied by Turnoff. Hoeveler said he did not know how long that 
would take. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes will be reviewed to decide whether they would damage Noriega's right 
to a fair trial. If the judge then orders a permanent ban on further 
broadcasts, CNN can again appeal, eventually to the U.S. Supreme Court.

An emigre businessman who soared into contention in Poland's presidential race 
struggled today to keep his campaign afloat as the government threatened him 
with prosecution and newspapers called him a madman and a fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Stanislaw Tyminski defiantly repeated his accusation that Prime Minister 
Tadeusz Mazowiecki had betrayed the country by selling Poland's best companies 
to foreigners at bargain-basement prices. 
</P>
<P>
But Tyminski, who made a $5-million fortune in Canada and Peru, has been 
attacked by opponents who question his business record, campaign promises and 
even his sanity. 
</P>
<P>
"From what he says and how he says it, we are beginning to see the figure of an 
insane person, with a mixture of megalomania and a dangerous, though grotesque, 
persecution complex," the pro-Mazowiecki newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza said. 
</P>
<P>
Tyminski, whose vision to free Poland from economic slavery has caught the 
imagination of many voters, has thrown the presidential election campaign into 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Unknown a month ago, he soared in the opinion polls to within striking distance 
of Mazowiecki and threatened to snatch second place in Sunday's first ballot 
behind Solidarity leader Lech Walesa. 
</P>
<P>
But Tyminski failed at a news conference to substantiate his allegations 
against Mazowiecki, which prompted prosecutors on Monday to start investigating 
him for slander. 
</P>
<P>
With five days left before the vote, it was unclear whether the attacks against 
him would destroy Tyminski's campaign or win even more people to vote for him 
out of sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
Though short on charisma, the quiet, bespectacled Tyminski has impressed many 
with his apparent business acumen and almost prophetic vision of future 
prosperity for Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Tyminski calls the Solidarity government's austerity policies "a mechanism of 
enslavement of our country." He tells audiences across the country that Poland 
is a victim of international economic warfare that threatens to make it a 
nation of "white slaves." 
</P>
<P>
Voters applaud enthusiastically as Tyminski tells them Poles could make 
billions of dollars if freed from an oppressive tax system that throttles 
initiative and success.

The National Assembly has declared a government monopoly on sales of wheat, 
barley, rice, corn and other cereals and mandated the death penalty for anyone 
violating the law, the state press said today. 
</P>
<P>
The 250-member Parliament passed the law late Monday, saying it is necessary 
due to shortages caused by the U.N. embargo. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly said the law is needed to deter greed. 
</P>
<P>
The law bans sales by both private sector middlemen and farmers. The government 
will have a monopoly on both sales and storage. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers will be allowed to keep 1,000 pounds of wheat for their personal use 
and 400 pounds of rice, but the rest must be turned over to the government 
within two weeks of harvest. 
</P>
<P>
During the debate, some assembly members suggested that the penalty be life in 
prison, but the majority voted for the death penalty, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the invasion, Iraq imported 70% of its food. Iraq has two rivers and 
abundant fertile land, but the government gave agricultural development a much 
lower priority than industry.

A Vicenza magistrate is investigating Renato Baron and his organization, Work

his encounters with the Madonna have taken place. If found guilty, they could 
get three months in jail and an $1,800 fine each.

Baron and the members of his organization were recently found innocent of 
embezzlement charges in nearby Venice. The group has accepted donations from

The 75-year-old Shamir, risking a dispute with Israel's chief ally -- the 
United States -- told supporters of his rightist Likud Party on Sunday that 
Israel should hold "Greater Israel," from the sea to the River Jordan, for 
Jewish immigration.

"It was a completely pathetic and unnecessary remark at a time when the

A group of 45 House Democrats led by California Rep. Ronald V. Dellums 
(D-Berkeley) filed suit today to try to force President Bush to seek authority 
from Congress before ordering a U.S. military attack to drive Iraqi troops out 
of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit seeks an injunction to bar Bush "from launching or initiating an 
offensive military attack by United States forces against Iraq without 
obtaining a declaration of war or other explicit authorization from the 
Congress." 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the President has a responsibility to send to Congress a 
declaration of war," Dellums told reporters outside the U.S. Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
The issue should be debated in Congress because "there are millions of American 
people in this country who have serious questions about going to war," Dellums 
said. "The President of the United States on his own cannot make that kind of 
determination." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on 
the Constitution, said Bush "has no business avoiding the Constitution or 
violating the Constitution, which he would be doing if he unilaterally goes to 
war." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court a day after Iraq ordered an 
250,000 more troops into Kuwait and nearly two weeks after Bush began 
deployment of about 200,000 more U.S. troops to the region. About 230,000 U.S. 
troops already are in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"This case poses a question of supreme importance to this nation and one 
uniquely for the courts to decide: whether a major war, not partaking of the 
element of surprise and leaving ample room for deliberation, may be initiated 
by the President without the consent of Congress," the lawmakers said in court 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
"The framers of our Constitution thought not; most members of today's Congress 
think not; the President evidently thinks so," they said. 
</P>
<P>
The Center for Constitutional Rights, which also Ange, filed the lawsuit on 
behalf of the 45 lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether Bush is required by the Constitution to get a declaration 
of war from Congress before attacking Iraqi troops in Kuwait.

An aide to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) told the Senate Ethics Committee today 
that Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), tried to coax her boss into meeting with 
federal regulators on behalf of savings and loan millionaire Charles H. Keating 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The committee explored the role of the two senators in those meetings with 
federal regulators as it began a fourth day of hearings into allegations that 
five senators improperly intervened on behalf of Keating and his Lincoln 
Savings and Loan. 
</P>
<P>
Today's testimony revealed the divisions and conflicting stories among the five 
senators who are battling for their political reputations and futures. 
</P>
<P>
Gwendolyn van Paasschen, an economics aide to McCain, testified she felt that 
her boss was "being coaxed along into" a meeting with top S&amp;L regulator 
Edwin Gray. She said she felt that DeConcini wanted McCain there because as a 
Republican he would lend a bipartisan aura to the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
She was concerned, she said, because at the time of that April, 1987, meeting, 
McCain had received more in campaign contributions from Keating than had 
DeConcini.

Volkswagen AG and China's First Automobile Works signed an $807-million joint 
venture agreement today, pledging to produce 150,000 locally made Golf cars by 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
China welcomed the deal as a "major project" in its new economic blueprint. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the new venture between the giant German auto maker and China's oldest 
auto company is slated to begin next year in the city of Changchun, in 
northeast Jilin province. 
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen Chairman Carl Hahn and his Chinese counterpart were optimistic but 
vague about the venture's ambitious goals. Neither side would give the 
estimated price of the Chinese-made Golfs. Hahn said only that the cars would 
cost less than Shanghai-produced VW Santanas, which sell for $27,000.

Treasurer Paul Keating gave Australians a $760-million tax cut today, financed 
mainly by increased revenue from higher oil prices. Keating, calling his deal a 
"golden opportunity" to trim inflation, cut taxes for salaried employees by an 
average $2.24 a week. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, combined with a previous wage pact for Australia's 7.9 million 
payroll workers, will result in total tax cuts of $8.21 a week beginning Jan. 
1. In addition, a $9.12 a week wage increase takes effect in mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian Council of Trade Unions has approved the deal, which breaks the 
traditional cycle under which employers have raised wages to match increases in 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Keating said that instead of having employers raise their wage bills and fuel 
inflation with price increases, the government would "pay" workers by cutting 
taxes.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has filed a sex discrimination 
lawsuit against a Baltimore TV station accused of firing an anchorwoman because 
she demanded the same pay as her male counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the lawsuit Monday against WBAL and parent company Hearst Corp. 
is the first such action by the federal agency against a TV station. 
</P>
<P>
EEOC Chairman Evan Kemp Jr. said the agency found that former anchorwoman Ruth 
Ann Miller was paid less than her male counterparts for similar duties and 
fired in 1989 because she demanded equal pay. 
</P>
<P>
Miller earned $141,000 a year when fired, compared to $170,000 and $180,000 for 
two male colleagues, the EEOC said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in federal court, also claims Miller was given different 
assignments and faced increased scrutiny of her clothes and hairstyle because 
she is a woman. The lawsuit seeks back wages and an equal amount in damages.

Early Sunday morning, cadets from the U.S. Military Academy captured a goat 
they thought was Bill XXVI, the mascot of the U.S. Naval Academy. 
</P>
<P>
But midshipmen can be great kidders, especially when it comes to anticipating a 
prank by rival Army cadets. The real Bill had been hidden by midshipmen just in 
case of a prank. 
</P>
<P>
The Naval Academy said the kidnaped goat was one of several that had auditioned 
to succeed Bill XXV, who was retired in 1988.

CLEMENS SUSPENDED FOR 5 GAMES IN '91;

BASEBALL: AMERICAN LEAGUE PENALIZES THE RED SOX PITCHER FOR HIS BEHAVIOR IN THE 
PLAYOFFS. HE ALSO IS FINED $10,000.

Roger Clemens was suspended for the first five games of next season and fined 
$10,000 today for behavior which led to the Boston pitcher's ejection from the 
last game of the American League playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty announced by AL President Bobby Brown will force the Red Sox star 
to miss one start. 
</P>
<P>
It comes a week after he earned a $125,000 bonus provided in his contract for 
finishing second in the AL Cy Young Award voting. 
</P>
<P>
Although Clemens can appeal, Red Sox General Manager Lou Gorman said: "Dr. 
Brown's statement and subsequent fine and suspension of Roger Clemens speaks 
for itself. Although we are not in agreement with the severity of the league's 
action, we are satisfied that the issue has been addressed." 
</P>
<P>
Clemens was ejected by plate umpire Terry Cooney in the second inning of 
Oakland's 3-1 victory that completed the A's four-game sweep Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
In his announcement, Brown cited Clemens for making "significant physical 
contact with an umpire (Jim Evans), for threatening umpire Cooney, for verbally 
abusing umpire Cooney with personal obscenities and for not leaving the dugout 
immediately after the ejection." 
</P>
<P>
Clemens was not immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Clemens led the league for the second time in earned-run average 
with a 1.93 mark. He was 21-6. 
</P>
<P>
The altercation occurred after Clemens walked Willie Randolph. Cooney and 
Clemens got into a shouting match, and Clemens, trying to get closer to Cooney, 
bumped Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens at the time denied directing any profanity at Cooney, but Oakland 
pitcher Dave Stewart said he had done exactly that.

A female high school basketball player who became ill during a practice session 
collapsed and died as she was being led out of a gymnasium. Her brother also 
died as a high school athlete. 
</P>
<P>
Patty LiVolsi, 16, a junior at Immaculate High School, collapsed in a hallway 
Monday evening moments after she told an assistant coach she was feeling 
nauseous, Coach Joseph Appello said. 
</P>
<P>
She was pronounced dead at Danbury Hospital. The State Medical Examiner's 
Office in Farmington performed an autopsy today, but released no information 
pending further study. 
</P>
<P>
LiVolsi's older brother, Greg, died several years ago of a heart condition 
while he was in high school, said Appello. He was a football and basketball 
player. 
</P>
<P>
The team has dedicated the basketball season to LiVolsi. 
</P>
<P>
Father Robert Post, principal of Immaculate, said LiVolsi had had a physical 
before the school year began. 
</P>
<P>
"I read her physical this morning, and there was nothing to indicate that there 
was any disorder," Post said today. 
</P>
<P>
Post said he did not know whether LiVolsi had ever been tested for a heart 
condition like her brother's, but said he knew of no previous incidents when 
she had felt ill before a game.

INJURIES SEND SEVERAL NBA TEAMS LIMPING OUT OF THE STARTING GATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BARNARD, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barely two weeks into the new season, several NBA teams are wondering if 
injuries have already knocked them out of title contention. 
</P>
<P>
Several key players have been injured, which could have a major effect on the 
league's balance of power. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia, Dallas and Atlanta all suffered double blows. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Tarpley, off to a great start for the Dallas Mavericks by averaging more 
than 20 points and 11 rebounds per game, will miss the entire season because of 
a torn ligament in his knee. 
</P>
<P>
Ditto Philadelphia 76ers point guard Johnny Dawkins, another budding star. 
</P>
<P>
Also sidelined with less serious knee injuries were Fat Lever of the Mavericks 
and Philadelphia's Rickey Green, who is Dawkins' replacement at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
Green is back, but the 76ers' other starting guard, Hersey Hawkins, struggled 
when Dawkins left the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"When you play with a guy for a full season, you learn about each other," 
Hawkins said. "We automatically know where we're going to be on the court. We 
had a certain chemistry. Now I have to find that chemistry with someone else, 
and quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he has. Green, at 36 one of the oldest guards in the NBA, returned to the 
floor Monday night and Hawkins celebrated with 31 points as the 76ers beat 
Charlotte, 109-101. Still, 76ers Coach Jim Lynam said it has yet to be decided 
if a trade will be made to find another point guard. 
</P>
<P>
"Having your point guard injured is a problem," Lynam said. "He's the guy who 
sets up the offense and finds the open man. However, it's overstating the case 
to suggest that it's a devastating setback. The other guys have to keep up 
their production and adjust." 
</P>
<P>
Lever, expected to miss up to six weeks, was the key man in Dallas' off-season 
trading spree, while the Mavericks were hoping Tarpley could come back from 
drug rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't get people stepping in and helping, these two injuries could be 
real killers," Dallas Coach Richie Adubato said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks, expected to contend in the Western Conference, last week became 
the first team to lose consecutive games to the Florida expansion teams, Miami 
and Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta's Dominique Wilkins sprained his right thumb against Charlotte on 
Friday and joined starting guard Doc Rivers, who pulled a groin muscle, on the 
sideline for the Hawks. Wilkins is expected back tonight against Charlotte, 
which Monday played without leading rebounder Armon Gilliam, who has tendinitis 
in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Richmond, averaging nearly 25 points for the surprising Golden State 
Warriors, had consecutive games with 12-for-15 shooting from the field before 
he fractured the tip of his left thumb on Thursday and was placed on the 
injured list. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State started the season 7-2 and won five consecutive games, but on 
Sunday night the injury to Richmond caught up with the Warriors as the Lakers 
won easily, 115-93. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers also have two players on the injured list with knee problems. Ron 
Harper is still recovering from last season's serious injury and is expected 
back in January, while Danny Manning has tendinitis in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
John (Hot Rod) Williams, who signed a seven-year, $26.5-million free-agent 
contract with Cleveland during the off-season, sprained his left foot on 
Friday. He will miss four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Among other players injured this season but expected back soon are Denver's 
Michael Adams, hamstring; Seattle's Dale Ellis, nerve problem in the ankle and 
foot; Minnesota's Tod Murphy, sprained ankle, and New York's Kenny Walker, 
twisted knee. 
</P>
<P>

Donald Trump plays a featured role in the new video for all-female hard rock 
band Precious Metal, portraying the title character for the song "Mr. Big 
Stuff," Chameleon Records announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Trump has agreed to donate to charity the $25,000 performance fee paid to him 
by the record company, plus $50,000 if the record goes gold and an additional 
$150,000 if it goes platinum. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is the second rock video appearance for the famed financier, it 
marks his first feature role. He had a walk-through in a Bobby Brown video. 
</P>
<P>
Precious Metal vocalist Leslie Knauer said The Donald was "a real gentleman to 
work with, very patient . . . and he takes great direction." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Big Stuff" is a remake of the 1971 Jean Knight classic.

Florence Henderson says she regrets arriving in Hollywood about the time the 
studios stopped making musicals. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved those old film musicials," said Henderson, best known as the matriarch 
of "The Brady Bunch." 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in this tiny town in southern Indiana where going to the movies was 
the biggest excitement of the week. I wanted to be Jane Powell." 
</P>
<P>
She even tried to break into show business as a singer, at a talent show staged 
by bandleader Horace Heidt, but the results were less than successful, she 
recalled in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
"I was such a kid. I didn't know you had to bring your own piano player. I 
showed up with a Jane Powell record. On one side, she was singing 'It's a Most 
Unusual Day' and on the other was a French song," she said. 
</P>
<P>
" 'What are you going to sing?' Mr. Heidt asked. 'These two songs,' I said. 
'Where's your piano player?' he wanted to know. 'Oh, I don't have one,' I said. 
That's what I did, too. Of course, I didn't win."

Singer Axl Rose, facing possible assault charges for allegedly beating his 
neighbor, asked Monday for a restraining order against her, claiming she is a 
"potentially dangerous rock-and-roll 'groupie.' 
</P>
<P>
" 
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old lead singer of the heavy metal band Guns N' Roses wants a Los 
Angeles Superior Court judge to bar Gabriella Kantor from any contact with him, 
his wife, Erin, or any visitors to their West Hollywood condominium. 
</P>
<P>
Rose was arrested Oct. 30, after Kantor called the Sheriff's Department and 
accused the singer of hitting her on the head with a wine bottle. The alleged 
assault occurred about 2:30 a.m., outside Rose's residence in the 8700 block of 
Shoreham Drive West.

Pop star Madonna and a neighbor are locked in a legal battle over whether she 
is complying with restrictions that require her to trim trees and hedges on her 
property so the view of the city can be enjoyed by the neighborhood residents. 
</P>
<P>
The struggle began in 1987 -- before Madonna bought the house -- when Donald 
Robinson sued the previous resident to get the foliage trimmed at the Hollywood 
Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
The previous owners allegedly failed to abide by an agreement that applies to 
all residents in the Beverly Highlands tract above Doheny Drive. 
</P>
<P>
That agreement, according to papers filed in court, ensures "that all lots will 
continue to enjoy (an) unobstructed city view." 
</P>
<P>
Madonna countersued Robinson, accusing him of trespassing on her property, 
"making threatening, abusive and derogatory statements to and/or about 
(Madonna) and cutting various trees and plants" on her land, according to the 
court papers.
