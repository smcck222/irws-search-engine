THERE'LL ALWAYS BE AN ENGLAND; 
</P>
<P>
BUT MARGARET THATCHER WON'T ALWAYS BE PRIME MINISTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Embattled Margaret Thatcher remains leader of Britain's Conservative Party, and 
so the country's prime minister -- but only barely. She has survived a vote of 
confidence taken by her party colleagues in the House of Commons, winning 204 
votes against 152 for former defense minister Michael Heseltine. But under Tory 
party rules, that margin, representing something less than a ringing 
endorsement, forces Thatcher to face a second round of voting on Tuesday. Other 
candidates could choose to stand against her, perhaps diluting the opposition 
vote and letting her claim the simple majority she needs to stay as party head. 
But her reelection is hardly assured. 
</P>
<P>
Polls show the Tories would do better in the next national elections with 
someone other than Thatcher leading them. But elections don't have to be called 
until mid-1992; Thatcher's public standing could conceivably increase by then. 
Thatcher has served as PM longer than anyone in this century. She led her party 
to victory in three elections, steered it through the war with Argentina to 
reclaim the Falklands, faced down the miners union in a long strike, moved -- 
often drastically -- to reverse Britain's economic decline and won a prominent 
place on the world stage. 
</P>
<P>
But 11 1/2 years in office is a long time. Memory and feelings being what they 
are, it is the mistakes and irritations of this long tenure that are more 
likely to be immediately recalled, while its achievements are left to history 
to salute. Thatcher is seen as having become increasingly autocratic at home 
and a somewhat tiresome scold within the European Community. Her government is 
deeply identified with high interest rates, inflation and a flat tax on every 
adult (in place of the property tax) that is generally regarded as hugely 
unfair. Ultimately, in the cold calculus of politics, the question that will 
most decisively sway Conservative MPs is whether they are more likely to win 
the next election with Thatcher at their head or someone else. Next week will 
bring the answer.

A CRIME OF HATE IN LAGUNA HILLS; 
</P>
<P>
DARK CLOUDS OF BIGOTRY CASTING THEIR SHADOWS OUT TO NEWEST SUBURBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some victims may take modest comfort in hearing crime prevention officers 
explain that burglars usually have no quarrel with their targets and are 
looking only for quick cash. But when a black man and his family returned to 
their dream house in Laguna Hills last week, they found a racial epithet 
spray-painted alongside the staircase, a chandelier hauled down on an antique 
oak table and tens of thousands of dollars worth of other destruction. What 
could be said to address their special sense of violation? 
</P>
<P>
Racism and intolerance have no place anywhere, least of all at a family's 
doorstep. But in Westminster two summers ago, a black family was awakened by a 
burning cross on their front lawn, the consummate symbol of racial intolerance 
in America. Southeast Asian immigrants have been victims of prejudice ever 
since arriving on these shores after the Vietnam War. Amber Jefferson's face 
was ripped open in August. Earlier this month, vandalism was committed in the 
home of an Anaheim gay-rights activist. 
</P>
<P>
So where are we today? Officials say they are worried that hate crimes are 
spreading to the newest suburbs, like dark clouds shadowing the spread of the 
suburban dream. Orange County has increasingly urbanized, and in the process 
has been transformed from a virtually all-white enclave to a place with real 
ethnic mix. But the Sheriff's Department says the break-in at the De Silva home 
was the first hate crime it has investigated in the southern part of the 
county. So last week's incident stood as a regrettable milestone on the police 
blotter. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the county Human Relations Commission held a news conference with 
religious and community leaders to deplore what had happened. Crimes that are 
sparked by bigotry, like this one, can and should be prosecuted as felonies. 
</P>
<P>
And the public must resolve to root out racism wherever it shows itself -- in 
the workplace, the neighborhood or along a victimized family's stairwell in 
Laguna Hills.

FUNDAMENTALISM AND UNREST IN INDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to say that it is open season on Islam. It is so trendy to dump on 
Islam. So convenient to oversimplify -- good guys versus bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
Acts of violence committed by others against Muslims are portrayed to be only 
in reaction to some act of the followers of Islam. How foolish it appears to 
imply that these poor lambs go about their business peacefully until excited 
into action by a person of Islamic faith. 
</P>
<P>
Blaming Hindu fundamentalism on Islamic fundamentalism is mental trickery in 
order to skirt the real issue, i.e., minority rights. V.P. Singh is to be 
commended for his courageous stand on minority rights -- those of the 
untouchables and Muslims. Ignoring real issues and looking for scapegoats are 
deception.

FUNDAMENTALISM AND UNREST IN INDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
India is the birthplace of four established religions: Hinduism, Buddhism, 
Sikhism and Jainism. A vast majority of Hindus in the world live there. 
</P>
<P>
So do Sikhs. So do Jains. Many Buddhists live there. And India is the second 
most Muslim-populous nation in the world. Yes, there are more Muslims in India 
than in Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
In almost any city in India, you can find a Hindu temple, a Christian church, a 
Jain temple, a Muslim mosque and a Sikh gurdwara within a block of each other. 
Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists intermarry and visit each other's places of 
worship. 
</P>
<P>
No nation in the world can lay claim to such an evolving diversity, to such 
distinctions. Please give India understanding.

ACCIDENTS IN ANGELES FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This article represents opinions of people who are not fully aware of the 
public's total disregard for their own safety. 
</P>
<P>
All the signs in the world will not deter the fringe element from attempting to 
do just what signs indicate should not be done. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the presence of a sign warning of a certain danger is all that is 
needed for the foolhardy type to disprove the message. My experience as a 
30-year veteran of the U.S. Forest Service, four years of which was spent in 
the Angeles in the mid- to late-1940s, proved to me that there is no way to 
keep the small number of daredevils from harming themselves. The only sure 
system would be to close national forests to all potential users. 
</P>
<P>
If Judge A. Wallace Tashima would spend a day in the forest observing the 
behavior of the daredevil types, he would soon come to the conclusion that 
there is simply no way to deter these people from placing themselves in harm's 
way, even when they are sober. This tendency is compounded ten times over when 
alcohol is involved, boosting the participants' feeling of invincibility to all 
danger. And of course, once an individual is injured or killed by any such 
foolhardy activity, the deep pockets syndrome comes into play.

This article really chaps my hide! Signs listing every possible danger? There 
is already a plethora of man-made signs, i.e., graffiti, trash and destruction 
of flora by boobs who should get their recreation in MacArthur Park or 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
How about signs in really dangerous areas? Example: "Jogging in the freeway 
lanes may be injurious to your health." 
</P>
<P>
And get off the backs of the fine people of the Forest Service. In 30 years of 
hiking, picnicking and camping in the Angeles, I have found them to be helpful, 
friendly and dedicated. Dealing every day with willful destruction, druggies, 
drunks, speeders, illegal shooters, lack of funds and lack of personnel is no 
picnic.

PRIVATE FACES, PUBLIC PLACES; 
</P>
<P>
FOR SAN DIEGO INDIANS, MEMORY IS THE ARCHIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA BLANDFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few miles from Interstate 15, from Lawrence Welk Drive and Champagne 
Boulevard, from pink Italianate housing tracts on gray-scrub hillsides, the 
Pala Indian Reservation sleeps in another time, in the burning inland sun. 
</P>
<P>
Three thousand or so acres along dusty roads in northern San Diego County; a 
gravel pit rented out, an avocado farm managed by others, crumbling trailers 
slumped on or off brick supports and a soft thicket of willow trees, where the 
river once ran. 
</P>
<P>
In 1903, the Cupeno Indians were moved here by force from their homes in Warner 
Hot Springs. A photograph survives showing the morning of their exile: Stunned, 
proud, poor, they stand bundled in heavy Victorian clothing by neat adobe 
houses. Other photographs continue the story: the women saying goodby to the 
graveyard, to simple wooden crosses marking parents, husbands, children; the 
wagon train crossing the steep, bare mountains to this valley -- 40 minutes' 
drive today, four days' walk then. They arrived without houses, tents, crops or 
help and begged door to door for food from Indians nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The Mission San Antonio de Pala is still here, still open. One of the fathers 
-- a kind, warm Italian missionary from Rome -- talks of the Cupenos as "crying 
on the past," as if that is better than forgetting it. They nearly did, of 
course: the language, dances, tales, basket weaving, the wisdom beneath the sky 
that is God's eyes -- they were nearly lost. But old faces, old spirits bore 
witness, marked by the photographs on the walls of the cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
This center, a plain brick and wooden shed, has the feeling to it of an old 
home passed down through generations. Photographs, mementos, children's 
artworks, stories told as lives are lived, jumbled and with untidy ends. The 
Indians talk gently to those who come, resigned to the unwitting insults of 
those who simply know no better, who assume that before the rickety, government 
housing there were tepees and animal skins. Outsiders wouldn't know of the neat 
thatched adobe homes, the modest Victorian outfits, the graveyard left untended 
on All Soul's. 
</P>
<P>
The last survivor of that "trail of tears" died a few years ago. A photograph 
of Roscinda Noasquez shows a small, shapeless old lady in cheap cotton, hair 
net in place, thick glasses hiding her soul. "Our people," says her grandson, 
"they are nothing, but they are everything." 
</P>
<P>
Her grandson's hair is long and black, his face as immobile as one that has had 
too many lifts -- or one that comes from a place of truth. His grandmother 
raised him "to respect all things that matter with the pure sweetness of 
truth." He wears beautiful Indian moccasins and laughs at those who see it as a 
statement. "Moccasins don't make me Indian -- I am Indian. I don't believe in 
carrying symbols to show who I am, and if I did, I'd be carrying Gucci and 
Louis Vuitton as well." 
</P>
<P>
He calls it "walking in other worlds," the years spent as a makeup artist in 
the theater, at La Costa, touring with rock groups. Once he painted fantasy 
faces, now he captures dreams in sand. Not so different; all that is missing is 
the spirit, which is everything. 
</P>
<P>
Other juxtapositions in Pala . . . The tribal chief is also the fire chief, and 
only 29 years old. Meek and makeshift homes on the one hand, on the other $30 
million won in a water-rights case. Stepping back into history in the dark 
mission chapel, cold through its thick stone walls, stepping out again into the 
Indian cemetery -- to the ranks of babies' graves and soldiers lost in service. 
The graves are covered with flowers, plastic, silk, fresh, with ornaments and 
photographs, with stuffed toys, powder compacts, shoes and carvings -- not one 
disturbed, nor one forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
A rough wind blows across the sage scrub. Cupenos sleep beneath the giant 
pepper trees and eucalyptus. Does this peace -- this sense of being known -- 
walk out there along Lawrence Welk Drive and Champagne Boulevard?

ALWAYS PREPARING, WILL WE NEVER ACT?; 
</P>
<P>
PERSIAN GULF: AS STRENGTH BUILDS, SUPPORT EBBS. WE MAY MISS THE OPTIMUM MOMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gaetano Scardocchia, The following interview with former Secretary of State 
Henry Kissinger was conducted in New York by Gaetano Scardocchia, special 
correspondent for the Italian newspaper La Stampa of Turin.11/21/90 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: May I try to summarize your attitude on the gulf crisis in a few 
words? Without the capitulation of Saddam Hussein, the real choice is not 
between peace and war but between a war now and a war in the future, a war more 
destabilizing and catastrophic. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I wouldn't put it in terms of capitulation of Iraq, but I would say 
that any settlement must keep in mind not only the immediate issue but the 
balance of power in the gulf after the United States leaves. And if Iraq 
remains in a militarily predominant position, then indeed there will be a war 
later, either between Arabs or between Arabs and Israel, or both. 
</P>
<P>
Q: With the decision to almost double the military force in the gulf, President 
Bush wanted to scare Saddam Hussein by saying we mean business, but the first 
effect has been a more scared American public opinion. Domestic support is 
weakening. 
</P>
<P>
A: The basic problem has been from the beginning to relate strength to time. At 
the very beginning we were relatively weak, but we had lots of time. As we 
build up our strength, we also lose support, because time goes by. One of the 
big decisions to be made is to pick the optimum mode in which strength and 
available time combine to produce the best negotiating positions, or, if that 
fails, the best military positions. And I am not sure that all of our military 
people understand the psychological element. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why did the President suddenly make a decision of such an increase in 
forces? 
</P>
<P>
A: I can only speak as an outsider. My impression is that our military 
leadership, analyzing the issue in strictly military terms, has stated the 
force requirements that we have now seen publicly. They generate the force 
requirements by taking the worst-case scenario, and so they treat the Iraqi 
army as if it were the German army at the height of its power, and they want to 
allow for everything that could conceivably go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Yet I can see what tempts a military commander into that direction, because if 
anything goes wrong, as it often does in war, they want to have the greatest 
degree of reassurance. The decision the President has to make is how much 
weight to give to the political, psychological, diplomatic factors to avoid 
being driven by purely technical considerations. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The choices seem to be only capitulation by Hussein or war. Is there a third 
option? 
</P>
<P>
A: The only effective diplomatic way out is one that changes the situation. We 
have to summarize what Saddam Hussein has done. He didn't just occupy Kuwait. 
He is changing the character of the whole country, expelling people, looting 
the entire infrastructure, moving in new people, so that with every passing 
month he is creating a fait accompli, which makes the whole diplomatic effort 
partly irrelevant. On top of it, he has undertaken an absolutely unprecedented 
use of hostages in taking thousands of them and keeping them near military 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if a man who has shown such ruthlessness emerges from this crisis with a 
strong military position, then we have lost, and we ought to be honest about 
this. Every diplomatic proposal that I have seen so far is in fact a defeat for 
the United Nations position; they would give him something and penalize him not 
at all. Every prominent outside visitor is a psychological success for him. 
Every time a leading outside figure calls for diplomacy without asking anything 
of Iraq, it is a success for Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Dr. Kissinger, from your words I arrived at the conclusion that war is 
inevitable there. 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Defeat is also possible. A diplomatic solution is also possible. If I 
had to predict what will happen, I would say there is a good chance of an 
unsatisfactory diplomatic solution in a face-saving way. 
</P>
<P>
Q: It seems to me that President Bush has not prepared this country enough for 
a war. 
</P>
<P>
A: Within the government there are different opinions, and those who are 
opposed to the military option always ask for more time for diplomacy, and 
those who favor the military option ask for time to build up forces, and the 
combination means the time for decision never arrives. And since the President 
has not been obliged to make the decision, he cannot very well prepare the 
American public for something that his advisers tell him doesn't have to be 
decided yet. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But it will come in January because there are certain deadlines, the 
weather, the spring. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A: Unless people know that a deadline of a sort comes in January, there will be 
a peace proposal from somewhere, which I expect . . . maybe from Saddam 
Hussein, maybe from the Soviets. I firmly expect a diplomatic phase. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What will happen when the United States proposes to the Security Council a 
resolution authorizing the use of military force in the gulf? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, I would be astonished if we could get a resolution without any 
qualifications. There will be a debate. There will be two kinds of proposals: 
first, qualifications of the kind of force that can be used, some sort of 
limitations. Second, there will almost certainly be a proposal that before one 
decides, there should be a peace mission. I don't think there will be a clean 
resolution (authorizing use of force).

FISH REPORT: ANGLERS DUEL WITH BIG CATFISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Kazlauskas of Hemet would like nothing better than to pull a monster 
catfish out of Lake Skinner for his Thanksgiving meal. 
</P>
<P>
In October Kazlauskas, using mackerel for bait, caught cats of 23 and 27 1/2 
pounds -- the latter a lake record. Then, on Oct. 31, John Norton of Temecula, 
using shrimp, topped that at 31 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Kazlauskas, fishing 70 feet deep near the dam last weekend, came 
back with one weighing 29 1/4. At last report, he and Norton were still out 
there.

PARKER ADVANCES TO DIVISION III SEMIS

Francis Parker Coach Doug Huffman didn't see his usual playoff-tough team 
Tuesday night in the first round of the state Division III girls' volleyball 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
His starting seniors, Amy and Jill Meier, weren't on their games, and his 
juniors and sophomores seemed to feel the playoff pressure. 
</P>
<P>
But junior reserve Sarah Tubbesing apparently was numb to it all as she came up 
with big serve after big serve in the deciding fifth game to pull out a 15-13, 
7-15, 15-8, 11-15, 15-10 victory for Francis Parker over visiting San Joaquin 
Memorial of Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we were a little nervous," Huffman said. "We started off pretty slow 
and didn't do a very good job of controlling the ball. This was not one of our 
best games." 
</P>
<P>
Parker advanced into Saturday's semifinals against Winward Mar Vista or 
Mammoth. 
</P>
<P>
In the deciding fifth game, Tubbesing, a defensive specialist who does not 
start, served three aces and was partly responsible for another four Parker 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"She served to specific areas and took them out of their offense," Huffman 
said." 
</P>
<P>
Parker (22-1) led, 7-3, early in the fifth game, but sloppy net play let San 
Joaquin (20-7) back in the game. But with the score tied at eight, sophomore 
Paula McNamee had a kill and a block to give Parker back the lead, 10-8. Then 
at 11-8, Tubbesing then served three consecutive winning points. 
</P>
<P>
Parker had an opportunity to put the match away after four games as it held an 
11-10 lead. But the Lancers had trouble handling San Joaquin's Renae Chavez's 
serves and lost the last five points of the game.

USDHS SWEEPS INTO PLAYOFFS' 2ND ROUND 
</P>

<P>
After USDHS' three-game sweep of Taft in Tuesday's opening round of the 
CIF/Reebok Girls' Southern California Championships it was easy to see why the 
idea of forfeiting the match had crossed the mind of Taft Coach Bill Friend. 
</P>
<P>
During the past week, this team from Central California traveled nearly 1,000 
miles playing for the right to lose to the second-seeded Dons, 15-4, 15-7, 
17-15. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, it looked like the Wildcats (16-2) had recovered from their van 
lag as they overcame an 11-4 deficit in the third game to lead, 15-14. 
</P>
<P>
But Michelle Rico, USDHS' 5-foot-9 middle hitter, gave Taft an early dismissal 
to get back on the road for the 250-mile drive home. Rico, a senior, had four 
consecutive kills, three of which denied the Wildcats the game point and gave 
the Dons a sideout. With her last kill, Rico stepped to the service line with 
USDHS (22-2) trailing, 15-14, and delivered three aces. 
</P>
<P>
"We were playing tired," Friend said. "You could see the potential in the third 
game. But this trip was a killer." 
</P>
<P>
USDHS looked flawless through most of the first two games, with junior Rose 
Dowling getting off impressive cross-court sets to the likes of Rico, who had 
10 of her kills in the third game, and 5-10 senior Christina Alvarado, who 
finished with a match-high and season-high 23 kills. But Dons' coach Rob Gorney 
chose to describe his team's effort as average. One reason: Dowling, Rico, and 
another starter, Corinne Olvera, were playing with illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a lot stronger than we showed tonight," said Gorney, whose team has won 
18 matches in a row.

CONTROVERSY NOTHING NEW FOR CITY FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS

<P>
The new-look L.A. City football playoffs will start tonight amid old-look 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
District officials have long tried to devise a format that will please coaches, 
but the latest attempt doesn't seem to have done that. 
</P>
<P>
In this season's realignment, for instance, all 12 teams in the 4-A Division 
qualified for the playoffs, which would have worked better with only eight 
teams. Included were Crenshaw (2-7), Chatsworth (2-7) and Reseda Cleveland 
(0-8-1), the bottom three seeded teams that most coaches figured should not 
have been included. The top four seeded teams -- Carson, Wilmington Banning, 
Dorsey and Granada Hills -- got first-round byes to make the brackets work 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
Then Cleveland, devastated by injuries and academic ineligibility, decided 
Monday to forfeit its game against Woodland Hills Taft. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, there were 16 teams in 4-A and 12 made the playoffs. The Southern 
League, which is in the same conference as Carson, Banning and Dorsey, was 
moved to 3-A this year. The 3-A Division now has 37 teams, and 16 qualified for 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Palos Verdes High girls' tennis team dethroned two-time defending champion 
Corona del Mar in the Southern Section Division 4-A championship match Tuesday 
at the Claremont Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
The match ended in a tie, 9-9, but Palos Verdes (21-0) was awarded the victory 
on games, 77-67. 
</P>
<P>
In 3-A, Westlake High of Westlake Village relied on strong doubles play and 
upset top-seeded Calabasas, 10-8, and in 2-A, Sunny Hills defeated top-seeded 
Los Alamitos, 12-6. In 1-A, San Luis Obispo defeated Cate, 11-7. Brentwood 
turned back La Mirada, 10-8, for the Small Schools title.

CSUN TRANSITION GAME PLAGUED BY HEAVY TURNOVER; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: DEPARTED PLAYERS TAKE SOME PARTING SHOTS, BUT COACH PETE 
CASSIDY DEFENDS THE PERSONNEL CHANGES AS TEAM GEARS UP FOR DIVISION I. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THERESA MUNOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is difficult enough on a shoestring budget to take a mediocre Division II 
basketball program to the Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
The difference in talent can be demoralizing and an arduous schedule, such as 
the one Cal State Northridge faces -- only 11 of 28 games will be played at 
home -- can be difficult to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
At Northridge, the obstacles are even greater because the program's timing 
could not be worse. Since their final Division II game last February, the 
Matadors have lost eight players with eligibility remaining and two others are 
academically ineligible. CSUN will make its Division I debut Friday at 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
The athletes recruited expressly for making the transition didn't stick around 
to see it through. Forward Kendell McDaniels, the team's second-leading scorer 
as a sophomore last season, transferred to Cal State Bakersfield. Bill Mazurie, 
the top freshman scorer, left for Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman center Shanan Rosenberg, academically ineligible last semester, 
transferred to Division II UC Davis and sophomore forward Sandy Brown switched 
to Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
Senior starters Jemarl Baker and Eugene Humphrey and walk-on Andre Henry, all 
of whom were major contributors, left the program but remain students at 
Northridge, as does walk-on Brooklyn McLinn. 
</P>
<P>
From the standpoint of the defectors, with the exception of Baker and Humphrey, 
the program is fraught with problems. From where 20th-year Coach Pete Cassidy 
sits, a housecleaning was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll probably never have the turnover that we had last year and wouldn't have 
if we didn't go Division I," Cassidy said. "You can't gradually change 25% of 
your schedule, then 50%. If you upgrade the schedule, you have to upgrade your 
personnel. Any time you tell kids they don't measure up to the standards, you 
are the bad guy. I tried very seriously to be fair." 
</P>
<P>
Although Cassidy attempted to recruit Division I-caliber players the past two 
seasons in anticipation of the move, he admits that he sometimes was not 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't really know about kids until after the first year," Cassidy said. 
"The courtship that is recruiting goes only so far. The players are on their 
best behavior. I don't think any coach knows a kid until they see them in a 
stress situation, day in and day out." 
</P>
<P>
Mazurie and Brown did not pass Cassidy's stress test, but they were given more 
playing time than two players Cassidy retained, Erik Cooper and Kirk Scott. 
Henry and Rosenberg also played more than Cooper and Scott on a team that went 
12-15 in its final Division II campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the kids we didn't invite back because we didn't think they would make 
it," Cassidy said, referring to Brown and Mazurie. "Others, I thought worked 
hard. Sometimes you say, maybe with hard work and commitment, they can be a 
Division I player." 
</P>
<P>
That was Cassidy's thinking in the cases of Henry, McDaniels, Baker and 
Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
But Henry, a walk-on who started nine games last season, quit after learning 
that he would have to start over at the bottom of the depth chart. McDaniels 
didn't take kindly to the treatment of Brown but didn't make up his mind about 
quitting until Cassidy told him that he couldn't afford to give him two weeks 
to consider it. Cassidy reasoned that he needed to recruit a replacement for 
McDaniels immediately. In the cases of Baker and Humphrey, he didn't get the 
chance -- they quit too late for him to get replacements. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, the team's third-leading scorer, decided in late September not to return 
because of family responsibilities. Humphrey, CSUN's point guard, announced 
Nov. 6 that he was quitting to spend more time on his studies. 
</P>
<P>
The turnover rate among personnel has taken its toll on a recruiting budget 
that has been limited from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of players over the years that we lost because we didn't have 
the financial wherewithal," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
"We not only came in second and third to Division I schools, we lost to 
Division II schools as well. We are also under time restraints recruiting 
because we (the coaches) have to teach classes here as well." 
</P>
<P>
In the past three seasons, 16 players have lasted one year or less, requiring 
the CSUN staff to repeat the recruiting process more often. Instead of focusing 
on a few recruits each year, the Matador staff has had to restock with 11 
players this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you have to recruit a bunch of guys in one year, it is going to be 
tough," said Rusty Smith, a former assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, you recruit three to four guys a year, maybe one to two some years. 
Every now and then these things do happen." 
</P>
<P>
Another consequence of frequent turnover is the amount of practice time wasted 
on teaching skills to players who ultimately will not return. Wrongly assessing 
these players is not limited to talent and potential. 
</P>
<P>
During the early signing period last fall, Cassidy signed two players to 
national letters of intent, Dorian Manigo of Riordan High in the Bay Area and 
Mark Wilkinson of Foothill High in Orange County, who did not qualify 
academically under Proposition 48. 
</P>
<P>
Another signee, Troy LeBlanc, did not receive his associate of arts degree from 
Skyline College and could not enroll at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy is concerned about the situation, but he won't invoke a rule that 
potential recruits have to pass the Scholastic Aptitude Test or the American 
College Test before he signs them to scholarships. He fears he would lose the 
chance to sign too many outstanding players. "Most kids haven't taken the test 
yet (by the Nov. 14-21 early signing period) or if they have, they don't have 
the results back," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the players who are academically ineligible this semester, Cooper and 
Percy Fisher, and the pair that were in that situation last season, Scott and 
Rosenberg, Cassidy insists that his new staff members, assistants Tom McCollum 
and Wayne Fluker, must be more discriminating. "We can't let guys in who are 
marginal," he said. "We have to make sure they have a better chance." 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Brown fits into the Loyola Marymount-style offense CSUN is employing this 
season, but that is not what Cassidy wanted a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't fit into the system, the eight-passes-before-a-shot rule," said 
Brown, who averaged five points a game as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"The type of team we had was a bunch of greyhounds, a run-and-gun type that 
could move up the court, but (Cassidy) wanted a slow tempo. Almost the whole 
team had trouble adjusting to that pace. You had to play with a feeling of 
restraint." 
</P>
<P>
To the players, it is restraint, to Cassidy, it's discipline. 
</P>
<P>
"The 5-7-8 passes were (practice) drills," Cassidy said. "We had to have 
discipline to run the offense, especially a motion offense. Even in the games I 
didn't want outside shots some times." 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Cassidy, Brown was told that the staff was recruiting players 
with abilities that were superior to Brown's. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of insulting," Brown said. "He said I hadn't developed into his 
type of player. I admit I wasn't going to pass the ball every time I touched 
it; I am a scorer. It could be defense; I have lazy days in practice, but I kid 
you not -- in games I would play defense." 
</P>
<P>
Another shortcoming was Brown's reedy 6-6 and 160-pound frame. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't gain enough weight and I didn't get as strong as he expected me to 
get," said Brown, who Cassidy characterized as "unwilling" to work out with 
weights. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, Brown had difficulty communicating with Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
"Cassidy doesn't talk to recruits," Brown said. "He lets the assistants 
recruit. I saw him only once before I signed. A couple guys joked about it, how 
he doesn't do the recruiting. It's like looking at a book. The book looks 
interesting, but when you open it, it is boring." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, the team's top recruiter until June when he accepted a similar position 
at Eastern Washington, claims that Cassidy's style is not unusual. "Every 
program does it differently." Smith said. "Some head coaches are involved a 
little more than others." 
</P>
<P>
On trips, Brown said he only saw Cassidy just before the games. 
</P>
<P>
"An assistant coach came to your room and talked to you and laughed, but not 
the head coach," Brown said. "We had quite a few team meetings, though. You 
were allowed to speak up, but he (Cassidy) was stubborn. Nothing anyone tells 
him would change his mind." 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy acknowledges that he doesn't get close to his players, but he believes 
that is the role of a head coach. "When you are the head guy, players are less 
apt to come to you with their problems and concerns," the 56-year-old coach 
said. "They go to an assistant to buffer that. The head coach seems to be put 
up there. I don't think he puts himself up there. 
</P>
<P>
"The age difference doesn't mean I can't help them, but do you think I'm going 
to hang out with them? I don't think so. I want them with their peers. I have 
three children. When they have a party at the house, they don't want mom and 
pop around." 
</P>
<P>
Mazurie, another player who clashed with Cassidy, found himself in much the 
same situation as Brown during the recruiting process. "I never really talked 
to (Cassidy)," the 1989 graduate of Capistrano Valley High said. 
</P>
<P>
"I dealt with Coach Smith and Coach (former assistant Dave) Fehte. But it 
didn't matter. How do you know a coach until you are in practice? It is like a 
crap-shoot." 
</P>
<P>
A reserve, Mazurie averaged 7.3 points and two assists a game. He was on a 
short leash, however. On several occasions, he was yanked out of the lineup 
after his first mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Smith thought enough of Mazurie, however, to recruit him to Eastern Washington, 
but Mazurie chose San Luis Obispo to stay closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of scoring, McDaniels' loss was the greatest. He averaged 11 points, 
second-best on the team behind Derrick Gathers, whose eligibility ran out. 
</P>
<P>
"The last two seasons we were walking in place," McDaniels said. "The program 
wasn't going in any direction. Then Sandy Brown, my best friend, got cut so I 
didn't want to play. I wasn't going to play at all, but the Bakersfield coaches 
said I could go there." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't easy leaving. 
</P>
<P>
"That was my home and I was comfortable there academically," said McDaniels, a 
graduate of Chatsworth High. "Coach Cassidy told me he'd like to have me, but 
if I wanted to go, he wouldn't stop me. Coach Smith wanted me to stay, for what 
reason I don't know because he was leaving." 
</P>
<P>
At 6-foot-8 and 235 pounds, Rosenberg gave the Matadors the size they 
desperately needed. But instead of posting up for CSUN for four years, 
Rosenberg is toiling at UC Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"I was unhappy, but I don't really think it was the methods or the coaches," 
Rosenberg said. "I believe there wasn't a proper amount of respect between the 
players as a group and the coach. It is nothing against him. I like Coach 
Cassidy. A lot of it was (lack of) chemistry. It wasn't working out too well. 
All the guys got along, but I don't think we were really brought together as a 
family. There was the players and there was the head coach and when it came 
time to play basketball, then we were together." 
</P>
<P>
While Rosenberg's loss was softened by the return of 6-7, 300-pound center Todd 
Bowser, Henry's absence is critical in light of Humphrey's departure. 
</P>
<P>
"I left because I wasn't going to be given an opportunity to play, even though 
I was playing well," said Henry, who guided the team to six of its 12 wins in a 
starting role. "I hadn't decided to quit until (Cassidy) told me I'd be 
starting from the bottom," Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had a problem with (Cassidy). I got along with him. But he is not a 
motivator. He motivates by threatening you that you are not going to play." 
</P>
<P>
Another factor was Cassidy's decision not to give Henry scholarship money. 
</P>
<P>
"In Division I, if you give a guy a dollar that counts as a scholarship used," 
said Cassidy, who is limited to 15 players on scholarship but has funds for 
only 10. "In my opinion, I couldn't afford to do that. I'm sure he's upset but 
I felt I had to do it." 
</P>
<P>
McLinn too is still attending CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of rumors that (Cassidy) is not supposed to be coach next 
year," said McLinn, a sophomore from Taft High. "I felt I would sit out a year 
and see what happens. If he is still the coach, maybe I'll transfer; if there 
is a new coach, I'll try out." 
</P>
<P>
Two-time all-conference forward Pat Bolden, who played from 1984-88, had no 
problems with Cassidy, but that wasn't the case with the rest of the team. 
"People had a hard time learning his system and they griped about (lack of) 
playing time," said Bolden, who is trying out for the Omaha Racers of the 
Continental Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it had to do with his substitution pattern. We had some players that 
were a little more athletic on the bench and maybe some of them deserved to be 
on the court, but Cassidy wants you to think and he demands a specific role 
from each guy. He might start a role player over someone with more athletic 
ability." 
</P>
<P>
Bolden also pointed out that Cassidy's offensive style didn't jibe with those 
of some players. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it was 10 passes before you could shoot it," Bolden said. "If you 
came from a running program, that was a tough transition." 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors went 20-10 and won the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. title 
in Bolden's freshman year. "We had excellent chemistry," he said. "Not just in 
practice. We were friends. We played ball with each other all the time." 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors would finish no higher than fourth in the conference during their 
stay in Division II. 
</P>
<P>
James Carr, a reserve from 1985-87, enjoyed an amicable relationship with 
Cassidy and contends that many of his teammates did not have a realistic view 
of their abilities. His criticism is limited to a belief that Cassidy harnessed 
Bolden and that Cassidy should have been more involved with recruiting. "A lot 
of guys came here expecting something and they got a controlled style that they 
didn't like," Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, those players could have investigated the program more 
closely before signing their national letter of intent. "I explained that we 
were a medium-tempo team," Smith said. "We tried to run, if the shot wasn't 
there, we worked it around." 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy says the backlash is natural. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't always say yes when they walk through this door," he said. "They come 
in for playing time and more (scholarship) money. 
</P>
<P>
"My hands are tied (financially) and I can't always help them. Naturally, they 
are bitter and say you can't communicate. I have a hard time dealing with lazy, 
self-centered players who don't pay attention. So you become like a parent 
scolding them when they don't fulfill their potential. Naturally, I'm labeled a 
bad guy. But I hold no bitterness toward them. They are too young to hold 
bitterness toward."

CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE BASKETBALL EXODUS 
</P>
<P>
Brooklyn McLinn: Guard 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore: Not Playing 
</P>
<P>
McLinn (6-foot, 150 pounds) played in eight games as a walk-on for the Matadors 
last season and scored only four points. He still attends school at Northridge 
but says he will not try out for basketball again unless a coaching change is 
made. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Andre Henry: Guard 
</P>
<P>
Junior: Not Playing 
</P>
<P>
Henry (6-0, 145) appeared in 20 games and started nine at the point guard 
position last season. He played well when Eugene Humphrey, CSUN's starter, was 
sidelined because of an injury, but by the end of the season Henry's playing 
time had dramatically diminished. He averaged 1.5 points and 2.2 assists a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jemarl Baker: Guard 
</P>
<P>
Senior: Not Playing 
</P>
<P>
Baker (6-2, 165) started all but one game for the Matadors last season and led 
the team in scoring twice. He was third on the team in scoring with an average 
of 9.1 points a game. The two-year starter was among CSUN's best defensive 
players. He decided in September not to return because of family 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kendell McDaniels: Forward 
</P>
<P>
Junior: Bakersfield 
</P>
<P>
McDaniels (6-4, 210) was the top scorer among players who were supposed to 
return. He led the Matadors in scoring six times and averaged 11 points and 6.4 
rebounds while shooting 54.3%. McDaniels left CSUN after becoming disenchanted 
with the coaching staff's treatment of his friend and teammate, Sandy Brown. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bill Mazurie: Swingman 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore: San Luis Obispo 
</P>
<P>
Mazurie (6-2, 175) played in all 27 games last season. He led CSUN freshmen 
with a scoring average of 7.3 and was fourth on the team in assists (58) and 
steals (20). After the season, Mazurie was encouraged by CSUN coaches not to 
return and he transferred to Division II Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eugene Humphrey: Guard 
</P>
<P>
Senior: Not Playing 
</P>
<P>
The starting point guard last season, Humphrey (6-0, 162) left CSUN on Nov. 6 
to spend more time on academics. He averaged 6.9 points, led the team with 73 
assists and was CSUN's best free-throw shooter, making 38 of 44. The loss of 
Humphrey forced Keith Gibbs to move from shooting guard to point guard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sandy Brown: Swingman 
</P>
<P>
Junior: Occidental 
</P>
<P>
Brown (6-6, 160) appeared in all but one of CSUN's games last season and 
started three games. He averaged 5.3 points and two rebounds. Brown transferred 
to Division III Occidental College after being told by CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy 
that his skills were inferior to those of players Northridge was recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shanan Rosenberg: Center 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore: UC Davis 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg (6-8, 235) played in 16 games last season. After averaging 3.1 points 
and 1.8 rebounds in limited appearances, he missed the second semester because 
of academic ineligibility. Rosenberg claimed that Northridge players and 
coaches lacked mutual respect.

GRIMES CHANGES COACHING JOBS AT N. HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
North Hollywood High's Fred Grimes switched hats Tuesday, resigning as football 
coach and accepting an offer to take over as baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Grimes, who compiled a 23-22-1 record over five seasons as football coach, said 
he resigned because of personal reasons and will begin seeking a transfer to an 
L.A. Unified School District campus that is closer to his home in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Grimes, 42, said he expects to coach the baseball team for one season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to spend more time with my family," said Grimes, who played 
quarterback at Valley College and Cal State Northridge from 1971-74. "I'm 
hoping to transfer to a school in the West Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Grimes said his resignation had nothing to do with previous staffing problems. 
Two seasons ago, Grimes was the lone on-campus coach for both the varsity and B 
football teams. This season, North Hollywood hired two on-campus coaches for 
the B team as well as a varsity assistant. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies finished 5-4 overall and third in East Valley League play. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, the situation is as solid as it's been since I got here," Grimes 
said. "I just want to give them as much lead time as possible to find a new 
coach. Hopefully, they can find a guy to come in for spring ball." 
</P>
<P>
Grimes said he has not recommended a successor. 
</P>
<P>
Grimes assumes control of a baseball team that finished 10-12 and advanced to 
the City Section 4-A Division playoffs last season. Grimes coached baseball at 
Manual Arts from 1975-78 and at St. Genevieve from 1979-80. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Biegel, who coached the baseball team for one season as a walk-on last 
spring, recently informed the school that he would not return. 
</P>
<P>
James Lippett, an assistant varsity football coach, will help Grimes with the 
baseball program and will coach the junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
"It allowed us to keep it in-house and that's what we really wanted to do," 
second-year Athletic Director Jim Szabo said of Grimes' hiring. 
</P>
<P>
Lippett appears to be the leading candidate to replace Grimes as football coach 
because he has worked in the program and is an on-campus teacher. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood has had trouble hiring coaches because the school has not had 
openings for physical education teachers. That problem will be alleviated to an 
extent when former head football and baseball Coach Fred Neilson retires in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Szabo also announced that Sherwin Boucher will coach the softball team. 
Boucher, a math teacher, will leave his position as boys' tennis coach to run 
the softball program. Boucher also coached girls' volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
The tennis position will be filled by Joe Trahan, an on-campus teacher who has 
experience coaching tennis.

RUSH LEADS 2ND-HALF CHARGE AS VALLEY WOMEN WIN, 62-40 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tisa Rush, an all-state player two seasons ago who missed last season because 
of academic problems, scored 16 of her game-high 19 points in the second half 
to lead the Valley College women's basketball team to a 62-40 nonconference win 
over visiting Cerritos on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 23-22, at halftime, Valley (3-0) outscored Cerritos, 40-17, in the 
second half behind Rush, a 5-foot-3 guard from Kennedy High. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Rocha, a sophomore from North Hollywood High, added 14 points and 
former Burroughs star Wendy Bruse grabbed a team-high 12 rebounds and scored 
six points. 
</P>
<P>
Former Van Nuys High player Stacie Toon added eight points and 10 rebounds for 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos (3-2) committed 20 turnovers, 12 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
In another game: 
</P>
<P>
Cal State San Bernardino 69, The Master's 37 -- Junior forward Sandrine Rocher, 
who played at Valley College and North Hollywood High, scored a game-high 23 
points to lead Cal State San Bernardino in a nonconference game at Master's. 
</P>
<P>
Rocher was the leading scorer by far. No other Cal State San Bernardino player 
had more than 10 points and, although nine Master's players scored, Jaci Harris 
led the Mustangs with eight points. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs shot just 19% from the field (12 for 63) and were outrebounded, 
53-27. 
</P>
<P>
Master's trailed, 38-17, at halftime after making just five of 26 field-goal 
attempts. San Bernardino outscored the Mustangs in the second half, 31-20. 
</P>
<P>
Master's fell to 0-3. Cal State San Bernardino improved to 1-2.

Brett Hull, the NHL's top goal scorer, hit two posts and didn't put the puck in 
the net, but the Blues started a new winning streak Tuesday night at St. Louis 
with a 4-2 victory over the Winnipeg Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Gino Cavallini scored with 5:47 left in regulation to break a 2-2 tie and 
avenge the Blues' 4-3 loss to Winnipeg Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
That defeat, in which Hull scored twice, had ended St. Louis' six-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Ron Wilson clinched the victory when he scored into an empty net 
with 10 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Serge Momasso put the Jets in a tie, 2-2, at 11:41 of the final period. 
</P>
<P>
Hull had five shots in the first period, when the Blues had eight shots in one 
two-minute power play. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave it back to us tonight," Jet left wing Doug Evans said. "They played 
the third period the way we did the other night." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3, Edmonton 1 -- The Oilers had reason to feel pretty good after 
winning three in a row at Edmonton. But the Blackhawks, the hottest team in the 
NHL, quickly changed that. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago, which dominated from the start, extended its unbeaten streak to eight 
games (6-0-2). DAN HAFNER

SWEET STAYING WITH DECISION TO PLAY BASKETBALL AT ARIZONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The announcement last week that North Hollywood High basketball standout 
Jacinda Sweet had signed a letter of intent with Arizona was supposed to end 
the phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
It did, but only from coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since, North Hollywood Coach Rich Allen has been inundated with calls from 
newspapers, network television and cable sports programs. They all ask the same 
question: Why did Sweet, who is black, decide to attend Arizona in light of the 
controversy over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday? 
</P>
<P>
Sweet said this week that she had based her decision solely on the strength of 
the Wildcat program. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked it from the start," she said. "I won't change my mind because of that 
(holiday issue)." 
</P>
<P>
Allen said last week that Sweet expressed concern over the results of the 
state's recent election in which voters rejected a ballot initiative that would 
have created a paid holiday on King's birthday. Some believed that the outcome 
was a reflection of the state's position on the issue of race. Sweet decided to 
see for herself. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing like that's going to stop me," she said. "It's none of anybody else's 
business -- they don't have to live there for four years." 
</P>
<P>
Allen said Sweet told him that had she decided not to sign with the school she 
believed that she would be running away from the problem. And since she is 
black, she felt strongly that she should address the situation head-on, Allen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll just have to see for myself," Sweet said.

COURTS: JURORS SPLIT, 10 TO 2, OVER WHETHER OR NOT THE LA JOLLA SOCIALITE MEANT

<P>
With two jurors seeking a manslaughter conviction and 10 pressing for murder, 
the trial of La Jolla socialite Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick, accused of 
killing her ex-husband and his new wife, ended abruptly Tuesday with a hung 
jury and no verdict. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Thomas J. Whelan declared a mistrial when the 
panel reported Tuesday afternoon, after four days of deliberations, that it 
could not decide between murder and manslaughter. The deadlock means that the 
case resulted -- like five other high-profile San Diego trials in recent years 
-- in indecision. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick smiled briefly as the judge declared the mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
In court, jurors did not disclose the details of the deadlock. But one juror 
who asked not to be identified said Tuesday night that two of the people on the 
panel were seeking a manslaughter conviction, while 10 others pressed for 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
The voting started off at 7 to 5 in favor of murder, said juror Michael A. 
(Mickey) Byrd, 39, of Rancho Bernardo, an industrial project manager. 
</P>
<P>
By Monday, the count had reached 10 to 2, he said, and the panel stuck there. 
The sticking point, Byrd said, was over the issue of "malice," or whether Betty 
Broderick had the premeditated intent to kill. 
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday, said Byrd, who supported a murder conviction, "all agreed that we 
had reached a point of no return, basically." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor in the case, Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells, said she was "very 
disappointed" and that Betty Broderick is likely to go to trial again in the 
Nov. 5, 1989, killings of her ex-husband, Daniel T. Broderick III, and his 
second wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick. 
</P>
<P>
A new trial date is to be set next Tuesday. San Diego County Dist. Atty. Edwin 
Miller said Tuesday night that he and Wells will decide in the next few days 
whether to go forward with a second trial. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick's daughter, Kim Broderick, 20, a sophomore at the University of 
Arizona who testified against her mother at the trial, said she was "frustrated 
and mad." She added: "I just wanted this to be behind us." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Jack Earley said the hung jury was "not a real surprise" and 
added that he plans now to ask that Betty Broderick be freed on bail. He also 
said he is amenable to plea bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Earley said, "This has been a vindication that Betty Broderick 
is not what she has been pictured to be." 
</P>
<P>
Saying Betty Broderick had been successful at the trial in persuading at least 
some jurors that she had been a victim, too, and contending that she was guilty 
at most of manslaughter, Earley said it was "obvious" that jurors "saw some of 
the things she saw and felt some of the things she felt." 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick declined to comment, saying: "I'm still in custody. I'm not 
supposed to talk." 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick, 43, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the 
shooting deaths of her ex-husband and his second wife. She has been held 
without bail at the Las Colinas Jail in Santee since she surrendered to police 
only hours after the killings. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Broderick, who was 44, was a prominent medical malpractice attorney and 
a former president of the San Diego County Bar Assn. Linda Kolkena Broderick, 
who was 28, was his office assistant. 
</P>
<P>
After 16 years of marriage, Daniel and Betty Broderick separated. During and 
after a bitter divorce, Betty Broderick accused him of using his legal 
influence to cheat her out of her fair share of his seven-figure annual income. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick admits firing the shots that killed her ex-husband and his 
second wife. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying in her own defense, she contended at the trial that she did not have 
the premeditation the law requires for first-degree murder because she intended 
only to confront him and to kill herself last Nov. 5, when she stole into his 
house before dawn. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Wells contends that Betty Broderick fully intended the killings and 
executed her ex-husband and his new wife after years of rising rage that 
stemmed from the divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors had five options in the case -- first- and second-degree murder, 
voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, and not guilty on any charges. 
</P>
<P>
First-degree murder means the murder was premeditated -- or considered 
beforehand -- while second-degree lacks that deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
Voluntary manslaughter means a killing was committed after a sudden 
provocation. Involuntary manslaughter describes a killing that occurs while 
doing something else without due caution. 
</P>
<P>
After passing a note saying that the jury was "unable to reach a unanimous 
decision," foreman Lucinda L. Swann, 26, of San Diego, a county air pollution 
inspector, told Whelan in court Tuesday that the panel could not decide whether 
the case was about murder or manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Whelan sent the panel back for more talks but, 29 minutes later, the jury 
returned, saying that it was unable to break the deadlock and that further 
talks were unlikely to help. 
</P>
<P>
Swann said that the panel took "three or four" votes but, after conferring with 
others on the jury, said the others "seem to feel it was more than half a 
dozen." 
</P>
<P>
Whelan then declared a mistrial, telling the panel it was "a shame that you 
can't have a final resolution, but that's the way things sometimes end up." 
</P>
<P>
In interviews later Tuesday, jurors declined to explain whether the 10 who 
favored murder believed it was first- or second-degree. Similarly, jurors did 
not say whether the two urging a lesser charge sought voluntary or involuntary 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Wells said the outcome was "hugely frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, obviously there were a lot of emotional issues in this case, a lot of 
opinions going both ways," she said. "Finding 12 people who were going to agree 
was going to be difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Wells also said she did not know what she would do differently in a second 
trial because she wanted to talk to jurors to find out what worked and what 
didn't the first time around. She said she would rethink tactical decisions she 
made, like not asking Betty Broderick on cross-examination about the act of the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously I'll be open to thinking about lots of different things," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Earley said a second trial would be burdensome. 
</P>
<P>
With no income and limited assets, Betty Broderick might not be able to afford 
a second trial, Earley said. Still, he said, "I will be there. She wants me as 
her attorney and I like her as a client." 
</P>
<P>
Tactically, he said, the difficulty for the defense the second time around is 
that prosecutors know the strengths and weaknesses of the defense case. "It's 
just distressing to know you're at square one again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, five other high-profile San Diego criminal trials have 
resulted in a hung jury on some or all charges -- among them the cases against 
Roger Hedgecock, Sagon Penn, Craig Peyer and Richard T. Silberman. In the case 
of Nancy Hoover Hunter, the jury was hung on the vast majority of charges. 
</P>
<P>
Like their cases, Earley said, the frustration is in realizing that a lengthy 
trial has not yet yielded closure in Betty Broderick's case. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like it's been going on forever," he said.

WHITE HOUSE PAYS PRICE FOR HARD SELL TO SOVIETS ON GULF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In making decisions from offering jobs in his Cabinet to negotiating treaties 
with foreign powers -- White House aides try always to follow one rule: Never 
put the President in a position where he is publicly rebuffed. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, that rule was broken in the most public of circumstances: In the 
bright spotlight of an international summit meeting, President Bush went into a 
one-on-one meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev expecting to get 
public endorsement for a tough new U.N. resolution approving military force 
against Iraq. Instead, he emerged embarrassingly and all too publicly 
empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
How could such a thing happen? 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his aides insisted that in a few days, Monday night's embarrassment 
will fade. "Just be patient, and all will be well," Bush told reporters here 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"What you're going to see in the end is that this is all irrelevant," said his 
press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Bush aides acknowledged privately, they are learning that it does not 
pay to get too far ahead of the Soviets on the Persian Gulf crisis, and 
Monday's stumble was another reminder that the President cannot separate 
international maneuvering from domestic politics. 
</P>
<P>
Just as every remark about the gulf that Bush may make for domestic political 
reasons echoes around the world, every step he takes on the international stage 
has repercussions at home. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, White House aides, aware that domestic support for Bush's 
policies has dwindled ever since he announced the sending of an additional 
200,000 troops to the gulf, badly wanted a major foreign policy success to stop 
the erosion. 
</P>
<P>
Tacitly, they acknowledged Tuesday that they tried to push Gorbachev just a 
step too far and too soon. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, facing his own nearly overwhelming domestic political problems, has 
been assiduously clinging to his image as an international peacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
And the conflict between the two men's aims were at the root of Monday's 
problems, both U.S. and Soviet officials say. 
</P>
<P>
As he seeks to crank up the pressure on Iraqi President Hussein, the political 
importance for Bush of maintaining strong international support for his tactics 
is hard to overstate. In conducting his gulf policy, Bush begins with roughly 
one-third to one-quarter of the public firmly against him, according to the 
White House's own polls as well as surveys conducted by news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Among the majority of Americans who either support Bush's plans or are 
ambivalent about them, concern about international agreement runs extremely 
high. A Times Poll conducted last week, for example, showed that 81% of people 
surveyed felt the United States should definitely seek U.N. approval before 
taking military action against Iraq, a much higher percentage than those who 
felt Bush should seek congressional approval before sending troops into battle. 
</P>
<P>
And, asked whether the country should go to war even if other nations refused 
to do so, only 21% were willing to see the United States go it alone. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his aides are well aware of that sentiment. "That's why we're so 
concerned about consultations and why everything we do is in the context of 
U.N. resolutions," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
But unfortunately for Bush, other national leaders also have domestic political 
realities to deal with -- imperatives that can conflict with Bush's own. 
</P>
<P>
The confusion with Gorbachev was only the most public of several such problems 
Bush encountered during his five-day European visit. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, for example, Bush visited German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is 
facing an election in two weeks in a country that is deeply ambivalent about 
the prospect of war and about how deeply its citizens should be involved in any 
gulf conflict. Not surprisingly, given the domestic sentiment he faces, Kohl 
emphasized the need for negotiations with Iraq and the dangers of war. 
</P>
<P>
Although the actual policies of the Bush and Kohl governments do not conflict, 
the public messages of the two leaders were dissonant. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, when Bush arrived here for the beginning of the 34-nation Conference 
on Security and Cooperation in Europe, he publicly talked about how the CSCE 
summit meeting had been "overshadowed" by the conflict with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
That statement aptly described American sentiment -- few people in the United 
States, including Administration officials, have paid much attention to the 
CSCE. But the American attitude has irritated many Europeans, for whom the 
conference is an historic milestone, both a symbolic end to the Cold War 
division of the Continent and the opening of what many Europeans deeply hope 
will be a new era of peace for themselves and their children. 
</P>
<P>
Before the summit began, Administration officials had frequently suggested to 
reporters that the CSCE might issue a declaration denouncing Iraq. Many 
Europeans saw that as an unwelcome intrusion of an outside issue into a 
conference on Europe's future; and on Tuesday, the idea of a gulf declaration 
was dropped. Administration officials insisted publicly that a CSCE statement 
on the gulf had never been contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
With Gorbachev, according to both U.S. and Soviet sources, Bush's problem was 
complicated by the peculiar dynamics of superpower summits. Bush has tried, in 
the five meetings he has had with the Soviet leader, to reduce public 
expectations that a superpower summit must produce major news developments. He 
has tried to schedule the meetings on short notice, to reduce the time for 
pre-summit hype. And he has repeatedly tried to describe the meetings as 
"routine." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, the White House has trouble resisting the temptation 
to use summit meetings to project an image of Bush as a forceful and dynamic 
world leader. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the contradiction between those two urges -- to diminish 
expectations from a superpower meeting while still milking them for publicity 
-- collided. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials announced that Bush would be meeting with Gorbachev that 
evening over dinner at the U.S. ambassador's residence. At the same time, they 
announced that the two leaders would hold a joint press conference. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the press conference would allow whatever news it produced to 
make the nightly television newscasts. With network anchors already on location 
here, Bush could count on dominating the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem was that by the time the press conference was announced, 
Soviet officials already had informed the Administration that Gorbachev was not 
interested in using the Paris summit as a forum for endorsing an anti-Iraq U.N. 
resolution. Bush and Gorbachev spoke in the late afternoon and decided against 
making a joint appearance, aides to both men said Tuesday. By then, however, 
reporters were already on their way. 
</P>
<P>
Now, said Fitzwater, "We're just going to have to pay the PR price."

THATCHER FORCED INTO RUNOFF VOTE; 
</P>
<P>
BRITAIN: THE PRIME MINISTER FAILS BY A TWO-VOTE MARGIN TO GAIN A FIRST-BALLOT 
PARTY LEADERSHIP VICTORY OVER HESELTINE. A SHOWDOWN IS SET FOR NEXT WEEK. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in a sharp setback to her leadership 
of the Conservative Party, failed to gain the necessary votes for a 
first-ballot victory Tuesday and will face former Defense Secretary Michael 
Heseltine in a runoff election next week. 
</P>
<P>
In the most serious threat to her political career, Thatcher won more votes 
than Heseltine in the balloting by Conservative members of Parliament, but she 
failed by a two-vote margin to win an outright victory. 
</P>
<P>
When it was obvious that the prime minister had been forced into a runoff, some 
Tories urged Heseltine to quit the contest in the interest of party unity, but 
he refused. Likewise, Heseltine supporters immediately called for Thatcher's 
resignation, but she declared Tuesday night that she would continue the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, I was very pleased I got more than half the vote but disappointed 
it was not quite enough to win on the first ballot," Thatcher told reporters at 
the British Embassy here. 
</P>
<P>
"So I confirm it is my intention to let my name go forward in the second 
round." 
</P>
<P>
Then, in evening dress, she drove off to a glittering dinner at Versailles 
Palace with 33 other national leaders who are here for the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
If Thatcher loses the leadership election, she would have to step down as prime 
minister after more than 11 years in office. She has been the longest 
continuously serving British leader in this century. 
</P>
<P>
Even if she wins next week, she will emerge much weakened as a political leader 
because of the lukewarm support for her within her own party. 
</P>
<P>
The vote threw London into political turmoil. The absence of a clear-cut 
victory for the party leadership was, in the words of Transport Secretary Cecil 
Parkinson, "the worst possible result for the party." 
</P>
<P>
And many other Tory leaders sounded that theme. They fear that another 
fractious week of in-fighting between the Thatcher and Heseltine camps would 
irreparably damage the Conservative Party in the run-up to the next general 
election, opening the door to the opposition Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservative Party holds its leadership election every year, but serious 
challenges to the party leader are rare, and the vote in recent years has 
amounted to a pro forma endorsement of Thatcher. This year's vote was a notable 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
The secret vote took place all day Tuesday in a committee room of the House of 
Commons, with the 372 Tory members casting ballots. 
</P>
<P>
The final count was Thatcher, 204; Heseltine, 152; abstentions or invalid 
ballots, 16. 
</P>
<P>
Under the complicated party voting rules, Thatcher's edge was not enough for an 
outright victory. She needed a majority plus 15%, which she missed by two 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
In next Tuesday's vote, only a simple majority is needed to win, but the 
election may be more complicated than a two-candidate affair, since others are 
allowed to run. They have until noon Thursday to declare their candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's fellow national leaders here at the Paris summit were puzzled by the 
fact that the prime minister, a senior world figure, had not been able to rally 
more support among Tory members of Parliament, even though she has won three 
national elections and the Falklands War. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock, whose party has led the Tories in public 
opinion polls for months, called the Thatcher government "disabled" Tuesday, 
presented a no-confidence motion in the House of Commons and called for an 
immediate general election. 
</P>
<P>
Left-wing Labor member of Parliament Dennis Skinner declared, "The Tory party 
is split, and Mrs. Thatcher is impaled on barbed wire." 
</P>
<P>
Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, called Thatcher a "lame-duck 
prime minister at the head of a broken-back government." 
</P>
<P>
Political observers in Parliament suggested that some Tory leaders may urge the 
65-year-old Thatcher to pull out of next Tuesday's race in order to prevent the 
humiliation that would result if she lost or only squeaked through. 
</P>
<P>
However, former Cabinet minister Norman Tebbit, one of Thatcher's staunchest 
supporters, pointed out that the prime minister received 55% of the vote and 
declared that Heseltine himself should be the one to quit. 
</P>
<P>
"People in other countries must wonder what sort of crazy game this is," Tebbit 
said. "She has won three elections, has a majority of 100 in the House. . . . 
Yet she is asked to stand down because she only gets 55% of the vote. They must 
think we are out of our minds." 
</P>
<P>
Some commentators suggested that either Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd or 
Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major should enter the second-round balloting 
as a stop-Heseltine measure. 
</P>
<P>
But Major said he would not run as long as Thatcher continued in the race. And 
Hurd issued a short statement declaring, "The prime minister continues to have 
my full support, and I'm sorry this destructive, unnecessary contest should be 
prolonged in this way." 
</P>
<P>
The Thatcher-Heseltine struggle pitted long-time Conservative Party members of 
Parliament against one another. 
</P>
<P>
One lawmaker, Emma Nicholson, said, "In the next round, we will vote a clear 
majority, and I hope Michael Heseltine will win." 
</P>
<P>
Former Cabinet Minister Nicholas Ridley attributed Thatcher's poor showing to 
the fact that after 11 years in office, "you have MPs with grudges and 
jealousies -- I think 55% is a pretty good figure." 
</P>
<P>
A number of Tory lawmakers said the party will rally around whoever is chosen 
next week, but they were mindful that the split in the party would undoubtedly 
affect its showing in the next elections. And the polls show that in a national 
election, the Conservatives would fare better under Heseltine than under 
Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher took the leadership in 1975 from Prime Minister Edward Heath and won 
the 1979, 1983 and 1988 national elections. The next one must be held within 18 
months, the precise date left to the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher has been criticized by many in Parliament for her imperious style of 
governing, attributed as one of the reasons for the resignation two weeks ago 
of her deputy prime minister, party stalwart Geoffrey Howe. 
</P>
<P>
Heseltine, 57, a self-made millionaire, was environment secretary in Thatcher's 
first Cabinet in 1979 and was named defense secretary in 1983. He resigned from 
the Cabinet in 1986, specifically criticizing the prime minister's opposition 
to a vigorous British role in the European Community as well as the unpopular 
local community taxes that she had introduced. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls show that Heseltine would be the strongest contender the Tories 
could field against Kinnock and the Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Thatcher supporters say she has badly trailed in the opinion polls 
before and still come back to win large majorities. 
</P>
<P>
They argue that she has 18 months to reduce inflation and interest rates, sort 
out the tax problem and go into another election in much better shape than she 
is in today. 
</P>
<P>
In the event that three or more candidates are entered in next week's 
second-round balloting and no one gains an absolute majority, the three leaders 
would go into a final runoff two days later.

U.S. PRESSES FOR SOVIET SUPPORT OF U.N. ACTION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush mounted a full-court press at the Paris summit Tuesday to win 
Soviet support for a tough new United Nations resolution authorizing military 
action against Iraq, but Administration officials said success still is not 
within their immediate grasp. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III met late into the night with Soviet 
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in an effort to forge agreement on a 
new U.N. resolution. Even though Bush failed to win his way on gulf tactics, he 
is apparently on the verge of gaining another important success in the field of 
arms control. U.S. and Soviet officials announced that Bush and Gorbachev will 
hold a summit meeting in Moscow early next year, at which they are expected to 
sign a long-awaited treaty reducing strategic armaments. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief session with reporters after their meeting, Baker and Shevardnadze 
emphasized that the United States and the Soviet Union remain united in their 
basic commitment to oppose Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and drive his forces 
from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
But while the Soviets said once more that they do not rule out the use of force 
as a last resort, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said in an interview 
with French television that the solution to the Persian Gulf crisis "must be 
political." 
</P>
<P>
And, while denouncing the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in strong terms and saying 
it is time for the U.N. Security Council to reassess the situation in the gulf, 
Gorbachev made clear that he is not now prepared to come out for a resolution 
authorizing a military offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had hoped to win a public endorsement for such a resolution from Gorbachev 
during the three-day meeting of the 34-nation Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, which ends here today. The Administration sees such a 
step, combined with its decision to dramatically increase the size of the U.S. 
force in the gulf region, as a way of ratcheting up the pressure on Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
The gap between Washington and Moscow on gulf tactics is not necessarily a 
permanent one. Gorbachev's statement Tuesday suggested that the differences 
with Bush may be primarily ones of timing. 
</P>
<P>
"All political leaders aspire to avoid a military solution," the Soviet leader 
declared in the interview with French television. "I have the feeling that's 
the essence, but we cannot tolerate Saddam Hussein and his regime bringing the 
world community to its knees. That is unacceptable, and I am persuaded that we 
will reach a solution in the interest of all nations." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has also insisted that he wants a peaceful settlement, but he considers 
U.N. authorization of military action crucial to his campaign to intensify 
pressure on Iraq and maintain the international alliance against it.

Bush leaves here today for Saudi Arabia, where he will spend Thanksgiving Day 
visiting American military forces and conferring with King Fahd about military 
strategy in the gulf standoff. The President will visit Cairo on Friday to see 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, one of the strongest allies in the 
multinational military force confronting Iraq, before returning to Washington 
later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of Bush's visit to Saudi Arabia, White House Press Secretary 
Marlin Fitzwater said, will be to visit U.S. commanders and their troops, 
"seeing firsthand the deployment of our forces, the kinds of difficulties that 
they face in the desert, offering them support and assurances that the American 
people are behind them." 
</P>
<P>
At the summit here, Bush also held an hourlong closed-door session with 
President Turgut Ozal of Turkey, and Fitzwater later said the President "noted 
that Turkey is showing real leadership in the international response to Iraq's 
aggression against Kuwait and that the United States is committed to helping 
Turkey to deal with the effects of that situation on Turkey." 
</P>
<P>
After the session, Bush said: "Turkey and the United States are side by side in 
this, and nobody has been more steadfast than the Turks and Mr. Ozal. So I have 
no complaints, only gratitude. Glad we're together on this one." 
</P>
<P>
The President also accepted an invitation to visit Turkey sometime early next 
year, perhaps in conjunction with the Moscow summit trip. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, clearly irritated by a reporter's question about whether he had any 
complaints about lack of Soviet support for the proposed U.N. resolution, 
declared, "Just be patient, and all will be well." 
</P>
<P>
And a senior Administration official, requesting anonymity, insisted that Bush 
is "very close" to persuading the Soviets to publicly endorse the proposed 
resolution. "But we know from experience we had better not say too much about 
an agreement with the Soviets until they are ready to have it announced," the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
During another of several bilateral sessions here, Bush thanked Polish Prime 
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki for his country's support of the U.N. opposition to 
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and for sending a hospital ship and a rescue 
ship to the area. They also discussed Poland's severe debt problem during their 
20-minute session, and Bush pledged that the United States would "seriously" 
address the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The CSCE summit, hailed by leaders of all 34 nations in attendance as a 
symbolic ending of the Cold War, included Monday's signing of a treaty 
providing for a massive reduction of conventional arms. But the potentially 
explosive Persian Gulf crisis -- with the United States lobbying for the U.N. 
resolution and President Hussein announcing additional hostage releases and a 
massive new buildup of Iraqi forces in Kuwait -- overshadowed all other 
developments here. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, after his meeting with Shevardnadze, was asked about Washington's 
failure to win a Soviet endorsement of the proposed resolution. "We should not 
jump to conclusions, because we might be wrong if we jump to conclusions," he 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he agreed with Baker, Shevardnadze said, "I wish to subscribe to 
everything the secretary has just said. Indeed, that is our common approach, 
and we took that approach from the very first day of the aggression. We shared 
a common platform, we acted together, and we continue to act the same way in 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
However, at a press briefing, Fitzwater made it clear that the Americans and 
Soviets had not only failed to agree on a timetable for a U.N. resolution 
authorizing a military offensive, but the Soviets had not even agreed that such 
a resolution would be useful. 
</P>
<P>
"Is the discussion about whether or not to have the resolution, or is the 
discussion about what the resolution is going to say?" Fitzwater was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it's all of the above," he replied. "The discussion concerns the value 
of a resolution, the need for it, what approach it might take, what its 
usefulness would be, how it would strengthen the alliance, what its formulation 
under the U.N. resolutions would be -- all of those aspects." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater emphasized that in their negotiations for a tough new U.N. 
resolution, U.S. officials are discussing several alternative approaches, but 
he said he could not discuss any proposed language while the country-by-country 
consultations are under way. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials have said that at least seven of the 15 members of the 
U.N. Security Council have pledged support for a new resolution and that they 
hope to line up near-unanimous support before requesting council approval. 
Secretary of State Baker plans to visit three other members -- Yemen, Colombia 
and Malaysia -- during the next three days. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said that, while the United States does not have a "hard and fast" 
timetable to get U.N. approval of the resolution, it still hopes to win 
approval before the end of this month, when the United States will relinquish 
chairmanship of the Security Council to Yemen, a Persian Gulf state bordering 
on Saudi Arabia that has sided with Iraq in the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The People's Republic of China, as well as the Soviet Union, has been 
counseling caution and patience in the gulf, but Fitzwater said Washington has 
"a very satisfactory understanding with the Chinese." Baker spoke to China's 
foreign minister Tuesday morning and said that "we feel very good about that 
situation."

WILSON NAMES FINANCE CHIEF, HINTS AT TAX HIKE; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: DEFEATED TREASURER HAYES IS SELECTED. HIGHER LEVIES DEPEND ON FISCAL 
REFORM, SENATOR SAYS.

<TEXT>
<P>
With the state's budget problems mounting almost daily, Gov.-elect Pete Wilson 
on Tuesday named defeated state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes as his finance 
director and set the stage for a tax increase to cope with what he called 
California's "fiscal emergency." 
</P>
<P>
Only hours after Wilson's announcement, a state finance commission chaired by 
Hayes released a forecast projecting not only a deficit in the current budget 
year, but a potential shortfall of $4.3 billion for Wilson's first full year in 
office -- far greater than earlier estimates. That is the amount of new money 
needed to continue existing services for the next fiscal year and rebuild a 
$1.4-billion emergency reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also expressed doubts that the Legislature would approve Gov. George 
Deukmejian's proposal to cut $1 billion from this year's budget. The 
governor-elect said that he and Hayes will begin immediately to draft their own 
plan to present to lawmakers on or before Jan. 7, when Wilson takes office. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows, I think, where every nickel of state funds is spent; he knows how it 
is spent," Wilson said of Hayes, who was the Legislature's auditor general for 
10 years before Deukmejian appointed him treasurer in late 1988. "His expertise 
and his character, I think, will go a very long way in helping us to deal with 
the very great challenges we do face." 
</P>
<P>
The Wilson team also will begin reviewing the Deukmejian Administration's 
proposed budget for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1. Wilson will 
inherit that plan and is required to present his version of the proposal to the 
Legislature by Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he does not think the voters are "in the mood" for new taxes, but 
he added that he will give "very, very careful consideration" to higher 
revenues. He indicated that he might accept a tax increase if the 
Democratic-controlled Legislature agrees to change laws that restrict the way 
state government spends the taxpayers' dollars. 
</P>
<P>
First, there must be "significant budget reform," Wilson said. "That is going 
to involve cutting." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson would not specify what kinds of tax increases he would consider or 
define his version of "reform." He hinted that he would like to dismantle some 
or all of the constraints that voters and past Legislatures have placed on the 
budget process. During the campaign, Wilson suggested suspending or repealing 
Proposition 98, the voter-approved constitutional provision that guarantees 
schools about 40% of the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
"There probably is a fiscal emergency," Wilson said. "If we don't achieve 
reforms, we will be faced with doing some (program cuts) that will be 
politically repugnant for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
In making Hayes his first major appointment as governor-elect, Wilson confirmed 
speculation that his Administration will include a few familiar faces from the 
Deukmejian years. At the same time, in Hayes he has chosen a moderate, career 
public servant with close ties to the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Finance director is probably the most important job Wilson will fill in his 
Administration, next to his chief of staff. Hayes will help his new boss set 
priorities for taxes and spending and make decisions that will spill over into 
health and welfare, education, environmental policy and other crucial areas. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, 44, replaced longtime Treasurer Jesse M. Unruh, who died in office. As 
treasurer, Hayes has been responsible for the state's $20-billion investment 
portfolio and has served on more than 40 boards and commissions dealing with 
state financial management. 
</P>
<P>
A soft-spoken Marine Corps veteran, Hayes was never politically active before 
becoming treasurer. He registered with a political party -- the Republicans -- 
for the first time in his life in order to seek election to the job in his own 
right. Hayes lost that race to Democrat Kathleen Brown, with whom he will now 
have to work occasionally in his new job. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also named two of Hayes' deputies at the treasurer's office -- Susanne 
Burton and Russell Gould -- to assist him at the Finance Department. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes sent Gould to represent him at Tuesday's meeting of the Commission on 
State Finance, the seven-member panel that issued its pessimistic forecast on 
the budget. Even though a shortfall in next year's budget was expected, the 
size of the gap seemed to surprise some government officials. 
</P>
<P>
Controller Gray Davis, a member of the commission, said the magnitude of the 
problem is so great that Wilson and the Legislature should consider a two- or 
three-year budget solution, which could involve carrying over a deficit from 
one year to the next. 
</P>
<P>
"The size of the structural budget imbalance is staggering," said Davis, who 
did not attend the commission meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's report showed that the state will exhaust its budget reserve 
and be at least $30 million in the red by the end of the 1989-90 fiscal year if 
the Legislature does not act to remedy the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Greer Lyle, executive secretary of the commission, said the impending 
shortfall stems from lower than expected tax collections because of the 
downturn in the economy, and increased demands for state government services, 
particularly schools, prisons, health and welfare programs and money to service 
the state's growing debt. 
</P>
<P>
The $4.3-billion figure corresponds to the $3.6-billion shortfall the governor 
and Legislature wrestled with for most of last summer before settling on a 
combination of tax increases and budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Past budget practices appear to be coming back to haunt state officials. Last 
summer, Deukmejian and legislators agreed to defer payments to the state 
employees pension funds as part of the deal to close the $3.6-billion gap. Next 
year, state officials will have to come up with an additional $665-million 
pension payment. Principal and interest on the state's soaring debt load will 
require an additional $520 million, according to the commission's report. 
</P>
<P>
The report showed that over the next 10 years, revenue growth will average 
about 7.5% while spending demands will increase by 8.1%, a disparity that, if 
uncorrected, would produce shortfalls every year. 
</P>
<P>
Changes in the law to correct the imbalance can occur by increasing revenues or 
by reducing expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was not specific on what he will propose. Whatever approach he takes, he 
is likely to face an uphill fight. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans in the Legislature have generally attacked the problem from the 
expenditure side, believing the best way to correct the imbalance is by 
reducing allotments to health and welfare programs or curtailing spending in 
other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats have successfully fought such proposals, preferring instead to tackle 
the problem by boosting taxes. They argue that Californians during the 1970s 
and 1980s saw their tax burden reduced by tens of billions through measures 
such as Proposition 13 property tax cuts and reductions in the income tax. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats have been pressing for several years to return the top state income 
tax rate to 11%. It was dropped to 9.3% several years ago in a tax reform bill.

TAX BREAK? Did you buy a home within the last two years? The county assessor 
may -- repeat, may -- have good news for you. . . . Assuming the real estate 
slump continues through March, when the assessor reappraises property, the 
assessed value of your home could fall to match market conditions, a spokesman 
says. That would mean a lower tax bill. . . . But if you bought your house 
before 1989, forget it. Prop. 13 allows just a 2% assessment increase a year, 
so by now those houses are probably listed below market value, the spokesman 
says. Rose Ellen O'Connor and Mark I. Pinsky

JURY DEADLOCKED IN BRODERICK TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: THE JUDGE DECLARES A MISTRIAL WHEN THE JURORS CAN'T DECIDE IF LA JOLLA 
SOCIALITE IS GUILTY OF MURDER OR MANSLAUGHTER. SHE ADMITTED TO THE KILLINGS.

<P>
A mistrial was declared Tuesday in the case of La Jolla socialite Elisabeth 
(Betty) Broderick, who is accused of killing her ex-husband and his new wife. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Thomas Whelan declared the mistrial after the jury 
reported that it was deadlocked after four days of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before declaring the mistrial, Whelan sent the panel back to the jury 
room to consider whether there was anything the court could do to help it reach 
a decision. But jurors returned about 15 minutes later and reported themselves 
hopelessly deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
Whelan scheduled a hearing next Tuesday to discuss a new trial date. 
</P>
<P>
The defense admitted that Betty Broderick fired the fatal shots a year ago that 
killed prominent San Diego attorney Daniel Broderick, 44, and his second wife, 
Linda, 28. But defense attorneys contended Betty Broderick, 43, was driven to 
the shootings by years of emotional abuse from her ex-husband. Their 16-year 
marriage ended in a messy four-year divorce and child custody battle. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contended that Broderick was a jealous, vindictive woman who 
carried out what amounted to an execution after years of planning. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick displayed no emotion when the jury informed the judge of its 
inability to reach a verdict. Two of her four children, Kim, 20, and Lee, 19, 
who testified during the trial, stayed away from the courtroom and were with 
relatives in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing they were deadlocked, jurors indicated they could not decide 
whether the shootings were murder or manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Whelan thanked the jury for its service before discharging them. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it's a shame we can't have a final resolution but that's the way 
these things come out some times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick, 43, was taken back to the Las Colinas women's jail pending further 
court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors declined to comment to reporters and attorneys in the case. "I'm 
disappointed," Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells said. "I thought the evidence 
supported a verdict. Obviously there were a lot of emotional issues in this 
case. There has been a lot of opinion going both ways, so I knew it was going 
to be difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Jack Earley, who portrayed Betty Broderick as another victim 
in the case, said he was not surprised by the inability of the jury to reach an 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this is the kind of case where it would be easy to get a 
unanimous verdict," Earley said. 
</P>
<P>
The defense attorney said he would be receptive to negotiating a possible plea 
bargain to avoid going through a second trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, if they offered something I felt was appropriate, I would advise my 
client to take it," he said. "That would serve both ends without having to have 
another trial." 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate comment from prosecutors regarding a possible plea 
bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Earley has said he believes the Broderick case is a manslaughter rather than a 
murder case. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel and Linda Broderick were shot a year ago in the bedroom of their luxury 
Hillcrest-area home. Daniel Broderick, a former county bar president, and 
Linda, his 28-year-old wife of five months, were shot to death before sunrise 
on Nov. 5, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic evidence at the trial was presented by prosecuting attorney 
Wells when she played tape recordings of obscene phone messages the defendant 
left for Dan Broderick and their two young sons. 
</P>
<P>
In an especially searing message, Betty told Dan, "Stop screwing (Linda) long 
enough to return my calls," and then warned him, "You're making me mad. I'll 
kill you." 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick has been held without bail since she surrendered to police the 
day of the slayings. While she has admitted shooting the couple, she insisted 
she had gone to the house to kill herself and fired only when she was startled 
by shouts from Dan Broderick. 
</P>
<P>
Earley implored the jury to consider his client's mental state, saying: "You'll 
never find a woman who went through a divorce like she did." 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Dan and Linda Broderick, some of whom testified for the prosecution, 
had argued that Betty was a greedy, vicious woman who alienated Dan and then 
became obsessed with vengeance against him and Linda. 
</P>
<P>
A prosecution psychiatrist described Broderick as a "narcissistic, histrionic" 
woman who ruthlessly used her children as pawns in her quest for revenge.

LUNGREN'S LEAD NEARS 30,000 IN ATTORNEY GENERAL'S RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With a statewide tabulation of absentee ballots virtually completed, Republican 
state attorney general candidate Dan Lungren led Democrat Arlo Smith by a 
whisker-thin margin of just under 30,000 votes Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren, who had trailed Smith by almost 29,000 votes on election night two 
weeks ago, picked up 20,979 votes on his rival in Orange County this week after 
Smith dropped a lawsuit Friday challenging the vote-counting process in the 
conservative stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren declared victory last week after taking the lead by fewer than 10,000 
votes. But Smith has refused to concede and has a second lawsuit pending to 
invalidate virtually all absentee ballots across the state. 
</P>
<P>
The court action, which would put Smith back on top if successful, is set for a 
hearing Nov. 30 in Orange County Superior Court. Smith also is considering an 
unprecedented statewide recount. 
</P>
<P>
State election supervisors say they expect no further changes in their vote 
count until the final results are officially certified on Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Approximately 50,000 absentee ballots remain to be counted in counties across 
the state, they say. But even Smith's top aides acknowledge that Lungren still 
will be ahead after those votes are tabulated. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial totals released Tuesday showed Lungren with 3,384,590 votes -- 46.8% 
-- and Smith with 3,354,941 -- 46.4%. Libertarian candidate Paul N. Gautreau 
received 254,605 votes and Peace and Freedom Party candidate Robert J. Evans 
received 240,964 votes. 
</P>
<P>
In his pending lawsuit, the San Francisco district attorney charges that 
absentee ballots were counted without adequate anti-fraud safeguards.

INS RAIDS LATINO RIGHTS GROUP'S OFFICE IN AMNESTY FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. immigration agents have raided the Las Vegas offices of the president of 
the nation's largest Latino civil rights organization as part of an 
investigation into possible fraud involving amnesty applications from aliens in 
Southern California, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, who asked that their 
names not be used, said the investigation centered on allegations that Jose 
Velez, 53, president of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), 
reportedly received about $300,000 for helping in the filing of about 800 
amnesty applications. 
</P>
<P>
Velez allegedly turned in only 17 applications to the INS for processing, 
leaving the rest to collect dust in his immigration consulting office near the 
Las Vegas Strip, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The applications, mostly from aliens of Asian descent, were reportedly given to 
him by a West Covina woman, Aurora Barrientos, who was interested in seeing 
these aliens receive amnesty under the historic Immigration Reform and Control 
Act of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Some components of the amnesty program have been plagued by allegations of 
fraud, but Monday morning's raids were believed to be the first high-profile 
attempt to uncover fraud affecting Los Angeles applicants. 
</P>
<P>
INS spokeswoman Virginia Kice said the raids were conducted by Los 
Angeles-based INS agents at Velez's office and the adjacent Nevada state 
offices of LULAC. 
</P>
<P>
"I can only say that this is a far-reaching and sensitive investigation into 
allegations of possible fraud within the legalization program," Kice said. She 
declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Although INS officials would not say what was seized during the three-hour 
search, Velez said immigration agents took the amnesty files of 14 aliens -- 
all of them from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Velez, who became national president of LULAC in June, said the raids were 
politically inspired by the INS, which he said wants to silence him because of 
his organization's anti-INS posture. 
</P>
<P>
"The INS is looking for a big story, 'National president of LULAC indicted,' " 
Velez said when reached at his office Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
He denied that he was involved in any wrongdoing in his handling of the 
applications given to him late last year by Barrientos, who operates a bowling 
alley in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
He said Barrientos gave him only 308 applications and that he was paid only 
$400 for each processed application. He added that he submitted all but 17 of 
them that were withheld because of insufficient documentation. 
</P>
<P>
"I have documentation to prove all this," Velez said. 
</P>
<P>
Barrientos could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Velez also accused INS officials of "Gestapo tactics" by threatening aliens 
with deportation unless they testified against him. 
</P>
<P>
Kice said the raids were not politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any foundation for that allegation," she said. "The INS 
conducts investigations based on the intelligence and data we gather, not 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
LULAC, founded in Texas in 1929, is a national Latino civil rights organization 
that in recent years has been an ardent foe of the INS. It filed a class-action 
lawsuit two years ago to extend the amnesty deadline for some aliens, 
contending that the INS summarily rejected the applications from some aliens 
who were eligible for amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
The group won the right for these aliens to apply under an extended application 
period and successfully fought off INS attempts several weeks ago to cut off 
the application period for these aliens. 
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 aliens nationwide are believed to be affected by the LULAC 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Velez is considered to be one of the leading immigration consultants in 
southern Nevada, having handled an estimated 3,000 amnesty applications since 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
No stranger to controversy, Velez became president of LULAC last June in a 
chaotic election during the 100,000-member group's convention in Albuquerque, 
N.M. He assumed the LULAC presidency when another candidate dropped out. But 
opponents claimed his election was invalid since the group's executive council 
did not ratify it.

STATE FARM SEEKS RATE CHANGES; 
</P>
<P>
CAR INSURANCE: POLICIES WOULD BE BASED ON DRIVING RECORDS. A GILLESPIE 
SPOKESMAN HINTS THAT NEW STRUCTURE MAY BE APPROVED.

<P>
State Farm, the largest seller of auto insurance in California, told its agents 
at a series of closed briefings Tuesday that it intends to shake up rates for 
its 3.3 million state policyholders beginning Jan. 1 -- lowering most good 
drivers' premiums slightly and raising almost all bad drivers' premiums by a 
third or more. 
</P>
<P>
Good drivers are generally those with no more than one minor traffic violation 
and no at-fault accidents in the last three years. Bad drivers have two or more 
violations or one or more at-fault accidents. 
</P>
<P>
State Farm officials who conducted the briefings said the company will act 
after approval -- expected "any day" -- by outgoing Insurance Commissioner 
Roxani Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
The new pricing plan submitted to Gillespie and the subject of a formal rate 
hearing, was prompted by Proposition 103. It does away with the territorial 
rating, or neighborhood pricing, system, in auto insurance and replaces it with 
pricing zones based on the costs and frequency of claims. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Gillespie, Karl Rubinstein, said the insurance commissioner has 
not promised State Farm and other companies that she will approve their plans. 
He said because no objections were raised in recent rate proceedings, it is 
fair for State Farm to surmise that she will give her approval. 
</P>
<P>
Newly elected Commissioner John Garamendi declined comment except to say that 
he has not been told of Gillespie's plans. 
</P>
<P>
A State Farm counsel, Judith Mintel, said from company headquarters in 
Bloomington, Ill., that State Farm is confident enough of Gillespie's decision 
that it has decided to train agents to handle the new rate structure. 
</P>
<P>
With about 18% of California's auto insurance business, State Farm has often 
led the way in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Mintel said State Farm will not disclose rates under the new structure, but 
that they will be "revenue neutral," meaning that for every new dollar 
collected from one customer, another customer will get a dollar decrease. 
</P>
<P>
Mintel said that Ina Becraft, the State Farm actuary who drafted the new 
California pricing plan, estimated that overall rates for good drivers in 
Central and South Los Angeles will decrease 7%, while rates for most bad 
drivers throughout the state will rise more than 33%. 
</P>
<P>
Mintel said there would be "limited areas," such as the San Gabriel Valley, 
where all drivers, including good drivers, would get an increase. She said this 
would be based on the cost and frequency of claims to the company from that 
area. 
</P>
<P>
An agent who attended a State Farm meeting said they had been shown a chart 
indicating that average rates for all drivers would mount 35% in the San 
Gabriel Valley, while declining 3.5% in Pomona and rising 3.4% in Ontario and 
Montclair. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's briefings, according to agents who attended, State Farm also 
announced that it will no longer charge previously uninsured drivers with good 
driving records any more for insurance than previously insured drivers in the 
same areas with the same records. In the past, State Farm has been placing 
uninsured drivers with good records in a less preferred status and often 
charging them 60% more. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, the previously uninsured drivers will not be able to 
secure State Farm coverage immediately, the agents were told. They were 
instructed to take no money and to submit the uninsured drivers' applications 
for a monthlong company review of the drivers' records. 
</P>
<P>
The agents were told not to discuss the new rate schedule outside the company, 
but two agents informed The Times on condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
One of these said he was disappointed in the plan. Names for pricing zones have 
changed from "territory" and "ZIP codes" to "rating zones" and "experience 
factors" covering about the same areas, he said, but real change has been 
small. 
</P>
<P>
"Take a horse, paint it brown, and call it a cow," he said, contending that 
basing prices on where a policyholder lives will not really change. 
</P>
<P>
Mintel and State Farm senior Vice President Roger Joslin said the changes will 
be real and are an attempt to comply with Proposition 103.

SUPERPOWER ARMS SUMMIT PLANNED; 
</P>
<P>
NUCLEAR WEAPONS: BUSH, GORBACHEV WILL MEET EARLY NEXT YEAR TO SIGN A TREATY TO 
REDUCE STRATEGIC ARSENALS.

<P>
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will hold a summit 
meeting early next year in Moscow, where they expect to sign a long-awaited 
strategic arms reduction treaty, U.S. and Soviet officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The START accord, the subject of intense negotiations since 1982, will 
eliminate fully one-third of the two nuclear superpowers' long-range weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Revolutionary political changes in the Soviet Union have dramatically reduced 
the threat of nuclear confrontation, but Bush has been eager to nail down the 
START reductions while Gorbachev remains in power and strong enough to conclude 
such an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Gorbachev has seen START as a critical element in freeing the 
crippled Soviet economy from the financial burdens of the Cold War. And Moscow 
has made most of the major concessions that have moved negotiations forward 
over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
To clinch the accord in time for the next summit, the two sides are understood 
to have agreed to split the difference on a short list of remaining issues. 
These include limits on the Soviet Backfire bomber and SS-18 missiles and on 
the transfer of U.S. nuclear weapons technology to Britain. 
</P>
<P>
A final meeting between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet 
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze is planned next month in Washington to 
wrap up details on verification measures for the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Gorbachev agreed to the new Moscow meeting during their dinner meeting 
Monday night, Soviet spokesman Vitaly N. Ignatenko said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the same trip, Bush is expected to visit Turkey and Greece. Turkey 
is a front-line state in the confrontation with Iraq over Kuwait, and the 
historic tension between Greece and Turkey make it a diplomatic necessity that 
an American President visiting one must also visit the other. 
</P>
<P>
The START, or strategic arms reduction talks, were broken off by the Soviets in 
1983, a year after they began, in protest over U.S. medium-range missile 
deployments in Europe. They did not resume until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Although preceded by two earlier accords, SALT I and SALT II, the START treaty 
will be the first to require the actual reduction of weapon systems that each 
superpower has in place and aimed at the other one. SALT I and SALT II set 
ceilings on strategic weapons, but in each case the ceilings were higher than 
the existing arsenals so that neither side had to destroy weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The initial goal for START was to cut existing arsenals in half, but several 
loopholes have been built into the treaty. In the end, the number of the most 
dangerous and destabilizing weapons of the Soviet Union -- land-based 
intercontinental missiles -- will be cut in half, but the overall reductions 
will be more like 30% of the stockpiles on each side. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, each side will be limited to 1,600 delivery systems -- missiles 
and heavy bombers -- and to 6,000 "accountable" warheads. Of these, 4,900 
warheads can be on ballistic missiles, with the rest on bombers. 
</P>
<P>
The accounting system, however, permits bombers to carry as many nuclear bombs 
and short-range nuclear missiles as they can, but they will only be counted as 
one "accountable" warhead. If air-launched cruise missiles are carried, U.S. 
bombers will count as 10 warheads although they can actually load 20 ALCMs, and 
Soviet bombers count as eight even if they carry their maximum load of 12. 
</P>
<P>
These rules, largely devised by the Pentagon and accepted by Moscow, were 
implemented because bombers and ALCMs are slower-moving weapons against which 
defenses exist. Besides being vulnerable, they are considered to be mainly 
retaliatory weapons, rather than surprise attack weapons. 
</P>
<P>
But the rules mean that the current arsenals of 12,000 to 13,000 weapons will 
only be reduced to 8,000 to 9,000 weapons, not 6,000, when the treaty is fully 
implemented in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the major sticking points have been resolved, mostly since Gorbachev 
took office and mostly because of Soviet concessions. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the clash over "Star Wars" anti-missile defenses ended when the 
Soviets agreed in 1988 to drop their previous insistence that space defenses be 
linked to the START treaty on offensive weapons. The Soviets will now simply 
issue a statement, presumably stating that the building of a "Star Wars" shield 
could jeopardize the START treaty, but it will not be part of the treaty 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
In the final days of negotiations, the three outstanding issues appeared more 
related to political concerns than military factors: 
</P>
<P>
* Soviet Backfire bombers, which Moscow insists are medium-range weapons and 
the United States claims can be long-range weapons, will be limited in a 
separate binding statement. Washington wanted the ceiling to be 400 aircraft, 
the Soviets wanted a 600-plane limit, and they settled on 500. 
</P>
<P>
* Soviet SS-18 intercontinental missiles, which are the biggest and most 
threatening weapons, will be limited in various marginal ways. But the Soviets 
retained the right to modernize them and flight-test the new models, although 
they cannot build any new missiles of the same size. 
</P>
<P>
* The longstanding U.S. cooperative arrangement with Britain in nuclear 
weaponry will be essentially unchanged. Moscow eventually gave up its attempts 
to limit U.S. technological help for Britain's Trident submarines and ballistic 
missiles.

SOVIETS TO GET LEFTOVERS FROM WEST BERLIN'S COLD WAR FOOD

<P>
A huge stockpile of food built up by West Berlin in case of a Cold War crisis 
will be sent to help the Soviet Union, the power that once blockaded the city. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the ironies of post-Cold War Europe, Berlin said Tuesday that it is 
ready to send 300,000 metric tons of food and other supplies worth $480 million 
to its former enemy. 
</P>
<P>
The only outstanding question is how to move the goods from 280 warehouses 
around the city to their destination. 
</P>
<P>
"The big problem will be transporting it in winter as the cold could destroy 
the tinned food," said Juergen Weide, a department head at Berlin's Economics 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet media reported that severe shortages of meat, potatoes and dairy 
products are hitting the nation's industrial heartland and the battered economy 
is reeling because of a wave of hoarding, bartering and rationing. 
</P>
<P>
The reports painted a grim picture of what everyone expects to be a long, hard 
winter across much of the country, already torn by political and social unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Leningrad, birthplace of the Bolshevik Revolution and the country's 
second-largest city, has approved a rationing plan, and Moscow is expected to 
follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
Sales in the two cities, and many other regions, are already limited to buyers 
with residence permits. 
</P>
<P>
Mounting food problems, sparked by the breakdown of the old distribution system 
and the lack of a replacement, pose the most fundamental threat yet to 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform drive, bogged down in its sixth year. 
</P>
<P>
West Berlin established its emergency stockpile in 1953, four years after 
enduring a yearlong blockade by the Soviet Union and its East German ally. 
</P>
<P>
The stockpile, which was due to be dismantled following German unification last 
month, was large enough to supply the daily needs of West Berliners for up to a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
It includes items ranging from 10.9 million cans of sardines to 18 million 
toilet rolls. 
</P>
<P>
A German Red Cross delegation will leave today for talks in Moscow on an aid 
program.

E. EUROPE SEEKS TO END WARSAW PACT; 
</P>
<P>
ALLIANCES: THE LEADERS OF FORMER SOVIET SATELLITES ARE PRESSING FOR THE 
ABOLITION OF THE MILITARY ORGANIZATION.

<P>
Leaders of former Communist states of Eastern Europe, further shifting the 
Continent's balance of power, said Tuesday that they are pressing for the 
abolition of the Warsaw Pact to complete the dramatic changes that began there 
a year ago with the wave of anti-Marxist revolutions. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jozsef Antall of Hungary said that he expects the pact, which 
once defined the "solidarity of the fraternal socialist countries" on the 
Soviet Union's western borders, to decide to disband when its leaders meet next 
month in Budapest, the Hungarian capital. 
</P>
<P>
Such a step would formally end a military alliance that confronted the Western 
Alliance and held Moscow's East Bloc satellites in an iron grip through more 
than three decades of Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
"Agreement has now been reached, I am gratified to say, on the dissolution of 
the military organization among the members," Antall told the 34-nation Paris 
summit meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. "We 
trust that the prerequisites for a complete dissolution of the Warsaw Treaty 
Organization will be brought about through the European security process at the 
latest by New Year's Day, 1992." 
</P>
<P>
Antall's message to the Soviet Union was that the Warsaw Pact could not 
continue even as a political grouping, as Moscow has hoped, and thus was 
underscoring both the sharpness of the political reorientation in Eastern 
Europe and its permanency. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian leader was joined by Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland, 
who addressed the conference later, and then by President Vaclav Havel of 
Czechoslovakia, who told reporters that the Warsaw Pact has been "a typical 
product of Stalinist expansion" and has no further function. 
</P>
<P>
"Dinosaurs might be nice for museums, but they are not for our time, and the 
Warsaw Pact is a dinosaur," Havel said. "It is hard for anyone in our country, 
and not just ours, to hear the words Warsaw Pact and not think of 1968 (when 
Warsaw Pact troops crushed Czechoslovakia's pro-democracy movement). How can we 
as free nations want to remain members of the Warsaw Pact?" 
</P>
<P>
But the East European leaders also had words of warning for the West. Economic 
and ethnic tensions could again divide Europe, they said, and a wall of wealth 
could divide the rich from the poor as the Iron Curtain divided the free from 
the oppressed until last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"Our common future may be darkened by the sinister clouds of the resurgent 
conflicts of bygone days unless the split into a rich and a poor Europe, an 'A' 
class and a 'B' class Europe, is overcome," Mazowiecki said, echoing a theme 
from the opening day of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the key to the unit of Europe as a whole. It is a fundamental issue . 
. . for which determined and consistent solutions cannot be delayed 
indefinitely." 
</P>
<P>
Antall said that, as the nations of Eastern Europe emerge from the 
Soviet-dominated political, military and economic system where they had been 
"held captive" for about 40 years, they need closer political dialogue and 
economic integration with the West. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who sat quietly as Antall and Mazowiecki 
addressed the conference, had said Monday that the Warsaw Pact would make 
"important decisions before the end of this year on transforming the 
organization and changing its character." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Warsaw Pact signed a nonaggression treaty with NATO on Monday as 
well as an agreement sharply reducing the deployment of conventional arms in 
central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials had made clear their hope before the conference that the 
Warsaw Pact, which had grouped Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, 
Poland and Romania together with the Soviet Union for 35 years, would become a 
political forum for East European countries as they shed their Stalinist 
systems and end their long isolation from the West. 
</P>
<P>
"Europe is blessedly peaceful, but all our problems have not disappeared," 
Alexei G. Arbatov, a European security specialist at the Soviet Institute of 
the World Economy and International Relations, commented earlier in Moscow. ". 
. . There are problems of disarmament that the Warsaw Pact could help resolve. 
There are problems of transition for which the Warsaw Pact is a good forum for 
exchanging views. And there are simple neighbor-to-neighbor problems that the 
Warsaw Pact can handle better than some new organization." 
</P>
<P>
While Soviet officials expect Hungary to announce its withdrawal and 
Czechoslovakia probably to follow, they had hoped that Poland would remain a 
member along with Bulgaria and perhaps Romania, and that this nucleus would 
become the basis for the pact's transformation into a regional political 
grouping. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that there is an objective and solid basis for continued 
cooperation among the members of the Warsaw Treaty Organization," Vitaly 
Zhurkin, director of the Soviet Institute of Europe, a leading Moscow think 
tank, commented here Tuesday. "This will take time to explore and develop, and 
the changes in Europe are still coming very, very fast." 
</P>
<P>
The memory of Moscow's use of its military power, under the pretext of 
assisting an ally, to suppress pro-democracy movements over the years in 
Hungary, Poland and East Germany as well as Czechoslovakia, is especially 
strong, and Antall bluntly warned the military leaders of Eastern Europe and 
the Soviet Union against intervening in politics and again using force to 
suppress the democratization finally under way there. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope . . . that there will be no country where humiliated armies feel 
tempted to embark upon political adventures or disappointed military men might 
attempt to bar the way for the development of democracy out of ambitions for 
power," the Hungarian leader said. 
</P>
<P>
"Such attempts can offer no solution to the grievous social and economic 
tensions that confront our societies."

BUSH LOOKING FOR UPBEAT TROOP IMAGE IN SAUDI VISIT; 
</P>
<P>
MORALE: HIS THANKSGIVING TRIP IS BEING CHOREOGRAPHED TO AVOID INCIDENTS THAT 
MIGHT SHOW SIGNS OF DISCONTENT.

<P>
President Bush's Thanksgiving visit to the desert is being carefully 
orchestrated to project a positive and intensely patriotic image of military 
morale, according to officials here. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangements appear intended to minimize the prospect that soldiers will 
embarrass the President and dominate news coverage by carping about going home 
or offering him warm, stale water to drink, as some have done during past 
visits by high-level U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Bush will address audiences composed largely of soldiers handpicked 
from units across Saudi Arabia and moved to locations chosen specifically for 
their ability to provide a suitable military backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
In a closely choreographed tour, the President is scheduled to visit the Air 
Force, Army and Navy before arriving for dinner at a forward-based Marine 
headquarters just in time to appear live on morning television across the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be God, country and pumpkin pie," one military planner said. 
</P>
<P>
In defending the decision to limit access to the President to selected 
soldiers, military officials insisted that the policy was based on a desire to 
reward good troops, not to muzzle discontent. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't do yourself a favor by trying to silence the guys," one senior 
officer said, "because someone's going to stand up and say -- 'Hey, they told 
me I couldn't say anything, but. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
Some officials acknowledged, however, that they hope to avoid repetition of the 
unflattering spectacle conveyed by the widely covered griping by soldiers to 
visitors. For instance, Secretary of State James A. Baker III was greeted by 
members of the Army's 1st Cavalry Division with a scornful invitation to share 
hot drinking water with them. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be sure no one wants to see that happen again," one field commander 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's visit to the Arabian desert comes at a time when high-ranking officers 
here are particularly sensitive about any impression that soldiers' spirits may 
be flagging. 
</P>
<P>
While insisting that reports of low morale have been exaggerated, commanders 
say that the impression that soldiers are unhappy could further undermine 
public support for what appears to be a prolonged military operation. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the senior U.S. commander in the gulf 
region, was so disturbed by a newspaper article quoting unhappy soldiers in the 
24th Mechanized Division that he later flew by helicopter to the unit to seek 
an explanation, an aide confirmed. There remains no indication that soldiers' 
discontent yet poses any problem to military preparedness or combat operations. 
</P>
<P>
In scores of interviews in recent weeks, however, many American soldiers made 
clear that they are growing ever more bored and weary of uncertainty. Their 
spirits sagged perceptibly after the Pentagon announced two weeks ago that 
plans to bring them home on rotation had been postponed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
And with the holidays approaching, many voiced new frustrations about the 
restrictions on their conduct imposed by the military in deference to Saudi 
sensitivities. Among the traditional diversions to be banned are USO shows and 
the public display of Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of hard to think you're protecting democracy when you've got all the 
religious laws here," said Lance Cpl. Kenneth Gardner, a reconnaissance Marine 
from Daytona Beach, Fla. But, he added quickly, "it's not something we can't 
handle." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Baker, other high-level officials, including Gen. Colin L. 
Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have been pestered at virtually 
every stop during visits here with questions from soldiers about when they 
might go home. 
</P>
<P>
Fed up with the complaints, Gen. Alfred Gray, the Marine Corps commandant, 
sternly preempted one assembly, ordering: "There will be morale!" 
</P>
<P>
At each of his four stops, the President will deliver remarks and then take a 
few questions from soldiers. After "grip and grin" sessions featuring the 
commander in chief extending a hand to a long line of troops clad in combat 
fatigues, the President is expected to join them in four different Thanksgiving 
meals, each featuring turkey roll and mashed potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
The audiences primarily will be composites made up of small groups of soldiers 
dispatched by their commanders. A Marine brigade, for example, would be 
permitted to assemble just one company-sized group. 
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the visit, which begins when the President arrives here 
Thursday morning after spending the night in Jidda, have all but consumed 
military officials whose principal job is to serve as escorts to the press. 
</P>
<P>
Although the military has played a key role in preparations for the visit -- 
the first by an American President to a potential combat zone since Lyndon B. 
Johnson touched down in Vietnam in 1966 -- its principal choreographers are a 
White House team headed by Sig Rogich, a former Las Vegas advertising 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
The presidential backdrops chosen include a Navy ship whose flight deck offers 
what officials described as a "perfect shot -- a vessel abuzz with helicopters 
and aircraft."

An Air Force sergeant's 3 1/2-year-old son has come up with a nickname for 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that has the White House laughing. 
</P>
<P>
It took Pam Averill a minute to figure out what her son, Kyle, meant when he 
said, "Sadly Insane took Daddy away." 
</P>
<P>
Kyle's father, Sgt. Kenneth Averill, was shipped from Maine to Saudi Arabia in 
August after Hussein's troops invaded Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"He has heard us talking and it's hard for a little kid to say 'Saddam 
Hussein,' " said Pam Averill, who is living with her parents while her husband 
is away. 
</P>
<P>
Kyle's grandmother, Joyce Austin, wrote President Bush to let him in on the 
joke. A typed reply from the White House carried the handwritten note at the 
end: "Sadly Insane? I love it."

U.S. 'LOOKED OTHER WAY' AS IRAQ BACKED TERRORISM IN 1980S, EX-CIA EXPERT SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
INTELLIGENCE: HE CHARGES THAT THE DECISION TO LEAVE BAGHDAD OFF THE OFFICIAL 
TERRORIST-STATE LIST WAS 'A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.'

<P>
The United States repeatedly turned a blind eye to Iraqi-sponsored terrorism 
during the 1980s by leaving the nation off its official terrorist-state list, 
the CIA's former counterterrorist operations chief charged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked the other way when we knew that Iraq was carrying out a terrorist 
operation," said Vincent M. Cannistraro, who retired from the CIA on Oct. 1. He 
branded the decision to keep Iraq off the terrorist list -- a designation that 
carries economic sanctions -- "a terrible mistake." 
</P>
<P>
A government counterterrorism official who declined to be identified contended 
that Cannistraro was "stretching things a bit." 
</P>
<P>
While "we knew they didn't have completely clean hands," there was no evidence 
of terrorism after the end of 1982, the year Iraq was dropped from the State 
Department listing of specific terrorism sponsorship, he said. 
</P>
<P>
An official of another agency with counterterrorism responsibilities said he 
would not dispute the retired CIA official's assessment but would give no 
specifics. 
</P>
<P>
Cannistraro declined to give details of U.S. knowledge of Iraqi sponsorship of 
terrorism. Now a senior fellow with the National Strategy Information Center, a 
nonprofit organization concerned with intelligence issues, Cannistraro formerly 
held intelligence positions with the National Security Council and the Pentagon 
in addition to his service at the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
Talking with reporters, Cannistraro said: "There was intelligence information 
available at various stages that indicated quite clearly that Iraq was involved 
in the sponsorship of terrorism. This goes over two Administrations," he added, 
referring to the Bush and Reagan administrations. 
</P>
<P>
Cannistraro said Iraq was kept off the State Department list because during the 
Iran-Iraq War the United States considered Iran its principal enemy. 
</P>
<P>
"This was an instance of our using short-term policy interests to confuse our 
longer-term coherent policy objectives," he said. "That's what I'm opposed to." 
</P>
<P>
Cannistraro's allegations would indicate significantly greater tolerance of 
Iraqi misdeeds than earlier known at a time when the United States was trying 
to cultivate favor with the government of Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, officials have acknowledged that the United States supplied Iraq with 
military intelligence to use against Iran and later allowed export of some 
technology that might have military applications. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, there has been no indication that the United States was willing to 
overlook terrorism by the Iraqis. Iraq was returned to the list of states 
sponsoring terrorism in September, a month after it invaded Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Cannistraro contended that government officials who were monitoring Iraq saw 
involvement in terrorism "very clearly," but were undercut by the Iraqi desk at 
the State Department, which oversees U.S. relations with that nation. 
</P>
<P>
"The country desk would constantly undercut the intelligence information by 
saying, 'No, no that's not valid. You've only one source for that,' " 
Cannistraro said. "In other words, there'd be a whole series of 
rationalizations for why they should not believe that Iraq was involved in 
terrorism, because it wasn't in their interest to believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a major problem," he added. "We've seen that with Iraq, and I think 
we're seeing that today with Syria. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now very anxious to cultivate relations with (Syrian leader Hafez) 
Assad, because from a foreign policy point of view it is important for us to 
have a larger Arab component in Saudi Arabia. And therefore we're overlooking 
some of the really horrible things Assad has done and continues to do," 
Cannistraro said. 
</P>
<P>
Turning to the investigation of the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of Pan Am Flight 
103, Cannistraro said the Justice Department "has made substantial progress in 
identifying the modus operandi by which that bomb got on board." 
</P>
<P>
He said he thought the department was "very, very close" to obtaining an 
indictment of those who carried out the bombing of the New York-bound flight 
from London. 
</P>
<P>
The bombing killed all 259 people aboard and 11 residents of Lockerbie, 
Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
But a source familiar with the investigation disputed Cannistraro's timetable, 
suggesting that he was confusing intelligence information with that needed to 
support a criminal indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Cannistraro also contended that "there is a lot of evidence that puts the 
commissioning of the (Flight 103) terrorist incident at the doorstep of the 
Iranian government. I'm persuaded that that's true. . . . That's not to say 
that the Iranian government implemented it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm saying that the majority of the ruling members of the Iranian government 
made a conscious joint decision to commission that," he said. "It was not a 
rogue operation. I do not believe that (current Iranian President Hashemi) 
Rafsanjani was unaware of that decision."

SATURN 'BURPS' A GIANT, BAFFLING STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
Photographs of a giant storm on Saturn taken by the Hubble Space Telescope 
reveal that the storm has grown so much since it was discovered in September by 
amateur astronomers that it is several times larger than the Earth, scientists 
announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It might just be the largest atmospheric structure right now in the solar 
system outside of the sun," said Andrew Ingersoll, a planetary scientist at 
Caltech. "The last time Saturn did anything of this magnitude was in 1933." 
Ingersoll said it is not clear what drives such a massive storm. 
</P>
<P>
"If you like, Saturn burped," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The storm nearly encircles the giant planet and has ammonia clouds billowing 
150 miles high. 
</P>
<P>
Amateur astronomers discovered the white spot in September, when it was the 
diameter of three Earths, and it has continued to grow. The Hubble Telescope, 
with its faulty optical system, can still see relatively close objects 
reasonably well, scientists said during a news conference at the headquarters 
of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The orbiting telescope 
was trained on Saturn on Nov. 9 and 11 and again last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
By then, the storm clouds ringed the planet with clearly visible swirls and 
loops in a band 6,000 miles wide. The highest clouds are red; the ones closest 
to Saturn's normal atmosphere are blue. 
</P>
<P>
The 400 pictures taken to date will be made into a film, said Charles Pellerin, 
director of astrophysics at NASA headquarters. "Pretty soon we'll be able to 
watch what some people have called the storm of the century evolve in great 
detail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Astronomers do not know what is causing the great storm. 
</P>
<P>
"These planets like Jupiter and Saturn are fluid objects, all the way to the 
center," Ingersoll said. "There are no volcanoes erupting, because there are no 
volcanoes. There is no solid crust. These planets are sort of bubbling caldrons 
of liquid and gas." 
</P>
<P>
Ingersoll discounted the possibility that a comet or other celestial object hit 
Saturn or that the disturbance was formed by the union of smaller storms. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to be some sort of internal intermittent thing on Saturn, like Saturn 
burped," Ingersoll said. 
</P>
<P>
Ingersoll said heat is coming out of the deep interior of Saturn and presumably 
pressures can build up. The planet's weather is not just driven by sunlight as 
it is on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really understand it," he said. "In some mysterious way, which I don't 
have a clue about, Saturn burps in the summertime." 
</P>
<P>
Saturn, the second-largest planet after Jupiter, is the windiest place in the 
solar system and the storm is being whipped by a west wind of 1,000 m.p.h.

BERNARD DIAMOND; EXPERT ON PSYCHIATRY AND THE LAW 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bernard L. Diamond, a psychiatrist and legal scholar who introduced the concept 
of "diminished capacity" to courtrooms, arguing that murder defendants 
suffering from serious mental impairment should not be punished under the 
standard criteria of law, has died. 
</P>
<P>
UC Berkeley spokesman Jesus Mena said Tuesday that the university's 
distinguished emeritus professor of law and psychiatry had died Sunday at Marin 
General Hospital in Greenbrae, Calif., of emphysema and heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
He was 77 and had suffered a heart attack two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Diamond's best-known testimony came during the trial of Sen. Robert F. 
Kennedy's assassin, Sirhan Sirhan. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond argued that the trauma Sirhan had suffered during the bombing and 
shelling of his homeland during the Arab-Israeli war had seriously impaired his 
mental faculties. 
</P>
<P>
He said Sirhan had placed himself in a trance during Kennedy's 1968 slaying and 
should be judged outside the parameters used for "normal" murderers. Sirhan was 
convicted of Kennedy's killing and is serving a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond's arguments for diminished capacity were put to use in many U.S. 
courtrooms but were struck down by the California Supreme Court in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to be guilty of a crime, there must be a guilty mind," Diamond would 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond, a native of San Francisco, also was an expert regarding the effects of 
hypnotic suggestion on courtroom testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The author of more than 40 articles in major professional journals, Diamond was 
opposed to the use of testimony from witnesses whose recollections of events 
had been "freshened" under hypnosis. 
</P>
<P>
An example came during Sirhan's 1969 trial, when Diamond testified that he had 
hypnotized Kennedy's killer and had him relive the murder in the kitchen at the 
Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. He found that Sirhan could not recall the 
shooting of the 1968 presidential candidate unless he was under hypnosis and 
theorized that Sirhan's hypnotic remembrance of the assassination -- in which 
Sirhan had convinced himself that he merely wanted to shake Kennedy's hand and 
not shoot him -- could have been a lie. 
</P>
<P>
He retired in 1980 but continued teaching until last year. 
</P>
<P>
Just before his death, he had begun planning a children's program of 
interactive exhibits at UC's Lawrence Hall of Science to explain the effects of 
drugs and alcohol on the mind -- a project the institution expects to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond is survived by his wife, Ann Landy Diamond, a son and five daughters.

WILSON NAMES PANEL TO GUIDE TRANSITION TO POWER

<P>
In a move that may help set the tone for the first days of his Administration, 
Gov.-elect Pete Wilson on Tuesday named a 35-member advisory council to assist 
in his transition to power. 
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan list of appointees includes old names and new, women and 
minorities, people in the private sector and longtime government officials. 
Many of the members campaigned for Wilson or raised money for his election. 
</P>
<P>
In forming the council, Wilson apparently hopes to show that he will reach out 
to a broad cross section of Californians and not govern in isolation, as Gov. 
George Deukmejian has sometimes been criticized for doing. The council will 
first meet in early December and probably disband by Jan. 7, when Wilson is 
inaugurated. 
</P>
<P>
Otto Bos, Wilson's director of communications and public affairs, said Wilson 
used similar advisory boards as mayor of San Diego and as U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's very important that we not get caught with preconceived notions 
and assumptions that don't necessarily exist," Bos said. 
</P>
<P>
The council will be chaired by Republican Kirk West, president of the 
California Chambers of Commerce, and Democrat Bill Hauck, a Sacramento 
businessman who was the top aide to the late Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti. 
</P>
<P>
Other political insiders on the list include Ken Khachigian, an attorney who 
has written speeches for Ronald Reagan and Deukmejian; former Rep. Clair 
Burgener and former Assembly Speaker Bob Monagan. 
</P>
<P>
The council also includes several representatives of local government, 
including San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding and Orange County 
Supervisor Gaddi Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
For advice on education issues, Wilson will turn to, among others, Maureen 
DiMarco, who is president of the California School Boards Assn.; Jaime 
Escalante, the Garfield High School math teacher who was portrayed in the movie 
"Stand and Deliver," and University of California Vice President William Baker. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the council members have a background in law enforcement, including 
Lourdes Baird, U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, and Ron Newman, president of the 
San Diego Police Officers' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
For expertise on health and social service policy, Wilson named Dixon Arnett, a 
former assemblyman who is now a health care consultant; Dr. Al Anderson, 
president of the President's Committee on Mental Retardation, and William 
Tainter, executive director of the San Diego Community Center for the Disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the panel include Lou Barnett, a Glendale business consultant; 
Joanne Kozberg, chairwoman of the California Arts Council; Matt Fong, the 
unsuccessful Republican candidate for state controller; Irvine Co. executive 
Jack Flanigan, and the Rev. William Turner, pastor at New Revelations Baptist 
Church in Pasadena.

If found guilty, Cahill could get a life sentence. Smith has pleaded guilty and

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: GUARDIAN OF THE KING'S ENGLISH SLAPS GRAMMAR INTO THE

R. Peter Mitchell of La Jolla heard Tina Turner hawking Chryslers on television 
by saying something about "who said you don't get no respect?" 
</P>
<P>
He gave Chrysler Corp. a SLAP. 
</P>
<P>
He read about the Disney movie "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids." SLAP. 
</P>
<P>
He heard McDonald's doing a commercial tie-in with "Honey . . . " SLAP. (And 
one to San Diego's Joan Kroc, too). 
</P>
<P>
He heard a San Diego car dealer say "it don't make no difference." And he read 
a headline in the San Diego County Edition of The Times: "Geography Teacher

Mitchell, 69, a retired mechanical engineer from General Dynamics/Convair, is

</P>
<P>
When he hears or sees a particularly egregious violation of the mother tongue, 
he dashes off a ("Yours for better grammar.") letter awarding the perpetrator a 
SLAP. 
</P>
<P>
He does not see himself as some linguistic Pecksniff mercilessly policing even 
minor infractions. He accepts an occasional bit of pronoun confusion or 
subject-verb disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
But he draws the line -- and awards a SLAP -- for errors inflicted as 
attention-getters, particularly those that are likely to assault the eyes and 
ears of children. 
</P>
<P>
His experience running a stamp and coin shop convinced him that the youth of 
America is being rendered unintelligible by poor use of language. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the children couldn't explain themselves, couldn't phrase questions 
and answers correctly," Mitchell said. "We're abusing our children by teaching 
them to mimic erroneous speech." 
</P>
<P>
So far, none of the corporate recipients of a SLAP has responded. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Mitchell branched out to give a SLAP to Nabisco for its Jell-O 
advertisement suggesting that children eat the slippery stuff with their hands. 
</P>

"Cultural abuse," he explained.

But, before the scamster could return to reap his ill-gotten gains, the box

SCHAEFER REVERSES DECISION, ORDERS AIDE BACK TO WORK; 
</P>
<P>
SUPERVISORS: DOUG JOHNSON, CLAIMING THAT HE WAS FIRED, NOT PUT ON LEAVE, SAYS 
HE WILL NOT RETURN TO HIS FORMER JOB. 
</P>

County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, who abruptly dismissed an administrative 
aide Monday after discovering that he will go to work for her successor, 
reversed herself and ordered the aide back to work Tuesday in a terse telegram. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Doug Johnson said he will never work for Schaefer again and 
declared her assertions that he had been placed on leave, rather than fired, a 
lie. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday she demanded my keys and my garage pass. She threw boxes at my feet 
and told me to pack, and she had the locks changed as soon as I left," Johnson 
said. "If that's not firing, I don't know what is." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer, who was defeated by Maria VanderKolk in June, said Tuesday that she 
had ordered Johnson out of their Thousand Oaks office Monday because he had not 
told her that he had agreed to work for VanderKolk after the new supervisor 
takes office Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
He also originally denied that he had accepted the VanderKolk job, Schaefer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer said that while she had ordered Johnson out of her office, she never 
told him that he was fired. She said she considers Johnson to be on 
administrative leave, which she is now rescinding. After their angry 
confrontation, Schaefer said she discovered that aides are paid for 60 days 
after they are dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who makes $43,848 a year, will be paid $5,900 over the next seven 
weeks before he goes to work for VanderKolk. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't want the taxpayers paying for a problem between Doug and me," 
Schaefer said. "There was no formal discussion about this, just a lot of 
yelling and lying. If Doug wants to stick it to the taxpayers of Ventura 
County, then he won't show up for work." 
</P>
<P>
A copy of Schaefer's telegram, which Johnson said he received at 1 p.m. 
Tuesday, said: "Administrative leave canceled. Report 11-20-90 to Sup. 
Schaefer's office at 800 S. Victoria, Ventura, at 8 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer works at her office in Thousand Oaks, not at the County Government 
Center in Ventura. Johnson would write proclamations and do research for her, 
the supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he may soon return to work for the county, if county 
administrators can arrange it, but not for Schaefer. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether I go back to work is up to me," he said. "I no longer work for Madge 
Schaefer, and she no longer has any form of supervision over me. She fired me." 
</P>
<P>
County Personnel Director Ronald Komers said Monday that if Johnson had been 
thrown out of Schaefer's office and fired, as the aide claimed, then he would 
be eligible for 60 days severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old aide, who committed to work for VanderKolk earlier this month, 
said he regrets that Schaefer found out about his new job through an anonymous 
letter over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he is angry because Schaefer apparently told a Thousand Oaks 
newspaper that she had given Johnson three choices Monday -- not working, using 
his vacation time or working for her in a separate office. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't object to being fired," Johnson said. "But her lying now after the 
fact is absolutely disgraceful." 
</P>
<P>
When asked about offering Johnson three options Monday, Schaefer said she was 
not referring to her comments to the aide in the morning but to her telegram, 
which was sent Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Although the telegram only directs Johnson to report to work, it indirectly 
outlines his options, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who interviewed with VanderKolk in October, said he did not tell 
Schaefer of the appointment earlier because the supervisor was upset about her 
mother's illness.

OXNARD GAINS $2.5 MILLION FROM MISTAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Financially beleaguered Oxnard has received a windfall of about $2.5 million 
from Southern California Gas Co., which discovered that it had mistakenly 
underpaid city fees for six years, officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A three-month internal audit at the gas company uncovered the "clerical error" 
that led to the mistake, said Marty de los Cobos, the company's district 
manager for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1983 and 1989, the gas company underpaid the city's franchise fees for 
gas pipelines beneath city streets by about $1.8 million, de los Cobos said. 
The city was paid an additional $700,000 to account for interest that it would 
have earned on the $1.8 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The company gave city officials a check for more than $2.5 million last Friday, 
which was deposited in Oxnard's general fund reserve account, Mayor Nao 
Takasugi said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good Christmas gift," Councilman Manuel Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
Five months ago, city officials were forced to use another financial windfall 
and to eliminate 18.5 city jobs to avoid a $2.8-million deficit. To balance its 
1990-91 fiscal year budget, the city used the $1.4 million it had earned by 
investing money paid by city employees into the state-run public employees 
retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
The gas company discovered its error two months after the council had asked 
staff to analyze revenue sources -- including franchise fees -- to make sure 
that the city is receiving all the money it is owed. But city officials had not 
gotten around to reviewing the gas company's franchise fees. 
</P>
<P>
"Although these additional fees remain subject to verification . . . it has 
significant benefits for the city," the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi said the council will meet Dec. 4 to review the city's first quarterly 
financial report for the 1990-91 budget year. It will discuss at that time 
whether the money should be spent or should remain in the emergency account, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the city has been forced to dip heavily into the 
reserve account because of financial problems. The account's balance has been 
reduced from $9 million in 1988 to slightly more than $4 million today. 
</P>
<P>
De los Cobos said the gas company's error occurred after additional meters were 
added in 1983 to record natural gas used at its Mandalay steam-generating 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
"Through a coding error, usage through these new meters was not recorded as 
being delivered in Oxnard and, therefore, our computers did not credit all gas 
usage at the plant to the city's franchise fee account," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the gas company has paid Oxnard more than $6.7 million 
in franchise fees, he said.

$1.6-MILLION FUND GOES UNTAPPED BY DOCTORS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: FEW COUNTY PHYSICIANS USE THE STATE PROGRAM, WHICH WAS CREATED TO 
ENCOURAGE HEALTH-CARE PROVIDERS TO TREAT MORE PREGNANT WOMEN AND POOR CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Much of the $1.6 million in tobacco taxes set aside to reimburse Ventura County 
doctors who treat indigent patients has gone unclaimed and may have to be 
returned to the state, county officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Few local doctors have enlisted in a special state program designed to 
encourage physicians to treat more pregnant women and poor children, the 
officials said. The program also pays them for treating indigents in hospital 
emergency rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the physicians locally are interested in it," said Phillipp K. 
Wessels, director of the county's Health Care Agency. "The procedures to get 
the money are very cumbersome. And I don't see any significant trends that 
indicate we'll spend all this money." 
</P>
<P>
If unspent, the money must be returned to the state for redistribution, but 
none will be lost until next year, Wessels said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $1.6 million Ventura County has received since the program began in 
February, doctors had claimed only $152,000 as of Friday, the county reported. 
</P>
<P>
A similar situation apparently exists in counties throughout California, said 
state officials and a spokesman for the California Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hearing the same thing. Claims are not coming in," said Michael Kassis, 
chief of the Medically Indigent Section of the state Department of Health 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
Kassis said distribution of the so-called Physician Services funds -- collected 
as part of a 25-cent-a-pack tobacco tax passed in 1988 -- has been slow because 
doctors do not know much about it. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $578 million expected to be collected from new tobacco taxes for the 
1990-91 fiscal year, about $58 million will be forwarded to Physician Services 
accounts overseen by the counties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
George Cate, associate director of the California Medical Assn., predicted that 
as word spreads about the program, more doctors will file claims and open their 
doors to increasing numbers of poor patients because the state guarantees that 
they will be paid for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Physician Services program, doctors seeing patients who cannot pay 
their bills and who are not covered by Medi-Cal will be reimbursed for 50% of 
their billing -- about the same amount allowed under Medi-Cal, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County officials said ignorance of the program is also apparently the 
biggest obstacle locally. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great program," said Andrea Pendleton, operations director for the 
Ventura County Foundation for Medical Care, a private firm that processes 
claims for the county. "But we think we've had some misconception in the 
physicians' offices. They don't understand that they can recoup this money. 
It's just a continuing education." 
</P>
<P>
Seminars about the program have been held at six of the seven private hospitals 
in the county and another is scheduled next week at Los Robles Regional Medical 
Center in Thousand Oaks, said Kathy Chester, program administrator at the 
Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"Immediately after each seminar, we've had an influx of claims," she said. 
Since payment of local claims began in May, the amounts distributed countywide 
have increased from $11,000 to about $33,000 in November, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The claims, though increasing, are still only a fraction of those needed to 
meet the goals of the program, Chester said. 
</P>
<P>
The county, in conjunction with the 600-doctor county Medical Society, is 
working with the hospitals to try to enlist more emergency room physicians, 
obstetricians and pediatricians into the program, Chester said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Chester said, doctors and their staffs have seemed daunted by the 
paperwork. Background information required by doctors includes details such as 
whether patients are newly legalized immigrants, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At a Thousand Oaks pediatric clinic, which receives numerous patients who 
cannot pay their bills, office manager Vicki Goldschlager said she has not 
filed claims for reimbursement because she thought that the program only 
covered emergency treatment. 
</P>
<P>
But doctors who treat expectant mothers and children can also be reimbursed for 
non-emergency care, Chester said. 
</P>
<P>
County officials say they hope that area physicians are informed before next 
November, when money from the 1989-90 fiscal year must be returned to the state 
if not spent. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, state law requires that funds from fiscal 1989-90, which ended June 
30, be returned to the state by the end of this year if not committed to pay 
claims. But declarations by Ventura County that it expects to spend the money 
will keep it in county coffers for another 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 99, the tobacco-tax initiative approved by voters in November, 
1988, increased the tax on cigarettes from 10 cents to 35 cents a pack. 
</P>
<P>
Laws to determine how the money would be split up and administered were not 
passed until October, 1989, and tax money did not begin to reach the counties 
until February. 
</P>
<P>
About 10% of the tobacco taxes go to the physicians' account and 35% to 
hospitals. Another 20% is earmarked for health education, 5% for research and 
5% for public resources such as parks. A final 25% can be distributed as the 
counties want among all the classifications.

AIRPORT SHUTTLE FIRMS BEMOAN 'FREE-FOR-ALL'; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: SOME COMPANIES SAY A LACK OF REGULATION HAS LED TO A CURBSIDE 
FIGHT FOR PASSENGERS. SMALLER OUTFITS SAY THE COMPLAINTS MASK A PLAN TO WRECK 
THEIR BUSINESSES.

An association of the largest airport passenger shuttle van companies launched 
an assault Tuesday against the Los Angeles City Board of Airport Commissioners, 
claiming that the lack of regulations and the proliferation of small, upstart 
companies has resulted in slashed profits and a chaotic curbside fight for 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
Association members gathered at Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday 
and urged the commission to stop licensing new companies and possibly banish 
smaller shuttle operations to different pickup spots to prevent poaching of 
fares. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a free-for-all out there now," said Mitchell Rouse, chairman of 
SuperShuttle, the largest shuttle van operation at the airport. "There ought to 
be competition, but I believe it's in the airport and the public's benefit to 
have some balance here." 
</P>
<P>
The Shuttle Van Assn. of Southern California, comprised of five firms, filed 
suit earlier this month against the commission, demanding a limit on the number 
of new shuttle companies. Their cause has been supported by some 
environmentalists, who say the lack of control over the shuttle industry has 
increased traffic and pollution at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores also has introduced a city ordinance 
calling for a moratorium on additional airport flights until a plan is devised 
to reduce airport traffic. 
</P>
<P>
But the association's complaints were met with derision from several small 
shuttle operators, who said the shouts of "curbside chaos" were a smoke screen 
to hide efforts to squeeze out the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just trying to take over everything," David Regwan, owner of 
All-American Shuttle, said of the larger firms. "They put the blame on smaller 
companies, but we're just trying to survive too." 
</P>
<P>
Breton K. Lobner, an assistant city attorney representing the commission, said 
that the association's claims that more regulations are needed to control 
traffic are unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
"We get 2 million cars a month here," Lobner said. "From a traffic standpoint, 
the vans are just an infinitesimal part of it all." 
</P>
<P>
Both sides generally agree that the dispute began about two years ago, when the 
airport saw a dramatic rise in the number of new shuttle companies, Rouse said. 
</P>
<P>
The larger companies, such as SuperShuttle, had spent years building up their 
fleets and installing radio and computer equipment to provide fast, efficient 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Rouse said smaller companies usually started without a dispatching network and 
survived by cruising the airport and taking customers at the curb. He said the 
smaller companies have an unfair advantage because they have little invested in 
dispatching equipment and scrimp on quality service. 
</P>
<P>
Lobner conceded there were some problems with drivers badgering passengers, 
operating illegal vehicles, and packing their vans with travelers headed in 
opposite directions to maximize profits. 
</P>
<P>
The problems reached their peak last year when the airport instituted a 
temporary moratorium on shuttle licenses, although the number of shuttle vans 
continued to grow from about 500 to 700. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the airport has started a new system in which all shuttle stops are 
monitored to ensure proper service. 
</P>
<P>
The possible lifting of the interim moratorium is scheduled to be discussed by 
the commission today. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what this is all about," Lobner said. "The expiration of the moratorium 
will cause increased competition and the industry does not want that to 
happen."

BOARD PUTS OFF MENTAL HEALTH CUTS; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: SUPERVISORS GIVE THEMSELVES TIME TO DETERMINE HOW TO LESSEN IMPACT. 
THEY MAY IMPOSE A UTILITY USER TAX, RAISE BUSINESS LICENSE FEES AND SQUEEZE 
OTHER DEPARTMENTS.

<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday postponed drastic cuts 
to the county mental health department to give itself one more week to figure 
out how to squeeze money from other county departments and consider the 
possibility of new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the meeting it appeared that cuts eventually would have to be 
made, though not as deep as the $41.9 million projected by the county and 
feared by some of the 650 patients, clinic administrators and counselors who 
packed the supervisors' hearing room. The supervisors also delayed sending out 
legally required 30-day termination notices to 42 mental health clinics under 
contract with the county. 
</P>
<P>
The tax option is being pushed by Supervisors Ed Edelman and Kenneth Hahn. It 
would make use of new county powers to levy utility user taxes and higher 
business license fees. Previously, only cities had the power to tax utility use 
and business license fees could not amount to more than the cost of issuing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
About 1 million residents in unincorporated areas of the county would be 
affected by the taxes, generating annual revenues of $31.5 million, according 
to Edelman. Most county residents already pay utility taxes because their 
cities impose them. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, county Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon has 
ordered county department heads to begin implementing in January austerity 
measures originally scheduled for July 1. He believes this could free roughly 
$15 million for use in the mental health system. 
</P>
<P>
Those austerity measures were drafted in anticipation of another state revenue 
shortfall for the 1991-1992 fiscal year. The state had $3.2 billion less than 
it needed for this year, triggering large cuts in state aid to mental and 
public health programs. 
</P>
<P>
Next year looks worse. A state finance commission on Tuesday forecast that 
California will end the current budget year in the red and face a shortfall of 
more than $4 billion in the fiscal year beginning July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates for the mentally ill say $15 million is not nearly enough to save 
clinics. They want at least $10 million more. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Pete Schabarum, an outspoken foe of new taxes, was unenthusiastic 
about Edelman's utility tax idea, but he did not rule it out. 
</P>
<P>
He complained bitterly that for four years the state has failed to meet its 
funding obligations for mental health. To make matters worse, he said, a Los 
Angeles Superior Court judge last week blocked $7.6 million in already-ordered 
service cuts at county hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Another $12.7 million in budget-balancing public health cuts were scheduled for 
action next month, but Dixon warned the supervisors that the court's ruling 
leaves them with only "questionable ability to effect those reductions." 
</P>
<P>
That also leaves the county looking for sources for that money. Hopes for 
timely bailouts -- from the Proposition 134 liquor tax and through an appeal to 
Gov.-elect Pete Wilson -- have been all but dashed. Voters defeated the liquor 
tax and Wilson has not been encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a great deal of sympathy for counties and cities," said Otto Bos, a 
top aide to Wilson. "Pete has said he'd like to work with them to try to bring 
some order. But I'm not in a position to tell them right now we have a bundle 
of money set aside for the state to come in and help them out." 
</P>
<P>
Unwilling to rush into cuts or tax levies, the board instead voted unanimously 
(Mike Antonovich was absent) to delay not only the decision on service 
cutbacks, but also the issuance of the 30-day contract termination notices. 
</P>
<P>
If all $41.9 million in service cuts were imposed, 27,000 of the 52,000 
patients currently receiving care would be dropped, according to Richard Van 
Horn, chief executive officer of the Mental Health Assn. of Los Angeles County. 
The mental health system would be trimmed to respond only to crises and the 
most severely disturbed patients. Few dispute that the conditions of those left 
without stabilizing treatment would deteriorate, adding to the ranks of the 
homeless and putting additional burdens on police and prisons. 
</P>
<P>
"It can't be emphasized enough the importance of delaying those notices," Ann 
Lodwig Brand, executive director of the Assn. of Community Mental Health 
Agencies, said after the meeting. "If they had gone out, we all would have gone 
forward with layoff notices, client discharges, breaking our leases. And we 
have no place to discharge our clients to." 
</P>
<P>
Brand added that the uncertainty of the situation had already led to losses of 
talented staff. She and other advocates nevertheless were encouraged by the 
supervisors' willingness to delay the cuts, even as the county incurs $550,000 
in unfunded expenditures for each week mental and public health service cuts 
are postponed.

OFFICER REMOVED FROM TASK FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the original police investigators assigned to a multi-agency task force 
probing the murders of dozens of prostitutes and transients during the past 
five years has been removed from the group for having a personal relationship 
with someone connected with the investigation, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Harold E. Goudarzi, 43, with the San Diego Police Department for 21 years, 
was reassigned about a month ago to the department's missing-persons division 
after it was discovered he had a relationship with someone who was providing 
information to the task force, said a source close to the task force. 
</P>
<P>
The source would not disclose with whom Goudarzi was involved, but said the 
person "was not a target of the investigation. It was someone connected with 
the investigation. That could be a witness or a source of information." 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone on the task force takes misconduct very seriously, given the nature 
of what the task force is investigating," the source said. "I don't know what 
the guy could have been thinking about." 
</P>
<P>
Goudarzi was one of the original nine investigators assigned to the 
Metropolitan Homicide Task Force, which is composed of members of the San Diego 
Police Department, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department and the district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
The task force, created in August, 1988, is investigating the deaths of 
prostitutes and transients killed since 1985, when prostitute and police 
informant Donna Gentile was found murdered, her mouth stuffed with gravel. 
Since then, 42 more prostitutes or transients have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
In September, the task force expanded from 10 to 21 members and split into 
three groups: one in charge of the Gentile murder, one in charge of the other 
murders and one in charge of possible police misconduct in connection with 
prostitutes because of the way Gentile was found murdered. The gravel in 
Gentile's mouth was taken as a sign that she might have been killed for 
testifying against police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Goudarzi worked with the group investigating the 42 murders. Before joining the 
task force, he worked in the Police Department's robbery and homicide 
divisions. He also had worked in the Eastern Division, where officers dealt 
with prostitutes who worked along El Cajon Boulevard. Some of the prostitutes 
found murdered had also worked that street. 
</P>
<P>
Goudarzi could not be reached for comment Tuesday. Police spokesman Bill 
Robinson confirmed that Goudarzi is now assigned to the missing-persons 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide task force spokeswoman Bonnie Dumanis said she would not discuss task 
force personnel matters. State Deputy Atty. Gen. Gary Schons, who is leading 
the branch of the investigation dealing with police corruption, also refused to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Police Chief Norm Stamper, who spent several months personally 
reviewing the investigation at the request of Police Chief Bob Burgreen, said 
he had no comment on Goudarzi. 
</P>
<P>
"We just cannot discuss personnel matters, as a matter of law," Stamper said. 
"And I will not discuss anything that would impede the progress of the task 
force. It's worked so far." 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear what effect Goudarzi's reassignment might have on 
the credibility of the task force, which had been criticized for having police 
officers investigate members of their own department. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the state attorney general's office had protested the agency's 
move to join the task force because the department was also involved in the 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
At least five police officers and one former officer are under scrutiny for 
their possible connections to Gentile and missing prostitute Cynthia Maine, who 
disappeared in February, 1986, after detailing for internal-affairs 
investigators which officers were involved with prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
The source close to the task force said the investigation was in no way 
jeopardized by Goudarzi's removal. 
</P>
<P>
The task force "is still doing business as usual," the source said.

BRADLEY FACES FUND-RAISING INQUIRY; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: AUTHORITIES WILL INVESTIGATE MISCONDUCT CHARGES. A MAYOR'S SPOKESMAN 
DENIES ANY WRONGDOING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department and other state and local agencies will 
investigate fund-raising activities of Mayor Tom Bradley's appointees and 
aides, including possible misuse of city resources for campaign purposes, a 
police spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be conducting an investigation . . . in a cooperative effort with the 
district attorney's office and the (state Fair Political Practices 
Commission,)" said Cmdr. William Booth. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the district attorney's office earlier had offered to cooperate 
in such an investigation and provide a prosecutor from a unit that probes 
political corruption cases. 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC has said it is reviewing the fund-raising activities. 
</P>
<P>
Booth said the three-agency investigation will involve activities reported in 
recent Times articles. He said some of the activities "could constitute 
criminal conduct." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley could not be reached late Tuesday, his office said. But Bradley press 
secretary Bill Chandler said: "The mayor has always insisted his staff and 
commissioners obey both the letter and spirit of the law." 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported last week that Bradley aides and appointees raised more than 
$700,000 over the past five years. Several city commissioners held fund-raisers 
in their homes that yielded thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from 
lobbyists, developers, city contractors and others doing business with their 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Also, records and interviews indicated that Bradley City Hall aides operated a 
political fund-raising network in City Hall that used city telephones, 
secretaries, equipment and possibly staff time. 
</P>
<P>
State law prohibits use of city resources, including offices and equipment, for 
campaign purposes. Prosecutions have been rare, but violations can be felonies. 
</P>
<P>
Another state law bans commissioners from raising funds from those with matters 
pending before their agencies and violations can lead to fines. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners have denied violating the law or said any violations were 
unintentional. Bradley aides have said their actions were proper or declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Generally defending his fund-raising activities, Bradley earlier Tuesday said 
that in 17 years in office he has never "asked a commissioner to conduct any 
kind of fund raising on my behalf or for me." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's remark was part of his first public response to The Times' 
disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
However, the mayor's comment appeared to be at odds with his actions of last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1989, Bradley summoned several prominent city commissioners and 
other supporters to his city-owned Hancock Park residence to seek help in 
raising $300,000 for legal bills in connection with investigations of his 
personal finances and official actions. 
</P>
<P>
Several of those who attended the well-publicized gathering, including 
Bradley's appointees to city commissions, said at the time that the mayor asked 
them to collect contributions for a legal defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
"I need you to see if you can get some friends to raise some money," City 
Zoning Commissioner Nikolas Patsaouras quoted Bradley as saying at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The legal defense committee has since raise several hundred thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Public records show that several of the commissioners Bradley asked for help 
later conveyed contributions to the committee. They included Airport 
Commissioner Johnnie L. Cochran Jr.; Recreation and Parks Commissioner Bill 
Robertson; City Housing Commissioner Dori Pye; former Building Advisory Appeals 
Board President Patric Mayers, and Convention Center Commissioner Madelyn 
Murray. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who has declined to be interviewed on the fund-raising activities, 
made only brief comments Tuesday before leaving a City Hall news conference on 
an unrelated matter. 
</P>
<P>
Asked afterward about the apparent conflict between Bradley's statement and his 
actions of last year, Bradley's press secretary, Bill Chandler, declined to 
comment directly. But he said "the 1989 meeting was no exception" to the 
mayor's insistence that staff and commissioners follow the law, Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also said Tuesday that fund raising and his city appointments are 
unrelated. "Never have I appointed or removed anyone from a commission based 
upon any contribution which they may have made, or any solicitation which they 
may or may not have made," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Bradley's appointees had complained that conflict-of-interest laws are 
confusing and the city attorney, the mayor's office and the mayor's campaign 
aides never adequately alerted them to potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said Tuesday that his practice for many years has been to have new 
commissioners briefed on the law by the city attorney.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHARGES FILED AGAINST POT BUNKER SUSPECTS 
</P>

The Los Angeles County district attorney's office filed charges Tuesday against 
a Lancaster contractor described as the central figure in a major marijuana 
production ring that dug high-tech underground farms in the Antelope Valley and 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Gegax, who surrendered last week, was charged with cultivation, 
possession and maintaining a place for manufacture and distribution of 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged Tuesday was Richard F. Yerger, 28, of Long Beach, owner of a house 
east of Lancaster under which federal drug agents and sheriff's deputies last 
week found a concrete bunker housing what authorities described as the most 
sophisticated marijuana production operation ever encountered in Los Angeles 
County, capable of producing between $75 million and $150 million worth of 
marijuana a year. 
</P>
<P>
A second plantation was discovered under a house in the community of Llano last 
week, and two more were raided Oct. 30 by federal drug agents in Arizona.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 50 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS STAGE PROTEST AT INS 
OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 50 illegal immigrants demonstrated Tuesday in front of an Immigration and 
Naturalization Service office in the Pico-Union district to protest the 
agency's alleged out-of-hand dismissal of hundreds of late amnesty 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
The rally, organized by the Coalition for Humane Immigration Rights of Los 
Angeles, protested the agency's insistence on what organizers said is an 
extraordinary amount of documentation to support late applications. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators also called for the dismissal of INS official Debra Perez, 
head of the Pico-Union office. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to force the INS to deal with these aliens fairly," said attorney and 
protest organizer Cesar Noriega-Pena. "They aren't right now." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, a federal judge ordered the INS to accept applications beyond the 
original sign-up deadline from immigrants who had been told they were 
ineligible because they either improperly used visas to return to the United 
States during the initial sign-up period or left this country without INS 
permission. Mary Ellen Elwood, INS associate director for legalization in the 
western states, said the Pico-Union office has been properly reviewing late 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
She said the rejection rate of the late applications has hovered near 90% 
because of the extensive use of fraudulent documents. 
</P>
<P>
The late-application program, believed to affect about 40,000 aliens in Los 
Angeles, has been a source of irritation between the INS and immigrant-rights 
advocates. Archbishop Roger M. Mahony recently accused the INS of "bad faith" 
for rejecting many of the late applications. 
</P>
<P>
"As for Debra Perez, she's been in charge of the training sessions there (for 
late amnesty) and we've been in full compliance with the court order," Elwood 
said.

PROBE LEADS TO REMOVAL OF UCSD DOCTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. David Sahn has been removed as head of the pediatric cardiology division at 
UC San Diego Medical Center, following reports that the hospital is being 
investigated for Medi-Cal fraud and the death of an infant while under the care 
of an unlicensed physician. 
</P>
<P>
Although hospital spokeswoman Leslie Franz said Tuesday that Sahn "was asked to 
step aside," she insisted that the action was not punitive. Sahn was replaced 
by Dr. Kyung Chung, an associate adjunct professor in the division of pediatric 
cardiology, who was named acting head of the division. 
</P>
<P>
"This move does not alter Dr. Sahn's status within the division as a faculty 
member," Franz said. 
</P>
<P>
The change was quietly announced to the staff Monday, and became effective the 
same day, she added. 
</P>
<P>
According to Franz, Dr. Michael Kaback, UCSD chairman of the department of 
pediatrics, asked Sahn to give up the post. 
</P>
<P>
"In light of the events of the last few months, the (hospital's) internal 
review and the state looking at the medical story, based on all this, (Kaback) 
felt it was in the best interest of the division to appoint a new acting 
division chief," Franz added. 
</P>
<P>
The events alluded to by Franz, include a recent revelation that a 3-year-old 
Tijuana boy, Luis Diego Jimenez, died of a "drug related accident" at the 
hospital July 10. According to a coroner's autopsy, the youngster died after he 
was given a sedative drawn into an oral syringe by Dr. Azucena Murillo. 
</P>
<P>
Murillo, who has an office in Tijuana, is not licensed to practice in the 
United States. Instead, she worked as a research associate in pediatric 
cardiology at the hospital. Hospital officials said Murillo gave the syringe to 
the child's mother, who administered it to her son. 
</P>
<P>
The little boy, who had a deformed heart, died shortly after being given the 
sedative by his mother. Officials from the state Board of Medical Quality 
Assurance said they would investigate Murillo for practicing medicine without a 
license. 
</P>
<P>
Sahn reportedly attempted to dissuade the boy's family from allowing an autopsy 
to be performed by the County Medical Examiner's office. A spokeswoman for an 
attorney representing the child's family said Sahn argued that UCSD Medical 
Center pathologists were more qualified to do the autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Davis M. Ward, assistant dean of clinical affairs at UCSD, was quoted as 
saying there was nothing improper about Sahn's request to have the autopsy 
performed at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Last month the division of pediatric cardiology was the center of another 
controversy, when state officials began investigating reports that medical care 
for as many as 100 Mexican children who suffered from heart problems was 
illegally paid for through Medi-Cal funds. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the state Department of Health Services believe the hospital may 
have improperly billed the state for at least $1 million. State investigators 
believe the children were first seen at a Tijuana clinic where UCSD doctors 
volunteer. Parents of the children were then given letters for U.S. immigration 
officials certifying that the children would be treated at UCSD without 
taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
State investigators charged that UCSD officials impeded their investigation by 
initially blocking attempts to interview staff members and not making key 
documents available to them. The documents were not made available to 
investigators until subpoenas were delivered for them. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, spokeswoman Franz said the hospital is conducting its own 
investigation into the allegations of illegal Medi-Cal billings. 
</P>
<P>
Sahn, who was not implicated in the Medi-Cal investigation, was not available 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Murillo, who was implicated in the death of the Tijuana toddler, is also being 
investigated by the state for possible Medi-Cal fraud. Another physician, Dr. 
Lilliam M. Valdea Cruz, and a secretary, Mercedes A. Alvarado, are also under 
investigation by the state. The three are suspected of coaching the parents of 
the Mexican children on how to qualify for free care.

A 28-year-old man who planned to move from Pennsylvania to Westlake was killed 
traveling down the Conejo Grade on Tuesday morning when he swerved to avoid 
materials on the highway and was hit broadside by an 18-wheel tractor-trailer, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Mohan Thurairaj, who had just completed a degree in engineering, died of 
internal injuries at 10:42 a.m. at Los Robles Regional Medical Center, Deputy 
Coroner Jim Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
Thurairaj's parents live in India, Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger, Ramesh A. Kasilingam, 28, of Altadena, was treated at the hospital 
for minor injuries, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the truck, Ronald Lee Papez, and his passenger, Robert M. 
Parjell, both 42-year-old Covina residents, were uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
Thurairaj was driving north on the Ventura Freeway north of Camarillo Springs 
Road about 9:55 a.m. when he swerved into the truck's lane to avoid a blue 
container that had fallen from a pickup truck, the CHP reported. Papez was 
unable to avoid hitting Thurairaj's car, which spun 180 degrees into his lane.

RANCHO SANTIAGO IN FUND-RAISING DRIVE

<TEXT>
<P>
Rancho Santiago College officials announced Tuesday that they are embarking on 
a fund-raising effort that could bring more than $5 million to the college in 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
To receive the money, which is awarded through the U.S. Department of 
Education's Endowment Challenge Grants program, the school must raise $500,000 
by October, 1991, said David Valentine, a member of the Rancho Santiago College 
Foundation Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
"This is certainly historic," Valentine said. "We have never raised $500,000 
before and we've never had the possibility of having this big a chunk of money 
come in." 
</P>
<P>
If the college raises the $500,000, it will receive an additional $1 million 
from the federal government, which has agreed to pay the college $2 for every 
dollar it raises. 
</P>
<P>
Although the college will not be able to spend any of the $1.5 million for 20 
years, it will have access to 50% of the interest. That would amount to a 
minimum of $2.5 million over the next 20 years, Valentine said. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.5 million and the remaining 50% interest must remain invested for 20 
years. After that, the college will be able to spend both the principal and the 
interest, which together are expected to be at least $5 million, Valentine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising efforts, which have already yielded $100,000, are being led by the 
mayors of Santa Ana, Orange and Garden Grove, the three cities in which the 
college has campuses. 
</P>
<P>
"This college plays an extremely important role in Santa Ana," Santa Ana Mayor 
Daniel H. Young said. "Thousands of our students continue their higher 
education here so we're very interested in the success of the school. I think 
the financial goals we have set are very much achievable." 
</P>
<P>
The college, which celebrated its 75th anniversary this year, plans to use the 
money for student and faculty support programs, scholarships, athletic 
equipment and facilities, classroom equipment and materials, and new library 
books. GREG HERNANDEZ

KEYS RESIDENTS FILE POLLUTION CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Ventura has received 87 legal claims in the past week from 
residents of the Ventura Keys, a posh waterfront neighborhood just west of 
Ventura Harbor, demanding that the city clean up their polluted waterways. 
</P>
<P>
The claims, the first step in filing a lawsuit, allege that the city is 
responsible for coliform counts far in excess of federal standards for the Keys 
Channels, designated as a water sports area. 
</P>
<P>
Residents are also demanding that the city dredge the Keys and reimburse them 
for losses in property values resulting from the contamination, said attorney 
Don Adams, a spokesman for the homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
The city has 45 days to respond to the claims, after which the plaintiffs will 
have up to six months to file suit, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
Keys residents say city drain runoffs are largely responsible for pollution. 
They have told the City Council that unless a compromise is reached, they will 
sue the city before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Keys residents would seek $100 million to $150 million in compensatory damages, 
Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Todd Collart said Monday that he hoped that a lawsuit could be 
averted, but negotiations between the two parties have dragged on fruitlessly 
for months. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say Keys residents -- not city taxpayers -- should pay for the 
bulk of the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Baker said he believed that the area was erroneously 
designated as a water sports area because most marinas in the state do not have 
that designation. He said he will seek a change in the designation, which would 
eliminate restrictions on high coliform counts. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 24, after a sewage spill was detected, the city closed the area's two 
small beaches and banned swimming in the channels. The ban is still in effect. 
</P>
<P>
As for dredging, city officials say they are responsible for only one-fourth of 
the silt accumulation in the channels, and they have offered to pay 25% of the 
dredging costs -- an offer that the residents have rejected. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OUT-OF-STATE INSURANCE RULED LAST RECOURSE 
ONLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consumers must prove they have exhausted all options before they will be 
allowed to buy car insurance out of state, a judge in Los Angeles ruled. 
</P>
<P>
With the Tuesday ruling, Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs upheld a 
regulation imposed Friday by the state Department of Insurance to curtail the 
"skyrocketing" number of people buying insurance in other states. 
</P>
<P>
The new regulation requires that before buying out of the state, consumers must 
prove they've been rejected by the California Automobile Assigned Risk Plan, 
which provides coverage in almost all circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency regulation was prompted by reports between the second and third 
quarters of 1990 that the amount paid to out-of-state insurers was more than 
$2.75 million, said Insurance Department attorney Dana Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, consumers may buy liability coverage from out-of-state 
carriers when they have been turned down by three firms licensed to do business 
in California.

BALLOT BID ON BUYING WATER FALLS SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Assn. of Quality Water Alternatives has apparently failed to gather enough 
signatures in its bid to allow Ventura voters to decide whether to buy water 
from the State Water Project. 
</P>
<P>
Association leader Robert McCord said Tuesday that his group had collected 
5,597 signatures, about 1,500 signatures short of the number needed to be 
gathered through today. 
</P>
<P>
He would not comment on why the attempt failed. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ballot measure had the support of the Ventura Chamber of Commerce, 
the Ventura Board of Realtors, and most commercial and development interests in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the group's setback follows a unanimous City Council vote Monday 
approving an environmental study on a 42-mile pipeline that would hook up the 
city with Lake Castaic, a State Water Project reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
The study is precisely what the ballot initiative sought -- to get the council 
to begin taking positive steps toward building the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people have more faith in the council than those people out there 
making noise," said Councilman Gary Tuttle, the only member to go on record 
opposing the pipeline. "They knew we were headed in the direction of studying 
the pipeline, and they decided to let us do our job." SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRM HIRED TO DESIGN RAIL AND BUS STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Newport Beach architectural firm has been hired to draft plans for converting 
the old Santa Fe depot in Claremont into a combined rail and bus station for 
commuters. 
</P>
<P>
The $97,000 contract was awarded to Thirtieth Street Architects, which 
submitted the lower of two bids on the design phase of the project. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's representatives estimated that the work will be completed by May. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Algird G. Leiga said Proposition A money earmarked for the 
project would be better used on immediate improvements to public transportation 
in the city. The commuter trains that would use the renovated depot are not 
expected to run until fall, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Nicholas Presecan said the city must move quickly "so that we won't 
be standing at the track without the trains going by."

PROPOSED SCHOOL LAYOFFS PROTESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 150 union members, teachers and parents packed the boardroom of the 
Orange Unified School District this week to protest the proposed layoffs of 79 
classified employees. 
</P>
<P>
After the district signed a two-year contract with the classified workers 
earlier this month, Supt. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Guith gathered school principals and employees at the district office 
last week to announce the proposed cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement took union officials by surprise, said Becky Mayers, union 
representative for Local 67 of the Classified School Employees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"This is about the coldest thing I think I've ever seen," Mayers said. "Usually 
we are conferred with about layoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Mayers said the union agreed to approve retirement incentives and made other 
concessions during negotiations to avert staff cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told during negotiations that there would be some layoffs," Mayers 
said. "They never indicated there would be seventy-some people." 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs, which would save the district $1.2 million in one year, would 
affect workers with the least seniority, including 39 school clerks, 22 
maintenance workers and 10 employees from the district office. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of ideas on how we can offset layoffs, but we have to be given 
the chance," Mayers said. 
</P>
<P>
A flurry of protests following last week's announcement prompted the school 
board to schedule meetings to discuss the issue later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Jeff Holstien said the district administration may have moved 
prematurely in proposing the layoffs before examining all options. Holstien 
said the board "would explore every possible source of income" before resorting 
to layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"This board of education cares about the employees of the district and plans to 
do everything in its power to treat its employees with care and humanity," 
Holstien said. 
</P>
<P>
School board members plan to discuss the issue at the Dec. 6 board meeting.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WATER DISTRICT UNVEILS PLAN TO FIGHT 
DROUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Metropolitan Water District, which serves about 15 million people in 
Southern California, unveiled a plan Tuesday to deal with the on-going drought. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the plan will go into effect Dec. 1 and involves cash 
incentives and disincentives and improvements in storage and management, said 
Carl Boronkay, general manager of the Los Angeles based utility. 
</P>
<P>
The 27 public agencies making up the district's membership will be asked to 
voluntarily reduce their monthly usage. Subsequent phases will involve planned 
use of regional reservoir and ground water reserves and surcharges to agencies 
that exceed assigned monthly quotas. 
</P>
<P>
"Four consecutive dry years have created a threat to our water supplies never 
before experienced by Southern California," Boronkay said. "In light of 
precariously low water levels in State Water Project storage reservoirs and the 
potential for reduced diversions from the Colorado River, this plan is 
necessary if we are to minimize hardships in our homes and businesses."

PANEL IS CRITICAL OF POLICE ACTS; 
</P>
<P>
DEMONSTRATION: COMMISSION SAYS OFFICERS' OVERZEALOUSNESS LED TO VIOLENCE IN 
JANITORS' PROTEST MARCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Commission on Tuesday concluded that a protest by 
striking janitors last summer turned violent because police were overzealous in 
chasing protesters who refused to disperse and because union organizers were 
too secretive about their plans. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen people were injured and more than 40 were arrested during the June 15 
confrontation, which took place as the Justice for Janitors march moved on 
Century City. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which was ordered by Mayor Tom Bradley to investigate the 
incident, also called for changes in the way Los Angeles police officers handle 
protest marches, and recommended development of a departmentwide training 
program to teach officers how to deal with demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
The march turned ugly when 100 police officers formed a line and attempted to 
disperse the crowd as it headed toward Century City. The marchers linked arms 
and walked defiantly toward the officers. 
</P>
<P>
Justice for Janitors, the group that sponsored the demonstration, later said 
that most of those injured suffered broken bones and concussions, and one woman 
had a miscarriage. They also said that during the scuffle, police knocked many 
of the demonstrators to the ground, and chased others to an underground parking 
area where more arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Police Commission's investigation laid responsibility for the 
confrontation on both police supervisors and union organizers, the commission 
was particularly critical of the officers who pursued the fleeing 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Daryl F. Gates agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the department is not and was not happy with what occurred on that 
particular day," Gates said. "We've been dealing with labor disputes for years 
and are pretty proud of how we've done. But this is one of those unfortunate 
incidents where it did not work." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the officers should have maintained their composure and not 
hunted down those marchers who ran to the garage. "We should have stopped at 
the curb," he said. "We broke down our line and that was a break in our 
discipline." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ragen, an organizer for Local 399 of the Hospital and Service Employees 
Union, said the garage was where much of the police brutality occurred. "That's 
where a lot of people got beaten and hurt trying to get the hell out of there," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also determined that police did not adequately announce their 
dispersal order, a fact that James Wood, the No. 2 official with the Los 
Angeles County Federation of Labor, said could have prevented many injuries. "A 
30-second order to disperse is unreasonable," he said. "You can't comply." 
</P>
<P>
The commission also called for greater communication between police and 
demonstration organizers in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Reva B. Tooley pointed out that union members "were less than 
forthcoming" in their march plans, "thereby depriving the (Police) Department 
of valuable information and insight in what was bound to be a volatile 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
"For its part," she said, "the department failed to stay in touch with union 
leaders along the route and thereby missed the opportunity to enlist their aid 
in controlling a situation they believed was escalating."

SUSPECTED RINGLEADER CHARGED IN UNDERGROUND POT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office filed charges Tuesday against 
a Lancaster contractor described as the central figure in a major marijuana 
production ring that dug high-tech underground farms in the Antelope Valley and 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Gegax, who surrendered last week, was charged with cultivation, 
possession, and maintaining a place for manufacture and distribution of 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged Tuesday was Richard F. Yerger, 28, of Long Beach, owner of a house 
east of Lancaster under which federal drug agents and sheriff's deputies last 
week found a concrete bunker housing a farm equipped with an irrigation system 
and plant-growing lights. Authorities described it as the most sophisticated 
marijuana production operation ever encountered in Los Angeles County, capable 
of producing between $75 million and $150 million worth of marijuana a year. 
</P>
<P>
A second plantation was found under a house in the community of Llano last 
week, and two more were raided Oct. 30 by federal drug agents in Bullhead, 
Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence shows that the 48-year-old Gegax was "the main man" in the operation, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen L. Cooley said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the brains," Cooley said Tuesday. "He is the central figure in 
Lancaster and Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
Cooley's description of Gegax as the head man was the first indication that 
investigators believe they have located the leadership of the production 
network, which the commander of the sheriff's narcotics unit described as a 
major distributor of marijuana in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Yerger was a "junior partner" who acted as the nominal owner of the property 
near Lancaster where Gegax -- owner of KMG Construction in Lancaster -- funded 
and built the sophisticated plantation, Cooley said. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster Municipal Judge Ian Grant set bail for Yerger at $2 million and his 
arraignment was continued until Nov. 27. Yerger will appear in court along with 
two men who were charged Monday. Deputies have described the two men as 
low-level accomplices. 
</P>
<P>
Gegax, who is in federal custody in downtown Los Angeles, also faces federal 
charges in Phoenix alleging conspiracy to sell marijuana. More arrests are 
possible, Cooley said. 
</P>
<P>
One suspect still sought for questioning is Yerger's father, Richard E. Yerger, 
owner of the Llano property where one of the underground farms was found. The 
Llano farm was built this year, authorities said, and the farm near Lancaster 
apparently had operated for about two years.

MURDER CASE: PROSECUTORS SEEK AN INDEPENDENT EXAM OF WITNESS TO SHOOTING. SHE 
REMAINS IN PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL IN TAHITI.

<P>
Despite winning a legal skirmish Tuesday, prosecutors in the Christian Brando 
murder case said they will drop further efforts to secure testimony from the 
suspect's half sister, Cheyenne Brando, if doctors declare her mental or 
physical health too fragile. 
</P>
<P>
"If we determine that Cheyenne Brando cannot come to the U.S. because it would 
be detrimental to her physically or emotionally, then we will not pursue her 
further," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven Barshop. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the district attorney's five-month effort to bring her back from 
Tahiti is "predicated on her ability to be an able witness. We will do nothing 
to hurt her as a human being. That is not our intention." 
</P>
<P>
Barshop said prosecutors will repeat their request to French authorities for an 
independent medical examination of the 20-year-old daughter of actor Marlon 
Brando. She remains in a psychiatric hospital following two suicide attempts 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Barshop said that prosecutors will continue to take the necessary legal steps 
to make her return possible. 
</P>
<P>
"We have gone to the federal District Court, the local Superior Court, the 
California Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal," Barshop said. "Today, the 
Court of Appeal agreed with our legal position." 
</P>
<P>
The state's 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled Tuesday that Los Angeles County 
Superior Court Judge Joel Rudof erred when he said he did not have authority to 
issue a formal request for assistance from a foreign jurisdiction, in this case 
Tahiti, in returning a witness to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court noted that it was not deciding whether Rudof should grant 
the prosecution's request for the letter, whether a federal court should issue 
a subpoena to accompany it, or whether Cheyenne Brando is capable of traveling 
to Los Angeles to testify. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have said that Cheyenne Brando is the key witness in their case 
against Christian Brando, who is charged with murdering her lover, Dag Drollet. 
Having spent the evening of May 16 -- the night of the shooting -- with 
Christian, she is the only witness who could testify about his state of mind 
and the events leading up to Drollet's death, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Brando, 32, has admitted shooting Drollet after his sister said that 
he had beaten her, but he maintains that the gun went off accidentally during a 
struggle between the two men. 
</P>
<P>
His trial has been delayed by the prosecution's inability to get a clear answer 
about Cheyenne Brando's wishes, condition and legal status in Tahiti.

She has said that she wants to return to testify. She has been hospitalized 
five times since returning to her home in Tahiti in June. French authorities 
have seized her passport, pending the outcome of a complaint filed there 
accusing her of being an accessory in Drollet's murder. 
</P>
<P>
No new trial date has been set, and jury selection is not expected to begin 
before January. Lawyers have 30 days to appeal Tuesday's decision.

Defense attorney Robert Shapiro said that he had given a letter to the district 
attorney from the chief psychiatrist at the hospital where Cheyenne Brando is 
being treated, stating that she had made two suicide attempts and that her 
emotional and mental state requires her hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's father, Jacques Drollet, said in Tahiti that the young woman is 
being prevented from testifying by her family. She "knows things and she wants 
to tell the truth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not crazy, she's very sound and clear," said Drollet. "Her family and 
Marlon Brando are keeping her away," from Los Angeles.

COUNTY'S FINANCIAL PICTURE BRIGHTENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors has been girding for state funding cuts of $5.8 
million this fiscal year, but a revised assessment of the reductions now comes 
to $4.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the county's contingency fund is $841,700 richer than anticipated 
last summer. Last week, the supervisors allocated $391,700 of that money to 
restore juvenile offender services cut from the budget last summer. On Tuesday, 
they earmarked the remaining $450,000 to restore legal services for the poor. 
All the restored programs are mandated by the state. 
</P>
<P>
The slightly brighter financial picture doesn't mean the supervisors will back 
off from an earlier decision to increase revenues by charging cities a fee to 
book inmates into jail and assessing districts for property tax collection. 
</P>
<P>
While those new funding sources will probably be challenged in court, any money 
that comes from them is "absolutely essential for the county to maintain 
current program services and also to consider any further restoration of state 
budget cuts," Richard Wittenberg, chief administrative officer for the county, 
said in a report to supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The additional $841,700 in the contingency fund is primarily money for mental 
health services that has gone unspent. Using the money to restore the programs 
will leave the county's general fund with about $1 million in contingency funds 
during the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The $841,700 will pay for expert witnesses and investigative services for 
indigent defendants. It will also continue to fund a program aimed at 
rehabilitating first-time juvenile offenders and maintain another program that 
closely supervises juvenile offenders who have committed serious offenses after 
their release from work camps. It will also help pay for attorneys in juvenile 
cases and continue to provide shelter and counseling for youths. 
</P>
<P>
The state funding cuts are not as severe as anticipated because funding of 
certain programs was increased, county officials said. Almost all of the 
new-found state money already has been pumped back into state-mandated mental 
health programs. JANE HULSE

BAIL SET AT $350,000 FOR INS AGENT ARRESTED IN CALEXICO; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: HE AND TWO WOMEN ARE CHARGED WITH CONSPIRACY TO SMUGGLE COCAINE THROUGH 
PORT OF ENTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Bail was set at $350,000 Tuesday for a U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service inspector charged with conspiring to allow drug traffickers to smuggle 
cocaine through the Calexico Port of Entry. 
</P>
<P>
Sergio Gonzalez, an eight-year INS employee, was arrested Friday by FBI agents 
and charged with conspiracy to smuggle 110 pounds of cocaine. Also arrested 
were Josephine Flores, 27, and her mother, Guadalupe Flores. No age was given 
for the elder Flores. Gonzalez is from El Centro, and the two women are from 
Calexico, in Imperial County. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez's arrest marks the second corruption case involving U.S. officials in 
two weeks. Last week, David Henry Brown, a U.S. Customs employee with access to 
sensitive computer records, pleaded guilty to charges that he sold information 
about a drug investigation to a man with ties to drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The recent arrests resulted from an undercover investigation by FBI agents, who 
were told by an informant about an inspector at Calexico who allowed drugs to 
be smuggled across the border in exchange for money. According to Assistant 
U.S. Atty. John Pierce, agents were put in contact with Josephine Flores, who 
allegedly claimed to be a Customs inspector. 
</P>
<P>
When confronted by undercover agents in September about her claim to be a 
federal employee, Flores admitted that she did not work for Customs, but told 
agents she could introduce them to Gonzalez, Pierce said. Agents met with 
Gonzalez in October to arrange a drug deal. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, 41, allegedly agreed to wave through a car carrying 50 kilos of 
cocaine, driven by an undercover agent and accompanied by Josephine Flores. The 
deal was set for Friday, but no drugs were actually transported by the agent, 
Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a federal account of the incident, Guadalupe Flores positioned 
herself near the border crossing to direct her daughter and the agent to the 
lane where Gonzalez was working. 
</P>
<P>
"When they approached Gonzalez's lane, he waved them through," Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
After Gonzalez finished his shift Friday, he drove to a nearby shopping mall, 
where he had allegedly agreed to meet the agents and pick up the drug payoff. 
Gonzalez was arrested, and the two women were taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing Monday, Pierce told U.S. Magistrate Barry Ted Moskowitz that 
Josephine Flores was charging an additional $10,000 to guide drug loads through 
the lane worked by Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
Bail for Gonzalez was set at $350,000, and the two women were ordered held on 
$75,000 bail each. Pierce said Gonzalez, who is on paid administrative leave, 
could be sentenced to 10 years to life in prison and fined up to $4 million, if 
convicted. The two women, who were also charged with conspiracy to smuggle 
cocaine, could receive the same sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gonzalez was charged with only one conspiracy count, federal 
prosecutors are also looking at the possibility of charging him with bribery, 
Pierce said. The prosecutor said he did not know how many drug loads Gonzalez 
might have allowed to pass through the port before his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents tape-recorded a conversation with Gonzalez on Oct. 22, in which he 
reportedly said his "flat rate" for allowing drug-laden cars into the United 
States without inspection was "$30,000 per smuggle," court documents show. Four 
days after that conversation, during a test run, undercover agents paid 
Gonzalez $5,000 for waving a vehicle through without inspection, federal 
officials said.

VETERAN OFFICIAL TO QUIT SCHOOL POST 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Allan Jacobs, associate superintendent of the Simi Valley Unified School 
District, said Tuesday that he will resign, although he doesn't know when. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs, who has worked for the district for 18 years, said he wanted to inform 
the school board and the district's new superintendent, Robert Purvis, of his 
intentions well before his departure. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be at the end of this year," said Jacobs, 60, "or it could be at the 
end of next year." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs was among several candidates for the superintendent's job. He said 
Purvis' appointment had no bearing on his decision to resign his $79,252-a-year 
post. 
</P>
<P>
Purvis was appointed by the school board in October to replace John Duncan, who 
resigned to become head of the San Ramon School District in Northern 
California. Purvis will take over Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Three high-ranking administrators have left in the last five months. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Duncan, Pete Rogalsky, senior director of curriculum, resigned 
in July to become head of the Rio Elementary School District in Oxnard, and 
Chet Howe, assistant to the superintendent, retired in June. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs served 13 years as assistant superintendent and the last five as 
associate superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Although the district has experienced deep budget cuts and personnel squabbles 
in the last two years, Jacobs said he was satisfied with what it has 
accomplished in the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
School board member Ken Ashton said Jacobs is well respected. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done an excellent job," he said. "We're losing a valuable individual." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs said that he was unsure of what he will do after he leaves, but that he 
will probably pursue "other options . . . outside education." CARLOS V. LOZANO

BATES GETS 2ND TERM, WILSON PRO TEM POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Almost a year after Laguna Niguel's incorporation, the City Council shifted 
leadership roles just slightly Tuesday night, reelecting Mayor Patricia C. 
Bates to a second one-year term and selecting a new mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
Bates was elected the city's first mayor by her colleagues last December, when 
she outdistanced 23 competitors as Laguna Niguel became Orange County's 29th 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted Tuesday to install Councilman Thomas W. Wilson as mayor 
pro tem, replacing James F. Krembas. 
</P>
<P>
Krembas has been the focus of public criticism for his role in signing a deed 
which relinquished the public's right to 96 acres of open space. A criminal 
investigation is ongoing regarding that transaction, but Krembas is not 
considered a target of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
All Laguna Niguel council members are targeted for recall as a result of the 
positions they have taken on a controversial ordinance to protect the city's 
ridgelines. One recall proponent has lodged a separate complaint against Bates 
with the state Fair Political Practices Commission for allegedly violating a 
conflict of interest law when she continued to chair a meeting while abstaining 
from the vote. LESLIE EARNEST

RAIN ALSO BROUGHT POWER FAILURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The rain that fell on Ventura County late Monday and early Tuesday failed to 
bring the season's rainfall figures up to normal, but it did knock out 
electricity to nearly 20,000 Southern California Edison customers. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 19,800 residences and businesses had power failures lasting from two 
minutes or less to about 15 hours, said Mike Montoya, Edison area manager. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya said the power failures -- mostly in the central and western parts of 
the county -- were caused by the arcing of electrical currents as dirt and dust 
that had accumulated on insulators worked their way to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"It's similar to a short circuit," Montoya said. "It invariably happens during 
the first rain after a long dry spell." 
</P>
<P>
The Edison official said service was restored to 11,000 customers within two 
minutes. In most other cases, he said, power was restored in 30 minutes to an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
But disruptions that affected about 15 Edison customers in the Leland Street 
area of Montalvo were not expected to be restored until early Tuesday evening. 
The power failures began at 3:49 a.m. Tuesday when a power pole caught fire, 
Montoya said. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service predicted mostly fair weather with mild Santa Ana 
conditions through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Weather Service meteorologist Terry Schaeffer said he is "guardedly optimistic" 
that more rain will reach the county in the months ahead. The service's 90-day 
forecast calls for normal rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
This week's rains, pushed here by a cold Alaskan front, were the first in the 
area in about six months. The storm Monday brought 0.57 inches of rain to 
Camarillo, 0.38 inches to the County Government Center in Ventura, 0.35 inches 
to Fillmore, 0.40 inches to Moorpark and Ojai, 0.37 inches to Oxnard, 0.52 
inches to Santa Paula, 0.44 inches to Simi Valley, 0.57 inches to Thousand Oaks 
and 0.23 inches to downtown Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Saticoy, with 0.61 inches, received the most rain in this week's storm, 
according to Flood Control District gauges. 
</P>
<P>
The measurements represent the county's first and only rainfall thus far in the 
season that began Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, normal readings to date are 1.64 inches in Camarillo, 1.69 inches 
at the County Government Center, 2.33 inches in Fillmore, 1.72 inches in 
Moorpark, 2.18 inches in Ojai, 1.48 inches in Oxnard, 2.05 inches in Santa 
Paula, 1.56 inches in Simi Valley, 1.68 inches in Thousand Oaks and 1.51 inches 
in downtown Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Rain-caused mudslides that closed the northbound lanes of Pacific Coast Highway 
near Deer Creek Road were cleared by 10 a.m. Tuesday, said Bruce Dyar, Ventura 
County regional manager for Caltrans. He said northbound traffic was 
temporarily detoured over the highway's single southbound lane. 
</P>
<P>
California 33 north of Ojai was closed briefly Tuesday morning due to a 
rain-induced rock slide, Dyar said. 
</P>
<P>
Police and sheriff's deputies said the rain caused no major accidents. JACK

<P>
CITY COUNCIL TABLES PIERSIDE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of the overwhelming passage of a parks and beaches protection 
initiative, the City Council has decided to table the controversial Pierside 
Village project. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga told the council this week that the 
passage of Measure C will force a citywide referendum on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Included in Pierside Village are at least two restaurants on paved land 
abutting the beach, immediately south of the municipal pier. 
</P>
<P>
Measure C, passed by a 73% margin on Nov. 6, prohibits the city from selling or 
leasing park or beach land without both a majority vote of the City Council and 
the city's voters. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of Pierside Village have said it would ruin the city's ocean view and 
would hamper public access to the beach. Supporters say the land in question -- 
now a paved parking lot -- would be beautified and the public would have easier 
access to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Chodos, representing Pierside Village's proposed developer, told the 
council he does not think Measure C applies to the project. 
</P>
<P>
But Uberuaga disagreed. "This project is affected (by Measure C). We do have a 
memo from the city attorney's office indicating how this project is affected," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed with Uberuaga's recommendation and unanimously voted to 
defer action on Pierside Village pending the completion of a new master plan 
for downtown redevelopment. BILL BILLITER

$50,000 REWARD IN MURDER CASE EXCITES, BAFFLES INVESTIGATORS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: GOVERNOR OKS THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT IN THE LITTLE PUBLICIZED DEATH OF A 
14-YEAR-OLD LANCASTER GIRL FOUND IN THE DESERT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sgts. Frank Salerno and Jackie Franco of the sheriff's homicide bureau, whose 
work is a daily lesson in the different values people place on human life, got 
good news Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In response to their request, Gov. George Deukmejian offered a $50,000 reward 
for information in the case of Angela Migliore, a 14-year-old Lancaster girl 
found strangled in the desert last month. 
</P>
<P>
But why Deukmejian offered such a large reward in such a comparatively 
little-known case remained unclear. Other than the formal proclamation terming 
the crime "a senseless murder," his office offered no explanation. 
</P>
<P>
The Migliore case, which Salerno and Franco have pursued doggedly with little 
progress, accounts for the 10th such reward that the governor has offered since 
he signed a law in May, 1989, increasing state rewards from a maximum of 
$10,000 to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
The case has received less widespread attention than previous crimes regarded 
as worthy of the maximum reward, including the Glendale and Santa Barbara arson 
fires, the rape-murder of a Wilmington woman abducted from a drive-in, and the 
drive-by shooting death in South Los Angeles of a sheriff's Explorer Scout. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block requested Deukmejian to offer the 
reward, at the prompting of the two detectives.

The governor offers two or three rewards a year based on requests from law 
enforcement agencies, spokeswoman Susan Trowbridge said. But she would not say 
how many requests are received or what criteria are used to select from among 
hundreds of violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The governor makes little comment on the cases he chooses, she said. "The 
reward speaks for itself." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials could not come up with a figure on the number of cases in 
which Block has sought rewards from the state this year. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Migliore reward totals $60,000, with $5,000 offers each from the city 
of Lancaster and Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Gary Vance of the Antelope Valley sheriff's station tried to put into 
words what makes the Migliore case special. He said homicide investigators 
don't see a lot of killings like hers -- no drugs, no gangs, no leads and a 
dead child. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose it's one of those cases where you've got a totally innocent victim, 
the kind that shocks the conscience," he said.

<P>
SUICIDE: HE SEEKS TO HAVE DISC JOCKEY INTERCEDE WITH HIS WIFE. POLICE ARE

A Baldwin Park man, apparently distraught over marital problems, killed himself 
after he called a country radio station and threatened suicide if a disc jockey 
did not talk to his wife, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin Park police said the 63-year-old man shot himself in his living room 
Monday after allegedly pointing a gun at a police officer who then fired a shot 
at the house. Police had been alerted by the radio station and were attempting 
to persuade the man to drop his .38-caliber revolver. 
</P>
<P>
The man's name was not released because police had not been able to find his 
wife or other family members. 
</P>
<P>
The man had called station KZLA on Monday afternoon and told a receptionist 
that he was having problems communicating with his wife, station officials 
said. He then threatened to shoot himself if Ken Cooper, the morning disc 
jockey, did not talk to her. Cooper was not on the air or at the station at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
KZLA's public affairs director, Renee Thomas, said the man's phone number was 
immediately given to police and a suicide hot line. 
</P>
<P>
"How terribly sad this is," Thomas said. "When you hear about people doing this 
sort of thing, most often they don't follow through. We are really sorry this 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
With the help of the man's telephone number, Baldwin Park police found his 
house. When officers arrived, they saw him standing in a living room window 
with the gun pointed to his head. 
</P>
<P>
"They tried to establish verbal communication with him, to get him to put the 
gun down," Lt. Mike Bennett said. "But that wasn't very successful. He appeared 
agitated, waving his free arm and saying something that wasn't audible to the 
officers." 
</P>
<P>
After several minutes, the man allegedly pointed the gun at one of the 
officers, who had taken cover about 30 feet away. Fearing for his own safety, 
the officer fired a shot at the front door, Bennett said. A few seconds later, 
a shot was heard from inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
Unsure whether the man had a hostage, officers evacuated 70 to 100 people from 
the surrounding houses and took them to the auditorium of nearby Pleasant View 
School. Children there were kept in class an extra hour. A SWAT team was put on 
standby. 
</P>
<P>
When police officers peered through a window, they saw the man lying on the 
floor. The angle of his gunshot wound to the head indicated that it was 
self-inflicted and not from the officer's bullet, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the man was a former machinist for a boat factory, but had hurt 
his back several months ago and was receiving disability benefits.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: FALLBROOK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An Alpine woman was killed and her husband injured when their pickup truck was 
rammed by a speeding hit-and-run driver in Fallbrook. Audry June Hall, 60, died 
at Palomar Medical Center about 5:25 p.m. Monday, a CHP spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Sherrel Hall, 60, was in fair condition Tuesday at Scripps 
Memorial Hospital in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 3:10 p.m. Monday when the driver of a car sped 
across all four lanes of traffic at about 100 m.p.h. on southbound Interstate 
15, south of Mission Road, and struck the Halls' pickup, knocking it over an 
embankment, the CHP spokesman said. The disabled car was found about half a 
mile away. The driver had fled on foot.

EX-DUFFY AIDE OFF THE HOOK FOR LEGAL FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court jury has determined that a sheriff's lieutenant was not 
personally responsible for $36,000 worth of legal fees the American Civil 
Liberties Union won in a 1986 lawsuit against Sheriff John Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. John Tenwolde, who worked as Duffy's public affairs spokesman at the time 
of the lawsuit, co-signed on a $36,000 loan with Duffy to pay the ACLU after 
the organization won a lawsuit that accused Duffy of misusing his office. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy had on-duty deputies distribute postcards as part of a campaign to remove 
former Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird from the state Supreme Court. A 
Superior Court judge ruled in 1986 that Duffy engaged in illegal political 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy was ordered to pay the ACLU's attorney fees and forwarded the bill to the 
county. County attorneys refused, saying that taxpayers are not liable for the 
costs because Duffy's conduct was outside the scope of his official duties. 
</P>
<P>
Tenwolde co-signed on the loan because he played a major role in distributing 
the anti-Bird cards, but he sued the county to recoup the money. The loan to 
Duffy and Tenwolde was made by William Cowling II, Charles Cono and the late 
Arthur Bloom -- all of whom were members of the San Diego County Honorary 
Deputy Sheriff's Assn. Duffy failed to report the loan on his statement of 
economic interest, as required by state law. 
</P>
<P>
Tenwolde said he was gratified by the verdict. "The jury found I was 
essentially performing my duty," he said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego County Grand Jury praised the city school district Tuesday for 
recent efforts to eliminate the eyesore of Dana Junior High School on Point 
Loma. The school, shuttered since 1983 because of declining enrollment, has 
been heavily vandalized while the school board wrestled with what to do with 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
In September, trustees agreed to move forward with a plan to rehabilitate the 
13-acre site and consolidate there the offices of counselors, health workers 
and other administrators now spread throughout the city. The school's massive 
auditorium would be made available for community use, and its sprawling 
playground would be graded and seeded to provide new baseball fields for 
nearby, cramped Point Loma High School. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury, in a brief report Tuesday, said the district should move ahead 
as quickly as possible with the estimated $6-million renovation, which has the 
backing of a large segment of the Point Loma community.

One of the two men charged in the only local case in which blacks have been 
charged with violating the civil rights of whites had his bail cut Tuesday from 
$10,000 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Maxey, 25, received the reduction in bail from Superior Court Judge 
Jesus Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Luis Aragon said Maxey's wife appeared in court with the 
couple's small child, and this family support may have had some influence on 
the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Maxey is charged, along with Donnie Lee Alexander, 19, in a string of attacks 
Sept. 23 near Belmont Park in Mission Beach. Maxey and Alexander face felony 
charges of robbery and assault with a deadly weapon, as well as four 
misdemeanor counts of battery and four misdemeanor charges of civil rights 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
The pair is scheduled to go on trial Dec. 21.

<P>
Late last summer, Abdul Majeed Al-Shatti, the editor of a Kuwaiti university 
science magazine, was visiting in the United States and awaiting word from his 
sister, who was about to deliver her first child. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Shatti has heard nothing from his sister or his parents since, he said. He 
has learned, though, that two cousins and two friends have been executed. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, Kuwait is being raped and dismantled, and its population is being 
replaced," Al-Shatti told an audience of several hundred students and faculty 
members at Chapman College Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Shatti, speaking at a forum entitled "On the Brink of War: U.S. Policy 
Toward the Middle East," was on a five-member panel offering a wide range of 
views on the Middle East. The panel included U.S. Rep. Robert K. Dornan 
(R-Garden Grove) and a Saudi Arabian social scientist who supports Iraq's 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Shatti, slight, bespectacled and soft-spoken, talked of atrocities that he 
said have been committed by the Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has one of the worst human rights records in the world," he declared. 
"Execution is the norm when it comes to dealing with their military or 
political opponents regardless of sex or age." 
</P>
<P>
Offering a sharply contrasting view, Yousif Al-Yousif, a Saudi Arabian whose 
analysis of the Persian Gulf crisis recently appeared in a Baghdad University 
journal, defended Iraq's actions. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Yousif charged that Kuwait had waged "economic war" against Iraq by 
overproducing oil and undercutting its price on the world market. Al-Yousif 
also claimed that many Kuwaitis had long wanted their country to become part of 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan dismissed the suggestion that Kuwaiti citizens supported the takeover, 
saying the country "was swallowed whole in a matter of hours." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan said he was "mystified" by the American public's ambivalence over the 
U.S.'s escalating commitment of troops to the Middle East. Dornan said that if 
unchecked, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would have upset the world economic 
order. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifty percent of the world's oil could have been in the hands of Iraq if 
Saddam had pressed on," Dornan said. "This would have turned the world upside 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan said the economic blockade against Iraq is proving successful and 
reiterated his support of President Bush's decision earlier this month to 
double the number of U.S. troops in the Middle East.

RAIN DROPS RESPECTABLE READINGS; 
</P>
<P>
WEATHER: SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTY REPORTED HALF AN INCH, BUT THE WEATHERMAN 
FORECASTS A BALMY AND SUNNY THANKSGIVING.

<P>
A fast-moving storm that dumped more than half an inch of rain in parts of 
Orange County could be just a memory for most residents by the time they sit 
down to turkey dinner on a Thanksgiving Day that is guaranteed to be blessed by 
balmy breezes and sunny skies. 
</P>
<P>
"Things do look to be improving for those of us who don't like rain," Marty 
McKewon, a meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The 
Times, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like we're heading right back to warm weather," McKewon said. "In 
fact, things are going to look pretty decent." 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, temperatures that have been lingering in the mid-60s should rise 
to the middle or upper 70s over the holiday weekend, McKewon said. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures on Friday should be reminiscent of last week's heat wave, with the 
mercury in some areas in Southern California expected to shoot up into the 80s 
as a high-pressure system moves into the Central Valley, McKewon said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have a quick warm-up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That is good news for the California Highway Patrol, which reported that Monday 
night's storm was to blame for more than 70 traffic accidents on Orange 
County's freeway system. 
</P>
<P>
The accidents, mostly fender benders caused by motorists unaccustomed to 
driving on slippery roads, occurred during a 12-hour period that ended at 6 a.m 
Tuesday, CHP spokeswoman Linda Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
The accidents ranged from cars slipping over the side of the wet freeways to 
chain-reaction crashes caused by drivers unable to stop in time. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, there were no major injuries reported, Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
Highways were made perilous on the first day of rain in months because water 
loosened and mixed with caked-on oil and grease, which floated on top of the 
roadways and caused cars to hydroplane, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Cars were just going too fast and they lost control," Burrus said. "As soon as 
the officers were cleared from one accident, they were sent to another scene." 
</P>
<P>
County Environmental Management Agency officials said the storm produced the 
first measurable rainfall since June. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago Peak, part of Saddleback Mountain, got the most, measuring 1.1 inches 
of rainfall, while San Juan Capistrano and El Toro each recorded .71 of an 
inch, EMA spokesman Shailesh Batel reported. 
</P>
<P>
Some parts of central and north Orange County had far less rainfall, he said. 
Santa Ana had .16 of an inch, Anaheim and Fullerton both had .28 of an inch, 
Brea had .24 and Cypress had only a trace, at .08 inches. 
</P>
<P>
In the coastal areas, rainfall varied widely, with Huntington Beach registering 
only .16 of an inch, while Newport and Laguna both had more than half an inch, 
Batel said.

RAINSTORM BRINGS FLURRY OF ACCIDENTS ON FREEWAYS

<P>
A powerful storm that brought the first significant rainfall of the season also 
contributed to a flurry of accidents on freeways in northern Los Angeles 
County, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of fatalities in any of the incidents, but foul weather 
and speeding drivers kept officers busy late Monday and early Tuesday. "We had 
12 to 15 fender-benders and about a dozen people" were taken to hospitals, said 
Sgt. Robert Callahan of the CHP's Newhall office. 
</P>
<P>
At least four major accidents occurred on the southbound Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
About 1 a.m. Tuesday, a trailer came loose from a semitrailer truck north of 
the Foothill Freeway and an auto slid beneath the trailer, seriously injuring 
the car's driver, Uehara Minoru, 46, of Los Angeles. He was taken to Holy Cross 
Medical Center, where he was in serious condition, hospital spokeswoman Reenie 
Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
About 11 p.m. Monday, a motorist speeding south on the Golden State Freeway 
near McBean Parkway lost control and struck the center divider and a second 
vehicle, the CHP said, blocking two southbound lanes of the freeway for two 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the first car was identified as Tristan Emil Gunnett, 20, of 
Redwood City. The driver of the second car was identified as Anh Quang Hoang, 
43, of San Francisco. Gunnett, Hoang and Hoang's passenger were treated and 
released from Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 1 a.m. Tuesday, a small speeding car "spun out of control and hit 
a dual-wheel pickup truck carrying persimmons," spilling the fruit onto the 
highway south of Calgrove Boulevard, Callahan said. There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 10 p.m. Monday, four semitrailer trucks were involved in two 
accidents in the truck lanes of the Golden State Freeway near the Antelope 
Valley Freeway, closing the lanes for more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Two trucks collided and when a third stopped to avoid the wreckage, it was hit 
by a fourth truck. There were no serious injuries, the CHP said.

'GOOD NEIGHBORS' OFFER HELP AND FAVORS TO VICTIMIZED FAMILY

Offers of help were extended Tuesday to a black family whose home was 
vandalized in what authorities say was a racially motivated attack. 
</P>
<P>
A furniture dealer who specializes in restorations offered to restore the De 
Silva family's dining room table after reading about how vandals caused an 
estimated $80,000 worth of damage to their home. 
</P>
<P>
One resident offered the family tickets to see the Los Angeles Lakers play. 
Others expressed outrage at the ransacking and sympathy for the family. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, vandals spray-painted racial slurs throughout the De Silva family's 
$370,000 home. Before leaving, the vandals stopped up sinks and turned on 
faucets, flooding two stories. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible trauma, but maybe it becomes less so if you know there's 
someone out there who you don't even know who cares about you," said Susan 
Morris, an executive with an equipment leasing company in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Morris, who talked with Delano De Silva, the owner of the house, by phone 
Tuesday, said the family does not appear to be in financial need. Still, Morris 
said she hopes that he will take her up on her offer for tickets to a Los 
Angeles Lakers game. Her family-run business holds three season tickets at the 
Forum in Inglewood, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents expressed sadness and outrage that hate crimes exist in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"It just makes me sick," said Vaughn Nybakken, 40, a San Clemente resident who 
works in computer sales in Irvine. "Not in California, where we've got people 
from all over the world. Gosh, this is absolutely outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Rasner, a 50-year-old father of five in Laguna Niguel, echoed similar 
sentiments. Rasner, the owner of Elijah Socum, a furniture store that 
specializes in restorations, has offered to restore the De Silvas' oak dining 
table. Rasner said he, his wife and an out-of-town guest read of the vandalism 
at the breakfast table Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a visitor who said, 'Gosh, we see a lot of this thing in Cleveland. I 
can't believe it happens in Southern California,' " Rasner said. "I guess I 
felt I just had a responsibility to get this thing fixed . . . to pick up the 
phone and tell him there are good neighbors out there."

MIKE DOWNEY: NO DEFENSE FOR THE WAY NUGGETS HAVE BEEN PLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
America's Funniest Home and Away Basketball Team, the Denver Nuggets, will soon 
be appearing at a gymnasium near you! 
</P>
<P>
They're fast! They're funny! They're the Rocky Mountain Globetrotters! These 
crazy Colorado cagers are a laugh-a-minute, point-a-second riot, so don't miss 
one hilarious trip down the court! One of them could end up on your lap! So 
order your tickets today, before Denver is laughed right out of the league! 
</P>
<P>
Hey, you thought the Nuggets were a scream when they played for Doug Moe? Just 
wait until you get a load of these guys under nutty professor Paul Westhead. 
They play basketball the way Jerry Lewis plays Shakespeare. Daffy Duck is more 
subtle. This team is so funny, every radio broadcast should end with: 
"Th-th-that's all, folks!" 
</P>
<P>
They're the enver Nuggets. Westhead took away the D. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a team that never gets penalized for illegal zone defense . . . because 
the Nuggets don't even play legal defense. They should use three balls, like a 
juggler. We knew this team had new owners; we just had no idea they were Barnum 
and Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
These people have become more entertainers than basketball players. They should 
call their leading scorer Meadowlark Woolridge. One of these days, a television 
camera is going to catch Westhead diagramming a play on the sideline, and it'll 
be that one where somebody hides the basketball underneath his jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Denver's idea of stopping the other team from scoring is to call a timeout. 
Westhead is one of the few coaches alive who believes the best defense is a 
good offense. The Nuggets don't run plays, they run wind sprints. About the 
only call a referee can make on the Nuggets is 3/10ths of a second in the lane. 
</P>
<P>
Don't you just love these guys? The way they hop around all over the place? 
Watching a Denver game is like watching dogs chase Frisbees. The Nuggets 
shouldn't play in a gym. They should play in a Jungle Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Do you know how Denver players call a play? They hold up one hand and say: 
"Here I am! Here I am!" 
</P>
<P>
Drop back on defense? Tennis players change sides more often than Denver 
Nuggets do. They are Bobby Knight's worst nightmare come true. Westhead 
believes basketballs were made to be shot into baskets. If James Naismith 
wanted it to be passed, he would have played with a medicine ball. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead has one prerequisite for shooting the ball: A player should remember 
to report into the game. Otherwise, anything goes. The coach just hates it when 
guys shoot from the bench. Screws up the official scorer. 
</P>
<P>
During Monday's Laker-Nugget game, we checked in with McNichols Arena's regular 
official scorer, Ed Zupp, to ask if his job has been difficult. Ed told us: 
"Get away from me! I can't talk now! Damn! I missed that one! Who got that last 
basket? Davis? No, Dunn! OK, I got it! Oh damn, there's another one! Who got 
that one? Johnson? Which Johnson? Damn! Go away! I can't talk to you now!" 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Denver does use a zone defense sometimes. It's a new one: the 5-0-0. 
</P>
<P>
One team scored more than 100 points against the Nuggets this season -- in the 
first half. At halftime, the trainer rolled their tongues back into their 
heads, like carpets. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Clippers the other night, Seattle scored 65 points. Against Denver, 
the Clippers will try to hold the leading scorer to 65 points. 
</P>
<P>
Can't wait to catch tonight's Nugget-Laker rematch. Should be the funniest 
thing at a Forum since Zero Mostel. These guys won't keep Sam Perkins out of 
double figures. These guys couldn't keep Marlon Perkins out of double figures. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Westhead's strategy has laid a Denver omelet. Last we looked, the 
Nuggets were something like 1-9. Whichever team they defeated probably joined 
the Continental Basketball Assn. or the Foreign Legion or something. 
</P>
<P>
Losing to Denver is disgraceful these days. They are so much less than they 
were under Moe, they should be called the McNuggets. 
</P>
<P>
Funny, but when Westhead coached Magic Johnson, the player wanted to run, the 
coach didn't. Now, Johnson says he doubts he could run Westhead's current 
offense because he is too old to run so much. Only Paul Westhead could make 
Magic feel like Methuselah. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's final score, oddly enough, was Lakers 122, Nuggets 105. No, that 
wasn't a partial score. Yes, the Lakers did use five players. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead's blank-page playbook worked at Loyola Marymount. Who knows? Maybe his 
offense will work at Denver, although in our opinion the only thing that should 
be moving that fast at that altitude should have wings and a stewardess. 
</P>
<P>
We wish the Nuggets luck. Next year's playoffs should be the best ones they've 
ever watched.

ROCKNE HAD TO BE SOLD ON THE IDEA; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: A TROJAN GRADUATE MANAGER AND HIS WIFE PERSUADED COACH TO PLAY USC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gwynn Wilson has a unique place in the history of the USC-Notre Dame series, 
which started in 1926 and has developed into the greatest intersectional 
rivalry in college football. 
</P>
<P>
It was his idea. 
</P>
<P>
As USC's graduate manager, sort of a forerunner to a modern-day athletic 
director, Wilson proposed a home-and-home series between the schools to Notre 
Dame's legendary coach, Knute Rockne. 
</P>
<P>
Rockne agreed to play USC and a monster was created. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't that simple. Had it not been for the persuasiveness of Wilson's 
late wife, Marion, the series might never have come to pass. 
</P>
<P>
As Wilson, 93, recalled recently at his home in Rancho Palos Verdes, the idea 
came to him on the Monday before Thanksgiving in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was acquainted with Rockne, who only a year earlier had conducted a 
two-week coaching clinic at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, we were looking for a new coach (after the 1924 season) 
and he agreed to come out to coach at USC on condition that he would be 
released from Notre Dame," Wilson said. "Well, of course, he wasn't released 
and it didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
"But, as it turned out, it was better for us that he didn't come. If we had 
signed him, we'd have lost our rival." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's thoughts were of Rockne as he drove to work on that Monday morning 65 
years ago. Wilson had recently received word that Notre Dame planned to drop 
Nebraska from its schedule after the final game between the schools on 
Thanksgiving Day, 1925, in Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
It occurred to Wilson that maybe USC could replace Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, no team had crossed the Rocky Mountains to play an eastern 
team," Wilson said. "They'd only come west for the Rose Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson suggested to USC officials that he board the next train to Lincoln to 
meet with Rockne and propose a series. 
</P>
<P>
A university vice president, Harold Stonier, said to Wilson: "The first time a 
western team plays in the East, it's going to be one of the biggest games ever 
played." 
</P>
<P>
Stonier approved Wilson's trip, but was reluctant to grant Wilson's request 
that he take along his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd only been married about a year and wanted to take her along," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
So Stonier phoned another vice president, Warren Bovard, who approved of 
Marion's making the trip. Wilson called his wife and asked her to meet him at 
noon at Santa Fe Station. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Bovard's decision was a critical one. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilsons pulled into Lincoln the night before the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The town was just humming -- 'Beat Notre Dame! Beat Notre Dame!' " Gwynn said. 
"You could see why they were going to discontinue this thing because it was 
just wild -- to the point where the game had taken over the town." 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of the game, in the lobby of the Lincoln Hotel, Wilson ran into 
a startled Rockne, who asked him: "What the hell are you doing here?" 
</P>
<P>
Wilson made his pitch, but Rockne told him he was too busy to talk. He told 
Wilson that the Irish would leave Lincoln on a midnight train for Chicago after 
the game, and suggested that Wilson and his wife book reservations. They would 
talk, he said, during the 17-hour trip. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the next afternoon, though, after Notre Dame had suffered a 
17-0 setback, that Wilson could get Rockne alone. After a stream of visitors 
had continually disrupted their discussions, the two men retreated to an 
observation car. 
</P>
<P>
Rockne regaled Wilson with stories of Irish football. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had such an afternoon in my life," Wilson said. "It was just a 
wonderful afternoon. He was a wonderful guy." 
</P>
<P>
But when talk turned to a USC-Notre Dame series, Rockne said that he wasn't 
interested. Los Angeles, he said, was too far from South Bend, Ind. The players 
would have to be out of school for too many days. The trip would be too 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
The press, Rockne said, had started chiding his teams, calling them "The 
Ramblers" because they traveled so much, and he didn't like it. He told Wilson 
that he was more interested in playing games against teams from the Western 
Conference, which later changed its name to the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
"We shook hands and he was very final about it," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
But when Wilson returned to his seat and told his wife the disappointing news, 
she was surprised. She had spent the afternoon with Rockne's wife, Bonnie, 
telling her that California was magnificent. 
</P>
<P>
She told Bonnie how well the Trojans treated their visitors, getting them great 
rates at the Huntington Hotel or the Beverly Hills Hotel, which were among the 
nation's best. She told her that when the teams departed, they were given 
baskets of fruit for their trip home. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Rockne wants the game," Marion told her husband. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 minutes later, Wilson said, Rockne showed up at the Wilson's 
compartment and tapped on the door. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we're about 15 minutes outside of Chicago," Wilson said. "He sat down 
across from me. He had a silly, embarrassed grin on his face, but he had a 
gleam in his eye and he said to me: 'Gwynn, what was this you were saying about 
scheduling some football games?' " 
</P>
<P>
A series was born. 
</P>
<P>
The first game, played on Dec. 4, 1926, drew a crowd of 74,378 to the Coliseum, 
which at the time was capacity. Notre Dame won, 13-12. The second, played on 
Nov. 26, 1927, drew a crowd of 120,000 to Chicago's Soldier Field. The Irish 
prevailed again, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Ten times in the series, one team or the other has entered the game ranked No. 
1 in the Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
"But if it hadn't been for those two women talking in a train on an autumn 
afternoon in 1925, this great series never would have been played," Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson spent nine years at USC, where the student union is named for him, 
before taking a job as associate general manager of the 1932 Olympics. He 
retired in 1960 from Santa Anita, where he served as general manager of the 
race track, and has lived since 1987 in a retirement home in Rancho Palos 
Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Marion died in January and, because he has a hard time getting around these 
days, Gwynn no longer attends USC games, but he still follows the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
He takes great pride in the USC-Notre Dame series, which he described as 
probably the premier competition in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a very constructive thing for the university all these years," he 
said. "In fact, we're probably as well known nationally as any other school in 
the nation because of that series." 
</P>
<P>
For that, USC can thank Gwynn and Marion Wilson.

MIKE PENNER: RAMS COULD BOTCH ROBINSON'S FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On the first of September, the goal was the Super Bowl, but the Rams couldn't 
get interested. 
</P>
<P>
On the first of October, the goal was to regroup and at least make the 49ers 
breathe heavily, but the Rams couldn't get interested. 
</P>
<P>
On the first of November, the goal was to salvage the season by out-worming the 
rest of the NFC slugs to the third and final wild-card berth, but the Rams 
couldn't get interested. 
</P>
<P>
Today, on the eve of Thanksgiving, the Rams are 3-7 with nothing to play for 
except the continued employment of their coach, John Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Now, things could get interesting. 
</P>
<P>
It was only a matter of time and losses before the job-security question caught 
up with Robinson. Given enough of both, it catches up with everyone, Tom Landry 
included. 
</P>
<P>
Just 10 months ago, Robinson stood on the sideline at Giants Stadium, flushed 
by an overtime playoff triumph and hugged by a jubilant Georgia Frontiere, who 
bubbled over the top and declared, "You're the greatest coach in the world!" At 
that moment, Robinson appeared invincible -- San Francisco's 30-3 victory was 
still a week down the road -- and throughout the off-season months that 
followed, he seemed more untouchable than any Ram not wearing jersey No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the Rams began losing games they were supposed to win -- at Green Bay 
against Anthony Dilweg, at home against 0-2 Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the Rams began getting embarrassed -- 28-9 at Chicago, 41-10 at 
Pittsburgh, 31-7 against the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, they lost at home to Dallas. Dallas did it. For the Rams, this was 
more than a must-win game. It was a better-not-show-your-face-if-you-lose game. 
Last season, the Cowboys were 1-15. This season, they're 4-7 -- a half-game up 
on the Rams in the If-Only-There-Were-a-Fourth NFC Wild Card standings. 
</P>
<P>
Look around. You won't find a more disappointing team in professional football 
than the Rams -- and that includes some heady competition. In 1989, Denver and 
Cleveland played for the AFC championship. Today they're playing out the 
string, buried at 3-7 and 2-8, respectively. (That was some Final Four last 
year; throw in the Rams and three-fourths of the NFL's semifinal field are now 
a combined 8-22.) But Cleveland, by consensus acclaim, did it with mirrors in 
'89 and Denver, if there's a God, shouldn't be allowed near another Super Bowl 
until the next millennium. 
</P>
<P>
Crisis conditions also have been spotted in Minnesota, where the Vikings 
started 1-6, and in Philadelphia, where the fifth year of Buddy Ryan's plan 
started 2-4. But both teams have rallied -- Minnesota has won three straight to 
hang onto the fringe of wild-card contention with the Eagles, who have won four 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, there has been no Renaissance, no recovery, only regression. So 
when the jump ball is tossed up -- Is Robinson safe? -- the answer that returns 
is no longer the unthinkable one: Maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that this is prime finger-pointing time and general manager John 
Shaw, architect of the Rams' much-assailed no-frills financial approach, is the 
one offering the non-vote of confidence. Frontiere, who has the final say in 
the matter, hasn't yet spoken. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has made mistakes. Early on, he placed far too much confidence in the 
pass-rushing abilities of Bill Hawkins and Brian Smith, who have yet to prove 
they can sack a lunch. His decision to tinker with Kevin Greene -- moving him 
from side to side instead of leaving him alone on the left end -- disrupted the 
lone strength of the Ram defense. And the Curt Warner experiment never should 
have made it to the laboratory door. 
</P>
<P>
But these crimes are misdemeanors, certainly no more significant to the Ram 
collapse than: 
</P>
<P>
Jim Everett's annual midseason slump. Yes, it's back, as big as ever. In the 
Rams' past four games, Everett has passed for less than 200 yards three times, 
has passed for only one touchdown, has had six passes intercepted, has been 
sacked eight times and has not completed a pass of more than 30 yards. Compare 
that to Everett's six-game numbers -- three 300 yard-plus games, 14 touchdown 
passes, five completions of 40 yards or more -- and you'll see what happened to 
the Rams' quick-strike capability. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland Gary's on-the-job training. When Robinson crapped out with Warner, 
the burden of the Ram rushing game fell to Gary, a virtual rookie who sat out 
the exhibition season with a bad back. Gary has the moves, the quickness and 
the resiliency to be a consistent 1,000-yard gainer, but his inexperience still 
shows, sometimes at the worst times. As in second-and-goal from the Dallas 
five, fourth quarter, game tied at 21-21. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Ellard's hamstring. You appreciate Crazier Legs more when he's gone, as 
in most of the past two games. Replacement Aaron Cox doesn't run the routes 
Ellard does, drops the passes Ellard catches and gets called for motion when 
Everett completes a 79-yard touchdown strike to Flipper Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
The list goes on and on: Mike Lansford's post-injury inefficiency. Jerry Gray's 
post-injury inefficiency. Jerry Gray's comrades in a defenseless defensive 
backfield. Randy Cross' too-accurate assessment of the Rams' defensive linemen 
-- "not one of them could start for another team in the division." 
</P>
<P>
No one ever said the relationship between a coach and his team was a marriage. 
Neither side is bound to the other through better or worse. But it pays to 
remember where the Rams were when Robinson arrived on the scene -- league 
laughing stocks after back-to-back finishes of 6-10 and 2-7. 
</P>
<P>
Within one year, Robinson had the Rams in the playoffs. Since then, he has 
brought them back five times. Robinson has been flexible enough to win with the 
whole gamut of team personalities: running teams, passing teams, teams that 
could play defense, teams that couldn't. Management ought to be flexible enough 
to grant him one misfire. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, this might be one time legendary Ram stinginess works to Robinson's 
favor. The coach's contract runs through the end of the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
Ram taste buds have never much cared for the act of eating contracts.

A'S HENDERSON VOTED AL MOST VALUABLE PLAYER;

BASEBALL: HE GETS 14 OF 28 FIRST-PLACE VOTES. FIELDER IS SECOND IN BALLOTING.

<TEXT>
<P>
Rickey Henderson's array of talents -- speed, power, batting and defense -- 
outshined the sheer slugging of Detroit's Cecil Fielder to win the American 
League most valuable player award Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics' Henderson, one of the best leadoff men in baseball history, 
capped the finest overall season of his 11-year career with 14 of the 28 
first-place votes in balloting by the Baseball Writers Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
"Rickey's the best leadoff man I've ever seen," said Hall of Famer Willie Mays. 
". . . Rickey has everything it takes, the hitting and running and fielding. 
I've never seen a leadoff man who can do all the things he does so well." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson would get more recognition and probably drive in 100 runs a year if 
he were batting third, Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
"But the A's need him to control the game, and that's what he does," Mays said. 
"He controls the game with his speed and with his bat and he plays. He's the 
complete ballplayer." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson's 317 points put him narrowly ahead of Fielder, who led the majors 
with 51 homers and drove in 132 runs. Fielder drew 10 first-place votes and 286 
points in the voting by two writers in each AL city. 
</P>
<P>
Boston pitcher Roger Clemens, runner-up to Oakland's Bob Welch for the Cy Young 
award, finished third in the MVP voting with three first-place votes and 212 
points. Oakland's Dennis Eckersley, who finished sixth in the MVP voting behind 
Toronto's Kelly Gruber and Chicago's Bobby Thigpen, got the other first-place 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson and Fielder were the only players named on all 28 ballots. 
</P>
<P>
The award brought a $100,000 contract bonus to Henderson, who signed a 
$12-million, four-year deal a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
More than the slugging of Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire, Henderson made the 
Athletics go this year. If he didn't open the scoring with a homer or "Rickey 
run" -- a walk or single followed by two stolen bases and a sacrifice fly -- he 
frequently started rallies or made the big plays in left field. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland won 26 of the 33 games in which Henderson scored in the first inning. 
Five of his career-high 28 homers were leadoff shots, extending his major 
league record to 45 leadoff homers. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, 31, led the American League in stolen bases for the 10th time, 
finishing with 65 to give him a career total of 936 -- two shy of Lou Brock's 
major league record. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson also led the majors in runs scored (119) and on-base percentage 
(.439). He finished second in batting with a .325 average, just behind George 
Brett's .329, and in slugging with a personal record .577, just behind Fielder. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy doesn't play one game, even in spring training, when the other team 
isn't saying, 'Let's get him out, and if he gets on base, stop him,' " Oakland 
Manager Tony La Russa said.

The recognition Rickey Henderson has craved since childhood finally came his 
way Tuesday when he won the American League's most valuable player award. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Athletic outfielder's dazzling array of speed, power, batting and 
defense outshined the sheer slugging of Detroit's Cecil Fielder in balloting by 
the Baseball Writers Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to tip my hat to Cecil Fielder," Henderson said. "He had an outstanding 
year and he deserved to win this award, too. But I think because of all the 
things I did for my team I was able to edge him." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson capped the finest overall season of his 11-year career by gaining 14 
of the 28 first-place votes. Henderson's total of 317 points put him narrowly 
ahead of Fielder, who led the majors with 51 homers and drove in 132 runs. 
Fielder drew 10 first-place votes and 286 points in the voting by two writers 
in each AL city. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said he hasn't been so excited since he broke Lou Brock's stolen base 
record of 118 by stealing 130 bases in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"My next big moment is going to be when I break Brock's all-time stolen-base 
record," said Henderson, who needs three more to surpass Brock's career total 
of 938. "If I can play eight or nine more years, I'll put it out of reach -- 
1,200 to 1,500 is what I'll shoot for." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hall of Famer Willie Mays, whose No. 24 is worn by Henderson and NL MVP 
Barry Bonds of Pittsburgh: "Rickey's the best leadoff man I've ever seen. 
They're both my kids, both great players. Barry's my godson and a wonderful 
young player. Rickey has everything it takes, the hitting and running and 
fielding. I've never seen a leadoff man who can do all the things he does so 
well." 
</P>
<P>
More than the slugging of Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire, it was Henderson who 
made the Athletics go this year. If he didn't open the scoring with a homer or 
a "Rickey run" -- a walk or single followed by two stolen bases and a sacrifice 
fly -- he frequently started rallies that brought the A's back or made the big 
plays in left field. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland won 26 of the 33 games in which Henderson scored in the first inning. 
Five of his career-high 28 homers were leadoff shots, extending his major 
league record to 45 leadoff homers. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, still running and taking the bumps at age 31, led the American 
League in stolen bases for the 10th time, finishing with 65. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson also led the majors in runs scored (119) and on-base percentage 
(.439). He finished second in batting with a .325 average, behind George 
Brett's .329, and in slugging with a career-high .577 mark, just behind 
Fielder. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder was disappointed at not winning."It would have been nice. But I know my 
teammates appreciate me." 
</P>
<P>
Boston pitcher Roger Clemens finished third with three first-place votes and 
212 points. Oakland's Dennis Eckersley, who finished sixth in the MVP voting 
behind Toronto's Kelly Gruber and Chicago's Bobby Thigpen, got the other 
first-place vote.

MELVIN DURSLAG: BIRD IN THE HAND IS GOOD BET AT THE TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During Thanksgiving Week at old Suffolk Downs, Bill Veeck, then proprietor, 
used to turn loose flocks of live turkeys, inviting clients to run them down 
and take them home. 
</P>
<P>
Bill wouldn't release his turkeys until after the last race because of problems 
that might have developed with earlier dispersal. 
</P>
<P>
What would a guy do with his bird if he wanted to go to the window? 
</P>
<P>
Would he ask his neighbor: "Will you please watch my turkey while I make a 
bet?" 
</P>
<P>
Studying the logistic problems of live turkeys up for grabs, Hollywood Park 
each Thanksgiving approaches the matter in a way that is tidier. 
</P>
<P>
It offers everyone coming through the gate a free Thanksgiving dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Now, you ask clinically, what variety of individual wants to spend Thanksgiving 
at a race track? And you discover there are two varieties. 
</P>
<P>
One is that person of culture seeking a dimension on Thanksgiving broader than 
a turkey dinner. Man doesn't live by stuffing alone. 
</P>
<P>
But you give him nine races, a daily double, exacta, trifecta and pick six, and 
his intellect is awakened. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is that traditionalist with a commitment to American history. It is 
a well-known fact that the pilgrims left the old world to escape persecution 
for going to the track on Thursdays. Landing on our shores in 1620, their 
leader looked at his watch. He announced: 
</P>
<P>
"There is still time to catch the first at Plymouth Downs." 
</P>
<P>
And, gathering at the clubhouse turn, they would kneel and offer thanks for the 
freedom they found in this new land. 
</P>
<P>
Thanksgiving days were then selected at random, usually linked to a good 
harvest or a victory over the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
It would remain for President Lincoln to proclaim officially the last Thursday 
in November as Thanksgiving Day. For this gesture, a savings and loan would be 
named in his memory. 
</P>
<P>
But Franklin D. Roosevelt later would suggest the third Thursday in November 
for Thanksgiving Day, pointing out that the earlier the holiday is celebrated, 
the better the chance for a fast track. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Canada celebrates a Thanksgiving Day on a Monday in October. 
</P>
<P>
Well, we have a talk with the catering manager of Hollywood Park, Bob Creelman, 
who informs us that 3,000 turkeys have been ordered for the purpose of feeding 
an estimated 18,000 horse players Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
That amounts to one turkey for every six players, indicating people going to 
the track are eating like a horse. Lost in deep and profound cerebrations, 
engulfed by scientific data, your average player normally eats like a bird. 
</P>
<P>
But then normally he is paying for it. 
</P>
<P>
When a horse dies at the track, it is rated a tragedy. But 3,000 turkeys bite 
the dust and no one blanches. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it even reported that the turkeys were humanely destroyed, as were the 
yams, mashed potatoes, cranberries, dressing and pumpkin pies. 
</P>
<P>
We ask a horse player: "Sir, why have you chosen to spend Thanksgiving at a 
race track?" 
</P>
<P>
He answers: "Choosing between my relatives and the horses, I make the horses 
1-5." 
</P>
<P>
Now we ask a horse: "Do you have objections to running on Thanksgiving Day?" 
</P>
<P>
"I lodged a beef," he replies. "I thought it would be nice to fly back to 
Lexington and be with my family. But racing people reminded me that guys play 
football on Thanksgiving Day. They also play hockey. And if they suffer no 
twinges spilling blood on a holiday, my running six furlongs is small time." 
</P>
<P>
The horse ponders this a moment, then adds: "How would you like to be dealing 
blackjack on Thanksgiving? A job is a job." 
</P>
<P>
When Hollywood Park serves 3,000 turkeys, as it aims to do, what happens to 
those parts that aren't put on the plate? Where, for instance, does one go to 
move 3,000 gizzards. 
</P>
<P>
And if socialites, movie celebrities and politicians work the serving line at a 
rescue mission on Thanksgiving, why would they ignore horse players, from whose 
ranks the mission population swells? 
</P>
<P>
Feeding 18,000 horse players, Hollywood Park is showing social sensitivity that 
has to be recognized.

WEST COAST CONFERENCE PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
RACE IS ON TO FILL VOID, AND THEY COULDN'T BE HAPPIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The players who dominated the West Coast Conference for so long, who put it on 
the basketball map and created a corps of late night TV faithful around the 
country, are gone. 
</P>
<P>
There are no players in the wings with the name recognition of Hank Gathers, Bo 
Kimble and Jeff Fryer at Loyola Marymount; Tom Lewis, Dexter Howard and Craig 
Davis at Pepperdine; Jeffty Connelly at Santa Clara or anyone named McPhee at 
Gonzaga. 
</P>
<P>
Simply put, "The league has lost its marquee players," Pepperdine Coach Tom 
Asbury said. 
</P>
<P>
But WCC coaches and officials aren't shedding many tears. Thanks to those 
players' accomplishments over the past few years, the WCC recently landed its 
first television game-of-the-week package with SportsChannel. 
</P>
<P>
And thanks to their departure, a tighter race is expected. Since the 1984-85 
season, only one conference winner -- St. Mary's in 1988-89 -- has lost as many 
as two games. Loyola Marymount went undefeated the year before and won the 
title with a 13-1 mark last season. 
</P>
<P>
This season, San Diego is seen as the slight favorite, in a poll of WCC sports 
publicists, over Loyola and Pepperdine, but the haves and have-nots are closer 
this season and the conference should be improved from a year ago, when half 
the league lost 19 or more games. 
</P>
<P>
"I think 10-4 could win the league," WCC Commissioner Michael Gilleran said. 
"I'll be surprised if anybody goes 11-3. I can even see two teams tying at 
10-4, and a few right behind at 9-5. I think San Diego, Loyola, Pepperdine, in 
any order, are a half-step ahead of the league, but the others, you could pick 
four through eight in any order. We're stronger top to bottom, and this year I 
don't think you can eliminate as many teams (from contention)." 
</P>
<P>
Here's how the league shapes up, minus Loyola and Pepperdine: 
</P>
<P>
U. SAN DIEGO 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 16-12 overall, 9-5 WCC. 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 finish: Third. 
</P>
<P>
As the only team in the league with seniors and juniors making up more than 50% 
of the roster, the Toreros have the most experienced squad, a coach in Hank 
Egan who has a proven track record with maturing teams, and several good 
recruits. 
</P>
<P>
Returners include Pat Holbert, a 46% three-point shooter, and Wayman Strickland 
at the guard spots and shot-blocking center Dondi Bell. Junior Kelvin Woods 
started 13 games last season and Anthony Thomas four. They will split time at 
one forward. 
</P>
<P>
To that list Egan has added swingman Michael Brown and 6-8 Reed Watson, both 
highly regarded transfers from Mesa Community College in Arizona and potential 
starters, and an assistant, Jack Avina, who was head coach at Portland for 17 
years. The Toreros believe this group is ready to contend for the next two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
SANTA CLARA 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 9-19, 6-8. 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 finish: Fifth. 
</P>
<P>
With the only veteran true center in the league in 7-foot-1 junior Ron Reis, 
the Broncos should be a factor. Carroll Williams, the dean of WCC coaches 
starting his 28th season, is coming off a rare losing season in which the 
Broncos had so many injuries, there were 10 different starting combinations 
just at guard. There's not a senior on the roster. Point guard Melvin Chinn and 
part-time starter LaCoby Phillips should provide a stable backcourt. Talented 
junior Rhea Taylor is a potential star at forward but has been injury prone. 
Though Williams is wary of freshmen, he may start forward Andy Karich, his 
prize recruit from Santa Ana Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of last season, Reis was getting more publicity for his hobbies of 
skateboarding and Go-Karting and his announced intention of becoming a 
professional wrestler than for his game. Now the talk is of a future in 
basketball as Reis led the conference in shooting and managed to haul his 
(announced) 285 pounds around fast enough for 30 points and 10 rebounds against 
Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
"If I (forecast a winner) today I'd pick Santa Clara. They've got the most 
dominating guy," Asbury said. 
</P>
<P>
U. SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 8-20, 4-10. 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 finish: Sixth (tie). 
</P>
<P>
The Dons could be one of several sleepers in the conference, thanks to Jim 
Brovelli's best recruiting class since USF reinstituted basketball. Only two 
key lettermen return -- forward James Bell and swingman Scott McWhorter -- but 
Brovelli figures his team will rebound better than last season's and has better 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
A resurgence may depend on 6-6 Darryl Johnson, who led the nation's junior 
colleges with 17 rebounds a game last season, and freshman point guard Orlando 
Smart, who will start. In their first exhibition against an Australian team, 
Johnson got 27 points and 25 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
PORTLAND 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 11-17, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 finish: Fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Last season's most improved team, the Pilots have three starters back and have 
added several big men. How ready is Coach Larry Steele? Over the summer he had 
corrective heart surgery on a Friday and was back to work Monday. 
</P>
<P>
To go with veterans Ron Deaton, Erik Spoelstra and freshman of the year Matt 
Houle, Steele added three center-forwards, among them 6-9 Australian Leigh 
Wadeson -- who was also recruited by Indiana -- and Nebraska player of the year 
Mike Mueller. Steele also hopes for some help from 7-5 senior Greg Ritter, a 
28-year-old redshirt who has played 17 minutes of organized ball. 
</P>
<P>
GONZAGA 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 8-20, 3-11. 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 finish: Eighth. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs will have a new look, and not just because there won't be a McPhee 
on the roster for the first time in a decade. Where the team has traditionally 
been plodding and methodical, Coach Dan Fitzgerald is injecting "quick" and 
"up-tempo" instead. 
</P>
<P>
Two starters are back, one of them point guard Jamie Dudley, whose main target 
will be 6-7 forward Eric Brady, a transfer from Washington who was voted team 
captain even though he redshirted last season. Fitzgerald hopes for more 
offense from three-point shooter Jarrod Davis and a rare inner-city recruit, 
guard Kenny Davis from Gardena Serra. 
</P>
<P>
ST. MARY'S 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 7-20, 4-10. 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 finish: Sixth (tie). 
</P>
<P>
The Gaels remain a mystery in Paul Landreaux's second go-round, because he 
cleaned house and stocked up on junior college transfers after inheriting a 
woeful team last season. 
</P>
<P>
Forwards John Levitt and Eric Bamberger are among the three lettermen. Ask for 
a projected starting lineup if you really want to hear peals of laughter from 
the athletic department.

<P>
DISASTER STRIKING ALL FRONTS NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One step forward, two steps back. That's the Rams' favorite dance this season. 
It has been a hypnotic sort of march into oblivion, like a legion of zombies in 
retreat. 
</P>
<P>
When the opportunity for failure has presented itself, the Rams have almost 
always snatched it. And this malaise has spread throughout the team. Now, even 
the former league-leading offense is infected. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever it seems to come down to a crucial play, the play that decides the 
winning and the losing of the game, we seem to make the wrong move, pretty 
consistently and pretty much throughout our team," Coach John Robinson said. "I 
think we're all sick and tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
This Ram team doesn't just wait for crunch time to crumble, however. They've 
turned self-destruction into a 3 1/2-hour art form and Sunday's 24-21 loss to 
the Dallas Cowboys is a prime example. 
</P>
<P>
First Quarter: Jim Everett throws the ball over the head of a wide-open Robert 
Delpino on a third-and-three play near midfield. A decent throw means a sure 
first down and probably a 20- to 30-yard gain. Then Ram cornerback Darryl 
Henley falls face first in the end zone on the touchdown pass to Cowboy wideout 
Michael Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
Second Quarter: Linebacker Mike Wilcher slams into Dallas quarterback Troy 
Aikman, who lets loose with a 10-yard lob that descends among three Ram 
linebackers. There isn't a Cowboy in sight, but Kevin Greene manages to 
out-jump Frank Stams and Larry Kelm to bat down the ball. A couple of minutes 
later, Everett hooks up with Flipper Anderson for a 79-yard touchdown pass, but 
the play is called back because Aaron Cox moved too soon. 
</P>
<P>
Third Quarter: Cox and Anderson drop passes and the Rams are penalized for a 
face-mask infraction, holding and an illegal block. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth Quarter: Cleveland Gary fumbles on the Cowboys' five-yard line. Dallas 
recovers and drives 89 yards for the game-winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the Rams played pretty well. 
</P>
<P>
"When you start looking at the film and break down things, you can point to 
things that are good," Robinson said. "You say, 'Hey we got 160 (actually 168) 
yards rushing. That's good. We held them to less than three yards (2.3) a rush. 
That's good.' But we gave away more than 150 yards in our own passing, with the 
penalty on the touchdown pass and several dropped passes and the one pass where 
Jim had Bobby Delpino wide open on a blitz. We've had more balls dropped in the 
last two weeks than I've seen in 2 1/2 years here. We should have had 450 yards 
and we wind up with around 300 (292)." 
</P>
<P>
Gary's fumble, of course, was the crowning blow. And while Robinson 
acknowledges the impact of Gary's fumble, he also maintains that it is pure 
folly to say the Rams problems began and ended with a loose football near the 
goal line. 
</P>
<P>
"He was trying to squeeze through the hole and the ball got caught on the back 
of one of our players," Robinson said. "It just popped out. But part of his 
responsibility is being able to make the plays and hold onto the football. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's important that I convey that this has nothing to do with an 
individual or a group of individuals. It's all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson says he has never been this baffled by a team during his career. He 
probably won't find any solutions by consulting his players. 
</P>
<P>
Offensive tackle Jackie Slater: "The bottom line is execution. We just aren't 
executing." 
</P>
<P>
Defensive tackle Doug Reed: "It's just a matter of us playing together a lot 
more and developing some kind of glue, some cohesiveness." 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Pete Holohan: "We aren't making plays and we especially aren't making 
them when we have to." 
</P>
<P>
Everett: "I don't have any answers. We just aren't playing competitive 
football." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have had their share of bad breaks this season, but Robinson is hoping 
nobody in the organization will let sour grapes replace their champagne dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"One can delude our situation by saying we've been unlucky, and I think we have 
been unlucky," he said, "but we probably deserve to be unlucky the way we're 
playing."

Coach Art Shell said Monday's victory wasn't tainted because Miami was playing 
without receivers Mark Clayton, Freddie Banks and fullback Tony Paige. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't make excuses when we lost people," Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel sorry for them." 
</P>
<P>
Shell couldn't have been happier with his team's numbers against Miami: The 
Raiders rushed for a season-high 177 yards and yielded a season-low 14 yards 
rushing on defense. The Raider pass rush sacked Dan Marino twice and kept 
consistent pressure on him, but the Raider offensive line did not allow a sack 
of quarterback Jay Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing was impressive," Shell said. "The whole team came out and 
played, not just the defense." 
</P>
<P>
Shell on the possibility of signing defensive end Dexter Manley: "To be 
truthful, we haven't discussed Manley." . . . Bo Jackson reported a sore neck 
Tuesday and fullback Napoleon McCallum cracked a bone in his wrist on a 
kickoff. CHRIS DUFRESNE

Dave Kragthorpe will be fired from his job as head coach of the Oregon State 
football team, a Portland television station reported.

the firing would be announced today after school Athletic Director Dutch 
Baughman meets with Kragthorpe. 
</P>
<P>
Baughman refused to comment. Oregon State went 1-10 this year. 
</P>
<P>
Kragthorpe, 57, has a 17-48-2 record at Oregon State.

Notre Dame's Raghib (Rocket) Ismail is "very, very doubtful" for Saturday 
night's game against USC at the Coliseum, Irish Coach Lou Holtz said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A deep thigh bruise kept Ismail out of the second half of Notre Dame's 24-21 
loss to Penn State last Saturday at South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail injured his right thigh two months ago against Michigan State, 
aggravated the injury a week later against Purdue and didn't play the next week 
in a 36-31 loss to Stanford at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, (the doctors) said he was definitely out of (this week's) game," 
Holtz said. "Rocket refuses to hear that. I'd say the chances of him playing in 
the game are very, very doubtful, but I'd be less than honest if I didn't tell 
you that I have saved a spot on the airplane in the event that something 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
Even if he plays, Holtz said, Ismail will not return kicks. 
</P>
<P>
In last season's 28-24 loss to Notre Dame at South Bend, USC quarterback Todd 
Marinovich passed for 333 yards, setting school records with 33 completions and 
55 attempts. Last Saturday, in a 45-42 victory over UCLA at the Rose Bowl, 
Marinovich threw a game-winning 23-yard touchdown pass to Johnnie Morton. 
</P>
<P>
So, who will start Saturday against Notre Dame? As they have every week for the 
past month, Marinovich and senior Shane Foley will compete for the job in 
practice, Coach Larry Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to change it now," Smith said. JERRY CROWE

Hollywood Park will celebrate the holiday week by offering four stakes, topped 
by Sunday's $500,000 Hollywood Starlet for 2-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
Expected to head the field in the Grade I race are Ifyoucouldseemenow and 
Cuddles, the 1-2 finishers in the Moccasin Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens, who fractured his right elbow last Wednesday, is hopeful he'll be 
back to ride Cuddles for trainer Wayne Lukas. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven California-breds were entered for Thanksgiving Day's $100,000 On Trust 
Handicap. Sensational Star, who was beaten as the prohibitive favorite in the 
California Cup Sprint, is likely to be the favorite in the one-mile race. 
Others scheduled to start are Kennedy's Knockout, Kept His Cool, Shirkee, Eddie 
Champion, Stylish Stud, Gum, Rocket Gibralter, On The Menu, No Commitment and 
Individualist. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, General Meeting, Cien Fuegos and Olympio, all candidates for next 
month's $1-million Hollywood Futurity, are scheduled to race in the 
seven-furlong $100,000 Hollywood Prevue Breeders' Cup Stakes. Saturday, 
sprinters will get together in the $100,000 Vernon O. Underwood race, formerly 
called the National Sprint Championship.

HEISAJOY, ROYAL BUSHWHACKER SCORE BIG WINS FOR SMALL LOUISIANA CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Quarter horse fans are still dancing in the streets of Evans and Opelousas in 
Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
Horses that began their careers in the Pelican State and are owned by residents 
of those small towns won the two richest races during the fourth Quarter Horse 
Breeders Classic Championship Day Saturday night at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes after Heisajoy recorded a $15 upset in the featured $147,000 Classic, 
Royal Bushwhacker bushwhacked his rivals in the $110,100 Juvenile, returning 
$14.80. 
</P>
<P>
Heisajoy, a 5-year-old gelding, is owned by Scott Jeane of Evans, just north of 
Vinton, near Delta Downs. Royal Bushwhacker, a 2-year-old gelding, is owned by 
John Soileau of Opelousas, near Lafayette, home of Evangeline Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Heisajoy thrust himself into contention for world champion honors, which he 
will win if he is able to duplicate his performance in the $250,000-added 
Champion of Champions, also at 440 yards, here on Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi-born trainer H.L. Hooper, who spent several years in Louisiana 
before moving west, thinks Heisajoy has yet to run his best race. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still experimenting to find the right combination for his shoes," Hooper 
said after the horse nipped Jazzing Hi and Tee Roy Reb in a three-horse photo 
finish. "He's a big strong powerful horse and he lost his footing again. He 
always has trouble with the ground on that first jump, and he didn't get a good 
start. I knew he'd be making up ground but I didn't know if he could spot 
horses of this caliber a length and beat them." 
</P>
<P>
Heisajoy has won six stakes in nine outings the past two years since he was 
sent to Hooper from Louisiana at the end of his 3-year-old year. He was bred by 
Claude and Bessie Lea Jeane, parents of the owner. 
</P>
<P>
"They've never been to California," said Claude Bouette, a friend. "They're 
afraid to fly." 
</P>
<P>
Hooper thanked Bouette's son, Brad, for the horse's big year. 
</P>
<P>
"Brad (a veterinarian) took a flake out of one knee at the end of last year," 
said Hooper. He returned better than ever in June. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Bushwhacker nipped Vital Sign by a nose under Alvin Brossette, another 
newcomer this year from Louisiana. The gelding arrived here three weeks ago and 
had the benefit of only one workout for his California debut. 
</P>
<P>
Soileau, who runs an offshore catering company, paid $53,000 for Royal 
Bushwhacker at the Heritage Place yearling sale in Oklahoma but initially 
thought he had invested in a lemon. 
</P>
<P>
Through the work of Eddie Arsenault and Ken Roberts, the current trainer, Royal 
Bushwhacker developed into a standout, winning the Firecracker Futurity at 
Delta and finishing a nose behind eventual winner Refrigerator in an 
All-American Futurity Trial at Ruidoso Downs, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll just give him some time off and wait until next year," said Roberts, a 
leading Louisiana trainer. "I always felt horses in Louisiana could compete in 
this, but it's so far to travel and so hard on them." 
</P>
<P>
Veteran trainer Rodney Hart put on a memorable show for his identical twin 
sisters, Colleen Spencer and Corrine Sieverding, who made their annual trip 
from Yankton, S.D. Hart, 57, had entrants in two breeders' races and won one 
for each of his sisters. 
</P>
<P>
Sandys Love Bug was an easy 1 3/4-length winner in the $40,080 Sprint, shortly 
after Jacks Dash had posted a $26.60 surprise in the $15,690 Freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Sandys Love Bug, a 4-year-old gelding, has designs on the Champion of Champions 
after an earlier victory in the Pomona Invitational Handicap and a second to 
Heisajoy by a head in the Inaugural Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"I bought him for $50,000 for L. Dean Harrington of Ontario before the Pomona 
race," Hart said. "We knew he could run. He beat See Me Do It (defending world 
champion) at Ruidoso. He's got a shoeing problem and hit his hock pretty bad in 
his last start. But it's getting better." 
</P>
<P>
Hart, a former rider who began training here in 1960, won the Freshman for the 
second time in three years. He won with Zoro Jet in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Hart claimed Jacks Dash, a son of Dash for Cash, for $12,500 in July for Alvin 
Ely of Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Allred, Los Alamitos president and CEO, was elated over an attendance 
figure of 12,175 and handle of $2,113,523. The handle was an all-time quarter 
horse record, eclipsing the $1,889,356 mark at Los Alamitos on Aug. 14, 1982. 
On-track alone, Saturday figures were 8,019 and $1,402,633, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had bigger crowds," Allred said. "But everybody in the industry around 
the country was here. Most of them were here two years ago, when the place was 
crummy, and they all recognized the improvement." 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos underwent ownership and management changes last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jockey John Creager posted a double with Dashin Dee Dee in the $30,275 Pacific 
Classics Derby and Lil Bit Rusty in the $41,720 Distaff, his first Breeders 
Championship victories. 
</P>
<P>
Owner-breeder Mac Murray, a car dealer from Salt Lake City, gave Dashin Dee Dee 
a kiss in the winner's circle. Trainer Dennis Ekins is eagerly awaiting her 
half-sister. "Susie's Girl Sally is unbeaten in five starts in Utah," said 
Ekins. "She'll be coming for the Golden State Futurity (Dec. 29)." 
</P>
<P>
Texan R.C. Howell, who trains Lil Bit Rusty for Gordon Haslam of Winooski, Vt., 
is considering the Champion of Champions for the 4-year-old mare. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Blane Schvaneveldt scored a record seventh Breeders Championship 
victory with Tempered Glass in the $26,100 Sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Schvaneveldt also won the $111,096 California Sires Cup Futurity Friday with 
Blisterin, a 2-year-old Tolltac gelding who covered the 350 yards in a 
blistering 17.50 seconds. Blisterin, owned by Glenda and Everett List of 
Bellflower, was purchased last year through a magazine ad run by the horse's 
breeder, Valeria Foresta of Solvang. He has won four of five starts. 
</P>
<P>
Six Figures, who won the $20,020 Marathon by a neck over Baychaino, is owned by 
77-year-old Eddie Tsuruta, a retired truck farmer from Huntington Beach. 
Trainer Elmer January claimed the 5-year-old gelding six months ago for Tsuruta 
for $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
Defending World Champion See Me Do It, who finished fourth as the 4-5 favorite 
in the Classic, had an excuse and hopes to make amends in the Champion of 
Champions. "She bled worse this time than she ever has," said trainer Bobby 
Turner. "A lot of horses bled that night that hadn't before." The 4-year-old 
filly ran with the diuretic Lasix but apparently bled through it.

Missouri assistant basketball coach Rich Daly will appeal an NCAA finding that 
he was guilty of unethical conduct, his attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
"We think Rich got a bad rap," lawyer Wally Bley said. 
</P>
<P>
Daly resigned along with assistant coach Bob Sundvold after Missouri was put on 
two years probation and penalized with recruiting and scholarship restrictions 
Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
The resignations will take effect March 31. Sundvold's attorney, Kip Kubin, 
said he still was considering an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Daly, who recruited several star players from Detroit for Missouri, was found 
guilty of providing false and misleading information to the NCAA during a 
hearing Sept. 28 because he said he could not remember certain events.

When top-seeded La Habra High School played La Jolla in the first round of the 
Southern California Division II playoffs Tuesday night, it wasn't just a ho-hum 
victory by La Habra. It was more like ho-hum-yawn. 
</P>
<P>
Powered by middle-hitter Missy Clements' 14 kills, La Habra swept La Jolla, 
15-4, 15-4, 15-7. 
</P>
<P>
"Missy was hot early so we tried to got to her a little more," La Habra Coach 
Sandy Blumenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
Early? The entire match lasted just 75 minutes. The second game took 15 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla (20-10) had trouble spiking past 6-foot-5 Zrinka Kristich, 6-2 Ana 
Kristich and 5-11 Clements. 
</P>
<P>
"They really didn't have anybody who could just put the ball away," Blumenthal 
said. "It was pretty obvious that we just had too many hitters for them." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Zrinka Kristich had 12 kills and Ana Kristich had eight to add to 
Clements' 14. Maybe that's why La Habra (23-0) has won 42 consecutive matches 
and is the two-time Division 3-A champions and the defending Division II State 
Champions. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra will play Bakersfield Highland, which defeated Long Beach St. Anthony, 
14-16, 15-6, 13-15, 15-10, 15-9, on Saturday at La Habra.

NEWSWIRE: AUSTRALIAN IRE RAISED BY CLAY FOR DAVIS CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash heads the Australian squad that will 
challenge the United States in the upcoming Davis Cup finals from Nov. 30-Dec. 
2 at the Florida Suncoast Dome, Aussie captain Neale Fraser said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Darren Cahill, Wally Masur and Richard Fromberg complete the Australian squad. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser and Cash were both highly critical the U.S. Tennis Assn.'s choice of a 
specially built, indoor red clay court for the finals and charged that Davis 
Cup rules were being violated by the surface selection. 
</P>
<P>
"The rule is that the surface must be in general use in the country, but when 
you put down a red clay court in a baseball stadium I don't consider that to be 
in general use," Fraser said. "It is just mind-boggling to me that a country 
with their level of players and expertise would go to this length. We are 
delighted with the compliment," Fraser said. 
</P>
<P>
It is up to the host country to select the playing surface, and the USTA 
obviously feels that slow clay will give the United States its greatest 
advantage over the Australians, who have had most of their success on grass. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Agassi and Michael Chang have been selected by captain Tom Gorman to play 
singles for the United States, and Rick Leach and Jim Pugh will play doubles.

EVEN IN A LOSING SEASON, WEBB PLAYS LIKE A WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Traci Webb has been concentrating of her freshman volleyball season, which 
ended Tuesday in a loss to Cal State Long Beach and a 9-21 record. 
</P>
<P>
She dealt with the pressure of being a freshman setter, one who was in the 
lineup long before she had adjusted to the difficulties of college volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
And the Anteaters' season wasn't an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to keep losing," Webb said. "We are getting better." 
</P>
<P>
Every once in a while, she heard something that encouraged her, even if it was 
a bit puzzling. 
</P>
<P>
"You're in fourth already," another student who lives in her dorm told her. 
Then, the other day he said, "You're almost in third." 
</P>
<P>
When the season ended Tuesday, Webb was third on Irvine's list of career 
assists. She finished with 866, behind Ann Warmus, who had 2,542 in four years 
ending in 1988, and Rhonda Schnitger, who had 1,088 in 1988 and '89. 
</P>
<P>
The statistic can be misleading. "It's (affected by) opportunities, plus the 
amount of matches, and the amount of games we play within a match," said Mike 
Puritz, her coach. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers haven't been kept too carefully at Irvine, and the list might not 
be accurate. It doesn't take into account that some players shared the 
position. Nevertheless, there is Webb's name. Her talents are being recognized. 
</P>
<P>
It is a fair reward for a player who was thrown into a sink-or-swim situation 
when she joined an Irvine team without a returning full-time setter. 
</P>
<P>
"She was barely treading water early in the season," Puritz said. "It took a 
while. The last few matches Traci has played at the level I unrealistically 
expected she would come in at." 
</P>
<P>
Webb, a freshman from University High School, knew she was stepping into a 
position of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous," she said. "I still feel the pressure. But the players who were 
freshmen last year said a lot of the pressure is relieved just by becoming a 
sophomore." 
</P>
<P>
Webb, who is 5 feet 4, has often had to resist coaches' attempts to turn her 
into a back-row specialist because of her height, which could be a liability in 
blocking. 
</P>
<P>
Her insistence on playing setter has cost her opportunities to play on top club 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I could be on the best team as a back-row specialist or on a lower team 
setting," Webb said. "I chose to set." 
</P>
<P>
And when she came to Irvine, Puritz chose not to ask her to change. 
</P>
<P>
"It did not even enter my mind," he said. "She can handle it." 
</P>
<P>
Go figure: Irvine's water polo team won the NCAA championship last year, but 
finished this season with a 13-16 record, the first losing season in the 
history of the program. 
</P>
<P>
But when Big West Conference coaches chose the all-conference players, they put 
two Irvine players on the seven-man first team -- junior Skylar Putman and 
sophomore Pablo Yrizar, who missed the latter part of the season with a hand 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
UC Santa Barbara, which tied Pepperdine for the Big West title, had three 
players on the first team. The Waves had the player of the year, Geoffrey 
Clark. The other first-team player was from Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Gill, the Anteaters' leading scorer, was an honorable mention. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald McDonald, Irvine's starting point guard, injured his right ring finger 
during practice Tuesday and was taken to the student health center for X-rays 
on the finger, which he has broken before. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bill Mulligan said the X-rays were inconclusive and that McDonald will 
practice today before the team leaves for Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan said Tuesday night he did not expect the injury would prevent McDonald 
from playing against UCLA Friday in the first round of the Great Alaska 
Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
In what might be part of the fallout from a 5-23 record last season, the men's 
basketball team has signed only one player during the fall signing period, 
Elzie Love of Perris High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I spent 30 days in different homes," Mulligan said. "It's a little 
frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
But Mulligan thinks recruiting will improve with a few more victories -- that, 
and proof that the Anteaters will play the running style that Mulligan is 
convinced attracts players. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Beers, who averaged 16 points and 12 rebounds last season for Chino 
High School, a team that was highly ranked last season, has signed a national 
letter of intent to attend Irvine and play for the women's basketball team. 
Irvine earlier signed Jinelle Williams of Brea-Olinda and Christina Adams of El 
Cajon Granite.

HOMEFED STOCK OFF 25% ON NEW LOAN CONCERNS; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: A SAGGING ECONOMY AND REAL ESTATE MARKET COULD LEAVE THE SAN 
DIEGO-BASED S&amp;L WITH $1 BILLION IN PROBLEM ACCOUNTS BY YEAR-END. 
</P>

<P>
Hard hit by troubled real estate loans, HomeFed Bank has told federal 
regulators that if the economy fails to improve, its problem loans could 
increase by $250 million in the fourth quarter to a total of about $1 billion 
by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
That news from the nation's fifth-largest savings and loan was viewed as 
dramatic proof of California's weakening economy and its increasingly 
lackluster real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
It also offered further evidence that the state's struggling financial industry 
could face even tougher times ahead, if HomeFed's assumption is correct that 
there will be no immediate improvement in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed stock fell Tuesday by $1.875 or 25% to $5.50 after a leading Wall 
Street analyst issued a "sell" report. Stock in HomeFed, which had been one of 
the nation's strongest thrifts, has plummeted from a high of $33.25 in June. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, analysts cautioned that San Diego-based HomeFed could be hit with 
further bad news soon if the federal Office of Thrift Supervision and the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. uncover more nonperforming loans in upcoming 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
In his report, Jerome Gitt, a San Francisco-based analyst with Merrill Lynch 
Global Securities Research, warned that HomeFed's "current reserve levels may 
not be adequate in six months or a year" if more nonperforming loans are found 
or 
</P>
<P>
the economy does not improve. He offered the recommendation to sell the stock 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell K. Chaney, a San Francisco-based analyst with Sutro &amp; Co, observed 
that for HomeFed, "The big intangible right now is the examiners' visit. 
Examiners could be more conservative (than HomeFed) when it comes to 
determining nonperforming loans." 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed President Robert Adelizzi declined to comment on the regulators' 
upcoming, regularly scheduled December visits. "That would be speculation," he 
said. "We're on top of our issues, we know our portfolio reasonably well." 
</P>
<P>
If HomeFed's portfolio of nonperforming loans increases by $250 million, its 
ratio of problem loans to total assets would increase to 5.3%, an alarmingly 
high figure. As of Sept. 30, HomeFed's nonperforming loans totaled $749 
million, or 3.92% of assets. In a 10-Q filing dated Nov. 13, HomeFed said it 
expected problem loans to exceed $1 billion if economic conditions continue. 
</P>
<P>
Adelizzi said the anticipated increase in problem loans could be blamed on 
across-the-board problems with its single-family mortgage, apartment and 
commercial real estate loan portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
The $1-billion estimate in the SEC filing was "based on trends we're seeing in 
the market and in our portfolio right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the increase in problem loans was due to the S&amp;L's formally 
classifying as nonperforming a $70-million office building loan to La Jolla 
developer Jack Naiman. The loan, HomeFed's single largest, is secured by a 
first mortgage on Naiman Tech Center, a 635,000-square-foot office and research 
park in San Diego's Sorrento Valley. HomeFed will "continue to negotiate" with 
Naiman, Rowan said. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed, with $19.1 billion in assets and 215 branches, met each of the federal 
government's three minimum capital adequacy tests on Sept. 30. It "intends to 
meet" the capital requirements at year-end, spokeswoman Kaye Rowan said. 
</P>
<P>
David J. Dunn, founder and general partner of La Jolla-based Idanta Partners, 
which disclosed earlier this month that it had acquired 7.2% of HomeFed's 
shares, said he was "not surprised" by market reaction Tuesday. He repeated his 
previous statement that Idanta's investment in HomeFed was for the long term.

JAMES FLANIGAN: ISRAEL'S SOVIET EMIGRES MAY OPEN NEW ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the world is focused on the Persian Gulf, and on President Bush, U.S. 
forces and Saddam Hussein's Iraq, events are occurring in Israel that may bring 
a better future to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Israel expects to take in between 100,000 and 200,000 immigrants 
from the Soviet Union. And the flow could reach 350,000 next year, says Deputy 
Prime Minister Moshe Nissim, who is also Minister of Trade and Industry. 
Indeed, Israel's 4.5 million population will expand by an astounding 25% in the 
next five years, Nissim predicts. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Soviet emigres are the kind of people economists these days call 
"excellent human capital" -- relatively well-educated and young, with the 
skills needed for electronic and biochemical industries. Long-term, there's 
little doubt the newcomers will give a boost to Israel's economy. 
</P>
<P>
But short-term they present Israel with the challenge of finding housing and 
work for them. So Nissim was visiting the United States this week, trying to 
attract investment from U.S. companies. He was offering loan guarantees and tax 
breaks, as all countries do when seeking foreign investment. And he had 
something more to offer, access to the U.S. and European Community markets 
because Israel has free-trade agreements with both. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Israel has had free-trade agreements and skilled technical people -- and a 
lot of U.S. foreign aid -- for decades, but it hasn't succeeded economically. 
The economy's early growth, 9% a year in Israel's beginnings 40 years ago, has 
long since slowed to a crawl. Unemployment is now 10%, and the economy has been 
in a recession for two years. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that Israel has what amounts to a Socialist economy with lots of 
government control and regulation of industry. Methods that helped to start a 
nation in 1948 are now a burden. For example, great power in the early days was 
given to the national labor federation to dictate policy on employment and on 
investment and social benefits. At one point it owned whole sectors of Israeli 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Networks of subsidies are built into the everyday economy. If you work for some 
companies, you get free electricity; for others, you get free transportation. 
</P>
<P>
But there's no free lunch. Israeli taxation is confiscatory, nearly a 70% 
marginal rate at income of $20,000. It's an economy that has inspired a lot of 
tax evasion, and at least the beginnings of tax and bureaucratic reform. 
</P>
<P>
Progress has been slow, however and experts would have Israel go faster. "With 
human capital like Israel's, there's no excuse for the lagging economy," says 
Benjamin Zycher, professor of economics at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Even Israel's extraordinary security needs -- 17% of its economy is devoted to 
defense, three times the U.S. level -- are no excuse for a slow economy, says 
Steve Hanke, a senior fellow at the Institute for Advanced Political and 
Strategic Studies in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan and South Korea faced great security threats also, but freed up their 
economies and are thriving," says Hanke. "Hong Kong took in many more 
immigrants than Israel and put them to work with a free-market economy." 
</P>
<P>
What's the point? That the Soviet immigrants could force overdue changes in 
Israel. "Their influx is so massive that subsidies can be canceled and reforms 
pushed through in the name of absorbing the immigrants," says Douglas Feith, a 
partner in the Washington law firm Feith &amp; Zell, a former member of the 
National Security Council and an expert on Middle East and Soviet affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet immigrants have just left the world's biggest bureaucracy and don't 
want that in Israel," Feith says. "For example, Israel offers immigrants either 
government housing or an allowance to find their own housing. So many of the 
Soviet immigrants are taking the allowances, living three families to an 
apartment and pooling the money to start a business." 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years of that kind of spirit, aided by foreign investment, could 
make Israel a highly successful island of technology. 
</P>
<P>
Why does a successful Israel matter to Americans? For one thing, America 
supports Israel with $3 billion a year in foreign aid. But then, it supports 
practically the whole Middle East -- Egypt and Jordan, with money; Saudi 
Arabia, with military might. America's stake in the region, as we see so 
clearly with troops and tanks in the desert, goes way beyond money. 
</P>
<P>
And that's why an economically improving, less unstable Middle East would 
certainly be in the U.S. interest. No, economics alone won't make the lion lie 
down with the lamb, but an economically improved Israel could be a model -- "a 
lodestar for the region," in the words of one expert, as Taiwan, Hong Kong and 
Singapore are for Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Such visions, of course, look past the present crisis, which must end with U.S. 
victory. "I don't know, by fighting or by political means, the U.S. has to 
win," Nissim says. 
</P>
<P>
A leading U.S. strategic expert, who prefers to speak anonymously, puts the 
stakes bluntly: "If Saddam Hussein is allowed to emerge from this crisis with 
what looks like victory, then the U.S. would be discredited and all bets would 
be off for Israel. War in the Middle East would be guaranteed, Israel would 
have to fight for survival. 
</P>
<P>
"But if the U.S. wins, then a new era in the Middle East can begin." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe a combination of Soviet immigrants and U.S. troops can make it happen.

SIMMONS ASKS LOCKHEED TO HELP HIM FUND A BUYOUT OF THE FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Texas investor Harold C. Simmons told Lockheed Corp. on Tuesday that he wants 
it to pay, in part, for him to acquire it -- an inventive plan that suggests 
the lengths to which financiers must go to complete takeovers with the collapse 
of the junk bond market that underwrote such deals in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons provided details of the proposal, initially advanced last week, during 
a meeting with Lockheed executives in Los Angeles. He had requested the meeting 
to flesh out his Nov. 12 takeover offer, a $40-per-share bid valued at about 
$1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed's management, which defeated Simmons in a proxy battle for control of 
the company's board last spring, said Tuesday that it would respond to the 
offer in "due course." Though the company has continued to clash with Simmons 
over corporate strategy, it has indicated it is willing to review proposals 
from NL Industries, a Houston-based chemical company controlled by Simmons that 
is Lockheed's largest single shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plan put forward by Simmons, Lockheed would borrow or otherwise raise 
$820 million in acquisition financing -- about half the cost of the deal. NL 
Industries would cover the other half of the acquisition cost. 
</P>
<P>
NL Industries President J. Landis Martin, who participated in Simmons' 
presentation, said his company has $400 million on hand to invest in the deal. 
Martin said the remaining $400 million would be raised by selling some NL 
Industries assets and by borrowing -- but not by selling high-risk, high-yield 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts believe that the bid will be rejected partly because 
Lockheed would have to help finance the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
"That's like asking management to provide the bullets for the gun that would be 
used to shoot them," said Gary Reich, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton. 
"Board members would have to be out of their minds to agree to this." 
</P>
<P>
Reich said Lockheed's missile and space operations alone were worth more than 
what Simmons was offering for the entire company. If Lockheed's various 
operations were sold off separately, he said, the company would be worth about 
$4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed stock closed at $29.75, down $1.125 in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange, reflecting investors' tepid response to Simmons' proposal. 
</P>
<P>
While Reich speculated that Simmons might make wholesale changes in Lockheed 
management, Martin said there would be no major changes in management if NL 
acquired the defense firm. NL -- which already owns about 19% of the 
Calabasas-based company's stock -- would replace Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. 
Tellep, Martin said, but would seek to retain him in some other capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Martin also said NL would not have to sell Lockheed any operations to help 
cover the cost of the acquisition. Money now used to pay dividends to 
shareholders would be sufficient to cover the debt taken on in financing the 
deal, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
According to Martin, Simmons and two Lockheed executives -- Richard W. Taylor, 
vice president for corporate development, and Anthony Van Schaick, vice 
president and treasurer -- discussed Lockheed's future financial status during 
the Tuesday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The NL team, accompanied by a merger specialist from Salomon Bros., presented 
future cash flow estimates and other financial projections for Lockheed in an 
attempt to show that the aerospace firm could handle the debt that would stem 
from the proposed deal. 
</P>
<P>
The Lockheed executives, who were accompanied by advisers from First Boston and 
Goldman Sachs, said they would examine the projections and provide NL with an 
analysis of the financial feasibility of the proposal next week, according to 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed declined comment on the meeting.

MAZDA MAY BE SHOPPING FOR AN AD AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mazda Motors of America has begun shopping for an advertising agency to handle 
marketing chores for a new upscale car line to go up against Toyota's Nexus and 
Nissan's Infiniti, industry sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the new line -- being planned at Mazda's Irvine headquarters 
complex by a development team code-named Pegasus Group -- is merely a 
feasibility study. 
</P>
<P>
But one source said Mazda is expected to announce a final decision on the U.S. 
launch of Pegasus next year, possibly as early as the Chicago Auto Show in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Mazda headquarters and at the Pegasus offices could not be reached 
Tuesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
But sources that have been briefed by Mazda said the U.S. importer interviewed 
five advertising agencies in Irvine last week, including Foote, Cone &amp; 
Belding/Santa Ana -- the agency that handles the rest of Mazda's domestic 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Adweek magazine, a trade journal, reported that at least three other agencies, 
two in New York and one in Dallas, are in the running. Adweek estimates that 
the Pegasus account could be worth up to $75 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Pegasus team reportedly is discussing a three-car line, to be sold in 
separate showrooms, that would include a full-size V-12 sedan, a V-8 coupe

Franchisees Sue Popeyes: A group of franchise owners in 20 states has sued the 
owner of the Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken chain. The franchisees contend that 
Al Copeland violated state and federal antitrust laws by forcing them to 
purchase products from his companies. The suit asks that Copeland be ordered to 
let franchises buy food and other products from alternative suppliers and make 
product specifications available to those suppliers.

MARKETING: CHIAT LANDS THE SPARKLETTS AD ACCOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't look for the Sparkletts man to don pink ears, sunglasses and start 
banging a big drum. 
</P>
<P>
But the same Los Angeles ad agency that set loose the rambunctious Eveready 
rabbit -- Chiat/Day/Mojo -- on Tuesday won the estimated $10-million 
advertising business for McKesson Water Products, the Eagle Rock-based maker of 
Sparkletts non-carbonated drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
"If you knock out the Dodgers, it's hard to think of any brand more closely 
associated with Los Angeles than Sparkletts," said David Nufer, vice president 
of marketing and strategic planning at McKesson, which has sold the Sparkletts 
brand here since 1925. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, some might say, few agencies are more closely associated with Los 
Angeles than Venice-based Chiat/Day. The firm, which also creates ads for 
Nissan, is the largest agency on the West Coast, with annual billings 
nationally of nearly $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But the vast majority of Chiat/Day's local business is generated by Nissan. "We 
would love to continue to grow the agency with non-automotive business," said 
Bob Wolf, chairman of Chiat/Day/Mojo's North American operations. 
</P>
<P>
In that light, the agency has several new hopes. It is a finalist for the 
estimated $50-million NutraSweet Co. account, and for the $15 million in 
advertising business of Toshiba America Computer Systems. Both companies are 
expected to select their agencies next month. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear exactly what will happen to the friendly and familiar Sparkletts 
man, who for years has appeared in ads singing the tune, "Me and Sparkletts 
water making friends." Executives of both McKesson and its new agency declined 
to speculate. But Wolf did note, "They have a lot of equity in the guy." 
</P>
<P>
The Sparkletts man was created by the Los Angeles office of Sachs-Finley, which 
handled McKesson Water Products' ad business for 21 years. "We hope Chiat/Day 
enjoys the same 21 years of fun and success that we had," said Jerry Sachs, 
president of Sachs-Finley, which resigned the business several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Sparkletts, McKesson -- the nation's No. 2 water company -- also sells 
its water under different names in other areas, including Alhambra in the San 
Francisco area and Crystal in parts of Arizona. All of its brands have stayed 
clear of the spate of bottled water recalls that affected six companies this 
year, including Perrier and, more recently, Koala Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The new ads, which may focus less on home delivery and more on in-store sales, 
probably won't appear until next spring.

Mideast Is Missile Showcase: Raytheon of Lexington, Mass., looks healthy in the 
wake of military cutbacks because its two major products -- the Patriot missile 
and the Hawk air-to-air missile -- have been widely deployed in America's 
Middle East operation, capturing the attention of allies. Israel likely will 
buy the Patriot next year, and Saudi Arabia reportedly is speeding up its 
purchases.

Turkey, Great Britain and Egypt have expressed interest in one or both systems.

New Metric Incentive: Anticipating that a united European market in 1992 will 
discriminate against U.S. companies that have not converted to metric 
measurements, the U.S. government will require in September, 1992, that nearly 
all its contracts be drawn to metric specifications. It tried to push the 
country toward the metric system in 1975 with the U.S. Metric Conversion Act, 
but the law was voluntary and few companies complied. Those that did, including 
most auto companies and the liquor industry, say they saw big savings. They 
added that the system is more logical, simple and exact. Tampa Tribune

Tobacco Exports: Although Japan's liberalized tobacco import laws helped 
cigarette sales increase in 1989 for the first time in five years, the 
percentage of the population that smokes continues to fall. In the past 24 
years, the male smoking population has decreased more than 20%. Although 
imported tobacco continues to gain a bigger share of the shrinking market, 
opposition to imports is growing. Anti-smoking groups have protested cigarette 
commercials on television and cigarette companies' sponsorship of sports 
events. They want heavier tobacco duties and higher cigarette prices. Look

2 CABLE COURT CHANNELS ARE EXPECTED TO MERGE; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: THE COMPETING SERVICES WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY SIGNING UP LOCAL SYSTEMS. 
</P>

<P>
Two new cable TV channels that propose to telecast live courtroom trials are 
expected to announce a merger today, sources close to both companies said. 
</P>
<P>
The two planned channels -- "In Court" from Cablevision Systems Corp. and "The 
American Lawyer Media Channel" from a partnership between Time Warner Inc. and 
American Lawyer magazine -- have been struggling since early this year to sign 
up local cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
But the launch for both of the new services has been repeatedly delayed because 
of limited channel availability on local cable systems and financial and 
regulatory pressure on the cable TV industry. 
</P>
<P>
Cable system operators, seeking to avoid another costly battle that hurt the 
recent launch of two competing comedy channels, are urging the backers to merge 
their planned services. 
</P>
<P>
Both of the channels have planned to telecast live courtroom dramas from the 44 
states that permit television coverage of trials and appellate hearings. "In 
Court" had hired actor E. G. Marshall as host, and American Lawyer had retained 
Fred Graham, a former CBS News and New York Times legal reporter, as its 
principal anchor. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the backers is believed to have budgeted millions of dollars to launch 
its service. Details of the expected merger could not be learned, but one 
report said the merged channel would be managed by the Time Warner interests. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither channel is yet on the air, both nevertheless have been taping 
such headline-making trials as the Robert Mapplethorpe obscenity case in 
Cincinnati, the 2 Live Crew trial in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., and the Central Park 
Jogger case in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Besides telecasting live coverage of trials, both channels had planned to 
augment their programming with commentary and even call-in programs so viewers 
could speak with legal experts. "In Court" said it also wanted to cover local 
bar association meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Neither channel has disclosed how many cable systems or subscribers it has been 
able to sign up. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to 
launch new advertiser-supported cable channels without giving cable systems an 
ownership stake in the enterprise.

MARKET BEAT: IF AN ANALYST SAYS 'HOLD,' HE MAY REALLY MEAN 'SELL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Bad day at the hangar: Boeing Co.'s stock was slammed down $4.625 to $42.625 on 
Tuesday, a 10% loss that helped drag the Dow industrials off 35.15 points to 
2,530.20. 
</P>
<P>
For Boeing, the hit came simply because Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. analyst Judith 
Comeau cut her rating on the stock from "buy" to "hold," citing rising 
long-term development costs for the company's planned 777 airliner. 
</P>
<P>
Though a "hold" rating would hardly seem to merit a 10% drop in market value -- 
which Comeau termed an "overreaction" -- many Goldman clients obviously saw 
something else in Comeau's rating change. She said "hold," but some clients saw 
a "sell." 
</P>
<P>
That scenario has been played out plenty of times lately, and it's resurrecting 
an old debate on Wall Street: Why don't analysts just say what they really mean 
instead of hiding a stock behind the kinder and gentler "hold" label? 
</P>
<P>
To look at Comeau's earnings expectations for Boeing, it's fairly easy to see 
why some long-term investors would opt to bail out. She believes that earnings 
could fall from $5.50 a share in 1992 to $3.70 a share in 1995, as Boeing 
spends billions of dollars to create the 777. 
</P>
<P>
There are bitter arguments over those projections among Boeing analysts, 
because many of them believe that Boeing has enough plane orders, and enough 
control over the delivery of those planes, to avoid any decline in earnings 
even through 1997, despite 777 costs. "I see a smooth progression in earnings 
out to $8 a share in 1997," argues analyst Paul Nisbet at Prudential-Bache 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
When Wall Street starts talking about 1997 in 1990, who's right and who's wrong 
becomes a debate for futurists. Nonetheless, Comeau's numbers certainly could 
warrant a sell rating on Boeing, given the strength of her conviction. 
</P>
<P>
So why didn't she say sell? "It's not what I mean," she says flatly. "I clearly 
am not recommending a sale." 
</P>
<P>
The stock is a hold, Comeau says, because Boeing's 1991 and 1992 earnings power 
suggest "there should be some intermediate ground" for the stock price. 
</P>
<P>
She sees it trading up around $50 eventually, based on earnings expectations of 
$5.50 a share for 1992, compared to $4.10 this year. So there's "no reason to 
sell into weakness, and there was no reason to sell (Tuesday)," she says. 
</P>
<P>
But if big investors overreacted Tuesday, it was probably because there remains 
deep suspicion about analysts' stock rating changes. For as long as there have 
been analysts, most of them have hated to rate a stock an outright "sell," 
preferring to keep most of their dogs in the beige "hold" area. 
</P>
<P>
One big reason for that is obvious: No corporate executive likes to have his 
operation labeled a loser. Because analysts rely on company insiders for much 
of their research data, a sell rating runs the risk that the company will cut 
off dialogue with the analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Some brokerages have gone to some pretty outrageous lengths to try to paper 
over the sell label. Earlier this year, Dean Witter Reynolds changed its lowest 
stock rating from sell to "swap," because some of the analysts argued that it 
would be less offensive to companies. 
</P>
<P>
Other brokerages have adopted convoluted rating systems that have a dozen 
shades between buy and sell -- to the point, one analyst says, "where some 
firms have so many ratings, no matter what happens to the stock, they've 
covered their asses." For example, if you rate a stock a "hold, with some risk" 
compared to an outright sell, and it falls out of bed, you can still argue that 
you warned about the risk. That's logic on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
To be fair, there also are some cogent arguments against sell labels. Tom 
Brock, research director at Salomon Bros. in New York, says analysts are 
justifiably "gun-shy about misinterpretation of a sell. . . . The real issue is 
that there's so much more to it than just a buy, sell or hold label." That's 
why analysts spend reams of paper in reports justifying their reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
R. Joseph Fuchs, research chief at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., notes that "one 
of the difficult things is to differentiate between a stock rating and a 
company rating." For example, an analyst may say sell just because a stock has 
run up too far, too fast, and not because there's anything fundamentally wrong 
with the company. But investors could construe the sell rating to mean that the 
company is about to see its earnings plunge. 
</P>
<P>
Still, most brokerage research chiefs admit that analysts ought to be far 
better about saying what they really mean, despite who it hurts. That's more 
important now than ever, because the truth is never worth more than during a 
bear market. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that every analyst on the Street ought to have more swaps 
and sells than holds now," says Manny Korman, research director at Dean Witter. 
</P>
<P>
After all, he notes, "For every portfolio manager, there are really only two 
decisions -- buy and sell. If you own it in the portfolio, you really do buy it 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STOCKS THEY REALLY DO HATE 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts often are reluctant to advise selling a stock, preferring 
instead to soft-peddle their pessimism with a "hold" rating. But these stocks 
currently have the greatest percentage of brokerage sell recommendations as 
tracked by First Call, a Boston-based research-tracker. The stocks are rated on 
a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 a strong buy and 5 a strong sell.

PEOPLE: 'WONDER YEARS' TEAM HIRED BY DISNEY STUDIOS 
</P>

Walt Disney Studios said Tuesday that it signed the husband-and-wife television 
writing team of Neal Marlens and Carol Black to a four-year contract to develop 
"a wide range of projects." 
</P>
<P>
Marlens and Black created "The Wonder Years" and originally produced "Growing 
Pains," both on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
The couple has a commitment for three more series at ABC. 
</P>
<P>
Although the deal with Disney is exclusive only in respect to television, "we 
hope to be involved with them in all areas," said Rich Frank, president of Walt 
Disney Studios. Marlens and Black also wrote the 1987 movie "Soul Man." 
</P>
<P>
As reported, Marlens and Black came close to signing a $15-million deal with 
Universal Studios last year before negotiations collapsed over creative 
differences. Sources valued the new agreement with Disney at about $13 million.

LOOKING AHEAD: THE NEW APPRECIATION OF SERVICE QUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN S. MORGAN and DIANE H. SCHMALENSEE, BRIAN S. MORGAN and DIANE H. 
SCHMALENSEE are vice presidents of Opinion Research Corp., a research and 
consulting firm headquartered in Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American industry is sold on the idea of service quality. Every major business 
publication has run a cover story on customer service, and companies that have 
won the Commerce Department's Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award have 
invested heavily in advertising their accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
American executives who participated in a recent survey by Opinion Research 
Corp. on quality issues said they look for Baldrige Award winners as suppliers. 
(The survey polled 500 executives of Fortune 1,000 companies and executives of 
companies that rank among the 500 largest whose main product is a service.) 
</P>
<P>
But how will American companies rise to the quality challenge? Even though the 
executives acknowledged that quality would attract customers, most did not 
believe that their companies were ready to take the leap required to obtain 
significant quality improvement. 
</P>
<P>
This reluctance represents skepticism about the value of service quality. It 
also represents an opportunity for those prepared to make the commitment now. 
</P>
<P>
The value of service quality is clear. The executives were asked whether they 
had either started or stopped doing business with companies in various 
industries. They were then asked whether product quality, service quality, 
price or something else was their reason for either starting or stopping 
business. The power of service quality is revealed by their answers. Service 
quality was the No. 1 reason for starting to do business. It was followed 
closely by product quality, then by price. When a decision was made to stop 
doing business, service quality weighed more heavily than product or price. 
More than two-thirds of those polled said service drives their decision to 
stop. Only a third mentioned product quality and price. Service quality, then, 
is the key to keeping business customers. 
</P>
<P>
Like business purchasers, consumers decide to start or stop doing business with 
a company on the basis of service quality. A survey of the general public 
revealed that service quality was the top reason for starting to do business 
with a company, followed closely by product quality, then price. When a 
decision was made to stop doing business, service quality again weighed more 
heavily than product or price. 
</P>
<P>
A recent study reported in the Harvard Business Review put a dollar value on 
the importance of customer retention. The results demonstrated that customer 
retention has a direct and substantial impact on profitability, with the 
increase in dollar value of repeat customers ranging from 25% to 85%, depending 
on the industry. The analysis revealed that loyal customers are more profitable 
because of increased purchases, reduced operating costs, the value of referrals 
and premium pricing. 
</P>
<P>
These studies underscore the importance of service quality: Quality improvement 
is the way to attract and retain customers, and a loyal customer base has a 
clear impact on the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
But the quest for quality improvement is a major challenge to American 
companies, and the fix is not a quick one. An examination of some of the 
Baldrige Award criteria reveals that quality improvement requires involvement 
of the entire organization. The criteria include: 
</P>
<P>
* Leadership. Senior management's effectiveness in creating and sustaining a 
culture of quality. 
</P>
<P>
* Strategic quality planning. The planning process and the integration of 
quality control systems in all aspects of operations. 
</P>
<P>
* Quality assurance results. The company's performance in quality and quality 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
* Customer satisfaction. The effectiveness of the company's systems for 
determining customer requirements and its success in meeting these 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, customer satisfaction counts for 30% of the criteria in 
determining the award. Leadership and quality assurance are next, with 15% 
each. 
</P>
<P>
Service quality improvement is an imperative for American companies hoping to 
compete in today's marketplace. As the range of choices continues to increase, 
customers will continue to desert companies that disappoint them. Quality of 
service will increasingly be the major factor in the decision to stay or leave.

ORANGE COUNTY -- AN S&amp;L GRAVEYARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County is home to more failed savings and loans than any other county in 
California. In the last five years, regulators have seized 19 county-based 
S&amp;Ls. The failures range from industry giant American Savings &amp; Loan in 
Irvine to small institutions, such as American Interstate Savings &amp; Loan in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Like S&amp;Ls nationwide, the county's thrifts have failed for a variety of 
reasons: mismanagement, bad and risky investments and outright fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Fraud appears to be more prevalent among Orange County thrifts than among 
S&amp;Ls elsewhere in the state. Of seven Southern California thrift failures 
deemed top-priority cases by the FBI and regulators, four are based in Orange 
County. In addition, the FBI is looking into wrongdoing at six other county 
thrifts, at the least. 
</P>
<P>
There are 25 thrifts in the county still in private hands. Regulators control 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine -- one of the nation's biggest failures -- 
and Charter Savings Bank in Newport Beach. In addition, New West Federal 
Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine is a self-liquidating thrift created to sell off 
the bad assets of American Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, more than 800 thrifts have failed since 1980, and about 500 of 
those were put in the hands of the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency 
that manages and liquidates failed thrifts. Hundreds of other S&amp;Ls have 
been absorbed by mergers and acquisitions in either friendly deals or 
arrangements forced by regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The part of the industry still privately owned now numbers 2,404 institutions, 
about 40% of its peak size in 1980, according to the Office of Thrift 
Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
S &amp; L RESOLUTION COSTS 
</P>
<P>
The cost of resolving -- selling, consolidating or liquidating -- failed 
savings and loan institutions in Orange County has already cost the federal 
government an estimated $4.5 billion. The total does not include costs related 
to the failures of Charter Savings Bank in Newport Beach and Lincoln Savings 
&amp; Loan in Irvine, whose resolutions are still pending. The bailout of 
Lincoln alone is expected to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion.

CLOTHESTIME, CITING SLOWDOWN, POSTS $83,000 LOSS IN 3RD QUARTER

<P>
Blaming the economic slowdown that has gripped the retail fashion industry, 
Clothestime Inc. reported losses Tuesday of $83,000 for its third quarter ended 
Oct. 27, contrasted with year-earlier earnings of $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 383-store discount women's clothing chain said sales for the latest quarter 
were $48.6 million, down slightly from $48.8 million for the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim-based Clothestime is "feeling some of the pressure of what is 
considered a more difficult retailing environment," said Amy Ludwig, a company 
spokeswoman. She said the retailer marked down merchandise because of slow 
sales during the quarter in order to make room for newer fashion lines. 
</P>
<P>
David Sejpal, Clothestime's chief financial officer, said a shift to a new 
strategy of offering lower-priced merchandise during the past 10 weeks should 
pay off in increased sales in the next six months to a year. 
</P>
<P>
Besides cutting prices on its merchandise, Clothestime has also been slashing 
inventories. Sejpal said the average store reduced inventory to $60,000 during 
the third quarter, down from about $100,000 a year ago. He said the retailer is 
also buying more discontinued fashion lines that can be offered at lower prices 
than those of competing retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, an investment group that included the chairman and president of 
Clothestime's advertising agency said it had acquired a 6.3% stake in the 
retailer. Jack Roth, president of Admarketing Inc. in Los Angeles, said the 
group considered the stock a good buy.

MAZDA SHOPPING FOR AD AGENCY FOR UPSCALE LINE;

<P>
Mazda Motors of America has begun shopping for an advertising agency to handle 
marketing chores for a new upscale car line to go up against Toyota's Lexus and 
Nissan's Infiniti, industry sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the new car line -- being planned at Mazda's Irvine headquarters 
under the code name of the Pegasus Group -- is only a feasibility study. 
</P>
<P>
But one source said Mazda is expected to announce a final decision on the U.S. 
launch of Pegasus next year, possibly as early as the Chicago Auto Show in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
Mazda officials could not be reached Tuesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
But sources that have been briefed by Mazda said the U.S. importer interviewed 
five advertising agencies in Irvine last week, including Foote, Cone &amp; 
Belding/Santa Ana -- the agency that handles the rest of Mazda's domestic 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
And Adweek magazine, a trade journal, has reported that at least three other 
agencies, two in New York and one in Dallas, are in the running. Adweek 
estimates that the Pegasus account could be worth up to $75 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Pegasus team reportedly is discussing a three-car line, to be sold in 
separate showrooms, that would include a full-size V-12 sedan, a V-8 coupe 
about the size of the current Mazda 929 and a V-6 sedan based on the Mazda 626. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview earlier this year, Clark Vitulli, senior vice president of 
Mazda Motors of America, said the company is intent on upgrading its image in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The intent is to build world-class, unique, specialty products. Not cars that 
will be liked by everyone, but cars that will be loved by certain people," 
Vitulli said. The former Chrysler Corp. executive had been in charge of 
marketing Chrysler's luxury line before joining Mazda in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question but that Mazda has the products under development" in 
Japan, said David Hillburn, president of Hillburn &amp; Associates, a Los 
Angeles automotive market planning firm. "So if and when Mazda decides to enter 
the luxury market, they are well-positioned to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
While the Pegasus line would be Mazda's first new car line in the United 
States, the Japanese auto maker has maintained a separate upscale brand -- 
called Eunos -- in Japan for several years. 
</P>
<P>
One source said Mazda Motors of America already has selected territories for 
Pegasus dealerships and that dealers will be required to build separate 
showrooms but will be allowed to use existing service facilities.

<TEXT>
<P>
A Siemens Information Systems division with operations here has merged with a 
unit of Colorado-based Storage Technology Corp., the companies said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Siemens division, a unit of the German electronics giant Siemens A.G., 
manufactures high-speed printers designed for use with large computers. 
</P>
<P>
It employs about 400 people, including 70 in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
No layoffs or large employee relocations are expected when the Siemens unit is 
merged with a Storage Technology printer operation in Louisville, Colo., said 
Alice Andors, a Siemens spokeswoman. The merged company will have dual 
headquarters in Tustin and Boca Raton, Fla., where the Siemens division is 
based. 
</P>
<P>
The companies plan to form a new company to be 51%-owned by Siemens Nixdorf 
Information Systems Inc. and 49% by Storage Technology. Joint operations are 
expected to begin in January. 
</P>
<P>
The new company will have estimated annual revenue of more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
H. Werner Krause, president and chief executive of Siemens Information Systems, 
will be president and chief executive of the new company. 
</P>
<P>
"Both Siemens and StorageTek have been very successful in the U.S. high-speed 
printer marketplace, and joining our operations will make us clearly the third 
force in the United States," Krause said. "Our companies have a longstanding 
relationship, and we share the philosophy that to best meet the needs of the 
market, you need to specialize." 
</P>
<P>
The company will make printers for large mainframe computers that can print out 
documents at speeds of up to 206 pages per minute. The new venture's main 
competitors would be International Business Machines Corp. and Xerox Corp.

Say farewell to megadeals such as last year's record-setting $25-billion buyout 
of RJR Nabisco. 
</P>
<P>
For the next few years, experts say, mergers will be smaller, strategically 
motivated and done almost solely by companies with strong balance sheets. 
</P>
<P>
"The merger movement is not dead; it's just hunkering down," said Samuel Hayes, 
professor of investment banking at the Harvard Business School. 
</P>
<P>
The value of U.S. mergers plunged to $185.9 billion in the first 10 months of 
1990 from $373.4 billion in the same period of 1989, IDD Information Services 
says. 
</P>
<P>
While some large deals are being discussed, those actually announced this year 
have tended to be small, especially when compared to some of the big 1980s 
takeovers.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ian Schrager has seen the future of New York night life, and it is . . . 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The onetime nightclub impresario who, with his late partner Steve Rubell, 
created Studio 54, the decadent disco den of the '70s, and Palladium, the 
supermarket-sized dance palace of the '80s, has now set his sights on hotels as 
the place to see and be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, one hotel in particular -- his latest venture, the Paramount. Already 
owners of two mid-town Manhattan hotels, Morgans and the Royalton, Schrager and 
Rubell bought the old Century Paramount on West 46th Street just off Broadway 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The name was chopped in half, iconoclastic French designer Philippe Starck was 
hired to do the post-modern interiors and in August it opened, offering rooms 
starting at $90 a night -- an amazing bargain for a new, stylish mid-town 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
But it's what Schrager has yet to add to the 610-room hotel that will likely 
cause the hip trendies to take notice: a nightclub run by French nightclub 
owner Huberts of Le Bain Douche, a Brian McNally restaurant (he of the 
fashionable eateries 150 Wooster and The Canal Bar) and a Dean &amp; DeLuca 
gourmet shop. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really an attempt to blur the distinction between restaurants, 
nightclubs, health spas, coffee shops and delicatessens," says the intense, 
compact Schrager. "It's redefining public space and how we spend our leisure 
time, really reinventing all of that, so that this is meant to be more than a 
place to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
None of Schrager and Rubell's hotels were ever meant to be just a place to 
sleep. They opened Morgans in 1983, had French designer Andree Putman do the 
minimalist interiors and watched it quickly become the hotel/hangout for rock 
stars, actors and other ultra-cool types passing through town. 
</P>
<P>
The Royalton, also designed by Starck and opened two years ago, fast acquired 
its own cachet, with the bar and restaurant known as the place to see and be 
seen. Both offer rooms starting at $190 a night. 
</P>
<P>
Their success as hoteliers came after both spent brief stints in prison for tax 
evasion during the Studio 54 days in 1980 and 1981. They became New York's 
comeback kids, their contacts with the city's glitterati intact, their names 
still associated with nouveau glamour and cutting-edge chic. 
</P>
<P>
Rubell's death in July, 1989, at age 45 of complications from hepatitis was a 
devastating blow to his friend and partner. The two were an inseparable 
yin-yang team -- Rubell the outgoing schmoozer, Schrager the more introverted 
partner who took care of business. 
</P>
<P>
The Paramount, Schrager's first solo venture, is arguably New York's most 
talked-about new hotel, currently the darling of design magazine editors who 
gush over its innovative use of marble, concrete and curvaceous, sensuous 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
There's a children's play room designed by "Pee-Wee's Playhouse" design 
director Gary Panter. The lobby boasts a fun-house mirror. Elevators are bathed 
in emerald, ruby, amber or indigo lights and the rooms sport stainless-steel 
conical sinks. 
</P>
<P>
The cleaning crew resembles black-capped Maoists. The staff wears black 
double-breasted suits and white T-shirts. Hired from "casting calls," they are 
chosen not because they have experience in hotel work (Schrager prefers that 
they don't), but, he says, because of their look (quirky beauty and elegance) 
and "that thing in people that makes them enjoy making other people better." 
</P>
<P>
Said one bemused guest, "It's like living in an Obsession ad." 
</P>
<P>
Schrager hears that and chuckles, but he's obviously pleased with the image. He 
sits in the hotel's second-floor restaurant/bar dressed in a white shirt and 
navy pants, lamenting the fact that New Yorkers don't frequent hotels the way 
Angelenos do deals at the Beverly Hills Hotel's Polo Lounge, or Parisians do 
lunch at the Plaza Athenee. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-five years ago when New York hotels had great entertainment, (people) 
went," he said. "But the entertainers started appearing in Vegas, and that 
stopped. The Royalton was an effort to get that going again. And this is trying 
to do it even more." 
</P>
<P>
He's a man who doesn't believe in marketing research, who'd rather let 
intuition guide him in business decisions. Lately intuition has been telling 
him that New Yorkers "want something; there's a mood in the air. We don't tell 
people what they want, they tell us. (Schrager frequently uses "we" when 
referring to himself and Rubell.) If you come to a hotel, you want to go to the 
restaurant where everyone in New York is going. Doesn't it make sense that the 
restaurant would be in this hotel? And doesn't it make sense that when you come 
to New York that the best nightclub also be in the hotel?" 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, New York has seen its night life evolve from underground clubs 
to intimate supper clubs, the restaurants-as-theater trend and, currently, a 
retro flashback to '70s-style mega-discos. 
</P>
<P>
Schrager's current take on the city's night life is that "it lacks direction. 
It lacks focus, energy. There are a lot of problems, unfortunately, that come 
with nightclubs -- the drugs, the traffic, and I think the politicians have 
been dealing with the problem by making it more difficult to open up 
nightclubs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're essential. . . . I went around to a bunch of clubs last Friday 
and there's no glamour, there's no mix of people. It troubles me a little bit. 
I would like to get night life jump-started, with Brian McNally and Huberts and 
what we hope to have here with this great big living room, this great big 
salon. It doesn't take much to get a momentum going." 
</P>
<P>
Schrager orders an espresso and takes exactly one sip in the course of an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Does he miss the nightclub business? 
</P>
<P>
"No," he says quickly. "The nightclub business did well for Steve and me, but 
basically it taught us a number of things that prepared us for the hotel 
business. We learned to create magic, because you really don't have anything 
but the magic. We're still trying to create magic here, the only thing is that 
we have a product. . . . But the way I think about the nightclub business is a 
little bit the way I think about high school. It was great, I have fond 
memories of it, but it's over with and I have no desire to be in it." 
</P>
<P>
Nor does he have any desire to have doormen acting as the high priests of the 
velvet ropes, re-creating the imperious door policy that was part of Studio 
54's allure. 
</P>
<P>
"I want something with longevity," Schrager says. "I'm not interested in having 
lines outside to come in. That's over with. People won't take it. I'm 44 years 
old and I'm really not interested in that thing myself anymore. I don't think 
it will be wild and abandoned and indulgent, I think it'll be a little more 
civil, somewhere between what's going on in a salon, in a gallery opening, 
perhaps a cocktail party." 
</P>
<P>
Schrager is well aware that the club could be a white-hot success one minute, a 
has-been, B-list nightspot the next. Already the hotel itself is generating 
enough press to be doing warp speed toward over-hype, and he's thought about 
what the fallout could be. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it'll be a club with nothing but magic. . . . What we're trying 
to do is bring in products that last," he says. "Like if you have good food, 
like the Copacabana had in the '40s. If you have really intelligent, hip 
entertainment policy that doesn't necessarily mean big-name entertainers. It 
will last because you're providing a service to people. People need places to 
go out to." 
</P>
<P>
He calls the hotel a "friendly oasis" where the concierge can guide you to the 
kind of restaurant where you'd feel comfortable, where you can trade workout 
tips with the bellman, who looks like an Armani model. 
</P>
<P>
But behind the new and improved egalitarian Schrager lurks a glimmer of the old 
days. You glimpse it when you ask about why there is no "Paramount" sign 
outside the hotel. In fact, there is nothing marking its existence save two 
clay flower pots placed just outside the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't put the name outside because I still feel that if you don't know 
where the hotel is, you shouldn't be here," he explains. "I don't mean it in an 
arrogant way. The only reason to have a light or something is to mark the spot. 
But you don't have to say 'Paramount.' " 
</P>
<P>
And what about the guests hanging out in the lobby wearing Bermuda shorts, dark 
socks and sandals who look like tourists just plucked from Central Casting? 
</P>
<P>
"I call them Norman Rockwell people," he confesses. "I want people who come 
here to appreciate what we did. And some of the people here right now, they 
wouldn't care if I didn't even let them in the lobby, they want their room at 
the low price. . . . I want the same people who go to Morgans and the Royalton; 
fashion people, entertainment people, a big bicoastal crowd, Europeans. For 
people who are used to spending $100 at Howard Johnson, I didn't make this 
effort for them. It's making style accessible to people (who appreciate it). I 
think it's such a modern thing to do that. It's in the air now." 
</P>
<P>
Brian McNally, who has yet to decide just what kind of restaurant he'll open at 
the Paramount, applauds the hotel's hodgepodge of clientele. 
</P>
<P>
"I think New York needs that kind of thing," he says. "It's sort of fragmented 
and polarized to a certain extent. People who wear leather jackets go to one 
place, and people who wear blue shoes go to another. A hotel is the only place 
where you see people coming in, and that's a very nice thing. You can't 
re-create Dorothy Parker. Those people don't exist anymore. But there should be 
a natural place for people to meet. 
</P>
<P>
"And there's nothing wrong with Norman Rockwell types," he says. "If you make 
the hotel exclusive, it doesn't work. You should never have to worry about 
who's at the next table; why not just go there and have a good time?"

New York night-life habitues and scene-watchers pretty much agree that Schrager 
has yet another hit on his hands, but wonder whether he'll able to sustain its 
chichi status. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Ian Schrager's brilliant when it comes to creating atmosphere, which 
is what New Yorkers are pretty much into," says social observer Jonathan Van 
Meter. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on what you seek in night life, whether you enjoy that or not. 
There are definitely enough people here who like that stark, dramatic 
post-modern thing that Philippe Starck did. It really draws a crowd. . . . It's 
a beautiful crowd, almost painfully chic. It's the perfect backdrop for people 
to be in, making deals and being glamorous. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that might save it from being a flash in the pan is that it is a 
design and architectural wonder. Maybe it'll develop into a Four Seasons kind 
of thing, a power place. As a trendy night-life spot, I don't think anything 
has staying power anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Schrager name still carries clout, Van Meter says. 
</P>
<P>
"When you hear that name is attached to something, it pricks up your ears and 
makes you want to check it out. It's a respect he gets. There are a handful of 
people in New York -- McNally is one of them, Schrager is another -- sort of 
impresarios, and anything these people do, they have staying power."

IN-LAWS CAN PUT FAMILIES TO TEST AT HOLIDAY TIME; 
</P>
<P>
RELATIONS: WHERE TO SPEND THANKSGIVING: MY FAMILY OR YOURS? RATHER THAN CHOOSE,

Carla Smith always enjoys the Thanksgivings that she and her husband, Joe, 
spend at her parents' home in Whittier. For her, it's a warm and festive 
occasion where she can be with her brother and sister and her six nieces and 
nephews. 
</P>
<P>
But the Newport Beach woman is not looking forward to Thanksgiving this year: 
She'll once again be spending it at her in-laws' home in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I sort of resent it," said Smith, 32. "I enjoy my husband's family, 
but I just like being home at Thanksgiving. My mother-in-law is getting up in 
years and she doesn't really care to cook any longer. Last year, they just 
bought a turkey at the store that was already prepared. Thanksgiving, to me, is 
always a fun time at my parents' home because everything's home-made and it's 
just a nice, warm, fun time." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who asked that her real name not be used, laughed nervously. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm bashing my in-laws," she said. "I don't mean to. I just don't 
feel as close or as comfortable with his parents as I obviously do with mine." 
</P>
<P>
Smith is not the only in-law who feels torn during the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
For many couples, the dilemma of which set of parents to spend Thanksgiving or 
Christmas with is an annual crisis, one that can strain even the best of 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Mickie Shapiro, a Costa Mesa marriage, family and child therapist, said she has 
several clients who get sick every year at Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
"Even knowing they're going to get sick doesn't stop them," Shapiro said. "The 
reason they get sick is because there's such a pull to be with their own 
parents. The way to avoid it is to get sick and not go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Christmas is no different. Shapiro said several clients have attempted to solve 
the dilemma by visiting one set of in-laws on Christmas eve and the other on 
Christmas morning. But even that isn't the ideal solution. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't look forward to the holiday, " Shapiro explained. "They just say 
they're so stressed out and exhausted." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago psychotherapist Leah Shifrin Averick, the author of a book on in-law 
relations, says it's natural for parents to want their children present on 
holidays. But both sets of parents often demand equal time with the young 
couple, or the couple feels that they should spend equal time with each set of 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Averick said parents often don't realize the difficulties that their married 
children experience in trying to balance loyalties to their parents as well as 
to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
One woman interviewed by Averick for her book, "How Inlaws Relate," attempted 
to solve the problem by having two Thanksgiving dinners, one with each set of 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
"It was," the woman said, "like a tug of war and we were the rope." 
</P>
<P>
Such tugging, therapists say, can lead to frustration, resentment and anger. 
</P>
<P>
"Some parents can be really controlling and they can create tremendous pressure 
and pain during the holidays. They make the younger adults feel guilty," said 
Jerry Deming, director of the Marriage and Family Counseling Center of Orange 
County in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente psychotherapist Bobbi Nesheim says: "Whenever you move into any 
holiday or special time in your life with anger and frustration it's not going 
to work out. The best thing you can do is take a look at what is causing your 
frustration and then negotiate: 'What can we do about it? What do we really 
want out of this?' " 
</P>
<P>
Even in the best of circumstances, Averick said, parents and their married 
children often have unrealistic expectations of holiday get-togethers. And it's 
when the fantasy clashes with reality that there is tension. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, when there is tension and difficulty, I think it's because the child 
-- the son, for example -- is hoping mom is going to make his favorite apple 
pie, or that dad will play golf with him," Averick suggested. "He doesn't 
realize mama is tired and maybe has a job now and doesn't have time to make his 
favorite apple pie. And dad has arthritis and can't play golf like he used to. 
So then there are disappointments when a child goes back home." 
</P>
<P>
And while a son may have unrealistic expectations about visiting his parents on 
the holidays, Averick said, "along comes a daughter-in-law who has no fantasies 
about these people and no old wishes, dreams and hopes of being with them. 
</P>
<P>
"She'd rather be around her own family, where she was nurtured and loved and 
admired so much. And the daughter-in-law gets bored with the family history and 
whatever tales we have. It's not so much fun for her and she might feel 
excluded." 
</P>
<P>
Matters are made even worse if there is underlying tension between, say, a 
daughter-in-law and mother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
"How does this critical, stereotypical person you resent turn into a charming, 
wonderful, tolerant grandparent? And does she?" Averick asked. "And what's it 
like even from the viewpoint of the grandchildren if you go to a grandmother 
you know your mother doesn't like?" 
</P>
<P>
There are, Averick said, "all kinds of clashing wishes and realities that are 
in juxtaposition with one another. And that's why holidays are often so 
disappointing instead of so satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
So what's a family to do? 
</P>
<P>
"If you're forewarned about these things -- if you know what to expect -- then 
you can handle things better," Averick advised. "You're not going back to what 
it used to be, you're going back to what it is now." 
</P>
<P>
So instead of saying, "Mom's going to take care of me and my children while 
we're visiting," Averick suggests instead saying, "Mom is older and too tired 
to take care of us; I better plan to help when I go back home." 
</P>
<P>
And instead of assuming that mom and dad will still have your old toys for your 
children to play with, have your children bring their own toys. And, Averick 
said, parents should be informed ahead of time if your kids like Cheerios or 
something special for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Older parents and in-laws have their own expectations for the holidays. While 
they are thrilled to have their son or daughter back home, Averick said, they 
also may be concerned about what the grandchildren will do to their new 
carpeting and drapes: Who is going to mind the kids and remind them not to put 
their sticky fingers on grandma's new curtains? 
</P>
<P>
That, too, should be determined ahead of time, Averick said. 
</P>
<P>
Families also should discuss how they're going to spend the day. The parents 
may want their children and grandchildren to spend the entire day with them, 
but their children may prefer to visit old friends or go to a movie after 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"If you spell out what you need and want ahead of time, the visit can be 
pleasant," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And what if the daughter-in-law, for example, just doesn't like her mother-in 
law, or vice versa? 
</P>
<P>
"Usually," Averick said, "when they don't like each other, it's because there 
have been some hurt feelings, or people forgetting to say thank you after all 
this effort that has been extended. This 'thank you' is sort of forgotten in 
our culture." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone, Averick emphasized, needs to feel important and appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
"If they say, 'Gee, mom, it's been so nice, all these goodies you've provided 
for us,' the mother or mother-in-law is thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
At her fourth son's wedding a year ago, Averick's new daughter-in-law took her 
aside and said, "Thank you so much for Benjie." 
</P>
<P>
"I still get a shiver," Averick said. "I feel so warm toward that woman. She 
acknowledged my importance, my function as a mother, my contribution to her 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Averick said, thank-yous should be extended at some point during the 
day to everyone seated around the holiday dinner table: To mom, who cooked the 
meal; to dad, who may have provided airline tickets for his son and family; to 
the daughter-in-law, who brought the lovely flower arrangement; to the son, who 
took time out of his schedule to be with his parents, and the little 
grandchild, who made a drawing for her grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
"If everybody has been acknowledged," Averick said, "everyone's feeling good 
around the table, feeling good because they appreciate each other." 
</P>
<P>
As for the dilemma of which set of parents to holiday with, Averick offers 
these suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
* Parents must remember that their children cannot be in two places at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
* "Don't put unreasonable pressure on your children to spend time with you," 
she said, "Respect the couple's decision if they choose not to accept your 
invitation to visit." 
</P>
<P>
Parents of married children, she added, must realize that their parenting role 
is not the same as before: "You can make the same demands, but it's 
inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
For adult children, Averick advises this: "If you cannot or do not want to 
accept your parents' invitations, don't be evasive, but tell them as soon as 
possible. Hopefully, your parents will understand and respect your decision." 
</P>
<P>
Averick said the young couple should first decide among themselves where it 
will be most comfortable, convenient and pleasant for them to spend the 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"Then you go back and he tells his parents and she tells her parents," she 
said, explaining: "Parents are able to forgive their own child no matter what 
he does. Even if they get angry, the parent-child love ties are still there."

COSTNER BRINGS A CLEAR EYE TO EPIC 'WOLVES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kevin Costner opens his stirringly fine "Dances With Wolves" (throughout San 
Diego County) by pitching us without prologue or apology into the thick of 
character and action. 
</P>
<P>
Costner's Lt. John Dunbar, a wounded Union officer, is next in line to have his 
foot sawed off at a Tennessee field hospital; preferring to die intact rather 
than mutilated, he steals back to his men. Nearly hallucinating, he chooses 
death by galloping between the stalemated Union and Confederate troops, drawing 
rebel fire and ending his pain. 
</P>
<P>
During his final, full-tilt charge, muttering, "Father, forgive me," Dunbar 
drops his reins and throws his arms up and out, looking like a circus rider or 
a Christ figure, or both. It's a marvelous moment of cinema, but a dangerously 
risky one when the star is also the director, and a first-time director at 
that. It practically invites the professionally cool in the audience to drawl, 
"Well, who does he think he is?" 
</P>
<P>
Yet played off against Dunbar's incredulous entry in his journal, "In trying to 
produce my own death, I became a living hero," the moment carries exactly the 
aura of half-mad heroism it's supposed to. Quite clearly, Costner knows exactly 
who he is, what he is doing, and how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
He may have studied the way Akira Kurosawa splits his screen with a horizon 
line or sets a character a little off-center in the vastness of a plain; there 
are movements of cottonwoods and buffalo grass that may recall "Dersu Uzala," 
and figures against a flaming sunset that bring back "Kagemusha," but there are 
far worse directors to study if one is starting out. 
</P>
<P>
"Dances With Wolves" is a clear-eyed vision. Authentic as an Edward Curtis 
photograph, lyrical as a George Catlin oil or a Karl Bodmer landscape, this is 
a film with a pure ring to it. It's impossible to call it anything but epic, 
not with scenes like the ground-shaking buffalo hunt, photographed with the 
camera moving at the same breakneck speed as the buffalo, while Dunbar and the 
young Sioux maneuver among them. The work of the buffalo-hunt camera crew is 
extraordinary, supplementing Dean Semler's painterly cinematography overall. 
</P>
<P>
Yet somehow, because the film's screenplay, by Michael Blake, concerns itself 
with character, not spectacle, its epic quality is engaging, frequently 
punctuated with gutsy humor, never self-congratulatory. Considering the scope 
and the ambitiousness of the material, the success of Costner and every one of 
his team seems monumental. (The film is rated PG-13 for its violence and brief, 
discreet nudity.) 
</P>
<P>
With his act of suicide seen as reckless bravery, Dunbar, not dead and not 
footless, is rewarded with any post he wishes. He asks simply for the frontier 
and is dumped at South Dakota's Ft. Sedgewick with a wagonload of supplies. The 
eerily deserted fort is two crumbling sod huts and a broken-down corral on a 
treeless plain. There's nothing around for miles, nothing but duty to keep 
Dunbar there and only his smart horse, Cisco, and a canny wolf for company. And 
though he doesn't know it, two deaths have obliterated any official knowledge 
of his existence out there. 
</P>
<P>
It's clear from Dunbar's first night that man and country suit each other. The 
screenplay may not spell out precisely why, but Costner is good at suggesting a 
deep, settling-in quality to the reckless Dunbar, jumpy but unafraid out here 
under an orange Dakota moon. 
</P>
<P>
A poker-faced stickler for regulations, Dunbar assigns himself clean-up duty, 
carries on dry conversations with Cisco, names and tames his wolf, Two Socks, 
records his impressions in his journal. And slowly, we come to the essence of 
this thoughtful, complex man, his character leavened by just enough goofiness 
to balance his undeniably heroic streak. After seeing these facets in earlier 
Costner films, solidity without dullness, uninsistent manliness, a measured 
watchfulness, one might suspect that the Dunbar/Costner fit, as tailored to him 
by his friend and screenwriter Blake, is pretty close. If so, Costner's moments 
undercutting his own image are especially charming. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in a hilarious cross-cultural encounter, the solitary lieutenant is 
discovered by his Sioux neighbors. After this confrontation, the filmmakers 
have made absolute magic; curiosity replaces unease, each side tests the other 
gravely and is not disillusioned. Dunbar, fascinated, begins to learn something 
about the character of the Sioux people, tactfully teaching us at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
As the Sioux come alive, a handful stand out: Kicking Bird (Graham Greene), the 
tribe's holy man, his hair like a falcon's top-knot; the hotly combative Wind 
in His Hair (Rodney A. Grant); tribal leader Ten Bears (singer Floyd Red Crow 
Westerman), masterly at imposing his knowledge without appearing to, and young 
Smiles a Lot (Nathan Lee Chasing His Horse), witness to the best and worst in 
the white strangers. They are a collection of exceptional talents. 
</P>
<P>
In a bow to Western movie tradition, there's also the luminous-eyed Stands With 
a Fist (Mary McDonnell), the white-child-raised-by-the-tribe, who moves from 
mourning widow to reluctant translator to the woman Dunbar loves. Since these 
people so clearly possess the values and qualities Dunbar has instinctively 
been drawn to -- only heightened and refined -- the dawning knowledge of where 
he truly belongs emerges. 
</P>
<P>
One might remark on the even disposition of every soul in this huge encampment. 
The natural dangers of their lives aside, these people really have a good day, 
every day. It's the Pawnee who are the movie's "bad Indians." In the same 
crabby vein, one might question why there's no other Army man who shares 
Dunbar's humanity, or even curiosity. But as a student of the period remarked, 
the West wasn't settled by humanitarians. 
</P>
<P>
Dunbar is given his name Dances With Wolves after a singularly unbuttoned 
moment, not unlike the one in "Lawrence of Arabia" as Lawrence runs preeningly 
in his floating white robes, only to find to his mortification that he's being 
watched by an Arab stranger. More important is Dunbar's ecstatic private dance 
at his own campfire -- done with the sort of rapture Lawrence would understand 
-- marking just how far this authentic hero has moved from the stoic Western 
tradition. It is exactly in the path Kicking Bird has described: the trail of a 
true human being.

</P>
<P>
MINISERIES: DAVID BROWN'S ORCHESTRATION OF HIS WIFE'S SLAYING IN ANAHEIM HILLS 
IS BEING DRAMATIZED FOR TV. IT'S ABOUT THE DARK SIDE OF AMERICAN FAMILY LIFE, 
THE DIRECTOR SAYS.

<TEXT>
<P>
As the morning wears on, clouds thicken over the Karl Holton Camp for juvenile 
offenders, the sky darkens, the dreary concrete bungalows look even more drab. 
A chill wind picks up. The television crew pulls jackets tight. 
</P>
<P>
Things look bleak -- just as they should. Such gloom is ideal for "Love You to 
Death," the four-hour miniseries being filmed here about the bizarre David 
Brown murder case in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"The study of David Brown is a study of evil," director Robert Markowitz said 
Monday, two days before shooting was scheduled to finish. Filmed mostly around 
Los Angeles instead of on actual location and scheduled to air in February on 
NBC, the Republic Pictures production -- an analysis of "darkness and 
violence," in Markowitz's words -- essentially follows the story as it unfolded 
in the press. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985 Brown, a 37-year-old computer entrepreneur in Anaheim Hills, persuaded 
his devoted 14-year-old daughter, Cinnamon, to kill his fifth wife in her sleep 
with two shotgun blasts to her chest. While the girl sat mum in prison for 
nearly four years, Brown lived in opulence off his dead wife's life insurance. 
With him was his dead wife's teen-age sister, whom he persuaded to aid in the 
murder and then secretly married. 
</P>
<P>
After Cinnamon finally told police what had happened, Brown was sentenced in 
September in a Santa Ana courtroom to life in prison with no chance of parole 
for orchestrating the murder of Linda Bailey, 23. 
</P>
<P>
Several screenwriters monitored the trial. But miniseries writer Danielle Hill 
beat the competition when she saw a news blurb about the case early on and 
brought the idea to Republic. Rights were obtained and production began, with 
research based on news clips and audiotapes of testimony. Some of the script's 
dialogue is taken directly from the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
The judge who sentenced Brown called him a "master manipulator" more 
frightening than Charles Manson. But Markowitz, who has directed several TV 
dramas based on real events, shuns that comparison. 
</P>
<P>
"Love You to Death" (a working title) is not the story of a deranged cult 
leader who consciously set himself and his followers outside of mainstream 
society, Markowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a film really about the American family," he said. "If you saw these 
people in Topanga Plaza, you'd never know they were any different from anyone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a vein running through American culture which is filled with 
darkness and violence. We used to refer to (people like Brown) as aberrant. But 
now, a child a week is being killed or abused by members of their families, 
children are being shot in their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
"This film is about the black side of the American dream. This is not the 
Manson family. Yes, there's an element of brainwashing here. But this was not a 
cult." 
</P>
<P>
Long before Cinnamon and Brown's sixth wife, Patti Bailey, became star 
witnesses against him, Brown manipulated them by telling them that "all 
families are like this," Markowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown preyed on the impressionable girls' vulnerability, he said. Bailey, who 
acted with her attorney as an adviser on the film, was the daughter of a single 
mother raising 11 children; she knew only poverty and family strife. Cinnamon 
knew no more. 
</P>
<P>
"They watched TV and wanted lots of things, and he got them for them, and he 
just closed off everything else," Markowitz said. "They were very obedient kids 
-- they did what he told them to do. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an enormous amount of that sort of thing going on in this country. Not 
every family has the potential for murder, but the question this film raises is 
how did we get here -- kids killing one parent under the instruction of 
another." 
</P>
<P>
The film does not try to answer the question, Markowitz said. But it does try 
to "explore the mechanism in which (Brown) was able to manipulate (the two 
women), and the climate in which he was able to do this horrible and violent 
deed. Everyone asks the question: 'How did he get them to do it?' At the end of 
the film, you'll be able to see how." 
</P>
<P>
To emphasize each character's average-American quality, producers didn't cast 
any big stars, though Sheryl Lee, who plays Patti Bailey, may be recognized 
from her role as Laura Palmer (and her twin cousin, Maddy) in the "Twin Peaks" 
TV series. 
</P>
<P>
And none of the principal actors looks deranged, crazed or exceptional in any 
way. Lee and Moira Kelly, who plays Cinnamon, may wear pained expressions, but 
each is cleareyed and fresh faced. There's nothing especially sinister about 
Clancy Brown, who has slightly crooked teeth and a paunch and who plays David 
Brown with a ready smile, even as his character perpetuated the twisted 
deception against his incarcerated daughter to keep himself out of prison. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing normal or healthy about this guy," Clancy Brown said. Yet, 
many of the situations in which he is seen -- a shopping trip, a rancorous 
Christmas gathering -- are typical. 
</P>
<P>
"Folks on the set come up to me," the actor said, "and say oh gosh, my dad said 
that to me, or my mom said that to me." 
</P>
<P>
To prepare for her role, Lee got to know Bailey, now 22, who like Cinnamon is 
serving time at California Youth Authority for her part in the crime and who is 
expected to be paroled.

 It was Robert Pilatus' and Fabrice Morvan's worst nightmare come true. There 
they were dancing and moving their lips in front of 15,000 fans. And the sound 
system broke down. The machine wouldn't say the word true and, like a scratched 
record, began to repeat the opening lyrics of the lip-syncing Milli Vanilli's 
"Girl You Know It's True." 
</P>
<P>
It was the title cut of one of the hottest pop albums of 1989. Seven million 
records sold. Videos. Cassettes. CDs. Concert appearances. Merchandising. A 
gold mine for two young dreadlocked break dancers, a German record producer 
with a knack for making hits, a huge German entertainment conglomerate and its 
New York-based U.S. label Arista Records. 
</P>
<P>
And it was all built on a lie that would come to bite them all 16 months later. 
</P>
<P>

 "I knew right then and there, it was the beginning of the end for Milli 
Vanilli," recalled Pilatus of the duo's appearance that July, 1989, night in 
Bristol, Conn. "When my voice got stuck in the computer, and it just kept 
repeating and repeating, I panicked. I didn't know what to do. I just ran off 
the stage." 
</P>
<P>
The humiliation that "Rob" Pilatus and "Fab" Morvan suffered that summer 
evening on the MTV Club Tour proved to be but a hint of problems to come. Those 
would reach a critical mass as the duo and their producer prepared to release 
songs from their new album, "Keep on Running," due out in January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Pilatus and Morvan insisted that they be allowed to sing on the new record -- 
something they hadn't done on the first. Producer Frank Farian, who owns the 
name Milli Vanilli, resisted but released in Europe early cuts from the album 
with Pilatus and Morvan on the cover. It's a collector's item now, for by the 
time the record is released in the United States, it will feature a different 
picture and, indeed, a different group altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Girl you know it's . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Words like embarrassment or sham or hoax were too mild. Milli Vanilli was a 
scandal fueled, like most scandals, with ambition, greed and mendacity. It was 
two minor talents manipulated and manipulating to the top rungs of show 
business. It was the record industry's myth-making machine built with a 
recording technology capable of deceit and operated by men who chose to 
deceive. And it was a public that was more impressed by image than talent, more 
accepting of appearances than demanding of the truth. 
</P>
<P>
"We sold our souls to the devil," Pilatus said during an exclusive two-hour 
interview over the weekend. He and his partner agreed to talk to The Times and 
tell their story. "We lied to our families and our friends. We let down our 
fans. We realize exactly what we did to achieve our success. We made some very 
big mistakes and we apologize." 
</P>
<P>
"Rob and I never meant for it to go this way," Morvan added. "Our producer 
tricked us. We signed contracts as singers but were never allowed to 
contribute. It was a nightmare. We were living a lie. The psychological 
pressure was very hard. It was like we were trapped in some golden prison." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Farian fired Pilatus and Morvan, and all three admitted that the duo 
never sang on their 7 million-selling "Girl You Know It's True" album nor at 
any of their other live concert performances -- a nearly three-year-old secret 
that has haunted every step of their careers. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences stripped Pilatus 
and Morvan of their 1989 best new artist Grammy, an award they won during a 
nationally televised program from the Shrine Auditorium in February. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the duo were relegated to their own special level of Hollywood 
hell, publicly defending -- or at least owning up to -- their roles in the 
album hoax and playing a tape to a news conference, trying to convince 
reporters and the public that they really can sing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can sing up to Pavarotti's high C," insisted voice coach Seth Riggs, who 
was brought in to address an unruly crowd of more than 100 reporters and 
photographers. "Not as well as Pavarotti, but they did do it." 
</P>
<P>
Girl you know it's . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Milli Vanilli fiasco has struck a nerve in the record industry. Pilatus 
and Morvan plus other sources close to the performers' camp allege that 
officials at New York-based Arista, parent company Bertelsmann Music Group 
(BMG) and Gallin Morey Associates -- one of Hollywood's leading talent agencies 
-- purposely misrepresented the pop act to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Pilatus and Morvan allege that Arista President Clive Davis and Sandy Gallin, 
the duo's manager, knew they did not sing on the album at least six months 
before the Grammy was awarded, but pressed on with marketing the music anyway. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the revelations, the group also faces class-action suits filed 
by disgruntled fans. An Oakland fan claims in an Alameda County Superior Court 
suit filed Monday that the duo and their record company of defrauded consumers 
"out of tens of millions of dollars." In San Diego, attorney Bill Lerach, an 
attorney who specializes in class-action lawsuits on behalf of disgruntled 
shareholders of large corporations, on Monday filed suit in Superior Court on 
behalf of two young Milli Vanilli fans in San Diego and Michigan. The 
class-action lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages for fans who purchased 
the group's records and attended their concerts. 
</P>
<P>
The Milli Vanilli saga begins on New Year's Day in 1988 when techno-whiz 
producer Frank Farian invited Pilatus and Morvan to his Frankfurt studio to 
listen to a demo of a new song he produced called "Girl You Know It's True." 
</P>
<P>
Pilatus and Morvan had developed a reputation as a sharp-dressing dance duo on 
the Munich club and fashion-show circuit. The two knew Farian to be one of 
Germany's most successful pop producers and hoped to contribute some background 
vocals to his upcoming projects. Pilatus said Farian had heard that they were 
"two guys who knew how to look right." 
</P>
<P>
"We got a call to come to his studio and we said, 'All right that's it,' " 
Pilatus recalled. "We were just dumb little kids, so we said, 'Let's go.' When 
we got to the studio, 'Girl You Know It's True' was just a demo and he asked us 
our opinion of it and if we could sing it and we said, 'Yeah, we could sing 
it.' And he said, 'Oh beautiful, I believe it, but next week we have shows to 
do, so don't worry, I'll make you into a millionaire.' " 
</P>
<P>
Farian has declined to discuss his relations with Pilatus and Morvan outside of 
his press conference last week in Germany and some written responses to 
questions put to him by The Times by fax. 
</P>
<P>
Farian's last U.S. success was in the mid-'70s, when he created the 
million-selling disco act Boney M. Farian sang solo on Boney M.'s first album, 
but after the record became a hit he hired four models from the West Indies to 
front the touring band. 
</P>
<P>
He saw an opportunity to repeat that successful formula in Pilatus and Morvan. 
</P>
<P>
Morvan, now 24, was born in the Caribbean island of Gaudeloupe and raised in 
Paris. Son of a German mother and American soldier, Pilatus, also 24, was 
adopted by a German couple and raised in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"We lived in the (housing) projects. We had no money. We wanted to be stars, 
that was our main reasons," Pilatus told Tuesday's packed news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Though he dabbled in modeling and deejaying, Pilatus' specialty was 
break-dancing. He was good enough to get invited to an international 
competition in 1984 in New York. During a short trip to Los Angeles that year 
he met Morvan, who was in town for a dance seminar at a disco. A former gymnast 
who injured a vertebra in a 1983 trampoline accident, Morvan took up dancing as 
therapy and turned into a club-crawling dance master. 
</P>
<P>
That Los Angeles meeting set the stage for the pair to hook up again in Munich, 
where they decided to work together as background singers. After adopting the 
name Milli Vanilli -- which they say means positive energy in Turkish -- the 
pair recorded an album for a small German label that sold just a few thousand 
records. 
</P>
<P>
The contract Pilatus and Morvan signed with Farian states that they were to 
perform on recordings and that Farian was obligated to record at least 10 songs 
per year with them. It is dated Jan. 1, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The final mix of "Girl" was finished by studio singers in March and April. By 
May, Pilatus and Morvan were in the middle of a non-stop promotion blitz 
through Spain, France and Italy, which lasted until September. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the single became successful in Germany, singer Charles Shaw 
-- a Dallas native studio singer who recorded the soft rap on the song -- began 
telling the European media he was the real rapper. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to avoid rumors in the German press over the lip-sync ruse, Rob and Fab 
left Munich and moved to London. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden it was like another world," Morvan said. "Tension all the 
time. You want to tell somebody but you can't. When you realize what you've 
done, it hits you like a hammer." 
</P>
<P>
During one live radio interview in London, the show's host demanded that they 
sing on the air to prove it was them. 
</P>
<P>
"The rumors were heavy right from the start," Pilatus said. "We would ask Frank 
when are we going to be allowed to give some input and he would say, 'Yeah, 
yeah, but right now we need you to go out and do promotion. Of course, you'll 
get to do it, just work with us.' That's how he strung us along." 
</P>
<P>
Farian released the second single "Baby Don't Forget My Number" and asked the 
duo to forge on. Carsten Heyne, former BMG marketing director and now the duo's 
manager, said Farian and BMG attempted to stop Pilatus and Morvan from seeking 
the advice of a manager, lawyer or agent. 
</P>
<P>
"The record company made sure that it was written on the back cover of the 
singles and the album that the vocals were by Robert and Fabrice," Heyne said. 
"The record company did this on purpose in order to avoid all the questions. So 
they could say to the media look at the cover. What does it say? But it was not 
the truth." 
</P>
<P>
By the time the "Girl" album was released in Europe in September, 1988, the duo 
were already locked into the myth. 
</P>
<P>
"After Frank released the album, he told us that it was too late to stop now," 
Pilatus said. "Because the single was such a big success, he said, 'Now you 
have to go through with it. I'll cover you guys. Nobody will find out.' He 
said, 'Here, I'll give you $20,000 advance money.' We never had a hit before, 
so we went along with it. We played with fire and now we know, but it's too 
late." 
</P>
<P>
By December, Pilatus and Morvan realized that Farian probably had no intention 
of ever allowing them to sing in the studio or on stage. In London, they began 
hearing rumors about what happened to former members of past Farian bands. 
</P>
<P>
Farian failed to return numerous phone calls, but, according to Associated 
Press, he said at a press conference last week that he was forced to go public 
with the revelations when Pilatus and Morvan demanded to sing on the follow-up 
to "Girl You Know It's True." 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'No. I don't go for that.' Sure, they have a voice, but that's not 
really what I want to use on my records," Farian said. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to the members of Boney M. and I asked myself why they were all so 
bitter," Pilatus said. "One still lives in the projects in Amsterdam. Frank 
earned millions with this group and yet there was so much negativity. It 
started to scare me." 
</P>
<P>
The "Girl You Know It's True" single was released in the U.S. at the end of 
January, 1989, and climbed the charts swiftly. After Arista released the album 
stateside in February, 1990, Pilatus and Morvan immediately sought out American 
management. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we realized what happened to Boney M., we wanted to come to the States," 
Pilatus said. "In Europe, artists just don't have the same protection they do 
over here." 
</P>
<P>
Former BMG marketing director Carsten Heyne, now the duo's manager, said nobody 
told Arista that Pilatus and Morvan didn't sing when the company signed on to 
distribute the product domestically. 
</P>
<P>
"When Arista first decided to release "Girl You Know It's True," it's possible 
that Arista didn't know about our handicapped situation," Heyne said. "But 
after they heard the rumors from Europe and after they heard the live TV show 
in February, everybody knew." 
</P>
<P>
Arista officials deny that they were ever informed about the lip-sync 
deception. Farian, the duo's producer, told The Times on Saturday that he never 
told Arista that Pilatus and Morvan did not sing on the record. 
</P>
<P>
Milli Vanilli's problems in the U.S. began after they turned down an appearance 
on the "Arsenio Hall Show" in April. Hall requires artists to perform live. 
Pilatus, Morvan and their camp were concerned about them appearing. They never 
did appear on the show. 
</P>
<P>
On April 29, 1989, Milli Vanilli signed a contract with Gallin Morey Associates 
to represent them and the duo moved into their Beverly Hills home on June 11. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought because Sandy Gallin was one of the top Hollywood agents he would 
protect us and help us win our right to sing on the next tour and album," 
Pilatus said. 
</P>
<P>
By July, the duo requested to stop doing interviews after suspicions about 
their thick European accents arose in the American press. Throughout the 
summer, Milli Vanilli toured the United States as part of the Club MTV Tour. 
According to Pilatus, all requests for the duo to take singing lessons were 
denied, as were requests to sing on tour. 
</P>
<P>
According to Pilatus and memos obtained by The Times, Farian tried to block the 
duo's efforts to tour. A battle broke out between the performer and their 
producer on Jan. 16, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Between January and September, Pilatus and Morvan's attorneys sent more than 
two dozen letters to Farian, demanding that the duo be allowed to sing on their 
upcoming album. Arista's Davis was notified of the battle for vocal control on 
Jan. 18. Alan Mintz, the duo's attorney, alleges that Davis became aware that 
Pilatus and Morvan were demanding to sing in January. 
</P>
<P>
In a phone interview from New York on Tuesday, Arista's Roy Lott denied the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank Farian and Rob and Fab had a long and stormy relationship after the 
album was released involving many issues, but the principal one involved Rob 
and Fab's economic participation," Lott said. "It was their fight and Arista, 
as merely the U.S. distributor naturally never knew the details of their bitter 
negotiations. We simply understood this statement to mean what it said. That 
Rob and Fab had finally decided to agree to work with Frank Farian again." 
</P>
<P>
"If there is an elephant standing in the room," Mintz said. "It's so big and 
it's so obvious and everybody can see it, that nobody ever has to say 'Hey 
there's an elephant standing in the room.' " 
</P>
<P>
Pilatus and Morvan enraged rock critics last February when they were quoted 
boasting to Time magazine that their contribution to pop music exceeded that of 
Bob Dylan's, Paul McCartney's and Mick Jagger's. 
</P>
<P>
Pilatus insisted that the reporter must have misunderstood him due to Pilatus' 
poor grasp of the language. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in shock when I read it," Pilatus said. "I am a fan of Mick Jagger and 
the Stones. I mean I knew I wasn't singing, so why would I ever criticize the 
Beatles. All I said was that Elvis was a big idol in his time and we were big 
in ours." 
</P>
<P>
Headlee maintains he argued with officials at Arista and Gallin Morey to allow 
the duo to appear on "Good Morning America" to explain that their quotes were 
taken out of context. Arista's Davis requested to accompany the Millis during 
their interview, but was shut out by the television show's staff, Headlee said. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that the "Good Morning America" spot did little to diminish negative 
press in the Milli camp, Headlee says that officials at Gallin Morey and Arista 
contacted Farian to manufacture a phony studio-produced medley of Beatles, 
Dylan and Stones tunes to lip-sync on their American concert tour. Documents 
obtained by The Times confirm that Farian was in communication with Gallin 
Morey regarding production of the medley. 
</P>
<P>
"I warned Sandy Gallin, I advised him that if we did this medley that we would 
be digging ourselves into an even bigger pit," Headlee said. "I felt that we 
would be opening ourselves up to allegations that we were trying to perpetrate 
this hoax even farther." 
</P>
<P>
The medley concept was dropped after Pilatus and Morvan refused to participate 
in the scam. Gallin could not be reached for comment and did not return 
repeated phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
In May, negotiations between Mintz and Farian in Frankfurt produced an oral 
agreement which would have allowed the duo to sing on their next album. But by 
June, contract talks had broken off and Farian refused to talk with anyone but 
Pilatus and Morvan. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the duo met with Farian in New York to cut a new deal. They were to 
receive advances for services rendered including video promotions and 
television shows. Under the deal, the duo were told that they would record lead 
vocals on the upcoming album in August in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
When they went to Frankfurt, Farian reneged on his promise, Mintz said. On Aug. 
13, Milli Vanilli fired Gallin Morey Associates. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 24, Farian debuted the new Milli Vanilli album at a listening party 
for various European record company officials in his Franfurt studio. The new 
album featured a female vocalist and an American street rapper in the lead 
vocals. Pilatus and Morvan protested the introduction of new voices into the 
Milli Vanilli fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
Mintz alleges that Arista's Davis demanded Farian recut the tracks with the 
former studio singers. Mintz also says that Farian wrote a letter to Davis 
confirming that he redid the session. Heyne quit BMG on Oct. 17 to become the 
duo's manager. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Pilatus and Morvan called for a meeting between Clive Davis, 
the president of BMG and Farian. Farian canceled the upcoming video shoot and a 
television promotional tour scheduled this month in Spain, the Netherlands and 
Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
Without the approval of Pilatus and Morvan, Farian released a new Milli Vanilli 
12-inch dance track this month in Europe called "Keep On Running." The record 
is already reportedly charting at No. 65 in Germany and No. 16 in the 
Netherlands. Attorneys for the duo are preparing papers demanding a recall of 
the single. They claim Farian is witholding royalty statements from the duo and 
are demanding to inspect Farian's books. A lawsuit may be in the works, 
according to Mintz. 
</P>
<P>
The new Milli Vanilli album that Farian was to release on Arista in January 
will come out under a different name. Pilatus and Morvan, who will participate 
in a 10 killometer race in San Francisco on Saturday, say they are courting 
offers from several well-known producers. 
</P>
<P>
But what about the 7 million fans they deceived? 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very sad about my fans," Pilatus said. I know it's going to be hard for 
the kids to stand behind us. But I hope they understand that we are just two 
human guys who were so hungry for success that we allowed ourselves to be 
manipulated. We wanted to get on the top. We apologize and hope they'll give us 
a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always wanted to sing," Morvan added. "We made the mistake ourselves, 
but it's true, we let our fans down. For them we are idols and they loved our 
videos and bought the records and we let them down. It's very hard, I know. I 
just hope they will forgive us."

CATCHING UP WITH 'THREE MEN'; 
</P>
<P>
THE SEQUEL TO THE 1987 HIT 'THREE MEN AND A BABY' TRIES HARD TO BE A CUTE FARCE 
BUT FALLS ON ITS FACE FOR LACK OF A PLOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Three Men and a Little Lady" (citywide) plays less like a comedy than an 
evening gone wrong. It's like a posh party where the high-profile guests, Tom 
Selleck, Steve Guttenberg and Ted Danson, show up, dragging along memories of 
their joint 1987 hit, "Three Men and a Baby," but no one figures out anything 
amusing for them to do. 
</P>
<P>
It's obvious what's on everybody's mind: They want a hit-by-association. But 
the plot shrivels up and goes daffy. The evening drags on, just like the failed 
bachelor bash that director Emile Ardolino stages halfway through. Pretty soon, 
it's gotten so deadly, everybody is sitting around talking about relationships 
or cracking smutty jokes -- discreetly, so the children won't be offended. 
</P>
<P>
"Three Men and a Baby" was like a comic PG rapprochement with the sexual 
revolution, a pay-back fantasy for post-'60s singles and families alike. A 
cutesy farce about three swinging Manhattan bachelors -- suddenly saddled with 
an abandoned infant and forced to cope with the daddyhood they'd avoided -- it 
was only a pale echo of the movie from which it was lifted, "Trois Hommes et un 
Couffin." The Cesar-winning French farce was really only a pastel murmur 
itself, but it had a certain symbolic force. 
</P>
<P>
It also had a major flaw, which all but sinks the sequel. Coline Serreau, who 
wrote and directed the original, knew her bachelors. At the end of "Trois 
Hommes," she kept them friendly but noncommittal. But the male writers of 
"Three Men and a Baby" went further, inviting mother and tot to move in with 
the threesome. 
</P>
<P>
If there was a preposterous undercurrent to "Baby" this movie bumbles far past 
it. Why would a highly successful Manhattan architect (Selleck), a nationally 
syndicated cartoonist (Guttenberg) and a failed actor (Danson) all be quartered 
together in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, they're all still housemates: Mom, little lady and the 
lovable bachelor buddies. They've even moved into a more spacious, homier 
brownstone. But their lives haven't changed. No one is married; all amours are 
conducted outside the house -- and the movie. 
</P>
<P>
In a lifetime of looking at silly movies, I've seen few premises sillier than 
this. Even the living arrangements of the Three Stooges or the Three 
Mesquiteers make more sense. The first "Three Men" set up a tension between 
real-life urban sexuality, even in the AIDS era, and the pulls of family life. 
This one takes place in some PG sitcom, high-concept, cloud-cuckoo-land. 
</P>
<P>
The movie's patina of sophistication makes it seem even sillier. With its 
perfunctory jokes buried in an impeccably bright and lush production, this is 
the kind of show that can put audiences, and maybe actors, in a daze. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, "Three Men and a Little Lady" isn't even about the relationship between 
the three men and their little lady (Robin Weisman). It's about the 
sex-hostility five-years-deferred romance between Selleck's Peter and Nancy 
Travis' Sylvia -- now swept off her feet by a snobbish Englishman, who doesn't 
like children. 
</P>
<P>
At the end, someone at this pooped party has a half-bright idea. Why not go to 
England and turn the whole movie into a fey, dotsy-whimsy British manor comedy, 
complete with fuddling vicars, garden parties, voracious spinster 
schoolteachers and senile butlers who wander around without their pants on? 
It's not exactly an inspired solution. But nothing else here is inspired 
either, except for supporting actress Fiona Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
Fine performances in movies that work well deserve applause. Maybe Shaw's work 
here, as love-maddened Miss Lomax, is even more impressive. For five or 10 
minutes, aided by Ardolino's dance-like staging and Selleck's deft, low-key 
reactions, she turns this complacent, flat, shimmeringly well-dressed dud of a 
movie into something close to high-style comedy. Her eyes gleam with 
herky-jerky patrician lust; her hands rove caressingly over her own collarbone; 
improbable arousal erupts with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
Other than Shaw's turn, which gets dampened in the determinedly frolicsome 
finale, there's little to like in "Three Men and a Little Lady" (MPAA-rated PG, 
despite language and innuendo). Selleck is charming. Danson, aided by latex and 
a Carmen Miranda outfit, has two funny scenes. Travis has a lovely smile, which 
she overuses. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Greenberg is back to light the sets in sugary splendor, though 
unfortunately, designer Peter Larkin isn't back to dress them. His spectacular 
"Baby" bachelor pad, has been deserted for the brownstone. And that's not a 
place we'd like to return to, unless it were brightened up with a script worthy 
of Fiona Shaw.

Teachers Honor Jones: Actor James Earl Jones received the Jean Renoir Award 
from the Los Angeles Film Teachers Assn. Monday night. Upon receiving the 
award, Jones said: "The interest of teachers in film as a means of education is 
of particular interest to me because film can be so influential in the 
education of the young. One of the things we hope to achieve with our 
production of 'Gabriel's Fire' is to bring out many of the problems faced by 
youth today. . . . Maybe if we can do a good job with this, we can help create 
a better understanding of what goes on in young people's minds, how we can help 
them and perhaps even show them how to help themselves." CLAUDIA PUIG

Discrimination Suit: The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a sex 
discrimination lawsuit Monday against a Baltimore TV station accused of firing 
an anchorwoman because she demanded the same pay as her male counterparts. The 
lawsuit against WBAL and parent company Hearst Corp. is the first such action 
by the federal agency against a TV station. EEOC Chairman Evan Kemp Jr. said 
that the agency found that Ruth Ann (Rudy) Miller was paid $141,000 a year 
compared to $170,000 and $180,000 for two male anchormen. CLAUDIA PUIG

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC / THOMAS K. ARNOLD: RAP GROUP'S PROSECUTION 
DIDN'T DESERVE CONSIDERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The decision last week by the San Diego city attorney's office not to prosecute 
three members of Los Angeles rap group Digital Underground for simulating sex 
acts with inflatable dolls during an Aug. 26 concert at the San Diego Sports 
Arena was a good one. 
</P>
<P>
Still, that the city attorney even considered bringing obscenity charges 
against the rappers is a grim reminder of the growing disrespect authorities 
around the country are showing for First Amendment rights to free speech and 
free expression. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, Digital Underground's love-doll act may have been tasteless, but so 
what? Anyone who found it offensive was free to walk out; nobody was forced to 
watch it. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times, Deputy City Atty. James Cahan said the decision 
not to prosecute the rap group was based solely on the city attorney's belief 
that the case "was not worth pursuing," in light of recent obscenity rulings 
that went against prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few months, prosecutors lost two celebrated obscenity cases, one 
involving the lyrics of rap group 2 Live Crew and the other, an exhibit of the 
late Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs. 
</P>
<P>
"The conduct (of Digital Underground) was certainly vulgar, but not necessarily 
obscene according to the statute," Cahan told The Times. "The probability of 
winning was too remote to bring to trial." 
</P>
<P>
Had the city attorney felt otherwise, then, there would have been yet another 
misguided attempt to legislate morality. 
</P>
<P>
And that's scary. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Gaulton is a survivor. For the second time this year, he has weathered a 
career crisis and promptly found something else to do. Last January, Gaulton 
was abruptly fired by the new owners of the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa after 
several years of booking big-name rock bands into the 750-capacity nightclub. 
Within days, he was hired by local concert-promoting firm Bill Silva Presents. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Silva handed Gaulton his walking papers. The split was "very 
amicable," Gaulton said. "The recession just hit everything, especially the 
concert business; they needed to make some cutbacks, and since I was one of the 
last people hired, it was natural." 
</P>
<P>
Gaulton has since launched his own concert-promoting company, Jaguar 
Productions. His first order of business: producing a series of four pop-jazz 
concerts at the Theatre East, part of the East County Performing Arts Center in 
El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
On tap for the 1,200-seat facility are Michael Franks, Dec. 9; David Benoit, 
Jan. 26; Larry Carlton, Feb. 15; and the Rippingtons, April 19. 
</P>
<P>
"The people at the East County Performing Arts Center had this idea for a jazz 
concert series, but they didn't know where to go with it," Gaulton said. "So I 
got together with them, and we're going to do these four concerts, starting 
with Michael Franks, which is a free show, really just a get-to-know-the-venue 
show." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets to the Franks concert will be given away over the air, by local jazz 
radio station KIFM-FM (98.1). Tickets to the three other shows will be sold at 
a yet-undetermined price. 
</P>
<P>
Gaulton said he plans to produce more concerts at the Theatre East. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an acoustically perfect venue that, in the past, has been under-used," 
he said. "For the first 13 years, the theater has been operating in the red, 
but now Dick Childs is general manager and for the first time, it's running in 
the black. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, we're going to touch virtually all types of popular music. Sure, 
there are certain limitations because the room is so beautiful and the board of 
directors wouldn't allow me to put Jane's Addiction in there; the room wouldn't 
go well with heavy metal or punk. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm hoping we can do jazz and country and (middle of the road) concerts on 
a regular basis. The limits some of the other performing arts centers around 
town are putting on themselves, in terms of scheduling and lack of vision, 
we're not going to have in this place." 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: Informal jam sessions were a Sunday-night tradition at the old 
Bodie's in East San Diego, which between 1981 and its closure in 1985 was 
something of a mecca for San Diego's finest original rock bands. And now, two 
months after the new Bodie's opened in downtown, the sorely missed Sunday jams 
are back. The spirited free-for-alls start at 4 p.m. and end around midnight; 
in addition to the music, everyone gets a free pasta dinner. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Buddy Blue and the Jacks will be appearing tonight at the Belly Up Tavern in 
Solana Beach. It is the local "blue-eyed soul" group's third concert since 
their recent reunion. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Heavy metal super groups Poison and Warrant will share the bill Dec. 30 at the 
Sports Arena. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale Sunday at 10 a.m. for Paul Simon's Jan. 20 appearance at the 
Sports Arena, but only for American Express Gold Card holders using 
Ticketmaster's charge-by-phone lines. The local number is 278-8497. Half the 
tickets are being reserved for Gold Card holders; the other half will go on 
sale to the public at 10 a.m. Dec. 2. This weird arrangement is due to the fact 
that American Express is sponsoring Simon's "Born at the Right Time" tour. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: the Bonedaddys, Friday at Winston's in 
Ocean Beach; the China Club All-Stars, Friday at the Belly Up Tavern; the Sweet 
with Joey Bitchin', Saturday at the Bacchanal; Robin Trower with Larry 
Mitchell, Sunday at the Bacchanal; and Junior Wells with Earl Thomas and the 
Blues Ambassadors, Tuesday at Blind Melons in Pacific Beach.

Newport Harbor Art Museum and the Laguna Art Museum will be observing "Day 
Without Art" on Dec. 1. The event at art museums and galleries across the 
nation coincides with the World Health Organization's third annual AIDS 
Awareness Day and celebrates the achievements of colleagues stricken with AIDS 
and mourns the losses to the arts community. Newport Harbor will offer free 
admission, information on HIV infection and special programs throughout the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 a.m. Michael Kearns and Dale Raoul will perform "Forget Me Not: A 
Collection of AIDS Letters," a compilation of letters written by persons with 
AIDS, their families and loved ones. The theater piece was compiled by 
playwright James Carroll Pickett, directed by Libby Appel and produced by 
Artists Confronting AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
At 1 p.m., there will be an audio presentation of AIDS/US II, a theater piece 
performed by people whose lives have been affected by the AIDS crisis, also 
produced by Artists Confronting AIDS (courtesy of KPFK Pacifica Radio, Los 
Angeles). Information: (714) 759-1122. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Art Museum's observance of the event, sponsored by the Laguna Beach 
AIDS Task Force and the Laguna Beach Arts Commission, consists of supplying 
information on the disease. Information: (714) 494-6531. 
</P>
<P>
The LJB Gallery in Newport Beach will close its showroom at the end of the 
month when its lease runs out. Associate director Steve Johnston says that weak 
sales and high rent are forcing the closure. However, he added, another, larger 
site for the 15-month-old gallery will be sought, and an administrative space 
behind the gallery may be kept open beyond February, when its lease expires. 
</P>
<P>
Meggie Brown, 5, of Santa Ana and Tysen Robert Quaintance, 4, of Azusa will 
alternate in the non-speaking role of Trouble in Opera Pacific's production of 
Puccini's "Madama Butterfly" Jan. 12-19 at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. Brown and Quaintance were selected from about 35 children who 
auditioned last week for the role.

ANIMATED 'NUTCRACKER' STUMBLES BADLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Watching "The Nutcracker Prince," a new Canadian animated feature (citywide) is 
every bit as much fun as getting underwear for Christmas when you're 8 years 
old. A blend of leaden gags, muddled storytelling and Saturday morning-style 
animation, it's more a holiday threat than a treat. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Watson's script mixes the original E. T. A. Hoffmann story, "The 
Nutcracker and the Mouse King," with elements from the popular Tchaikovsky 
ballet. Clara (voice by Megan Follows) gets the Nutcracker (Kiefer Sutherland) 
as a Christmas present from "Uncle" Drosselmeier (Peter Boretski) and plays 
happily until her brother Fritz breaks it. She tends the injured Nutcracker and 
helps him defeat the armies of the Mouseking (Mike MacDonald, who overacts so 
shamelessly, he sounds more like a ham than a mouse). To celebrate their 
victory, they travel to the magical Kingdom of the Dolls. 
</P>
<P>
Executive producer Sheldon Wiseman says he wanted "to illuminate parts of the 
original story that had not widely been told," but Watson's script and Paul 
Schibli's direction eliminate both details of characterization and major plot 
points, obscuring more than they illuminate. 
</P>
<P>
They keep Hoffmann's fussy fairy-tale-within-a-fairy-tale explanation of how 
Drosselmeier's nephew became the Nutcracker, but turn the story into a 
crashingly unfunny "Fractured Fairy Tale." (The grating voices and gross humor 
in this sequence will send any adult foolish enough to try and sit through it 
racing to the lobby, if not the nearest bar.) 
</P>
<P>
Clara doesn't kill the Mouseking with her shoe, as she does in the ballet, nor 
does the Nutcracker slay him in a duel, as he does in the story, although they 
both try. The obnoxious rodent comes back from two apparently fatal wounds and 
only perishes when he falls off a balcony in the enchanted castle. He takes 
longer to die than Barbara Hershey did in "Beaches." 
</P>
<P>
The filmmakers waste so much time killing off the Mouseking, there's little 
left to explore the wonders of the enchanted Kingdom of the Dolls. 
</P>
<P>
The animation looks flat, stiff and lifeless: The weightless characters seem to 
slide on the backgrounds when they're supposed to walk, and their appearance 
changes from scene to scene. Clara is especially badly designed, with huge 
eyes, a tiny chin and an awkwardly proportioned body. A scene of her dancing 
with the prince is embarrassingly inept. 
</P>
<P>
Still, "The Nutcracker Prince" (rated G for general audiences) will undoubtedly 
find a place in many family holiday celebrations: The prospect of having to sit 
through it is a much more dire threat to hold over the heads of misbehaving 
children than a mere stocking full of coal.

ACTION-PACKED, DERIVATIVE 'PREDATOR 2' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like the original, "Predator 2" (citywide) has a jungle setting, only this time 
it's an urban jungle -- downtown Los Angeles in 1997 -- instead of the 
strife-torn Central America of the first. Another Predator, a member of that 
gigantic alien species with hideous, crablike heads hidden by a helmet and 
claws for hands, pops up in the midst of a garment district shootout between 
Colombian and Jamaican drug gangs, making quick work of these criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the huge creature with his awesome weaponry makes no distinction 
between good and evil, which spells big trouble for veteran L.A. cop Danny 
Glover and his partners, Maria Conchita Alonso and Ruben Blades. 
</P>
<P>
"Predator 2" may be a sequel, but it plays like a reworking of "Predator" 
punched up to the max to distract from this unavoidable impression. This means 
the filmmakers hit us hard with elaborate special effects, stunt work and 
production design plus plenty of violence. 
</P>
<P>
Since writers Jim and John Thomas' plot this time involves much stale, tough 
cop talk and a trite jurisdictional clash between the maverick Glover and Gary 
Busey's rigid federal agent, the film essentially marks time until the 
inevitable showdown between Glover and the Predator, again played beneath heavy 
masking by 7-foot-2 Kevin Peter Hall. Because it's like a repeat match, it 
cannot hope to equal the effect of the scary suspense generated when Arnold 
Schwarzenegger took on the first Predator. 
</P>
<P>
We can be grateful that "Predator 2" has first-rate actors, even if the demands 
placed upon them are mainly physical, and that director Stephen Hopkins (whose 
last picture was "Nightmare on Elm Street 5") is relentless in his swift 
pacing. Virtually everything about the film is derivative -- even the design 
for the eerie setting for the climactic struggle recalls the interiors of the 
more exotic old movie palaces -- but its makers can't be accused of cutting 
corners. No doubt about it, those who ask only for pure action will be getting 
their money's worth. "Predator 2" (rated R for violence and language) makes it 
clear that we haven't seen the last of these ugly, outsized aliens. After all, 
only poor box office can kill off monsters. 
</P>

FLIRTING WITH MEANING OF PLASTIC PLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUVAN GEER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1989, Vincent Shine made large, pure-form sculptures that alluded to 
everyday objects like pianos and teapots. They were shifted subtly to avoid 
becoming a complete representation. 
</P>
<P>
Keep that in mind when looking at his current pieces which are exact, tiny 
green plant seedlings pinned to the wall or enshrined on tall pedestals. These 
are representations so perfectly contrived -- delicate, thread white roots and 
all -- that it's only the impossibility of their being real, and the long list 
of plastics that make up the materials, that knocks them conceptually out of 
the ring. 
</P>
<P>
Shine's pieces at the Michael Kohn Gallery in Santa Monica closely mirror 
nature. Yet dangling on the wall or dancing on myriad roots, their presentation 
repeatedly demands that the viewer acknowledge the artificiality of the work. 
This is part of the artist's tactic for getting the viewer involved in the 
process of assigning the work its meaning. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with the paring of identical weeds on the wall so that right and left 
offer a stereoscopic view of the same "living" object, Shine pushes hard on the 
futility of observation. 
</P>
<P>
Shine's choice for faux seedlings isn't the random decision such innocuous 
plants might suggest. Duckweed, a sprawling aquatic patch of tiny green leaves 
and flowers is currently being hailed by environmentalists as an urban water 
treatment "savior" that can also be used for human and animal food. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Shine's papyrus sprouts, these plants are symbolically loaded 
objects closely tied to the human capacity to recognize things as useful. But 
the underlying irony here, of course, is that appearances can't be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
Shine may not be trying to be an environmentalist, but this work make's you 
think hard about issues of "usefulness," deforestation and the objectification 
of nature.

BEETHOVEN SONATAS IN AN INDUSTRIAL PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Far less fascinating than one might have wished, Eric Stumacher's return 
engagement Sunday afternoon on the Chamber Music in Historic Sites series 
offered Beethoven sonatas and recent new music for computer-engaged piano. 
Despite the helpful presence of one of the living composers represented, it was 
easy to leave the event unamused. 
</P>
<P>
As he had at his last Historic Sites appearance three years ago, pianist 
Stumacher offered a work by John Steinmetz; but this time he recycled the 
then-new Steinmetz piece he had played in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, heard from within a new conference room shaped like the inside of a 
football, neither piece intrigued the listener. Another unfamiliar contemporary 
work, Jon Deak's 11-minute narrative, "Shiver Me Timbers," using a text by 
Robert Louis Stevenson, also left the observer in the ho-hum mode. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the most gripping element at this event, in a reconstituted 
industrial building in the southeast corner of Culver City, was the site 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
This 6,000-foot-square complex, different parts of which are 60, 50 and 40 
years old, has been rehabilitated near-totally under the supervision of 
architect Eric Owen Moss. Visiting different parts of the complex before the 
recital and during its intermission became the best part of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
As played competently by Stumacher, Steinmetz's Four Preludes for piano and 
computer are innocuous diatonic studies accompanied by plain sound effects. 
</P>
<P>
His earlier, 21-minute "DATACOMP" seems to be a comedy routine with incidental 
music, and not one the listener wishes to hear a second time. 
</P>
<P>
Stumacher's first half also disappointed. His playing of Beethoven's Sonata in 
E, Opus 90, and "Waldstein" Sonata, Opus 53, brought forward no fresh insights 
into familiar music. Indeed, inconsistencies of rhythm, as well as quirks in 
phrasing and dynamics, put both these acknowledged masterpieces well out of 
focus. DANIEL CARIAGA

"After the Warming," hosted and written by British journalist James Burke, 
combines scientific research with imagination and high-tech creativity to 
produce the best entry yet in this year's TV tide of environmental specials. 
</P>
<P>
Airing at 8 tonight on Channels 28 and 15 and at 9 on Channels 24 and 50, the 
two-hour program takes the abstract concept of the climatic catastrophe known 
as "global warming," explains it clearly, personalizes it and lays it on our 
collective U.S. doorstep with a realistic prescription for correction. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Warming" has a gimmick. It opens as an evening news program, looking 
back from the future, in the year 2050. The first hour traces the influence of 
weather on key sociological developments in history -- what the weather did to 
civilization. The second hour, starting in 1990 and still "looking back," 
concentrates on what civilization is doing to the weather, as the 
industrialized nations pump increasing loads of carbon dioxide and other 
warming, "greenhouse" gases into the lower atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Warming" has a happy ending. Its prediction for 2050 is that 
effective global programs of fossil-fuel taxes, international exchange of 
carbon-use credits and development of alternative, renewable energy sources 
have created a world that is clean, efficient, reusable and 
community-conscious. 
</P>
<P>
Science fiction? Not necessarily. Burke contends that solutions to the 
environmental crisis are ready to be put in place if the United States, which 
continues to hesitate on a full-fledged commitment to global action, would 
acknowledge the gravity of the situation. He thinks it is only a matter of 
time. CONNIE KOENENN

RELATIONSHIPS: LAUGHTER HELPS LIGHTEN THE LOAD; 
</P>
<P>
MARITAL TENSION CAN BE TAMED BY TEASING, BUT TIMING IS IMPORTANT, EXPERTS SAY

You're about to leave for a party in a casual but elegant outfit -- a testimony 
to your sophistication and good taste. Then your husband, whose total lack of 
style is often mistaken for eccentricity, appears in what you 
not-so-affectionately call his "uniform" -- the same khaki slacks and checkered 
shirt he's had on for the past five days. You say: 
</P>
<P>
1) "Oh my God, you're not wearing that again!" 
</P>
<P>
2) "Why don't we just go to a movie?" 
</P>
<P>
3) "Nice outfit. It's so . . . predictable." 
</P>
<P>
Your wife has just informed you that she's invited guests for dinner. It has 
somehow slipped her mind that this is that sacred night of the week when all 
free men are allowed to sit in front of the tube with a TV tray and watch 
football during dinner hour. Besides, you have a lot of money -- and emotion -- 
riding on this game. You say: 
</P>
<P>
1) "On a Monday night? How could you do this to me?!" 
</P>
<P>
2) "Fine, honey, hope you have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
3) "That's OK as long as we eat early . . . say 3 p.m.?" 
</P>
<P>
It would not be surprising if the couples in these scenarios ended up 
exchanging verbal blows -- or not speaking at all. The best response, of 
course, is the one most likely to get a laugh. But it's hard to be witty when 
you're angry, irritated -- or determined to prove you're right. 
</P>
<P>
If you could just take a step back when you find yourself on the brink of 
warfare and lighten your love life with laughter, it would be easier to keep 
conflicts in perspective, therapists say. 
</P>
<P>
W.C. Fields understood that humor can be found even in the darkest moments of a 
relationship. "I never saw anything funny that wasn't terrible," he quipped. 
"If it causes pain, it's funny; if it doesn't, it isn't." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Moss, a clinical psychologist who practices in Orange and moonlights as a 
stand-up comedian, says couples tend to take themselves too seriously when 
they're under stress. 
</P>
<P>
"Any serious topic can be changed into comedy," she says. "I teach clients to 
stop after they've been fighting for a bit, look at what's going on and ask, 
'What's all this intensity about?' People come in very serious and angry. Humor 
forces them to look at themselves in a whole new perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Moss uses humor to lighten up therapy sessions in the same way she teaches 
couples to use it -- carefully. "I don't poke fun until they know I'm on their 
side," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
The humor couples share should be gentle and loving -- not sarcastic or 
demeaning, Moss stresses. 
</P>
<P>
And timing is as crucial to couples as it is to stand-up comedians. An 
ill-timed injection of humor may backfire. Cautions Laguna Beach 
psychotherapist Ruth Luban: "Humor in a relationship is a delicate issue. You 
don't want someone to interpret it as ridicule." 
</P>
<P>
No one knows the importance of timing better than Jim Hope, a single Tustin 
resident who makes his living as a stand-up comedian. Although he says humor 
can be a barrier to intimacy if it's overdone, his ability to make people laugh 
-- especially with self-deprecating jokes -- has been an asset in his 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
He explains: "Comics are more aware of their neuroses than most people. They're 
always going through therapy on themselves, so they're tuned in to what they 
are doing. That's how they get their material. So they tend to recognize when 
they're doing something funny -- or when their mate is. Then they can make a 
joke out of it and decrease the tension." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Murphy of Fullerton is no stand-up comic, but he enjoys doing celebrity 
impersonations and is likely to lapse into a spontaneous performance when his 
girlfriend needs cheering up. 
</P>
<P>
"Making a little joke or doing something silly or off the wall will help ease 
tension in any situation," says Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
However, he cautions: "You should know how to regulate humor. There is a time 
to put humor aside and open your heart to compassion, understanding and love." 
</P>
<P>
Julie Weber of Laguna Beach says she'd have no interest in a man who couldn't 
share her humor, which she says is vital to keeping her 24-year marriage alive. 
</P>
<P>
"I can always count on making my husband laugh," she says. "If I can't, then I 
know he's really troubled." 
</P>
<P>
She sees good-natured teasing as a way married people flirt with each other. 
"It's a way of showing the other person recognition, and I find it delightful," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
Weber has learned to use humor to keep small irritations from escalating into 
arguments. For example, once when she and husband Michael were both up-tight as 
they were about to start a vacation, she asked him: "Should we have our fight 
now or wait until we get in the car?" 
</P>
<P>
She also has used humor to resolve more serious conflicts. When her children 
were growing up and she thought her husband was being too strict or protective, 
she would role play, begging him to let her spend the night with a friend, for 
example, to help him understand their kids' point of view. 
</P>
<P>
"It helped him get out of himself and see things in another way," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, she'll strike a pose that mimics him to help break the tension after 
an argument. "That always makes him laugh because it looks so absurd on me," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis Wayne, a Newport Beach psychologist, says exaggeration is one of the most 
effective ways of bringing humor into a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
If you're trying to pack for a trip and you find your mate has forgotten to 
include your socks in the laundry, don't say: "Why the hell didn't you wash my 
socks?" 
</P>
<P>
Try something more outrageous, like: "You obviously hate me and you're doing 
this to drive me insane, right?" 
</P>
<P>
With the latter response, you're much more likely to avoid a silly argument -- 
and get your socks washed, Wayne says. 
</P>
<P>
If you have trouble tapping your sense of humor in a tense situation, it may be 
because you're too "self-involved," Wayne notes. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to step outside yourself for a moment and see the ridiculousness of a 
situation," he explains. "You can't do that if you're too wrapped up in your 
own frustration and anger." 
</P>
<P>
Sue Kirby, a motivational speaker who is writing a book to help women see the 
humor in their relationships with men, says she has discovered at home and on 
the podium that people are more receptive to a serious message if it is 
delivered with humor. 
</P>
<P>
In a marriage, she says, "usually one responds to it and one dishes it out." 
</P>
<P>
She's the one who dishes it out in her marriage, but the El Toro resident knows 
what it's like to lose her sense of humor because she wallowed in misery after 
the breakup of her first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Getting her sense of humor back as she worked through her pain made her realize 
the importance of laughter to her emotional equilibrium. 
</P>
<P>
But, she says, the fast pace of life in Orange County makes it difficult for 
people to stay in touch with their sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
"We've stopped talking to each other, listening, being ourselves. We don't let 
our hair down," she observes. "We're stressed out more than ever, and I think 
humor is the answer. If it doesn't come naturally, we have to work on it. We 
all have it. We have to trust that it's in there."

in Fullerton had sued the city over a ballot measure was incorrect. In fact, 
the City Council has voted to sue the group over the wording of the ballot

With the busiest travel day of the year well in gear, John Wayne Airport 
officials reported no major problems this morning as the first of an expected 
18,000 holiday travelers crossed the corridors in the 2-month-old facility. 
</P>
<P>
Airport spokeswoman Courtney Wiercioch reported heavy traffic early this 
morning but smooth going as only a few additional operations workers were 
required to keep the traffic moving. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Wiercioch said, the largest crowds appeared during the morning rush 
hour. She was expecting another crunch period between 4 and 7 this evening. 
</P>
<P>
Before their arrival at John Wayne, travelers were flooding local cab companies 
and shuttle services with calls. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow Cab Manager Fred McCuistion said his drivers were arriving at travelers' 
homes by 5:30 a.m. to ensure their arrival at the airport for 7 a.m. flights. 
By late morning, McCuistion said dispatchers had 14 callers waiting for 
service, most of them headed to the airport. For those who had not made 
reservations, he said, waiting times averaged 35 minutes.

LAX GIRDS FOR HOLIDAY GRIDLOCK

<TEXT>
<P>
Police at Los Angeles International Airport today braced for late-afternoon and 
evening gridlock at the huge facility, as the Thanksgiving holiday period moves 
into full swing. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 681,000 passengers are expected to pass through LAX during the 
five-day period, which began today. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) traffic has been moving smoothly all morning, and we've had no 
problems," said airport police Sgt. Vince Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a maximum turnout of traffic officers and we have at least three 
officers directing movement of vehicles in front of each terminal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Airport Manager Stephen Yee said the estimated holiday crowd represents a 4% 
increase over the 1989 five-day period. 
</P>
<P>
Officials urged travelers to allow twice the usual amount of time just to get 
to the airport and to set aside extra time for long baggage and check-in 
counter lines and at passenger screening points.

<TEXT>
<P>
On the eve of a Thanksgiving Day trip to the front lines, President Bush 
conferred today with Arab leaders on the three-month standoff against Iraq. He 
said the 230,000 American troops on Saudi soil are not on a "mission 
impossible." 
</P>
<P>
After a 5 1/2-hour flight from Paris, Bush stepped from Air Force One into the 
warm, humid Saudi evening at this Red Sea port and was greeted by King Fahd. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he was to meet privately with the exiled emir of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Bush and his wife, Barbara, will share Thanksgiving with troops at 
two desert military sites in Saudi Arabia and on a Navy ship in the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"If I do nothing else, I will convey to them the heartfelt thanks of the 
American people at this very special time of year for Americans," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
He told reporters he would tell the troops that "we are going to prevail, that 
they're not there on a mission impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Bush told reporters in Paris that he and Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
now see "eye to eye" on the crisis, even though the Soviet president's public 
statements have reflected a greater reluctance to use military force to resolve 
the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The President is seeking support for a U.N. Security Council resolution 
authorizing military force against Saddam Hussein if he does not leave Kuwait 
by a certain date. 
</P>
<P>
French President Francois Mitterrand said in Paris today that the U.N. 
resolution against Iraq will likely be adopted within three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The President was to spend the night here, then fly east across the Saudi 
peninsula to the Persian Gulf city of Dhahran, not far from the Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, top aides and a press pool of about two dozen are to board 
helicopters to visit three sites -- an Army installation, a Marine encampment 
and a naval vessel in the Persian Gulf.

EMBATTLED THATCHER VOWS TO FIGHT FOR JOB

<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, bloodied but unbowed by a bruising battle for 
leadership of her party, vowed today to fight on, but her main rival boasted 
that he is now only nine votes short of ending her political career. 
</P>
<P>
"I fight on, I fight to win," Thatcher told reporters in London on her return 
from the Paris European security summit. 
</P>
<P>
But political sources said there were signs of support ebbing from Thatcher to 
Michael Heseltine, who forced the contest for leadership of the Conservative 
Party into a second round with a strong showing in Tuesday's first ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Heseltine, 57, an ex-defense minister who resigned from his post five years ago 
in a dispute with Thatcher, said more Tory members of Parliament will switch to 
him on the second ballot, for which only a simple majority is needed to win. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten people have told us since last night that they are with us," a Heseltine 
campaign official said. "We need nine more to get us to the 187 level." 
</P>
<P>
Political sources said some influential politicians believed that Thatcher, 65 
and in office for 11 1/2 years, should be persuaded to step aside now and avoid 
the risk of a humiliating defeat that would split the party. 
</P>
<P>
But defeat was not on the "Iron Lady's" mind when she emerged from her official 
residence at No. 10 Downing St. to repeat that she is still in the battle. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher drove from Downing Street to Parliament, where she stood amid cheers 
from supporters to present her report on the Paris summit. 
</P>
<P>
Since her return from the summit, Thatcher had been closeted with party 
leaders, getting their advice on the mood among Conservative legislators after 
the inconclusive first ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher won 204 first-ballot votes to Heseltine's 152 but failed by four votes 
to get the margin needed under the rules to avoid a second poll next Tuesday.

BLIND HIKER GETS TO END OF TRAIL IN MAINE WOODS

Blind hiker Bill Irwin today completed his Appalachian Trail journey that began 
eight months ago, making him the first blind person to hike the entire 2,167 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
About 60 people greeted him as he reached the end of the Georgia-to-Maine trail 
at Katahdin Stream campground this morning, an official in remote Baxter State 
Park said. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin was joined by about 20 friends and reporters for the final 2.4-mile leg 
of the journey, although he walked the last few hundred yards alone. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin completed his trek under sunny skies with temperatures in the upper 30s. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Irwin had hiked in snow and sleet, but today he got what 
Carolyn Starling, a close friend, called "prayed-to-order weather." 
</P>
<P>
Irwin, of Burlington, N.C., was accompanied by his guide dog Orient during the 
epic journey. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors helped pay expenses for Irwin, a 50-year-old recovering alcoholic who 
lost his sight to an eye disease when he was 28. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm no great example of anything," he said in a recent interview. "Any blind 
person that is capable could do the same thing if they wanted to go through the 
same difficulty." 
</P>
<P>
Since setting out from Georgia in March, Irwin has fallen dozens of times. He 
has broken a rib, worn out equipment and coped with foul weather.

and analysis at the CIA's Counter Terrorism Center, said the PFLP-GC guerrillas 
abandoned the project at the last minute after a police raid on their 
safehouses near Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
Cannistraro said the job was taken over by Libyan agents who planted the highly 
sophisticated Semtex explosives in the forward hold of the plane and timed them 
to go off soon after takeoff from Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
Cannistraro said the Pan Am bombing was ordered by the government of Iran in 
retaliation for the accidental downing of an Iranian passenger jet over the 
Persian Gulf in July, 1988, by the U.S. cruiser Vincennes. The scheme was known 
to Iran's top leadership, including its current president, Hashemi Rafsanjani. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 270 people killed by the blast were Americans, and the United 
States has been seeking sufficient evidence for indictments that would stand up 
in a court of law. 
</P>
<P>
Cannistraro, taking the unusual step of speaking to reporters soon after 
leaving the agency, said investigators have made great progress in determining 
how the bomb was placed on board and by whom. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, the indictments won't make much difference because the 
perpetrators probably are "beyond the reach of U.S. law." 
</P>
<P>
CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield declined to address the substance of Cannistraro's 
remarks.

A previously unknown millionaire emigre who has suddenly become a contender in 
Poland's presidential race jumped ahead of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki in 
the polls today, trailing only Lech Walesa. 
</P>
<P>
The latest survey by the government polling service showed 42-year-old 
businessman Stanislaw Tyminski was backed by 20% of respondents. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa, the Solidarity chairman, was favored by 27%, Mazowiecki by 17%, and the 
remaining three candidates shared a total of 12%. Twenty-four percent were 
undecided or did not plan to vote. 
</P>
<P>
If no candidate wins more than 50% in Sunday's election, the top two 
vote-getters will compete in a Dec. 9 runoff. 
</P>
<P>
A pro-Mazowiecki newspaper lamented Tyminski's meteoric rise in a front-page 
commentary today: "Poland used to be the conscience of Europe, and now we have 
a chance to become the laughingstock of the world."

SOVIET REPUBLICS BERATED FOR KEEPING PRICE CONTROLS

The national government berated the Russian and Kazakhstan republics today for 
refusing to obey a decree to lift price controls on jewelry, American 
cigarettes and other luxury goods. 
</P>
<P>
The State Prices Committee said the move to free market prices for 
non-essential luxury items was inevitable, and that their prices should rise. 
The Communist Party newspaper Pravda quoted the committee as saying the defiant 
republics' refusal to obey the order was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of many luxury items have been fixed by the state, but many are 
regularly sold for much more than the official price by corrupt salesclerks and 
even the factory workers who produce the goods and the truck drivers who 
deliver them. 
</P>
<P>
Women's shoes now cost $439 on average on the black market, a pack of 20 
cigarettes costs $9 and a color television set $3,638 -- all three to six times 
higher than state prices, a newspaper report said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers, or Soviet Cabinet, announced last week that it was 
lifting price controls on select items to encourage production of consumer 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
The order affected sales of furs, carpets, high-tech electronics, cut 
glassware, china, car parts, caviar and imported whiskey and gin. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the surprise announcement, the Russian republic refused to 
enact it and temporarily forbade the sale of the affected goods on Russian 
territory. The Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan also nullified the decree 
within its borders, and Azerbaijan said today that it would ignore it while 
studying its impact. 
</P>
<P>
Floating prices are an important element of the government's plan to move to a 
market economy from central planning, in which the government sets all prices 
regardless of the cost of production. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet, or Parliament, adopted a plan for gradually freeing prices 
last month but has run into resistance from some republics, notably Russia, 
which has adopted its own plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Rabochaya Tribuna (Workers Tribune) newspaper today quoted the Russian 
Federation Statistics Committee as saying the black market prices of some 
consumer goods in the republic exceeded state prices by 100% to 200% or more. 
</P>
<P>
It said the average black market price for beef or pork was $16.20 and for a 
small jar of caviar, $37.80, both four times the state price.

RETAILER, RABBI SQUARE OFF OVER KOSHER HOT DOG

A dispute over how to grill a hot dog has a Palestinian food retailer pitted 
against a rabbi who is Baltimore's lone inspector of kosher meats. 
</P>
<P>
The merchant, George Barghout, was still touting his dogs as kosher Tuesday 
despite a conviction last week for violating a city ordinance that bars 
merchants from claiming their products are kosher when they're not. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Mayer Kurcfeld has spent 15 months dogging Barghout, insisting that the 
kosher wieners he sells at his Yogurt Plus eatery are rendered non-kosher 
because he grills them next to non-kosher dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"If the consumer believes he is getting kosher food, that is what he should 
get," the rabbi said. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish dietary laws forbid the commingling of kosher and non-kosher foods. 
Barghout says the cooking does not deprive the hot dogs of their kosher 
qualities. "The flame doesn't contaminate the meat; it purifies it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make any difference what he thinks," Kurcfeld replied.

Japan's Sony Corp. today posted dazzling results for the first half of its 
fiscal year, but industry analysts forecast tougher times ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by strong sales of 8-millimeter video camcorders, audio equipment and 
color TVs, the parent company's net profits jumped 45% in the six months ended 
Sept. 30 to $307.7 million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Profit growth for the Sony group as a whole, however, was much smaller due to 
the falling value of the dollar, a slowdown in the U.S. economy and continuing 
costs of absorbing Columbia Pictures Entertainment and CBS Records Inc. Net 
group profits rose 6% to $405.9 million.

The Daily News has taken a new tack in the nearly monthlong strike against the 
tabloid by suing 11 people for allegedly burning a delivery truck, stealing 
bundled papers or attacking replacement drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence in two of the three lawsuits filed in state court Tuesday includes 
videotapes made by management, newspaper spokesman John T. Sloan said. 
</P>
<P>
Each lawsuit, claiming the defendants hurt the paper's ability to do business, 
seeks $100,000 in punitive damages and unspecified compensatory damages. 
</P>
<P>
One lawsuit claims that a member of the drivers' union set fire to a truck 
outside the paper's Brooklyn printing plant on Oct. 25, the night the strike 
began. 
</P>
<P>
Another claims that two Wall Street Journal drivers stole bundles of the News 
that had been left at a drop-off point by non-union drivers on Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The third lawsuit accuses eight people of attacking non-union drivers and 
independent distributors on Oct. 31 at a paper drop-off point. 
</P>
<P>
Nine unions representing more than 2,000 employees at the nation's 
third-largest newspaper went on strike over what they called unfair labor 
practices.

POSTAL WORKER DISPUTE SENT INTO ARBITRATION

A dispute over wages and job security for 660,000 unionized Postal Service 
workers was sent into binding arbitration early today after negotiators failed 
to meet a midnight contract deadline and called off further talks. 
</P>
<P>
Union leaders accused Postal Service officials of refusing to bargain with 
them, while Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank said the unions' demands would 
have "priced the Postal Service out of business." 
</P>
<P>
No disruption in mail service is expected because federal law prohibits postal 
workers from striking. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a charade. We waited untold hours by the telephone for their phone 
calls," Vincent Sombrotto, president of the 234,000-member National Letter 
Carriers Union, said at a midnight news conference at the hotel where the 
Postal Service had held talks with its four largest unions. 
</P>
<P>
Frank, holding his own news conference minutes later, said workers' demands for 
a $50-billion pay increase package are an "off-the-wall" proposal that has 
derailed the collective bargaining process. 
</P>
<P>
"At a time that thousands of American workers are facing layoffs or real wage 
and benefit reductions, the unions have insisted on unrealistic pay increases," 
Frank said. "Continuation of these talks at this time would not be productive." 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, a fact-finding commission will be established, under the 
direction of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, to review the 
dispute. It will report back to both sides within 45 days. If management and 
labor still can't reach agreement, an arbitration panel will settle the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The arbitration process could take more than three months. 
</P>
<P>
However, both sides could agree to go back to bargaining at any time and settle 
the dispute on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Key issues in the talks that started nearly three months ago involved pay 
increases and how many part-time workers the Postal Service should be allowed 
to hire to help it shift to automation. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service had offered workers automatic cash bonuses of $950 over two 
years and additional performance-based bonuses of up to $1,100 a year if 
certain customer satisfaction and budget goals were met. 
</P>
<P>
Unions, seeking a three-year contract, asked for 8% pay increases the first 
year and 7% raises the next two years. Letter carriers and clerks now make 
between $24,000 and $31,500 a year, plus an additional $8,500 in benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Another key issue was the Postal Service's efforts to increase its part-time 
work force. 
</P>
<P>
Unions complained that the Postal Service would no longer have career-oriented 
jobs that provided sound benefits.

Profits for major oil companies increased by less than 2% in the months 
immediately after the Persian Gulf crisis, and most benefits from higher prices 
went to oil-producing countries, the Energy Department reported today. 
</P>
<P>
A report by the Energy Information Administration said higher crude oil prices 
"led to substantial increases in income from oil and gas production" but that 
the beneficiaries often were foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
Income for oil-producing countries, as well as for domestic producers, soared 
in the third quarter by 684% compared to the same three-month period in 1989, 
the report said. But for the most part, the benefit did not pass on to many of 
the oil companies, it said. 
</P>
<P>
"For the major petroleum companies, increased profits from oil and gas 
production were nearly offset by reduced earnings from refining, marketing and 
chemical businesses," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The net income for major U.S. oil companies was up 1.7% overall. Companies that 
had to buy crude oil and petroleum products at the higher prices reported 
profit declines, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Some refineries reported sharp increases in profits, however.

FOYT SAYS HE'LL QUIT AT END OF '91

More than a half-century of racing will come to an end next year for A. J. 
Foyt. 
</P>
<P>
Foyt, the all-time winningest Indy-car driver, said Tuesday night he'll make 
one last run in the Indianapolis 500, "finish the 1991 season and then call it 
quits." 
</P>
<P>
"I hate that I've got to call it to an end," Foyt said. "But there comes a time 
in everybody's life that it's over with." 
</P>
<P>
Foyt, 55, is recuperating at his Houston home from injuries sustained in a race 
crash Sept. 23 at Elkhart Lake, Wis. He broke and dislocated bones in both legs 
and feet. 
</P>
<P>
"If I get back 100% and finish 1991, I've had an enjoyable career," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foyt had earlier hinted at retirement but had not made an announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, this will be the last time," Foyt said of next year's 500. 
</P>
<P>
Foyt, who has won four Indy 500s, said the accident spoiled his plan to wait 
until next year before announcing the 1991 season would be his last. 
</P>
<P>
Foyt, who won the Indianapolis 500 in 1961, 1964, 1967 and 1977, is winless on 
the Indy-car circuit since a victory in the Pocono 500 in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
His father built him his first race car when Foyt was 3. He won his first 
midget car race in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
With career earnings of $5.5 million, Foyt finished his 34th season with 67 
Indy-car career victories and 53 poles. He is second to Mario Andretti in 
poles. 
</P>
<P>
Foyt's career has not been limited to Indy cars. He is the only driver ever to 
win the Indianapolis 500, stock-car racing's Daytona 500 and endurance racing's 
24 Hours of Le Mans. 
</P>
<P>
He has won races in 18 different seasons and has nine victories in races of 500 
miles, both Indy-car records.

James Worthy's name appears on the log of an escort service linked to 
prostitution, Portland police said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers forward pleaded innocent Tuesday in Houston to charges he solicited 
prostitution from two undercover police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy allegedly called an escort service that was being monitored by police. 
He was arrested last week before a game with the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
Police made no attempt earlier this year to pursue Worthy in the Portland case, 
Portland Police Bureau spokesman Dave Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
The detective who investigated the Portland case, Sgt. Rick Mosiman, said 
Worthy's name appeared on the Feb. 6 log of Allstar Models and Escorts. 
</P>
<P>
Police confirmed with officials at a local Marriott hotel that Worthy stayed in 
the room listed next to his name in the log, Mosiman said. 
</P>
<P>
Police seized the log in a raid on Allstar Models and Escorts, he said.

The service's operator, Valerie Ann Walton, 24, and her sister, Marla Walton, 
22, later were convicted of promoting prostitution, Mosiman said. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of a three-month police investigation of Allstar Models, an 
undercover police officer also arrested two customers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But there never was any direct evidence that Worthy solicited sex from any of 
the women who worked for the Waltons, Mosiman said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said Worthy was the only professional athlete identified as a possible 
customer of the service.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former baseball star Reggie Jackson and his former agent Gary Walker are 
attempting to assemble a group of local and out-of-state investors to become 
part of Phoenix's effort to get a major-league baseball expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, currently a partner with Jackson in United Development Co. Inc. of 
Tempe and a real-estate syndicator, has met with local sports officials and 
potential investors over the past week in a last-ditch attempt to keep the 
Phoenix area in the competition for one of two National League expansion teams 
that will be awarded next year. 
</P>
<P>
The effort looked like a long shot amid the controversy surrounding the Martin 
Luther King Jr. holiday issue and after Martin Stone, owner of the minor-league 
Phoenix Firebirds, began to pursue efforts to be part of a group trying to buy 
the Montreal Expos, 
</P>
<P>
Walker said that he regards the Phoenix effort as a long shot and that he and 
Jackson are also doing long-range planning to acquire an existing franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said he also plans to discuss the prospects of buying the Firebirds from 
Stone to lay the long-range groundwork for a future major-league acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Walker would not identify potential investors in a baseball team but said most 
of them are or will be from Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
He said Jackson would be an investor in the group and perhaps the team's 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
The group would be under a tight deadline to raise the $95-million franchise 
fee. The National League also has said it will announce its "short list" of 
sites by the end of the year.

LIZ SMITH: A FRIEND SPEAKS OUT FOR MARLO THOMAS, PHIL DONAHUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IT BEHOOVES us to be at least a little skeptical of the gossip printed for 
which the purveyors have been paid vast tabloid sums of money or given large 
book advances. I've been thinking about this while reading the sensational 
hoopla over Marlo Thomas and Phil Donahue. It all started and was enhanced by 
the revelations of a former employee who has now written a not-very-nice book 
about the famous couple. 
</P>
<P>
I know Phil and Marlo, and I can tell you I believe they are happily married 
and well-adjusted after 10 years of wedlock. I don't believe any of this 
garbage about their breaking up, and you shouldn't either. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue has been especially adamant about not answering accusations made by the 
disgruntled or money-hungry ex-worker, but the fallout has been wild. The 
tabloids have had Marlo moving -- in the last three months -- to Israel, to 
California and to Cleveland in order to separate from Phil. (She is now doing a 
20th anniversary production of "The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man in the Moon 
Marigolds" at the Cleveland Playhouse. Phil has joined her there in his 
mother's hometown, where they will all celebrate Thanksgiving with his family.) 
</P>
<P>
IT IS fascinating how very private this public couple have been. They do 
frequently entertain for friends, both in New York and in their house in 
Connecticut. But when I've been invited by the Donahues, I've always been asked 
not to write about their private get-togethers. This can't exactly be called 
"publicity seeking." 
</P>
<P>
Now I want to speak out, along with their other outraged friends. Phil and 
Marlo never received -- or sought -- any credit for the fact that when their 
Connecticut houseman became ill with AIDS, they kept him in their home, 
providing him with round-the-clock medical attention and stayed with him till 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Phil has never gone around bragging about his involvement with the 
late AIDS child Ryan White and his family. Marlo has given millions of dollars 
to the women's movement through her Free to Be You and Me foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a couple that has given generously to fight AIDS, to fight prejudice, 
to fight illiteracy. Not a word has been written, that I know of, concerning 
their work with child abuse foundations.

RICK JAMES RECOVERS FROM FALL 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soul-funk singer Rick James was recovering today after a fall Tuesday night 
from the stage at a Hollywood night club during a benefit concert. 
</P>
<P>
James was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and released after he was 
treated for cuts and bruises, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
According to one witness at the China Club, James had climbed onto a 
loudspeaker to dance and then fell backward into a space between the stage and 
the club's VIP section. 
</P>
<P>
The spectators were "totally freaking out, people were screaming, going in all 
directions" after James fell, the witness said. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of last night's concert was canceled after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
James is probably best known for his 1981 hit "Super Freak," but reached the 
charts three years earlier with the song "You and I."

AXL ROSE WINS RESTRAINING ORDER

<TEXT>
<P>
Axl Rose, lead singer of the rock band Guns 'N Roses, won a temporary 
restraining order against the West Hollywood neighbor he is accused of hitting 
over the head with a wine bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriella Kantor, who lives in the same condominium complex as the rock star, 
was ordered Tuesday to stay away from Rose, his wife, Erin, and their guests. 
</P>
<P>
A judge will decide Dec. 4 whether to make the order permanent. 
</P>
<P>
Rose was arrested Oct. 30 for investigation of assault after an altercation 
with Kantor. No charges have been filed, although Rose has been accused of 
hitting her with a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Rose's lawyers described Kantor as "a potentially dangerous rock 'n' roll 
groupie . . . upset that she is not a part of (Rose's) social and or 
professional life."

A Mozart manuscript that had been locked away in a Philadelphia seminary since 
the early 19th Century sold for $1.7 million at a London auction today. 
</P>
<P>
In Salzburg, Austria, Mozart's birthplace, the International Mozarteum 
Foundation said it had purchased the manuscript with financial support from the 
Austrian government and the city. 
</P>
<P>
The price for the manuscript of the Fantasia and Sonata in C Minor equaled the 
world record for a single musical work set in 1989 for the score of a Schumann 
piano concerto. 
</P>
<P>
The manuscript, dating from 1784-85, was discovered in the safe of the Eastern 
Baptist Theological Seminary in Philadelphia. The proceeds will be used by the 
donor, Marguerite Doane, to continue the seminary's work. 
</P>
<P>
The Mozart manuscript, auctioned by Sotheby's, was bought by London antiquarian 
book dealers Otto Haas on behalf of the foundation. The price included the 
buyer's premium.

Priscilla Presley says her 3-year-old son and year-old granddaughter are being 
raised like brother and sister. 
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old actress says she spoils her granddaughter, Danielle, but "I 
won't let her call me Grandma." 
</P>
<P>
"It has such an image, and I don't want it," she said in an interview in 
Woman's Day magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Priscilla's son, Navarone, was fathered by Marco Garibaldi, a 33-year-old 
Brazilian the actress has known for five years. 
</P>
<P>
Danielle's mother, 22-year-old Lisa Marie Keough, is the child of Priscilla's 
marriage to Elvis Presley, which ended in divorce in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"When she takes her baby home, mine cries," Presley said. "She adores him, and 
he adores her." 
</P>
<P>
She said she is positive Elvis' death 13 years ago was not a suicide, and she 
calls the "sightings" and reports that he is still alive "ridiculous, another 
way for people to earn a buck."

PUBLIC BUILDINGS FOR HIRE; 
</P>
<P>
SEVERAL SAN GABRIEL VALLEY CITIES OFFER SCENIC FACILITIES THAT RESIDENTS MAY 
RENT FOR PARTIES, WEDDINGS OR OTHER OCCASIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Monrovia Municipal Plunge made a big splash when it opened in 1925. And by 
next summer, the narrow, Spanish-style building may once again be swimming with 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sort of kissing-cousin arrangement," explained Joan Bonholtzer, 
president of the Monrovia Historical Museum, which will move into the 
structure, once the site of Monrovia's only public swimming pool. "We'll rent 
the building out for parties and use the money we raise to help pay for 
exhibits and for the museum's upkeep." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason -- raising money, providing a service, or both -- many 
cities in the San Gabriel Valley have public buildings that they rent to 
residents for private affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Some are down-home, such as El Monte's log cabin, which rents for $25 a day and 
is used for family picnics, scout meetings and children's birthday parties. 
Others are elegant, such as San Gabriel's Grapevine Park and Adult Recreation 
Center, which is part of the ornate Civic Auditorium complex and can be rented 
for about $500 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Renting municipal buildings is easy, but knowing what's available can be 
difficult. As the holiday party season approaches, here is a sampling of public 
buildings for hire in the San Gabriel Valley: 
</P>
<P>
* The Monrovia Municipal Plunge, with its arched entryway, red-tiled roof and 
narrow wings on either side of the central lobby, was built just after World 
War I. It is bordered by a residential neighborhood and by Recreation Park, and 
it is the only city structure in the Spanish Colonial Revival style. 
</P>
<P>
What was once the outdoor pool was filled with dirt after the facility closed 
in 1983. Under a 50-year contract, the historical society will rent the 
facility from the city for a dollar a year. 
</P>
<P>
The society plans to plant a garden on what was once the pool and use it, along 
with the building's lobby, for weddings, reunions and parties. Kristin 
Mariconda, a historical society volunteer in charge of raising money to restore 
the structure, said several groups and individuals already have expressed 
interest in renting the facility. 
</P>
<P>
* The War Memorial Building in South Pasadena, built in 1923, has two rooms 
where parties and weddings are often held. Both rooms look provincial with 
large stone fireplaces, wood floors, exposed beams and big windows, some of 
which face the bougainvillea-covered Oaklawn Bridge. The rooms, which are 
connected, are decorated with old war-bond posters. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Bowers, a member of the South Pasadena American Legion Auxiliary Post 140, 
which uses the city-owned building as its headquarters, says the city is 
spending about $190,000 to refurbish the kitchen, and to install heating and a 
new air-conditioning system. 
</P>
<P>
* La Casita Del Arroyo in Pasadena, which has a beautiful view of the old 
Colorado Street Bridge, was built in 1933 by the Pasadena Garden Club, which 
later gave it to the city. Tucked away in a residential neighborhood, the small 
wood-and-stone building was constructed as part of the Works Progress 
Administration, the New Deal program that provided jobs for laborers and 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
La Casita Del Arroyo was virtually a no-budget project. Boulders for the walls 
and fireplace were carried up from the Arroyo Seco. The original roof shakes 
were split from nearby fallen oaks, and wood timbers and siding came from the 
bicycle race track of the 1932 Olympics. Even the building's hinges and other 
hardware were forged from discarded streetcar rails. 
</P>
<P>
With its exposed beams, picture windows, stone footpaths and stairs, the house 
is in a tranquil setting overlooking the east bank of the Arroyo Seco. Recently 
refurbished, it has been designated a city Cultural Heritage Landmark. 
</P>
<P>
* The courtyard at City Hall in Pasadena is one of the San Gabriel Valley's 
more popular places for weddings and parties. Surrounded by the 
Mediterranean-style building, the courtyard has a large fountain at its center, 
old-fashioned street lamps and blooming bushes and small gardens. 
</P>
<P>
City Hall, which was opened in 1927, is a rectangular-shaped building. The east 
side is a one-story arcade, whereas the other sides are three stories high, 
each with a small tower at the corner. A large dome over the west side 
distinguishes the entrance to the building. 
</P>
<P>
"People really like getting married here," said Trini Lopez, who is in charge 
of renting the space for the city. "It's a very pretty spot that has a lot of 
character." 
</P>
<P>
Another distinguished Pasadena building, the recently refurbished Central 
Library, was rented out to City Director Chris Holden for his wedding 
reception, but library officials said that was an experiment that will not be 
repeated because it took too much staff time. 
</P>
<P>
* Grapevine Park and Adult Recreation Center in San Gabriel is part of the San 
Gabriel Civic Auditorium complex and, like Pasadena City Hall, its grassy 
courtyard is the main attraction. 
</P>
<P>
The patio and garden, billed as having the oldest grapevine arbor in 
California, is where most weddings and parties are held. Behind the grapevine 
area, and connected by a wrought-iron passageway, is a second courtyard, which 
has picnic tables beneath an arcade and two large barbecue grills. Wine and 
champagne are the only alcoholic beverages allowed on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Run by the Parks and Recreation Department, the building has two rooms with 
high ceilings, exposed beams and wooden floors. The rooms are primarily used 
for San Gabriel's senior citizen services, community group meetings and classes 
ranging from ballroom dancing to karate. But when not in use for city 
activities, the rooms can be rented along with the courtyard area. 
</P>
<P>
* The Mounted Posse Building in Arcadia has a rustic atmosphere. Built in 1956 
for the city's mounted police -- equivalent to today's civilian police reserves 
-- the building is a long, narrow room with wagon-wheel light fixtures, a 
fireplace and outdoor barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
The mounted posse represented the local police in parades and other public 
events. "They donated their time, horses and equipment," said Police Chief Neal 
Johnson. "This was a chicken ranch area. A lot of people were horse owners, and 
they used to have a bridle path right up Santa Anita Avenue. But times have 
changed, and this area changed from a rural atmosphere to a real city." 
</P>
<P>
The Mounted Posse turned its clubhouse over to the police in 1980. The corrals 
have been torn down to make way for a parking lot, but the building still 
maintains its cowboy flavor. 
</P>
<P>
* The log cabin in El Monte is not really appropriate for a wedding or fancy 
affair. Located in Pioneer Park, it is a small cabin with split logs on the 
outside, a wood-shingle roof and a concrete floor. Outside is a picnic table 
and barbecue grill. The windows are barred to protect the building from 
vandals, and that, unfortunately, detracts from the frontier fantasy the park 
tries to foster. 
</P>
<P>

"You take out the buds and all the stuff that's inside it, clean it and you put 
in a pot and put it in the oven. Then you check on it, and use the squeezer to
