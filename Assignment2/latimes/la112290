A 27-year-old card player hit the jackpot the other day at the Bicycle Club in 
Bell Gardens. She had a baby. 
</P>
<P>
Security officer Al Rodriguez, responding to a report of a fainting at the 
Asian poker card table, assisted the expectant mother with her breathing 
techniques while awaiting the paramedics. Hung Duong, a card dealer, helped 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Before the ambulance could arrive, she gave birth to a 7-pound, 8-ounce boy in 
the club's VIP parking lot.

<P>
A Bicycle Club spokesman said that the new mother had been on a winning streak 
when her labor began.

The suggestion of a ferry service along the Los Angeles River doesn't look 
promising. Nor does the proposal for flatbed trucks to ferry groups of 
motorists down the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
But the chances are better for some of the other 1,000-odd (and not so odd) 
ideas submitted to RTD Board President Nick Patsaouras over the past several 
months. They're part of "People Movin' L.A. in the 1990s," his invitation to 
the public to offer traffic solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"One suggestion was to allow people to take their bicycles on the Blue Line and 
that's doable," Patsaouras said. "We're working on that right now. And I love 
the idea of having an artist portray, on the side of the bus, which community 
that bus is coming from. It creates pride in that area." 
</P>
<P>
He even saw possibilities for a suggestion to reduce gawkers by shielding 
accident scenes from the view of motorists with drapes. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand this method is used in Japan," Patsaouras said.

JAMES BAKER'S STATEMENT ON JOBS AND IRAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The time is now to rally the anti-war banners, not after another 50,000 have 
been killed. It is a definite probability that war will break out soon against 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Those Americans with a job to do in the Arabian desert will die with or without 
our prayers. Years from now we can all nod our heads in agreement of the 
mistakes President Bush made that caused the death of thousands if not millions 
of people. 
</P>
<P>
The new rallying cry from Baker is that the economic lifeline of the West goes 
through the Middle East. In other words, jobs are on the line. I am willing to 
sacrifice at least this much financially in order that thousands do not die. It 
is insane that the U.S. would go to war to defend our standard of living. We 
must all make it clear to President Bush, Congress and ourselves that we are 
prepared to make sacrifices instead of killing and dying. 
</P>
<P>
Let the embargo stay in place for as long as it takes. If we have any strength 
as human beings, or strength as a nation, we must at least give peaceful means 
of coercion this chance. The world is with us this time and this far. If our 
main weakness is impatience, we are lost.

Baker implies that military action against Hussein would be justified to 
prevent Iraq from controlling much of the world's oil supply, thus leading to 
"the loss of jobs on the part of American citizens" (Nov. 14).

Hard Hat Harry spends his overtime pay on a new TV in time to see his son or

SQUABBLE OVER AIRLINE MOVIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was with amazement and disgust that I read of Steve Sun's dispute with 
United Airlines over the use of his personal headset to listen to an in-flight 
movie without paying the $4 fee (Metro, Nov. 10). It is unbelievable that he 
actually thought the fee charged by the airline was to "rent" the headset when 
it is so obvious that the fee is to "listen" to the movie. 
</P>
<P>
And why, after being so informed, did he continue to listen to the movie 
without paying the $4 fee? 
</P>
<P>
If he is intelligent enough to know "what you can and can't do on an airplane," 
why did he choose to so blatantly disregard this rule? Does Sun believe that he 
should be accorded special privileges as a result of his occupation as 
evidenced by his statement "I'm a lawyer and if anything happened on the 
ground, I would file a suit"? 
</P>
<P>
As an educated member in our society, Sun has a duty to conduct his life in a 
responsible manner. Whatever his intent -- whether it be for exposure in The 
Times, to save $4 or to beat the system -- Sun's behavior is a disgrace to the 
legal profession. Unfortunately, this is a standard we have come to expect from 
that "profession."

JAMES BAKER'S STATEMENT ON JOBS AND IRAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Bishops Raise Moral Barriers to Force in Gulf" (front page, 
Nov. 9): 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Church has always laid a particularly strong claim to a corner on 
morals but has managed, in my generation with a few outstanding individual 
exceptions, to stand with its hands behind its back at perhaps the most 
extreme, prolonged moral outrage in modern and perhaps in all history. 
</P>
<P>
The arguments of U.S. bishops now against the use of force regarding Iraq's 
blatant and brutal seizure of Kuwait are the same arguments given against 
opposing Hitler's initially "peaceful" cruel conquest of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Of course war is immoral per se, but one cannot, unfortunately, extract the act 
of violence from its context any more than one can condemn every act of 
violence in an individual context. 
</P>
<P>
The bishops, divorcing themselves from the larger context requiring much more 
thorough analysis than the simplistic one they have addressed, should be asked 
where might the morality lie in a likely even more devastating war to come when 
an ideologue who's made his intent clear is equipped with the nuclear weapon 
with which to defy a highly moral-minded international community? 
</P>
<P>
It is their argument of the pacifist that all wars are created equal, but not 
one that addresses the prospective cost of inaction in each and every 
circumstance.

Sun has the right to question the fairness of having to pay for headset rentals 
to watch in-flight movies, although to me the situation is so self-evident that 
the rule leaves no ambiguity. 
</P>
<P>
The revolting part of the story, however, is Sun's message to the captain -- 
"I'm a lawyer and if anything happened on the ground, I would file a suit." If 
the lawyer was really concerned about possible disciplinary proceedings in the 
State Bar, as he sat handcuffed in the police station, it would be more aptly 
for this abuse of his professional status.

WHAT PRICE GULF FREEDOM?; 
</P>
<P>
OIL-STATE ALLIES SHOULD PAY DEPLOYMENT COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hat in one hand and begging bowl in the other, the United States is again about 
to begin knocking on doors to solicit international financial support for its 
operations in the Persian Gulf. Like last September's initial fund-raising 
drive, this exercise in cajolery and supplication seems likely to prove an 
embarrassing and even a humiliating experience. That the undertaking is also -- 
or should be -- wholly unnecessary is self-evident. 
</P>
<P>
There's no question about which countries ought to bear the heaviest economic 
costs for the effort to contain Saddam Hussein's aggressive ambitions: Those 
that benefit most are most properly responsible for footing the bill. That 
means Saudi Arabia and the now exiled government of Kuwait above all others. To 
a lesser extent it means the smaller oil-producing gulf states whose freedom of 
action and even political independence are imperiled if Iraq's hegemonic aims 
aren't checked. And it means Japan and other countries that rely so heavily on 
imported oil. 
</P>
<P>
Every country, of course, gains when aggression is thwarted because every 
country is better off in a safer and more decent world. That is the political 
and moral principle underlying the military intervention by the United States 
and other countries. But the question of control of oil resources and the 
fixing of future oil prices -- a question vital to the world's economic 
security and development -- also looms large in the rationale for intervention. 
Keeping the vast oil deposits of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia out of Iraq's hands is 
another key reason for intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Because the United States intervened there's a good chance that the ruling 
royal government of Kuwait can in time get its country back, and the ruling 
royal family of Saudi Arabia can keep its country from being lost. Rescuing 
countries for the families that effectively own them is no small thing. It 
deserves much more than a reluctant or ungenerous response. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia can easily afford to pay for their own protection. At 
last estimate Kuwait's rulers had about $100 billion invested overseas, safely 
out of Iraq's reach. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has profited hugely from the rise 
in world oil prices -- about $10 a barrel -- that followed the Aug. 2 invasion 
of Kuwait. To make up for embargoed Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, Saudi Arabia has 
boosted its own production to 8.5 million barrels a day, as Western countries 
requested. But that turns out to be worth about $22 billion a year just in 
windfall profits for the Saudis, plus another unexpected $85 million a day or 
so from higher production. 
</P>
<P>
Washington shouldn't hesitate to bluntly insist that the gulf's oil-producing 
states pay most of the deployment costs the United States faces in the coming 
year. It is their territory, their resources and the lives of their rulers and 
people that the intervention aims to protect. What's owed, in short, is a debt 
of honor that ought to be quickly and voluntarily paid so that the United 
States can be spared the uncomfortable and even absurd task of asking rich 
governments to meet their obligations.

BEHIND THE WHEEL / ACURA LEGEND: ALL THE RIGHT STUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NAPA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Describe in one word, suggested the co-driver on our recent whistle around 
Cabernet country, the strength of the new Acura Legend. 
</P>
<P>
Harmony. 
</P>
<P>
In two words, continued the inquiring mind, report the car's downside. 
</P>
<P>
Unexciting loveliness. 
</P>
<P>
Or in other words: The second-generation Legend that enters showrooms this 
week, is rather like a favorite son-in-law. Says exactly the right things. Does 
everything with decorum and the precise amount of hurry and would give you the 
button-down off his back. 
</P>
<P>
Yet wouldn't it be fun if just once, Freddie Flawless would get real, buy a 
motorcycle and show up for Thanksgiving dinner in a florescent tank-top? 
</P>
<P>
Buffoonery, however, will never be an option with the Legend. It was born 
peerless. 
</P>
<P>
Introduced by the Acura Division of Honda in 1986 as the first of Japan's 
up-market cars, the dignified Legend immediately earned permanent placement on 
the Top Ten lists of major automotive magazines for superb engineering that 
provided smoothness of drive and a reputation for endless reliability. From 
first year to this, Legend has been the Consumer Satisfaction Index (CSI) 
champion of auto-market analysts J. D. Power &amp; Associates. Some say they 
should have retired its sheet metal. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the contrasts. On almost all cars -- with the definite exceptions of 
Rolls-Royce and Mercedes -- there is a constant sense of small bits of steel 
moving rapidly against large pieces of hot aluminum and you just know that 
someday, somewhere, something will break. The sound of a Legend is a maestro's 
whisper, suggesting the car could be safely delivered with a 25-year warranty 
on engine and transmission. 
</P>
<P>
Other motor cars are throaty generators of the rush and twitch of hearty 
driving, and true relaxation usually occurs only when the car is parked and 
locked. With Legend, polished mechanicals do the manual and mental work. 
</P>
<P>
So while the car goes quickly and very nimbly, there is time and room for a 
driver to think of other things, plan ahead and even play license plates with 
the kids. 
</P>
<P>
This is not simple excellence. 
</P>
<P>
This is absolute perfection. 
</P>
<P>
But then Lassie, the Lakers of the '80s and Mary Worth were perfect, and purity 
gets a little tedious at times. To flaw is definitely human. Conversely, nobody 
said that owning a Bentley is as dull as it gets. 
</P>
<P>
So if you thirst for quiet power and a private, muted world once windows hiss 
shut, the Legend will be your cup of camomile. But for those who consider 
driving to be an exercise in upper-body strength, may we suggest shopping for a 
1969 Dodge Charger Daytona? 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how Acura achieved its position close to zero defects is yet another 
example of Japan's dedication to what has been called "rapid inch-up" -- a 
program of constant improvement with no pauses to relish success or wait for 
the competition. 
</P>
<P>
With Legend, said a spokesman, it began soon after the car was launched. The 
broad goal, he added, "was to make an already excellent automobile better in 
every way." 
</P>
<P>
So the multivalve, 2.7-liter, V-6 engine has been replaced by a new 3.2-liter 
V-6. Horsepower has improved from 160 to 200. The engine has been remounted the 
way God and Henry Ford intended -- longitudinally, or north to south, instead 
of transversely across the engine bay. Despite this mounting, the car retains 
its front-wheel drive with power transmitted through a differential and drive 
shafts that actually pass through the oil pan. There are two benefits to this 
set-up: 
</P>
<P>
Mounting the engine longitudinally gives the car better weight distribution for 
greater balance, reduces engine vibrations and improves rigidity of the frame. 
</P>
<P>
Front-wheel drive requires no clumsy shafts and joints (to say nothing of 
interior space lost to the transmission tunnel) running to the rear wheels, 
which redistributes the overall weight of the car and generally improves 
traction in the slick and slushy. 
</P>
<P>
The 1991 Legend (available in base, L and LS sedans -- with a Legend coupe due 
in February) is longer, wider and lower than the first-born. Because its sheet 
metal is thicker for a more rigid, safer cabin, the car is also heavier. So the 
heft of the new Legend, its handling, its squat on the road and even subtleties 
of its styling are now much closer to European. 
</P>
<P>
The base and L versions still come crammed with the high technology of 
anti-lock brakes, speed-sensitive power steering, driver-side air bag and 
quality conveniences bar none. Standard in the LS sedan are leather seats, 
burled walnut trim -- and a passenger-side air bag mounted high in the dash 
without munching the glove box. 
</P>
<P>
The price, of course, has also grown. Base for the Legend sedan is $26,800, and 
the ceiling is over $34,000. So in cost, the new Legend is in competition with 
the Alfa Romeo 164, SAAB 9000 Turbo and the Cadillac Seville. But in 
technology, comfort and image, claim somewhat ambitious Acurans, it is 
alongside the $42,000 BMW 535I and the $45,000 Mercedes-Benz 300E. 
</P>
<P>
What Legend is not -- despite some expectations from industry watchers -- is a 
contender for the plush and very rapid thrones occupied by Lexus LS400 and the 
Infiniti Q45. According to Acura insiders, the high-end, high-image luxury car 
niche is largely overrated verging on the overpopulated. 
</P>
<P>
Styling of the Legend matches the curate's diplomacy when the bishop asked 
about his breakfast egg: It's good in parts. 
</P>
<P>
By stretching the wheelbase without moving the position of the rear wheels, 
Acura has reduced the front overhang, and that certainly adds a suggestion of 
performance and purpose to the front of the car. 
</P>
<P>
Corners and edges have been deeply rounded and softened from earlier and boxier 
years. Most of the gapes for engine ventilation have been hidden beneath the 
front fascia, leaving one discreet, chromium-rimmed slot as the only really 
visible grille. 
</P>
<P>
Wheels beneath wonderfully flared arches fit deeper into the wells, which adds 
to the low profile of the car. Gaps between panels and doors have been reduced 
almost 50% to give a fit and finish that Honda-Acura stylists consider "the 
seamless look." 
</P>
<P>
But the whole is generic and the rear end (right down to the duck tail air dam 
borrowed from countless other cars) looks more like a CEO's version of the 
Honda Accord. Nothing startles. Everything suggests aerodynamic data shared 
with other manufacturers, and one day, swear by it, our cars will come with the 
styling differences of Brussels sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
Automotive luxury, however, is judged by how an interior is designed. That, 
after all, is where we work and play, either endure or enjoy. Inside the 
expanded interior (larger by about 10%) the 1991 Legend is a good room in a 
finer hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Seats are firm for spirited driving yet comfy enough for the hours we must 
spend creeping nose-to-trunk and reading bumper stickers. Head and hip room are 
good up front although leg space seems a little lacking. Yet knee room is 
better than average out back. 
</P>
<P>
Visibility of white-on-black instruments, the pleasant addition of primary 
radio controls on the steering wheel, the feel of that wheel and soft leather 
seats, gearshift position and a long center bank of sound and climate controls 
are what everyone expects from Acura: Optimum positioning and convenience. 
</P>
<P>
And in insulating this luxury interior from wind and street noises, Acura seems 
to have borrowed the magnificent quietness that comes with Lexus, Infiniti and 
Cheops' tomb. 
</P>
<P>
The maturing Legend is very fast, with 0-60 times that out-skedaddle the BMW 
535, Lexus LS400, most Mercedes and all the Jaguars. Better yet, full power 
comes on early and is concentrated in the 2,400-4,000-r.p.m. range where we 
spend approximately 99.97% of our driving time. 
</P>
<P>
The Legend's introduction to the motoring media took place in San Francisco 
this month. That allowed full enjoyment of the Legend as a true driver's car 
and in a region where, to maintain the theme of things, all vineyards are 
surrounded by corkscrew roads. 
</P>
<P>
Being a front-driver means the Legend maneuvers with understeer -- a tendency 
of the front tires to lose grip while the rear wheels are still wondering what 
all the squealing is about. But it is less than last year, a gentle 
progression, and a handling reaction that occurs only when car and driver are 
playing Alpine rally. 
</P>
<P>
Off-center, the steering produces heavy castering pressure which did become an 
effort on the aforementioned twisty bits. But braking is firm and straight. 
Shifting the 5-speed manual transmission (a 4-speed automatic is an option) can 
be done by telepathy because Honda/Accord has a patent on cogs and cones of 
silk and honey. 
</P>
<P>
If only this gentle gymnast weren't so conservative. 
</P>
<P>
Even Legend's body colors are about as dramatic as George Bush's pajamas. 
Twilight (Last Gleaming) Blue. Rosewood (Jim Beam) Brown. Charcoal (Graybeard) 
Granite. Cobalt (Black Eye) Blue. Vineyard (Graveyard) Gray. Granada (Boredom)

ART BUCHWALD: FRENCH ACCENT TWISTS PILGRIMS' TALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day a shepherd boy was out walking with his sheep along the Champs Elysees 
in Paris when he tripped over a Bouche Noel. In anger, he kicked it and found 
this scroll underneath explaining Thanksgiving to the French. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Hugo translated the document, and since then it has provided 
enlightenment to generations of French citizens who never understood what 
Americans did in November. The original scroll rests in a glass pavilion 
designed by I.M. Pei at the Louvre.) 
</P>
<P>
One of our most important holidays is Thanksgiving Day, known in France as le 
Jour de Merci Donnant. 
</P>
<P>
Le Jour de Merci Donnant was first started by a group of Pilgrims (Pelerins) 
who fled from l'Angleterre before the McCarran Act to found a colony in the New 
World (le Nouveau Monde), where they could shoot Indians (les Peaux-Rouges) and 
eat turkey (dinde) to their hearts' content. 
</P>
<P>
They landed at a place called Plymouth (now a famous voiture Americaine) in a 
wooden sailing ship named the Mayflower, or Fleur de Mai, in 1620. But while 
the Pelerins were killing the dindes, the Peaux-Rouges were killing the 
Pelerins, and there were several hard winters ahead for both of them. The only 
way the Peaux-Rouges helped the Pelerins was when they taught them how to grow 
corn (mais). The reason they did this was because they liked corn with their 
Pelerins. 
</P>
<P>
In 1623, after another harsh year, the Pelerins' crops were so good that they 
decided to have a celebration and give thanks because more mais was raised by 
the Pelerins than Pelerins were killed by the Peaux-Rouges. 
</P>
<P>
Every year on le Jour de Merci Donnant, parents tell their children an amusing 
story about the first celebration. 
</P>
<P>
It concerns a brave capitaine named Miles Standish (known in France as 
Kilometres Deboutish) and a shy young lieutenant named Jean Alden. Both of them 
were in love with a flower of Plymouth called Priscilla Mullens (no 
translation). The vieux capitaine said to the jeune lieutenant: 
</P>
<P>
''Go to the damsel Priscilla (Allez tres vite chez Priscilla), the loveliest 
maiden of Plymouth (la plus jolie demoiselle de Plymouth). Say that a blunt old 
captain, a man not of words but of action (un vieux Fanfan la Tulipe), offers 
his hand and his heart, the hand and heart of a soldier. Not in these words, 
but this, in short, is my meaning. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a maker of war (Je suis un fabricant de la guerre) and not a maker of 
phrases. You, bred as a scholar (Vous, qui etes pain comme un etudiant), can 
say it in elegant language, such as you read in your books of the pleadings and 
wooings of lovers, such as you think best to win the heart of the maiden." 
</P>
<P>
Although Jean was fit to be tied, friendship prevailed over love and he went to 
his duty. But instead of using elegant language, he blurted out his mission. 
Priscilla was muted with amazement and sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
At length she exclaimed, interrupting the ominous silence: "If the great 
captain of Plymouth is so very eager to wed me, why does he not come himself 
and take the trouble to woo me?" ("Ou est-il, le vieux Kilometres? Pourquoi ne 
vient-il pas aupres de moi pour tenter sa chance?") 
</P>
<P>
Jean said Kilometres Deboutish was very busy and didn't have time for those 
things. He staggered on, telling her what a wonderful husband Kilometres would 
make. Finally, Priscilla arched her brows and said in a tremulous voice: "Why 
don't you speak for yourself, Jean?" ("Chacun a son gout?") 
</P>
<P>
And so, on the fourth Thursday in November, American families sit down at a 
large table, brimming with tasty dishes, and for the only time during the year 
eat better than the French do. 
</P>
<P>
No one can deny that le Jour de Merci Donnant is a grand fete, and no matter 
how well fed American families are, they never forget to give thanks to 
Kilometres Deboutish, who made this great day possible.

ERMA BOMBECK: COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS ON THANKSGIVING DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's the best of all holidays. You don't have to wear a costume. You don't have 
to buy a present or trim a tree. You don't have to hide eggs, buy a new outfit, 
be a valentine or shoot off fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Thanksgiving is a day we celebrate family. Kids watch the parades, men watch 
football and women watch turkeys brown. It has always been that way. 
</P>
<P>
As a kid, I remember it as a day my grandfather was allowed to smoke cigars in 
the house. A day when all the children were allowed to bang on the piano 
without Grandma closing the lid on their fingers. A day when no one ragged my 
Uncle Wesley about getting a job or reminded my Aunt Mildred she didn't need 
another baby. 
</P>
<P>
It was a day Grandma baked extra loaves of yeast bread for everyone to take 
home, and no one complained about the cost of the food we were eating. It was a 
day that, no matter how poor we were, nickels and dimes always appeared to send 
the kids to the neighborhood picture show after dinner. 
</P>
<P>
I can never remember my family offering grace or thanks before a Thanksgiving 
dinner. They seemed to want to, but they felt like they didn't have the right 
words. So my uncle would yell something like "Over the lips and over the gums, 
watch out stomach, here it comes." 
</P>
<P>
Given that, there was something significant about our reunions: We all showed 
up for them. I cannot remember a Thanksgiving that all of Grandma's children 
and their large families were not seated on milk boxes, piano stools, vanity 
benches, folding chairs and glider swings around her table. 
</P>
<P>
And in return for our dedication, we took something away with us: a sense of 
belonging to something that was bigger than us, richer than us, better than us, 
stronger than us -- that would outlive us all. If there was a death, 
unemployment, ill health, domestic problems, it didn't matter. Every 
Thanksgiving, we all returned to that house to bind up our wounds before we 
returned again to life outside the cocoon. But we always knew it was there. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't matter if the dishes don't match, there aren't enough chairs to go 
around, you're using soup spoons to stir coffee, the turkey is too small, the 
pumpkin pies are runny, you borrowed from the credit union to get there, and 
all the kids are driving you crazy. 
</P>
<P>
You have a place to be, and you are blessed.

INTO THE NIGHT: JAMMING FOR BURN FOUNDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: Tuesday night at the China Club in Hollywood, at an all-star blues 
jam to benefit the Alisa Ann Ruch California Burn Foundation. China Club 
co-owner Danny Fried hosted the evening for the group, which provides burn 
care, prevention and education throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: The Kal David Band backed up a rotating lineup of guest stars 
including Eric Burdon (of the Animals), Mickey Dolenz (of the Monkees), Herbie 
Hancock, Rick James, Robby Krieger (of the Doors), Donny Osmond, Johnny Rivers, 
"Married . . . With Children" star Katey Sagal (who was once a backup singer 
for Bette Midler) and Ron Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: The invitation specified "dress: optional," but most guests elected 
to wear clothes. For women, the prevailing look on the club scene is still a 
dress that fits tighter than panty hose, with bust line cut as far south as 
feasible and hem raised as far north as legal. 
</P>
<P>
Fashion Statement: One man wore a string of puka shells (the first recorded 
sighting of them since the Bicentennial). Other people were wearing the 
ultimate functional fashion accessory for rock clubs -- wads of cotton stuffed 
in their ears. 
</P>
<P>
Noted: Like their East Coast counterparts, L.A. club-goers strive to look like 
they don't get home until after sunrise. Not that they want to look like they 
don't go to the gym; when the ubiquitous black leather jackets come off, men 
and women alike display the kind of designer biceps that New York club-goers 
sneer at. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "Milli Vanilli couldn't be here, but they sent a tape," said master of 
ceremonies Bobby Collins. (Let the Milli Vanilli jokes begin.) 
</P>
<P>
Overheard: "I never stay up this late. I've got a child and I'm usually in bed 
by 8," said one woman, whose black miniskirt and suede boots would not cause 
her to be confused with Donna Reed. 
</P>
<P>
Money Matters: Reserved tables for six went for $1,500, but $50 was all it took 
for general admission. 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: Performance artist Danny Dent took the stage for what he called his 
"Two Fisted Art Attack." Wielding four brushes in each hand, he painted a 
10-foot portrait of John Lennon in under 12 minutes. The club sensibly covered 
the whole stage with sheets of black plastic before he began. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: The show was scheduled to start at 9 (in musician time that 
translates to 10:30-ish). According to club management, the flu bug bit several 
performers scheduled to appear, including Melissa Manchester, John Goodman, and 
Thelma Houston.

DEEP DOWN, THE NOSTALGIA STILL LINGERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There just isn't a decent place to put a Ping-Pong table in homes around here. 
In this land of plenty, you've got your skylights, your golf courses and your 
red tile roofs, but alas, no basements. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard about some guy from the East Coast who put a basement in," said Will 
Foss, the man who issues all of Solana Beach's building permits. Foss knew this 
mystery man didn't live in his city because Foss has issued every building 
permit since Solana Beach incorporated three years ago, and there hasn't been 
one basement built here in those three years. Unfortunately, Foss didn't know 
where this East Coast-style basement might be hiding. 
</P>
<P>
"Basements?!" exclaimed Mandayam Rajan, an engineer in the San Marcos office of 
the county's planning department. "I know of no basements," he said sadly. "I 
will ask the older inspectors. Perhaps they know of basements." Days passed 
with no word from Rajan. 
</P>
<P>
Foss had an idea for finding one. Try title companies, he advised. 
</P>
<P>
Title companies told me they have no way of tracing properties with basements. 
"Why do you want to know about basements?" asked one incredulous title officer. 
</P>
<P>
Good question. 
</P>
<P>
Realtors were contacted. This line of inquiry led to Del Mar, where basements 
have become a political issue. (In Del Mar, everything is a political issue.) 
Strict building codes prevented people from using more than 25% of their 10,000 
square-foot lots for habitable construction. Unless, that is, they added an 
extra 400-square-feet in garage space. Some people built garages, then 
backfilled around it on three sides to create a basement with a garage door. A 
few used this "garage" as a basement living area. Last year, the law was 
changed to eliminate this practice. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very big issue," said Julie Pinney, a former Del Mar planning 
commissioner and an associate with Chiquita Abbott Real Estate. "It's become a 
political football." Still, could these ersatz basements be counted? No. 
basements do not have garage doors. 
</P>
<P>
Solana Beach's Foss had another possible tip, but it too went nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just so unusual," said Foss. "I've heard stories of people out in Poway 
that had a couple of basements built but they were really bomb shelters. They 
had a 1-inch-thick concrete slab on top of it and used it for a bomb shelter. I 
think the guy was military." 
</P>
<P>
All of this is not to say that there are no basements in North County. In fact, 
there are undoubtedly some basements hiding out there, perhaps owned by former 
East Coast and Midwest types, the kind that root for the Cubs and Ohio State 
after 30 years of living in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is painfully obvious that basements in North County are more rare 
than trail bologna at the county fair, scrapple and red eye gravy. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the dearth of basements are somewhat prosaic. The earth has the 
nasty habit of moving in this region, and four walls of concrete block sunk 
below ground level aren't about to stop it. Basements here are sometimes short 
lived, even though codes require much reenforcing with steel rods. 
</P>
<P>
There's the second reason. Basements are expensive. All that reenforcement, 
excavation, concrete and labor can add a great deal to the price of a house. 
Building on a slab or on concrete pilings with wooden posts is much cheaper, 
faster and, in some zones, safer. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, basements are not really needed in North County. This is a place, 
after all, where earthquakes severely outnumber tornadoes, eliminating the 
Midwestern habit of huddling in basements like Londoners during the blitz. 
Here, the ground won't freeze your pipes, and it's been a long time since 
anybody needed a coal chute and used an old cast-iron basement furnace for 
central heating. 
</P>
<P>
And yet basements are missed, especially by those who once lived in homes with 
the subterranean caverns. 
</P>
<P>
Any Midwesterner can tell you that Ping-Pong tables belong in basements and 
nowhere else. The tables arrive at Christmas, are pounded on with great 
ferocity until Christmas vacation ends and are then transformed by piles of 
clothing into a kind of laundry bullpen where towels and shirts wait their turn 
for the washing machine, which, of course, is also located in the basement. 
</P>
<P>
What other part of the house could be so easily transformed into a discotheque 
where adolescents can switch off the lights for a "slow dance" and be sure that 
mom and dad wouldn't discover the lights are out until Boy had kissed Girl? 
</P>
<P>
With a basement, a teen-ager can virtually move out, yet still live at home. 
</P>
<P>
Where else can dad put his favorite chair that mom thinks is revolting and too 
horrible for the living room? The basement is the only place. Perhaps sitting 
nicely on a big scrap of orange shag carpeting. 
</P>
<P>
How is it possible to test glow-in-the-dark toys without basements? You can see 
the toy, but not the kid throwing it at you. 
</P>
<P>
And, perhaps most important of all, where else could one put Uncle Al and Aunt 
Irene when they come for a visit with an eye toward validating Benjamin 
Franklin's aphorism about guests and fish? 
</P>
<P>
Garages and bomb shelters just won't do.

COUNTRY LIFE SUITS DOCTOR

<P>
The first day on the job in Julian, Dr. Brady Hartman got a taste of the 
difference between city and country medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my first patients was kicked by a horse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another difference between city and country doctoring is apparent: Hartman 
wears casual clothes, as though he were going to be tinkering in the yard. 
</P>
<P>
Hartman's new business is the culmination of his longtime fantasy of moving to 
the country. He formerly practiced corporate medicine in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I was looking for a relationship with my patients that I thought you 
could have better in this setting," he said. "I think it's a bit more personal 
than in the city." 
</P>
<P>
His office is in an old house, and his waiting room is a rustic living room, 
with hardwood floors and comfortable furniture. 
</P>
<P>
With the nearest hospital an hour away in Escondido, and with no specialists in 
town, Hartman often treats ailments a family doctor in the city wouldn't 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
He is certified to give heart tests with his own EKG machine, and he recently 
became certified for taking X-rays. He sets simple fractures and performs minor 
surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
Hartman, 54, hopes the move to Julian is permanent. "I'd like to finish my 
career here, but it's too early to say yet."

SAME TEAMS, DIFFERENT FACES; 
</P>
<P>
PREP FOOTBALL: TORRANCE DEFEATED MORNINGSIDE, 13-12, ON SEPT. 14, BUT BOTH 
TEAMS HAVE MADE SEVERAL CHANGES IN THEIR LINEUPS AS THEY PREPARE TO MEET IN 
FRIDAY'S PLAYOFF GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Morningside High's Ron Tatum, like all football coaches, prides himself on 
preparing the Monarchs for their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
And this week, as the Monarchs (9-2) prepare to play at Torrance (8-3) in the 
CIF-Southern Section Division VIII quarterfinals on Friday at 7:30 p.m., it 
would appear that Tatum's job is fairly easy. After all, Morningside played at 
Torrance during the regular season and Tatum has vivid memories of the contest 
(not to mention game film). 
</P>
<P>
But that contest, won by the Tartars, 13-12, was played 10 weeks ago on Sept. 
14. Tatum barely recognizes either squad today. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so different when we played them," Tatum said, adding that he was 
still experimenting with various lineups and strategies. "We had our big people 
playing then and now we we are running with our smaller group." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Morningside had yet to utilize the full talents of sophomore Stais 
Boseman. A quarterback-flanker, Boseman has made a habit of performing a 
statistical oddity: throwing for a touchdown pass and catching a touchdown pass 
in the same game. 
</P>
<P>
Boseman accomplished the trick most recently last week, in Morningside's 20-13 
opening-round victory over Atascadero. Boseman, like many young players, has 
improved as the season has progressed. 
</P>
<P>
But Tatum also believes Torrance has made great strides since the second week 
of the season, even if the Tartars are without running back Carlos Hilliard 
(broken leg), who scored both of Torrance's touchdowns and rushed for 90 yards 
in the first meeting with Morningside. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a big offensive line and their backs have been running hard behind 
it," said Tatum, whose team is seeded second in the division and riding a 
seven-game winning streak. "(Jason) Kendall is one of the best quarterbacks in 
the South Bay area, and he has done nothing but improve. 
</P>
<P>
"Last time, their line really moved us around, and that was with our big people 
in there. As a team, they've come a long way -- like we have." 
</P>
<P>
Kendall, a junior, earned his first varsity victory as starting quarterback in 
the Morningside game. He has since emerged as a polished offensive leader. 
</P>
<P>
And Coach Rich Busia's running game, which disappeared after the loss of 
Hilliard, has reappeared in the past two weeks in better shape than ever behind 
the one-two punch of Tony Lomeli and Scott Hagerman. 
</P>
<P>
Hagerman, who had 140 yards last week, provided the decisive margin in 
Torrance's earlier victory over Morningside with an extra-point kick. 
</P>
<P>
Other Southern Section quarterfinals involving area teams: 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION III 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza of Anaheim (11-0) at Leuzinger (8-3), 7:30 p.m. Friday -- Two 
second-half touchdowns gave Leuzinger a 20-16 road victory over Crespi in the 
first round, with Marvin Johnson's 10-yard run providing the winning points. 
Top-seeded Esperanza beat Alhambra, 47-0, at home last week, scoring 38 points 
in the first half. Running back Jarod Smith carried only eight times in 
Esperanza's Delaware wing-T offense, but made the most of his opportunities 
with 174 yards and three touchdowns. Smith has eight touchdowns in the past 
three games and is a 1,000-yard rusher. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne (9-2) vs. Loara of Anaheim (7-4) at Glover Stadium (Anaheim), 7:30 
p.m. Friday -- Running back Morrell Ollis (136 yards) had a typically 
productive game as Hawthorne beat Sherman Oaks Notre Dame, 28-21, in the 
opening round. Coach Goy Casillas is hoping the victory will provide some 
momentum for his team, which entered the playoffs off a loss. Loara beat Villa 
Park, 26-14, last week while piling up 298 rushing yards. Shawn Easter led the 
way with 106 yards and two touchdowns on 18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION VII 
</P>
<P>
Serra (9-0) at La Mirada (9-2), 7:30 p.m. Friday -- Serra, rated No. 1 in the 
South Bay by The Times and the top-seeded team in the division, survived a 
scare last week. Trabuco Hills led, 21-20, going into the fourth quarter. But 
Jerald Henry led the way for Serra, coming up with a key interception and a 
78-yard scoring run in the final quarter as the Cavaliers won, 34-21. Actually, 
the biggest scare Serra got was a knee injury suffered by Henry in the third 
quarter that kept him out of a few defensive plays. But the injury proved to be 
minor, and he is expected to be at full strength this week. La Mirada is going 
for its second upset in a row. The Matadors knocked off San Fernando Valley 
League champion Harvard, 21-14, on the road. The come-from-behind victory was 
keyed by quarterback Carlos Jimenez, who threw touchdown passes to Mike 
Moschetti and Scott Keawekane. La Mirada was a CIF semifinalist last year. 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION VIII 
</P>
<P>
Cabrillo of Lompoc (9-2) at Mira Costa (6-4-1), 7:30 p.m. Friday -- Mira Costa 
has won five of six games. Running back James Franks has keyed the resurgence, 
rushing for 162 yards in a 28-6 first-round victory at Yucaipa. The Mustangs 
have scored in double digits every week following a scoreless tie with El 
Segundo on opening night. Top-seeded Cabrillo beat visiting Santa Clara of 
Oxnard, 38-10, in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Bloomington (9-2) vs. Palos Verdes (6-5) at North Torrance High, 7:30 p.m. 
Friday -- This game features a hot offense against a hot defense: Palos Verdes 
has scored 90 points in its past two games, while Bloomington shut out South 
Torrance, 17-0, in the first round. Running back George Felactu (12 touchdowns) 
has set the pace for Palos Verdes all season. He appears to have regained the 
early-season form that drove the Sea Kings to a 3-0 mark. Felactu had 116 yards 
in a 45-18 first-round victory over Paso Robles, and quarterback Tim King 
enjoyed his best game with 195 yards and four touchdowns passing. 
</P>
<P>
Temecula Valley (8-3) at West Torrance (9-2), Friday 7:30 p.m. -- West has been 
living on the edge. The Warriors' past four games have been decided by three 
points or less and they have gone 3-1. For the season, West is 5-2 games 
decided by five points or less. Furthermore, the Warriors are only seven points 
away from a perfect season. West is led by Pioneer League MVP Alex Schultz, a 
senior fullback and linebacker. Temecula Valley is going after its second 
consecutive victory over a South Bay team, having defeated Rolling Hills, 
39-28, last week.

CASSIDY HATCHES A PLAN TO CRACK OPPOSING DEFENSES; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE COACH HAS INTRODUCED A RUN-AND-SHOOT 
STYLE ALONG WITH A ZONE PRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THERESA MUNOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Cassidy has been mulling it over for the past couple of years. In the back 
of his mind, the Cal State Northridge basketball coach formulating a plan that 
he hoped would give his team a chance to be competitive at the Division I 
level. 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy's first realization was that his Matadors would have to employ a 
running game to compensate for their lack of size. Upon recruiting a group of 
three-point shooters last spring, Cassidy determined that the offense would be 
designed to get those players the ball. 
</P>
<P>
After Cassidy hired Tom McCollum as assistant coach in August, the pair 
exchanged ideas. They talked over iced tea at a Northridge restaurant and in 
long sessions in Cassidy's cramped office. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about what we might be able to do to give our guys the greatest 
advantage with our schedule," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt with 17 road games against programs that are more established and 
probably have bigger, quicker, stronger, and in individual cases, more talented 
players, we had to adapt a style of play that would neutralize our road 
disadvantage." 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy was impressed by the success of Loyola Marymount's run-and-shoot 
offense and he long had been an admirer of Redlands Coach Gary Smith, who 
employs a similar style. 
</P>
<P>
Although the idea of an unrelenting quick pace intrigued Cassidy, it also 
terrified him. In his 20 years at Northridge, he had always employed a 
controlled offensive pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Before making their decision, Cassidy and McCollum spoke to Loyola Marymount 
Coach Jay Hillock, a Lion assistant last season, and spent a day with Smith at 
Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked Gary, 'What do you run half court?' Cassidy said. "He said he didn't 
have a half-court offense. I gagged on that one. I couldn't imagine a team 
without a half-court offense." 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Cassidy's system differs slightly from Smith's -- it does have 
a half-court offense. 
</P>
<P>
It also is distinguished from Loyola's style in that it is slightly less 
frenetic. 
</P>
<P>
The advantage of the system on the road, Cassidy believes, is that it can keep 
the crowd out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd can't get into the game as much when you are going up and down and 
there aren't that many fouls called," he said. "As long as we don't commit 
stupid reaching fouls, we'll be OK. Fouling negates the hustle and gives them 
(the opposition) rest." 
</P>
<P>
The recruitment of three-point shooting standouts Kyle Kerlegan, Keith Gibbs, 
David Keeter and David Swanson was critical to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we weren't going to be able to punch it inside," Cassidy said. "We 
knew we wouldn't have Percy (Fisher, academically ineligible this semester) and 
Todd (center Bowser) wasn't back yet. (Bowser rejoined the team in October). 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we'd be lean inside and we didn't know if we could stop anyone inside 
either. As for our recruitment efforts, we couldn't get a dominant big man. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could get a lot of three-point men, we could use the three-point line as 
a major weapon, so we recruited for players who could fit a system like that." 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy wasn't comfortable with asking them to fire away, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Gary Smith says there's a message on the ball that says 'Shoot me,' but it is 
hard for me to give carte blanche," said Cassidy, who has done just that. 
</P>
<P>
When Kerlegan gets the ball on the fast break, he is supposed to put it up from 
his designated place beyond the three-point line. 
</P>
<P>
"That's really all I do," said Kerlegan, who connected on a remarkable 145 
three-point shots last season. 
</P>
<P>
The transfer from Canada College in Redwood City averaged five three-point 
baskets a game and hit 48.4% of his attempts. He has yet to become as accurate 
in Cassidy's system. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I'm just adjusting to this offense," Kerlegan said. "The fatigue 
really hurts you when you shoot beyond the three-point line. Just lately, I've 
been coming around getting used to it." 
</P>
<P>
The left-hander has always been a gunner, but he prides himself on his shot 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
In CSUN's system, the majority of Kerlegan's shots come from the same place. If 
the system is working and all five players get to their places and make the 
required passes, Kerlegan will be putting it up within five seconds of 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the key is being in certain spots," Kerlegan said. "What is 
important is that you get there." 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Keith Gibbs is thrilled by the run-and-gun approach. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach is giving us a lot of confidence by putting this offense in," he said. 
"We heard he walked it up in the past, but that was the past." 
</P>
<P>
The offensive plan is intertwined with an unusual defensive system, a zone 
press. 
</P>
<P>
"Man-to-man pressure, that's the style every team plays," Cassidy said. "It is 
pretty standard for all your great teams. Only a handful rely on zone presses. 
While everybody uses some form of zone press, it is usually as a supplement, 
like a faucet turning on and off. We do it as a way of survival. That's what we 
do all the time." 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to invite the opposition to shoot quickly and hope that the ball 
gets into the hands of a weak shooter. The way the traps work, someone will be 
open unless the trap forces a turnover. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to corral them and put them in the corners," Cassidy said. "We had to 
go 94 feet defensively to activate the offense. The whole idea is to keep 
moving the ball up and down." 
</P>
<P>
A danger is the opposing point guard who can dribble through the traps and find 
the open man downcourt for a layup or dunk. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a double-edged sword if they have a great guard who can shred the 
defense," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
There is also the chance the opposing guard will try to walk it up and slow the 
Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
"If he wants to walk it up, we go after him," Cassidy said. "We have to make 
him go. That's the grand design. Everyone will know what we are doing after one 
game. If they have to practice for us, that is an advantage to us. We are just 
going to get better and better at it." 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy took several of the defensive ideas from Kentucky Coach Rick Pitino by 
watching his teams and reading his articles. 
</P>
<P>
He and McCollum also spoke to former Providence star Billy Donovan, who played 
for Pitino. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always used multiple defenses but never to this extent," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
Understandbly, the rapid pace has taken its toll. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in a phase right now of inconsistency," Cassidy said. "One day everyone 
is playing within themselves and we're shooting the ball well and then the next 
day we are sloppy. But with this style, that is going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
It also demands much more physically from the players. Several have come down 
with sore legs, the flu and colds. 
</P>
<P>
"We discussed it with other coaches," Cassidy said, "and they said the good 
thing is that the players come back stronger and their resistance increases." 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy can only hope that the same won't be true of the opposition once it 
gets a taste of his new style. 
</P>
<P>
Nothridge will make its Division I debut Friday at Colorado.

BOLDT HOLDS EL CAMINO REAL TOGETHER IN 22-16 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Maio rolled his eyes as he searched for the right words. The El Camino 
Real High co-coach has been through things like this before in the spring, when 
he coaches the baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
Hmmm. How to describe the play of Sean Boldt, one of Maio's football and 
baseball players. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see if I can say this the right way," Maio said. "When you're always 
around the action, something is bound to happen. Sean is always around the 
action." 
</P>
<P>
The nuts and you-know-whats of you-know-who's night: Boldt, making his second 
start of the season at quarterback, threw a pair of interceptions. Boldt, 
starting as usual at safety, intercepted two passes. Boldt, the big-play man on 
defense, returned a fumble for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Toss in a couple of blown coverages on defense that led to a pair of Reseda 
touchdowns, as well as a fumble, and you start to get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Boldt and a stingy defense, El Camino Real defeated Reseda, 22-16, in a 
first-round game of the City Section 4-A Division playoffs Wednesday night at 
Canoga Park High. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real (7-3) will face top-seeded Carson (9-1) in the quarterfinals 
Nov. 30 at Veteran's Stadium in Long Beach. The Conquistadores limited Reseda 
(5-5) to eight rushing yards and forced seven turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Boldt gave generously, to both sides. 
</P>
<P>
With El Camino Real leading, 22-6, in the fourth quarter, Boldt tossed a bad 
pitch that was recovered by Reseda's Ricky Ray and returned to the 
Conquistadore 13. Reseda's Gerald Cohl booted a 33-yard field goal to cut the 
deficit to 22-9 with 8 minutes 18 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
Boldt then fumbled on El Camino Real's next possession. To make amends, he 
intercepted a pass by Jeff Kent three plays later. He then tossed an 
interception to Reseda linebacker Edgar Fernandez at the El Camino Real 43 with 
4:56 left. Whew. 
</P>
<P>
Kent completed a 35-yard pass to receiver Henry McAlpine -- Boldt tipped the 
ball as it arrived -- to set up a Reseda touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
But the Conquistadores made Reseda work for it. The Regents took four plays to 
score from the three-yard line, with Maurice Stepter hammering in on fourth 
down from one yard. Only 1:22 remained, however, and the onside kick by Reseda 
was recovered by El Camino Real, which ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Ray's fingerprints were all over the scoring in the first half. Unfortunately 
for the Regents, they were not on the football. 
</P>
<P>
On Reseda's second play from scrimmage, Ray fumbled a handoff near the left 
sideline and Boldt scooped up the loose ball and raced 27 yards for a 6-0 lead 
with 5:19 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Ray then fumbled the ensuing kickoff and El Camino Real recovered at the Reseda 
37. Joe LaFirenza kicked a 22-yard field goal to give El Camino Real a 9-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, Jim Robertson hammered Reseda quarterback Deon Edwards, 
causing a fumble that was recovered at the Regent 18 by Adam Guzzo. Three plays 
later, Andy Hasson bulled in from 12 yards on an inside handoff to give El 
Camino Real a 16-0 lead with 7:54 left in the half.

EL CAMINO BOWL BOUND FOR FOURTH TIME IN ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The El Camino College football team will make its fourth consecutive Orange 
County Bowl appearance Dec. 1 at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
Ranked third in the state by the JC Athletic Bureau, the Warriors will meet 
fifth-ranked Orange Coast College, with whom they shared the Mission Conference 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Both schools finished 8-2. The Warriors were 6-2 in conference play and the 
Pirates were 7-2. El Camino won its third consecutive title in the conference's 
Northern Division with a 4-0 record. Orange Coast finished 4-1 to win the 
Central Division. (Palomar, 4-0 in the Southern Division, will play in the Hall 
of Fame Bowl.) 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast will make its first bowl appearance since the 1975 Avocado Bowl. 
The Pirates defeated the two highly ranked teams (Riverside and Fullerton) that 
beat El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect a real good game from them," El Camino Coach John Featherstone said. 
"It's going to be a great community college game." 
</P>
<P>
Featherstone said the disappointment of not receiving an invitation to the 
Potato Bowl is gone. The Warriors would have played undefeated Bakersfield in 
the Potato Bowl for a chance at the mythical national title, but the bid went 
to Taft, a team El Camino beat by a point on Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
"We can still be state champs," Featherstone said. "If Taft beats Bakersfield 
and we beat Orange Coast, we can become state champions." 
</P>
<P>
Featherstone has an impressive record in six years at El Camino. The Warriors 
haven't lost a Northern Division game since joining the Mission Conference in 
1988, and they are 38-4-1 in the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast's LeBard Stadium has been the sight of many El Camino triumphs. In 
1987 the Warriors claimed the national title by defeating Taft, 24-7, in what 
was then the Pony Bowl. In 1988 the Warriors beat Saddleback, 48-20, in the 
Pony Bowl and finished 9-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Last year however, El Camino's 10-0 regular-season record was tarnished by a 
21-14 loss to Riverside in the Orange County Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Featherstone said a repeat of last year's disappointing finish is highly 
unlikely. He believes this time his team is better prepared. 
</P>
<P>
"We're as fired up as we've been," he said. "We're just real excited."

SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was not the best of seasons for either Jamie Grossman or Pierce College, but 
both gained a measure of redemption in last week's 38-35 loss to Bakersfield, 
the top-ranked junior college team in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Grossman, Pierce gave Bakersfield a shock, even if it did not pull off a 
shocking upset. 
</P>
<P>
No one else had played undefeated Bakersfield closer than 12 points, but 
Grossman put Pierce on top with two early touchdown passes, then twice led the 
Brahmas (4-6) back from second-half deficits. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman, a sophomore from Cleveland High, twice completed six passes in a row. 
He finished 19 for 31 for 295 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK;

<P>
EARLY EXIT FROM SOCCER FINALS NO REFLECTION ON MASTER'S PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As if The Master's College soccer team didn't have enough motivation, a Boca 
Raton, Fla., newspaper added fuel to the fire by ripping the Mustangs in its 
preview of the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics national tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The author of the story, Vin Mannix, sports editor of the Boca Raton News, 
"just shredded us in print," Master's Coach Mark Schubert said. "The story in 
the paper said that we didn't belong in the tournament and we were wasting the 
district's money by flying out to Florida. They also said we'd be home for 
Thanksgiving." 
</P>
<P>
And it got worse. 
</P>
<P>
At a pre-tournament banquet last Sunday, snickers were audible from the 
audience when Master's was introduced with a record of 9-10-3. The Mustangs, 
champion of the NAIA District 3, were seeded last in the 12-team field. 
</P>
<P>
"You could hear people making comments," Schubert said. "But we knew we 
belonged here." 
</P>
<P>
Master's proved itself worthy by compiling a 1-0-1 record in pool play. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs tied top-seeded and defending champion West Virginia Wesleyan, 
1-1, Monday, then crushed eighth-seeded William Carey (Miss.), 5-1, Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Mustangs, West Virginia Wesleyan defeated William Carey, 
5-0, Wednesday to earn the pool's berth in the semifinals on the basis of fewer 
goals allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the outcome, Master's will spend Thanksgiving in Florida -- the team 
was unable to get a flight home until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The chain: Coach Pete Cassidy carries around a chain that has 20 links, 
representing the 14 players and six coaches and managers that make up the Cal 
State Northridge men's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them will have to shoot for the good of the team, some of them will 
have to pass," Cassidy said. "They all have a function for the good of the 
team. We are linked together. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take the chain apart we are nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Changing places: Since Eugene Humphrey left the Northridge basketball team to 
concentrate on his studies, no one has missed him more than former teammate 
Keith Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs has been moved from shooting guard to point guard, replacing Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had trouble with it," Gibbs said. "I don't shoot as much. They still want 
me to shoot, which has given me confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Backcourt mate Kyle Kerlegan seems comfortable with the switch. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he plays the point very well," Kerlegan said of Gibbs. "He is more 
offensive-minded than most points. 
</P>
<P>
"Not that we are better off without Eugene, but we are adjusting well." 
</P>
<P>
Last hurrah: Although Northridge lists Kerlegan as a junior, he has only one 
year of eligibility remaining. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Kerlegan was redshirted as a freshman at Southern University in Baton 
Rouge, La. The following year he attended the school but didn't play 
basketball. In 1988, he transferred to Canada (Calif.) College and played two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN won a recruiting battle for him over New Mexico State, St. Mary's and 
Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
Last add men's basketball: Gibbs is looking forward to playing in front of big 
crowds during Northridge's three-game swing against Colorado, Colorado State 
and New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never played in an environment with everybody against you," Gibbs said. 
"I'm looking forward to getting booed." 
</P>
<P>
The next Freddie?: Moorpark's Freddie Bradley made a splash when he led the 
country in scoring as a freshman, but Glendale's Bobby Webster, despite 
operating in the shadow of the record-breaking Bradley, has put together a 
freshman season as good as Bradley's. 
</P>
<P>
Webster has rushed for 1,360 yards and scored 22 touchdowns. Bradley had 1,266 
and 23 touchdowns as a freshman. Webster averages 5.6 yards a carry; Bradley 
had a 6.3 average. 
</P>
<P>
Only time will tell whether Webster will eclipse Bradley's marks, but he is off 
to a good start. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping tabs: Dana Jones, a 6-6 freshman from North Hollywood High, will be in 
Pepperdine's lineup when the Waves open their men's basketball season Friday 
against Montana State in the first round of the Coors Light Classic in Fresno. 
Rick Welch, a junior from Westlake High, will start at guard. 
</P>
<P>
Devin Hurst, a freshman from Simi Valley High, is a top reserve on fifth-ranked 
Pepperdine's water polo team, which plays UCLA on Friday night in the opening 
round of the NCAA tournament. Hurst, a driver, has 12 goals this season. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Kim, a former El Camino Real High catcher, has left Pierce College to 
pursue a professional baseball career in his native Korea. Junior college 
players cannot sign with U. S. professional teams during the school year, but 
as Pierce co-Coach Bob Lofrano says, "What a unique situation." 
</P>
<P>
E.J. Pape has left the Northridge baseball team and transferred to The Master's 
College where he plans to play next spring. Pape was an All-Western State 
Conference infielder at Valley College last season. 
</P>
<P>
No mas: She has earned All-American honors in each of her four cross-country 
seasons at Northridge, but Darcy Arreola will not pursue the sport at the 
national level. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, the 10th-ranked 1,500-meter runner in the country in 1989, said that 
by not running cross-country, she will be better prepared for track in upcoming 
seasons. "I think I'll run better in track when I don't have to worry about 
cross-country," she said. "I'll be able to train hard all fall and winter. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't have to worry about what races are coming up, or about easing up for 
races like nationals. Because of that, I think I'll be much stronger when track 
starts." 
</P>
<P>
Honor roll: Peter Oviatt of Humboldt State and Derek Kite of Lubbock Christian 
College, both former area standouts, earned All-American honors in national 
championship cross-country meets last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Oviatt, a 1988 graduate of Agoura High, placed 18th in the NCAA Division II 
meet in Arcata, Calif., running 30 minutes 30 seconds over the 10,000-meter 
course. 
</P>
<P>
Kite, a 1990 graduate of Camarillo High, placed sixth in the NAIA meet in 
Kenosha, Wis., timing 25:13 over the 8,000-meter course. Lubbock defeated 
seven-time defending champion Adams State (Colo.), 33-57, for the team title. 
</P>
<P>
Schedule woes: The schedule gives the Northridge women's basketball team a 
break. 
</P>
<P>
And Coach Janet Martin doesn't want it. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors will be idle for a 17-day stretch in January. "The schedule I 
don't dread," she said. "It's the big break I'm worried about. That's when you 
battle mental problems and fatigue." 
</P>
<P>
The break, from Jan. 6-22, illustrates the difficulty independents -- teams 
without conference affiliation -- have finding opponents in January and 
February when most teams are involved in conference play.

MOORPARK TOPS COLD-SHOOTING ANTELOPE VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One could say that Antelope Valley College shot itself in the foot in a 106-94 
men's nonconference basketball loss to Moorpark on Wednesday night, but the way 
the Antelope Valley players were shooting, they probably could not have hit 
themselves in the foot. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting Antelope Valley struggled with 42.7% shooting from the field and 58.6% 
from the free-throw line and went down by the largest margin of defeat in Coach 
Newton Chelette's two seasons at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark, meanwhile, rode 69.4% second-half shooting to score 65 points after 
the break and overcome a 45-41 halftime deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it was a wake-up call," Antelope Valley's Tony Madison said. "This was 
a test." 
</P>
<P>
The game matched two of the top teams in the region and was a rematch from the 
state tournament last year. Moorpark also surprised Antelope Valley in that 
game, knocking the Marauders out in the second round, 85-75. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley (2-1) pulled within a point, 83-82, with less than 10 minutes 
to play, but Moorpark reeled off six consecutive points and built a 10-point 
lead with less than two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (5-1) managed without a single point from leading scorer Damian 
Wilson, who averages 23.4 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark Coach Al Nordquist said Wilson, who did not play in the first half and 
saw only two minutes of action in the second half, was late for the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We missed him a lot, but you can't tell from the score," Moorpark's Jimmy 
Galbert said. 
</P>
<P>
Five Moorpark players scored in double figures in Wilson's stead. Mike Waggoner 
and Sam Crawford each scored 19. Galbert scored 17, all in the second half, and 
Aaron Smith and Rich Murphy came off the bench to score 18 and 14, 
respectively. Crawford had a game-high 14 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Galbert made seven of eight shots from the field and Smith made seven of nine 
and added a team-high eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford and Madison, who have both signed with New Mexico State, shot the ball 
as if it were a rock. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford was six of 15 from the field, three of six from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Madison missed his first eight shots -- zero for seven in a scoreless first 
half -- and finished five of 15 from the field. He scored 17 points, 13 below 
his average. 
</P>
<P>
"They played good defense early," Chelette said of Moorpark. "They took Tony 
out of the game and the gave us other things to do and we did them." 
</P>
<P>
Point guard LeVan Lide picked up some of the scoring slack for Antelope Valley 
with 18 first-half points and a game-high total of 33. 
</P>

"There wasn't a lot of defense tonight," Nordquist said. "It was just an 
up-and-down game, not well played. We got by on our talent rather than 
execution."

CARTER GAINS 186 YARDS AS KENNEDY ROLLS, 40-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't blame Kennedy High if the Golden Cougars seemed a little out of sync most 
of Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Kennedy may have struggled in the first half of its 40-6 win over 
Crenshaw in a City Section 4-A Division first-round playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
But the scene at Kennedy High just didn't seem right to the Golden Cougars, who 
drew a Crenshaw team in the first round that carried a 2-7 record. 
</P>
<P>
And Kennedy's 34-0 win over Crenshaw earlier this season didn't help matters 
much. Neither did a game played in the middle of the week, the day before 
Thanksgiving, in a biting wind. 
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere just didn't seem right out here," said Kennedy running back 
Ontiwaun Carter, who somehow managed to keep his interest for three quarters 
and finished with a game-high 186 yards in 17 carries and scored three 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a Wednesday night, and we'd already beaten them pretty bad earlier this 
year," he said. "I guess everyone was thinking about Banning." 
</P>
<P>
For the sake of entertainment, bring on the Pilots. Kennedy (7-4) will play 
Banning at Gardena High in a second-round game Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a little sluggish, but we still have to beat teams like Crenshaw," 
Kennedy Coach Bob Francola said. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy scored on its first drive when quarterback Mike McMullen hit Keith West 
from two yards to give Kennedy a 6-0 lead with 5:32 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen, who completed nine of 19 passes for 115 yards, completed five of six 
on the drive for 52 yards. After an interception on the Golden Cougars' next 
drive, Kennedy bounced back with a seven-yard touchdown run from Carter. West's 
conversion kick extended Kennedy's lead to 13-0. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw punted five times for an average of 20.6 yards, including punts of 18 
and 13 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw quarterback Whitney Jones, the sixth Cougar to line up behind center 
this season, failed to complete his first 15 passes and finished five of 26 for 
78 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy secured the victory with touchdown runs of one and 62 yards from 
Carter. Kennedy led, 26-6, in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy added a three-yard run by Eli Raphael and Billy Sanders' school-record 
96-yard interception return, which gave Kennedy a 40-6 lead with 8:04 left.

APPROACHING THEIR MARKS; 
</P>
<P>
SEVEN ARTISTS DRAW A RANGE OF RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, Cathy Curtis covers art for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The high-tension world portrayed in Robin Palanker's pastel drawings turns with 
such forcefulness that the objects in it get all bent out of shape. 
</P>
<P>
Dogs scrabbling around the globe race to stay in the same place ("Curvature of 
the Earth"). Trees lining the long approach to a stately, pale-white building 
are knotted with pent-up anticipation ("Monument"). A woman absorbed in a 
riveting private vision pulls her room around her like a spectral cloak 
("Transport"). 
</P>
<P>
Palanker's are the most immediately riveting of the works by seven Los Angeles 
artists in "The Mark," an exhibit at Security Pacific Gallery that is supposed 
to show the "vast differences in appearance, execution and choice of subject 
matter" -- to quote curator Mark Johnstone's brochure -- of works that can be 
called "drawings." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the approaches to art-making in this show are so diverse that the 
issue of whether they demonstrate different ways to make one's "mark" on paper 
(or some other surface) seems irrelevant. More disappointingly, some of the 
work seems indifferent in any context. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are some good moments. Hilary Baker's set of odd little gouaches 
(opaque watercolors) offer spare, linear images of common objects, presented so 
as to yield wry little notions of one sort or another. 
</P>
<P>
In "People Will Talk," three small mauve-colored telephone poles in the center 
of a painterly field of brown might suggest the inevitable consequences of 
being unconventional. In "Queen for a Day," the wire undergirding of a hoop 
skirt flies horizontally across a white field patterned with irregular blue 
squares (perhaps a swatch of dress fabric). The fairy-tale unreality of the 
scene mirrors the dreamlike aura surrounding the housewife's dream of becoming 
TV royalty. 
</P>
<P>
James Murray's untitled charcoal drawings are meticulously realized landscapes 
with huge skies and panoramic views heightened with snippets of tiny detail. In 
one nocturnal image, pinpoints of light -- from invisible tract homes, perhaps 
-- speckle the land surrounding a parking lot or sports field. In a daytime 
scene, great rolling clouds seem to press down on the flatlands below, where 
the even spacing of supports on a small bridge provides a quiet rhythmic 
refrain. 
</P>
<P>
Eve Aschheim's huge abstract drawings -- made of various materials, layered, 
scrubbed away and otherwise heavily worked over -- are investigations into the 
interaction of stripped-down forms. Planes turn in space or intersect, arcs are 
sent on carefully chaperoned journeys, lines are thickened to bold bars or 
reduced to scratches. The work is serious and searching, maybe too 
self-consciously so. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Keeley reworks color photographs with paint, pencil, dyes and metal 
leaf. Some of the resulting effects are fleetingly attractive (a ghostly 
Chinese-style landscape with a metallic border, suture-like scratches 
demarcating fields of intensely saturated color), but in general there seems to 
be little substance here, apart from watching colors and shapes at play. 
</P>
<P>
What: "The Mark," drawings by seven artists. 
</P>
<P>
When: 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Where: Security Pacific Gallery, 555 Anton Blvd., Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Whereabouts: Take the San Diego Freeway to the Bristol Street exit. Anton is 
off Bristol between the freeway and Sunflower Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Wherewithal: Admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
Where to call: (714) 433-6000.

"The Weavers: Wasn't That a Time!" (1982), directed by Jim Brown. 78 minutes. 
No rating. A moving, foot-stomping, hand-clapping chronicle of the final 
appearance of the Weavers -- Lee Hays, Pete Seeger, Ronnie Gilbert and Fred 
Hellerman -- probably America's most memorable folk-singing group. MIKE SPENCER

<P>
"Moonlighting" (1982), directed by Jerzy Skolimowski. 97 minutes. Rated PG. An 
unforgettable story of four Polish construction workers sent to London to 
renovate the foreign getaway of their wealthy boss. 
</P>
<P>
It's comical, touching, newsy and political -- a heartfelt tale of workingmen's 
values and Western consumerism. 
</P>
<P>
"Smile" (1975), directed by Michael Ritchie. 113 minutes. Rated PG. One of a 
series of Michael Ritchie films about America's unbending faith in traditions 
and pageantry, no matter how tarnished. In this one, it's a beauty pageant that 
takes it on the chin. Look for an 18-year-old Melanie Griffith as one of the 
contestants. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pajama Game" (1957), directed by Stanley Donen and George Abbott. 101 
minutes. No rating. The plot is frivolous and obvious, the acting hammy, and 
much of the dialogue outright dumb, but who cares? This musical, starring Doris 
Day and John Raitt, is buoyed by Richard Adler/Jerry Ross songs and Bob Fosse 
choreography. And it's good, clean American fun. 
</P>
<P>
"Heart Beat" (1980), directed by John Byrum. 109 minutes. Rated R. This 
character study of Beat Generation legends Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady and 
the woman they both loved is an enjoyable piece of nostalgia, a kind of '50s 
version of "Easy Rider." It stars Nick Nolte, John Heard and Sissy Spacek. 
</P>
<P>
"Cutter's Way" (1981), directed by Ivan Passer. 109 minutes. Rated R. The story 
of a crippled veteran, his best friend and their efforts to solve a murder. 
It's one of the best introspective character studies in years, a welcome island 
of reality in Hollywood's sea of fantasy. DOUG LIST

"Picnic at Hanging Rock" (1975), directed by Peter Weir. 115 minutes. Rated R. 
An early gem from the director of "Dead Poets Society" and "Witness," this one 
is set in 1900 Australia, where three girls and their teacher vanish while on a 
school outing. 
</P>
<P>
A psychedelic/supernatural story supposedly based on an actual account. 
</P>
<P>
"Miracle Mile" (1989), directed by Steve DeJarnatt. 87 minutes. Rated R. Among 
the best of the nuclear apocalyptic films, the mood of this one resembles that 
of the quirky "After Midnight." A man races against time after mistakenly 
receiving a message that missiles have been launched and World War III is an 
hour away. Intense, humorous and powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Haunting" (1963), directed by Robert Wise. 112 minutes. No rating. This 
ghost story will give you sweaty palms, high blood pressure, just about 
everything a scary movie should, without benefit of fake decapitations and 
gallons of fake blood -- just a plot, some chilling sound effects and superb 
black-and-white photography. Not to mention a cast headed by Julie Harris and 
Claire Bloom. ERIK HAMILTON

Open Mondays through Fridays 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays 5:30 p.m. to 4

fills prescriptions for whiskey, but the malts still come thick, rich and big 
enough to share, and meals are the kind mom might've made. MARY HELEN BERG

Owner Tony Manzi's accent is nearly as thick as his meat sauce, and his menu is

you happen to be dining with understanding friends, the fettuccine with garlic

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: '50S DINING PLUS SOME REGIONAL, INTERNATIONAL FAVORITES

<P>
Fat Freddy's is a '50s-style diner with a difference. You can get that juicy 
hamburger with fries and a thick old-fashioned milkshake. 
</P>
<P>
But the diner also has choices of Southern-fried chicken, veal parmigiana, 
blackened catfish and a variety of Mexican favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Complete dinners, which include a garden-fresh salad (with two kinds of grated 
cheese and tomatoes) or soup, choice of potato and vegetable, average $5.40. 
Fat Freddy's is known for its catfish, which you can get either fried or 
blackened for $6.95. 
</P>
<P>
You can't go wrong with the beef and Cheddar sandwich for $5.35: tender strips 
of roast beef grilled with cheese and tomatoes on Parmesan cheese-coated 
sourdough bread. It's served with french fries. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a good selection of desserts, including a huge banana split 
($4.25) that could easily make a meal by itself. 
</P>
<P>
This is the kind of friendly place where your server is very likely to remember 
you. There are jukeboxes at each booth, and the decor will bring back memories 
for many. There is also a full-service bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Fat Freddy's, 1571 El Camino Real (just off the Santa Ana Freeway at Red Hill 
Avenue), Tustin. Open Sunday through Thursday, 6 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.; Fridays 
and Saturdays till 11 p.m. (714) 832-2422. Also at 2949 Fairview Road, Costa 
Mesa. Open Sunday through Thursday, 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays 
till midnight. (714) 545-7713.

south-of-the-border restaurant that actually has napkins. JANET EASTMAN

(714) 553-1333. Frazzled after a day on the fast track? Try a glass of Chianti

Open Sundays through Thursdays till 11, Fridays and Saturdays till midnight. 
(714) 498-TROP. A yuppie joint with charm. Sit leisurely under the thatched

lets out a yell in the bar when you pull down the Ape Man's loincloth. JAMES M.

The Village Inn, 127 Marine Ave., Balboa Island. Open Monday through Friday 
from 6:30 a.m. to 2 a.m., Saturday and Sunday from 7 a.m. (714) 675-8300. 
</P>
<P>
People here tend to be a little older than the kids you find thronging many 
beachside bars. The atmosphere's informal, friendly and real. And the fireplace 
and couches in the corner make it just perfect for winter nights. Live music 
nightly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Beet Cafe, 107 21st St., Newport Beach. Open daily, 11:30 to 2 a.m. 
(714) 675-2338. Tucked into an alley between storefronts facing the Newport 
Pier, this bar isn't the easiest to find. But its friendly, good cheer makes it 
worth the search. Patrons are mainly young and single, and there's usually a 
guy in the back room playing the guitar. 
</P>
<P>
Dillman's, 801 E. Balboa Blvd., Newport Beach. Open daily, 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 
(714) 673-7726. A noble place, resolutely unfashionable, Dillman's satisfies 
the most important requirements of the serious bar-goer: Keep it dark, keep it 
quiet and keep 'em coming. 
</P>
<P>
The Harp Inn, 130 17th St., Costa Mesa. (714) 646-8855. A bar without pretense 
for people who'd rather get poked in the eye than take a drink in some place 
like Irvine. They have OK Irish music here on the weekends; occasionally an 
exuberant patron takes the stage about closing time to work out on a Celtic 
folk song or two. Plus which, they put out a happy hour spread of Ritz crackers 
and tuna fish. MIKE FLAGG

If you're looking for ferns and mineral water, don't come here. It's strictly 
beer, wine and pool at this, one of the few remaining country bars in O.C.,

frightened off by the swarm of Harley-Davidsons parked near the patio.

ARCHITECTURE: AN ONION TO PEOPLE'S CHOICE PROGRAM; 
</P>

AWARDS: PREDICTABLE KUDOS AND BARBS ARE DOLED OUT AT THE ANNUAL EVENT.

<P>
Something was missing at this year's Orchids &amp; Onions program, the People's 
Choice awards of local design. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was people. Fewer than 800 seats in the 3,000-seat Civic Theatre were 
occupied last Thursday night, and the cavernous space seemed empty. In past 
years, 1,200 have attended. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe it was just the salty spray that the event, now 16 years old, has 
thrown off in past years. This year, that bite was watered down when the 
program's organizers prevented the jury from awarding a couple of well-deserved 
Onions. 
</P>
<P>
And instead of the refreshing directions the program might have taken if the 
lay public had been given a significant role, the process has remained too much 
under the thumb of the design and planning professionals who run it. 
</P>
<P>
Without the reek of the discarded Onions, jurors were left with several solid 
-- but fairly predictable -- winners. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Orchids were the Oceanside Civic Center (designed by architect 
Charles Moore with Urban Innovations Group), the San Diego Convention Center 
(designed by architect Arthur Erickson with local help from Deems Lewis), 
Uptown District in Hillcrest (designed by SGPA Architecture &amp; Planning with 
Lorimer Case Architects) and the 103-unit Columbia Place condominiums downtown 
(Lorimer Case again). 
</P>
<P>
Onions were given in two areas that had deserved them for years but never 
before received them. 
</P>
<P>
Carmel Mountain Ranch, the 3,200-home master-planned community along Interstate 
15, with its "endless rows of ticky-tacky boxes" resting atop recklessly graded 
landforms, according to the jury, served as a scapegoat for many badly designed 
tracts throughout San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado was finally chastised for years of negligent planning that led to 
high-rises on the beach and the "scraping of charming, older homes to make way 
for oversize, under-designed shoeboxes." 
</P>
<P>
But the best of the best and the worst of the worst weren't very daring, and 
that's why the show was a bore. 
</P>
<P>
The outlawed Onions would have helped. 
</P>
<P>
One would have gone to an industrial glass box in Carlsbad, as a symbol of 
dozens of lousy glass boxes that litter the county; the other to a towering 
house in Ocean Beach that looks more like a commercial office building place in 
the midst of a residential neighborhood. When jurors drove by, a little girl 
was bouncing a ball off its looming back wall -- probably the only redeeming 
value of it. 
</P>
<P>
According to awards Chairman Larry Pappas, the glass box award was overruled by 
the program's 29-member organizing committee because it wanted the jury to 
focus on choosing individual winners from more than 300 nominations, instead of 
using one project as a symbol of a larger trend. 
</P>
<P>
The O.B. house represented a more serious derailing of the program's ambition 
to serve as a barometer of public taste. The house received 12 Onion 
nominations, making it one of the most popular. 
</P>
<P>
"When the program was established, certain by-laws were written that prevent us 
from going after one man's castle," said awards chairman Larry Pappas. "I can 
appreciate that, but . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Pappas said the board of directors of the local American Institute of 
Architects, which oversees the program, ultimately squelched the O.B. Onion, 
adhering to the established policy of not honoring individual homes. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the awards were interesting and well-deserved, if not controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's Oceanside Civic Center was praised for respecting nearby buildings 
designed by Irving Gill, for creating a source of civic pride and for 
"magnificent fountains (that) provide a refreshing retreat and also help remove 
hot air from City Hall." (The fountains serve as part of the projects' cooling 
system.) 
</P>
<P>
Since opening last year, the San Diego Convention Center has sparked polar 
remarks. Many people love the building itself, but hate the way the massive 
structure blocks the waterfront from public views and access. 
</P>
<P>
The O &amp; O jury recognized this by giving the project both an Orchid and an 
Onion, honoring its bold architecture and recognizing the unfortunate siting. 
</P>
<P>
Uptown District, the mixed-use project along University Avenue, deserved its 
Orchid for respecting the scale and character of the surrounding neighborhood, 
but it lacks public art and high-quality storefront designs. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Place, like other Lorimer Case projects, is a competent but bland 
piece of architecture. Its Orchid was given for the way the architects 
accommodated the older buildings on the block. 
</P>
<P>
Postmodern architect Michael Graves' only San Diego design -- the Aventine 
hotel/office complex in La Jolla -- had jurors at each other's throats. It 
received more nominations for Orchids -- and for Onions -- than any other 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Although not spelled out during the awards ceremony, jurors meant for the award 
to go only to the Hyatt Hotel portion of the project; they considered the 
nearby office complex an awkward juxtaposition of forms. 
</P>
<P>
Several jurors lobbied against the Orchid because they didn't approve of such a 
large, loud project in a sensitive location, but the Aventine's excellent 
detailing and originality carried a majority. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller projects had their place too. Orchids went to the year-old Church of 
the Nativity in Fairbanks Ranch, designed by architect Charles Moore with the 
firm of Moore Ruble Yudell, to a gem of an underground parking garage at 
Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, and to the Bookstar bookstore in Point 
Loma, a renovation of the art deco Loma Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Other Orchids went to murals in Chicano Park south of downtown, and the mural 
by artist James Jackson in the lobby of the Symphony Towers high-rise on B 
Street downtown; a park-like desiltation pond in Carlsbad; the Anza Borrego 
Visitors Center, designed by San Diego architect Robert Ferris and completed in 
1978, which blends smoothy with surrounding desert landforms; architect 
Jonathan Segal's tiny 7 on Kettner condominium project, a well-designed in-fill 
project downtown, and the County Administration Center's dramatic new lighting. 
</P>
<P>
Additional Onions went to a gaudy plastic surgeon's office, the U-Store storage 
complex next to Interstate 8 in Alpine, and an awful adobe-electronic community 
monument in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
"They need to do something different with the program," confessed one juror 
after all was said and done. (The jury included six design and planning 
professionals and three members from other professions.) "Based on the turnout, 
I'd say people are burned out. They should let the jury do more creative kinds 
of awarding, and find a way to get the public more involved in the jurying 
process."

SOCIETY: BLACKSTONE BALL GETS INTO THE CIRCUS ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those who argue that the legal profession sometimes has a circus air would have 
been heartened by Saturday's Blackstone Ball, a three-ring circus of sorts that 
filled the Exhibit Hall and the Grand and Champagne ballrooms of the Sheraton 
Harbor Island hotel with about 1,300 attorneys and members of the judiciary and 
their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the San Diego County Bar Assn. Auxiliary, the 20th annual ball was 
called Cirque '90 and was flavored after European-style circuses and the famed 
Cirque du Soleil. Numerous clowns on the scene mostly came from the California 
Ballet Company. All-American Bozos, however, were hard to spot because the 
ballet clowns adopted the costume of the classic French Pierrette. 
</P>
<P>
For most of its history, the Blackstone has provided an opportunity for the 
local bar and bench to meet, mingle, dance and party. This year's event also 
served as a fund-raiser for auxiliary projects. 
</P>
<P>
But the ball's primary object is pleasure, said Loretta Foreman, who co-chaired 
the event with Laura Wicks. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to have fun," she said. "We're not raising money, there's a 
recession on. But we'll probably make some money along the way, which we'll use 
for the auxiliary's projects." 
</P>
<P>
Net proceeds were estimated at $40,000 to $50,000. A third of the proceeds will 
be donated to the Domestic Violence Prevention Program, operated under the 
auspices of the Volunteer Lawyers Program, said Bar Assn. Auxiliary President 
Melinda McGlinn. The project has earned several statewide awards, she added. 
Other programs that receive auxiliary funding include Voices for Children, the 
Crime Victims Fund and Casa de Amparo. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance at this year's Blackstone was down considerably from recent years, 
in which it typically attracted about 1,700 guests. Several committee members 
blamed the date, immediately preceding Thanksgiving, while several blamed the 
current economic uncertainty. However, County Bar Assn. President Virginia 
Nelson, who hosted a private pre-ball reception for a list of notables from 
both the county and state, said the Blackstone still ranks supreme in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"When I travel around the state, everyone always is amazed by the attendance 
and by the support the Blackstone Ball receives," she said. "Most of the other 
legal functions in California attract only 300 or 400, which makes us by far 
the largest in the state." 
</P>
<P>
A jazz band composed of attorneys played during the cocktail hour in the 
exhibit hall, after which guests in the mood for rock 'n' roll adjourned to the 
grand ballroom and the music of Classic Energy; those dissenting from 
contemporary music headed to the Champagne ballroom, where Benny Hollman held 
forth. The circus theme was carried out with decorations in primary colors and 
floating, clown mask centerpieces suspended from rafts of balloons. The lengthy 
meal progressed from wild mushroom salad through a roulade of veal and cakes 
hidden under circus tents of white chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list included State Bar of California President Charles Vogel; U.S. 
Magistrate Irma Gonzales and Bob Brewer; Superior Court Judge Arthur Jones and 
his wife, Polly; Municipal Judge Melinda Lasater and her husband, Mike; Karen 
and David Nugent; Beverly and George Andreos; Barbara and David Noonan; Debbie 
Malloy and Edward Chapin; Julie and Patrick O'Connor; Louisa Porter and David 
Brennan; Helen and Charles Rowe; Cindy and John Seitman; Linda and Carl Poirot, 
and Carol and Anthony Battaglia. 
</P>
<P>
The committee of Friday's inaugural Stardust Ball engineered an evening stellar 
in more than one regard. 
</P>
<P>
Given at the Hyatt Regency La Jolla as a benefit for the Mary Birch Women's 
Hospital at Sharp Memorial Hospital, the event was the first communitywide gala 
in Sharp's history. That fact alone gave the ball an unusual aspect, since 
Sharp is perhaps the only local, nonprofit institution of its size to wait 
until 1990 to throw a major fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
But, since everybody's doing it, Sharp got into the act, and with a bang. 
Chairwoman Muriel Roston got maximum dazzle from the star motif by decorating 
the Aventine ballroom as a cross between Grauman's Chinese Theatre and the 
Cocoanut Grove, by arranging for a group of talented youngsters to perform an 
after-dinner musical review called "A Salute to Stardom," and by offering the 
guests the opportunity to name one of the thousands of visible but as yet 
untitled stars visible from the Northern Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
The star-crossed in the crowd of 390 grew cross-eyed staring at all the 
Hollywood-style glitz and glamour, which included an avenue of life-size palms 
of gold material and flashing constellations in the ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
The backers of most first-time benefits profess modest expectations, but not 
Roston, who predicted immense net proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to earn a quarter of a million dollars, and we just might," she said at 
the start of the evening. A good portion of the proceeds were generated by 
ticket sales. The prices went as high as $10,000 for a table of 10 (two were 
sold), which is an extremely high price for a San Diego gala. 
</P>
<P>
Other proceeds were generated by silent and live auctions, which offered a 
grander-than-usual selection of goods and trips. During the live portion, 
auctioneer Jack White sold Shih Tzu and sheltie puppies, a luxury trip to New 
York and, for a top bid of $5,000, the opportunity to perform a non-speaking, 
walk-on role on the television sitcom "Cheers." 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Varon's Hollywood Orchestra obliged with 1940s-style ballads and swing 
between courses of the veal chop and chocolate starburst dinner. This 
sophisticated Big Band gave a rare local taste of what it is like to attend the 
star-laden Beverly Hills and Palm Springs bashes. After the meal, the large, 
young cast of the "Salute to Stardom" energetically performed a series of 
famous numbers from classic Hollywood musicals. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick and Rose Patek of the Stephen and Mary Birch Foundation, which made a 
gift of $5 million to the Mary Birch Women's Hospital, headed a guest list that 
included Sharp Health Care President Peter Ellsworth and his wife, Doris; 
developer Dene Oliver and his wife, Cheryl; Birch Hospital campaign co-chairs 
Larry and Junko Cushman; Art and Jeannie Rivkin; David and Kay Porter; Ken and 
Fran Golden; artist Suzy Spafford with Bill Rice; weight-loss moguls Sid and 
Jenny Craig; Mel and Linda Katz; Sol and Hosh Abramson; Jack and Sigrid 
Fischer; Sharp Memorial Executive Director Chuck Koch; Kim and Marilyn 
Fletcher; Roy and Maureen Black, and Richard and Joanne Irving.

The LACE Case: Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, the downtown nonprofit 
arts space known as LACE, announced Wednesday that it has reached an 
out-of-court settlement with the La Cienega Boulevard commercial gallery that 
had been using the name Lace Fine Arts. According to the settlement, the 
commercial space, which has already changed its name to George Mayers Gallery, 
will inform all its customers that it is not associated with LACE, post a 
disclaimer in the gallery window for 90 days and pay all attorney's fees 
incurred by LACE. BETH KLEID

MAK PLAYS TRIVIA FROM 18TH CENTURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Musica Antiqua Koln -- among the most celebrated and widely recorded of period 
performance groups, and MAK to its international circle of admirers -- appeared 
in the Biltmore Hotel's Crystal Ballroom on Tuesday, part of the Da Camera 
Society's Chamber Music in Historic Sites series. 
</P>
<P>
Absent, however, was the German ensemble's founder, guiding spirit and first 
violinist, Reinhard Goebel, who recently suffered a serious back injury. 
</P>
<P>
The artists present, including Goebel's adjutant, violinist Manfred Kraemer, 
coped skillfully, but one doesn't necessarily cotton to the group's brusquely 
efficient, sharply inflected and rhythmically free manner. On Tuesday, applied 
to a program of unrelievedly major-key 18th-Century trivia, it all sounded 
perilously close to parody of utterly up-to-the-minute performance style. 
</P>
<P>
The composers on display were J.F. Fasch, J.C. Bach, J.C.F. Bach and tenuously 
attributed-to J.S. Bach. G.P. Telemann was also represented, but by a pair of 
dinky mechanical pieces seemingly designed to comfort his detractors. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the mercifully brief program -- the ensemble wastes little time, 
according each work and each composer a few fast, glancing blows -- one could 
nevertheless admire the facility of Kraemer and his colleagues, flutist Jed 
Wentz (a consistently appealing flow of liquid tone), violist Claudia Steeb, 
cellist Phoebe Carrai and harpsichordist Andreas Spering. 
</P>
<P>
During a presentation that invited the mind to wander, the thought came -- 
hardly for the first time -- that traveling performers are under a 
misapprehension about our exposure to core 18th-Century repertory in period 
performance. We are in fact unjaded, Los Angeles having had minimal concert 
experience with such giants as J.S. Bach, Handel, Corelli, Vivaldi. We are, 
however, getting to know the dwarves quite well. HERBERT GLASS

'HIGH FIDELITY' EXPLORES GUARNERI QUARTET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diversity within unity is probably the central paradox and glory of chamber 
music. Each part must be heard clearly and distinctively, yet be perfectly 
integrated into the collective effort. 
</P>
<P>
This is the theme of "High Fidelity -- The Adventures of the Guarneri String 
Quartet," currently at the Monica Theatre for a two-week run. 
</P>
<P>
Director Allan Miller explores the subject not in music directly. Instead, he 
tracks the interpersonal relationships of the players, violinists Arnold 
Steinhardt and John Dalley, violist Michael Tree and cellist David Soyer. 
</P>
<P>
Filmed during the ensemble's 1987-88 season, "High Fidelity" follows the 
musicians individually and as a group, in tenacious pursuit of the mysteries of 
successful collaboration. Almost every moment is focused in some way on the 
question of how the Guarneri has held together for 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
The answers articulated -- respect for each other, passion for the music, thick 
skins, money, clear separation of private and ensemble lives -- are ultimately 
unconvincing next to those demonstrated. Much has been written about the 
Guarneri, but here we can witness the group dynamics at play for ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
The result is consistently engaging, although the inherent redundancies of 
addressing nearly every issue and scene in quadruplicate bog things down in the 
middle. Dyanna Taylor's camerawork captures the amazing mixture of candor and 
reticence unobtrusively, and the film establishes its own almost musical rhythm 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
Music itself, though plentiful, is heard only in snippets or background. Why 
the longevity and success of this particular group should matter is assumed 
rather than demonstrated. Indeed, what the quartet does is not the issue here, 
as much as how it survives on a human level. 
</P>
<P>
That dimension, however, is endlessly fascinating, and is what makes "High 
Fidelity" so accessible and important even for audiences that would not 
normally find themselves at a chamber music concert. The joy of the doing is 
apparent throughout the film, in both the loving work of the Guarneri and 
Miller and his team, and translates for us into the joy of the viewing.

'STORM' SCALES THE HEIGHTS OF SISTERHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The trouble with most mountain-climbing adventure stories is characterization. 
All those climbers with their goggles, parkas, pickaxes and backpacks are hard 
to tell apart, especially in a blizzard. 
</P>
<P>
Shot in the icy Austrian Alps, "Storm and Sorrow," on Lifetime cable tonight at 
9, happily manages to showcase some individuality because of its feminine 
angle. 
</P>
<P>
The central figure is based on the American climber Molly Higgins. Leigh 
Chapman's script, adapted from the diary material in the book "Storm and 
Sorrow" by Robert Craig, charts Higgins' frosty welcome by her uptight male 
teammates and her subsequent rite of passage at a 1974 international 
mountain-climbing expedition held in the Soviet Union at Peak Lenin in the 
Pamirs near the Chinese-Afghan border. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins is played by a svelte Lori Singer, who scampers up sheer rock and ice, 
her blond tresses outlined against the wintry horizon like a Nordic Spider 
Woman. The Austrian locations and the avalanches and the loss of life among the 
climbers are dramatically captured by executive producer Hans Proppe and 
director Richard Colla. 
</P>
<P>
The production, which shot its interior scenes in Hungary, recalls in its 
chilling mountain scenes another odyssey on the icy faces of the Austrian Alps, 
Clint Eastwood's "Eiger Sanction" (1975). 
</P>
<P>
The rugged male actors in "Storm and Sorrow" look tiresomely alike (imagine an 
open audition for a Marlboro ad), but the women are refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
Fueling the feminine theme is a subplot about the true-to-life female Soviet 
mountain-climbing team at the same expedition, in whom unity is seen as a much 
stronger component than in the fractured egos of the American male climbers.Ray 
Loynd

ANGELIC 'CLARENCE' A 'WONDERFUL LIFE' SPINOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Family Channel premieres a movie about a guardian angel, "Clarence," at 8 
tonight. Robert Carradine's entitled angel is an ingenuous character arriving 
from heaven to save a suicidal mother and her children from ruin. 
</P>
<P>
If that sounds familiar, it's because the plot is a variation of Frank Capra's 
"It's a Wonderful Life." Even closer at hand, "Clarence" is a moderately 
flavorful spinoff of the 1977 TV movie remake of the Capra classic called "It 
Happened One Christmas," which starred Marlo Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
"Clarence" has a piquant touch, and director Eric Tull and writers Lorne 
Cameron and David Hoselton create a children's picture-book heaven in the 
opening sequences with a youthful head angel dispatching the reluctant 
Carradine to Earth, looking snappy in a trench coat. 
</P>
<P>
As a Thanksgiving show, families could do a lot worse than "Clarence," and for 
young viewers who don't know about the genre's antecedents (such as those '40s 
classics "Heaven Can Wait" and "Stairway to Heaven"), this production has 
sufficient fantasy to nudge the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Carradine is self-effacing and angelic, and Kate Trotter is earnest as the 
widowed wife battling to save her video-game company. The script's payoff could 
be stronger; the tone is a shade too fragile. But you do understand the 
flustered chief angel up there when he looks through the clouds at one of his 
file clerks in the opening moments and says, "The way the world is these days, 
our guardian angels are working overtime as it is." RAY LOYND

<P>
Appearing in Municipal Court for a hearing to review the status of his 
probation, Sagon Penn was ordered to find another psychological counselor after 
it was revealed that he was "suspicious" of his current therapist. 
</P>
<P>
Penn was ordered to undergo counseling as part of his probation in a 1989 case 
in which he was convicted of vandalizing a motorcycle belonging to a friend of 
his ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing a letter from Penn's psychologist, Municipal Judge William H. 
Woodward said Wednesday that there was a "doctor-patient problem." 
</P>
<P>
Saying another six months of counseling sessions would be "helpful," Woodward 
ordered Penn to return to court Dec. 20 to report on his choice of a new 
psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
Woodward said Penn could terminate his sessions with his current doctor because 
of "a certain degree of suspicion being maintained by Mr. Penn." 
</P>
<P>
Penn, 28, was acquitted in two trials of the 1985 shooting deaths of a police 
officer and a civilian ride-along. Penn, who has had a number of brushes with 
law officers since the highly publicized trials, is facing a Nov. 30 trial on a 
felony charge of altering court documents.

UC San Diego Chancellor Richard C. Atkinson has approved plans for a 
controversial six-acre recreational complex on the La Jolla campus that, with 
more than 200,000 square feet for parking, intramural, athletic and concert 
activities, would become UCSD's largest structure. Campus faculty members, 
through their Academic Senate, had asked Atkinson to require revisions because 
of concerns over noise and traffic factors caused by the concert portion of the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
But Atkinson said environmental concerns can be adequately handled, especially 
since most events would take place during night or weekend hours, when few 
competing academic activities would be taking place. The center, planned for 
the north campus area next to the Institute of the Americas, will cost $28 
million. It would be funded through a combination of students fees and 
donations from private individuals. State tax money cannot be used for such 
facilities.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An inmate at the County Jail in Vista died at Tri-City Medical Center after 
hanging himself with a telephone cord in a holding cell at the jail, the 
Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Armando Ramirez Rabago, 28, of Vista was found unconscious about 11 p.m. 
Tuesday by deputies who were conducting a nightly count of all inmates, said 
Lt. E. J. Lubic of the Vista jail. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies performed CPR with no response, and Rabago was taken by ambulance to 
the Oceanside hospital. He died Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Rabago, who was unemployed, was arrested in Vista Monday night in connection 
with a 1983 murder and was brought to the jail about 9:30 p.m., Lubic said. 
Deputies booked him but did not complete the classification process that would 
place him in more permanent housing in the jail, because other duties took 
precedence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Rabago appeared in court for arraignment and was ordered to return 
to court Wednesday, Lubic said. When Rabago was brought back to the jail late 
Tuesday evening, he was placed in a holding cell and the classification process 
was reinitiated by a deputy. 
</P>
<P>
The process was interrupted by deputies making their nightly count, Lubic said. 
Rabago was left alone for a short time in the concrete cell, one of several on 
the first floor equipped with a wall phone, Lubic said. 
</P>
<P>
A coroner's examination was planned.

BATES PINS LAST HOPE ON A VOTE RECOUNT; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: CONGRESSMAN TO PAY FOR CHALLENGE OF 'PROVISIONAL' BALLOTS IN HIS 
NARROW LOSS TO CUNNINGHAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raising questions about the legality of some of the ballots cast, Rep. Jim 
Bates on Wednesday formally requested a recount of this month's 44th 
Congressional District, in which he was narrowly defeated by Randall (Duke) 
Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
In an admittedly last-gasp bid to retain the seat he has held since 1982, the 
San Diego Democrat informed county Registrar of Voters Conny McCormack that he 
is willing to pay for a recount that will focus on the propriety of an 
undetermined number of so-called "provisional" ballots cast in the Nov. 6 race. 
</P>
<P>
Barring the unlikely wholesale disqualification of those ballots, chances are 
slim that the recount will reverse Bates' 1,665-vote upset loss to Cunningham 
in his southern San Diego district. Final official vote totals released 
Wednesday by the registrar's office showed that Cunningham outpolled Bates, 
50,377 votes (46.3%) to 48,712 votes (44.8%), with about 9,600 additional 
ballots going to two minor-party candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Provisional ballots are ones cast at polling places on Election Day about which 
there are validity questions, usually for one of two reasons. If, for example, 
a person claims to be a registered voter but is not listed on a particular 
polling place's roster, he is allowed to cast a provisional ballot, which is 
counted only after election officials later confirm that the individual is, 
indeed, registered. 
</P>
<P>
Other individuals who show up to vote may have previously requested an absentee 
ballot, which causes an "A" to be placed next to their name on the polling 
place's list. Unless they turn over the uncompleted absentee ballot to polling 
officials, they, too, must vote via a provisional ballot, which later is 
checked against absentee ballots to verify that the person did not vote twice. 
</P>
<P>
In asking for the recount, Bates aide Dena Holman said, the congressman was 
motivated primarily by "questions involving the reconciliation of provisional 
ballots (which) were left unanswered by the registrar" in tabulating the votes 
in the 44th District. 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant Registrar Ingrid Gonzales said election officials feel confident 
that they properly verified the authenticity of the provisional ballots that 
were counted. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't leave any questions unanswered in our mind," Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
If the recount simply reconfirms his loss, Bates would have one final option 
available: a legal challenge to the provisional ballots. That possibility will 
hinge largely on whether the recount demonstrates any widespread problem with 
the provisional ballots, as well as on the practical consideration of whether a 
large enough number were cast to affect the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
The recount, expected to start next week, will cost Bates' campaign committee 
an estimated $1,640 per day and last about nine days, Gonzales said. If the 
initial stages of the recount do not change the vote totals, causing Bates to 
conclude that proceeding with it would be fruitless, he could withdraw his 
request at any time in order to save money.

TV INTERVIEW WITH 8-YEAR-OLD SPARKS LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the morning of Sept. 6, 1989, 8-year-old Alison Schwartz, her sister and two 
of their friends were walking to school along a canyon trail in Scripps Ranch 
when a knife-wielding man jumped out of the shrubbery. He threatened to kill 
them unless they followed him into the bushes. 
</P>
<P>
When the attacker was distracted by a sudden noise, Alison and her friends 
escaped, running the rest of the way to school. Later that morning, the man 
molested an 11-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Alison, standing on the school playground surrounded by her 
excited friends, told a reporter from KFMB-TV Channel 8) about the incident, 
setting in motion a string of events that has landed the television station in 
court and raised serious issues about the media's handling of minors. 
</P>
<P>
Alison's parents sued the station, News Director Jim Holtzman and reporter John 
Culea for airing the interview, charging them with negligence, infliction of 
emotional distress and invasion of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Channel 8, which has vigorously denied any wrongdoing, 
endangered Alison and the family by putting the girl on television. At the time 
the interview aired, the molester was still at large. (In November, 1989, Rudy 
Isaguirre, a 24-year-old Navy man, was convicted of an array of sex crimes.) 
</P>
<P>
Channel 8 representatives didn't want to comment on the case, but in court 
documents, KFMB attorneys argue that the First Amendment protects the station's 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
"The information provided in the news story was a matter of legitimate public 
concern, was newsworthy, was a fair and true report of information of 
legitimate public concern and access," the attorneys wrote in response to the 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Legally, there was nothing preventing the station from using the interview with 
Alison. However, the suit, which seeks $1 million in general damages, alleges 
that Channel 8 acted unethically by not considering the danger to Alison. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you ever felt pure fear?" Steven Schwartz, Alison's father, asked in a 
recent interview. "When I saw my kid's picture on TV, it was pure fear." 
</P>
<P>
In what should be the key argument of the case, the Schwartz family contends 
that an 8-year-old does not have the maturity to decide whether or not to be 
interviewed by a television reporter. The station, the suit argues, should have 
used the same discretion it uses when a juvenile is accused of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
"A juvenile accused of a crime is protected, but a juvenile victim is not," 
Schwartz said, referring to the common practice of the media of not using the 
names of juveniles involved in anything but the most serious criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Pederson, the attorney representing the Schwartz family, says the case, 
which has been assigned an April trial date, boils down to "constitutional 
freedom of the person versus the rights of minors to be protected from 
intrusions that may be harmful." 
</P>
<P>
Pederson acknowledged that it will be "difficult to overcome the constitutional 
aspects" of the case. The courts are often reluctant to make any decision that 
may be perceived as limiting the freedom of the press in any way. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not aware of anything in the Constitution that says you can't do it (air 
such an interview) or any statute in California," Pederson said. "But there is 
always the doctrine that says you have to be reasonable and prudent in dealing 
with other people." 
</P>
<P>
Because Alison was at school, it will be difficult for Pederson to prove there 
was an invasion of privacy, according to San Diego attorney Greg Roper, who 
specializes in First Amendment issues. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no secret information being revealed," Roper said. "Usually what has 
happened in the past is that a case is dismissed unless there is wrongful 
publication, based on invasion of privacy or defamation." 
</P>
<P>
However, the involvement of a minor may throw a twist into the case. 
</P>
<P>
"It may well be an issue," said Tracy Westen, an assistant professor at USC's 
Annenberg School of Communication, who has a degree in law. "Children can't 
marry, they can't drive, they certainly can't enter into a contract. It's hard 
to argue that they can understand the privacy issues of consenting to an 
interview." 
</P>
<P>
Pederson agrees with Channel 8 that Alison's story had legitimate news value. 
Her description of a suspected child molester was worth putting on the news. 
But he argues that the station could have used the salient facts without 
exposing Alison to danger. 
</P>
<P>
"Channel 8 and John Culea did not have the right, even under the Constitution, 
without prior approval from an adult, to interview that child and put her 
likeness on television, when they knew, or should have known, that that 
broadcast could conceivably endanger that child," Pederson said. 
</P>
<P>
In his pretrial deposition, Culea was asked point-blank if it occurred to him 
that the broadcast could jeopardize the children. "No, it didn't," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody down there should have given it some thought," Pederson said. 
</P>
<P>
Lois Kosch, an attorney for Channel 8, didn't want to comment on specifics of 
the case, but she did acknowledge that Channel 8's decision to use Alison's 
name would certainly be an issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Her name was a matter of public record," Kosch said. 
</P>
<P>
Because Alison was not a victim of molestation or a direct witness to an 
incident, the report of the threat against her and her friends was handled by 
the police as a record open to the public, Kosch said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Schwartz and Pederson contend that the news report, broadcast to 
thousands of San Diegans, put Alison in far more danger than her name on a 
police report. 
</P>
<P>
In general, news organizations establish their own guidelines for using names 
and photos. For example, in the cases of rape victims, it is generally accepted 
that the name of the victim will not be used, and television stations usually 
don't use the victim's photo. Identifying witnesses is a far more gray area, 
but generally in sensitive cases the witnesses' names are not used. 
</P>
<P>
The courts rarely impose any restrictions on the media, except in certain cases 
where the judge makes a specific request for names not to be used. Even in 
those cases, it is not unusual for the media to challenge the order. 
</P>
<P>
Within the TV news industry, the use of names and photos of victims and 
witnesses is a common topic of discussion. Like Channel 8, the other three TV 
news operations in San Diego don't have set policies concerning these types of 
situations. Representatives of each station said the issues are handled on a 
case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on what kind of light you're showing the juvenile in," said KNSD-TV 
(Channel 39) News Director Don Shafer. "We try not to use them (juveniles) at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
In general, the case of a child witness would "fall into the same general 
category of us not identifying rape victims," said Warren Cereghino, news 
director of KTLA (Channel 5) in Los Angeles. "If you're going to put somebody 
at risk, you have to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, the subjects are photographed from the rear or their faces are 
electronically obscured to hide their identity. 
</P>
<P>
"A child is so vulnerable to abuse by adults," Cereghino said. "In general 
terms, I think there has to be some sensitivity and awareness of the 
possibility that a child is so close to this type of danger." 
</P>
<P>
If Pederson and the Schwartz family can prove their case, it could affect the 
way television news handles minors. Any interview with someone under the age of 
18 might have to be examined with new wariness, said Cathy Clark, assistant 
news director of KUSI-TV (Channel 51). 
</P>
<P>
"It's the whole issue of what is invasion of privacy and at what point does a 
person have the smarts to be interviewed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Should the Schwartz case make it to trial -- out-of-court settlements or 
outright dismissals on technical grounds are not unusual in such cases -- legal 
issues far more mundane than the freedom of the press versus the rights of 
minors probably will be the focus of much of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
For example, it is clear from court records that the sides will argue 
vehemently over whether Culea had permission from an adult, implied or 
otherwise, to interview the children on school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
In court documents, Channel 8's attorneys argue that when the principal of 
Jerabek Elementary School gave Culea permission to enter school grounds, it 
implied permission to interview students, even though Culea acknowledges that 
he never specifically asked for permission to do interviews. 
</P>
<P>
There also is the question of whether the family was actually damaged by the 
report. Because the plaintiffs are asking for damages based on emotional 
distress, Channel 8 attorneys in pretrial depositions have focused on the 
psychological makeup of the Schwartz family to determine if there actually was 
any "emotional distress." 
</P>
<P>
Steven Schwartz thinks Channel 8 is simply trying to muddle the main issues. A 
year after the broadcast, he is still angry. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely think they violated my daughter's civil rights," he said.

Mozart Mania: A Mozart manuscript that had been locked away in a Philadelphia 
seminary since the early 19th Century sold Wednesday for $1.7 million at a 
Sotheby's auction in London. The International Mozarteum Foundation in 
Salzburg, Austria, Mozart's birthplace, said that it had purchased the 
manuscript with financial support from the Austrian government and the city. 
The price for the manuscript of the "Fantasia and Sonata in C Minor" equaled 
the world record for a single musical work set in 1989 for the score of a 
Schumann piano concerto.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: DIRECTOR O'BRIEN STEPS OUT ON 
CENTER STAGE FOR 'LETTERS'

It's been 21 years since he last performed on stage, but Jack O'Brien, 
director, has decided to take a chance on Jack O'Brien, actor, in the Old Globe 
production of A.R. Gurney's "Love Letters." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, who wears a third hat as artistic director of the Old Globe Theatre, 
plays the part of Andrew Makepeace Ladd III, opposite Michael Learned's Melissa 
Gardner through Sunday. There will be no performance today. 
</P>
<P>
When told that many people around town have expressed interest in checking out 
his performance, he laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a touch of vindictiveness in that, I think," he said last week as he 
was preparing for the part. "Now that my parents are dead, I can't imagine 
anyone coming to it." 
</P>
<P>
But come they did, filling the Old Globe main stage to near capacity on a 
Monday night. It wasn't the most memorable performance this critic has seen of 
this love story -- the reading was more intelligent and charming than 
passionate -- but the fans applauded loud and long. 
</P>
<P>
The last time O'Brien set foot on stage -- in 1969 -- also was at the Old Globe 
Theatre. But that was the unplanned result of an accident. The actor hired to 
play Dromio of Syracuse in "A Comedy of Errors" dropped out suddenly. O'Brien, 
who was directing the play, knew the part and therefore felt called upon to 
step in for the actor, performing opposite Christopher Walken, Sada Thompson 
and Jonathan McMurtry. 
</P>
<P>
It did not seem like such a departure for O'Brien to act at the time. He had 
considered himself an actor all through his college and early post-college 
years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a big singing voice for musical comedy. I thought of myself as a viable 
commodity until I looked in a mirror and saw my hair going south with my 
career." 
</P>
<P>
He also made a discovery about himself during his stint in "A Comedy of 
Errors." He was getting the job done -- well, as he recalls -- but he wasn't 
enjoying it. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew how to do it. I knew how to get the laughs. But I was frightened and 
unhappy, and it wasn't right for me. I was terrified to go on stage. Every 
entrance was traumatic. But I love to direct, and I love to watch actors work." 
</P>
<P>
Still, 21 years has a way of diluting fears, O'Brien said. He was drawn to the 
material in Gurney's "Love Letters" in much the same way he was drawn to the 
playwright's "The Cocktail Hour," which O'Brien directed in 1988, and the 
upcoming "The Snow Ball," which he will direct in 1991. O'Brien said that 
putting himself in an actor's shoes tests "those instincts I'm operating from 
in terms of supporting actors." 
</P>
<P>
And, most importantly, he was looking forward to having a good time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm older, more experienced, and I know what I am and what I can do and what I 
can't do. I don't think anyone is taking this seriously. It's Jack's big 
adventure. I just hope it's Jack's excellent adventure."

HERO REFUSED TO TURN AWAY FROM PERSECUTED; 
</P>
<P>
HOLOCAUST: AFTER MORE THAN FOUR DECADES OF OBSCURITY, GIORGIO PERLASCA HAS BEEN 
HONORED FOR PROTECTING THOUSANDS OF JEWS IN BUDAPEST. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the waning days of World War II, Giorgio Perlasca bore witness to many 
atrocities. This is just one of them: 
</P>
<P>
On the night of Dec. 29, 1944, Perlasca, an Italian businessman in Axis-allied 
Hungary, could hear shots and shrieks coming from the Jewish ghetto. The next 
morning he was entrusted with the care of a survivor -- a Jewish girl naked 
except for an army overcoat. She told him that the victims had been tied 
together with barbed wire two by two, then forced by Nazis to walk naked 
through the snow from the ghetto to the Danube. 
</P>
<P>
There they were made to kneel on the riverbank, where each was killed by a shot 
in the neck. She had survived because the barbed wire that tied her to her 
sister had come loose. Realizing that one of them had a chance, they had agreed 
that both would fall into the river with the first shot. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, she swam to a bridge, climbed out and hid under a tree, where she was 
found by a member of the Hungarian military, who covered her and handed her 
over to Perlasca, a known protector of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Perlasca willingly recounts each detail -- but not how it made him feel. He had 
long before numbed himself to the everyday horror of the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, nothing was new," he said. "We were used to that kind of thing. 
But we were happy to bring her home. She didn't even have a cold." 
</P>
<P>
In a September ceremony sponsored by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council and 
the Italian Embassy, Perlasca, 80, was the first to receive the council's 
highest honor, its Medal of Remembrance, for his activities protecting the Jews 
of Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
Until three years ago, when he was recognized by the Yad Vashem Holocaust 
Memorial in Jerusalem as one of the Righteous Among the Nations of the World, 
he was virtually unknown. Even his wife, Romilda, found his wartime stories 
hard to believe when he returned to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is offhand, even embarrassed about all the attention. A private man, he 
does not want to talk about the personal impact of his experiences in Budapest. 
Things happened so quickly then, he maintains. There was no time to think, to 
reflect, to be fearful. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't scared because I didn't have time to be afraid," he recalled. "As far 
as I was concerned, I was sure of the rightness of what I was doing, and I was 
sure things would go well. Unfortunately, they didn't. I wanted to do more." 
</P>
<P>
Perlasca, who was interviewed through an interpreter in Washington, was the 
representative of an Italian meat company in Eastern Europe. His life was like 
a traveling salesman's. He moved a lot, didn't see his wife much and when he 
wasn't traveling, he worked out of offices in a Budapest hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Then in March, 1944, the war came to Hungary, and with it, Perlasca's life 
changed. By October, protected by and acting for the Spanish Legation in 
Budapest, he would become responsible for the health and safety of thousands of 
Hungarian Jews threatened with deportation by the German occupation. 
</P>
<P>
Perlasca had already encountered difficulties with the government for having 
tried to protect the cargo he was sending to Italy from being declared war 
booty. 
</P>
<P>
In 1943, worried but unable to return home -- he would have had to go through 
Germany and was fearful that he'd be picked up at the border -- he initially 
sought Spanish protection. (As a soldier in an Italian regiment fighting for 
Franco during the Spanish Civil War, he'd been told to seek Spanish assistance 
if he ever needed it.) 
</P>
<P>
But in the spring, before he was able to pick up his papers, he was interned as 
an Italian loyal to the government of the king of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Internees were well treated -- even to luxuries such as pocket money and tea 
and cookies in the afternoon. Nevertheless, in October, he and a friend managed 
to escape and he made his way back to the Spanish Legation. "I wanted to 
survive," he said. "With a Spanish passport I felt set." 
</P>
<P>
When he went to pick up his passport, he saw throngs of Jews besieging the 
Spaniards for protection. By that time, the legation -- like those of other 
neutral nations -- was already officially protecting 300 Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Without thinking beyond the needs of the moment, he plunged in. "I saw the 
legation needed Christian personnel," he remembered. Everyone but the charge 
d'affaires "was a Jewish refugee." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Sanz-Briz, the Spanish charge d'affaires, explained that they couldn't 
pay him, but that was OK with Perlasca. He had enough money, a couple of places 
to live, and he felt a moral obligation to help the country that was protecting 
him by giving him citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
Sanz-Briz and Perlasca immediately went to the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs with two letters: one that identified him as an employee of the Spanish 
Legation and another that declared he was responsible for the Jews it was 
protecting. 
</P>
<P>
He started to work -- at what, he didn't know. The Jews needed food, shelter 
and at least the appearance of legitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
Did he realize that he was risking his life? "I don't think so," he said. "I 
didn't have time to think. If I had, I don't know what I would have done or how 
I would have behaved." 
</P>
<P>
Once the work started, he had even less time to think or for that matter to 
eat. He would lose 35 pounds in the next three months. As nothing had actually 
been organized, it was all his job: renting additional houses and apartment 
buildings, obtaining Spanish flags for the houses as well as for the large car 
in which he defiantly visited his protectees every day, making his presence not 
only obvious but virtually normal. The message he sent out was clear: The 
people in his houses were protected by Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
The number of Jews involved remains unclear, but Perlasca recalled that 
Hungarian newspapers of the day talked of 5,200 Jews under Spanish protection 
-- and all in 11 buildings where conditions were poor, food and water scarce. 
"The buildings were very crowded. People even lived in the stairways," he 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Perlasca estimates there were probably more than 5,200, and few who sought his 
aid were turned away. He even used his own money to obtain food when there was 
no other choice. When asked now if he had a particular talent for organizing 
people, he said: "I don't know if I did it well.I just did what I knew how to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Little in his life had prepared him for this. Born in Como in North Italy, he 
was raised a Catholic in what he persistently describes today as a normal 
family. 
</P>
<P>
The six children were brought up with the basic feeling that all men are "more 
or less" equal. ("You have to make some distinctions," he explained. "I don't 
consider someone who arrests and rapes young girls the same as me.") 
</P>
<P>
His father, who had a law degree, was a municipal secretary actively involved 
in his community. As a young man in Padua, Perlasca had several Jewish friends. 
But by 1944, he was mostly a man in his mid-30s trying to make a living in 
wartime Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Ramrod straight now, his dignified bearing, blue eyes and concern that he be 
able to shave properly before he has his picture taken make it easy to imagine 
the handsome young man he was when fate presented him with an opportunity to 
define himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a stranger in a strange country," said Miles Lerman, the chairman of 
the Holocaust Council's international relations committee, who sought out 
Perlasca a year ago, soon after learning about his activities. "He could have 
let the whole thing pass him by without taking risks, and like the rest of 
world stood idly by. He chose not to do that." 
</P>
<P>
In late November, Sanz-Briz was recalled. Perlasca was distraught. All they had 
worked for could be lost. The Germans had already started to empty the 
buildings under Spanish protection. 
</P>
<P>
With his Spanish credentials in hand, Perlasca made a daring choice: He told 
the authorities he was the new Spanish charge d'affaires. "I simply said I was 
the legal substitute. If I hadn't said that, they would have taken everyone 
away." 
</P>
<P>
He remembered having no particular plan, no extraordinary inspiration. "It was 
no special courage," he said. "It was just the result of events. I am not a 
hero. I am embarrassed by all this talk of courage." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, his tactics were not those of the timid. He regularly sought out 
audiences with German and Hungarian officials, somehow finding ways to retrieve 
Jews in custody. He combed the streets looking for those who needed help. He 
pointed out to Hungarians what could happen to their countrymen living in Spain 
if the governments crossed swords. 
</P>
<P>
His success and luck was considerable, perhaps as much as the better known 
Raoul Wallenberg, who was also in Budapest then, giving out letters of 
protection from a neutral nation (Sweden), and who in early January, 1945, 
asked Perlasca for protection. Perlasca agreed, but Wallenberg never turned up. 
Perlasca did not see him again. 
</P>
<P>
With the Soviet conquest of Budapest in February, Perlasca's activities ended. 
"At first they wanted to hang me," he remembered. Instead, for a while, he was 
forced to clean the streets and bury corpses. "But then I escaped. I've made 
that an art." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he made his way back to Italy. When he returned, his family and 
former employer found his stories barely credible. For 43 years, his work went 
unheralded. Three years ago, when he was contacted by Israeli officials, his 
family started to believe him. "And when they heard about this party, they were 
speechless," he said. 
</P>
<P>
From the Holocaust Council's point of view, its honor will not only validate 
Perlasca's experience, but prove that there were responses to the Holocaust 
other than turning away. Lerman said, "Perlasca's story proves that even under 
the most dreadful conditions, people can act in a godly manner if they choose 
to." 
</P>
<P>
But the question remains: Why did he do it? He doesn't know. He feels his 
activities were simply prompted by events. And that what he did to respond to 
those events was the decent thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after more than four decades of obscurity, perhaps there is a desire to 
relive those moments when his life ensured the lives of others. Perhaps there 
is a desire to be remembered. 
</P>
<P>
All Perlasca is sure of is that those days must be remembered.

Encouraging kids to read can be trickier than ever these days. Ask a 7-year-old 
to turn off the television long enough to pick up a new book from the library 
and she might consider reading to be punishment, not pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
Tell a 12-year-old that the book his class is reading, "The Secret Garden," was 
one of your favorites and he will eye it with suspicion. Could be like 
asparagus, he figures: Something you enjoy that he can't choke down, partly 
because it's supposed to be good for him. 
</P>
<P>
So how do you nudge without nagging? Try magazines. Kids love getting mail, and 
many of the magazines available today can entertain even the most reluctant 
reader. Now is the time of year to order holiday gift subscriptions -- a great 
way to take care of the grandchildren and nieces and nephews on your list. Many 
local libraries have reference copies of kids' magazines, if you want to browse 
before ordering. Here are some suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
Stone Soup, the magazine by children (ages 9-13). Founded in 1973, this is a 
literary magazine that publishes stories, book reviews, poems and art by 
children through age 13. Adults will be astonished by the quality and 
creativity. Kids are inspired to work on stories and art of their own after 
seeing what other kids their age can do. 
</P>
<P>
A recent issue features superb linocut prints by East German children, ages 9 
and 10. My favorite story was "The Kid Who Loved Baseball," which begins: "Once 
there was a boy named Michael J. Cangelosi. He loved, and I mean he just loved, 
baseball. You could tell by the number of baseball cards he had. He had about 
3,456. In fact, he had more baseball cards than any boy in the city of 
Cleveland, Ohio." 
</P>
<P>
Each issue, printed on high-quality paper, includes two pages of suggestions 
that parents and teachers might want to use to help readers write their own 
stories and create their own artwork. Contributions to Stone Soup are 
encouraged, and the editors say they respond within four weeks to all 
submissions. 
</P>
<P>
Stone Soup is published five times a year by the Children's Art Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Cricket, the magazine for children (ages 6-14). Cricket has something for just 
about everyone: short stories, cartoons, adventure stories based on real 
experiences, puzzles, science and nature projects and contributions by 
well-known authors and illustrators of children's books. 
</P>
<P>
A recent issue included entry information for a story contest, and it printed 
the winners of the summer poetry contest. Plus, they published 18 letters from 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
Ladybug, the magazine for young children (ages 2-7). Published by the same 
folks who put out Cricket, this made its debut in September. A monthly feature 
will be the series "Tom and Pippo," written and illustrated by Helen Oxenbury. 
</P>
<P>
The full-page artwork, simple games, cartoons and poems will keep younger kids 
intrigued for 15 to 20 minutes at a stretch, as long as parents share it with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Sesame Street Magazine (ages 2-6). No preschooler seems to get enough of Bert 
and Ernie, so here's a way to pull her away from the TV long enough to read 
stories starring her favorite characters. A recent issue includes a story mom 
or dad can read about finding clouds shaped like turtles and trains and 
alligators. 
</P>
<P>
There are several puzzles based on identifying shapes, plus a game about 
shadows that kids can cut out. 
</P>
<P>
Every issue of Sesame Street comes with a Parent's Guide that includes an 
advice column, kids' book reviews and articles on health and safety. A recent 
54-page issue also had advice on building kids' self-esteem and encouraging 
fantasy.

Dictionaries have entered the age of specialization. 
</P>
<P>
The general dictionary, which has been a reference workhorse for many years, is 
being augmented by specialized dictionaries that provide information on fields 
as varied as literature, food, mathematics and banking. 
</P>
<P>
The "Dictionary of American Literary Characters" (Facts on File), for example, 
"concentrates exclusively on American Literature." Edited by Benjamin Franklin 
V, the hefty volume "spans nearly two centuries: from 1789, the date of the 
first American novel, 'The Power of Sympathy,' to 1980, when Norman Mailer's 
'The Executioner's Song' won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction." 
</P>
<P>
The book identifies, in alphabetical order, 1,100 characters from "significant 
American novels, in addition to those in some uncelebrated works and in a 
sampling of best sellers." 
</P>
<P>
For example, a look under "Ishmael" shows he was the narrator and sole survivor 
"of the Pequod's pursuit of Moby Dick in Herman Melville's 'Moby Dick.' " 
</P>
<P>
Other specialized dictionaries issued recently include: 
</P>
<P>
"Webster's New World Dictionary of Media and Communications," compiled by 
Richard Weiner. This volume's aim is "to attempt to define specifically the 
terms from the many diverse worlds of communications." For example, a 
"dingadinga" is a "low-power spotlight," while a "polecat" is "a small support 
for lamps used in studio photography." 
</P>
<P>
"Food Lover's Companion" (Barron's) by Sharon Tyler Herbst. The fat little book 
contains "comprehensive definitions of over 3,000 food, wine and culinary 
terms." A look at "chalazae" brings this definition: "Thick, cordlike strands 
of egg white which are attached to 2 sides of the yolk, thereby anchoring it in 
the center of the egg." 
</P>
<P>
"A Concise Dictionary of Mathematics" (Oxford University Press) by Christopher 
Clapham. The book is designed to "guide readers through the often bewildering 
maze of equations and theorems encountered within the mathematical world." An 
"algorithm," for example, is "a precisely described routine procedure that can 
be applied and systematically followed through to a conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
"Dictionary of Banking Terms" (Barron's) by Thomas P. Fitch. "Some 3,000 terms 
related to banking, finance and money management are listed alphabetically and 
defined." For instance, "footings" is the expression used "for the bottom line 
figure on a bank's balance sheet: total assets or liabilities, plus equity 
capital." 
</P>
<P>
"Melba Toast, Bowie's Knife &amp; Caesar's Wife: A Dictionary of Eponyms" 
(Avon) by Martin H. Manser. An eponym is defined as "a real or mythical person 
from whose name the name of a nation, institution, etc. is derived or is 
supposed to have been derived."

Homeless Rick is very thankful today. He figures to be so busy helping others 
enjoy their holiday that he won't have time to think about how miserable his 
Thanksgiving truly is. 
</P>
<P>
Rick, who declined to give his real name, is a clerk at the Midnight Mission in 
downtown Skid Row. He knows today will be frantic with phone calls, visits from 
more advantaged people bringing in meals and money for the homeless, and the 
continual line of men, women and children filing into the mission for a 
traditional turkey dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping busy, Rick reasons, is a way of forgetting about the pain he feels 
because he is destined to spend the holidays on "the Row," away from his family 
and his seven children. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to say that the holidays were just another day, but deep down inside, I 
know it's different," said the 43-year-old, his thin, freshly scrubbed face 
etched with sadness as he sat in an office at the mission. "That's the way a 
lot of people down here feel. They try to pretend it's just another day. 
</P>
<P>
"Because . . . what is Thanksgiving or Christmas when you're living in a box?" 
</P>
<P>
Rick's sentiments echoed the feelings of many denizens of Skid Row, of the 
estimated 5,000 people who make their home on the cold, hard pavement and of 
the social workers and store owners who cater to their needs. The holiday 
season, they said, is a time for most Skid Row regulars to block out memories 
of families left behind, prosperous jobs, good times with friends. Some may 
visit relatives who live close by for dinner, but others will stay away out of 
embarrassment or fear. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, the holidays make you want to be home," said Benjamin Cook, 30, who has 
been on Skid Row since January. His family lives just miles away in 
South-Central Los Angeles, but he will not be paying them a visit today or on 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very close, but very far away, if you catch what I'm saying," he said, 
running his hand through his uncombed hair and eating soggy oatmeal out of a 
Styrofoam cup on Los Angeles Street. 
</P>
<P>
Von Weems, 38, a longtime Skid Row resident, has a different outlook on the 
question of family. 
</P>
<P>
"My family's right here," he said determinedly, sitting on the steps of a 
building next to the Union Rescue Mission. He motioned to three figures on the 
ground who were covered with blankets. The blankets heaved deeply and regularly 
in a rhythm of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our family," Weems said with a slight slur. "We take care of each 
other. We enjoy what we have." 
</P>
<P>
It is possible to find along the bleak alleys and sidewalks that constitute the 
downtown Skid Row district a sense of seasonal optimism. Not unlike the 
retailers who anticipate hordes of holiday shoppers each year, Skid Row 
occupants look forward to a month of free handouts and more productive 
panhandling. Social workers anticipate an uptick in donations. Preachers expect 
more payoff from their sermons to the down-and-outers. 
</P>
<P>
"The mood is real high, and there's more togetherness among all the cliques, 
y'understand," said one gravel-voiced, five-year Skid Row veteran, who just 
referred to himself as Pete. 
</P>
<P>
"All the alcoholics are more together, all the dopeheads are more together. 
There's none of that down-and-out stuff." In addition, Pete added as he smiled 
through gapped teeth, "you also see more bottles on the street at this time 
than at any other time of year." 
</P>
<P>
Willie Davis, 41, could hardly contain his excitement: "All these people will 
come here, handing out $20 bills. I'll get all this new stuff, new clothing, 
new blankets. I like this time of year. I even put two Christmas trees in the 
street last year." 
</P>
<P>
Others were more jaded. 
</P>
<P>
"What the holidays really mean down here," said Mike Neely, head of the 
Homeless Outreach Program, a grass-roots organization that helps transients 
find shelter and clothing, "is that a large group of 'home' people get to come 
down there and feel good about themselves. There's all sorts of media 
attention, news cameras, radio-thons. Then after the holidays, it's all over. 
But these people who live down here have the same problems Jan. 15 that they 
had on Thanksgiving Day." 
</P>
<P>
He did not attempt to hide the edge in his voice. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some people said, the season can bring life-changing inspiration. "Some 
feel they want to make amends with their families, start all over," said David 
Bryant, a consultant with the city's Community Development Department Homeless 
Services Coordination Unit. 
</P>
<P>
But the blessings of the season must be weighed against the dreariness of 
everyday existence. When pressed, most people on the Row seemed to agree that 
Thanksgiving and Christmas are just as hard as any other day -- except that the 
food is better and there's more of it. 
</P>
<P>
As Clancy Imislund, managing director of the Midnight Mission, put it: "The 
mood just does not change dramatically during this time of year. Skid Row is 
not a place, but a state of mind." 
</P>
<P>
A Tuesday walk along Skid Row revealed little sense of a pending holiday. It 
was early morning and the soggy remains of a rainstorm the night before were 
still in evidence. Dirty, ragged blankets that had been soaked were drying on 
fences in front of parking lots and missions. Many people who had not found any 
sort of covering sat idly against a wall near Crocker and 5th streets, heads 
bowed toward their damp clothes. The nippy air was filled with cigarette smoke. 
</P>
<P>
In front of the Union Rescue Mission, five men sat on boxes, playing a raucous 
game of dominoes. One of them, James Campbell, 23, said this would be his first 
holiday on Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
"I thank God I'm here to witness Thanksgiving, but it's going to be very hard 
for me," said Campbell. He said that he's only been in town a month, and that 
he has been trying to make connections in the music industry to sell some 
lyrics he's written. 
</P>
<P>
He said the companionship on the Row was no substitute for his real family. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even know these guys," he said, pointing to his playing partners.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COALITION AIMS TO BLOCK EXPANSION OF 
LANDFILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A diverse coalition -- including environmentalists, representatives of local 
real estate boards, a dozen mayors and U.S. Rep. David Dreier -- on Wednesday 
announced it will work to block expansion of landfills in the San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't continue to be the receptacle of waste for the entire Los Angeles 
County," Dreier (R-La Verne) told the group in the City of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was organized by Dr. Forest Tennant, a landfill activist and former 
mayor of West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
Dreier said the group of more than three dozen opposes plans to expand 
landfills such as the one in Puente Hills, America's second-largest garbage 
dump operation. The San Gabriel Valley has four of the county's 10 working 
landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Dreier said the group will lobby in favor of proposals to haul trash on trains 
to remote desert areas.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL URGES THAT HALF OF APPOINTEES BE 
WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council unanimously approved a motion Wednesday urging 
that at least half of the mayor's appointees to city boards and commissions be 
women. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Chandler, a spokesman for Mayor Tom Bradley, said the mayor has "already 
made a very strong commitment to increase the number of women on commissions." 
</P>
<P>
He said that last summer, when Bradley appointed more than 30 commissioners, a 
majority were women. 
</P>
<P>
The motion was introduced by City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who cited a 70% 
male to 30% female disparity in appointments to the policy-making boards. 
</P>
<P>
"If our democratic institutions are to be truly representative, we must achieve 
balance and parity with the general population," Molina said. "At least 50% of 
our population is female. That should be reflected on our boards and 
commissions."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AIRPORT COMMISSIONERS DELAY SHUTTLE 
DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Airport Commissioners deferred a decision Wednesday on 
whether to lift an interim moratorium preventing enlargement of the passenger 
shuttle van fleet serving Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
An association of the largest shuttle van companies has filed suit against the 
board to keep the moratorium in place. The companies claim that the fleet has 
grown too large, resulting in slashed profits and cutthroat competition. The 
moratorium was enacted last September to allow the board to study ways of 
better regulating the shuttle van industry. 
</P>
<P>
The board's next meeting is scheduled for December.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN IS CONVICTED OF HELPING TO KILL GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jurors on Wednesday convicted a woman of second-degree murder for her part in 
helping a drifter kill a Chatsworth girl and shoot and sexually assault her 
companion. 
</P>
<P>
But the San Fernando Superior Court jury acquitted Marcia Lynn Ramos, 36, of 
first-degree murder, sparing her from possible death in the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos sat expressionless as the clerk read the eight verdicts, reached after 
eight days of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
The kidnaping took place as the girls were walking in their Chatsworth 
neighborhood to meet several friends at the corner of Devonshire Street and 
Lurline Avenue. Ramos emerged from the camper and asked them to help her start 
it. After they entered the vehicle, Ramos' companion, Raymond Comtois, abducted 
them at gunpoint, the surviving victim, who was 13 at the time, testified. 
</P>
<P>
Comtois shot both girls. One died instantly, but the other survived because her 
upraised hand deflected the bullet. Comtois, 61, was sentenced in July to die 
in the gas chamber.

LIKE A GARRULOUS PATRIARCH, TELEVISION NOW PRESIDES AT MOST HOLIDAY GATHERINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ah, holiday memories. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the year we couldn't afford a turkey, so Pa had to go out and shoot 
one? 
</P>
<P>
Or was that the Thanksgiving we visited "The Waltons"? 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the time those children got sick on Christmas Eve, so we all 
gathered at the orphanage and sang carols. 
</P>
<P>
Or was that the Christmas we spent with "Doogie Howser, M.D."? 
</P>
<P>
And what about that New Year's Eve we all got together and blew up the cruise 
ship that was holding Father Time hostage? Or was that "The A Team"? "Ozzie and 
Harriet"? 
</P>
<P>
Like much in our culture, American holiday traditions have become inextricably 
entangled with their televised versions. From the moment Grandpa clicks on the 
Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade till a bleary-eyed Aunt Ethel passes out during 
the Rose Bowl wrap-up, the American family is bombarded with video images of 
jive-talkin' turkeys and sincere sitcom Santas. Between today and the first of 
the year, the networks will broadcast an estimated 743,000 football games, and 
everyone from the New Kids on the Block to Dolly Parton will assault the nation 
with good cheer. 
</P>
<P>
So pervasive is this saturation, that holiday rituals themselves have changed; 
in some cases TV has become the ritual. And that's not always so merry and 
bright. 
</P>
<P>
The Zemlicka family of Manhattan Beach began a new holiday rite several years 
ago. Now, each Thanksgiving morning, Kellie Zemlicka gives her husband, Brian, 
a card that celebrates this meaningful new tradition. 
</P>
<P>
The card depicts a Thanksgiving table. At one end, a woman sits eating turkey. 
At the other, a man wearing a football helmet stares at a small television. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some of Kevin Aucello's fondest holiday moments radiate from 
the electronic hearth. "At Christmas, you're so psyched by all the shopping, 
all the wonder, all the products -- and TV shows are a part of that. They get 
you into the mood for all the good feelings." 
</P>
<P>
When he returns to his hometown in Florida this Christmas, he and his family 
will probably gather to watch "Miracle on 34th Street" or "Babes in Toyland." 
But the "big three" events of the holiday season remain "Rudolf the Red-Nosed 
Reindeer," "The Grinch Who Stole Christmas," and "Frosty," the 31-year old San 
Diego banker says. 
</P>
<P>
And since he doesn't go home until Christmas week, he has had to modify his 
holiday ritual a bit. "Now I call up one of my buddies and say, 'Rudolf's' on 
tonight. What are you doing?.' " 
</P>
<P>
The TV set has become as integral as the Thanksgiving turkey or the Christmas 
tree to America's holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
"Television does not reflect culture any more, it is our culture. It's at the 
center of everything we do," says Neil Postman, author of "Amusing Ourselves to 
Death" and chair of the Department of Communications at New York University. 
"Every tradition, every icon, every personage that is central to the culture 
really comes to us through television now, and television, of course, 
transforms them in the process." 
</P>
<P>
That's what happens in the current film "Avalon," which follows a large 
inter-generational family of immigrants over the course of several decades. 
</P>
<P>
As the movie unfolds, the family celebrates three Thanksgiving dinners, 
separated by untold years. The first scene, before television, is a cacophony 
of family chatter, laughter, and the sort of storytelling that binds people 
with a shared mythology. At the second Thanksgiving, some years later, a 
television flickers in the living room as the huge clan, already beginning to 
unravel, shares its meal in the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
And at the third dinner, the cluster of cousins and aunts and nephews and 
grandparents that once held regular family circle meetings has disintegrated, 
and a lone young couple and their children silently eat Thanksgiving dinner on 
TV trays, transfixed by a glowing television screen. 
</P>
<P>
Family therapists who have seen that scene find it rich with significance. But 
none is willing to point the finger directly at television as a holiday 
home-wrecker. Nor are most families. 
</P>
<P>
"In my family, if there's a holiday meal, and say, the Rose Bowl game is on, 
it's a tossup as to whether to eat around the table or eat in the family room 
and watch the game," says Kenneth Sereno, an associate professor of 
communications at USC, and an expert on family communication. 
</P>
<P>
That contrasts sharply with the holiday meals Sereno, 55, recalls from his 
childhood. Back then, the family, like the family in "Avalon," would converse 
and share stories. 
</P>
<P>
"But I didn't think we had much sparkling conversation. We ate, and there was 
routine small talk. It wasn't particularly exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Schreiner, a Mt. Washington screenwriter and former director of the 
Groundlings improvisational troupe, has seen television change the dynamics of 
his large Catholic family. But not necessarily for the worse. 
</P>
<P>
Each holiday season, he and his wife Dana and their son join his parents and 
his seven brothers and sisters and their spouses and their children at the 
family home in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that the big dinners, Thanksgiving, and all those holidays were 
very much oriented around traditional things: Thinking back over the year, 
discussing accomplishments. . . , " he says. 
</P>
<P>
The one family ritual that hasn't changed is Christmas Eve. The Schreiners 
still attend midnight Mass en masse, and then return home to sing Christmas 
carols around a fire. 
</P>
<P>
But when his father retired from his practice as a physician, he also retired 
his lifelong disgust with televised football. Now "the holiday season is 
oriented around what the NFL teams are doing that day," Schreiner says. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't bother Schreiner, even though he isn't a big football fan. 
Because at least it gives the family another reason to congregate. "That 
ballgame is going to be watched come hell or high water, and if you want to 
hang with the gang, you've gotta watch. It hasn't really displaced anything in 
our holiday proceedings, it's a new event," Schreiner says. 
</P>
<P>
But some observers lament the passing of un-mediated traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, virtually every human tribe would gather around the campfire at 
important moments to sing and dance and tell stories, says Michael Real, chair 
of the Department of Telecommunications and Film at San Diego State University. 
These gatherings allowed them to feel each other's presence and share what the 
particular event was about -- whether it was preparing for battle or the 
harvest or a religious holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Now, at traditional holidays -- and created ones such as the Super Bowl -- 
folks gather around their surrogate fires in huge numbers, Real says. But while 
that experience may create a sense of mass solidarity, it doesn't foster deep 
connections between people, nor does it instill the same rich mythology. 
</P>
<P>
In his book "Prime Time Society," University of Michigan anthropologist Conrad 
Kottak examines the way the rise of television can change the way a society 
celebrates holidays -- in one example, the way Brazil celebrates Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
There, as here, Kottak found, television's effects are "comparable to those of 
humanity's most powerful institutions -- family, church, state, and education." 
</P>
<P>
In Brazil, Christmas was traditionally an intimate religious holiday, 
celebrated locally and without much razzmatazz. Since television spread into 
the majority of households, though, Christmas has become a national event -- 
"an occasion for spending large sums of money on gifts and feasting," Kottak 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
And while sales statistics suggest that this new tradition has made Brazil's 
retailers jolly, older citizens lament the loss of more private rituals. 
</P>
<P>
The motivations behind the ho-ho-hoopla are easy to guess, however. "It is 
easier for manufacturers to plan products to appear at a particular season than 
to stagger production and distribution," Kottak writes. Also, "fads, which 
stimulate sales, are easier to sustain for a few weeks than a year." 
</P>
<P>
So it's little wonder that instead of menorahs and mangers, Brazilian families 
now encounter popular Christmas icons each time they turn a channel -- 
including one department store's team of Santas, who fan the holiday spirit by 
clapping wildly and bounding around on trampolines. 
</P>
<P>
Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
In America, says Postman, "There still exist family and regional traditions 
that have little to do with television, but they're increasingly on the 
periphery of the culture. The main events occur on television. Television 
really gives us the images of what Thanksgiving and Christmas should be like. 
It tells us what we should eat, what we should wear, if we should sing songs. 
It defines what family means." 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the pervasive media celebration has sandblasted away the 
finer edges of families' unique rituals. One often-cited example is the Jewish 
holiday of Hanukkah. Historically a relatively low-key event, it is 
increasingly accompanied by distinctly Christmas-like hype and fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
In a country as ethnically diverse as the United States, this homogenization is 
troublesome, says Janine Roberts, associate professor of family therapy at the 
University of Massachusetts. Most cultures have a unique way to mark the winter 
solstice, for example. Yet some of her clients, including immigrants from 
Puerto Rico and Vietnam, complain that the televised flurry of American holiday 
images excludes their less mainstream traditions and obliterates the quiet 
power of old-fashioned storytelling. Children in particular, begin to doubt the 
validity of their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all the ersatz warmth and good will emanating from the set can 
injure more than a family's aesthetic sensibilities, some therapists warn. 
"Holiday blues," for instance, can be triggered or exacerbated by all those 
perfect families laughing and singing and sharing expensive gifts on the tube. 
</P>
<P>
Dysfunctional families, lonely widows, divorced men, just about anyone who 
doesn't have a Cosby Christmas can "feel like like they're pressing their nose 
against the glass, looking at a life they can't share," says John Murray, the 
head of the Department of Human Development and Family Studies at Kansas State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Thoman, executive director of the Center for Media and Values at USC, 
suggests that families turn the tables on their television, using a video 
camera to record their family rituals in the form of a story, rather than 
letting the tube dictate their holiday rites. 
</P>
<P>
She also advises families that watch commercial television to "Be picky. Don't 
let it dominate the whole day like video wallpaper." And finally, she suggests 
that the family use the holiday season to examine and challenge the 
commercialism and materialism with which the media indoctrinate them 
year-round. "Don't just be recipients of the messages that we're nothing unless 
we have something else." 
</P>
<P>
In America, the television "has become a member of the family that has to be 
dealt with like any other member," she says. Most people, however, never 
acknowledge the new member, let alone examine how it affects them. "We'd like 
to see people take advantage of this new member of the family, and encourage it 
to be disciplined." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, there are an increasing number of Baby-Boom types who seem ready 
to pull the plug on their television-tied holiday traditions. 
</P>
<P>
In the '50s and '60s, "people were into streamlining everything," including the 
holidays, says Maureen O'Hara, a San Diego-area family therapist. Parents 
didn't have time to pass on recipes for plum pudding, or to teach the proper 
way to make Christmas wreaths. 
</P>
<P>
But now, O'Hara frequently encounters people of Baby Boom age and younger, who 
are eager to recapture those old pre-TV recipes and rituals. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the young families tend to botch things a bit, she says. It's 
not really their fault, though. 
</P>
<P>
If sister's singing around the Christmas tree has the odd inflections of a 
young Susan Dey, if decorating the tree evokes images of Hoss and Adam and 
Little Joe; if a heartfelt gift exchange resonates with the Dick Van Dyke 
Christmas scenes in "thirtysomething," it's no coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking the storytelling rituals that transferred information through 
generations, today's families get their nostalgia for pre-TV holiday 
traditions, as well as their information concepts of what those traditions 
should be, from their newest but most trusted family member: the television.

When we eat more than we need to on Thanksgiving, we're making powerful 
statements about who we are, who we're not and what we used to be. 
</P>
<P>
"Eating is the single most important activity in which we engage," says Sidney 
Mintz, an anthropology professor at Johns Hopkins University. 
</P>
<P>
"Eating becomes attached to the notion of holidays, which are special days, and 
what we eat is bound up with two parts of our sense of history." 
</P>
<P>
First, we remember childhood. "Eating at holidays reawakens our attachment to 
the people who used to feed us," Mintz says. 
</P>
<P>
Second, what we eat defines our cultural identity. "You are a part of something 
when you celebrate," he explains. "It's like saying, 'We are one people because 
of what we eat. They are not us because they don't eat it.' The foods of the 
holidays are the foods of distinction. They're flags we raise to say, 'This is 
who we are.' " 
</P>
<P>
So while we could dine just as well on a Dover sole or chicken cacciatore, 
chances are we won't. On Thanksgiving, we're all descendants of the Pilgrims 
and Indians; the food we want is distinctively American. 
</P>
<P>
Our habitual holiday overindulgence is reminiscent of our origins, too. In the 
old days, tribes for whom food normally was scarce celebrated special occasions 
with meals in which everyone ate to excess. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, overeating might hark back to something even more basic than tribal 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Like hibernating animals, we're light-sensitive creatures. We don't crawl into 
caves and sleep through the winter. 
</P>
<P>
But some of us suffer from something called seasonal affective disorder, 
according to Dr. David Neubauer of the Francis Scott Key Medical Center in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
This form of wintertime depression is accompanied by lethargy, sluggishness -- 
and a craving for quick-energy food such as carbohydrates. 
</P>
<P>
Neubauer notes that sweet potatoes, stuffing, pumpkin pie -- the Thanksgiving 
foods we're most likely to overindulge in -- are all high in carbs. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, holiday anthropology aside, the bottom line may be that we just like 
to eat. 
</P>
<P>
Eatings "is our most powerful drive, more powerful than sex," Mintz says. "If 
you don't want to eat, you're sick. If you stop altogether, you're dead.

THE PILGRIMS: STUFF OF MYTHS

In Jennie Brownscombe's popular painting of the First Thanksgiving, somber 
Pilgrims in Victorian clothes sit down to pray with half-naked Indians. 
</P>
<P>
What's wrong with this picture? 
</P>
<P>
Plenty, says Laurence Pizer, director of Pilgrim Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"America's perceptions of the First Thanksgiving are historically inaccurate," 
said Pizer, 44, as he looked at Brownscombe's 1914 interpretation of that first 
holiday. "This painting is a symbol of Thanksgiving for most Americans," but 
it's based more on whimsy than fact, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Pilgrims didn't wear black-and-white Victorian clothing. They dressed in the 
conventional style of that day, in trousers, shirts and dresses of various 
colors. We know Elder William Brewster (who, in the painting, leads the group 
in prayer) had a red vest and a purple vest. And, the Indians certainly didn't 
go around in the chilly New England autumn half-naked." 
</P>
<P>
Hanging from the walls here in Pilgrim Hall, one of the nation's oldest 
museums, are other paintings that give misleading pictures of Pilgrims and the 
way they lived. There are paintings that show the Pilgrims embarking for the 
New World from Delfthaven, Holland, the Mayflower crossing the Atlantic, the 
landing at Plymouth Rock on Dec. 21, 1620, and the First Thanksgiving at 
Plymouth the following fall. 
</P>
<P>
"These paintings make up the American myth about the Pilgrims," said Pizer. "We 
all grew up with the story illustrated in these depictions. (But) the paintings 
are better known for their romantic charm, rather than historical accuracy." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the paintings are 19th Century, the earliest, "The Landing of the 
Pilgrims" by Michael Felice Corne, from 1803. He was among the first artists to 
interpret the story of the Pilgrims. Corne shows Pilgrims stepping off the 
Mayflower onto Plymouth Rock. 
</P>
<P>
"The rugged coastline, feather-headdressed natives on shore and the variously 
garbed Pilgrims, some in British naval uniforms and others in French Revolution 
caps, are all products of Corne's imagination," said Pizer. 
</P>
<P>
Some paintings show Pilgrims disembarking from the Mayflower wearing breast 
plates. "Hardly believable. Breastplates were incredibly heavy," said Pizer. 
"Indians are pictured greeting Pilgrims when they arrived at Plymouth Rock. Not 
true. It was three months before Indians came out to visit." 
</P>
<P>
Pizer said popular books have always had accounts much like the paintings, what 
writers fancied, inconsistent with history. Nowhere is there mention in 
Pilgrims' journals of turkey being eaten at the harvest feast. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time of the year, geese would have been plentiful. They probably ate 
goose. They also ate deer provided by the Indians," Pizer added. 
</P>
<P>
Pizer walked a visitor through the stately Greek Revival granite mansion that 
is Pilgrim Hall. "This was the cradle that rocked Peregrine White, who was born 
on the Mayflower shortly after the ship anchored in Provincetown harbor," he 
said. In his journal "Of Plimoth Plantation," William Bradford describes 
Peregrine White as the "first of the English that was borne in these parts." 
</P>
<P>
It was in 1820, the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock, that the 
Pilgrim Society was organized in Plymouth "to exhibit and interpret the history 
of the Pilgrims and the colony and town they founded." The museum opened to the 
public in 1824. 
</P>
<P>
"Our aim as a scholarly institution is seeking anything that reveals the 
situation of the Pilgrims -- pieces of furniture, books, manuscripts, anything 
they owned, telling us what life was like, what they were like," said Pizer. 
</P>
<P>
The only known likeness of any of the Mayflower passengers hangs in Pilgrim 
Hall. It is a portrait of Edward Winslow, painted when he visited England in 
1651. No one knows what the other Pilgrims looked like. 
</P>
<P>
Pizer lifted a huge iron cooking pot off the museum floor. "This came over on 
the Mayflower. In all likelihood, it was used at the First Thanksgiving," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In one exhibit case is a sampler made by Myles Standish's daughter, Loara, when 
she was a teen-ager in 1653. It is the earliest known American sampler. Her 
verse reads: 
</P>
<P>
"Loara Standish is my name Lorde guide my hart that I may doe thy will, also My 
hands with such Convenient skill as may Conduce virtue void of Shame and I will 
give The Glory to thy name." 
</P>
<P>
Myles Standish's razor and sword are here, as are John Alden's and Gov. William 
Bradford's Bibles. There are chairs, dinnerware, tables, pewter, a cloak, a 
bead purse, a slipper and tools -- a hoe, an ax, a hand saw -- that belonged to 
Pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
There is a model of the Mayflower here, made in England in 1925, but it does 
little to answer any of the Mayflower mysteries. "There are so many mysteries 
about the Pilgrims. The Mayflower is one of them," said Pizer. "We do not know 
what the Mayflower looked like. We can only guess. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that it was an old ship, that it was 90 feet long and was like a taxi, 
hired by the Pilgrims for the voyage to the New World." 
</P>
<P>
Pilgrim Hall also has on display the remains of a 17th-Century vessel that 
carried transatlantic passengers from Europe to the New World, the 40-foot 
Sparrow-Hawk. 
</P>
<P>
The Sparrow-Hawk carried 20 passengers and crew. It sank in 1626 at Orleans, 50 
miles southeast of Plymouth on Cape Cod. A great storm uncovered the wreck in 
1862. The Pilgrim Society acquired the ribs, floor pieces and sides of the 
Sparrow-Hawk in 1889. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still collecting Pilgrim items from descendants, purchased through 
dealers and at auctions. One of our most recent acquisitions is a silver wine 
cup that belonged to William Bradford," said Pizer. 
</P>
<P>
Pilgrim Hall, which is on Court Street in downtown Plymouth (population 
41,000), has the largest collection of books, manuscripts and other written 
material about the Pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
This museum of Pilgrim treasures is three blocks from Plymouth Rock, the 
5-foot-long, 2-foot-tall rock the Pilgrims stepped on from their small boat 
when they first came ashore here. Today, the rock is protected by a portico of 
granite. 
</P>
<P>
"The story of the Pilgrims is just as fascinating today as it was in the past. 
They were a band of brave pioneers who accomplished incredible things, 
including the mere fact of survival," said Pizer. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 104 who made the voyage to Plymouth, 53 perished the first winter from 
exposure, starvation, and disease. It was the 51 who made it through that first 
cruel winter who held the harvest festival in the fall of 1621 that became this 
nation's First Thanksgiving.

PARENTS WARM UP TO HOMEWORK HOT LINE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: AN IRVINE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL'S NEW VOICE-MAIL SYSTEM IS PROVING AN 
UNQUALIFIED SUCCESS AT HELPING HARRIED PARENTS AND TEACHERS CONNECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Parents and pupils at an Irvine school have heard the future of homework and it 
sounds like this: 
</P>
<P>
Ring. Click. "Hellooo! Thank you for calling Los Naranjos School Parent 
Information Hotline. . . . Please enter your two-digit class number to receive 
information from your child's teacher at any time during this message." 
</P>
<P>
Computerized voice mail is the latest attempt to help harried parents and 
teachers connect -- a move seen by many as crucial to improving student 
achievement. So far, about 40 schools in a dozen states are experimenting with 
24-hour-a-day call-in systems. Irvine's homework hot line, installed in 
October, is the first in California. 
</P>
<P>
It is already a success, said Bruce Baron, principal of Los Naranjos Elementary 
School. 
</P>
<P>
"With 480 students at the school, we were getting 400 to 420 calls a night," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By calling the hot line on a touch-tone telephone and punching in a designated 
code, callers hear messages such as this from fifth-grade teacher Dinah 
Osborne: 
</P>
<P>
"For the spelling contract that's due tomorrow, parents give a pretest tonight. 
Please check over spelling sentences. In reading, we're finding out how a 
Chinese man is going to be innovative, even though he's blind. Tonight they 
will read the scenes." 
</P>
<P>
By pressing other numbers on the menu, parents can hear a monthly calendar 
update, PTA information, school site council information and a monthly 
principal's message. The system can be programmed to dial parents' homes with 
emergency messages about unscheduled school closings or late buses. 
</P>
<P>
It does not allow parents to leave their own messages for the teacher. Baron 
said the school has a secretary who takes messages, which discourages crank 
callers. 
</P>
<P>
The $10,000 system, a product of Nashville-based Advanced Voice Technologies, 
was underwritten by Pacific Telesis and Wells Fargo foundations connected with 
a school restructuring project, a pilot program to improve student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Los Naranjos was one of three California schools chosen because of its 
economically and culturally diverse student population. The other schools were 
in Oakland and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five percent of the Los Naranjos student population is made up of 
minorities, 40% are children of enlisted personnel at the Tustin Marine Corps 
Air Station and 20% are bused from areas that include Housing and Urban 
Development subsidized housing. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the methods Baron has used to reach parents, including newsletters and 
night meetings, "none sets up the same dynamics that this can," he said. "This 
is parents as teachers, a real powerful concept." 
</P>
<P>
The system is not designed to replace face-to-face parent-teacher contact. 
Instead, Baron said, it will improve communication, so that when parents and 
teachers do meet, the parents will be more comfortable. "This really takes away 
the mystery," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baron, a longtime advocate of parent involvement and co-author of the book, 
"What Did You Learn in School Today?" has programmed the system primarily for 
homework messages and what parents can do to help. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents have a greater influence on their child's success in school than any 
other factor. Even if they gave a child 15 minutes of undivided attention a 
day, it's more one-on-one help than most children are going to get in school." 
</P>
<P>
He believes information learned in school lodges in "long-term memory" during 
the process of summarizing and retelling. "We expect our kids to retain an 
incredible amount from school. If we don't give them the opportunity to retell 
that, then it's difficult to expect them to retain it in their long-term 
memory." 
</P>
<P>
The voice-mail system also reduces evening stress on both parents and children 
about what the homework assignment actually was. "This completely eliminates 
the nightly game of 'To Tell the Truth,' or 'Did You Remember?' " Baron said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the homework hot line, Dennis Corbett said he and his wife had to guess 
what their children, Jim, 7, and Steve, 5, had been assigned for homework. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they'd tell us, sometimes they wouldn't," he said. "It got to the 
point where it was fun to make mom and dad not know. I'd say, 'So, Jimmy . . . 
' and he'd say, 'I forgot' even before I'd ask him." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Corbett said, the family gathers around a speaker phone almost every day 
to hear what the teacher has to say. Once when they forgot to call, Jim 
"actually kind of sulked for a day." 
</P>
<P>
Audrey Lewis said her husband, Joe, who works in Chicago, calls the hot line 
once a week to stay informed about what his daughter, Casey, 5, and son, 
Garrett, 7, are learning in class. "When he talks to the kids, he can say, 'Oh, 
did you do this in school?' " 
</P>
<P>
Research has not yet proven a link between giving homework information to 
parents and improved test scores for their children, which many consider the 
bottom line, said Jerold Bauch, an education professor at Vanderbilt University 
who has been researching electronic communications between teachers and parents 
for three years. 
</P>
<P>
"To try to isolate the effect of this particular innovation on something as 
global as student achievement scores in the short term is unlikely," he said. 
However, he said, teachers have reported that homework completion rates, and 
grades based on those rates, "go way up." 
</P>
<P>
Without the system, teachers typically reach only two or three parents a day, 
Bauch said. Among the schools experimenting with electronic communication, 
anywhere from a third to half the parents call in daily to retrieve the 
messages, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In one Nashville school, he said, the most frequent callers were low-income 
parents who had not been involved in school activities before. One mother who 
worked a 4 to 11:45 p.m. shift called the system at night and set aside time 
before breakfast to work with her child, he said.

IT'S ALL A MANNER OF SPEAKING; 
</P>
<P>
SPEECH: SPECIAL CLASSES ARE PREPARING STUDENTS TO SOUND LIKE U.S. NETWORK 
NEWSCASTERS.

<P>
American intolerance for accents that fall strangely on their ears has 
generated a recent surge in students hoping to sound like a U.S. network 
newscaster. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there have been more requests for accent reduction work in the last 
decade, last five or six years," said Roy A. Koenigsknecht, president of the 
American Speech-Language-Hearing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Although accent training classes also are given to Americans who speak with a 
regional accent, speech teachers say their clients generally speak fluent 
English but use another language at home. Many of the students are medical, 
scientific and academic professionals whose jobs require a great deal of 
interaction with others. 
</P>
<P>
Zbigniew Kabala, an assistant professor of hydrology at UC Riverside, said he 
decided to sign up when he had to drop a university class because he could not 
understand the professor's heavy Asian Indian accent. 
</P>
<P>
Even native English speakers had trouble understanding the professor, Kabala 
said. "They would stop the guy frequently asking him to repeat. He would get 
frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
Alerted to a problem he, too, might have, Kabala concluded his colleagues were 
too polite to correct his pronunciation. He turned to a speech professional to 
improve his accent. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Compton, a San Francisco speech and language pathologist, says the 
people he sees are "generally feeling that they're not progressing in their 
career or job because of their English." 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to get people who are more insecure generally about their speech," 
Compton says. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes self-consciousness persuades a middle manager to shell out hundreds 
of dollars for an accent training program. Other clients sign up at the 
suggestion or even the order of a boss. 
</P>
<P>
Igal Levy, director of administration at an MCI company division, took an 
intensive weekend course and some private lessons at Compton's Institute of 
Language and Phonology after his employer offered to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was skeptical in the beginning," he said. Twenty years after leaving Israel, 
he considered his English more than adequate. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really felt that because I had a funny accent it held me back," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The way it was put to me was that (there are) still some prejudices against 
people with accents in the business world," Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than try to change his speech patterns completely, Levy said counselor 
Phyllis Taylor concentrated on changing his guttural r sounds and teaching him 
the th sound, which does not exist in Hebrew. 
</P>
<P>
"I can feel improvement if I concentrate -- it's still not automatic," Levy 
said. "I'm sure that after a few beers I still sound funny." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not inexpensive," Barbara Rockman of San Francisco said of such classes, 
"and so that limits access for some people." 
</P>
<P>
Compton's program, for example, charges $700 per person to join a 13-week class 
of five people. 
</P>
<P>
A recent court ruling could persuade even more people to sign up. 
</P>
<P>
In Fragante v. City and County of Honolulu, a Filipino man argued that Honolulu 
city officials practiced racial discrimination in refusing to hire him for a 
clerk's job. 
</P>
<P>
City attorneys argued successfully that Manuel Fragante's heavy Filipino accent 
would have kept him from working effectively as a clerk. Last spring, the U.S. 
Supreme Court let stand a federal appeals court decision supporting the city. 
</P>
<P>
Rockman said the decision is worrisome. "It just opens the door for potential 
kinds of discrimination," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Many speech and language pathologists alter accents with methods developed to 
treat speech disorders such as stuttering. But Koenigsknecht is careful to 
explain ASHA's position that accents are not disorders. 
</P>
<P>
Like Koenigsknecht, accent teachers contend they are teaching a new skill 
rather than correcting a problem. Rockman and Compton both noted that many 
black Americans often speak two distinct dialects of English and switch between 
them as circumstances demand. 
</P>
<P>
A 1989 ASHA survey found 6,000 or more of the association's 47,000 speech and 
language pathologists worked with people's accents. 
</P>
<P>
Koenigsknecht says the demand for accent training has grown in recent years 
among people who speak regional American dialects, though he estimates they 
make up less than a fifth of all such students. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a regional dialect it marks you as an outsider," says Dr. Carol 
Fleming, who calls her San Francisco business "The Sound of Your Voice." "At 
least out here, let's say, the Brooklyn accent would be stigmatized. People 
hear that and they think pushy, hostile, aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
Fleming describes what she does as "grooming." For example, she says many 
clients whose first language is Chinese pronounce each syllable distinctly, as 
they would in Chinese. She says she teaches them "smooth gliding" from one 
English syllable to the next.

HEALTH: THE 'PROCEDURE OF CHOICE' CAN HALT VISION DETERIORATION AND ACTUALLY 
RESTORE CLEARER VISION IN SOME CASES.

Suzanne Lichtfuss received terrifying news from a neuro-ophthalmologist at the 
University of Maryland Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Lichtfuss, who wore glasses only when she drove, was told she was going blind 
in both eyes -- quickly. Her peripheral or side vision was slipping away; her 
central vision could begin to erode at any time; she had episodes of darkness 
in both eyes and excruciating headaches. 
</P>
<P>
The culprit was an excess amount of spinal fluid circulating in the brain, Dr. 
Shalom E. Kelman informed her. This leads to a high level of pressure in the 
brain and swelling of all its structures, especially the optic nerve, which 
causes the visual loss. 
</P>
<P>
This created a dilemma for Lichtfuss, the mother of two children. She could opt 
for traditional surgery, which involves a shunt or tube to drain the spinal 
fluid but does not always arrest the deteriorating vision. Or, she could be one 
of the pioneers in a more experimental type surgery that could possibly reverse 
her vision loss. 
</P>
<P>
Lichtfuss gambled on the experimental surgery, and won. A year after surgery, 
the vision in her left eye is a better-than-normal 20-15, and she wears glasses 
to correct a slight blurriness in her right eye. 
</P>
<P>
The disorder, which masquerades as a brain tumor, is known as pseudotumor 
cerebri and strikes young women of child-bearing age, particularly as they near 
30. For some unknown reason, black women are hit the hardest. Each year 5,000 
new cases are diagnosed in the United States, experts conservatively estimate. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure was cited as "the procedure of choice" by Dr. Michael Wall of 
Tulane University in Louisiana after a collaborative study between the 
University of Maryland Medical Center and Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert C. Sergott, of Philadelphia, and Kelman performed the delicate 
surgery on 12 patients who had had no success with traditional shunt surgery. 
The ophthalmologists cut several tiny holes in the sheath that covers the optic 
nerve, permitting the excess high-pressure fluid inside to escape into the eye 
socket, where it was absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only did their vision stop deteriorating, it became much better in all 12 
patients within a few weeks of surgery," Kelman said. "This procedure, called 
optic nerve sheath decompression, offers new hope to patients for whom no other 
therapy is effective to prevent blindness from this disorder." 
</P>
<P>
Kelman has treated 30 patients over the last 18 months using the new procedure, 
which requires general anesthesia and takes about 1 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Of that group, 29 patients had their vision restored to normal or saw a vast 
improvement," he said. "One patient had a post-surgical complication that 
resulted in blindness in one eye, but the other eye regained normal vision." 
</P>
<P>
The procedure is now being done at other medical centers throughout the 
country, said Kelman. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the initial treatment has been medications, such as diuretics 
or steroids, to reduce the production of the fluid in the brain. Beginning in 
the late 1960s, shunt procedures were introduced as a therapy for patients who 
could not be helped by drugs. A tube or shunt that would go from the lower 
spine to the belly was used to drain the fluid out of the brain. 
</P>
<P>
"But in the last 20 years people have recognized that these shunts had a lot of 
complications," Kelman said. "They would be blocked and even if they were not 
blocked, they still would not drain the fluid completely and people would still 
lose vision." 
</P>
<P>
Sergott began work on the new technique six years ago. Two years ago, he 
reported on it in the journal Archives of Ophthalmology. In the same issue, 
there were two other corroborating reports and an editorial saying the new 
technique appeared to work. 
</P>
<P>
"I was anxious to start doing the procedure because I had patients in my 
practice at the University of Maryland who just didn't seem to be responding to 
the conventional surgery, and I felt we had to offer them something else," 
Kelman said.

MOVEMENT IS THE 'NEW' COUNTRY COLLECTIBLE.

No-frills mission oak furniture, expensive green pottery and hand-hammered 
copper lamps -- symbols of America's Arts and Crafts Movement from the turn of 
the century -- share an honesty of design and workmanship that appeals to 
today's country collector. 
</P>
<P>
According to Country Home magazine, no longer does Arts and Crafts furniture 
languish dusty and unnoticed in the back of junk stores and antique shops. 
</P>
<P>
It seems fitting, now that Americans have entered the last years of the 
century, that interest has again turned to the most popular furnishings of the 
first decade of the 1900s. With its no-nonsense rectilinear designs, the 
mission oak furniture of the Arts and Crafts Movement is now revered as the 
first glimpse of modernism in America. Some art historians see the American 
Arts and Crafts Movement as the most successful attempt at creating a truly 
national aesthetic in the arts. 
</P>
<P>
The current trendiness of Arts and Crafts is surprising when one considers 
mission furniture's uncompromising simplicity, its dark stains and heavy woods. 
</P>
<P>
The furniture was made to be integrated with linens, rugs and lighting to 
create an atmosphere that energizes rather than enervates. 
</P>
<P>
The best evidence of the renewed popularity of Arts and Crafts is the 
astonishing rise in prices in recent years. A factory-made Gustav Stickley 
bow-arm Morris chair that sold for a little more than $500 in 1980 will bring 
more than $5,000 in New York galleries this year. 
</P>
<P>
Although best known as a school of design, the Art and Crafts Movement was 
actually a far-reaching philosophical movement that embraced even such social 
issues as education and labor reform. 
</P>
<P>
The philosophical groundwork was laid in the middle of the 19th Century with 
the writings of Englishmen John Ruskin, William Morris and others. Morris, 
considered the father of the Arts and Crafts Movement, not only rallied against 
cheaply made and poorly designed products, but created his own designs and set 
up a workshop that produced a wide range of handcrafted objects. He wanted to 
create art that would be a part of everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
In America, the Arts and Crafts Movement began with an emphasis on 
craftsmanship, but here philosophy was quickly transformed into fashion. 
Established in 1895, Elbert Hubbard's Roycroft Shops began as a crafts guild 
based directly on Morris' model. Hubbard first produced hand-printed books but 
expanded to leather work, copper wares, furniture and textiles. 
</P>
<P>
Similar to Hubbard, Gustav Stickley cleverly advertised his Craftsman Shops 
furniture and popularized the Arts and Crafts aesthetic through his magazine, 
the Craftsman. Although they never acknowledged one another, Stickley and 
Hubbard were most responsible for making Arts and Crafts the country's most 
fashionable style of home decorating. 
</P>
<P>
Stickley's furniture was blatantly copied by dozens of other manufacturers, 
including the several companies operated by his four brothers. Still, his 
furniture epitomizes the mission oak look and is widely considered the best of 
the style with respect to both design and construction. 
</P>
<P>
For many years, the designs of two of Gustav's brothers, Leopold and John 
George, were considered mere imitations of craftsman furniture. Recently, 
however, the brothers have been widely credited with designs and construction 
details that are in some ways superior. Their company, L. &amp; J.G. Stickley, 
introduced the highly regarded prairie settle and tall case clock in 1910, a 
time when craftsmen offered little that was innovative. 
</P>
<P>
Not all Arts and Crafts furniture had the mission look, however. Frank Lloyd 
Wright's fame as an architect generally eclipses the fact that his furniture 
fits snugly in the Arts and Crafts framework; he even designed what he called a 
mission chair. 
</P>
<P>
If the many companies imitating Gustav Stickley's designs contributed to his 
bankruptcy in 1916 (changing fashion also had a lot to do with that), they also 
produced much of the furniture that can be a relative bargain for the Arts and 
Crafts collector. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the simplicity of mission designs, only slight variations make the 
difference between an important piece and one that is far less valuable. 
</P>
<P>
One easy indication of a design likely to be valuable is the presence of an 
arch. Whether an arched toe board on a bookcase or sideboard, an arched apron 
on a footstool or chair, or arched arms on a chair, the presence of that subtle 
break from straight lines usually adds a refreshing dimension to a mission 
design. Generally speaking, wider stretchers are better than narrow ones, and 
more slats are better than fewer. 
</P>
<P>
Construction also indicates value. The best pieces of mission furniture are 
pegged rather than nailed. They may have exposed mortice-and-tenon joints, 
chamfered boards or butterfly splines.

AFTER A LIFETIME OF UPHEAVAL AND GLORY, KURT SANDERLING IS PREPARING L.A. 
PHILHARMONIC FOR A TRIP TO HIS BERLIN ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DONNA PERLMUTTER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The magic that transpires between a revered conductor and his 100 charges is 
easier to describe than explain. Take, for instance, Kurt Sanderling rehearsing 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
To signal a sudden decrease in volume, this maestro just stops moving, leans 
backward and lowers his arms. The players breathlessly respond, finding in his 
subtle body language everything needed to trigger a heavenly diminuendo, so 
important to Bruckner's Fourth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
This is no blazing hero who freezes for the poetic drama of the moment and 
throws his head back in ecstasy, nor a flamboyant activist with mane flying and 
baton wildly spearing imaginary demons. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier rehearsal, the Prussian-born conductor -- who has achieved nearly 
cult status here -- had quietly laid the groundwork, doing what most of the 
younger, zippier baton-wielders of today rarely can do: talk about the music. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the finger of God pointing at you," he tells the players, giving a 
caption to the Brucknerian battalion of brass that bursts the quiet aura of the 
second movement. "It's God commanding you to look at the majesty of his 
creation." 
</P>
<P>
And later, in the "Hunting" Scherzo, he speaks of forest animals: a fawn 
looking for its mother, illustrated by the high strings' tender tracing of a 
melody. 
</P>
<P>
"These are Bruckner's thoughts as I've discovered them," says the 78-year-old 
Sanderling. "I want to share what I feel, something that touches the heart and 
stimulates the mind." Otherwise, he says, music is in jeopardy of becoming just 
a blueprint for sonics. 
</P>
<P>
"Knowing why you play a passage loud is more important than just doing it. 
Expression is the key. To have it you must get under the skin of the music." 
</P>
<P>
It was 1984 when this champion of Old World values guest-conducted the 
Philharmonic for the first time. Not long afterward a love affair flowered 
between Sanderling and the L.A. Philharmonic. By way of non-explanation, 
Sanderling turns to metaphor: 
</P>
<P>
"How do you explain why a man is attracted to that woman over there? You 
can't," he says, invoking the mystery of it all. By the same token, he 
acknowledges that not every orchestra accords him "most-beloved" status -- some 
merely offer respect. 
</P>
<P>
Seated now in a nook off the lobby of a small, elegant European hotel tucked 
away downtown, the non-publicity minded maestro coughs now and then from the 
flu. He looks like a kindly Henry Kissinger. But when he speaks in his halting 
English, it is with a more comfortably placed voice than his gravel-throated 
counterpart -- although with a more guttural accent. The two share more than a 
physical resemblance, though. Both are vintage German Jews who fled Hitler's 
Third Reich. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Sanderling went from one police state to another when Soviet 
relatives offered him a haven. 
</P>
<P>
"I stayed in Berlin as long as I did because the insanity of a Hitler did not 
seem like something that could last more than a few months. I finally left in 
1935 with the 10 marks the government permitted us to take out of the country." 
</P>
<P>
But where an artist goes -- to the East and its formerly repressive system or 
to the West and democracy -- does not determine what happens to him, says 
Sanderling. Asked if his career, from then to 1960 with the Leningrad 
Philharmonic and thereafter with the Berlin Symphony, had been stymied by 
taking the only choice open to a man with 10 marks in his pocket, he responds 
negatively: 
</P>
<P>
"There are no absolutes. Neither in life nor in art. I went where I could get 
work. Those were desperate times for everyone. People had no choices. They took 
any offer that came. And despite the lack of freedom in the Soviet Union, I 
felt that the Russians saved me. But my story is no more important than 
another's. Every person of my circumstances has a story to tell." 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out Sanderling speaks only praise for the Leningrad Philharmonic, 
where he "learned everything." And he believes that the trade-offs between a 
closed and open government "make one no better than another" with regard to the 
arts. 
</P>
<P>
In the West, for instance, he cites a laissez-faire approach that depends on 
private fund-raising, whereas socialist countries show reverence through 
subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
"But one cannot measure everything from an arts point of view," he says, while 
allowing that "music allows us to transcend earthly concerns. Nor should we be 
creatures of pride. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no right to be proud. Being a Jew, for instance, is just a fact of 
birth, a fact no different from my being so many centimeters tall or a man's 
skin being black. There are fine Jews and bad Jews, fine blacks and bad blacks. 
These things don't speak of qualities. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's just another fact that these people are treated unjustly. But 
learning to go beyond one's circumstances is what's important. For me it is 
being a musician, showing how Bruckner's music glorifies life and nature." 
</P>
<P>
He thus sees himself serving a higher creative power -- and saving himself from 
vanity. But he also does not deny his heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"Every person remembers in his heart where he came from. But the faster you 
assimilate the better, because life as a stranger is a terrible life -- 
especially for an artist, who must exist and work for the pleasure of others." 
</P>
<P>
In May, Sanderling will take the L.A. Philharmonic on tour -- to Berlin (he 
repatriated there in 1960) and Dresden. He will conduct the Bruckner and 
Shostakovich's Eighth Symphony, "the most desolate of all music," exhibiting 
the extremes of human experience. 
</P>
<P>
These days he takes pleasure in not having to differentiate Berlin as East or 
West. Will there be some particular symbolism for a former German refugee to 
lead an American orchestra there? 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," he says with painful honesty. "But I did experience a moving 
moment for the Oct. 3 (reunification ceremony) when I was asked to conduct the 
Berlin Symphony on that occasion. 
</P>
<P>
"At the first rehearsal I told the musicians how important this event and its 
symbolism was for me. In the light of my Jewishness they could understand the 
meaning. One must choose the right moment to speak of such things." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sanderling's Dates With Philharmonic 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Sanderling will lead the L.A. Philharmonic Friday, Saturday and Sunday in 
Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 2 with soloist Murray Perahia and Beethoven's 
Symphony No. 6 ("Pastoral"). 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 30 and Dec. 2, Sanderling will conduct Haydn's Symphony No. 39 and 
Mahler's Symphony No. 9. On Dec. 1, he will conduct the L.A. Philharmonic and 
pianist Richard Goode in a Beethoven program at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center.

STAGE WATCH: 'MY CHILDREN!' HAS EVERYTHING BUT BOX OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The producers of "My Children! My Africa!" are observing Thanksgiving with 
mixed feelings. They have a gripping play by one of the world's most important 
playwrights, but they don't have much of an audience. 
</P>
<P>
In the first full week of its run at the 863-seat Henry Fonda Theatre, Athol 
Fugard's drama grossed a mere $31,465 out of a potential $220,000. The 
break-even point for the first week had been budgeted low (at $51,900) but not 
that low. Assuming the run was launched successfully, a normal week's 
break-even point would have been $93,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what buttons we have not pushed," said the show's general 
manager, Ken Meyers. "My Children!" got generally glowing reviews, not only 
here but also in its Aug. 26-Sept. 30 run at La Jolla Playhouse, where it sold 
"better than 90%" of the 492-seat house, according to a spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers acknowledged that the period of advance publicity and promotion was much 
shorter than usual. The move to Hollywood was announced Oct. 23 and the first 
ads ran Oct. 28, two weeks before the Nov. 11 opening. At the time, said 
Meyers, it seemed that the best way to keep the La Jolla production intact was 
to open quickly. 
</P>
<P>
In La Jolla, the production was heavily pre-sold to a subscription audience, 
and Meyers said mailings may yet be sent to Mark Taper Forum subscribers here 
if the show survives its initial run through Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"There really isn't a substitute for a subscription audience." said Los Angeles 
Theatre Center artistic director Bill Bushnell. 
</P>
<P>
Bushnell saw and liked "My Children!" in New York and at La Jolla,, but LATC 
couldn't have added the play to its season until later in the winter, he said. 
"I hope they make it; they're in very deep water." 
</P>
<P>
LATC WATCH: Culture Clash, the Latino comedy trio, will return to Los Angeles 
Theatre Center in June for "Bowl of Beings," a comedy seen earlier this year at 
San Francisco's Asian American Theatre Center. It replaces David Mamet's 
"Speed-the-Plow" on the theater's spring-summer season. 
</P>
<P>
"Speed-the-Plow," a Hollywood-themed play already seen at South Coast Repertory 
and San Diego's Bowery Theatre, is off at the nonprofit LATC because of 
possible plans to stage it commercially in Los Angeles, said Mamet's agent, 
Howard Rosenstone. 
</P>
<P>
But LATC's Bill Bushnell said he still hopes to present the play at a later 
date. "If we can come up with the right people (in the cast), I think we can 
get the rights back." Mamet wants a "high visibility" cast, said Bushnell -- in 
other words, stars. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Culture Clash may be stars by the time they return to LATC. They've 
snagged a development deal for a Fox TV series to be produced and directed by 
Richard (Cheech) Marin. . . . And the Latino comedy troupe Latins Anonymous, 
who preceded Culture Clash at LATC, have a script deal with ABC. 
</P>
<P>
In another LATC schedule change, Birgir Sigurdsson's "Day of Hope" has been 
moved from the season's third slot, in March-April, to the sixth, in May-July. 
The playwright and director's schedules were cited as the reason. The sixth 
slot had been occupied only by "to be announced"; now the third slot has that 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
SCR WATCH: South Coast Repertory has instituted a pay-what-you-will policy at 
selected performances, beginning with this Saturday's matinees of "The Secret 
Rapture" and "Alekhine's Defense." 
</P>
<P>
All purchases under the policy must be made on the day of the performance -- 
and depend on availability. In other words, if those performances sell out 
before Saturday, forget it. But a spokesman said that the chosen performances 
were selected because they were not expected to sell out. 
</P>
<P>
There is a limit of four tickets per purchase. If you pay at least $10, you may 
use a credit card. Information: (714) 957-4033. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast has slated Manuel Puig's "Kiss of the Spider Woman" for a Second 
Stage production to run Jan. 25-Feb. 24. The slot had been assigned to "a new 
play." 
</P>
<P>
"Kiss" was produced in Spain and Britain before being made into a Hollywood 
film starring William Hurt and Raul Julia in 1985. The play also has been 
staged at Hollywood's Cast Theatre and at Yale Repertory in New Haven, Conn. A 
musical version was presented in Purchase, N.Y., earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
SCR associate artist David Chambers, who staged the Yale Rep production of 
"Kiss," will direct it again at SCR. "This is the play that he is really hot 
on, and that's why it's being done," said theater spokesman Cristofer Gross, 
who added that "no other plays were really in the running." 
</P>
<P>
PIPPI IN HOLLYWOOD: Mikel Pippi is the new producing director of the Comedy 
Store Playhouse, the long-moribund 232-seat theater formerly known as the 
Hollywood Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
When the Comedy Store's Mitzi Shore bought the theater two years ago, it was 
heralded as a future home for comedies and stand-up comics who wanted to do 
extended theater pieces. But the only shows to be seen there since then have 
been the AIDS drama "As Is" and the one-man "Freud" starring Harold Gould, 
neither produced by Shore. 
</P>
<P>
And the next show to rent the space -- a one-woman Harriet Tubman drama, 
"Hats," opening Jan. 11 for four weeks -- doesn't sound like a laugh riot, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to have the theater live up to its name within a year," said Pippi. 
Besides comedies and stand-up comics' longer productions, Pippi is also talking 
to comedy troupes who might come in for one night a week. He's also in 
negotiations to present the Los Angeles premiere of "Groucho: A Life in Revue," 
seen recently in La Mirada and earlier in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Pippi said a mid-sized theater such as this one "is not a place where you make 
money." It's "a generating station." The goal is "to create projects with an 
afterlife and then participate in that afterlife." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he noted that Actors' Equity's new Hollywood Area Contract for mid-sized 
theaters "makes things a lot more affordable." 
</P>
<P>
Pippi has retained a part-time position as public relations director at 
California Music Theatre in Pasadena, where he was a full-time staffer until 
two weeks ago, and he said that it's possible CMT will be able to use the 
Hollywood facility for workshops. 
</P>
<P>
ADIEU RAOUL AND MIGUEL: Reece Holland, who has played the romantic rival of 
"The Phantom of the Opera" since the show opened at the Ahmanson last year, 
left the cast Sunday. Understudy Joseph Dellger is filling in until 
mid-December, when permanent replacement Michael Piontek, currently on Broadway 
in "Grand Hotel," is slated to take over. 
</P>
<P>
And the latest word from Sheri Glaser's "Family Secrets," re-opening at the 
Heliotrope Saturday, is that her new character of Miguel is still in 
development and will be presented only if an encore is requested.

HOLIDAY TV FARE: FOOTBALL, PARADES -- AND BART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today's Thanksgiving television fare will include those traditional favorites 
-- parades, football games, a "Twilight Zone" marathon and "It's a Wonderful 
Life," along with such unlikely offerings as "The Simpsons," a Connie Chung 
special and a professional wrestling spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
The TV event that has become most synonymous with Thanksgiving -- the 64th 
annual Macy's Day Parade -- airs at 8 a.m. on Channels 2 and 8 and at 1 p.m. on 
Channels 4, 36 and 39. This year's new balloons include a skateboarding Bart 
Simpson. CBS' coverage also features highlights of parades from Disneyland, 
Hawaii and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be a Simpson joining the troops stationed in the Middle East 
for Operation Desert Shield, but not Bart, Homer, Marge, Lisa or Maggie. 
Football legend O.J. Simpson will report live from Saudi Arabia on NBC's "NFL 
Live" (9 a.m., Channels 4, 36 and 39.) 
</P>
<P>
Befitting the mediocrity that has generally characterized this professional 
football season, today's NFL games feature teams with a combined 16-25 record. 
The 3-7 Detroit Lions, last in the NFC Central, play host to the 3-7 Denver 
Broncos, last in the AFC West, at 9:30 a.m. on Channels 4, 36 and 39. The 4-7 
Dallas Cowboys, fourth in the five-team NFC East, face the 6-4 Washington 
Redskins, tied for second in the same division, at 1 p.m. on Channels 2 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
At 9 a.m., KTLA Channel 5 begins its 11th annual "Twilight Zone Marathon." 
Episodes include "To Serve Man" (noon); "Two" (12:30 p.m.); "The Big Tall Wish" 
(3:30 p.m.); "The Dummy" (8 p.m.) and "Night of the Meek" (9:30 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
KDOC Channel 56 has a marathon of its own, airing 20 consecutive episodes of 
"The Dick Van Dyke Show" from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
With Thanksgiving the traditional start of the Christmas season, two cable 
outlets will show what has become the quintessential Christmas movie, "It's a 
Wonderful Life." TBS airs Frank Capra's increasingly contemporary tale of a 
troubled savings and loan executive at 9 p.m., while American Movie Classics 
shows an uncut version without commercial interruptions at 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Family Channel attempts to capitalize on the popularity of "It's a 
Wonderful Life," debuting a made-for-cable movie, "Clarence" at 8 p.m. Robert 
Carradine stars in the title role, based upon the angel of "It's a Wonderful 
Life." 
</P>
<P>
While many prime-time series are preempted or in reruns because of the holiday, 
"The Simpsons" airs its first Thanksgiving episode (8 p.m., Channels 11 and 6) 
with Bart running away from home after being blamed for ruining Thanksgiving

Connie Chung, who earlier this year bristled at suggestions that her "Face to 
Face" series was dominated by celebrity-oriented stories, interviews Kevin 
Costner, Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward in a special to be broadcast at 10 
p.m. on Channels 2 and 8. "Face to Face" also has a report on a family whose 
two daughters suffer from a rare genetic disease that makes any exposure to 
sunlight potentially fatal.

In what may well be the day's unlikeliest tradition, the World Wrestling 
Federation will conduct its "Survivor Series." Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate 
Warrior headline the 5 p.m. pay-per-view show, which replays at 8 p.m.

TWO NETWORKS ANNOUNCE MID-SEASON CHANGES; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: NBC CANCELS 'GENERATIONS,' THE FIRST DAYTIME SOAP FEATURING A BLACK 
FAMILY. CBS DROPS COMEDY SERIES 'THE HOGAN FAMILY.' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NBC has axed "Generations," the first daytime soap opera to feature a black 
family on an ongoing basis, and CBS has canceled "The Hogan Family," a 
long-running comedy series that until this season had been seen on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Those announcements were among a list of mid-season changes revealed Wednesday 
by the two networks. They included the unveiling of a daytime news program 
anchored by Faith Daniels for NBC and a new Nell Carter sitcom for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
NBC said that "Generations," the story of two affluent Chicago families, one 
black and one white, will have its last broadcast Jan. 25. The soap opera, 
which began in 1989, won critical acclaim for featuring black performers in 
dramatic roles, but has suffered low ratings. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People immediately urged NBC 
to keep the show on the air. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very saddened; 'Generations' was a breakthrough show," Sandra 
Evers-Manly, president of the NAACP's Beverly Hills-Hollywood chapter, said 
through a spokeswoman. She urged "Generations" viewers to write NBC asking that 
the decision be rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, as in many other cities, the half-hour "Generations" aired 
against the second half of CBS' popular "The Young and the Restless." So far 
this season, "Generations" is attracting only 8% of the available viewers, 
compared with "Y&amp;R's" 31%. NBC ranks third behind CBS and ABC in overall 
daytime ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Sussman, the creator, executive producer and head writer of 
"Generations," said that the difficult time slot and lack of support from NBC's 
affiliated stations ensured the show's demise. "To be perfectly honest, as soon 
as the show went on the air, they were talking about canceling it," she said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Although the show has been canceled, Sussman said, 300 episodes have already 
been sold into syndication in France, and TV stations here and abroad have 
expressed interest in continuing it. "You don't have to be on the network to be 
successful," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Tartikoff, chairman of the NBC Entertainment Group, said in a prepared 
statement that NBC Productions is exploring the viability of continuing to 
produce "Generations" for syndication. 
</P>
<P>
Jorn Winther, senior executive producer of "Generations," said that the show's 
poor ratings performance will make the networks wary of new soaps featuring 
black core characters. "I can't imagine it (a show like 'Generations') will 
happen again in my lifetime -- I'm 57," he said. "I don't think I'm going to 
see an integrated show again." 
</P>
<P>
As the daytime audience dwindles, NBC hopes to bring viewers back to daytime by 
introducing four new information series, and has another two in development. 
</P>
<P>
The first is "A Closer Look," a "woman-oriented" mid-day half-hour anchored by 
Daniels, to debut Jan. 28. Also to be introduced in the "near future," NBC 
said, are "A.M. Assignment," featuring an all-female news team assigned to 
"in-depth feature stories"; "Women's Diaries," a "real-life soap" about 
ordinary people and their problems, and "Trialwatch," a "magazine" show using 
actual footage from courtroom trials. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "You Take the Kids," a comedy starring Nell Carter as the head of a 
blue-collar family, will join the CBS schedule at 8 p.m. Saturday, beginning 
Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
"Lenny," a blue-collar comedy that had been put on hiatus earlier this season, 
will rejoin the lineup that night too, at 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving the Saturday night lineup following their Dec. 1 broadcast will be "The 
Hogan Family" and the first-year comedy "The Family Man." The latter will 
return in the spring, CBS said.

TEARS AND FEARS ON RETURN TO WORK

<P>
Here, seven new mothers share diaries detailing the adjustments, stresses and 
joys they found in their first days back on the job: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Feel Guilty' 
</P>
<P>
"I find myself holding onto him more as he drops off to sleep and not wanting 
to put him down," Martha Duffley writes on her first day back. "There are fewer 
hours that I am with him and I hoard them." 
</P>
<P>
By 9 a.m., Duffley's pals down at the post office are saying: "Gee, it's great 
to see you back on the job." They ask after her 5-month-old son, chat about 
motherhood, coo at the new mother's battery of baby photos. 
</P>
<P>
By 10, things have quieted down. People drift back to their work and Duffley, a 
Boston post-office supervisor, tucks the pictures away in her wallet. No point 
in displaying them on her desk: They only remind her of Brian's sparkling eyes, 
and the way her own eyes swell when she cries, like she did last night at the 
thought of leaving her son in someone else's care. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel guilty," Duffley writes. "He is still so young. I don't know if he is 
cognizant of what my role is in his life. I rush home . . . to remind him who I 
am." 
</P>
<P>
The guilt lingers. The morning goodbys grow no easier. 
</P>
<P>
Duffley, 33, doesn't choose to work. Between her husband's job as caretaker at 
the cemetery in their hometown of Milton, Mass., and her work at the post 
office, the couple makes $42,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought I would be able to emulate (my mother) when and if I had 
children," Duffley wrote after going back to work this summer. "She was at home 
for us when we were young." 
</P>
<P>
But mortgage payments and upkeep on the Duffley's home run $8,000 a year. Add 
car payments and utilities: $11,400. Food and gas cost about $7,500. Day care 
is $9,300 a year. The budget is tight. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm frustrated because I always wanted to stay home with my children and I 
always knew I wouldn't be able to," she says. "I'm supposed to be the main 
person in his life, the one he loves." 
</P>
<P>
Instead Duffley wonders whether her son knows that Mary, his day-care provider, 
is not his mother. She tries not to miss Brian too much, at the same time 
secretly hoping he misses her just a little. 
</P>
<P>
"Somewhere deep inside I keep wanting to hear he misses me, he feels a void in 
his life, he is not chuckling all the time," Martha writes. "Just so I know I 
mean something in his life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Harder to Leave' 
</P>
<P>
"She's asleep when I leave -- no regrets about leaving. Excited . . . at the 
prospect of being back again," Amanda Wallis writes. "A lot of my friends cried 
the first day they left their babies. I feel badly that I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
The new mother is glad to be behind a desk after 13 weeks away from her job 
directing Bank of America's private banking office in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The routine helps. Wallis is up at 4:30 a.m. to feed and play with Katie, who 
is fast asleep again by 5:45 a.m. "This gives me time to exercise, shower and 
dress and be out of the house by 7," she writes. 
</P>
<P>
Wallis' parents and live-in nanny make the days "a lot more manageable," while 
her husband "is wonderful with Katie and . . . has made juggling motherhood and 
career possible." 
</P>
<P>
But it's easy to drop a ball, lose the balance. 
</P>
<P>
"Katie was up and playing when I left this morning, which made it harder to 
leave!" Wallis writes on Tuesday. By Friday, she writes: "As time progresses I 
miss Katie more. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Wallis' eyes drift more and more frequently to the newly framed photograph of 
Katie. She wonders whether to check on things at her ranch-style home in 
suburban Burlingame, where her daughter might be crying or sleeping or smiling. 
At 37, Wallis was ready for motherhood. She and Richard Blue, her husband of 
nine years, had discussed the decision. They'd pondered the inevitable, and 
substantial, changes a baby would bring. 
</P>
<P>
It's the smaller daily changes that sneak up. Wallis' heated rollers have been 
cold for months because coiling her blonde hair into a bun saves at least 10 
minutes in the morning. An evening out with her husband is rare; evenings out 
with friends rarer still. 
</P>
<P>
"What I realize has now disappeared from my life is any free time for myself," 
writes Wallis, whose staff of 24 caters to bank clients with account balances 
of more than $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I go to work, come home, play with the baby, put her to bed, put myself to 
bed, and then I wake up and do it all over again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Overwhelming' 
</P>
<P>
"Arianna wakes up during the night -- but that's OK. I can give a few more 
hours of sleep," writes Cynthia Sartin, whose focus day and night is on others. 
</P>
<P>
Time with her 3-month-old daughter, Arianna, is wedged between erratic shifts 
at New Orleans' Charity Hospital, where Cynthia nurses AIDS patients and other 
strangers. 
</P>
<P>
Her first day back on the job begins when the baby wakes at 3 a.m. on July 2, 
and ends around midnight: "Tired. Scratchy throat. Sleepy." 
</P>
<P>
Chronicling her life in a child's miniature diary, Sartin fills the pages with 
sentence fragments and third-person observations: 
</P>
<P>
"Arrives at work. Butterflies in stomach. . . . Calls home. Dad reading 
newspaper to baby. Wishes to be home. Continually shows pictures to friends. 
Arrives home. Kisses baby over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
Arianna is everything to Sartin, a stern Cajun woman determined to be the 
mother she wasn't able to be as a single 20-year-old. When she gave birth to 
her now-teen-age son, Sartin's eight siblings and parents had to help out while 
she finished up nursing school. 
</P>
<P>
Today, she says, "It's a whole different ballgame. It's overwhelming . . . but 
I'm more mature. I can perceive so much more about what her needs are." 
</P>
<P>
Though she'd like to take care of Arianna on her own, Sartin relies on her 
husband and 16-year-old son. The two men, whom Sartin refers to as her "other 
babies," have overcome their fear of crushing the tiny girl while cradling her 
to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Sartin feels fortunate. She knows many mothers don't have such support. Still, 
she writes: "My feelings are those of inadequacy. My only hope is that things 
will get better with time and, maybe, I will not miss Arianna so much." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Takes Teamwork' 
</P>
<P>
"I called Mom to ask how the kids are doing," Capt. Sheila Michelli writes 
after rejoining her Army unit for military exercises. "It's a relief to know 
that they miss me less than I miss them." 
</P>
<P>
An Army logistics officer at Fort Lee, Va., Michelli is a woman who knows how 
to take control and get things done. But saying goodby to 6-week-old Connor is 
a tough order. He is the Michelli's second son -- the last child the couple 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
"The most wrenching part about returning to work is giving up breast-feeding," 
she writes at 5:53 p.m., after dropping the kids off with her parents and 
heading for nine days of crisis combat-preparedness training. 
</P>
<P>
"Connor I'll see in 11 days, but I'm done breast-feeding for good," she writes. 
"It's so final." 
</P>
<P>
Still, letting go of her newborn is easier the second time around. Michelli, 
27, has finally decided to commit to a career with the Army, where she believes 
working mothers have it pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
She received 28 days' paid maternity leave with her first child and 42 days 
with Connor. Less than half of U.S. working women have access to such maternity 
benefits, according to the Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after returning to work last spring, Michelli was placed in command of 
a 300-member unit. The Persian Gulf crisis put pressure on the entire military, 
but the Michellis have not been directly affected. 
</P>
<P>
Michelli is proud of herself, but the work is demanding. And her husband, Tom, 
is a semi-workaholic computer programmer for Virginia's National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
Because both are so committed to their careers, tensions arise. Sometimes the 
couple ends up locking horns. But Michelli knows she can count on her husband 
to help warm a bottle, wash a load of diapers or be there when it's time to 
drive the baby-sitter home. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a lot of coordination and teamwork," says Michelli. "We argue . . . 
but he supports me." 
</P>
<P>
And that, all the mothers agreed, is key. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I'm Pulled Both Ways' 
</P>
<P>
"The first day back at work was nothing short of traumatic," Pam Salazar writes 
after going back to her job reporting for television station WKEF in Dayton, 
Ohio. "The thought of leaving my baby brought me to tears." 
</P>
<P>
Although willing to cut back on hours at the office and forgo her morning 
anchor position, Salazar wasn't prepared to quit broadcasting altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I thought somehow the situation would magically work itself out," she 
writes, after finding out how it feels to be caught between news deadlines and 
her 5-month-old daughter, Chase. 
</P>
<P>
There are no magic wands when it comes to racing the clock. Salazar may roar 
home to relieve the baby-sitter after a late-breaking news story or reel into 
work after prolonged morning goodbys. 
</P>
<P>
But breast-feeding is another story. Mother Nature won't be rushed. 
</P>
<P>
"I was extremely nervous," Salazar, 28, wrote after her first disastrous 
attempt at expressing milk in an office bathroom. "Would I be able to master 
the art . . . would I manage to pump enough (milk) to feed my baby?" 
</P>
<P>
It was only after several attempts and with a lot of coaching by telephone from 
her husband, Kyle Hickok, that Salazar was able to get the gadget to draw milk. 
The new mother felt like she was hogging the bathroom and, perhaps, 
embarrassing her colleagues and herself. 
</P>
<P>
"But my co-workers are very supportive of my breast-feeding," she writes. "The 
news director bends over backward to accommodate Mother Nature's schedule, 
allowing me to only go out on short stories so that I don't miss a pumping 
session." 
</P>
<P>
The majority of employers are not as supportive. Of 6 million U.S. companies, 
only a slim minority offer subsidies, referrals or on-site day care for working 
mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Some working mothers read a message in the writing on the wall: They feel they 
are not valued members of the labor force. Down at the TV station, Salazar 
found the kind of support many women crave -- and still there were tensions. 
</P>
<P>
"Nursing is something I felt very strongly about, but I had my doubts about how 
professional it would be," she reflects. "I'm pulled both ways . . . feeling 
guilty that I'm not doing either of (my jobs) very well." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Best of Both Worlds' 
</P>
<P>
"My name is Vicki Sugarman and my game is the 'Mommy Track,' " the new mother 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be very upset if we were just a token, " writes Janet Aikens, who with 
Sugarman shares a job managing promotions at Reebok International Ltd. in 
Stoughton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Sugarman and Aikens each work three days a week, overlapping on Wednesdays. The 
co-workers hit on the increasingly popular alternative to full-time work and 
motherhood after each became pregnant about the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
Job-sharing has required some adjustments to ensure both women are working on 
projects suited to their skills. All concerned eventually decided it would be 
easier for Aikens and Sugarman to split their hours but work independently. 
</P>
<P>
"I now have the best of both worlds!" writes Sugarman, 31. "I can maintain my 
professional status and still be with my daughter four days a week." 
</P>
<P>
But read between the lines: It wasn't quite that simple. 
</P>
<P>
The night before her first day back, Sugarman lay in bed staring at the clock 
and wondering how being both a mother and a manager would work out. 
</P>
<P>
"It is 3 in the morning and I am still wide awake just wondering: Will the baby 
think that I have deserted her? Will the nanny take good care of her? What will 
it be like to be back in the office? Have I forgotten everything I've ever 
learned? When will I ever fall asleep?" 
</P>
<P>
Aikens, too, has known fitful nights. 
</P>
<P>
Before the birth of her son, she was working 10 hours a day and traveling at 
least a week out of every month. Her husband, Andy, was matching her 
hour-for-hour at his job as an engineer for Raytheon Co. 
</P>
<P>
"I was determined not to let my pregnancy change anything, so I continued to 
work, work, work. . ." Aikens, 30, wrote after her first day back. "I wanted to 
be promoted to associate brand manager by year's end, as scheduled." 
</P>
<P>
But things changed. Priorities shifted. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision not to return to my career full time was a very difficult one for 
me. I had worked hard and long to get where I was . . . (but) there was 
Skyler," Aikens writes. 
</P>
<P>
"I can get my career back on track, but I can never recapture Skyler's 
childhood."

THE WORLD AS SEEN THROUGH A CHILD'S EYES; 
</P>
<P>
BOOKS: DORI SANDERS USES A 10-YEAR-OLD BLACK GIRL AS THE CENTRAL CHARACTER IN 
HER "GROWING-UP-IN-THE-SOUTH" NOVEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH KASTOR, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Victims of a too-warm winter and a too-late frost, the peaches were injured 
again, so last fall Dori Sanders did as she had done before. She left South 
Carolina and came north to set up tables for Christmas parties and arrange 
chairs for wedding receptions. 
</P>
<P>
It always goes like that. When bad weather hits York County, S.C., you can find 
her at this small motel near Andrews Air Force Base, Md., in her solid shoes 
and pink polo shirt with the restaurant logo, saving her farm by lugging 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
But by May she's usually long gone, her tables and chairs moved and her money 
made. This year, however, is different. The peach farmer and assistant banquet 
manager at the Best Western State Inn ("a gofer really," she says) is now the 
novelist. This trip is not a matter of arranging tables or saving peach farms. 
This trip is about fancy New York publishing lunches and book signings in 
Potomac and lectures at Spelman College and interviews in Chicago and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just so, so wonderful," says the author of "Clover," a lovingly reviewed 
novel about a 10-year-old black girl growing up on a South Carolina peach farm. 
"I wake up in the morning and say, 'Is this really me?' " 
</P>
<P>
Her former self never considered traveling to Chicago or Boston. Sanders was 
raised on her father's farm, a place she proudly describes as one of the oldest 
black-owned farms in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Her father was principal of a segregated elementary school in York (population 
around 8,000) as well as a farmer, and by now most of his children have left 
the land, moving on to college and careers and lives far from the peaches and 
sweet potatoes. But despite being a voracious reader, Dori did not go to 
college. Number eight out of 10 children, she kept coming back to the farm. Her 
tastes and habits are, she says, those of "country people," and even when she 
lived in various Southern cities she returned every summer. 
</P>
<P>
She is now at lunch, being served by a motel colleague and playfully delighted 
by the honor. But much as she admires the chef, she inspects each course as it 
arrives. She is pleased by what she sees, which is not how she felt recently 
when confronted by an assortment of mysterious and trendy objects in a New York 
salad. 
</P>
<P>
"The only kind of lettuce I really like is iceberg," she says. "And there 
wasn't any iceberg at all. Some of the things in this salad looked like 
flowers, and then there were these endives, or whatever you call them. I saw 
red cabbage, but I was told, 'No, Dori, it's not red cabbage, it's 
raaadicchiooo!' " She says the word in a tone so ornately refined it requires 
her to lift her chin elegantly and purse her mouth into a mere dot, and then 
she laughs. Among many other benefits, this book tour has added immeasurably to 
her store of accents. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm around you five seconds, I sponge up your speech," she says. "Get me 
out of the South for a minute and my voice changes. It's pure affectation of 
course. I've been playacting my entire life. And in a family with 10 children, 
you have a built-in audience." 
</P>
<P>
Dori Sanders at 55 is an engine that runs perpetually high. From the instant of 
meeting to the moment of departure she is talking and laughing and telling 
stories and commenting on her stories and complimenting the chef and imitating 
his accent and asking questions and forgetting words and remembering them and 
laughing again. 
</P>
<P>
She never does only one thing. Striding into an empty room, she reaches down 
automatically and without slowing picks up a tiny speck of something or other 
besmirching the floor. Reliable sources say she finally slows around dusk when 
her body, so used to rising and setting with the sun, rebels, but after a brief 
slump (or perhaps a brief nap taken sitting up) she revives and continues. 
</P>
<P>
It was that same energy that got her writing. She began with verbal snippets, 
brief descriptions of memories and sensations that she jotted down on motel 
cocktail napkins and old menus, which she then left lying around for anyone to 
stumble across. The person who stumbled across them repeatedly was Nancy 
Shulman, who owns the motel and for 10 years has allowed Sanders the freedom of 
working part time whenever necessary. Shulman was impressed and encouraged 
Sanders to continue writing, which she did until she had an entire novel. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more or less like a Gothic romance, only set in the deep South" is how 
Sanders describes that book. When she was done, much to her own surprise, 
Sanders found herself contacting Algonquin Press of Chapel Hill, N.C., a 
publisher she had read about in a newspaper, and sending off her manuscript. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured, 'He's in North Carolina, they can't be so big!' " she says. "New 
York -- I wouldn't have had the nerve. I wouldn't have sent it to New York. So 
I made a phone call, can you believe it? I just called." 
</P>
<P>
And -- can you believe it? -- the publisher responded. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't ever tell me there are no nice editors in the world," Sanders says, as 
if some people have tried to tell her just that. 
</P>
<P>
Algonquin publisher and editorial director Louis D. Rubin knew that he did not 
want to publish Sanders's submission, but he was struck by the grace with which 
she used language. 
</P>
<P>
"It was well-written in terms of what happened and everything, but it could 
have been written around 1900 by someone like Charles Chestnutt or Paul 
Lawrence Dunbar," he says. "It had that kind of melodramatic plot. It was as if 
Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison and Zora Neale Hurston (influential black 
writers who helped expand the field) had never existed. 
</P>
<P>
"But I wrote her back -- I don't usually do that if we're not going to take a 
book," he says. "But in this case she wrote a nice letter, and I said, 'Why not 
think about writing something you know, your own experience?' I thought that 
would prove the end of it, but lo and behold a year later in comes this 
manuscript and she had done just that." 
</P>
<P>
What she wrote was "Clover." This is how it starts: 
</P>
<P>
 They dressed me in white for my daddy's funeral. White from my head to my 
toes. I had the black skirt I bought at the six-dollar store all laid out to 
wear. I'd even pulled the black grosgrain bows off my black patent leather 
shoes to wear in my hair. But they won't let me wear black. 
</P>
<P>
 I know deep down in my heart you're supposed to wear black to a funeral. I 
guess my stepmother is not totally dressed in black because she just plain 
doesn't know any better. 
</P>
<P>
 "They dressed me in white for my daddy's funeral," Rubin says 
</P>
<P>
slowly, as if repeating the first sentence is enough to explain his admiration. 
</P>
<P>
Clover Hill, age 10, tells her own story in that straightforward language of 
children that veers from deadpan simplicity to crystalline poetry and back 
again. Her widowed father, an elementary school teacher in contemporary South 
Carolina, dies only hours after marrying a white woman, and Clover is left in 
the woman's care. The volume is short and physically tiny, a delicate thing 
with a pretty flowered cover, and the story is equally quiet. "Subtle," Louis 
Rubin calls it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so evenhanded, that's what is so remarkable about it," he says. "It 
doesn't take sides. I was a little worried before it got published that she 
might have some problems, writing out of a small-town black experience, that 
the book might not seem angry or militant enough, that people might object 
because it doesn't crusade. But it does it, so very subtly." 
</P>
<P>
There is tension and pettiness, pain and misunderstanding as Clover's family 
mourns and the white woman and the black world meet, but "Clover" remains a 
warm and hopeful book. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders too has worried that some may see her book as overly optimistic, and 
she rushes to defend it even before there is a sign she should. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in a segregated society. I went to a segregated school and didn't 
drink from the water fountain at the courthouse. But my father was both a 
landowner and a teacher and he was very well respected. And all farmers are 
affected by the weather, so if you need help to harvest before a storm, you 
call in the other farmers, you don't think black or white. 
</P>
<P>
"If I write from the view that things can work out between the races it's 
because I'm drawing on my youth. The differences in "Clover' are not so much a 
matter of color but cultural and culinary -- that's Clover's main concern, 
whether someone can cook grits well or someone doesn't want a wake in the 
house." 
</P>
<P>
And for Sanders, cultural and culinary differences are merely differences, 
obstacles to be overcome rather than unbreachable barriers. She knows that city 
people tend to be skeptical of such a view, just as a certain New York 
cabdriver was stunned that she had in fact heard of "Jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'Brace yourself! This is going to be a shock, but we have 
television on the farm!' " There were other things on the farm too, like a 
father who insisted that the table should always be covered with a clean cloth, 
who named one son Orestus and taught every one of his children to enunciate 
"Yes, sir." 
</P>
<P>
"My father was very formal," she says. "My mother called him 'Mr. Sanders,' and 
he called her a pet name -- 'Sugar.' Oh, she honored him; we all did." 
</P>
<P>
It was that Mr. Sanders upon whom she based Clover's father, Gaten Hill. 
Because she wanted Gaten Hill to be a college graduate, she researched colleges 
in the library before choosing Clemson for him. Like her father, the character 
has some stern formality to him, but he and his brother, Jim Ed, are also 
loving and humorous figures. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone said, why did I seem to tend to give the male that kind of image," she 
says, and answers, "That's what I know." 
</P>
<P>
"There is not a single monolithic black experience. You rarely see that there 
are black middle class farmers, and there have been for ages. People feel that 
everything is Oh-So-Terrible in the South. There is only one side of the South 
printed. When I speak of my South as being the kind that it was and it doesn't 
measure up to other people's image of the South, that doesn't mean it's not 
true. It doesn't make me a Pollyanna-brighten-the-corner-where-you-are." 
</P>
<P>
She is far less a Pollyanna than an enthusiast. Everything delights her, from 
the small basket carved from a ripe tomato by the hotel chef to the beautiful 
rocks on her land to the customers who stop by the roadside stand she operates 
in the summer. Some of those customers showed up at a Charlotte, N.C., book 
party for "Clover," bringing with them watermelon rind pickle and peach 
preserves they had made from fruit she had sold them. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-year-old Clover takes the same pleasure in life, whether the object be 
her father or a bird or a meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody knew something was bad wrong with Gaten when he wouldn't eat. At 
Sunday's dinner Gaten didn't eat chicken or rib one. Wouldn't even eat a 
spoonful of Everleen's banana pudding. I could have eaten the whole thing by 
myself. She puts Cool Whip on top instead of that egg white stuff. They said 
Gaten was in L.O.V.E. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders remembers her own 10th year as a time of great happiness, and in 
creating Clover hoped to find out what it would be like to be that child again. 
"Ten is something that is so special. Even if you don't play with them, you can 
still appreciate a doll. It's when you can really appreciate childhood -- 
you're about to lose it, but you hold on for a moment." 
</P>
<P>
"Clover" has been optioned by Disney, which means it may become a movie. 
Sanders knows how she will spend whatever profit there is. "What would a person 
do if she made money?" she asks for dramatic emphasis. "I'd buy new tractor 
tires. If anything happens from this book, that's what I want to do."

ALZHEIMER'S OTHER PRISONERS; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILIES: THE AFFLICTED AREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO SUFFER FROM ALZHEIMER'S. 
CARE-GIVERS, ONE AUTHOR SAYS, MUST LEARN TO LEAD AS NORMAL A LIFE AS POSSIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY JO KOCHAKIAN, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For those who take care of the millions of Alzheimer's patients, life is not 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
But people who care for loved ones with Alzheimer's disease have to try to make 
it so, says Sharon Fish, even when the disease forces a very different 
definition of normal. 
</P>
<P>
It's better to go out to eat now and then, even though you have to spoon-feed 
your loved one in the restaurant, than to feel as if you are trapped in the 
house, Fish says. 
</P>
<P>
It's better to hire a person to sit up in your house each night to guard 
against an Alzheimer's patient's wanderings than to be fatigued from lack of 
sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Fish, a nurse and a writer, has a mother with Alzheimer's disease. For 10 
years, Fish has been taking care of her; her experiences led to her book, 
"Alzheimer's: Caring for Your Loved One, Caring for Yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Caring for an Alzheimer's patient is bound to be exhausting. It's essential 
that care-givers maintain normal activities and have time away from the loved 
one, Fish says. But too often, the behaviors that can characterize Alzheimer's 
lead to greater isolation. 
</P>
<P>
For example, catastrophic reactions: When faced with frustration or too much 
stimulation, Alzheimer's patients can suddenly react with anxiety, abusiveness 
or even violent physical or verbal outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
One care-giver told Fish of her father's inability to decide what to eat at a 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to make him feel better about himself, so I would always ask him 
to choose what he wanted to eat; I wanted to give him a choice. But instead of 
feeling better, he became frustrated and upset because there were too many 
things to choose from. He couldn't process all that information, and once he 
even started to cry," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Such an experience might make it seem better just to stay at home; who needs 
the pain? But it's important that both the patient and the care-giver remain 
part of mainstream life, Fish says. 
</P>
<P>
Techniques for making such reactions less difficult include: 
</P>
<P>
* Avoiding situations that might trigger them, such as a crowded, bustling 
store; 
</P>
<P>
* Making life as predictable as possible; 
</P>
<P>
* Limiting choices; 
</P>
<P>
* Simplifying the activities of daily life, such as using clothing with zippers 
instead of buttons; 
</P>
<P>
* Not arguing with the patient or trying to reason with him or her; 
</P>
<P>
* Reacting in a calm way, using a soft voice. 
</P>
<P>
And, Fish advises, "avoid emotionally distancing yourself. Reach out with a 
warm embrace, a kiss, a touch of your hand. Affection can often defuse a 
difficult situation." 
</P>
<P>
While it's obvious that getting out of the house benefits a care-giver, it may 
not be so clear that it's good for the patient. But, says Fish, "always assume 
more understanding and comprehension than you actually see." 
</P>
<P>
Fish, for example, takes her mother to church on Sundays and on visits to 
friends' homes. A year ago, she couldn't: Her mother would wander off. But now 
her mother has declined further and is confined to a wheelchair. It's much 
easier to take her, and Fish is convinced her mother gets something out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"We go to friends' homes for dinner," Fish says. "People need to know they're 
still part of the family." 
</P>
<P>
It's essential that care-givers have time away from their responsibilities, 
Fish says. Too often, home health aides are hired to stay with the patient 
while a care-giver goes to work or does errands, but not for the care-giver to 
have time for other activities. 
</P>
<P>
It's great for a care-giver to go to the movies, play golf or do whatever else 
he or she likes. But perhaps some of the best-spent time away from home is in a 
support group, Fish says. 
</P>
<P>
"If a person doesn't have a support system, their emotions get quite out of 
control," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Her 10 years of care-giving to her ever-deteriorating mother have not been 
entirely negative, she says. "I was always real close to my mother. But the 
feeling now is much deeper -- I've mellowed out. I've learned a lot in relation 
to patience."

MARINES REMEMBER THE BEIRUT BOMBING; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: THE OLD WOUNDS, THE NIGHTMARES, AND THE CONSTANT BATTLES TO FIND JOBS 
AND RESTRUCTURE THEIR LIVES ALL HAVE TAKEN THEIR TOLL ON VETERANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA BOUSTANY, THE WASHINGTON POST; Nora Boustany covered Lebanon for the 
Washington Post and is now on assignment in the Middle East. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven years after a massive suicide bombing blew a U.S. Marine headquarters 
south of Beirut into a pile of concrete and dust and killed 241 Marines, the 
survivors soldier on amid the hardships of forgotten heroism and abandoned 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
The fleeting moment of horror that eventually drove the United States out of 
Lebanon still reverberates in their lives. The Beirut Marine veterans are 
hurting from long-healed wounds, from recurrent nightmares, and from fighting 
uphill battles to find jobs and restructure their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Some men were discharged for heavy drinking. Others, who suffered minor 
injuries but stayed on to help dig up corpses and remains, say they still 
suffer severe depression and are reclusive and unresponsive to friends or 
parents of fellow Marines who have tried to stay in touch. 
</P>
<P>
For many survivors, adjustment was forced by circumstance, but few can let go 
of those devastating seconds on that deceptively beautiful Sunday morning -- 
Oct. 23, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The tough Battalion Landing Team building at the Marine barracks just off the 
highway to Beirut's airport had endured air raids when the Palestine Liberation 
Organization occupied it and concentrated artillery barrages when the Israeli 
Army held it. 
</P>
<P>
But suddenly, a single, powerful bomb in a suicide truck reduced the four-story 
building to a tumbling mountain slide. The blast knocked the Marines out of 
their bunk beds and cots, hurling them out windows, not only killing 241, but 
injuring dozens more, some for life. 
</P>
<P>
Staff Sgt. Steve E. Russell was in the lobby of the building when the suicide 
driver crashed through the gate of the Marine barracks. He had the presence of 
mind to yell "Hit the deck!" three times to his men before charging out. 
</P>
<P>
But to this day, he says, he suffers from survivor-guilt complex and 
post-traumatic stress disorder along with his other injuries. He was discharged 
from the Marines on medical disability last month. 
</P>
<P>
Russell woke up with his left thigh bone broken into three pieces, a fractured 
left ankle, a cracked right pelvis, a broken left hand. His left knee and leg 
were laid wide open and he lost a large chunk of his right thigh. "It looked 
like a shark had bitten through it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Pablo Arroyo was contemplating getting up when a fellow Marine, Dana 
Spaulding, walked into their room on the third floor. "Everything just 
erupted," Arroyo said. But he heard nothing: Both his eardrums were ruptured 
instantly. 
</P>
<P>
"I was buried under debris," he said. "It took me 15 minutes to get out from 
under. When I looked up, I saw limbs in the trees, arms and legs in the rubble 
around me." Arroyo's right leg was oozing like jelly, he had 21 puncture wounds 
and a hole in his head and he had lost all his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Flying to Frankfurt aboard a C-130 cargo plane, Arroyo remembers staring up at 
a thick canvas stretcher dripping with blood. "Pablo, I thought to myself, no 
matter how bad you are, you are better off than the guy above you. But I was 
beginning to hurt real bad by then. . . . I kept thinking: The Marine Corps, 
the Marine Corps, the Marine Corps. This pulled me through everything." 
</P>
<P>
Lance Cpl. Jeffrey Nashton was one of the more critically wounded -- a 
fractured skull, burns on his face, two collapsed lungs, deep cuts in his 
chest, a broken leg -- and was barely holding on to life in the intensive-care 
unit at the Ramstein Air Force Base in West Germany. When Gen. P.X. Kelley, the 
Marine commandant, arrived at his bedside, Nashton could not see him through 
his wounds and burns. 
</P>
<P>
"They woke me up. Gen. Kelley leaned over and said who he was," he recalled. "I 
grabbed him by the collar and counted his four stars with my fingers. I 
motioned that I wanted to write something. Someone gave me a pad. I wrote with 
my left hand: Semper Fi. Always faithful. He knew. It was one Marine talking to 
another Marine, a language we both understood." 
</P>
<P>
The Beirut survivors were given expeditionary medals, combat-action ribbons and 
Purple Hearts for their wounds. But none of this, it seems, helped some of them 
carry on with their lives. Russell, Arroyo and Nashton are three of those still 
trying to make the adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
Russell could easily have obtained a medical discharge in 1983, according to an 
officer in his unit, but he stayed on with the Marines. It took him a year 
before he regained the strength in his legs and could run again. He became a 
drill instructor, channeling his motivation and energy into training other 
Marines. 
</P>
<P>
But last year Russell broke the same ankle again and injured his knee. After a 
protracted dispute with the Marines over his health, Russell last month retired 
with a 30% disability judgment from the Corps he loved, ending an 11-year 
career that he had once hoped would continue all his life. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of heartbreaking -- he wanted to stay in," said his wife, Wanda, 
in a telephone interview from their home in Jacksonville, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been fighting too hard for too long, and I am just not winning any 
more," Russell said dejectedly before his retirement. "Emotionally, I am having 
difficulty. It is interfering with me, my work, my family. It is just better 
for me to get out of the military." 
</P>
<P>
Russell saw a psychiatrist once a week for post-traumatic stress disorder. He 
acts out his nightmares and wakes up in the morning standing on the bed or 
walking around the house. He no longer dares to go hunting, a former passion. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I can work it out (with the Veterans Administration) so I can go back 
to school," he said. "There are a lot of dreams I had." 
</P>
<P>
Russell's plight disturbs another Beirut survivor, Sgt. Michael Toma. "When 
they look at his records and see how messed up he is and only offer him so 
much, it seems the Marine Corps is just not recognizing him enough," said Toma. 
"His legs hurt, not to mention his other problems. He should not have to go 
through this." 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo, now 29, survived the bloody flight to Frankfurt, recovered from his 
wounds and left the Marine Corps three years ago to become a state trooper in 
Bristol, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo insists that more should be done for those still struggling with the 
memory of Beirut. "Memorials are too little, too late," he said. "Don't 
celebrate me after I am dead. Give me something I can see and take part in when 
I am alive." 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo says he still bears a grudge, especially against the politicians who 
denounced the Beirut mission even before the bodies were flown home. Yet he 
believes that the experience has made him not take anything for granted. "In 
order to visualize the value of freedom or the price of life, you must come 
close to losing your life or freedom," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Nashton, the Marine who scribbled "Semper Fi" to Gen. Kelley, was awarded a 
Purple Heart and a plaque bearing four stars, the words "Semper Fi" and 
Kelley's signature. Now 31 and working in a car-body shop in Jacksonville, 
Fla., Nashton was asked how he was doing nowadays. He started to cry. 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons saved his life, inserting a metal plate in his head. But he had 
suffered motor damage in the blast and found his Marine Corps career in 
tatters, and after a series of embittering disappointments, he was discharged 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest thing was coming back to Jacksonville, going to work every day and 
not knowing anybody," Nashton said. His only skills were auto-body repair. "I 
don't know what life would be like had the bombing not occurred. Every time 
something happens to me I wonder if it is because of Beirut." 
</P>
<P>
At least a dozen other Marine survivors named friends who had fallen by the 
wayside or "gone down the tubes," unable to find jobs or stay out of trouble 
with the law. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a fear of losing oneself and again being alienated," says clinical 
psychologist Jeffrey Jay, of the Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Studies, a 
new private nonprofit research center in Washington. "Afraid (that) people may 
find you sick, or dwelling on the past. There is a certain fear of how to talk 
about it in a way that is acceptable. The person who is victimized will have to 
fit in, and the people he comes back to tell him, 'Let's get involved with the 
great things in life.' It creates a division within the person." 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrist Robert J. Ursano of the Uniformed Services University of Health 
Sciences, the nation's military medical school, notes that the Beirut bombing, 
though traumatic to the Marine victims, was "just one event" for millions of 
Americans who weren't there. 
</P>
<P>
"How something that was so important to an individual may be no more than a 
transitory moment on television for others could be hard to deal with. Always 
wondering who understands and who doesn't. . . . The issue is how the 
experience is reintegrated in your life." 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by bureaucracy and red tape, by the difficulty of getting medical 
care near home and by what they perceive as unfair disability payments, scores 
of Marines have given up fighting what one described as a "wearing-down 
process." 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen former Marines said they believe they had not received the same 
treatment or recognition as veterans of other conflicts. Unlike the Vietnam 
veterans, who became a political force, the few Beirut vets have no galvanizing 
organization to help them gain entitlement to preferential points for state 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Many families and survivors encountered federal privacy-law restrictions, 
making it difficult to locate one another for support networks and delaying 
recovery from the trauma of the bombing. Others struggled tirelessly to 
overcome physical and emotional handicaps, only to lose steam when they needed 
it most. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Muffler of Warminster, Pa., lost her son 19-year-old son, John. With Judy 
Young of Morristown, N.J., who lost her son, Jeff, Muffler has been putting out 
a newsletter, the Beirut Connection, to stay in touch with the families and 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the survivors have been forgotten," she said. "These are young 
fellows. They have a long time to go on with their lives, and it is just not 
happening. It has been seven years, and they are still troubled and not being 
recognized." 
</P>
<P>
For those who escaped with no physical injuries, the emotional scars are 
nonetheless deep, and the disturbing memory of a task unfinished lingers on. 
</P>
<P>
"The suffering of those men, their pain and the frustration of not completing 
the mission . . . I don't think it will leave me," said Robert Jordan, a major 
who retired from the Marine Corps in 1984. "My mission is to keep it alive, not 
only for Lebanon but for our country's sake." 
</P>
<P>
John Knippel, 67, a survivor of World War II, Korea and Vietnam, lost his son, 
James, 21, in the Beirut bombing. "For a couple of months, I lingered on the 
verge of insanity. I go to Mass daily, and for the first three months I went to 
the cemetery every day. Now we have three new grandchildren. One of them is 
named James. We watch them grow, and all the love we would have given to Jim we 
shower upon our grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
With Carmella Laspada of No Greater Love, a nonprofit organization concerned 
with the care of hostages and their families, Knippel arranged for the planting 
of a cedar of Lebanon at Arlington National Cemetery, where his son is buried 
along with 25 other Marines. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke of their deaths with sorrow and dignity: "That cedar tree from Lebanon 
provides a sense of continuation. . . . It connects the families with the soil 
of where their sons died. . . . We cry a lot, but not openly. We have become 
much more sensitive to others' tragedies."

MAN GETS 30 YEARS IN RAMPAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a rare detour from its policy against plea bargaining, the district 
attorney's office approved a 30-year prison term Wednesday for a Port Hueneme 
man who agreed to plead guilty to abducting, raping and assaulting a woman and 
her 7-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kenneth R. Yegan sentenced Justo Q. Dungca 
to 30 years in prison for the July 19-20 rampage after the prosecutor 
negotiated the plea bargain with Dungca's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"These two people were victimized by Mr. Dungca in what can only be described 
as one of the most brutal, vicious, atrocious incidents I've ever seen in 20 
years in this business," Yegan said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Vincent J. O'Neill Jr. said his office allows plea 
bargaining only under special circumstances. In this case, prosecutors agreed 
to let Dungca plead guilty in exchange for a guaranteed sentence so the victims 
would not have to testify, O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
Dungca, who has no prior criminal record, has admitted that his 24-hour crime 
spree began when he became distraught after his girlfriend left him. 
</P>
<P>
He admitted that he sexually assaulted the mother and child in their residence, 
put the girl into a duffel bag and tried to stuff the mother into a suitcase 
with holes drilled in it for ventilation. He then forced the two into the 
woman's car and drove them toward Orange County, where his former girlfriend 
lived. 
</P>
<P>
When they reached Anaheim, the woman broke free at a gas station and alerted 
police, but Dungca drove on with the child to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas police converged on Dungca at an auto dealership, where clerks had 
notified police that the car Dungca was trying to trade in had been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
As police closed in, authorities said, Dungca wrapped the girl's hair around 
his hands and slammed her head against the floor, then choked her before he was 
captured by police. The child was treated at a local hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
Police found that the woman's signature on the car's title had been forged and 
that Dungca had an uncashed Internal Revenue Service refund check that had been 
taken from the woman several weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Dungca pleaded guilty Oct. 25 to two counts of kidnaping and one count each of 
committing a forcible lewd act on a child, sexual battery by restraint, false 
imprisonment of a hostage, grand theft and a special allegation of use of a 
knife. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neill agreed to drop the remaining two counts of sexual battery in connection 
with the assault on the mother, one count of child molestation and one count of 
attempted murder. Also, Clark County, Nev., police have agreed not to prosecute 
Dungca in light of his guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
With time off for good behavior, Dungca could be released as early as 2005, 
Yegan said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California Water Co., working with three service groups, will present 
charities in the area with 350 turkeys to be distributed to needy families 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The water company asked Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) to help 
coordinate disbursement of the turkeys in the second annual "Operation Gobble." 
</P>
<P>
Working with Simi Valley Care and Share, the Knights of Columbus and the Rotary 
Club, Wright will help distribute the turkeys to the most needy people in the 
area, her aides said. 
</P>
<P>
In other holiday action, the Ventura Jaycees announced that the group will bake 
300 dozen cookies to send to the 1,800 Port Hueneme-based Seabees deployed in 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the project "A little home for the holidays," the Jaycees are scheduled 
to bake and package the cookies at Pizza Hut on Main Street all day Saturday, 
Dec. 1. The Jaycees are seeking $10 donations, for which the donor's name and 
address will be included on a dozen cookies shipped to the troops overseas.

SENIORS' AGENCY GETS NEW DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Simi Valley resident has taken over the helm of a Thousand Oaks senior 
citizens social service agency whose executive director resigned three months 
ago over a cut in his workweek. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Fields, 38, has assumed the position of executive director of the Conejo 
Valley Senior Concerns Inc., a nonprofit agency that operates a senior citizens 
day-care center and Meals on Wheels program. 
</P>
<P>
Fields, the former executive director of the Boys and Girls Club of Simi 
Valley, is chairman of the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District Board of 
Directors. 
</P>
<P>
Fields hopes to boost the revenues of the agency, which plans to open an 
expanded day-care center for frail elderly people. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Concerns needs money to continue running a hot line for senior citizens 
and a thrift store, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Hegarty resigned as director in September after budget cuts forced Senior 
Concerns to trim his hours to 30 a week. Hegarty worked for Senior Concerns for 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
More than $25,000 was trimmed from salaries because of a drop in revenues, said 
Fields, who declined to state his salary. The agency now has a $280,000 budget. 
</P>
<P>
Fields said Senior Concerns is expecting a dramatic jump in its operating costs 
next year when it opens the 5,600-square-foot Fitzgerald House. The new center 
at Hodencamp Road and Hillcrest Drive will more than quintuple the size of the 
existing Fitzgerald House at 591 E. Hillcrest Drive. PSYCHE PASCUAL

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DOOMED BUILDING TO GET HISTORICAL 
EVALUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The demolition of Glendale's 61-year-old Public Service Building has been 
halted while its historical value and the costs involved in preserving it are 
explored. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's three-member Environmental and Planning Board last Thursday 
unanimously ordered the preparation of an environmental impact report on the 
building after the Glendale Historical Society and the Los Angeles chapter of 
the American Institute of Architects objected to its proposed demolition. 
</P>
<P>
The board -- which consists of Glendale's planning director, public works 
director and city attorney -- rejected a staff proposal that the building be 
preserved only in photographs and videos. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's decision does not guarantee that the building will be saved, said 
David Bobardt, a city planner. But he said the environmental study will 
evaluate the building's historical significance and look at ways to keep it in 
public or private use. 
</P>
<P>
He said the study will take about eight months to complete.

CONTROLLED BURNS PROMPT INQUIRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 50 controlled burns took place throughout Ventura County on 
Wednesday, sending smoke through the air and prompting residents to wonder if 
there was a brush fire. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 people called the County Government Center to ask what was on fire, 
said Larry Scott, an inspector with the Air Pollution Control District. 
</P>
<P>
The agricultural burns are used to dispose of such things as tumbleweeds and 
old trees that have been cut down to make room for new crops and can take place 
only on days forecast for certain weather conditions that help disperse smoke 
and ash, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
However, contrary to the forecast, Wednesday turned out to be a poor day for 
burning, said Herm Ragsdale, an air quality specialist with the district. 
</P>
<P>
An air mass held pollutants near ground level rather than letting them escape, 
Ragsdale said. CAROL WATSON

SECRETARY TO SCHAEFER QUITS OVER FIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer's secretary resigned Wednesday, saying she 
could no longer work for the lame-duck supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Claassen said her decision was based, in part, on the supervisor's 
dismissal of another staff member Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer ordered aide Doug Johnson out of her Thousand Oaks office during an 
angry confrontation after she found out that he had agreed to take a job with 
her successor, Maria K. VanderKolk. 
</P>
<P>
Claassen said she turned in her resignation Wednesday partly "because I was 
very upset about the way Madge treated Doug. It was terrible. He is the most 
loyal, professional individual I have ever known, and she told him he didn't 
know anything about loyalty." 
</P>
<P>
Claassen said she was also upset about Schaefer's assertions to reporters 
Tuesday that she had not fired Johnson but only placed him on leave. According 
to the secretary, Schaefer had directed another staff member to draw up 
Johnson's termination papers after the confrontation, then changed her mind 
when she found out that Johnson was entitled to 60 days severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer refused to comment on Claassen's resignation. The supervisor said 
previously that she dismissed Johnson because he had not told her about his job 
plans, which she learned of through an anonymous letter last weekend. DARYL

WOMAN WHO LURED 2 GIRLS FOR KILLER IS FOUND GUILTY; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: MARCIA LYNN RAMOS IS CONVICTED OF SECOND-DEGREE MURDER. JURORS REJECT 
DEFENSE CLAIMS THAT SHE WAS AS MUCH A VICTIM OF ROLAND NORMAN COMTOIS AS WERE 
THE TWO CHATSWORTH TEEN-AGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jurors on Wednesday convicted a woman of second-degree murder for her part in 
helping a drifter kill a Chatsworth girl and shoot and sexually assault her 
companion. 
</P>
<P>
But the jury spared Marcia Lynn Ramos, 36, from the possibility of death in the 
gas chamber by acquitting her of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos sat expressionless as the clerk read the eight verdicts, reached after 
eight days of deliberations that followed a 3 1/2-week trial in San Fernando 
Superior Court. Members of the victims' families later said they were satisfied 
with the verdicts, despite the conviction on the lesser murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad she won't be out for a long, long time," said Lynne Masuhara, mother 
of the slain girl, 14-year-old Wendy Masuhara. "I didn't expect her to get 
first-degree" murder. 
</P>
<P>
Masuhara said she was not disappointed that Ramos will not face the death 
penalty. She said she was most concerned that Ramos not walk away from the 
trial a free person. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of the surviving girl said outside the courtroom: "I am so pleased 
that it's over with. I'm pleased about the verdict. They did find her guilty 
and she is going to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to convicting Ramos of second-degree murder, the jury found her 
guilty of attempted second-degree murder, three sexual assault charges, two 
counts of kidnaping and a count of furnishing a minor with cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
She could have faced the death penalty or life in prison without the 
possibility of parole if convicted of first-degree murder and three "special 
circumstances," including the allegation that the murder occurred in the course 
of a kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said after the verdict that they had difficulty believing the defense's 
claim that Ramos was as much a victim of killer Roland Norman Comtois as were 
the two girls. But they also said they did not believe the prosecution's 
position that Ramos intended to have the girls killed when she lured them into 
Comtois' camper on a Chatsworth street late on Sept. 18, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Comtois, 61, was sentenced in July to die in the gas chamber for his part in 
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Several jurors said they thought that if Ramos were truly a victim, she would 
have tried to flee or yell for help when she exited the camper to lure the 
girls inside. Ramos, a convicted prostitute who said Comtois supplied her with 
cocaine while she lived with him in the camper for nearly two months, testified 
that Comtois pointed a gun at her and threatened to kill her if she did not 
comply with his wishes. 
</P>
<P>
Though the verdict was not what either the prosecution or the defense had 
sought, both sides expressed satisfaction. While she was saved from the gas 
chamber, Ramos still faces 55 to 70 years in prison when she is sentenced Jan. 
25, according to estimates by both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"She isn't going anywhere," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Rosalie L. Morton, who 
substituted for trial prosecutor Harold S. Lynn at Wednesday's verdict reading. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a victory to us that we saved her life and that she didn't get convicted 
of first-degree murder," said Alex R. Kessel, one of Ramos' two court-appointed 
defense lawyers. "We put on all the evidence we could." 
</P>
<P>
The kidnaping took place as the girls were walking in their Chatsworth 
neighborhood to meet several friends at the corner of Devonshire Street and 
Lurline Avenue. Ramos emerged from the camper and asked them to help her start 
it. After they entered the vehicle, Comtois pointed a gun at them, tied them up 
and gagged them, the surviving victim, who was 13 at the time, testified. 
</P>
<P>
After sexually assaulting the 13-year-old, he drove the girls to remote Woolsey 
Canyon Road west of Canoga Park, placed them in an abandoned station wagon and 
shot both in the head. Masuhara died instantly, but the other girl survived 
because her upraised hand deflected the bullet.

RESULTS OF ELECTION CERTIFIED BY CLERK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a week of hand-counting votes to check computer figures, Ventura County 
Clerk Richard D. Dean on Wednesday certified the results of the Nov. 6 
election, including the victory of a new school board member who won by one 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy about it and eager to start working," said Lloyd G. Simpson 
Jr., who was elected to the Briggs Elementary School Board by one vote. 
"Hopefully, the new board can make a difference in the next four years." 
</P>
<P>
The certified results show that Simpson, a forestry biologist at UC Santa 
Barbara, edged out Jeff Williams by a vote of 256 to 255 for a seat on the 
rural school board, which oversees two elementary schools outside Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a pest-control manager at Limoneira Co., said he was "99% sure" that 
he would not request a recount at his own expense. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm told that they were going to do some extra checking on this race because 
it was so close," Williams said. "At this point, I'd say, congratulations, 
Lloyd Simpson. I know he'll do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
The results released Wednesday also showed that Mindy Lorenz, a write-in 
candidate for the fledgling Green Party, received 394 votes in the 
congressional race that reelected Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura). 
</P>
<P>
Her low vote total accounted for about 1/2% of the votes cast in Ventura County 
in the 19th Congressional District contest. Santa Barbara County, which is also 
included in the district, will not have its write-in votes tallied until next 
week, an official said. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny Harrison, a Ventura County deputy county clerk, said the week of 
hand-counting ballots turned up no discrepancies in vote totals tallied by 
computer on election night. 
</P>
<P>
She said Dean signed a form Wednesday that certified the election results. At 
its meeting Tuesday, the County Board of Supervisors will take formal action to 
declare results official. KENNETH R. WEISS

DON'T DELAY TRANSIT IMPROVEMENTS TOO LONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to offer some comments on the recently defeated Measure A 
Transportation Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
A popular television commercial for an oil filter points out that you can pay 
now for a new filter -- or later with a new engine. 
</P>
<P>
An analogy can be drawn to transportation needs in Ventura County. There is a 
very clear need to address our transportation problems, including projects on 
U. S. 101 at Vineyard Avenue and Johnson Drive, completion of the Moorpark 
Freeway, the commuter train from Moorpark and Simi Valley, improved public 
transit systems, building bicycle paths throughout the county, dial-a-ride and 
improved services for our elderly and handicapped citizens, etc. 
</P>
<P>
The voters have determined not to pay for these services now, but the need will 
only grow, as will the cost. Eventually, we will pay. Let us hope that we don't 
delay too long as costs rise, pollution only gets worse and our 
transit-dependent citizens wait at home. 
</P>
<P>
It took Orange County voters three attempts to realize that they could no 
longer afford the delay. I hope the sensible people of Ventura County learn 
this lesson much sooner.

SAFETY ADVISER FOR MOBIL MAY NOT BE NAMED UNTIL JANUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A safety adviser to oversee the Mobil Oil Corp. refinery in Torrance may not be 
named until January because the search is taking longer than expected, city 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance City Council was expected to recommend its nominee for the 
court-supervised post by today. But council members decided Tuesday to extend 
the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very difficult decision. That's why it's taking some time," Mayor Katy 
Geissert said. 
</P>
<P>
The post is being created as part of a pretrial settlement reached last month 
in the public nuisance lawsuit filed against Mobil by the city. The adviser 
will have the power to oversee the refinery for the next seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most important part of the agreement, this safety adviser," 
Councilman Tim Mock said. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, announced Oct. 18, calls for the city and Mobil to exchange 
names of potential advisers by today, 30 days after the agreement was 
processed. If the city and Mobil cannot agree on someone, the judge overseeing 
the settlement is to choose the adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Geissert said the council had narrowed its list of candidates to two firms by 
Tuesday evening but that council members wanted more time to make a decision. 
Neither she nor other council members would disclose the names of those firms. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil's lawyers agreed to give the city more time, said City Atty. Kenneth L. 
Nelson. The timetable now calls for the city and Mobil to exchange names of 
candidates on or before Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Several council members said Mobil has indicated that it is leaning toward 
Westinghouse Electric Corp. for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil Refinery Manager Joel H. Maness, in an interview Tuesday, would neither 
confirm nor deny that the oil company will recommend Westinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it would be appropriate for us to discuss any of the candidates 
we've interviewed," Maness said. 
</P>
<P>
However, John Fasnacht, an engineering manager for Westinghouse, said Wednesday 
that the firm has discussed the safety adviser job with Mobil officials and 
attorneys for the city. Fasnacht said he did not know what other firms may be 
under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear when the identity of the safety adviser will be made public. 
</P>
<P>
Maness said he does not think either the city or Mobil should release names of 
firms under consideration for the job until they agree on a joint 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be amazed if the city is going to have any public announcement" of its 
nominee, Maness said. The announcement should wait until the city and Mobil 
have agreed on an adviser, "rather than having public announcements made on 
intermediate steps," Maness said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ralph Nutter, a lawyer representing the city, said last week he believes 
the council should vote publicly on its choice of a safety adviser. Nelson said 
Tuesday that some sort of public announcement of the city's nominee would be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
The safety adviser is seen as an important element in the wide-ranging 
settlement of the lawsuit, brought against Mobil by the city in April, 1989. 
The suit, which followed a series of accidents and deaths at the sprawling 
refinery, sought to have the plant declared a public nuisance and to obtain 
authority for the city to regulate it. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the city and Mobil agreed on a settlement only a few weeks before 
the trial of the suit was due to start Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
In the settlement, Mobil agreed to phase out its use of highly toxic 
hydrofluoric acid by the end of 1997 unless it can develop a safer form of the 
chemical by the end of 1994. The safety adviser will have to approve the 
modified use of the acid. 
</P>
<P>
The adviser will also be empowered to investigate a wide range of issues at the 
refinery, including fire-fighting procedures, seismic safety and the handling 
of hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
The adviser is expected to be an engineering consulting firm. The choice will 
not be easy, since the adviser should be knowledgeable about the oil industry 
without having strong ties to Mobil, city officials and environmentalists have 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is learning right now," said Councilman Dan Walker. "We're learning a 
great deal about how this selection process works, and the questions to ask, 
and how to get the information." 
</P>
<P>
Walker compared the city's relationship with the safety adviser to a seven-year 
marriage. "It's got to be done incredibly carefully," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The safety adviser will make reports on the refinery every three months. 
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear if those reports will be made public. Mobil spokesman James 
A. Carbonetti said the company would oppose release of any proprietary portions 
of the reports. He said Mobil would want to discuss with the city what 
constitutes proprietary information. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil plans to conduct periodic public updates to describe what it is doing to 
conform with the adviser's recommendations, Carbonetti said. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't be a deep, dark secret," he said. "We will be conducting press 
briefings on this."

8 TEEN-AGE MOTHERS ADD THEIR NAMES TO FIGHT AGAINST ILLITERACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As the teen-age graduates crowded into their classroom Tuesday, the girls 
whispered and giggled at the sight of the achievement certificates awaiting 
them. And as soon as they had dropped off their babies in the day-care room, 
the ceremony began. 
</P>
<P>
With a rose, a photocopied certificate and a hug from their teacher, eight 
teen-age mothers celebrated their first major academic achievement Tuesday: 
They completed a nine-month special education program in Pacoima that improved 
their reading skills, and taught them to prepare a healthy meal and calm a 
cranky baby. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started this I didn't know how to read. I had to ask someone for help 
in everything," said Lisa Stanley, 18, mother of a 2 1/2-year-old boy and 
10-month-old girl. "Now I can read some books to my son. I just feel better 
about myself." 
</P>
<P>
The Pacoima branch of El Nido Services -- a nonprofit child-, youth- and 
parent-counseling organization -- was awarded a onetime, $25,000 grant by the 
Kaiser Permanente foundation about a year ago to create a nine-month literacy 
program for eight teen-age mothers. 
</P>
<P>
But what began as a structured reading class turned into a "life skills" 
course, said teacher Cindy Friedman, who devised reading lessons on topics such 
as health, nutrition and raising children. 
</P>
<P>
These eight girls can be found classified among many disturbing California 
statistics -- the 20% high school dropout rate, an estimated 71,700 pregnant 
teen-agers and teen-age mothers under 18. 
</P>
<P>
And like half of the 16- to 19-year-old mothers and three out of four of the 
14- to 15-year-old mothers in the nation -- according to a report by state 
education authorities -- they lacked basic academic skills. 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday, these eight vowed to become statistic-busters. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that if I want to get ahead in my life I need to learn how to 
comprehend what I read," said Carrie Williams, 17, who intends to enroll in an 
adult vocational school. "I guess I realize now I have options for my 
education." 
</P>
<P>
Two girls left midway through the program to return to high school. The other 
six say they are returning to high school or adult vocational programs offered 
by the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The El Nido program offered two services key to the success of education 
programs for teen-age mothers -- a bus pass for transportation and day care for 
the children, said Ronda Simpson-Brown, coordinator of teen-age pregnancy and 
parenting programs for the California Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
She said programs such as El Nido's are direly needed because 90% of California 
schools offering teen-age parent education have long waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie, 17, said it was a struggle to pack up her son for the twice-a-week 
classes and take two buses to school. She said, however, it was worth it 
because in nine months she improved her reading skills from third- to 
fifth-grade level. 
</P>
<P>
And she intends to proudly display her achievement certificate to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
"I already bought a frame," she said. "It's going right in the living room, 
right where everyone who walks in the door can see it."

CONSERVATIVE JOINS WILSON PANEL; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: A GLENDALE CONSULTANT ACTIVE IN THE GOVERNOR-ELECT'S CAMPAIGN IS 
APPOINTED TO HIS TRANSITION TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale business and political consultant with strong ties to the 
conservative wing of the Republican Party has been named to an advisory council 
formed to assist Gov.-elect Pete Wilson in his transition to power. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Barnett, 43, long a quiet Republican Party insider, on Tuesday became one 
of 35 members of Wilson's transition team, a bipartisan group of appointees 
including people in government and business, women and minorities, and experts 
on education and social services. 
</P>
<P>
The council will convene next month and disband in January when Wilson is 
inaugurated, said Otto Bos, the team's director of communications. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett said he has worked out of his Glendale house since the summer of 1989, 
advising a wide range of organizations on government regulations, legislation 
and marketing strategies. 
</P>
<P>
His clients have included the Western States Petroleum Assn., nonprofit groups 
such as the California Conservation Coalition and several Indian reservations, 
which he tried to help with economic development projects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Bos and Republican Party officials said Barnett was chosen for the advisory 
team mainly because he communicates well with conservative party members. 
</P>
<P>
"Lou has served as a very valuable sounding board for what's in the hearts and 
minds of the people in the social conservative movement," Bos said. "We also 
chose Lou because he served us exceptionally well on the campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett, a self-described devout Catholic who has seven children, has worked 
through the state Republican Party for "traditional values" and conservative 
groups, such as the California Families Coalition, he said. He is a former 
national political director of Citizens for the Republic, a political action 
committee formed in 1976 by former President Ronald Reagan, who was then former 
governor of California and the leading spokesman for the conservative wing of 
the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
He has mostly worked quietly in the background for Republican Party candidates 
and interests, said Dan Schnur, a party spokesman. Barnett worked as both a 
volunteer and paid consultant for Wilson's campaign, recruiting support from 
conservative black and religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett said he expects Wilson, whose ideology is not as conservative as his 
own, to be a "very acceptable governor." 
</P>
<P>
"I expect Pete to go down in the record books as a proactive type of governor," 
he said. "I just think he's a prince of a guy." 
</P>
<P>
Barnett ran for the state Assembly in 1978, losing to Assemblyman Pat Nolan in 
the 41st District primary. But, he said, he is not interested in an appointment 
to Wilson's staff.

RANCHO PALOS VERDES OKS DEAL FOR WASTE PICKUP AND RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council on Tuesday approved a five-year franchise 
agreement with Waste Management of California Inc. to pick up trash and 
recyclables at all multiple-family residential complexes beginning Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Waste Management also holds a franchise on trash collection for most of the 
single-family residential units in Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
(Ivy Rubbish Disposal Services serves fewer than 500 residences in the 
Portuguese Bend area.) 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, the cost of trash pickup at townhouses, 
condominiums and apartments will vary depending on the number of times trash is 
picked up and the size and number of trash bins at each site. 
</P>
<P>
The city negotiated with Waste Management for the flat rate per bin, bin size 
and number of pickups per week. For example, one three-cubic-yard bin picked up 
once a week will cost $63 per month. The same bin picked up six days a week 
would cost $162 per month. 
</P>
<P>
A comparative analysis by the city of rates that residential complexes are 
presently paying shows many rates will go up, some by as much as 100%. Public 
Works Director George Wentz told the council that the old rates did not include 
a franchise fee or a recycling fee. He said that in some instances trash 
collection companies employed by the housing complexes had not increased rates 
recently because they knew the city was preparing to seek trash collection 
bids. 
</P>
<P>
Funds earned from the sale of recyclables collected in the city will come back 
to the city to help pay the costs of implementing a state law that requires 
cities to significantly curtail the amount of waste headed for landfills.

PASS THE WORD -- A STRONG VOCABULARY IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY YARBER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES: Mary Yarber teaches journalism and 
English at an area high school. She writes a weekly column on education for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The importance of a strong vocabulary for children cannot be overstated. 
Students with the best vocabulary perform the best in college entrance exams 
and job interviews, and well-spoken people also have the upper hand in almost 
every imaginable social situation. 
</P>
<P>
Grade school is the best time to start helping your child develop language 
skills. There are many ways that you can do this while having fun and 
strengthening your bond with your grade-school child. 
</P>
<P>
The easiest and most important way to enlarge your child's vocabulary is by 
taking turns reading out loud, said Ilene Rotenberg, a teacher at Westminster 
Computer Magnet School in Venice. "It sounds obvious," Rotenberg said, "but so 
many parents don't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Before reading together, pull out all of the words that you think your child 
may not know and go over them. This way the student will read smoothly and 
confidently without stumbling over unfamiliar words. 
</P>
<P>
To find out which words you can expect your child to know, ask his or her 
teacher for a copy of the Dolch List, which contains 220 words that are most 
vital for reading in primary grades. The list contains 76% of the words used in 
first-grade books, 69% of those in second-grade books and 62% of the words in 
third-grade books. 
</P>
<P>
The list of 300 "Instant Words," edited by Edward Fry, is also useful because 
it has about 65% of words read by children and adults. Amazingly, just the 
first 10 words on the list represent about a quarter of all printed English 
words. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure you have age-appropriate reading materials in the home. There are 
many magazines published just for children, but a favorite among Rotenberg's 
fifth- and sixth-graders is "Stone Soup." 
</P>
<P>
"It's all written by children, all the articles, stories and poetry, and the 
art as well," she said. "Highlight" and "Cricket," which carry stories and word 
puzzles for elementary school children, are also popular. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best resources for expanding your child's vocabulary is the 
newspaper. It offers a variety of topics that children like, such as comics, 
horoscopes, sports play-by-plays and album charts. "You can make a game out of 
the newspaper," Rotenberg said. "I have my students read the want ads and I ask 
them to find me a new car or a job." 
</P>
<P>
To help your student decipher words, keep a children's dictionary handy. 
Bookstores usually carry a variety of colorful and widely differing 
"beginner's" dictionaries, so choose the one your child seems most interested 
in. 
</P>
<P>
Computer software is a powerful tool for vocabulary-building, and there are 
dozens of inexpensive educational packages. Many adventure programs are also 
good linguistic workouts because they make the child learn to follow 
directions, recognize word clues, and detect double or hidden meanings. 
</P>
<P>
Kristin Cady, a fifth-grader at Grant Elementary School in Santa Monica, has 
learned more than a hundred words from the "Reading Rabbit" software program, 
which features word games. "It's fun and it makes me more interested in reading 
and learning words," Kristin said. "If you do things right, the little rabbit 
dances and it's really funny." 
</P>
<P>
"If you want kids to learn words, it has to be a game," said Kristin's father, 
Patrick Cady, a teacher at Santa Monica High. "Words have got to be seen as 
friends and tools, as well as academic." He suggested playing some simple word 
games with your child to make new words seem more friendly. 
</P>
<P>
Crossword puzzles are probably the most popular word game in America, and are 
very easy to find. Bookstores carry volumes and weekly magazines are full of 
them, and The Times provides one every day. Crosswords are great for learning 
synonyms and spelling. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, "Wheel of Fortune," minus Vanna's evening gowns and Pat's jokes, is 
actually a good exercise in vocabulary-building. Along with the contestants, 
your child can guess and spell the secret word or phrase. "Wheel" can help your 
kid practice spelling, separating vowels from consonants and classifying words. 
</P>
<P>
Educators and business leaders agree that vocabulary can affect your child's 
ability to get good grades, admission to college and the right job. Make sure 
your child develops a vocabulary that provides him or her with a competitive 
edge.

CARSON TO CLOSE POPULAR LATCHKEY PROGRAM NEXT WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kids Club, a popular latchkey program run by the Carson Parks and Recreation 
Department, is in violation of state licensing regulations and will be closed 
Monday, city officials have announced. 
</P>
<P>
Tiny Tots, a day-care program run by the city's community services division, is 
also in violation of licensing regulations, but the officials said they hope to 
keep it open. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Norris, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Social Services, 
said the programs, defined by the department as child-care centers, were 
operating without licenses. 
</P>
<P>
The Kids Club program provides before- and after-school supervision at each of 
the city's 12 parks, according to city officials. Tiny Tots is a preschool 
program for 3- to 5-year-old children that is conducted at the park activity 
centers and the city's Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
Norris said the social services department's analysts visited one of the parks 
on an unannounced inspection Nov. 6 after being tipped off by an anonymous 
caller. The city was issued a notice at that time that it had until today to 
file an application for a license. The program directors must also be 
certified, which requires an academic degree in child development or experience 
in a day-care center, or a combination of both. 
</P>
<P>
Scot Yotsuya, deputy city administrator, said the city decided to file an 
application to license the Tiny Tots program but not the Kids Club program. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it would be more difficult to obtain a license for Kids Club, based 
upon the requirements," Yotsuya said, adding that city officials believe the 
Kids Club service could be provided through Tiny Tots. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Jack Smith said about 200 children are involved in the Kids 
Club program. They are escorted from school to a neighboring park by a 
recreation employee and then take part in various park activities, such as 
crafts classes, organized sports and field trips. 
</P>
<P>
Fees for the service range from $15 to $29 a week for each child, depending on 
how long or often a youngster is supervised. 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Perry, a single parent whose two sons are in the latchkey program at 
Calas Park, Tuesday night urged the Carson City Council not to close the 
program. After a presentation to council members, Perry talked about how 
important the program was for her and her sons, Joseph, 9, and Donald, 12. The 
boys are at the park from 2:30 p.m. to 6 p.m., five days a week while Perry is 
at work. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want my boys to walk home and stay home for four hours alone," Perry 
said, "or hanging around the park for four hours without supervision." 
</P>
<P>
Eva Gatling, a spokeswoman for the city, said the parks would continue to offer 
after-school activities but that they would not be part of a formal latchkey 
program and that there might not be as much supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Vera Robles DeWitt said the closing of the Kids Club program was out of 
the city's control and stressed that it had nothing to do with current budget 
considerations.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN KILLED AT CSUN WAS A NON-STUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspected auto burglar who was fatally shot in a struggle with a campus 
police officer at Cal State Northridge was identified Wednesday as Jeffrey 
Dunn, 20, of Van Nuys, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn, who was not a student at the university, apparently was trying to break 
into a car parked in Lot K near Halsted Street and Lindley Avenue about 7 p.m. 
Tuesday when he was confronted by Sgt. Jay McTaggert, said Detective Michael 
Brandt. 
</P>
<P>
During a struggle with McTaggert, Dunn tried to grab the officer's .38-caliber 
revolver and the gun fired, Brandt said. Los Angeles County coroner's reports 
said the bullet went through Dunn's arm and entered his brain behind the left 
ear. He died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
McTaggert, 33, an 8-year veteran of the campus police force, suffered minor 
injuries in the struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt said detectives would continue to investigate the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Campus police said auto burglaries have increased at the university in recent 
months.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANNEXATION MEASURE WINS BY 50 VOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who says a few votes don't count? 
</P>
<P>
The day after this month's general election, Measure Q, a proposal to annex 
more than 1,000 acres and 5,000 residents of the Pinetree-Timberlane area into 
Santa Clarita, appeared to have passed by a slim 66-vote margin. 
</P>
<P>
That margin became even slimmer when the Los Angeles County Registrar of Voters 
reported Wednesday that Measure Q eked out a victory by only 50 votes, 1,170 to 
1,120. 
</P>
<P>
An election update released by the registrar a week after the election showed 
Measure Q's lead cut to 48 votes, 1,109 to 1,061. That count had buoyed the 
hopes of Bruce K. Bell, a Canyon Country resident who had spearheaded the 
campaign against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
But in another update released Nov. 15, the margin had increased to 52 votes. 
Bell was not encouraged and, at the time, said he doubted that Measure Q could 
be defeated. Between Nov. 15 and Wednesday, his forces gained seven more votes, 
but the pro-Measure Q camp received five more. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, citing the expense, said Wednesday that he would not ask for a recount.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LITTON CONFIRMS 10% CUT IN L.A. WORK FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Litton Industries Inc. confirmed Wednesday that it has cut about 600 jobs, or 
10% of its Los Angeles area work force, over the past year mainly by 
eliminating jobs at its Van Nuys and Woodland Hills facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Rocketdyne division of Rockwell International also confirmed 
that it has laid off 161 hourly workers at its Canoga Park plant since June, 
mainly because of spending cutbacks on the proposed space station and certain 
other space projects. 
</P>
<P>
But Rocketdyne said it also has hired 736 people this year for other programs 
where spending has been maintained or raised. The company employs 8,900 people 
in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
At Litton's Woodland Hills plant, which makes guidance and control systems for 
military aircraft and missiles, Litton has pared about 400 positions, in part 
by laying off 100 workers, spokesman Robert S. Knapp said. In Van Nuys, where 
Litton makes military electronic systems, the company has cut about 150 jobs, 
including 90 through layoffs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Litton, based in Beverly Hills, joined a long list of military contractors that 
have slashed employment in the face of slowing defense spending. The company 
now employs about 5,400 workers in the Los Angeles area, with no additional 
reductions planned, Knapp said.

The following are capsule reviews of some of the better restaurants recently 
visited by our critics: 
</P>
<P>
Ristorante Fabrizio, tucked away in the corner of a shopping center, can give 
you excellent food and dismal service. But when Fabrizio is around -- which is 
often -- you're likely to find the same excellent dishes, plus attentive 
service. Try the linguine Portofino or the sweetbreads Chez Maxim. 3731 
Thousand Oaks Blvd., Westlake Village, (805) 496-9033. Lunch Tuesday-Friday 
11:30 a.m.-2 p.m., dinner Tuesday-Thursday 6-9 p.m., Friday-Saturday 6-10 p.m., 
Sunday 5-9 p.m. Meal for two, food only, $25-$65. 
</P>
<P>
The rumor is that Giovanni's is the best Italian restaurant from Los Angeles to 
Camarillo. Giovanni's does an excellent job of living up to its reputation. The 
classic, formal restaurant offers a menu ranging from simple, grilled-to-order 
dinners to sophisticated, amazing dishes. There is the double-duty entree of 
opah fish wrapped in red leaf cabbage with red peppercorns and saffron, 
alongside a fine piece of cod covered with a lemony crab sauce. Lamb on greens 
is a superb salad, with sweet pine nuts, white beans, warm goat cheese and a 
perfect vinaigrette. 5227 Mission Oaks Blvd., Camarillo, (805) 484-4376. Lunch 
is served Tuesday-Friday 11 a.m.-2:30 p.m. Dinner is served Tuesday-Sunday 5-10 
p.m. Dinner for two, food only, $40-$75. 
</P>
<P>
Middle America and its hearty food are alive and well at Doc'n Sandy's Cafe on 
the edge of Saticoy. Doc's is an outstanding value, but be hungry. This is not 
light fare. A hearty hot beef, open-faced sandwich leads the list, followed by 
the beautifully flavored chicken-fried steak and the California omelet stuffed 
with chili beans, onions, green peppers, salsa and cheese. 11033 Citrus Drive, 
Saticoy, (805) 647-2619. Open for breakfast and lunch Monday-Friday 7 a.m.-1:45 
p.m. Meal for two, $14-$20. 
</P>
<P>
Looking like a small French eatery plunked down in a Western frontier town, the 
Kitchen Cafe has a cross-cultural, cross-historical charm. It's only open for 
continental breakfast and lunch, and the menu is petite. But it delivers to 
downtown Ventura and the food is first-rate. Try the daily quiche, with its 
outstanding crust, or the generous marinated tri-trip sandwich on a sesame seed 
bun. Salads are appealing too. 34 N. Palm St., Ventura, (805) 641-9926. Lunch 
is served Monday-Saturday 9 a.m.-4 p.m. Lunch for one, $6 to $10.

<P>
HALF-DEAD DUO; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN ROB WASSERMAN TEAMS UP WITH BOB WEIR, IT'S ABOUT THE CLOSEST THING TO A 
LOVE-IN YOU CAN FIND IN THESE PARTS.

Rob and Bob are coming back to the Ventura Theatre. Rob is the bass player. Bob 
plays guitar. Rob has a Grammy. Bob does not, but he probably has more fans -- 
not bad for a Dead guy. Rob and Bob are neighbors despite the fact that Bob has 
been Dead for 24 years. Rob is Rob Wasserman. Bob is Bob Weir of the Grateful 
Dead. The duo will perform on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
To many Deadheads, the "Dead On The Beach" shows -- performed at the Ventura 
Raceway during the '80s -- were some of the best. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Ventura felt otherwise, convincing the Fair Board to gong any 
further Dead shows in Ventura. Apparently, Deadheads are not the type of 
tourists the city is looking for. 
</P>
<P>
Since the last Grateful Dead show in Ventura three years ago, the band has been 
finding fewer and fewer places allowing them to play. Amazingly, two longtime 
Northern California venues -- UC Berkeley and Stanford -- have also recently 
killed any future Dead shows. Maybe the band will be relegated to playing in 
Jerry Garcia's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
With this recent dearth of the Dead, an appearance by Weir is about as close as 
it gets to the real thing for local Deadheads, who will doubtless be there in 
force dancing until they are dizzy. 
</P>
<P>
Weir's publicist, as a precondition to an interview, insisted that no Grateful 
Dead questions be asked of Weir because he had just returned from a lengthy 
tour of Europe and was tired of all this Dead stuff, and if he had to answer 
one more Dead question, then, well, he'd rather be Dead. Here's the latest on 
Rob and Bob according to Bob himself: 
</P>
<P>
Rob and Bob the tour -- how goes it? 
</P>
<P>
We're only doing three Southern California shows -- San Juan Capistrano, 
Pasadena and Ventura. I'm gone on the road about six months a year, so Rob and 
I don't get to play often enough. When we do play, it's just the two of us with 
no opening act. 
</P>
<P>
Rob and Bob the record -- is there one? 
</P>
<P>
There isn't a record yet, but there undoubtedly will be one when we get around 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
Rob and Bob the duo -- how did it start? 
</P>
<P>
We've been neighbors for 15 years, but we never met until two years ago. There 
was a benefit for the Mill Valley Film Festival; they called me up and asked me 
to help out. There was a night of music called Rob Wasserman and Friends. We 
rehearsed for about 25 minutes, and it was just too much fun to walk away. 
We've toured two or three times since. The last time we played Ventura, we had 
a ball. 
</P>
<P>
Describe Rob and Bob music. 
</P>
<P>
It's pretty difficult to describe. Ron plays an acoustic bass or an electric 
upright bass; I play the guitar and do the vocals. We do mostly material from 
my various projects, even a couple of Dead songs. But this is not like a 
Grateful Dead concert -- I try to keep the material separate because this 
project is sort of a vacation for me. 
</P>
<P>
Who goes to see Rob and Bob? 
</P>
<P>
Basically, Rob has a number of his own fans, plus there's plenty of Deadheads. 
</P>
<P>
Have you two arrived as a bona fide musical act; I mean, do you have Rob and 
Bob T-shirts? 
</P>
<P>
Yup, we have T-shirts and all that kind of stuff. People are out there taping 
just like at a Dead show. 
</P>
<P>
How did you get started in the music biz? 
</P>
<P>
Basically, I had very little choice except to play music. When I was younger I 
got into Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and especially, the Everly Brothers. Then 
I got into folk like Joan Baez and the Kingston Trio, then later, more esoteric 
folk rock, then country blues, the Beatles and the Stones and modern jazz. I 
was in a number of bands before I joined the Dead in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
What's the best and worst thing about being a rock god? 
</P>
<P>
The best thing is getting to play. I love to play. The worst thing is the 
boredom and tedium associated with travel. 
</P>
<P>
What do you do for fun? 
</P>
<P>
Basically, I'm into all kinds of sports. 
</P>
<P>
How 'bout those Niners? I think the Niners have a fair chance to establish 
themselves as one of the greatest football teams of all time if they can win 
the Super Bowl again. 
</P>
<P>
What was your strangest gig? 
</P>
<P>
Probably when Rob and I toured the Hawaiian Islands. We have a lot of fans over 
there. 
</P>
<P>
What's in the future for Rob and Bob? 
</P>
<P>
Well, we'd like to make a record; do some international touring. The whole 
point is to get to places I've never been. 
</P>
<P>
No one can accuse Ojai Bowlful of Blues promoter Michael Kaufer of having no 
sense of adventure. On Dec. 3, at Alexander's in Ventura, Blue Monday becomes 
Red Monday when those loco locals with the reputation as big as all outdoors, 
Raging Arb &amp; The Redheads, headline. It's going to be some serious rocking 
blues, so strap on that steel pot and put on those dancing shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Ever wonder why you haven't seen The I-Rails lately? Some sneaky lowdown 
varmint busted into Chris O'Connor's pad in Hueneme and hogged his bass guitar. 
It's almost Christmas, so if you have an extra bass lying around just taking up 
valuable space. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ever wonder why you haven't seen Durango 95 lately? There are three basic 
reasons why rock bands don't perform: 1. Everybody hates them 2. They're having 
"creative differences" 3. They're looking for a bass player. Reason No. 3 is 
keeping Durango 95 off the stage until after the first of the year, according 
to front man and main brain Frank Barajas. These purveyors of pure power pop 
have been around so long they used to be somebody else, The Strangers. 
</P>
<P>
New tapes/CDs/albums or whatever are on the way from The I-Rails, Something For 
Nothing and Michael On Fire.

<P>
THURSDAY 
</P>
<P>
* Mojo Hand (Hungry Hunter, 487 N. Moorpark Road, Thousand Oaks, 497-3925) 
Industrial strength blues comes to the east county. Also Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
FRIDAY 
</P>
<P>
* "Beatlemania" (Ventura Theatre, 26 S. Chestnut St., 648-1888) This is a copy 
of something original. But it is probably about as good as it gets since the 
remaining three Beatles seem in no danger of reuniting. 
</P>
<P>
SATURDAY 
</P>
<P>
* John Mayall &amp; The Bluesbreakers, Mama Roo (Ventura Theatre) Back in the 
mid-'60s, it seemed every British band was some sort of blues band -- Mayall 
still has the blues. Mama Roo is this week's disco queen, making for a really 
weird double bill. 
</P>
<P>
SUNDAY 
</P>
<P>
* Jawge &amp; The Unknown Band (Eric Ericcson's, Seaward Avenue and the blue 
Pacific, Ventura, 643-4783) Reggae on the beach makes for the happening Sunday 
party. 
</P>
<P>
MONDAY 
</P>
<P>
* Matt Schulte and Bill Coffey (Charlie's, 362 California St., Ventura, 
648-6688) These two folk singers, who use absolutely no electricity, do the 
Everly Brothers thing for Happy Hour, and also a bunch of memorable originals. 
</P>
<P>
* Dan Pollock Band (Alexander's, 1050 Schooner Drive, Ventura, 658-2000) This 
week's Blue Monday presentation and also the antidote for the Bills and the 
Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
TUESDAY 
</P>
<P>
* The Beautiful (Carnaval Club, 634 State St., Santa Barbara, 965-8422) This 
week's new and improved, happening, under-appreciated guitar band that you've 
never heard of. 
</P>
<P>
* Joseppi's Wedding Band, Joseppi's (434 State St., Santa Barbara, 962-5516) 
There's at least eight people in the band; the tiny bar is packed with party 
animals. The band takes requests, and they know just about everything. It's a 
serious party, and Santa Barbara's Tuesday night best. 
</P>
<P>
WEDNESDAY 
</P>
<P>
* Rob Wasserman and Bob Weir (Ventura Theatre) Wasserman is the bass player 
with a Grammy and Weir is the guitarist from the Grateful Dead. What a long 
strange trip it still is . . . BILL LOCEY

FASHION; 
</P>
<P>
SEASONAL LOOK?; 
</P>
<P>
THE CALENDAR INSIDE MAY READ NOVEMBER, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE CROWDS OUTSIDE 
ARE SPORTING FALL ATTIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There are places in this nation, I'm told, where people actually wear clothes 
according to seasonal cues. Tank tops and shorts are donned in the warm days of 
summer; sweaters are pulled out when the brown leaves of fall begin scraping 
along the sidewalk; pastels are brought out of drawers to welcome in the 
blossoms of spring. 
</P>
<P>
But in Ventura County, things are a bit different. Mother Nature gives us very 
little fashion advice. The calendar on the wall often hangs in defiance of the 
weather outside. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, we have had a few of those fall-ish, 60-degree days when local TV 
weathermen are probably under contract to wonder aloud how much longer the 
"cold spell" will last. But tell me this: How many among you have gotten up and 
happily thrown on that new sweater or wool jacket you just bought -- only to be 
roasting like a chicken on a spit by noon? 
</P>
<P>
All of which leads me to this pressing question of the day: Do Ventura County 
merchants and shoppers buy fashions that magazines say should be worn in fall, 
or do we have a seasonal style of our own? 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Romer, who works as a makeup artist in Thousand Oaks, echoed the 
sentiments of many. She said she's ruled more by practicality. "If I liked a 
certain print I'd buy it, but certainly not just to have a fall look," said 
Romer, dressed on a recent afternoon in a tank top and loosely crocheted blouse 
and cotton skirt. "You just don't get a chance to wear it enough to make it 
worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Cherry, who moved to Ventura County last month from Washington, said she 
believes there is an "anything goes" attitude toward fashion. "Out here you can 
get away with a lot more. You'd freeze in Washington if you wore shorts in 
November," Cherry said. "People seem to wear what makes sense because of the 
weather, instead of what the fashion magazines say is in style." 
</P>
<P>
It appears that department stores have come to the same conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we had sweaters left over for months because it was 80 degrees out, 
" said Sue Teal, a sales associate at the May Co. in Oxnard. "So now we don't 
have so many. We have a lot more year-round fashions. We just got in a lot of 
print dresses in both long and short sleeves." 
</P>
<P>
Several salespeople at other stores said sweaters and coats sell briskly in 
November and December, but shoppers frequently inquire whether they are 
returnable. The warmer garbs, they say, are often for gifts. 
</P>
<P>
What about fall colors? If you buy your fall clothes in Ventura County, you may 
need to change your vocabulary a bit. "In fall, white becomes winter white, 
yellow is mustard, green turns to khaki and pink is fuchsia," said Doris 
Lofton, a sales manager at the May Co. 
</P>
<P>
The county also bulges with pastels in a typically earth-tone season. "Pastels 
are fashionable for the resort season," said Duke Hagenburger, associate 
manager of Club Monaco, a Canadian-owned clothing store in the Thousand Oaks 
mall. Resort wear, he said, began on the East Coast as spring clothing that 
people bought in winter "to take with them when they go on a cruise or to 
escape to a warmer climate." 
</P>
<P>
I resolved not to ask Hagenburger what Ventura County residents buy when we 
want to escape. I was afraid he would tell me down parkas. 
</P>
<P>
But there also is the issue of shoes. As I suspected, several salespeople said 
Ventura County residents are still buying footwear that won't be fashionable in 
most places until spring or summer. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of white shoes -- tucked away elsewhere around the country right after 
Labor Day -- have barely slowed, shoe store owners say. Ditto for sandals. 
"They buy them whether it's cloudy or not," said Oscar Ruvalcaba, who works at 
Thom McAn's shoes in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't there anything we buy that gives us a shred of conformity? Is there 
nothing we purchase that is strictly seasonal? 
</P>
<P>
"Boots," said Susana Reyes, who sells shoes at the May Co. "They buy them even 
when it's not at all cold. I think it's the one thing people wear that makes 
them really think it's fall." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PREMISE 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County is teeming with the fashionable and not so fashionable. There 
are trend-makers and trend-breakers. There are those with style -- personal and 
off the rack -- and those making fashion statements better left unsaid. Twice a 
month, we'll be taking a look at fashion in Ventura County -- trends, styles 
and ideas -- and asking you what you think. If you have a fashion problem, 
sighting or suggestion or if you know a fashion success or a fashion victim, 
let us know. We want to hear from you.

Thanksgiving. A time for family matters. I had in mind sharing a family secret. 
Not about dinners, though -- my penchant for "less is more" would be out of 
place on this day. 
</P>
<P>
My secret is a first-aid item used by everyone in our family. It's something 
with a lot of medicinal uses that is made from a natural material and doesn't 
sting, stink or stain. 
</P>
<P>
I'm talking about tea tree oil. But it's evidently not much of a secret lately 
because in researching the background of this natural antiseptic I found that 
Thrifty, Sav-On, Longs, etc. now sell an array of products that contain it. And 
the health food stores where my wife's been buying 100% pure tea tree oil for 
years have experienced a surge in sales lately. 
</P>
<P>
Tea tree oil. What an odd name. A botanist, Joseph Banks, named it when he 
reported on Pacific Coast health matters during the famous voyages of Capt. 
Cook. The coast in question was on the other side of the Pacific basin, 
Australia. The original inhabitants, he noted, brewed medicinal teas and 
steamed out medicinal oils from the leaves of certain tea trees. 
</P>
<P>
And they still do. The European settlers picked up on practices down under as 
we took up certain Indian herbalists' practices hereabouts. In Australia, 
eucalyptus leaves became the most popular source of medicinal oil. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody there has used them for 150 years," Brenda Bonner, a Pacoima natural 
oils broker, said. "But Americans don't like the smell. We've taken a fancy to 
one particular 'tea tree,"' Melaleuca, Bonner said. "And a two-ounce bottle 
lasts two years." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed it does. Purchased in generic form, 100% pure (Aussie) government 
inspected, it's something our family uses instead of everything -- instead of 
iodine, isopropyl alcohol, sunburn oil or commercial zit fighters. Tea tree oil 
has also become an important ingredient in a wide range of American-made health 
care products as manufacturers, especially in California, move away from 
petroleum-based (and sometimes irritating) chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Because it's a natural germicide, fungicide and mild analgesic, tea tree oil is 
useful in lip balm, mouthwash, toothpaste, soap and deodorants. It's also 
widely available in a medicinal (anti-dandruff) shampoo made by Freeman 
Cosmetics here in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
But call around to find a store that carries it in its 100% pure generic form. 
Buy one for the medicine cabinet and one for mommy's purse. The quaint 
directions on one of our bottles read: "Dab on to cuts, insect bites, minor 
burns, pimples. Sprinkle on handkerchief or add drops to hot water and inhale 
for nasal congestion. Use sparingly." This time of year, with the cold season 
upon us, we also use it for chapped noses and lips. 
</P>
<P>
This might sound like some New England auntie lecturing the young during a lull 
in the dinner table conversation. Well, I'll accept the role for now. From an 
environmental standpoint I'm also comfortable because the manufacturing process 
involved is nature friendly. The tea tree leaves are trimmed, not unlike what 
we do with rosebushes for their benefit. And, unlike petroleum, this is a 
renewable resource. 
</P>
<P>
The leaves are steamed in a process rather like what we do with vegetables for 
dinner. Except it's the steam that's collected, in something like an 
old-fashioned bootlegger's still. When the water condenses, the oil is skimmed 
off the top. 
</P>
<P>
The folks who bring tea leaf oil to America retest it for purity to see if the 
Australian government labeling is accurate. Desert Essence, a manufacturer in 
Topanga, has noted no discrepancies. Then, in determining various applications 
-- for instance, for sunburn or pimples -- they test it on themselves, not 
animals. (This takes cruelty-free manufacturing principles to the max.) 
</P>
<P>
So now you know about our little family secret. Gatherings at Thanksgiving can 
produce the odd cut, scrape, sting or singe. Having a few ounces of tea tree 
oil on hand during this and other holidays should take care of things. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
* WHAT AND WHERE 
</P>
<P>
Generic tea tree oil can be found in health food stores, including the 
following in Ventura County: 
</P>
<P>
* Kayser's Nutrition Centers, Buenaventura Plaza in Ventura, 642-2145, and La 
Cumbre Plaza in Santa Barbara, 682-3747. 
</P>
<P>
* Lassen's Health Foods, 4013 E. Main St., Ventura, 644-6990, 3471 Saviers 
Road, Oxnard, 486-8266 and 2207 Pickwick Drive, Camarillo, 492-3287.

Ever look through the Sunday Calendar section of The Times and you don't know 
who any of those bands are? Don't know Electric Peace from the Electric Angels 
from the Electric Boys from Pacific Gas &amp; Electric? Can't tell the 
difference between Sting and W.A.S.P. or Big Daddy Kane and the Gear Daddies? 
Are you confused by the Mudheads, Mud Honey and the Chickasaw Mud Puppies? 
Perhaps rock 'n' roll has passed you by? I hear the record store is selling 
"The Sound of Music" really cheap. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, The Beautiful (they're not really) is one of those Happening New Bands 
No One Has Ever Heard Of. It will be playing the Carnaval Club in Santa Barbara 
on Tuesday night. The trio, based in New York, is on a cross-country tour in a 
thinly veiled effort to promote sales of its latest and only release, a 
self-titled five-song EP on Giant Records, a Warner Bros. affiliate. One song, 
"Highway," is a video on MTV. 
</P>
<P>
Beautiful music is sort of murky guitar rock, maybe like Jane's Addiction meets 
Metallica. They definitely don't sound like U2 or R.E.M. or the Stone Roses. 
And they make a lot of noise for just three guys, the basic power trio. The 
Beautiful is Jonathon Lacey on guitar and vocals, Frank Ferrer on drums and 
Perry Bottke on bass. In a phone interview from a hotel in St. Louis, Lacey 
described the life and times of The Beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
How's the tour going? 
</P>
<P>
Oh man, it's the Totally Destructo Tour From Hell, the Tour of Death. We're 
just happy to be playing. We're having lots of fun. 
</P>
<P>
We're living out of bags and a U-Haul. So we're going to do this club tour 
until Christmas, take January off, play February and March, then do a full 
album in April and May. So now we're in St. Louis and I can see this giant arch 
thing from my window. It's like the McDonald's from hell where they make 
nuclear burgers as big as cars. 
</P>
<P>
How's the record doing? 
</P>
<P>
It's doing OK, but our label, Giant, is really new, so it's sort of like being 
with an independent label -- and Warner Bros. doesn't care about us yet. Right 
now, it sort of seems the record company is doing "the let's wait until the 
full album comes out thing. Retailers seem to play our songs in their stores 
all the time, but the damn thing costs $10.99! Can you imagine that? $10.99 for 
five songs? 
</P>
<P>
How did The Beautiful come about? 
</P>
<P>
We all got started for different reasons. The drummer, Frank, is this total Led 
Zeppelin, John Bonham freak -- that's what he's all about. He used to play in 
salsa bands, all sorts of stuff. Perry is from the Midwest and totally into 
AC/DC, Ted Nugent and stuff like that. I was into the Texas punk scene and 
liked bands like X, Generation X, and Stiff Little Fingers. We're three totally 
different people. It's like most bands put an ad somewhere and end up with the 
same guy five times, if you know what I mean. I guess we just got together by 
default. 
</P>
<P>
Describe Beautiful music. 
</P>
<P>
It's a logical extension of what rock 'n' roll should be. 
</P>
<P>
But is it beautiful? 
</P>
<P>
It is very beautiful. It's just real rock 'n' roll. We don't spend time 
wondering, "Is this going to work?" We just do it. 
</P>
<P>
What's the best thing about being a rock god? 
</P>
<P>
We don't have to be home. 
</P>
<P>
What's the worst thing about being a rock god? 
</P>
<P>
We don't get to be at home. 
</P>
<P>
What's the New York music scene like? 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's weird. For a while, everyone was into that glam junk. Then a couple 
of other bands like us came along that were totally original. People are 
gradually becoming more accepting of new music. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a basic Beautiful fan? 
</P>
<P>
That's the really weird thing. We get the little heavy-metal chicks who say, 
"You guys are great, wanna get naked?" Then we get the little weirdos in black 
who say, "I just killed my mother, but you guys are great." Then we get these 
old dudes that say, "You guys are great, it was just like seeing Hendrix or the 
Who for the first time. I guess people like us because we don't have an 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Your EP only has five songs. Do you guys just do five real long songs, or is 
there more Beautiful music than that? 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, we do five songs for 2 1/2 hours. No really, we have a whole album worth 
of songs, all ours, no covers. 
</P>
<P>
What does The Beautiful want? 
</P>
<P>
We just want to have the time to do everything, and do it right. We just want 
to keep getting better as a band. 
</P>
<P>
Why should people come to see The Beautiful? 
</P>
<P>
Because you can't see us again. If you miss us, you're gonna have to wait 
another year. 
</P>
<P>
How 'bout those Giants? 
</P>
<P>
How 'bout 'em?

AN ENERGETIC BOOK ABOUT WRITING BESTSELLERS HAS BEEN COMPILED FROM LECTURES AT 
A PRESTIGIOUS SANTA BARBARA CONFERENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN VAN DER VEER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every June, 350 writers from around the world converge on the Miramar Hotel in 
Montecito for the weeklong Santa Barbara Writers' Conference. It's a hectic 
seven days of classes and lectures that last nearly around the clock, if you 
count the "pirate workshops" that go on into the wee hours. Hundreds more local 
writers pack the conference hall every afternoon and evening to hear the 
keynote lectures by agents, publishers and an illustrious list of guest 
speakers who have included many famous writers. 
</P>
<P>
Now in its 19th year and touted as one of the more prestigious events of its 
kind, the conference has generated "The Complete Guide to Writing Fiction, by 
Barnaby Conrad and the staff of the Santa Barbara Writers' Conference." 
</P>
<P>
Conrad, the founder, guru and director of the conference, is a longtime 
resident of Rincon Beach who has written 22 books, including the bestseller 
"Matador." 
</P>
<P>
The best of the new guide contains selections from past conference keynote 
speakers such as James Michener, on "How to Become a Writer"; Eudora Welty, on 
"Characters"; Ray Bradbury, on "Getting an Agent"; William F. Buckley Jr. on 
"Style and Language"; Jessamyn West on "Criticism"; and Colleen McCullough on 
"Rejection." 
</P>
<P>
For those who want tips on how to write a bestseller, advice is offered by 
Irving Stone in "Publicizing Fiction"; Jackie Collins in "The Obligatory Sex 
Scene"; and Sidney Sheldon in "Action and Narrative." 
</P>
<P>
The book includes 20 other excerpts from lectures at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
And there is advice from many of the conference's perennial workshop leaders, 
including local writers Bill Downey, on writer's block; Ted Berkman, on style; 
and Frances Halpern, on marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether more than a hundred writers are quoted, including some literary 
greats from previous centuries. This is a lot to pack into a 304-page book, but 
an attempt has been made to accommodate extremes of taste. 
</P>
<P>
Those who really don't want to be taught to write by Jackie Collins and Judith 
Krantz can find literary advice from Jorge Luis Borges, Tolstoy, Chekhov and 
Flaubert. However, the bulk of the book is weighted toward the nuts and bolts 
of "bestseller" fiction. 
</P>
<P>
There are chapters on the publishing business, marketing without an agent, and 
the importance of knowing how to publicize your work. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad introduces each chapter in the same charming, witty style he utilizes 
when introducing speakers every year at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
What sets this book apart from some other guides to fiction writing is the same 
kind of energy found at the conference. You might find that you want to put the 
book down and write some fiction instead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHAT AND WHERE 
</P>
<P>
"The Complete Guide to Writing Fiction, by Barnaby Conrad and the Staff of the 
Santa Barbara Writers' Conference." Published by Writer's Digest Books, 
Cincinnati, Ohio. 304 pages, $17.95. Available at local bookstores.

'FOREVER TANGO' FEATURES SOME OF ARGENTINA'S MOST RENOWNED DANCERS, MUSICIANS 
AND SINGERS.

This is the week of stuffing and being stuffed. But Argentine tango dancers are 
coming to Santa Barbara next week. And just watching these people whirl and 
twirl can probably burn off a couple pieces of pumpkin pie. 
</P>
<P>
"Forever Tango," featuring some of Argentina's most renowned dancers, musicians 
and singers, will be presented at the Arlington Theater on Dec. 1 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
"The show is a review of the dance and music of tango, its beginnings and its 
many transformations," said Luis Bravo, creator and artistic director of 
"Forever Tango." Bravo, who toured as a cellist with the "Forever Argentino" 
dance show two years ago, said the show inspired him to create his own 
production. Many of the dancers in "Forever Tango" were also part of the 
"Forever Argentino" world tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to live in the United States, and I've always dreamed about doing a 
show like this so that Americans can see what beautiful things come from 
Argentina," said Bravo, who was born in Anatuya, Argentina, and now lives in 
Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
The dance itself was born in the 1880s in Buenos Aires, a city of immigrants 
from Europe and the Argentine countryside. The origins of the music are not 
clear, but it seems that it rose out of the popular ballads of the countryside 
and from the beat of African slaves' drums. 
</P>
<P>
The tango gets its name from the Latin word tangere, meaning "to touch," and 
was popularized in brothels at the turn of the century. By the 1930s, the dance 
had overtaken the high-class salons and ballrooms as refined men and women 
adapted it to their own style. 
</P>
<P>
A bit of that moneyed era will be represented in the "Forever Tango" 
production, with the costumes worth nearly $100,000. The men will wear gray and 
basic black tuxedos, while the women dance in satin, sequins and lace -- all 
while wearing five-inch heels. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the 8 p.m. show are $26, $24 and $20. Call 963-4408. 
</P>
<P>
The songs and life of an American folk singer are re-created in the Missouri 
Repertory Theatre's production of "Woody Guthrie's American Song" at UC Santa 
Barbara's Campbell Hall at 8 p.m. Tuesday. Tickets are $16, $14 and $12. Call 
893-3535. 
</P>
<P>
Guthrie's songs -- such as "Union Maid" and "This Land Is Your Land" -- reflect 
what he experienced and thought while traveling through the country during the 
'30s and '40s. In the production, no one actor portrays Guthrie. Instead, all 
the characters -- from drifters in a boxcar to residents of a hobo jungle and a 
family of Okies -- present the balladeer's ideas and songs. 
</P>
<P>
The work of four contemporary artists -- Gregory Amenoff, Brenda Goodman, Mary 
Hambleton and Michael Kessler -- will be exhibited in "Inner Natures" at the 
Santa Barbara Museum of Art today through Feb. 10. Admission $3, free each 
Thursday and the first Sunday of each month. Call 963-4364. 
</P>
<P>
The "William Bourne Memorial Recital" will be performed by Soviet pianist 
Sergei Babajan at Abravanel Hall, Music Academy of the West, at 8 p.m. Tuesday. 
Free. Call 969-3340. 
</P>
<P>
A play for children, "Little Red Riding Hood: A Wolf's Tale," will be presented 
at 10 a.m. today, Friday and Saturday at the Alhecama Theatre. Tickets are $5 
adults and $3 children. Call 962-8606. 
</P>
<P>
And a play for adults, "The Mousetrap" by Agatha Christie, will be performed 
Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. at Carpinteria's Seaside 
Theatre. Tickets are $6 and $5. Call 684-6380. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve art galleries in Los Olivos, north of Santa Barbara, will hold a show 
all day Saturday featuring receptions for artists from throughout the country. 
Free. Call 688-5083.

BELMONT BEATS BELL, 24-6, FOR 6TH IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Belmont High won its sixth consecutive game Wednesday night with a 24-6 victory 
over Bell in a 3-A Division first-round playoff contest at Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
The Sentinels, The Times' seventh-ranked team, improved their record to 9-1. 
</P>
<P>
Ninth-ranked Bell, which entered the game with a five-game winning streak, 
ended the season at 6-3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Belmont opened a 17-0 halftime lead. The workhorse was senior running back Tajh 
Evans, who gained 153 yards in 16 carries and scored on a 72-yard touchdown in 
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts 13, Wilson 7 -- The Toilers recovered a fumble by Mule quarterback 
Zannoni Morales on his two-yard line and took a 7-0 lead in the second quarter, 
then held on to upset 10th-ranked Wilson in a 3-A game at Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts is 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
Garfield 26, Eagle Rock 17 -- Oscar Gonzalez gained 206 yards and scored two 
touchdowns in the first quarter to lead the Bulldogs to a 3-A victory at 
Garfield. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez opened the scoring with a 10-yard run and then returned a punt 68 
yards for a touchdown to give Garfield (9-1) a 14-0 first-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle Rock finished at 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar 38, South Gate 6 -- Tobaise Brookins rushed for 211 yards and scored 
three touchdowns to lead the Spartans (10-0) to a 3-A victory at Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar led, 38-0, but lost the shutout when Gilbert Gonzalez scored on a 
two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax 35, Washington 34 -- Quarterback Rahim Muhammad led the Lion offense 
with 232 yards in 15 carries and three touchdowns, including a 69-yard run on 
the second play from scrimmage. He also intercepted a desperation pass with no 
time left to seal the 3-A victory at Venice High. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-ranked Fairfax (10-0) led, 28-14, at halftime and never trailed. Running 
back Mario Mattison added 142 yards in 24 carries and two touchdowns.

DETECTIVE SAYS WORTHY CONTACTED PORTLAND ESCORT SERVICE LAST SEASON

<P>
James Worthy contacted an escort service on a Laker trip to Portland last 
season, a Portland detective said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Det. David Simpson said Worthy called Allstar Models and Escorts last Feb. 6, 
requesting an escort. 
</P>
<P>
The escort service was under investigation at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said that the caller left a phone number, corresponding to that of the 
Marriott Hotel where the team was staying, and a room number corresponding to 
the one in which Worthy was registered. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said no action was taken against Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't any reason to," Simpson said from Portland. "We had our case made 
already." 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Walton, proprietress of the company, has been found guilty on six 
counts of promoting prostitution, a felony in Oregon. She has not yet been 
sentenced. Her sister, Marla, an employee, pleaded guilty to one count and was 
put on probation. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy was arrested last week in Houston on a charge of soliciting prostitution 
from an escort company. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment in Houston 
Tuesday. MARK HEISLER

NO TEAM DESERVES TO BE CROWNED MYTHICAL NATIONAL CHAMPION

<P>
Reading Time: Two Minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The longer the college football season goes -- there are instances of it 
stretching to nearly 20 weeks for some teams -- the more apparent it becomes 
there should be no mythical champion this year. 
</P>
<P>
Altitude sickness? Jim Palmer's already in the Hall of Fame, so what's all this 
light-headed foolishness coming out of Denver about him sneaking back on the 
field at age 45? Many's the time his manager and teammates complained that 
Jimbo didn't take the mound when he appeared to be fit. Some have suggested 
Jim's been wearing Jockey shots marked S. 
</P>
<P>
What ninny came up with the Kodak All-America team, naming Notre Damers Chris 
Zorich, Todd Lyght and Mike Stonebreaker? The trio plays defense, which has 
been an anathema to the Irish all season. Besides, all have gotten by on 
reputation this year, having had bad years or been injured most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
The sports books in Las Vegas certainly don't waste any time when it comes to 
setting horse racing lines. Hot off the presses are the early odds for the 1991 
Breeders' Cup next October. Unbridled and Summer Squall have drawn the 
co-favorites role for the featured Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts: For the second year in a row, not one living (or reasonable 
facsimile thereof) baseball writer correctly named all hands on the 10-man 
Topps Major League Rookie All-Star Team. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps in an attempt to get fans' minds off the team, come Saturday night at 
the Capital Centre when the Washington Bullets take on the Indiana Pacers, 
numerous pro team mascots will be on hand to celebrate team mascot Hoops' 
birthday. Invited guests include the Oriole Bird, Hugo the (Charlotte) Hornet, 
Stuff the (Orlando) Magic Dragon, Big Shot (76ers), Spuds McKenzie, et al. 
What, no Denny the Detonator from the Blast? 
</P>
<P>
For you folks who never had the pleasure of watching Johnny Rodgers (circa 
1972) frolic on the gridiron, be advised Rocket Ismail is his mirror image and 
will probably join the Nebraska star as a Heisman Trophy recipient. 
</P>
<P>
There can be little doubt that the Poulan Weed Eater Independence Bowl will be 
much the worse off not extending an invitation to the Maryland Terrapins and 
the legion of fans that would have followed them to Shreveport, La. 
</P>
<P>
Business opportunities: Sure, times are tough, but the Rose, All American, 
Freedom, Hall of Fame, Liberty and Peach bowls are still without a title 
sponsor and it just doesn't seem right. 
</P>
<P>
No sooner does Monica Seles get done co-headlining the First National Bank 
Tennis with Jennifer Capriati in Baltimore next Tuesday at the Arena when she's 
off to Argentina for an exhibition series against Gabriela Sabatini, whom she 
beat for the Virginia Slims title in five grueling sets the other day. 
</P>
<P>
It's just a guess, but one suspects the reason a site hasn't been selected for 
the Sugar Ray Leonard-Terry Norris bout from among Las Vegas, Atlantic City and 
New York is each probably hopes one of the others gets it. 
</P>
<P>
The pump-em-up-as-quick-as-you-can style of the Denver Nuggets actually works 
against Paul Westhead's 1-9 juggernaut. The opposition is subjected to the 
48-minute sprint just every so often, not 82 times like the Nuggets will be. 
Teams are consistently shooting 60 percent against Denver because they're 
treated to so many layups. 
</P>
<P>
How tough is it to win on the road in the NBA? Through the first three weeks of 
the campaign it has been Napoleonic, just four of the 27 teams having a winning 
mark on the suitcase circuit. It's no picnic in the NHL either, just five of 21 
teams having their noses above water. 
</P>
<P>
There should be some sort of award for Houston Coach John Jenkins for 
mercifully pulling quarterback David Klingler midway through the fourth quarter 
and not allowing him to pad his 41-for-58 and 11 touchdown passes performance 
against an always dangerous and fast-closing Eastern Washington powerhouse. The 
final was 84-21. Recall, the Cougars stacked up 95 points in a game last year.

O.C. POP BEAT: SUCCESS SPOILED SOVIET ROCK, MUSICIAN SAYS 
</P>

A theme common to American music bio films from "St. Louis Blues" to "Jailhouse 
Rock" is that of an artist struggling through adversity to develop his craft, 
only to lose his soul when, at last, success strikes. And that, according to 
Soviet rock musician Vasily Shumov, is pretty much the scenario of what has 
occurred with the entire Soviet rock music scene in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Shumov spoke Tuesday evening in a UC Irvine Arts and Lectures event at the 
university's Student Center. In heavily accented English, the 30-year-old 
Muscovite musician related his experiences as a pre- and post-glasnost rocker. 
</P>
<P>
Where playing rock music was once branded as fascist, and bands could only be 
heard by exchanging homemade underground tapes, Shumov and his rocking 
contemporaries are now stars, with official record releases, concerts and radio 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
He said it has all but ruined the music. 
</P>
<P>
"It has all changed. All this atmosphere of rock music, all the ideas, 
messages, the people listening and finding something in the songs more than all 
this music for dancing. There was something more, something spiritual. Now in 
the last two years, that's completely gone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Westerners, Shumov said he was first hit by the sounds of the Beatles, the 
Stones, the Kinks and other '60s-rock giants. But where the ensuing media 
explosion helped promote those groups in the West, listening to rock was a 
clandestine activity in the Soviet Union. The music was regarded as decadent, 
and none was released in the country. Instead, a trickle of records were 
smuggled in, sometimes brought by African and Middle-Eastern exchange students. 
Songs would be disseminated not by radio, but by fans exchanging the records or 
tapes. 
</P>
<P>
"The music would go from one person to another directly, like a virus," Shumov 
said. He isn't the only one to draw such comparisons: As recently as four years 
ago, some Soviet officials were likening the spread of rock in the Soviet Union 
to AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Anything related to rock was a precious commodity. As a youth, Shumov covered 
the walls of his room with every rock photo he could get his hands on, no 
matter how poorly reproduced. "I had pictures of Jimi Hendrix, of some bands 
who I don't even know who they were -- just that they were rock musicians." 
</P>
<P>
He learned English, he said, largely to understand what was being said in the 
rock lyrics. The first Soviet bands chiefly covered Western hits, with just a 
rough approximation of the lyrics. Shumov said he has a recording of a band at 
the time doing the Beatles' "Can't Buy Me Love," "and it sounds like a reversed 
language." As quaint as that may seem, such local efforts were of tremendous 
importance to Soviet rock fans. According to Shumov, "People were really ready 
to die for this." 
</P>
<P>
Before long, he said, bands were doing their own music with Russian lyrics and 
found almost immediate resistance. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the song lyrics were very romantic and not social, even then there 
was censorship," he said, "It wasn't that the lyrics were anti-communist, but 
they (Ministry of Culture officials) were against it in general because it was 
out of (their) control." 
</P>
<P>
Soon it was decreed that before performing, bands would submit their lyrics and 
even between-song comments for approval in advance. Band shows could also be 
only 20% a group's own material; the rest had to be "official" music by members 
of the Union of Soviet Composers. 
</P>
<P>
Shumov became an active musician during the second wave of rock that hit in the 
late '70s, one influenced by punk and such bands as the Talking Heads, Police, 
the Stranglers and Madness. The punk influence certainly didn't soften the 
officials' opinion of rock. Shumov said bands like his had to contend with 
charges of being dissidents, fascists and inspired by the Western secret 
services. Some musicians were jailed as profiteers for smuggling instruments 
into the country, which they did of necessity because there were no Soviet 
instruments available. 
</P>
<P>
Denied the chance to record officially, bands would record their music at home 
on cheap tape recorders and clandestinely distribute copies. Shumov and his 
band, Centre, recorded 16 such albums. It was only after perestroika that he 
learned how widespread and influential those albums became. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a long trip by plane to play in a city in Siberia, and there I came to 
understand they knew . . . all the 16 albums we had recorded in my room. 
Hundreds of people there had heard it." (An album of Shumov's music was issued 
in the U.S. last year on the Gold Castle label.) 
</P>
<P>
But while Soviet rock music was once made as an underground labor of love, 
Shumov said that in the last four years of freedom it has now become "an 
industry," with arena-size concerts glitzed with flashing lights, in which the 
musicians might as well be lip-syncing. 
</P>
<P>
Performers have gone from earning 70 rubles a month to 70,000, he said, though 
the problem of being rich in the Soviet Union is that there is nothing to buy. 
Some have abandoned their homes and moved to Western nations. Others won't tour 
unless they are guaranteed limos, caviar and five-star hotels. Bands clamor for 
the status of having their music issued on CD, though virtually no Soviet 
citizens own CD players. 
</P>
<P>
"They became 100% moneymakers and all their ideas are finished," Shumov said. 
One such casualty, he said, was his own band, and he now works without them. 
"There are very few musicians now who will experiment in their music," he 
claims, saying most choose to make mindless disco tracks. And with the advent 
of a commercial television station in Moscow, there now exists a situation that 
might sound familiar: "If you have money you can become a popular artist -- 
it's like a rule. You can pay for a video cooperative to make a video, and pay 
for it to be on TV so many times. So some musicians I had never even heard of 
existing would be on TV five or six times a day, and they became popular." 
</P>
<P>
Shumov told the audience, "Each of you could come to Moscow, exchange dollars 
for rubles on the black market, make a video and in six months become a very 
popular artist, even if you can't sing or play guitar." 
</P>
<P>
Look eastward, Milli Vanilli.

WINDS MIX FUN, IMPECCABLE MUSICIANSHIP

<P>
Impishness pervaded the ensemble formed by pianist Armen Guzelimian and the Los 
Angeles Chamber Orchestra Winds on Tuesday, and the fun was infectious. 
</P>
<P>
The program of music by Poulenc, presented in Founders Hall at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center, offered considerable opportunity for 
good-natured fun: fast-moving phrases tossed playfully among oboe, bassoon and 
piano in the 1926 Trio; offbeat humor that marched along to Guzelimian's strict 
tempo and unabashed accents in the B-flat Minor Novelette for piano solo; the 
free-for-all abandonment of the allegro vivace opener of the Sextet for Piano 
and Winds. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the group -- with flutist David Shostac, oboist Allan Vogel, clarinetist 
Gary Gray, bassoonist Kenneth Munday, and hornist Richard Todd -- immersed its 
humor in exquisite refinement and impeccable musicianship, and contrasted it 
with moments of commanding profundity. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1962 Sonata for Oboe and Piano -- a lament to Poulenc's friend 
Prokofiev, who had died nine years previously -- Vogel offered a moving elegy 
in dark tones. During the final movement, the duo built to climactic waves and 
receded to a quiet so inviolate that the audience waited a full 20 seconds 
before piercing the silence with applause. 
</P>
<P>
The same duo, joined by Munday in the Trio for Oboe, Bassoon and Piano, drew 
finely etched, unhurried lines marked by minute attention to one another in the 
Andante. True, Munday's bassoon leaked a bit of air here and Vogel's instrument 
hesitated before speaking one or two notes of the sonata. But nothing could 
weaken the special understanding these performers conveyed to their listeners. 
</P>
<P>
Shostac also imparted unique sensitivity to his spotlight, the popular Sonata 
for Flute and Piano. He lost some of the excitement of the first movement, as 
well as some of the contrast between that and the second, by choosing a very 
modest allegro. Instead, he permitted lines to unfold with natural ease, as if 
he wanted to ensure each note its due. 
</P>
<P>
Bolstered by a big, silvery tone, and backed by Guzelimian's ever-attentive 
accompaniment, Shostac sang out the heart-rending cantilena with moving 
devotion and brought unfaltering staccato to a most giocoso presto. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the evening, members of the ensemble displayed practiced awareness 
of one another's musical inclinations. During the prestissimo finale of the 
closing sextet, they finished each other's phrases with an unerring sense of 
inevitability, and effortlessly united the sections of this multifaceted work.

RESTAURANT OWNER GIVES THANKS BY GIVING MEALS

The menu at Tom's No. 12 is a compendium of fast-food possibilities: 
hamburgers, burritos, cheese omelets, chicken-fried steaks and beef kebabs, to 
name a few. 
</P>
<P>
But once a year, owner Damianos (Danny) Stefanidis closes the drive-through 
window and the cash register and stops making pastrami sandwiches, zucchini 
fries and all his regular fare in order to prepare a feast: turkey with corn 
bread stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, vegetables and pie. 
</P>
<P>
He then invites everyone in need of a Thanksgiving dinner to crowd into his 
restaurant, sit down at his 25 booths and tables and enjoy a banquet -- on the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Stefanidis said he serves free turkey dinners to show appreciation for the 
blessings he has received since coming to the United States from Greece 16 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a rich man," Stefanidis said, but at age 37, "I've done all right." He 
owns a successful business -- a unit in a restaurant chain founded by a cousin 
-- and he has a wife and three children. 
</P>
<P>
His Thanksgiving Day gift to the community began modestly five years ago. He 
put a sign in his window offering free turkey dinners to senior citizens on 
Thanksgiving Day. But hardly anyone came. 
</P>
<P>
"We had maybe 15 to 20 people," he said. "A lot of people didn't know about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
He ended up coaxing pedestrians off the street to eat the food he had prepared. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, Stefanidis said, he decided to offer a free dinner to anyone who 
wanted it and publicized the event through the local newspaper. About 400 to 
500 people showed up. Each year since then, the number of people crowding into 
Tom's No. 12 on Mission Boulevard has grown, and Stefanidis is planning to feed 
1,800 between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
Stefanidis pays for the food, but he has the help of numerous volunteers in 
preparing and serving the meal, including the Rev. C. L. Brown and members of 
the Greater Goodwill Church of God in Christ, located a block from the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Stefanidis and Anna Love, who runs the church's outreach program, said 
volunteers planned to cook more than 75 turkeys. Nearly all the turkeys were to 
be cooked in home ovens because the restaurant doesn't have facilities to 
handle the load. Last year, Love said, she prepared five 10-gallon barrels of 
corn bread dressing from scratch for the feast. The pies, too, she said, are 
always homemade. 
</P>
<P>
Love said the project has become a community event drawing city officials, 
judges, doctors and others as volunteer servers. Those who come to eat dinner, 
she said, range from lonely people with no place to go on Thanksgiving Day to 
large families on a tight budget. 
</P>
<P>
Although several Pomona church groups help the needy at Thanksgiving with free 
food, the effort at Tom's No. 12 is unusual because of the fast-food setting 
and the owner's commitment. "Working with him has been a blessing," Love said. 
</P>
<P>
Stefanidis won't say how much the free dinners cost him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to ask you to leave that to myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His reward comes in watching people enjoy Thanksgiving dinner in his 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"You see people with a lot of kids," he said. "They're not homeless, but they 
can't afford a big dinner. They come here. . . . We give some balloons to the 
kids. It makes you feel good. 
</P>
<P>
"You ask how much it costs. It really costs nothing. When these people look at 
you with love and you see you're making these people happy, it costs nothing."

IN BATTLE OF BRAINS, KELLY'S HEROES FIND KEY IS BEING READY

HACIENDA HEIGHTS

<P>
Coach Kelly doesn't do sports. He coaches academics. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Kelly's game is the academic decathlon, an annual high school competition 
requiring mental strength and agility. 
</P>
<P>
His mission last weekend at Gahr High School in Cerritos was to oversee his 
academic powerhouse team from Wilson High School in the ninth annual Los 
Angeles County Academic Decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
As they always have, his team -- the defending county champs -- emerged as one 
of the favorites to win the competition. Those results will be announced Nov. 
28. Winners of local districts go on to compete in the state competition. The 
state winners will vie for the national championship next spring in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The competition gets tougher every year," Kelly said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
There are the Beverly Hills High School students, who don't wear team sweaters 
like most teams, but arrive in smart suits. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's West High School from Torrance. Their classy white sweaters sport 
a stitched-on W. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear they have a parent support group," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
Claremont High School and schools from San Marino, Arcadia, Torrance and 
Diamond Bar also arrive with reputations as teams to beat. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly's strategy for competing against 72 other teams can be summed up in one 
word: preparation. 
</P>
<P>
That's what motivated Kelly to buy about $150 worth of provisions for his 
students out of his own pocket. His team would lunch on baked ham, raw 
vegetables with fresh dip, pasta salad, green beans and homemade chocolate-chip 
cookies. Unlike other teams, the Wilson students wouldn't have to stand in line 
during the lunch break, in the draining sun, for submarine sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly also brought pens with erasable ink. Then there were the cough drops and 
travel-size boxes of facial tissue. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all not feeling so good here today," he said. "We might have a mass 
sinus-drainage problem." 
</P>
<P>
Preparation. Since the start of the school year, the team -- chosen from 
applicants last year -- has met to study every weekday morning from 7 to 8 
a.m., Wednesday evenings from 6 to 8 p.m. and Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
There were two hours of homework for every study hour. 
</P>
<P>
They also met twice a week during the summer. And Kelly spent his entire spring 
break last year and part of the summer compiling study materials. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly's team arrived early Saturday at Gahr High School because Kelly had a 
preliminary conquest in mind. He strode to a picnic table under a large ficus 
tree that he'd scouted out a week in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Here was the best spot for his 16- to 18-year-old high school seniors to rest 
in the shade between the 10 separate tests they'd be taking: economics, 
mathematics, fine arts, English and literature, physical and biological 
sciences, social science, essay writing, prepared and impromptu speechmaking, 
interview and the Super Quiz, a public competition that resembles a raucous 
game show. 
</P>
<P>
Before the competition began, Yvonne Cooprider was cramming. She held up her 
book. "Over 200 pages of fun-filled minutiae," she said, laughing. "We'll 
probably forget it in a couple of weeks. It's in short-term memory." 
</P>
<P>
In a moment she was serious again, reviewing the names of astronauts who died 
in space. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Hung was studying the same book without a trace of humor. He planted 
himself below a tree and slowly turned the pages. Six years ago, the Taiwan 
native knew almost no English. His teammates remember how youths in gym class 
used to make fun of the way he talked. 
</P>
<P>
A shy 17, Hung still isn't comfortable speaking, but he's learned the language. 
And he didn't want to let his friends down. "We don't know how competitive the 
race for first place is going to be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Phillips was trying to concentrate on the muffins and fresh orange juice 
Kelly had provided. "I've transcended nervousness. I'm in state of pure, stark 
terror," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, who has started a collection of first editions of horror tales, 
surveyed the bustling Gahr school grounds. "It'd make a great horror movie," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Phillips works part time at a restaurant, he couldn't help but 
spill some of the orange juice he poured for teammates this morning. His hands 
were trembling. He would later score a perfect five in the pressure-packed 
Super Quiz. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly described his school as classic all-American. "From the million-dollar 
house up on the hill all the way down to the homes by the railroad tracks," he 
said. "We have high, middle and some low." 
</P>
<P>
The dapper 48-year-old widower has trained Wilson teams for seven years. He 
teaches social studies and has a son in the ninth grade. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly's team of 12 has four girls and eight boys this year. His students take a 
preliminary exam to determine which nine will compete in the decathlon. The 
other three students become coaches. They also coordinate supplies and compile 
scores from what Kelly calls the "wailing wall" at Gahr: a wall above a 
shuffleboard court where scores of multiple-choice tests are posted. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's tabulators were the most efficient around, giving Kelly a clearer 
picture of where the top competitors stood than the decathlon officials had. 
Competing teams sometimes came to Wilson's tabulators for unofficial results. 
</P>
<P>
Early scores revealed that Wilson's Anthony Chang got the highest score on the 
fine arts test. Chang was a C student when he joined the team. In fact, the 
rules require each team to have three A students, three B students and three C 
students. To fill the latter category, Kelly seeks classic underachievers, and 
Chang fit the bill, said teammate Joe Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"He was really lazy," Johnson said. "I finally got him studying hard and he 
outscored me. He outscored everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly smiled. 
</P>
<P>
He paled when the social studies test scores were posted. A West student had 
practically lapped the field. West and Wilson seemed to be the teams to beat. 
At day's end, Wilson helped its cause in the overall competition by winning the 
Super Quiz. There were bear hugs all around. 
</P>
<P>
"You become closer to your students than a normal teacher," Kelly said of the 
decathlon process. "That's one of the nice things about it."

POMONA COLLEGE HEARS CALL FROM ASIANS FOR MORE ETHNIC PROGRAMS; 
</P>
<P>
MINORITIES: CAMPUS OFFICIALS MEET WITH STUDENTS, PROFESSORS AFTER STAGING OF 
'THE MIKADO' SPURS LATEST IN SERIES OF PROTESTS FOR CULTURAL RECOGNITION.

<P>
When "The Mikado," Gilbert and Sullivan's look at Imperial Japan, came to the 
Claremont Colleges recently, it drew protests from scores of students and 
faculty members who considered it an example of the colleges' insensitivity to 
Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The show went on, but the protests didn't go unheard. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, about two weeks after the demonstrations outside the Claremont 
Colleges' Bridges Auditorium, Pomona College officials met with Asian 
professors and students to address the needs of that campus's largest and 
fastest-growing ethnic minority. Asians make up 14% of the student population 
of 1,350, while blacks are 5% and Latinos 12%. Two-thirds of the private 
campus, the largest of the Claremont Colleges' six schools, is white. 
</P>
<P>
However, Asians are far behind blacks and Latinos when it comes to special 
services and programs -- a discrepancy campus officials said they intend to 
correct. Although the Claremont Colleges have offered courses in 
African-American and Chicano history since the early 1970s and have 
professional counseling centers for black and Latino students, no such programs 
exist for Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a problem on campus that Asian-Americans are not feeling adequately 
recognized," said Associate Dean Elizabeth Crighton, who met with several Asian 
professors and student leaders Monday evening. " 'The Mikado' was a symptom of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona College history professor Sam Yamashita, one of the "Mikado" protesters, 
contended that the operetta promotes Asian stereotypes, through portrayals of 
"submissive . . . mindless" females and use of "racist" language. He argued 
that it should not have been performed on campus. 
</P>
<P>
The Nov. 2 demonstration was the latest in a series of Claremont Colleges 
protests in the past several years, in which students and faculty members 
staged rallies, wrote letters to deans, and even wore yellow armbands at 
graduation ceremonies to demand courses in Asian-American history, counselors 
for Asian-American students, and more Asian faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
Crighton said the college is considering the demands but she expects change to 
come gradually. 
</P>
<P>
However, Yamashita and Dorinne Kondo, another professor lobbying for the new 
programs, said the slow pace of change is causing students to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Ho, a senior at Pomona who coordinates The Re-View, an Asian women's 
publication, said college counselors have been insensitive to Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"I was having problems with my parents," she said. "The counselor said, 'If 
your parents are such a problem, why don't you move out? Stand up to your 
father and tell him off.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ho said the counselor's response indicated a lack of knowledge about 
traditional Chinese families. "I looked at her in disbelief. If I moved out of 
my parents', I might as well declare that I'm breaking away from my family." 
</P>
<P>
Pomona officials contend that they never ignored the Asian community. 
Asian-American students at Pomona have become politically active only recently 
when compared with blacks and Latinos, said Scott Warren, acting dean of 
students. For years, he said, they were reluctant to view themselves as 
minorities with special problems and needs. 
</P>
<P>
Now, there is a proliferation of Asian student organizations on campus -- 
everything from an Asian women's group to a club for Southeast Asians to a 
student publication geared toward Asian-Americans. In response, Warren said, 
the college has hired Asian staff members and helped set up a student-run 
mentor program for Asian freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
"The black and Chicano centers were created largely out of concerns of student 
movements" in the late 1960s, Warren said. "The consciousness of Asian-American 
students as a minority with particular common interests and needs is relatively 
recent compared to the civil rights movements of the 1960s. It's a matter of 
historical development."

PASADENA: SOUTH LAKE AVENUE AND OLD PASADENA ARE DIFFERENT IN TYPE AND STYLE. 
OFFICIALS ARE TRYING TO UNITE THEM INTO A REGIONAL SHOPPING DESTINATION.

<TEXT>
<P>
While other retailers start the Christmas shopping season battling a sluggish 
economy and fears of war, Pasadena clothing store owners Charlie Bayne and son 
Steve are preparing to leave the fray. 
</P>
<P>
After 36 years of business on South Lake Avenue, Bayne-Williams Shop for Men 
will close in January. The Baynes say two things forced them out: changes 
favoring high-volume, discount outlets in the men's retail clothing industry, 
and the changing nature of South Lake Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena's premier shopping area since the 1960s, South Lake Avenue now 
attracts fewer strollers who once wandered through the street's shops of 
traditional clothing, Steve Bayne said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, strollers throng the nighttime streets of Old Pasadena, an 
up-and-coming area that has emerged as a hot spot for trendy shoppers looking 
for boutique-style bargains. 
</P>
<P>
South Lake Avenue, however, is still by far the stronger shopping street. With 
its established stores and built-in customers in high-rise office buildings, 
South Lake did five times the retail business of Old Pasadena last year. 
</P>
<P>
The two areas provide a marked contrast for Pasadena's holiday shoppers. They 
will also provide the anchors to a fledgling effort to market Pasadena as a 
regional shopping destination. 
</P>
<P>
"The older, more traditional Pasadena resident is probably more likely to shop 
on South Lake," said Bruce Ackerman, executive vice president of the Pasadena 
Chamber of Commerce. "The trendier, newer Pasadena residents and a broader 
cross-section of the community have tended to go to Old Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
After 6 p.m. most Friday nights, strollers throng Old Pasadena's Colorado 
Boulevard. They wander in and out of the area's glitzy boutiques under the 
colorful glare of trendy neon signs. Over on South Lake, the sidewalks are 
nearly empty, the noontime business shoppers long gone. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Plotkin, a vacuum cleaner dealer and head of the Old Pasadena Business 
Improvement District, sounds almost cocky as he explains the difference. 
</P>
<P>
South Lake businesses "are living off their old mailing lists; their old 
clientele is dying off," Plotkin said. "It happens to every business. It 
happened to me. You have to infuse, and South Lake is just beginning to wake up 
to this." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Holdo, president of the South Lake Business Assn., says that his area is 
at a mature stage and that some changes may be needed. "We want to inject some 
new vitality into South Lake," Holdo said. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that South Lake remains the city's premier shopping district. 
"South Lake and Old Pasadena have different roles at this time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
South Lake, filled with traditional men's and women's shops and shoe stores, 
began its ascendancy at a time when Old Pasadena, which dated from the 1920s, 
was languishing. 
</P>
<P>
South Lake encompasses 458 stores and businesses along South Lake Avenue from 
Colorado to California boulevards, including adjacent Shoppers Lane. The avenue 
still brings in hefty sales. City statistics put last year's gross sales at 
$147.2 million, a $22-million increase over 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Old Pasadena had $28.6 million in gross retail sales last year. In contrast, 
Plaza Pasadena, the city's only shopping mall, on Colorado Boulevard just east 
of Old Pasadena, had $77 million in 1989 sales. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, however, a few of the family-owned, traditional men's stores -- 
like the Bayne-Williams Shop for Men -- have moved out of South Lake. They were 
victims, Holdo and Ackerman said, of discount houses and department stores that 
offer the same clothing at cheaper prices. In their place, South Lake now has 
chain stores, selling the same goods but owned by large corporations. 
</P>
<P>
The area also has a large number of high-rise office buildings with thousands 
of business and professional workers, whose existence guarantees that the 
downstairs shops will continue to flourish. It is an element that Old Pasadena 
lacks, Holdo said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet a handful of the business and professional workers have also brought a 
discordant note to South Lake. About 60 of them refused last year to pay the 
area's annual business assessment fees. The fees ranged from $150 to $300 per 
business and are used for street improvements and advertising promotions. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters claimed that such expenditures may increase ground-level 
business but do little to increase visits to the high-rise offices of doctors, 
accountants and attorneys. Most of the holdouts paid up when the city took them 
to small claims court. Two, however, appealed to Pasadena Superior Court. A 
decision is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the association is trying to expand the appeal of the area. Under a 
proposed "Streetscape" program, benches, bicycle racks, trash bins and two 
concrete identification signs will be installed to encourage more pedestrian 
traffic. Such changes would have been implemented even without the impending 
competition from the One Colorado shopping center in Old Pasadena now under 
construction, Holdo said. 
</P>
<P>
"South Lake is one of the oldest shopping areas in this area," Holdo said. "It 
represents the core of high-end retailing." 
</P>
<P>
But Plotkin believes that South Lake may be burdened by its own success. He 
contrasts the 300 small, individually owned shops in Old Pasadena and their 
ability to unite on sales promotions and street events to the corporate-owned 
giants of South Lake. 
</P>
<P>
"Who do you talk to at Barker Bros., Silverwoods, Bullock's or I. Magnin?" he 
said. "They're corporations, an institutional type of retail store." 
</P>
<P>
Although Old Pasadena -- bounded by Arroyo Parkway, Pasadena Avenue, and Union 
and Green streets -- has only about one-fifth the retail sales of South Lake, 
Plotkin thinks that completion of One Colorado, a 260,000-square-foot shopping 
center on Colorado Boulevard, will change the picture. 
</P>
<P>
One Colorado will have "the same type of stores as South Lake, very high 
fashion, very upscale," Plotkin said. "A lot of specialty stores on South Lake 
are going to be dramatically affected." 
</P>
<P>
However, Plotkin admits that his area lacks the office workers that back up 
sales in South Lake. Old Pasadena also lacks major stores. Although most of the 
small retail space in Old Pasadena is almost completely rented out, larger 
spaces of up to 3,000 square feet go unrented. 
</P>
<P>
But the competition between South Lake and Old Pasadena may be more perceived 
than real. Both areas have agreed to participate in a proposed market study of 
Pasadena to improve the city's visibility as a shopping destination and give it 
more clout against malls. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to determine trends, demographics and attitudes of those who visit 
and shop in Pasadena. The information would be used to make Pasadena a regional 
destination for the San Gabriel Valley's 3 million residents, an idea proposed 
by City Director Rick Cole. 
</P>
<P>
Expected to contribute $12,500 each for the study are the South Lake and Old 
Pasadena business associations, the city, the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce, and 
the Pasadena Center Operating Company, which runs the city's convention center. 
</P>
<P>
Cole believes that the two areas could complement each other in a marketing 
strategy. "Old Pasadena and South Lake could become the stars in a crown," Cole 
said. "Right now, we don't have a crown, just the stars."

NEW CURRICULUM TO BLEND BASIC COURSES WITH THEMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District Board of Education has allocated 
$165,000 toward a plan to improve the quality of education at four elementary 
schools and one high school. 
</P>
<P>
A new curriculum is being introduced at Foster Road, Johnston, Gardenhill and 
Walnut elementary schools and La Mirada High School. 
</P>
<P>
All of the schools will integrate basic courses such as math and English with 
different educational themes, said Marie Plakos, assistant to Supt. Robert 
Aguilar. As an example, at Foster Road, students will study the environment, 
and Walnut students will study the performing and visual arts. 
</P>
<P>
The entire community, including parents and civic and business leaders, will be 
invited to participate in the project, Plakos said. "We feel this is really a 
key to motivate students to learn," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Funds will come from the district's lottery allocation and will be used to hire 
four employees who specialize in the various disciplines.

ZONING RULING DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A zoning variance that has become the center of a controversy over alleged 
bootleg rentals in this unincorporated area was delayed Monday by the county 
Regional Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The commission made no decision on the variance requested by homeowners 
Margaret and Guillermo Villareal. 
</P>
<P>
It is opposed by the Altadena Town Council. Instead, the commission asked its 
staff to survey residents surrounding the Villareals' home in the 1500 block of 
East Woodbury Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood is zoned for one house per 7,500 square feet. But a county 
building and safety official told commission members Monday that 38 nearby 
residences have two buildings per lot and another 19 have three buildings per 
lot. The survey could take at least three months, county planners said.

SCHOOL GETS COMPUTER LAB TO TEACH READING, WRITING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $25,000 computer lab to teach kindergarten and first-grade pupils reading and 
writing has been installed at Mark Twain Elementary School in the Lynwood 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The computer-assisted program, called "Writing to Read," uses IBM computers and 
was made available through the Riordan Foundation of Los Angeles and City Bank 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The bank provided the funds for the lab and the Riordan Foundation trained the 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The lab, which has 12 computers and will serve more than 200 during the school 
year, officially opened last week. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation has contributed millions of dollars to inner-city schools 
throughout the nation for computer programs to teach elementary pupils reading 
and writing. 
</P>
<P>
It has contributed more than $150,000 in computer equipment to the Lynwood 
school district during the last two years.

COMMUNITY DIGESTERS: CHEERS FOR THE HOME TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perennial powerhouse Wilson High School of Hacienda Heights pulled out a narrow 
victory in the Super Quiz of the ninth Los Angeles County Academic Decathlon 
held Saturday at Gahr High School in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's last contestant was senior Michelle Ivey, whose father teaches math at 
La Serna High School in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Ivey answered all five of her questions correctly on the topic of astronauts 
and space travel to ice her team's narrow win over West High School of 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
The Super Quiz, which resembles a raucous game show, is the only public segment 
of the decathlon, which tests students in 10 subject areas, including science, 
social studies, writing, public speaking and fine arts. 
</P>
<P>
The team that places first in the overall competition will represent Los 
Angeles County in the state competition. The victor will be announced next 
Wednesday at a banquet in Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
But all the teams are winners, said Compton teacher and team coach Nancy 
Miller. "We're getting all this positive attention for academics, and it rubs 
off on other students," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Contestant Ramiro Medina of Compton said he could barely speak English six 
years ago. Now he is getting straight As and competing for his school. "The 
decathlon is important not just because we want to win, but for the experience. 
It's helped me to become a well-rounded person," he said.

Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer announced at this week's City Council meeting 
that he will not seek reelection when his term expires next spring, nor will he 
run for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
But Nymeyer, who unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination in the 65th 
Assembly District this year, said he might run for office at the state or 
federal level after legislative districts are reapportioned next year. 
</P>
<P>
Nymeyer, 37, a church pastor, said that after eight years as a council member, 
he no longer wants to spend the hours that the office demands. "I look forward

RENT MEDIATION RESTORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has unanimously voted to reinstitute the city's rental 
mediation program for mobile home parks in response to complaints from tenants 
at the Westland Estates Mobile Home Park whose rents are being raised to $347 a 
month, up from $233, effective Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The park was recently purchased for more than $4 million by Long Beach 
businessman Allen Alevy and Amusement Industry Inc. David Kracoff, asset 
manager for the new owners, said the new rents are in line with the market. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, more than $200,000 is being spent to upgrade the park. 
</P>
<P>
Both Kracoff and tenants said they welcome the city's decision to reinstitute 
its rental mediation program. Park resident Linda Jones said that tenants are 
willing to accept higher rents but that the owners are demanding excessive 
amounts and have offered unfair lease terms.

WAY CLEAR FOR DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Monday approved several measures clearing the way for a 
proposed 186-home development in north La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 1 to approve environmental statements, a zone change and 
the location of property lines within the proposed project by Lewis Homes of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Thomas R. Harvey dissented, arguing that houses in the 
development would be too big. 
</P>
<P>
Unresolved is how much Lewis Homes should pay the city for additional 
firefighters to cover the area. The council asked city staff members to try to 
reach an agreement with Lewis Homes on this point. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis Homes last year sued the city after officials rejected its plan for a 
bigger development. However, the company agreed to drop the suit if an 
agreement on the 186-home project is reached by Jan. 8.

TWO MEN CHARGED WITH CULTIVATING MARIJUANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The district attorney's office has filed charges against two men accused of 
operating a marijuana ring that produced millions of dollars worth of plants in 
high-tech underground farms. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Gegax, 48, of Lancaster, and Richard F. Yerger, 28, of Long Beach were 
charged Tuesday with cultivation, possession and maintaining a place for 
manufacture and distribution of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Last week officials raided a Lancaster home owned by Yerger and found a 
concrete bunker with thousands of plants and sophisticated equipment for 
cultivation. Authorities said the farm could produce as much as $100 million 
worth of marijuana a year. 
</P>
<P>
Another such farm was found last week in Llano, also in the Antelope Valley, 
and two others were discovered in Arizona on Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
A Lancaster judge set bail for Yerger at $2 million. He is scheduled to be 
arraigned Nov. 27 along with two other men charged Monday. Gegax is in federal 
custody in downtown Los Angeles. He also faces federal charges in Phoenix of 
conspiracy to sell marijuana.

LOITERING LAW ADOPTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has permanently adopted a controversial loitering law that 
police say has been instrumental in increasing drug arrests in troubled areas 
of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The law, which allows police to arrest a person suspected of loitering to buy 
or sell drugs, was adopted last March on an experimental basis, Police Chief 
Joseph A. Santoro said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has met with community leaders and ministers to assuage concerns 
that the law is unconstitutional and discriminatory against blacks. There was 
no public opposition to the council's unanimous action Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The law has has resulted in five arrests. In two cases the charge was upgraded 
to felony sale of cocaine and in a third to possession of marijuana. The other 
two people who were arrested pleaded guilty to the loitering charge and were 
fined $705 and given three years' probation, Santoro said. The council asked 
him to report every six months on how the law is working.

SCHOOL CUTS IN ARTS FOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A standing-room-only crowd of about 450 students, parents and district 
employees protested potential cuts in programs and personnel at Tuesday night's 
board meeting of the Alhambra City School District. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the comments were about possible elimination of district elementary 
music and art programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we should still have the program," said Celeste Flores, 12, who is 
learning to play the flute. "Some children don't have the money for special 
classes." 
</P>
<P>
Others spoke out against potential staff reductions that could eliminate as 
many as 27 jobs and deprive other employees of health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts were adopted Nov. 6, then rescinded a week later. Since then, 
administrators and union negotiators have been discussing alternate cures for a 
$600,000 budget deficit.

ARMED FORCES: FREQUENT TRANSFERS MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR SPOUSES TO BUILD 
CAREERS. THE MILITARY SPOUSE CAREER NETWORK OFFERS SUPPORT.

<P>
Two months ago, Becky Crusoe enrolled in a graduate program in Los Angeles, 
planning to pursue a long hoped-for degree in clinical psychology. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, her husband, a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force, announced some 
unwelcome news: He is due to be reassigned to another city sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
After 18 years as a military spouse, Crusoe says, she should be used to this 
sort of disruption. But the experience is still jolting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a real good time to get orders," the Torrance resident said somberly 
as she broke the news to members of the Los Angeles/Long Beach chapter of the 
Military Spouse Career Network, a group she helped found and now heads. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the group had gathered for the evening at the Ft. MacArthur Community 
Center in San Pedro to talk about exactly that -- the effects of military life 
on spouses struggling to maintain careers. 
</P>
<P>
They talked about the problems they face building their careers. Spouses who 
need to get state licenses -- as psychotherapists, for example -- might gather 
the needed credentials and then have their husbands reassigned to another state 
with new requirements. Some employers are reluctant to hire military spouses, 
fearing they will learn the job and then leave. And on some more conservative 
military bases, wives who manage to piece together careers can find themselves 
without a support structure. 
</P>
<P>
"The traditional military wife, the idea of her working -- you just wouldn't 
hear of it," Crusoe said. "Her job was, first, to get him promoted, and two, to 
raise her family." 
</P>
<P>
The kind of disruption military spouses face is reflected in the turnover among 
officers of the fledgling career network. 
</P>
<P>
Crusoe, 39, is the second president of the one-year-old chapter. Its first 
president, Audrey Cleary Bailey, was whisked off to San Francisco in August 
when her husband, a Navy captain, was reassigned. And the network's treasurer 
is due to leave with her husband this winter. 
</P>
<P>
During the last two decades, the feminist movement and economic necessity have 
propelled large numbers of women into the work force. For military spouses -- 
who remain predominantly women -- that transition has been particularly 
difficult because their lives are punctuated by "new orders" that mandate 
frequent cross-country moves. 
</P>
<P>
These are the people that the Military Spouse Career Network seeks to serve. 
Its founders describe it as a forum where military spouses from all branches of 
service can exchange information, support one another and develop contacts with 
others who share their career goals. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of support system could soften the impact of moving, said Bailey, who 
has moved 14 times with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"Keeping two careers going is one thing," she said. "Trying to take it on the 
road every two years is something else." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles/Long Beach network, founded in November, 1989, now has about 
100 members, predominantly Air Force and Navy spouses. They pay $20 annual dues 
and attend general meetings every two months. 
</P>
<P>
The local network is only the fourth of its kind in the country, members say. 
Groups also are operating in Washington, D.C., San Diego and Hawaii, all areas 
with large military populations. The San Diego network, formed in late 1988, 
has nearly 200 members, primarily Navy spouses. 
</P>
<P>
The concept is spreading. Bailey, the former Los Angeles president, plans to 
form a Bay Area group. She said another group is organizing in Charleston, S.C. 
And there is talk of a chapter in Japan. Organizers hope that in time, a truly 
national organization will develop so that spouses moving around the country -- 
or even the world -- will be able to plug in to the network in their new 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
As last week's meeting began, Crusoe asked the 20 women and one man to stand 
and introduce themselves. 
</P>
<P>
A young woman said she has two daughters. "Right now, they're my career. Beyond 
that, I'm undecided. That's one of the reasons I'm here tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Another woman complained: "Every time I move, I change careers." The women 
around her laughed knowingly. 
</P>
<P>
About 75% of military wives now work, Crusoe said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those who spoke are working outside the home, but few have jobs in 
their chosen fields. 
</P>
<P>
A former teacher said she is now working as a secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Shaver, 42, a military spouse who moved to Los Angeles in July, has 
worked in politics and marketing. Now she is busy with her three children, ages 
16 months, 2 1/2 and 4. She said that her MBA degree, matted in pink, hangs 
over her kitchen sink. "I have no idea what I'm going to do," she said. She has 
thought of trying to develop a free-lance business as an events planner. One 
speaker at the network meeting urged women to bring in their business cards for 
other women in the network. 
</P>
<P>
Shaver leaned over and offered the woman sitting next to her a blank index 
card. She said wryly: "Here. Here's my card." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Metzer is also a military spouse, but one with a different perspective. 
</P>
<P>
His wife is Patricia A. Tracey, the Navy captain who this summer took command 
of the Long Beach Naval Station. 
</P>
<P>
Like the women in the network, Metzer knows the tribulations of military life. 
Tracey moves about every two years, he said. Although Metzer and Tracey have 
been married 13 years, they have lived together only about half that time, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Metzer, whose background is in computer software development, found a job 
relatively easily with a data communications firm in El Segundo. The computer 
field is more flexible than some careers for people who move frequently, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Both he and Tracey attended the network meeting, and Metzer says he plans to 
stay involved. He has even thought of developing a jobs bulletin board, a 
computer listing that military spouses could use to send out their resumes. The 
spouses' group could build such a computer network as it spreads to new cities, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The main speaker at last week's meeting was Dorothy B. Mitchell, coordinator of 
the Long Beach City College Career Center. A former military spouse herself, 
she described how she married at age 15 and, as a young mother, trained herself 
to wake up at 4 a.m. to study for college. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me 18 years to become a clinical psychologist," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the Los Angeles network hope it will grow to serve the needs of a 
variety of spouses -- those working part time and full time, those raising 
families, and those married to enlisted military personnel as well as those 
married to officers. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the group recently changed its name from the Military Spouse Business 
and Professional Network. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought that people were perceiving that you had to be a, quote, 
professional, in order to join this network," said Glenda Collins, the 
publicity coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
The group's focus is very different from that of the traditional officers' 
wives clubs or spouses clubs, Crusoe said. Those clubs are more socially 
oriented, with events serving women whose main focus is raising their families, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The working wife, she wants to know, 'Who are the good employers? Is there a 
bias here?' " 
</P>
<P>
Network organizers have talked of starting a weekly job-hunting support group, 
Crusoe said. It might meet on a Monday morning, and members could share 
information and their goals for the week. Once members found jobs, they would 
automatically drop out of the group, Crusoe said. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers hope the network will grow of its own accord, spread by members who 
move on to new cities. 
</P>
<P>
Crusoe described a letter she received from a dentist who recently married into 
the military. 
</P>
<P>
"Now she's living in a foreign country, on a base where they staff their 
dentist office with military people, and she couldn't get a job. It was awful. 
And worse, it took three months for the letter to get to me."

GRANT TO FIGHT OIL REFINERY SOUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: COMPTON NEIGHBORHOOD BLAMES PLANT FOR HEALTH PROBLEMS. STATE MONEY 
COULD HELP RESIDENTS' CAUSE.

<P>
About a dozen people, mostly elderly men with time on their hands and young 
women with sleeping babies or squirming preschoolers on their laps, met 
recently in the library at Jefferson Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
They are "sensitive receptors," the scientific term for people in the path of 
pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in bed most of the time. I've been hospitalized with asthma and 
emphysema," said the only elderly woman in the group. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my sons has a lot of asthma," said one young woman. 
</P>
<P>
"She says her daughter has a stomach ailment and . . . a rash," said another 
woman, translating for a Spanish-speaking participant. 
</P>
<P>
They blame DeMenno-Kerdoon, an oil refinery in the center of their 
neighborhood, for their health problems. And with a grant from the state they 
hope to mount a campaign to get rid of the refinery. About half of those in the 
group did not speak English. None had been to college, and many did not have 
high school educations. 
</P>
<P>
Yet they must do battle in an arena where the rules revolve around such things 
as suspended particulate matter, annual arithmetic averages, source performance 
standards and nitrogen and sulfur dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
The group is applying to the state Department of Health Services for money 
under a new state program called the Community Technical Assistant Contract 
Grant Program. It is designed to put ordinary people on an equal footing with 
state bureaucrats and experts hired by private industries that are accused of 
polluting neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The Compton group wants a $25,000 grant to hire a scientist to evaluate the 
performance of the oil refinery a block from Jefferson school on the city's 
north side. 
</P>
<P>
DeMenno-Kerdoon and other refineries are going through a new and extensive 
permit process that takes almost two years to complete. The Compton group wants 
the scientist to help them prevent the refinery from obtaining a permit. 
</P>
<P>
"The people don't want it here," said Joe Ochoa, a longtime Latino community 
activist and labor organizer who is spearheading the quest for the state grant. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe this group can do something," Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
DeMenno-Kerdoon's hulking black storage tanks cover the block on North Alameda 
Street between Pine Avenue and Oaks Street. The firm employs about 60 people. 
Bruce DeMenno bought it in 1974, and Steven M. Kerdoon became his partner in 
1975. It recently underwent a financial reorganization under federal bankruptcy 
laws, Kerdoon acknowledged, and now 80% of it belongs to World Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, residents around the refinery, reputed by its owners to 
be the nation's largest recycler of petroleum, have complained that it is 
polluting the neighborhood, threatening their health and sullying everything 
from their laundry to their lungs. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when you roll your windows up, you feel it in your nostrils and your 
throat. It's terrible," said Sylvia Perez, describing the odor that residents 
say hangs over the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Macedonia Ponce, 71, and her husband, William, have made their home in the same 
location for 57 years. The oil refinery was built at least 40 years ago just a 
block away, and Macedonia Ponce blames it for her respiratory ailments. Two 
years ago they became so severe that she was in and out of the hospital and on 
a respirator for a while. A film of oil from the refinery lies over the entire 
neighborhood, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I close all my windows and doors to try to keep it out," she said in a 
interview this week. "But it doesn't stay out, because in the morning the 
tables and chairs, they all have a film of oil or soot or whatever it is. It's 
hard to keep our curtains clean." 
</P>
<P>
At the school, complaints about the fumes are commonplace. "Some days it was so 
bad it actually made certain people nauseated and a lot got sore throats," said 
Hector Contreras, who worked at Jefferson until this fall, when he became vice 
principal at another school. 
</P>
<P>
"The first year I was (at Jefferson) was 1985 and I developed an acute case of 
asthma," Contreras said. "I had asthma as a child, but I had not suffered an 
asthma attack since then." 
</P>
<P>
The fumes were so bad sometimes, he said, that they invaded the classrooms and 
the children had to be rushed outside to gulp fresh air. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, DeMenno-Kerdoon last year pleaded no contest and paid $2,300 in fines 
and penalties as a result of misdemeanor charges that the firm contaminated the 
air around the school on two separate occasions. The charges were brought 
against the firm after school officials summoned investigators from the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
Kerdoon said he and his partner are doing everything possible, including 
investing millions of dollars in new equipment, to prevent pollution. The firm, 
he said, wants to be a "good neighbor." It has a checkered history on that 
score, however. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, DeMenno and Kerdoon pleaded no contest to criminal charges of 
transporting and handling nearly 50,000 gallons of toxic chemicals without a 
permit. The firm was fined $400,000, and DeMenno and Kerdoon were placed on 
three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
The chemicals were mostly cleaning solvents discarded by gasoline stations. The 
refinery now only collects oil from gasoline stations and recycles and resells 
it as diesel fuel or for use in making asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
Kerdoon points out that in the Huntington Beach oil spill last year, it was his 
firm that was hired to recycle the oil sucked up from the ocean before it hit 
the beaches. His firm, he says, is providing an environmental service by 
recycling oil. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not just making a product that can be controlled. We're taking care of a 
product that would pollute the environment if we weren't here." 
</P>
<P>
Put his firm out of business, he says, and people will pour the oil down their 
drains or in the public sewers. 
</P>
<P>
Kerdoon says he wants to talk to the neighbors and work with them to solve the 
problems. His business, he says, can be made compatible with a residential 
neighborhood. "If people have a problem, we need to deal with it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The state provides assistance to the community groups and is sending 
representatives to the school again this month. 
</P>
<P>
There are, for example, strict accounting procedures that must be followed if 
the group wins a grant. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the state will award $147,000 in grants, according to Deborah Koven, 
public participation coordinator for the Department of Health Services in 
Sacramento. The Compton group and one other near Santa Barbara are the first 
two in the state to take advantage of the new program, Koven said.

SUPER QUIZ IS TEST OF NERVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD BLUME, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Super Quiz, the last contest of the ninth Los Angeles County Academic 
Decathlon, attracted the most attention because it was the only part of the 
event open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's contest at the Gahr High School gymnasium in Cerritos attracted 
crowds of screaming parents and well-wishers. The winning Super Quiz team gets 
a trophy and bragging rights regardless of how well it scores in the overall 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
The Super Quiz works this way: One student from each team goes to the gym 
floor. Each contestant is handed five questions, with multiple-choice answers 
to choose from. Announcers read the questions aloud for the audience. Students 
write their answers and the results are recorded. 
</P>
<P>
Each team member gets a turn in the spotlight. Results are posted, question by 
question, to the cheers of the spectators. 
</P>
<P>
This year's Super Quiz topic was astronauts and space travel. One question, for 
example, asked students to identify the propulsion system for the Apollo space 
program. (Answer: Saturn V rocket.) 
</P>
<P>
The contest among the 73 competing teams came down to the last round, with West 
High School of Torrance and Wilson High School of Hacienda Heights in a virtual 
tie. Finally, it was down to the last two students. The West student scored a 
tough-to-beat four correct of the five questions. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's Michelle Ivey tallied a perfect five. 
</P>
<P>
Her teammates crowded around her as she collapsed with exhaustion at the foot 
of the bleachers. "I can't breathe," she mouthed silently, unable to speak. But 
her face was beaming. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson Coach Jim Kelly hugged his students as they hugged each other. Kelly 
looked more relieved than elated. He was ready for the pizza party that had 
been scheduled -- win or lose -- at Ivey's house. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not how rich or smart you are," he said of the results. "It's how hard 
you work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SUPER QUIZ RESULTS 
</P>
<P>

PEOPLE IN THE NEWS: HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR TO RETIRE FROM JPL COMPUTER JOB AT 75 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL BEN-ALI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For some workers these days, retirement age is 55, or even 50. 
</P>
<P>
Not for Alex Glattstein Stone, who, despite quadruple-bypass heart surgery 
several years ago, has no intention of turning in his working papers until his 
75th birthday, early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Officially a senior programmer/analyst at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena but a self-described "mathematician doing computer programming," Stone 
is developing a computerized telephone directory for JPL's 9,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an excellent worker and very sensitive to people," said Fernando Alvarez, 
Stone's supervisor at JPL. Stone has also written a computer software user's 
manual and a recent article for JPL's newsletter, Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe his age allows him to understand people much better," Alvarez said. "He 
gets along with people very well." 
</P>
<P>
"What he does is always done well," added Janet Zadeh, a former boss. "He's 
probably more thorough than a lot of the younger workers." 
</P>
<P>
Stone returned to work only three months after his heart surgery in 1981. 
"Actually, (my doctor) thinks working is good for the health," he said. "As 
long as you don't work under stress or duress or something like that, and I do 
not." 
</P>
<P>
But severe stress shaped his early life. Born in Hungary in 1916, Stone studied 
law instead of mathematics at the university because anti-Jewish laws made it 
extremely difficult for a Jewish student to enter the small math program. 
</P>
<P>
Once enrolled, he had to contend with anti-Semitic students. "A couple of times 
we were kicked out of school -- literally -- by the students," he said. "They 
took us to the top of the stairs and kicked us down because we were Jewish." 
</P>
<P>
By the time he graduated, Jewish lawyers were not being admitted to the bar in 
Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Stone spent most of World War II in forced-labor camps run by the Hungarian 
army, a situation he describes as tolerable. "We still felt like human beings," 
he said. In 1944, however, he was sent to the Nazi concentration camp at 
Dachau, near Munich. 
</P>
<P>
"It was, to say the least, subhuman and miserable," Stone said. "We felt like 
animals." 
</P>
<P>
He and his brother Michael survived. But after the war, he learned that his 
mother and another brother had been killed at Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
Stone immigrated to the United States in 1949. He became a U.S. citizen in 1955 
and changed his name to Stone, keeping his former surname, Glattstein, as his 
middle name. He received a master's degree in mathematics from George 
Washington University in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
He accepted a job with JPL in May, 1969, and has since helped supervise and 
implement software projects for satellite tracking systems and the Voyager 
spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Susan Tarjan Stone, owner of a skin-care salon, live in 
Encino. They have two sons: Peter, 41, and Victor, 32. 
</P>
<P>
Stone, a precise, soft-spoken man with a quiet sense of humor, listed two 
reasons why he hasn't retired already. One is financial. The other "is that I 
like what I'm doing, and when you like what you're doing you don't feel like 
retiring. 
</P>
<P>
"But at 75, I think I'm ready to retire and work at home -- not for money but 
for enjoyment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He detailed plans to write a history of his family and said he'll also play 
with his two personal computers -- and with his 18-month-old grandson, Michael 
-- after retiring at the end of January.

MAYOR SWITCHES VOTE ON ZONING

Mayor Donna Smith voted for a zone change sought by Councilman Tomas Ursua when 
she was allied with him politically last April, but she opposed the same 
project when it came before the council this week, a few days after Ursua 
announced he was running against her for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Ursua accused Smith of treating his project like a "political football," but 
Smith denied she allowed political considerations to influence her actions. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said she changed her mind about Ursua's proposal to build seven new 
houses at 1760 S. Towne Ave. after considering the impact on overcrowded 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
When the zone change came before the council Monday, Ursua, a builder in 
partnership with his father, was ineligible to vote, as was Councilman Boyd 
Bredenkamp, who was disqualified because he had acted on the matter previously 
as a city planning commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Nell Soto and Mark A. T. Nymeyer voted for it. Smith voted 
against it at first, but then abstained after conferring with the city 
attorney. Smith said the attorney warned her that the city might be open to a 
lawsuit if it rejected the project.

DESPITE OPPOSITION, PASADENA TO STUDY SITE FOR SKILL CENTER 
</P>

City directors ordered an environmental impact report on an East Pasadena 
site's suitability for an adult vocational school, despite opposition from 
homeowners and a citizens advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
The 8.5-acre site at 3000 E. Orange Grove Blvd. could become the permanent 
location of the Pasadena City College Community Skills Center, which has 
operated in temporary quarters for 22 years, the past 10 at McKinley Junior 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's vote was 5 to 1, with Mayor Jess Hughston opposed and Director 
William Paparian absent. 
</P>
<P>
The Community Skills Center Citizens Committee saw the vote as an indication 
that the directors have already made up their minds to put the adult school on 
the site. Some of the 12 committee members indicated that they might resign. 
</P>
<P>
"I see that right now the Community Skills Center is a done deal," said member 
Kenneth Moye. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory group wanted the city to prepare three separate environmental 
impact reports on the vacant site -- to evaluate its suitability for housing 
and for open space as well as for the center. 
</P>
<P>
The group also disagreed with the city's legal opinion that the property deeds, 
which date to 1932, no longer restrict use of the land to county flood control 
projects, city streets or parks. Ted Reynolds, the city's assistant general 
counsel, said the land-use promises were made solely to the property owners who 
gave the land to the city. Those promises ended when the donors died, Reynolds 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee was created in June after the center proposal sparked strong 
opposition. Much of it came from the Daisy Villa Homeowners Assn., which had 
twice blocked the city's plans for an auto mall and a retail store on the 
narrow city-owned parcel next to Southern California Edison power lines. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed skills center -- a joint project of the city, the Pasadena Unified 
School District and the college -- would consist of two 25,000-square-foot 
buildings, a parking lot for 600 cars and a child development center. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents argued in June that the 7,000-student center would bring traffic and 
noise to a quiet residential neighborhood. Some of those opponents were named 
to the advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
The issue came to a head when the city planning staff, faced with spending up 
to $140,000 to prepare a three-part environmental report, asked the board to 
focus the study on the center alone. 
</P>
<P>
The narrower report will cost $100,000, and the city may have to pay only 
$33,000 if the cost is shared with the school district and the college.

49ERS REVEL IN FINISH OF WINNING SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Beach Boys' "Be True to Your School" came over the public address system a 
little past noon last Saturday as Veterans Stadium took on its 4,600 fans a few 
at a time for Cal State Long Beach's final football game of the season with 
Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Basking in the sun, these early birds watched the teams warm up. Along the 
benches, orange Gatorade buckets were set in place as graceful receivers caught 
passes and linemen, sweating already as "Hot Blooded" came on, hit one another 
to start the adrenaline. 
</P>
<P>
Punters propelled balls into a milky sky, where they would have been suspended 
high over the stadium rim, if the stadium had a rim. But it has seats on only 
one side -- the vista across the way, beyond signs on a fence that advertised 
beer, health plans and Lotto, was that of residential homes along Clark Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Down past one of the end zones, near party tents that held boosters dressed in 
gold, cheerleaders warmed up too, the females among them being flung high. 
</P>
<P>
This scene -- tension-free and pleasant -- seemed light years instead of 30 
miles from the big-time college football atmosphere at the frenzied, packed 
Rose Bowl where USC and UCLA were getting set to play. 
</P>
<P>
A Bob Seger song was next, but it had competition from the drums of a band 
approaching from a nearly empty expanse of parking lot, where students tossed a 
Frisbee. 
</P>
<P>
The game itself, although not dramatic, was entertaining. Two touchdown passes 
by quarterback Todd Studer and two field goals by Sean Cheevers made victory 
imminent for Long Beach as daylight quickly faded and the chewed sod yielded 
its familiar smell. 
</P>
<P>
The cheerleaders, jacketed against the chill of the shade, lay down their 
pompons and turned the dirt running track into a dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
The clock ticked down and the 49ers won, 29-20, for their first winning season 
in four years. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath, George Allen, the 49ers' senior-citizen rookie coach, smiled 
and waved to an adoring crowd as confetti drifted down and stuck to his yellow 
sweater. 
</P>
<P>
He disappeared through a tunnel, along with his happy, shouting players, who 
looked as if they would not soon forget that they had just shined in college 
football. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers finished 6-5 overall and 4-3 in the Big West Conference. Last year 
they were 4-8 and 2-5. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a remarkable season," Allen said at a news conference Tuesday. 
"I don't think you'll ever see another one at Long Beach, or maybe anywhere, 
quite like it." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers opened with a 59-0 loss at Clemson ("That seems like 10 years ago," 
Allen said) and two weeks later were 0-3. But they won all six of their games 
in Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"These players never gave up," Allen said. "They played 60 minutes and gave 
110% right down to the wire. They didn't give up on the field, they didn't give 
up on the sidelines. I think as they walk around campus they can be so proud 
that they are winners." 
</P>
<P>
Allen, who has a five-year contract, said he has only begun to build the 
football program. "This is a Division I school, but we still need so much to 
make it a Division I program. No. 1 is to get a new stadium. Until Long Beach 
gets their own stadium, they will always be fighting for their lives. When you 
have your own stadium you're going to have more support, loyalty and do a 
better job of recruiting." 
</P>
<P>
Of next season, Allen said, "I want a tight end who is a real strong blocker, 
and we need to get a great running back and a defensive lineman who can rush 
the passer well. I want to bring in anyone who can help us." 
</P>
<P>
Returning will be Studer, who completed 175 of 366 passes for 2,618 yards and 
19 touchdowns, along with his top receivers, Mark Seay and Jeff Exum. 
</P>
<P>
"On paper it looks like we should be better," Allen said, "but we still have to 
improve the defense. And we have only three games at home." 
</P>
<P>
The average home attendance improved this season from 2,650 to 4,697.

SO AIDS PATIENTS DON'T HAVE TO BEAR IT ALL ALONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL BEN-ALI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As 310 fuzzy teddy bears looked on, Jane Wolff read yet another thank-you note 
to her seventh-grade social studies class. 
</P>
<P>
"Your project has brought me a bit of sunshine into my home," she read to 28 
beaming pupils from Temple Intermediate School in Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
Chalk up another success for "Operation Teddy," in which students for more than 
three years have raised money to buy teddy bears for people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Students participating in the project, honored recently by the Rosemead City 
Council, were to present 400 bears to AIDS support organizations at a school 
assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Wolff first brought the AIDS issue into her classroom in 1987, when she told 
students about a friend who died of complications from acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome. "I saw him die over a period of a year and a half, and 
it's awful," Wolff said. "There's nothing you can do. And I knew we had to 
educate these kids some way." 
</P>
<P>
Students who saw a People magazine picture of a person with AIDS holding a 
teddy bear came up with the idea that led to "Operation Teddy," Wolff said. 
</P>
<P>
Students have raised money by selling candy apples and T-shirts, and by 
persuading family members and friends to "adopt" bears for $15 each. Furry 
companions bearing names like Vanilla Ice, Honey Bear and George Bush come 
complete with adoption certificates signed by "judges" like Ted E. Bare and 
"notary publics" like B.Z. Ber and Scarlett O'Beara. 
</P>
<P>
To add some emotional impact to the gift-giving project, students keep the 
bears for about one month before handing them to AIDS organizations. 
</P>
<P>
One recipient, All Saints AIDS Service Center, will try to distribute the bears 
to patients before Christmas. "It's an emotional experience," said Connie 
McCleary, a director at All Saints AIDS Service, a nonprofit agency in Pasadena 
that is participating in the project for the second year. "One man, who was in 
the hospital and in a lot of pain, said that when he held the teddy bear he 
felt like there was less pain." 
</P>
<P>
Another recipient is the Foothill AIDS Project in Pomona. "Because the kids 
work so hard to do this, when you look at the bear you think of the child," 
said Allan Ferrill, the project's education director, who received his own 
bear, Natasha, last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though it's an inanimate object, there's a bonding created because you 
think of the child involved." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to "Operation Teddy" -- which has been expanded to other elementary 
and intermediate schools in the Garvey School District -- intermediate school 
students in gym and science classes receive some information about AIDS, with 
an emphasis on prevention through sexual abstinence, said Maureen Bateman, 
district supervisor for library/media services. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Gonzalez, 13, who said he wants to become a doctor because he likes 
helping people, said he doesn't mind the long hours he puts into "Operation 
Teddy" because it's taught him a lot about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said that, before attending Wolff's class, interaction with people 
with AIDS scared him. "Now I'll go up and shake a man's hand or give a guy a 
hug if it's someone I know who has AIDS. It doesn't bother me anymore," 
Gonzalez said.

MINISTRY FOR HOMELESS WILL CLOSE; SEARCH FOR NEW BUILDING GOES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Still without a new home, a San Pedro ministry for the homeless will close its 
doors Dec. 1 because its building has been judged seismically unsafe by 
building inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
The closing of The Crossing at 7th and Centre streets follows years of warnings 
by the city of Los Angeles that the ministry's brick building, built in 1923, 
must be repaired or vacated. 
</P>
<P>
The owner, Mercy Ships Ministries, a Texas-based Christian foundation, faces 
criminal prosecution if the building is not boarded up by the first week of 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Harlan Heyer, The Crossing's executive director, said Tuesday that the ministry 
hopes to have a new location rented by a week from Saturday. "We're looking at 
several locations and hopefully we can find a place that we can afford," Heyer 
said. The group has provided hot meals at its downtown San Pedro center since 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Crossing's search for a new location, Heyer said, has been assisted by a 
San Pedro couple who donated $5,000 to the ministry after learning of its need 
to relocate.

SIZZLERS IN THE VENDING MACHINE; 
</P>
<P>
WITH LAYOFFS AND THE REVOLT AGAINST CIGARETTE DISPENSERS, TIMES ARE TOUGH. BUT 
THE BUSINESS IS RESOURCEFUL: WHAT ABOUT FRENCH FRIES? OTHER IDEAS ARE COOKING, 
TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Since the coin-operated dispenser was patented in 1886, there is little that 
entrepreneurs haven't figured out how to sell from a machine. Automobiles, 
investment advice, water skis come to mind. But there's one that really rankles 
the vendors: the french fry. 
</P>
<P>
The hot oil needed to cook french fries causes so many maintenance problems 
that the machine-vended fry has been a commercial flop. Duane Neibel, who 
teaches vending machine repair in Tampa, Fla., explains that the intense heat 
cooks not just the fries but the machine itself. 
</P>
<P>
Now, potato people from Boise, Ida., are conducting field tests on a vending 
machine that purports to do french fries without the oil -- and thus without 
the problems that always frightened off the nation's vendors. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, this latest effort has caused a stir in the vending fraternity, 
otherwise preoccupied of late with the inadequacies of the dollar bill, the 
anti-smoking frenzy, the demise of the American factory and other continental 
shifts in American life. 
</P>
<P>
The french fry is a powerful piece of business that could unquestionably bring 
some sizzle to the market -- and write a new chapter in the seldom read but 
often interesting story of the $24 billion-a-year vending industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mammoth step forward," says Tom Koosis, a big Detroit vendor who tasted 
the latest machine fries at a trade show in Florida a few weeks back. "If it 
works, it will be the biggest change in our industry in the last 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the fry, new technology is having its way with the vending business. 
Next spring, a special credit card from Verifone of Redwood City, Calif., will 
make it possible to buy things from vending machines without money. 
</P>
<P>
And with electronics, the vending machine is counting coins, alerting owners to 
problems, and more. The microprocessor makes it easier to raise prices, for 
example. Or it can give a discount on a Coke to someone who buys potato chips 
from an adjacent machine that is electronically linked. Or it will charge lower 
prices to the night shift at a factory. 
</P>
<P>
Says Neibel: "That's as exciting as these french-fry machines." 
</P>
<P>
It's about time the vendors had some good news, they figure, as they stare into 
the teeth of a recession. Sure, some of them are doing well -- "printing 
money," says one businessman with a close-up view. 
</P>
<P>
But layoffs are starting to cut into their revenues from factories and office 
buildings, the workplaces that vendors rely on for more than half their 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"Business is slow right now," says Don Phelps, the owner of Food Systems Inc. 
in Santa Fe Springs, which has up to 40 machines at a single site. When workers 
are laid off at his aerospace and computer manufacturing sites, he says, "you 
either pull some machines out or you just stand there and suck gas." 
</P>
<P>
Alert vendors during the 1980s deciphered a unique message in the nation's 
shift from a manufacturing toward a service economy. One upshot: the advent of 
the white-collar vending machine. Designed to make money from the smaller 
number of customers in an office environment, it has food, snacks, and hot and 
cold drinks all in one. 
</P>
<P>
"All those auto and steel plants had thousands of employees before they closed. 
Now everybody's working in little white-collar offices, where you can't justify 
a bunch of big machines," says Dave Stone, director of communications for the 
National Automatic Merchandising Assn. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it easy to figure out what to do about the cigarette machine. 
</P>
<P>
Once the soul of the vending industry, the cigarette machine is being run over 
by the health movement and a regulatory outbreak that has seen one municipality 
after another restrict or ban it. 
</P>
<P>
By the tens of thousands, the familiar 200-pound steel cigarette machines -- 
accused of marrying generations of teen-agers to the wicked weed -- are being 
melted down and turned into I-beams, reinforcing rods and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
Some small operators, though, are proving reasonably fast on their feet in 
exploiting the glut of perfectly good cigarette machines. 
</P>
<P>
People like David Baum, president of Mechanical Servants Inc. in Chicago, are 
rescuing cigarette machines from the scrap heap and dressing them up to peddle 
popcorn, perfume, aspirin, fingernail clippers, sanitary napkins and other 
sundries, all boxed to fit the 800 or so cigarette-package-sized slots in each 
dispenser. 
</P>
<P>
The condom, whose role in life has long suited it to the anonymity of the 
vending machine, has been repackaged by a few entrepreneurs into 
cigarette-sized boxes as well. 
</P>
<P>
But in sheer volume, condoms are no substitute for cigarettes. The pack-a-day 
condom customer doesn't come down the pike every day. 
</P>
<P>
And even in disguise, the cigarette machine has a bad aura. Perfume Vendors Co. 
in Salt Lake City had some cigarette machines painted pink in hopes of selling 
little bottles of perfume from them. But "the image was wrong," says Richard 
LaFrance, sales manager. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the industry's image problem took shape a few decades ago but 
lingers on today. 
</P>
<P>
In the early days, starting with the Tutti-Frutti gum dispenser in the 1880s, 
the vending industry was so innocent that there was no "rounding up" of prices. 
A 14-cent package of cigarettes cost 14 cents. A customer would insert a dime 
and a nickel, and his cigarette pack would emerge with a penny in change that 
the straight-arrow vendor had slipped inside the cellophane wrapper. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1958, a parade of reputed mobsters appeared before U.S. Sen. Estes 
Kefauver of Tennessee, whose congressional committee was investigating 
organized crime. Asked what they did for a living, one after another explained 
on national television: "I'm in vending." 
</P>
<P>
To distance themselves, the legitimate vendors started calling themselves 
"automatic merchandisers," but this hasn't helped much. "That reputation has 
stuck for 30 years," says PR man Stone. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, a steady improvement in the quality and technology of machines and 
food, the advent of the microwave oven, and the education of new generations of 
Americans in doing business with inanimate objects all worked in the vendors' 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, though fast-food joints have become a big competitor, 
vendors managed a 9% average annual increase in dollar sales -- chiefly by 
jacking up prices, judging from data in the trade publication Vending Times. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Sanford, editor, says there aren't a lot of economies of scale in the 
vending business. So despite the presence of such longtime major corporate 
players as Canteen Co., small and mid-sized independent local operations -- 
often family run -- still control 70% of the business. Virtually all are 
privately held. 
</P>
<P>
Typical is Koosis, a one-time math teacher in Detroit who bought a few gumball 
machines as a sideline 21 years ago and now has 110 people working for him at 
HAV Vending &amp; Food Services Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Fiercely independent by nature, the vendors are an anonymous bunch not given to 
rumination, says editor Sanford. Information about the industry is scarce, and 
marketing decisions are strictly seat-of-the-pants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always getting calls from young women who want to know which products sell 
best from the slot in the upper left hand corner of a snack machine," Sanford 
says. "I tell them nobody studies that kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps for lack of such forethought, the fanciest ideas may have passed many 
vendors by. Automatic teller machines, for example, are owned and operated by 
banks. Young technology firms sniff around the edges, inventing cashless 
automatic-payment systems for retailers. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the retailing function is becoming more automated, and I wish the 
vending industry had a more commanding position in it," says Sanford. 
</P>
<P>
Today, vendors are nervously watching the inflation index. They hate inflation 
more than anything. Rising prices require customers to carry around so many 
coins that many find it easier to buy their products elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're selling cigarettes at $2.50, it takes 10 quarters," says vendor 
Phelps. "You dig?" 
</P>
<P>
The devices on vending machines that accept dollar bills are not a satisfactory 
answer to vendors, who complain that the retrofit gadgets are unreliable at 
$500 a pop. 
</P>
<P>
That's why vendors have joined with the blind and other unlikely allies to push 
federal legislation that would abolish the dollar bill -- which blind people 
can't identify by touch -- and replace it with a dollar coin. Congress has 
found other issues more pressing and put off action until next year. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar coin would be especially momentous because it would help every 
category of vendor. That includes the coin laundry people, the game and jukebox 
operators, and what's known as "the gumball and rubber octopus" part of the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
But back to the french-fry machine. 
</P>
<P>
Ore-Ida, a synergistic subsidiary of ketchup-maker Heinz, cooks the fries with 
hot air in what is basically a convection-oven approach. Stone and others 
report that the fries are very good. This is boldly confirmed by Joe Finch, the 
head of Ore-Ida's French fry venture. 
</P>
<P>
Ore-Ida has solicited bids from several vending-machine manufacturers and hopes 
to have 50 or 100 French fry machines in field tests by next spring. Meanwhile, 
it will work on what is described as a slight smoke and odor problem. Ore-Ida 
will decide in a year whether to enter full-scale production. 
</P>
<P>
With french-fry machines installed at just 1/2 of 1% of the nation's current 
vending machine sites, Ore-Ida figures it could sell more than 100 million 
pounds of potatoes a year. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody is saying what it would be worth to the vendors. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in this to sell potatoes," Finch explains.

BUSH SET FOR TURKEY IN DESERT, ASSAD MEETING; 
</P>
<P>
MIDEAST CRISIS: THANKSGIVING WITH TROOPS DESIGNED TO BOLSTER HIS GULF POLICIES. 
AND TV WILL BE THERE TO COVER IT.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush arrived here Wednesday night preparing for a Thanksgiving Day 
extravaganza designed to shore up support for his Persian Gulf policies, while 
announcing plans to meet with Syrian leader Hafez Assad, whose past connections 
with terrorism could undermine Bush's program. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's Thanksgiving in the desert, complete with handpicked troops, stirring 
backgrounds and network anchormen, is a carefully designed television 
production that the White House hopes will increase public approval for the 
face-off against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's schedule has been timed to the minute -- five minutes to talk, four 
minutes to walk through the chow line, 25 minutes to eat -- all to allow him to 
"go live" having turkey with the troops on network morning news shows at 
precisely 8:15 Eastern time (5:15 a.m. Pacific time) Thanksgiving morning. 
</P>
<P>
But even as his aides planned for this major public relations effort, Bush's 
announcement that he will meet Friday with President Assad is likely to 
complicate the image of his anti-Iraq campaign, given Assad's history of 
support for international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Government terrorism experts blame the Syrians for involvement in the 
destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 two years ago and in the bombing of the U.S. 
Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983. The truck-carried bomb in the Beirut attack, 
which killed 241 American servicemen, was most likely assembled in Syria and 
driven through Syrian-held territory in Lebanon on its way to its fatal 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
The juxtaposition of the trip to the desert and the meeting with Assad 
underline the contradictions that Bush must try to handle to keep both his 
international and his domestic coalitions together. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials insist that the meeting with Syria is necessary to maintain good 
relations with a key ally in the fight against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Syria, which borders Iraq on the north and west, has sent about 4,000 troops to 
Saudi Arabia. U.S. officials believe that the endorsement of Assad, a militant 
Arab nationalist, helps blunt Iraq's claim that only "Western imperialists" 
support the campaign against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein over his invasion and 
occupation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many polls have shown declining support for Bush's Persian 
Gulf policy, and experts in public opinion say much of the problem is that many 
Americans have difficulty seeing the conflict as a clear issue of right versus 
wrong. Part of that problem is due to the unsavory reputations of U.S. allies 
in the gulf conflict, most notably Assad, pollsters suggest. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, debate continued about when, and under what conditions, the United 
Nations might approve a resolution giving the green light to the use of force 
against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving Paris at the end of the three-day Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told reporters 
that the U.N. Security Council should consider the "very dangerous" 
developments in the gulf and "take a decision there." 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev did not detail exactly what sort of decision he would like to 
see. 
</P>
<P>
French President Francois Mitterrand, also speaking in Paris, said he was in 
general agreement with the Bush Administration's desire to see a Security 
Council resolution approving force against Iraq but differed sharply from the 
U.S. line in two key respects. 
</P>
<P>
First, he said, a resolution could authorize the use of force, but "as far as 
its actual implementation is concerned, this cannot be automatic" -- implying 
that a second Security Council vote actually triggering military action would 
be needed before any attack could be launched. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has been seeking a resolution that would approve the 
use of force in advance and leave the United States free to decide for itself 
the timing of any action. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Mitterrand indicated that France would not participate in a 
military action without an explicit U.N. resolution. Bush and his advisers 
argue that although a resolution would be good to have, military force can be 
used even if the United Nations does not act as part of Kuwait's right to 
summon other nations to assist it in "self-defense." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Bush said to me, 'Do you think that we need to adopt a new resolution 
within the Security Council which would authorize the eventual use of force?' I 
told him yes," Mitterrand said. 
</P>
<P>
All that left Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who has been traveling the 
world seeking to line up Security Council votes for a resolution, somewhat 
vague. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an ongoing process, and we are in the process of continuing that 
process," Baker said when asked by reporters in Jidda about what stage the 
consultations had reached. 
</P>
<P>
Baker plans to meet today with officials in Yemen, a member of the Security 
Council and a pro-Iraq neighbor of Saudi Arabia, and will travel Saturday to 
Colombia, also a member of the council, to consult with that nation's foreign 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration is hopeful that the Security Council can complete work on a 
resolution sometime next week, before the United States loses its chairmanship 
of the council Nov. 30 in the normal rotation. But some diplomats at the United 
Nations have said that timetable may be overly optimistic. Baker was typically 
elliptical when asked about the timing of a resolution. "This is the 22nd of 
November, and November has 30 days," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker spoke to reporters in Jidda after Bush held a dinner and a 1-hour, 
45-minute meeting with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. That meeting, and a similar 
brief talk with Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah, the exiled emir of Kuwait, 
constituted the only diplomatic business on Bush's Saudi Arabia agenda, most of 
which will be taken up with the televised Thanksgiving Day dramatics with the 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
The preparations for that visit, particularly the needs of U.S. television 
networks, have consumed both U.S. military authorities and Saudi government 
officials over the last week. 
</P>
<P>
Here, for example, the city's most visible landmark is a huge fountain that 
shoots a plume of water into the air the length of a football field. Normally, 
a Saudi official said, the fountain is turned off at night during winter 
months, but the government agreed to keep it running so that NBC-TV could use 
the dramatic sight as a backdrop for its correspondents. 
</P>
<P>
Those same considerations have been very much at the center of the White 
House's planning for Bush's Thanksgiving trip. Access to Bush's visit has been 
tightly restricted for reporters who might ask too many questions of the 
troops, but arrangements for televised coverage of Bush's remarks have been 
made on a large scale. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the troops, Bush plans to leave Saudi Arabia en route to 
Cairo tonight and is scheduled to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 
there Friday before flying on to Geneva for his meeting with Assad. Bush is 
expected to return to the United States early Saturday morning, only to leave 
again on Monday, this time for a two-day trip to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he is at all uncomfortable about the meeting, given Assad's record on 
terrorism, Bush said he had "no problems sitting down with him" to discuss "our 
common objectives in the gulf." 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that this coalition stay together," Bush said. "It's important 
that everybody that's a part of it feel a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Many experts on the Middle East, however, have warned that the United States, 
in trying to get closer to Assad, may be on the verge of making the same sort 
of mistake with Syria as U.S. officials made with Iraq during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked the other way when we knew that Iraq was carrying out a terrorist 
operation," Vincent M. Cannistraro, a recently retired CIA official, told 
reporters Tuesday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the meeting was "not initiated by 
either" Bush or Assad but was arranged by other leaders in the region. 
Administration officials say the President was urged to meet Assad by Mubarak 
and by Turkish President Turgut Ozal, whom Bush met Tuesday in Paris.

JUDGE STUNS MILKEN WITH 10-YEAR SENTENCE; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES FRAUD: SHE SAYS THE TERM IS INTENDED TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OF THE 
EX-JUNK BOND KING. SHE IS CONVINCED THAT HE HAS COMMITTED ADDITIONAL SERIOUS 
CRIMES.

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge sentenced an apparently stunned Michael Milken to 10 years in 
prison Wednesday after ruling that the crimes he pleaded guilty to were neither 
minor nor isolated. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence was by far the harshest imposed in the recent chain of Wall Street 
scandals. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood said the unexpectedly long prison term is 
meant to make an example of the former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond king, 
whose innovative use of high-yield, high-risk bonds had fueled the corporate 
takeover frenzy of the 1980s. Milken had pleaded guilty to six felony 
securities law violations last April. 
</P>
<P>
But in a jammed courtroom in Manhattan's federal courthouse, Wood said that 
Milken, 44, who has been accused, among other things, of helping to bring on 
the national savings and loan disaster, could not be blamed for all of the 
financial excesses of the 1980s. Wood said she had not made him a scapegoat for 
"the decade of greed." The judge said she based the sentence only on evidence 
of specific crimes presented in court. 
</P>
<P>
Milken family members, supporters and lawyers were plainly shocked by the 
sentence. One close Milken adviser said: "No one could have imagined this in 
their wildest nightmare." Defense lawyer Arthur L. Liman left the courthouse 
without commenting and did not return phone calls later. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's sentence also included three years' probation during which he must 
perform full-time community service. The judge left open the possibility of 
reducing the sentence if Milken cooperates with the government. 
</P>
<P>
Milken could have been sentenced to as many as 28 years. But a number of 
lawyers who had followed the case closely predicted that he would get no more 
than five. A Milken spokesman said that no decision had been made on whether to 
appeal the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
During his own lawyer's presentation before sentence was imposed, Milken at 
times was in tears in the courtroom. He then stood and, choking back sobs, 
said: "What I did violated not just the law but all of my own principles and 
values. I deeply regret it and will for the rest of my life, and I am very 
deeply sorry." 
</P>
<P>
But when the judge read the sentence, he stood rigid and motionless, with what 
appeared to be a look of disbelief when she announced the 10-year term. Wood 
also sentenced him to three years of community service while on probation after 
his prison sentence. Milken and his wife, Lori, did not comment to reporters 
and were permitted to leave the courthouse through a back exit. 
</P>
<P>
Under his plea agreement, Milken was already committed to pay $600 million in 
fines and penalties. Lawyers said he must turn over that amount before the end 
of the year. Because of his huge earnings at Drexel, however, his wealth is 
expected to be at least hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said evidence presented during a pre-sentencing hearing in October 
convinced her that Milken had committed additional serious crimes beyond the 
six felony counts he pleaded guilty to in April. Among them, she said, were 
several acts of obstruction of justice relating to orders or suggestions to 
employees to destroy documents. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also rejected longstanding defense claims that Milken's crimes were 
aberrations by a generally law-abiding man and that they were the result of 
overzealousness to help clients rather than greed. 
</P>
<P>
Wood called Milken "a man of talent and industry." But she said: "This kind of 
misuse of your leadership position and enlisting employees who you supervised 
to assist you in violating the law are serious crimes warranting serious 
punishment and the discomfort and opprobrium of being removed from society." 
</P>
<P>
At Liman's request, the judge agreed to sentence Milken under a provision of 
federal law that allows him to be paroled at any time at the discretion of the 
federal parole commission. Although Milken technically could be paroled almost 
immediately, government lawyers said the commission normally requires prisoners 
to serve close to two-thirds of their sentence. In Milken's case, that would be 
about six years. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence exceeds all others imposed in the series of securities fraud cases 
that grew out of the insider trading case against investment banker Dennis B. 
Levine in 1986. Levine himself got two years. Stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky, 
implicated in insider trading on an even grander scale, got only three years. 
Investment banker Martin A. Siegel, who directly stole information from his own 
corporate clients and also received suitcases stuffed with cash from Boesky, 
was let off with only two months. 
</P>
<P>
But in those cases, the defendants had fully cooperated with the government 
before their sentencing, turning in prominent former business associates. 
Milken had not. Under the highly unusual terms of his plea agreement, he is 
obliged to begin cooperating only now that the sentence has been imposed. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said she would consider reducing the sentence if prosecutors 
eventually certify to her that Milken has cooperated fully. 
</P>
<P>
Several lawyers said they interpreted the long sentence as an attempt by the 
judge to ensure that Milken cooperates fully, revealing whatever incriminating 
information he knows about corporate raiders, junk bond buyers and former 
co-workers. Charles Carberry, a lawyer who once headed the U.S. attorney's 
securities fraud unit in New York, said: "I think it was a clear message that 
he should cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
John C. Coffee, a Columbia University law professor, said the judge may also 
have imposed the severe sentence because Milken occupied a position of trust at 
the center of the financial world. "There's a long tradition here of viewing 
very seriously abuses by people with high responsibilities, and this man was at 
the crossroads of capitalism," Coffee said. 
</P>
<P>
The six counts that Milken pleaded guilty to included conspiracy, securities 
fraud, causing the filing of false information with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, mail fraud and aiding in the filing of a false tax return. 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing capped the most massive securities fraud investigation ever 
carried out by the government. Milken, who joined Drexel while still in 
business school in 1969, plucked junk bonds from obscurity and almost 
single-handedly built what at its peak became a $200-billion market. From 
Drexel's junk bond headquarters in Beverly Hills, Milken orchestrated 
transactions that made possible huge leveraged buyouts of such companies as 
Storer Communications and Beatrice Cos. 
</P>
<P>
But as investigators closed in, Milken was forced to resign from Drexel in 
1989, after he was named in a 99-count racketeering indictment and the firm 
itself pleaded guilty to six felony counts. Months later, the junk bond market 
started to collapse. And in February, Drexel was forced into bankruptcy 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's pay at Drexel peaked in 1987 at $550 million. In addition to total 
compensation of more than $1 billion from 1984 to 1988, Milken is believed to 
have received hundreds of millions of dollars from private partnerships he set 
up to benefit himself, family members and employees. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's lawyers, however, said that Milken's lifestyle was relatively modest 
and unmaterialistic. They noted that he had given much of his earnings to 
charities and that he long had personally worked for them, such as by teaching 
math to abused and abandoned inner-city children. 
</P>
<P>
Liman called Milken "a sensitive human being with a social conscience whose 
offenses stand in sharp contrast to his whole life and to his value system." 
Liman also argued that Milken is "just not cut from the same cloth as Ivan 
Boesky." 
</P>
<P>
The judge did not dispute that Milken had donated much to worthy causes, nor 
that his charitable activities began well before the investigation of him 
started in 1986. But she said that was not enough to make up for his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
During the sentencing, Wood disclosed for the first time her findings on the 
unusual pre-sentencing hearings she presided over in October. The so-called 
Fatico hearings were held to determine if there were evidence of additional 
crimes beyond the six to which he pleaded guilty. Under federal court rulings, 
Wood is allowed to consider evidence of other crimes in deciding on a sentence. 
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy written opinion released Wednesday, Wood found that Assistant U.S. 
Attorneys John Carroll and Jess Fardella had failed to prove some of their main 
claims. She said there was insufficient evidence to prove that Milken was 
behind a manipulation of WickesCos. stock in 1986. She said the government also 
did not prove its claim that Milken was guilty of insider trading in Caesars 
World securities in 1983, and also failed to show that he had illegally made 
lucrative investment opportunities available to employees of investment funds 
as inducements to get them to buy riskier securities for their funds. 
</P>
<P>
But she found that Milken had obstructed justice, in part, by arranging the 
destruction of a blue ledger book that showed illegal transactions between 
Drexel and David Solomon, head of Solomon Asset Management. The judge said 
Milken also had made remarks to employees in the Beverly Hills office in 
November, 1986, which could only be interpreted as instructions to destroy 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
Wood also found that Milken had acted improperly by not disclosing to the 
leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. that he had kept 
extremely valuable warrants in a KKR deal for himself and his family instead of 
selling them to customers. 
</P>
<P>
During the sentencing, Wood derided defense claims that Milken was basically 
law-abiding and that if he were not, he would have committed more blatant 
crimes, such as insider trading. She said that an equally likely explanation 
was that Milken was simply afraid to do anything too blatant. 
</P>
<P>
"Your crimes show a pattern of skirting the law, stepping just over to the 
wrong side of the law in an apparent effort to get some of the benefits from 
violating the law without running a substantial risk of being caught," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wood's sentence was viewed as a rebuff to many prominent Southern Californians 
who had written to her urging that Milken's sentence be limited to community 
service. Among those who had proposed that Milken was suitable for such service 
was Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who suggested that Milken work for 
the Police Department's DARE program, created to help inner-city children. In 
court, Liman had proposed that the judge accept Gates' suggestion. The chief, 
through a spokesman, declined to comment on the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
James Slade, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Prisons, said that under 
Justice Department rules, the 10-year term makes it unlikely that Milken will 
be allowed to serve his sentence in a minimum-security federal prison camp. 
Such camps, where Boesky and others caught up in the Wall Street scandals 
served their sentences, have open rooms instead of cells and offer extensive 
recreation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Slade said, Milken probably will be sent to a medium-security prison, 
where there will be a higher concentration of street criminals and fewer 
white-collar offenders. He said that in some medium-security prisons, inmates 
are locked in old-fashioned barred cells at night.

AT A SAFEHOUSE IN IRAQ: HOLIDAY AND HEARTACHE

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few highs and many lows have passed in the more than three months that 
Americans have been held hostage in Iraq, and Wednesday, the eve of 
Thanksgiving, was a time for reflection. 
</P>
<P>
At a diplomatic compound near the Tigris River, where an undisclosed number of 
American men have taken shelter, the mood was somber. Their thoughts were 
concentrated on their families and more than 100 of their compatriots held 
captive at potential military targets under Iraqi guard. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Baghdad hostages will share a turkey dinner around a refectory table 
in the dining room and on the veranda. The U.S. Embassy supplied the bird, a 
reporter brought in the makings for pumpkin pie, and other traditional side 
dishes have been procured by the resourceful detainees. 
</P>
<P>
A television crew has delivered a videotape of this month's UCLA-Washington 
football game. The hostages have all the trappings, but it's not home. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to thank our countrymen for their great and undying support for those 
of us that are in this miserable predicament," said Roland Bergheer, 62, a Los 
Angeles-reared consultant who speaks as the press liaison for the group. 
</P>
<P>
Bergheer, a tall, white-bearded man wearing an open-necked dress shirt and 
jaunty green-checked slacks, was sitting beside a swimming pool with two 
visiting reporters. His fellow hostages remained indoors. The strain of the 
last few months has led them to let Bergheer handle the press. He figured that 
most of them would agree with his words although he said he was speaking for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"This," he said of captivity without any bars -- except the ultimate cage, 
denial of the right to leave Iraq -- "is the most degrading experience I've 
ever been through. I'm being held at someone else's whim. I never expected 
this. 
</P>
<P>
"It strips a man of his dignity. I really don't like to be a pawn for someone 
to play with." 
</P>
<P>
Bergheer scanned the house, the pool and the comfortable grounds, overlooked by 
the homes of a high-ranking Iraqi military officer and a prominent eye surgeon, 
and said: 
</P>
<P>
"It really doesn't matter that we can walk around, smell the roses, take a 
swim. We're suffering." 
</P>
<P>
At this safehouse, most of the Americans are from the South, the Midwest and 
the Pacific Coast states. The average age is about 40. A number of the men, 
including Bergheer, were working on a big petrochemical project when the Iraqis 
closed the door on them in the weeks following the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Bergheer was living at the Sheraton Hotel when the call came from the embassy 
urging him to seek diplomatic sanctuary. "I just started packing," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
At first, some of the men brought their wives and children into the compound 
for safety. When Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was persuaded to let the 
dependents leave, it became an all-male sanctuary -- about 50 initially, fewer 
now that some have been permitted to leave on medical or humanitarian grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Departures are difficult moments. "We have a brotherhood here," said Bergheer. 
"When someone gets out, a lot of hands help with the packing. For a day or so 
afterward, many of the men tend to stay in the rooms, taking a little private 
space." 
</P>
<P>
He and other Americans figure they will be the last to leave if Hussein holds 
to his pledge to free all foreign hostages over a three-month period beginning 
Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, they pass their days reading, watching videos and keeping up 
the house and grounds. "Boring," said a hostage passer-by at the interview. 
</P>
<P>
News comes via the Voice of America and the British Broadcasting Corp. Old 
magazines, even newspapers, brought in by visitors to Baghdad are scoured. The 
embassy has instituted a newsletter for the men with sports scores, news 
capsules and a crossword puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
Household duties are performed according to a rotating roster, and all 
decisions concerning the operation of the safehouse are made collegially at 
daily meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Bergheer, who delivers the latest news from the embassy, says there is no 
command structure among the men. But, senior in age, he clearly has stature and 
seems comfortable speaking for the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
He has led an adventuresome life -- merchant sailor at 16 during World War II, 
the Air Force during the Korean War, then back to the merchant marine as an 
officer and on to private life with steamship companies in San Francisco and 
Portland, Ore. After a brief retirement, he felt the itch to go abroad again 
and worked in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates before taking the job 
here, piling up nearly a decade of service in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Now divorced with four children and five grandchildren, Bergheer attended 
Polytechnic High School in Los Angeles as a young refugee from Nazi Germany. 
His brother, Karl, is a developer and lives in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Bergheer is a key contact between the embassy and his fellow hostages, 
attending the news briefings given by U.S. Charge d'Affaires Joseph C. Wilson 
IV. There is a mutual respect between the two men. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely fond of Joe Wilson," said Bergheer. "He's the type of American 
that simply does not like to get pushed around." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, in a rare on-the-record interview for Thanksgiving, detailed the 
embassy efforts on behalf of the hostages, particularly those to force their 
release. 
</P>
<P>
"We trying to get the Iraqis to behave according to international conventions," 
he explained, saying he is in regular touch with the Iraqi Foreign Ministry 
"from the highest level" to press his case. 
</P>
<P>
"We have pointed out repeatedly that these people should be released" and 
should never have been held in the first place, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Each case presents a problem. Wilson said the wife of one of the Americans held 
at strategic sites had died and, forbidden direct access to the so-called 
"special guests," he could not get word to the husband. He wrote a letter and 
gave it to the Foreign Ministry to deliver. "I have no idea whether my letter 
has reached the man," Wilson said, underlining the isolation of the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
There is evidence that living conditions are improving slightly at the sites, 
he said. Some of the hostages have been permitted to call their families. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the embassy personnel have begun a pen-pal program with the the 
so-called human shields, writing to them via the Iraqis and "trying to develop 
a personal rapport," said Wilson. Those ties are important to America's ranking 
diplomat here, who will spend his Thanksgiving over turkey with the young 
single men of the embassy staff, primarily the Marine guards. 
</P>
<P>
An easygoing man with a sharp wit and a tart tongue, Wilson, who has headed the 
embassy since the invasion, has won a few victories. More than one has taken 
place at Saddam International Airport, with Wilson and Iraqi officials going 
toe-to-toe over what categories of American-connected women and children 
seeking refuge from Kuwait should be allowed to leave for the States. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like two attorneys in a lawsuit, in the litigation phase before a 
trial," he recalled. "When I have to be tough, I have not shied away from some 
pretty strong language." 
</P>
<P>
Generally, he said, his relations with Iraqi officials are "good, considering 
we're sort of sworn enemies." 
</P>
<P>
The hostages are his main concern. While crediting them with being "very 
self-reliant," the embassy keeps a diplomat at the compound "24 hours a day, 
with a diplomatic passport if there's a need to deal with any outside problem." 
Wilson himself attends the compound meetings once a week. 
</P>
<P>
And the hostages respond. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of technical experts out there," he said. "I asked one of them 
to put a new stereo in the ambassador's car so I can listen to Waylon Jennings 
on my way to the Foreign Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
"They provide me with a hell of a lot of personal support." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and Bergheer say they are working toward the same goal with no 
intentions of making any deals along the way. 
</P>
<P>
"When I walk out of here, I want to walk out ramrod straight," the hostage 
said. "My pride intact, my honor as an American."

FED UP WITH REBEL ATTACKS, SALVADORAN PRESIDENT WARNS

President Alfredo Cristiani said a spate of new rebel attacks could derail 
peace talks, but the rebels contend the attacks are intended to pressure 
Cristiani into returning to the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out in half of El Salvador's 14 provinces on Tuesday, with a 
series of rebel strikes leaving at least 27 people dead and 141 wounded, 
officials at the scene said. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital sources put the toll at 27 dead and 165 people wounded. 
</P>
<P>
No fresh fighting was reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the army and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) 
said they expect more fighting in coming days. 
</P>
<P>
Government and rebel representatives have held five rounds of talks since May. 
Negotiations were to resume Nov. 4 in Mexico but bogged down over bitterly 
differing positions on the future role of the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time to say enough to the FMLN. . . . This cannot be called military 
action, since most of those affected are civilians," Cristiani said in a 
radio-TV speech late Tuesday. "It's a new terrorist offensive." 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing these actions do is endanger the negotiating process, since 
violence engenders violence and will not provide the flexible and rational 
conditions needed to end the bloodshed," he added.

STUDY FINDS CHEATING JOINS 3 RS AS A BASIC COLLEGE SKILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Moffatt, an anthropology professor at Rutgers University, had been an 
innocent about student cheating. But that was before he surveyed students and 
discovered, as he put it, that the New Jersey state school "sounds like a place 
where cheating comes almost as naturally as breathing, where it's an academic 
skill almost as important as reading, writing and math." 
</P>
<P>
Rutgers is not alone, according to Moffatt's new and controversial study, which 
suggests that most large, impersonal universities in the United States are 
hotbeds of dishonesty. Grade-crazed students, he contends, should share blame 
with uncaring bureaucrats and remote professors who create an alienating 
atmosphere in much of American higher education. 
</P>
<P>
Experts across the country are divided in reaction to Moffatt's survey. Some 
say that the '90s appear to be a new era of ethics on campuses, with less 
obsession with the idea that grades are the only key to a good career. Others 
say that the Rutgers sampling confirms their own research -- and worst fears. 
</P>
<P>
About 45% of the 232 students in Moffatt's survey reported that they had 
cheated occasionally, and an additional 33% admitted cheating more regularly. 
In anonymous essays, respondents described elaborate cribbing and copying 
techniques worthy of doctoral degrees in subterfuge. 
</P>
<P>
Among hard-core cheaters, the most prevalent method was copying answers from 
another student's test either by plan or chance. Next came studying with the 
help of old tests, on the assumption that professors change multiple-choice 
exams little if at all between semesters. Using cheat sheets, plagiarizing term 
papers and stealing tests in advance also were popular methods. 
</P>
<P>
Members of fraternities and sororities appeared more likely to cheat than 
non-members because of the pressure to share answers with Greek brothers and 
sisters. And economics majors were the worst offenders, leading Moffatt to ask 
whether such dishonesty is "anticipatory socialization for modern American 
business life?" 
</P>
<P>
The study cited many motives, including keeping up with competition for 
entrance into prestigious graduate schools and simply wanting to party, not 
study. But the most damaging to academia's reputation is the widespread motive 
of revenge against large lecture classes and against professors who value their 
own research more than teaching. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the inducements for cheating in undergraduate education, my question 
now has become: Why doesn't everyone cheat rather than resist temptation?" 
Moffatt said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
A national survey in 1987 conducted through UCLA's Graduate School of Education 
found a smaller but still worrisome problem: 18% of college sophomores admitted 
to cheating on an exam, 29% copied homework and 36% did either or both. 
</P>
<P>
In her UCLA doctoral dissertation based on that study, Ann Craig Hanson linked 
the most frequent cheaters to the materialism that overtook campuses and 
society in the '80s. "There is definitely a climate in which students feel it's 
OK to do whatever they need to do to get grades," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson, now associate dean at Middlebury College in Vermont, found also that 
cheating was less common at schools with explicit and well-publicized honor 
codes, where students pledge not to cheat and teachers do not monitor exams. 
</P>
<P>
Rutgers does not have such a code, but about a fourth of the colleges and 
universities in the nation do, including Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Cole, Stanford's judicial affairs officer, deals with code violators and 
rejects Moffatt's contention that most large schools breed wholesale 
dishonesty. Her office handled 32 cheating cases last year, which was double 
that of the year before, but Cole said an increase in reporting may be the 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it's higher than usual, but it's not off the scale. Thirty-two out of 
13,000 students is still a very small number," she observed. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, she has taken extra steps to inform students about the code and 
penalties, ranging from suspension for one academic quarter for first violators 
to expulsion for repeaters. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, experience at Stanford and other universities suggests that the 
materialism that pushed students to seek grades through any method is now on 
the wane. Cole said she is seeing "a heightened awareness among students on 
issues of ethics and standards and how to confront moral choices in life." 
</P>
<P>
However, Moffatt at Rutgers contends that neither codes nor cultural change 
deters deception. He has more concrete suggestions: smaller classes, frequently 
revised exams and more essay tests instead of multiple choice. More contact 
with professors heightens students' fears of getting caught and, Moffatt said, 
students who know a teacher as a human being "feel less willing to rip her or 
him off."

THE ILL WIND INVESTIGATION SO FAR HAS COLLECTED $24 MILLION IN FINES AND 
PENALTIES. MORE INDICTMENTS ARE EXPECTED.

<TEXT>
<P>
The government's Ill Wind investigation of Pentagon procurement fraud, 
responsible so far for convictions of 39 defense executives and consultants, 
former government officials and corporations, is on the verge of another spurt 
of activity. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as next month, some individual and corporate targets are expected to 
decide whether to plead guilty or face indictment and full-scale trials. 
Meantime, a spinoff investigation dubbed Upwind that involves Armand D'Amato, 
brother of Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), is picking up steam before a 
federal grand jury in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND: Launched several years ago, Ill Wind focuses on efforts by U.S. 
defense firms to obtain classified government documents that helped them win 
lucrative contracts. In many cases, the companies paid fees to consultants and 
Pentagon officials to obtain the information. 
</P>
<P>
Ill Wind already has set new standards for scrutiny of white-collar crime, 
including an unprecedented number of FBI agents fanning out across the country 
to conduct near-simultaneous searches as the investigation moved from covert to 
overt status in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the effort has generated $24.4 million in fines, jail terms, 
forfeitures, civil penalties and other recovery. More important than the "cost 
effectiveness" of the searches and surveillance, prosecutors believe the 
convictions, penalties and disclosure of shady dealings have sent a clear 
message to the contracting community. 
</P>
<P>
OPPOSING FORCES: Critics contend that investigations such as Ill Wind at most 
have a transitory impact, because the cases have not led to barring of defense 
contractors from doing future business with the Defense Department. The 
Pentagon believes debarment could injure national security by disqualifying key 
weapons suppliers and that punishment should be left to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
With 10 to 12 federal prosecutors working full time on Ill Wind, the 
investigation eventually could achieve the 100 convictions that Henry E. 
Hudson, U.S. attorney in Alexandria, has long predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Two key targets of the probe -- Melvyn R. Paisley, a former assistant secretary 
of the Navy, and Victor D. Cohen, a former senior Air Force procurement officer 
-- appeared to be heavily implicated when a defense consultant pleaded guilty 
to bribing them to help his clients win lucrative military contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The consultant, William M. Galvin, was praised by prosecutors for his 
"extraordinary cooperation" and drew a 32-month prison sentence -- at least 19 
months less than that recommended by federal sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENT SITUATION: But eight months have passed since his guilty plea, and no 
charges have been filed against Paisley and Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
Paisley's lawyer, E. Lawrence Barcella, acknowledged that he has had 
discussions with Joseph J. Aronica, the lead prosecutor, but said Paisley 
continues to maintain that he did not abuse his office. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen's lawyer, Julian Greenspun, discounted the prospects for any kind of plea 
bargaining, saying he has not talked recently with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. D'Amato's brother Armand, a Mineola, N.Y., attorney, is under scrutiny for 
$70,000 in consultant fees paid to his law firm by Unisys, a leading corporate 
target of the Ill Wind investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators suspect that the payments were compensation for Armand D'Amato's 
help in getting Sen. D'Amato's office to urge that Unisys be awarded a 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Armand D'Amato did not return a reporter's calls. Sen. D'Amato heatedly denied 
the allegation, calling it "a retread" and saying the appeal from his office on 
behalf of Unisys was made "in the normal course of business." He noted that 
Unisys is an employer in his state and that he has been willing to fight for 
any constituent company.

The U.N. Security Council is expected to convene as early as Monday to once 
again consider the Persian Gulf crisis, U.N. sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The focal point would be a draft resolution by Kuwait decrying the suffering 
its citizens have undergone since the Aug. 2 invasion by Iraq. The resolution 
condemns attempts by Iraq to alter the population of Kuwait and to destroy 
Kuwaiti government records. 
</P>
<P>
The debate on the resolution would allow the Bush Administration and Kuwait to 
introduce before the council evidence of the mistreatment of Kuwait's citizens 
under the Iraqi military occupation.

TAXPAYERS LIABLE FOR $2.5 BILLION IN LOANS TO IRAQ

Iraq has defaulted on at least $2.5 billion in loans guaranteed by the U.S. 
government and taxpayers will have to pick up Baghdad's debts, it was reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Examiner cited congressional sources saying the Justice 
Department is also investigating the possibility that the agricultural products 
loan program was used to funnel money and equipment to Iraq as bribes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration decided to funnel aid to Iraq through a quiet little sleepy 
loan program in the Agriculture Department because they thought it wouldn't 
attract too much attention," said Rep. Charlie Rose (D-N.C.). "And now that the 
whole thing has blown up in their face, they are petrified about people finding 
out how we got into this mess." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said a Bush Administration source confirmed the USDA guaranteed 
the bank loans to Baghdad to enable Iraq to purchase American-grown food. 
</P>
<P>
The credit guarantees totaled $5.5 billion during 1982-1990. Iraq halted loan 
payments when the U.S. suspended trade with Baghdad when Saddam Hussein invaded 
Kuwait on Aug. 2.

Navajo voters chose Peterson Zah to lead the tribe as the first elected 
successor to the disgraced former chairman, Peter MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
"The first order of business will be to put the tribe back together," Zah told 
supporters at Window Rock, Ariz., after he defeated interim President Leonard 
Haskie 46% to 32%. Zah, 52, was tribal chairman from 1983 until 1987. He will 
serve as president in a reorganized system of government. The post of chairman 
has been eliminated. Navajo election officials disqualified MacDonald, 61, from 
the ballot after a tribal court convicted him on bribery, ethics and conspiracy 
charges last month.

21 TOYS CALLED HAZARDS FOR THOSE UNDER 3; 
</P>
<P>
CHILDREN: A SURVEY BY A PRIVATE RESEARCH GROUP URGES PARENTS NOT TO ASSUME THAT 
PRODUCTS ARE SAFE. FEDERAL OFFICIALS WILL INVESTIGATE THE CHARGES.

Two days before the biggest shopping day of the year, a private research 
organization on Wednesday cited 21 toys -- including three distributed by 
California firms -- for posing potential dangers to children under the age of 
3. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents should not assume that the toys they find on the shelves are safe," 
said Lucinda Sikes, staff attorney for Public Interest Research Groups, which 
conducted a two-month survey of toys in 14 states. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commissioner Anne Graham said in an interview that 
the federal agency would investigate the products cited by the research group 
"as soon as possible" in an effort to evaluate their safety . 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them are clearly in violation of federal law and can probably be taken 
off the shelves by Christmas," Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
The research group's survey, called "Trouble in Toyland," focused on toys and 
crib gyms that pose strangulation hazards, primarily for children under the age 
of 3. In most cases, the toys have small, detachable parts that could be 
swallowed by infants. 
</P>
<P>
The survey said the number of toy-related injuries treated at hospitals has 
climbed steadily in recent years, increasing from 131,000 in 1987 to 148,000 in 
1989. Nationwide, 33 children have died in toy-related accidents so far this 
year, the organization said. Representatives of two of the three California 
firms listed in the report took issue with its findings. 
</P>
<P>
One product, Baby's First Birthday Balloons, was cited for not including a 
written warning of specific choking hazard from popped or uninflated balloons. 
But a spokesman for the distributor, Trisar Inc. of Anaheim, said it had 
amended its label in July warning that the balloons can pose a hazard for 
children up to the age of 6. 
</P>
<P>
A second California toy listed by the research group was the Mickeytown Ice 
Cream Playset, a Disney Toys product distributed by Mattel Inc. of Hawthorne. 
The report said a detachable counter top posed a potential strangulation 
hazard. 
</P>
<P>
Mattel spokesman Glenn Bozarth said the firm would review the product in light 
of the research. "But it wouldn't still be on the market if a single serious 
incident had occurred with this product," Bozarth said from a division office 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The third California product was "Snoopy plush toy in tuxedo," distributed by a 
firm identified as Applause of Hawthorne. Public Interest Research Groups said 
the stuffed animal had a detachable bow tie and no age labeling. 
</P>
<P>
Other products and distributors cited by the organization included Spring N' 
Bounce cars, YDC of York, Pa.; Jeep Jr. 4x4, Kransco, San Francisco; Scoot 
Along Miss, Empire of Carolina Inc.; wooden cars, CE Ets R. Lorge of France; 
Nashco Train Puzzle, Airplane Puzzle and Farm Puzzle, Nashco Products Inc., 
Scranton, Pa.

Also, Siamese Stuffed Cat, Gund Inc., Edson, N.J.; Unique Party Favors -- 4x4 
Jeeps, Unique Industries, Philadelphia; Mini Mite Car Transport, Henry Gordy

IT'S THANKSGIVING, 1990: THE TRADITIONAL, THE TRENDY AND THE ZANY 
</P>

Americans prepared to celebrate the 369th Thanksgiving in festivities ranging 
from parades and religious services to turkey-bowling. 
</P>
<P>
In Plymouth, Mass., where it all began in 1621, descendants of the Pilgrims and 
others will sit down to the traditional dinner, sponsored by the Chamber of 
Commerce, after a costumed Pilgrim's Progress procession from Plymouth Rock. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner for 1,400 at Memorial Hall will require two tons of turkey and four 
seatings. 
</P>
<P>
A Gainesville, Fla., naturalist said that the original Thanksgiving meal was 
one of the first high-fiber, low-cholesterol feasts served in the New World. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Porter, associate curator of the Florida Museum of Natural History, 
pointed out that the European diet to which the Pilgrims were accustomed was 
heavy on meat and scant on vegetables, but that New World plants -- such as 
corn, potatoes, beans, peppers, tomatoes and cranberries -- revolutionized the 
diet of the early settlers. 
</P>
<P>
In Boston, vegetarian dissenters said the American diet is still too 
meat-oriented. They planned a meatless Thanksgiving dinner of tofu "turkey," 
French pasta, butternut squash and Swiss torte. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth annual Adopt-a-Turkey campaign, meanwhile, was busy delivering 17 
homeless, abused and liberated turkeys to the homes of "animal rights" 
advocates in eight states. 
</P>
<P>
Less dignified is the unorthodox use of frozen turkeys as bowling balls in 
Norfolk, Va., and 11 other cities where turkey bowls are scheduled this week. 
</P>
<P>
Three holes are drilled in each turkey so that it can be rolled down the lanes 
in tournaments held to raise money to feed the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Dresner, marketing assistant for Fair Lanes bowling centers, said that 
Norfolk was the only city where bowlers can face pins painted with the likeness 
of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to have some fun with this," Dresner said. 
</P>
<P>
On a more traditional level, major Thanksgiving Day parades were planned in New 
York City and Houston. The New York parade, sponsored by Macy's department 
store, will feature the usual giant balloon comic characters and something new 
called a "falloon," described as a float and balloon combined.

FBI INVESTIGATES BORDER PATROL AGENT'S SHOOTING OF BOY; 
</P>

IMMIGRATION: MEXICAN OFFICIALS SAY THE YOUTH WAS ON A BORDER FENCE WHEN HIT. HE 
IS AT LEAST THE FIFTH ALIEN WOUNDED BY U.S. AUTHORITIES THIS YEAR NEAR THE 
CROSSING.

<P>
The FBI is investigating the shooting by a U.S. Border Patrol agent of a 
15-year-old Mexican youth who Mexican authorities say was halfway across a 
border fence when he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred early Sunday morning about a block and a half east of the 
international port of entry at Calexico, along the border of Mexico and 
Imperial County. 
</P>
<P>
"Half of his body was in the United States and half was in Mexico," said Marco 
Antonio Tovar, the Mexican consul in Calexico. "This is a very unfortunate 
incident, and we have asked for a full and exhaustive investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Orrantia, an FBI spokesman in San Diego, confirmed the investigation 
Wednesday but declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, identified as Eduardo Garcia Zamores of Mexicali, apparently fell on 
the Mexicali side of the border and was transported to a hospital there, where 
he was in critical condition with bullet wounds in his liver, stomach and right 
lung, Tovar said. 
</P>
<P>
The Border Patrol has declined to release details of the shooting, offer a 
motive or name the agent who fired at the youth. The agent has, however, been 
temporarily reassigned to desk duties, pending the outcome of investigations by 
the FBI, Calexico police and Baja California State Judicial Police, according 
to Manuel Cazares, deputy chief Border Patrol agent in El Centro. 
</P>
<P>
The youth is at least the fifth foreign national shot by U.S. Border Patrol 
agents along the California-Mexico border this year. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI also is investigating a Sept. 8 shooting in San Diego, in which three 
witnesses told Mexican authorities in sworn statements that a Border Patrol 
agent dragged 17-year-old Victor Adrian Mandujano from the border fence and 
shot him in the heart, killing him. His family in Mexico has filed a 
$30-million wrongful-death claim against the Border Patrol. Border Patrol 
officials in San Diego said the agent shot in self-defense after the suspect 
attacked him and grabbed his gun. 
</P>
<P>
Almost six months after a U.S. Border Patrol agent fired his revolver into a 
van loaded with undocumented immigrants, federal prosecutors are still 
reviewing that case to determine whether the officer violated the civil rights 
of two passengers who were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still an open matter," said Obern Rainey, a spokeswoman in Washington for 
the civil rights division of the U.S. Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Ricardo Carbajal, a 16-year-old Mexican who was shot twice in the 
head during the incident, has filed a $1-million civil claim against the Border 
Patrol, contending the agent acted "negligently and carelessly," said his 
lawyer, Michael D. Padilla of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred along the eastern shoulder of the northbound lanes of 
Interstate 5 in Chula Vista, about six miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border.

PHILLIP LANDRUM; LABOR REFORM BILL BEARS HIS NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phillip Landrum, 83, who served as Georgia's 9th District congressman for 12 
terms and who was a principal sponsor of the Landrum-Griffin Labor Reform Bill 
of 1959. Elected to Congress in 1952, Landrum and Rep. Robert P. Griffin of 
Michigan designed their legislation as a bill of rights for union employees. 
</P>
<P>
The law, which gave the government greater control over union affairs, was 
considered essential to weeding out corruption from the union hierarchy and 
came about as a result of the Jimmy Hoffa hearings. Landrum, a Democrat, also 
was instrumental in the passage of several key education bills, including the 
Library Services Act and the Vocational Educational Act. He left Congress in 
1977. Prior to running for the House, Landrum was an assistant attorney general 
in his native state. On Monday in Jasper, Ga., of complications from a stroke.

LEE CASTLE; BIG-BAND TRUMPETER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lee Castle, a trumpeter in the jazz tradition of Louis Armstrong and Bunny 
Berigan and who was featured in many of the great bands of the 1930s and '40s, 
has died in a Florida hospital, it was learned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Memorial Hospital in Hollywood, Fla., said Castle -- most 
recently leader of the Jimmy Dorsey band -- was 75 when he died Friday 
following a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Born Aniello Castaldo in New York, he began playing professionally at age 15 
and by the mid-1930s was performing with Artie Shaw and then Ray McKinley. 
</P>
<P>
He joined the Tommy Dorsey band in 1939, just as Frank Sinatra was being hired 
as lead male vocalist, and three years later became Benny Goodman's ace jazz 
trumpeter. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his career he was known for his full tone, extensive range and the 
ability to play both in the New Orleans tradition of Armstrong and the sweet, 
ballroom manner of Harry James. 
</P>
<P>
He briefly led the combined Dorsey brothers bands after they merged in 1953 and 
following the death of Jimmy Dorsey in 1957, Castle fronted that "ghost band." 
</P>
<P>
He also led two bands of his own in the early 1940s but achieved his greatest 
successes under other leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Virginia, of Elmsford, N.Y., three brothers and two 
sisters.

THE MILKEN SENTENCING;

<P>
EASY CREDIT, EMPTY DEALS FROM A MISBEGOTTEN DECADE

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Milken's 10-year prison sentence reflects, among other things, public 
anger at the deal makers of the 1980s who enriched themselves and left others, 
including the taxpayers, holding the bag. 
</P>
<P>
But anger without understanding avails us nothing. The question we should ask 
is: What have we learned from Milken? 
</P>
<P>
We have learned again that financial genius is before the fall. The Milken 
sentenced Wednesday is the same man who was hailed as the new J. P. Morgan, 
come to remake American business. Like scores of speculative geniuses before 
him, Milken turned out to be a false prophet. Maybe the next time, the public 
will be more skeptical and regulators will act more quickly to protect the 
financial system. 
</P>
<P>
But maybe not. Another lesson we have learned is that credit expansions take on 
a momentum that is hard to stop, simply because so many people benefit from 
easy credit. Milken was not the only juggler in the circus of the '80s. In some 
ways, Pogo's famous line applies: "We have met the enemy and he is us." 
</P>
<P>
We have learned that using borrowed money to build a factory is very different 
from using it for a leveraged buyout. Japan borrowed for factories, the United 
States for deal making -- which is why Japanese firms today are buying U.S. 
companies rather than the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, we have learned that brains and ability without integrity can damage 
our institutions. America is financially weaker today because of the 
distortions of the '80s. And Milken has a lot to answer for, not only for 
illegal acts but for maneuvers that were legal but antisocial. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a misbegotten period," says James Grant, editor of Interest Rate 
Observer, a newsletter that spoke out early on the follies of the debt craze. 
"It was a cosmic lapse in the art of lending, going far beyond a single class 
of loans such as junk bonds." 
</P>
<P>
Milken's influence stemmed from the market he built for high-interest, or junk, 
bonds. Still, the junk bond market at its peak totaled $200 billion, a drop in 
the bucket compared to the $10-trillion total debt in the U.S. economy -- from 
consumer credit to government bonds and all other borrowing. That total debt 
roughly doubled in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
And Milken's influence was magnified by financial go-betweens, called 
investment bankers, because he made millions for them. In one of the first big 
takeovers, Milken's firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert, financed T. Boone Pickens 
Jr.'s raid on Gulf Oil. When Gulf was eventually bought by Chevron, Merrill 
Lynch, Salomon Bros. and Morgan Stanley shared almost $70 million in fees. 
</P>
<P>
Later the business got even better. In the RJR Nabisco deal of 1988, fees paid 
to lawyers, commercial bankers, investment bankers and others may have totaled 
as much as $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"My surprise," says Martin Mayer, author of books on financial markets, "was 
that leading lawyers, investment bankers and accounting firms didn't speak up 
about these risky deals out of responsibility to their profession and to the 
country." They didn't speak up because they were making too much money. 
</P>
<P>
But they spoke up when Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve, tried 
to stop the money. Seeing growing takeovers as "speculative froth," Volcker 
proposed limiting credit by raising margin requirements on stock purchases in 
the fall of 1985. He was shouted down by Wall Street firms, protesting to the 
Reagan Administration. The Fed withdrew its proposed margin increase, and the 
dance went on until the Crash of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Milken still claims, and others proclaim for him, that he helped revitalize 
U.S. business competitiveness. But that's not true. If American business became 
more competitive in the 1980s, it did so under pressure of global competition, 
not junk financing. 
</P>
<P>
What Milken and the decade specialized in was persuading the public that two 
plus two equaled not four but five or even six. Takeover artists could say a 
company was worth more than the market price, and that management should boost 
the stock or a takeover would. Then, using Milken's junk bond financing, they 
would bid up the stock price -- rewarding market speculators -- and buy the 
company, paying off present shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
After that the pattern of normal corporate finance, in which investments are 
made in plants and machines to produce a stream of income from which to pay 
wages and dividends for years into the future, would be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, future cash flow would be brought forward to the present, by forgoing 
new investments and harvesting depreciation on the old. A junk-financed Pacific 
Lumber hurrying the harvest of old-growth redwoods to maximize cash flow is an 
example of the practice. That speeded-up cash flow would then be paid in 
interest to bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
It was a system that rewarded the present but aborted the future. And yet that 
is how a large stretch of America behaved in the 1980s, when U.S. business 
converted $500 billion of equity into debt and legions of experts prattled 
about "maximizing shareholder value." 
</P>
<P>
Japan, too, had a riot of borrowing and speculation in the '80s. Yet somehow 
its corporations used enough of the money for plant and equipment that now they 
outdistance U.S. business in capital investment and research spending every 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Milken understood this. An intense, highly intelligent man, Milken understood 
the competitive decline of the United States. He would reflect in private 
moments that his sons went to a Japanese youngster's house to play Nintendo 
because Japanese Nintendo was more difficult than the version marketed to 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Dumbed-down Nintendo spoke to Milken of a society in decline. Yet he used his 
undoubted brilliance not to make a positive difference for America, but to pile 
up billions of dollars in secret partnerships and deals, over and above his 
well-publicized compensation from Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's offense is not that he got rich but that, like so much of Wall Street 
in the 1980s, he enriched himself at the expense of the society that allowed 
him the very freedom to do so. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Judge Kimba M. Wood a week ago, Milken said he was "truly sorry" 
and asked to be allowed to make recompense through community service. He'll get 
his wish. To her harsh 10-year sentence -- which seems designed to force 
Milken's cooperation with further government investigations -- Wood added three 
years' of probation during which Milken must do community service. He should. 
He owes America a lot -- but then so do we all.

TREASURY MAY LIMIT INSURED ACCOUNTS TO THREE PER CUSTOMER

<P>
The Treasury Department is considering restricting each American to three 
federally insured bank, savings institution or credit union accounts -- no 
matter how little money is in each. 
</P>
<P>
The department asked the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to estimate how much 
the proposal would save and to describe potential problems in administering it, 
FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman said the idea "has some merits and ought to be looked at," but a 
banking trade group, the Independent Bankers Assn. of America, is vigorously 
fighting it. 
</P>
<P>
The group sent an "alert" to its members quoting unidentified "top policy 
officials" as saying a limit on multiple accounts is "the reform concept most 
alive and well in Treasury circles." 
</P>
<P>
"This is not three accounts within an institution -- it is three accounts per 
individual, period," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady reportedly has not decided on the idea 
yet, but it is being advanced by Under Secretary Robert Glauber, the official 
in charge of the Bush Administration's effort to overhaul the financial system. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Treasury official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, stressed 
that limiting the number of accounts was "one of a number of proposals floating 
around" and "we are not in any sense embracing it." 
</P>
<P>
Glauber is directing the preparation of a department study, due next month. The 
study is expected to be the basis of an Administration proposal to Congress 
next year calling for the most sweeping overhaul of the financial system since 
the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
Economists have cited the broad coverage of deposit insurance as one of the 
causes of the savings and loan debacle. Shaky institutions have no trouble 
attracting deposits because the accounts are federally guaranteed, they argue. 
</P>
<P>
Brady in July said the Administration was disturbed by rules that permit 
depositors to protect far more than the $100,000 insurance limit, either by 
spreading their money among institutions or by dividing their money among 
individual, joint and trust accounts at a single institution. 
</P>
<P>
However, the trade group's letter was the first indication that the 
Administration is considering imposing restrictions that would affect millions 
of Americans with much less than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Many Americans maintain far more than three accounts. For instance, a depositor 
with six accounts -- $1,000 in checking, $5,000 in savings, $2,000 in a credit 
union, $10,000 in an IRA retirement fund, and two $1,000 certificates of 
deposit -- would be allowed to designate only three of them as insured, even 
though the total -- $20,000 -- is far below the $100,000 limit. 
</P>
<P>
"I think tens of millions of people would be adversely affected and their 
financial life rendered more uncertain at just the wrong time," said Kenneth 
Guenther, executive vice president of the independent bankers group, which 
represents smaller, community banks. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of CDs (certificates of deposit) would wind up not being insured. That 
would drive funds from community financial institutions to too-big-to-fail 
banks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Seidman said most small depositors likely would consolidate their 
accounts so that all of their money was guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is much more likely to cut back on the guy who has quite a bit more 
money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The senior Treasury official said the definition of an account, for insurance 
purposes, could be changed so that savers could combine all of their 
certificates of deposit into one savings account with varying maturities. 
</P>
<P>
An option previously discussed by policy-makers was limiting coverage to 
$100,000 per person. But because people withdraw and deposit funds frequently, 
that would be more difficult to administer than a flat limit on the number of 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Guenther's group has been lobbying against any cutback in deposit insurance. It 
argues that large banks, which regulators believe must be kept from failing to 
protect the financial system, would have an advantage in attracting deposits 
over smaller institutions whose failure would not threaten the system. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to kill the three-account proposal, the trade group on Wednesday 
sent its members 250,000 protest postcards, to be filled out by bank customers 
and mailed to President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope by Monday there will be 100,000 postcards at the White House," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., S&amp;L analyst who favors privatizing deposit 
insurance, said limiting the number of accounts would accomplish little unless 
the government also finds a way to allow large banks to fail without 
endangering the financial system. 
</P>
<P>
And any proposal that affects the insurance of small depositors likely would 
create a political firestorm, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it will fly. You will hear a howl like you wouldn't believe," he 
said.

THE MILKEN SENTENCING; 
</P>
<P>
MILKEN MUST NOW HELP PROSECUTORS NAIL EX-FRIENDS

<P>
For many former clients and colleagues of Michael Milken, unease may overshadow 
Thanksgiving dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The harsh sentence imposed Wednesday puts him under intense pressure to 
cooperate fully with the government in hopes of getting his prison term 
reduced. In any event, the terms of his plea agreement require him now to begin 
telling prosecutors everything he knows. When the former Drexel Burnham Lambert 
junk bond king signed the agreement last April, he committed himself to "fully 
and truthfully disclose all information with respect to Drexel-related 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
If he doesn't fully answer all the questions put to him, the agreement can be 
revoked. At least theoretically he could be indicted on scores of additional 
charges, possibly including perjury. 
</P>
<P>
High on the prosecutors' shopping list is information about some of the 
notorious corporate raiders of the 1980s, hose exploits were backed by Drexel 
Burnham Lambert junk bonds. Sources say prosecutors and Securities and Exchange 
Commission lawyers also are eager to grill him about some of Drexel's biggest 
buyers of junk bonds. Among them are publicly identified targets of criminal 
investigations, such as Thomas Spiegel, the former chief executive of Beverly 
Hills-based Columbia Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia was one of Drexel's biggest buyers of junk bonds. It is has confirmed 
that it will probably be taken over soon by federal regulators, due mainly to 
enormous losses on those bonds. Robert G. Morvillo, Spiegel's lawyer, said: "We 
hope that Milken tells the truth, and we are convinced that if he does tell the 
truth, it will indicate that Mr. Spiegel is guilty of no wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators also have had a longstanding interest in Fred Carr, chairman of 
the Los Angeles-based insurance holding company First Executive Corp., who also 
was one of Milken's best customers. It is unclear whether investigators 
currently have any firm evidence of illegal conduct by Carr or the company. 
Although First Executive has acknowledged in public filings that it is the 
subject of investigations, Carr has long maintained that neither he nor the 
company did anything illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are eager, too, to talk to Milken about former Drexel executives 
and about a range of ex-clients such as Patsy Ostrander, once a portfolio 
manager for mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments. Ostrander resigned after 
Fidelity learned that she had been allowed to invest personally in a highly 
profitable Drexel partnership at the same time she was making decisions to buy 
Drexel junk bonds for her funds. 
</P>
<P>
The House subcommittee on oversight and investigations is chomping at the bit 
to get Milken to testify publicly about the scores of lucrative private 
partnerships he controlled. 
</P>
<P>
How much all of these investigators will get from him, however, remains to be 
seen. Unlike others caught up in the premier financial scandal of the 1980s, 
such as inside traders Ivan F. Boesky and Dennis B. Levine, Milken refused to 
cooperate until after his sentencing. Confidants said he didn't want to appear 
to offer up his friends in exchange for a lenient sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Milken undoubtedly will want to get his sentence reduced -- a possibility that 
U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood left open if the government reports back to 
her that he has cooperated fully. But former colleagues say Milken may believe 
that he has no incriminating information on anyone. He is also known to be 
intensely loyal to former co-workers and clients. Milken's spokesman declined 
to comment. His lawyers have said in earlier court appearances that he will 
live up to his promise to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
Even if he does know damning secrets, other strong pressures may make him 
reluctant to share them. He faces scores of civil suits that, if successful, 
could wipe out even a fortune as large as his is believed to be. Any testimony 
he gives can be used against him in the lawsuits. Lawyers say the few times he 
has testified before, such as in depositions, he seemed exceptionally adroit at 
evasive answers. But a former colleague said: "I don't know if he can get away 
with that now." 
</P>
<P>
Jeremiah O'Sullivan, a lawyer for Ostrander, declined to comment about the 
possibility of Milken testifying against her. Ostrander herself couldn't be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A number of other defense lawyers also asserted that their clients have nothing 
to fear from Milken. William Hundley, lawyer for Drexel's former head junk bond 
trader, Warren Trepp, said: "The truth from Michael Milken will not cause 
Warren Trepp any problems." 
</P>
<P>
Trepp and several other Drexel employees had been expected to be named in a new 
indictment of Milken that was preempted when Milken agreed to plead guilty. In 
addition, former Drexel trader Bruce Newberg, named in the original indictment 
of Milken, is still under indictment. Newberg's lawyer, Fred Hafetz, said he 
doesn't know if prosecutors are eager to talk to Milken about Newberg. 
</P>
<P>
During Milken's pre-sentencing hearings in October, prosecutors surprised some 
defense lawyers by saying in open court that they may want to bring a case 
against Milken's closest professional aide, Lorraine Spurge, who formerly 
headed Drexel's high-yield syndication department. Spurge had testified before 
a grand jury under a grant of partial immunity. Lawyers earlier had said they 
thought that arrangement meant it was unlikely she would be prosecuted. Andrew 
Lawler, her attorney, said he didn't believe that anything Milken could say 
would hurt her.

Van Nuys Firm Loses Big Award: A jury that ordered General Electric Co. to pay 
$70.8 million to a tiny Van Nuys firm was overruled by a Superior Court judge, 
who slashed the award to $9.8 million. The firm, American Aviation Industries, 
is now effectively in the hole because the jury in July also had ordered AAI to 
repay GE about $14 million, and that part of the case was upheld by Judge 
Stephen D. Petersen, said Bert Cooper, a lawyer for GE. The companies sued each 
other over a failed venture in which they planned to retrofit Lockheed 
corporate jets with GE-made engines.

LOWELL'S ROLE LIKELY TO REMAIN A MYSTERY

<P>
One brother's prison sentence means that another brother will go free. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Milken's guilty plea to six felony counts last April was clinched when 
the government agreed to drop all charges against his brother, Lowell, and give 
him immunity from further prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell, 41, watched along with other family members Wednesday as his brother 
was sentenced to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell was a key aide to his older brother in Drexel Burnham Lambert's junk 
bond headquarters in Beverly Hills. The fact that now he will never be tried on 
the criminal charges brought against him in a March, 1989, indictment leaves 
unanswered many questions about the government's case against him. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of criminal wrongdoing now will never be tested. But witnesses 
in Michael Milken's pre-sentencing hearings in October testified that Lowell 
was centrally involved in major decisions in the junk bond department and had 
at least some involvement in Drexel transactions that prosecutors alleged 
involved criminal wrongdoing. The testimony portrayed Lowell as playing a far 
more influential role in the department than the bit part long ascribed to him 
by his defense lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Some criminal law experts have written articles condemning Michael's deal with 
the government, asserting that the government shouldn't have given Lowell away 
as a bargaining chip if prosecutors really did have evidence that he broke the 
law. Alternatively, they said, if the purpose of indicting him was only to use 
him as leverage against his brother, then he never should have been charged. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell's lawyer, Michael Armstrong, continues to argue that Lowell "was a 
completely innocent hostage who was taken for the purpose of putting pressure 
on his brother." 
</P>
<P>
At least three witnesses in the pre-sentencing hearing, however, testified 
extensively about Lowell's authority in the department and stated that the 
brothers frequently conferred on major transactions. Craig Cogut, a lawyer who 
worked for the Milkens and Drexel, testified that Lowell supervised the scores 
of private partnerships set up by the Milkens to benefit themselves and other 
Drexel employees. 
</P>
<P>
Cogut said Lowell was also a "trouble shooter" who had direct contact with 
major Drexel clients when problems arose. And Cogut said that, when he was 
assigned to help structure securities that Drexel was issuing in the buyout of 
Storer Communications in 1985, he was supervised by Lowell. 
</P>
<P>
The Storer deal -- at the time the largest leveraged buyout ever -- was one of 
the transactions in which prosecutors alleged criminal wrongdoing by Michael 
Milken. In the pre-sentencing hearings, they charged that Milken improperly and 
secretly kept extremely valuable Storer warrants for a partnership he 
controlled. They also charged that Milken used the warrants as de facto 
personal bribes to investment fund managers and corporate executives to reward 
them for having their companies buy other, much riskier Drexel securities. 
</P>
<P>
Cogut also testified that Lowell at times appeared to give his brother 
directions. Cogut said he overheard a conversation between the brothers during 
the Storer deal on Drexel-underwritten preferred stock that was proving 
difficult to sell. "Lowell indicated that Michael had better get involved in 
selling the preferred stock or we would be (holding) a whole lot of preferred," 
Cogut said. 
</P>
<P>
Cogut strongly implied that Lowell had misled him on how the warrants were 
being used and claimed that Lowell had become "testy" when Cogut suggested that 
the distribution of the warrants should have been publicly disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Cogut and Lowell had both been attorneys at the Los Angeles law firm of Irell 
&amp; Manella before joining Michael Milken at Drexel. Cogut testified that he 
had had extreme confidence in Lowell's judgment and honesty. But when asked 
during the hearings if he still had the same level of trust, Cogut said: 
"Obviously, there have been a lot of events that have unfolded and it has been 
unfortunate, and I have questions, obviously." 
</P>
<P>
James Dahl, a former top Drexel bond salesman, testified that Lowell had 
directly contacted Thomas Spiegel -- chief executive of one of Drexel's top 
junk bond buyers, Beverly Hills-based Columbia Savings &amp; Loan -- about 
buying Storer securities. Spiegel is the target of a federal criminal 
investigation concerning, among other things, his involvement with Drexel. 
Evidence in the hearings suggested that Spiegel had directed Columbia to buy 
risky Storer preferred stock from Drexel at the same time that he was allowed 
to buy the valuable warrants. 
</P>
<P>
Terren Peizer, another former junk bond department executive, testified that 
Michael had directed him to go to Lowell for an explanation of a secret list of 
transactions between Drexel and David Solomon of Solomon Asset Management. 
Milken's dealings with Solomon, in which prices of securities sold to Solomon's 
fund were inflated to the detriment of Solomon's investors, was the basis for 
one count of Michael's guilty plea.

STILL NO DEAL AS MCA TALKS BREAK FOR THE HOLIDAY

<P>
Talks between Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and MCA Inc. continued late 
Wednesday night without an agreement under which the Japanese electronics giant 
would buy MCA. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides remain separated by what one individual close to the discussions 
characterized as a "narrow" price differential. 
</P>
<P>
Market sources put the differential as low as $5 per share, and one of them 
said Matsushita was willing to pay as much as $70 a share, while MCA was 
demanding at least $75. 
</P>
<P>
People familiar with the talks previously had said any deal was likely to pay 
MCA stockholders between $75 and $85 a share, or as much as $7.79 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for both companies declined to comment on the negotiations, which 
have taken place largely in the Manhattan law offices of Simpson, Thacher &amp; 
Bartlett, the firm that represents Matsushita. 
</P>

At about 5:30 p.m. EST, MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman and his top lieutenants 
left the session, which several individuals said would be adjourned at that 
point until Saturday or later. But Creative Artists Agency chief Michael Ovitz, 
who is serving as a consultant to Matsushita, remained in discussions with 
lawyers from both sides, and Wasserman was summoned back to the talks late 
Wednesday. It wasn't clear how the talks ended or when they would resume. 
</P>
<P>
In the past week, individuals familiar with the talks have speculated that an 
agreement could come as early as this weekend.

'BEAST OF THE '80S' DESERVES COMPASSION 
</P>

<P>
Despite what you may be reading, Michael Milken is not a bloodless monster who 
set out to pillage the world and drown it in a sea of debt. He's a very smart, 
very driven and very flawed human being whose life -- and whose life's work -- 
has been completely destroyed. Anyone who doesn't feel at least a tinge of 
compassion for the man doesn't have an ounce of compassion in his body. 
</P>
<P>
Milken isn't a symbol of the 1980s, whatever that means. He's just a guy who 
was in the right place at the right time -- he started dealing in junk bonds 
when bargains were lying around like truffles on the forest floor -- who took a 
good idea much too far. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was that the rewards of owning junk bonds more than outweighed the 
risks of the borrowers going belly up. Milken took it too far by insisting that 
junk bonds -- securities that carry high risks and high interest rates -- were 
suitable for everyone. Which, in fact, they aren't, as the current crash in the 
junk market -- or in what remains of the junk market -- shows. 
</P>
<P>
Milken was obsessed with getting more and more people to accept the Gospel of 
Junk, and he almost single-handedly turned junk from a backwater of finance 
into a mainstream investment. Making junk mainstream is what did Milken in -- 
and ultimately what did in the junk bond market. 
</P>
<P>
When the junk market was small and had few players, people had no one to deal 
with but Milken, and he could keep weak borrowers out of the market. Once other 
brokerage houses decided to go after the junk business, Milken's competitive 
juices -- and his obsession with controlling every aspect of everything in his 
life -- compelled him to do whatever sleazy things it took to nail down 
business. 
</P>
<P>
If junk had stayed a backwater -- and if either the enforcers at the Securities 
and Exchange Commission or Milken's alleged superiors at Drexel Burnham Lambert 
reined Milken in -- he wouldn't be going to jail. 
</P>
<P>
But the SEC didn't go after Milken until a trail of stool pigeons fingered Ivan 
F. Boesky, who fingered Milken. And instead of supervising Milken, top Drexel 
officials averted their eyes to avoid seeing his sin. In fact, Drexel let 
Milken move the entire junk department from New York City to his native 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's department was making so much money that Drexel Chairman Frederick H. 
Joseph let Milken do whatever he wanted because Joseph needed the 
Milken-generated profits to turn Drexel into a mainline brokerage house. 
</P>
<P>
To understand Milken, you have to understand that when he wandered into the 
world of junk bonds at a third-rate Philadelphia brokerage house in the 1970s, 
the junk market consisted of a handful of canny investors who spent their days 
searching through the rubble of financially distressed companies searching for 
securities that were better than they looked. 
</P>
<P>
Because Milken is very smart, has a good head for numbers and could work 
incredible hours, he found more of these little jewels than anyone else did. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, he persuaded his bosses to give him enough money to keep an inventory of 
junk around. This meant that when early "junkmeisters" -- Saul P. Steinberg of 
Reliance Insurance, Laurence A. Tisch of Loews, Carl Lindner of Penn Central 
and American Financial, to name a few -- wanted to buy or sell junk, they had 
to deal with Milken. 
</P>
<P>
But as the market for junk grew larger -- mainly because of what Michael was 
doing -- Milken wanted to keep all the business. To do that, he financed deals 
that he knew he should never have touched, and he went so far as to offer 
secret goodies to people who had money to invest in junk. That way, he bound 
these people to him. 
</P>
<P>
When the market was small, no one knew or cared what Milken was doing. When it 
got big -- and when he began raising money for a band of corporate brigands to 
take over mainline U.S. companies like Gulf Oil and Union Carbide -- that was a 
different game. He was used to operating without anyone knowing what he was 
doing, and he didn't understand that the rules had changed, and he had to clean 
up his act. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, being a complicated guy, has conflicting tendencies. On the one hand, 
he lives very modestly and always talks about how important it is not to take 
on airs. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he felt himself smarter than anybody, and thought he could 
indefinitely get away with sleazy things. Such as telling bond issuers that 
bond buyers wanted cheap stock as a "sweetener," then keeping the stock for 
himself and a handful of associates. 
</P>
<P>
During 1987, 1988 and 1989, I spent many hours with Milken, whom I came to 
consider a friend. He was brilliant, but he had no sense of humor and no sense 
of how other people perceived him. He didn't blame himself for his problems, he 
blamed the news media. And probably still does. 
</P>
<P>
Milken has lost almost everything that he holds dear. He used to pride himself 
on being a quiet donor of huge amounts to charity and of working, unheralded, 
with disadvantaged children. But he decided to let his public relations people 
turn charity into a PR show. 
</P>
<P>
He used to pride himself on having established the junk bond market. But that 
market is gone, and many of his most important junk clients -- Columbia Savings 
&amp; Loan of Beverly Hills, First Executive Corp. of Los Angeles -- are busto, 
and many others, such as Lindner and Steinberg -- seem to be in big trouble. 
</P>
<P>
He prided himself on his staff's loyalty to him -- but many of them turned 
state's evidence. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Milken broke down and cried several times Wednesday, it was far too 
late for him to be considered a human being. He was sentenced as the Beast of 
the '80s, but he will suffer as a man. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Milken still has a vast fortune. But his life and work are in ruins, and 
he will spend who knows how many years in the slammer while his kids grow up 
and leave home. Even though he brought it on himself, watching how this man has 
destroyed himself is enough to make me want to cry.

Matsushita to Buy U.S. Chip Plant: National Semiconductor Corp. said it had 
signed a letter of intent to sell its Puyallup, Wash., chip making plant to 
Matsushita Electronics Corp. for $86 million plus debt. National, of Santa 
Clara, Calif., said the sale would allow it to trim excess production capacity 
created by its decision in August to exit the market for ultrafast computer 
memory chips known as SRAMs. 
</P>
<P>
The struggling chip maker, which lost $165.5 million in the first quarter ended 
Aug. 26, said it expected the sale to close by March, pending national security 
and antitrust reviews. The sale would give Matsushita, a unit of the Japanese 
electronics giant of the same name, its first such plant in the United States.

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: STANDARDS TO SET COMMON GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What a difference a year makes. Personal computing has undergone fundamental 
change, which was apparent at this year's Comdex trade show in Las Vegas, where 
hardware and software manufacturers competed for the attention of dealers and 
writers. 
</P>
<P>
At long last in the IBM-compatible arena of computing we have some real 
standards that define the common level of hardware and software that 
business-oriented and many home computer systems will have. 
</P>
<P>
They will be high-performance computers using the Intel 80386 microprocessor in 
either its low-cost SX variant or higher-cost DX option, equipped with at least 
1 megabyte of RAM operating memory -- and probably more -- a hard disk drive 
and a color VGA monitor. 
</P>
<P>
These computers will use the DOS operating system, along with Microsoft's 
Windows 3.0 graphical user interface software and various software programs 
that run with Windows. 
</P>
<P>
Less powerfully equipped computers will continue to be popular among the 
budget-conscious, of course, but the 386 color system with Windows has become 
the machine of choice because it enables a much easier and richer level of 
computing than DOS computer users have been used to. 
</P>
<P>
Last year at Comdex, Windows 3.0 was just a rumor, 386-based computers were 
still too expensive -- as was VGA color -- and OS/2, not DOS, was being touted 
as the PC operating system of the future. 
</P>
<P>
What changed? 
</P>
<P>
For one, prices of 386SX-based computers fell to the former levels of 80286 
machines. For another, prices of color VGA board and monitor combinations fell 
to little more than we once paid for green-screen monochrome systems. 
</P>
<P>
And Windows 3.0 was such an improvement over previous versions that software 
developers started focusing on programs for Windows instead of programs for 
OS/2. 
</P>
<P>
Uncertainty arising from the internal construction of these computers appears 
to have been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, there was an acrimonious debate between IBM and Compaq engineers 
over which one of their internal system designs was best -- microchannel 
architecture (MCA) at IBM or extended industry standard architecture (EISA) at 
Compaq. 
</P>
<P>
Guess what? Both are alive and doing quite well this year. Many manufacturers 
have followed Compaq's lead, offering their own EISA high-performance 
computers. Despite this, IBM's proprietary-design MCA machines are selling 
well. The most sales of all are still enjoyed by an older design, ISA -- or 
industry standard architecture -- that originated with the IBM PC/AT. Clearly, 
all three designs will continue to coexist in the marketplace (and in the 
office) with little problem. 
</P>
<P>
Another significant change was the way that more than a dozen manufacturers 
introduced so-called notebook-sized computers that were more alike than 
different. Portables have always been the least-standardized personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
The new notebook designs all use 386 chips, mostly the SX version; black and 
white VGA screens able to display 16 or 32 shades of gray; internal hard disks 
of at least 20-megabyte capacity and often 40 megabytes; a 3.5-inch floppy 
drive for 1.44-megabyte diskettes, and an internal modem. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested retail prices ranged from $2,995 for an AST model to Compaq's $6,499. 
Weights were in the six- to seven-pound range and listed battery life was 
typically about three hours. Most were black or dark gray. 
</P>
<P>
Keyboard layouts differed, as did screen contrasts and placement of drives and 
output ports, so buyers will want to shop carefully. 
</P>
<P>
There were also a couple of AC-powered, laptop portable color computers with 
brilliant VGA screens using an active matrix technology that is quite 
expensive. Toshiba showed a $9,000 model with a 286 microprocessor, while Sharp 
had a 386 color portable that probably will be priced at $12,000 to $13,000. It 
will be a long time before many of us have one of these on our desks because 
the cost of making color liquid crystal display screens is unlikely to fall 
very fast. 
</P>
<P>
Something else that remains expensive and thus not in wide use are optical disk 
drives that can re-record data again and again. 
</P>
<P>
In the software arena, William H. Gates III, the youthful founder and chairman 
of Microsoft, delivered the keynote address built around an elaborately 
produced video spoof of the "Twin Peaks" television show. His theme, 
"information at your fingertips," portrayed a world in which computer users 
need be concerned only with the words and numbers and images they want to 
appear in their documents, not the programs needed to put them there. 
</P>
<P>
Gates predicted that such software technology will be available during the 
1990s. But you can already buy software that achieves much of that goal for 
only $200. 
</P>
<P>
It is called New Wave, is published by Hewlett-Packard and runs with Windows 
3.0. 
</P>
<P>
For only $10, you can buy your own videotape of Gates' 45-minute Comdex 
presentation by calling Microsoft at (800) 541-1261. Tip: Watch what the little 
kid with glasses does with his glasses and watch what Gates does with his. It's 
nice to see a billionaire with a sense of humor, however subtle. 
</P>
<P>
For me, the hit of the show was neither PC- nor Mac-related. It was Video 
Toaster, a $1,595 board and companion software that turns an Amiga computer 
into a broadcast-quality video production machine with real-time image 
processing. I'll have more about it in a future column.

HONDA PAYS U.S. WORKERS $1,712 BONUS 
</P>

<P>
Honda of America Manufacturing Inc. said Wednesday that employees at its 
assembly and engine plants in Ohio received an average of $1,712 per worker in 
profit-sharing checks, up slightly from year-ago payouts. 
</P>
<P>
The payments last week to Honda's 9,400 "associates" -- which include non-union 
workers as well as management -- is expected to be the highest in the industry, 
given the dismal financial performance posted so far this year by the nation's 
Big Three auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
Those results -- which include a $2.1-billion loss for the third quarter alone 
-- will most likely result in no profit sharing this year for unionized workers 
at General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Honda's latest profit sharing, based on fiscal 1990 earnings, is based on three 
numbers: worldwide net income before taxes, the number of employees worldwide 
and the number of employees at Honda of America, said Jeff Leestma, a spokesman 
for Honda North America in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"That formula is the same for everyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Payouts by GM, Ford and Chrysler are done under a complicated formula 
negotiated by the United Auto Workers union for its members and are based on 
U.S. automotive profits alone. 
</P>
<P>
Among traditional U.S. car makers, Ford workers have reaped the most in profit 
sharing checks, with the typical payout averaging a record $3,700 per worker 
for 1987. But that figure slipped to $2,800 for 1988 and to $1,025 for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
GM workers received no profit sharing checks in 1987, with minimal payouts for 
1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
While there is little probability that Big Three workers will stand to get any 
profit sharing for 1990, the UAW renegotiated in its latest contracts a new 
formula that could increase any potential payout. 
</P>
<P>
A UAW spokesman defended the union's payouts.

4 PR FIRMS FALL FOR PRANK TO MARKET BUNNY BURGERS

The hoppin' good low cholesterol food of the '90s -- Bunny Burgers, made with 
rabbit meat -- was merely a wascally pwank by those guys at Spy magazine, who 
persuaded four public relations firms to promote it. 
</P>
<P>
The cottontail con was conceived for "Spy TV Pranks," a pilot for a potential 
weekly program. 
</P>
<P>
PR firms were contacted for advice on the right way to market Bunny Burgers, a 
rabbit patty garnished with carrots, said Spy features editor Bruce Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
The phony fast-food joint also offered Hareballs -- a sort of rabbit McNuggets 
-- along with carrot fries and milkshakes. 
</P>
<P>
"We came up with a product that was pretty far-fetched," said Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
Not far-fetched enough. Four firms offered real advice on pitching the 
"low-sodium, low-cholesterol fast-food of the '90s," said Spy show producer 
David Kaminsky. Among other things, Bunny Burgers was advised to drop the 
Hareball idea. 
</P>
<P>
The PR firms were later told of the scam and were paid for their time and 
advice. Spy agreed not to reveal which companies were involved. 
</P>
<P>
One firm, Fleishman Hillard, did not go for the hare-raising meal, according to 
the New York Post. 
</P>
<P>
The company considered showing up with a presentation for "Double Bugs," 
"Double Bugs with Cheese" and "Thumper Cajun Style" sandwiches, the Post 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Bunny Burgers smelled fishy, and besides, we had a conflict with our 
Puppy-on-a-Stick (account)," company Vice President Jan Van Meet told the Post.

'TOUCH-TONE' CHARGES TO END; SOME PHONE RATES MAY RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday allowed phone companies 
in the state to eliminate the itemized charge for touch-tone dialing service, 
beginning next February. 
</P>
<P>
However, consumer advocates immediately cautioned customers against concluding 
that touch-tone service -- which allows easier access into electronic phone 
mail and other telephone information services -- would be free. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, General Telephone customers may see their local phone service charges 
increase as much as 5% in February. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the $1 to $1.25 that phone companies operating in the state charge 
customers each month for touch-tone service. 
</P>
<P>
Under Wednesday's PUC order, touch-tone service will be included in charges for 
basic monthly phone service and will no longer be separately billed. However, 
the order -- noting that the state's phone companies will lose revenue as the 
extra charges are eliminated -- allows the companies to dip into funds 
previously earmarked for consumer rebates. 
</P>
<P>
The net effect? Pacific Bell customers may not notice the changes immediately 
because the two actions could cancel each other out. However, customers of 
General Telephone, which services Southern California residents from Malibu to 
Laguna Beach, are expected to see their local phone service charges increase 
4.74% in February. 
</P>
<P>
"The PUC is letting Pac Bell steal back money that rightfully belongs to 
ratepayers, while claiming the decision results in 'free' touch-tone service. 
We are outraged," said Audrie Krause, executive director of the consumer 
advocate group Toward Utility Rate Normalization (TURN). "General Telephone 
customers will receive higher phone bills."

ANTI-DEVELOPMENT MESSAGE IS CLEAR; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA: VOTERS THWARTED PROJECTS THAT THE CITY HAD SOLICITED. DEVELOPERS 
ARE EXPECTED TO SHY AWAY FROM FUTURE VENTURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The developers have gotten the message. 
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 months, Santa Monica and its residents have pulled the rug out 
from under two high-profile commercial projects in which developers had already 
invested more than $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the developers had been invited by the city to build the 
projects on parcels of public land and were given reason to expect clear 
sailing through the city approval process. 
</P>
<P>
"People will think long and hard before they get involved in attempting 
projects in Santa Monica," said Henry A. Lambert, president of Reliance 
Development Corp., the New York company whose earlier approval for a large 
office complex at Santa Monica Municipal Airport was revoked by the City 
Council early this year. The council reversed its course after residents 
opposed to the project had gathered enough petition signatures to force a 
referendum on the project. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know who is going to step up to the plate, given the city's track 
record of the last few years. It would be suicide," said a source who was 
involved with the second rejected project, restaurateur Michael McCarty's 
proposed $65-million beach hotel. That project's fate was sealed on Election 
Day, when voters strongly supported Proposition Z, thereby repealing tentative 
approval already granted by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-development activists who fought the projects say that bringing 
development to such a screeching halt is exactly what is needed. And, 
exhilarated by their success of the last 10 months, they are turning to what 
they say is the next big fight: a proposed major expansion by the RAND Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The renowned nonprofit research firm, which has been based in Santa Monica 
since its founding in 1946, has tentative plans to nearly triple the size of 
its complex, which is right across from City Hall on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
RAND representatives and city officials have already negotiated extensively, 
because RAND's expansion is regarded as a key component of a master plan for 
the entire Civic Center district, which stretches from Colorado Avenue south to 
Pico Boulevard, and from Ocean Avenue east to 4th Street. In addition to RAND, 
the district encompasses City Hall, a county courthouse and the city's Civic 
Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
The city has set up a citizen advisory group to help prepare the master 
blueprint for development, and some of the advisers are bracing for a fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I told our members that if they thought the McCarty hotel project was a war, 
the controversy over the RAND site will make that look like a street-corner 
brawl," said panel member Merritt Coleman, who says he opposes such a large 
project unless the city can come up with a way to deal with the increase in 
traffic and other impacts. 
</P>
<P>
Several prominent members of the city's slow-growth coalition also made clear 
at a news conference shortly after the election that they expect RAND to be the 
next major battlefront in the development war. 
</P>
<P>
"It is completely inappropriate, without master-planning the whole Civic Center 
area, to even consider what they are proposing," activist and unsuccessful City 
Council candidate Sharon Gilpin said of RAND. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that several large-scale development projects approved by the city have 
not yet been completed, Gilpin said the last thing Santa Monica needs is more 
office space or retail shops such as RAND proposes. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Santa Monica has been a mecca for commercial developers because 
of its receptiveness to big projects and its unbeatable locale -- on the beach 
in the heart of an affluent market, with good freeway access to Los Angeles 
International Airport, downtown Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and Century City. 
</P>
<P>
The prevailing view among city officials was that commercial development, if 
accompanied by stiff development fees, was a fairly painless way to finance the 
city's ambitious array of social service programs. 
</P>
<P>
But no more. If there were any lingering doubts, the election put an end to 
them. The anti-development message contained in the strong votes for 
Proposition S, banning nearly all commercial development on or near the beach, 
and Proposition Z, killing the McCarty hotel, was unmistakable. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Kenneth Genser, an outspoken anti-growth activist, said the passage 
of the two propositions amounted to a direct attack on the "cozy relationship 
between developers and politicians." 
</P>
<P>
About the only form of new development likely to find favor with the 
anti-development coalition, Gilpin said, are projects that will create 
affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
But others say that by putting the brakes on development, voters and 
slow-growth advocates may be inadvertently shutting down the engine that has 
made the city hum. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe this city needs to have a healthy business sector to continue to 
provide the high level of services our citizens demand," said Christine E. 
Reed, a veteran City Council member who lost her bid for reelection, in part 
because of attacks that branded her as being too pro-development. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, reached by telephone while traveling in Europe this week, said that 
commercial, industrial and other business enterprises account for two-thirds of 
the city's revenues. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are being unrealistic," Reed said of those calling for a halt to 
all new projects. "To stop every bit of development, the city will stagnate." 
</P>
<P>
If the city forgoes development revenues, Mayor Dennis Zane said, it will be 
forced to either find new sources of revenue -- presumably by increasing fees 
and taxes -- or cut services. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that we can either do less and spend 
less, or do more, spend more, and figure out where the money will come from," 
said Zane, who in recent years has supported some development projects and 
voted against others. 
</P>
<P>
Gilpin, a leader of the efforts to defeat the airport and hotel projects, said 
the city will get more than enough revenues in upcoming years from the many 
commercial projects that have yet to be finished. 
</P>
<P>
Some developers and political observers interviewed since the Nov. 6 election 
predict that even if the city decides it needs more development revenues, it 
will be years before any developer in his right mind will venture into Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"As a developer, (the election result) tells you not to buy any property in 
that city, which is exactly what they wanted," said Jerome H. Snyder, developer 
of the massive Water Gardens project, a 1.3-million-square-foot commercial 
complex now under construction at Olympic and Cloverfield boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Other developers got the picture as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the city of Santa Monica will have a hard time getting anyone to 
respond for an RFP (request for proposal) on their property," said one 
developer, who requested anonymity. "I don't think anybody out there is buying 
property in Santa Monica and considering going through the City Hall approval 
process." 
</P>
<P>
Some developers and city officials said the city also needs to take a serious 
look at the way it deals with developers, to ensure that Reliance and McCarty 
are the last two developers to feel as if they had been left at the altar by a 
fickle bride. 
</P>
<P>
"I never heard of anything like this before," said Reliance President Lambert. 
"People being asked to submit projects at the request of the City Council over 
a period of years and then have the voters have a metamorphosis and reject the 
result. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent $4.5 million and Mr. McCarty spent more than $3 million pursuing 
projects we were asked to develop by the city," Lambert added. "We were 
financially done a tremendous disservice." 
</P>
<P>
McCarty has refused to comment on the election or his loss. His aides say that 
he is dismayed at not having been forewarned by city officials of the obstacles 
that he encountered. 
</P>
<P>
There are several wild cards in Santa Monica's development future, including 
who the new council will choose as mayor and what the three new members elected 
to the City Council will do. 
</P>
<P>
Although one of the new members, Kelly Olsen, has been an outspoken slow-growth 
advocate, the others -- Robert Holbrook and Tony Vazquez -- managed to avoid 
taking a position on the issue during the election campaign. The new council 
will meet for the first time on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Zane had said earlier that he planned to step down, but this week said he is 
considering seeking a second term. 
</P>
<P>
"Development issues are a central question in my considerations," Zane said. 
"There is a desire to have people with experience in growth-management issues 
in a leadership role." 
</P>
<P>
But in any event, Zane said, the next two years will be "largely a policy 
period," in which city officials will do a lot of thinking about how to 
regulate commercial growth in the future and promote residential growth. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, one of the first things the city Planning Commission did after the 
election was to propose that the moratorium on applications for new commercial 
developments that took effect 18 months ago be extended for another 18 months. 
The City Council, which must approve such a moratorium, has not yet placed the 
proposal on its agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Moratorium or not, Zane and Genser predicted that Santa Monica officials will 
be attempting to assess the impact of the projects they already have approved, 
down-zone some commercial areas to reduce the allowable density and completely 
rezone other commercial areas to permit a mix of residential and other uses. 
</P>
<P>
Zane said the RAND project could epitomize the city's dilemma regarding its 
desire to halt development and its reliance on revenues the developers bring. 
</P>
<P>
Zane, who strongly supported the Reliance airport project but voted against the 
beach hotel, says he opposes RAND's current development proposal. 
</P>
<P>
RAND wants to add 200,000 square feet of office space to its existing 300,000 
square feet, as well as build 300,000 square feet of commercial space and the 
same amount of residential space for 350 rental apartment units. 
</P>
<P>
The RAND project has met with opposition from several fronts, even though the 
current plan already has a smaller commercial component and contains many more 
apartments than RAND had initially envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, who represents the Mid-City Neighbors group on the Civic Center 
Advisory Committee, said the election results have strengthened the resolve of 
those who want RAND to mitigate traffic and environmental impacts, and build 
even more residential housing. 
</P>
<P>
Some have given RAND good marks for cooperation, and RAND has pledged to be as 
receptive as possible, particularly in light of the anti-development sentiment. 
RAND officials stress that the plans are informal until the city releases a 
preliminary environmental impact report in January. 
</P>
<P>
"We continue to believe that the public participation process already under way 
will produce a plan that is sensitive to the needs of both the community and 
RAND," said RAND spokeswoman Iao Katagiri. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some concerns that it may move if it does not get its way, Katagiri 
said RAND wants to stay in Santa Monica. It is an ideal location, she said, and 
many employees have longtime ties to the area. 
</P>
<P>
But Katagiri, also a member of the advisory committee, refused to rule out the 
possibility of a move if its expansion needs cannot be met by Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, in the future we have to look at what our needs are," Katagiri 
said. "Moving is not an option at this point -- we really do believe the city 
wants us to stay and will accommodate our needs while looking out for the city 
as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take a lot of work and a lot of good will," she said, "but I think it 
is possible."

MOTHER STRUGGLES FOR EDUCATION

<TEXT>
<P>
Ask Melinda Nunez about the last four years and she will recount a textbook 
case of teen-age motherhood. 
</P>
<P>
No school. No money. No clue. 
</P>
<P>
Melinda's story began early in ninth grade upon learning that she was pregnant 
with her now-3-year-old daughter, Nina. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a virgin. I never thought I was going to do anything until I got 
married," she recalls. A month after becoming involved with the baby's father, 
she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Three months later she dropped out of junior high after balking at her physical 
education teacher's insistence that she play touch football. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred on by her high school-dropout father, who told her "you gotta break the 
chain," Melinda tried to go back to school after giving birth. 
</P>
<P>
But it's hard to be a good student, she found, on the amount of sleep that a 
mother of a wakeful infant gets. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't perfect because I was up all night," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking infant care, Melinda also tried home study. "There's a pile of books on 
the table and there's the soap operas. What are you going to choose? The soap 
operas." 
</P>
<P>
By her own account, the young mother also tried drugs, losing custody of Nina 
to her great-grandmother when someone told social service workers. 
</P>
<P>
After drug testing, parenting classes with the baby's father, Scott Ueda, and a 
year of proving themselves, Melinda regained custody of Nina, a victory of 
which she is proud. 
</P>
<P>
She unabashedly presents her copy of a social worker's report she was once 
ashamed to 
</P>
<P>
show anyone. "I've proven them wrong," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Time, meanwhile, marched on. Nina has gone from womb to preschool. Scott 
graduated from high school on time and is a student at Santa Monica College. 
But "mommy" is barely out of the ninth grade. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Nina is in preschool three days a week, and with financial help from 
Scott, Melinda is back at Venice High's Phoenix Continuation School, with a 
target graduation date of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"He graduated on time, but he didn't have as much responsibility as I did," 
said Melinda. "He could always say, 'Here's the baby,' " 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most of their peers, Melinda and Scott's relationship has apparently 
survived teen-age parenthood and they plan to marry, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The caption beside a snapshot of "Nina's third Christmas" reveals the family 
history in a few spare statistics: 
</P>
<P>
Nina: 2 years, 6 months 
</P>
<P>
Mommy: 17 years, 8 months 
</P>
<P>
Daddy: 18 years, 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason we're still together is because we're growing up together," Melinda 
said.

HOUR OF DECISION NEAR ON DAYWORKER CENTER; 
</P>
<P>
MALIBU: CRITICS COMPLAIN THAT THE HIRING CENTER VIOLATES ZONING LAWS. THE 
COUNTY HAS ORDERED IT TO CLOSE BY FRIDAY, BUT PROPONENTS HOPE FOR A REPRIEVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rutilo Perez, a dayworker in need of a job, has spent at least part of his 
mornings the last several weeks playing checkers at Malibu's Zuma Beach while 
hoping for work. 
</P>
<P>
He is among dozens of men, mostly from Mexico and Central America, who pass the 
time at checkers and soccer, or by casting bemused glances at the surfers who 
show up like clockwork to battle the early morning waves. 
</P>
<P>
So it goes at Malibu's first-ever hiring center for day laborers, where the 
American Dream and the Third World meet. 
</P>
<P>
For dozens of men who congregate there each day, the center provides a chance 
to land a job that pays $5 an hour without the risk of being arrested by the 
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, which has agreed not to conduct 
raids there. 
</P>
<P>
But in a community where the rich and famous far outnumber the homeless, and 
where even a mobile home can cost $500,000 if it has a view, not everyone is 
happy with the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving complaints from nearby homeowners that the center violates 
county zoning laws, the Department of Regional Planning has ordered that it be 
shut down by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, its private sponsors have asked county officials for a 90-day 
reprieve from the shutdown order while they try to find another location, and 
they say they intend to keep the center open at least until county officials 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to operate the center over the Thanksgiving weekend and hope for 
the best," said Honey Coatsworth, who heads the Artifac Tree, a nonprofit 
thrift shop that is the center's chief sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
A county planning spokesman said that officials will probably decide on whether 
to grant the extension by early next week. Malibu's unofficial City Council is 
on record as supporting an extension, and Councilwoman Carolyn Van Horn said 
Wednesday, after talking with an aide to Supervisor Deane Dana, who represents 
Malibu, that she was optimistic that one will be granted. 
</P>
<P>
The center opened six months ago as an experiment aimed at helping the area's 
day laborers at a time when merchants and others were complaining that some of 
the workers were harassing their customers and passersby while congregating on 
Malibu street corners and in parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 150 day laborers commute to Malibu from Los Angeles each day in 
the hope of finding jobs clearing brush or helping at construction sites in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the workers come on Southern California Rapid Transit District buses, 
getting off in front of the center, which occupies part of a parking lot at the 
east end of Zuma Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Modeled on a similar facility set up last year by Los Angeles in Harbor City, 
the center provides day laborers with English instruction, access to public 
restrooms and a noon meal. Employers seeking workers are asked to register, and 
a minimum wage of $5 is requested although not required. 
</P>
<P>
"It's worked out to be a real blessing for many of these men," said Victor 
Rivera, one of two paid staff members at the site. "They don't have to be 
worried about being arrested. They don't get exploited the way they often do 
working off the street corners. And they have a little dignity here." 
</P>
<P>
But almost from the time it opened, the center has had trouble with its 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Detractors insist that a public beach is no place for an immigrant hiring 
facility, and contend that the center has served as a magnet for men with no 
place else to go who camp overnight in the brush near the center, posing a fire 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
Critics contend that a house trailer used as the center's office, which had 
been donated by a local real estate broker, was placed on the site illegally, 
without a permit from the California Coastal Commission, something the center's 
sponsors do not deny. 
</P>
<P>
"They get an 'A' for effort, but low marks for common sense," said a nearby 
homeowner, of the center's supporters, who spoke on the condition that he not 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, however, the public debate over the center's future has been 
charged with accusations by supporters that its opponents are motivated by 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
That, in turn, has outraged those opposed to the center's location. 
</P>
<P>
"Such accusations serve no useful purpose," said Eileen Kinloch, who is among 
those who wants the center shut down at the Zuma Beach location. "I'm not 
opposed to a dayworker center. But I feel it is in an inappropriate location. 
That doesn't make me or those who feel as I do racists." 
</P>
<P>
She was among about 100 people who signed a petition several weeks ago asking 
that the center be moved from Zuma Beach. 
</P>
<P>
However, there are widespread differences in the community over what should 
happen next. 
</P>
<P>
"There are basically three groups," said attorney Frank Buck, who signed the 
petition. "There are those who want it to stay where it is, those who want it 
moved, and those who don't want to see a day laborer center in Malibu, period." 
</P>
<P>
Although Perez and his companions professed little knowledge about the 
community debate swirling about them, they are not without a contingency plan. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can't come here anymore," said Perez, who sends part of what he makes to 
his wife and six children in the Mexican state of Oaxaca, "then we will have to 
go back to the streets again."

WHEN ALZHEIMER'S IS PART OF HOLIDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The elderly Hollywood man was talking about Thanksgiving at a recent workshop 
on helping families cope with Alzheimer's disease during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"The holidays are great," said the man, 80, who takes care of his 
Alzheimer's-afflicted wife of 51 years. Thanksgiving is not only good for the 
person with the disease, he said, "it's also good for the care-giver because it 
gives them a chance to relax with other people." 
</P>
<P>
The man smiled. And then he burst into tears. 
</P>
<P>
The holidays are often hellish for families dealing with Alzheimer's and other 
conditions that produce dementia or loss of cognitive abilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood man, for instance, was uncertain whether he and his spouse would 
be able to join their son in San Diego for Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
His wife has been suffering from a bladder infection recently, and her 
progressive brain disorder is constantly producing new deficits and 
complications. Since she became ill, the woman is anxious whenever she travels. 
Her husband worried that the unfamiliar pounding of the wheels of the train 
would unnerve her. 
</P>
<P>
It is almost too much to bear, especially alone, the man made clear. When you 
have Alzheimer's in the family, he said before his tears drove him from the 
room in embarrassment, "everybody walks away." 
</P>
<P>
At a recent workshop in Century City, the Los Angeles chapter of the 
Alzheimer's Assn. and the Westside Consortium of Senior Services offered 
Alzheimer's care-givers practical advice and the bitter solace of knowing 
others are suffering, too 
</P>
<P>
"The holidays are often a very joyful time, but they can also be very, very 
difficult," said Lynn Morishita, program director for the Center for Geriatric 
Health at Century City Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The grown-up children of people with Alzheimer's routinely feel cheated, the 
experts said. The children gather around the table, remembering when mom or dad 
successfully stage-managed beloved holiday traditions, and they see only loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Holidays carry a lot of emotional wallop," said Nina Luce, a Santa Monica 
marriage and family counselor who specializes in geriatric issues. "We remember 
how it was, and if we don't get it, we're crushed." 
</P>
<P>
Holidays often precipitate a crisis among siblings, the speakers pointed out. 
Family members who live elsewhere often come home for the holidays only to 
discover that a parent or grandparent is much worse than they had realized from 
long-distance phone calls. Brothers and sisters sometimes blame the sibling who 
does most of the care-giving, who in turn typically feels overburdened. 
</P>
<P>
The experts agreed that a good first step in dealing with Alzheimer's is to 
have a family consultation with a caseworker or someone else with expertise in 
dementia and the medical, emotional and legal problems it creates. The earlier 
the family begins to think about these issues, the better, they said. For 
example, the Jewish Family Service, Santa Monica, is a nonprofit agency that 
provides such services to anyone on a sliding fee scale. 
</P>
<P>
The experts also recommended that the family arrange to have the affected 
individual evaluated at a good geriatric health center. Some of the 
deficiencies associated with Alzheimer's are treatable, they said. For example, 
better diet may help a little. "A lot of older people are living on toast and 
tea," Luce pointed out. A complete evaluation will not only reveal what's wrong 
with the affected person, it will also help the family take full advantage of 
those abilities that remain, Morishita said. 
</P>
<P>
Two sisters at the workshop admitted they dreaded the thought of Thanksgiving. 
They planned to fly to Arizona where they were to have a turkey dinner with 
their father, then visit their mother, 66, who has been institutionalized with 
Alzheimer's for almost a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real depressing," the younger sister said. "They have all these (holiday) 
cards and ads on TV, and they just make you feel worse." 
</P>
<P>
Morishita said such sadness is normal. The person with dementia "is here, but 
they are not the person they were." Their loved ones, she said, "are grieving 
all the time." 
</P>
<P>
One reason the holidays are so difficult is that they underscore the role 
reversal that is one of the most painful aspects of dealing with dementia. 
</P>
<P>
As Joyce Brunelle, who does public relations for the Westside consortium, said, 
"Two things that life never prepares us for are parenting and parenting our own 
parent." Unfortunately, she noted, the intense emotion that Alzheimer's 
triggers in a family often complicates the coping process, which involves 
making difficult decisions about everything from where the patient will live to 
who will control his or her money. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be very practical at this stage," Brunelle said. "You have to be 
very dispassionate about it." 
</P>
<P>
The speakers urged care-givers to give themselves a break over the holidays. 
Less is more, the experts said. Don't try to replicate the lavish holidays of 
the past, but pick a few favorite traditions and concentrate on them. 
Simplified holiday activities are also easier on the person with Alzheimer's, 
who is often unsettled by changes in routine and unusual bustle and clutter. 
</P>
<P>
Start to prepare the affected person for the upcoming holiday well in advance 
by marking the calendar, having daily discussions of what the family will do, 
playing holiday music and, when feasible, making holiday foods. 
</P>
<P>
As Thanksgiving gives way to Hanukkah and Christmas, gifts become a problem. 
</P>
<P>
People with dementia often enjoy videotapes of family members, the experts 
said. And Brunelle noted that some people like to give a donation in the name 
of the person with Alzheimer's to a charity that was especially important to 
him or her before life changed forever. 
</P>
<P>
Occupational therapist Laura Caron-Parker offered these tips for holiday safety 
and stress reduction at the Alzheimer's workshop. 
</P>
<P>
* Remember that a Hannukah menorah and candles on a holiday table are potential 
dangers to the person with Alzheimer's. Put all matches and lighters away after 
using. If you can child-proof your house for the holidays, you can make it safe 
for the person with dementia, Caron-Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
* Use only unbreakable ornaments on the Christmas tree and hang them with 
ribbon, not metal hooks. Remember that such traditional holiday plants as 
poinsetti a, mistletoe and holiday are poisonous if ingested. 
</P>
<P>
* Avoid blinking holiday lights. They seem to increase the confusion and 
agitation of people with dementia. Shiny, reflective wrapping paper that causes 
visual distortions also seems to have this effect and should be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
* Gifts should be kept out of sight until they are exchanged. Left under the 
tree or elsewhere in the open they increase visual clutter. The person with 
Alzheimer's may also open gifts that are left out, whomever they are meant for. 
</P>
<P>
* Limit the number of holiday visitors, prepare them for the changes they will 
see in the affected person and schedule their visits for morning and early 
afternoon when people with dementia are usually at their best.

PARK LABREA REVIEW STALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The management of the Park Labrea apartment complex has received yet another 
postponement for a hearing on its long-pending appeal on a request to pass on 
to tenants the cost of a $3-million fencing and gating project. The request was 
previously denied. 
</P>
<P>
The issue had been scheduled to come up for review on Nov. 16, but is now set 
for March 1, 1991, at 9 a.m., at the Rent Stabilization Division offices on 6th 
Street in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Winegar, general manager of Park Labrea, said that much of the delay is 
due to the need to determine just how much it cost to undertake the early 
phases of the project at a time when May Co. stores were the sole owners of the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rent Stabilization Board wanted not just the amount, but the documentation 
for all of it," he said. May Co. has since sold a half-interest in the project 
to the Cleveland-based Forest City real estate company. 
</P>
<P>
Because May Co. did not keep track of the time that its lawyers, engineers and 
other employees put into the complex procedure of taking over the city-owned 
streets, the process is proving time-consuming, Winegar said. 
</P>
<P>
Park Labrea, with about 10,000 tenants, is the largest rental complex on the 
Westside. Access was limited to residents and their guests when the fencing 
system went into operation in 1989.

RECYCLING OFFICIAL RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's waste reduction coordinator, Jane Hinshaw, is resigning, effective 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Hinshaw, who was hired in August, said she was quitting for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
As the recycling coordinator -- which was a new position -- she oversaw a study 
of the city's amount and types of trash. The report, issued last week, will be 
the basis for devising ways to reduce the amount of waste 25% by 1995 and 50% 
by 2000, as mandated by a recently enacted state law. 
</P>
<P>
Hinshaw said she was proud of the report and the steady increase in recycling. 
Last month, 96 tons of newspaper, glass, plastic and other recyclable materials 
were left at the city's nine drop-off sites, up from about 55 tons when the 
program started in April, Hinshaw said.

California. 
</P>

COLLEGE TO RAISE FEES FOR PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica College Board of Trustees voted this week to double fees for 
on-campus parking from $20 per semester to $40, beginning in the spring 
semester, to help finance parking structures now being built. 
</P>
<P>
"The district cannot afford not to do this," college President Richard Moore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The higher fees, he said, will enable the college to repay what it borrowed 
from the state to build the parking structures. Even with the rate increase -- 
which will affect students, faculty and staff -- the college district will have 
to pay about $250,000 of the cost of the structures, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Students who participate in the college's Rideshare program and car-pool with 
at least two other students will be guaranteed on-campus parking and will pay 
only $20 per semester. 
</P>
<P>
Financial aid recipients will also pay $20 per semester. Rates for the summer 
session will be half the regular semester rates.

FISHING NOTES / DAN STANTON: ANGLER DONATES 23 1/2-POUND SHEEPHEAD TO MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Oyama of Long Beach has donated another fish to the Cabrillo Marine Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Oyama, who was fishing for yellowtail Monday aboard the Matt Walsh at the 
rockpile, sent his bait toward the bottom and hooked the largest sheephead of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
The fish was netted and placed in a bait tank. 
</P>
<P>
Oyama has donated fish to the museum on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
The male sheephead weighs 23 1/2 pounds and is on display at the museum in San 
Pedro. Its brilliant orange and black coloring lights up the display tank. 
</P>
<P>
Shauna Rose of West Los Angeles, on her first tuna trip aboard L.A. Harbor's 
Outerlimits, landed a 61-pound tuna despite a reel malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
Using a small mackerel for bait, Rose, 21, made several casts toward some tuna 
that were chasing chum-line bait. 
</P>
<P>
After getting a strike and battling the fish for several minutes, the side 
plate on her reel parted. 
</P>
<P>
Captain Gary Norby was standing by and handed Rose the line. At that point the 
only thing to do was hand line the fish in with 30-pound test line. 
</P>
<P>
Another angler handed Rose a glove and she continued to hand line. After 30 
minutes, the fish was gaffed. 
</P>
<P>
Rose said: "I did not want to give in to the fish even though I may have some 
line burns. It was the largest fish I ever had caught."

Laker forward James Worthy, who on Tuesday pleaded not guilty in Houston to 
charges of soliciting prostitution, has been linked to two separate incidents 
involving escort services in Portland, Ore., police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Simpson, a spokesman for the Portland Police Bureau, said credit card 
receipts with Worthy's name were found in 1987 in conjunction with an escort 
service that was closed for promoting prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said he could not remember the service's name. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Worthy's name was found on a log book that was seized from Allstar 
Models and Escorts, which was later shut down for promoting prostitution. 
Worthy's name was on the Feb. 6, 1990, log that listed a hotel phone and room 
number. The number matched the hotel and room number where Worthy was 
registered when the Lakers played the Trail Blazers that night. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said in both cases Worthy was not arrested nor is he part of any 
current investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to shut down the service, rather than arrest the customers," 
Simpson said. Soliciting prostitution is a misdemeanor in Oregon and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"The detective had received a tip in '87 that the (the Laker forward) was 
involved and, sure enough, we found credit card receipts with his name and 
signature. So, we weren't at all surprised when his name showed up again this 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said that it is standard procedure to use undercover officers at the 
start of the investigation until a case is solid. Search warrants are then 
issued and materials at the escort services are seized. In both cases Worthy's 
name was among the confiscated material. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy, when asked before Wednesday's game against Denver about the two Oregon 
incidents, said: "I don't have anything to say about that. I have no comment."

<P>
Everything you always wanted to know about USC, Notre Dame and the greatest 
intersectional rivalry in college football: 
</P>
<P>
USC graduate Shelley Prochaska and Notre Dame alumnus Don Smail will be married 
Friday and then delay their honeymoon until after Saturday's game. The couple 
has bought 90 Coliseum tickets for members of the wedding party and other 
guests. One guess as to what Mr. and Mrs. Smail will argue about first. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame leads the series, 34-23-4. The breakdown: ND leads 18-8-1 in South 
Bend and 2-0-0 in Chicago. USC leads 15-14-3 in the Coliseum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dressing for success -- Notre Dame's colors are blue and gold, but the Irish 
switched to green jerseys after the warmups in 1977 and 1983, and won easily 
both times. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you want to come early, your football ticket will admit you to the 
USC-Chicago State basketball game at the Sports Arena at 1:30 p.m. If you want 
to stay late, you can hear the postgame concert by the USC band, which expands 
its game repertoire. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Raghib (Rocket) Ismail has rushed 18 times for 262 yards and two touchdowns in 
fourth quarters but didn't play in the fourth quarter of Notre Dame's losses to 
Stanford and Penn State. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Only time both teams went into the game unbeaten and untied was in 1988 when 
Notre Dame was ranked No. 1, USC No. 2, and the Trojans the favorite in the 
Coliseum. The Irish won, 27-10. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Four Notre Dame players list actor George Wendt of "Cheers" as the most 
impressive person they've met. Wendt attended Notre Dame. On the set, they say 
he talks more about football than does former Kansas State student Kirstie 
Alley. . . . 
</P>
<P>
USC is a private institution, was founded in 1880, has an enrollment of 29,657 
and boasts Schools of Cinema-Television, Social Work, Public Administration and 
International Relations that are among the oldest and most prestigious in the 
country. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of Notre Dame's students are Catholic, although religion is not 
considered in the admission process. Females were first admitted as 
undergraduates in 1972 and make up about one-third of the student body of 
7,673. Ninety-two percent of varsity athletes earn degrees. . . . 
</P>
<P>
USC Athletic Director Mike McGee, the 1959 Outland Trophy winner at Duke, will 
be honored during pregame ceremonies for his induction into the National 
Football Foundation's College Football Hall of Fame. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Most controversial call in the series might have been one in 1978 at the 
Coliseum while USC was driving for the game-winning field goal. The Irish 
thought Trojan quarterback Paul McDonald lost the ball on a fumble, but it was 
ruled an incomplete pass. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The two old rivals and the University of North Carolina have teamed up to form 
the Sports Management Institute, which trains students to become college and 
professional sports executives. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Biggest crowd was in 1929 at Soldier Field in Chicago, an estimated 120,000, 
although the official paid count was a non-record 99,351. Smallest crowd was 
25,037 in 1933 in Notre Dame Stadium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Four of the first six games decided the national championship. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Todd Marinovich's uncle, Trojan quarterback Craig Fertig, threw the touchdown 
pass to Rod Sherman that upset the top-ranked and previously unbeaten Irish in 
1964. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles attendance record for a ticker-tape parade honoring a sports 
team is the 300,000 who turned out to salute USC in 1931 after its 16-14 
victory over Notre Dame in South Bend. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Against a Notre Dame team that led the nation in defense, USC exploded for 55 
points in a span of 16 minutes 55 seconds, overcame a 24-0 deficit and won, 
55-24, in 1974. However, Anthony Davis didn't score six touchdowns in that 
game. He got the half-dozen in 1972 when USC won, 45-23. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame's Joe Theismann and USC's Todd Marinovich both set school records of 
33 pass completions in defeats, Theismann in 1970 and Marinovich last year. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Coach Larry Smith is 1-4 against Notre Dame. He scored his only victory 
in 1982 when his Arizona Wildcats won, 16-13, on a field goal by Max Zendejas 
with no time remaining. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame's longest winning streak in the series is seven, beginning in 1983. 
USC won five in a row from 1978-82 and was unbeaten in six games, including two 
ties, from 1967-72. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Subway and overseas alumni, alike, will be able to see Saturday's game that 
will be televised in the United States, Japan, and 19 European countries. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Heisman Trophy winners who have played in the series include Angelo Bertelli, 
Johnny Lujack, Leon Hart, Johnny Lattner, Paul Hornung, John Huarte and Tim 
Brown of Notre Dame, and Mike Garrett, O.J. Simpson, Charles White and Marcus 
Allen of USC. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Prediction: USC 27, Notre Dame 24.

Dexter Manley, two days after his reinstatement following a one-year ban from 
the NFL for substance abuse, was claimed off waivers by the Phoenix Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Manley, 31, is not eligible to play in a game until Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams (3-7) put in a claim, but the Cardinals (2-8) had priority. 
</P>
<P>
Today's Thanksgiving Day NFL menu has the Denver Broncos playing at Detroit at 
9:30 a.m., PST, and the Washington Redskins playing at Dallas at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins (6-4) are the only team with realistic playoff hopes.

Ram receiver Henry Ellard was listed as questionable with a sore right 
hamstring Wednesday, and Coach John Robinson suggested that Ellard isn't 
expected to play against San Francisco Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
If Ellard can't play, Robinson said that rookie receiver Tony Lomack, who has 
been on the injured-reserve list all season, will probably be activated. TIM

EVERETT FEELING MORE PRESSURE THAN EVER; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: SLUMPING QUARTERBACK WON'T TALK WITH REPORTERS SO HE CAN CONCENTRATE ON 
THE 49ERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He has felt the pressure before, because quarterbacks always feel it first and 
hottest. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Jim Everett, first among Ram equals, is feeling about as much 
pressure as he ever has, about as much pressure as a season of collapsed 
expectations can cause. 
</P>
<P>
When everything else has failed, everyone has turned to Everett, hoping he 
could turn defeat into victory -- as he did last year. "Do it again, Jim," may 
as well be the Ram theme for 1990. "Do it again, or else . . . " 
</P>
<P>
But the punishment for failed saviors can be severe, he is learning, even 
though he has never quite claimed that description. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, for one of the first times in his career, the usually-affable 
Everett let it be known that he will not be talking with reporters this week, 
that he wants to keep his concentration focused on the 49er game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Everett, in the midst of a month-long slump, went directly from the practice 
field to the locker room, stayed inside until it was time to go to a meeting, 
and then left, giving quarterback coach Dick Coury the media message. 
</P>
<P>
The answers to those old whispers about Everett's jitteriness under the fire of 
a decent pass rush and his inability to win the big one had to come from other 
places. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some people concerned that he's throwing off his back foot, not 
standing in there against the rush and all those things," Coury said. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, that's a bunch of baloney. That's over-exaggerated. He's as tough as 
any other quarterback. And you can take games from last year we were winning 
where he's throwing off his back foot, and sometimes a quarterback has to do 
things like that. 
</P>
<P>
"It may not look like he's standing in there, but I don't think that's a 
problem as much as maybe pressing. I think he might be doing that, trying to 
make something happen up the field." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Everett had one of the best seasons a quarterback has ever had, 
throwing for 4,310 yards and 29 touchdowns while completing 58.7% of his 
passes. He won games with late rallies, he bombed at will, he looked like the 
NFL's next great quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
But you can't expect 4,310 yards every year from anybody, Coury says. When a 
team sags, the quarterback sags, too. It's not his fault, the Rams say, it's 
everybody's. 
</P>
<P>
Defenses have geared up to stop the Rams' deep patterns, and the adjustment to 
shorter routes has taken some time. Receiver Henry Ellard has been hurt off and 
on, a big blow to Everett. Early in the season, the defense was so bad the Ram 
offense was forced to throw on nearly every down, which is no way to win games. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Everett isn't playing very well, maybe he should step up into the pocket 
more often instead of skittering backward, but the Rams say they cannot ask him 
to perform miracles. 
</P>
<P>
So stop the pressure, they say. You can't ask Jim Everett to put up 4,310 every 
year. He did that while throwing off his back foot, too. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, he had a super year last year, and I think once you do that, people 
kind of expect it to happen every time you get out there," Coury said. "But 
see, he's still a young guy (27) and still inexperienced as far as the number 
of years he's been playing. 
</P>
<P>
"He's still, in my opinion, that caliber of quarterback. And some day, that's 
going to be the way he plays every year. You can't keep that pace week after 
week and get the big plays, like Jim was doing a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
Everett started this season wanting to finally eclipse, or at least equal, 49er 
quarterback Joe Montana. Ten games later, as the Rams (3-7) prepare to face 
Montana's 49ers (10-0) for the first time this season, Everett isn't even 
close. Montana is going for his fifth Super Bowl victory this year. Everett is 
shooting for five regular-season victories. 
</P>
<P>
The past four weeks, as his team plunged into playoff irrelevance, Everett has 
struggled, completing 65 of his 122 passes but throwing six interceptions and 
being deprived of a touchdown pass in three of the four games. 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly the statistics of a superstar, especially when Montana is your 
measuring stick. 
</P>
<P>
That is not a fair comparison for anybody not ready for enshrinement at Canton. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that I've seen any examples of that, when a team flounders, that 
the quarterback picks them up," Coach John Robinson said. "Those are nice 
stories, I guess. But I think teams pick themselves up as a team. I don't think 
individuals are ever capable of doing it. I've never seen it. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe there are some examples -- I don't remember one." 
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't Montana, perhaps, be such an example? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no," Robinson said quickly. "Montana's playing with either the best 
defense in football or the second-best defense in football. It almost doesn't 
give up touchdowns. He plays with the best receiver (Jerry Rice) maybe in the 
history of the game or about to be. And he plays with a club that hasn't lost 
in 18 games. I'm not sure picking up the team is exactly what it's called." 
</P>
<P>
And even when he concedes that Montana is always there for the big play when 
the 49ers need it, Robinson is quick to point out that Everett was the Rams' 
answer man last season. 
</P>
<P>
That 1990 has seen no magic doesn't mean Everett can't do it again, Robinson 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"The team's just not playing well, including him and me and all the rest of 
it," Robinson said. "I just don't believe focusing it on one player is ever 
accurate." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Rams are saying they want Everett to try to do less than he has 
been attempting, to scale down his desires to throwtouchdown passes every time. 
When he isn't pushing himself to be perfect, when he isn't trying to get the 
extra thrust on a pass that often sails high or wide or into a defender's 
hands, Everett comes closer to perfection. 
</P>
<P>
"He's trying to make the big play happen instead of maybe just taking the 
things underneath or coming off to a receiver that's not upfield as we did a 
year ago," Coury said. "Things like that, where he's just trying to get some 
points on the board or get the offense moving and feeling like, 'I've got to 
make everything happen.' I think that's probably his problem right now."

USC is down to its fourth tight end, sophomore Bob Crane, after redshirt 
freshman Brad Banta suffered a stress fracture in his left leg Saturday in the 
Trojans' 45-42 victory over UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this season, starter Frank Griffin suffered a season-ending knee 
injury, and backup Yonnie Jackson a season-ending foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
Banta was injured when a Bruin defensive back fell on his leg, Coach Larry 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Inside linebacker Matt Gee strained his right knee during last Saturday's game 
after removing a leg brace because it was uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor about tore his head off," Smith said. "And we (coaches) didn't know 
he didn't have it on because they wear those (braces) below their pads." 
</P>
<P>
Redshirt freshman Gidion Murrell will start at inside linebacker in place of 
Gee. JERRY CROWE

<P>
Dave Kragthorpe won't be back next year as Oregon State's coach, it was 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"After a lengthy and considerable discussion this morning, Coach Kragthorpe and 
I have mutually agreed to make a change at the head coaching position," Oregon 
State Athletic Director Dutch Baughman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers were 1-10 in 1990 and had a record of 17-48-2 in six seasons under 
Kragthorpe. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Alabama faculty senate, citing the failure of Arizona voters 
to approve a holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr., urged the school's 
football team not to play in the Fiesta Bowl if asked. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution was passed, 19-10, and will be forwarded to Roger Sayer, 
university president, and Pat Green, senate president.

PARNELLI JONES RETURNS TO ASCOT FOR FINAL NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parnelli Jones will be at Ascot Park tonight for the 50th annual Turkey Night 
Grand Prix midget race, which figures to be the last, since the track is 
scheduled to close. 
</P>
<P>
Jones will be there to accept membership in the Midget Racing Hall of Fame and 
to swap stories with friends who remember him as the brash kid from Torrance 
who went on, with the late J.C. Agajanian's help, to win the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
And he will be there as a former Turkey Night winner, having won in 1964, the 
year after he won the 500, and again in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
But most important, Jones will be there to watch his sons, P.J., 21, and Page, 
18, drive in the 100-lap Valvoline-United States Auto Club national 
championship race around Ascot's short half-mile dirt oval. 
</P>
<P>
The race is expected to attract more than 110 car-driver combinations, a USAC 
event record. Among them will be: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mel Kenyon, 57, of Lebanon, Ind., seven-time USAC champion who won the 1963 
and '75 Turkey Night races. This will be the 25th Thanksgiving night race for 
Kenyon, the leader in USAC midget race victories with 111. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ron Shuman of Tempe, Ariz., the California Racing Assn. sprint car 
champion, who has won six Turkey Night races -- no one else has won more than 
two -- including a remarkable four in a row from 1979 to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ron (Sleepy) Tripp of Costa Mesa, former two-time USAC champion and 
five-time Western States regional champion, who has won 30 USAC races at Ascot, 
but has never won on Thanksgiving night. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chuck Gurney of Livermore, winner of the last two Turkey Night races. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jac Haudenschild of Wooster, Ohio, a World of Outlaws sprint-car veteran 
who holds the one-lap midget record at Ascot. 
</P>
<P>
Parnelli Jones, who won 25 USAC midget main events during his career, remembers 
best one that got away on a Thanksgiving evening 28 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I was leading A.J. (Foyt) when my right front wheel fell off and I went 
cartwheeling down the track," Jones recalled. "It was one of the few times I 
was ever upside down in an open-wheel car. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst of it was that I felt I had A.J. handled. I had about half a 
straightaway on him. I wanted to win real bad because he had beaten me the two 
years before and he was driving my old car that Johnny Pouelsen owned. I was in 
a new one I'd bought in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
"I won at Ascot in sports cars, midgets, sprint cars and late model stock cars, 
but I'll never forget losing the one time I wanted to beat A.J. so bad." 
</P>
<P>
But Foyt didn't win it, either. Billy Cantrell did. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, when it comes to thrills at Ascot, I get more from watching my boys 
than I ever did racing myself," Parnelli said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time P.J. or Page gets out there, I get kind of anxious. More than I 
ever did when I was racing myself, but they've showed me they know what they're 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
P.J., a student at El Camino College, is second only to Tripp in USAC Western 
States victories this season, even though he missed a number of races to 
compete on the American Racing Series. Tripp has 10, P.J. seven. 
</P>
<P>
Page, who has won two TQ midget races at Ascot, won his first full midget race 
June 30 at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Also being honored tonight in hall of fame ceremonies will be two other Turkey 
Night winners, Bullet Joe Garson (1958) and Bill Vukovich, who won in 1948 when 
the race was at Gilmore Stadium. A fourth honoree, Pancho Carter, never won on 
Thanksgiving, but clinched the 1972 USAC championship in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Time trials will start at 6, racing at 8. 
</P>
<P>
DRIVER OF YEAR -- Al Unser Jr., the Indy car champion who won six of 16 races, 
was voted American driver of the year by a narrow margin over Dale Earnhardt, 
the NASCAR stock car champion. Geoff Brabham, the IMSA champion, finished third 
and Joe Amato, drag racing's top fuel champion, was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
SPRINT CARS -- After 49 races on dirt, the California Racing Assn. will 
conclude its season with two races on asphalt at Mesa Marin Raceway in 
Bakersfield. Defending champion Ron Shuman, who regained the lead over Rip 
Williams with a victory last Saturday in the Don Peabody Classic at Ascot Park, 
will be favored in Saturday night's main event. The season ends Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
MIDGETS -- After tonight's Ascot Park race, the USAC season will end Saturday 
night at Imperial Raceway in El Centro with a 40-lap main event on the 
three-eighths-mile dirt oval. Dave Strickland Jr. will be the driver to beat. 
He won at El Centro the last two years. . . . Even though he flipped during the 
final race of the USAC three-quarter midget season at Oildale, Jay Drake of 
Valencia had already clinched the season championship over Cory Kruseman of 
Ventura and Frank Deiny Jr. of Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
DRAG RACING -- The $40,000 National Hot Rod Assn.'s Pacific ET (elapsed time) 
championship series for sportsman racers will wind up Friday and Saturday at 
Bakersfield Raceway. Eliminations will start at 1 p.m. both days. 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS CARS -- The California Sports Car Club will hold two three-hour enduros 
Saturday and Sunday at Willow Springs Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
BAJA AFTERMATH -- Anna Cody Merritt of Los Olivos and Lillie Sweetland of 
Phoenix became the first female motorcycle team to finish a Baja 1,000. They 
rode a Kawasaki owned by overall winner Larry Roeseler to finish seventh in 17 
hours 17 minutes in the 250cc class.

DISCOUNT SHOPPING 
</P>
<P>
If the thought of paying full price for holiday gifts brings out the Scrooge in 
you, pick up a copy of "Buying Retail Is Stupid!" by Trisha Crumley, Deborah 
Newmark and Bonnie Cunningham (Newmark Management Institute), a handy guide to 
off-price stores and shopping centers in Southern California. (A reminder: Many 
discounters do not accept credit cards, so call ahead.) Local listings include 
Freidman's -- the Microwave Specialists in Orange, which offers more than 75 
kinds and a full line of accessories; B &amp; B Marine Equipment &amp; Service 
in Newport Beach, which carries goodies for the sailor in your life; and 
Nordstrom Rack in Santa Ana, where you can pick up shoes, clothing and 
accessories from past seasons at the chain's regular stores at 30% to 70% off. 
</P>
<P>
Barstow, situated midway between L.A. and Las Vegas, is hardly around the 
block. But the prices and selection at the Factory Merchants Outlet Plaza (2837 
Lenwood Road) may make it worth the drive. You can find savings of 20% to 70% 
off regular retail prices on items from such name-brand companies as Lenox, 
Fieldcrest, Gant, Anne Klein, Ralph Lauren, London Fog, Oshkosh B'Gosh and 
more. Shopper extraordinaire Buckita Benson offers trips there through her 
Outlet Shopping Tours. The $24 package includes luxury bus transportation to 
and from the center, refreshments and a comprehensive store guide. The next 
tour scheduled from the Orange County area is Dec. 8. Call (213) 372-9930.

<P>
SPECIALTY GIFTS 
</P>
<P>
Those fancy gourmet baskets overflowing with imported goodies and fine wines 
make impressive gifts. But they can also make a serious dent in your holiday 
budget. With a little legwork and imagination, though, you can put together 
your own at significant savings. A good first (and possibly last) stop would be 
Trader Joe's, the food and wine chain, which has stores in Laguna Hills, 
Fullerton, Santa Ana, Costa Mesa and Huntington Beach. There are variations, 
but the stores generally offer items such as dried fruits, gourmet nuts 
(macadamias are now available at $5 per 12 oz. bag), cheeses, sausages, and 
imported wines and beers (with big savings on these). A $14.99 Stoli Sampler, 
for example, has three flavors of the pricey Stolichnaya vodka. 
</P>
<P>
In Old Town Orange (corner of Chapman Avenue and Glassell Street), antiques 
from Victorian furniture and artwork to '50s collectibles can be found among 
the 35 shops and mini-malls in the area. After shopping, you can relax at one

'TIS BETTER TO GIVE

A number of charitable groups give you a chance to spread that holiday cheer to 
those less fortunate. Here are a couple of ideas . . . 
</P>
<P>
Give a goat (or rabbit or heifer or chicken) to a needy family through the 
Alternative Christmas Giving Market from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. every Sunday until 
Christmas at the United Methodist Church of Garden Grove (12741 Main St.). Make 
a donation of any size toward the purchase of livestock, seeds, medicine of 
other necessities for the underprivileged, and you will receive a card 
describing the gift to give to someone on your list. The funds are channeled 
through local and international charitable organizations, among them the Church 
World Service/United Methodist Committee on Relief and Real Help of Garden 
Grove. (714) 991-5558. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County office of the Salvation Army hopes to aid 20,000 deserving 
folk during the holidays. Their bell-ringers will be out in force at all major 
shopping centers from Monday, Nov. 26, through Christmas Eve. At the Laguna 
Hills Mall, the group will have an Angel Tree listing the names and ages of 
needy children. Shoppers may take a name, purchase and wrap a gift for that 
child and return it to the tree for the group to distribute on Christmas Eve. 
Donations of cash, food and wrapped gifts and also helping hands to aid in 
sorting and distributing the goodies are welcome at the Salvation Army 
Christmas Headquarters (101 S. East St., Anaheim). (714) 558-9354.

THE THIN MAN; 
</P>
<P>
BOB ZANY'S NEWEST PERSONA RELIES MORE HEAVILY ON HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, Dennis McLellan is a staff writer for The Times Orange 
County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Zany, before he started dieting earlier this year, weighed in at a hefty 
350 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Zany, after he finished dieting recently, weighed in at a lean 175. 
</P>
<P>
That's great news for Bob Zany, the man. But what about Bob Zany, the comic, 
who once had a good 10 minutes of fat jokes in his act? Lines like: "I went to 
a fat farm. . . . They made it a ranch." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based comedian, who is at the Laff Stop in Newport Beach 
through Sunday, says TV producers have even been asking: "Is Bob Zany funny 
thin?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's like I have to re-prove myself," said Zany, who recently did his first TV 
spot, "MTV's Half Hour Comedy Hour," in his new, thin persona. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the long, unruly hair and the loud Hawaiian shirts -- shirts so loud 
"people would ask me to turn it down sometimes." In their places are shorter, 
styled hair and a trendy black sport coat over a white T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
"Now my style is pretty much I have to rely more on me as opposed to being just 
this goofy-looking fat guy," said Zany, who says his act is still as "zany" as 
ever. And, yes, he still pulls out props from a suitcase he calls his Orson 
Welles lunch pail. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Zany is used to doing his act as a mere shadow of his former self. 
</P>
<P>
As he shed the pounds -- due to daily exercise and a 900-calories-a-day diet -- 
he continued to perform in comedy clubs. 
</P>
<P>
So what finally motivated him to lose the weight? 
</P>
<P>
"A mirror," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But that's the quick, joke answer. 
</P>
<P>
"I was unhappy and I just wanted to make a change and I did it," he explained, 
adding that he limited his diet to chicken, fish, fruit and vegetables. He also 
progressed from slow walking to running and cycling. "My next step's the gym," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
What was the comic eating before he started his diet? 
</P>
<P>
"Ding Dongs," he said, "and a lot of Volkswagens." 
</P>
<P>
But seriously folks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I ate a lot of meat and stuff like that," Zany said. "I'm a big fan of cakes 
and cookies -- and Ding Dongs, actually. So there's some truth in that joke. 
But (eating) got out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
Zany said he had become extremely overweight about five years ago, "and before 
that I had been up and down my whole life, really. I flirted with being thin 
for a while." 
</P>
<P>
The West Covina native made his comedy debut on "The Gong Show" in 1977 when he 
was 15. He said he was first introduced on the show as Bob (Zany) Tetreault, 
but after a few appearances the show's host dropped his last name and "I just 
went with Bob Zany." 
</P>
<P>
Zany, who has been making his living in comedy since 1983, was discovered at 
the Ice House in Pasadena by L.A. radio deejay Frazer Smith, who asked him to 
do humorous call-ins to Smith's popular KLOS-FM morning show. Zany soon had his 
own weekend radio show. He also founded and operates a string of Bob Zany's 
Comedy Outlets throughout California and wrote and co-produced a comedy album, 
"Hi Home, I'm Honey." 
</P>
<P>
Does the term zany best sum up his comedy style? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it sums up a lot," he said. "I think basically emotional scars." 
</P>
<P>
As for describing his comedy, Zany said: "It's really weird. I've settled with 
this: I think my style is there is no style. I pretty much do a little bit of 
everything. I'll be the brash guy and I'll be the timid guy. I mix a lot of it 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Does he think his 350-pound persona lent itself more to being "zany"? 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," he said. "I've had the name for so long and I've had four 
different personas in my career. I'm a mixture of all them. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started I was, like, the surfer comic. I was this young, blond guy with 
OP shirts. Then I became the stupid guy on the Frazer Smith shows. And then I 
became the fat, goofy guy. And now I'm . . . hang on one second." 
</P>
<P>
He put the phone down and could be heard talking to his business partner in the 
background: "Michelle, what would you say I am now? What's my persona now?" 
</P>
<P>
Silence. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll get back to you with that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Who: Bob Zany. 
</P>
<P>
When: Friday, Nov. 23, at 8, 10 and 11:45 p.m.; Saturday, Nov. 24, at 8, 10 and

BAD NEWS: Agencies providing holiday food to the needy say they expect many 
more hungry mouths this year. . . . The Orange County Rescue Mission, which 
served 1,800 turkey dinners last Thanksgiving, is expecting to serve as many as 
3,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvation Army also reports increased demand. . . . But there's good news 
too. Despite recession worries, donations have not decreased. "I don't think 
I've experienced more calls from people to volunteer," says a Salvation Army 
spokesman. Carla Rivera and Anne Michaud

AT THE OFFICE: Companies are cutting back plans for their holiday parties, as 
far as caterer Alan Greeley can tell. . . . "There's a lot of caution in the 
wind.

<P>
I don't think we're pouring as much French champagne as in years past." . . . 
Even giants like the Irvine Co. have blue-penciled gifts for clients. Said a 
spokesman: "We felt, both in light of the economic times and the recent 
cutbacks in our overhead, the gifts wouldn't be appropriate." Carla Rivera and

ANTI-WAR: As President Bush arrived in the Middle East on Wednesday, student 
protests (above) against his gulf actions were under way in South Orange County 
(B1). . . . Among the Capistrano Valley High School students on hand was 
homecoming queen Lisa Merritt, who worries that war is imminent. "I don't want 
to put down the (soldiers) who are in Saudi Arabia because they are just doing 
their jobs," said Merritt, 17. "I just don't think our government is doing all 
it possibly can to avoid war." Carla Rivera and Anne Michaud

CITIZENS TO RESEARCH HOLIDAY ALTERNATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city is looking for 11 residents to serve on a task force that will be 
asked to find holiday observances the city can sponsor without offending 
people's cultural and religious values. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted in September to form the citizen task force after 
protests from residents and local churches shot down a plan to set up a 
Christmas tree outside City Hall this December. 
</P>
<P>
There was also criticism of a plan to establish some form of prayer at the 
start of council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents who testified before the council said a Christmas tree 
officially endorsed by the city government would offend their non-Christian 
beliefs, and a prayer or silent moment held before council meetings also would 
offend many. 
</P>
<P>
After the plans for the tree failed by a 2-2 vote, the council approved the 
idea of the task force as a means to find inoffensive ways for the city to 
sponsor holiday displays or celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
Applications to the task force will be accepted until Nov. 30. The 13-member 
task force, which will include two members of city's Cultural Affairs 
Commission, is expected to issue its report to the commission in March. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is expected to present its findings to the City Council in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
Residents should call the city at (714) 724-6684 to request an application. TOM

ANTI-DRUNK-DRIVING SIGNS RECOMMENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's Public Safety Commission voted unanimously this week to recommend 
installing 10 street signs near bars and restaurants reminding motorists not to 
drive after drinking. 
</P>
<P>
The commission made the same recommendation to the City Council in June, but 
the council delayed action because it didn't like the design of the proposed 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
The original sign would have featured a large martini glass with a car behind 
it, all enclosed inside a circle with a slash through it. 
</P>
<P>
Then-Mayor Larry Agran said in June that he thought the signs would be "quickly 
disregarded" by motorists. Council members agreed and said in June that the 
signs should include an anti-drunk-driving message. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed sign design approved by the commission Tuesday night uses the same 
circle-slash picture from before, but adds the words "Don't Drink and Drive" 
along the bottom and "DUI Laws Strictly Enforced" along the top. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's recommendation to add the permanent signs, at a cost of 
$1,200, will be forwarded to the City Council. If approved, the signs probably 
will not be installed until after this holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
Public Safety Commissioner Dave Christensen voted to approve the signs, but 
expressed doubts about their effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"Are people really going to look at these signs and say, 'Gee whiz, I better 
not drink and drive tonight?' " Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
But Commissioner Leslie Pyle said the signs will serve as constant reminders to 
the public of the risk of being caught if they drive after drinking. TOM

SILENCE GOLDEN FOR OLD SOUND SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Council members had begun discussing a proposal to repair the failing 
audio system in their meeting chambers when the sound system itself seemingly 
lobbied for the item. 
</P>
<P>
The glitch-ridden system went dead. 
</P>
<P>
Unaided by amplification, council members were forced to shout their comments 
and questions to city staff members about the proposed repairs. 
</P>
<P>
And, soon after the council unanimously agreed to spend $6,380 requested for 
the improvements, the sound system kicked on again. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the latest audio system letdown was not related to the problems for 
which the interim repairs were recommended, said Walter Eby, the city's 
engineering supervisor in charge of the system. After a City Hall power failure 
had ended, electricity to the facility returned but the sound system didn't, 
Eby said. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally turned up that there was a sticky regulator in the back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But, at least for the sake of appearances, the timely sound outage spotlighted 
the chronic problems of the system, which both amplifies voices in the council 
chambers and broadcasts them for cable television. 
</P>
<P>
New wiring parts will be purchased to temporarily restore the system to a 
reliable state, eliminating most of the crackling noises and intermittent sound 
interruption that has plagued it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
An engineering consultant has recommended that the city install a $20,000 
wireless system to replace the existing one. And, although cumulative repairs 
on the current system are approaching that figure, the council has not yet 
agreed to buy a new system.JOHN PENNER

<P>
ONE-PARENT FAMILIES GET HOLIDAY HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For most of the year, some single parents are able to provide their families 
with meals that are only as lavish as food stamps and their tight budgets will 
allow. 
</P>
<P>
But today, 69 single-parent families in the Huntington Beach area will feast on 
hot turkey dinners with their favorite trimmings. 
</P>
<P>
The Thanksgiving dinners are gifts from individuals, groups and businesses that 
have donated food or supermarket gift certificates to help the families 
celebrate the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The meals are provided through the "adopt-a-family" program initiated this year 
by the city's Project Self-Sufficiency, which helps more than 100 single 
parents make ends meet for the present and get on track to escape welfare 
dependency in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old project, which is funded by private donations and federal 
grants, has offered free Thanksgiving meals in previous years. But, by 
collecting donated food and distributing it as far as it reached, it was able 
to serve only about 30 families, said Susan Edwards, the project's acting 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
The adopt-a-family program offers dinners to more single parents, while adding 
a more personal touch to the gifts, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
This Thanksgiving, the project has linked contributors with every family that 
requested a meal, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
The donated dinners are tailored to suit the specific needs of each family. 
And, in some cases, the person or group representative sponsoring the family's 
meal is delivering the meal to their front door, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've left it up to the (donating) community members to decide how they want 
to handle it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the more unusual cases, she said, a pair of 21-year-old men packed a 
laundry basket with an "instant Thanksgiving dinner" -- including instant 
gravy, potatoes and stuffing, along with cans of corn, green beans and rolls. 
</P>
<P>
"That was just their idea of what a Thanksgiving dinner should be," she said. 
"And they put a lot of time and money into it." 
</P>
<P>
Most contributors, Edwards said, "have been very generous," donating meals or 
their equivalent totaling between $25 and $50. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, meanwhile, is now gearing up to provide meals to 80 families for 
Christmas, and beyond then, since the project attempts to provide some meals 
year-round for some of its members. 
</P>
<P>
"People are very generous during the holidays, but the rest of the year is 
usually pretty lean," she said. "During March, April and May, our food pantry 
is naked."JOHN PENNER

METHAMPHETAMINE SEIZED; MAN HELD

<P>
Acting on a tip, Newport Beach narcotics officers arrested a Garden Grove man 
at his home on suspicion of drug possession and confiscated 5 ounces of 
methamphetamine, eight assorted firearms and $200 in cash, police said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
James Alan Gassaway, 43, was taken into custody Tuesday afternoon at his Otis 
Street home, minutes after undercover detectives found a jar full of 
methamphetamine buried in his front yard, Newport Beach Police Sgt. Andy Gonis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The self-employed truck driver was being held on $50,000 bail at Newport Beach 
City Jail and is expected to be arraigned on drug possession charges Friday at 
Harbor Municipal Court, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonis said detectives working on a case received information that they would be 
able to find the drug, also known as speed, at Gassaway's house, Gonis said. He 
declined to elaborate on the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
At the house, Gonis said, one of the plainclothes detectives noticed a spot on 
the yard that looked suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
"They saw that the ground had recently been dug up," Gonis said. "Something 
looked like it was buried there." 
</P>
<P>
The officers then discovered a buried plastic jar with a sandwich-size plastic 
bag stuffed into it. Inside the bag was a substance that police believe to be 
methamphetamine with a street value of about $14,000, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with search warrants, the detectives combed the house and found two 
shotguns, two rifles and four handguns, Gonis said. About $200 in Gassaway's 
wallet was confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
There was no one else in the house, Gonis said.JAMES M. GOMEZ

NIGHTCLUB PARKING RULES TOUGHENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite strong opposition from Councilman John Acosta, the City Council this 
week approved a new set of parking regulations for lodges, cabarets, bars and 
nightclubs in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which was tabled numerous times during the summer and fall, is 
part of a package of stricter residential and commercial parking requirements 
recently approved by the council. 
</P>
<P>
The council's action changes parking requirements to one space for every 28 
feet of public assembly area. 
</P>
<P>
The old rules required dance halls and lodges to provide one space for every 
150 square feet of floor area. Nightclubs, cabarets and bars were required to 
have one space for each 35 square feet of dining or drinking area plus 
additional parking spaces for each seat inside the facility, said Larry 
Yenglin, associate planner. 
</P>
<P>
"The new standards simplify everything and bring all the businesses under the 
same regulations," Yenglin said. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta, who was on the losing end of a 5-2 vote, said he opposed the new 
regulations because he felt they unfairly target Mr. J's, a restaurant at 2101 
E. Edinger Ave. that has been cited by the city for operating illegally as a 
nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ordinance is meant to affect only incoming businesses, Mr. J's 
falls under the new rules because it is not in compliance with current city 
code, city officials said. It is the only existing business affected by the new 
parking standards. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta accused city staff of a "backdoor move" meant to make that specific 
property available for an auto lot. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager David N. Ream said the city is not currently looking into that 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Daniel H. Young said if an auto lot were eventually proposed for the 
site, he would support the idea. "Living in that area, I'd say it's a natural," 
Young said. GREG HERNANDEZ

HOMELESS CENTER GETS NEW LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shortly after the Episcopal Service Alliance center opened 20 months ago, a 
caller threatened to set the building afire if the charity remained. 
</P>
<P>
Another day, the staff arrived to discover that thieves had taken typewriters, 
a copier, television set, videocassette recorder and a vacuum cleaner, said 
program manager Ellen Gilchrist. 
</P>
<P>
Even as it opened, some neighbors expressed concerns that the center to aid the 
homeless, sandwiched between South Laguna retail stores, could hurt nearby 
businesses. Residents and some city officials grumbled that they had not been 
consulted before the Episcopal Alliance moved in. 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, the center announced in a newspaper ad that it would close. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't have the money and the backing to do it any more," Gilchrist 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And then came the turning point, Gilchrist said. 
</P>
<P>
"The very next day, things happened." An anonymous donation arrived. Enough to 
pay the rent for at least six months, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The community pulled through," she said. "They wanted us to stay, and that's 
what we needed to hear." 
</P>
<P>
The center provides an employment program for the homeless as well as food, 
clothing, transportation and referrals to other county services. The center 
does not offer overnight lodging, but clients can shower and wash their clothes 
there. 
</P>
<P>
The Episcopal Service Alliance has five branches in the county, including 
offices in San Clemente, Huntington Beach, Anaheim and Santa Ana. It also runs 
a San Clemente family shelter called Anchor House and a shelter for women in 
Orange, Martha House. 
</P>
<P>
Services at the Laguna Beach branch have changed somewhat since the 
organization opened the office at 31676 Coast Highway. The doors are open three 
days a week instead of five, and clients who need mental health services are 
now given bus passes to the San Clemente office. But the organization's 
executive director agrees that the service center has finally found its niche 
in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has kind of turned the corner," Dennis White said. "People are 
seeing it as a place that is helpful to the community and a place they can come 
and give back to the community." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, volunteers are busy stuffing food baskets for families and preparing 
a Thanksgiving dinner for the needy, which is sponsored by the center, members 
of the community and Friendship Shelter, a homeless shelter in Laguna Beach. 
The holiday dinner will be held today at Bluebird Park at Cress Street and 
Coast Highway between noon and 2 p.m. About 150 people are expected. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, workers say, Episcopal Service Alliance is becoming a part of 
Laguna's diverse community. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we're pretty permanent," Gilchrist said. LESLIE EARNEST

CRIME INFORMATION REWARD IDEA JUNKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Gene Wisner has scrapped a proposal to have the city offer a $20,000 
reward for information concerning two recent brutal attacks by suspected Asian 
gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Wisner had asked the City Council in October to consider offering the reward in 
hopes of helping to prevent similar crimes in the city, which has one of the 
lowest crime rates in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In September, a band of Asian teen-agers stormed into a home, tied up five 
members of a Chinese family and pistol-whipped the mother before fleeing with 
jewelry. Suspects in the attack were never identified. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 7, three armed youths broke into the home of a Yorba Linda physician, 
tied up his 14-year-old daughter and bound and pistol-whipped his wife before 
escaping with an undetermined amount of cash, jewelry and other personal 
belongings. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 of these "home invasion" robberies have been reported in 
California since 1988, and the perpetrators and the victims are nearly always 
of Asian heritage. 
</P>
<P>
After that attack, Wisner met with City Manager Arthur C. Simonian and Brea 
Police Chief Donald L. Forkus to discuss the reward proposal. They convinced 
him that it "would create more problems than it would solve," he said. 
</P>
<P>
City staff has said that such a reward would put the city in a position of 
judging which types of crimes are serious enough to merit offering a reward. 
Instead, city officials recommended that information be directed to the "We 
Tip" hot line, which offers up to $1,000 for crime information. The council on 
Tuesday also asked staff to broadcast the hot line number, (800) 472-7766, on 
the city's public access cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
Wisner had argued that informants would be unwilling to "put their lives on the 
line" for just $1,000, but he agreed that the council should not be put in the 
position of arbitrarily offering rewards. TED JOHNSON

<TEXT>
<P>
Tapes of music and messages from celebrities, along with Knott's Berry Farm 
preserves and Los Angeles Rams yearbooks, are among the little bits of home 
that a consortium of local businesses plans to send to 5,000 Orange County 
Marines spending Christmas in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of "Operation Orange Shield," as it has been dubbed by organizer 
Robert Nelson, a Costa Mesa public relations executive, is to send each of the 
local Marines a personal care package, sponsors said. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think, like almost everyone else I talk to, that we want to do 
something a little bit special for the young men and women who are over there," 
said Bob Roth, a spokesman for Disneyland, which is donating 5,000 decks of 
playing cards. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're lucky to have the opportunity to do something on a large scale 
by joining these other groups." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the drive sent telegrams to 1,000 companies and individuals 
throughout the county last week asking for donations of $1,000 each; they hope 
to raise $50,000 for the purchase of additional gifts, sponsors said. 
</P>
<P>
"We all owe a debt of gratitude to servicemen around the world serving in 
military Operation Desert Shield," said Nelson. "I hope others will join us by 
sending a message to those soldiers risking their lives for the freedom of 
others." 
</P>
<P>
Local rock station KEZY-FM is donating tapes of music and messages from 
celebrities to the Marines, which were aired Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who was listed as one of the drive's 
sponsors on the telegrams sent to local businessmen, said he was eager to help 
Nelson, a former executive aide in his office. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, a retired Marine Corps brigadier general who saw battle in World War II, 
recalled his own loneliness as a young Marine during his first Christmas away 
from home in Guadalcanal. Members of his unit gathered for a midnight Mass on 
Christmas Eve, hiding candles under empty ration cans, until the distant sound 
of Japanese aircraft forced them to flee into the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
"I served at Christmas, so I know it can be a time of loneliness," Riley said. 
"That's a time when thoughts return home, thoughts of family and a time of 
emotional separation." 
</P>
<P>
"Bringing a little bit of something from home, I think, will improve the 
morale," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The gift packages will be assembled Dec. 1 at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
Anyone wishing to make monetary donations or volunteer for the project may call 
(714) 668-7218.

A 21-year-old Orange man was killed instantly early Wednesday morning when he 
lost control of his speeding motorcycle, which flipped at a freeway interchange 
and sent him flying more than 200 feet into a grassy embankment. 
</P>
<P>
Michael S. Ward was pronounced dead at the scene of the 12:30 a.m. accident, 
which occurred at the interchange of the Corona del Mar and Costa Mesa 
freeways, California Highway Patrol Officer Linda Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
Ward was driving his 1989 Honda CBR motorcycle north on the Corona del Mar 
Freeway and speeding when he entered the ramp to the northbound Costa Mesa 
Freeway, Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
Ward lost control of the motorcycle, which struck a guardrail and flipped out 
from under him, sending Ward over the guardrail, over the Baker Street off-ramp 
and into an embankment 200 feet away, she said. There were no witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Ward was found a short time later by a motorist traveling in the same 
direction, who had stopped to move the motorcycle from the road.

FOLLOWING IN FOOTSTEPS OF HER SISTERS; 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL: STANFORD'S BEV ODEN IS BECOMING A NATIONAL-CALIBER PLAYER LIKE HER 
SIBLINGS KIM AND ELAINA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bev Oden has always studied the size of her older sisters' shadows. 
</P>
<P>
She has explored the vastness of them all her life, playing volleyball within 
the boundaries laid out by Kim and Elaina. 
</P>
<P>
She excelled as they did but could never pass them. The shadows have done as 
shadows do: With every step Bev takes forward, her sisters move forward, too, 
leaving Bev's reach to forever exceed her grasp. 
</P>
<P>
There were times when Bev struggled against these expectations, but no more. 
When she chose to take her volleyball game from Irvine High School to Stanford 
two years ago, she did it even though she knew she would be following Kim, 
twice selected national player of the year for the Cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? Bev had grown accustomed to her sisters' example after 18 years. 
Wouldn't she be acknowledging the pressure more if she chose not to follow her 
own desire only because it had been Kim's as well? So what if neither time nor 
distance nor the transience of a college-town population could make Bev 
anonymous in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when I go to the post office, people recognize me as Kim's sister -- the 
workers, even the maintenance people," Bev said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Bev, who led Irvine to two state championships, succeeded immediately at 
Stanford, being selected an All-American as a freshman, and she is playing even 
better this year. 
</P>
<P>
Kim and Elaina, both out of college, are likely on their way to being teammates 
at the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
And a funny thing is happening. Bev might be gaining on the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
It looked that way one night in Westwood last month, when Bev carried her game 
to its highest level in a match against No. 1 UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford went ahead, two games to one, and led, 12-4, in the fourth as Bev 
lurked and leaped and swatted the ball. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA came back to tie the score, and Stanford then twice served for the match 
at 15-14 before losing the game. 
</P>
<P>
The match lasted 3 hours 16 minutes, and Bev had been dominating. At the end, 
she had 92 attacks, a school record. And she had finished with 41 kills, 
demolishing the school record of 32. 
</P>
<P>
That record used to be Kim's. 
</P>
<P>
It was a concrete example of Bev surpassing Kim, and it will be written on 
paper, for anyone to see. 
</P>
<P>
Bev didn't learn she had broken the record until later, when she had returned 
to school. It meant something to her, not because of sibling rivalry, but as a 
measure of her progress. 
</P>
<P>
"To know that I'm getting closer to her level is great for me," Bev said. "I 
look forward to getting better each year, getting closer to her. Doing things 
just like that proves I'm getting there, slowly." 
</P>
<P>
She may yet surpass her sisters in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
There has been an Oden on the national championship team before, and there has 
been an Oden named player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
But never at the same time. It has always been an either/or proposition. 
</P>
<P>
Kim was the national player of the year twice at Stanford but never won a 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Elaina helped win two national championships at the University of the Pacific 
but was never player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Now Bev has three chances ahead of her to do either or both. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford is ranked third in the country, behind UCLA and Nebraska, and awaiting 
the NCAA pairings after finishing the regular season 25-3. 
</P>
<P>
And Bev, who has far surpassed an outstanding freshman season, is one of a 
handful of players in the running for national player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be surprised if she is player of the year this year as a sophomore. 
She has improved tremendously," said her coach, Don Shaw, who considers UCLA's 
Natalie Williams, Nebraska's Val Novak, UCLA's Jenny Evans (formerly of Newport 
Harbor High) and Hawaii's Karrie Trieschman the other contenders. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Shaw moved Bev from a middle blocker/middle hitter position into one 
opposite the setter, which gives her more opportunities to hit and more 
responsibility in blocking and defense. 
</P>
<P>
As for comparisons with Kim, who was an All-American at Stanford from 1982-85 
and player of the year in '84 and '85, they are kept to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't even talk about it," Shaw said. "Occasionally, if she's doing 
something well, I'll tell her 'Hey, it took Kim three or four years to do 
that.' " Bev still doesn't see herself as approaching the abilities of her 
sisters. 
</P>
<P>
Said Oden, "I don't think I've gotten to that state, (and) I still see them 
being so far ahead of me, in their games and in their lives. Kim being seven 
years older has always been like a Mom. But we are getting closer, especially 
in the things we talk about at home." 
</P>
<P>
One of the things they do not talk about much is Kim's disappointment about 
never winning an NCAA championship at Stanford -- a school that has never won 
it despite six trips to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a big topic of conversation (with Kim)," Bev said. "It's understood. 
We all know how she feels about it. I know it hurts, so we don't bring it up a 
lot. That's another reason I don't want to go through the same thing, getting 
to the final four and losing." 
</P>
<P>
Bev would like to be player of the year some time in her college career, but 
she is emphatic about her preference if she, like her sisters, will be limited 
to one of the two big prizes in college volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
"If the choice is between winning the national championship and player of the 
year, I'd rather win the national championship," Bev said. "I'm more worried 
about actually coming out on top once. It would be so much more of an 
accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, it would be kind of proving something to ourselves. It would be the 
ultimate satisfaction after working this hard so many years. Knowing we can do 
it and doing it -- there's such a big difference between knowing you can do it 
and losing and going all the way and winning and finishing. It adds a lot to it 
that we've never won a national championship." 
</P>
<P>
That would be an accomplishment that neither Stanford -- nor any Oden who 
played there -- has known.

<P>
Sunny Hills quarterback Jim Karsatos became the top single-season passer in 
Orange County history 10 years ago this week. 
</P>
<P>
Karsatos set the record, 2,142 yards, by completing 11 of 21 passes for 194 
yards in a 34-14 first-round Southern Section playoff victory over Los Amigos. 
Servite's Brad Wekal had set the previous mark of 2,139 in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Karsatos eventually reached 2,703 yards, a figure which stood for four years 
until Newport Harbor's Shane Foley threw for 3,092. 
</P>
<P>
Karsatos is now sixth on the all-time county list. The leader is David Lowery 
of Trabuco Hills (3,325 yards, 1988), followed by Scott Stark of Capistrano 
Valley (3,153, 1985), Foley, David Henigan of Fountain Valley (2,917, 1988) and 
Steve Stenstrom of El Toro (2,830, 1989). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5 YEARS AGO 
</P>
<P>
Before a 35-6 victory over Nogales in the first round of the Southern 
Conference football playoffs, Mission Viejo Coach Bill Crow put his team to the 
test -- literally. 
</P>
<P>
Crow gave his players a written test that briefly covered the opponent's 
formations and tendencies and emphasized what he thought would be a key element 
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The players also were expected to write a short essay on a variety of subjects. 
Crow and defensive coordinator Mike Rush selected the best essays and read them 
to the team just before taking the field. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the tests get the players mentally ready, and the essays help them get 
emotionally ready," Crow said. "Sometimes (a player's essay) will get through 
to another player better than a coach." 
</P>
<P>
The results? Mission Viejo (11-2-1) tied for second in the South Coast League 
(with El Toro, behind Capistrano Valley) and finished as runner-up in the 
Southern Conference, losing the final to Santa Ana, 31-21. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 YEAR AGO 
</P>
<P>
One-Man Shows: 
</P>
<P>
Tim Manning of Trabuco Hills rushed for 138 yards and two touchdowns and passed 
for 158 yards and one touchdown to lead the Mustangs to a 35-21 victory over 
Cabrillo in a Division VIII football playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Gaw of Mission Viejo rushed for 164 yards and a touchdown in 12 carries to 
lead the Diablos past Dominguez, 34-6, in a Division II playoff game. Gaw also 
had a 67-yard touchdown reception. 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Smith of Edison completed 18 of 26 passes for 236 yards and ran for the 
Chargers' final touchdown in an 18-14 victory over Eisenhower in a Division I 
playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
Terrific Two: In the second round of the Southern Section Division III 
playoffs, Capistrano Valley receiver Dave Poltl and quarterback Tony Solliday 
each had a big game in a 44-12 pounding of Santa Ana. Poltl caught five passes 
for 112 yards, including one for a 55-yard touchdown play, and Solliday 
completed 10 of 12 passes for 226 yards.

Three South Pasadena High School players each scored four goals to overpower 
Costa Mesa, 17-12, in the Southern Section Division 2-A water polo final 
Wednesday at Belmont Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Cherrie, Eric Norvedt and Tim Rohr combined for 12 goals as South Pasadena 
won its second consecutive 2-A title. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa was led by senior Corey Delahunt, who scored eight goals. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought in the second half we were still in range," Costa Mesa Coach Jason 
Lynch said. "I figured it was out of reach about the fourth quarter." 
</P>
<P>
South Pasadena (26-4) led, 7-4, at halftime and was ahead 11-6 after three 
quarters. The lead was extended to 15-8, with 3 minutes 58 seconds left to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't do anything in particular, they were just the better team," 
Delahunt said. "They took advantage of size a little bit, but what can you 
really say? They just beat us." 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa seemed to let down midway through the third quarter when it was 
unable to convert three counterattack opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa (18-10) was competitive early, causing problems for South Pasadena 
offense in the first quarter. South Pasadena led, 3-2, after the first quarter 
when Ben Johnson scored in a six-on-five situation with 51 seconds left in the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
South Pasadena came out strong in the second quarter, quickly stretching its 
lead to 6-2 with 1:51 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
But Delahunt scored twice in the next minute to pull Costa Mesa within two at 
6-4. Cherrie scored with three seconds left in the half to give South Pasadena 
a 7-4 halftime lead.

FINAL CHANCE TO TAKE TURKEY BECOMES LEWIS' PERSONAL QUEST; 
</P>
<P>
AUTO RACING: ON ASCOT PARK'S LAST NIGHT, TEAM OWNER PULLS OUT ALL THE STOPS IN 
SEARCH FOR HIS FIRST TURKEY NIGHT VICTORY.

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 10 years, Steve Lewis of Laguna Beach was publisher of the most successful 
active sportswear magazine in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Action Sports Retailer magazine became the bible of an industry, inspired by 
the life styles of surfers, volleyball players and skateboarders. The 
magazine's trade shows in Atlantic City and San Diego are mandatory for sports 
enthusiasts seeking the latest fashions. 
</P>
<P>
But after selling the successful enterprise last May, Lewis has concentrated on 
building a racing empire with a spinoff publication. Today, Performance Racing 
Industry magazine has a circulation of 16,000 -- the current issue is 244 pages 
-- and trade shows featuring everything in the motor sports world from 
accessories to marketing tools for races. 
</P>
<P>
But business successes notwithstanding, Lewis has failed in his efforts as a 
car owner to win the annual U.S. Auto Club Turkey Night Midget Grand Prix at 
Ascot Park in Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis has met his share of deadlines as a publisher, but tonight's 50th edition 
of the 100-lap race on Ascot's famed half-mile track inspires a real sense of 
urgency for Lewis and the expected 90 entrants who will vie for 28 starting 
positions. This event is the last one at Ascot Park; the track's lease expires 
Dec. 31, and commercial developers are scheduled to begin construction there in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis attended his first Turkey Night race in 1960 while attending college, and 
was surprised to see Indy car veterans Parnelli Jones, Bobby Unser and A.J. 
Foyt among the entries. 
</P>
<P>
"The stands were packed, and it all looked so intriguing," Lewis said. "Jones 
and Foyt considered midget racing one of the funnest forms of racing. It looked 
like fun, and I wanted to be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis met midget racer Don Horvath and became a "pit stooge," changing tires 
and learning the trade. In 1978, he met chassis builder Don Edmunds and his 
driver, Stan Fox, and became the owner of a racing team that featured Fox. 
</P>
<P>
For 13 years, the bid by Lewis' Performance Racing team to win the Turkey Night 
race has ended in failure, frustration and bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Fox was running second behind Chuck Gurney of Livermore with two 
laps remaining when he ran out of fuel. Teammate Joe Gaerte had to be content 
with finishing sixth. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Lewis has pulled out all stops to win the finale, entering three 
cars. Fox will drive the team's top qualifying car, and Gaerte, whose father 
built the engines, will drive the No. 2 car. 
</P>
<P>
"We're keeping the third car open in case anything unexpected happens," Lewis 
said. "This is my last shot at winning Turkey Night, and all the bullets are in 
the gun. If we win, there will be a lot of relief. Our goal all year was to win 
Turkey Night. A victory would mean all the effort has paid dividends." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis is counting on either Fox, a three-time qualifier for the Indianapolis 
500, or Gaerte, who finished third in the World of Outlaws sprint car series, 
to reach the checkered flag first. 
</P>
<P>
Each will drive an identically prepared car with a chassis built by Bob East of 
Indianapolis. They are capable of reaching a top speed of 100 miles per hour on 
Ascot's half-mile course. 
</P>
<P>
Few open-wheel forms of racing are quicker than midget car racing. The 
900-pound cars produce 300-horsepower with everything designed and functioning 
for one purpose: speed. Midget racing tests a driver's skill and finesse, not 
to mention an owner's pocketbook. Lewis has spent $15,300 for each engine 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Sosbe heads an eight-man mechanical crew whose sole purpose will be to 
ensure that all three cars qualify in two-lap time trials for the main event, 
which is scheduled to begin at about 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis says he is optimistic about his team's chances of winning, noting, "Our 
No. 1 car has set lap records at Ventura and Bakersfield the past two weeks. We 
have the top drivers, mechanics, engine and chassis builders in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been working nonstop for the past three weeks with one thing in mind: 
win Turkey Night. This is our last chance."

Archive Corp., a maker of computer memory backup products, said Wednesday that 
its fiscal 1990 net income fell nearly 25% to $11.5 million from the 
year-earlier $15.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the drop in income, revenue for the year ended Sept. 28 was up 62% to 
$293 million from $181.4 million in fiscal 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the earnings decline in part to its April acquisition of 
Cipher Data Products, which cost $123 million and resulted in the May layoff of 
about 95 people among the two companies' combined 3,200-employee work force. 
</P>
<P>
For its fourth quarter, Archive reported net income of $1.8 million, down 57% 
from $4.2 million in the same period a year earlier. Revenue, however, nearly 
doubled to $94.9 million from $49.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Lewis, Archive's chairman and chief executive, recently attributed the 
soaring revenue to the Cipher acquisition and steady sales of Archive's 
0.25-inch computer cartridge tape drives and controllers. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis said in a statement issued Wednesday that "the outlook for the 
overall economy is uncertain and the computer industry is reporting a softening 
in sales." Archive, he said, "will proceed in 1991 with care to . . . maintain 
expenses in line with revenues." 
</P>
<P>
Archive attended the gigantic Comdex computer show in Las Vegas earlier this 
month with a large exhibit. But the company did say it had implemented a hiring 
freeze because of general concerns about a national recession and more specific 
worries about the sluggishness of the computer market. 
</P>
<P>
Archive's stock price is so depressed that it is now trading below its book 
value -- essentially a corporation's value figured by subtracting all its debts 
from its total assets. Archive's book value is $5.76 per share. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Kilpatrick, president of Newport Securities, recently pointed out that 
Archive is one of a handful of local companies to trade at or below book value. 
The company stock's high for the year is $13.88 a share and its low is $4.25. 
</P>
<P>
Archive's stock -- traded over the counter -- was down 37.5 cents Wednesday to 
close at $5.50.

PHOENIX SUBSIDIARY FILES FOR CHAPTER 11 PROTECTION; 
</P>
<P>
BANKRUPTCY: THOSE FAMILIAR WITH NETCOM RESEARCH, WHICH SAID IT HAD A CONTRACT 
TO SELL COMPUTERS TO THE SOVIET UNION, WERE NOT SURPRISED.

<P>
A subsidiary of the Phoenix Group International, which announced 14 months ago 
that it had a contract to sell millions of computers to the Soviet Union, has 
filed for protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law. 
</P>
<P>
Netcom Research Inc., an operating subsidiary that makes diskless workstations 
for computer networks, listed $1.65 million in liabilities and unspecified 
assets in a Chapter 11 petition filed Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidiary filed the petition to obtain relief from creditors' claims while 
it attempts to secure additional financing, said Mark C. Tow, Netcom's 
bankruptcy attorney in Newport Beach. He said the company would file a list of 
its assets later. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our intent to reorganize the company," he said. "I think the company can 
turn around and function as a viable entity." 
</P>
<P>
The five largest unsecured creditors include Phoenix Group International, which 
is owed $663,910; a partnership including Phoenix Chairman Charles W. Missler, 
owed $372,352; Oracom Data Systems Ltd. in Hong Kong, owed $142,606; Schweber 
Electronics, a London-based computer distributor, owed $141,858; and Bell 
Microproducts in Milpitas, owed $61,568. 
</P>
<P>
Missler, a controversial figure who describes himself as a turnaround artist, 
did not respond to requests for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy filing came as no surprise to those familiar with the Phoenix 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Halperin, a trade consultant in Mission Viejo and former adviser to the 
Phoenix Group, said he believed that the filing was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew the (Soviet) contract was not dated and not properly executed," said 
Halperin, who ended his association with the company in February. "I accepted 
Missler's statements on good faith, but I discovered that they used aggressive 
accounting techniques and were always desperate for cash to meet payroll." 
</P>
<P>
Oak Technology Inc., a Sunnyvale firm that supplied graphics chips for Netcom 
computers, shipped 500 chips to the company in October but never received 
payment for the $8,647 bill, said Thomas Zades, controller. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not really surprised," Zades said. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix Group surprised the personal computer industry when it announced in 
September, 1989, that it had beaten 16 competitors to win a contract to supply 
up to 6 million PCs to schools and businesses in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
But skepticism about the deal emerged quickly in the international trade 
community. Critics questioned why the Soviet negotiators had chosen a 
little-known company with virtually no experience in building personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
International trade specialists said Wednesday that Netcom's bankruptcy filing, 
brought on by financial difficulties of the subsidiary and its parent company, 
is expected to kill the Soviet deal. 
</P>
<P>
In December, signs of problems with the deal surfaced with the departure of two 
top Phoenix executives, Peter C.M.S. von Braun and St. George Tucker Grinnan 
III. Von Braun, former vice chairman and chief executive of the Phoenix Group, 
was a key architect of the Soviet deal. 
</P>
<P>
In court documents filed in Superior Court in Santa Ana late last year in 
conjunction with a former employee's lawsuit against Phoenix, the president of 
a separate Phoenix subsidiary said the company did not have a formal contract 
to sell PCs in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix Group said in January that it had received its first confirmed 
order from the Soviet Union to ship 770 computers. But former employees said at 
the time that the deal was in jeopardy and noted that the company had trouble 
making its payroll. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix subsequently explored subcontracting manufacture of the computers to 
Asian firms, including TriGem Corp., South Korea's largest computer maker and 
maker of Epson computers. But no deal was ever signed. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer, Phoenix Group's stock was dropped from trading on the 
American Stock Exchange, and the company moved out of its headquarters at Park 
Place in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Tow said Wednesday that he did not know if Netcom actually manufactured any 
computers sold to the Soviets.

"Netcom stands alone and should not be tied to Phoenix," said Tow, though he

BRIEFCASE: RETAIL / TOURISM: THEME PARKS OFFER SANTA-SEASON DEALS FOR HOLIDAY

It should come as no surprise that Knott's Berry Farm and Disneyland are ready 
for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Knott's, for the fifth year, has converted its Ghost Town into an 1880s 
Christmas village. 
</P>
<P>
The program starts Saturday and runs through Christmas Eve. The display 
features wandering carolers, 75 decorated Christmas trees, Santa's toy shop, 
Mrs. Claus' kitchen and more than 200 costumed artisans plying their trades. 
For visitors who don't want to pay for rides, the park charges a $2 admission 
for Ghost Town only, with children under 12 free. The payoff for Knott's is all 
the gifts and chicken dinners that are sold to eager Christmas shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland, for its part, is trying to boost holiday attendance with a special 
Mickey's Holiday Workshop package at the Disneyland Hotel. The 1,132-room 
resort is offering a $139 deal to families. It includes one night's 
accommodations, two one-day passes to Disneyland, parking and a visit to 
Mickey's Holiday Workshop, where children can get their picture taken with 
Mickey Mouse. Because just two passes into the park are included, a family of 
three or more must buy more Disneyland tickets to get everyone in. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday Lights: Santa has already arrived at many major malls, but two of the 
county's best-known shopping venues are yet to start their Christmas seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Fashion Island in Newport Beach and South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa have their 
decorations up, but they are planning elaborate tree-lighting ceremonies to 
start the season formally. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Fashion Island boasts of having the largest Christmas tree in 
Orange County -- possibly in Southern California -- with a 110-foot monster 
anchored in concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainer Pat Boone will light the tree at 6:30 p.m. Friday while the crowd 
is dusted with fake snow. Santa will make his entrance earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Plaza will wait until 6:30 p.m. Monday to light its tree and hail 
the entrance of Santa, to the accompaniment of the All American Boys Chorus. 
The tree will not be in the shopping center, however, but across Bristol Street 
in the Town Center commercial area between Anton Boulevard and Town Center 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Themes at Malls: From supporting U.S. troops in the Saudi Arabian desert to 
fighting illiteracy, malls are building themes into their holiday displays this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster Mall has undertaken a sweeping Greetings from Home program to let 
GIs serving in the Persian Gulf area know that they are remembered. 
</P>
<P>
The mall is providing a drop-off station for Mideast-bound packages for 
soldiers and sailors. And through Dec. 2, mall strollers are being encouraged 
to sign a giant greeting card that will be sent to the forces in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills Mall has begun a campaign for literacy awareness. Shoppers and 
store employees are being urged to donate books in good condition to stock the 
library in the Human Options shelter for abused women and their children in 
Laguna Beach. The books will be collected by volunteers near the Buffums store, 
through Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
MacMillan Publishing Co. has donated 2,500 children's books to distribute to 
needy children through the mall's Angel Tree program. A book will be given to 
every child, along with gifts donated by shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Public Library District librarians are volunteering to read 
stories to children and their parents at the mall on Saturday mornings through 
Dec. 22.

<P>
It took nerve for Brian Enright to bring his crystals-cherishing, 
bliss-following New Age magazine to Orange County, an area usually regarded as 
more hospitable to John Wayne than Shirley MacLaine. 
</P>
<P>
The only magazine of its kind in the county, Orange County Resources has 
sometimes faced an uphill battle, dealing with a fragmented community of New 
Age advocates and conservative Christians who have urged distributors to ban 
the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such problems, the 7-year-old magazine has grown from a 16-page 
calendar of events to 68 pages packed with advertisements in its latest issue. 
Distributed free to county retail outlets, it claims a circulation of 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
Enright, the magazine's 45-year-old founder, has successfully exploited an 
increasingly popular twist to the New Age movement: the marriage of 
spiritualism and moneymaking. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like the New Age really has been co-opted by materialism in Southern 
California much more than other places," said Glenn Bradley, who ran a sister 
publication in Los Angeles for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Some recent advertisements in the magazine read: "Have a $$ Million Dollar$$ 
Retirement Program" and "Drive a Mercedes and Be Independently Wealthy in 90 
Days." 
</P>
<P>
"We joke that all of our readers are hippies who drive vans, but it's not 
true," said Enright, an easygoing man who was wearing an aqua-color corduroy 
shirt during a recent interview at his second-floor office in a Huntington 
Beach strip mall. 
</P>
<P>
"The traditional concept of people involved in healing, growth and 
transformation used to say that people who pursued financial prosperity were 
selling out. But a lot of people have learned that they can take ideas of 
integrity and incorporate them into the workplace; for instance, what we're 
doing here. We're producing this publication, and we still eat." 
</P>
<P>
Enright said the most recent issue of Orange County Resources grossed $65,000 
in sales and turned a $5,000 profit. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Chicago, Enright is a salesman by trade. Since moving to Huntington 
Beach in 1966, he has sold insurance, motorcycles, antique and classic cars, 
telephone answering machines and fitness equipment. 
</P>
<P>
About seven years ago he became interested in herbal healing, an interest that 
harked back to his earlier studies in chiropractic medicine. Searching for a 
way to swap information about herbal healing with other local enthusiasts, he 
was discouraged to find only a single bulletin board at a Huntington Beach 
health food store. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, he published a directory of alternative health services modeled after 
Los Angeles Resources magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds corny, but I was sincerely motivated by the need of people who are 
into alternative healing and growth," Enright said. "A need from the humanistic 
point of view, not the business point of view." 
</P>
<P>
He named his magazine Resources after two separately owned publications, Los 
Angeles Resources and San Diego Resources. 
</P>
<P>
Enright borrowed $50,000 and continued working as a part-time salesman to keep 
his magazine going. And he raised another $20,000 by selling his 1935 
Rolls-Royce limousine. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, when the owner of Los Angeles Resources decided to get out of the 
business, Enright bought the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Resources has a small staff, two full-time and two part-time workers, including 
Enright. Besides scores of ads for everything from laser acupuncture to 
past-life therapy, the magazine regularly features music and book reviews, a 
three-month calendar of events and stories on environment and health-related 
topics that are mostly excerpted from books and other alternative magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Resources is distributed to 100 locations, mostly health food 
stores, restaurants, bookstores, chiropractors and holistic health centers. 
</P>
<P>
As Enright has groped his way through his first publishing venture, he admits 
making some blunders. The biggest, he says, was his attempt in 1986 to switch 
from four issues a year to six -- a move that failed financially. 
</P>
<P>
Enright likes to recite the concept, "serve your customers, then your business 
will prosper." With that in mind, he has organized a series of marketing and 
advertising seminars with Harry Pickens, a well-known jazz 
pianist-turned-marketing consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, many people who attended the seminars wound up placing ads in 
Enright's magazine. Advertising revenue is up 15% to 20%. "We wound up creating 
a group of advertisers for us and also boosted our image substantially," 
Enright said. 
</P>
<P>
To support the seminars, Enright installed a toll-free 800 telephone number and 
another computer, sent out mailings, rented hotel rooms and hired a full-time 
marketing person. With the fees attendees pay, the operation will just about 
break even, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Though Enright says most of his advertisers run legitimate businesses, he 
admits that there is a kooky fringe. He doesn't accept sexually explicit ads 
and has rejected requests from satanists and witches. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some conservative Christians have charged that Satan, not 
Enright, runs Orange County Resources and have asked his distributors to remove 
the magazine from their newsstands. Enright is touchy on this issue and 
initially was reluctant to be interviewed for this story, saying he didn't want 
to stir up sentiment against his magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had people come in and say, 'Oh, you shouldn't have that here,' " said 
Jeff Doleman, a salesman at the Fahrenheit 451 bookstore in Laguna Beach. "No 
one has been violent. We just tell them we're in the business of catering to 
people's interests, and this is one thing people around here are interested 
in." 
</P>
<P>
"Satan is not running this magazine," Enright said. "If he were, it would make 
my job a lot easier."

HOW TO ADOPT AN ANIMAL AT THE SANTA ANA ZOO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Always wanted a swamp wallaby? Would you love to have a white-handed gibbon to 
call your very own? You can, through the Something Wild animal adoption program 
sponsored by the Friends of the Santa Ana Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old program allows people to choose an animal on exhibit at the zoo 
to adopt. Even the animals that roam the grounds, such as peafowls, and the 
pond animals -- Japanese koi and western pond turtles -- are available for 
adoption. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 75 animals at the zoo, according to Pat Taylor, executive 
director of the Friends of the Santa Ana Zoo (a nonprofit agency that creates 
awareness of and raises funds for the zoo). 
</P>
<P>
The animals are divided into native land categories, as well as aviary, 
barnyard and education animals. They range from the California king snake to 
the Toco toucan, from the red-backed squirrel monkey to the African-crested 
porcupine. 
</P>
<P>
The adoptions are tax deductible, Taylor said, adding that many people choose 
to give the adoption as a gift. 
</P>
<P>
The following lists the six types of adoption and what you receive. 
</P>
<P>
The $50 Walkabout 
</P>
<P>

ANN CONWAY: RECALLING A YEAR OF SOCIAL STAR POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nice going, Orange County party planners. You've gone and outdone yourself. 
Never has Orange County's social scene been as glitzed-out and power-packed as 
it's been in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
What better day than Thanksgiving, then, to rattle off the reasons we're 
grateful for The Social Year That Was: 
</P>
<P>
Thanks, Mr. Presidents: Four U.S. Presidents made power-lunch history in July 
when the Nixon Library opened in Yorba Linda. Social types could only read 
about this behind-closed-doors affair, but just knowing that it was happening 
in the county they call home was quite enough, thank you. Besides, after the 
presidents -- Bush, Nixon, Reagan and Ford -- dined on watercress and pea soup, 
Dover sole with lemon butter and three kinds of berries dolloped with whipped 
cream, they were on view before thousands of GOP heavy hitters for the 
dedication ceremonies. Such a sight, that sea of social millinery. One regret: 
A Los Angeles restaurant -- namely, Chasen's -- was chosen to cook up the 
cholesterol-conscious menu. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks, L.A. Rams: Once in a lifetime. That's what locals called the 
opportunity to visit Berlin in August to watch the exhibition game between the 
L.A. Rams and the Kansas City Chiefs. Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez and his wife, 
Elaine; Mary and James Roosevelt, and Donna and John Crean were among guests 
aboard Rams owner Georgia Frontiere's fabulous fun jet. Social highlight: a 
two-hour riverboat cruise upon the meandering Havel River with Frontiere -- 
ultra-feminine in blue and green chiffon -- and the team. One snafu: Dinner was 
exceedingly slow in coming, so Marshall Klein -- Frontiere's right arm -- 
played waiter. Such a sight! Starved party-goers will forever be grateful. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks, Carl St. Clair: The debut of the new music director of the Pacific 
Symphony created some heady excitement in October during a party held at the 
Beverly Heritage Hotel. Sweeping into the affair with his girlfriend, Jennifer 
Keeney, maestro St. Clair told the crowd: "Just the beginning!" No need for 
lights at this bash. St. Clair's youthful energy lit up the room. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks, Michael Caine: "Alfie" flew in from London for the tribute to him 
staged by the Los Angeles chapter of the British Academy of Film and Television 
Arts in October. Caine, who played the title role in the 1966 movie, advised 
that life was all about fun. "If you're not having fun, you're not doing it 
right," he said, mingling with members of the Segerstrom family at Alfredo's 
before sweeping into the Westin South Coast Plaza ballroom. Caine and pals -- 
Dudley Moore, Roger Moore, Jackie Collins, Marvin Davis, Patti Austin and Jack 
Haley Jr. -- had fun, all right. And so did locals. They heard Moore play the 
piano (beautifully) and Austin sing Caine's signature song -- "Alfie," of 
course. Special kudos go to Tiffany &amp; Co. for underwriting the very chic 
cocktail reception (where there was so much security provided by the Brits -- 
Princess Alexandra of England was present -- you'd have thought the four 
presidents had returned). 
</P>
<P>
Thanks, Donna and John Crean: No Orange County ballroom has been able to 
compete with the Creans' Tara-like mansion on Newport's Back Bay. Weekend after 
weekend, it has bustled with the biggies. For starters, the couple has staged 
bashes for Vice President Dan Quayle; supporters of Opera Pacific; Supervisor 
Harriett M. Wieder, and state Sen. Marian Bergeson. Not to mention last 
weekend's Silver Screen blowout that saw the likes of Janet Leigh, Milton Berle 
and Danny Thomas mingle with locals over turkey and the trimmings. Why do they 
do it, throw open their Southern Colonial doors week after week after week? 
"What else is a couple to do?" said John, a recreation vehicles manufacturer. 
"Sit home and look at each other?" 
</P>
<P>
Thanks, Dionne Warwick: The woman who sang she'd "never fall in love again" 
fell in love with Orange County enough to come to a private Laguna Beach home 
in August to make a pitch for her Warwick Foundation, an organization dedicated 
to education about blood diseases. Her goal? Nothing less than a superstar 
concert at the Orange County Performing Arts Center to benefit her cause. "I'll 
call everybody," she said. "Stevie Wonder, Whitney Houston, Elton John, Kenny 
Rogers, Quincy Jones, Melissa Manchester, Nancy Wilson." All she needs is money 
to help stage the show. Anybody listening?

WHAT IF YOU WENT TO A FAMILY REUNION AND 1,400 SHOWED UP?; 
</P>
<P>
ROOTS: THE DIONNE FAMILY HAS BECOME SO LARGE THAT IT'S ALSO AN ASSOCIATION; 
FAMILY RESEARCHERS SAY VIRTUALLY EVERY DIONNE IN NORTH AMERICA DESCENDS FROM 
ANTOINE DIONNE, WHO CAME TO QUEBEC FROM FRANCE IN 1663.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a story about a family reunion in Quebec where 1,400 people showed up. 
</P>
<P>
What sort of family would have 1,400 people show up at a reunion? Mine. The 
kind of family that's not so much a family as a political machine. In 1986, 
some folks in Quebec, where the family hails from, organized a group called 
L'Association les Dionne D'Amerique Inc. I got a mailing from them a few years 
back and decided: At last, a special interest group I can support unreservedly. 
</P>
<P>
So please do not expect a fair-minded, objective account. I will be utterly 
dispassionate about Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, 
vegetarians and beef ranchers. But we're talking here about my roots. Did you 
ask Alex Haley to be objective? 
</P>
<P>
The Dionne Assn. most certainly isn't, but it's terribly serious about 
genealogy, heritage and all that. It even puts out a quarterly journal called 
La Voix des Dionne that includes articles with titles such as: "Jean Dionne, 
Known as Sanssoucy, Was He the Father of Antoine?" 
</P>
<P>
Don't scoff. In the course of the weekend reunion, I learned that questions 
like that are not trivial. If the Dionne Assn. has an ideology, it might be 
called Antoinism. The idea is that virtually every Dionne in North America 
descends from the same ancestor, Antoine Dionne, who came to Quebec from France 
in 1663. That means I can finally give an answer to a question I've been asked 
all my life: Yes, I am related to the Dionne Quintuplets, through Antoine at 
least. 
</P>
<P>
I also learned that Antoine and Catherine Ivory, his wife, had 12 children, but 
only six survived, including only one son, Jean Dionne (1670-1752). So we all 
descend from Jean too, and "The Great Dionne Gathering of America," held here 
Aug. 4 and 5, was designed as a celebration of the 320th anniversary of Jean's 
birth. 
</P>
<P>
I was suspicious at the beginning of Antoinism, and its corollary, Jeanism. I 
kept thinking of some poor Dionne way back there whom we've cast into the 
dustbin of genealogy. But the organizers were quite convincing about all the 
work they'd done to establish the truth of Antoinism. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the sense of solidarity created by a common ancestor was nothing to 
sneer at. Never had I been to a convention where the words "we" and "us" 
carried quite the same meaning. When I apologized to someone I collided with in 
the lobby, he just gave me a broad grin. "Don't worry," he said. "We're all 
Dionnes here." That doesn't happen at the local Safeway. 
</P>
<P>
To get all these people together, the Dionne Assn. mailed invitations to every 
Dionne in every phone book in North America; about 6,000 pieces of mail were 
sent out last winter. When I got mine, my reporter's instinct was to sense a 
scam. But with a $50 registration fee for the weekend, I figured there wasn't 
much money to be made. Besides, when a Dionne I met in the lobby found out I 
was a reporter, he made me promise that I wasn't there pursuing a story about 
"Dionnegate." I promised, so forget about the scam angle. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that this sort of reunion, while unusual, was not unprecedented 
for families in Quebec. Giles Dionne, president of the association, said that 
popular interest in genealogy and family history has grown over 15 years 
side-by-side with the resurgence of Quebec nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
But Giles, a former official of the Quebec Ministry of Education, said the main 
motivation lay in "the search for identity" that seems to so preoccupy modern 
men and women. "We can't find our identity without returning to our roots," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
France Dionne, who represents this area in the Quebec National Assembly, said 
the Dionnes were slow to organize compared with some other large Quebec 
families, such as the Ouelettes and the Tremblays. She said she welcomed the 
Dionnes' coming of age organizationally, but didn't expect all that much 
political benefit herself. A shrewd vote counter, she said the Dionnes were too 
scattered to be all that much of a bloc. 
</P>
<P>
The Dionnes came to Riviere-du-Loup from just about everywhere -- from all over 
Quebec and Canada and from places in the United States as far away as Alaska, 
California and New Iberia, La. Wendy Dionne Gianotti came all the way from 
Milan. "For all the world, I never knew I had so many cousins," Joe Dionne, one 
of the American contingent, told about 200 Dionnes who had gathered for a 
seminar on family history. "Hello, y'all!" 
</P>
<P>
All those Dionnes in one place created some problems. If your last name is 
Dionne and you live anywhere in the United States outside of Maine, you rarely 
get confused with anyone else. It's not like being a Jones or a Smith or a 
Sullivan. But when I arrived at the Avis counter in Quebec City, I had to sort 
through five separate Dionne reservations. 
</P>
<P>
That was only the beginning. At the Motel Universel in Riviere-du-Loup, the 
center of the reunion, almost everything was done by first name, but even that 
didn't always help. When I went to register for the conference, there were five 
different Eugene Dionnes on the list, none of them me. 
</P>
<P>
You would think that if we're all in the same family, we'd look alike. No way. 
Staring at the crowd in the lobby, people looked about as related as the folks 
at a VFW meeting or a union convention -- Dionnes come in every imaginable size 
and shape. It is, you might say, a highly varied gene pool, Antoine or no 
Antoine. 
</P>
<P>
But Wendy Dionne Gianotti did come up with one common characteristic. "You just 
follow the noses," she said, staring at the crowd. "I haven't seen any small 
ones." I actually did find some, but you had to look hard. 
</P>
<P>
The main events of the weekend besides the big banquet were a family history 
seminar on a Saturday afternoon, organized by Raymond Dionne, a junior college 
teacher who lives near Quebec City, and a Sunday bus tour of famous Dionne 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
There was also a Sunday Mass concelebrated by Bishop Gerard Dionne of New 
Brunswick ("I'm the bishop of the Dionnes," he told his cousinly flock) and six 
Fathers Dionne. We are, we were told, a very religious, very Catholic family, 
which wasn't surprising: The first Jean Dionne spent two years, 1667 and 1668, 
living with the Jesuits. I took this as an explanation of my family Jesuitical 
turn of mind, its tendency to argue happily for hours fine points of dogma on 
any subject. 
</P>
<P>
Or perhaps it's Talmudic-Jesuitical. Among the interesting discoveries of the 
weekend was the existence of some Jewish Dionnes in the United States. Francine 
Dionne of Silver Spring, a specialist on Third World development, reported that 
there are quite a few Dionnes in Senegal. (Unfortunately, none of them came.) 
For good measure, I ran into an Episcopalian Dionne and a Mormon Dionne. Move 
over, Jesse Jackson: We Dionnes are the real Rainbow Coalition -- a French 
Canadian Catholic American Black Jewish Protestant family. 
</P>
<P>
I also learned that while there are an estimated 25,000 Dionnes in this 
hemisphere, there are almost no Dionnes left in France -- the association 
counted only 25 families in the whole country. 
</P>
<P>
This is a matter I hope the researchers at the Dionne Assn. pursue. But the 
absence of knowledge allowed for much speculation about the shortage of Dionnes 
in France. Norman Dionne of Arlington, Mass., wondered if maybe the Jewish 
Dionnes were really the original ones, and that someone converted to 
Catholicism somewhere along the line. On this theory, we're all migrants from 
Eastern Europe who just kept heading west to Canada. The factual basis for this 
view, Norman acknowledged, is nonexistent. But there may be a movie in it 
somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Dionne of Springfield, Vt., opted for a simpler explanation: that where 
the Old World had been hostile to the Dionnes, the New World had been 
thoroughly hospitable. He liked this idea, since it made us a thoroughly New 
World family. 
</P>
<P>
Without doubt, the highlights of the evening were the performances of three 
different Dionne rock stars of the future, all three of them women. I thought 
of them as Tiffany Dionne, Madonna Dionne and Paula Abdul Dionne. Tiffany was 
17-year-old Vicky Dionne, known onstage simply as Vicky. Nadine Dionne, 24, is 
more innocent than Madonna offstage, but was thoroughly tough and (if you can 
say this about a distant cousin) sexy onstage. Isabelle Dionne, 20, had a 
strong voice and brought the crowd to its feet with renditions of several pop 
tunes that are much loved in Quebec. Look for all three in your record stores 
someday. 
</P>
<P>
To mix things up, John Dionne's family of six daughters and two sons performed 
a thoroughly wholesome set of traditional tunes, and Vincent Dionne, a 
classical musician by training, offered the crowd some new age numbers. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the reunion, the question remained: Why in the world did we all 
come? 
</P>
<P>
For many in the American wing, the answer was simple curiosity. Nicolas Dionne, 
15, of Fredonia, N.Y., said he had never met any Dionnes except his close 
cousins. His 8-year-old sister, Marissa, pronounced herself quite satisfied 
with the state of the Dionnes. "I like them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Georgette Dionne Jebb, 34, a teacher who lives outside Buffalo, said that in a 
world in which families are separated by distance, and sometimes by dissension, 
"it's very hard to get a sense of continuity." 
</P>
<P>
"When you received that letter," she added, "you suddenly knew there were a lot 
of people out there." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Todd Jebb, said the reunion was popular for the same reason Alex 
Haley's "Roots" was popular: "There's a psychological desire to know where you 
came from." 
</P>
<P>
Father Earl Dionne of North Fond-du-Lac, Wis., saw the whole thing as a sort of 
ego trip for everyone, a quest for the satisfactions that come from feeling 
welcomed by a very large extended family. 
</P>
<P>
As for me, I eschew all complex psychological explanations and will simply 
agree with Marissa Dionne: I liked them too.

RANDY LEWIS: THANKS, AND NO THANKS

<P>
Competition has been exceptionally stiff for this year's Turkey Awards, which 
are bestowed upon those individuals and institutions in Orange County whose 
actions have made us ponder where it was we left that chopping block. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The contenders have been many, from city officials who insist that arts groups 
stick to material that offends no one, to radio station deejays who try to 
increase their ratings by insulting recent immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
But enough preliminaries: Let the Turkeys begin! 
</P>
<P>
* The Festival of Britain. This was the event that towered above the rest this 
year in making arts lovers wonder whether the craniums of some of our cultural 
impresarios aren't stuffed with day-old Wonder bread instead of brain cells. 
This "festival" began as a merchandising scheme, dreamed up two years ago by 
South Coast Plaza mall officials both to boost their sales and to improve trade 
relations between the United States and the United Kingdom. Fine so far. But 
then they got the notion that they could klass up the jernt by slapping their 
"Festival of Britain" logo on dozens of arts events, most of which would have 
taken place anyway. While all this questionable nonsense provided some 
beneficial side effects to various Orange County arts groups, BritFest 
nevertheless reduced the status of the participating artists to that of a 
greedy organ grinder's monkeys. And it left the taste of stale mutton in the 
mouths of anyone who expected a genuine arts festival -- where arts, not yuppie 
commerce, is the motivating principle. 
</P>
<P>
* The City of Costa Mesa. For what? Let us count the ways. The self-proclaimed 
"City of the Arts" decided to start the new decade on the right(wing) foot by 
jumping aboard the bandwagon and restricting ways that city arts grant 
recipients can spend their money. Instead of firmly backing the notion that 
artistic freedom of thought should be encouraged and fostered by local 
government -- as the city of Los Angeles did at about the same time -- Costa 
Mesa officials hoped to assuage two vociferous critics of local arts groups 
(see John and Ernie Feeney, below) by caving in to their demands. As it 
happened, council members were somewhat thwarted by their city attorney, who 
reminded them about that pesky document known as the Constitution. Guidelines 
that were adopted essentially repeat existing state law, while still leaving it 
to city officials, rather than the courts, to determine definitions of 
obscenity. Very disturbing: Before passage of these "anti-obscenity" 
guidelines, not one city arts group had ever been accused, much less found 
guilty, of producing or presenting an obscene work. It's also worth noting that 
while haggling over how its $175,000 in city arts grants might be spent, the 
council never batted an eye, nor attached a string, in approving $400,000 from 
the general fund to help promote -- ta-da! -- the Festival of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
* KEZY-FM disc jockey Chris Little. He's the pea-brain who came up with the 
"Foreign or Domestic" game show in which call-in contestants were invited to 
guess, as he phoned up neighborhood convenience stores, whether the clerk who 
answered was "Foreign or Domestic." Here's a suggestion for the National League 
of Convenience Store Clerks: Phone KEZY-FM and have their members guess whether 
the deejay who answers is "Human or Moron." After a storm of protest, during 
which Little defended his brain(dead)child and claimed "You've got to go with 
the majority," station management finally became convinced that this stunt was 
just a tad racist and dropped it. 
</P>
<P>
* The Orange County Performing Arts Center. The Center's cutting-edge 
theatrical productions, such as this summer's umpteenth restaging of "A Funny 
Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum," apparently are doing great business 
with the Invisible Man and Woman segment of our population, judging from the 
33% turnout at the ticket window. Four years after opening, Center officials 
still can't find a way to work in a pop-music series with some of the acts that 
bypassed Orange County for lack of an available 2,000- to 3,000-seat theater: 
Van Morrison, Sinead O'Connor, Jackson Browne and South Africa's Johnny Clegg 
&amp; Savuka. There was, however, room on the schedule for outside promoters to 
present Warren Miller's latest ski film and impressionist Rich Little's pithy, 
sophisticated political observations about the Middle East crisis, to wit, 
"(Let's) beat the hell out of those towel-heads." 
</P>
<P>
* Newport Harbor Art Museum's board of directors. Upon the departures of 
director Kevin Consey and curator Paul Schimmel, the board, led by billionaire 
developer Donald L. Bren, fired renowned architect Renzo Piano as designer of a 
new $20-million building. The board then sought designs from a New York 
architect who has never designed an art museum, and whose work generally is 
considered more conventional than the flamboyant buildings for which Piano is 
known. Corporate timidity wins over artistic vision. Again. 
</P>
<P>
* John and Ernie Feeney. The Costa Mesa residents led attacks on Orange County 
arts groups -- first against South Coast Repertory, because they suspected that 
the theater company had used city money to pay for a flyer urging support for 
the National Endowment for the Arts, then against the tiny Costa Mesa Civic 
Playhouse for its production of Christopher Durang's caustic tract on 
Catholicism, "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You." This Turkey Award 
is not for the Feeneys' outrage, as dutifully expressed to their elected 
representatives, but for their insistence that the city sponsor only those 
artistic endeavors that conform to the Feeneys' standards of decency. 
</P>
<P>
* South Coast Repertory. Officials at our esteemed, Tony Award-winning theater 
troupe have shown all the backbone of an earthworm when under attack from such 
conservative critics as the Feeneys and certain members of the Costa Mesa City 
Council. Only at the last minute, and after some press criticism, did they find 
time last weekend to attend a major statewide arts conference on freedom of 
expression. Yet co-founder David Emmes didn't have any trouble finding time in 
his busy schedule to aggressively promote the Festival of Britain, which was 
co-sponsored by the city, South Coast Plaza and the British government. Maybe a 
pending $20,000 BritFest grant for SCR helped calm the seas? 
</P>
<P>
* Underachieving public-school administrators. To stuffy educators who have 
banned, or have tried to ban, Bart Simpson T-shirts from local schoolyards. 
It's bad enough that kids are being graduated from high schools without the 
ability to read. Now some educators would send them out into the world minus a 
sense of humor too. As Bart told his do-gooder neighbor in a recent episode: 
"Get bent." 
</P>
<P>
* The Orange County Airport Arts Commission. It's pretty embarrassing in a 
county of more than 2 million people, one with an annual budget of about $3 
billion, that for the last several years our Board of Supervisors has allocated 
less money for arts support than the cost of a plain burrito at Taco Bell. To 
wit: zero. Nein. Zilch. And when they finally did cough up a few thousand bucks 
this year, what did it go for? Art exhibits in the airport. The topper is that 
even after that, internal squabbling over the initial exhibit has cast doubts 
on the future of the program. 
</P>
<P>
* New Kids on the Block. No, not for any lip-syncing they may have perpetrated 
on fans during their September concerts at the Pacific Amphitheatre. The big 
Turkey goes to Kid Donnie Wahlberg for his unforgivable, public humiliation of 
a fan who he thought said something derogatory to him. If that wasn't enough, 
when another fan tried to pay respects and throw him a stuffed teddy bear, he 
rewarded her -- by kicking her gift back into the audience and admonishing, 
"You oughta stop throwing things." Yeah -- like their money and affection. 
</P>
<P>
And now, spleen vented, we also take the opportunity to give thanks for those 
events and people who made all those turkeys a little easier to endure. 
</P>
<P>
* The Grove Shakespeare Festival. Somehow, they've managed to hang in despite 
having to deal with some City Council types who could give a protozoa a 
superiority complex. They'd do themselves, and those of us who admire their 
work, a favor by getting more aggressive and creative about finding alternative 
funding sources, so they might at last wean themselves from the city's 
ever-stingier teat. But even with the money hassles, they've come through again 
this year with stellar moments in classical theater. A special toast to the 
anonymous but outspoken donor who pulled the 1990 season out of the fire with a 
last-minute $10,000 check. Take the kids to see the company's annual production 
of Dylan Thomas' "A Child's Christmas in Wales," and see for yourself why the 
Grove can engender such tangible expressions of admiration and generosity from 
a patron. 
</P>
<P>
Another nod to actors Elizabeth Norment and David Drummond for their polished, 
accomplished and lively performances last summer in the lead roles of "As You 
Like It" and "Much Ado About Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
* The Irvine Barclay Theatre. Orange County's newest performing arts center is 
off to an impressively eclectic start with its bookings -- everything from 
local orchestras and community ballet groups to such larger-caliber imports as 
England's Hull Truck Theatre company, and even some pop music acts. Maybe the 
example set by theater President Doug Rankin will provide an inspirational jab 
to its bigger, stodgier older brother in Costa Mesa. And maybe someday hippos 
will fly. 
</P>
<P>
* Chris Gaffney &amp; the Cold Hard Facts. Even though people know they're a 
fraud now, maybe even because people know they're a fraud now, Milli Vanilli 
still will probably move more albums this week than Gaffney will move in a 
year. But this Costa Mesa-based singer, songwriter, accordionist and guitarist 
and his crack outfit have livened up many a night during 1990 with their 
insightful, inciteful and 100%-real country music. As scintillating as the 
band's debut album is, it still only hints at the power and vitality of Gaffney 
&amp; Co. in person. Proof, once again, that all the music that glitters isn't 
necessarily gold. 
</P>
<P>
* The Anaheim City Council. When a group of 2 Live Crew critics demanded that 
it ban the group from appearing at the Celebrity Theatre, the council did the 
right thing and refused. As it turned out, consumers spoke louder than would-be 
censors, leaving the hall nearly two-thirds empty when the 
mediocre-but-celebrated rappers appeared earlier this month. Crew leader Luther 
Campbell has the constitutional right to spew his crude, gutter-level tirades 
against women; he's finding out now, however, that a national furor doesn't 
always result in ticket sales.

THIS 'SHERLOCK HOLMES' STILL LIES DEAD ON TABLE

<P>
"Sherlock Holmes" is a creaky old melodrama that cries out for the 
swashbuckling heroics of a matinee idol like William Gillette, for whom it was 
created at the turn of the last century. Its current incarnation at the Newport 
Theatre Arts Center is a hollow parody with neither a romantic heartbeat nor a 
genuine comic sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
Director John Alexander Lee force-feeds the geriatric script with bits of stagy 
humor and some broad looks, but the body of the work still lies dead on the 
table. Musical interludes that obviously are intended to be lively fall flat, 
and the voice-over of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle drones through the scene changes 
like so many commercial breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Lee takes every opportunity to recapitulate the plot, which admittedly is 
serpentine, but to no avail. The logic of the proceedings ultimately is 
obliterated by the full-speed-ahead, clip-those-consonants style of the 
performance, in which all moments are played at one unyielding speed and 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the performers manage to shine through the veneer. As the 
damsel-in-distress, Debbie Grattan has a rich voice, a graceful bearing and 
enough feeling for a proper heroine. The villainous Moriarty, played by Bruce 
T. Campbell, musters an effectively lower-key delivery that oozes with disdain. 
Lisa Marie Chiu is sweet-faced and unaffected as Terese, and Norm Eneim gives 
his Billy some gusto. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Kawaja has some delightful moments as the ever-ready and resourceful 
assistant to Holmes, John Forman. Kawaja has created a character who is 
enjoying himself -- and that enjoyment is the element most missing from the 
performance of Ken Meyers as Sherlock Holmes. Meyers' Holmes is a heartless 
patrician who plays at everything and seems bored by it all. 
</P>
<P>
The beautiful sets with their period feel by Gil Morales and stylish costumes 
by Lia M. Hansen are wasted on this unreconstructed fossil of a play.

HIGHLAND PARK: A YOUTH COUNSELOR PAINTS MURALS WITH THE COMMUNITY'S HELP, USING 
A VISUAL STYLE DERIVED FROM GRAFFITI OF THE GANGS HE IS TRYING TO COMBAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's been three years since the face of Jesus appeared on the side of the 
Highland Park movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
It is in no way a remarkable work, artistically speaking. Even its painter, 
Peter Quezada, today winces when he thinks of its primitive technique. 
</P>
<P>
But Quezada's first mural, like almost all of his that have followed, has one 
greatly redeeming quality. It has never been defaced by graffiti. The face of 
Jesus has become the permanent replacement for the gang writings and "tags," or 
stylized signatures, that for years kept appearing on the inviting beige wall 
on Avenue 56. 
</P>
<P>
Quezada does not fancy himself a muralist. He calls himself "Painter Pete" or 
"Pied Piper." He uses murals to keep street kids involved in activities that 
are acceptable to adults. A few years ago, a graffiti artist put a spray can in 
Quezada's hand and taught him to use it. He started painting with the kids and 
putting ideas into their heads about respecting property and staying away from 
gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The murals they paint don't look that much different from the ones painted by 
outlaw graffiti artists in the middle of the night. They include gang totems, 
gang lettering and such popular images as Betty Boop, the Lakers and the Zig 
Zag man. In place of the usual graffiti writers' signatures, each bears a 
symbolic scroll of the names of the youngsters Quezada recruited to work on it. 
But each also has enough Madison Avenue to make it work for the business 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike's Transmission," says one in Old English script. "Let's Just Get High on 
Life," says another. 
</P>
<P>
The murals are "corny but effective," said Quezada, 35, who in 1986 quit his 
job as an assistant bank manager to become a street counselor. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Quezada is struggling as the president and entire staff of Neighborhoods 
For Peace, a nonprofit corporation whose purpose is to put Quezada on the 
streets with kids. He works out of a Highland Park law office, which allows him 
to use a desk and office equipment. 
</P>
<P>
He has gotten by on small donations and a couple of formal grants. His goal is 
to open a youth center in northeast Los Angeles where he can work full time 
talking to kids, steering them out of trouble, lining them up for work and 
leading them out on the streets to paint out graffiti in the only way he 
believes will work. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to educate the city," he said. "They have a program called Operation 
Clean Sweep. Paint is available to any community group that wants to paint out 
graffiti, paint in quantities you can only dream of. But after you do your 
graffiti wipeout, it comes gradually back. And so I try to tell the people what 
is successful are murals. Youth counseling is also very successful. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to spend a lot of hours in the street with the kids. You have to find 
a lot of alternatives to their energies when they get out of school at 3 
o'clock," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's impossible to measure the effectiveness of Quezada's unusual approach to 
gang counseling. But because of the demands of finding funding for the 
organization, he has never been able to apply himself consistently to working 
directly with kids. And this summer saw the most violent eruption of gang 
violence in Highland Park's history. 
</P>
<P>
But the effect of his painting is well established. Quezada has painted about a 
dozen murals in the past two years, all on walls where previous efforts to 
control graffiti had failed. Not one has been seriously defaced. 
</P>
<P>
Quezada has never had trouble attracting believers. On his board of directors 
are members of Highland Park's Kiwanis Club, Optimist Club and Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the members of the board have a strong personal commitment to Quezada 
that goes back to the years when he worked as a teller in the Security Pacific 
Bank on Figueroa Street. After work, he would go out on the streets to paint 
out graffiti and talk common sense to teen-agers who were heading toward gang 
membership but were still too young to join. He called them puppies. 
</P>
<P>
"They're no longer puppies," he said. "They're fully grown adult dogs now. 
They're 18, 19 and 20, and they kill people. When I first got them at 15 and 
16, and even 14, they could have been worked with." 
</P>
<P>
After two job transfers, Quezada ended up downtown, at 6th and Flower streets. 
One of his duties was to wait on Robert Hastings, the 80-year-old philanthropic 
partner of the law firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp; Walker. 
</P>
<P>
When Quezada quit in 1986 to begin full-time street counseling, Hastings looked 
him up. 
</P>
<P>
"I had enormous respect for him for quitting a job and taking on this work," 
Hastings said. "I went out with him and cased some of the walls before and 
after and got very much interested in the darn stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Quezada worked three years with the Los Angeles Community Youth Gang Services 
under a grant called the Northeast Los Angeles Graffiti Abatement Contract. 
</P>
<P>
He is critical of the effectiveness of the city's anti-graffiti program. "They 
have what they call making contacts," Quezada said. " 'What'd you do today?' 
'Oh, we made contact. We found out, like what's happening.' I go, 'Is that it? 
That's ridiculous.' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not bitter," he said. But "it's hard to get your desire across in words. 
It's best done in the streets." 
</P>
<P>
When the grant ran out last year, Quezada decided to go independent. Hastings 
backed him with a seed donation of $10,000 and had his law firm prepare 
articles of incorporation for Neighborhoods For Peace. Quezada went into the 
northeast communities to recruit board members and dig up donations. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't been easy. "You can go to a merchant whose wall is covered with 
graffiti and say, 'I'll take it off and put the name of your liquor store 
there. I'll throw it up on the wall for you. Anything you want, a car, a girl, 
a nature setting. And they won't pay for it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Donations have come in, most of them small. The largest was $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
The money, which went primarily to pay Quezada's $1,300-a-month salary, ran out 
in October. A $5,000 grant from the Lluella Morey Murphey Foundation has given 
Neighborhoods For Peace a few more months to operate. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Quezada is applying for four more grants, work he does not find 
rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I don't really like my job because I'm working on grant proposals. 
For the last month and a half now, I've been indoors. The kids I was working 
with, they're still out there." 
</P>
<P>
These days, Quezada is thinking of going back to work in banking. "I can't be 
looking over my shoulder the way I have all this time," he said. "I'm tired of 
the uncertainty" of always making do and struggling to locate funds. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings isn't giving up yet. Corporate money is available, he said, if Quezada 
can build a stronger base in his community. 
</P>
<P>
"By God, we need more financial support, even if it isn't in large amounts," 
Hastings said, challenging Quezada to redouble his effort with local 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to get this damn thing off the ground only because of Peter," he 
said. "Anything I say about Peter you can double in spades because he's a hell 
of a guy."

COUNCIL DELAYS ACTION ON HILLSIDE BUILDINGS; 
</P>
<P>
LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE: A MEETING IS SCHEDULED DEC. 3 TO DISCUSS THE SIZE AND 
TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION THAT WOULD BE ALLOWED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Action on a proposal to impose strict new rules on hillside development in La 
Canada Flintridge was postponed for two weeks Monday after the City Council 
bogged down in lengthy discussions on other development standards. 
</P>
<P>
After a year of study by the city's Planning Department and Planning 
Commission, the council was scheduled to decide the sizes and types of 
buildings that would be permitted on hillsides, which contain the only 
significant amount of developable land remaining in the city. 
</P>
<P>
But the council postponed action until Dec. 3 after Monday's public session ran 
until almost midnight. Much of the evening's discussion focused on recently 
adopted building restrictions designed to curtail a proliferation of oversized 
houses being developed on undersized lots. 
</P>
<P>
New hillside development standards recommended by the Planning Commission would 
require that construction be more sensitive to the character of neighborhoods 
and compatible in architectural design. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed regulations suggest that new or remodeled structures in the hills be 
designed to blend in with the wooded, natural terrain, "rather than creating 
monumental homes that are highly visible." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would also severely limit the amount of hillside grading permitted 
for development and would preserve prominent land forms, such as ridges, 
knolls, valleys and creeks.

An Eagle Rock man was beaten and stabbed outside his house late Saturday night 
by a group of young men, Los Angeles police said.

early 20s, said Detective Joe Friend.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY AGREES TO RENEW AMBULANCE CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council on Tuesday ordered Fire Chief John Montenero to 
negotiate a new contract with Professional Ambulance Service, which has 
provided paramedic and ambulance services to the city since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Council members decided to continue working with the Glendale firm because no 
other companies submitted bids to provide the service. 
</P>
<P>
Montenero recommended that the Fire Department not take over the paramedic 
services. He said an internal study determined that such a move would be too 
expensive or would detract from the department's ability to carry out its 
firefighting duties. 
</P>
<P>
Professional Ambulance's contract with the city expires Feb. 24. Last May, the 
city invited 10 companies to submit bids for a new contract for paramedic 
services. Montenero said five companies sent representatives to a pre-bid 
conference in June, but only Professional Ambulance submitted a bid. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Zarian and councilmen Carl Raggio and Jerold Milner supported a 
motion to suspend the bidding process and renegotiate with Professional 
Ambulance. Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg, who has criticized the company's 
service, voted no. Councilman Richard Jutras was absent.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL DELAYS VOTE ON BRUSH REMOVAL LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council on Tuesday delayed a final vote on a sweeping brush 
fire prevention ordinance that would require firefighters to check 13,000 
hillside lots for vegetation that could fuel a fast-moving blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Adoption of the measure, which received preliminary approval last week, was 
postponed after homeowner associations complained that it did not give property 
owners enough time to comply with an order to remove brush. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, firefighters could order a property owner to clear hazardous brush 
within 15 days. If not done, the city could send crews to clear the brush 10 
days later and bill the owner for the removal costs. 
</P>
<P>
City staff members agreed to review the notification guidelines and return the 
measure to the council Dec. 4.
