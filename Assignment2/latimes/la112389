The South Korean Ministry of Transportation ordered Korean Air to suspend its 
weekly service to and from Tripoli, Libya, for two months after Jan. 1. The 
ministry acted after concluding that the crash of a Korean Air DC-10 at Tripoli 
airport last July 27 was caused by pilot and flight crew error. The airplane 
crashed in dense fog, killing 80 people and injuring 139 others. The ministry 
said it also plans to scrutinize Korean Air's operations in December to see 
whether it is abiding by safety regulations as well as properly maintaining its 
fleet of airplanes.

The family of two slain human rights lawyers demanded an independent judicial

murders. Mbasa Mxenge, 25, asked President Frederik W. de Klerk to order an 
inquiry into the killings of his father, Griffiths, in 1981 and his mother, 
Victoria, in 1985. An ex-police captain has said he led a death squad from 
1980-1982.

Two more children died as a result of the tornado that smashed down a cafeteria 
wall at East Coldenham Elementary School near Newburgh, N.Y., last Thursday, 
bringing the toll to nine. Mark Flanagan, 7, was declared brain dead after a 
series of tests, and 8-year-old Jennifer Homan died of "brain death secondary 
to multiple trauma," a hospital spokesman said. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo ordered an 
investigation into the disaster. Sixteen other children were injured when the 
tornado struck. Nine remained hospitalized.

ROSE MURPHY; POP SINGER OF '40S, '50S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rose Murphy, the bountiful bundle of energy known as "The Chee-Chee Girl" for 
her bird-like vocal interpretations of several popular tunes of the 1940s and 
'50s, has died in New York City, where she had lived for many years. 
</P>
<P>
She was 76 and died Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Her high-pitched rendition of such popular standards as "I Can't Give You 
Anything but Love," "Cecilia," "Coquette" and "Honeysuckle Rose" on records and 
in nightclubs delighted America more than 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
She would sing, chirp and hum those and other melodies in her high-pitched 
voice, periodically substituting "chee-chee" for a word in the lyric. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles favorite for many years at Jim Otto's Steak House on La Cienega 
where she was the intermission pianist for the old Nat (King) Cole Trio, Miss 
Murphy was born in Ohio where she began playing piano in the third grade. By 
1939 she was working at New York's Famous Door Club playing between sets of the 
Count Basie band. 
</P>
<P>
In 1948 she made her first records for Majestic and the results became popular 
favorites of that time. In clubs she sang, played and exchanged banter with her 
audience and was likened to Fats Waller for her ability to find new humor in 
old standards. 
</P>
<P>
Her last local appearance was in 1987 at the Cinegrill in the Hollywood 
Roosevelt Hotel.

AL MARTINEZ: ONE FLEW OVER THE TURKEY NEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I suspected it might happen. By mentioning cat-sacrificing at Halloween and 
turkey-eating at Thanksgiving, I have incurred the wrath of animal activists 
within my readership zone. 
</P>
<P>
They have gotten up off their knees, where they have been praying for wounded 
sperm whales and the souls of dead dogs, long enough to telephone and call me 
names. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, who said she was a member of Compassion for Animals, asked angrily 
how would I like to have my head cut off and be served, roasted and stuffed, 
for dinner today? 
</P>
<P>
I had to reply I would not like that at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it!" she said triumphantly, and hung up. 
</P>
<P>
The column that got them riled made only passing reference to the fate of 
turkeys on Thanksgiving and to the ritual of sacrificing cats on Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
My main concern in the essay was for the human wreckage on Skid Row and all 
those others who drift through life without hope of moral redemption. 
</P>
<P>
The animal activists who called didn't even mention them. Let the fools shuffle 
by as best they can, I guess, but please, God, save the turkey. 
</P>
<P>
I am not a cruel person. I do not advocate the random killing and eating of 
rhinos and bald eagles, of which there are too few in the world, and you will 
not find me slaughtering elephants on the Masai Mara. 
</P>
<P>
But we are, after all, omnivorous creatures, and as such will eat anything that 
doesn't eat us first. The turkey, alas, falls into a category of delicacies 
consumed with impunity. 
</P>
<P>
On that subject, one animal activist who telephoned called my attention to a 
letter that appeared in The Times several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The letter challenged the term "Turkey Day" and suggested that since we do not 
eat our mothers on Mother's Day, why do we eat turkeys on Turkey Day? 
</P>
<P>
We should honor the bird, it concluded, instead of "twisting off the dead 
animals's neck and breaking its bones while swallowing pieces of the corpse." 
</P>
<P>
Powerful stuff. 
</P>
<P>
The caller was particularly concerned about the care and treatment of turkeys 
before their deaths. If we insist on eating them, shouldn't we at least provide 
adequate housing during their short and anguished lives? 
</P>
<P>
Turkeys, the caller said, lived in "cramped wire cages" and had their beaks 
ripped off to avoid pecking each other "in the often cannibalistic panic 
brought on by their crowded living conditions." 
</P>
<P>
I learned later he was getting his information from a press release issued by 
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an organization whose members wear 
T-shirts that say, "I don't eat my friends." 
</P>
<P>
Each to his own epiphany. 
</P>
<P>
"Turkeys live a lousy life," the caller said, his voice rising, "and you're a 
part of their torture!" 
</P>
<P>
Click. 
</P>
<P>
After a day of harassment by angry people, I telephoned the National Turkey 
Federation in Virginia to ask if the cruelty charges were true. 
</P>
<P>
"Nonsense," said Eddie Aldrete, director of public affairs for the federation. 
</P>
<P>
"Turkeys are not raised in 'cramped wire cages' but in expensive, 
scientifically designed, environmentally controlled buildings as big as 
football fields." 
</P>
<P>
He made it sound like a Club Med for turkeys. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie went on to say that a turkey requires only 2.7 square feet of living 
space to be happy but is given 4 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
"That's more than the Japanese get on their little islands," I said jokingly, 
but Eddie is not one to joke about turkeys. 
</P>
<P>
Later he would point out that his license plate reads EAT TRKY and his boss' 
plate reads GOBBLE. 
</P>
<P>
"What about the charge that you rip off their beaks in a cruel and unusual 
manner?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie sighed. One could almost see him shaking his head, weary of answering the 
same old accusations. 
</P>
<P>
"You clip your toenails, right?" Eddie asked. "Well, each turkey gets the top 
of his beak clipped once in its lifetime. The process is about as painful as 
manicuring your toenails." 
</P>
<P>
That is done out of compassion, he said, so that the little darlings don't hurt 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie added: "Turkeys are happy and well-treated. We do not thrive on tortured 
birds. Stressed turkeys produce tough meat." 
</P>
<P>
Now you've heard both sides. If you are inclined to eat turkey today, eat it 
knowing its last days were spent in a kind of Grand Turkey Hyatt, with wine and 
laughter. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't believe that, eat tofu, as Eddie said, and bean sprouts. I respect 
your right to dine as you like. Please respect mine. 
</P>
<P>
We're having dolphin.

It's a sign of the times that Nordstrom department stores has been solemnly 
promising in its advertisements that "you won't find any Christmas trim in our 
stores until after Thanksgiving is over." 
</P>
<P>
The Alliance for Survival is holding a different kind of Christmas toy party in 
Santa Monica on Saturday (well, it is two days after Thanksgiving.) 
</P>
<P>
At noon, the other Santa -- Claus -- will pull into Palisades Park, at the 
corner of Ocean and Colorado avenues, and give away teddy bears to anyone who 
turns in their war toys to him. 
</P>
<P>
It's the kids' version of L.A. City Councilman Nate Holden's offer to buy back 
the automatic rifles of area residents earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The week before the recent opening of "Back to the Future Part II," time played 
some tricks off screen. 
</P>
<P>
First, a giant billboard digital clock on Sunset Boulevard that was counting 
back the hours to the film's opening stopped a few days early and had to be 
repaired. 
</P>
<P>
Then, writes attentive viewer Joyce Clark Shults, the night that NBC played the 
original "Back to the Future," it followed up with "a promo on the 11 o'clock 
news for the Carson and Letterman shows with film clips from the previous 
night's show (which I had seen). Whoever was in charge must really have got 
sucked into the movie." 
</P>
<P>
Ever wonder why Pacific Bell shed the term "information" for 411 calls in favor 
of "directory assistance"? 
</P>
<P>
The company says the problem was that it was often being asked, not for 
telephone numbers, but for general information. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, three of the more memorable questions thrown at operators were: 
</P>
<P>
"How deep do you bury a dog?" 
</P>
<P>
"How do you cook a roast?" 
</P>
<P>
"What beats five-of-a-kind and a Royal Flush?" 
</P>
<P>
Cannes, France, is the sister city of Beverly Hills -- what a glamorous family 
-- and to celebrate the relationship, Mayor Michel Mouillot flew over here the 
other day. 
</P>
<P>
He attended a Beverly Hills City Council session, at which lawmakers wore 
formal attire in honor of the occasion. Afterward, everyone trouped off to a 
gala at the Beverly Wilshire that featured such celebrities as George Lazenby, 
the one-movie James Bond, and Arthur Kassel, owner of the Beverly Hills Gun 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
"Zsa Zsa was there, mingling with the crowd," reported publicist Michael Sands. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps she was lobbying for a special showing at the next Cannes Film Festival 
of her unforgettable 1959 hit, "Queen of Outer Space."

NEW HEIGHTS FOR DOMESTIC AIRLINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Delta Air Lines' recent $10 billion order for new passenger jets is good news 
for the air traveler and the Southern California economy. New planes are safer 
planes, and the recent massive airline orders will weed out aging aircraft from 
the commercial fleet. The $5 billion-plus portion of the Delta order placed 
with McDonnell Douglas Corp. triggers production of the firm's new MD-90 jet at 
the Long Beach plant and cushions the region against possible defense contract 
cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Both Boeing of Seattle, recipient of the balance of the Delta order, and 
McDonnell Douglas have had their problems. Boeing, suffering delays in 
delivering aircraft, has just emerged from a seven-week-long strike. McDonnell 
Douglas has struggled through a painful management restructuring, but now is 
embarked on its new generation of passenger aircraft. The MD-90 is the 
successor to the MD-80, the tail-mounted twin-jet workhorse of many airlines 
for short and medium-range flights. It will be quieter, less polluting and will 
be about 15% more fuel-efficient than existing planes. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas also is going into production on a new wide-body jet, the 
MD-11, successor to the tri-jet DC-10, carrying from 245 to more than 400 
passengers. The firm made a large sale of MD-11s to American Airlines earlier 
this year at a price of more than $100 million each. And in April, United Air 
Lines announced a $16 billion order of 370 planes from Boeing that will 
significantly rejuvenate the United fleet. 
</P>
<P>
There could be a downside to the recent plane orders: The five biggest airlines 
are likely to increase their dominance of the commercial passenger field, since 
all have substantial numbers of new aircraft coming into their fleets. Airline 
experts argue that weaker firms with older fleets will fall further behind just 
by standing still. Members of Congress who fear too much airline consolidation 
and favor some measure of re-regulation will be watching closely. 
</P>
<P>
But the revitalization of the airline fleet with massive orders of new planes 
during both 1988 and 1989 is a most positive development. The average age of 
the 5,200 planes flown on domestic routes is 14 years. More than 40% are at 
least 20 years old. When the older, noiser, less-efficient jets are retired, 
the American passenger public will enjoy a much more comfortable and safer 
ride.

I miss the visual beauty and wonderful sound of the ducks and wild geese that 
used to come in such numbers to the Sepulveda Basin -- what has happened? Is it 
too early yet, lack of water or lack of open space? 
</P>
<P>
I know in the world of endless real problems facing us daily -- drugs, crime, 
the hungry and homeless, poor education, pollution of air, water and food, 
crowded freeways, AIDS, the number of illegals, takeovers by big business, loss 
of ethics and morality and good old-fashioned honesty and foreign investors 
(the degree of) in every area of American life -- that the seasonal birds being 
missed by at least one person is a small, small concern. But things, especially 
of nature, that feed the soul and contribute to peace and tranquility, even 
momentarily, are indeed necessary.

In response to "California's Beleaguered Coastline: Rapacious Developers Ignore 
the Law," by Madelyn Glickfeld, Opinion, Nov. 5: 
</P>
<P>
Describing the unprecedented wave of destruction at the hands of pillaging 
developers, Glickfeld, a member of the California Coastal Commission, says of 
our coastline, "Wildlife habitat is being irretrievably lost, coastal water 
quality is being degraded, public facilities are being endangered and lives and 
property are put at risk." 
</P>
<P>
Glickfeld might have been speaking of Laguna Beach rather than that of her own 
Malibu community, for coastal destruction is as rampant here in south Orange 
County as it is north of Los Angeles. California's coastal tragedy is its 
raging extensiveness. As we breathe, or try to, developers are changing the 
face of the state's most prized physical attribute, and it's hardly for the 
better. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Laguna Canyon is threatened by a proposed development project 
that would put 3,200 housing units, acres of shops, roads and pavement, and a 
250-acre private golf course in the heart of what's been an extraordinarily 
viable coastal greenbelt. Part of the tragedy is that Laguna Canyon is the 
county's last remaining unspoiled passage to the sea. Soaring coastal land 
values have presumably lured the Irvine Co.'s new chairman, Donald Bren, who 
is, as Glickfeld deplored, the kind of speculator who has no emotional 
attachment to the land or the project's impacted communities. 
</P>
<P>
What does Bren know of the legendary canyon, its fragile watershed and water 
runoff threat to public beaches and private property owners who live downstream 
of his proposed project? 
</P>
<P>
There is much work to be done to stop the destruction. Empowering the Coastal 
Commission is just the beginning. But developers also owe citizens of 
California reparations for the damage they do to our public resources just as 
oil companies compensate the federal parks and recreation treasury for 
violating coastal waters. Replacement value taxes should be levied against 
projects which destroy our public resources. 
</P>
<P>
Every elected coastal community and county official must also be appraised for 
his or her environmental protection advocacy, and each of us, individually, 
must play an active role in the protection and preservation of our coastlines.

MORITA'S BOOK ON UNITED STATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Pfaff's commentary, "U.S. Talk, Fear, Bluster Won't Cut It" (Op-Ed 
Page, Nov. 13), doesn't cut it. I was amazed to see that Pfaff took seriously a 
piece of Japanese literature, "A Japan That Can Say No," that is overtly 
chauvinistic and biased. 
</P>
<P>
To call the United States racist because it dropped the atomic bomb on Japan 
rather than Nazi Germany skirts the facts. The bomb wasn't even tested until 
after Germany surrendered. Also, there were Allied troops all over Europe and 
concentration camps filled with Allied prisoners of war and innocent civilians, 
all of which were not present in Japan. Too, the Japanese opted to "ignore" 
(Japanese official's choice of words) demands to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
And to make a case that the U.S. is racist by looking at the place of blacks 
here, makes one wonder about the place of blacks in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Another point: "Americans want to steal Japanese know-how." Did the Japanese 
invent TV? Telephones? Computers? Baseball? And why are Japanese scientists and 
engineers always here in the U.S., rather than the other way around? 
</P>
<P>
Yet another point: "Americans demand that Japanese invest to offset U.S. 
deficits, but when the Japanese do invest, the public and Congress are overcome 
'by fear and anxiety.' " It is one thing to buy from the U.S. and another thing 
to buy the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, "Americans don't trust the Japanese." This is easy to say. Let's 
see the study on this. Conversely, have the Japanese shown that they trust 
Americans? Hardly. (This book hints at the answer.) 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to see why Sony Chairman Akio Morita chose not to have his book 
translated into English. It's not easy to see how Pfaff could take the book 
seriously.

BREATH TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By authorizing "preliminary" breath tests of California motorists after 
"administrative detentions," the attorney general's office has placed one more 
arrow in the quiver of law enforcement. Simultaneously, and without a moment's 
blink, our right against unreasonable searches and seizures has once again been 
eroded on semantic subtleties and transparent nuances. 
</P>
<P>
While drinking drivers undoubtably exact a toll in human lives and property 
damage on our state's highways, compromising everyone's freedom to traverse 
without arbitrary suspicion seems much too high a price to pay. Even though 
sobriety checkpoint stops are "brief" and preliminary breath tests do not 
require the driver to do anything, police scrutiny without justifiable cause 
leaves our constitutionally declared rights in shambles.

JACK SMITH: ON THE ROAD AGAIN, A HARD DRIVE TO BAKERSFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Why don't we go home through Bakersfield?" I asked my wife when we left San 
Luis Obispo, knowing she would like the chance to visit her family. 
</P>
<P>
One must look at the map to see that Bakersfield is actually north of Santa 
Maria, though Santa Maria is 168 miles north of Los Angeles and Bakersfield 
only 100. (Because the state angles so far to the west, San Francisco is almost 
as far west as north.) 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that a hard drive?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
I was looking forward to it. I had been told that the road was good but lonely. 
"You won't find any MacDonald's out there." 
</P>
<P>
They said the road to take was Highway 166, which cuts off State 101 just north 
of Santa Maria, and goes east through Los Padres National Forest and across the 
steppes of the San Joaquin Valley to Maricopa, finally connecting with Highway 
99. 
</P>
<P>
We had no sooner left Highway 101 than we were swallowed up in the kind of 
wilderness I had not seen in California for many years. The road was good, but 
there were never more than two or three other cars in sight. Now and then two 
or three of us would crowd up behind a truck on the narrow road before we could 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
We climbed through low mountains, skirting grotesque geological formations 
thrown up millions of years ago by an angry earth. The brown earth was dotted 
by cows and oaks. On the far side of the Sierra Madres, the downgrade was so 
steep that I had to brake to keep our speed under 70. 
</P>
<P>
We came to a town called New Cuyama. It did not look new. We saw no large 
buildings or public accommodations. If there was a MacDonald's we missed it. 
The only structure of any size was the school. We passed through the entire 
town in 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Five or six miles down the road we came to old Cuyama. It looked no different 
from New Cuyama. It was equally small, equally horizontal. Its most imposing 
structure was also the school. We passed through it in 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
For miles no other sign of human tenancy appeared but there were cattle feed 
bins behind barbed-wire fences. Finally tin shacks and white oil tanks began to 
appear in the foothills below the rugged escarpments. Then oil pumps turned up, 
scattered, lonely. They looked like fastidious dinosaurs drinking as they 
lowered and raised their enormous heads. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the landscape was uncultivated grazing land. At one point we passed a 
small stand at which a woman was selling apples. She sat on a stool in front of 
her wares, staring at the horizon, monumentally patient. She was utterly alone 
on the earth. We looked about us in vain for an apple orchard. 
</P>
<P>
Soon the western reaches of the San Joaquin Valley spread out before us. It is 
a part rarely seen by travelers who traverse the long valley as quickly as 
possible over Highways 5 or 99. 
</P>
<P>
It was a world untouched by civilization's ills. Uncrowded, spacious, serene, 
unhurried. It belonged to hawks, rodents, coyotes, rattlesnakes and owls. Man 
had barely scratched its surface. My tensions drained away. 
</P>
<P>
We passed through the arid Elkhorn Hills and came to Maricopa, a small oil and 
farming center whose most famous neighbor is Taft, of oil and high school 
football fame. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Maricopa, heading for Highway 99, we crossed the California Aqueduct, a 
blue thread on its journey across the wasteland toward the thirsty metropolis 
below. 
</P>
<P>
Once we reached 99 and turned north toward Bakersfield, I turned on our radio 
and tuned in a country music station, as I always do on that stretch of 
highway. Bakersfield is known as Nashville West; it has produced some great 
country music. 
</P>
<P>
I was not disappointed. Soon we heard a man singing in that nasal style, a 
style that sings of love, betrayal, heartbreak and redemption. "Don't we all 
have the right to be wrong now and then?" he sang. There was an ad, and then a 
man sang, "I don't remember loving you. I don't recall the things you say you 
put me through." 
</P>
<P>
I was in a proper mood for my periodical return to Bakersfield, the town where 
I started my career, as a sports writer, and where I met my wife, a local high 
school girl. The most romantic city in the world.

Memorial: Dozens of people marked the 26th anniversary of President Kennedy's 
assassination Wednesday by visiting Dealey Plaza. By mid-morning 70 tourists 
and Dallas residents had visited. "I think it's an event that needs to be 
remembered but not dwelt upon," said Ron Thompson, 34, a lifelong Dallas 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
Good reading: President Bush won't have any trouble finding a good book to read 
this winter. Esquire magazine shipped the White House 34 volumes picked for the 
President by the 1989 Esquire Register honorees. Oprah Winfrey chose the Bible, 
film maker Spike Lee selected "The Autobiography of Malcolm X." Actor Billy 
Crystal picked Erich Segal's "Love Story" partly because ". . . it's short; he 
can get right back to business." W. Keith Hefner, founder of the Youth 
Communication-New York Center, recommended "The Elements of Style" by William 
Strunk Jr. and E.B. White. "I'd like him to correct his broken syntax," Hefner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Koch shot: New York's lame-duck Mayor Edward I. Koch claims the Grand Hyatt 
Hotel, partly owned by billionaire Donald Trump, owes the city $2.8 million 
under a lease agreement. The Grand Hyatt called the claim a "blatantly 
political attack" and "one last cheap shot." 
</P>
<P>
Tres chic: When promotion writers at Chicago's Marshall Field &amp; Co. 
discussed whether to use the grammatically correct Le Beau Noel or the 
incorrect but catchy La Belle Noel on the cover of their Christmas catalogue, 
catchy won. "It rhymes," said Field's spokeswoman Kassie Davis. "It was a 
promotion. . . . We thought it would be a little more catchy if it had a 
jingle."

ERMA BOMBECK: UNDERCUTTING THANKSGIVING CARVING CHORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since Phyllis Diller balanced her turkey on a window ledge and stuffed it 
through the beak, this traditional bird has been an enigma to cooks everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
We are intimidated by its size. (You could lose your luggage in there.) We are 
awed by its history and threatened by its independence. ("We'll be done when we 
say we're done!") 
</P>
<P>
I cannot look at a pale, naked turkey with its thunder thighs, sunken chest and 
accordion neck without thinking, "I have seen my future and you are it!" It's 
unsettling to me. It is obviously the resemblance that has prompted my mother 
every year to call, "Erma, time for you to carve the turkey." 
</P>
<P>
I have no idea how I got stuck with this dubious honor. After 40 years of 
marriage, I still haven't a clue as to how to cut up a whole chicken. We call 
them mystery parts. Anyone who can identify where they belong wins a big prize. 
</P>
<P>
But back to the turkey. I approach the bronze bird like a sumo wrestler 
circling his opponent to find out where his weaknesses and strengths are. Then 
I begin. We're not talking Norman Rockwell here. It's more like a chain-saw 
massacre. If the legs don't fall off in my hands, my mother is lamenting, "It's 
not done yet, is it?" If they do fall off in my hands, my father says, "It's 
overcooked. It'll be dry." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, my husband hovers over me and predicts, "You are going to cut 
yourself." I have always wanted to answer him, "You have just ruined my 
surprise!" 
</P>
<P>
I've tried studying all those little charts that are put out just before the 
holidays, the ones that tell you where to make the incisions that leave you 
with a wall of white meat that slides off in thin slices. It never works for 
me. 
</P>
<P>
Usually I resort to a list of things to blame for the miserable mound of meat 
on the platter: The knife was dull; the light was burned out over the stove; 
the turkey was too hot when I carved it/too cold when I carved it; the 
Republicans did something; nuclear testing is at work; glasnost . . . take your 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
Today will be no different than Thanksgivings past. I will once again 
arm-wrestle a 20-pound bird to the platter and under-whelm everyone. But as in 
the past, I will allow myself a few minutes to reflect on how simple life would 
have been if the Pilgrims had just tossed up a salad and thrown a few steaks on 
the grill.

ART BUCHWALD: THANKS IN OH-SO-FRENCH WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(In 1953 a young man climbed the crooked steps of the Paris Herald Tribune 
building on the Rue de Berri and submitted an article on "Explaining 
Thanksgiving Day to the French." The editor said, "I'll give you $10 for it." 
In disgust, the youth took back the manuscript and, instead of pursuing a 
career in journalism, went into city planning for Detroit. He was never heard 
from again.) 
</P>
<P>
One of our most important holidays is Thanksgiving Day, known in France as "le 
Jour de Merci Donnant." 
</P>
<P>
"Le Jour de Merci Donnant" was first started by a group of Pilgrims 
("Pelerins") who fled from "l'Angleterre" before the McCarran Act to found a 
colony in the New World ("le Nouveau Monde") where they could shoot Indians 
("les Peaux-Rouges") and eat turkey ("dinde") to their hearts' content. 
</P>
<P>
They landed at a place called Plymouth (now a famous "voiture Americaine") in a 
wooden sailing ship named the Mayflower, or "Fleur de Mai," in 1620. But while 
the "Pelerins" were killing the "dindes," the "Peaux-Rouges" were killing the 
"Pelerins" and there were several hard winters ahead for both of them. The only 
way the "Peaux-Rouges" helped the "Pelerins" was when they taught them how to 
grow corn ("mais"). The reason they did this was because they liked corn with 
their "Pelerins." 
</P>
<P>
In 1623, after another harsh year, the "Pelerins' " crops were so good that 
they decided to have a celebration and give thanks because more "mais" was 
raised by the "Pelerins" than "Pelerins" were killed by the "Peaux-Rouges." 
</P>
<P>
Every year on "le Jour de Merci Donnant," parents tell their children an 
amusing story about the first celebration. 
</P>
<P>
It concerns a brave "capitaine" named Miles Standish (known in France as 
"Kilometres Deboutish") and a shy young lieutenant named Jean Alden. Both of 
them were in love with a flower of Plymouth called Priscilla Mullens (no 
translation). The "vieux capitaine" said to the "jeune lieutenant": 
</P>
<P>
"Go to the damsel Priscilla ("Allez tres vite chez Priscilla"), the loveliest 
maiden of Plymouth ("la plus jolie demoiselle de Plymouth"). Say that a blunt 
old captain, a man not of words but of action ("un vieux Fanfan la Tulipe"), 
offers his hand and his heart, the hand and heart of a soldier. Not in these 
words, you know, but this, in short, is my meaning. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a maker of war ("Je suis un fabricant de la guerre") and not a maker of 
phrases. You, bred as a scholar ("Vous, qui etes pain comme un etudiant"), can 
say it in elegant language, such as you read in your books of the pleadings and 
wooings of lovers, such as you think best adapted to win the heart of the 
maiden." 
</P>
<P>
Although Jean was fit to be tied ("convenable a etre emballe"), friendship 
prevailed over love and he went to his duty. But instead of using elegant 
language, he blurted out his mission. Priscilla was muted with amazement and 
sorrow ("rendue muette par l'etonnement et la tristesse"). 
</P>
<P>
At length she exclaimed, interrupting the ominous silence, "If the great 
captain of Plymouth is so very eager to wed me, why does he not come himself 
and take the trouble to woo me?" ("Ou est-il, le vieux Kilometres? Pourquoi ne 
vient-il pas aupres de moi pour tenter sa chance?") 
</P>
<P>
Jean said that "Kilometres Deboutish" was very busy and didn't have time for 
those things. He staggered on, telling her what a wonderful husband 
"Kilometres" would make. Finally, Priscilla arched her eyebrows and said in a 
tremulous voice, "Why don't you speak for yourself, Jean?" ("Chacun a son 
gout.") 
</P>
<P>
And so, on the fourth Thursday in November, American families sit down at a 
large table brimming with tasty dishes, and for the only time during the year 
eat better than the French do. 
</P>
<P>
No one can deny that "le Jour de Merci Donnant" is a "grand fete" and no matter 
how well fed American families are, they never forget to give thanks to 
"Kilometres Deboutish," who made this great day possible.

FOLK DANCING GROUPS CELEBRATE A WORLD OF TRADITION

<P>
Folk dancing, popular in the '60s along with coffeehouses and guitars, has 
survived the '80s and is marching boldly into the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Broadly defined, folk dancing is the traditional 
</P>
<P>
dance form of a country or a particular ethnic group. The ever-faster hora 
danced at a bar mitzvah, the whirling polkas at a Polish wedding, the line 
dance in "Zorba the Greek" -- all are folk dances. 
</P>
<P>
Some dances are for couples only, others take all comers. In some the dancers 
are arranged in squares, in others they form circles or lines. The variations 
are as endless as the various peoples and cultures of the world. 
</P>
<P>

NAPOLEON'S COURT: ONE CATTY VIEW

At the Court of Napoleon Memoirs of the Duchesse de'Abrantes. Foreword by 
Katell le Bourhis. Introduction by Olivier Bernier (Doubleday; 387 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
I once knew an old Frenchman who was a marquis. Eric was also a duke, but he 
was too much of a snob to use the title. His marquisate was a sound Bourbon 
lineage going well back before the Revolution. The dukedom was Napoleonic. 
"Upstarts, my dear," he would say. "Vulgar people." 
</P>
<P>
Up to this moment, I never thought I would be taking so etiolated a 
distinction. One of the virtues, or perhaps vices, of book reviewing is that it 
gets you into a lot of arguments that don't belong to you. In any case, reading 
this abridged version of the memoirs of Laure Permon -- she became a duchess 
when Napoleon made dukes of some of his lieutenants -- I can see Eric's point. 
</P>
<P>
To put the writing of the Duchesse de'Abrantes alongside that of such 
aristocratic predecessors as the Duc de Rochefoucauld or Mme. de Sevigne is to 
paste a gossip column into a history of literature. She was the Suzy, the Liz 
Smith of her time. Except that she lacked their lone virtue of timeliness. 
</P>
<P>
Her memoirs of Napoleon's court were written long after the fact, when she was 
poor and needed the money. Gossip, unlike soft cheese, does not benefit from 
aging. Furthermore, hers lacks gossip's second virtue, which is spontaneity. It 
is tactical gossip and if it possesses gossip's third virtue -- malice -- it is 
tactical malice, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes her mixture of saccharine and venom makes an interesting instability. 
But the reader senses her carefully choosing her proportions according, not to 
what she experienced at the time -- 1810, say -- but to what she felt she could 
get away with 25 years later, at the time of writing. Reticence and frankness 
are doctored measurements; and the writing is also doctored. Balzac, her 
friend, took a hand in it. It is a literary version of chaptalization, where 
you add sugar to the wine, increasing the kick and, according to some, 
coarsening the flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Laure was the daughter of a Corsican family that was friendly with the 
Bonapartes. Her parents set up a comfortable establishment in Paris, on the 
fringes of pre-Revolutionary society. Napoleon, a young and penniless 
lieutenant, was an occasional sulky house-guest. 
</P>
<P>
He sensed that Laure's mother patronized him, which she did; and he never got 
over her making fun of him when, a widow, she turned down his proposal of 
marriage at the time he began his rise to power. He had hoped her connections 
with the aristocratic set would give him respectability. 
</P>
<P>
He resented the connections, though, and his treatment of Laure was a mix of 
resentment and support. He called her "little pest" but agreed to let her marry 
Gen. Junot, one of his intimates; and he saw to it that they had enough money 
to live lavishly and give fancy parties. Having become the all-powerful first 
consul, he needed to create a court. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after he crowned himself Emperor, he would get some of the old nobility 
back; meanwhile, he formed a rattly and fairly uncouth society out of his 
generals and collaborators and their wives. Sporadically, he called upon Laure 
to teach them manners. 
</P>
<P>
He begged her to have a word with Cambacieres, the absurdly pretentious second 
consul, who had become the subject of cartoons in the English press. "It is 
only a woman that can tell a man he is ridiculous," Napoleon said. "If I meddle 
I shall tell him he is mad." 
</P>
<P>
Laure's presentation of Napoleon is worshipful and damning by turns. Her 
sensibility is not large enough to make a portrait out of a paradox. It is his 
nastiness that mainly comes across, though. When she is staying alone at 
Malmaison, he makes several dawn visits, sitting on her bed and reading aloud 
letters from women proposing trysts. It seems to have been an unsuccessful 
attempt at seduction; all she tells us explicitly is that he would pinch her 
feet under the bedclothes. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, she persuaded Junot to spend the night. Napoleon was greatly offended 
at seeing another head in the bed; he scolded her afterwards and demanded to 
know whether she had told her husband anything. As for the latter, a thick and 
sometimes brutal man with a dog-like devotion to his master, his only reaction 
to the morning visit was to be grateful that Napoleon had not objected to his 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
Laure's portraits of the ladies of the court are venom laced with sugar. She 
reports that Napoleon's sister, Pauline, who was fond of her own good looks, 
was devastated to hear another woman criticize the size of her ears. Another 
sister, Catherine, is described as beautiful, apart from thick hips and a short 
neck. True, she was Junot's mistress; later, she made a further raid on Laure's 
bed by taking Metternich, her lover, away from her. 
</P>
<P>
What comes across is far removed from the lethal but elegant games in Laclos' 
18th-Century "Liaisons Dangereuses." It is a Balzasian stew in a simpering 
disguise. The friend of Laure's old age should, perhaps, have written more; or 
stayed away altogether. 
</P>
<P>
This drastically shortened version of the memoirs has both a foreword and an 
introduction. The first, by Katell le Bourhis, who is credited as "originator" 
of the selection, is brief and factual. The second, by Olivier Bernier, who is 
listed as editor, is longer, more highly colored and reads like an article in 
Vanity Fair. The translation is nearly a hundred years old. Nobody involved 
seems to have bothered much.

INTO THE NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: Monday night's opening of the Craft &amp; Folk Art Museum in its new 
home, on the fourth floor of the May Co. Wilshire. CAFAM will be exhibiting in 
10,000 square feet at the department store until 1992, when it moves into its 
permanent home, now under construction in the Miracle Mile area. The evening 
was also the opening of CAFAM's inaugural exhibit, "Hands On! Objects Crafted 
in Our Time." 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: An art museum in the middle of a department store? Guests were 
bemused by the idea. Particularly ironic was the fact that CAFAM's own gift 
shop has been located outside of the building, down Wilshire Boulevard a piece. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: CAFAM's chairman Frank Wyle and museum director Patrick Ela 
joined officials of the May Co. and museum supporters to tour the exhibition 
space. On the fifth floor, more guests mingled at a greeting reception. Since 
the evening was concurrent with the May Co.'s 50th anniversary, cigarette girls 
in period costumes worked the crowd, handing out perfume samples, while others 
took Polaroid snapshots of the guests with the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: Anything and everything, from tuxedoes to sport shirts and jeans. 
The department store doormen and elevator operators wore top hats and tails. 
</P>
<P>
Fashion Statement: One man wore a complete set of African robes. 
</P>
<P>
Pastimes: Listening to the band on the fifth floor and swinging along with the 
singing group the Step Sisters. Checking out the pieces from the museum's 
permanent collection, including a contemporary rocking chair and bench from 
craftsman Sam Maloof, a 19th- Century Japanese futon wedding set and Pedro 
Linares' life-size Day of the Dead skeleton sculptures. Of course, the May Co. 
people didn't mind at all if guests stopped off in menswear or electronics to 
do some early Christmas shopping. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: A cocktail buffet with cheese, crackers, vegetables, quiche and too many 
people trying to get at it. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: An art museum in the middle of a department store? CAFAM director Ela 
thought it was completely natural -- in fact that it was a positive step 
forward for the museum. "We were hampered by our small facility," he said. "And 
here, we'll reach people more inclined to go to a shopping center than a 
museum." 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: One great touch was the trio of human mannequins near the door, who 
modeled authentic 1939 fashions by Adrian. The women looked like a prehistoric 
version of the Del Rubio Triplets. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: Too many people and not enough ventilation in the exhibition space 
kept guests going in and coming out again quickly. KEVIN ALLMAN

MAJORITY FAULTS BISHOP FOR DIRECTIVE AGAINST KILLEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds of Southern Californians think San Diego's Roman Catholic 
Bishop Leo T. Maher acted inappropriately when he barred Assemblywoman Lucy 
Killea from receiving Communion because of her pro-choice stand on abortion, 
The Times Poll shows. 
</P>
<P>
By a 62%-26% margin, Southern Californians disagreed with Maher's action, which 
has catapulted Killea, a San Diego Democrat, into the national spotlight. The 
poll results closely track that of another recent survey, but it is unclear 
whether such anti-Maher sentiment will make a difference at the polls for 
Killea, who faces Assemblywoman Carol Bentley (R-El Cajon) in a special 
election Dec. 5 for a vacant state Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
Maher, who couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday, issued the directive Nov. 
15 on the basis that Killea's public proclamation of her pro-choice position in 
television commercials was "in complete contradiction to the moral teaching of 
the Catholic Church." 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll found that women are more likely to disagree with Maher -- 74% 
of women interviewed called his actions inappropriate, in contrast to 50% of 
men. 
</P>
<P>
A solid majority of both non-Catholics and Catholics expressed dissatisfaction 
with Maher. Non-Catholics disagreed with the Bishop by a 64%-21% margin, as 
compared to a 58%-35% margin for Catholics, the poll showed. But 11% of 
non-Catholics said they were uncertain, contrasted with 6% of Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll was based on telephone interviews conducted from Nov. 17 to Nov. 
21 with 1,067 people throughout Southern California, including 238 in San 
Diego. The poll's margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the poll results, Killea said, "Clearly, people are concerned about 
freedom of choice and the separation of church and state, and they find 
(Maher's actions) unpalatable. What kind of effect that's going to have on the 
election, it's hard to say." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Bentley's campaign agreed and called the poll results "not 
surprising." 
</P>
<P>
"Most people do believe in the separation of church and state, and we're seeing 
that reflected once again," said David Lewis, Bentley's campaign consultant. He 
said he believes that the national attention Maher's action has drawn, however, 
may help both Killea and Bentley by raising their name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
A poll conducted last week by the San Diego Union found that 72% of San Diego 
county residents disagreed with Maher's decision, which apparently is the first 
such sanction ever imposed by a bishop against an elected official in the 
United States over the abortion issue.

IN CONVENTION CENTER'S CHORUS LINE, EVERY EMPLOYEE IS A STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Employees at the new San Diego Convention Center don't just show up for work, 
they come to be "on stage." And, when they do get there, the women had better 
be wearing stockings and bras, and the men must have their hair and sideburns 
short, have no more than one ring on each hand and never have beards or -- 
sorry Jim McMahon -- earrings. 
</P>
<P>
Those are just some of the policies and guidelines contained in the center's 
employee handbook, a 31-page booklet describing the do's and don'ts for the 
facility's up to 1,000 full-time and part-time workers. They range from the 
"Ten Commandments of the San Diego Spirit" to a Miss Manners-like recital of 
how to be polite to an emergency manual, imploring workers, for instance, never 
to say "bomb" or "explosion" when there is an evacuation during a bomb threat. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to set the center apart, to provide services and standards of 
service above those offered by other centers in the highly competitive 
convention industry, said Tom Liegler, executive vice president and general 
manager of the Convention Center Corp. and the person most responsible for the 
policies and guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to make a statement . . . to make it like a cruise ship so that 
people will want to come back," he said. "While our facility is beautiful, 
we're just a building. We've got to excel, and the only way to do that is to 
outdo the others." 
</P>
<P>
Page 4: "The most important thing you can wear is a smile! And the smile you 
give to our guests will be a souvenir of our facility. The convention business 
is a form of show business, and we must operate efficiently in order to 
entertain and care for our many guests. And, with hundreds of people performing 
just about every role imaginable, we must all answer to the same cues." 
</P>
<P>
Center officials thought they would have three months to break in their work 
force, but delays in completing the facility squeezed that time to a few days. 
In order to learn how to react when dealing with people in various situations, 
new employees have watched videos showing treatment that both turns off and 
turns on customers. After a two-hour session, they receive certificates. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the center's employees are asked to have the booklet on 
their person. 
</P>
<P>
Little in the design of the $160-million center has been left to chance, 
including the blue-and-white color scheme of the uniforms, in keeping with the 
center's nautical feel. However, Dennis Conner and other sailors might have 
trouble here because shoes without socks are strictly forbidden for employees. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever the "Star-Spangled Banner" or the anthem of any foreign country is 
played, employees will be required to stop what they are doing, stand at 
attention and face the flag. A male employee must remove and hold his hat in 
his right hand and then place it over his heart. A female employee must hold 
her right hand over her heart. 
</P>
<P>
Page 8, the "Ten Commandments": 1) speak to people; 2) smile at people; 3) call 
people by name; 4) be friendly and helpful; 5) be cordial; 6) radiate a genuine 
interest; 7) be generous with praise; 8) be considerate of the feelings of 
others; 9) be thoughtful; 10) cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
The booklet includes a map of the center's various levels because, if there's 
one thing center officials don't want their employees saying to conventioneers, 
it is "I don't know." The guidelines describe in detail how workers should be 
well-informed, both about the center itself and what events are scheduled 
there. Even if it takes a call to a supervisor to find out, the emphasis is on 
getting a straight answer to inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
If the clean-cut look of the people working at the center reminds you of 
Disneyland, it's not by accident. The uniform grooming standards emanated from 
the Orange County citadel of fantasy, according to Liegler. "We want them to be 
sharp, clean-cut, Americana and representative of our county," Liegler said. 
</P>
<P>
Extreme hair styles are a no-no. Women must wear stockings at all times and 
"they must be flesh tone or match your shoes and the assigned uniform." They 
also must wear "proper undergarments." Long hair cannot fall forward or over 
the face, and hair below the shoulders needs to be confined with ribbons or 
barrettes, the plainer the better. 
</P>
<P>
Men can wear one ring on each hand, a class ring or wedding band, for example, 
and it must be small. Hair cannot extend more than halfway down the ear and 
must be above the shirt collar in back. Sideburns must stop at the bottom of 
the earlobe. 
</P>
<P>
Page 10: "Since the convention business is a form of show business, when you're 
in the view of a guest -- you're on stage. Put on your best performance at all 
times." 
</P>
<P>
In the area of security, the philosophy at the center will be: less is more. 
</P>
<P>
Security personnel at the center won't be armed with guns or even night sticks. 
And the guidelines urge other center workers to ask for security help only as a 
last resort. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel security is best controlled by a smile and friendliness . . . more 
public relations" than a display of force, Liegler said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lord has given us five basic senses," he added, "touch, taste, (hearing, 
sight and smell). All we're asking our workers is to add two other senses, 
common sense and good horse sense." 
</P>
<P>
Page 12: "Do not sit, lean, slouch, lie or appear in any other position that 
demonstrates to our guests anything less than full attention to their needs."

KILLER OF EL CAJON REPORTER IS CONVICTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
David Allan Weeding was convicted Wednesday of first-degree murder in the fatal 
stabbing of an East County newspaper reporter who came home for lunch to find 
his wife being attacked by an intruder with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
Weeding, 40, an auto radiator repairman from Santee, showed no emotion as a San 
Diego Superior Court jury returned its verdict of murder in the May 20, 1988, 
death of Steve Petix, 31, a reporter for the Daily Californian. 
</P>
<P>
The jury, which deliberated less than a day, also convicted Weeding of trying 
to rape Petix's wife, Vickie, and of burglary. In winning a conviction on the 
attempted-rape charge, prosecutors proved the murder was committed with 
"special circumstances," meaning Weeding could face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Wayne L. Peterson told jurors to return to court Wednesday to begin 
hearing the sentencing phase of the case. The judge ordered Weeding held in San 
Diego County Jail without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Vickie Petix cried as the verdict was announced, but left the courtroom 
immediately afterward without answering reporters' questions. Steve Petix's 
brother, Mark, 34, of Temecula, a reporter for a Riverside newspaper, said the 
jury did "the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm relieved, and as happy as I could be under the circumstances," Petix said. 
"It's more than a relief to know the person who did this will never be able to 
do this to anybody else, ever again." 
</P>
<P>
Weeding's brother, Larry, 37, of El Cajon, said the verdict was hard to take. 
"I feel my brother is innocent and he got railroaded," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Robert Bourne had said in his closing argument Tuesday that 
Weeding's younger brother, Hans, actually committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas J. Whelan said the verdict was overwhelmingly 
supported by the evidence. "Obviously, I'm happy," he said. Whelan declined to 
reveal whether prosecutors will seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Petix was stabbed after arriving home for lunch to find a man struggling with 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Vickie Petix had testified that a man in a blue uniform representing himself as 
a workman for the El Cajon apartment complex came to her door, saying he wanted 
to check for plumbing leaks. 
</P>
<P>
She let the man in, but he put a knife to her throat, she testified. After all 
her clothing was removed, she said, her husband walked in. 
</P>
<P>
The intruder "went after" Steve Petix while she ran, naked and screaming, to 
the apartment manager's unit and called police, she said. Jurors heard a tape 
recording of Vickie Petix's frantic phone call for help. 
</P>
<P>
Petix was stabbed five times in the fight with the intruder, collapsed on the 
apartment floor and died without regaining consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
El Cajon police arrested Weeding three days later in the parking lot of a 
Santee bar. Vickie Petix said at the trial that she was "positive" Weeding was 
the attacker.

A natural gas main ruptured Wednesday in Clairemont near Mt. Aguilar and Mt. 
Alifan drives, forcing the evacuation of 40 people, a San Diego Fire Department 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Workers at a nearby office building were evacuated and a three-block area near 
the main break was closed to traffic after the 8:50 a.m. leak, spokesman Larry 
Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-inch line broke when a private contractor was doing road work in the 
area, Stewart said. San Diego Gas &amp; Electric crews took an hour to "pinch 
off" the break before workers were allowed to return. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters said there were no explosions or injuries as the crews repaired 
the broken main.

The African elephant that underwent the first-ever Cesarean section on a 
pachyderm has developed a sweet tooth and begun to eat, indicating to doctors 
at the San Diego Wild Animal Park that she is recovering. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hanscom, a spokesman for the park, said that Tuesday night and Wednesday, 
Jean, a 7,000-pound, 19-year-old elephant, ate four candy bars, four loaves of 
bread, a little bit of hay and half a pan of "elephant brownies" -- a 
concoction of oat bran and baking chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though it seems like a lot of chocolate, it's nothing to an elephant," 
Hanscom said, adding that animal keepers believe the caffeine in the candy is 
stimulating Jean's appetite. "In this case, chocolate seems to be good 
medicine." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a team of 11 doctors operated on Jean to remove a 296-pound dead 
fetus that they feared was threatening her life. On Wednesday, Hanscom said, 
Jean remained sluggish but exhibited no signs of infection.

With a simple 3, 8, 20, 25, 40, 48, James P. Carroll of El Cajon won more than 
$5 million in Saturday's California Lottery game, officials announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Carroll won $5,211,954 of a $10.4-million jackpot. He purchased 
his winning ticket at the 7-Eleven store at 1296 N. 2nd St., said Bruce 
Cherubin, district manager for the State Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll will receive annually $260,597 minus 20% in federal taxes for the next 
20 years, Cherubin said. Carroll, shunning all publicity of his big win, will 
get his first check through the mail within the next couple of weeks instead of 
at the usual check presentation ceremony, Cherubin said.

After a query from the jury about the court's holiday vacation schedule, the 
judge in the fraud and tax-evasion trial of Nancy Hoover Hunter said he may 
order the jury to spend more time in deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam, outside the presence of the panel, said 
that, if there is no verdict by the end of the month, "I may have to tell them 
to come in every day." 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting he has every morning with jurors, Gilliam said, "I don't want 
to talk about anything. I want a verdict." 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam's comments came at the beginning of the seventh day of deliberations. 
Jurors are weighing stacks of evidence that has accumulated since the trial 
began in mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
The panel is deciding whether Hunter played a key role in the massive J. David 
&amp; Co. Ponzi scheme, which defrauded about 1,200 people out of $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
A government indictment, which contains 197 counts, charges Hunter with 
conspiracy, fraud, tax evasion, and lying to a government agency.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: FATTBURGER HAS SEVERAL TASTY DEALS ON 
THE GRILL 
</P>

Fattburger has become one of San Diego's sizzling success stories. 
</P>
<P>
Overcoming the near-breakup of the band in the mid-'80s because of internal 
conflict, the remaining members could be on the verge of their best-selling 
album yet. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, "Good News," their first project for the Intima label, went to 
No. 4 on Billboard's contemporary jazz chart, eventually selling 45,000 copies. 
Last year's "Living in Paradise" made it to No. 6, and has sold more than 
50,000. By all indications, the new "Time Will Tell" could top them both. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really taken off," said drummer Tommy Aros. The band expects the album to 
enter Billboard's chart next week, and Intima has told band members that radio 
stations are adding it to play lists at an impressive rate. This week, it made 
impressive showings on two charts published in Radio &amp; Records magazine. 
The album moved from 17 to 13 on the new adult contemporary chart, and debuted 
at 21 on the contemporary jazz list, with favorable showings on other industry 
lists as well. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, the band completed its first video, a remake of the Chi-Lites 
song "Oh, Girl," which features a guest sax appearance by Gerald Albright. It 
also features local sax man Mark Lessman faking Albright's solo, since Albright 
was unavailable. BET, the Black Entertainment Channel (Cox Cable Channel 4), 
has said it is interested in it, and Fattburger hopes it has a good shot at 
VH-1. 
</P>
<P>
During the next few days, the band will play in Manhattan, New Jersey and Miami 
before returing to San Diego for a Nov. 29 appearance at the Catamaran's "Jazz 
Trax Nite." 
</P>
<P>
In light of the new album's promise, and the strength of the two earlier 
releases, Intima has signed Fattburger to a four-record deal. If "Time Will 
Tell" performs as expected, selling more than 100,000, the band's advance 
payment for a fourth album could climb into six figures. 
</P>
<P>
From 1986 until a few months ago, Bruce Cameron, the talented San Diego horn 
player (fluegelhorn, trumpet, cornet) virtually disappeared from the local 
scene. But, since last summer, the new band Algo Caliente, which includes 
Cameron, has built a local following. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, Cameron was one of San Diego's most promising players. He signed 
with the Discovery label and made two albums. A promising producer convinced 
him to break the contract, but the new relationship didn't last, and Cameron 
was left without a label. 
</P>
<P>
He and local sax man Hollis Gentry brought together the players who continue 
today as Fattburger in the early '80s. But internal friction and a direction 
too much in the Lites Out jazz format put out the lights for Cameron, who left 
shortly after the band played at the first game of the 1984 World Series in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
He formed a number of promising bands over the years, but nothing seemed to 
gel. In the meantime, Cameron developed a second career custom-painting model 
trains. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last summer, he and several other local musicians, experienced players in 
their 40s and 50s, came together at the behest of conga player Armando Rosas, 
who wanted a band he could work with at the Cultural Center in Tijuana, where 
he was booking shows. 
</P>
<P>
At their debut concert, even the headliners, another impromptu group, including 
local sax man Charles McPherson, Chet Baker, pianist Frank Strazzeri and L.A. 
session drummer John Guerin, thought the locals were hot. So they decided to 
stick together as Algo Caliente. 
</P>
<P>
Although the band plays an occasional fusion tune, the emphasis is on 
percussion-based Latin sounds, including spicy new takes on old standards such 
as " 'Round Midnight" and newer numbers such as David Benoit's "Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
Algo Caliente is considering a more marketable name, Cameron said, perhaps Hot 
Vasquez, borrowed from the group's percussionist and drummer Carlos Vasquez. 
Besides Cameron and Vasquez, Algo Caliente includes Mel Goot on keyboards, Russ 
Caldwell on percussion, Esteban Favela on saxes and Chuck Shiele on bass, with 
occasional guest percussionists. 
</P>
<P>
This Friday and Saturday nights, it will be at Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach, 
and it will play Croce's in downtown San Diego most Friday nights during 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Thanksgiving Day, KSDS-FM (88.3) is celebrating the 50th anniversary of 
Blue Note, the influential jazz label. 
</P>
<P>
From 9 to 9, they will run down a virtual history of jazz, from boogie to bop 
and into the future. Don't miss the special Blue Note history segment, a 
company documentary, airing at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
John Coltrane, Jackie McLean, Dexter Gordon, Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, Lee 
Morgan, Horace Silver and Lou Donaldson are among the featured artists. Along 
with playing Blue Note's CD reissues of great albums, KSDS will air a few 
rarities, such as "Money Jungle," a 1962 piano trio album, Duke Ellington's 
only project for the label. It features four previously unheard Ellington tunes 
discovered when the original tapes were pulled to remix them for reissue. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Tonight at 7, the 10th annual San Diego Thanksgiving Dixieland Jazz 
Festival opens at the Town &amp; Country Hotel in Mission Valley. Among the 
bands making their first festival appearance are the Paramount Jazz Band from 
Boston, the Frisco Syncopators from New Orleans and the Norwegian Magnolia Jazz 
Band. The festival continues through Sunday. Tickets good for all four days of 
music are $55; day passes are also available. . . . This Friday and Saturday 
nights at Croce's in downtown San Diego, it's sax man Joe Marillo, who just 
made a digital demo recording at Diego's Loft.

Schumann Manuscript Gets Top Dollar: A 150-year-old manuscript of Robert 
Schumann's only finished piano concerto sold at auction in London on Wednesday 
for a record $1.38 million. Oxford book dealer Albi Rosenthal, who beat two 
rival bidders, said the signed manuscript will go to a library in West Germany 
where music scholars will have access to it. The concerto, started in 1841, was 
written by Schumann for his wife, Clara Wieck, a piano virtuoso, who first 
performed it four years later in Dresden. The previous record for a single 
music manuscript, $471,000 for Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring," was broken at the 
start of the sale when an anonymous bidder paid $673,000 for a Bach Cantata. 
But the record lasted for less than two hours before Rosenthal made his bid for 
the Schumann work. SHAUNA SNOW

MORNING REPORT: 'WORKING GIRL' STILL WORKING ITS MAGIC

Surprisingly strong, "Working Girl" continues to lead the Billboard rental 
chart, but this may be its last week on top because a major Top Five overhaul 
is in the works. So far, "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" is the only holiday 
blockbuster to make a big splash on the rental chart. But in the next week or 
two, look for "Rain Man," "Major League" and "Pet Sematary" to be squeezed out 
of the Top Five by some of the heavy-hitting newcomers. "Say Anything," the 
teen romantic comedy starring Ione Skye, is doing terrific rental business, 
much better than expected from a movie that grossed a decent but unspectacular 
$20 million in theaters. It shot up to No. 7 in just two weeks. "Batman" 
debuted on the sales chart -- a gauge of what's shipped to stores -- at No. 9 
but should roust "Roger Rabbit" out of the top spot in the next week or two. 
</P>
<P>
* Bill Murray will be in heavy competition with himself this weekend. His 
"Scrooged" -- a hip, comic version of "A Christmas Carol" that grossed over $58 
million at the box office -- entered the chart at No. 12 and should barge into 
the Top Five next week. Murray also stars in "Ghostbusters II," which came out 
Wednesday and promises to be the top new rental of the Thanksgiving weekend.

KID BEAT: 'BLAST OFF!' REACHES FOR THE STARS AT THEATRE WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"Blast Off! A Musical Mission to Mars" is a definite hit with theatergoers 6 
and younger, but one message it sends out is thoughtlessly pre-glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
This well-meaning Storybook Theatre production at Theatre West, staged by Lloyd 
J. Schwartz (he also wrote the book and lyrics), features audience 
participation, perky music by Ben Lanzarone and does make a valid point: 
"Different is OK." 
</P>
<P>
The uncredited set design is spare -- just a few geometric shapes and a 
cartoonish painted rocket ship that opens up. 
</P>
<P>
American astronaut Tom (Joe Lucas) and Soviet cosmonaut Ivana (Catherine 
MacNeal) decide to make a joint flight to Mars, accompanied by a robot called 
MT1 (Nadine Kalmes) and unintentional guest Mrs. Seltzer (Barbara Mallory 
Schwartz). 
</P>
<P>
"Dolling, I can't go to Mars. I've got the girls coming over!," she protests. 
In fussy coat and squashy hat, nervously clutching her purse, Mallory Schwartz 
is a sketch. 
</P>
<P>
The audience continually gets in the act. They're the "crew" on a bumpy space 
ride, dodging meteors and coming in for a landing. 
</P>
<P>
On Mars, a furry space creature (Janice Ehrlich) invites a dozen children on 
stage to teach them the Jupiter Jump. The seated audience bounces along. 
</P>
<P>
The professional cast handles all the participation comfortably. That ease is 
the show's best quality. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lucas' stalwart Tom complements the zaniness around him, while 
Kalmes is an especially appealing robot (Rosetta Gitlin did the show's crisp 
choreography). 
</P>
<P>
But there's a hitch: MacNeal is required to offer the usual aggressive Soviet 
stereotype -- she wants to zap the space creature on sight, her dialogue is 
cluttered with words ending in ski and she says thank you in English, because, 
she explains, Soviets don't like to say it. 
</P>
<P>
It's the clinker in an otherwise pleasant hour. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3333 Cahuenga Blvd. West in Hollywood through Dec. 9, Saturdays at 1 p.m., 
(818) 761-2203; $5.

KID BEAT: TWO VARIED PRODUCTIONS AT THE WEST END PLAYHOUSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When your co-star is a life-size "flying" car with googly eyes, a propeller 
nose and the voice of an adorable, precocious preschooler, you have to work 
hard not to be upstaged. 
</P>
<P>
In "Be-Bop Sizzle Pop!," a Back Alley Theatre production at the West End 
Playhouse, human cast members David Pinto and Monty Turner have to work harder. 
They take a back seat to the mechanical wonders of Tune Buggy. 
</P>
<P>
Pinto and Turner wrote the hour of mostly ear-pleasing songs and stories for 
preschoolers. Pinto, as the Captain, operates Tune Buggy and provides keyboard 
accompaniment. Turner, his mop-haired, deliberately childish sidekick, gets the 
audience involved and plays storyteller. 
</P>
<P>
Tune Buggy (last seen in Lois Young's "Pancakes" at the Back Alley) runs on 
magic words -- that's where the show's title comes in -- and on purple jelly 
beans supplied by Monty and eager audience volunteers. When Tune Buggy forgets 
his manners, the audience helps him remember please and thank you. 
</P>
<P>
His propeller spins, his eyes roll and his wings light up, ready to take the 
Captain and Monty to the Zoo, Rememberland or the town of Unga Bunga. Each stop 
is an excuse for a silly song or story. "The Monster Bird of Unga Bunga" and 
the title song are the biggest crowd-pleasers. 
</P>
<P>
Pinto and Turner need to find their rhythm together. Low-key Pinto requires 
more presence and Turner is obviously tense. Tune Buggy, however, is 
irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Dec. 31, Saturdays at 10 a.m. and noon; Sundays and Dec. 26-Dec. 29 at 
11 a.m. and 1 p.m. Tickets, $6.50; (818) 780-2240. LYNNE HEFFLEY

"The Wonder Faire" at the West End Playhouse is a treat for children and 
adults. The one-man Dance-on-Wheels production features Gideon Potter in 45 
minutes of mime and comic nonsense, much of it involving the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Potter, a long-jawed, highly physical performer, not only resembles actor John 
Cleese, but brings a Monty Python-like (non)sensibility to his offbeat 
children's show. 
</P>
<P>
In a sketch about the right way to eat -- sandwich first, then dessert -- a 
lunch box takes on a surprising life of its own. A tale about an old man, a 
fish and a bird adopting a wolf with criminal tendencies is told with masks and 
humorous body language. 
</P>
<P>
When chubby toddlers and whimsical adults from the audience are invited on 
stage and threaten to run away with the show, Potter maintains control, while 
adding to the levity offstage and on. It's over all too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7446 Van Nuys Blvd. in Van Nuys, indefinitely, Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets, 
$6; (818) 990-5807. LYNNE HEFFLEY

KID BEAT: MERMAID THEATRE TOURS WITH 'JUST SO STORIES'

<P>
The respected Mermaid Theatre of Nova Scotia made a rare Southland tour stop 
this weekend, bringing a striking production of Rudyard Kipling's "Just So 
Stories" to audiences in Orange County and Caltech's Ramo Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Adapted and directed by Graham Whitehead, "How the Camel Got His Hump," "The 
Sing Song of Old Man Kangaroo," "The Elephant's Child" and "The Cat Who Walked 
by Himself" were brought to exuberant life by the four-member troupe. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Miller's eye-catching organic design -- nubby fabrics, woven mats and 
pillars and his over-sized masks and puppets crafted from basketry, rope, fur 
and feathers -- plus Steven Naylor's original music played on gourds, drums and 
xylophones are just right for a show set "when the world was so new and all." 
</P>
<P>
The cast -- Sheldon Davis, Rhonda McLean and Kenneth Wilson-Harrington -- 
whether wearing costumes or manipulating puppets, uses deft body language to 
convey humor and well-observed characteristics of a whole gallery of animals 
including a monkey, hippo, ostrich, giraffe and snake, as well as the title 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Pitblado's narration, occasionally rushed a bit at Caltech to compete 
with very young, noisy audience members, remained true to Kipling's whimsical 
language. 
</P>
<P>
Old Man Kangaroo's "pride is inordinate," Yellow Dog Dingo grins "like a 
coal-scuttle," the camel is "most 'scrutiating idle," the elephant child is 
filled with " 'satiable curtiosity" and the cat "walks by his wild lone." 
</P>
<P>
The Mermaid Theatre has been performing in Canada and internationally since 
1972. Here's hoping it will return soon to the Southland. LYNNE HEFFLEY

SPIRITED SWING BY CRAWFORD, MCGRIFF IN BASIE BALLROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well into their third year as a double-bill, alto saxophonist Hank Crawford and 
organist Jimmy McGriff blew into town Tuesday evening for a one-night stand at 
the Count Basie Ballroom at the Compton Lazben Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Playing an early, free show for about 300 senior citizens, the duo, accompanied 
by guitarist Bob DeVos and drummer John (Ironman) Harris, strayed from their 
blues-laden path to serve a handsome set that included a pair of standards 
(three, actually, if you consider "America, the Beautiful" a standard) a ballad 
and a crowd-pleasing spiritual. Only one blues, "All Right, OK, You Win," was 
included. 
</P>
<P>
Though encumbered by ill-suited acoustics that rendered much of the music 
muddled and Crawford's announcements unintelligible, the quartet managed to 
convey its swing message with spirit. 
</P>
<P>
An opening "They Can't Take That Away From Me," swung gently and most pleased 
the handful of dancers who took to the mid-room dance floor. An unrecognized 
ballad followed, with Crawford exploring neatly the range of the alto saxophone 
in a series of solo choruses. 
</P>
<P>
McGriff was at his best on the blues, though both his comping and brief solo 
statements were effective on a lengthy rendition of "Satin Doll." Though the 
tune should have been retired from the jazz repertoire 20 years ago, it 
nonetheless provided a good vehicle for guitarist DeVos, a capable player whose 
solos were well-thought and superbly executed. 
</P>
<P>
Drummer Harris kept time like a fine Swiss watch and showed himself a team 
player with his attention to dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
"America, the Beautiful" was given too funky a rhythmic feel to capture the 
anthem's innate soulfulness, but it worked in giving way to "Lift Every Voice 
and Sing," a glorious spiritual whose first few notes were inspired enough to 
lift each of the attendees to sing. A. JAMES LISKA

SOFT MELODIES FLOW FROM NARELL'S STEEL PANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andy Narell's steel pan jazz has an undeniably light and sunny appeal. The 
sound of the steel pans, with their Caribbean references, as well as Narell's 
briskly rhythmic Latin melodies result in an amiable music that is easy on the 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Narell's quintet spent most of their late set Friday night at Santa Monica's At 
My Place cruising through music from a new Windham Hill album, "Little 
Secrets." The focus was on Narell, for the most part, and he made the best of 
it. His flowing melody lines unfolded with such ease that it was hard to 
believe he was coaxing them out of nothing more than a set of steel pans. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Steve Erquiaga also soloed effectively in a jazz-rock style that 
added a healthy seasoning of spice and pepper to the music's sometimes bland 
sound. Bassist Keith Jones was particularly effective on a piece titled "Heads 
or Tails," while percussionist Luis Conte and drummer Paul van Wageningen 
provided constantly changing rhythmic timbres. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the individual effectiveness of the musicians, there were times when 
the lack of emotional range in the music made attentive listening difficult. 
Too many lightly floating melodies and an occasional overdose of rhythmic 
Latinisms became -- like a too-sweet souffle -- a surfeit of airily empty 
calories. 
</P>
<P>
Narell's one or two appearances on piano revealed a more complex perspective on 
his music. Brief as they were, they suggested that his steel pan work might 
benefit from the richer harmonic vision and more detailed creative fabric 
present in his keyboard-oriented compositions. DON HECKMAN

'SECOND CHANCE': LOVE AND ALCOHOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Second Chance," a tightly wound, two-character drama at the Fig Tree Theatre, 
earns the ultimate compliment for a play about addictive behavior: the 
obsessions -- booze on the wife's part and love on the husband's -- sneak up on 
you as they do in real life. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Demmy Tambakos' chamber piece about the breakup of a young couple 
opens with a striking carnal embrace, segues into newly married giggles, then 
flattens into the domestic horror of the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
The production is not flawless (more about that later), but what keeps the 
material fresh is the deceptive momentum of the direction (Bruce McIntosh) and 
the credibility of the crumbling couple (Bennett Liss and Michelle McIntosh). 
</P>
<P>
McIntosh (who is Jennifer Jones' granddaughter) perfectly modulates the 
alcoholic's Indian summer of hazy tranquility before the winter of collapse. 
And Liss' likable husband is the mirror of disintegrating nerves until his 
coiled feelings explode in a physical outburst that is a cathartic jolt. To 
your horror, you feel the relief in the swing of the husband's fists as much as 
he must, and that's a terrifying emotion. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a play shuddering with the sense of firsthand experience. The danger in 
playing such characters is histrionics, but these actors never chew the scenery 
(a spare domestic set designed by the director). McIntosh's drinking, like 
amateur night, seems almost innocent. But her behavior twists in serpentine 
ways, like a light, chilly breeze. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, it is the husband who seems the more culpable partly because of 
his obsessive love for his wife. Not hard love, as they say in AA, but a 
helpless love. At the very end, he reaches out to Alanon and reflects: "I never 
knew the difference between love and pity." 
</P>
<P>
For all of this, the play is not a downer and it is never didactic. But the 
production is an aural distraction: weak acoustics are exacerbated by creeking 
footsteps from the loft above the theater, and a whirring portable fan hums 
throughout the show from a seat in the front row. That doesn't help McIntosh 
who, for all her skills, is vocally uneven and needs to project more. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6539 Santa Monica Blvd., Fridays through Sundays, 8 p.m., until Dec. 17. 
Tickets: $10; (213) 960-8870.

STATE AGENCY CLEARS LOMITA GROUP; LEADER CRITICIZES CITY INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The leader of a Lomita citizens' group criticized city officials at a council 
meeting Monday for seeking an investigation of his group by the state Fair 
Political Practices Commission, calling the action harassment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the tone of this is kind of obvious, and I think it's inappropriate," 
said Mark Hays, organizer of Citizens for a Better Lomita. 
</P>
<P>
But Hays said the group had been vindicated because the commission concluded 
that it was not in violation of state law. A commission spokeswoman confirmed 
that decision Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Charles Belba defended the city, saying the inquiry about the group's 
legality was intended to prevent "any problems down the line." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, Belba said the commission's decision "cleared the air. 
As far as I'm concerned, the matter is dead." 
</P>
<P>
In a Sept. 18 letter to the political practices agency, City Administrator 
Walker Ritter said the city attorney had issued an opinion that the Citizens 
for a Better Lomita was probably a political committee. Ritter asked that the 
commission examine whether the group is subject to regulation under the state 
Fair Political Practices Act. 
</P>
<P>
An opinion issued by Robert V. Wadden Jr. of Burke, Williams &amp; Sorensen, 
the law firm retained by the city, stated that if the group is a committee, had 
received contributions totaling more than $1,000 or was formed in support of a 
ballot measure, it must file statements of organization and campaign statements 
with local and state officials. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sandra Michioku, a commission spokeswoman, said Tuesday that the 
commission has concluded that the group did not violate state law and is not 
subject to regulation by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
"The group only opposed a proposed ordinance being voted on by the City 
Council," Michioku said. "There was no indication they supported any ballot 
measure or candidate. Consequently, the group has not received contributions or 
had expenditures of $1,000 or more in relation to campaign expenditures." 
</P>
<P>
Ritter said the city was notified of the commission's decision Tuesday but 
declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
At the council meeting, the city's request brought an angry response from Hays. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, to me the obvious conclusion is harassment," Hays told the council. 
"I would question whether the city has any business spending the city's money 
in investigating citizens' groups in this way." 
</P>
<P>
The cost for the city attorney's opinion was covered under the city's regular 
retainer fee for the law firm, Belba said. 
</P>
<P>
Hays, who represents a coalition of about 200 Lomita residents and business 
owners, first clashed with the city in 1987, after officials proposed an 
ordinance to rezone a mile-long corridor of Pacific Coast Highway in an effort 
to attract larger retail businesses. After making several revisions in response 
to the group's concerns, the City Council passed the ordinance this summer by a 
4-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Hays said he learned in September that the city had asked the political 
practices commission to investigate the group when he received a copy of the 
city attorney's opinion and a letter from the city, signed by Ritter. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's meeting, Belba said Hays had sent him a letter asking if the city 
had authorized Ritter's request to the commission for an investigation. Belba, 
who asked that the item be put on the council agenda, defended the city's 
action, saying the efforts to determine whether the group was operating legally 
were appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it was a wise move by the city manager if he thought there was a 
committee, a council member, a commissioner -- anyone within the purview of the 
city that fell under (the jurisdiction of) the act," Belba said. 
</P>
<P>
Belba said council authorization was not needed for Ritter to request a legal 
opinion about the group from the city attorney because the request was within 
Ritter's jurisdiction. He added that Ritter's request to the political 
practices panel was necessary because the city attorney's opinion was 
inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
Ritter did not discuss the issue at the council meeting but said Tuesday: "My 
position is (that) I fulfilled my obligation as a public official." In an 
interview, Hays called the city's action a witch hunt. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance disputed by Hays' group went into effect in August. It sets 
minimum standards for new commercial lots on Pacific Coast Highway of 100 feet 
in width and 10,000 square feet in area. 
</P>
<P>
Some owners of the small businesses that line the city's busiest commercial 
corridor had initially expressed concern that the new requirements would make 
their buildings nonconforming, but the city revised the ordinance to allow 
existing 50-foot-wide buildings. 
</P>
<P>
But Hays said he remains dissatisfied with a requirement that some businesses, 
including medical and other professional offices, be restricted to the second 
floor. He said after Monday's meeting that he plans to mount a campaign to 
place the issue on the city ballot in June.

versus developer Don S. Levin is the first jury trial to be transferred out of 
Torrance Superior Court into rented space as part of a program to cut the 
backlog of civil cases throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit, filed nearly six years ago, 187 members of the owners 
association maintain that their condominiums in the Manitoba West development 
in Playa del Rey have suffered serious damage because of shoddy construction. 
</P>
<P>
Condominium owner Sharon Rifelli took the stand Tuesday as the trial's first 
witness and said her home was repeatedly soaked with rainwater that seeped 
through a leaky ceiling. "Standing on the carpet, it was like a sponge that had 
not been wrung out," Rifelli said. "It was like a flood." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Levin and five subcontractors told the jury in their opening 
statements that construction of the condominiums in 1979 and 1980 was up to 
industry standards and that faulty maintenance, which is the province of the 
condominium association, explains many of the buildings' problems. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last four months. That's far too long to tie up a 
courtroom or one of Torrance's 11 sitting judges for a civil case. So they will 
pay the Elks $200 a day to use the lodge at 315 The Esplanade, next to the 
Redondo Beach Pier, to try this case. In addition, they have assigned it to 
retired Superior Court Judge George R. Perkovich Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no way they were going to try that case in the courthouse," said 
Arnold Pena, coordinator of Los Angeles County's civil Superior Courts. 
"Torrance doesn't have any courtrooms that are vacant, and they couldn't spare 
the space for that long." 
</P>
<P>
There are 460 civil cases set for trial in Torrance and 2,352 more waiting for 
a trial date. The average civil case takes 2 1/3 years to come to trial, though 
contentious cases can take much longer. 
</P>
<P>
Under the so-called "rent-a-judge" program, the county previously used rooms at 
the Torrance Marriott for hearings or non-jury trials. But the hotel could not 
assure court officials that they could get a room big enough for a lengthy jury 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Perkovich, a former member of the Inglewood and San Pedro Elks lodges, knew 
that lodge rooms are vacant during the day, so he called the Redondo Beach 
lodge and arranged the rental. 
</P>
<P>
On the first day of trial Tuesday in the incongruous setting, Perkovich forsook 
the green upholstered throne of the Exalted Ruler in favor of a well-worn 
leather swivel chair he had brought with him. 
</P>
<P>
Mounted on the wall above the judge's head is not the seal of the state of 
California but the head of a 12-point buck elk. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of four elk trophies in the room. Hanging from the ceiling is the 
Star of Fidelity -- one of Elkdom's ritual symbols -- alongside a large 
mirrored ball that provides ambience during ballroom dances. 
</P>
<P>
The surroundings will not be an obstacle to justice. "I can try them in a tent 
if I have to," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Minor modifications were made on the first day of trial. At the request of 
lawyers for the builders, spectators will not be able to sit in the seats 
across from the jury. Perkovich agreed that the reactions of spectators could 
distract or affect jurors. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also ordered during breaks that jurors remain in the Exalted Ruler's 
office, which has been converted to a jury room. "I've got to run this at least 
halfway like a courtroom," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Manitoba West homeowners said they would have preferred a 
traditional courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it here," said Gail Browning. "It's makeshift. It takes away from 
the seriousness of the case. It's like having a play on a basketball court." 
</P>
<P>
Another homeowner complained that spectators seats along one wall are too far 
away from the judge and witnesses. "We're just staring across at a blank wall," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a case with at least $15 million in damages at stake, it will take more than 
a few stuffed elk heads to distract a dozen lawyers from their arguments. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the jury is able to take the proceedings seriously, despite the 
surroundings, it's fine," said John Wallace, an attorney for one subcontractor. 
"I think they will."

NO ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY REQUIRED FOR MOBIL PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mobil Oil Corp. will be allowed to build a new, high-tech control room for its 
Torrance refinery without completing an environmental impact report, Torrance 
City Council members decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
City planners had recommended that Mobil be required to conduct the 
environmental study to give the city a broader overview of the company's plans 
to modernize and refurbish the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously to reject the staff recommendation, noting that 
planners failed to provide any legal justification for forcing Mobil to 
complete the report. 
</P>
<P>
Council members, however, warned Mobil that they plan to keep a close eye on 
future developments at the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
"I share with you very publicly my frustration . . . that we don't have the 
broad picture," Councilwoman Dee Hardison said, expressing concern that a 
series of planned improvements could increase the refinery's capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil plans to break ground on the 21,000-square-foot control room and a 
2,800-square-foot remote instrument enclosure early next month, refinery 
Manager Wyman Robb said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The new buildings and modern computer facilities will replace the refinery's 
existing 19,000-square-foot control room, which was built in 1967 and has been 
partially refurbished. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the refinery's existing controls are analog gauges, which require 
operators to constantly make fine adjustments in the refinery's processes. The 
new digital control devices will let computers make such adjustments 
automatically, allowing operators to maintain broader control of the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
"This will not increase the capacity of the refinery one iota," said attorney 
Dale Neal, who acted as Mobil's spokesman before the council. "It will take a 
system that is outdated, quite frankly, and replace it with the state of the 
art."

CONSERVANCY TRYING TO BUY PARCELS IN TOWSLEY CANYON; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: SANITATION OFFICIALS ENVISION A LANDFILL IN TOWSLEY CANYON. OTHERS 
SEE THE CANYON AS THE CENTERPIECE OF THE SANTA CLARITA WOODLANDS STATE PARK. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, criticized recently for trying to block 
acquisition of land for a dump in Elsmere Canyon, is trying to buy property in 
another Santa Clarita Valley canyon under consideration as a landfill site. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is Towsley Canyon, the scenic entrance to a pristine woodland west of 
Santa Clarita. Environmentalists hail the area as a unique collection of 
forests, meadows and waterfalls more reminiscent of Northern California than 
Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation officials, who say Towsley Canyon could hold up to 235 million tons 
of garbage, have obtained options to buy 760 acres in the canyon. 
Environmentalists say the 3,000-acre canyon would be the centerpiece of the 
proposed 6,000-acre Santa Clarita Woodlands State Park. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Edmiston, executive director of the conservancy, said the agency is 
negotiating with landowners to purchase property in Towsley Canyon. "We are 
assiduously putting together a package of options . . . working with as many 
consentual landowners as we can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston said Wednesday that it will be politically difficult to open a dump in 
Towsley Canyon because of its nearness to two other major dump sites. Los 
Angeles city and county officials are working on a tentative agreement to 
operate a dump in Elsmere Canyon, east of Santa Clarita and the Antelope Valley 
Freeway. Plans to expand the dump in nearby Sunshine Canyon make a dump in 
Towsley less likely, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Towsley is a really serious contender" as a dump site, he said, 
"and I'm about as landfill-paranoid as anyone." 
</P>
<P>
But Steve Maguin, head of solid waste management for the Sanitation Districts 
of Los Angeles County, said Towsley is still a serious candidate for a dump. 
The sanitation districts is negotiating with landowners to obtain options on 
most land in the canyon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan to tie up the entire area," Maguin said. 
</P>
<P>
As for a dump in Elsmere Canyon, "it's an important step forward, but it is not 
the total solution" to the county's mounting garbage crisis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the conservancy was criticized by county supervisors and Los 
Angeles city officials after secretly allying itself with a landfill developer 
in an effort to acquire three canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains for 
parkland. 
</P>
<P>
BKK Corp., which wanted to open a dump in Elsmere, said it would deed its 
Elsmere holdings to the conservancy, a public agency. That move would have 
prevented Los Angeles County from condemning the property because one public 
agency cannot condemn land held by another. With control of Elsmere, the 
conservancy would have had leverage to secure the canyons in the Santa Monicas 
for parks. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed agreement, the conservancy eventually would have returned 
Elsmere to BKK control, thus allowing the Torrance-based company to avoid 
county interference and to continue its landfill plans. But the deal fell 
through after Los Angeles County offered BKK more money for its interests, $125 
million, and the company agreed to sell. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Maguin said that he was not aware of the conservancy's efforts in 
Towsley and that it was too soon to predict how the sanitation districts would 
respond, if at all. But he said the conservancy's interest in Towsley Canyon 
probably will drive up land prices. 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston made the same complaint about the sanitation districts. The county 
"has been offering what we think are exorbitant amounts of money for these 
properties. Nobody wants to commit at a lower level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The land inside the proposed state park is held by a variety of owners, from 
families who have occupied the land for generations to Chevron Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
Among the property studied by the conservancy is 1,200 acres owned by the 
federal Bureau of Land Management, a portion of which lies outside the canyon, 
Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy hopes to purchase land in the proposed state park with about 
$1.7 million made available through recent legislation by state Sen. Ed Davis 
(R-Valencia), the first $500,000 of which will be available in January. Another 
bill by Davis directed the state Department of Parks and Recreation to assess 
whether the Santa Clarita Woodlands is suitable for a park. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita Woodlands State Park would receive at least $10 million 
through the California Wildlife Protection Initiative, which environmentalists 
hope to place on the statewide ballot next June. 
</P>
<P>
The county's land options in Towsley Canyon were obtained a year ago from Ash 
Inc., a Simi Valley developer that stands to make more than $22 million in 
tipping fees if a dump is opened in Towsley. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Howell, Ash Inc. president, said his company bought options on the 760 
acres in 1988. The company relinquished the options after the county agreed to 
pay Ash 11 cents for every ton of refuse dumped in Towsley. Ash would make a 
profit only if the landfill is opened, Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
Howell said his company is no longer looking for other land options in the area 
because he, like Edmiston, believes political pressure will block a landfill in 
Towsley Canyon.

ANTELOPE VALLEY DELIVERS 'REPORT CARD' ON HIGH SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE DISTRICT'S PARENTS ARE THE FIRST IN THE COUNTY TO BENEFIT FROM A 
NEW STATE LAW REQUIRING EVALUATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Parents of high school students in the Antelope Valley this week will become 
the first in Los Angeles County to get annual report cards assessing the 
performance of their children's schools, the result of a new statewide 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
The Antelope Valley Union High School District on Wednesday began mailing out 
nearly 8,600 "school accountability report cards" it prepared in compliance 
with a provision of Proposition 98, which was narrowly approved by state voters 
in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The proposition, sponsored by the California Teachers Assn. and other education 
groups, was intended to channel more state money into schools and carried the 
"report card" provision as an added inducement for voters. 
</P>
<P>
It required every public school, from elementary to high school, to prepare an 
annual report covering 13 areas of school performance, including student test 
scores, dropout rates, class sizes, spending per student, textbook quality, 
counseling services, teacher data, and school safety and cleanliness. 
</P>
<P>
State and local school officials said they believe the Antelope Valley district 
is the first in Los Angeles County and one of only several districts statewide 
to distribute the reports. Other districts must follow suit before the end of 
the school year next spring. 
</P>
<P>
The Antelope Valley reports painted a mostly upbeat picture of the district's 
six campuses. "I think we're very happy with them for a first go-around," said 
Robert Sanchez, the district's assistant superintendent for educational 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The four-page reports vary somewhat from school to school. But all generally 
give a positive, although not always telling, picture of the campuses. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, among the six school reports, only one mentioned gangs. However, 
concern about school security and mounting gang problems have dominated the 
debate among district board members for months and one campus had a gang melee 
recently. The district is considering adopting a tough anti-gang student dress 
code and a host of security measures. 
</P>
<P>
The last paragraph of the report on Antelope Valley High School noted, 
"Although the school is thought to be safe in general, there is a growing 
insecurity among the staff and students about the number of gang members and 
outbreaks of fights." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, who oversaw the preparation of the reports, acknowledged the lack of 
discussion about gang problems but insisted the district was not trying to 
gloss over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
He characterized this year's version "as basically a numbers report card" and 
promised that next year's would have "a more comprehensive approach to school 
climate and safety. It was not an intent to escape the issue entirely." 
</P>
<P>
On other topics, the reports addressed the district's problems with 
overcrowding, high dropout rates and a shortage of substitute teachers. They 
detailed district efforts to deal with those issues. They also referred to 
increases in students test scores, which generally improved throughout the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Under state guidelines, school districts must produce the reports and make them 
available to parents or others upon request. Districts are not required to send 
them out. But Sanchez said his district chose to mail them so they would be 
seen by as many parents as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest in the country with 
more than 600 schools, will not release its reports until early April, said 
Joan Evans, an administrative consultant for the district. And Los Angeles, 
like many larger districts, does not plan to mail out the reports because of 
the cost and work involved, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, many school officials were unhappy about the added burden of 
producing the annual reports, which all schools must release in November in 
future years. But many have come to see the reports as a way to bolster needed 
public support for school issues, education officials said.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO ACTION ON HOMELESS PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial request to set up a program for the homeless in Redondo Beach's 
Dominguez Park was held over Tuesday by the City Council until Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with an agenda so long that, according to Councilwoman Kay Horrell, "it 
would choke a good-sized camel," the council delayed discussion of the issue 
until its next meeting, even though dozens of homeless activists and 
neighborhood residents had come to debate the plan. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a request by Hope Chapel of Redondo Beach to distribute free food 
and clothing from a church-owned trailer that the church would place in 
Dominguez Park once a week for a 45-day test period. The goal, said Ron Mason 
of the chapel's Haven of Hope Ministry, is to gauge how many homeless people 
there are in the area and, based on that information, set up expanded programs 
for them if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials say there are few, if any, street people in Redondo Beach, 
and neighbors of Dominguez Park say they fear the program will draw transients 
from other parts of Los Angeles. Also of concern, they say, is the fear that 
the homeless will frighten or threaten the 150 youngsters who participate in 
Little League at the park.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN TO SHIP SAND TO CABRILLO BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 200,000 cubic yards of sand near the Hyperion sewage treatment plant in 
Playa del Rey would be dumped on Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro under a plan 
endorsed Wednesday by the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The sand would be used to replenish the outer beach, which suffers severe 
erosion because it is located outside the harbor's breakwater. The inner beach, 
which is protected inside the breakwater, would not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County, which maintains the beach, has agreed to prepare the 
various environmental documents for the plan, but the city still needs approval 
from, among others, the California Coastal Commission and the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan proposed by Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, the sand would be 
removed and hauled from Playa del Rey by contractors building an annex to the 
sewage treatment plant. It would then be spread across the beach by the city's 
Department of Recreation and Parks. City officials said they hope to award a 
contract for the hauling job next August.

NORTH HOLLYWOOD POLICE HOLD SCHOOL LIBRARY BOOK DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Police officials and a local bookseller Wednesday presented 
Lankershim Elementary School in North Hollywood with more than 300 books for 
the school's library, which was virtually empty until police started an annual 
book drive last year, police said. 
</P>
<P>
With Wednesday's delivery, the school library has more than 1,000 books, said 
Principal Velia Ortiz Jones. About half of the books delivered were donated by 
David Dutton, owner of Dutton's Books in North Hollywood, Sgt. Roger Deranian 
said. The other half were collected by local service organizations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On hand for the delivery were Dutton, Ortiz Jones and Capt. Rick Dinse, 
commander of the Police Department's North Hollywood division. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood Division officers came up with the idea for a book drive after 
the station adopted the school in the Los Angeles Unified School District's 
Adopt-a-School program two years ago, Deranian said. They discovered that the 
school had a modern library but owned only about 50 books. Ortiz Jones said the 
school's annual $3,000 book budget covers only a fraction of the books needed 
to fill the library. 
</P>
<P>
The Adopt-a-School program encourages local businesses and agencies to help 
schools by donating money, equipment, time and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The donated books cover all subjects and all grades, Ortiz Jones said. A large 
number are in Spanish, the predominant language at the school, Deranian said.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDALE MAN ACCUSED OF MOLESTING GIRL, 8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Criminal charges were filed Wednesday against a Glendale man accused of 
molesting an 8-year-old girl during a break-in at her parents' house last week, 
Glendale police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man took the girl from her bed and removed her clothes but fled when she 
screamed, Investigator Ron Insalaco said. 
</P>
<P>
The man allegedly burglarized another residence in his apartment building in 
the 1900 block of Vassar Avenue and is believed to have molested a woman during 
another burglary earlier this month, Insalaco said. 
</P>
<P>
The man told police his name is Ramon Hernandez, Insalaco said. But officers 
believe that is an assumed name because a check of his fingerprints revealed he 
has 21 known aliases, Insalaco said. 
</P>
<P>
He recently moved to Glendale from Oakland and appears to be in his mid-30s, 
Insalaco said. The man, who has a lengthy criminal record, including two prison 
terms, was being held in Los Angeles County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
After his arrest Monday at his apartment, police found $16,000 in cash and a 
loaded handgun in his car, Insalaco said.

REFLECTIONS: REALIZING HOW FREE WE ARE

Leni Jacksen is founder and principal of the Children's Community School in Van 
Nuys. The school's progressive education philosophy stresses social studies and 
culture. Jacksen, 70, and her husband, Eric, live in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
I'm originally from Berlin. And you can imagine how interested I am in what is 
going on right now. I'm a Jewish immigrant, and I came here in 1938 when I was 
18. 
</P>
<P>
All my school life was spent under Hitler, more or less. I was 13 when he came 
to power and even before that it was pretty bad, lots of anti-Semitism. It was 
very difficult to be in school. So I left the public school, and I went to a 
Jewish private school. 
</P>
<P>
What the Jews did in a big city like Berlin, they had their own schools. They 
also had their own newspaper because they couldn't work on the newspapers 
anymore. And they had their own theater, operas and concerts. And so they 
started a whole Jewish culture within the Nazi culture. 
</P>
<P>
I went back to Germany in 1971, and I was a principal in a very large 
German-American school called John F. Kennedy school in Berlin. They had 50% 
German employees and 50% American employees, and since I'm bilingual, I speak 
German fluently, of course, I was able to get a very good job there. 
</P>
<P>
The life in Berlin was marvelous, actually terrific. But you were completely 
surrounded by a hostile country, East Germany. I found it difficult. After a 
year, I couldn't stand it anymore. I had a two-year contract and I broke the 
contract because I was very uncomfortable, so I came back here. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't realize how free we are here. You can't imagine what it is to go 20 
miles and there's the border, and in all directions you are surrounded and you 
can't get through. And that wall is awful. An 8-foot wall with wire on top and 
machine guns and towers all over the East German side, guards always looking at 
you with binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
So I know a little bit what life was like. That's why this is marvelous now. 
What's happening now is a miracle. Nobody expected it. That was so fast. I do 
nothing but listen to the news, morning, noon and night, and it fascinates me. 
</P>
<P>
I feel that the media in this country is really not doing a very good job. They 
show the picture, they tell you how great it is, but they should give more 
insight. They don't even discuss the consequences. And they're tremendous. 
</P>
<P>
It's not without reason that the people are saying, "No reunification." A 
Frenchman said he loves Germany so much that he wants two of them. This is 
really what it is. Two Germanys are safe. One Germany is not. I think England 
and France or Denmark, Belgium, Holland for that matter, I mean these countries 
who have suffered under Germany, why would they want a big Germany again? So I 
think you will hear much more. It isn't over yet. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think I would ever want to live permanently in any other country. And 
I've been almost everywhere with the exception of Asia. I have family in South 
America, where I was several times. And of course I have friends all over 
Europe, and I have friends in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
There is a generosity of spirit here, even the spending of money, the way 
people go about it, the way people take chances. They gain it and they lose it 
and they gain it. There is not the terrible stigma attached to failure. If you 
declare bankruptcy in Germany, you are on the bottom. I mean you just don't do 
this. 
</P>
<P>
There is a certain gambling spirit in this country which I love. I started this 
school 10 years ago on a shoestring, on nothing. And now we have 100 students. 
In Germany I would have had to wait 10 years before I even started it because 
of this regulation and that regulation. "Are you sure? Is everything perfect?" 
</P>
<P>
Here you can take chances. If it works it works. If it doesn't work, well, it 
doesn't work. Then you do something else. There is a spirit here that is 
wonderful. And I think we'll come through.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TOPANGA CANYON ROAD PROJECT EXPECTED TO TAKE 11 
MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Motorists can expect lengthy delays for the next 11 months on Topanga Canyon 
Road between Pacific Coast Highway and Topanga as workers resurface 4.8 miles 
of the highway, California Department of Transportation officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The two-lane state highway will be topped with a new asphalt and concrete 
surface from the Pacific Coast Highway to half a mile north of Old Topanga 
Canyon Road, which is about five miles south of the Ventura Freeway, Caltrans 
spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli said. About 18,000 motorists use the road each 
day, most of them traveling between the San Fernando Valley and Pacific Coast 
Highway, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to cost $1.8 million and should be completed by late 
October, 1990, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Construction crews will reinforce the road's metal beam guardrails and 
reconstruct shoulder areas and slopes next to the highway, Tiritilli said. A 
highway bridge over Topanga Canyon Creek will be widened to 40 feet, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The resurfacing will begin Dec. 6 and the bridge widening is scheduled to start 
in April, she said. Construction will take place between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. 
weekdays, she said. 
</P>
<P>
During the resurfacing of short stretches of the road, one lane will remain 
open and motorists will be flagged through in alternating directions, she said.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STRICT CONTROLS SOUGHT ON ADULT BOOKSTORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles city attorney's office filed a lawsuit Wednesday seeking strict 
controls on the operation of a North Hollywood adult bookstore where police 
have made 21 lewd-conduct arrests and several prostitution arrests in the last 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
The J&amp;B Bookstore in the 10900 block of Vanowen Street has been "a center 
for lewd conduct and prostitution" and needs to develop "a degree of decorum," 
said Ted Goldstein, a spokesman for the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Store Manager Steven Wiener and owners Ambros and Friederike Dragojevic, and 
Dan and Silvia Gerstner could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The suit accused them of creating a public nuisance under a section of the 
state penal code called the Red Light Abatement Law, Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
The civil suit asks a judge to order the store's operators to install more 
lights and to hire a 24-hour private guard to patrol the premises, Goldstein 
said. No court date has been set.

QUESTIONS LINGER AFTER MANLEY'S BANISHMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Several years ago, before he became vice president of the Baltimore Orioles, 
Calvin Hill was trying to help a group of nearly a dozen Cleveland Browns stop 
taking drugs. A sympathetic and understanding man, Hill said one day he got so 
exasperated in one of the private sessions with the players that he blew his 
stack. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were my team, I'd get rid of all of you guys," Hill told them. 
</P>
<P>
One of the players responded: "Okay, but if you get rid of all of us, all 
you'll do is draft some more (drug users) the next time." 
</P>
<P>
Hill said he thought long and hard about what the player told him. 
</P>
<P>
"It made a lot of sense," Hill said Wednesday. "Part of the problem is we live 
in a throw-away society, so if one player has a problem, we just get rid of him 
and get another. I guess I learned that if I were a coach, I'd have some 
sensitivity to the drug issue. It's an ever-increasing problem that the 
professional leagues will continue to have to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Washington Redskins defensive end Dexter Manley was suspended 
indefinitely for a third violation of the NFL's pro leagues is the NBA's. That 
league rewards a player who volunteers that he needs help: twice a player can 
volunteer for treatment without being banned. The first time he is suspended 
with pay; the second time, suspended without pay. Both times the team pays for 
the treatment and the player is reinstated when the treatment ends. 
</P>
<P>
Testing is done only when an independent expert determines there is reasonable 
cause. Then the player is tested four times in six weeks. If he fails one of 
the random tests, he is banned for life, but can apply for reinstatement after 
two years. If he refuses to be tested, he is banned for life. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-Redskins free safety Mark Murphy, a former official of the NFL Players 
Association, said the NBA policy is a good guideline from which to work. 
</P>
<P>
"What I would do is concentrate on players when they first start their 
careers," Murphy said. "I'd start at the scouting combines and really focus on 
career counseling for their lives after football. I'd encourage them to do 
other things. I always thought the drug problems were worse in the offseason. 
I'd like to see the league push summer internships or programs to get them back 
to school. But the NFL fears that would take them away from football." 
</P>
<P>
Hill would like to see all teams institute programs like the Browns' Inner 
Circle substance-abuse program, which he oversaw from 1982-86. Confidentiality 
is vitally important; Hill said for a year, even the Cleveland beat reporters 
thought he was there as an offensive consultant. 
</P>
<P>
If a team doesn't start its own program, it should hire someone to help players 
in their after-care and rehabilitation, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a player like Dexter Manley worth half a million dollars, and then 
he's gone," Hill said. "It might be wise on the team's part to hire someone 
internally to monitor the after-care." 
</P>
<P>
Hill also would "mandate" that every owner and head coach be required to spend 
a day or two at a treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
In March 1986, the NFLPA proposed that a confidential and independently run 
drug program be instituted by the league. The first positive test would be met 
with rehabilitation and after-care from an independent source. The second would 
be punished by a fine that would be 1-16th of a player's salary. The third 
offense would be a permanent ban. This program was not instituted. 
</P>
<P>
"The penalties now are not so much for the addict as a deterrent for other 
players," Murphy said. "What is the magic of 30 days? They treat it like a knee 
injury, that it will be over in 30 days. This is a lifetime problem." 
</P>
<P>
A 30-day suspension means different things for different athletes. Manley 
received 30 days during training camp in 1988, which amounted to losing next to 
no money and missing out on the least-liked month of the season. Linebacker 
Lawrence Taylor of the New York Giants also was punished for a second time that 
year, but he missed four regular-season games and lost one-fourth of his 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between Manley's case and Taylor's? 
</P>
<P>
The date they were tested and their urinalysis was evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, that's a mistake the league made," Murphy said. "It was supposed to be 
the exact same penalty, but it wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
If the NFL plans to make changes in its policy, it won't say so publicly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm comfortable with the policy," Tagliabue said through Browne. "It's a good 
balance of education, testing, counseling and discipline. It's a constructive 
and realistic policy."

HARPER SPARKS CLIPPERS; 
</P>
<P>
NBA: GUARD ACQUIRED FROM CAVALIERS SCORES 21 POINTS AND HAS 15 REBOUNDS IN HIS 
DEBUT TO LEAD 106-97 VICTORY OVER NETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
This is why 500 respondents to a phone-in survey by the Akron Beacon Journal 
voted, by a 3-to-1 margin, that the Cleveland Cavaliers made a bad trade. This 
is why one of the callers added, "I'm a season-ticket holder. Who wants my 
tickets?" 
</P>
<P>
This is why the Clippers wanted Ron Harper. 
</P>
<P>
Starting at shooting guard in his debut and often displaying the flashy style 
that promises to make him a crowd favorite, Harper was not flawless Wednesday 
night, but he did play well in the first half and then provided a 
fourth-quarter spark to help the Clippers defeat the New Jersey Nets, 106-97, 
before a crowd of 8,416 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"I made some good stuff happen and I made some bad stuff happen," said Harper, 
acquired last Thursday in the trade that sent Reggie Williams and the rights to 
Danny Ferry to the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
Far more good than bad, though. One of four Clippers to finish with 20 or more 
points -- led by Charles Smith's game-high 26 -- Harper had 21 points and 15 
rebounds, seven of which came on the offensive end. 
</P>
<P>
He also came in with the Clippers (3-5) behind, 87-84, with 9:31 to play. He 
never went out, and the Nets, who had a total of 14 points in the fourth 
quarter, were outscored, 22-10, the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I came out and got into the flow of the game early," Harper said, 
adding he was nervous at the outset. "My teammates gave me a lot of easy 
baskets, which helped. Once I felt comfortable, my ballgame started coming 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Benoit Benjamin, who ended his contract holdout last Thursday, played 11 
minutes. He scored one point, had two rebounds and two blocked shots in his 
first appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so-so," said Benjamin, who made a contribution to the Clippers opening a 
double-digit lead in the first half. "It was all OK. I wasn't happy, but I 
wasn't disappointed. It was about what I expected." 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Coach Don Casey was satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight, he went just enough (minutes)," Casey said. "He was a little sore 
from our workouts, and he went good." 
</P>
<P>
After back-to-back poor-shooting quarters (36.4% in the second and 43.5% in the 
third), the Clippers trailed, 83-80, entering the final period. They stayed 
close before going ahead, 90-89, on Smith's turn-around jumper on the left 
baseline with 7:35 to play, and never lost the lead. 
</P>
<P>
First impressions: Harper hit his initial shot, a 15-foot jumper from just to 
the left of the free-throw line, making it 2-2. New Jersey's Joe Barry Carroll 
missed on the next possession, and Harper's rebound started an eventual layup 
by Smith. Chris Morris missed, Harper rebounded. Moments later, Harper has his 
third rebound. 
</P>
<P>
It was 8-2 when Harper stole the ball from Dennis Hopson, came down two-on-one 
against Morris and dished off to Norman for a 10-2 lead. Three minutes into the 
game, New Jersey called timeout and the Clippers came off to a standing 
ovation. 
</P>
<P>
More first impressions: Benjamin, overweight but having fared well in three 
days of hard practices, debuted with 9:44 to play in the second quarter. On his 
25th birthday, he received a bigger reaction from the crowd than Harper, most 
of it positive. Within 10 seconds, he swatted away a shot by Hopson. 
</P>
<P>
He came out in favor of Smith with 5:36 remaining. This time, all the reaction 
was positive. The Clippers led, 49-36, meaning they went 10-4 with Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey, which lost its fifth in a row and is 3-7, fell 13 behind on several 
occasions in the second quarter. The Nets made up some ground but still trailed 
at the half, 58-51, despite the Clippers shooting just 36.4% in the period. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a great start, played hard and with enthusiasm," said Smith, who scored 
16 points in the first half. "We got sort of lackadaisical when we went up by 
13. We started to coast a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing they couldn't change. 
</P>
<P>
Harper went five of nine from the field in the first half for 11 points to go 
with seven rebounds, three steals and no turnovers in 19 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
A good first impression, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Danny Manning will be examined again Monday by Dr. Steven Lombardo, and the 
Clippers are projecting his return for the Nov. 29 home game against the 
Milwaukee Bucks. Manning says he ready now, but others, such as Lombardo and 
General Manager Elgin Baylor, prefer to see how Manning's knee reacts after 
several days of intense practice. . . . Reggie Williams made his debut with the 
Cleveland Cavaliers Wednesday night, getting five points and one rebound in 
five minutes. Cavalier Coach Lenny Wilkens' thinking is much like Williams', 
that this is a chance for a new start after a disappointing two-plus seasons 
with the Clippers. "I think a lot of Reggie's problems had to do with the 
environment he was in," Wilkens told the Cleveland Plain Dealer. "He was a kid 
who came from a structured situation (at Georgetown) to one in which there was 
a lack of discipline. I am basing a lot of what I like about him from what I 
remember about him from college." 
</P>
<P>
Harper, a lifelong Ohio resident, has spent much of his first days in Los 
Angeles hunting for a townhouse or condo. His reaction to the prices was not 
surprising. "I knew it would be bad, but, wow," he said. "I said, 'Man, I need 
a new contract quick.' ". . . . The Nets scored seven points, an all-time team 
low, in the third quarter Tuesday night, when they turned a 10-point halftime 
lead into a 114-84 loss at Seattle. "I'm sure every guy in the CBA who sees 
that third-quarter score is going to have his agent calling New Jersey," Coach 
Bill Fitch said.

'WE WILL GET MARK DAVIS,' LAWYER FOR PADRES SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fred Lane, the Chicago-based attorney retained by Padre owner Joan Kroc to 
handle negotiations with free-agent pitcher Mark Davis, said Wednesday that the 
Padres will sign Davis. 
</P>
<P>
But there has been no progress in Lane's negotiations with Alan Hendricks, 
Davis' agent, and Wednesday Hendricks was more interested in the deals of other 
players such as Minnesota's Kirby Puckett. 
</P>
<P>
Lane also said he has been in touch with Arn Tellem, Mark Langston's agent, and 
expects to be in a position to make an offer to Langston sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
As for Davis, Lane and Hendricks talked earlier this week, but Lane didn't make 
an offer. Lane said he now figures to make one toward the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to get Mark Davis . . . we will get Mark Davis," Lane 
said. "We will get him, and it will be a fair arrangement for both of us." 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"Because we want him, and he wants us," Lane said. "We'll work it out." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hendricks: "I'm happy they feel that way. That's nice. Somebody is going 
to get him. I'm not pulling for or against the San Diego Padres. But I have to 
worry about what's best for Mark Davis and his family. If that's concurrent 
with what's best for the San Diego Padres, I'd be happy." 
</P>
<P>
Lane originally planned to make an offer to Hendricks Monday but didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I can only make a deal with people who are prepared to listen," he said. "They 
need to do more shopping." 
</P>
<P>
With every new player signing this winter, that shopping list becomes more 
complicated for the Padres. Puckett, who wasn't eligible yet for free agency, 
agreed to a three-year, $9-million contract Wednesday. The Yankees signed 
free-agent pitcher Pascual Perez, 9-13 for Montreal last season, to a 
three-year contract worth $5.7 million Tuesday. Friday, Kansas City signed 
pitcher Bret Saberhagen, the American League Cy Young award winner, to a 
three-year contract extension for $8.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the Padres) can make their proposal any time they want," Hendricks said. 
"They seem to want to wait until they see what the market is. Puckett and Perez 
have signed in the last 24 hours, and Saberhagen, (Nick) Esasky and (Kevin) 
Bass have all signed. That's what the market is to me." 
</P>
<P>
Two free agents were signed last week: Atlanta signed Esasky, a first baseman, 
to a deal reported to be worth $5.7 million over three years, and San Francisco 
signed Bass, an outfielder, to a three-year package worth $5.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Saberhagen and Perez, both starting pitchers, are most relevant to Davis, the 
National League Cy Young Award winner. 
</P>
<P>
"I read last week where a reliever won't command as much money as a starter, 
but that viewpoint isn't shared by very many clubs," Hendricks said. "As a 
matter of fact, some clubs have told me that a reliever is worth more than a 
starter because he's in more games and has more opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Davis is seeking a four-year contract for what sources have said is as much as 
$10 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The contract's length is important, and that has been well-chronicled," 
Hendricks said. "We've got to solve that. I'm of the opinion that Mark Davis is 
as valuable as anybody on the free agent market." 
</P>
<P>
A New York newspaper reported last week that the Yankees had made an offer for 
Davis, but Hendricks wouldn't confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to say anything publicly that will help or hinder the process," 
Hendricks said. "All I will confirm is that we have a lot of interested teams, 
and that shouldn't be shocking news to anybody. They know we have a stated 
asking price, and whoever meets it will get him. Period." 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks said he would like to have Davis signed by the end of the winter 
meetings, which are Dec. 2-7 in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
As for Langston, Lane said he and Tellem discussed terms Tuesday, but the 
Padres will not make a formal offer until next week. 
</P>
<P>
"Men who have top-flight pitchers seem to be checking the market out 
thoroughly," Lane said.

The boys of summer are turning into the senior citizens of winter. 
</P>
<P>
Age, old folks are fond of saying, is a state of mind. Legally, however, senior 
citizenship depends on what you're doing. For Social Security, it's 65. For the 
Senior Olympics, it's 55. In golf, if you're an amateur it's 55, but if you're 
a professional, it's only 50. 
</P>
<P>
The Senior Professional Baseball Assn., an organization grasping to catch the 
coattails of the financially booming Senior PGA Tour, has set its minimum age 
for membership at 35. Except for catchers. They're deemed old men at 32. 
</P>
<P>
Eight teams of mostly former major league baseball players are playing a 
72-game schedule in South Florida that started Nov. 1 and will continue through 
January. All the cities are home to major league teams during spring training.

There are no Hall of Famers on display, but the rosters include such marquee 
names as Cy Young winners Rollie Fingers, Vida Blue, Mike Cuellar and Ferguson 
Jenkins; batting champion Bill Madlock, home run king Dave Kingman and recent 
World Series standouts Luis Tiant, Graig Nettles, Bernie Carbo, Paul Blair, Hal 
McRae and George Foster. 
</P>
<P>
Managers include Dick Williams and Earl Weaver, a pair of volatile, 
umpire-baiting World Series winners. Williams, 61, took three teams to the 
Series, winning with Oakland in 1972 and 1973. Weaver, 59, led Baltimore to 
four American League championships and a Series victory in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner is Curt Flood, a longtime St. Louis Cardinal outfielder who 
will be remembered more for being the player who forced major league baseball 
to accept free agency than for his lifetime .293 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
The success of the venture, however, may depend not on how much talent is on 
display, but on the flight of the snowbirds. 
</P>
<P>
Snowbirds, in Florida, are those hordes of Northerners who flock this way each 
winter to soak up tropical sunshine while the neighbors they left behind are 
bundled up against bitter cold. 
</P>
<P>
They will find familiar names in the SPBA box scores, names they once saw in 
Detroit, Boston, New York or Pittsburgh box scores. 
</P>
<P>
The teams are the St. Petersburg Pelicans, Orlando Juice, Bradenton Explorers 
and Winter Haven Super Sox in the northern division, and West Palm Beach 
Tropics, Gold Coast Suns, Ft. Myers Sun Sox and St. Lucie Legends in the 
southern division. The top two teams in each division will play off for the 
championship after the 72-game schedule. 
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the Institute for Public Opinion Research at Florida 
International University disclosed that New Yorkers account for 18.5% of all 
the citizens of South Florida -- a figure larger than that of either native 
Floridians or Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no denying it, we're looking for the tourists and the retired folks 
from major league country to support us," said Peter Lasser, SPBA executive 
vice president, from his New York office. "We figure we need to average between 
1,800 and 2,000 a game to make it our first year." 
</P>
<P>
They're not getting it. 
</P>
<P>
West Palm Beach, Williams' team, had the largest single attendance, 3,304 on 
opening night, but dropped to 638 for the next game. Most disappointing have 
been Miami, where Weaver's Gold Coast Suns play with a largely Latin lineup; 
Bradenton, which has the only park in the league without lights; and Orlando, 
where Walt Disney World and the Epcot Center offer heavy competition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to draw here until the snowbirds start arriving," said Ralph 
Lindstrom, a not-very-busy usher at Bradenton. "Folks hereabouts work on 
weekdays, and on weekends most everyone watches college and pro football on the 
tube. Florida is big when it comes to football. 
</P>
<P>
"The snowbirds usually start arriving right after Thanksgiving. Things should 
start to pick up then. At least I hope so." 
</P>
<P>
Gold Coast, with Cuban favorite Tiant pitching, attracted 1,023 for its home 
opener. Orlando, with Madlock in the lineup, averaged only 544 through its 
first six home games and last Monday night against Gold Coast had only 290. 
</P>
<P>
"What has impressed me the most is the seriousness of the players," Williams 
said. "Some of them, like Tim Stoddard, who was pitching for Cleveland before 
he was cut at the All-Star break a couple of months ago, are looking for 
another shot at the majors. You'd be surprised how many scouts are looking at 
us, the way they look at the Latin leagues this time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"And the guys who know their major league careers are over are looking at it as 
a second chance to play a few more years. The quality is surprisingly good. I'd 
say it's somewhere between triple A and the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much experience on the field that it offsets the speed and youth 
you see in triple A." 
</P>
<P>
Speed is what's missing most -- speed on the fastball, speed on the basepaths 
and speed in running down balls in the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Stoddard can still bring it around 90 (m.p.h.) on occasion, and Ike (Juan 
Eichelberger) is around 87, 88 all the time," Williams said of his two star 
pitchers. "And I've got six guys I'll turn loose on the bases, too. Mickey 
Rivers is my leadoff man and he still drives the guys crazy on the other side." 
</P>
<P>
All of which may be why Williams' Tropics have one of the best records in the 
fledgling league. They started off by winning seven in a row and are 12-4. 
</P>
<P>
When pitcher Pete Broberg, who bounced around the majors for eight years with 
five non-contenders, looked at a lineup behind him that included Kingman, 
Rivers, Toby Harrah, Tito Landrum, Rodney Scott, Lee Lacy and Jerry White, he 
said, "This lineup is better than any major league club that I've ever been 
on." Broberg is 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the games have been well played, but the other afternoon here at 
McKechnie Field, spring training home of the Pittsburgh Pirates, they had one 
to forget. There were 35 runs, 44 hits, seven home runs, five errors and as 
many more misplayed balls. 
</P>
<P>
Harder hit than the seven pitchers was an old moss-laden oak tree behind the 
left-field fence, where neighborhood youngsters waited for home run balls to 
bounce off the branches. 
</P>
<P>
West Palm Beach won it, 22-13. Only 448 were at the game. 
</P>
<P>
The hitters seem to have adapted better than the pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Ft. Myers has a team batting average of .325 and five of the eight teams are 
hitting better than .300. 
</P>
<P>
Amos Otis, 42, whose season-high home run output was 26 in a 17-year career 
that ended in 1984, hit nine in his first 10 games for Ft. Myers. During the 
regular season, Otis is a batting instructor for the San Diego Padres. Pat 
Dobson, the Ft. Myers manager, is a Padre pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
Winter Haven started the season with another pitcher, Bill Lee, the Spaceman, 
as manager. Lee stocked his roster with former Red Sox players, hoping that the 
Super Sox would attract fans who watch the Red Sox in the spring. Among them 
was Cuellar, 52, the league's oldest player. 
</P>
<P>
When Lee was asked what his instructions would be to his team, he replied: 
"When you slide, get up." 
</P>
<P>
Before the league was two weeks along, the Super Sox were trailing late in a 
game and had the bases loaded with the winning run on and two out when Lee 
inserted himself as a pinch-hitter. When he took a called third strike, the 
fans let him have it and team President Maxwell Mitchell responded by calling 
in Ed Nottle, manager of the triple-A Pawtucket team, to handle game strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Lee and Nottle are listed as co-managers. 
</P>
<P>
The worst thing about the league, Williams and Weaver insist, is the umpiring. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible, and that's the nicest thing I can say about the way the games 
are being called," Williams said. "They're all amateurs from local college and 
high school games, and they show it." 
</P>
<P>
Weaver added: "The league went for the cheapest umpiring association. Most of 
them are high school rejects." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Weaver was tossed out of the fifth game of the season and 
Williams went out two games later. Both have been ejected twice and the season 
is only three weeks along. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I've seen, I may get thrown out of every game the rest of the 
season," Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
One pitcher, with World Series credentials, added his anonymous comment: 
</P>
<P>
"The umpiring is so inconsistent that you never know how a pitch is going to be 
called. The strike zone seems to shrink or expand without any reason. It makes 
it tough on the pitchers, and I know it must be tough on the hitters, too. 
Don't tell them (umpires) I said that, though, because I don't want them to 
shrink it on me out of spite." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Horrow, president of the league, said the umpires are the best available, 
all members of the Gulf Coast Umpires Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Although the league was created for former major leaguers, there are a few 
Walter Mittys. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Mincberg, 41, a criminal law attorney from West Palm Beach, never played 
professional baseball at any level. 
</P>
<P>
A first baseman at the University of Connecticut 20 years ago, Mincberg opted 
for law school instead of pro baseball. Years later he joined the South Florida 
Amateur Baseball League and became a star in a league dominated by college 
players. 
</P>
<P>
When he heard about the Senior League, he sent a fax to Donald Sider, owner of 
the West Palm Beach franchise. Sider recommended he attend a Tropic tryout 
camp, where he caught the eye of manager Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit a couple out (of the ball park) and I'm told Dick liked what he saw," 
Mincberg said. "Then I had a game-winning hit in an exhibition game at Port St. 
Lucie when Graig Nettles dove for the ball and didn't get it. Can you imagine 
what a thrill it was for a fellow like myself to hit one past Nettles after 
seeing him catch everything in sight in the World Series a few years ago?" 
</P>
<P>
It was Nettles' spectacular play at third base that helped the New York Yankees 
beat the Dodgers in six games in the 1978 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been in a league game yet but I'm having a ball," Mincberg said. 
"Since I was a kid, I've wanted to play pro baseball, and now here I am, suited 
up alongside fellows like Toby Harrah, Rollie Fingers, Dave Kingman, Al 
Hrabosky and Mickey Rivers. It's like a dream." 
</P>
<P>
Mincberg takes care of his law business by phone when the Tropics are on the 
road and works in his office from 8 to 2 when the team is home before heading 
for the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
Wes Clements was a career minor league catcher who, at 33, thought playing in 
the Senior League might attract him some attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows, some major league scout might be looking for a backup catcher and 
give me a chance," he said. "If not, this is still a thrill. It's my big 
leagues." 
</P>
<P>
Alas, the dream didn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
Clements was hitting .115 with one home run when the Tropics cut him. 
</P>
<P>
Even the former big leaguers look on the Senior League as a fantasy come true. 
</P>
<P>
Harrah, 41, who in 17 years in the majors was named American League All-Star 
shortstop with Texas in 1974 and had a .304 batting average with Cleveland in 
1982, is one of the most productive players. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 16 games he was hitting .417 and in one game went four for six, 
scoring six runs. 
</P>
<P>
"Money is part of it, but mostly it's having fun, having a second opportunity 
to do what I enjoy most, and that's playing baseball," Harrah said. "I haven't 
played since '86, but when I heard about this league, I decided I had to come 
down and give it a shot." 
</P>
<P>
Harrah, who managed two years at Oklahoma City in triple A and coached last 
season with Texas in his three years out as a player, will be back on the 
coaching lines with the Rangers almost as soon as the Senior League season 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
Lacy, unlike Harrah, was out of baseball since his last major league appearance 
with Baltimore two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been playing baseball since I was 7 and I really missed it," Lacy, 41, 
said. "I played 16 years in the majors (including seven with the Dodgers) and 
it's in my blood. Ilove the game. 
</P>
<P>
Lacy, runner-up to Tony Gwynn in the National League batting race only five 
years ago, left Lacy Communications, a telephone answering service in Calabasas 
Park, Calif., for his wife to run while he revives his childhood dream. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest person in uniform is Irvine Truman, 72, a former vaudevillian who 
ran a strip joint in West Palm Beach for 40 years before retiring. He is bat 
boy for the Tropics. He loves to sign autographs, penning after his name on 
each: "World's Oldest Batperson." 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for lack of spectators may be that Florida is saturated with 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
There are the spring training games where the current major leaguers are 
showcased in Grapefruit League games from late February through March, the 
14-team Class A Florida State League from April to September, the advanced 
spring training league games from March to May and the Instructional League 
from mid-September to November where future major league players can been seen 
free. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of fans, mostly retirees living in South Florida, revealed a variety 
of reasons for watching the seniors play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful way to spend an afternoon," said Lonnie Walsh, 81, who came 
here nearly 20 years ago from Buffalo, N.Y. "I saw most of these boys on TV and 
now I get a chance to see them up close in person." 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Cotton, age unavailable but with a weather-wrinkled smile, said: "When I 
was a little girl, all the baseball games were in the daytime. I don't like 
night baseball so I come here and sit in the sun and pretend I'm a little girl 
again, watching my dad and my brothers play." 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Armstrong, 69, a lifetime Sarasota resident, may have had the best 
reason: "It was too hot to play golf today so I decided to come over here and 
sit in the shade and have a few beers with my buddies. It's supposed to be 
cooler tomorrow and if it is we'll be back on the tee." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most remarkable things about the league is the rapidity with which 
it became a reality. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, Jim Morley, 33, a real estate developer from Colorado Springs, 
was lying on a beach in Australia when the idea for senior baseball popped into 
his head. Morley played in the San Francisco Giants' minor league system for a 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
When he returned to the United States, Morley sent letters to 1,200 former 
major league players, asking if they were interested in playing in such a 
league. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got more than 700 affirmative replies, I knew it wouldn't be difficult 
to find 200 to fill the rosters for eight teams," said Morley, who owns the St. 
Petersburg franchise. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in New York in May, formation of the new league was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
The league held its first draft on Aug. 8 in Orlando to choose the primary 15 
players for each team. After that, they had two-day tryout camps for minor 
leaguers, major leaguers not selected and semipro hopefuls, to fill the 
24-player rosters. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of those guys who showed up for a look were real characters," Williams 
said. "We had one guy couldn't have been more than 5-foot-4 and weighed at 
least 200 pounds. Said he wanted to play first base." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't much more out of shape, though, than pitcher J.R. Richard, who was 
one of the Orlando Juice's first picks. When Richard showed up weighing more 
than 300 pounds, he was one of the first cut by Manager Gates Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Before the season opened, each team had two weeks of fall training camp, 
including exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw my team for the first time, I was impressed by the good shape they 
were in," Williams said. "That's important at every level, but maybe more so 
for fellows a little older. 
</P>
<P>
"The nicest thing about managing at this level is that there aren't a lot of 
hassles you get from the prima donnas in the major leagues. The guys here are 
looser, they know what they have to do. The biggest worry I have is making sure 
the beer is iced for the ride home." 
</P>
<P>
The seniors travel by bus across Florida. It's a ride of more than four hours 
from Miami to Orlando or St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
There is no need for agents because no player can receive more than $15,000 a 
month nor less than $2,000 and each team must operate under a $550,000 salary 
cap. Each club owner paid a franchise fee of $850,000, with a guarantee of 
three years' operation. 
</P>
<P>
But the snowbirds better hurry and get here, and they better be baseball fans, 
if the league is going to see its third season.

ASCOT PUTS FORTH THE PRESTIGE

<TEXT>
<P>
The two most prestigious midget auto races in the country are the Turkey Night 
Grand Prix, which is the oldest, and the Belleville Nationals, which is the 
richest. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Gurney, who won the Turkey Night 100-lap race last Thanksgiving at Ascot 
Park and the Belleville race this summer in Kansas, hopes to keep his streak 
going when he wheels his Larry Howard-owned midget to the starting line tonight 
for the 49th Turkey Night event at Ascot. 
</P>
<P>
Gurney, 40, a carpenter from Livermore, Calif., also won the United States Auto 
Club's Silver Crown championship for dirt-track cars this year to go with the 
USAC super modified title he won in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a good year, but winning Ascot again would make it a great year," 
Gurney said. "Any time you win at Ascot, it's great, what with all the 
tradition it's got. You know you'll go down in history if you win there." 
</P>
<P>
Gurney will be in a new chassis built by Dave Ellis, but it will be as similar 
to last year's winning car as possible. Rich Vogler, a five-time USAC midget 
champion from Indianapolis, wrecked last year's car two weeks ago when he 
flipped during a hot lap session in Yuma. Vogler, who lost last year's race on 
the final lap when he drifted wide enough to let Gurney pass, will also be in a 
Howard car tonight as a teammate of Gurney's. 
</P>
<P>
Both cars will be powered by Joe Fontana Arias engines. 
</P>
<P>
Howard has a history of fielding Ascot winners. In addition to Gurney's 
exploits last year, Ron Shuman drove four Howard midgets to victory during his 
amazing stretch of six wins between 1979 and '87. 
</P>
<P>
Shuman, who repeated as California Racing Assn. sprint car champion by winning 
last week's Don Peabody Memorial race at Ascot, will be trying for his seventh 
Turkey Night victory in a Pontiac owned by Indianan Carl Runyon. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 years, the Tempe, Ariz., veteran has led 633 of 1,000 laps in 
Turkey Night races -- more than all the other drivers combined. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Gamester of Peru, Ind., who clinched his first USAC midget championship 
Nov. 11 at Ventura, will be in tonight's race, but the VW power in his midget 
is not likely to be as effective on Ascot's big half-mile oval as it is on the 
smaller tracks where most USAC races are contested. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, in Shuman's first appearance at Ascot in 1977 he was driving for 
George Gamester, Russ' father. He finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Gurney foresees an eight-car race tonight, with Western States favorites Robby 
Flock of Industry and Sleepy Tripp of Costa Mesa in the hunt along with 
himself, Shuman, Vogler, Stan Fox of Janesville, Wis., and former winners Kevin 
Olson of Machesney Park, Ill., and Brent Kaeding of Campbell Calif. 
</P>
<P>
A sentimental entry will be that of Chris Malone, 20, of Indianapolis. Malone's 
father, Shim, was the head starter for Indy car races before he was killed in 
an air crash in 1978 with five other USAC officials. The elder Malone got his 
start at Ascot and the old Gardena Stadium track. 
</P>
<P>
The USAC midget season will end Saturday night with a 40-lap feature at 
Imperial Raceway in El Centro, a three-eighths-mile dirt oval. 
</P>
<P>
SPRINT CARS -- Looking ahead to the not-too-distant day when Ascot Park, with 
its dirt track, closes for good, the California Racing Assn. will hold two 
weekends of racing on the asphalt at Mesa Marin Raceway in Bakersfield. Rich 
Vogler and Indianapolis 500 veterans George Snider and Billy Vukovich III will 
join the CRA regulars for non-winged racing on the half-mile paved oval Sunday

WORLD CUP GETS OFF GROUND ON ARTIFICIAL SNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"The White Circus" opens today in Park City, Utah, where there's just enough 
man-made white stuff to get ski racing's four-month World Cup winter odyssey 
off the otherwise brown ground. 
</P>
<P>
After three weeks of intensive snow-making, the courses are ready for Marc 
Girardelli of Luxembourg and Vreni Schneider of Switzerland to resume defense 
of their championships. The 1989-90 season opened last August in Australia, 
where Ole Christian Furuseth of Norway took the men's lead with 40 points, and 
in Argentina, where Michaela Gerg of West Germany jumped out in front of the 
other women with 31. 
</P>
<P>
Girardelli, hoping to equal Italian Gustavo Thoeni's record of four overall 
titles, is fourth with 23 points, and Pirmin Zurbriggen of Switzerland, also 
going for his fourth, is sixth with 19. Schneider, who won a record 14 World 
Cup races last season, is 19th among the women with three. 
</P>
<P>
Missing from this weekend's competition -- as well as the rest of the schedule 
-- is former World Cup champion Tamara McKinney of the United States, who 
injured her left knee during glacier training at Saas Fe, Switzerland, on Oct. 
18, two days after her 27th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney, who won the combined gold medal in the World Alpine Ski Championships 
last February at Vail, Colo., underwent a five-hour operation at South Lake 
Tahoe late last month, after which Dr. Richard Steadman said: "Although as knee 
injuries go, this is a real serious one, everything went together well, and I'm 
encouraged. We're going to take it one step at a time, but her season has 
definitely ended." 
</P>
<P>
The schedule at Park City, which will be one of the Alpine venues if Salt Lake 
City's bid for the 1998 Winter Olympics is successful, calls for the men's 
giant slalom today, followed by the women's giant slalom Friday, the women's 
slalom Saturday and the men's slalom Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The men will move to Waterville Valley, N.H., for a giant slalom next 
Wednesday, then to Mont Sainte Anne, Quebec, for a slalom and giant slalom Dec. 
2-3, before flying off to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The women will make three other North American stops -- at Vail for a giant 
slalom and super-G Dec. 2-3; at Steamboat, Colo., for a downhill, slalom and 
combined Dec. 9-10, and at Panorama, B.C., for two downhills Dec. 16-17. 
</P>
<P>
Skiing Notes 
</P>
<P>
If you've been planning to ski over the Thanksgiving holidays, forget it. 
Mammoth Mountain has one to two feet of snow with just a few of its lifts 
operating, and two resorts are open near Lake Tahoe -- Boreal and Alpine 
Meadows -- but they're also offering only extremely limited skiing. . . . Utah 
isn't much better off, with Brighton the lone ski area definitely going. . . . 
Colorado lists A-Basin, Aspen Mountain, Beaver Creek, Breckenridge, Copper 
Mountain, Crested Butte, Keystone, Loveland, Steamboat, Telluride, Vail and 
Winter Park as partially operational.

Denny Stolz, former San Diego State football coach, said Wednesday night that 
he was encouraged by a two-day visit to New Mexico State but likely would not 
make a decision about whether to coach the team there before the end of the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Stolz said talks would continue over the next few days to resolve several 
issues, mainly concerning the school's financial commitment to football. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very clear that football is very, very important to the people there," 
Stolz said after returning from a trip to campus in Las Cruces, N.M. "I was 
very impressed." 
</P>
<P>
Stolz said he was told he was the school's first choice and that it is his 
understanding the job is his if he wants it. Stolz has been out of football 
coaching since he was fired at SDSU last November. He was later appointed men's 
golf coach. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State is looking to replace Mike Knoll, who was fired Sunday after 
an 0-11 season. Knoll was 4-40 in four seasons. CURT HOLBREICH

PRESEASON NIT ROUNDUP;

KANSAS KNOCKS OFF NO. 1 UNLV

Unranked Kansas completed a sweep of the two top teams in the nation Wednesday 
night when Mark Randall and Mike Maddox sparked a second-half spurt that 
carried the Jayhawks to a 91-77 victory over No. 1 Nevada Las Vegas in the 
semifinals of the preseason National Invitation Tournament at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas (3-0), which beat second-ranked LSU, 89-83, at Baton Rouge, La., to 
reach the semifinals, faces No. 25 St. John's on Friday night in the NIT final. 
</P>
<P>
Randall scored 10 points and Maddox eight during a 13-minute, 34-16 run by 
Kansas that turned a 49-47 lead into an 83-63 margin with 3:51 left. 
</P>
<P>
Maddox led the Jayhawks with 17 points, Randall had 16, Pekka Markkanen scored 
14 and Rick Calloway added 13. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson Hunt had 21 points, Stacey Augmon 17 and Larry Johnson 13 for UNLV 
(2-1). 
</P>
<P>
UNLV appeared to take control with a 14-2 surge that gave the Rebels a 36-28 
lead with 4:28 left in the first half. Augmon started the run with a 
three-pointer and finished it with a layup. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas, which missed the first shot of three consecutive one-and-one 
opportunities during UNLV's run, responded with its own 14-2 spurt and took a 
42-38 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels trailed, 49-42, early in the second half before a basket and 
three-point play by Hunt made it 49-47 with 16:40 left. 
</P>
<P>
Calloway started Kansas' winning spurt with two free throws and a fast-break 
layup. 
</P>
<P>
St. John's 53, DePaul 52 -- Boo Harvey's 15-foot jumper at the buzzer gave the 
Redmen a victory over the Blue Demons in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
The Redmen (3-0) seemed on the way to defeat in the final seconds as they 
desperately tried to foul while DePaul passed and dribbled the ball at its end. 
Just before he was fouled, DePaul guard Melvon Foster was called for traveling 
with 5.7 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey took the inbounds pass and drove three-quarters of the court for the 
winning jumper.

CRENSHAW SLIPS PAST SAN FERNANDO, 27-24, IN 4-A PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
Maybe 75 years of football teaches a school a few tricks. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando High, celebrating its 75th season, once was accused of using a 
wider-than-regulation field in the days when future Heisman Trophy candidates 
roamed its offensive backfield. 
</P>
<P>
So when the San Fernando field appeared to be a little waterlogged before 
Wednesday night's City Section 4-A Division playoff game against Dorsey, more 
than a few people wondered aloud what was up. 
</P>
<P>
After all, with Crenshaw tailback Kevin Hicks in the game, any edge would help. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks, however, gained a game-high 137 yards in 23 carries and scored the 
decisive touchdown with 1:19 left as Crenshaw defeated San Fernando, 27-24. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were gonna water it down, it would be a . . . swamp right now," San 
Fernando defensive coordinator Troy Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando (5-6) trailed, 15-10, after three quarters, but took a 16-15 lead 
when Johnny Carter broke loose from the wishbone set for a 70-yard score with 
9:58 to play. Carter finished with 134 yards in 10 carries and scored two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw (7-4) answered on its next possession when fullback Sean Lowery scored 
from one yard on a fourth-and-goal play with 3:21 remaining. It was Lowery's 
lone carry of the game and gave Crenshaw a 21-16 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw appeared to have clinched the victory when Hicks, a senior, scored 
from 35 yards with 1:19 left. But the Tigers drove downfield and scored on a 
three-yard run by Carter with 11 seconds remaining. Quarterback Michael Wynn 
sliced in for a two-point conversion to make it 27-24. San Fernando failed to 
recover the onside kick, however. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando took a 10-0 lead in the first half thanks in part to a puzzling 
Crenshaw mistake. On their first possession, the Tigers took a 7-0 lead on 
fullback Vincent Hall's four-yard run up the middle, capping a five-play, 
75-yard drive. Crenshaw's Greg Jones failed to field the ensuing kickoff and 
San Fernando recovered at the Crenshaw 16. A penalty gave San Fernando the ball 
at the seven, and Jamie Ballesteros kicked a field goal for a 10-0 lead.

VAN NUYS FALLS TO LOCKE, 37-6, IN 3-A OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As if the thrill of playing in the first round of the City Section 3-A Division 
playoffs was not enough inspiration for James Fuller, he had additional 
incentive -- impressing a rather conspicuous visitor on the Locke High 
sideline. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado quarterback Darian Hagan showed up Wednesday night at Van Nuys to root 
on his alma mater. The Heisman Trophy candidate was not disappointed as Locke 
crushed Van Nuys, 37-6. 
</P>
<P>
Fuller, a Locke halfback, rushed for 187 yards in 19 carries and scored 
touchdowns of 85, 31 and 11 yards. He also ran in a two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
Fuller started slowly, however, gaining just nine yards in his first five 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
"They were keying on me," Fuller said. "But then they forgot about me and I 
just cut loose." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hagan of Fuller: "I think he's a bona fide player. He can go to a Division 
I school and any school he goes to, he's going to be an impact player." 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys (5-5), which had not made the playoffs since 1983, had a tough time 
making a dent in the Locke defense. Quarterback Roy Vasich completed eight of 
27 passes for 121 yards and threw one interception. Diallo Frazier led the 
Wolves with 72 yards in 14 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys did have its chances, however. Tony Indelicato took a kickoff 90 yards 
for a touchdown to trim Locke's lead to 8-6 early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
With a minute left in the first half, the Wolves had a second down on the Locke 
one-yard line but self-destructed. They were unable to score after being pushed 
back to the 15 by consecutive penalties, however. 
</P>
<P>
Locke quarterback Dewayne Bryant did not complete a pass in the first half but 
did inflict his share of damage. He gained 63 yards in 14 carries, scored a 
two-yard touchdown and intercepted a pass. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of fullback Kimo Dunn, who was clearly pushing him from behind, 
Bryant charged in from the two with 4:18 to play. The score capped a 52-yard 
drive. Steven Martin, the holder on the point-after attempt, grabbed a bad snap 
and ran in for the conversion -- his second of the game -- that gave Locke 
(6-3-2) a 16-6 edge. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after a scoreless first period, Fuller outsprinted the Van Nuys 
secondary for an 85-yard touchdown run. Martin ran in the conversion.

THE BOTTOM TEN: WILL CAROLINAS GET TOGETHER?

The Colleges 
</P>
<P>
The hot topic in college football, of course, was the rumored reunification of 
East Carolina and Western Carolina and whether the NCAA would feel threatened 
by such a merger. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the misplaying field, Bottom Ten flowerhouses LSU (3-7) and UCLA 
(3-7-1) avoided defeats over the weekend to throw the race into turmoil. The 
Ruins actually would have beaten USC, except they neglected to install their 
new breakaway goal posts. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor (4-6), which gave up a bases-loaded home run in the ninth inning to lose 
to Rice (3-6), was temporarily named No. 1 with one week to go. Not far behind 
was Fresno State Coach Jim Sweeney, who called New Mexico "pathetic" after a 
68-21 win last year. New Mexico (2-10) was less pathetic this time, routing 
previously undefeated (10-0) Fresno State, 45-22. 
</P>
<P>
And in an increasingly common statistical category, Arizona suspended its third 
and fourth players of the season for various infractions, and Florida gave the 
heave-ho to its third player as both pulled ahead of Notre Dame (2). They're 
still far behind Oklahoma, which announced four more suspensions Wednesday to 
run its total to nine.

players were on steroids and were "an artificial team." 
</P>
<P>
12. Also blamed 1987 Rose Bowl loss on crowd cheering against Michigan, adding, 
"It would be nice someday if we (Big Ten teams) got as many tickets as they 
(Pac-10) did." 
</P>
<P>
13. Attributed loss to BYU in the 1984 Holiday Bowl to fact that "BYU is the 
worst holding team in the U.S. . . . I think BYU ought to be outlawed. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
14. Also attributed BYU loss to the fact that Michigan players had less time to 
practice because of final exams. 
</P>
<P>
15. Blamed 1977 loss to Duke on ACC officials and called Big Ten officials "a 
bunch of goons." 
</P>
<P>
16. Claimed that Ohio State was chosen over Michigan for the 1974 Rose Bowl 
because Big Ten Commissioner Wayne Duke "engineered the vote." 
</P>
<P>
17. In 1982, claimed the Big Ten wasn't as dominant as it used to be because 
many high school prospects in the Midwest were opting for hockey and soccer. 
</P>
<P>
18. Blamed Michigan's absence from the Top Ten rankings at one point in 1982 on 
the "natural resentment and jealousy toward the Big Ten because it was so 
dominant years ago." 
</P>
<P>
19. Blamed 1982 loss to Ohio State on Buckeye linebackers allegedly mimicking 
Michigan quarterback's signals. 
</P>
<P>
20. Blamed 1979 Rose Bowl loss to USC "on a touchdown where the guy scoring 
(Charles White) didn't have the football at the time." 
</P>
<P>
*Combined records of Miami (Fla.) and Miami (O.).

QUOTEBOOK: BYU quarterback Ty Detmer, who was forced to use a public restroom 
in the fourth quarter because the locker room door was locked: "It was hard to 
go to the bathroom because the fans kept coming up and talking to me." 
</P>
<P>
The Pros 
</P>
<P>
It isn't often that a ballcarrier tries to straight-arm a defender with the 
same arm that he's using to cradle the ball. Pitt's megabucks back, Tim Worley, 
tried that unusual maneuver against San Diego and picked up his sixth lost 
fumble of the season. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Worley, who is averaging barely three yards a carry, is a prime 
contender for the NFL's LVR (Least Valuable Rookie) award. Right behind him is 
Knee-On Deion Sanders, the Atlanta cheap-shot specialist who picked up his 
third personal foul in two weeks to pace a Falcon loss to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
In the team category, Detroit (2-9) upped its league-leading turnover total to 
40 with a colorful variety of miscues, including three lost fumbles, two 
interceptions and one blocked punt that was recovered for a Cincinnati 
touchdown.

CRAVEN LEADS SPIRITED FLYERS PAST CANADIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the big stories in the NHL this season is the play of the Philadelphia 
Flyers, despite injuries to key players and the suspension of standout 
goaltender Ron Hextall. 
</P>
<P>
Hextall, suspended for the first 12 games, has missed all but two others 
because of injuries. Tim Kerr, their top scorer, and Brian Propp, their top 
playmaker, have recently undergone surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers haven't lost their spirit, however. Murray Craven had two goals and 
two assists Wednesday night at Philadelphia as the Flyers defeated the Montreal 
Canadiens, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers welcomed back right wing Scott Mellanby, who played his first game 
after undergoing surgery on his left forearm, which he severely damaged in a 
barroom fight during the off-season. Mellanby had an assist. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers started fast. They outshot the Canadiens, 9-2, in the first period, 
and built a 2-0 lead on goals by Rick Tocchet and Craven. 
</P>
<P>
Backup goaltender Ken Wregget made the lead stand up, although he faced seven 
shots in the first six minutes of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
"Craven has been our most consistent forward all season," Flyer Coach Paul 
Holmgren said. "He sucked it up a lot when we lost Tocchet and (Ron) Sutter. 
Now that they are back, the line is flying." 
</P>
<P>
Montreal Coach Pat Burns was so disturbed by the Canadiens' poor performance, 
he never emerged from the dressing room to answer reporters' questions. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 4, New York 1 -- The Sabres scored three times before the game was 13 
minutes old to remain the only team in the NHL unbeaten at home. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Ruuttu, Pierre Turgeon and Scott Arniel had early goals and Daren 
Puppa made 27 saves to run the Sabres' record to 9-0-1 on their home ice. 
</P>
<P>
Puppa improved his record to 9-2-4. He lost his shutout early in the third 
period when rookie Darren Turcotte scored his 13th goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres (13-5-4) moved into a tie for first place in the Adams Division with 
Montreal, which has played four more games. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 5, New York Islanders 3 -- In the first quarter of the season, the 
Capitals played pretty well but had trouble scoring. 
</P>
<P>
With Mike Ridley and Dino Ciccarelli leading the way at Landover, Md., the 
Capitals ended a four-game winless streak and displayed an offense. 
</P>
<P>
Ridley had two goals, and Ciccarelli, not known as a playmaker, assisted on 
three goals. The Capitals outshot the Islanders, 16-4, in the first period and 
built a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 6, Pittsburgh 3 -- Bruce Driver set up four goals to lead the Devils 
to victory at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The Devils, in ending a four-game winless streak, stopped the Penguins' 
three-game win streak. In the last three games, Driver has a goal and eight 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Lemieux assisted on all three Pittsburgh goals to extend his scoring 
streak to 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec 4, Hartford 2 -- The Whalers know they have a problem on home ice when 
they can't beat the struggling Nordiques. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Jeff Brown broke a 2-2 tie with a 55-foot shot on a power play with 
4:42 left to give the Nordiques just their sixth win in 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Whalers have lost four in a row at Hartford and are 4-8-1 at home this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 6, Toronto 3 -- After going scoreless for the first 21 minutes at 
Bloomington, Minn., the North Stars got offensive. 
</P>
<P>
They scored all six of their goals in the next 26 minutes. Mike Gartner scored 
two and has 14 this season. 
</P>
<P>
The North Stars took 54 shots at Toronto goalie Mark LaForest, who stopped the 
first 27. DAN HAFNER

FAST GOAL BY KARIC, SOCKERS, AWAKENS WINGS, WHO GO ON TO 4-2 VICTORY 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zoran Karic scored two goals for the Sockers Wednesday night, including one 
that could have put the desperate Wichita Wings away. 
</P>
<P>
Karic's brilliant second effort made it 1-0 with only 1:07 elapsed. But the 
Sockers failed to capitalize and gave up a couple of cheap goals. Then Wichita 
forward Andy Chapman lifted the crowd of 6,224 out of their seats when he 
scored the third on a bicycle kick. 
</P>
<P>
And the Wings, who had been outscored, 22-7, in losing three in a row, were off 
and flying to a 4-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
With just over a minute gone, Karic had Wings defender Tom Soehn hanging all 
over him on a run. Soehn blocked the shot, but on a second touch, Karic poked 
it into the net from 25 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Both Wings Coach Terry Nicholl and Sockers Coach Ron Newman said that was the 
turning point. 
</P>
<P>
Newman said he felt the Sockers could have put the game away if they had 
capitalized. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave up a couple of horrendous goals, and it became a psychological warfare 
at that time," Newman said. "If we could have kept on top of them for a half, I 
think they would have been really rattled. 
</P>
<P>
"But they worked ever so hard. Give them every credit in the world. They worked 
much harder than us to get the result. Chico Borja (Wichita midfielder) was 
limping. He's obviously not 100%, but he was back there tackling and 
double-teaming people. It was more like playoff intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't ready at this time of year to battle like that." 
</P>
<P>
"Honesty kept us in there," said Nicholl, who laid the law down to the Wings 
after a 10-4 loss in Cleveland last Saturday. "If we had played like we did in 
Cleveland after that first goal, our heads would have dropped, and they would 
have put two or three in before I even had a chance to regroup." 
</P>
<P>
The victory left Wichita with a 4-4 record. The Sockers are 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth career bicycle goal for Chapman, who had a hat trick in the 
last game and was celebrating his 400th appearance in the Major Indoor Soccer 
League. Only two other players have performed in 400 or more games. 
</P>
<P>
Sockers' goalkeeper Zoltan Toth was coming out for the ball and was totally 
unprepared for the shot, which gave Wichita a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"If he doesn't do that, the ball is in my hands. Trust me," Toth said. "It was 
the only thing that would beat me. I was surprised. It was so accurate." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers kept Wings' goalkeeper Ron Fearon under constant pressure down the 
stretch, but he made several outstanding saves to lift his record to 4-1.

USIU MEN'S PREVIEW;

<P>
WINNING IS NO. 1 ON GULLS' AGENDA

<P>
U.S. International University has its deepest team ever. Its most talented 
team. Its best player. That's the way Gulls' Coach Gary Zarecky sums it up. 
</P>
<P>
But will USIU have its most-successful team? Draw its biggest crowds? It has 
to. 
</P>
<P>
This may be the most important season for USIU basketball since it hired 
Zarecky from Sweetwater High School five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
USIU has made no secret that it is looking to basketball to be a lighthouse for 
the institution, to guide the unknowing to the steps of the admissions office, 
hoping that when someone says USIWho, they say it with the hardness directed 
toward a hated rival and not with sincere puzzlement. 
</P>
<P>
With programs such as women's basketball and hockey gone, and others cut to 
bare-bones level, men's basketball will have to carry the load if Division I 
athletics is to survive at USIU. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we have to win, for several reasons," Zarecky said. "One is because 
I'm tired of losing. We're making progress, but to me it's not good enough. I'm 
not here to build internally. I want to win. I want this program to be 
successful from the respect point of view. We don't even get that in our own 
back yard." 
</P>
<P>
This is the Gulls' best chance to win. USIU is playing 17 of its 28 games at 
home, a reversal of its usual schedule. Five starters return from last year's 
team, the school's most talented. And Zarecky thinks he has brought in one of 
the best players on the West Coast -- Kevin Bradshaw. 
</P>
<P>
After going 8-10 his first year, Zarecky was 11-17 in 1986-87, 10-18 two years 
ago and 11-17 last year. 
</P>
<P>
FORWARDS 
</P>
<P>
Demetrius Laffitte (6-foot-6) was the only player to shoot better than 50% from 
the floor (210-379) last season and led the team in scoring (18.5) and 
rebounding (10.4); he was a preseason independent school All-American according 
to Street &amp; Smith. But Gary Williams will have to rebound from a sub-par 
shooting year to provide some balance. Williams shot just 38% from the field 
last year while averaging 17.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Brown (6-6), a transfer from Yavapai Community College, and Greg Howard, 
who played in 28 games for the Gulls last year, will give USIU some depth. 
</P>
<P>
CENTERS 
</P>
<P>
"The whole key to our season is Mike Sterner," Zarecky said. "To be successful 
at the Division I level depends on what your big man can do." 
</P>
<P>
Sterner (6-11) has started since his freshman year and has 56 games of 
experience as he enters his junior year. Last year he averaged 6.3 points and 
6.3 rebounds and shot 36% from the field (76-212) and a dismal 35% from the 
line (25-72). 
</P>
<P>
Pushing Sterner will be 6-11 freshman Steve McCaughey from Capistrano Valley 
High. 
</P>
<P>
GUARDS 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw (6-6) played two years at Bethune-Cookman, where he averaged 19 points 
and 5.4 rebounds as a sophomore, then joined the Navy for four years. Last 
year, he was on the All-Armed Forces team with David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Smith (6-3) returns for his fourth year at the point. Smith averaged 11.5 
points last year but shot just 35%. Bradshaw will replace senior Paul Wilson, 
who has been suffering from back problems. Wilson averaged 17.8 points per 
game, second highest on the team, last year as a starter.

CHRISTIAN HERITAGE BACK IN LEAD ROLE

<P>
Of the three small college men's basketball teams in San Diego, Christian 
Heritage once again should be strongest, with four three-year starters 
returning for their senior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Foster, the most successful coach in Point Loma Nazarene history, returns 
after a year layoff, and the Crusaders look to be much improved. And UC San 
Diego has no seniors, but that does not mean the Tritons are without 
experience. They have some, but will it be enough? 
</P>
<P>
CHRISTIAN HERITAGE 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Record: 24-9 overall 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Finish: Independent 
</P>
<P>
The high-scoring Hawks have everything one looks for in the preseason: 
experience, depth and size. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the four returning starters scored in double figures last season. Brad 
Soucie (6-6) averaged 25 points. Mark Kraatz (6-2) 16.3 and Will Cunningham 
(6-0) 13.5. The fourth, Rundy Foster (6-0), averaged 9.4. 
</P>
<P>
Kraatz, a two-time All-American, led the National Christian College Athletic 
Assn. in assists with 10.1 a game. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Meter, a 6-6 junior, will start at center. 
</P>
<P>
Averaging 93.5 points, Christian Heritage was ranked No. 1 in the NCCAA for a 
brief period last year and spent most of the time ranked third. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Heritage (2-1) demonstrated a potent offense in defeating Cal State 
Stanislaus, 91-89, and Alma College, 82-74. Against Stanislaus, the Hawks made 
a school-record 13 three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Swen Nater and Ray Slagle, the co-coaches, say this could be the team's best 
year yet despite the toughest schedule in its four years. 
</P>
<P>
POINT LOMA NAZARENE 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Record: 8-21 overall, 5-9 Golden State Athletic Conference 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Finish: Tied for Sixth 
</P>
<P>
After the two worst seasons in school history, the Crusaders look to rebound. 
</P>
<P>
Under Ben Foster, who had compiled a 279-176 record in 14 years before taking 
off last year, PLNC has won three NCCAA championships, six conference titles 
and finished second in the GSAC four times. Foster took last year off hoping to 
go on a sabbatical but ended up in a cast for 10 months with a torn Achilles 
tendon. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel responsible that (the program) slipped in the past couple of years," 
Foster said. "We're going to see if we can't get that turned around." 
</P>
<P>
PLNC (1-1) won its opening game against Dominican, 111-67, then fell to Cal 
State San Bernardino, 87-80. 
</P>
<P>
Senior guards Brian Thurston (6-2) and Ron Hubbard (6-3) are both returning 
starters. Thurston was second in both scoring (16.1 per game) and assists 
(3.1). Hubbard averaged 14.6 points and 4.4 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Flores, a 6-10 sophomore center who sat out last year with a knee injury, 
will give the Crusaders an inside game they lacked. 
</P>
<P>
UC SAN DIEGO 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Record: 9-17 overall 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Finish: Independent 
</P>
<P>
For a Division III school, the Tritons are fairly big, but Coach Tom Marshall, 
in his seventh year, does not have any seniors and returns just one starter 
from a 9-17 team. 
</P>
<P>
That returner is junior forward Gordon McNeill, the team MVP in 1988-89. He led 
UCSD with a 13.4 scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Rick Batt (6-7, forward) averaged 11.4 points and led the team in 
rebounds with 6.9 per game. Another returner, junior Tim Rapp (6-4, guard), was 
scoring 20 points per game before becoming academically ineligible after six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD (1-0) plays host to the Triton Tip-Off tournament Friday and Saturday.

PLAYERS PUT DINNER ON 100 FAMILIES' TABLES

The Chargers made Thanksgiving a happy holiday for 100 needy families in San 
Diego Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Strong safety Martin Bayless came up with the idea, and he and 32 teammates 
distributed turkey and ham dinners at homes designated by police agencies and 
the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
Funds were contributed equally by the Charger players, the team's front office 
and the Big Bear food-store chain. The players chipped in $1,800. Charger owner 
Alex Spanos matched that, as did Big Bear, which provided the food. 
</P>
<P>
After Wednesday's workout, the players loaded the food into their cars and made 
the rounds of selected homes in Logan Heights, San Ysidro, Linda Vista and 
Southeast San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something we used to do when I was with the Buffalo Bills (1984-86)," 
Bayless said. "I asked the guys in a meeting last week if they wanted to go 
along with it, and I got 100% cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives me a great feeling to do something for people who wouldn't otherwise 
have a good Thanksgiving. I've seen some of the environments and conditions 
people have to live in, and I realize how lucky I am to be where I am. 
</P>
<P>
"We paired guys up two to a car and gave them maps. Most of the families knew 
ahead of time that Chargers were stopping by to wish them a happy Thanksgiving, 
but they weren't aware that food was going to be included." 
</P>
<P>
Bayless also took part in a charitable venture Tuesday, accompanying linebacker 
Billy Ray Smith on Smith's fifth annual visit to Neighborhood House. With 
Bayless and Smith were linebacker Gary Plummer and defensive end Leslie O'Neal. 
The players bought lunch for 160 senior citizens there. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Marion Butts will miss Sunday's game against the Colts in 
Indianapolis because of a knee injury suffered in the Pittsburgh Steeler game 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Henning said Butts, the Chargers' No. 2 rusher with 377 yards, would 
be out at least three weeks. Henning said that with only five games remaining, 
Butts might eventually be put on injured reserve but probably not this week. 
</P>
<P>
A stronger immediate candidate for injured reserve is H-back Rod Bernstine, who 
has missed six games because of a knee injury and has shown no indication when 
he might be able to play. If a roster spot were made available, running back 
Victor Floyd could be activated from the developmental squad. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Spencer, who gained a career-high 87 yards against the Steelers and leads 
the team with 432, is scheduled to start Sunday with Darrin Nelson and Dana 
Brinson in reserve. But Spencer has a sore knee and a chest bruise. 
</P>
<P>
Both Butts and Bernstine were listed as questionable on the Chargers' injury 
report. So were nose tackle Joe Phillips (ankle), linebacker Cedric Figaro 
(back), defensive end Lee Williams (knee) and free safety Vencie Glenn (knee), 
all of whom are expected to play. 
</P>
<P>
Plummer (shoulder) and tight end Andy Parker (concussion) were listed as 
probable. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Free safety Vencie Glenn attributed his knee injury to the artificial turf in 
Pittsburgh. Also on the subject of artificial turf, cornerback Gill Byrd said, 
"Every time I play on that stuff, I get all torn up. I don't see how those 
teams can practice on it and play on it day after day. It shortens your 
career." . . . The Colts listed cornerback Eugene Daniel (virus) as doubtful, 
wide receiver James Pruitt (ankle) and cornerback Chris Goode (hamstring) as 
questionable and offensive tackle Kevin Call (calf), cornerback John Baylor 
(ankle) and linebacker Duane Bickett (hamstring and shoulder) as probable.

COUNCIL CONSIDERS PROPOSALS TO CURB PROBLEM OF DEBRIS CLUTTERING STREETS; 
</P>
<P>
LITTER: THE CITY HASN'T CHANGED ITS SWEEPING ROUTE FOR 15 YEARS, BUT PARKING 
RESTRICTIONS MAY BE A SIGN OF THE TIMES.

<P>
It is the white plastic foam cups that Lois Comeau hates the most. She can spot 
them in the gutters of her Atwater Village neighborhood from 50 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
Every other day after work, Comeau drags a garbage bag down Atwater Avenue to 
the corner of Fletcher Drive and fetches the cups, discarded candy wrappers and 
other litter wedged in the leaves and dried grass. On a typical day, she fills 
an entire bag. 
</P>
<P>
"It just drives me crazy," the adult-school teacher said. "I remember when Los 
Angeles was a clean city. I just feel so sad that it is not that way anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Comeau lives on one of the hundreds of streets in the city of Los Angeles that 
are not posted for regular street sweeping, which means that her neighborhood 
is swept about once a month rather than once a week. And because there are no 
signs restricting parking on sweeping days, the cleaning often does little good 
because the gutters -- where 97% of debris piles up -- are blocked by 
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
It has been almost 15 years since the Los Angeles City Council added streets to 
the city's posted sweeping schedule, but complaints from residents such as 
Comeau may change that. Several proposals to add thousands of miles of posted 
residential routes are being mulled over by two council committees, and the 
full council is expected to take them up early next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear about it every time I meet with block clubs or neighborhood groups," 
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores said. "People want their streets cleaned." 
</P>
<P>
But the proposals carry hefty price tags and involve sensitive political 
decisions that the council may be reluctant to make. Should the city provide 
the same level of street sweeping to all neighborhoods? What areas are the 
neediest? Who should pay for the expanded sweeping routes? 
</P>
<P>
One proposal would add a one-time $36 charge to the water and power bills of 
residents who live on streets that would get new postings. In some parts of the 
city, residents have already offered to buy "No Parking" signs for their 
streets to get better service. Some council members say they find such 
alternatives offensive, but others say they may be the way of the future. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, all 13,085 curb miles of paved residential streets in the city get 
swept, but some neighborhoods get more frequent service than others. (Curb 
miles are a measure of the curbs on both sides of a street, meaning a 
one-mile-long street has two curb miles). 
</P>
<P>
About 1,926 curb miles are swept at least once a week at night, because they 
are major or secondary highways in commercial and industrial areas, with which 
the city deals separately from predominantly residential neighborhoods. An 
additional 3,419 curb miles are posted with "No Parking" signs and are swept 
weekly during the day. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 7,740 curb miles -- more than half the residential streets in the 
city -- have no posted parking restrictions and are swept on an irregular 
basis, averaging once every 4 1/2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"What people want more than anything else is a safe city and a clean city," 
said Councilman Joel Wachs, one of several council members interested in 
converting some or all of the 7,740 curb miles to more regular sweeping 
schedules. "The two go hand in hand. There is a relationship between how a city 
looks and what kind of activities go on there -- how safe it is." 
</P>
<P>
Postal worker Patric Quinn said residents in his Canoga Park neighborhood rank 
the need for cleaner streets just behind efforts to eliminate graffiti and 
gang-related crime. 
</P>
<P>
"If a neighborhood looks like a dump, that is the way people are going to feel 
about it," said Quinn, who recently organized neighbors in the Owensmouth area. 
"And if they feel that way, they aren't going to care about anything." 
</P>
<P>
The council stopped adding posted routes in 1975 because the "No Parking" 
signs, equipment and personnel were too expensive. The expanded sweeping 
proposal preferred by the city's Bureau of Street Maintenance would cost more 
than $80 million over five years. The city spends about $13 million a year on 
street cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say the city is relatively healthy in financial terms, but new 
programs still mean trade-offs. Each dollar spent on sweeping streets, for 
example, is a dollar less for police officers or sewer mains. For $80 million, 
the city could pay the salaries of 350 new police officers for five years, 
according to the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
And problems, some very costly, continue to come up. In a recent report, City 
Administrative Officer Keith Comrie warned council members that state gas tax 
revenues -- which are frequently used for street programs, such as paving and 
sweeping -- will be needed for seismic reinforcement of bridges and roadways 
identified since the Bay Area earthquake in October. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important to assess the priority of posting additional street sweeping 
routes with other city programs and financial commitments," Comrie wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who chairs the council's Budget and Finance 
Committee, has put off decisions about the proposals until January because of 
the large sums of money involved. Yaroslavsky said he wants to consider them 
during the council's mid-year budget review, when the council decides about new 
funding requests from throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not opposed to more sweeping, but we are talking about a lot of money," 
Yaroslavsky said. "It is critical that we see it in the broader context of the 
city's budget. If the economy has really cooled off this year, and our revenue 
projections are too optimistic, then all of this may be pie in the sky." 
</P>
<P>
Street maintenance officials say it is an ideal time to consider expanding the 
city's sweeping program. The Bureau of Street Maintenance has put behind it a 
series of problems in 1986 and 1987 involving mechanically flawed equipment and 
a backlog of unswept streets in residential neighborhoods. And, according to 
Assistant Director David A. Reed, the bureau has caught up with some other 
pressing priorities, such as street paving. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it is a damn good time to concentrate on some of the quality-of-life 
aspects of this city," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Reed said the bureau has not pushed for any particular proposal, 
officials have made it clear that they prefer one calling for weekly restricted 
parking routes on all 7,740 curb miles still not posted. Under the proposal, 
about 1,550 curb miles would be added each year for five years, at an eventual 
cost of $80 million -- the most expensive option. 
</P>
<P>
Other proposals being considered by the council range from adding 775 to 3,600 
curb miles of weekly posted sweeping routes. Several of the proposals also 
suggest creating a new category, monthly posted routes, which would keep 
streets on a four-week schedule but would impose new parking restrictions on 
sweeping days. The cheapest proposal would cost about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Our greatest concern is, that, if the council decides to begin posting again, 
that it make some kind of commitment to continue the program," Reed said. "If 
you start the program up again, you are going to raise people's expectations. 
Then all of a sudden if it stops again . . . that would make a lot of people 
very angry." 
</P>
<P>
Early discussions among council members have already touched upon one of the 
most sensitive issues in city government: the equity of city services across 
community borders and council districts. Flores, whose district extends from 
Watts to Wilmington, has suggested that street-sweeping schedules be made more 
uniform citywide. 
</P>
<P>
One proposal by Flores would add 775 curb miles of weekly posted street 
sweeping, as well as 6,965 curb miles of monthly routes. The weekly postings 
would involve erecting about 50,000 "No Parking" signs on residential streets 
identified by the Bureau of Street Maintenance and the City Council as the 
dirtiest in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Flores likes the proposal because it attempts to balance the number of weekly 
posted curb miles among the council's 15 districts by assigning more new miles 
to those districts that have fewer posted curb miles. As an example, 
Yaroslavsky's district, which has three times more posted curb miles than 
Flores' district, would get 14 additional curb miles compared to Flores' 109. 
</P>
<P>
"I want everyone in this city to be equal," Flores said. "What is happening now 
is, people in some parts of the city are getting different kinds and different 
levels of city services than people in other areas. That is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, on the other hand, said the city cannot afford to provide the same 
level of service throughout. He said the council must select the neediest 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be discriminating with our budget dollar," he said. "Not every 
neighborhood gets the same amount of police protection. Not every neighborhood 
is going to get the same amount of street cleaning. It is just the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
The city began establishing posted street sweeping routes in the early 1960s. 
Officials intended to eventually post all residential streets. But when money 
ran out in 1975, there were still large areas without signs. To qualify for 
signs, more than 25% of the curbside parking spaces on a particular block had 
to be occupied at sweeping time -- a formula the Bureau of Street Maintenance 
intends to continue using, if new routes are approved by the council. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the city assigned highest priorities to streets in the central city, 
gradually adding streets in outlying communities as years passed. But politics 
and timing also played a role. 
</P>
<P>
Street maintenance officials typically responded to requests from council 
members, who were sometimes more concerned about pleasing voters than tending 
to the city's dirtiest streets. As a result, some areas of the city developed a 
patchwork of postings. In Atwater Village, for example, streets north of 
Glendale Boulevard are posted for weekly sweeping, but those south of the 
boulevard are not. 
</P>
<P>
Recent complaints about poor street sweeping in some areas of the city are due 
in part to the changing landscape of Los Angeles, city officials said. Some 
streets that did not qualify for restricted parking routes 15 years ago are now 
crowded with parked cars from new apartment buildings and condominiums. 
Sweepers that once were able to hug the curb without posted parking 
restrictions are now confined to the center of the street because of heavy 
curbside parking. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not found a street sweeper yet that will go under a motor vehicle," 
said Reed of the Bureau of Street Maintenance. "If we can't get to the gutters 
and curbs, we can't guarantee anybody a clean street. There are many areas of 
the city that are not going to be as clean as the residents would like them, 
unless there is an expansion of restricted parking." 
</P>
<P>
Frustration about inadequate sweeping has run so high in some Harbor Gateway 
neighborhoods, the narrow city strip connecting Watts to the Los Angeles 
Harbor, that residents have offered to pay for their own "No Parking" signs. 
Tom and Betty Anderson, who live on 149th Street near Rosecrans Park, have 
collected more than 200 signatures of residents willing to chip in for the 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
"All the trash and junk blows down our street from the park," Tom Anderson 
said. "It really needs to be swept more than once a month. And with some 'No 
Parking' signs, we would be able to call in the parking enforcement people and 
get some of the parked cars ticketed. Right now the guy cruises down the middle 
of the street. It is a waste." 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Transportation, which oversees the placement of "No Parking" 
signs and their enforcement, estimated in a recent report that it would cost 
$2.1 million to manufacture, post and maintain for five years the 50,000 signs 
needed to add 775 curb miles of weekly sweeping. The report said it would cost 
each affected "business or dwelling unit" $36 for the signs. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, who represents the Harbor Gateway, said she wouldn't stand in the way 
of constituents wanting to pay for their own signs, but she described such 
arrangements as unfair. She said everyone in the city should pay for the signs, 
or no one should. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we could cut that $36 price tag in half if everyone was paying it," 
Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs said he would also consider charging for the service, but Councilwoman 
Joy Picus, whose San Fernando Valley district would get 142 of the 775 proposed 
curb miles, said a fee for the signs would simply anger residents who are 
already fuming about their dirty streets. 
</P>
<P>
"They would be just outraged by it," Picus said. "I would not support it." 
</P>
<P>
Free or not, some residents don't want anything to do with the signs. A 
neighborhood in San Pedro recently had its signs removed because residents were 
tired of getting parking tickets on sweeping days. They gave up their weekly 
sweeping with the signs. And in some affluent areas, residents say they would 
rather have their gardeners clean the street than clutter the parkways with 
unsightly "No Parking" signs. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, signs are a form of litter themselves," one Hollywood Hills resident 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of what action the council takes, several officials said the effort 
to clean the streets of Los Angeles will take more than stepped-up sweeping 
schedules. Flores says she cleans the street outside her San Pedro home and 
encourages complaining constituents to take a broom to their streets too. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Watson, executive director of Los Angeles Beautiful Inc., said many 
residents need to change bad habits. 
</P>
<P>
"I am here in an area where they have street sweepers all the time," Watson 
said from her downtown office. "But the area is still a mess. The only answer 
is for the people who live and work around here to care about it. We need to 
educate people to be concerned about dropping things in the street or out the 
car window. Then we wouldn't need to spend all this money on cleaning the 
streets." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PROPOSED RESTRICTED PARKING 
</P>
<P>
One proposal before the City Council would add 775 curb miles of posted street 
sweeping routes. Curb miles are a measure of the curbs on both sides of a 
street, meaning a one-mile-long street has two curb miles. The following are 
among the routes identified by the Bureau of Street Maintenance as likely 
candidates: 
</P>
<P>
1. Eagle Rock Boulevard from Verdugo Road to Division Street; Division from 
Eagle Rock to Rome Drive; Rome from Division to Cazador Street; a line 
generally north from Cazador to Verdugo/Eagle Rock. (16 curb miles) 
</P>
<P>
2. Glendale Boulevard from Garden Avenue to the Los Angeles River; east of Los 
Angeles River from Glendale to Fletcher Drive; Garden from Fletcher to 
Glendale. (14 curb miles) 
</P>
<P>
3. Glendale from Casitas Avenue to Garden; Garden from Glendale to Carillon 
Street; Carillon from Garden to Casitas; Casitas from Carillon to Glendale. 
(16curb miles) 
</P>
<P>
4. A line generally north of Shannon Road from Crystal Springs Drive to 
Commonwealth Avenue; Commonwealth from north of Dundee Drive to Los Feliz 
Boulevard; Los Feliz from Commonwealth to Lowry Road; Lowry from Los Feliz to 
Amesbury; Amesbury from Lowry to Carnavon Way; Carnavon from Amesbury to 
Shannon. (14 curb miles) 
</P>
<P>
5. A line generally north of Shannon from Crystal to Carnavon; Carnavon from 
Shannon to Amesbury; Amesbury from Carnavon to Lowry; Lowry from Amesbury to 
Los Feliz; Los Feliz from Lowry to Griffith Park Boulevard; Griffith Park from 
Los Feliz to Hyperion Avenue; Hyperion from Griffith Park to Riverside Drive; 
Riverside from Hyperion to a line generally north of Shannon. (18 curb miles) 
</P>
<P>

LYNWOOD SEEKING WAYS TO CURB EMISSIONS AT RESIN PLANT

<P>
Under pressure from neighbors to shut down a chemical manufacturing plant and 
its incinerator, City Council members Tuesday declared a 45-day moratorium on 
construction of similar facilities in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Council members concluded that they lack the authority to close the 
controversial Cargill operation. But they asked city staff members to look into 
ways that the city can regulate the plant and incinerator at 2800 Lynwood Road. 
</P>
<P>
The plant manufactures resins that are used in plastic and paint products. A 
small incinerator at the site burns hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have been concerned about odors from the plant and the release of 
possibly harmful materials from the incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
"The plant should be (moved), or it should be shut down," resident Everson Hill 
told the council, adding that the odors are making neighbors "miserable." 
</P>
<P>
Council members told residents that officials are seeking methods to control 
such plants. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aware of the citizens' concerns," Councilman E. L. Morris said, "but 
since we can't close or kick Cargill out, we should work with Cargill to 
eliminate the odors for the benefit of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Robert Henning said that even though the city has received no 
proposals for similar plants, the moratorium is designed to provide officials 
time to develop stricter regulations for future plants. There are no provisions 
in the city ordinance regulating hazardous waste plants, but the city staff has 
been asked to prepare possible regulations for discussion at the council's Dec. 
5 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Henning also said the city Fire Department should consider monitoring emissions 
from the Cargill plant. And Councilman Paul Richards asked the city attorney to 
determine whether the state Department of Health Services erred in issuing a 
hazardous-waste permit to the plant without first requiring an environmental 
impact report from the company. 
</P>
<P>
Richards said he believes the health officials should have ordered such a 
report before issuing the permit Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Ella Woods, an organizer of Lynwood Families Against Toxic Waste, said the 
group is pleased by the council's efforts but still prefers that the plant be 
moved. 
</P>
<P>
"We are real happy with the stand they took," she said. "But the only answer it 
to move them out. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to stay on them. We are not going to let them sweep this under the 
rug." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Graff, the general manager of Cargill, described the council action as 
political. 
</P>
<P>
He said the company has been willing to do what it can to clean up the air. 
"Who can be against clean air?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Plant superintendent Michael Dobeck told the council that Cargill had spent 
more than $3 million to reduce emissions and improve the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Dobeck said the incinerator, which has operated at the plant since 1980, has 
actually reduced the odors. 
</P>
<P>
Vapor control vents have also been installed to help reduce odors, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Dobeck said the company had spent at least $400,000 in the last year to perform 
emission tests to see whether the incinerator complies with state and federal 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency last month denied the company a permit to 
operate the incinerator because it failed to meet federal emissions standards 
during a test in October, 1988. But the incinerator passed a recent test and 
may receive a permit as soon as the results are analyzed, according to an EPA 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The company is allowed to continue operating the incinerator while it appeals. 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials have said they do not think that the plant endangers people's 
health. 
</P>
<P>
However, state officials have asked Cargill to submit a plan by Dec. 8 for 
controlling the plant's odors. State officials believe the odors are caused by 
the materials used in the chemical process to create the resins.

After moving to censure Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant for his verbal attacks 
on police officers, Pomona Mayor Donna Smith became the object of a barrage of 
criticism herself at this week's council meeting, with her sometimes political 
ally, Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer, blaming her for the city's turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Nymeyer said Smith's censure motion was "nothing more than one more indication 
of her personal vindictiveness and animosity toward Councilman Bryant and her 
total inability to lead this city and this City Council in any constructive 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
In a nine-page written statement, Nymeyer accused Smith of lying when she said 
the council fired Police Chief Richard M. Tefank on Oct. 17 because he would 
not carry out its instruction to fire seven officers on a hit list. 
</P>
<P>
Nymeyer, who initiated the dismissal of Tefank, said Smith's claim that 
officers have been targeted for termination by the council "was not only 
untrue, it had the effect of yelling 'fire!' in a crowded theater. Mayor Smith 
bears the total political responsibility for the public outrage at the prospect 
of political interference in the day-to-day operation of Pomona's Police 
Department." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who was the only council member to vote against Tefank's dismissal, said 
little in her own defense at the council meeting. But she reiterated afterward 
that council members had a list of officers they wanted fired when they met in 
closed session to discuss the firing of Tefank. "The names were stated in 
closed session," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said in an interview that Nymeyer wanted Tefank to dismiss the 
department's three police captains. In addition, Bryant has said he would like 
to see the dismissal of two other officers. 
</P>
<P>
But other council members insisted that there is no hit list. Councilman Tomas 
Ursua said: "I was outraged at the lies that began to hit the press (after 
Tefank was fired) about the so-called hit list. No such thing exists." 
</P>
<P>
The censure motion against Bryant was prompted by letters sent to council 
members by Assemblyman Charles Bader (R-Pomona) expressing outrage over what he 
described as Bryant's "personal attacks on individual police officers." 
</P>
<P>
Bader referred to Bryant's disclosure at a council meeting Oct. 30 that Raul 
Camargo, president of the Pomona Police Officers Assn., had been seeing a 
psychiatrist at a cost of $20,450 to the city. Bryant labeled Camargo "a 
psychiatric case." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the police officers association also claim that Bryant told them 
that he would like to see Sgt. Gary Elofson "killed, disemboweled and hung." 
Bryant has denied making that statement but he says he would like to see 
Elofson fired because of an incident several years ago when Elofson arrested 
him for drunk driving. The charge was dropped after a blood alcohol test showed 
that Bryant was not drunk, although he was found guilty of running a stop sign 
and speeding. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant also disclosed at a council meeting that Camargo and an unnamed 
sergeant, later identified as Elofson, had been accused of sexual harassment 
and lewd contact by a woman who had been fired as a police crime analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Bader, a former Pomona mayor, asked the council to publicly censure Bryant, 
saying that "silence on this matter would amount to your support and 
endorsement of his attacks." 
</P>
<P>
Nymeyer, who is running for the Republican nomination to succeed Bader in the 
Assembly, accused Bader and his staff of proposing censure for political 
reasons. Bader, who is giving up his Assembly seat to run for the state Senate, 
has endorsed his aide, Jim Brulte, as his successor. 
</P>
<P>
In his written statement, Nymeyer said Brulte was trying to capitalize on the 
police issue for political gain. "The stench of rotten politics on the part of 
Bader's staff is very strong, and I am amazed that Chuck Bader allows himself 
to be sucked into this debate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bader rejected Nymeyer's assertion that he had called for Bryant's censure as a 
political move. He said he was simply outraged that Bryant had disclosed 
confidential medical information about a police officer and sought to defend 
the department against attack. He said "Pomona is a tough town to police" and 
officers deserve support, not criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant denied that he disclosed anything that wasn't in public records or 
common knowledge in the Police Department. "I didn't violate anyone's 
confidential file. I didn't look in anyone's personnel folder. . . . The object 
was simply (to give the) public information about what was happening in your 
city with your money." 
</P>
<P>
After a closed session that ended at about 2 a.m. Tuesday, the council voted 3 
to 1, with Smith dissenting and Bryant abstaining, to provide an attorney and 
pay any costs incurred by Bryant in the lawsuit that has been filed against the 
city and Bryant in federal court by Elofson and Camargo. 
</P>
<P>
The two officers allege that their civil rights were violated by Bryant's 
disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said she voted against the city's providing an attorney or paying any 
judgment against Bryant "because he needs to be responsible for his own 
actions." 
</P>
<P>
The city will pay for an attorney to represent itself and for one to represent 
Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
Smith charged that Nymeyer concentrated his criticism on her because she had 
endorsed Brulte over him for the Assembly. Although she and Nymeyer have voted 
together on a number of major issues, including opposition to the firing in May 
of A. J. Wilson as city administrator, they have been at odds on other matters. 
</P>
<P>
Nymeyer not only criticized Smith but also Bryant, Elofson, Camargo and other 
council members for making statements that he called unprofessional. 
</P>
<P>
Agreeing, Councilwoman Nell Soto said: "Many of us have acted unprofessionally 
in the things we have said. But I think it comes from the frustration of having 
to listen to some of the distortions and prevarications that have been made on 
the part of the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the audience in the crowded council chamber vocally supported Bryant 
and criticized the censure motion as an outgrowth of the recall campaign under 
way against Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
One resident, Debra Hernandez, said Bryant has taken the lead in exposing the 
problems that face Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
"What I would like someone to tell us," she said, "is who let the city get this 
way in the first place? Who let the drugs and the gang activity get so 
disproportionate to our sister communities? We would appreciate somebody 
telling us who those people are so that we might publicly censure them instead 
of those who are trying to clean up this mess." 
</P>
<P>
But another resident, James Oberhofer, said Bryant should be censured for 
making comments that exposed the city to a lawsuit. He added that what Bryant 
has done is typical of the entire council. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody could be censured," he said. "Just sitting back here and listening 
to it, it's the greatest show in town. . . . What a farce."

LITTLEST SCHOOL FACES BIG PROBLEM; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: COUNTY'S ONLY ONE-ROOM SCHOOLHOUSE GRAPPLES WITH OVERCROWDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SANTA CATALINA ISLAND 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barely two years after opening at a remote island location, the county's only 
single-room schoolhouse is facing the same dilemma as many urban counterparts 
across the water -- overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
The red modular structure, complete with a tower and brass bell, was built for 
kindergarten through sixth-grade pupils at Two Harbors, a community of about 
200 residents on the rural western end of the island. Long Beach yachtsman 
Cliff Tucker, whose company constructed and donated the building, wanted to 
eliminate the daily hourlong bus ride to Avalon schools. 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, the area's four sixth-graders were sent to Avalon because 
of the growing enrollment, said Jon Meyer, principal of the Avalon and Two 
Harbors schools. 
</P>
<P>
And the nine fourth- and fifth-graders most likely will have to attend school 
in Avalon next year if the current growth continues, he added. 
</P>
<P>
By 1992, he said, all but those in kindergarten through second grade will be 
bused away. After sixth grade, Meyer said, all Two Harbors students attend 
Avalon through high school. 
</P>
<P>
The current enrollment at Two Harbors is 17, which "just about fits the ability 
of the facility as it exists now," parent Randy Bombard told members of the 
Long Beach Unified School District's Board of Education during a special 
meeting Monday in Two Harbors. The Long Beach district has jurisdiction over 
the island schools. 
</P>
<P>
Although the problem has so far been solved by sending older children to school 
in Avalon, Bombard said, "the preference of the parents," he said, "is to keep 
(the children) here as long as they can." He is vice president of the board of 
a private foundation that splits the school's operating costs with the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year there seem to be new families," Bombard said. While the number of 
residents has not increased significantly, he said, a higher percentage of them 
-- about 20% more in the last two years -- have school-age children. Bombard 
attributes the increase to the presence of the one-room school which, he 
believes, has encouraged an influx of younger families to replace older 
residents who move away. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the potential for future growth, he said, is the possibility that USC 
may expand a marine research facility that it operates at the isthmus. 
</P>
<P>
After listening to comments of Bombard and others, board members visited the 
one-room schoolhouse to talk with students and their teacher, Aileen Earl-Wood. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the visitors boarded a cramped school bus for the dusty trip to Avalon, 
where they had lunch with members of the local City Council and then reconvened 
at Avalon School to field questions from parents concerned about the length of 
time it will take to replace a school gymnasium that had been torn down because 
of unhealthy asbestos levels. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the one-room schoolhouse, students prepared for their annual 
Thanksgiving "friendship" feast scheduled the next day. While third-graders at 
one end of the room mixed peas, broccoli and cabbage in a huge pot, 
kindergartners across the room cut out pilgrim hats and a first-grader strung 
necklaces with macaroni and string. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of it all stood their teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"We have about as many children as we need in here," Earl-Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
The board took no action on the Two Harbors issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to look at the resources available," board President Jenny Oropeza 
said in an interview later. "Given the fact that we don't have the resources 
(for expansion) and the community's willingness to bus their students, we're 
meeting the need."

GROUP FIGHTS DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Azusa First, a group of residents opposed to the construction of 67 multifamily 
units on land next to Azusa Greens Country Club, has begun a petition drive 
that could force the City Council to repeal decisions allowing the project or 
put the issue on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
At its Nov. 6 meeting, the council voted to change the zoning on the 8.4-acre 
parcel from water conservation to multifamily residential. It also adopted a 
resolution to amend the General Plan and approved the design and tentative 
tract map proposed by D &amp; D development and developer Johnny Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The group is circulating two petitions, one against the zone change and one 
against the General Plan amendment. If it is successful in gathering the 
signatures of 1,413 registered voters by Dec. 6, the council could either 
repeal the decisions or submit them to voters in the April election. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Sutton, the group's attorney, said the zone change goes against an 
April, 1988, initiative in which residents voted to keep the golf course and 
surrounding lots as recreational areas until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, however, a court ruled that the 8.4-acre parcel was exempt from 
the moratorium imposed by the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton also said the density of the development is excessive and challenged the 
environmental impact report.

PRICE CLUB TO GET CITY LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pomona Redevelopment Agency, which paid $518,000 for a half-acre lot at the 
northwest corner of Garey Avenue and Philadelphia Street, will resell it to the 
owners of the nearby Price Club for $66,648 under an agreement made four years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement approved this week by the City Council, acting as the 
Redevelopment Agency, carries out a commitment made in 1985 when the Price Co. 
agreed to open an outlet in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The company will use the lot and adjoining property to develop a commercial 
center, Price Club Plaza, with at least 35,000 square feet of space. The 
agreement calls for the plaza to be completed in 22 months. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said that, although the property is being sold at a discount, 
the city expects to profit from sales and property taxes and business license 
fees for the new stores and from increases in taxable sales at the existing 
Price Club.

RECREATION FUNDS INCREASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pomona City Council has allocated $60,241 to step up recreation programs 
and begin other projects to keep youngsters away from gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended by Councilwoman Nell Soto and the Community Action for Peace 
Committee, the program will double to 16 the number of sites offering 
after-school recreation programs. The new sites are Decker, Harrison, Kellogg, 
Kingsley, Lincoln, Madison, Mendoza and Montvue elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
The city will use $8,520 to partially subsidize fees for participants in 
basketball, cheerleading, track and field, and other sports, and $7,537 to pay 
for trips to attractions such as Disneyland and the California Museum of 
Science and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
About $10,000 will be spent to begin a project to plant trees in the names of 
youngsters who pledge not to take drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the program unanimously, although Councilman Mark A. T. 
Nymeyer questioned the value of paying for trips to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of sending children to an amusement park with their peers, he said, the 
city should encourage them to take part in activities with their parents. "The 
more (such excursions) we have to help the disadvantaged," he said, "the more 
we drive families apart. . . . You can go to Disneyland until you are blue in 
the face, but you still have to come home."

BOTH SIDES STILL FAR APART IN RIO HONDO PAY DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rio Hondo College teachers union and administrators made little progress 
during contract negotiations last week and will meet again Nov. 30 to try to 
iron out their differences, representatives from both sides said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still far, far apart," said Tim Wood, the college's vice president for 
administrative affairs. "I am not optimistic it (the dispute) is going to end 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
If the two sides cannot come to an agreement next Thursday, they will have to 
wait until next year to meet again because the state-appointed mediator will 
not be available in December, Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
Owen Newcomer, president of the faculty association, said the teachers' morale 
is plummeting, although they are not planning to go on strike, at least for 
now. 
</P>
<P>
The disagreements center mostly on salary increases for the faculty. The 
teachers, whose contract expired June 30, are requesting an immediate 12% 
raise, a 10% raise next year, and an 8% raise for 1991-92. College 
administrators are offering an immediate 7.5% raise, a 5.5% raise for next 
year, and a 5% raise for 1991-92.

CHAMBER MANAGER REHIRED YEAR AFTER CONCERT FAILURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former administrator of the Lakewood Chamber of Commerce, who quit one year 
ago after the failure of a major concert that left the chamber reeling with 
debt, has been rehired to the post. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ryan, 35, who returned to the chamber two months ago to sell 
advertising for its monthly newspaper, was reappointed as administrator Nov. 1 
when his successor, Gerald Enis, resigned Oct. 31, Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am elated to be back," Ryan said. "The best thing I can do for the chamber 
is come back stronger and smarter and more dedicated than I was before." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan had been working as administrator for five years when he arranged a 
two-day rock festival featuring country and rock 'n' roll greats. The plan, 
Ryan said, was to use concert profits to build a new office building for the 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"The concert was a first-class operation right down to the grass being sprayed 
for ants," Ryan said. But despite the planning the festival flopped. Ryan quit 
his job within a week, a decision he now calls "stupid." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get over it until I started here Nov. 1," Ryan said. "What hurt me 
when I left was not that the concert turned sour but that I left when I was 
needed the most." 
</P>
<P>
Chamber President Lynda Carter said Ryan was rehired because he had done the 
job before and despite the failure of the concert, he did well. She refused to 
discuss how much debt the chamber was left with after the music festival, 
saying only that the chamber has yet to repay it.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;

<P>
AIRPORT NOISE LIMITATION LAW POSTPONED TO JANUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Long Beach City Council has postponed until Jan. 2 further consideration of 
a controversial ordinance that seeks to limit airport noise to the satisfaction 
of residents, airlines and a Los Angeles federal court judge. 
</P>
<P>
The city had been ordered to deliver a new ordinance to U.S. District Judge 
Laughlin E. Waters by Nov. 13. Waters has declared the old ordinance, which 
limited daily flights to 40, unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
The council gave tentative approval to a proposed ordinance last month, which 
has since attracted a stack of mail three inches high, said Lee Blackman, 
attorney for the city. Airlines say the proposed law is too restrictive while 
residents complain it is too lenient. 
</P>
<P>
The court date has been postponed to mid-January, although a firm date was not 
immediately set. The council is continuing to field comments about the proposed 
law, which would limit cumulative yearly noise to 65 decibels, but not the 
number of daily flights. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a verdict is awaited in a separate case in which several Long Beach 
residents sued the city for allowing too much airport noise and contributing to 
a decline in property values. Testimony recently concluded in a three-day trial 
and Waters is considering the matter, said John Schimmenti, an attorney for the 
homeowners.

CALTECH DESIGN CONTEST SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fourth annual Caltech Engineering Design Contest will take place next 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Erik Antonsson's mechanical engineering class will compete in a 
double-elimination tournament in which students are given "a bag of junk" to be 
used as raw materials in the contest. 
</P>
<P>
About 24 students, mostly juniors, receive identical sets of materials to build 
machines. They must fashion assorted pieces of plexiglass, aluminum, tubing, 
springs, rubber bands, paper clips, two small electric motors and other 
materials into a Ping-Pong ball-collecting machine. They can use only the 
materials supplied to build their machines. 
</P>
<P>
In the contest -- which ends the two-month-long design and construction process 
-- two machines face off on a table with an irregular surface and a trough of 
Ping-Pong balls in the center. Students and machines then vie to collect as 
many Ping-Pong balls from the trough in a 30-second period. 
</P>
<P>
Students have been working on their projects since the beginning of class Oct. 
1. Eighty percent of the students' class grade depends on the design and 
performance of their machines in the contest. 
</P>
<P>
About half of their grade on the project is based on performance in the 
contest. The other half is based on imagination and the demonstration of 
engineering principles.

NONPROFIT1 PANEL CREATED TO RENOVATE LANTERMAN HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE BAILIE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The renovation and operation of the city-owned Lanterman estate was placed into 
private hands this week when the La Canada Flintridge City Council endorsed the 
creation of a nonprofit corporation to oversee the estate. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1 to reactivate the Lanterman Advisory Committee to 
create a nonprofit corporation in accordance with a city staff suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
The Lanterman property consists of a 1915 Craftsman-style house with an organ 
recital hall built in 1965 and a 1.35-acre plot on Encinas Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman Sue Schecter will appoint 15 trustees and one full-time 
director for the estate. Schecter said she hopes the majority of the museum 
staff will be community volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
The board of trustees and the director are expected to supervise much of the 
renovation and operation of the estate. The city will administer a $500,000 
grant for the Lanterman property from the state Office of Historic 
Preservation. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Burrows, the estate's longtime caretaker, should be able to retain his 
position, Schecter said. Burrows said he will abide by the municipal and 
committee decisions regarding the property's use. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will soon file for nonprofit corporation status with the Internal 
Revenue Service. Mryl R. Scott, a La Canada Flintridge resident, has donated 
the services of his law firm to help set up the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Once the foundation is incorporated and has formulated its fund-raising plan, 
it will report to the city. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager George Caswell said, "We are now waiting for the foundation to 
come up to us and say what they'd like to do." 
</P>
<P>
Schecter said she hopes to have a proposal ready within three months. 
</P>
<P>
Caswell predicted that the city would have to contribute to the Lanterman 
foundation coffers for one to two years before the operation would become 
self-sustaining. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ed Phelps cast the only dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
Phelps cautioned that the city may have to devote significant sums of money to 
the project, beyond the state grant and related fund-raising resources of the 
Lanterman Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the city may not be able to appropriate the funds to complete the 
renovation and administration of the property if there are cost overruns in the 
as yet undetermined operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Chris Valente qualified his support of the nonprofit corporation. 
"I'm all for it, so long as it's self-supporting. . . . I don't want taxpayers' 
money devoted to this." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman O. Warren Hilgren said, "The city has some responsibility in this 
issue, but we have to look at how big the expenses are and what are options. I 
don't want to write a blank check." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joan Feehan was more supportive of municipal funding for the 
project. "You can't start a foundation from zero. They'll need assistance," he 
said. "The house was a gift, the state grant was a gift. It's up to us to see 
that the property is put to good use." La Canada Flintridge pays $7,000 a year 
in insurance and utility costs on the property. 
</P>
<P>
The Lanterman Advisory Committee must now evaluate funding sources to cover 
renovation and operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates for the annual operating budget range from $50,000 to $100,000. 
Schecter said the highest costs to operate the estate would be personnel, 
projected at $41,500 annually. 
</P>
<P>
On-site fund raising for the project would be limited by the terms of the 
property's conditional use permit. The permit restricts the occupancy and hours 
of operation for the Lanterman estate, thereby prohibiting any large-scale 
events from occurring on the property itself. 
</P>
<P>
Public access is limited to 100 people at one time and hours of operation are 
restricted to Tuesdays and Thursdays between 1 and 4 p.m. and the first and 
third Sunday of every month between 5 and 7 p.m. Parking on the estate is 
limited to 15 cars. In addition, the property will be closed on every major 
holiday and during August. 
</P>
<P>
The renovation was delayed about one year when 11 residents filed a lawsuit 
against the city. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the city 
late last month.

The San Gabriel High School Grad Nite Planning Committee is urging parents to 
become involved with the senior all-night party this year. 
</P>
<P>
Parents sponsor fund-raisers, solicit donations and services and chaperon the 
event, Chairwoman Rita De La Rosa said. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors have three choices of activities this year: Disneyland, a cruise in 
Long Beach Harbor and a "Dial 'M' Murder Mystery," a game in which a series of 
murder mysteries are solved by participants. Voting will take place Monday, De 
La Rosa said. 
</P>
<P>
For the last three years, seniors have gone to Disneyland for their Grad Nite 
party, but attendence has declined, De La Rosa said. 
</P>
<P>
Because students will be choosing their activity this year, De La Rosa said she 
hopes more will attend. 
</P>
<P>
"The more in attendance, the (fewer who) will be out in the streets being 
exposed to alcohol," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members are concentrating on reducing the costs for the seniors by 
sponsoring car washes and raffles as fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
The next committee meeting will be Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. at Marie Callender's, 
518 W. Las Tunas Drive, San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
Interested parents can call (818) 308-2356 or (818) 284-8509 for information.

SCHOOL NEWS: STUDENTS RESTOCK HURRICANE-RAVAGED LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Angel D. Ayala 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Hurricane Hugo ripped the roof off the library at Mt. Pleasant Academy, a 
public elementary school in Mt. Pleasant, S.C., the building was destroyed. 
Perhaps more devastating, the books inside had to be thrown out because of 
water damage. 
</P>
<P>
To help restock the library, students at Vine Elementary School in West Covina 
are sending Mt. Pleasant Academy about 500 books. 
</P>
<P>
Students at Vine School were asked to give books they had at home to students 
at the academy. Many of them wrote notes in the books in an effort to start a 
pen-pal program. 
</P>
<P>
Third-graders Brian and Eric Goldstein wrote a note saying, "I'm sorry your 
school got ruined," and sent it with a few of their books. 
</P>
<P>
Brian and Eric's mother, Nancy Goldstein, a PTA member who began the aid effort 
after seeing reports of Hugo's destruction, said other children have sent 
similar notes along with their pictures and addresses. 
</P>
<P>
Vine School Principal Gary Lawson said writing the notes will teach the 
students about other regions. He hopes it will lead to an extended 
letter-writing program that will increase the students' appreciation of writing 
and correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
Students in the upper grades at Vine School are writing and illustrating books 
to send to their new sister school after the beginning of the year. The books 
are being written by and or on computers. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-grader Brian Galleano wrote and illustrated a math book with story 
problems. He said he likes helping Mt. Pleasant Academy because he would feel 
bad if his school's library were wrecked. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein and Lawson decided to adopt a school in the area hit by the hurricane 
to get as much aid as possible directly to its victims. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Pleasant Academy was chosen because it was one of the hardest-hit schools 
in the area but was not offered as much aid as others that were flooded, said 
Ann Birdseye of the Charleston County School District. 
</P>
<P>
When Goldstein contacted Mt. Pleasant Academy, Principal Jane Smith said the 
school needed books. 
</P>
<P>
In the last month, books worth about $2,000 have been been donated by students, 
parents and others. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses and local service groups have have been asked to donate money for 
new books. Mrs. Nelson's Toy and Book Shop in Covina has agreed to sell books 
for the effort at discount prices. Publishing houses also have been approached 
for donations. 
</P>
<P>
The first shipment of books is scheduled to leave Monday. Because of the 
positive response, more books may be shipped throughout the year as they come 
in, Lawson said. The first 500-pound shipment will be shipped free by an 
airline that wished to remain anonymous, Goldstein said. Subsequent shipments 
may be more difficult because of the cost. Angel D. Ayala

ARMENIAN COMMUNITY SAYS THANKS TO RED CROSS WITH DOLLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brought together by an earthquake, an unprecedented gathering of seven diverse 
Armenian organizations has raised $50,000 for the local Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-month fund-raising effort by the Glendale Armenian community, which 
culminated last Friday in a $75-a-plate banquet, raised the money for the 
Glendale-Crescenta Valley chapter of the relief organization. 
</P>
<P>
And for the first time, it brought together hundreds of Armenians, most members 
of groups with diverse and independent agendas. 
</P>
<P>
"To be able to rally these organizations around any single cause at this point 
was extremely difficult," said Hamo Rostamian, a Glendale commercial 
development consultant and primary organizer of the fund-raising effort. 
</P>
<P>
Other pressing issues -- Armenia's rocky relations with neighboring Soviet 
Azerbaijan, the country's changing political climate and the continuous 
immigration of newcomers from the Middle East -- have demanded the attention of 
local Armenian organizations, Rostamian said. "The Armenian community at this 
point is going through a very crucial time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake, of magnitude 6.9, devastated Soviet Armenia in December, 1988. 
Soon after the quake, two archbishops of the Armenian Apostolic Church, who 
represented rival prelates that had been divided politically, met in a 
Hollywood parish hall to coordinate relief efforts in Los Angeles' Armenian 
community. 
</P>
<P>
The feat in Glendale, likewise, was nothing to scoff at, organizers said. The 
campaign to reward the Red Cross' efforts to aid the quake victims linked seven 
of the community's diverse political, religious, educational, social and 
charity groups: the Armenian General Benevolent Union; the Armenian Relief 
Society; The Armenian Educational Foundation; St. Mary's Armenian Apostolic 
Church; the Armenian General Athletic Union; the Armenian National Committee, 
and the California Courier, a Glendale-based, English-language Armenian 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually each group does things on their own. This is the first time all the 
organizations are joining hands and working together," said Harut Sassounian, 
publisher of the California Courier. "The Red Cross was very, very helpful to 
Armenia. We wanted our own Red Cross to be well-prepared in such an 
eventuality." 
</P>
<P>
The $50,000-donation bolstered a campaign by the Red Cross to raise $1 million, 
much of which will fund a new headquarters and emergency operations center in 
downtown Glendale's old fire station No. 32. The 71-year-old chapter has 
garnered about $650,000 so far for the renovation project, expected to be 
completed next summer, said Bill Dutton, executive director of the local 
chapter. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the donation will help purchase a $100,000 mobile disaster unit 
-- a van capable of providing food, supplies, communication equipment and room 
to work at minor or major emergencies. The chapter now has no such vehicle, 
Dutton said. 
</P>
<P>
About $15,000 was raised at last Friday's banquet, a black-tie affair that 
brought almost 350 people to Castaways restaurant in Burbank. That collection 
was buttressed by $5,000 contributions from each of seven prominent Glendale 
Armenians: Ed Khachatourian, Dave Tatevossian, Norick Toomanian, Harout 
Yepremian, Varto Mazmanian, Mimo Baroian and Hamo Rostamian. 
</P>
<P>
The other $50,000 needed to purchase the mobile disaster unit was contributed 
by a local bank, which asked to remain anonymous, Red Cross officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Helping the relief organization was an appropriate single agenda, fund-raiser 
organizers said. The American and International Red Cross provided almost $6.5 
million in cash, about $8 million in products and services and 227 planeloads 
of supplies to the ravaged area, the relief organization said. 
</P>
<P>
For Hagop Dermegerdichian, a Glendale doctor and vice chairman of St. Mary's 
Armenian Apostolic Church, the fund-raiser was a direct expression of 
gratitude. Dermegerdichian and others used a local phone line set up by the Red 
Cross after the quake to learn whether their relatives in Armenia had been 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
For other Glendale groups, it was the second "shnorhagalem" -- thank you -- in 
less than a year. Just weeks after the earthquake, the Armenian Relief Society, 
along with other Armenian organizations, sponsored a blood drive at St. Mary's 
in Glendale that netted 250 pints for the local Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
A second drive is scheduled for Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
"We just want to say thanks in different ways," Dermegerdichian said. "It's an 
Armenian tradition."

NOTEBOOK / GARY KLEIN: FLINTRIDGE PREP ONE WIN FROM TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Flintridge Prep football team thought it was getting exactly what it wanted 
when the Rebels defeated Templeton, 53-7, last Friday to advance to Saturday's 
Southern Section Large Schools Division eight-man championship game. 
</P>
<P>
However Flintridge Prep wasn't expecting a date with Pasadena Poly, which 
advanced to the title game with a 15-12 upset of Rio Hondo Prep. 
</P>
<P>
"The team that we're going to be seeing Saturday is not the same team we saw 
earlier in the year," said Flintridge Prep Coach Glen Beattie, who is in his 
fourth season with the Rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Flintridge Prep, which defeated Poly, 27-6, earlier this season, knows the 
power of the revenge factor. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this season, Faith Baptist whipped Flintridge Prep, 23-6, then fell to 
the Rebels, 23-14, in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday will mark Flintridge Prep's second appearance in the championship 
game. The Rebels lost to Rio Hondo Prep, 39-8, in the 1973 final. 
</P>
<P>
The game will be played at Flintridge Prep at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Off and running: Oscar Perez of Pater Noster won the boys' Southern Section 1-A 
Division cross-country title last weekend to qualify for the state 
championships Saturday at Woodward Park in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, a senior, covered the three-mile course at Mt. San Antonio College in 16 
minutes, one second, to hold off St. Anthony juniors Geoff Janquart (16:06) and 
Andre Faubert (16:07). Pater Noster, which finished with 214 points in the 1-A 
final, advanced to the state meet as a team for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Eliazar Herrera of Hoover fell just short in his attempt to become the 
school's first Southern Section individual champion since Phil Anderson in 
1962, but still qualified for the state meet with a third-place finish in the 
4-A race at Mt. SAC. Herrera, a senior, clocked 15:15 and finished behind 
Canyon's Dave Hartman (15:12) and Camarillo's Abe Valdez (15:13). 
</P>
<P>
Fast finish: James Moore of Glendale College finished 21st in the state 
community college cross-country finals last weekend in Fresno. Moore, a 
freshman from Verdugo Hills, covered the four-mile course in 20 minutes, 22 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's Nicole Jiminez, a freshman from Burbank who was the Western State 
Conference champion, placed 26th in the women's race, running the 5,000-meter 
course in 19:08. 
</P>
<P>
Cold shot: After successfully weathering 90-degree heat in Santa Cruz two weeks 
ago in the NCAA Division III West regional, Laurie Schuster of Occidental got a 
cold welcome at the national championships last weekend at Rock Island, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Schuster, a junior, encountered 24-degree temperatures and finished 71st, 
covering the 5,000-meter course in 18:53. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Jose Garcia finished 132nd in the men's race, clocking 26:13 over the 
five-mile course. 
</P>
<P>
Over and out: With a loss to Santa Barbara in the first round of the Southern 
Section playoffs, the Crescenta Valley football team finished 6-5, the school's 
best record in 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons, 6-1 at one point and ranked seventh in Division II, closed the 
season with four losses -- three coming against teams ranked among the top four 
in the division. 
</P>
<P>
"We rode a pretty nice train there for awhile at 6-1, which was way above and 
beyond what we expected to do," Coach Jim Beckenhauer said. "We were just 
outmanned in those last games." 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons were overmatched by third-seeded Santa Barbara last Friday in a 
playoff game at Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Crescenta Valley actually led, 7-0, after 3:20 when Falcon defensive back Colby 
Bogust plucked a bobbled pitch by Santa Barbara quarterback Pancho Renteria and 
ran 54 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
But the Dons, who scored 61 points against Oxnard in their regular-season 
finale, came back to score 44 unanswered points, assuming the lead seven 
seconds into the second half on an 11-yard touchdown pass from Renteria to 
Garrett Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"They were bigger, stronger and faster," Beckenhauer said. "That's a bad 
combination to go against. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada's season also ended last Friday when the Spartans lost, 20-3, to 
Arroyo Grande in a first-round playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans' only points came on a 29-yard field goal by Ross Allan with 8:32 
left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Playoff time: Franklin and Marshall opened play in the City Section football 
playoffs Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin (9-1) met Huntington Park at Wilson High. Marshall (5-5) played Venice 
(10-0) at Venice. 
</P>
<P>
Results were not available at press time. 
</P>
<P>
Honor roll: Occidental linebacker David Hodges, a senior who helped lead the 
Tigers to the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference 
championship, was named SCIAC Defensive Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges (6-foot-3, 210 pounds) was one of six Occidental players selected to the 
all-conference first team. Hodges had 55 tackles, three sacks and an 
interception for the Tigers, who finished 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman running back Gary Little and senior linemen Roger Laubengayer and Pete 
Tucker were among 13 players selected to the first-team offense. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges, junior defensive lineman Brady Dargan and junior linebacker Larry 
Schatz were named to the first-team defense. 
</P>
<P>
Senior quarterback Tony Werbelow, junior wide receiver Rob Leinbach and senior 
lineman Sean O'Brien were selected to the second-team offense. 
</P>
<P>
Senior lineman Tony Ferguson, sophomore defensive back Mike Bonetto and 
freshman defensive back Rick Mock were picked to the second-team defense.

<P>
FOOTBALL: TRADITIONALLY STRONG GLENDALE COLLEGE BATTLED INCONSISTENCY TO FINISH 
5-4-1 IN ITS FIRST SEASON UNDER ROOKIE COACH JOHN CICUTO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Sean Hampton neither flinched, delayed, nor thought twice. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale College football team had just defeated Ventura, 28-14, in its 
season finale last weekend and the cathartic impact of the victory was 
immediate and surprisingly immense. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally came together as a team," Hampton, a sophomore running back, said 
when asked why the Vaqueros needed a whole season to put together a solid game. 
"It felt like last year." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, yes. Last year. Or the year before. Or all the years before that going all 
the way back to 1980 -- the last time a Vaquero team finished below .500. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale College football players are driven by the tradition of a program that 
has won or shared four consecutive Western State Conference championships and 
made four appearances in bowl games from 1985-1988. 
</P>
<P>
But this year's team, which finished 5-4-1 overall and 5-3-1 in WSC play, also 
might have been haunted by that legacy and the somewhat unrealistic 
expectations it inspires. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, first-year Coach John Cicuto considered the season a success. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some goals we accomplished and others we fell short of achieving," 
said Cicuto, an assistant under former Vaquero Coach Jim Sartoris. Sartoris 
retired after last season with a 111-64-1 record in 17 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a lot of mistakes," Cicuto said. "It was a learning thing for me in a 
lot of ways. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the season, I thought we'd go 7-3, even though I knew we had an 
inexperienced defense. 
</P>
<P>
"That obviously didn't happen, but finishing the season the way we did against 
Ventura is a positive sign that shows me -- and the players coming back -- that 
we're going in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the season's highlights were provided by an offense that averaged 32.5 
points and 397.5 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore quarterbacks Ronnie Lopez and Darren Fitzgerald alternated in the 
first three games of the season, but Lopez became the starter when Fitzgerald 
injured his shoulder against Compton in the fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, a former City Section 3-A Player of the Year at Franklin High who 
transferred to Glendale after playing last season at Pierce, completed 79 of 
155 passes for 1,296 yards with 13 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"This season was a total change and I was a lot happier," Lopez said. "I came 
back home and they played the rough football, so I kind of enjoyed playing in 
front of everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald completed 45 of 94 passes for 683 yards with four touchdowns and one 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
Hampton, a returning all-conference player who gained 1,150 yards in 1988, 
gained 760 yards this season and scored seven touchdowns. Sophomore Doug 
Dragomer gained 542 yards and scored three times. 
</P>
<P>
Another positive note for Glendale was the emergence of fullback Wes Bender, a 
redshirt freshman from Burroughs High who gained 471 yards and tied a school 
record with 14 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's defense allowed 26.9 points and 324 yards a game, though at the 
beginning of the season it looked as if defense might be Glendale's strength. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore linebacker Mark Reeve led the Vaqueros with 48 tackles, 12 assists 
and 10 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros lost to Pasadena, 24-16, in their opener, then played defending 
national-champion Bakersfield to an 18-18 tie in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's performance left the Vaqueros with confidence that they could play 
with the best -- but it also left them winless at 0-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce provided a remedy the following week as Glendale finally got its offense 
untracked. The Vaqueros rolled to a 43-15 victory, and followed it a week later 
with a 44-41 win over Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale, however, then ran into Los Angeles Southwest, the most improved team 
in the conference, and lost, 26-10. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros rebounded with a 62-26 win over hapless Harbor before being 
whipped by Moorpark 47-27 and losing to Santa Barbara, 49-34. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale then needed a season-ending victory over Ventura gave to notch its 
13th winning season in the last 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Next season, redshirt freshman Marco Arcipreste will be the leading candidate 
to replace Lopez and Fitzgerald at quarterback. Bender will also return, as 
will wide receivers Cody McMahon, Orlando Cade and David Nottoli. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to go out and get some offensive lineman," Cicuto said. "And we have a 
nucleus of good guys on defense to build on. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to our success is our off-season program. If we get a commitment from 
the players to get stronger in the weight room, then I think Glendale will be 
back to what it was the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
"If our kids don't work very hard, we're going to struggle again because we'll 
rely on freshmen again."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDALE COUNCIL OKS PURCHASE OF 4 BUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to purchase four additional 
Beeline shuttle buses to provide more frequent service on existing routes and 
add a route in southern Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Public Works Director George A. Miller told the council that two of the 
requested vehicles will be added to the existing Beeline routes to decrease 
time between buses. The system now runs four shuttle buses during non-peak 
hours and six vehicles during rush hours, according to his report. 
</P>
<P>
The two extra buses would reduce the waiting time from 15 minutes to 10 during 
non-peak hours and from 10 minutes to 7.5 during peak hours. 
</P>
<P>
The additional service is needed to alleviate crowding caused by increased 
ridership, which has more than tripled since last year, from 11,271 passengers 
to 34,452, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"The big increase in ridership is partly because we eliminated the 25-cent fare 
and partly because ridership has been increasing steadily since '85," he later 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller also told the council that the other two shuttles will be used to expand 
the Beeline system with a new route to serve Glendale Memorial Hospital and the 
Amtrak station at 400 W. Cerritos Ave., which will eventually be a 
transportation center connecting the city with downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated cost of the four additional shuttle buses is $225,000 and will 
give the city a total of 11 Beeline vehicles, he said in his report.

CAL POLY COACH DARLENE MAY SHOOTS FOR HER 400TH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Longtime Cal Poly Pomona Coach Darlene May will be after a milestone when the 
Broncos play host to Weber State at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at Poly Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
May, in her 16th season as coach of the women's basketball team, is only one 
win away from her 400th career victory. She will take a 399-91 record into the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona is 2-0 while Weber State will play its opener. 
</P>
<P>
It was business as usual for Cal Poly last week as it won its second straight 
Bronco Classic. Pomona crushed San Francisco State, 91-38, in the first round 
and defeated California Collegiate Athletic Assn. rival Cal State Northridge, 
83-73, in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos were led by senior All-American forward Niki Bracken (6-2), who 
averaged 20 points last season to lead the team to a 28-6 record and the NCAA 
Division II final. Bracken scored 54 points in the two games last week, 
including a tournament-record 32 against Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Another impressive performer for the Broncos was 6-2 freshman center Danielle 
Carter, an All-CIF Southern Section performer for Fontana High last season, who 
averaged 12.5 points and nine rebounds in the two games. 
</P>
<P>
Carter was a reserve in the games but still made the all-tournament team along 
with Bracken, the tournament's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona is also starting junior Kelly Connelly (6-1) at forward, senior Marcine 
Edmonds (6-1) at center and juniors Stephanie Coons (5-11) and Denise Ogburn 
(5-5) at guard. 
</P>
<P>
Weber State is led by 5-6 guard Melanie Knott, who averaged 13 points last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing second in its own tournament last week, the Cal Poly Pomona 
men's basketball team will step up in class to visit NCAA Division I opponents 
Southern Utah State and UC Berkeley on Saturday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, 1-1, will visit Southern Utah at 7:30 p.m. Saturday in Cedar City 
and Cal at 7:30 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Both opponents figure to cause problems for the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Utah, which will be playing its season opener, is led by 5-8 Kenny Lee 
who averaged 12 points last season. The Thunderbirds have eight players who are 
6-6 or taller, including former USC and Brigham Young center Alan Pollard at 
7-3. 
</P>
<P>
California, which suffered a 101-81 loss to top-ranked Nevada-Las Vegas in the 
second round of the National Invitational Tournament after defeating Air Force 
70-49, is 1-1. The Bears are led by guards Keith Smith (6-4) and Ryan Drew 
(6-3) and former Diamond Bar High star Brian Hendrick (6-8) at center. 
</P>
<P>
On the bright side, Pomona appeared much better than its 7-19 squad of last 
year in the Bronco Classic. Pomona defeated Pacific Christian, 110-83, before 
dropping a 104-95 decision to Chico State in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos were sparked by junior forward Terry Ross (6-6), who scored 37 
points and grabbed 14 rebounds against Pacific Christian, and junior guard 
Chancellor McCobb (6-3), who scored 20 points against Chico. The team also 
starts Jim Skinner (6-4) at forward, Rafael Vargas (6-7) at center and D.J. 
Norman (6-1) at guard. 
</P>
<P>
Six teams from the San Gabriel Valley are listed in the latest Kinney 
California State High School Cross-Country Rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the list is Maranatha of Sierra Madre, which is rated in both the boys 
and girls polls. The Minutemen are ranked No. 3 in boys Division III and fourth 
in girls Division III. 
</P>
<P>
The Maranatha girls figure to advance higher after winning their fourth 
consecutive CIF Southern Section 1-A Division title last week. 
</P>
<P>
The only other valley team ranked in Division III is the La Salle boys at No. 
5. In Division II, South Pasadena is ranked No. 7 in the boys division and San 
Marino is No. 5 and South Hills of West Covina is No. 6 in the girls division.

FISHING NOTES: CHANGING SEASONS SIGNAL ROCK COD ACTION IN DEEP WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN STANTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seasons change and so do the species of fish anglers will be trying for in the 
fall and winter. 
</P>
<P>
With surface fish not as plentiful, the most sought-after will be rock cod. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers will be bringing out stout rods and big reels to fish depths from 150 
to more than 600 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Another popular method is to bounce a heavy jig on the bottom or use the 
five-hook ganion with a lead weight of a pound or more. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 50 species of rock fish that can be brought to the surface. 
Among the most popular are the salmon grouper, ling cod, red snapper and the 
cow cod, which, when caught deep, floats to the top. 
</P>
<P>
Although rock fish will represent most of the catches, all landings will 
schedule combination surface and bottom fish trips. 
</P>
<P>
There are many rock spots in the South Bay and outer islands. 
</P>
<P>
The angler who ventures out on a cod trip for the first time will discover all 
the cellar dwellers are considered excellent eating. 
</P>
<P>
With a good supply of squid, all indications point to a good white sea bass 
season. 
</P>
<P>
King Harbor Marlin Club member Jerry Austin has added to the club's 
tag-and-release program again. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing from his boat Geronimo and using only eight-pound test line, he hooked 
a marlin and, after setting the hook, battled the jumper for two hours and 27 
minutes before it came alongside the boat so Austin could insert a tag and 
release it. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated weight was 130 pounds. This catch brings the club's total to 40 
for this season. 
</P>
<P>
With the marlin season winding down, the weigh station at Avalon has been 
closed for the year by Rose Cadman, who has been weighing marlin for 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
Cadman said a weigh-in season record was established, as she counted 393, 
shattering the mark of 333 set in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
She said this figure doesn't count the marlin released. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Gary Budd of Gardena, fishing aboard the Southern Cal, used 
cut squid to hook the whopper of the week, a ling cod that weighed 33 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Gorlack of San Pedro, on a two-day trip aboard the Top Gun, caught the 
jackpot fish at San Clemente Island, a 24-pound yellowtail pulled out of the 
kelp. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Hera of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the Sea Spray at Rocky Point, 
won the jackpot with a 17-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Gasper of San Pedro, on the Shogun at Catalina Island, caught an 18-pound 
yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Marie Ellis of Lomita, fishing aboard the Hitless Miss at the oil rigs, caught 
a 14 1/2-pound salmon grouper. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: The bonito and sculpin bite at Rocky Point continues. Santa 
Monica Bay has been best for some good-sized halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Rock cod fishing has been rated good for both shallow and deep-rock areas. 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Betty O rock cod special fished the 
Rockpile and anglers sacked 270 rock cod and 10 ling cod. 
</P>
<P>
The Del Mar trip to Sunset Beach garnered 125 sculpin, 35 calico bass and seven 
halibut. 
</P>
<P>
The Happyman ventured on two half-day trips to Santa Monica Bay and returned 
with 28 halibut and 40 sculpin. 
</P>
<P>
At Redondo Sportfishing: Anglers on the Sea Spray, fishing Rocky Point, scored 
with 284 sculpin, 72 calico bass and six halibut. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Special anglers on the morning half-day trip landed 320 sculpin and 
93 calico bass. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackjack rock cod trip to San Clemente Island resulted in a wide-open 
whitefish count of 220, plus 50 sheepshead. 
</P>
<P>
The Isle of Redondo barge accounted for 495 mackerel and 41 rockfish. 
</P>
<P>
At 22nd Street Landing: The First String worked the west end of Catalina Island 
for a catch of 206 bonito, 100 blue perch, 12 calico bass and nine sheepshead. 
</P>
<P>
The Monte Carlo half-day trip to White's Point resulted in a bonito bite of 
155, plus 41 calico bass. 
</P>
<P>
The Daiwa on a two-day rock cod trip to Cherry Bank returned with 236 reds and 
16 cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
At L.A. Harbor Sportfishing: The Matt Walsh on a half-day trip to Horseshoe 
Kelp chalked up 44 bonito, 18 sculpin, six sheepshead and two rockfish. 
</P>
<P>
The Top Gun rock cod trip to San Clemente returned with a variety: 340 red rock 
cod, 64 calico bass, one white sea bass and one yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
The Annie B barge had a weekend count of 750 kingfish, 215 jacksmelt, 75 
Spanish mackerel and 11 halibut. 
</P>
<P>
At Long Beach Sportfishing: The Victory trip to Rocky Point found bonito, 129 
going into the sacks with 101 calico bass. 
</P>
<P>
The El Dorado's Catalina trip provided anglers with 111 bonito, 60 calico bass 
and one yellowtail.

PRAGUE TALKS MAY INDICATE IMMINENT CHANGE AT TOP

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid reports of imminent changes in the party leadership, Czechoslovakia's 
ruling Communist Party on Wednesday announced a Central Committee meeting has 
been moved up to Friday. The committee, initially scheduled to meet Dec. 14, 
has the power to replace party leader Milos Jakes. 
</P>
<P>
Prague Radio also announced late Wednesday that the ruling Politburo had 
convened "to discuss the domestic situation." 
</P>
<P>
Party sources believe both meetings signal impending changes in the leadership, 
but it remains unclear whether they could mark the end for Jakes himself, one 
of Eastern Europe's last remaining hard-line leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The intense party activity came as the Prague government came under growing 
pressure from a budding political opposition. Once again, a crowd estimated at 
150,000 to 200,000 jammed the capital's main Wenceslas Square to demand the 
resignation of the party's hierarchy and free elections. 
</P>
<P>
And for the first time, the architect of the country's 1968 "Prague Spring" 
liberalization, Alexander Dubcek, publicly declared his support for a main 
opposition demand. Although the former Communist leader did not personally 
appear at Wednesday's rally, his statement supporting the demand for the 
resignation of Jakes and five other hard-liners was read to the cheering crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Other reports said Dubcek might personally address a rally later this week. 
</P>
<P>
The repression that occurred with the Soviet invasion and Dubcek's ouster has 
left Dubcek virtually a non-person among young people. But for those who lived 
through the period of hope he brought to Prague in the spring of 1968, his 
support would carry a special significance. 
</P>
<P>
Dubcek's statement came as support grew both for the central opposition group, 
Civic Forum, and for the two-hour anti-government general strike planned for 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, some factory workers said they plan to back the strike. At 
Civic Forum's first news conference, it was reported that employees at the 
large CKD semiconductor factory in suburban Prague had voted by 1,407 to 3 in 
favor of joining the strike. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's opposition rally, banners from several workers groups appeared, 
including one from the Prague municipal subway system. Some trucks in Prague 
also carried pro-strike banners taped to their doors. 
</P>
<P>
But there was also evidence that many factories planned to reject the strike 
call. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia's opposition movement was for years limited to a handful of 
intellectuals, but in the course of the past week, it has spread through much 
of the country's student population. If workers also support the stoppage in 
large numbers, it would be a further devastating blow to a Communist Party 
already in turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
The strike has been called to press demands for immediate political change, 
including free elections and an end to one-party rule. Because of this, the 
regime Wednesday was actively pressuring workers to remain on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Government militiamen reportedly ripped down pro-strike posters at the CKD 
factory, while plant security officers prevented student strike leaders from 
entering other installations. An appeal by the Prague Communist Party for other 
factories to ignore the strike was prominently printed in the main party 
newspaper, Rude Pravo. 
</P>
<P>
A struggle also appeared to remain within the official Czechoslovak Television. 
Although it transmitted live coverage of the opposition rally for the first 
time Wednesday and reported opposition activity, its coverage was less 
extensive than it had been on Tuesday. No crowd estimate was given, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Civic Forum leader Vaclav Havel appealed for support from other East 
European groups pressing for reform, including East Germany's New Forum. In 
addition, he said, letters were sent both to President Bush and Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev asking for support. 
</P>
<P>
Havel especially appealed to Gorbachev to reject the legitimacy of the 1968 
Soviet invasion. Most of those in the current Czechoslovak party leadership are 
hard-liners installed by Moscow following that invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Domestically, Civic Forum won important backing from a group of economic 
forecasters, who pledged their support in helping the opposition formulate an 
economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want people to say Civic Forum is made up only of actors and others 
who don't know how to run the country," said Vaclav Claus, a respected 
economist. "Our forecasts are for the 'day after' (the end of Communist rule), 
to allow Czechoslovakia to face a transition period without chaos and 
inflation." 
</P>
<P>
As more support flowed to the political opposition, the party attempted to stem 
the visible erosion of its power with a series of dire warnings. A statement by 
Prague party leaders alluded to hysteria and warned of students and others "who 
were becoming a tool in the hands of those who want deception and 
destabilization and a return to the period before February, 1948." 
</P>
<P>
That date was the month Czechoslovakia became Communist.

EASTERN PILOTS END STRIKE BUT JOBS ARE GONE

<P>
Eastern Airlines' pilots voted late Wednesday to end a bitter nine-month 
walkout, but the airline's mechanics said they would continue to strike. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots' decision to end their strike is largely symbolic because Eastern 
has replaced the 1,800 striking pilots and says it has no jobs to offer them. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's pilots voted to end their dispute one day after President Bush vetoed 
legislation that would have created a blue-ribbon panel to investigate the 
strike. In his veto message, Bush said that Congress, which would have set up 
the panel, had no business interfering in contract disputes. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the pilots said the congressional panel had been the union's 
last hope to resolve its differences with Eastern and its parent company, Texas 
Air Corp. "We ran out of options," said the spokesman, pilot Wayne Dolan. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Bryan, head of the striking machinists, was angered by the pilots' 
move. 
</P>
<P>
"Our ranks are unaffected by this," Bryan said from his home in Miami. "The 
strike continues. We were the ones who were carrying the strike anyway for the 
last two or three months. 
</P>
<P>
"Eastern has been desperate for maintenance and ground support," he added. "We 
are unchanged by this decision." 
</P>
<P>
However, airline analysts said that the striking machinists also have been 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan said "it is unclear to me" why the pilots ended their strike. "Eastern 
claims they had all the pilots they needed when the pilots broke ranks and many 
crossed the picket lines in August." 
</P>
<P>
Art Kent, a spokesman for Texas Air, said that the pilots' decision to end the 
strike was "a very interesting development," adding: "It is unfortunate that it 
did not come earlier. We could have avoided all the trauma and heartache which 
has affected Eastern and its employees." 
</P>
<P>
Kent said that Eastern had no jobs available for the striking pilots, but he 
said that they could add their names to a waiting list that already contains 
200 names. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope the pilots' action indicates a real willingness to sit down and work 
out the terms whereby Eastern and all its pilots can come together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern pilots walked off the job on March 5 to support the striking 
International Assn. of Machinists, which represents mechanics and other ground 
workers. The strike's immediate impact was significant, forcing Eastern to 
cancel 90% of its flights and lay off 7,000 non-union workers. 
</P>
<P>
On March 9, a crippled Eastern filed for bankruptcy court protection from its 
creditors, then slowly began rebuilding as a much smaller airline. To raise 
money, it sold about one-third of its 255 aircraft as well as its profitable 
Northeast shuttle operations, which New York real-estate magnate Donald Trump 
now owns. It is talking with American Airlines about the possible sale of its 
Latin America routes. 
</P>
<P>
The unions had hoped to force Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo to sell Eastern, 
and the strike's high point occurred in April, when Lorenzo did agree to sell 
the airline to a group headed by former baseball commissioner Peter V. 
Ueberroth for $464 million. 
</P>
<P>
But the deal fell apart when the unions demanded that Lorenzo step down before 
the sale was completed and Lorenzo refused. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern now has 1,800 pilots flying about 780 flights a day to 85 cities, down 
from 3,600 pilots and nearly 1,100 daily flights before the strike. 
</P>
<P>
The participation of the pilots had been crucial to the machinists' strike, 
because pilots are difficult to replace. But many Eastern pilots became 
disillusioned as the strike wore on, and 800 eventually returned to work. 
Another 800 pilots retired or went to work for other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the strike forced a rift in the leadership of Eastern's pilots' union. 
The members voted to replace its conciliatory chairman with Skip Copeland, a 
hard-liner when it comes to management relations. On Wednesday, he accused 
Lorenzo of dismantling Eastern with a "scorched-earth policy." 
</P>
<P>
The machinists struck the airline over a contract dispute. Eastern sought $150 
million in wage concessions, but the machinists sought $50 million in higher 
pay. Union officers said that most of Eastern's 8,500 machinists have remained 
on strike.

12 GREEN BERETS RACE FROM SALVADOR HOTEL;

LATIN AMERICA: REBELS SLIP AWAY IN MIDDLE OF NIGHT. U.S. NATIONALS ARE SAFE 
AFTER 28-HOUR STANDOFF.

<P>
Tense and tired, with weapons in hand, 12 U.S. Army Green Berets raced from a 
luxury hotel tower Wednesday, 28 hours after leftist guerrillas trapped them 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
They said the rebels who had occupied the Sheraton Hotel escaped Tuesday 
evening while church and relief workers evacuated 17 civilians from other 
floors of the hotel's VIP tower. 
</P>
<P>
"They slipped out the back," one soldier said. "They slipped down the 
stairwell, went out back and jumped over the wall." 
</P>
<P>
But the Americans said they remained in the tower overnight because they 
believed guerrilla sharpshooters were posted on the roof. They said the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) rebels had told them the 
stairwells were mined. 
</P>
<P>
Their departure Wednesday morning followed an unusual standoff in which the 
rebels were as trapped as the armed U.S. soldiers and other hotel guests. 
During much of the 13-hour rebel occupation, the hotel was surrounded by 
government troops who kept up a barrage of fire. 
</P>
<P>
A Roman Catholic bishop mediated the one-hour cease-fire between the guerrillas 
and the government that allowed Red Cross ambulances to remove the 17 trapped 
civilians. But U.S. officials took part in the talks through an open telephone 
line to the sixth floor of the besieged hotel tower. 
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire also allowed the rebels to leave without the appearance of a 
deal and provided a bloodless ending to a conflict that all sides had worked 
hard to contain. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Bush Administration officials insisted Wednesday that the U.S. 
role in helping free the Americans did not breach a longstanding U.S. policy of 
refusing to negotiate with terrorists. They would not confirm whether there had 
been a deal allowing the rebels to go free along with the Americans and other 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
The siege of the hotel in the wealthy Escalon neighborhood was part of a 
sweeping urban guerrilla offensive that began Nov. 11 in San Salvador and at 
least two provincial capitals. The rebels said their assault on Escalon was 
retribution for the Salvadoran army's aerial assaults on embattled poor 
neighborhoods, but they never explained their objective in trying to take the 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The brief truce was the first negotiated pause in the rebel offensive, which 
has left thousands of dead and wounded. Roman Catholic Church officials have 
been pushing for a permanent cease-fire and negotiations to end the decade-old 
war. In one way, the hotel siege set back those efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Joao Baena Soares, the secretary general of the Organization of American 
States, had come to El Salvador to reinforce the church's mediation efforts but 
hurriedly left the country Tuesday, without notifying church officials, after 
army troops evacuated him from the hotel's main tower. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington on Wednesday, Soares told the permanent council of the OAS that 
he is ready to go back in order to negotiate a cease-fire in the Salvadoran 
civil war. For the first time since launching the offensive, the FMLN offered 
Wednesday night to negotiate a cease-fire. There was no immediate government 
reply. 
</P>
<P>
The siege, a propaganda success for the rebels, was one of the more bizarre 
chapters in a decade-old war between a sophisticated guerrilla force and a 
U.S.-backed army that has held them at bay. The Americans agreed not to 
exchange gunfire with the guerrillas, who in turn passed notes from American 
civilians on the sixth floor to the Green Berets positioned behind barricades 
of furniture on the fourth floor. 
</P>
<P>
The army, unused to fighting in neighborhoods with tennis clubs and BMWs, fired 
artillery shells at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. soldiers, nervous long after the guerrillas had left, accused 
journalists who entered the hotel Wednesday of harboring rebels in their midst. 
Before leaving the hotel, they forced reporters inside to lie face down on the 
floor and checked their bags. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who failed to take the main hotel building, told one guest their 
disappointment was that they never got to swim in the oversized pool between 
the two towers. 
</P>
<P>
According to interviews with soldiers, civilian captives, rescue workers and 
officials, the ordeal unfolded this way: 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, U.S. Special Forces on temporary duty, were asleep early Tuesday 
morning on the fourth floor of the hotel annex when pistol shots erupted 
outside, followed by machine-gun fire. 
</P>
<P>
"We got up and saw the guerrillas crossing the parking lot. We got our weapons 
and went to the end of the hall," said one soldier. Like all the Americans, he 
declined to give his name. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers built barricades of tables, mattresses and chairs across the 
blue-carpeted hallway. Soon, two guerrillas appeared in a stairwell midway down 
the hall. 
</P>
<P>
"We told them to stop," a sergeant said. "They said they were FMLN. We said we 
were Americans and we didn't want to fight. They said they didn't either. They 
told us they were going to bring people through. They said, 'Don't shoot and we 
won't shoot.' " 
</P>
<P>
The rebels then carried boxes of food and ammunition up to the sixth floor, 
where three American civilians had rooms. As Salvadoran army troops surrounded 
the square block of hotel ground, the rebels radioed for reinforcements. 
Guerrillas took up positions in houses around the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Also trapped in the annex were four chambermaids and 13 civilian guests. 
</P>
<P>
About noon, the Green Berets heard the rebels on their floor tinkering with 
metal and tin cans and feared they were making a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to check it out, but they were opening cans. They were having 
breakfast -- sardines," said the sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
About noon, U.S. officials managed to get a telephone call through to an 
American contract employee of the Agency for International Development on the 
sixth floor. He became the link between rebels, the soldiers, American and 
Salvadoran officials. 
</P>
<P>
"They were in contact with the fourth floor," said a source close to the 
negotiations. "He would slip notes through the guerrillas, and the guerrillas 
would pass the notes to the other end (soldiers). . . . The guerrillas were in 
and out of the room, but they let him sit on the telephone and talk." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador William Walker said Salvadoran officials carried out the 
cease-fire negotiations, but he said U.S. Embassy officials got on the line to 
read the rebels what their highest commanders were saying over the clandestine 
Radio Venceremos. 
</P>
<P>
Walker repeatedly referred to the Americans as "hostages" who were taken by 
"terrorists" in an "outrageous and irrational action." But he acknowledged that 
the rebels demanded nothing more than conditions for their own safe retreat.

EMBEZZLEMENT: THE MAN WHO ALLEGEDLY BILKED CALIFORNIA OF $5.1 MILLION APPEARS 
IN POLICE FILES UNDER AN ASSUMED NAME, LIVING IN A SMALL CITY. HE WAS A BIG 
SPENDER AND GENEROUS TIPPER.

<P>
The man accused of embezzling $5.1 million from the California Water Resources 
Control Board was a big spender and generous tipper during the four years he 
lived under an assumed name in this city near Phoenix, according to neighbors, 
vendors and police. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Wayne Fowler, 35, who went by the name William David Rice, would pay as 
much as $1,300 in a single night to women ordered from escort services, 
according to police investigation files. The reports say that he told officers 
on one occasion that he hired women for nude dancing and to have sex with him 
at his home "all the time." 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 13, the reports state, Fowler told several officers who had been sent 
to his home to investigate a complaint of assault that he had given a $500 tip 
to each of two women dancers -- on top of a regular $300 escort service fee -- 
so that they would engage in sexual intercourse with him. When they refused, he 
became abusive and violent, the police files state. 
</P>
<P>
However, although Mesa police said that Fowler has been investigated for sexual 
misconduct, assault, possession of dangerous drugs and possession of marijuana, 
his only arrest was in 1988 for drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews with the night manager of a bar and restaurant frequented by 
Fowler and with seven of his neighbors, a picture emerged of the suspect as a 
free spender who enjoyed entertaining young women. 
</P>
<P>
"There were so many visitors coming to the house that we could not help but be 
impressed," recalled Christ Strauch, who lives across the street from Fowler's 
home. "We particularly enjoyed seeing two blonde women in a silver Maserati 
convertible. It seemed like they came every Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Harrian, the night manager of an establishment called The Dirty Drummer 
next to a video store Fowler operated in Mesa until about a year ago, said 
Fowler often patronized his bar and restaurant. Harrian said it was Fowler's 
custom to order the most expensive steak dinner on the menu and then leave tips 
of 80% of the bill. He said Fowler was often accompanied by one or two 
exotic-looking women. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the residents who lived nearby said Fowler had made attempts to be a 
good neighbor. Bob Neville, for instance, said that when one of Fowler's two 
big watchdogs killed "our little dog," Fowler was extremely apologetic and 
offered amends and payment. 
</P>
<P>
But neighbors also told of police coming to their cul-de-sac on the northwest 
side of Mesa to question Fowler about what they thought were a series of minor 
offenses -- such as leaving his 18-foot power boat parked on the street. 
Additionally, they said, Fowler's home was burglarized three years ago and that 
he told them guns and video equipment were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and attorneys refused to discuss Fowler, who is in the Maricopa County 
Jail in Phoenix in lieu of a $6.85-million bond pending a California 
extradition request. 
</P>
<P>
Two women occupying the comfortable home where Fowler was living -- which, 
according to property records, was sold by Fowler earlier this year for $90,000 
-- refused to say anything. 
</P>
<P>
Mesa Police Sgt. Michael J. Hayes said the investigation of the Oct. 13 
incident, in which a young woman from an escort service accused Fowler of 
ripping a $300 watch from her wrist and taking her briefcase after she refused 
to have sex with him, is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes said an earlier investigation of rape allegations against Fowler was 
dropped when the woman declined to press charges. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes also said an investigation of Fowler for possession of marijuana in 1987 
had been dropped because the circumstances of discovery made a conviction 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Sacramento, a Municipal judge refused to allow Fowler's mother to 
post bond for Fowler's ex-wife, Jill Baume, 26, because of allegations that the 
mother had received embezzled money from her son. Baume has been charged with 
filing a false tax return and receiving stolen property in connection with the 
alleged embezzlement. 
</P>
<P>
After her arrest, Baume told investigators that Fowler had given his parents 
money to invest in businesses and that they knew "where the money had come 
from," testified Andrea Machem, a State Department of Justice investigator. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler's mother, Linda, a retired state employee, testified that she had 
invested in a video rental business. She also said she recently cashed in 
$25,000 in South African gold coins. When he was arrested in Arizona, Fowler 
was operating a video rental store and kept gold coins at his home. But she 
testified that she did not receive funds from her son and had no knowledge of 
the alleged embezzlement. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Fowler told the judge that she wanted to bail out her former 
daughter-in-law because she felt as if Baume was her own daughter. "She didn't 
divorce the family," she said

VAST INVESTMENT IN STATE POLITICS BY KEATING TOLD

<P>
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr., his family and his 
business empire poured nearly $350,000 into state politics during 1985 and 
1986, with about half of it going to Gov. George Deukmejian's reelection 
campaign, contribution records show. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the $173,000 donated to Deukmejian's campaign, Keating's family and 
business connections also contributed $176,500 over the two years to Democratic 
and Republican groups and such politicians as then-Assembly Republican Leader 
Pat Nolan of Glendale and Gray Davis in his successful race for state 
controller. 
</P>
<P>
The figures do not include at least $83,336 in contributions made personally or 
through the firms of two other Keating associates -- Los Angeles attorney Karl 
M. Samuelian and San Diego businessman Tom C. Stickel. 
</P>
<P>
Keating hired Samuelian, the governor's chief fund raiser, to be one of his 
California attorneys. He also invested heavily in a San Diego company 
controlled by Stickel, who also was a Deukmejian fund raiser and became the 
Republican Party's finance co-chairman in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie Keating's political reach, in retrospect, was phenomenal," Stickel 
said in a recent interview about Keating's political muscle. 
</P>
<P>
The political largess in Sacramento was part of a web of influence that the 
blunt-talking Arizona businessman wove throughout the country to nurture and 
protect his ill-fated financial and investment companies, which regulators now 
contend inflated the value of their assets and deceived investors into buying 
high-risk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Keating's American Continental Corp. of Phoenix filed for bankruptcy, 
prompting federal officials to immediately take over its subsidiary Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan. The move is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion -- the 
costliest savings and loan bailout in American history. 
</P>
<P>
After the seizure, the outspoken Keating candidly declared that he had expected 
the political contributions to prod influential politicians, such as U.S. Sen. 
Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), to fend off hostile regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"One question, among the many raised in recent weeks, had to do with whether my 
financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my 
cause," said Keating. "I want to say in the most forceful way I can, I 
certainly hope so." 
</P>
<P>
In California, Keating hired key Deukmejian supporters or appointees to help 
protect his ill-fated Lincoln Savings. As attorneys, he hired fund raiser 
Samuelian and Franklin Tom, a former state commissioner of savings and loan who 
left public service to join Samuelian's Los Angeles law firm. The lawyers 
helped Keating obtain state permission to float more than $200 million in 
high-risk bonds, on which his company subsequently defaulted. 
</P>
<P>
Keating also paid $200,000 in 1985 for the consulting services of former 
Savings and Loan Commissioner Lawrence W. Taggart, who had left government 
service in December, 1984, for a job with TCS Enterprises of San Diego. Days 
before he left for TCS, Taggart approved a request by Lincoln to increase the 
amount of assets the institution could sink into high-risk real estate 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1985, when Taggart joined TCS, Keating hired him as an executive 
and paid $2.89 million to buy 19.2% of the fledgling San Diego firm's stock as 
it went public. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Keating and his associates were investing heavily in California 
state politics. His coalition of contributors included his family -- son 
Charles Keating III and three sons-in-law -- and his corporations, including 
American Continental, Lincoln Savings and three other subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
The group also included eight employees and executives, such as American 
Continental Vice President Robert J. Kielty and consultant Taggart, as well as 
Phoenix business associate Conley Wolfs-winkel, who bought 6,150 acres in 
Tucson with American Continental in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
While Keating himself gave only $7,000 -- all of it to Deukmejian -- the 
coalition of his relatives, business interests and associates brought total 
donations to $349,500 in 1985 and 1986. Reports show: 
</P>
<P>
* Deukmejian received $173,000 from the Arizona businessman and his associates. 
The governor received $80,000 directly from American Continental and Lincoln 
Savings; $19,000 from Keating and his family members; $51,000 from other 
American Continental subsidiaries and executives; and $23,000 from Keating 
business associates. 
</P>
<P>
The governor has said that he met Keating only once and never knew of Lincoln's 
financial woes until he read about them in newspaper reports this year. 
</P>
<P>
* Keating and associates gave $176,500 to other state political organizations 
and politicians. They gave $7,500 to the California Republican Party, $50,000 
to the League of Conservative Voters, $17,000 to then-Assemblyman Davis' 
campaign for state controller, and $85,000 to the state Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
They also gave $17,000 to four legislators -- Nolan, who authored the law 
deregulating the savings and loan industry in 1982; Assembly Rules Committee 
Chairman Tom Bane (D-Van Nuys); Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan (D-Fresno), and 
Assemblyman Dennis Brown (R-Los Alamitos). 
</P>
<P>
* Stickel and TCS contributed $50,666 in money, staff time and office space to 
Deukmejian and the Republican Party. Samuelian and his law partners gave 
$32,700. 
</P>

Bush Administration officials insisted Wednesday that the U.S. role in helping 
free Americans trapped in El Salvador did not breach a longstanding U.S. policy 
of refusing to negotiate with terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
They would not confirm whether there had been a deal allowing the Salvadoran 
rebels to go free along with the Americans and other foreigners caught in the 
Sheraton Hotel on Tuesday after a pre-dawn assault by Salvadoran guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that there was an agreement to let them go," Assistant Secretary 
of State Bernard Aronson told reporters at a State Department briefing. He said 
that during negotiations, the Salvadoran forces withdrew from around the 
Sheraton Hotel. "The terrorists probably took advantage of that opportunity and 
other opportunities to get out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He and other State Department officials confirmed that a U.S. Embassy official 
arranged for the open phone line over which the Salvadoran government conducted 
negotiations with the rebels. However, the officials sought to avoid giving the 
impression that the successful outcome had been the result of a deal between 
the United States and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). 
</P>
<P>
President Bush acknowledged that he had dispatched special U.S. troops to El 
Salvador on his own Tuesday, before either obtaining a request from Salvadoran 
President Alfredo Cristiani or seeking his approval. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him (Cristiani) what we were going to do, and he acquiesced," Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters aboard Air Force One on a trip to Memphis, Tenn., Bush 
said: "When you see Americans held hostage like this, there's a message in all 
of this: the President, backed by our defense secretary, is going to protect 
the lives of Americans however we can and go to any ends to protect the lives 
of American citizens." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. aides attempted to portray the rebels' seizure of the Sheraton Hotel as an 
attempt to divert public attention from the "military shellacking" they have 
taken during their offensive in San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"The FMLN failed totally in this offensive," Aronson said. "They probably lost, 
in terms of wounded or killed, somewhere between 15% or 20% of their forces -- 
maybe more." He estimated that more than 1,000 of the leftist guerrillas were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
"So now, what they're going to do and what they are doing, is simply trying to 
do something that's unexpected (so they can) get on television. . .," he said. 
"They will do something else in the next few days if they can. They will grab 
some embassy, they will grab some individual, if they can get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler gave the following official U.S. 
account of the hotel incident: 
</P>
<P>
At least a dozen rebels sneaked into the Sheraton Hotel before dawn Tuesday, at 
a time when at least 15 U.S. officials and some private American citizens were 
inside. The guerrillas did not occupy the entire hotel but succeeded in taking 
custody of 17 people, including "several" contract employees of the U.S. Agency 
for International Development and an American spouse. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, an armed U.S. military contingent of 12 "trainer-evaluators," 
said to be on temporary duty in El Salvador, barricaded themselves inside the 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"They warned the guerrillas that they would use their weapons only if forced to 
do so in their own defense," Tutwiler said. "The guerrillas did not try to 
break into their area." 
</P>
<P>
During the telephone talks, the government arranged to have the FMLN turn over 
the foreigners to a team of Red Cross and Roman Catholic Church aides. The 
civilians were released Tuesday night. The rebels also disappeared from the 
hotel Tuesday night, and the U.S. military contingent walked out Wednesday 
morning.

EAST BLOC: WITH THE SUCCESS OF EACH DEMONSTRATION, THE CITIZENS ARE GETTING 
BOLDER.

<P>
The East Germans, the Bulgarians and now the Czechoslovaks taking to the 
streets by the hundreds of thousands during this remarkable autumn in Eastern 
Europe are trampling beneath them the twin pillars of 40 years of Communist 
rule in the region -- fear and futility. 
</P>
<P>
The marchers represent both cause and effect, with the success of each 
demonstration further allaying fear of reprisals and encouraging more thousands 
to take part next time. Also, television footage of protests in one East 
European country is today far more likely than previously to be seen in 
another, multiplying the impact of any demonstration by "internationalizing" 
it. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, each new mass protest accelerates the political chain reaction 
whose blinding speed has already left longtime students of the region agog. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to adjust our sights or buy a new pair of glasses, because this is 
amazing," Vlad Kusin, a senior analyst at Radio Free Europe in Munich, said. 
</P>
<P>
"People smelled change in the air," added George Schopflin, lecturer in East 
European politics at the London School of Economics. "And then all the 
inhibitions and all the fears left. They realized it's OK to take to the 
streets, because they won't be alone." 
</P>
<P>
More than that, said Jacques Rupnik, a senior fellow at the Center for 
International Affairs' Foundation Nationale Science Politique in Paris, fear 
has switched sides in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
With little genuine popular support, the hard-line regimes in East Germany, 
Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria have long been fragile. So, Rupnik noted, once the 
population begins to believe that there will be no Soviet invasion and that 
their own security forces will not shoot them down in the street, "the fear 
switches from the society to the people in power. This is what we're seeing now 
in Prague." 
</P>
<P>
Repeated use of deadly force to put down unauthorized outbursts of public 
disaffection -- in East Germany in 1953, Poland and Hungary in 1956, 
Czechoslovakia in 1968, and Poland again in 1970, 1976 and 1981 -- made fear 
the ally of Communist regimes. 
</P>
<P>
And even when fear began to lose its power, such as in Solidarity-led Poland, 
there remained a sense of the futility of protest. But now, with the Solidarity 
coalition government in Warsaw and with Hungary preparing for the region's 
first free national elections in 40 years, the sense of futility has given way 
to a domino theory of regional reform. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarians credit the Poles for the first major political breakthrough, 
winning government agreement to share power with Solidarity. That proved that 
Moscow was willing to put up with more far-reaching political reform than most 
in the region had dared hope. 
</P>
<P>
Budapest, in turn, helped force East Berlin's hand by punching the first 
symbolic holes in the Iron Curtain and then opening its borders to East Germans 
fleeing to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands left through Hungary, then through Czechoslovakia -- and thousands 
more demonstrated for change at home. 
</P>
<P>
A key element of Stalinist-style social control has always been to isolate 
individuals as much as possible from each other by spreading fear and mistrust, 
Schopflin noted. But "the moment that starts to break down, people come 
together again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a European tradition dating from the French Revolution, the London scholar 
added, that means going into the streets: Wide boulevards and big squares in 
the Continent's major cities are made to order for such protests. 
</P>
<P>
Even as postwar Eastern European regimes suppressed all forms of spontaneous 
public demonstrations, they staged their own carefully choreographed, 
"rent-a-crowd" versions for ritual homage to Communist leaders and holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Schopflin said, "It's a way of saying 'This is the only political 
mechanism available to us. We will make use of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the critical point was reached when East Germany began to tip," said 
Kusin, the Radio Free Europe analyst. What he termed the four "rejectionist 
countries" -- East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria -- "survived 
to a certain extent on the idea that Poland and Hungary are special: 'We can 
fence ourselves in. We don't have to imitate what they're doing. Fat lot of 
good it's all done for the Poles, anyway.' " 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev put an end to that idea by withdrawing 
Moscow's support from the hard-liners, Rupnik said, adding: "He has unleashed 
something that he cannot control. He has destabilized the ruling elites . . . . 
That's his main achievement." 
</P>
<P>
The first to go among the four was East Germany's Erich Honecker, followed by 
Bulgaria's Todor Zhivkov. And their departures added to the sense that the 
moment for change had arrived -- that it was no longer futile to demand it. 
</P>
<P>
Once the new leadership in East Germany opened its borders, effectively 
neutralizing the Berlin Wall, Czechoslovakia was bound to be caught up in the 
maelstrom, Rupnik said. 
</P>
<P>
"With a Solidarity government in Poland, free elections in Hungary and the wall 
coming down in Berlin, how on earth can you keep pretending that nothing is 
happening in Prague?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
There was a telling moment during a demonstration in Leipzig on Monday, when a 
student told the crowd he had come from Bratislava, Czechoslovakia. The East 
Germans cheered wildly. 
</P>
<P>
Kusin, who saw the incident on West German television, called it symbolic of 
another important element in the East European drama. "The 
'internationalization' (of protests) must be taken as largely responsible for 
the speed with which things have happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Radio Free Europe, his employer, is another force for breaking down the 
barriers that had formerly isolated East Europeans from each other, as are 
other Western radio stations like the BBC, Voice of America and Deutsche Welle. 
</P>
<P>
Radio Free Europe has been receiving a steadily increasing flow of telephone 
calls from East European listeners, according to Deputy Director Robert 
Gillette. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've done is help contribute to this process of the lifting of fear -- 
being able to reach out and touch the outside world with nothing happening to 
them," Gillette said. 
</P>
<P>
Television is also an increasingly important element. The western third of 
Czechoslovakia, for example, has long been able to view West German or Austrian 
newscasts, making them almost instantly aware of events outside the country no 
matter what Czechoslovak television does. But now Czechoslovaks living near the 
borders with East Germany, Poland and Hungary can see nearly as much on 
broadcasts from those nations as well. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, liberalized Soviet television beamed into East European living rooms 
has become a force for reform. That is particularly true of Bulgaria; in 
addition, before he was ousted Honecker had stopped circulation in East Germany 
of some Soviet publications that he found too full of glasnost, or openness, 
for his doctrinaire tastes. 
</P>
<P>
"Exhilarating and heartening though these street politics are," the London 
Times cautioned Tuesday, "it is nonetheless important to recognize the limits 
of what has so far been achieved." While free elections have been promised, for 
example, they are in all cases weeks or months away. 
</P>
<P>
East European experts agree, although they are generally optimistic. "In broad 
terms, the system has run out of steam," Schopflin said.

E. GERMANY READY TO TALK ABOUT FREE ELECTIONS 
</P>

<P>
East Germany's ruling Politburo on Wednesday proposed talks with opposition 
elements about free elections, saying such negotiations could deal with the 
organization of elections in which the party could be voted out of power. 
</P>
<P>
The Politburo also said it is willing to discuss changes to the 1949 
constitution, which enshrines the Communist Party's position as the major 
political force in the nation. Members did not propose a specific date for the 
talks, nor did they indicate which groups they were willing to bring into 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Communist Party, with more than 2 million members, there are 
four smaller political parties in East Germany. In the past, they had been 
considered mere satellites of the Communists, but since the recent political 
upheaval began they have been showing startling independence. 
</P>
<P>
But other non-party opposition groups have sprung up recently, notably New 
Forum, which now claims 200,000 followers. 
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency ADN, "The Politburo has proposed that the 
political parties united in the coalition government should convene a round 
table with other political forces." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal in many ways resembles similar ones in Poland and Hungary, which 
resulted in the ouster of the Communist Party as the sole political force. 
</P>
<P>
Manfred Gerlach, leader of the small Liberal Democratic Party, told a news 
conference Wednesday that his party is drafting an electoral law ensuring free 
elections at all levels, including the national Parliament. He said the new law 
should be put to a referendum, with the actual elections held late next year or 
early in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
East German leader Egon Krenz, who also heads the Communist Party, earlier had 
spoken of a dialogue with opposition groups, but he had not gone as far as 
offering formal negotiations, which was implicit in the Politburo announcement 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Moscow News on Wednesday, Krenz was quoted as suggesting 
that some of the ousted Communist Party leaders should be held to account for 
their abuses of power. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the complicated processes taking place in this country are 
concerned," Krenz said, "neither workers nor peasants nor civil servants are 
guilty. The responsibility for everything has been taken by the party -- 
specifically, by those who retired from the Politburo and the government. I 
advocate bringing to account those who are really guilty of the situation that 
has arisen." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a Defense Ministry announcement said East Germany will do 
away with military parades that were characterized by goose-stepping soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"Parades for self-glorification are not necessary," Defense Minister Theodor 
Hoffmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffmann said he planned to restructure the 172,000-member armed forces, 
reducing the number of border guards.

The Bush Administration on Wednesday virtually cut off the prospects for most 
Polish and Hungarian refugees in Western Europe to resettle in the United 
States any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
Citing "the democratic evolution" in those nations, the State Department said 
it will process no new applications by Polish and Hungarian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Further, officials said, about 19,000 of the 20,000 applications on file likely 
will be rejected, because, with a few exceptions, only refugees with strong 
family ties in the United States will be admitted. 
</P>
<P>
The 20,000 applicants are but a fraction of the Polish and Hungarian refugee 
population in West Europe.

HUD REFORMS CLEAR CONGRESS AFTER HEARINGS REVEAL ABUSES

Reacting to disclosures of political favoritism and other abuses at the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Ronald Reagan 
Administration, Congress gave quick approval to a series of HUD reforms just 
before adjourning early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush was expected to sign the bill, which was based in part on 
recommendations by HUD Secretary Jack Kemp. The measure had sailed through the 
House and Senate without opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Its approval came after five months of hearings by a House Government 
Operations subcommittee that exposed six-figure fees for well-known Republican 
consultants and former HUD officials during the eight-year tenure of former HUD 
Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation tightens HUD's discretion in making low-income housing grants 
and guarantees that future decisions on subsidy awards are made openly rather 
than by a secret procedure that allowed top HUD aides to reward political 
favorites. 
</P>
<P>
It also would prevent developers of housing for the poor from getting windfalls 
from tax credits in addition to rental subsidies, a form of "double-dipping" 
that was exposed during the congressional investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Other provisions would require appointment of a chief financial officer at HUD, 
a comptroller to protect agency funds and a new review board to impose 
sanctions on lenders who violate Federal Housing Administration rules. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Banking Committee, was 
the chief sponsor of the bill in the House, while Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) 
pushed it through the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Many other non-controversial bills received final approval in the pre-holiday 
adjournment rush of the 101st Congress, including a measure to designate Dec. 
10 through 16 as "National Drunk and Drugged Driving Awareness Week." The 
resolution was sent to Bush for his signature. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Norman Y. Mineta (D-San Jose), sponsor of the resolution, said its passage 
on Thanksgiving eve was timely. 
</P>
<P>
"As we enter the holiday season, we must all remember that drunk and drugged 
driving is responsible for 20,000 fatalities annually," Mineta said. "Everyone 
must work to reduce this carnage."

<P>
The repeal of the catastrophic care law will force millions of people to pay 
more for their supplemental medical insurance and impose a major new financial 
burden on state governments. 
</P>
<P>
Repeal will also bring bigger hospital bills to some of the sickest elderly, 
but provide substantial tax savings for senior citizens in higher income 
brackets. 
</P>
<P>
By abolishing the catastrophic provisions of Medicare, Congress decided to end 
the virtually unlimited days of hospital care now available to Medicare 
beneficiaries under which patients pay $560 for the first day and receive the 
next 364 days free. 
</P>
<P>
This benefit will continue for the 33 million Medicare beneficiaries until the 
end of the year. But on Jan. 1, Medicare returns to the old system. Under that 
plan, patients pay $592 for the first day in the hospital, nothing the next 59 
days, then $138 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than about 500,000 Medicare patients a year are hospitalized more than 60 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Congress' action Wednesday ends the controversial surtax that would have meant 
higher payments in April for the 40% of Medicare beneficiaries who pay federal 
income taxes. The surtax would have ranged from $22 to $800 a year for a single 
taxpayer, a maximum of $1,600 for a couple filing jointly. Those who have paid 
any part of the surtax will get a refund. 
</P>
<P>
The surtax sparked a nationwide wave of protest that culminated with the votes 
for repeal in Congress. Anger over the surtax overshadowed any enthusiasm among 
senior citizens for the largest expansion of health benefits since Medicare was 
created in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
The surtax was designed to provide two-thirds of the money needed to pay for 
the new benefits, which included a ceiling on out-of-pocket spending for doctor 
bills and Medicare coverage of prescription drugs. One-third of the money 
needed for the program was to come from a $4 monthly premium paid by all 
beneficiaries under the Medicare insurance program for doctor bills. 
</P>
<P>
The $4 catastrophic premium will be collected from Social Security checks for 
the last time in December. Next year, the total premium for Medicare coverage 
of doctor bills will be $29 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies will be raising their premiums in January for so-called 
Medi-gap insurance, which covers the bills Medicare does not pay. These 
companies had adjusted their premiums because, under the catastrophic law, 
Medicare would be paying some expenses previously covered by private insurance. 
With the catastrophic law eliminated, more of the burden of coverage shifts 
back to private insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Private insurance premiums in 1990 will rise by an estimated 15.4% because of 
the repeal of the catastrophic law, according to a recent study by the General 
Accounting Office. The average private insurance premium will go from $58.71 a 
month this year for Medi-gap coverage to $69.35 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The expenses of state governments will increase at least $500 million next year 
as more of the burden of providing health care for the poor shifts to the 
states. 
</P>
<P>
A separate federal program was started in October to provide economic security 
for the spouses of people in nursing homes. Instead of spending all but a tiny 
part of family income and assets for nursing home costs, the family member at 
home will be permitted to keep at least $768 a month from any earnings, 
pensions or other family income. Moreover, the spouse at home must be allowed 
to keep the first $12,000 of the family's assets and half of what remains, up 
to a maximum of $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
While the new federal law is a boon to elderly residents of most states, it 
represents a disadvantage to California couples whose assets are greater than 
$120,000. Currently, California law allows the spouse at home to keep half of 
all the assets held by the couple. California has an exemption from the new law 
until January. 
</P>
<P>
The states and the federal government share the costs of Medicaid (called 
Medi-Cal in California), a federal welfare program for the poor, which pays for 
nursing homes when families have exhausted their assets. 
</P>
<P>
But, because families are permitted under the new law to preserve more of their 
assets, state governments will be forced to contribute more to nursing home 
costs. State governments this year have shifted payments for large numbers of 
nursing home patients to the federal government under the catastrophic care 
law. Those payments now will shift back to state governments.

LOS ANGELES, N.Y. MDS FACE BIG CUTS IN MEDICARE FEES; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: CONGRESS DEVISES A FORMULA TO PAY BIG CITY DOCTORS LESS, RURAL DOCTORS 
MORE. THE PATTERN MAY BECOME STANDARD FOR ALL U.S. MEDICINE.

<P>
Doctors in Los Angeles and New York face big cuts in the fees they receive for 
Medicare patients, with surgeons expected to lose as much as 25% under a new 
fee system approved by Congress earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest change in physician payments since doctors stopped 
accepting pigs and chickens" said Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland), a key author of 
the new plan. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, big city doctors are reimbursed at a much higher rate than their 
rural counterparts. To reduce the gap, the plan substantially cuts fees for 
physicians in urban areas and large states, and greatly boosts fees for 
physicians practicing in rural regions and small states. 
</P>
<P>
Payments also will be cut drastically for such treatments as hip replacements, 
coronary artery bypass operations and cataract surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
The system will apply only to payments by the federal government under the 
Medicare program. However, private insurance companies usually adopt Medicare 
innovations and the new system could become the standard pattern for all 
American medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The new approach offers savings in out-of-pocket costs for people whose doctors 
now charge more than the Medicare fee schedule. Doctors currently are permitted 
to bill patients for the balance not covered by Medicare. Starting in 1991, 
however, doctors will not be permitted to charge more than 25% above the 
Medicare fee. The margin drops to 15% two years later. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors who violate the rules could be banned from participating in the 
Medicare program. 
</P>
<P>
The complex new payment system will be imposed during a five-year period 
beginning in 1992. The government is trying to change the way doctors deal with 
Medicare patients, putting more emphasis on preventive medicine and less on 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically surgery has been overvalued and diagnostic and primary care have 
taken it in the ear," said American Medical Assn. spokesman Ross Reuben. 
</P>
<P>
Government fee scales would be devised for 7,000 different categories, ranging 
from a basic office visit to the most complex surgery. The fees will have 
geographic adjustments, reflecting the varying costs of a medical practice, 
such as rent and salaries for nurses and other personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cost of medical practice is higher in Manhattan than Minneapolis, 
federal officials are convinced that the current price differentials are much 
too large. For example, a hip replacement in New York City costs $4,436, 
compared with $2,283 in Minneapolis. Under the new system, Medicare fees will 
fall in New York, and rise in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
The government is slicing up the payment pie in a different way, giving the 
medical profession the same total sum of money, but rearranging the slices. 
Surgeons, for example, will get smaller pieces, while internists receive larger 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
Geographically, too, there are winners and losers. Doctors in the Los Angeles 
and New York areas will suffer a cut of 14% in their Medicare fees, compared 
with the amounts they receive for the same work under the current rules. 
Surgeons are the biggest losers, suffering a 25% cut. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors in small metropolitan areas will receive a 3% increase, while rural 
doctors as a group will get increases of 12% to 14%.

STUDY CLEARS FILTERED COFFEE IN BREWING DEBATE; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: AMERICA'S CUP OF CHOICE DOES NOT RAISE LEVELS OF CHOLESTEROL IN THE 
BLOOD, DUTCH SCIENTISTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
If the decision to down a second cup of coffee is beginning to seem as 
treacherous to your health as scarfing a slab of well-marbled beef, take heart: 
Now comes word that filtered coffee, America's brew of choice, has no effect on 
levels of cholesterol in the blood. 
</P>
<P>
That is the conclusion of a team of Dutch researchers who compared the effects 
of filtered coffee and a European method of boiling coffee in a thermos. After 
nine weeks, filtered-coffee drinkers' cholesterol levels were unchanged. The 
boiled-coffee drinkers' levels had crept up 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely why that might be so remains a mystery, the researchers report today 
in the New England Journal of Medicine. But their finding is considered good 
news in the United States, a country where filtering, also known as "the drip 
method," is all the rage. 
</P>
<P>
These happy tidings for coffee lovers comes amid a welter of conflicting 
reports on the health hazards of everyone's favorite vice: Caffeine is bad; no, 
decaffeination is bad; no, it's the fats in coffee beans that are to blame; no, 
coffee isn't bad after all. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, researchers at Stanford University reported that decaf, not 
caf, raised so-called "bad cholesterol" levels in middle-aged men. The week 
before, another Dutch study presented in Houston implicated certain fatty 
compounds produced in boiling coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, there's a lot of evidence to suggest that coffee and 
cholesterol are linked in some fashion. But how they are linked is unclear," 
said Dr. Basil Rifkind, chief of lipid metabolism and atherogenesis at the 
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask me should people change their coffee-drinking habits, I don't think 
so, not yet," Rifkind said. "The usual Solomonic wisdom is that people 
shouldn't drink too much coffee in any case. . . . But I wouldn't go any 
further than that." 
</P>
<P>
About 52.5% of all Americans over age 10 drink coffee, according to the 
National Coffee Assn. Average consumption is 3 1/3 cups a day and the method of 
choice is filtering, said the association's George E. Boecklin, a 
five-cup-a-day man (filtered or freeze-dried). 
</P>
<P>
In Europe and Scandinavia, by contrast, many coffee drinkers boil their jo, 
pouring scalding water over roughly ground beans in a thermos. Such differences 
have left researchers wondering whether the brewing method might influence the 
effects of coffee on health. 
</P>
<P>
Early suggestions that coffee might be bad for the heart arose from long-term 
studies of heart disease among the general population. While people who 
experienced heart attacks seemed to drink more coffee than others, it was 
unclear whether the coffee was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the problem was some other bad habit of coffee drinkers -- say, smoking 
cigarettes or eating too much Danish pastry. But even when those factors were 
taken into account, researchers still detected links between heart disease and 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
They then went on to examine the cholesterol levels of people who said they had 
drunk a lot of coffee and people who said they had not. The results were 
conflicting. But several Scandinavian studies suggested a strong link between 
high cholesterol and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
To examine that finding more closely, Drs. Annette A. A. Bak and Diederick E. 
Grobbee of Erasmus University in Rotterdam studied 107 healthy young men and 
women. They were divided into three groups -- drinkers of filtered coffee, 
boiled coffee, no coffee. 
</P>
<P>
After nine weeks in which the coffee groups drank four to six cups a day, the 
researchers found no change in the cholesterol levels of the no-coffee and 
filtered-coffee groups. But they did find a 10% rise in the cholesterol levels 
of the boiled-coffee group. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, what increased was low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the 
so-called bad form of the fat-like substance, which can build up in the 
arteries. Narrowed arteries can lead to blockages which, in turn, can interrupt 
blood flow and cause a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
"In conclusion . . . our findings suggest that the consumption of filtered 
coffee does not affect serum lipid levels," the researchers wrote. "The 
consumption of boiled coffee, however, has a considerable effect in raising 
cholesterol levels." 
</P>
<P>
Coffee industry officials called the report a vindication of America's coffee 
habit. 
</P>
<P>
"We never advocate boiling coffee to begin with," sniffed Lawrence D. Hayes, 
president of the Specialty Coffee Assn. of America. "The specialty industry 
advises people to take their percolators and throw them out. Because that's the 
best way to boil coffee." 
</P>
<P>
The researchers speculated that the effect of boiled coffee on cholesterol 
might be traceable to "active substances" released during preparation. By 
leaving coffee grounds exposed to hot water for a longer time, boiling might 
pose a greater health risk. 
</P>
<P>
Another theory concerns the filter paper itself: If some active substance is to 
blame, perhaps it is absorbed by the paper or left behind by "selective 
filtering" because of the size of the particles, the researchers suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Because the precise way in which coffee influences cholesterol remains unclear, 
the researchers warned that their findings "may be relevant for the products of 
similar methods, such as percolated coffee, camp coffee and Turkish coffee." 
</P>
<P>
Other researchers said Wednesday that they were not surprised by the new 
findings but advised caution in their interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea LaCroix, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington who published 
a paper in 1986 linking heavy coffee consumption to coronary heart disease, 
emphasized that much remains to be learned about the risks that coffee poses 
for the human heart. 
</P>
<P>
In light of that ambiguity, and the conflicting reports surfacing in recent 
weeks, LaCroix urged that people not overestimate the influence of coffee on 
the heart. 
</P>
<P>
"If people are concerned about their risk of heart disease, there are 
well-known areas for making life style changes," LaCroix said. "Those include 
stopping smoking, making sure your blood pressure is within normal limits and 
likewise serum cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
"And if you still have energy after that, I would say the data are much more 
persuasive that increasing physical activity levels would be helpful, (rather) 
than changing your coffee consumption habits," LaCroix said.

AN IRREVERENT GAGE LEAVES L.A. CITY HALL AMID MIXED REVIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Half a year after Mike Gage strode into City Hall as deputy mayor, a routine 
meeting of mayoral aides turned sour in a tiff over the disbursement of several 
million dollars from the city's budget. 
</P>
<P>
Anton Calleia, a gray-haired, short and stocky senior assistant to Mayor Tom 
Bradley, jumped from his chair in anger, stalking toward Bradley's elegant 
suite. Gage, a decade younger and a rangy outdoorsman, followed in pursuit. At 
the doorway to Bradley's office, sources said, Gage caught up with Calleia, who 
threw a punch. 
</P>
<P>
The men fell to the floor, tussling, until the mayor's security guards broke 
them apart -- but not before the short-lived brawl found a place in Gage's 
legend. By all reports, the two men patched up their differences after the 
conflict two years ago, but Gage has continued to engender strong reactions 
from his staff of 120. 
</P>
<P>
Never unwilling to enter battle with those inside the mayor's office or outside 
it, Gage presided over some of the best and unarguably the worst days of 
Bradley's time at the city's helm. 
</P>
<P>
Gage, 44, departed the Bradley Administration on Wednesday the way he arrived 
-- an irreverent personality with barbed edges, alternately teary-eyed and 
bullishly bellowing at his enemies. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, some staffers in the mayor's office expressed relief about Gage's 
departure, saying his management style had turned increasingly confrontational 
in recent months, to the point that some senior officials had considered 
resigning. But others at City Hall -- including members of the City Council 
frequently at odds with Bradley -- praised Gage for goading the mayor to 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Ever the City Hall iconoclast, Gage showed up for his press conference 
Wednesday sporting a fuchsia tie imprinted with aqua flamingos, dangling it 
inches below his mismatched blue shirt, which was unbuttoned at the neck. Then 
he skewered himself, much as he had others during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
After Bradley lauded him as a "dynamic force" in the Administration, Gage gave 
himself mixed reviews for his handling of the controversies surrounding 
Bradley's financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
"I would give myself a pretty decent grade in terms of strategy, and I'd 
probably give myself an F in terms of PR," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The departure of the mercurial Gage, who on Dec. 1 will become the president 
and chief executive officer for a San Fernando Valley development firm, was one 
of several key management changes announced by Bradley Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mark D. Fabiani, most recently the mayor's legal counsel, will assume Gage's 
position as chief of staff and deputy mayor. Bradley also announced the 
involuntary resignation of Deputy Mayor Grace Davis, who will be replaced by 
newly appointed Airport Commissioner Diane Muniz Pasillas. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasillas-Davis swap drew some criticism from Davis' allies, who attended a 
press conference announcing the changes to show support for Davis. Bradley's 
liaison with the Latino community for 14 years, Davis said Wednesday that 
negotiations are under way to assure her a continuing position with the mayor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said the decision to replace Davis was his but did not explain it. 
</P>
<P>
Gage said his decision to leave after 2 1/2 years of directing the 
Administration came after developer Ted Stein offered him a job Nov. 1. He 
accepted two weeks later. Bradley was told of the decision while on a European 
trade trip from which he returned Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, his first full year as the mayor's primary political adviser, Gage was 
credited with infusing the mayor's office with a sense of activism that 
ultimately drove Bradley's chief rival, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, from the 
1989 mayoral contest. 
</P>
<P>
Gage particularly opened City Hall to environmental groups, who had been closed 
off from Bradley in previous years. Despite his occasional employment with 
developers, Gage has strong environmental credentials. 
</P>
<P>
Allies and adversaries said Gage was at his best when on the offensive. But as 
Bradley was caught in a succession of financial investigations beginning this 
spring, Gage turned sour, lambasting his colleagues and excoriating reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"He created the impression in the mayor's office and in City Hall and with the 
press and the public that the mayor was with it again," Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
"But . . . things have taken a negative turn for the mayor, and I guess it's 
taken its toll. Mike's probably burned out. I don't think Mike's had his heart 
in this place for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Changing jobs is not unusual for Gage, whose longest tenure anywhere since 1976 
was four years as a state assemblyman, representing Napa. His reason for 
leaving the Legislature in 1980 became legendary: to lead river-rafting tours. 
In 1982, Gage returned to politics, running Leo McCarthy's successful race for 
lieutenant governor. Three years later, he headed Bradley's mayoral campaign. 
</P>
<P>
As Bradley's troubles mounted this year, Gage grew increasingly tempestuous. He 
ordered a blackout of the Herald Examiner -- denying its reporters even the 
most routine materials -- in retaliation for its coverage of the Bradley 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
In a profanity-laced conversation this fall, he denounced The Times, saying he 
would call the Columbia Journalism Review to initiate a story criticizing the 
paper's coverage of Bradley's finances. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a sickness over there at The Times that I'm not sure why it exists 
when it comes to the mayor," he said. "You guys want to make him look as bad as 
you can. You've become the . . . bully." 
</P>
<P>
Several council members have said privately in recent months that while Gage 
did a masterful job of turning Bradley's reelection campaign around, he had 
ceased to be an asset to the mayor. They cited his inability to respond with 
anything but anger to questions about the mayor's finances and suggested a less 
combative posture would have served the mayor better. 
</P>
<P>
But others described Gage as a capable and intelligent chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Mike has been an outstanding deputy mayor," Councilwoman Joy Picus 
said. 
</P>
<P>
City Council President John Ferraro, who dealt with Gage frequently on a range 
of matters, gave him high marks. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike pulled him (Bradley) out of the doldrums and got him back perking on all 
cylinders until the scandal broke," Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
As the formal announcement of his departure was made, Gage appeared loose and 
joked with Bradley about his bad boy reputation. Then, when a questioner 
referred to the forced removal of Davis, he shifted moods and paced angrily 
beside the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Gage forcefully denied that Bradley's troubles -- and his resulting clashes -- 
were related to his departure and denied reports that the mayor's staff was 
split over his style. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm unaware of any infighting relative to my style," he said. "Let me tell 
you, everyone in this office knows I yell and pound the table . . ."

MEDFLY EFFORT PUT IN DOUBT, OFFICIALS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
ERADICATION: THE DISCOVERY OF MORE OF THE PESTS RAISES THE POSSIBILITY OF 
WIDESPREAD AERIAL INSECTICIDE SPRAYING.

<P>
Mediterranean fruit flies have been found in five additional Los Angeles County 
neighborhoods, officials reported Wednesday, prompting serious doubts about 
current eradication efforts and raising the prospect among top scientists of 
widespread aerial pesticide spraying in the San Gabriel Valley and East Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The leading member of the state's scientific advisory panel and Los Angeles 
Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy -- a staunch defender of the county's 
eradication efforts -- called for a reevaluation of the attack strategies being 
used against the fruit-destroying Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
"This certainly is a severe blow to our confidence in the system," said Roy 
Cunningham, the leading entomologist on the scientific panel that advises 
county and state officials on the Medfly. "This is a grievous sign that we have 
serious problems we did not realize." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the trapping of pregnant flies Monday in South Gate, Monrovia 
and Eagle Rock, at least one aerial spraying of malathion will be required the 
first week in December, Spaugy said. 
</P>
<P>
Two more male flies were found Tuesday in Pasadena and Elysian Park, but there 
are no immediate plans to spray those areas because male flies pose less of a 
threat than mated females, Spaugy said. However, he labeled the Elysian Park 
find "disturbing" because it is located in an area where officials were 
preparing to declare successful eradication of an infestation that began in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
The latest discoveries widen the area of infestation to a region stretching 
from the East San Fernando Valley through the San Gabriel Valley to the Orange 
County community of Brea. 
</P>
<P>
Officials will map out boundaries for new spray zones Monday, and there are 
indications that the new sector will be much larger than the previous eight 
spray zones. 
</P>
<P>
Since August, only portions of the region, ranging from 12 to 22 square miles, 
have been subjected to nighttime spraying of the pesticide malathion. State 
regulations call for spray zone boundaries to extend 4 1/2 miles in each 
direction from the sites where flies are found. 
</P>
<P>
But Cunningham said Wednesday that it is time to consider abandoning this 
protocol because "obviously something is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
"We are now coming closer to the time where we have to consider area-wide 
spraying," Cunningham said, suggesting that boundaries be extended beyond 4 1/2 
miles for wider "margins of safety." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe in hindsight it might have been wiser to overshoot," said Cunningham, 
who is regarded as the nation's leading Medfly expert and one of the authors of 
the existing state regulations. If adopted by the five-member advisory panel as 
well as top agricultural officials, his recommendations will mark an aggressive 
change in the tactics used to fight the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
Spaugy, who repeatedly has insisted that the infestations are under control, 
said he still believes that the outbreaks do not constitute a countywide 
infestation. However, Spaugy said he is "willing to listen to any reasonable 
recommendation" to stop the spread of the pest, which destroys more than 250 
varieties of produce. 
</P>
<P>
At a three-day meeting beginning Dec. 4, top state and county officials and the 
scientific panel will discuss exactly how to change strategies. 
</P>
<P>
"This has blown wide open now," said James Carey, a UC Davis entomologist and 
scientific panel member who believes that the entire Los Angeles Basin is 
facing a full-blown infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Resources are now stretched to their limits, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
An acute shortage of sterile Medflies, which are released to breed out of 
existence wild flies not killed by malathion, has increased reliance on 
pesticide applications to fight the growing number of infestations. 
</P>
<P>
Spraying around the new Eagle Rock, Monrovia and South Gate Medfly sites cannot 
take place until the week of Dec. 5, state agricultural officials said, because 
equipment and workers are already committed to three previously scheduled 
pesticide applications. 
</P>
<P>
Parts of the San Gabriel Valley will receive their second dose of the pesticide 
next Tuesday and Wednesday nights. On Thursday, the Orange County community of 
Brea will be sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
"Notifying residents is becoming a big problem," said Veda Federighi, a 
spokeswoman for the state Department of Food and Agriculture. "We have to print 
up more flyers and give people at least 24 hours notice." 
</P>
<P>
About 200 California Conservation Corps workers do not have the time to 
distribute more flyers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the new infestations comes one day after about 20 grower 
representatives met with Food and Agriculture Director Henry Voss. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Wednesday, Voss said the 12 Southern California 
infestations are "not out of control." He said he also believes that growers 
are concerned but approve of the eradication efforts to date. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Engler, executive director of the California Citrus Quality Council and 
former Los Angeles County agricultural commissioner, attended the meeting with 
Voss and said that he and others were "satisfied" with the state's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Since August, 178 Medflies have been trapped in Los Angeles County, and 132 
miles of largely residential neighborhoods have been sprayed with malathion.

METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE UNION WINS RULING BLOCKING NEW 
CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Long Beach police union Wednesday won a court order temporarily blocking 
city management from imposing the provisions of a new contract adopted by the 
City Council this week -- under protests from union officials. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Lennon, an attorney for the Long Beach Police Officers Assn., said 
Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs in Los Angeles granted the order pending a 
Dec. 14 hearing on the union's charges that the city is violating state labor 
law and the last police contract by imposing a new, one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
The city ended nearly nine months of negotiations with the 610-member police 
union by declaring an impasse Tuesday and adopting the city's more recent 
contract offer.

METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFFICIAL DEFENDS WORK OF CRITICIZED 
CONTRACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles County official has recommended against canceling a contract with 
a company that maintains and repairs county vehicles, despite complaints about 
shoddy service. 
</P>
<P>
"The performance of the contractor has dramatically improved," William F. 
Stewart, director of the county Internal Services Department, said in a report 
to the Board of Supervisors, which delayed a vote on the matter until Tuesday. 
"We believe that there is no justification for canceling the contract." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who proposed that the board consider canceling the 
$12-million annual contract with Holmes &amp; Narver Services Inc., expressed 
concern that the pact may end up costing the county more than when county 
mechanics serviced the fleet. Hahn said Tuesday that a member of the county 
grand jury plans to ask fellow jurors to look into the contract. A jury 
official refused comment.

HOME SIZE RAISES THE ROOF IN PALOS VERDES ESTATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jan Napolitan, a planning commissioner in Palos Verdes Estates, says she would 
be the first to agree that everyone deserves to have a decent roof over his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
But does a family of seven (10 if you count the hired help) really need a 
30,000-square-foot home with 16 toilets (20 if you count the pool house and 
servants' quarters)? 
</P>
<P>
Napolitan doesn't think so. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty thousand square feet is not a basic need," she says. "It is a basic 
want." 
</P>
<P>
Tongues are wagging, and a showdown appears to be brewing at City Hall over 
plans by wealthy businessman Tei-Fu Chen to build such a house on a bluff in 
Palos Verdes Estates. If Chen obtains city approval -- a public hearing on the 
project is scheduled for Dec. 5 -- the house would be by far the biggest ever 
built in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Chen, following in the heavily trodden path of other well-heeled Southern 
Californians, says he wants to start from scratch and build a home comfortable 
enough for his wife and five young children. 
</P>
<P>
To do that, Chen says he is prepared to tear down the 6,000-square-foot 
Mediterranean-style mansion already on the property. The six-bedroom house was 
once owned by former fitness queen Gloria Marshall and is still referred to by 
some locals as "Gloria's house." 
</P>
<P>
"I am a dreamer," said Chen, who owns a Torrance-based health and beauty 
products company and who paid $4.3 million for the property on Via Visalia in 
June. "This is our dream home." 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials and residents, however, contend that Chen's dream would be 
more of a nightmare for the community. In a city that prides itself on 
maintaining abundant open space and a rural ambience, a 30,000-square-foot home 
simply has no place, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe we should have homes of this size in our community," said 
Mayor Ruth Gralow, a council member for five years and, before that, a planning 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been serving this city for 10 years, and one of the reasons I have put 
in the time I have is because I want to see the place preserved." 
</P>
<P>
As in other Southern California neighborhoods where property values are 
soaring, most notably in Beverly Hills and the West Side, the issue of larger 
homes replacing smaller ones has been hotly debated in Palos Verdes Estates in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents are still sniffing over the construction several years ago of a 
sprawling estate on Via Visalia coincidentally next door to the Chen property. 
The 15,072-square-foot home, which resembles a European manor house, has been 
nicknamed the "Visalia Sheraton" by neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
To control the size of new homes and additions to existing ones, council 
members last year passed a law forbidding anyone to build a home that would 
cover more than 30% of the lot plus 1,000 square feet. Gralow, in early 
October, tried to go a step further and outlaw the construction of any new 
house in the city larger than 15,000 square feet, but she couldn't muster 
enough support among her council colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time the 30% rule was adopted, the council also approved a 
"neighborhood compatibility" ordinance requiring new or remodeled structures to 
be compatible with existing homes in terms of square footage and design. The 
ordinance also calls for building proposals to consider how the neighbors' 
views and privacy would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
City officials concede that Chen's proposed house easily conforms to the 30% 
rule because it would cover less than 18% of the 2.3-acre lot. Indeed, Chen 
says he believes his proposed structure is "quite a small house" given the lot 
size. 
</P>
<P>
But whether it conforms to the compatibility ordinance appears to be a 
debatable issue, and one that probably will be decided by the City Council, 
which must approve all building proposals. Although Chen's home would be at 
least 30% larger than any other home in the area, the lot it would sit on is 
far larger than any other. 
</P>
<P>
Such facts don't sway Napolitan. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think when the city was planned and the lots were planned that anyone 
ever thought a 30,000-square-foot building would be planted on one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Chen's architect, George Shaw, contends that the proposed house meets all the 
criteria outlined in the compatibility ordinance. None of the neighbors' views 
will be obstructed, and the house will be largely concealed by the existing 
landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone who has had the opportunity to have the project explained to them 
sees it is meeting the criteria of neighborhood compatibility and is not out of 
line," said Shaw, who has talked to residents about his client's house at 
previous public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Nan Harman, who with her husband, Reed, recently built a home next to Chen's 
property, said her neighbors are "mostly uncomfortable" with the idea of such a 
large house being built in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Although Harman said she would prefer not to see such a big home built, she 
said she is confident it would be done tastefully and have minimal impact on 
the area. She wouldn't divulge the size of her home but said it's less than 
12,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Arkenberg, who lives on the street where the Chen house is planned, said 
as long as Chen obeys the city's building codes, no one should prevent him from 
building the house. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I am concerned, it is going to be off by itself in a secluded area 
with other large homes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Chen, who moved to this country about 15 years ago from Taiwan, said he is 
puzzled by all the fuss his dream house has caused. Explaining why he wants 
such a large home, he said different people have different tastes and different 
ways of living. 
</P>
<P>
After all, he says, that's what this country is all about. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has the freedom to live the way they want to live."

TRAVELERS CRUNCHED BY HOLIDAY; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: WEATHER ADDS TO THANKSGIVING TRAVEL WOES IN SOME AREAS OF 
NATION. THOUSANDS SUFFER DELAYS AT L.A. AIRPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Passengers crowded Los Angeles International Airport and other airfields across 
the nation Wednesday evening as weather problems added to what had already been 
expected to be one of the worst holiday travel crunches on record. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of travelers trying to fly in or out of LAX were put on hold -- some 
for a few minutes, others for a few hours -- as some flights were delayed. 
</P>
<P>
By nightfall, automobile traffic around the airport was crawling, the airport's 
parking lots had started to overflow and the terminals were full, but the 
expected lines had yet to begin forming at terminal ticket counters, baggage 
carousels, restaurants, pay telephones and rest rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, it's not as bad as we thought it would be," said a clerk at an 
American Airlines reservations desk. 
</P>
<P>
Officials predicted that about 650,000 passengers would pass through the Los 
Angeles area's busiest airport during the four-day Thanksgiving weekend -- 
about 20,000 more than last year's all-time high. About 210,000 were expected 
just on Wednesday at Chicago's O'Hare, 50,000 more than normal. 
</P>
<P>
For some, the going was beginning to get tough by nightfall Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"My flight was supposed to leave 10 minutes ago," said Jeff Kurtzer, 22, a 
student at UC Santa Barbara, who was heading for a family reunion in Ft. 
Lauderdale and was worried about making a connection in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"My plane got in 20 minutes late," he said, gazing at the crowd gathering 
around the Delta Airlines boarding gate. "But (being Thanksgiving) I expected 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Fog in the Bay Area, the Sacramento Valley, Portland, Ore., and Salt Lake City 
and snow in the East and Midwest forced the cancellation of several flights 
Wednesday and prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to implement a 
nationwide air traffic quota system that caused delays of up to 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for United Airlines in Chicago, said the delays along 
the West Coast were expected to intensify during the night as low clouds and 
fog moved inland from the Pacific over airports in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
FAA spokeswoman Ellie Brekke in Los Angeles said low overcast over Orange 
County could affect some flights at John Wayne Airport before dawn today. 
</P>
<P>
While the weather did not directly affect planes landing at and taking off from 
LAX, some flights in and out of the airport were held up because of traffic 
backups at other airports. 
</P>
<P>
For most of those along the West Coast, it was too late to switch to the train. 
Amtrak reported that many of its trains were booked to capacity, with 
reservations on this weekend's Seattle-to-San Francisco and Seattle-to-Chicago 
runs sold out two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Highway traffic was expectedly heavy in the Los Angeles area Wednesday when, as 
usual, most locals used their cars to leave town for the holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really bad -- we have advisories for heavy traffic all over," Officer 
Jill Angel, a spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol, reported at 
sundown. 
</P>
<P>
"All the freeways are jammed," she said. "The San Bernardino Freeway is a mess, 
with everyone heading east, out of town. There's a major Sigalert where the 134 
(the Ventura Freeway) meets I-5 (the Golden State Freeway) because of an 
overturned big rig. There's just a tremendous increase in the volume of traffic 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
But the worst gridlock may have been in New York City, where more than a 
million cars -- 12% more than normal -- created an avalanche of traffic that 
officials say is becoming a Thanksgiving Eve ritual. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like lemmings marching to the sea," said Victor Ross, a spokesman for the 
New York Department of Transportation.

4 MORE MOLESTATION COUNTS FILED AGAINST CITY DAY CARE DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four additional child molestation counts were filed Wednesday against a van 
driver at a city-run day care center in Echo Park, bringing to eight the number 
of counts against the part-time worker. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Linda Reisz filed the additional charges against Charles 
Chavez, 33, of Los Angeles, after a 5-year-old boy and his 6-year-old sister, 
both of whom are enrolled in the child care program at the Echo Park Recreation 
Center, accused Chavez of fondling them through their clothing on several 
occasions over the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
Similar allegations were made against Chavez last month by two girls, ages 5 
and 10. Three other children accused another part-time worker, Simon Bermudez, 
37, also of Los Angeles, of either fondling them or urinating in their 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the earlier accusations, Chavez was arrested Oct. 18 and charged 
with four felony counts of lewd conduct with a child. He has pleaded innocent 
to the charges and is being held on $20,000 bail. No date has been set for his 
arraignment on the new counts. 
</P>
<P>
Bermudez was arrested, but later released. City attorneys have not decided 
whether to bring charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests, which became public last week, set off a storm of controversy 
after it was disclosed that neither man had undergone fingerprinting and 
background checks as required by state laws governing licensed day care 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Marlin Warkentin of the Police Department's Ramparts Division has said that 
such a check would have turned up a criminal record on Chavez that would have 
prevented him from legally working with children. Warkentin, however, would not 
disclose the details of that record. According to Councilwoman Gloria Molina, 
the man had been accused of lewd conduct with a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints from Molina and parents of children who attend the day care center 
prompted officials to order fingerprinting for 2,000 part-time city Recreation 
and Parks employees who work with children. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests also set off an investigation of the day care center by the state 
Department of Social Services, which this week was considering whether it 
should revoke the center's license or take some other administrative action. 
The department was poised to make a decision Monday, when it learned of the new 
accusations by the brother and sister. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Garcia, legal counsel for the Department of Social Services, said his 
investigation had also disclosed other irregularities at the center, including 
its failure to report the molestation allegations to the state within 24 hours 
as required by law, failure to segregate children from the public when they 
played in the park and failure to provide adequate bathroom facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said Wednesday that he and his supervisor were reviewing the case in 
light of the new counts against Garcia. It was likely, he said, that some 
administrative action would be taken, but no decision had been made by late 
Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez's preliminary court hearing on the original four counts is scheduled for 
next Wednesday. Reisz said that at that time she will ask that his bail be 
doubled.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pay and Ethics Package 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 252 to 174, the House approved legislation (HR 3660) raising the 
pay of members of Congress and tightening their ethics rules. The bill, which 
also hiked the pay of federal judges and high executive branch officials, was 
sent to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
House members and senators would receive a 7.9% cost-of-living increase on Jan. 
1 plus a cost-of-living hike of up to 5% and a 25% raise in January, 1991. This 
would raise their present $89,500 salary to about $125,000, up about 40%. 
Salaries of up to 834 top executive branch officials, including Cabinet members 
and 1,115 Supreme Court, appellate and district court judges, also would rise 
under the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Tightening congressional ethics, the bill prohibits lawmakers from keeping 
honorariums such as speaking fees, caps outside earned income at 15% of 
congressional pay, prohibits members from accepting gifts worth more than $200 
and stiffens certain travel rules. It repeals in 1993 the law under which House 
members elected before 1980 can convert campaign contributions to personal 
income when they leave Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the pay raise-ethics reform package.

Civil Rights Commission 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 278 to 135, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 3532) to renew 
the U.S. Civil Rights Commission for six months beyond its scheduled expiration 
on Nov. 30. Democratic sponsors said the time would be used to seek 
Congress-White House agreement on a major restructuring of the faltering 
agency. The commission has been a battleground between civil rights activists 
and congressional Democrats on one side and the Reagan and Bush administrations 
on the other. 
</P>
<P>
The bill shelved President Bush's plan to extend the agency for six years under 
new commissioners appointed by him and Congress. It also dealt the White House 
a defeat by transferring from the President to Capitol Hill the authority to 
appoint the commission's staff director. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to extend the life of the the U.S. Civil Rights 
Commission for six months as advocated by the civil rights lobby rather than 
six years as urged by President Bush.

To Fund Population Control 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 244 to 178, the House approved $15 million in American support of 
a United Nations program to slow global population growth. The payment to the 
U.N. Population Activities Fund could not be allocated to China, said by 
critics to have coercive abortion and sterilization policies, or spent anywhere 
on abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The vote occurred as the House approved the conference report on a foreign aid 
bill (HR 2939). It reversed a previous House stand against U.S. support of the 
fund, and put the House in agreement with the Senate that the $15 million 
should be sent to the U.N. However, the House then reversed itself again, 
approving an amendment by anti-abortion legislators that gives President Bush 
power to block release of the money. The Senate then refused to accept the new 
House conditions involving the President. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter John Porter (R-Ill.) said, "Human rights violations in China cannot 
be used as an excuse to cut off funding for voluntary family planning in . . . 
120 other countries." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Christopher Smith (R-N.J.) denounced "forced sterilization and forced 
abortion that have become commonplace in China's brutal one-child-per-couple 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted America to contribute $15 million to the U.N. 
Population Activities Fund.

CULVER CITY TEACHERS ACCEPT 7% PAY RAISE, STILL TRAIL L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Culver City teachers will get a 7% pay raise this year, but their new contract 
still leaves them behind other Westside and Los Angeles teachers in salary. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers ratified the one-year contract on a 137-88 vote Tuesday. It provides 
for increases in the school district's contributions to health plans, and it 
introduces a program of basic health coverage for future retirees. The Culver 
City Unified School District board, which has declared its support, will 
formally approve the agreement at its Dec. 5 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, salaries for beginning teachers will rise from $23,420 a 
year to $25,059. Teachers with 20 years' experience will see their pay go from 
$44,140 to $47,230. The average teacher's pay will rise from $36,221 to 
$38,756. 
</P>
<P>
The district will increase its contribution by 8% for teachers who are under a 
fee-for-service medical plan. But because the total costs will be higher, 
teachers will also have to pay more. Employee contributions for individual 
medical coverage will go up $9 a month, from $47 to $56, said Bess Doerr, 
president of the Culver City Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of a new state law that allows public employees previously not 
enrolled in the Social Security system to obtain Medicare coverage after they 
retire, the agreement gives teachers the option of paying 1.45% of their salary 
to qualify for Medicare. Teachers who enroll will have their contribution 
matched by the district. 
</P>
<P>
The district also agreed to pay $1,250 a year for each future retiree 65 and 
older to provide additional insurance to supplement Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
Previous labor contracts had no medical coverage at all for retired teachers 65 
and older. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, teachers rejected an earlier tentative agreement that provided a 6% 
pay increase. But the contract ratified this week provides an almost identical 
amount of money, said Ralph Villani, assistant superintendent in charge of 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The 7% pay hike in the approved contract was made retroactive only to Oct. 23. 
The 6% increase in the first agreement would have been retroactive to the 
beginning of the school year, said James Lively, the district's chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
Villani said the pay raise will also be funded from money saved by postponing 
the date teachers are allowed to enter Medicare -- from Jan. 1, in the original 
proposal, to July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Doerr called the contract solid and said teachers realized that the district 
has no more money to offer. She said the teachers also voted yes after seeing 
that Bevelry Hills teachers, after a two-week strike, got only a 5% guaranteed 
salary increase this year, plus a one-time bonus of 2% using money contributed 
by parents. 
</P>
<P>
But David Mielke, president of the Culver City Federation of Teachers, a rival 
of Doerr's union that was ousted as the bargaining representative in 1988, said 
the association had not fought hard enough. 
</P>
<P>
Mielke said the "collective frustration" that led teachers to reject the first 
agreement "could have been used and harnessed to get a much better settlement. 
The negotiating team worked hard to sell (the second agreement), and I guess 
the teachers bought it." 
</P>
<P>
He said "the fact that Beverly Hills teachers struck and got hammered" may have 
spurred some Culver City teachers to vote yes on the contract. "But we weren't 
talking about a strike . . . just about turning up the heat a couple of 
degrees." 
</P>
<P>
Another vocal critic of the contract was Howard Bennett, a veteran Culver City 
teacher who has campaigned for comprehensive lifetime health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"This contract is an insult," Bennett said, contending that any gain in buying 
power from the 7% raise will be negated by the increase in teacher 
contributions for health coverage, the later retroactive date for the pay 
increase, the postponement of the Medicare provision and increases in the cost 
of living. 
</P>
<P>
But Doerr said the contract became a source of dispute only because of the 
battling unions and other issues in the district. 
</P>
<P>
"Howard Bennett wants (a particular system of lifetime health benefits); Dave 
Mielke want to discredit CCTA," she said. "This is a good contract. Why 
wouldn't people vote for it?" 
</P>
<P>
Doerr and district officials agreed that the district, which has a 
$16.5-million budget, has no money for a sweeter deal for teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The new contract, which covers about 275 teachers, counselors, nurses and 
librarians, will cost the district about $665,442 this year, Villani said. 
</P>
<P>
The pay increases will still leave Culver City teachers behind Santa Monica, 
Los Angeles and Beverly Hills teachers in pay. But Villani said Culver City 
pays more than $5,200 a year per teacher in medical, dental and life insurance, 
more than Santa Monica and Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District pays about $4,000 a year in 
medical and dental benefits per teacher, according to Art Cohen, assistant 
superintendent for fiscal services. 
</P>
<P>
Villani said the Los Angeles Unified School District has higher salaries and 
better fringe benefits than Culver City because it is much bigger and rapidly 
growing in enrollment. "There's no way we can compete with their kind of 
income," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mielke of the rival teachers union predicted that the pay gap will cause Culver 
City teachers to defect to other districts. "Every day at lunch, teachers are 
asking for salary schedules around Los Angeles County," he said. "Three blocks 
away, a teacher is making $3,000 or $4,000 more." 
</P>
<P>
Doerr said two teachers have left for the higher salaries in Los Angeles this 
year. One, a bilingual teacher, is making $10,000 more than she did in Culver 
City, in part because Los Angeles gives bonuses to bilingual teachers. 
</P>
<P>
But Villani said four teachers from Los Angeles took pay cuts and came to 
Culver City "because Culver City is a nice place to work." 
</P>
<P>
"It's smaller," he said, "there's strong parent interest in our community, and 
we dont have the drug problems, gang problems . . . to the extent L.A. has."

Warren K. Funk sometimes jokes about arming his car with a double-barreled 
shotgun that could be rigged so it would fire on would-be thieves. 
</P>
<P>
Probably not a prudent idea, concedes Funk, the support services manager for 
the city of Monterey Park. But this is what goes through the head of a man who 
has had three cars stolen in just 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, a racy blue Toyota Celica, was even snatched from his reserved 
parking space right across from City Hall. The next morning, police found its 
hollowed chassis on a nearby street, stripped to bare metal, minus seats, 
doors, dashboard, sunroof and steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
"Going three for three is not a distinction I would particularly like to be 
known for," said Funk, a retired Air Force major who moved from Northern 
California to the San Gabriel Valley in 1987. "But I must admit the rapidity 
with which my cars have been latched onto is certainly something to make you 
shake your head at." 
</P>
<P>
Funk is not the only one shaking his head. Over the last five years, 15 San 
Gabriel Valley cities have experienced increases of more than 100% in their 
rates of auto theft -- making it the fastest growing crime in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually no city has been spared, from tiny Walnut, where the number of stolen 
cars has nearly quadrupled since 1984, to West Covina, whose 1,558 pilfered 
vehicles was tops in the San Gabriel Valley last year. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities where grand theft auto has more than doubled in the last five 
years include Azusa, Baldwin Park, Covina, Claremont, Duarte, El Monte, 
Glendora, La Puente, La Verne, Monterey Park, Rosemead, San Dimas and San 
Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, if you're leaving your car on the street overnight, you're taking 
your chances," said Monterey Park Police Detective Walt Osman. "It's fair 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Auto theft in the San Gabriel Valley as a whole has jumped 96% since 1984, from 
6,084 thefts to 11,896 in 1988 -- probably the most dramatic rate of increase 
in any region of Los Angeles County, according to FBI crime statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles, still the stolen car capital of the state with 62,709 
vehicles snatched last year, registered a modest 28% increase in that period. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have no ready answers to explain why the crime has soared so 
rapidly in the San Gabriel Valley, except to say that the jump has merely 
brought the area up to parity with the rest of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Growth and rapid immigration, the development of large shopping mall parking 
lots, and the increasingly lucrative used auto parts market all help to make 
the problem worse, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most of all, they added, the courts have been reluctant to throw 
juvenile auto thieves in jail when detention facilities are already full with 
hardened gang members, drive-by shooters and crack dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become a low-risk, high-profit crime," said Lt. Chuck Shipley, who heads 
the vehicle theft unit for the southern division of the California Highway 
Patrol. "You can go out and steal a $10,000 car . . . and there's a chance you 
might not even serve time." 
</P>
<P>
Take the nine Vietnamese teen-agers arrested by Monterey Park police last 
February after detectives observed them, clad in surgical gloves and wielding 
power tools, stripping two Toyota Celicas in the carport of an apartment 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
Police alleged that the youths were responsible for stealing at least 25 cars 
in the previous month, stripping them in their makeshift "chop shop" and 
dumping the empty hulls on neighborhood streets. 
</P>
<P>
But when Detective Wes Clair tried to get prosecutors to file charges against 
the nine, he said he was instructed to simply release the youths to the custody 
of their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, all of them were arrested again in Santa Ana for allegedly 
stealing four cars in one continuous spree. They each served about three months 
in juvenile detention facilities for the offenses, said Clair. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing," he said. "There's one 15-year-old kid who I've arrested seven 
times." 
</P>
<P>
A special directive issued by Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner last June urged his staff 
to seek maximum penalties in all auto theft cases, but prosecutors say the 
mostly juvenile offenders still frequently get off without doing time. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's overburdened," said Fred Kubik, head of the juvenile division in 
the Pasadena branch of the district attorney's office. "We view it as a serious 
crime, but, yes, they do get off too easily." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, police say, it would help if people would lock their cars. One of 
every five vehicles stolen has either a door unlocked or the keys left in the 
ignition, the CHP says. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-theft devices, such as alarms or locking bars that hook to the steering 
wheel, also serve as deterrents, officers say. But many motorists don't think 
of that until they've already been victimized. 
</P>
<P>
"People just figure it could never happen to them," said Don Schulz, assistant 
manager in Pasadena of Al and Ed's Autosound, which installs 20 to 25 alarm 
systems a week. "Very rarely will anyone come here unless they've already been 
ripped off or a friend has." 
</P>
<P>
If a thief wants your car, however, there's very little that will keep it from 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
An experienced practitioner can pop a lock with a screwdriver, yank out the 
ignition with a $1.59 slide hammer and have the car running within about 30 
seconds. Some detectives on surveillance jobs have timed the procedure at a 
smooth eight seconds flat. 
</P>
<P>
The favorite targets are Toyotas, police say, although Hondas, Mazdas, Nissans 
and Hyundais are snatched up at a fairly quick pace as well. In most cases, the 
thief is less interested in the vehicle than in the parts, which can often 
fetch as much as five times the value of the car itself, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a tremendous market for stolen parts," said Monrovia Police Chief 
Joseph Santoro. "And that market perpetuates itself." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the cars are stripped of only obvious items, such as stereos, 
speakers and other luxury accessories. But more sophisticated thieves have 
another trick, police say. 
</P>
<P>
They go to auctions where insurance companies sell the stripped chassis of 
stolen cars they have recovered. The thieves buy the chassis and outfit them 
with parts from other stolen cars of the same make, either to sell at a high 
profit or keep for themselves. The chassis, with its identification number, is 
thus purchased legitimately. The parts usually cannot be traced. 
</P>
<P>
"I found a Toyota Celica that was in brand new condition, like it was off the 
showroom floor," Clair said. "I ran the license number through the computer and 
it came back as a junk. For $2,000, they had a $20,000 car, and the car was 
legitimate." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Michels, a spokesman for Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., said Toyotas come 
equipped with "real neat little goodies," such as high quality stereos and 
comfortable seats, which make them popular targets for theft. 
</P>
<P>
But, Michels added, the company has begun taking measures to make the cars more 
theft resistant, such as designing new door locks and installing shrouds around 
the door frames that thwart thin metal lock-popping tools known as "slim jims." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a subject that really bothers us," said Michels, adding that there are 
more than 1 million Toyotas on the road in the Los Angeles area. "The only 
thing I can figure is that Toyota is a real well-known car . . . and there's a 
lot of them out there to steal." 
</P>
<P>
About two years ago, West Covina Detective Gary Christensen helped form the San 
Gabriel Valley Auto Theft Investigators Assn., a group of local police officers 
who meet four times a year to share information about suspects and strategies. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, many area police departments in recent years have created the 
position of a full-time auto theft investigator, a task that previously was 
shared by detectives who also had to handle forged checks and other fraud 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
But none of that is enough, officers say, if a youth can steal a car worth a 
year's wages and walk away with only his wrists slapped. 
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, transportation is your livelihood," Christensen said. "Yet nothing 
happens to these kids. They're back on the streets before we've even written 
the reports." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CAR THEFTS IN SAN GABRIEL VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
Over the last five years, 15 San Gabriel Valley cities have experienced more 
than 100% increases in their rates of auto theft, probably the sharpest jump of 
any region in Los Angeles County, according to FBI crime statistics. Although 
the raw numbers are still relatively low -- the 62,709 cars stolen in Los 
Angeles last year dwarf the 11,896 stolen in the entire San Gabriel Valley -- 
the impacts on individual communities have been dramatic.

HOLLYWOOD PATROL SEES GAINS AFTER YEAR OF FIGHTING DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day before the Hollywood Sentinels' first anniversary, members of the 
neighborhood patrol group let out a collective groan as they gathered before a 
back-alley wall freshly painted with looping, red gang graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Within seconds, several younger members of the Sentinels sprinted up the alley, 
unlocked a garage door and began dealing out paint rollers and buckets like 
supply sergeants at a military canteen. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, a broad white wall, a dumpster and a back door that had been the 
canvas for an outside gang bore the Sentinels' own signature: uneven smears of 
mismatched beige paint. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad the city only gives us one color," joked one member as the others 
backed off to watch the finishing touches. 
</P>
<P>
Satisfied with their work, the Sentinels dispersed up the alley, where they 
continued their joking, jostling and casual conversations on Hollywood 
Boulevard and back into the heart of the neighborhood around DeLongpre Park. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Sentinels are just one of many watch groups championed by police 
and the media in recent years, their year-old commitment to eradicating drug 
traffic in their neighborhood is notable for its tenacity. The occasional 
sighting of graffiti and the presence of a few abandoned houses used as 
"shooting galleries" and flophouses by addicts keeps the group patrolling four 
nights a week, down from nightly patrols a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the ease with which the Sentinels string out through the neighborhood 
indicates just how much difference the group has made in its first year. And, 
contradicting early critics who suggested that the group might fade back into 
its living rooms after a few months and that such work should be left to 
police, the Sentinels are expanding, finding new ways to improve the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course the initial goal was to get the drug dealers off the street. But we 
made a commitment to unifying the neighborhood," said Debbie Wiehbe, one of 20 
members of a spread out along DeLongpre Avenue last week. Wiehbe, principal of 
a local private elementary school, stopped briefly and pointed to a clean, 
brightly lit house. 
</P>
<P>
"This house was really scary. Really filthy. It was empty and used as a 
shooting gallery for drug users. We learned how to work with the Building and 
Safety Department to get these kinds of places either brought up to code or 
torn down," Wiehbe said. 
</P>
<P>
With much of the drug traffic gone -- group members acknowledge that their 
efforts have probably just pushed it into other areas -- the Hollywood 
Sentinels are branching out. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics of Neighborhood Watch and citizen enforcement programs say they 
rely too heavily on a "just say no" attitude toward drugs and crime without 
presenting alternatives. With the gradual improvement of the area around 
DeLongpre Park, the Sentinels say they are investing more time in creating 
alternatives for neighborhood youths. 
</P>
<P>
"We started a Boy Scout (and Girl Scout) troop when we realized that you can 
only spend so much time patrolling the streets," said Wiehbe's husband, Ferris, 
who is scoutmaster for Troop 200. "It gives (kids) leadership ability, and they 
learn to take charge. Now we have given them an Eagle Scout to look up to 
instead of a gang leader." 
</P>
<P>
Ferris Wiehbe has also involved local youths in self-defense classes and 
football teams. The Sentinels are negotiating with the Community Redevelopment 
Agency to plant trees, and neighbors have agreed to water them. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized that just getting the drugs out was not going to beautify the 
neighborhood," said Debbie Wiehbe. 
</P>
<P>
The new programs are a far cry from the first months of patrolling, when 
children were left at home. 
</P>
<P>
The group was created last year after 70-year-old Virginia Charon heard 
complaints from neighborhood children who had been threatened by drug dealers. 
Charon distributed handbills and asked neighbors to bring candles and children 
to a street-corner meeting. About 60 people marched through the streets Nov. 
18, demanding that drug dealers leave. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, my heart would pound in my chest every night," Debbie Wiehbe 
said. "I looked up at every building, wondering if somebody might shoot at us 
or drop something on our heads. It was not fun. It was a kind of warfare." 
</P>
<P>
After the first meeting, the group gradually gathered steam, and by New Year's 
Day, with support from police, businesses and even the Guardian Angels, it 
began nightly patrols. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, the group still draws about 15-20 people a night to casually walk 
the streets. One recent patrol included six children, a couple of senior 
citizens and several Spanish-speaking members of the neighborhood's substantial 
population of Latin American immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"This corner," Charon pointed out at the intersection of Las Palmas and 
Fountain avenues, "was the primary drug-selling area. It was frequently roped 
off by police. People were shot right here." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Sentinels began to hold regular meetings in the neighborhood 
earlier this year, they discovered that residents of the most battle-scarred 
areas would not venture out of their apartment buildings after dark. The group 
took its meetings on the road, visiting buildings in some of the worst areas. 
</P>
<P>
After a year of such interaction with their neighbors, the Sentinels are a 
known quantity to most of those they pass on the street. Passing the throaty 
bark of a dog at one house, members called out, "Be quiet, Gordo!" They waved 
to children on porches, calling them by their names, and jokingly accosted a 
shy, hand-holding couple leaning against an old car. 
</P>
<P>
"They look like gang members to me," shouted a Sentinel. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their disdain for outside gangs and their graffiti, the Sentinels 
realized that they would have to engineer some kind of peace with the local 
gang. 
</P>
<P>
Several young men outside a yellowing apartment building murmured half-hearted 
insults at the group as it passed, but they did so with a smile. Patrol members 
laughed and kept moving. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where a lot of the gang members live," said Debbie Wiehbe, stepping 
over beer bottles and an old mattress on the sidewalk. "Now the gang will step 
in and help us out of a sticky situation. We appreciate their willingness, but 
their tactics are different than ours." 
</P>
<P>
The Sentinels' large patrol area -- even on a quiet night, it takes the group 
more than two hours to make its rounds -- is quiet and clean. The group 
occasionally rousts transients sleeping in DeLongpre Park. Working with the 
city, it has succeeded in boarding up and fencing off empty houses where 
outsiders came to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
In its early months, the group made dozens of citizen's arrests that resulted 
in convictions, but now its tactics are decidely non-confrontational. As the 
patrol moved past a shopping area on Hollywood Boulevard, several members 
stayed behind on a street corner, watching three drunken men in a parking lot, 
before slowly moving on. The three men looked the group over, then shuffled a 
few feet farther down the block. 
</P>
<P>
The Sentinels say they have come to enjoy the patrols, which now seem to be 
social events as much as crime-fighting efforts. And as much as they value 
their victories, they say, it's the rapport they have developed with their 
neighbors that will keep them working in one way or another as long as they 
live in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"For many of us, we couldn't have left if we had wanted to, because of 
financial realities," Debbie Wiehbe said. "We have just come back to the basic 
idea that we don't want to abandon ship. It started to sink; now it is starting 
to float, and we want to see it continue to sail."

WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING MANAGER TO STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Culver City Housing Manager Phyllis Baboolal, offered a job in Hawthorne and a 
pay raise in Culver City to keep her, has decided to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Praising her work, the City Council three weeks ago gave Baboolal a raise of 
nearly 20%, from $4,354 to $5,210 a month, while she was one of two finalists 
for the job of housing director in Hawthorne. She was then offered the 
Hawthorne job, which would pay $66,000 a year, Baboolal said. The Culver City 
raise put her at $62,520. 
</P>
<P>
Baboolal, Culver City's housing manager for seven years, said, "Basically, I'm 
very happy here," adding that she appreciates the City Council's support of the 
city's housing programs. The pay increase was one factor in her decision to 
stay in the city, Baboolal said, because she has two children in college.

CITY HALL PACKING FOR MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Hall employees have begun packing up to move one mile down the road to 
temporary quarters. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 1, the city clerk, city attorney, Engineering Department, Planning 
Department and all other City Hall offices will be moved to portable buildings 
at 4095 Overland Ave. while a new city hall is built. Office telephone numbers 
will remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
The move and interim quarters will cost $2.8 million, said Debbie Rich, deputy 
director of redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
The $25-million building will occupy the sites of the present City Hall at 9770 
Culver Blvd. and the adjacent fire station and a few residential properties, 
Rich said. It is being paid for largely by city-issued bonds. The project is 
expected to take about four years. 
</P>
<P>
At 80,000 square feet, almost double the size of the existing City Hall, the 
new building will be large enough to accommodate the Housing Department, 
Redevelopment Agency and other offices that are now in other buildings. The old 
building, constructed in the 1920s, is too small and considered structurally 
and seismically unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
Three architectural firms, competing to design the building, will submit plans 
in February, Rich said.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: PACIFIC PALISADES; 
</P>
<P>
HEIGHT LIMIT IMPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the urging of a neighborhood group, the Los Angeles City Council has voted 
to restrict the height of new construction in a two-block-long stretch of 
Adelaide Drive between Ocean Avenue and Entrada Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ecstatic," said Lauren Greene of the Adelaide Residents Assn., which 
began pushing for the restriction three years ago after a property owner sought 
to build a home that neighbors said disrupted their views of the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
In an area of historically significant homes, the street -- which separates the 
Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles from Santa Monica -- is a favorite of 
tourists and others for its views of the ocean and the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The new law outlaws construction above street level for property owners on the 
sloping, Los Angeles side of Adelaide Drive, Greene said.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
CRITICS SKEWER FOOD PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some residents hoping to participate in a recently created city task force to 
deal with feeding West Hollywood's homeless population say the effort is 
veering in the wrong direction after only two meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those complaining are the same neighbors of the Greater West Hollywood 
Food Coalition feeding program in Plummer Park who in October persuaded the 
City Council to shut the program down because of reports of crime, 
intimidation, and unsanitary conditions at the site. After a flood of publicity 
and Hollywood celebrities surfaced to protest the decision, the council 
reinstated the program for four months and created the task force to oversee 
the future of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Now critics are saying the task force, which was to be made up of citizens, 
city staff and food coalition representatives, has been taken over by city 
staff and is unlikely to produce concrete results. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the city's direction, there will be no way to reach a conclusion. There 
is no accountability. . . . " said Plummer Park neighbor Ed Riney, who has been 
one of the most vocal opponents of the feeding program. 
</P>
<P>
Riney and others complained at a Monday meeting that the city has restricted 
discussion to finding an alternate site for the program and funding it. Riney 
said that approach ignores the nature of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's not push it out of the east end and on to someone else. Just throwing 
food at these people is not helping them," Riney said. 
</P>
<P>
Riney supports limiting voting members on the task force to city staff and 
citizens, with non-voting roles for homeless people and Hollywood stars 
interested in the effort.

AN ELK KEEPS AN EAGLE EYE ON THIS COURTROOM; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: THE CASE OF SOME HOMEOWNERS VERSUS A CONDO DEVELOPER IS BEING TRIED AT 
AN ELKS LODGE IN REDONDO BEACH. IT IS THE FIRST JURY TRIAL TO BE TRANSFERRED 
OUT OF TORRANCE SUPERIOR COURT AND INTO RENTED SPACE AS PART OF A PROGRAM TO 
REDUCE A BACKLOG OF CIVIL CASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The throne of the Exalted Ruler was empty. The Esteemed Leading Knight was 
nowhere to be found. And the rest of the brothers from the Benevolent and 
Protective Order of Elks, Lodge No. 1378 in Redondo Beach, were not to meet 
until Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
But, despite the pronounced absence of the native species, the Elks Lodge in 
Redondo Beach was alive with activity every workday this week. 
</P>
<P>
Holding forth in the lodge room for up to four months will be the judge, jury 
and combatants in a civil lawsuit. The case of the Manitoba West Owners Assn. 
versus developer Don S. Levin is the first jury trial to be transferred out of 
Torrance Superior Court into rented space as part of a program to cut the 
backlog of civil cases throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit, filed nearly six years ago, 187 members of the owners 
association maintain that their condominiums in the Manitoba West development 
in Playa del Rey have suffered serious damage because of shoddy construction. 
</P>
<P>
Condominium owner Sharon Rifelli took the stand Tuesday as the trial's first 
witness and said her home was repeatedly soaked with rainwater that seeped 
through a leaky ceiling. "Standing on the carpet, it was like a sponge that had 
not been wrung out," Rifelli said. "It was like a flood." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Levin and five subcontractors told the jury in their opening 
statements that construction of the condominiums in 1979 and 1980 was up to 
industry standards and that faulty maintenance, which is the province of the 
condominium association, explains many of the buildings' problems. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last four months. That's far too long to tie up a 
courtroom or one of Torrance's 11 sitting judges for a civil case. So they will 
pay the Elks $200 a day to use the lodge at 315 The Esplanade, next to the 
Redondo Beach Pier, to try this case. In addition, they have assigned it to 
retired Superior Court Judge George R. Perkovich Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no way they were going to try that case in the courthouse," said 
Arnold Pena, coordinator of Los Angeles County's civil Superior Courts. 
"Torrance doesn't have any courtrooms that are vacant, and they couldn't spare 
the space for that long." 
</P>
<P>
There are 460 civil cases set for trial in Torrance and 2,352 more waiting for 
a trial date. The average civil case takes 2 1/3 years to come to trial, though 
contentious cases can take much longer. 
</P>
<P>
Under the so-called "rent-a-judge" program, the county previously used rooms at 
the Torrance Marriott for hearings or non-jury trials. But the hotel could not 
assure court officials that they could get a room big enough for a lengthy jury 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Perkovich, a former member of the Inglewood and San Pedro Elks lodges, knew 
that lodge rooms are vacant during the day, so he called the Redondo Beach 
lodge and arranged the rental. 
</P>
<P>
On the first day of trial Tuesday in the incongruous setting, Perkovich forsook 
the green upholstered throne of the Exalted Ruler in favor of a well-worn 
leather swivel chair he had brought with him. 
</P>
<P>
Mounted on the wall above the judge's head is not the seal of the state of 
California but the head of a 12-point buck elk. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of four elk trophies in the room. Hanging from the ceiling is the 
Star of Fidelity -- one of Elkdom's ritual symbols -- alongside a large 
mirrored ball that provides ambience during ballroom dances. 
</P>
<P>
The surroundings will not be an obstacle to justice. "I can try them in a tent 
if I have to," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Minor modifications were made on the first day of trial. At the request of 
lawyers for the builders, spectators will not be able to sit in the seats 
across from the jury. Perkovich agreed that the reactions of spectators could 
distract or affect jurors. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also ordered during breaks that jurors remain in the Exalted Ruler's 
office, which has been converted to a jury room. "I've got to run this at least 
halfway like a courtroom," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Manitoba West homeowners said they would have preferred a 
traditional courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it here," said Gail Browning. "It's makeshift. It takes away from 
the seriousness of the case. It's like having a play on a basketball court." 
</P>
<P>
Another homeowner complained that spectators seats along one wall are too far 
away from the judge and witnesses. "We're just staring across at a blank wall," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a case with at least $15 million in damages at stake, it will take more than 
a few stuffed elk heads to distract a dozen lawyers from their arguments. 
</P>

"As long as the jury is able to take the proceedings seriously, despite the 
surroundings, it's fine," said John Wallace, an attorney for one subcontractor. 
"I think they will."

PEPPERDINE TANKERS WILL FACE LONG BEACH IN NCAA OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pepperdine and Cal State Long Beach water polo teams will meet for the 
fourth time this season, this time in the first round of the NCAA tournament 
Friday at Indiana University in Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine (23-6) is seeded fourth in the tournament and Long Beach (18-8) 
fifth. Other first-round Friday matches are top-seeded California (24-3) 
against No. 8 Brown (18-9), No. 2 UC Irvine (24-6) against No. 7 
Arkansas-Little Rock (19-2) and No. 3 Stanford (26-7) against No. 6 UC San 
Diego (20-12). 
</P>
<P>
The tournament continues through Saturday and ends with Sunday's championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves, Irvine and the 49ers finished in a three-way tie for first place in 
the Big West Conference, each at 8-2. Last week Pepperdine lost to Long Beach, 
15-12. Earlier, the Waves defeated the 49ers, 11-9 and 12-6. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine Coach Terry Schroeder said his team's defense last week against Long 
Beach "was poor. Long Beach came out and scored the first four goals of the 
game, and we never really recovered." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said that several teams "have an excellent chance of winning the NCAA 
title. Whoever plays the best defense this weekend will leave with the national 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
Big West Conference coaches named Pepperdine sophomore Geoffrey Clark the 
conference player of the year and selected Schroeder as the league's coach of 
the year. Clark and senior teammate Sasa Poljak were named to the 
all-conference first team, Pepperdine junior Paul Matarangas made the second 
team, and Wave senior Rob Sutter received honorable mention. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA women's volleyball team, ranked first nationally and 26-1 overall, 
will end the regular season in the University of the Pacific/Wendy's tournament 
on Friday and Saturday at Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
Last week sophomore middle blocker Elaine Youngs was sidelined with a knee 
injury, but junior Samantha Shaver stepped in for Youngs and led the Bruins to 
victories over USC and Louisiana State. Shaver had 22 kills and hit .429 in the 
two matches. 
</P>
<P>
The All-Western State Conference women's volleyball team includes Santa Monica 
College sophomore setter-outside hitter Brigette McDonald and West Los Angeles 
College freshman middle blockers-outside hitters Margaret Williamson and Lorrie 
Vellutato. 
</P>
<P>
Second-team selections include SMC freshman middle blockers Tanja Elliott and 
Stacy Pierce. Honorable mention went to Corsair freshmen Julie Foster, a middle 
blocker, and Heather Perini, an outside hitter. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA women's basketball team, 12-16 overall and fourth in the Pacific 10 
Conference last year, will open its season when it plays host to Eastern 
Illinois (16-12) at 7 p.m. Friday at Pauley Pavilion. The Bruins will entertain 
West Virginia (24-8) at 2 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA lost an exhibition game to the Spanish national team, 63-55, last week. 
Sophomore center Molly Tideback led the Bruins with 11 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica College men's basketball team (3-1 as the week began) will 
play host to Los Angeles Trade Tech at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at Corsair Gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
The Corsairs finished second at last week's Compton College tournament, losing 
the championship game to Compton, 75-72. SMC posted tournament wins over Los 
Angeles Harbor, 92-89, and Los Angeles City, 88-87. 
</P>
<P>
SMC freshman guard Donald Smith was named to the all-tournament team. Smith 
scored 60 points in the three games, 29 against Compton, and had 19 rebounds. 
He shot 56% (19 of 34) from the floor and 55% (five of nine) from three-point 
range. 
</P>
<P>
The West Los Angeles College men's basketball team (2-3 at the start of the 
week) lost twice last week in the Fullerton College tournament. The Oilers were 
defeated by El Camino, 94-69, and by Grossmont, 108-93. WLAC's Anthony Gates 
scored 34 points in the two games and had 10 rebounds against Grossmont. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica College women's basketball team (2-0) will play host to Los 
Angeles Trade Tech at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at Corsair Gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Corsairs opened the season with road wins over Compton, 72-51, 
and Antelope Valley, 65-46. Sophomore forward Jackie Nikzad scored 22 points 
against Compton and had 23 points, including six of eight on three-pointers, 
and a career-high 14 rebounds against Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Palisades girls tennis team (7-0) will play Taft (6-1) in the Los Angeles 
City 4-A team final at 1 p.m. Tuesday at the Racquet Centre in Universal City. 
In the semifinals, Taft defeated Fairfax and Palisades beat Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica College football team ended the season with a 44-13 victory 
over West Los Angeles College last week. The Corsairs finished with a 5-5 
record; WLAC was 0-10. 
</P>
<P>
SMC sophomore tailback Charles McKinzie gained 137 yards on 12 carries and 
finished the season with 1,161 yards rushing. McKinzie's season total is second 
in school history to that of Deon Thomas, who had 1,219 yards last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepperdine women's golf team finished ninth with a total of 995 at the U.S. 
International tournament last week. Texas Christian was first at 936. Wave 
senior Peggy Kelly shot 238 for 54 holes to finish ninth among individuals. 
</P>

JUNIOR COLLEGES: FAST FOOD-LIKE COACHING; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: AS SOON AS COACHES STUFF THE PLAYERS WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPORT, 
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Coaching athletes at a junior college is a little like running a fast-food 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Once you get the customers in and stuff them (with hamburgers or knowledge of a 
sport), you've got to start thinking about getting them out again. 
</P>
<P>
Having only two years to mold basketball players capable of playing later at a 
four-year college is sometimes a frustrating task for coaches Charles Sands of 
West Los Angeles College and John McMullen of Santa Monica College. But both 
usually rise above those frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
Sands and McMullen have been doing business on the same corners for many years. 
Sands is in his 20th year at WLAC, the only basketball coach the school has 
had, and McMullen is in his 12th season at Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen's stand is in the high-rent district and caters to the best of 
junior-college bound players. McMullen's teams have won two straight Western 
State Conference championships and have advanced to the quarterfinals of the 
state playoffs both years. 
</P>
<P>
Sands has always done business out of his hat at WLAC, which has never had its 
own gymnasium and plays home games at Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Culver 
City. Some of his players were not high school stars, some had not played prep 
basketball, and with that sort of personnel, Sands' Oilers have never won a 
conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen and Sands turn out players good enough to make the grade at four-year 
colleges, though McMullen may produce more than Sands. 
</P>
<P>
Three players from last year's 32-4 SMC are on the rosters of four-year 
schools: Keith Amerson at Kansas State, Troy Batiste at San Jose State and Von 
Shuler at Chapman College. 
</P>
<P>
Sands' proteges are more apt to have experiences similar to those of LaVar Ball 
or Rodney Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Ball, a 6-foot 4-inch, 225-pound former football star at Canoga Park High 
School, was recruited from WLAC by Washington State, an NCAA Division I school. 
But he didn't play much for the Cougars, left Pullman and is now at Cal State 
Los Angeles, a Division II school. 
</P>
<P>
At the recent Fresno-Pacific tournament, Ball started at center and finished 
with 17 rebounds and 15 points as Cal State defeated Grand Canyon College, 
90-78. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, a muscular, 6-4 high-post man for WLAC years ago, went on to play at 
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. He also found his level in a Division II program. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen and Sands have more freshmen than sophomores on their teams this year, 
and both therefore are doing a lot of teaching, something they regard as 
fundamental to junior college coaching. 
</P>
<P>
The only returning Corsairs are Mark Moton, a part-time starter last season, 
and front-court reserves Chris Cook and Marc Schrobilgin. Sophomore Oilers are 
Anthony Gates, a 6-3 All-Western State Conference selection who plays the high 
post; forward Sean Guthrie and guard David Hollaway, a Crenshaw High School 
graduate who spent his freshman year at San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
The sophomores who spent their freshmen years at the local junior colleges are 
well schooled in the methods of Sands and McMullen, and both coaches admit they 
would like to keep their second-year men another year. But junior colleges 
don't have third-year students. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get them playing (the way) I like them to play, they go on and play for 
somebody else," said McMullen, but he added: 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, my attitude is that I coach for the fun of it. It's fun to see guys 
develop and improve. I help them in the transition between high school and the 
university, and I enjoy the teaching aspect. The games are very competitive 
with a very high level of talent; most of the teams we play against have two or 
three Division I-caliber players." 
</P>
<P>
Sands said that it "usually takes a year in our program to develop the basic, 
fundamental skills. I work extremely hard on the basics." 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our players come with good basketball ability and most of my 
sophomores are ready to play basketball. I always say it would be nice to have 
them for one more year because some never played or weren't really ready to 
compete in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have a solid teaching and patient entry program. I'm real demanding 
about (players) being at practice and being on time. (Having the players learn 
to follow) directions is more important to me than developing an offense. 
</P>
<P>
"What I normally tell the players when we first meet is that they need to give 
me permission to coach them because that's the only way for them to get better. 
I receive their parents' permission to parent them, then they receive the 
benefits. I may not be as loving as the parents, but I'm just as demanding." 
</P>
<P>
Though junior college coaches must do plenty of teaching with their freshmen, 
McMullen's teaching load has eased a bit in recent years because of the kinds 
of newcomers he's been getting. Four freshmen on this year's team are from 
Crenshaw High School, defending Division I state champion and a perennial power 
under Coach Willie West. Five of last year's SMC sophomores were also from 
Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen said that his Crenshaw connection has been his assistant coach, Hayes 
Pullard, whose son DeShawn graduated from Crenshaw and was a star guard for the 
Corsairs last year. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen said that his players from Crenshaw have had "a tremendous winner's 
attitude. They know they can't win without a good work ethic. They are 
confident and determined. They don't like to lose, but they win with class, 
which has really been helpful. 
</P>
<P>
"This year's bunch, as young as they care, have come in with the attitude, 
'Let's help Santa Monica College win.' They worked hard in preseason 
conditioning and drills. It's a step up in intensity in games, and they are 
willing to do that because they know it lets them have some fun in games." 
</P>
<P>
Sands and McMullen say they are content with their jobs, even though they 
sometimes run into problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The only frustration I have is that we don't have an on-campus gym," Sands 
said, "but we handle that without too much of a problem." He said that his 
players have had to learn to practice at local high school gyms or on outdoor 
courts but that they have come to like Sands' letterhead that says: 
</P>
<P>
"West Los Angeles College basketball is any place, any time, any condition." 
</P>
<P>
Sands may have to get a new letterhead in 1991. The passage of Proposition 13 
and the resulting loss of tax funds have kept plans for a WLAC gymnasium on 
hold, but Sands said that Linda Thor, the school's president, has told him that 
"we will have a gym in the fall of 1991." 
</P>
<P>
"If we have a nice facility, I think we can really have a super program," he 
said. "It would make a big difference with the athlete who is a basketball 
player. Sometimes we have basketball players who are not athletes." 
</P>
<P>
But Sands has no regrets that he has not had a powerhouse program. "If winning 
was the only thing I was looking for in a basketball program, then I would not 
be in coaching," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen said that in his first six years at SMC he "felt a lot of frustration 
because I was not understanding the limitations (of a junior college program)." 
</P>
<P>
"Now I realize what we can accomplish. The past two years have put me in a 
pretty good mood with back-to-back conference championships. I see our players 
go on and continue to play (at a high level), and I haven't had to be too 
frustrated the last couple of years.

LOYOLA BASKETBALL COACH SEES A BIG YEAR FOR WOMEN; OPENER SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN LINDSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Todd Corman hopes this season will prove that his Loyola Marymount University 
women's basketball team has finally arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Corman is entering his fifth season as coach of the Lady Lions with what he 
says is the best team he has coached at the college level. Four of last 
season's five starters are among eight returning players. 
</P>
<P>
"The team itself has thoughts that they will be better than last year," Corman 
said. "That's the best attitude to have." 
</P>
<P>
Last season the Lions had their best year ever, going 17-11 overall and 9-5 in 
the West Coast Conference. It was good enough for third place in the league. 
</P>
<P>
The season opener will be at home Nov. 25 against Eastern Illinois University 
at 5:15, preceding the men's 7:30 home opener. 
</P>
<P>
The toughest conference competition Corman says they will face will be from St. 
Mary's, the University of San Diego and Gonzaga. St. Mary's was tabbed the 
preseason favorite by WCC coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"We are also taking on a lot of tough teams back East, and I think that will 
make us tougher in conference because we will be playing consistently good 
teams all season," Corman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Fatigue will be the big factor. It's a long season and it's going to take a 
team effort to do well." 
</P>
<P>
The overall record (40-74) that Corman has posted in four years is not 
impressive, but it does show an improvement every year. In 1985-86 the team was 
3-25; 1986-87 it improved to 5-23; the breakthrough year came in 1987-88 at 
15-15 and improved again last year to 17-11. 
</P>
<P>
"Stability is what I have brought to the program," Corman said. "My philosophy 
is pretty much the same as when I started the program, and that lets the 
players know what I expect from them." 
</P>
<P>
Kristen Bruich and Tricia Gibson may be slow to start the season after knee 
surgery and long rehabilitation over the off season. Corman expects them to be 
in top condition by mid-season. 
</P>
<P>
Corman said defense has been the key to the turnaround he and assistant Cynthia 
Pereira-Atencio have engineered. Gibson, a 6-foot-3 junior center, led the 
conference with 39 blocked shots and had 135 rebounds last season. She was 
second on the team with 29 steals. She also did her part on offense, averaging 
9.7 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
Bruich, the emotional leader of the Lions, led the team with 71 steals and 943 
minutes of play. The 5-foot-8 junior point guard was second in scoring with an 
average of 10.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest loss is Regan O'Hara, who completed her eligibility. O'Hara led the 
team with 195 rebounds and was second with 50 steals. She averaged 9.7 points 
and led the team in free throws by converting 107 of 144. 
</P>
<P>
"Regan was the leader on the floor. It's going to be real tough to replace 
that," Corman said. "There may be some who are better physically than Regan, 
but experience isn't something you can teach. She understood my playing 
concepts better than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Bettencourt, a 6-foot senior forward/center, was second in rebounds 
with 174 and blocked shots with 16. 
</P>
<P>
The scoring leader for Loyola is Lynn Flanagan, a 5-foot-8 junior guard who had 
11.2 points per game last season and converted 63 of 88 free-throw attempts. 
Coming on strong in conference play, she scored in double figures in 19 of 28 
games and got her career high of 21 against St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
Also seeing playing time will be senior Chris Hagemann, sophomores Jamie Jesko, 
Nicole Taylor and Joelle Longobardi and freshmen Joell Coltrane and Trish 
McDonough. Corman prefers to play most of his roster and not build around one 
or two stars. 
</P>
<P>
"How well we play is going to depend on us controlling the tempo of the game, 
and that's the job of the defense," Corman said. "We don't have one really 
dominating player, but they're all very consistent and over the course of a 
season that alone is going to win games."

ADMINISTRATORS SEEK RENEWAL OF SPORTSMANSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new ritual popped up late this season at Palmdale High: As players charged 
onto the field before a football game, they were greeted by Principal Linda 
Janzen, who flashed them the victory sign while wearing jersey No. 78. 
</P>
<P>
The ritual represented more than school spirit. It was created by Janzen after 
three players were charged with misdemeanor battery in connection with an 
on-field attack of two game officials during a game against Saugus High on Oct. 
20. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted the victory sign to be a symbol from now on," she said. "I told the 
players and the student body that one side of the V would stand for the score 
on the scoreboard, but the other side would stand for self-discipline and 
control." 
</P>
<P>
It took "an ugly incident," she said, to wake her up to what has become a 
growing problem in high school sports all over the country: a disregard for 
fair play and sportsmanship by players, coaches, students and parents. 
</P>
<P>
At the National Federation of State Assns. convention in Tampa last summer, 
"The theme was 'Speak Out for Sportsmanship,' " said Tom Jacobson, principal at 
Corona del Mar High and president of the Southern Section Council. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a general feeling throughout the country among principals, athletic 
directors and coaches that we need to renew our commitment to good 
sportsmanship," Jacobson said. "The days are long gone when an opposing player 
can shoot a free throw in silence -- now it's bedlam in the gym -- and there 
are 100 tales along those lines. 
</P>
<P>
"Fights, open cheating, recruiting of athletes. We as educators have a job to 
do to get things back in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Things were certainly off kilter this season. In the Southern Section, the 
Palmdale incident, says Southern Section football administrator Bill Clark, 
"was the absolutely worst we had this season," but it was by no means the only 
major one. A St. Genevieve High player and assistant coach were suspended for 
their role in a brawl that was precipitated by an unsportsmanlike conduct 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"The severity of the incidents is up this year," Clark said. The number of 
incidents, he added, is down, which might be explained by the fact that game 
officials were asked before the season to tighten up the behavior of players 
and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Football players have been making headlines off the field, too. Five Hart High 
players allegedly abducted a 17-year-old girl and then abandoned her in a 
canyon, and a North Hollywood High player was arrested on suspicion of assault 
with a deadly weapon after he allegedly went to a Grant High practice and fired 
seven rounds into the air as revenge for a fight that had taken place at a 
party. 
</P>
<P>
But are these incidents merely unrelated, isolated aberrations or symptoms of a 
larger problem? "If sportsmanship has deteriorated, then all this is a 
reflection of that and is not a fluke," said Karl Bergenstal, a sports 
psychologist in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
Unsportsmanlike conduct hasn't been limited to football at the high school 
level. Five years ago, soccer was put on probation by the Southern Section 
because of a high number of fights and ejections, and "we've considered putting 
other sports on probation," Jacobson said. "Baseball is a big concern. So is 
basketball. But so far we've let the individual leagues deal with the problems 
in those sports." 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, it may be naive to think that high school sports could remain the pure 
essence of the athletic experience, with clean-cut players and pink-cheeked 
cheerleaders innocent of the ways of the world. The emphasis that American 
society places on success, say most educators, has had a corrupting influence 
on young athletes.

"The win-at-all-costs attitude seems to be prevalent and we've gotten away from 
the goal of athletics, which is to teach ethics and values," said Morris (Mo) 
Freedman, football coach at Camp Kilpatrick, a Los Angeles County probation 
facility that uses sports as a positive force in the lives of juvenile 
delinquents. 
</P>
<P>
Bergenstal, who specializes in sports psychology for young children, has a 
similar outlook. "There's too much pressure to win, especially at a young age," 
he said. "The emphasis should be placed on maximum performance and the joy in 
that, not on beating the opponent." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, "Research shows that when we get too competitive and focused 
on winning, we tend to get too aroused -- agitated and anxious -- and our 
performance deteriorates." 
</P>
<P>
San Jose State sports psychologist Thomas Tutko believes that today's powerful 
emphasis on winning has made game officials easy scapegoats for players. "When 
things are not going well, we get frustrated," he said, "and we find an agent 
to take it out on. Instead of looking inward to find the problem and admitting 
that maybe you screwed up, today's generation finds the nearest authority 
figure to blame it on. It is more acceptable today to attack the rules and 
authority instead of blaming yourself." 
</P>
<P>
In college football, winning has become a financial imperative: A successful 
team brings in megabucks, which in turn drives the entire athletic program. 
While the dollar amounts are much less in high school football, it's still 
football gate receipts that provide "80-90% of the revenue for the school's 
entire athletic program," Jacobson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would agree that winning is not the purpose of playing," he added, "but 
there is pressure to win." 
</P>
<P>
Nice guys supposedly finish last. Would a school principal tolerate a loser? 
"Yes I would," said Palmdale's Janzen. "I'd prefer to lose and maintain good 
sportsmanship." 
</P>
<P>
Not so for Yvonne Healey, Antelope Valley High principal. "Winning is great," 
she said. "It makes you feel good. But I think you can emphasize winning in a 
gentlemanly manner." 
</P>
<P>
But sportsmanship has suffered, she says, because television and movies have 
portrayed violence as a way to settle differences, "so things that used to 
shock us don't anymore. We have just become more accepting of violence in 
society." 
</P>
<P>
Tutko, who is writing a book on the breakdown of self-control among athletes 
and sports fans, doesn't think high school sports can survive through the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"Not at the rate we're going," he said. "Unless school systems are able to show 
that it is a great and productive experience for kids, I would abolish high 
school sports. What we're teaching our kids today through sports is basically 
unhealthy. Beating up sports officials is the best example of that. That is a 
terrible thing to teach our kids. 
</P>
<P>
"After all, what is our educational system for? It is to prepare people to deal 
with real life. And if beating up officials and authority figures is what 
sports is now teaching them, then it's time to reevaluate the whole system. 
</P>
<P>
"If kids attack referees and umpires, and if the school administrators then 
make excuses for the kids, then we no longer have any morality. And when 
society no longer has morality, then there is no society anymore." 
</P>
<P>
But who should be held accountable if a player belts a referee? The player? His 
coach? His parents? The school principal? Where does the buck stop? Freedman 
thinks that overzealous coaches often "transmit their personality to the team," 
he said. "I hold them responsible." 
</P>
<P>
But Rudy Trujillo, the principal at St. Genevieve, believes "the administration 
is ultimately responsible for the quality and integrity of their staff." 
</P>
<P>
At many schools, the administration is only peripherally involved with the 
sports teams, seldom monitoring their coaches to see what is being taught. 
</P>
<P>
At Palmdale, Janzen didn't really pay close attention to sports until after the 
incident involving the game officials, but she vows to stay on top of the 
action from now on. 
</P>
<P>
"The players gave me jersey No. 78" -- a defensive number -- "because I'm 
tackling the situation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Ray Monti, principal at Quartz Hill High, believes that a lot has to be 
done. "Maybe we need to step back as educators and take a look at the real 
meaning of high school athletics," he said. "The whole idea of sportsmanship, 
fair play and participation for the sake of participating needs to be 
reemphasized area-wide." 
</P>
<P>
After soccer was put on probation, officials held league meetings to stress 
sportsmanship, "and within a year, there were dramatic results," Jacobson said. 
Education in all sports is a key, he added, "but there is no magic program. It 
begins with the coach taking a stand with his kids, with the principal 
requiring that attention be given to sportsmanship, with parents and booster 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us."

TORMENT OF OFFICIALS TAKES A PHYSICAL TURN

<P>
Several years ago, during a high school football game in Tennessee, the father 
of a player ran onto the field and attacked the referee, knocking him to the 
ground with one punch and then turning his face into a bloody mess with several 
more punches. 
</P>
<P>
More recently in Tennessee, high school sports officials have been shot at 
during games and have suffered broken bones during attacks by players and fans. 
</P>
<P>
Surely such things couldn't happen in a place such as the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Surely the same people who have learned to live with larynx-constricting, 
eye-burning, yellow and brown air by simply referring to it as haze aren't 
going to lose their minds over children's games. 
</P>
<P>
Well, don't tell that to Brad Woolley of Van Nuys. He might have believed that 
before Palmdale High's Darius Wilson lifted him off of his feet during a 
football game this season, slammed him into the dirt and then pounced on him. 
But today, he knows better. 
</P>
<P>
And don't talk to softball umpire Bryan Rodgers about laid-back L. A., not 
after he was laid back a year ago by a bat-swinging player who attacked him and 
put him in the hospital because of a call he made against the man's city league 
slow-pitch softball team. 
</P>
<P>
And please don't waste your breath on a 37-year-old football official from San 
Fernando who was attacked and beaten last year by the brother of a player 
during a Pop Warner game involving teams of 13-year-old kids. The 15-year 
veteran of sports officiating is so afraid of violent reprisals that he 
demanded his name not be used in this story. 
</P>
<P>
A new age has dawned in sports, an age where Pete Rose can physically provoke 
an umpire and get only a mild suspension. An age where the goons of the NHL can 
send an official crashing down onto the ice during a brawl and get punished 
with a five-minute rest period, guilty of "roughing" or "unsportsmanlike 
conduct." An age where Billy Martin spits in the face of an umpire and then 
buries the umpire's shoes in dirt during an hysterical tantrum and is 
disciplined by being sent to his room for the remaining innings of that 
particular game. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids notice these things in a big way," said Thomas Tutko, a sports 
psychologist at San Jose State University who is completing a book on the 
breakdown of self-control among athletes and sports fans. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids watch Pete Rose bumping an umpire, and Pete Rose is a sports idol to 
kids, and the kids immediately think, 'If he can do it, it's OK if I do it.' 
Pete Rose and Billy Martin and some others have heavily affected our youth." 
</P>
<P>
The incident involving the Palmdale football team illustrated the problem. 
Woolley, a former soccer player at the University of New Mexico, has been 
officiating in that sport, football, basketball, baseball and volleyball for 14 
years. During the game on the night of Oct. 20, witnesses said he became the 
target of harsh remarks from a disorderly Palmdale bench. 
</P>
<P>
Woolley responded by calling consecutive 15-yard penalties on the Palmdale 
bench for unsportsmanlike conduct. 
</P>
<P>
After the second one, Wilson, an 18-year-old defensive back who the team's 
coach described as a "model student," charged Woolley and hammered him to the 
ground. He then took at least one punch at Woolley before he could be pulled 
away. 
</P>
<P>
The incident triggered a wild free-for-all with the players on Palmdale's 
sideline and some people sitting in the Palmdale spectator section charging 
onto the field. Moments after Woolley was attacked, a second official, Mike 
Davis, was attacked by Palmdale player Mike Warren, officials alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, Warren and 16-year-old Keith Bennett have been charged with misdemeanor 
battery. All three were suspended from school following the attacks and all 
could face up to six months in jail if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my back turned and I heard him say, 'I'm going to kill you, I'm going to 
kill you,' " Woolley said. "The next thing I knew, I had my head on the ground 
and he was punching me." 
</P>
<P>
Woolley said he is pursuing civil action against Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"I just believe that something should be done," he said. "This can't happen 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Woolley, who said he plans to continue officiating, and all 
other sports officials, it could happen again, however. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems, and the causes of the problems, are going to get much worse 
before they get better," Tutko said. "As long as we tolerate that type of abuse 
of authority, kids will get a clear message that it is OK. This problem is 
going to get much more severe before there is any improvement." 
</P>
<P>
The attack of an official during the Pop Warner football game would suggest 
that Tutko's assessment is an accurate one. Children who are exposed to such 
violence by the age of 13 are much more likely, Tutko said, to develop a strong 
belief that it is practiced by adults and therefore is acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
The official from San Fernando who was involved in that attack and who wished 
to remain anonymous said the incident began when two 13-year-old teammates 
began punching each other after an argument in the team's huddle. 
</P>
<P>
"These two kids actually began punching each other," the official said. 
"Teammates. Really pounding each other. I run over and break it up and start 
leading one of the players towards his sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, the older brother of the kid I was taking away charged out of 
the stands and attacked me. He went crazy and started punching me." 
</P>
<P>
The official said the attack left him with a back injury, as well as scrapes 
and bruises. He said he will continue officiating, but a bit more cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever life in general becomes, it crosses over into athletics," he said. 
"Parents have less control over their kids today, and there is a gap there. The 
respect for authority has diminished, and it has carried over very directly 
onto the athletic field." 
</P>
<P>
Tutko said even a subtle thing, such as the National Football League's use of 
instant replays to overrule their officials, illustrates the trend to question 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not accept anymore that the sports official might make a mistake," he 
said. "We now officially question his authority with TV cameras. 
</P>
<P>
"But authority represents the core of all sports. If we attack that core, as we 
have done, then we are getting way beyond just playing a game and into an area 
of incredible narcissism." 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers, the official attacked during a softball game, is only 21. He has been 
officiating sports since the age of 17. But in just four years, he has seen the 
problems up close. In addition to being attacked with a bat, he was also in the 
middle of a wild brawl during a basketball game last year between Notre Dame 
High and Bellarmine-Jefferson that involved players, fans and parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Sports have lost perspective," he said. "There is so much emphasis on winning. 
And all too often the violence that develops is directed at the officials. 
Parents should not be running onto the court or the field to fight. Ever. Under 
any circumstances. For any reason." 
</P>
<P>
Rolfe Rahl, a sports official in the Valley for 32 years and also the longtime 
football coach at Taft High, has also seen the problem up close. 
</P>
<P>
"Several years ago I was working a basketball game at North Hollywood and a 
fight breaks out," he said. "I see an older guy down on the court, choking a 
player. Hands around his throat, choking him. So I dive in and pull this guy 
off, and it turns out he's a cop. He lost control. 
</P>
<P>
"Another time, in a football game, the players from one team are swearing 
wildly. Real severe swearing. So I call timeout and am preparing to tell their 
coach about the problem. As I get to the sideline, he's got his offensive line 
in a huddle and he's telling them, 'Now go out there and kill those 
(expletives).' I figured right away that talking to him about his kids swearing 
wasn't going to solve anything." 
</P>
<P>
And Rahl says there is a simple way to eliminate part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how you can control crazy parents or fans," he said, "but a good 
coach can control his players. Every coach should, before the first game of the 
season, tell his players this: 'If you walk across that sideline to enter a 
fight, or if you throw a punch at anyone, you will never play again.' I don't 
think coaches tell their players that today."

2 THOUSAND OAKS ATHLETES HIT THEIR STRIDE IN LONG DISTANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Nosco and Scott Willis have been eagerly planning their Thanksgiving 
weekend trip to Hawaii, but their agenda doesn't include indulging in turkey 
and an afternoon in front of the television watching football. 
</P>
<P>
Their itinerary: 
</P>
<P>
 Day 1: Fly to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Day 2: Swim six miles. Ride bicycles 60 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Day 3: Ride bicycles 172 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Day 4: Run 52.4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Day 5: Return home, sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 The flight home will no doubt be a restful one for Nosco and Willis, Thousand 
Oaks roommates who measure athletic success in hours and miles rather than 
meters and minutes. 
</P>
<P>
For them, an Ironman triathlon (2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, 26.2-mile 
run) isn't a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
They would rather double the distance, or run 100 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a feeling of anxiety there," Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because you don't know if you're going to finish. You might doubt yourself, 
but deep down you keep saying, 'I know I'll make it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The three-day Hawaii ultra-triathlon is one of several ultra-distance races 
that have been scheduled in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
On Labor Day weekend, they competed in a double triathlon in Huntsville, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Nosco finished 14th out of 46 with a time of 27 hours, 30 minutes. Willis was 
22nd in 30 hours, 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
One of their recent excursions was the Angeles Crest 100-mile run. They ran on 
a winding, rocky path from Wrightwood to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever someone can dream up, Jack and I will say, 'Yeah, we can do that,' " 
Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
They'll try just about any distance, over any surface, in any conditions. They 
speak of running a 50-mile race in a downpour and 100-degree heat as if it were 
an early-morning jog through the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a little different than the average runner," said Willis, an aerospace 
engineer. "We could care less about conditions. We just run through them and 
see how we do it." 
</P>
<P>
Willis and Nosco, both 27, have a variety of reasons for trying these 
distances, money not being one of them. 
</P>
<P>
A T-shirt or a silver belt buckle is usually the only reward in ultra-distance 
events, which have yet to lure the corporate sponsorship and interest of 
biathlons and triathlons. 
</P>
<P>
Competing can be expensive. A local bike shop donates parts and other 
equipment, but Nosco and Willis pay for their own shoes, gas, entry fees and 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Entry fees can be as much as $200. 
</P>
<P>
Nosco, a fireman, and Willis have run nearly a dozen 50-mile races and four 
100-milers in the past three years. Willis has finished every race. Nosco has 
dropped out of two 100-milers because of swollen feet. 
</P>
<P>
Their injury list is short, but painful -- swollen feet, lost toenails and sore 
muscles are most common. "People say that when I'm 35 my knees will go and I'll 
start paying for doing this," Nosco said. 
</P>
<P>
"But they don't realize that most of the people doing these (distances) are 35 
to 55 years old. It's almost like people don't want to accept these distances." 
</P>
<P>
Willis said he burns about 1,000 calories in an hour of racing and has lost up 
to 10 pounds when competing. 
</P>
<P>
He and Nosco eat and drink a variety of foods, some nutritious, some not, 
during a race. 
</P>
<P>
"We eat a lot of cookies and candy bars to get a lot of sugar early in the 
race," Nosco said. 
</P>
<P>
"You get kind of sick of that food. We even tried baby food." 
</P>
<P>
Their biggest concern is to keep nutrient and energy levels at proper levels. 
Parents and girlfriends supply them with food, sodas, split times and 
encouragement. "I think our family and friends are into it as much as we are," 
Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Willis nor Nosco had much interest in running when they were young. 
</P>
<P>
They played football at Newbury Park High -- Nosco was a tight end and 
defensive end, Willis a guard and linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
"I hated running in high school," Nosco said. "The furthest I had run in high 
school was the 40-yard dash, or maybe a lap if I got in trouble in football 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
But Nosco started running at age 20 in an attempt to stay in shape. He also 
swam and rode his bike, eventually working up to the triathlon distance. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later he bought a condominium with Willis, and convinced his roommate 
to start training with him. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran in a 10-miler in 1986 and Scott was really sucking wind," Nosco said. 
"But one month later we ran the San Diego marathon." 
</P>
<P>
Both finished, and they tried a 50-mile race a few months later. 
</P>
<P>
And they've been running ever since.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS WITH MARKET ECONOMICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even the most casual student of the economy soon discovers the Iron Law of 
Diminishing Economists: If you lay all the economists in the world end to end, 
you'll never reach a conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
This sad, but true, observation means that economics has all the predictive 
validity of a fortune cookie -- You will soon meet a mysterious interest rate 
-- but with none of the redeeming entertainment value. As sciences go, 
economics is more a method to explain the world than a tool to shape it. 
</P>
<P>
"Economists have yet to prove they can do anything useful," acknowledges Vernon 
Smith, an economics professor at the University of Arizona. "We think that 
usefulness can come out of a lab." 
</P>
<P>
Smith is a father of experimental economics -- a rapidly growing research sect 
that applies the scientific method to economic theory. At Arizona, the 
California Institute of Technology and a score of other universities, 
researchers have built laboratories to test basic assumptions about how people 
actually behave in market environments. 
</P>
<P>
Experimental economists observe budding Ivan F. Boeskys conducting insider 
trading over International Business Machine PC network simulations of Wall 
Street. They watch speculative market bubbles burst on screen. They can see how 
-- and why -- people respond to price changes and bid in auctions. These 
electronic markets are wind tunnels for the real world. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at people as if they were greedy, perceptive, bright and willing to 
behave strategically seems to be the way to go," says Caltech Prof. Charles 
Plott, another pioneer in the field. 
</P>
<P>
What's so exciting isn't that this research confirms basic economic axioms, 
it's that it offers the potential that we will be able to intelligently design 
and engineer better markets. Just as knowledge of molecular biology enables us 
to splice genes to create new organisms, a fundamental grasp of economic 
behavior may let us splice market mechanisms into organizations to make them 
more efficient, more effective and more humane. 
</P>
<P>
What do we really want our markets to look like? Genteel auction houses like 
Sotheby's? The rabid commodity pits of Chicago? A Marrakech bazaar? A 
home-based, personal computer-mediated, bid-ask hookup with Sears? Nordstrom's? 
Combine new technology with experimental economics insights and we can redefine 
what markets mean as surely as did the invention of money. 
</P>
<P>
"These newly designed processes might not resemble classic markets," says 
Caltech's Plott. By testing these market concepts in advance, "We can eliminate 
the multibillion-regulatory-dollar faux pas." Instead of just being the point 
where supply and demand intersect, price can become something else. 
</P>
<P>
The ability to engineer and test market mechanisms will change how goods are 
bought and sold; how the Pentagon procures weapons systems; how state and 
federal regulations are promulgated, and how companies are managed. 
</P>
<P>
"This approach combines the coordination advantages of centralization with the 
information advantages of decentralization," asserts Arizona's Smith. In other 
words, markets can be engineered to be both responsible and responsive. 
</P>
<P>
The government has already taken a cut at injecting market mechanisms into 
regulatory practices. Airlines can now bid for airport slots. The Environmental 
Protection Agency wants to auction off pollution rights to industry. 
</P>
<P>
"There's definitely a trend in that," says Michael E. Levine, dean of Yale 
University's School of Management, who worked with former Civil Aeronautics 
Board Chairman Alfred E. Kahn during airline deregulation. "Regulators are 
increasingly using games and markets as a substitute for regulatory edict." 
</P>
<P>
But these are crude first efforts. If experimental economics lives up to its 
promise, we are going to see pretested, carefully designed market mechanisms 
injected into all manner of economic systems. Arizona's Smith is exploring how 
to design regulations that might make stock trading less volatile. Caltech's 
Plott is working with natural gas pipeline companies to optimize scheduling 
over their huge networks. Scientists at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center are 
using software "agents" to bid for and allocate scarce computer time. Wherever 
flexibility in resource allocation is desirable, market design is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"Optimization requires an exchange of information," says William S. Perrell, a 
senior vice president at Marketel International. "Efficient markets require 
two-way information flows. The change from mono-directional information (posted 
price) markets to bi-directional information markets will be as fundamental as 
the change from the telegraph to the telephone." 
</P>
<P>
Using sophisticated software, Marketel wants to redesign the travel market. The 
San Francisco-based company plans to create an "electronic auction" for airline 
seats. Instead of relying on posted airline ticket prices, Marketel would 
encourage passengers to bid for their seats and similarly encourage the 
airlines to bid for passengers. The idea is to use the electronic market to 
strike a better balance between the airlines's desire to fill planes and the 
customer's desire for reasonable fares at reasonable times. 
</P>
<P>
"Current mono-directional systems don't capture consumer preferences," says 
Perrell. "We make markets that are driven by transactions that could not occur 
in a mono-directional information society." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, unwieldy corporate bureaucracies are destined to be re-engineered by 
market mechanisms that touch everything from the budgeting process to 
compensation structure. Instead of simply submitting budgets and salaries for 
review, resources may increasingly be allocated by auction and Marketel-like 
systems software. 
</P>
<P>
"Most organizations have an internal suspicion of market mechanisms," says 
Yale's Levine. But he believes that carefully crafted market mechanisms could 
eventually have a major impact on corporate governance. The managers of the 
Exxons and General Electrics will increasingly find themselves competing in 
internal as well as external markets. 
</P>
<P>
The raw material for market engineering will likely come from experimental 
economics. "Experimental economics offers an extremely important source of new 
information," asserts Stanford's Kenneth Arrow, a Nobel laureate in economics. 
"It provides insights into the way markets work that we just can't get through 
theory. But this still hasn't penetrated the mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
But as government and industry struggle to cope with increased complexity and 
diminishing resources, it's inevitable that this next decade will see a bull 
market in the design and engineering of markets.

MEMO CONTRADICTS WALL'S STATEMENTS ON LINCOLN; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: AN AIDE WARNED ALMOST A YEAR BEFORE THE S&amp;L WENT UNDER THAT THE 
BANK BOARD'S EFFORTS TO CONTROL IT WOULD BE HOPELESS.

<TEXT>
<P>
A key federal regulator warned top government officials nearly a year before 
the collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan that their efforts to control the 
Irvine thrift would prove to be a "fiasco," according to an internal memo 
obtained by congressional investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The memo appears to contradict recent statements by M. Danny Wall, the nation's 
top savings and loan regulator, that his Washington staff was unanimous in its 
support of efforts to contain the mounting problems at Lincoln -- efforts that 
critics now characterize as hopelessly inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
The high-flying thrift finally was seized by the government last April 14 and 
the estimated $2 billion cost of making good on its taxpayer-insured deposits 
would make it the most expensive thrift failure on record. 
</P>
<P>
Wall heads the Office of Thrift Supervision, the successor agency to the 
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and is battling to retain his position under 
heavy criticism from Congress. President Bush has indicated that Wall will be 
asked to resign if it is proven that regulators were partly to blame for the 
savings and loan crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The previously undisclosed memo from Kevin O'Connell, a bank board supervisory 
agent in charge of Lincoln, is among a number of documents obtained recently by 
the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the documents provide new evidence that Washington regulators were 
divided in 1987 and 1988 over how to deal with growing evidence of alleged 
fraud and mismanagement by Lincoln's owner, Charles H. Keating Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Critics claim that the Washington officials could have prevented Lincoln's 
collapse if they had followed a recommendation by regional regulators in San 
Francisco to seize the Orange County thrift in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of taking control of Lincoln at that time, the Washington regulators 
negotiated a "memorandum of understanding" with Lincoln in which the thrift 
promised to refrain from certain practices opposed by the government. 
</P>
<P>
According to O'Connell's May 24, 1988, memo, the young bank board official had 
warned his superiors four days earlier that the memorandum of understanding 
they were signing with Lincoln on that day was "a fiasco." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell said in the document that the memorandum of understanding would 
permit the thrift to argue that it had resolved many legal issues with the 
board that were, in fact, not resolved by their negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell also indicated that the wording of the agreement was improper because 
it could be used by Lincoln to impede ongoing investigations by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
He said that regulators had learned only one day before signing the agreement 
that the Justice Department was pursuing an investigation of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, just four days after the agreement was signed, Lincoln told the New 
York Times that the agreement had precluded any government effort to force the 
thrift to take almost $150 million in losses on questionable loans. The loans 
were at issue in the SEC investigation of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell said in his memo that Lincoln's public statements were "adding 
credence" to his judgment that the memorandum of understanding was a disaster 
for the bank board. 
</P>
<P>
The memo appears to support the assertion of SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden 
last week that the bank board knowingly undercut his agency's investigation of 
Lincoln by agreeing to the 1988 memorandum of understanding. Wall has denied 
Breeden's contention. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell, whose father, Bill, was an official of the U.S. League of Savings 
Institutions, was eventually relieved of his role in the Lincoln case after the 
thrift accused him of "a clear conflict of interest." The charge was based on 
criticism of Keating by O'Connell's father. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony before the House committee Tuesday, Wall defended the 
memorandum of understanding on grounds that it opened the way for a team of 
examiners to study Lincoln's books and that examination eventually led to 
stronger government action against the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
The documents obtained by the Banking Committee include other material that 
appears to contradict Wall's claim that his advisers were unanimously opposed 
to taking tougher action against Lincoln in 1987 and 1988. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
* The report of a "peer review team" that visited the offices of the San 
Francisco regional regulators in early 1988. It concluded: "It seems imperative 
that someone intercede . . . to immediately stop unsafe and unsound practices 
and to provide for close and constant monitoring of Lincoln." 
</P>
<P>
* A memo written in July, 1987, by William L. Robertson, director of the bank 
board's office of regulatory policy, oversight and supervision, citing Lincoln 
with 19 separate violations of federal thrift regulations. 
</P>
<P>
* A memo written in February, 1988, by Darrel W. Dochow, whom Wall appointed to 
assume Robertson's duties, estimating that Lincoln would be posting losses no 
later than 1990. He also said his office had been unable to identify any 
"hostile" act by the San Francisco regulators against Lincoln, as Keating had 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Wall contends that his failure to act sooner against Lincoln had nothing to do 
with pressure from Keating or members of Congress who had received sizable 
campaign contributions from Keating and his associates. Wall and Keating met 
privately three times while the board was investigating Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Five members of the Senate -- Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), 
Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John H. Glenn Jr. (D-Ohio) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. 
(D-Mich.) -- are being investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee for their 
efforts on behalf of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Documents obtained by the House committee demonstrate that Keating was not only 
dogged in his efforts to influence regulators, he also had a flair for the 
dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be bankrupted," he declared in one telephone conversation, 
according to Wall's handwritten notes. And again, when Keating called for an 
appointment with Wall in early 1988 to discuss the sale of Lincoln, the 
regulator made a note that the flamboyant businessman wanted to discuss the 
"culmination of my life -- maybe my fortune." 
</P>
<P>
KEATING'S POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS:Lincoln's owner, his family and his business 
empire donated almost $350,000 to political campaigns over a two-year period.

ASHLAND TO PAY $4.7 MILLION IN SPILL; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE FUNDS WILL GO TO PENNSYLVANIA FOR THE NATION'S WORST INLAND 
OIL SPILL. TO DATE, THE FIRM HAS SAID IT WOULD PAY MORE THAN $32.5 MILLION TO 
SETTLE ALL CLAIMS. 
</P>

<P>
Ashland Oil agreed Wednesday to pay a record $4.7 million to Pennsylvania in 
civil penalties and other costs arising from the nation's worst inland oil 
spill, in a settlement that could affect other states facing similar cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
The money will cover about $660,000 in direct cleanup costs already incurred in 
the 1988 spill and will also provide $4 million -- including $1.25 million in 
civil penalties -- for state environmental and educational funds. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement was the latest in a series of agreements under which 
Kentucky-based Ashland said it would pay more than $32.5 million to settle 
claims resulting from the spill of 750,000 gallons of diesel fuel into the 
Monongahela and Ohio rivers after a storage tank ruptured at Floreffe, south of 
Pittsburgh, in January, 1988. The spill disrupted water supplies for nearly a 
week for thousands of residents and businesses, and killed 11,000 fish and 
2,000 birds, according to the state. 
</P>
<P>
"This is also the largest single environmental payment a company has agreed to 
pay in Pennsylvania," Gov. Robert P. Casey said in a statement, "and it's 
unique because, through this agreement, the Ashland penalties will be put to 
sound environmental use." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Welks, chief counsel for the state's Department of Environmental 
Resources, called the agreement "one of the biggest and most comprehensive 
settlements in any environmental incident in the country's history." 
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear what implications the settlement may have for other states 
facing similar oil-spill problems, since state laws and enforcement differ 
greatly, and each spill has unique effects, said James Shirley, a lawyer at 
Haight, Gardner, Poor &amp; Havens, a New York firm specializing in admiralty 
law. 
</P>
<P>
But John Pendergrass, a senior attorney with the nonprofit Environmental Law 
Institute in Washington, viewed the settlement as "a positive sign for other 
states that are going to have to respond to large spills." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Ashland spokesman Roger Schrum denied that the settlement 
would set any precedent. 
</P>
<P>
Rhode Island, Delaware and Texas suffered tanker oil spills last summer of a 
size comparable to the Ashland incident. The settlement may not apply to 
Alaska, which is still dealing with the fallout from the Exxon Valdez leak last 
March, because of that spill's magnitude and high profile. 
</P>
<P>
Ashland Chairman John R. Hall said the company settled to avoid costly and 
lengthy litigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Ashland has responsibly dealt with the claims from Pennsylvania in reaching 
this settlement," he said. "Of equal importance, this essentially concludes all 
outstanding issues associated with the spill." 
</P>
<P>
Schrum itemized the $32.5 million Ashland has spent so far: $14 million to 
settle more than 5,000 third-party claims as well as damages, expenses and cost 
of the settlement announced Wednesday; $11 million for cleanup; $5.25 million 
in legal and administrative fees to handle class-action suits, and $2.25 
million in criminal fines paid earlier this year for violations of the Federal 
Clean Water Act. In addition, he said, the company has set aside an additional 
$10 million from a class-action settlement to handle future claims. 
</P>
<P>
Ashland has also spent an undisclosed sum in the cleanup effort in addition to 
the state's costs, Schrum said. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the Pennsylvania settlement will not affect Ashland's earnings, 
Schrum said. Insurance should pay most of the cost, he said, because Ashland 
has already met the policy's $2.5-million deductible. 
</P>
<P>
Under Wednesday's settlement, Ashland agreed to pay the following by Dec. 31: 
$1.75 million for a comprehensive survey of the Ohio River Basin's water and 
recreational resources by the Ohio River Valley Sanitation Commission; $1.25 
million in civil penalties to be divided among the Safe Drinking Water Fund, 
Solid Waste Abatement Fund and Clean Water Fund; $300,000 for environmental 
training in the Pittsburgh area; $215,000 for scholarships for students pursing 
careers in environmental protection; $250,000 to the Pennsylvania Fish 
Commission; $200,000 to the state Game Commission, and $35,000 for 
water-quality enforcement equipment, including a boat.

DURABLE GOODS ORDERS OFF 0.6% FOR OCTOBER 
</P>

Orders for durable goods, items ranging from refrigerators and automobiles to 
aircraft, inched down 0.6% in October after a revised 1.1% fall in September, 
the Commerce Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
It said a 3% jump in transportation orders tempered the overall decline, which 
was propelled by a sharp fall in defense orders. Rising orders for ships and 
civilian airplanes more than offset a decline in auto production and parts. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile transportation sector from both months, orders fell 1.8% 
in October after a 2.8% rise in September. 
</P>
<P>
The October decline fell short of economists' expectations of a steep 2.1% 
drop. The September order rate was revised down sharply from a previously 
reported rise of 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding defense orders, which fell sharply in October, durable goods orders 
rose a slight 0.5%. The September figure, exclusive of defense orders, showed a 
3.5% fall. 
</P>
<P>
Orders for military capital goods fell 12.4% in October after a 33.9% jump in 
September. Non-defense capital goods, boosted by transportation orders, rose 
3.2% last month after a 4.7% fall in September. 
</P>
<P>
Overall durable goods orders in October totaled $124.59 billion, compared to 
$125.33 billion in September. 
</P>
<P>
Built to last three years or more, durable goods are a key part of the 
manufacturing sector, and orders for the big-ticket items are closely watched 
as an indicator of the economy's health. 
</P>
<P>
The department said shipments of durable goods last month fell by 1.7% 
following September's 3% fall. Unfilled orders, an indicator of future 
activity, rose by 0.5% after a 0.2% gain the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector has lately been under pressure, and that was reflected in 
the fall in orders for non-transporation goods. Manufacturing employment has 
dropped for seven straight months, durable goods orders have declined for two 
consecutive months, and industrial production has contracted sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Federal Reserve has eased credit to prevent the weakness from 
spreading, economists say interest rates could come down further if the 
economic slowdown persists. But the Fed is also treading a cautious path, 
fearful that looser credit could reignite inflation, which is running at a 4.6% 
rate so far this year at the consumer level. 
</P>
<P>
Among other sectors, orders for electrical machinery and primary metals each 
fell 3.8%, while non-electrical machinery fell 4.6%. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. manufacturing sector is in a recession. Very few industries are 
hiring, and most are laying off employees," said John Hagens, chief economist 
for the WEFA Group, an economic forecasting company in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
The open question, economists said, was whether the sluggishness in 
manufacturing would spill over into the rest of the economy and spell an end to 
the economic recovery, which has already lasted a peacetime record of seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill Inc., predicted that economic 
growth would dip below an annual rate of 1% in the final three months of this 
year, and she said economic activity would remain lackluster through the first 
half of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not forecasting a recession but we are forecasting miserable growth. It 
is so close to the edge that the economy could slip into negative growth," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the economy faced such an extended period of weakness was in 
mid-1986.

The San Francisco-based retail chain reported a net loss of $840,000 in the 
third quarter, compared to a loss of $233,000 in the year-ago period. Revenue 
was up 13% to $41.5 million. Results were adversely affected by the San 
Francisco earthquake on Oct. 17, which caused its toll-free ordering system to 
be shut down for three days, the company said. In addition, the three San 
Francisco Bay Area stores were closed for three days and experienced reduced 
sales in the following weeks.

PEOPLE: CHIEF OF PARSONS TO RETIRE AFTER 24 YEARS WITH FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
William E. Leonhard will retire as chairman and chief executive of Parsons 
Corp. on May 15 after 24 years with the Pasadena-based engineering and 
construction firm, it was announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Leonhard, who will be 75 next month, said he has accomplished all his 
objectives at the firm, adding, "I feel good at this moment contemplating 
retirement and handing the reins to younger hands to take the company into the 
21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
Leonhard joined Ralph M. Parsons, now a unit of Parsons Corp., in 1966 as 
senior vice president and assistant general manager. His intent was to make the 
then-heavily leveraged company solvent, to diversify beyond its focus on the 
oil and gas industry and to eventually take the firm private, which happened in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
The company recorded sales of $706.5 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Since Parsons Corp. was created in 1978, Leonhard has been its chairman and 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons' board will select a replacement in March from senior officers 
including Ray W. Judson, Parsons Corp. president; Leonard J. Pieroni, executive 
vice president and director of corporate planning; Robert B. Sheh, Ralph M. 
Parsons Co. president; Thomas L. Langford, Parsons Corp. executive vice 
president and chief financial officer, and Joel H. Bennett, executive vice 
president and director of business development. 
</P>
<P>
Leonhard served in the military for 28 years, rising to the rank of Air Force 
brigadier general in 1960. The next year he was made chief of staff of the Air 
Force Systems Command at Andrews Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons Corp. projects included building Los Angeles International Airport's 
second level roadway, which opened in 1984, and designing the 103-mile 
Washington Metrorail system. Parsons is building a multibillion-dollar 
industrial city in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia, which the company said is one of the 
world's largest engineering and construction projects in progress today. NANCY

Gold prices rallied again on Wednesday, topping $410 an ounce. The dollar 
drifted mostly lower in sluggish pre-holiday trading. 
</P>
<P>
Enthusiastic buyers continued to snap up gold bullion after the metal passed 
the psychologically significant price of $400 an ounce on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery surged $7.30 
an ounce to $411. The Republic National Bank quoted gold bullion at $410 as of 
4 p.m. EST, $6.50 higher than Tuesday's late bid. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier overseas trading, gold was bid late in London at $409.75, up from 
$402.75 late Tuesday. The late bid price in Zurich, Switzerland, soared to $409 
from $399 late Tuesday. Hong Kong gold prices rose $8.28 to close at $406.89. 
</P>
<P>
Silver turned in a mixed performance, posting sharp gains abroad before 
steadying in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The metal rose to a late bid of $5.83 an ounce in London, up from $5.71 late 
Tuesday. Silver gave up a portion of Tuesday's 14.6-cent gain in New York. On 
New York's Comex, silver for current delivery settled at $5.800, compared to 
$5.834 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended lower against most major currencies in choppy European and 
U.S. trading as traders remained preoccupied with the West German mark. 
</P>
<P>
Trading activity was described as subdued. West German markets were closed for 
the day; U.S. and Japanese markets were winding down for Thanksgiving holidays 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers are bullish toward the mark because they are betting West 
Germany might have to raise interest rates to keep its economy from 
overheating. It is widely believed that West German growth will accelerate as 
East Germans continue to pour into the country. 
</P>
<P>
Higher West German interest rates would raise returns on mark-denominated 
investments and spur demand for marks. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted at 1.81275 marks late in New York, down from 1.81375 on 
Tuesday. Earlier, in London, the dollar changed hands at 1.8095 marks, down 
from 1.8200 marks late Tuesday in London. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.55 Japanese yen to a closing 143.88 yen. Later in 
London, it fell to 143.50 yen and in New York, it declined to 143.10 yen, down 
from 143.555 late Tuesday.

The stock market staged a pre-Thanksgiving rally in moderate trading Wednesday, 
bolstered by stronger-than-expected economic news and talk that interest rates 
might be headed lower. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 17.49 points to 2,656.78. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 888 up, 565 down and 533 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that new orders for durable goods showed a 
0.6% decline in October. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding military items, which are subject to wide swings month to month, the 
department said orders for goods with usable lives of several years or more 
increased 0.5% from the month before. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the news came as a positive surprise for traders who have grown 
increasingly worried lately about the slowing pace of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The market's advance also got a boost at mid-session from signs that the 
Federal Reserve might have taken further steps to relax its credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
The markets will be closed today for Thanksgiving and will be open Friday for 
what traditionally is one of the Street's slowest days of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Instruments climbed 4 3/4 to 36 1/2 in active trading. On Tuesday the 
news surfaced that the company had been granted a patent in Japan for the basic 
integrated circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Other gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up 1/2 at 60 1/8; 
McDonald's, up 3/8 at 32 3/4; Philip Morris, up 5/8 at 41 3/8; Coca-Cola, up 
5/8 at 77 5/8, and International Business Machines, up 5/8 at 100 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 145.73 million shares, against 147.90 million in the 
previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, 
including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
over-the-counter market, totaled 178.67 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
In London, share prices closed higher Wednesday, boosted by moderate gains in 
early Wall Street dealings. 
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 7.2 points, or 
0.3%, higher at 2,192.3, but down from an early peak of 2,197.4. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo share prices surged to a second straight record high close buoyed by new 
investment trust funds and scattered buying by other institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
The key 225-share Nikkei index soared 227.05 points, or 0.63%, to a record 
close of 36,286.92 after rising 166.29 on Tuesday. The Nikkei hit a new high of 
36,387.65 in the afternoon.

Interest Rate Hopes Send Bonds Higher 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices edged higher Wednesday in an abbreviated pre-Thanksgiving session 
amid signs the Federal Reserve was encouraging lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/4 point, or about $2.50 per $1,000 
in face amount. Its yield fell to 7.87% from 7.90% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, said bonds 
got a lift at midday when the Fed injected reserves into the financial system 
by making short-term purchases of securities from dealers. 
</P>
<P>
By making funds available to the financial system, he said the central bank 
takes pressure off interest rates. Falling interest rates boost bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
The injection of reserves was reflected in a decline in the federal funds rate, 
the interest on overnight loans between banks. The rate dropped to 8.125% from 
8.5%.

Meat Futures Rise, Cocoa Prices Slump 
</P>
<P>
Livestock and meat futures rallied on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in line 
with stronger cash markets. Cocoa futures sank to new 14-year lows. 
</P>
<P>
After the close, the Agriculture Department released a monthly cold-storage 
report showing 40.2 million pounds of frozen pork bellies in warehouses as of 
Oct. 31. The number was slightly higher than expected and could prompt some 
selling of pork belly futures when trading resumes Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Live cattle futures settled 0.10 to 0.42 cent higher, with December at 76 cents 
a pound; feeder cattle were 0.15 to 0.30 cent higher, with November at 83.45 
cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to 0.28 cent higher, with December at 51.25 
cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 0.20 to 0.60 cent higher, with 
February at 63.25 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa futures prices sank to new 14-year lows on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; 
Cocoa Exchange, reflecting the burdensome supplies of cocoa on the market. 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa settled $19 to $23 lower, with December at $918 per metric ton.

HEALTH: COMPANIES ARE SPENDING MILLIONS ON EMPLOYEE EXERCISE CENTERS, BELIEVING 
FIT EMPLOYEES ARE MORE PRODUCTIVE AND HEALTHIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Corporate fitness centers used to be a perk. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies started putting in recreational centers and exercise equipment 
because it was a 'good thing,' " said Stephen Pauley, manager of the Rockwell 
Employees Recreation and Fitness Center in West Hills. The center, which opened 
in 1941, serves the 9,000 area employees of Rockwell's Rocketdyne division. 
</P>
<P>
"The benefit to a company was undefinable. You couldn't put it on a graph or 
show how it would help a company's financial picture. It was just a good thing 
to do. A benefit. A warm fuzzy." 
</P>
<P>
The workplace has changed radically at Rocketdyne since the West Hills center 
opened. Likewise, views on bodybuilding and fitness: Pumping iron has gone from 
aberration to social acceptance to being a craze that shows no sign of abating. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, more businesses jumped on the fitness bandwagon -- and not just 
to be faddish or to increase their quota of warm fuzzies. Corporations, many of 
which had long subsidized health-club memberships for top executives, were 
ready to experiment with offering the joys of sweat to a far wider range of 
workers. They were willing to bet that a fitter employee would be a more 
productive employee who would file fewer costly health claims. 
</P>
<P>
Such national powerhouses as Campbell Soup, General Electric, Hughes Aircraft 
and Toyota U.S.A. have installed fitness centers at various facilities in the 
past few years. Likewise, a handful of firms headquartered in the San Fernando 
Valley have made a considerable investment in exercise equipment, locker rooms, 
showers and even personal trainers. 
</P>
<P>
Rocketdyne's commitment to fitness and recreation, for example, comes with an 
annual price tag of $1.3 million to staff and maintain the 10-acre West Hills 
center, with its indoor exercise building and extensive outdoor playing fields. 
The property, once part of an estate owned by comedian Lou Costello, was 
acquired to provide plant employees with recreation space for baseball games, 
picnicking and other family outings. One of the playgrounds has a metal Jungle 
Gym-like structure shaped, appropriately, like a rocket. 
</P>
<P>
"All this started as part of the industrial recreation movement of the early 
1940s," Pauley said while conducting a tour of the center. "Back then, we had 
about 80% blue-collar workers at the plant and 20% white-collar and executives. 
The company thought it was a good thing for the employees to have a nice place 
to spend leisure time with other workers. Join clubs, play sports. It would 
build morale. But there wasn't much thought given to 'working out.' They did 
enough physical labor on the job. It was hard work." 
</P>
<P>
With the advent of computerized automation, the ratio of blue- to white-collar 
workers at Rocketdyne has almost reversed itself, Pauley said. And the 
blue-collar jobs involve much less heavy lifting. 
</P>
<P>
"Now those jobs mostly consist of someone sitting and watching a CRT screen, 
monitoring what an automated machine is doing," Pauley said. "It used to be 
that after a day of work, blue-collar workers had to go home and rest. Now, 
they leave work and go work out." 
</P>
<P>
The fitness center, which is free to Rocketdyne employees, their spouses and 
retirees, has also been transformed by technology, especially in the room 
recently set aside for cardiovascular exercise, with its eight high-tech 
Stairmaster machines (with six more on order), two rowing machines and 12 
stationary bicycles. The nearby weight room has several racks of dumb bells and 
barbells, plus an 11-station circuit of Nautilus exercise machines. A suspended 
wood floor, which is thought to reduce the impact on the body during aerobic 
exercise, was recently installed in a former auditorium at a cost of $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
Outside are two 60-foot swimming pools and a children's wading pool; tennis, 
basketball and volleyball courts; a running track and a croquet green. 
</P>
<P>
But on a recent weekday afternoon, fewer than 20 people were using all these 
facilities. Pauley said that because the company allows little flexibility in 
workers' schedules, most of the people who use the center during the workday 
are retirees and spouses. 
</P>
<P>
"Flex time has traditionally been a no-no at Rocketdyne," he said, "so workers 
have to come after work or on weekends. That's when we get very busy." Pauley, 
a trim man who has competed in 90 triathlons, clearly wishes company policy 
were otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"I think flex time would be the way to go," he said, "but it's not easy 
convincing a big company to make that big of a change on the say-so of the 
fitness director." 
</P>
<P>
Pauley estimates that only about 10% of the eligible workers visit regularly. 
He wishes that the percentage were higher, but he also is not sure what he 
would do if the numbers suddenly increased. "I'd like it to be at least 20%," 
he said, "but 20% of 9,000 is a lot of people. As big as this center is, we 
would not be able to handle them." 
</P>
<P>
At GTE California headquarters in Thousand Oaks, about 23% of the 3,000 
eligible employees and area retirees use the plush fitness center. The carpeted 
exercise area includes a suspended wood floor for aerobics, numerous Keiser 
air-pressure weight-training machines, two Stairmasters, five treadmills, 12 
stationary bicycles and a rack of free weights. 
</P>
<P>
Next to each bike and treadmill is a socket for personal headphones. The 
exerciser can turn a knob to choose from three music selections or the audio 
from a wall-mounted TV. 
</P>
<P>
Although GTE allows many of its employees flexibility in scheduling their 
workdays, only three people were using the room on a weekday afternoon. "Our 
heaviest time by far is lunch," said Mike Leonard, a fitness trainer hired by 
GTE to run the center. Leonard, who interned under Pauley at Rockwell's fitness 
center, explained that because GTE has a successful van car-pool program, many 
employees cannot take the time before or after work to exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Those who take advantage of the program receive an initial fitness test to 
gauge their strength and endurance levels. Using software developed by Fitness 
Systems, a Los Angeles company that provided advice on the design of GTE's 
fitness center, Leonard and his three full-time "fitness specialists" (also 
supplied through Fitness Systems) come up with a personalized exercise program. 
</P>
<P>
In this area, Leonard differs from his mentor at Rocketdyne. "We bought a 
computer package that cost us about $2,000 a couple of years ago to design 
custom fitness programs," Pauley said, "but we gave up on it. It didn't allow 
us to make the programs custom enough. It didn't allow for enough personalized 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
Both programs retest participants periodically and both Pauley and Leonard say 
that people who follow their programs and come to the centers regularly make 
great progress. 
</P>
<P>
Don Rose, who was using a "leg extension" machine at GTE to exercise his legs, 
agrees with them. Rose, who is 70 and retired last year, comes to the gym five 
days a week. "I had had a lot of plans to start exercising in my life," he 
said, "but I never got much past the planning stage until the mountain came to 
Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
"When it was right in the same building where I was working, it was so 
convenient I couldn't come up with an excuse." 
</P>
<P>
Rose has lost 25 pounds since he started exercising in the fitness center, and 
he says his endurance has greatly increased. "I used to huff and puff just 
walking down the hall," he said. "Now I can easily cover a few miles at a 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The center, which was included in the plans for the headquarters that opened in 
1985 (the gym didn't open until 1987), costs almost $200,000 a year to operate, 
said Martina Cunningham, manager of the company health program. 
</P>
<P>
GTE pays only about half of that. The rest comes from the $10 monthly fee paid 
by those enrolled in the fitness program. For that, participants get not only 
the use of the facility and guidance of trainers, but also an individual oak 
locker, towels and overnight laundry service for their gym clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Redken Laboratories in Canoga Park has installed a small fitness center 
outfitted with a weight-machine circuit, free weights, a treadmill and 
stationary bicycles. A trainer works on a part-time basis to give fitness tests 
and demonstrate the use of the machines. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea behind it was that it would help with health costs," said Jim 
Griffith, vice president of human relations. But there is little flexibility in 
work schedules at Redken, and the gym is open only during lunch and after 
regular work hours. Griffith estimates that only about 30 employees out of 500 
use the gym. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish it were more, but a lot of our people here are parents, and they want 
to go home right after work. The numbers making use of the gym are just not 
high enough to make a correlation between usage and health costs." 
</P>
<P>
The correlation between usage and health costs is difficult to study, even at 
gyms that are used by a much higher percentage of employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people might ask, 'What does all this fitness stuff have to do with 
making better rocket engines, making more money,' " Pauley said. "I think there 
is definitely a connection, but that is very hard to show." 
</P>
<P>
While there have been surveys that suggest cost benefits are derived from 
having an employee fitness center -- a study by the Canadian government 
suggested that workers enrolled in some type of corporate health and fitness 
program take an average of 2 1/2 fewer sick days per year -- the definitive 
testing has not been done. The problem is the cost of doing an exhaustive 
study. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking expensive number crunching," Pauley said. "To do it right would 
cost about as much as it costs to run this center for a year." 
</P>
<P>
Until that testing is done, the health of corporate gyms must depend completely 
on a benevolent management view toward fitness. 
</P>
<P>
"If a company goes through hard times, the health center is among the first 
things to go," Pauley said. "It's still considered just a perk when times get 
rough. 
</P>
<P>
"Until we can prove otherwise, we are still just a 'good thing.' "

EASING ACCESS OF THE DISABLED TO A COLLEGE EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Psychologist Robert Scott may have received his formal education in a 
university classroom, but some of his most valuable training came from a less 
likely source -- doing magic tricks in front of audiences that weren't always 
receptive. 
</P>
<P>
"During college, I used to go into hospitals and clinics for physically and 
developmentally disabled kids and work as a magician. I always wondered why 
magic could transform some of those kids into a world of make-believe and joy, 
while others seemed to have so totally lost hope and their ability to 
fantasize," Scott recalled. "I thought, 'What is it that makes a person believe 
that something can disappear?' " 
</P>
<P>
Today, as director of the Disabled Student Services Program at Los Angeles 
Valley College, Scott frequently asks himself the same question as he tries to 
make barriers vanish for disabled students who are trying to get an education. 
His cramped office, filled throughout the day with visitors, in wheelchairs or 
ambulatory, serves about 500 disabled people enrolled at Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
If reports from these students and faculty are any indication, he accomplishes 
that task as if pulling a rabbit from his hat. 
</P>
<P>
Take the time two years ago, for example, when a quadriplegic student with a 
severe speech impairment couldn't write term papers -- she could neither type 
nor dictate -- and was on the verge of withdrawing from classes. To solve the 
problem, Scott organized a campus fund-raiser to buy a state-of-the-art 
computer that, through electrodes, allows a student to type with movements as 
minimal as the blink of an eye. 
</P>
<P>
Or take the time a disabled student signed up for a course only to discover 
that the classroom wasn't physically accessible. Not to worry. Scott has been 
known to move an entire class to another room so that a single disabled student 
can attend. 
</P>
<P>
And there have been scores of cases in which disabled students have had 
difficulty keeping up with the pace of a class, taking written tests in the 
time allotted or simply making their special needs known to an instructor. 
Scott has stepped in to help. 
</P>
<P>
"Disabled students here are very welcomed and accepted, but he also educates 
some teachers," Valley College President Mary Lee said. "He works very hard to 
keep students in classes." 
</P>
<P>
In some instances, doing that may mean just lending an ear to their problems or 
helping them through an emotionally difficult time, the students say. 
Encouraged by an open-door policy, students regularly stop by Scott's office in 
the college administration building. 
</P>
<P>
"Some days I've gotten so frustrated when I couldn't say a word, and he'll just 
say, 'Let's get you hooked up to the computer, and you'll feel better,' " said 
Marti Brand, a 33-year-old student with a connective tissue disorder called 
Marfan's syndrome. Last year, Brand suffered several strokes that left her with 
a speech impairment that varies in severity from day to day. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just incredibly supportive," she added. "He even went with me to a 
meeting with a cardiologist and a geneticist one night when he could have been 
home with his wife and kids." 
</P>
<P>
Scott's involvement with the disabled isn't limited to the college campus. In 
addition to conducting a busy private counseling practice in Encino, the 
39-year-old administrator is chairman of the Los Angeles County Disaster 
Response Team, a group he set up two years ago to provide emergency 
psychological services to disabled people and others in the event of a major 
disaster. He also is a member of the state Community College Chancellor's 
Office task force for serving students with psychological disorders. 
</P>
<P>
"What he brings is a unique combination of knowledge, from being a support 
service coordinator, along with his knowledge as a clinical psychologist," said 
Catherine Johns, head of the Sacramento-based psychological disorders task 
force. "He has seen in his own program how offering support services can help 
retain these students, and he even helped put together a videotape for other 
colleges to show them the role those services can play. That was completely a 
volunteer effort on his part." 
</P>

nonprofit agency for the disabled that frequently refers clients to Scott for 
private counseling, expressed a similar opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"There are plenty of good clinicians. The difference with him is that his 
involvement in so many different areas affecting the disabled population has 
really put him in a place alone," Ambrose said. "The Department of Mental 
Health is overwhelmed, and a lot of other counseling facilities have closed, 
but he is always willing to help our clients when he can. That makes him an 
extremely valuable resource." 
</P>
<P>
Not all obstacles Scott tackles on behalf of disabled students come from 
external sources, though. Some, he said, are those that students have imposed 
upon themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of disabled people come here for the first time with an idea already 
ingrained in them about what they can't do. And very often, that idea has been 
reinforced by society," Scott said. "I try to get them to see that they may not 
be able to move their bodies, but that they can move their minds. There are 
ways that they may not have thought of." 
</P>
<P>
In a class he teaches on dealing with disabilities, Scott confronts what he 
believes are the emotional stages most disabled people -- whether disabled by 
injury or from birth -- must go through to get on with the business of living. 
In many ways, he said, those emotions are similar to the stages of death and 
dying identified by psychologist Elisabeth Kubler-Ross several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some very real and powerful emotions people have about their 
disabilities, including anger, resentment or grief at having lost a part of 
them that no longer works," Scott said. "And unfortunately, there's not always 
a happy ending, either. People sometimes get stuck in one of those stages and 
never move on. It's sad. 
</P>
<P>
"They never get a chance to learn a new approach to life," he said. "They just 
drop out instead." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, there are success stories as well. 
</P>
<P>
There is the woman whose husband went into a cocaine-induced hallucination and 
stabbed her repeatedly in the neck and head, causing paralysis and brain 
damage. Scott said the woman is now attending classes and "really fighting to 
come back." 
</P>
<P>
There is the woman who fell out of bed during a dream and broke her neck, and 
the man who slipped on a popcorn kernel and damaged his spinal cord. Both are 
now close to earning their degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"The disabled population is the fastest-growing minority group in the country," 
he said. "I like to remind people that it is the only minority group you can 
join." 
</P>
<P>
Part of Scott's sensitivity to the needs of the disabled may have come from 
having been a fringe member of that group for most of his life. The son of an 
employment counselor and a housewife, Scott grew up in North Hollywood, where 
he was diagnosed with congenital scoliosis, or back deformity, when he was 13. 
For several years, he said, he was kept out of sports and other physical 
activities. He wore a lift in one shoe, as he still does, to compensate for 
that leg's being shorter than the other. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw myself in terms of what I couldn't do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During high school, over the objections of his doctor and parents, Scott 
learned to surf. The exhilaration of the experience, he said, made him aware 
that there might be other activities he had incorrectly ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, at age 26, Scott received his doctorate in psychology from UC Irvine, 
writing his thesis on the needs of special populations. 
</P>
<P>
"One student came here a few years ago, and her disability was so severe that 
everyone who met her automatically assumed she was retarded. Today she's 
getting straight A's, and they are not from sympathy," he said. "The groundwork 
was laid for her, and then she just took it from there." 
</P>
<P>
Scott laced his hands behind his head and leaned back in his chair. 
</P>
<P>
"That's really what is so thrilling for me," he said. "You get to watch someone 
be unlocked."

THE FISH LADY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patients at a hospital in the West Valley are sometimes surprised when a woman 
carrying a bucket of dead fish comes to see the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm responsible for about 5,000 koi. Sometimes, when I can't figure out why 
certain fish died, I'll bring them to this doctor friend who does a full 
autopsy free of charge," says Barbara Johnson, whose company, "The Fish Lady," 
specializes in pond and koi care. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Johnson, who lives in Sherman Oaks, was working in the film 
industry. "It's a business of loonies," she states unequivocally. "I didn't 
want to pay a shrink $125 an hour to tell me to relax, so I got into fish 
instead." (The minimum payment for one call is $45.) 
</P>
<P>
Now she works 12-hour days and is on call 24 hours a day. "If a fish gets sick, 
you want to get there right away because they go fast," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who runs her business out of her home, administers shots and once 
spent several hours moving a comatose fish back and forth in a pond, in a 
successful attempt to revive it. "My arm was killing me by the time I was 
done," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more fun parts of her job is stocking a client's pond. "I create a 
water painting with fish. They all have different colors and patterns, so when 
they swim around, it's mesmerizing," Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
Tranquility does have its price. Johnson says, "I don't eat much fish anymore 
because it's too personal." 
</P>
<P>
A New Spin on Art 
</P>
<P>
There's a whole lot of painting going on in the Valley these days, thanks to 
two new businesses that make instant artists out of their customers. 
</P>
<P>
The first, Paintemonium, is a shopping mall store that sells T-shirts, socks, 
sweat shirts, and leggings, which customers decorate with paint at worktables 
inside the store. Anyone with a less-than- steady hand may opt to have their 
piece put into a spinner, where the paints swirl together and race off the edge 
of the garment. It costs $16 to buy and paint an adult-size T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wearable art," says Lori Ross, manager of Paintemonium in the Glendale 
Galleria. (There are also outlets in Topanga Plaza and the Northridge Fashion 
Center.) "You can even bring in your own clothes and just pay for the paints. 
We've had people bring in gym shoes, boxer shorts and even bikinis." 
</P>
<P>
Some customers paint the bottoms of their dog's feet or their child's hands and 
imprint them on the clothing. 
</P>
<P>
In Northridge, another business called Kids 'N Paint ("Ages 5 to 95") sometimes 
resembles a child-care center. It sells a huge assortment of plaster objects -- 
such as masks, coin banks, animal figurines, letters and numbers -- which 
children (and yes, some adults) paint in the store. 
</P>
<P>
"We provide smocks, a bathroom, a pay phone, glitter, lace, soft drinks, 
popcorn -- you name it," says co-owner Elissa Fishman. Prices start at $1 and 
average about $6. 
</P>
<P>
The New Smell of Facials 
</P>
<P>
"Aromatherapy has been around for centuries, but it's relatively new to this 
country," says Renate Barbev, co-owner of The Face Maker Skin Care Salon in 
Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a facial treatment, aromatherapy involves the application of 
fragrant essential oils to the skin during the massage stage. (According to 
skin-care experts, essential oils, made from plant extracts, are used for such 
problems as red and dry skin.) "Most facial treatments rely on various creams 
instead of these oils," says Arlene Worchell, owner of Arlene's Beauty Retreat, 
a skin-care salon in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Among the essential oils that may be used are lavender, lemon, pine, 
eucalyptus, rosemary, chamomile, rose or geranium, each with its own 
revitalizing or healing properties. The condition of a client's skin at the 
time of the facial determines which oil or combination of oils will be used. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't forget that our sense of smell is very closely linked to our emotional 
system -- a whiff of something can sometimes bring back a powerful memory that 
is very pleasing to you," Worchell says. "These oils smell very lovely, and 
people relax when they smell the fragrance." 
</P>
<P>
The cost of an aromatherapy facial is comparable to a regular facial: $35 to 
$40. 
</P>
<P>
Ivy to Go 
</P>
<P>
"The main reason we got rid of it was because of the rats, and the second 
reason was because we hated it. Ivy hampers you in your landscaping because it 
overtakes everything," says homeowner Sylvia Mandel of Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
That ubiquitous ground cover is frequently being ripped out of yards where it's 
been growing for decades. "People don't like the look of it anymore. They're 
tired of it," says Steve Weber, bedding plant manager at Green Arrow Nursery in 
Sepulveda. "We probably have over 50 varieties of ground cover that we carry 
here, and one of the most popular ones right now is called Red Apple. It looks 
like ice plant, has a lot of red flowers in the spring through summer and is 
very drought resistant." 
</P>
<P>
Among the other ground covers frequently replacing ivy are African daisies and 
ice plant. They are similarly priced (about $8.99 a flat) but are more labor 
intensive. Unlike ivy, they need to be fertilized and watered regularly and are 
more prone to disease. Rosemary and lantana (at $10.99 a flat) are other 
popular choices. 
</P>
<P>
But this is not the time of year to replace any ivy growing on hillsides, warns 
David Ngo, owner of Suburban Landscape and Maintenance in Van Nuys. "It's 
better to wait until after the rains," he says.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT -- A CLASS ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE SCHLOSBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifth-graders in North Hollywood got a lesson in giving, a break from their 
math books and a lot of satisfaction in November, when they organized an 
unusual food drive for people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"AIDS is a disease that people get, and we have to help them so they won't 
suffer a lot," said 10-year-old Jose Garcia as he sorted cans of soup, 
vegetables and fruit cocktail in his classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Jose and his classmates at Camellia Avenue Elementary School collected hundreds 
of cleaning products and non-perishable food items from students, family 
members and local politicians. They gave the items to AIDS Project Los Angeles, 
which distributes groceries and personal-care products free of charge to people 
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome or AIDS-related complex who earn less 
than $700 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"An organized effort by a group of grade-school students is really unusual," 
said Jack Cotter, manager of the food distribution program. "It's really 
raising their consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
Cotter said more than 900 people are eligible for the AIDS Project L.A. 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-grade teacher Julie Baron said she wanted to show her class that even at 
their age, they can contribute to the community. "The biggest thing is knowing 
that they can make a difference -- whether it be with the homeless, the poor or 
people with AIDS," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Baron said Los Angeles Unified School District policy prohibits teachers from 
discussing the sexual aspects of AIDS, so she focused instead on drug education 
and dispelling myths. 
</P>
<P>
"I explained how the immune system works, and we talked about how you don't get 
AIDS from hugging and drinking water," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Baron, saying AIDS had killed some her friends, told the class she would have 
liked to talk about its sexual aspects. "I think we're doing a real disservice 
to kids by not talking about it," she said. "It really infuriates me." 
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate the practical applications of addition, subtraction and 
multiplication, Baron devised a "Price Is Right" of sorts. She put price tags 
on six of the donated food items and told the students they had $25 to spend. 
The students chose items they wanted and then figured out how much of each they 
could buy without going over their spending limit. 
</P>
<P>
The students seemed to appreciate the diversion from their math textbook. "My 
math book is harder and more boring," Jose said. 
</P>
<P>
"We got to be like a grown-up and go buy food," said Janice Ambriz, 10. The 
students worked on their communication skills by writing letters to local 
businesses and politicians, asking for donations. And Baron had a friend teach 
the class to write news releases. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted people in the community who saw what the class was doing to realize 
that not all kids are on drugs," Baron said. 
</P>
<P>
The class didn't get any donations from the businesses, but Rep. Henry Waxman 
sent cans of soup, City Councilman Ernani Bernardi sent $50, and the North 
Hollywood Division of the Los Angeles Police Department sent huge tubs of 
peanut butter and jelly. 
</P>
<P>
The class also learned about advertising by making posters to hang in other 
classrooms at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Baron used the project to help her Spanish-speaking students learn 
some practical English words, including the names of fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Janice said her favorite part of the project was going to other classrooms and 
talking about helping others. "That was really exciting," she said. "I feel 
like telling the whole world to help."

A CRASH, RECOVERY AND RACE TO THE FINISH LINE

<P>
In 1989, the Earth trembled, skies poured, killer winds howled, tankers spilled 
and revolutions swept the globe. In Los Angeles, gang violence claimed yet more 
victims and traffic seemed to grow ever worse. Still, amid the tide of 
oft-tragic happenings, small rays of hope keep shining through. Here are a few 
of many stories worth sharing on a day of feasting, family and friends. They're 
enough to remind that it's still worth saying: "Oh, Thank Goodness." 
</P>
<P>
For Shirley Muldowney, a national drag racing champion, winning another race 
might not seem such a significant matter. 
</P>
<P>
But her mid-October victory in the Fallnationals competition in Phoenix, her 
first race win in three years, was special for Muldowney, who survived a 
devastating car crash on a Canadian track in June, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The 250-m.p.h. wreck was so bad she was unsure that she would ever walk again, 
let alone get on a track in her pink top-fuel dragster. 
</P>
<P>
Muldowney, 49, underwent five major operations to rebuild her left foot and 
repair her legs, pelvis, fingers and an almost-severed thumb; she endured more 
than a year's worth of physical therapy before returning to racing in January, 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
"The win at Phoenix was worth it all," says Muldowney, who lives in Northridge 
with her husband and crew chief, Rohn Tobler. "I'm thankful that I hung in 
there, that we all did." 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on her remarkable comeback, she remarks: "I was hurt real bad, and I 
knew it was going to be a long, long road. It was a lot of hard work and so 
painful. . . . I really needed a light at the end of the tunnel and racing was 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Muldowney -- who shares the distinction with Don (Big Daddy) Garlits for 
winning three National Hot Rod Assn. top-fuel championships -- was national 
champion in 1977, 1980 and 1982. She is searching for a new racing sponsor but 
is looking forward to seeking a fourth national championship next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very excited at Phoenix," she says. "The last win I had was in '83, 
but I didn't compete for 1 1/2 seasons. We were excited by the fact that we 
found the winning combination we looked for for so long. . . . We had a 
tremendous amount of bad breaks and bad luck. So this was a great win." LYNN

In 1989, the Earth trembled, skies poured, killer winds howled, tankers spilled

victims and traffic seemed to grow ever worse. Still, amid the tide of 
oft-tragic happenings, small rays of hope keep shining through. Here are a few

Out of the corner of her eye as she drove north on Pacific Coast Highway two 
weeks ago, Bobbi Phillips saw dust coming toward her down a hill. 
</P>
<P>
Before she had time to react, earth and rocks slammed into the side of her 
Mercedes sedan "like a fist," spinning it across the highway and flipping it on 
its roof. The Santa Ana housewife worried that the car would blow up. 
</P>
<P>
But she walked away with two broken ribs, cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot to be thankful for," Phillips, 47, says of her Pacific Palisades 
mishap. "I was in a large, very heavy car. My seat belt protected me, even 
though it hurt my ribs. The lifeguard from the beach was there so quickly to 
help. As soon as I started to open the door, he was pulling on it. 
</P>
<P>
"The paramedics were so thorough. The doctors and nurses (who treated us) at 
Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center were wonderful. They were very caring." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips says when she first saw the moving earth, she thought it wouldn't do 
much damage. "I assumed it was a landslide, but I never expected it to be a big 
one," she says. "Then when it hit me and started to throw the car all around, 
it really scared me. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened really fast. I just remember being flung around. Somehow, I hit my 
left cheek bone severely, but I don't know how. When the car came to rest and I 
knew I was going to get out, I was just thankful to be alive." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, who was on her way to see her daughter play volleyball when the 
accident occurred, will celebrate Thanksgiving with her husband, Jerry, a 
lawyer, and three children Laura, 21; Joe, 19 and Ben, 14. GARY LIBMAN

In 1989, the Earth trembled, skies poured, killer winds howled, tankers spilled 
and revolutions swept the globe. In Los Angeles, gang violence claimed yet more 
victims and traffic seemed to grow ever worse. Still, amid the tide of 
oft-tragic happenings, small rays of hope keep shining through. Here are a few 
of many stories worth sharing on a day of feasting, family and friends. They're 
enough to remind that it's still worth saying: "Oh, Thank Goodness." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Lupe Talavera was a welfare mother with three children, a former 
husband who wouldn't pay child support and a bleak future. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the 40-year-old El Sereno native is celebrating more than just 
Thanksgiving: She's celebrating a new job and new life. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having Thanksgiving with all the trimmings," she says proudly. "I'm 
going to buy everything myself. And I'm going to feel real good." 
</P>
<P>
Married in 1976 to an El Sereno truck driver, Talavera was divorced in 1987. 
Somehow, the housewife had to raise, clothe and feed her family and keep a roof 
over their heads by herself. 
</P>
<P>
"But you can't get a job when you have no skills," the high school dropout 
says. 
</P>
<P>
She moved her family into a crowded one-bedroom apartment, and her children 
found odd jobs such as doing yard work and delivering newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
But still there wasn't enough money to go around. "It was very hard to 
survive," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Angry and embarrassed, Talavera went on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Then, her sister read about a new program to help women get off welfare and 
find work. But the nonprofit National Women's Employment and Education Inc. 
(NWEE) was still just setting up. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Talavera moved in with her mother and earned a degree as a medical 
assistant from Glendale College of Business and Paramedical. 
</P>
<P>
Once NWEE started its three-week program in September, Talavera learned typing, 
filing, preparing a resume, even dressing for the job. "It helped me with my 
motivation and self-esteem," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, NWEE helped her get a job. 
</P>
<P>
On Halloween, she started work as a secretary in the downtown offices of the 
California Primary Physicians Medical Group. She earns $1,245 a month, almost 
twice what she received from welfare. 
</P>
<P>
"Just to know that I'm working and providing for myself and my family is such a 
good feeling," she says. "I know my children are very proud of me." 
</P>
<P>
So, today, besides baking her favorite pumpkin pies, Talavera will say a small 
prayer before dinner. "I will say I'm thankful that the Lord has been very good 
to me these past few months. And I'm very thankful to the NWEE. They really 
give you a chance." NIKKI FINKE

In 1989, the Earth trembled, skies poured, killer winds howled, tankers spilled 
and revolutions swept the globe. In Los Angeles, gang violence claimed yet more 
victims and traffic seemed to grow ever worse. Still, amid the tide of 
oft-tragic happenings, small rays of hope keep shining through. Here are a few 
of many stories worth sharing on a day of feasting, family and friends. They're 
enough to remind that it's still worth saying: "Oh, Thank Goodness." 
</P>
<P>
They are native Angelenos, Westsiders who had finally had it with Los Angeles. 
The traffic, the smog, the crime. They wanted out in the worst way. 
</P>
<P>
They thought long and hard about how to improve the quality of their lives. 
Mike Paisley, 40, even sold his business, a summer and day camp in West Los 
Angeles, so he'd have time to write and think about what would make him and his 
wife truly happy. Suzanne Paisley, 32, kept working as a self-employed 
management consultant. 
</P>
<P>
They decided owning and operating a bed and breakfast inn, preferably in a 
quiet mountain hamlet, would fulfill many of their dreams. So for nearly two 
years, their search for the perfect B &amp; B consumed their vacations. 
Finally, while visiting Los Alamos, N.M., last May 18, their fourth 
anniversary, they found a six-bedroom B &amp; B up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
But they had only about $1,000 in savings and had never owned their own home. 
Still, they "decided to just go for it and see what we could scrounge up, 
borrow from friends and get in loans," says Mike, adding that everyone they 
then asked said no. 
</P>
<P>
The couple proceeded on, as if, somehow, they were going to get the place. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne told a client she had worked for full time that she soon would be 
leaving for Los Alamos; hearing that, another consultant offered her a sizable 
sum for the name of her business ("The Business Doctor") and rights to 
reproduce her brochure. 
</P>
<P>
It was enough for a down payment. Only trouble was, the B &amp; B's seller then 
decided to hold on to the place until next summer. 
</P>
<P>
Depressed, the Paisleys recall sitting on the beach at Playa del Rey and 
deciding, against all logic, to move to Los Alamos anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"We said, 'If we don't have a house, we'll find one. If we have to, we'll get 
an apartment. Somehow, we'll have faith it will work out,' " Suzanne says. "The 
very next day, the owner called to say whenever you want to move in, you can 
move in." 
</P>
<P>
Then, on the day closing papers were signed, a friend of Suzanne's offered a 
gift -- one even larger than the sum of the down payment. The gift, a thank-you 
for Suzanne's past kindness, enabled the couple to have money for moving, 
closing costs, start-up expenses and more. 
</P>
<P>
The Paisleys moved into the Orange Street Bed and Breakfast Inn at the 
beginning of October, and, says Mike, got a booking the second day they were 
there. Within a week, the place was booked solid and business has been good 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a period when this seemed like a miracle and it was too hard to 
believe," recalls Suzanne. "It almost became scary, like this is too good to be 
true. The beauty is that it just got better and better." BETH ANN KRIER

CHILLING LOOK AT GREENHOUSE EFFECT'S POWER TO ALTER LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL McKIBBEN, Bill McKibben has written hundreds of articles for New Yorker 
magazine. He also has written on nature for the New York Review of Books, the 
New York Times and other national publications. He and his wife live in the 
Adirondack mountains of New York state.

The single most-talked-about consequence of the greenhouse effect is probably 
the expected rise in global sea level as a result of polar melting. For the 
last few thousand years, the sea level "has risen so slowly that for most 
practical purposes it has been constant," says James Titus, of the 
Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, people have developed the coastlines extensively. Not just the 
beaches in Rio or the canals in Venice, but also the infrastructure of all 
major ports, around which have grown up most of the world's great cities. And 
not just people: Marine plants and animals have taken the opportunity provided 
by sea-level stability to build huge communities such as the one in Chesapeake 
Bay. But, despite all this confidence, the sea level is not a given. 
</P>
<P>
A hundred thousand years, ago, during the last interglacial period, it was 20 
feet above current levels; at the height of the last Ice Age, when much of the 
world's water was frozen at the poles, the sea level fell 300 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists estimate that the world's remaining ice cover contains enough water 
so that, if it should all melt, the seas would rise about 75 meters, or nearly 
250 feet. 
</P>
<P>
This potential inundation is stored in the Greenland Ice Sheet (if it melts, it 
will raise the world's oceans 20 feet), the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (another 
20 feet), and East Antarctica (nearly 200 feet), with a smaller amount, perhaps 
1.5 feet, in all the planet's alpine glaciers combined. 
</P>
<P>
The alpine glaciers, while small compared with the ice caps, are not small. 
Glaciers bordering the Gulf of Alaska, for instance, have been melting for 
decades and constitute a source of fresh water about the size of the entire 
Mississippi River system. 
</P>
<P>
And even if the growing greenhouse effect melted nothing at all, the increased 
heat alone would raise the sea level considerably. Warm water takes up more 
space than cold water -- this thermal expansion, given a global temperature 
increase of 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius, should raise the seas a foot. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate effects of this swollen sea would be seen in a place like the 
Maldive Islands. Most of this happy nation rises only 2 meters above the Indian 
Ocean. If the sea level were to rise 1 meter, storm surges would become an 
enormous, crippling danger; were it to rise 2 meters, a rise well within the 
range of possibilities predicted by many studies, the country would simply 
disappear. 
</P>
<P>
Other nations, though not extinguished, would be horribly hurt. A two-meter 
rise in the sea level would flood 20% of the land in Bangladesh. In Egypt, such 
a rise would inundate only about 1% of the land, but that 1% includes much of 
the Nile delta, where most of the people live. All across Asia, farmers grow 
rice on low river deltas and flood plains. Because those farmers lack the 
resources to build dikes and seawalls (and in some places, such as Bangladesh, 
such defenses are practically impossible), harvests would almost certainly 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not just the Third World that would suffer. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years ago, the United States Environmental Protection Agency issued 
a work sheet by which local governments could calculate their future position 
vis-a-vis the salt water. (In Sandy Hook, N.J., for instance, add 13 inches to 
account for local geological subsidence to the projected increase in sea level, 
for a net ocean rise of 4 feet 1 inch.) Direct inundation of land would cause a 
certain number of problems; in Massachusetts, for instance, between 3,000 and 
10,000 acres of ocean-front land worth between $3 billion and $10 billion might 
disappear by 2025, and that figure that does not include land lost to growing 
ponds and bogs as the rising sea lifts the water table. 
</P>
<P>
But storm surges would do the most dramatic damage. In Galveston, Texas, 98% of 
the land is within the plain that would be flooded by the worst storms. 
</P>
<P>
There are other reasons, too, to fear a sea-level rise. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, I spent a happy day with William Harkness, the rivermaster of 
the Delaware River. He has an office in Milford, Pa., and a little tower a few 
miles away on the river, right at a prime shad-fishing bend. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, his job is to watch the Delaware to see how much water flows past 
each day. If the flow drops below a certain level, he orders the City of New 
York, which maintains several great reservoirs on the upper reaches of the 
river, to 
</P>
<P>
release water downstream instead of piping it east to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The rivermaster's job results from several decades of litigation between New 
York City and the communities, especially Philadelphia, near the mouth of the 
Delaware. Under the agreement, New York must release enough water to keep the 
"salt front" -- the ocean -- from advancing up the river. 
</P>
<P>
In normal times, the water pouring out of a river pushes the ocean back, but in 
a drought the reduced flow creates a vacuum, which the sea oozes in to fill. 
During the drought of the 1960s, said Harkness, the salt front nearly reached 
Philadelphia's water intakes. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't, but that's something you worry about," he said. "Everyone in Philly 
turning on a tap and getting salt water." 
</P>
<P>
The only problem with the present arrangement is that during a drought, when 
New York must release vast quantities of water down the Delaware to hold the 
salt front back, New Yorkers continue to take showers and wash their hands. 
</P>
<P>
During the last severe Northeastern drought, in the summer of 1985, city 
officials made up for the diminished flow from the Delaware by pumping water 
straight from the Hudson. This worked well -- the water turned out to be 
considerably cleaner than many had feared -- but as the flow of the Hudson was 
reduced, the salt front began to creep up that river, and the town fathers of 
Poughkeepsie became very worried about their supply getting salty. 
</P>
<P>
As the greenhouse warming kicks in, increased evaporation could steal 10%-24% 
of the water in New York's reservoirs, the EPA concluded; in addition, a 
1-meter sea-level rise could push the salt front up past the city's water 
intakes on the Hudson. In all, says the government, "doubled carbon dioxide 
could produce a shortfall equal to 28%-42% of planned supply in the Hudson 
River Basin." 
</P>
<P>
The expected effects of a sea-level rise typify the many consequences of a 
global warming. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, they are so big we literally can't understand them. If there 
is a significant polar melting, the Earth's center of gravity will shift, 
tipping the globe in such a way that the sea level might actually drop at Cape 
Horn and along the coast of Iceland -- I read this in a recent EPA report and 
found that I didn't really understand what it meant to tip the Earth, through I 
was awed by the idea. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the changes ultimately acquire a quite personal dimension: 
Should I put in a wall in front of my house? Does this taste salty to you? And, 
most telling of all, the human response to the problems, the utterly natural 
human attempt to preserve the old natural way of life in this post-natural 
world, creates entirely new consequences. The ocean rises; I build a wall; the 
marsh dies, and, with it, the fish. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, many of the various effects of the warming compound one another. 
If the weather grows hotter and I take more showers, more water must be 
diverted from the river, and the salt front moves upstream, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
The contradictions multiply almost endlessly (more air conditioning means more 
power generated means more water sucked from the rivers to cool the generators 
means less water flowing downstream, et cetera ad infinitum). 
</P>
<P>
These aren't the simple complications of, say, last summer when the hot weather 
drove everyone on the East Coast to the beaches, only to discover the tide of 
syringes. 
</P>
<P>
These contradictions are the result of throwing every single system into an 
uproar at the same time, so that none of nature's reliable compensations can be 
counted on.

LIVING A SCHIZOPHRENIC NIGHTMARE;

This is how one schizophrenic's sister explained his problem to her young 
children: "It's almost like when you go to sleep and you have a bad nightmare," 
she told them. "It's like he's in this bad dream, and he can't wake up." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Thompson, whose name and those of his family have been changed, is 33 years 
old; he has been hospitalized a number of times by the nightmare of 
schizophrenia. He is now in the hospital again, awaiting placement in a halfway 
house and another foray into living on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a revolving door," says his mother, Joanne, who seems remarkably 
placid for the 15-year ordeal that she and her family have been through. 
</P>
<P>
Families of schizophrenics bear much of the emotional and financial burden of 
this devastating illness. Most schizophrenics -- 70% by some estimates -- don't 
work, and many can't live alone, leaving their families to care for what is 
often a lifelong illness. 
</P>
<P>
For all the heartbreak involved, though, the Thompsons say that coping with 
Dan's illness has brought them closer together. 
</P>
<P>
Dan had a fairly normal childhood, his mother says, including Little League, 
friends, the works. But he was something of a problem in school. He misbehaved 
often, disrupting class and calling attention to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was no reason to suspect his disruptive behavior was the sign of a 
major mental illness. But when he was 16, life seemed to turn upside down. His 
father was dying of cancer; he did some minor experimenting in drugs; he joined 
a religious group and started preaching to people on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts believe that although stress does not cause schizophrenia, it can 
trigger an episode in those vulnerable or predisposed somehow to developing the 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson began talking about his mixed-up thoughts, and how he could not 
straighten them out. He was fearful and angry. There would be bizarre, 
frightening outbursts, seemingly unprompted by anything. 
</P>
<P>
"He would scream these blood-curdling screams," says one of his sisters. 
"Sometimes, we would hear him in his bedroom. He sounded like he was possessed, 
and he was saying these weird words. Or he'd come in while you were asleep and 
stare at you from the foot of the bed." 
</P>
<P>
He was diagnosed quite easily as schizophrenic, but finding the right treatment 
proved to be more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitalization, release, hospitalization again, drugs, electroshock therapy, 
megavitamins, prayers have all failed to totally quell his mind's frenetic 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
"He has scary thoughts," his mother says. "He'll be afraid to be alone at 
night. He'll be afraid he might hurt someone." 
</P>
<P>
When Thompson first was diagnosed, the family did not know where to turn for 
support or help. Instead, whatever the hospitals suggested, the family agreed 
to -- including electroshock, which his mother says that she would never agree 
to now. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing available," Joanne Thompson recalls. "I had to go to the 
library and look up the word schizophrenia." Eventually, she found other women 
in her same predicament. They formed a support network and now are part of the 
National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. 
</P>
<P>
The Thompsons have pursued all sorts of solutions, none entirely satisfactory, 
although Dan's current regimen of medication appears to be working better than 
past ones. 
</P>
<P>
While other families have drained their bank accounts in getting treatment for 
the illness -- by one estimate, the lifetime costs of treating a schizophrenic 
are likely to reach $300,000 -- Joanne Thompson says insurance has paid for 
much of Dan's treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Still, no amount of dollars can buy Thompson what he has lost, and will never 
have. 
</P>
<P>
"The saddest thing from a mother's point of view is seeing your child suffer," 
his mother says.

RANGER FINDS NICHE IN TEXAS LORE; 
</P>

LAW ENFORCEMENT: LEE ROY YOUNG HAS HELPED INTEGRATE THE HISTORICALLY WHITE 
RANKS OF THE NATION'S OLDEST STATE POLICING AGENCY.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At high noon, as Texas Ranger Lee Roy Young considers the Case of the Trash Can 
Bandit, he frowns down Farm Road 688 at the herd of Black Angus cattle grazing 
in a grove of mesquite and scrub oak. 
</P>
<P>
That's where the outlaw buried his loot. The Ranger says the bandit broke into 
a bank one night and lugged away $1,000 in quarters. And now the cops can't 
prove he did it. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy says the money is his life's savings," Young says. "Life savings, my 
foot." 
</P>
<P>
Young, his Size 7 white Stetson tugged tight over his eyes, cruises Kaufman 
County in a lime-green Chevrolet Caprice, past Adams Drug Store, past Forney 
Auto Supply, past Grandma's Fried Chicken where gizzards sizzle on the grill. 
</P>
<P>
"One riot, one Ranger," they used to say about the outfit that was as much a 
part of the Old West as six-guns and sagebrush. 
</P>
<P>
But life today on the trail in Texas isn't what it used to be on the frontier, 
when Rangers fought bloody feuds and battled barbed-wire fence cutters, lynch 
mobs, cattle rustlers and killers. 
</P>
<P>
These days, a Texas Ranger is more of a backwoods investigator, helping police 
and sheriffs in little places like Forney, population 4,200, tracking 
scoundrels like the Trash Can Bandit. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy breaks into the bank over here one night last August and steals all 
those quarters," Young says. "Coins were all he could get into. He puts the 
money in a trash can and carries it across the field and buries it out there in 
the brush. Then he goes back to Dallas and leaves it out there for over three 
months." 
</P>
<P>
The Texas Ranger's silver badge, a five-pointed lone star inside a circle, 
shines on his shirt over his heart. 
</P>
<P>
"He comes back in December and gets the money. He puts it in two tote bags, and 
I mean two heavy tote bags. You ever tried to carry $1,000 in quarters? He 
tries to steal a car up here off the Interstate to carry his loot back into 
Dallas, and that's when he got caught." 
</P>
<P>
The Texas Ranger's handcuffs hang from the hood latch down by his elephant-skin 
cowboy boots as his car crosses the east fork of the Trinity River, 21 miles 
southeast of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy's street-smart. He said, 'Prove it. Prove I stole that money.' A 
murderer will admit he's guilty quicker than a common old thief. We all know 
those coins came from that bank, but we never could take the case to a judge 
and a jury and say this guy did that crime. He wears gloves, see, so there's no 
fingerprints. We could never get any physical evidence to prove he did it. We 
had a lot of circumstantial evidence -- coin wrappers and all those quarters, 
about the same amount of money that had been stolen from the bank. But that's 
no good in court." 
</P>
<P>
The Texas Ranger's silver Colt .45 is holstered in leather on his left hip. A 
beeper rides his belt on the right. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy's been to the state prison three times. We know that he knows that we 
know that he stole that money. We just can't prove it. So we've got to assume, 
on his word, that it's actually his life's savings." 
</P>
<P>
The Texas Ranger rolls his eyes in disbelief up toward the top of the town 
water tower, where someone has painted, "I Love Louise." 
</P>
<P>
Today's 95 Texas Rangers, members of the nation's oldest state law-enforcement 
organization, are known worldwide as tough, elite peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers are often compared to other famed forces -- Scotland Yard, the FBI, 
Interpol and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. A Ranger used to shoot first 
and ask questions later, but no more. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, they wouldn't fool with this guy," Young says, laughing about 
the Trash Can Bandit. "Even 50 years ago, any policeman would have put him 
under a hot lamp, questioned him continuously for three days until he broke 
down and told the truth. They'd break out the rubber hoses. Under those 
conditions, you probably would have confessed to anything. I know I would 
have." 
</P>
<P>
Young has been a law-enforcement officer for almost 15 years -- 14 as a state 
trooper, and the past year as the first black officer in the 166-year history 
of the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
He's stationed at Ranger Company B headquarters in Garland, a suburb north of 
Dallas, and he's on the trail of a thief who stole 1,000 gallons of diesel 
fuel, another who got away with 50 TV sets, another who sold a couple of bales 
of marijuana, and another who stole $18,500 worth of tractors from a farm. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Rangers are charged with four duties: 
</P>
<P>
Protecting life and property by enforcing state criminal statutes; 
</P>
<P>
Suppressing riots and insurrections; 
</P>
<P>
Investigating major crimes; 
</P>
<P>
Apprehending fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
A modern Ranger doesn't often run into a riot, however. More often than not, a 
typical duty is the Case of the Trash Can Bandit, and being a Ranger has its 
frustrations, as Young knows and can recount. 
</P>
<P>
"You go out and beat your head against the wall, trying to do a good job, then 
you face all these obstacles -- courts and attorneys and such. We can't go back 
to the days of the rubber hose, but here's a guy we know broke into a bank and 
stole that money. We had to give all those quarters back to him. And you know 
what? He's free." 
</P>
<P>
Young was born 42 years ago, and grew up near the Texas-Mexico border playing 
cowboys and Indians. He was a Boy Scout. He was raised a Baptist, but now he's 
a Catholic. He's left-handed. He speaks fluent Spanish. He joined the Navy and 
saw the world. He went to a segregated school in Brackettville and grew up to 
graduate from the University of Texas. He's married and has two children and a 
basset hound named Barney and a cat named Gizmo. And the first black Texas 
Ranger is a George Bush man. 
</P>
<P>
Political controversy has trailed the Texas Rangers for a long time. They've 
been praised as freedom-fighters and heroes by some, while being criticized as 
bully boys by others. The NAACP has threatened to sue the Rangers for racial 
discrimination and some say the Rangers, part of the Texas Department of Public 
Safety, appointed Young in response to that threat. 
</P>
<P>
State public-safety officials say 22% of 2,500 commissioned officers are black, 
and two blacks have been promoted in recent years to the rank of captain. A 
statewide campaign has been launched to attract minority applicants, department 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The Texas Rangers not long ago named another black, Earl Ray Pearson, 34. The 
first Latino Ranger was appointed 20 years ago; now there are six. The Latino 
Rangers include Ray Martinez, who as an Austin policeman shot and killed 
University of Texas tower sniper Charles Whitman in 1966. A prospective Ranger 
must have eight years of law-enforcement experience. All current Rangers are 
men. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Bledsoe, president of the NAACP chapter in Austin, the state capital, says 
he's pleased that after 166 years, the Rangers finally appointed two blacks 
within six months, but he says racial discrimination still exists. Young 
applied 10 times for promotion during his 14 years as a DPS state trooper, 
Bledsoe says, but was turned down every time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear Lee Roy Young has been the subject of discrimination," Bledsoe 
says. "Somehow, he wasn't qualified for sergeant in the DPS, and then all of a 
sudden he qualifies as a Ranger. It just doesn't add up." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Scott, a state trooper from Houston, should have been the first black 
Texas Ranger, Bledsoe says. Twice Scott ranked first on the written Ranger 
exam, but finished far down after an oral interview. The NAACP official claims 
Scott was kept out of the Rangers because he has been outspoken about 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears," Bledsoe says, "there's a policy in the department saying, 'we're 
going to start promoting a few people because we have to, but we're going to 
promote people who don't complain or stand up for their rights, people who play 
by the rules of the game.' If it was not for Michael Scott, there never would 
have been a position created for Lee Roy Young." 
</P>
<P>
Back in Garland, Young drives his unmarked Chevy into the parking lot at 
Soulman's Barbecue for lunch. While eating a Bellybuster, a $3.69 beef, ham and 
sausage sandwich, Young says that, although he went to segregated schools in 
South Texas until he got to high school, his heroes were mostly white -- Roy 
Rogers and Dale Evans, Mickey Mantle and Elvis Presley. 
</P>
<P>
"It never occurred to me that they were white and I was black," he says. 
"That's part of the marvel of being young, I guess. You don't become aware of 
discrimination until you get older, then you see that whites live over there 
and we live over here." 
</P>
<P>
An armadillo painted on the wall peers down on Young and his Bellybuster. 
</P>
<P>
"It's evident that discrimination is part of our society. It bothers me, as it 
bothers most black people, but I'm not going to let it stop me. When you get 
knocked flat on your behind, you get right up and keep on fighting. At some 
point, I'd like to be judged as a Texas Ranger, not as a black Texas Ranger. 
But the fact that I'm the first black Ranger shows how much progress we still 
have to make as a people. We've got a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers were formed in 1823 by Stephen F. Austin, the "father of Texas," 
who hired 10 men to range across the territory to protect the first white 
settlers. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, they've survived arrows, guns and knives. Texas Rangers live on in 
song and story, cinema and television as strong, silent loners who all look 
like Gary Cooper or John Wayne or Lyndon B. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Young, 6-foot-1 and 200 pounds, is strong and silent -- he talks a lot in yups 
and nopes -- and, like most Rangers today, he works alone. "We depend on 
ourselves," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Young grew up shooting cap pistols and riding horses in cowboy and cactus 
country, but he hasn't sat in a saddle in five years. A Ranger doesn't wear a 
uniform, but he's easily recognized. "There's a saying that when a Ranger goes 
someplace, he stands out. You know he's a Ranger. It's the boots, the hat, the 
gun, the gun belt. We don't need a uniform. Most people in Texas recognize a 
Ranger." 
</P>
<P>
It's been said that next to the Alamo, the Texas Rangers are the state's 
best-known heritage. That may be true, but the facts suggest that Rangers 
didn't always keep their honor high or go by the law book. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Leander H. McNelly, generally acknowledged as the greatest Ranger of them 
all, mounted across-the-border raids against Mexicans more than a century ago. 
Gaines de Graffenried, curator of the Texas Ranger Museum and Hall of Fame in 
Waco, 100 miles south of Dallas, says McNelly's Rangers capped their campaign 
with perhaps the most famous action in the history of the corps, the Las Cuevas 
War. 
</P>
<P>
"They cleaned up South Texas and they cleaned it up fast," says de Graffenried, 
80, sitting in the shade of a water elm tree outside the museum on the banks of 
the Brazos River. "The first thing they did, they killed a bunch of Mexicans, 
didn't ask any questions, just stacked them up like cordwood. That put the fear 
of the Lord in all them bandits." 
</P>
<P>
Modern critics include Mexican-American field workers, who accused Rangers of 
brutality on the side of farm management during labor disputes in the Rio 
Grande Valley in the 1960s. Not a year goes by without someone, often a 
politician, urging that the Rangers be disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
Criticism doesn't bother most of the Rangers. "For everyone who don't like me," 
one old captain said before he died, "I got a lot more who do." 
</P>
<P>
Young and other Texas Rangers earn a base salary of $29,102 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not a lot of money," says Young's boss, Company B Capt. James A. 
Wright, who makes a base salary of $34,985. 
</P>
<P>
"In comparison with other police agencies, we're awful low. We're trying to get 
more money from the Legislature. We've had people quit or retire early in order 
to take another job to make more money. You can't blame them. A few years back, 
you would never have heard of a Texas Ranger quitting for anything." 
</P>
<P>
Modern Ranger crime-fighting tools include forensic labs, helicopters, 
airplanes and state-of-the-art surveillance systems. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, a Ranger's main tools were a horse and a saddle and a six-gun. 
For almost a century, they asked a prospective Ranger three questions: Can you 
ride? Can you shoot? Can you cook? Today, only one of those questions applies. 
Modern Rangers must qualify every six months on the firing range with a pistol, 
a rifle and a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
Young, like many Rangers, has never been in a gunfight. The closest he came was 
when he was a state trooper and he stopped a speeding car carrying three 
suspicious-looking men and a woman. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to myself, 'There's something wrong here.' I got them all out of the 
car, handcuffed them and took them back to jail. I found out the next day 
they'd killed a boy, cut him up with a knife and buried him under a culvert. 
There's no doubt in my mind that if they'd seen their way clear, they'd have 
ganged up on me. I didn't let that happen." 
</P>
<P>
During all the commotion about Young being the first black Texas Ranger, a 
friend reminded him, "Hell, you aren't the first black. You're the first Indian 
Texas Ranger." 
</P>
<P>
Young's great-grandfather was a black Seminole Indian, a frontier scout in the 
cavalry.

<P>
He's a moderately successful author slouched in a moderately comfortable chair 
in an immoderately expensive downtown hotel lobby, his latest book cradled on 
his chest like a small pet. 
</P>
<P>
He's a folklorist, someone who studies stories with the moderately confusing 
name of urban legends. He's been moderately entertaining as a guest on TV's 
"Late Night with David Letterman" no less than five times -- the last time out 
he actually corrected Letterman on the air. Still, he has been asked back. 
</P>
<P>
You might figure this guy can tell some kind of story. 
</P>
<P>
Figure again. See, it's all data to Jan Harold Brunvand, perhaps the nation's 
foremost purveyor of urban legend lore. He admits he has gotten better at story 
telling since he started to promote his first book, "The Vanishing Hitchhiker," 
in 1981. Still, he can't speak in broad, sweeping terms about the stories he 
studies. When he does speak, he takes pains to be precise. He didn't hear 
something from a few clergy, but two. His newspaper column does not appear in a 
bunch of newspapers, but 16. He says 16 carefully, so no one can think he said 
60. 
</P>
<P>
You have to be careful with urban legends. They are so unpredictable. Why, just 
a few years back, one particular urban legend was the hottest legend going. 
After a rest, it's back, hotter than ever, and Brunvand is hard pressed to 
explain exactly why. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the story: A well-known figure (initially, it was baseball superstar 
Reggie Jackson, but more recent incarnations have the figure being basketball 
superstar Isiah Thomas or actor Eddie Murphy) enters the elevator of an 
expensive hotel in, pick one, New York, Detroit or Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie-Isiah-Eddie is in the company of a large dog. Already in the elevator 
are three elderly ladies visiting the city. The Reggie-Isiah-Eddie character 
commands his dog, Lady, to sit, and the three elderly ladies comply, believing 
the command was directed at them, not the dog. In most versions of the elevator 
story, the women assume the man with the dog is about to rob them. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie-Isiah-Eddie realizes what has happened and apologizes at length to the 
three ladies, who eventually recognize the person with the dog. Some versions 
of the story have the Reggie-Isiah-Eddie character buying the three lunch and 
or dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised this elevator story is still so big," Brunvand said, taking a 
break from the 100th annual convention of the American Folklore Society held 
here. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent, two-week tour across the United States promoting his new book: 
"Curses, Broiled Again," (W.W. Norton; $17.98; 335 pp.), Brunvand said he heard 
a recently minted version of the elevator story in virtually every city he 
visited. 
</P>
<P>
Folklorists call these stories urban legends, although legend is an adequate 
enough title for them, Brunvand says. Typically, they are folk stories, meaning 
they are told rather than read, moving from person to person. Usually, they 
have some local or time references. 
</P>
<P>
Urban legends are also told as if true, even if there is no evidence to suggest 
that they are. Reggie Jackson, for one, has said he would never keep a dog in 
New York City, but despite Jackson's protestations, the story continues to be 
told. 
</P>
<P>
And, they are usually told by a person who has some relationship to the person 
or persons in the story. These people are friends of a friend (FOAF in folklore 
jargon) who was involved in the tale in question. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, these FOAFs are indirectly related to the teller. It isn't the 
storyteller's mother or father, for instance, but a friend of the storyteller's 
second cousin. 
</P>
<P>
The FOAF connection helps to authenticate the stories, but at the same time, 
FOAFs also serve as a foil, deflecting attempts at following a story back to 
the source. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most well-known urban legends is called "The Death Car" story. A 
person reads a classified advertisement in a local newspaper and sees a very 
expensive car being offered for sale at a very inexpensive price. The person 
calls the telephone number in the ad and sets up an appointment to see it. 
</P>
<P>
When the person does see the car, he realizes why the car is being offered for 
such a low price: the previous owner committed suicide in the car but the body 
was not discovered for some time. The car's interior has a horrible smell that 
cannot be removed, thus explaining the low price. 
</P>
<P>
Tanning beds were at the center of a formerly hot urban legend, which peaked in 
1987 and 1988. The title of his latest book is a reference to the legend. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the story vary, as those in urban legends tend to do, but the result 
is usually the same: a woman who wants a quick tan schedules extra sessions at 
the local tanning salon. She later discovers that her internal organs have been 
literally cooked. 
</P>
<P>
Brunvand gets most of his materials for his books or his twice-weekly newspaper 
column from people who mail him stories. He added his address at the back of 
his first book, "The Vanishing Hitchhiker," as an afterthought and he has been 
inundated with stories ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to say most of my study has been trying to frantically keep up with the 
mass of stories" he receives. "Sometimes, I'm faulted by folklorists for not 
doing enough analysis or interpretation. I don't always think of these things, 
I'll confess that, but I have really been overwhelmed by the amount of 
material." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the network of people who send Brunvand clippings and provide tales, he 
also gets information from a daily reading of Dear Abby, Ann Landers and Mike 
Royko. A colleague sends him copies of Herb Caen, columnist for The San 
Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
He's even contemplated getting two subscriptions to every supermarket tabloid 
(two, incidently, so he can clip articles from both sides of the page), but 
Brunvand says that's quite a bit of trash to wade through to get to the gems.

CANADA PUTS WOMEN ON FRONT LINE; 
</P>
<P>
COMBAT: MANY GOVERNMENTS SEND WOMEN INTO COMBAT DURING WAR. CANADA, HOWEVER, IS 
RECRUITING WOMEN DURING PEACETIME.

<P>
Army Pvt. Pasqualina Petruzzi's eyes were riveted on her drill instructor. 
"This is how to take out a sentry!" bellowed the instructor, using a husky 
young private for the demonstration. "Legs in front. Arm around neck until he 
chokes or until you break his neck. If you don't have a knife, kick him in the 
back of the head. It takes three kicks to kill." 
</P>
<P>
"I love this part," Petruzzi said later, sitting on the grass outside her field 
tent. "My friends were worried about me leaving the good stuff in civilian 
life. They said, 'You'll always have dirty fingernails.' It didn't bother me. I 
was never into makeup." 
</P>
<P>
The Montreal native -- "Truzzi" to her buddies -- was training to become a 
combat infantry soldier in the Canadian armed forces, a pioneer on the front 
lines of a political and military revolution that has stirred controversy in 
her country and attracted worldwide attention. 
</P>
<P>
Canada, in a bold move that has pushed it to the leading edge of equal-rights 
movements, has abolished laws barring women from combat and earlier this year 
opened all military jobs, except on submarines, to females. Women now can serve 
as infantry troops, fighter pilots and sailors on navy destroyers. 
</P>
<P>
Canada, like Norway, Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands, thus has taken a 
political, military and social leap so radical that even the most ardent 
supporters of women's equality in the armed forces of the United States 
hesitate to emulate out of fear of the reaction by Congress and the American 
people. 
</P>
<P>
While many governments have sent women into combat during war or national 
crisis, the unusual peacetime initiatives in Canada and other nations to 
welcome women to front-line duty are the result of a wave of 
anti-discrimination laws and a declining pool of male recruits available for 
military service. 
</P>
<P>
In Canada, a wave of new laws beginning with the 1978 Human Rights Act forced 
liberal new mandates on employers nationwide, from the private sector to the 
military. The law's application to the issue of women in combat has proven the 
most difficult. There were dire predictions of rampant sex among the troops, a 
sudden decline in military readiness and a female force unable to survive the 
rigorous demands of a combat environment. 
</P>
<P>
"I simply do not believe you can take a mixed ship's company of young healthy 
Canadians off for several months without sexual relationships being formed, or 
for that matter an army formation in the field," wrote retired Vice Adm. D.N. 
Mainguy, in the military journal, Legion. "When does the desire for a man or 
woman to protect their love start to interfere with combat performance?" 
</P>
<P>
In response, the Canadian military plodded through a seemingly endless battery 
of studies, surveys and experiments to scrutinize the impact of women in combat 
units. Canada has an all-volunteer military of about 82,800 enlisted and 
officers in all three services -- less than half the size of the U.S. Marine 
Corps. But it also claims the second-highest percentage of women members in the 
world -- 10%, exceeded only by the U.S. armed forces, which are 10.7% female. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't just pluck a few servicewomen into an infantry battalion, or post a 
few female sailors to a destroyer, drop in a year later to ask the commanding 
officer how it went and submit our findings," said Brig. Gen. D.E. Munro, 
director general of the Combat Related Employment of Women. 
</P>
<P>
The considerations in opening combat assignments to women were numerous: 
Scientists studied the effects of gravity forces on women fighter pilots, and 
psychologists designed elaborate counseling programs for men who would be 
working alongside women for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, when the military believed it was ready to experiment with its first 
women combat troops last year, the plans almost fizzled. The military spent 
$500,000 trying to recruit 249 women for the three-year field tests. The effort 
attracted only 26. 
</P>
<P>
Editorial writers had a field day. The Spectator newspaper, in an editorial 
headlined, "The 26-woman Army," scoffed: "Militant feminists demanded equal 
access for women in army combat units. . . . The feeble response to the army's 
very expensive recruiting campaign suggests it's time to stop wasting time and 
money trying to beat reality into the shape of a feminist ideal. Even the army 
can't defeat human nature." 
</P>
<P>
Last fall the first batch of women infantry candidates arrived at Princess 
Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Battle School here on the rolling plains of 
central Alberta for their first 16 weeks of intensive training. 
</P>
<P>
The men braced for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought there would be all kinds of female problems," said Col. Hap Stutt, 
commander of the training camp. "Some of the officers thought we'd be doing 
candy Boy Scout exercises because of the women. The first couple of weeks 
everybody came to work thinking everything would be different. Everything was 
the same." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, after a few weeks, Stutt dispatched a report to his superiors titled, 
"The Sky Isn't Falling." 
</P>
<P>
There was, however, one serious problem. Even the most vocal supporters of the 
effort to train women for combat were stunned by the women's shortcomings in 
physical ability and stamina. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 60 women recruited for the Canadian infantry since last year, only one 
has successfully completed the 16-week training program and is serving in the 
infantry, according to Cmdr. Judith Harper, director of CREW. 
</P>
<P>
Here, where all the women infantry recruits have trained, the evidence of the 
problem was obvious up and down the obstacle course of high walls, thick ropes 
-- and aching muscles. 
</P>
<P>
Pvt. Michele (Shelly) Harris, rifle slung over her back, was doing the commando 
crawl, hand over hand across a thick rope suspended above the hard dirt. 
Suddenly her face reddened, her eyes squeezed shut, and she slipped, dangling 
awkwardly above the earth. She hit the ground with a thud. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, a copper-haired private dubbed "Duracell" by her colleagues, clambered 
to her feet and hoisted herself back onto the rope. Another grimace, another 
thud. The crowd of privates sitting on the sidelines chanted, "You can do it! 
Duracell -- energize!" 
</P>
<P>
A third failed attempt, and a sympathetic drill instructor sent her back to the 
sidelines. She sank to the ground, eyes brimming with tears of frustration and 
humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
"The women aren't in as good a shape as the men," said Pvt. Kirby Maciver. "At 
almost every obstacle, the man gets up first to help the women over." 
</P>
<P>
A few hours after her failed attempt at the commando crawl, Harris, 20, seemed 
undaunted. She joined the army because "I wanted something better in my future" 
than staying home working at a menial job in her native New Brunswick. "It's a 
big challenge," she said. "But this is what I joined for." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Harris never graduated from the program and now is an army truck 
driver. Her colleague, Petruzzi, who relished tough training and life in the 
field, also flunked and was reassigned to the military police. 
</P>
<P>
Pvt. J.D. Burtch, who went through training with Harris, complained: "I don't 
think women should be here. I feel they should be in the army, but not in the 
infantry. They slow us down. I wouldn't feel confident with them in combat. . . 
. I'll admit it -- I'm a chauvinist." 
</P>
<P>
Military leaders see another problem. Harper, at Canadian national defense 
headquarters in Ottawa, said some military officials are concerned that the 
high cost of infantry training for women has yielded such poor results. The 
high failure rates also hamper the military's efforts to set useful recruiting 
goals, she said. 
</P>
<P>
To screen out enlistees who have no chance of success in the strenuous combat 
infantry program, according to Harper, the military is developing physical 
standards for male and female infantry recruits. 
</P>
<P>
In most other combat fields, women have fared as well as, or better than the 
men, Canadian officials said. But because the integrated programs are so new, 
the number of women who have applied is too small to draw concrete, general 
conclusions. Ten women have entered artillery training and seven have 
graduated. Four women currently are training for tank crews, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Canadian navy, 60 women sailors and officers are serving on 
replenishment ships and a tender vessel, and many of the women are scheduled to 
be transferred soon to a destroyer that is being modified to bunk a 
mixed-gender crew. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian air force now has the first two women fighter pilots in the world 
assigned to potential combat missions in fighter squadrons. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government has said it hopes to fully integrate its forces within 
the next 10 years. The number of female recruits already has increased to 13% 
from 9% of all new enlistees in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
And many problems raised by opponents of the integration program have not 
materialized. To the endless speculation over potential romances in the 
barracks, the women of the mixed-gender infantry training platoon at Camp 
Wainwright roll their eyes and respond: "We call the army-issue boxer shorts 
the men wear 'passion killers.' " 
</P>
<P>
At this remote buffalo-reserve-turned-military-training-camp, the men and women 
of Ypres Platoon (Canadian platoons are named for great battles rather than the 
numbers assigned to U.S. platoons) share a Spartan barracks. Long rows of metal 
bunk beds line each side of the building. A thin, blue-and-white plastic shower 
curtain separates the last few beds in the row where the women sleep. Inside 
the communal bathroom, another plastic curtain is drawn around the men's 
urinals. 
</P>
<P>
The etiquette of sharing such close quarters has created mostly minor problems. 
At the end of their third week together, platoon leaders said the men and women 
were quarreling so much in the evening -- over such things as the women taking 
too long in the showers, men leaving the barracks too messy, or everybody 
chattering too much after lights out -- that it was affecting their daytime 
performance on the training field. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Patrick Lawler came up with a quick solution: extra training and no leave 
on the weekends. The bickering volume quickly lowered. 
</P>
<P>
The women remained unwelcome anomalies to some men at this previously all-male 
outpost. The camp's civilian barber, after years of shaving male heads, refused 
to clip the locks of women recruits. Base officials scrambled and found another 
civilian barber in town who was willing to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
In the mess hall, the men and women move through the chow line, heaping their 
plates with starchy military fare, then cluster at tables in separate groups. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still trying to figure out how to make them think they're all together," 
Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
Back out on the training fields, army Pvt. Tana Fix, 20, of British Columbia 
had more immediate concerns. She sprawled on her belly in the dust, fighting a 
helmet that insisted on slipping over her eyes and a rifle that refused to hit 
the bull's-eye on the paper target downrange. 
</P>
<P>
"You're all over the place," groused the rifle instructor, squinting at the 
bullet holes sprinkled across the target circles. "Concentrate!" 
</P>
<P>
Fix, face smudged with dirt, clutched her C-7 rifle and groaned, "Oh, man. If 
Mom could see me now."

Move over, Machiavelli. 
</P>
<P>
The current bible of play-to-win strategists is no longer that 16th-Century 
Italian author's "The Prince," but the much older writings of the Chinese 
military tactician Sun Tzu, assembled as "The Art of War." 
</P>
<P>
Sun Tzu's writings finally reached the Western world in the late 18th Century 
and were reputedly followed by the Soviet Red Army, the Japanese military, 
Vietnamese guerrilla leader Ho Chi Minh and Chinese revolutionary leader Mao 
Tse-tung. 
</P>
<P>
The works drew little attention in the United States until recent years, but 
have been become increasingly popular. For example: 
</P>
<P>
Republican Party Chairman Lee Atwater, perhaps the most hard-nosed political 
strategist of this decade, is a devotee who reads "The Art of War" before every 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Airlines machinists union leader Charles E. Bryan, one of the airline 
industry's most powerful and most controversial labor heads this decade, hands 
out copies of the Sun Tzu text to all his organization's general chairmen. 
</P>
<P>
In director Oliver Stone's movie "Wall Street," Oscar-winning actor Michael 
Douglas' "greed is good" character, Gordon Gekko, advises his protege: "Read 
Sun Tzu, 'The Art of War.' 'Every battle is won before it's fought.' Think 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
Stone, in Los Angeles finishing "Born on the Fourth of July," about the life of 
Vietnam War double-amputee Ron Kovic and his anti-war crusade, said that 
although "The Art of War" isn't yet widely read on Wall Street, it was 
appropriate to the thinking of Gekko, "ruthless, yet accurate." As did Sun Tzu, 
Gekko emphasized the importance of information and the use of spies. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater, who recently read "The Art of War" for the 20th-plus time on a flight 
from Washington to San Francisco, calls the book "the most succinct strategy 
document ever written." 
</P>
<P>
'You Can Relate' 
</P>
<P>
"Everything in it you can relate to my profession, you can relate to the 
campaign," Atwater says. "Every time I read it, I am reminded of something very 
important." 
</P>
<P>
Some scholars consider "The Art of War" common sense put on paper and don't 
quite understand its current popularity. 
</P>
<P>
"It was always around and I personally find it to be a collection of little 
aphorisms," says June Dreyer, a University of Miami professor of political 
science and a student of Chinese military history. "For example, he says: 'Know 
your enemy and know yourself.' I think every ghetto kid in Chicago is thinking 
that before he gets into a fight." 
</P>
<P>
Dreyer suspects that one of the reasons the book is so popular is that "there's 
a certain panache to quoting an ancient Chinese author." 
</P>
<P>
Sun Tzu's emphasis on the aspects of psychology, information-gathering, 
deception, planning and limiting casualties are applied to many cases by his 
students. History, they point out, is full of examples of how leaders failed to 
follow the basic rules of Sun Tzu. 
</P>
<P>
James Clavell, the author and screenplay writer who has studied Chinese and 
Japanese military thought, wrote in a foreword to one of the English 
translations: 
</P>
<P>
"I truly believe that if our military and political leaders in recent times had 
studied this work of genius, Vietnam could not have happened as it happened. 
</P>
<P>
"We would not have lost the war in Korea (we lost because we did not achieve 
victory), the Bay of Pigs could not have occurred; the hostage fiasco in Iran 
would not have come to pass; the British Empire would not have been 
dismembered, and in all probability, World Wars I and II would have been 
avoided -- certainly they would not have been waged as they were waged, and the 
millions of youths obliterated unnecessarily and stupidly by monsters calling 
themselves generals would have lived out their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Little is known about the personal background of Sun Tzu, an adviser and 
general for Chinese warlords. Scholars have differed on when he wrote his guide 
to warfare, with some saying the 7th Century BC and others saying the 3rd 
Century. And some have argued that he never existed at all and that "The Art of 
War" is a compilation. 
</P>
<P>
Sun Tzu wrote that "moral law" -- belief in the cause and in the leaders -- is 
crucial to victory, as is command discipline. The object is not to devastate 
the enemy, but to win with as little actual engagement as possible, he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Among his teachings: 
</P>
<P>
"To fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme 
excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting." 
</P>
<P>
"All warfare is based on deception." 
</P>
<P>
"In war, numbers alone confer no advantage. Do not advance relying on sheer 
military power." 
</P>
<P>
"While we have heard of blundering swiftness in war, we have not yet seen a 
clever operation that was prolonged." 
</P>
<P>
"War is a matter of vital importance to the state . . . It is mandatory that it 
be thoroughly studied." 
</P>
<P>
"If you know your enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a 
hundred battles." 
</P>
<P>
A desire to know his foe led Bryan, the union leader, to "The Art of War" some 
10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
'Mostly Lessons' 
</P>
<P>
"There was a rumor that management was using that book," said Bryan, who bought 
copies for himself and his union leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mostly lessons, more on understanding and anticipating the strategy of an 
adversary and being prepared to deal with it," said Bryan, who in 1983 took his 
union to the brink of a strike before management gave in with a favorable 
contract. In 1986 he was blamed by Eastern officials for forcing the sale of 
Eastern to Texas Air Corp., and this year he led the strike against Eastern 
that began March 4. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan emphasizes gathering information about the company and management and 
usually keeps his strategy as secret as possible, both Sun Tzu-type attributes. 
The strategies of Bryan, also based on personal philosophical and religious 
beliefs, have come under fire as Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo follows a 
plan to rebuild Eastern without its unions. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater, who first read "The Art of War" while a University of South Carolina 
graduate student, read it again this summer and savored how Sun Tzu's 
guidelines had been followed in the 1988 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"He talks in there repeatedly about keeping your own group united," Atwater 
says. "One of the driving things of the Bush campaign was keeping united." 
</P>
<P>
Atwater says the importance of laying out a strategy and sticking to it, as 
taught by Sun Tzu, was demonstrated in the Super Tuesday strategy in which Bush 
effectively locked up the Republican nomination with his domination of the 
South. The plan to use the South to defeat Bush's opponents had been planned 
for three years, Atwater says. 
</P>
<P>
One of Atwater's favorite Sun Tzuisms is: "When you get into the mind of your 
opponent, you can move it." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about deception and other Sun Tzu tactics, Atwater chuckles. "You'll have 
to get someone else to make observations on that." 
</P>
<P>
Atwater also read and was influenced by Machiavelli, best known for advising 
the powerful that the end justifies the means in gaining and maintaining power. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Sun Tzu is a highly refined version of 'The Prince,' " Atwater says. 
</P>
<P>
"The Art of War" can be found these days in U.S. military study libraries, and 
is on a suggested reading list the U.S. Marine Corps compiled this year. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Lt. Col. Fred Peck says Sun Tzu's writings contrast in approach to 
another highly recommended war strategy work, "On War," by the 19th-Century 
Prussian military author Karl von Clausewitz. Clausewitz's teachings, contained 
in 10 to 12 volumes, also combine social, political and personal factors with 
military strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Clausewitz presents his theories "at extreme length and in excruciating 
detail," Peck says. 
</P>
<P>
'Primer for Warlords' 
</P>
<P>
"Sun Tzu wrote his book as a primer for warlords. It's got a lot of pithy 
little advice, a lot lighter reading." 
</P>
<P>
Samuel B. Griffith, a retired Marine brigadier general who translated and 
published Sun Tzu three decades ago after writing about China's civil war, 
wrote that "The Art of War" should be "required reading for those who hope to 
gain a further understanding of the grand strategy" of both the Soviet and the 
Chinese leadership. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dreyer says, Chinese leaders apparently don't follow Sun Tzu today. 
Their bloody quelling of the summer's student protests goes against "The Art of 
War" philosophy that says the government must serve the people's interest and 
maintain national unity.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: A DOG FOR DAD? ASK HIM FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My father, who's 75, always wanted a pet, but my mother was 
allergic so they never had one during their marriage. Unfortunately, my mother 
died six months ago, and my father is having a difficult time adjusting. My 
husband and I are wondering about buying him a dog. Is this a good idea? 
</P>
<P>
 -- B.L. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR B.L.: It might be great, but I certainly wouldn't do anything until you've 
talked it over with him first. It's important to find out if he can have a pet 
where he lives and also to consider if he's able to give an animal the care and 
attention it needs. 
</P>
<P>
Having a dog is a responsibility, as well as a joy. Just as with humans, it 
takes time for relationships to build. Puppies always need to be housebroken. 
Even well-trained, older dogs may make mistakes for the first night or two 
while getting adjusted to a new person and a new home. 
</P>
<P>
If your father is able to walk the dog, this would probably be good for him, as 
well as for the animal. It would get him out of the house and give him a new 
interest. You might want to think about getting an older dog, one who's gentle 
and trained and one whose disposition and temperament would blend well with 
your father. 
</P>
<P>
Studies show that good pets help to alleviate loneliness, and stroking pets can 
lower the blood pressure. If your father is contemplating a move, however, it 
might be better to wait until he's settled. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I think my 34-year-old son is making a terrible mistake, but 
there's not much use of my talking to him because he never listens to his 
father. He's about to pass up a promotion in order to have more time to stay at 
home with his two children. He tells me this isn't as unusual as it was in my 
day. It seems absurd to me. This isn't a man's role. He has a wife, and even 
though she works, it seems to me he's trying to do her job. 
</P>
<P>
 -- L.C. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR L.C.: Your son is correct when he reports that more and more young fathers 
are choosing to be good fathers first and are placing their families ahead of 
their jobs. Many of these men do this because they feel they didn't get to see 
enough of their own fathers in their childhood and are determined to be closer 
to their children than their fathers were to them. 
</P>
<P>
There's no question about it, we're living through a social revolution when it 
comes to sex roles. Men used to define themselves and their role in society as 
the breadwinner, but men are no longer the only breadwinners. Many children are 
being raised in two-career families, such as your son's, and when this is the 
case, both partners frequently find themselves making some sacrifices in 
furthering their careers in order to be better parents.

SPILLING THE BEANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Only a short while ago I never would have believed some of the foods 
that are being recommended today as part of a healthy diet. I always used to 
think that pasta and potatoes had to be avoided, but now I can understand that 
these are nutritious foods. Now I see that beans have become a kind of glamour 
food. Is this just a fad, or do beans belong in the average diet? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Beans are a nutritious food that have the added advantage of providing 
a great deal of fiber. They also lend themselves to being served in combination 
with a variety of animal foods, such as meat, fish, poultry, eggs, milk and 
cheese, as well as with non-animal foods, such as peas and lentils. These 
combinations provide a complete protein. 
</P>
<P>
Still another advantage is that beans are an economical food, a consideration 
that cannot be ignored. Furthermore, they do not contain unwanted fat or salt. 
</P>
<P>
One of the criticisms often heard about beans is that they cause gas. While 
this is true, this effect can be reduced by adding beans to the diet gradually, 
as well as by the manner in which they are prepared.

SLEEPY STORES HOPE PLAYS ARE THE THING; 
</P>
<P>
VENTURA HARBOR: RETAILERS AND RESTAURATEURS SAY A THEATER COMPANY MAY WAKE UP 
BUSINESS. THE MUCH-TRAVELED TROUPE GETS NEW LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials at financially troubled Ventura Harbor hope a resident theater troupe 
will enliven slack sales and restaurant business when it opens its doors on New 
Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Theater-by-the-Sea, an enterprise that over the years has failed to take root 
at several Ventura County locations, will try again in a ground-floor space at 
Ventura Harbor Village, below Hornblower's restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Port District trustees recently approved a one-year lease with 
Elizabeth Harris, the theater's founder and director of the Ventura County 
Repertory Theater, which will supply its talent. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the village is struggling," said Richard Parsons, general manager of 
the Ventura Port District, which acquired control of the harbor buildings 
through the bankruptcy of their developer. "We need things like the theater to 
draw people down there." 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the harbor's gross revenue increased by only $200,000, from 
$10.9 million to $11.1 million, said Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not even enough to keep up with inflation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Harris sees the 2,000-square-foot space as the ideal spot -- not 
only as a long-term home for her itinerant Repertory Theater, but also as a 
location that offers a real night out in Ventura: a live performance and late 
night supper, possibly with package discount deals she hopes to arrange with 
harbor restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so happy we're going to be there," said Harris, who will continue her 
children's theater classes in the new space. 
</P>
<P>
Harris and Newman Properties, Harbor Village's property manager, this week were 
negotiating final details of a contract. In addition to regular performances 
paid for by patrons, the theater company will be hired by the harbor to provide 
free children's shows, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
For a small theater, the rent is a bit stiff at $1,979 per month plus 2% of 
gross sales, she said. But the contract for the children's performances will 
ensure a steady cash flow. Still, Harris admits to pangs of envy over Ventura's 
Plaza Players city-subsidized $200,000 move from a former church on Santa Clara 
Street, an area that is being redeveloped by the city, into new digs in the 
remodeled Livery Building on Palm Street. 
</P>
<P>
"When I read about the extent of the help they got, I wept," said Harris, 39, a 
10-year veteran of theater in Ventura. "They deserved what they got. But I was 
green with envy -- I hated the position I was in." 
</P>
<P>
Harris learned the theater trade in off-Broadway productions and character 
acting in Hollywood before she founded the Repertory Theater in 1979. She began 
with the original 40-seat Theater-by-the-Sea next to the Ventura Theater on 
South Chestnut. When the lease was up in 1983, the owners declined to renew and 
the company moved into what is now Art Deco, a women's boutique on East Main 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
After only a year, city building inspectors said major repairs were needed 
there to meet safety codes, and the company hit the road again. This time the 
group landed at Bard Memorial Hospital, a Ventura hillside landmark that was 
the county's first hospital. But monthly rent of $2,600 drove them out, Harris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris moved to Oxnard, where she set up an office and teaching studios in a 
large Victorian house downtown. The troupe began performing melodrama in a 
building near the La Gloria Market, but that effort failed when cars were 
vandalized in the parking lot, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Next, the company began performing at the Oxnard Civic Auditorium, but was 
edged out by another theater group. Last year, the company performed dinner 
theater at Ottavio's banquet room in Camarillo, but the limited menu lost its 
appeal to theatergoers quickly, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
"I look like some kind of Gypsy, flitting from one thing to another," Harris 
said. "The truth is I don't like change. I never wanted to move from the 
Ventura Theater location. But I'm a survivor. I go with the flow and I'll go 
wherever I have to to do the work." 
</P>
<P>
The group recently signed a five-year contract with the county for Shakespeare 
and other classical performances at Foster Park in Ojai. Harris plans to 
continue to use Foster for large productions and its annual two-week summer 
theater camp. 
</P>
<P>
She will reserve the 99-seat "equity-waiver" Theater-by-the-Sea for more 
intimate dramas and comedies. Theaters with fewer than 100 seats can use 
professional actors without paying union wages. 
</P>
<P>
The reopening will be bittersweet, with the memories it evokes of lost leases 
and opportunities. But Harris hopes for the best. 
</P>
<P>
"We think this will make everybody happy," she said.

COUNTY REVOKES PERMIT FOR GRAVEL HAULER BECAUSE OF TRUCK PROBLEMS; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: SOMIS SAND AND ROCK INC. TRUCKS MADE 300 ROUND-TRIPS DAILY ON A 
TWO-LANE ROAD. RESIDENTS SAID THE TRUCKS WERE HAZARDOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Under pressure from residents upset about truck traffic, the Ventura County 
Board of Supervisors has revoked the operating permit of a Somis dirt- and 
gravel-hauling company. 
</P>
<P>
The decision means that Somis Sand and Rock Inc. either must close its quarry 
business in Balcom Canyon or, to keep its permit, comply with numerous county 
requirements, including curtailing about half of its operations. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Atkinson, an attorney for the gravel company, and company owner Dave 
Smith declined to comment after Tuesday's action. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisor James Dougherty called the operation a public nuisance, because 
of the danger posed by its trucks. In addition, Dougherty said, the company did 
not attempt to negotiate or take responsibility for any problems raised by 
citizens or county officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to give a clear message: Don't come to this county and say, 'I 
want to do business here, but I'm not responsible,' " Dougherty said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Blacher, a spokesman for Citizens for a Safe Balcom Canyon Road, the 
neighborhood group seeking the permit revocation, said he was pleased by the 
board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"They saw that the issues of public safety are overriding and that the operator 
was uncooperative. This was rampant neglect of public safety," said Blacher, a 
former head of the Ventura County Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
The residents were appealing an October action by the county Planning 
Commission, which imposed a series of restrictions on the operation. Blacher, a 
16-year resident in Balcom Canyon, said his group thought the Planning 
Commission had not gone far enough in limiting truck traffic on narrow, winding 
Balcom Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Truck drivers were forced to use the two-lane road to haul loads from the 
quarry about three miles to California 118 after the only alternate route, 
Bradley Road, was closed to trucks in February. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said the 60-foot trucks jeopardized cars, school buses, postal 
vehicles and agricultural vehicles because they often crossed into oncoming 
traffic lanes to manage corners. The group said excessive speeds and aggressive 
driving, noise, air pollution and high dust levels contributed to the problems. 
</P>
<P>
Blacher cited California Highway Patrol statistics to indicate that there was a 
high accident rate involving trucks in the area, including a fatal accident 
involving a Somis Sand and Rock truck in 1987 and a head-on collision involving 
two of the company's trucks last April. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the Planning Commission restricted the gravel company's operating 
hours and trimmed truck traffic to 300 daily round-trips. The commission forced 
the company to put tarps over trucks if dirt came within one foot of their tops 
and to pay for widening the intersection of California 118 and Balcom Canyon 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
Blacher said that in a nine-hour workday, the approved 300 round-trips amounted 
to a truck traveling on Balcom Canyon Road every 1.8 minutes. He added that the 
trucks caused traffic jams during peak hours and threatened children getting on 
and off school buses.

HUGE WESTLAKE VILLAGE PROJECT NEARS APPROVAL; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: COUNCIL AND BUILDERS REACH AGREEMENT ON LARGEST PROJECT IN CITY 
HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Westlake Village City Council and a developer reached an agreement last 
week under which the council will approve Westlake North, the largest 
development in the city's history, in exchange for a package of concessions the 
builder valued at $31.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The keys to the agreement were pledges by the developer, Westlake Village 
Associates, to preserve the town's golf course and to reduce the height of the 
project's tallest office buildings to four stories. 
</P>
<P>
After two evenings of public hearings that ran past midnight, three of the five 
City Council members said they would vote to approve the project at a meeting 
next Tuesday. The residential and commercial development would be built on 129 
acres of vacant land north of the Ventura Freeway and east of Lindero Canyon 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
"I am personally compelled to vote for the project as it has come into focus in 
the past two days," Mayor Franklin D. Pelletier said. Councilmen Kenneth E. 
Rufener and Irwin A. Shane said they would vote for the project. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwomen Bonnie Klove and Berniece E. Bennett said they needed time to 
decide, but Klove said: "I'm very happy with what I heard tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Westlake North would include 250 condominiums and more than 1.4 million square 
feet of commercial space, with office buildings, a hotel and a shopping center. 
The four-story height limit is a departure from the two-story limit in the city 
general plan. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Westlake Village Associates, a firm run by Daniel K. Ludwig, would 
contract with the city to: 
</P>
<P>
Pay nearly $6.5 million for road improvements, in addition to giving up $2.9 
million worth of land for road purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Pay the city $3.5 million, which could be used for a new library and other 
projects, such as storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
Build within Westlake North a four-acre park, with soccer and softball fields, 
viewing stands, parking and lighting. 
</P>
<P>
Guarantee for 200 years the preservation and maintenance of the developer-owned 
Westlake Village Golf Course and its driving range. 
</P>
<P>
Pelletier said the road improvements, such as widening the Ventura Freeway 
interchange at Lindero Canyon Road, are needed to accommodate an unavoidable 
increase in future traffic from other projects outside the city. Three offers 
from other investors to purchase the golf course from Westlake Village 
Associates made the guaranteed preservation of the course imperative, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pelletier did not seek reelection this year, and Shane was defeated. They leave 
office Dec. 6 when James E. Emmons and Douglas R. Yarrow are seated. 
</P>
<P>
Emmons and Yarrow had been critical of the project during their campaigns, but 
that was before the developer's concessions were made public. After the 
hearing, Yarrow said he could support the project, and Emmons said it was 
"moving in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
Westlake North would be built on the last large piece of vacant land in the 
planned city, which was incorporated in 1981. The horseshoe-shaped property 
surrounds the Valley Oaks Memorial Park cemetery. Compared to Thousand Oaks and 
Agoura Hills, Westlake Village has a relatively small commercial tax base, 
which the Westlake North development would broaden. 
</P>
<P>
The developer's original proposal was for 1.5 million square feet of commercial 
space -- including two six-story buildings -- and 400 condominiums. Before the 
hearings Wednesday and Thursday at Westlake Village City Hall, the firm cut its 
requested building height to five stories, the number of condominiums to 250 
and the total commercial square footage by 6%. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the biggest thing this city has ever seen or ever will see," said James 
B. Henderson, a 22-year resident. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the speakers at the public hearing, which was attended by an overflow 
crowd, said five-story buildings were not a fair trade for the golf course, 
which some said the developer was using as "a shotgun to our heads." 
</P>
<P>
"Four- and five-story buildings on one side of the freeway more than negate the 
golf course on the other side of the freeway," resident Allyson Hoare said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Westlake North negotiator Charles H. Fry clung to a five-story 
height limit, but on Thursday, he won council support by coming down to four 
stories and by adding the driving range to the plan to preserve the golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people are feeling a lot better about the project if they were there last 
night," Henderson said of the meeting. "There was negotiating going on right in 
front of God and everybody. . . . It's probably about as good a deal as the 
city is going to get."

PROGRAM TO OFFER DRIVERS NON-ALCOHOL FREE DRINKS; 
</P>
<P>
PREVENTION: TWENTY BARS AND RESTAURANTS HAVE AGREED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE JOINT 
EFFORT TO LESSEN HOLIDAY DRINKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Designated drivers for groups of people can celebrate the holidays in Ventura 
County with free drinks -- free non-alcoholic drinks, that is. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurants and bars involved in the Ventura County Designated Driver Program, 
which began Wednesday, will provide free non-alcoholic drinks to designated 
drivers as part of a joint effort by law enforcement agencies, community 
organizations and businesses, Mothers Against Drunk Drivers and Assemblyman 
Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria). 
</P>
<P>
"This program's key is prevention," O'Connell said. "It's not after the fact." 
</P>
<P>
So far, 20 restaurants and bars, which will absorb all costs, have signed up. 
An establishment can be identified as a participant by a poster hanging inside 
the building's entrance. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell said Orange County and Santa Barbara County have similar programs. He 
said Santa Barbara's program started in June, 1988, with 12 members and has 
grown to 50. Alcohol-related collisions have dropped 11% in that time, although 
those statistics are not directly related to the program, O'Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
County establishments in the program are: Bombay Bar and Grill in Ventura, 
Doubletree Hotel in Ventura, Holiday Inn in Ventura, Shakey's Pizza in Ventura 
and Simi Valley, Tony's Steak and Seafood in Ventura, Garfield's Bar and Grill 
in Ventura, Hornblower's in Ventura, Hungry Hunter in Ventura and Thousand 
Oaks, The Peppermill in Santa Paula, Seafood Parlor and Saloon in Camarillo, 
Oxnard and Thousand Oaks, Azar's Red Robin Restaurant in Newbury Park, Cisco's 
Mexican Restaurant in Westlake Village, Jessie Cate's Restaurant in Thousand 
Oaks and Yolanda's in Ventura and Oxnard.

BASKETBALL: VENTURA COLLEGE SOPHOMORE IS BATTLING BACK AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS 
BROTHER.; 
</P>
<P>
VENABLE SPURRED BY BRYAN'S SONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kevin Venable was in an all-too-familiar scene Monday afternoon at Ventura 
College. He sat in street clothes, his knees aching, and watched his teammates 
scramble up and down the basketball court under Coach Phil Mathews' direction. 
</P>
<P>
Venable, a 23-year-old sophomore, has missed nearly three seasons because of a 
recurring right knee injury. His kneecap is occasionally pulled apart when he 
leaps, sending him to the sidelines, where he is limited to encouraging words 
and high-fives. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Monday appeared to be deja vu. Venable had returned from yet another 
visit to a doctor's office, this time for soreness in his left knee, which may 
be a stress fracture that will keep him out four to five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But, despite wobbly knees that limit his playing time, Venable is wearing a 
Pirate uniform again. The former Channel Islands High star can deal with the 
pain, and the risk of permanent injury, because of another, more painful, blow. 
</P>
<P>
It's a sharp pain that has pierced his heart since March, when his 21-year-old 
brother, Bryan, was killed in an automobile accident. It brought Venable back 
to the hardwood. Not to satisfy a bruised ego; not to prove he can still play. 
</P>
<P>
He has returned because Bryan would have wanted it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels good to be back," Venable said with a smile as he leaned on his 
scarred knee, looked at the team roster on the gymnasium wall, and read "55 
Venable." 
</P>
<P>
"Yep, it feels real good." 
</P>
<P>
That feeling has usually ended at Venable's knees, which have required three 
surgeries the past five years. Venable averaged 22 points and 13 rebounds 
before his right knee blew out early in the 1986-87 season, his freshman year 
at Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"It was real frustrating. Too frustrating," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Venable was forced to trade his powerful inside game and incredible leaping 
ability for construction work with Bryan, pouring concrete and pondering a 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"I always had it in the back of my mind that I would play again," Venable said. 
"I was real anxious, but there was some doubt." 
</P>
<P>
Venable rehabilitated his knee two hours a day -- often alone in Ventura's 
weight room -- and stayed in shape playing pick-up games, waiting for the 
decisive moment of return. 
</P>
<P>
That came on the night of March 20, when Bryan was in a car that struck an 
embankment and overturned. It ended a relationship that had grown stronger the 
past three years, when Kevin wasn't busy dragging his knees up and down the 
court three hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at my aunt's house when they called," Venable said. "It was quite a 
shock." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, Venable met with Mathews to discuss basketball. 
Specifically, his desire to crash the boards and dominate inside again. Venable 
was part of the 1987 state champion team that finished 31-4, a team Mathews 
said would have been 35-0 with Venable in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he could still play," Mathews said. "But I didn't want him to go 
through the same thing he went through when he hurt that knee. That was very 
painful for him, and I wanted to make sure he had rehabilitated his knee to the 
point where he was comfortable to come out here and play hard." 
</P>
<P>
No problem. Kevin was running on his own for the first time in his career and 
continued to work in the weight room. 
</P>
<P>
This comeback was in Bryan's hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do it for him," Venable said. "He's the reason I'm here." 
</P>
<P>
Venable, however, isn't making a token appearance. He is one of three team 
captains and started his first game back, scoring 11 points on five-for-seven 
shooting from the field. Last weekend, he scored a team-high 14 points in 
Ventura's 70-69 loss to Cypress in the championship game of the D. Wayne Lukas 
Thoroughbred Classic, and was named to the all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
"If you saw him play, you wouldn't think he had any knee problem," Mathews 
said. "If he was healthy, he'd be a big-time Division I player. He's better 
than some players with two good knees." 
</P>
<P>
But watching Venable leap over helpless, would-be rebounders isn't as 
entertaining to his mother, Billie Gaines. Gaines has held her son's hand in 
the post-operative room three times too many. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't want him to play," Gaines said. "After the last surgery, the 
doctor said he didn't want to have to operate again." 
</P>
<P>
Reluctantly, Gaines dragged herself to the season-opening intra-squad 
scrimmage. She watched her son catch a finger in an eye and gasped when he 
landed off-balance. Twice she left the gym. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nerve-wracking," Gaines said. "I'm happy he's out there because it's what 
he wants. But I'm apprehensive, too. I don't want to see him get hurt again." 
</P>
<P>
Neither does Venable's step-father, Freddie Gaines. But he won't take the ball 
out of Kevin's hands. 
</P>
<P>
"It's his decision," Freddie said. "He's got guts, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Now, if only Venable had two healthy knees. He is limited to three days of 
practice a week and 25 minutes of game time. He plays in pain, but doesn't want 
anyone to know. "We have to strap him to the bench," Mathews said. 
</P>
<P>
And that is a place Venable has become accustomed to the past three years. But 
whether Venable is playing or watching, Mathews says he will contribute to a 
team that is one of the best in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"He has always been a leader," Mathews said. "He is a positive force. All of 
the other players have tremendous respect for him." 
</P>
<P>
Although Venable's Division I eligibility has expired and his main goal this 
season is to avoid another injury, he has several Division II colleges from 
chasing him. 
</P>
<P>
And there's always Bryan, whom he says he prays for every day. Venable carries 
a pin in his pocket which reads 'I Love Bryan.' "This is for him," he said.

FRIENDLY RIVALS ROOT FOR EACH OTHER AT GIRLS' 4-A CROSS-COUNTRY MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Married couples often find themselves at odds, but the "rivalry" waged between 
the girls' cross-country teams from Buena and Channel Islands highs has knotted 
more ties than it has loosened. 
</P>
<P>
There is no animosity breeding between the two Southern Section 4-A Division 
teams. Instead, Bulldogs' Coach Steve Blum and wife Debbie Blum, the coach at 
Channel Islands, have created a bond between the programs, which engage in a 
friendly rivalry from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done a lot of things together with our teams on purpose," Debbie said. 
"I try to encourage his kids in the middle of races and he does the same thing 
for my kids. 
</P>
<P>
"We help out each other a lot with information, strategies and ideas. We don't 
hide anything. We don't have the football mentality, we're runners. 
</P>
<P>
Both Buena and Channel Islands boasted championship teams this year. 
</P>
<P>
Under Steve, in his seventh year as coach, the Bulldogs claimed their seventh 
consecutive Channel League title and placed second in the 4-A championship 
Saturday behind five-time winner Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands won its second Marmonte League crown in a row and finished 
fourth in the 4-A final under Debbie, a fifth-year coach at the Oxnard campus. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really been neat . . . having somebody to bounce (ideas) off of," Steve 
said of having two championship programs in one household. "Most people don't 
have that luxury." 
</P>
<P>
Or the luxury of having four runners with personal-best times under 15 minutes, 
45 seconds on the three-mile course at Mt. San Antonio College, the venue of 
the Southern Section championships. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo's senior foursome of Abe Valdez (15:13), Shawn Goetzinger (15:26 last 
year), Derek Kite (15:33 at the Mt. SAC Invitational in October) and Chad 
Malesich (15:43) paced the boys' team to its first 4-A title after placing 
third in 1986 and '87 and second last year. 
</P>
<P>
Goetzinger, normally Camarillo's No. 3 runner, was ailing and finished 19th in 
the 4-A and fifth for the Scorpions. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't be happier," Coach Mike Smith said of his team's victory. "Shawn 
had bronchitis and flu all this week and missed two days of practice. To come 
and gut it out for the team is really special to me." 
</P>
<P>
Valdez led Camarillo's charge with a second-place finish, one second behind 
Dave Hartman (15:12) of Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo and Buena, ranked first and fifth, respectively, in the state 
Division I, will make a run at the boys' and girls' team titles at the state 
championships in Fresno's Woodward Park on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake's Jeannie Rothman, who recorded a personal-best 18:01 to finish second 
in the 4-A final, will run in the Division I race. 
</P>
<P>
Nordhoff's girls' team, which had been running in the shadow of Frontier League 
rival Agoura, finished fourth (130 points) in the 2-A championships behind 
three-time winner Agoura (47), Arroyo Grande (83) and Irvine Woodbridge (98). 
Junior Dascha Spellman (19:09) led the Rangers with a sixth-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore freshman standout Maribella Aparicio made a triumphant entrance to 
high school cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did she win the Tri-Valley League title ahead of favored sophomore 
teammate Nikki Shaw, Aparicio clocked 19:03 at Mt. SAC to claim the 1-A title. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Jamie Kendig, fifth in the 1-A at 20:04, paced La Reina (140) to a 
seventh-place finish in the team standings. Thacher (151) placed eighth and 
Fillmore (233) was 11th. 
</P>
<P>
Nordhoff and Aparicio qualified for the state Division II championships and 
Thacher advanced to the Division III meet. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Park's John Castner (16:20) finished sixth in the boys' 1-A final and will 
compete in the state Division III race this weekend.

ATHLETE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Smigiel was at his blocking and tackling best last Friday night at Palos 
Verdes. The two-way Newbury Park High strongman would chaperon scatback Walter 
Thomas through a hole, then turn around and lay a crunching hit on an opposing 
runner. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park defeated Palos Verdes, 19-9, for its first playoff victory since 
1983. The outcome was not decided until midway through the fourth quarter, 
however. Not until Smigiel unclenched his fists enough to deftly take a handoff 
from quarterback Jai Johnston on a tackle-counter play and ramble seven yards 
for the final touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Twice this season the play has been called, and twice Smigiel (6-foot-5, 255 
pounds) has scored. The novelty was spawned from a traditional counter play 
that wasn't working the way it was designed. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to run a play to the tailback, where he starts one way to give 
the guard and tackle time to pull, then counters back and follows the tackle 
through the hole," Coach George Hurley said. "Well, the guard was making his 
block and Smigiel was getting through the hole untouched, but the hole was 
closing behind him before the tailback could get through." 
</P>
<P>
The Panther coaching staff studied films, attempting to find a solution. One 
assistant said in exasperation, "We may as well give the ball to Smigiel." 
</P>
<P>
The coaches stared at one another. We may as well give the ball to Smigiel! 
</P>
<P>
 So Friday night against Santa Barbara, Smigiel, who will probably be the most 
highly recruited lineman in Ventura County, will be counted upon to lay the 
crucial blocks, as usual. He will be counted upon to make big tackles, as 
usual. 
</P>
<P>
And he may very well be called upon to score another touchdown. STEVE HENSON

AKE TAKES OVAL TITLE BY 60 POINTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The 1989 stock car racing series ended at Ventura Raceway last Friday night 
with no change in three of the series season points championship divisions and 
a mild upset in the very tight Mini Stock Oval Track division. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Utts of Camarillo wrapped up the Street Stock Oval Track championship 
several weeks ago, finishing the season with 3,220 points. His nearest 
competition was Camarillo's Jeff Bosley, who finished second with 2,010 points. 
</P>
<P>
Utts outdistanced the Street Stock field with 15 fast times, seven trophy dash, 
six heat race, and six Main Event wins this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Mini Stock Oval Track championship, however, was not a run-away event as 
had been predicted earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo's Gary Curtis appeared to have the championship locked up by 
midseason, but the record-setting driver (15 main-event wins) either won it all 
or did not finish in the points during the second half, allowing Rock Ake Jr. 
of Moorpark to make it the closest points race in the track's history heading 
into the final week. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis held a slim 10-point lead over Ake going into Friday's competition. 
</P>
<P>
Ake picked up a 20-point lead over Curtis through qualifying and a trophy dash 
and heat race with 200 points available in the final main-event race. Curtis 
made several hard charges at Ake in the final, but was sent to the back of the 
pack three times for spin-outs with other drivers while trying to overtake the 
field, never managing to catch Ake. 
</P>
<P>
Ake's finished second in the 25-lap race with Curtis placing fifth to give Ake 
the Oval Track championship by a margin of 60 points. Oxnard's Jim Jewett took 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
It was a very good year for Ake, who also won the Mini Stock Figure-8 
championship with his nemesis Curtis also finishing second in that category. 
</P>
<P>
Bosley captured the Street Stock Figure-8 championship with a 2,455-to-2,100 
point margin over Jim Firsich of Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's Tom Stephens won the final Street Stock 20-lap Main Event. 
</P>
<P>
Utts and Sue Pittinato of West Hills were Heat Race winners and Don Green of 
Ventura took the Trophy Dash in the Street Stock division. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's Pat Garrety won the Trophy Dash and a heat race in the Mini Stock 
division, with Kevin Parker of Ventura and Ken Hewitt of Moorpark winning the 
other heat races. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Raschke of Ventura drove to victory in the 10-lap Mini Stock semi-main 
event.

CRITIC AT LARGE: GEORGE BURNS: BOOKED AGAIN WITH 'ALL MY BEST FRIENDS'; 
</P>
<P>
COMEDY: THE VETERAN FUNNYMAN TALKS A GOOD BOOK, AND HIS LATEST IS A COMPENDIUM 
OF ANECDOTES . . . 'MOST OF WHICH ARE TRUE.'

One of the innumerable jokes about George Burns -- this one from Henny Youngman 
-- is that Burns is so old that when he orders a three-minute egg, the 
restaurant makes him pay in advance. 
</P>
<P>
No one likes the joke more than Burns himself, who will be 94 in January. 
Sipping cups of tea in his Hollywood office and enjoying the first of the day's 
several cigars, Burns said this week: "I've got to keep working; I just bought 
a new toupee." 
</P>
<P>
He was supposed to be starting one of his regular engagements at Caesars Palace 
in Las Vegas this week, but he canceled out, refusing to cross the musicians' 
picket line. Next week he flies off to do a one-nighter in Lafayette, La. 
</P>
<P>
A thought struck him as he mentioned the engagement. Hollering to an assistant 
in the anteroom, Burns said: "Call Lafayette and get the name of the oldest 
theater in town." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a joke," Burns explained. "I'll say I played the theater 51 years ago and 
I must have done all right, because here I am back again." 
</P>
<P>
The renascence of George Burns, which began when he did "The Sunshine Boys" and 
won an Academy Award in 1975, is one of the pleasing wonders of show-business 
history. The role led to another triumph as God in "Oh, God!" two years later. 
</P>
<P>
"All the kids like me from the 'God' movies," Burns says. "They came to see 
John Denver and decided they liked me, too. The old people came to see me and 
fell in love with John Denver. John and I stole one another's audiences." 
</P>
<P>
The films, most recently "18 Again" in 1988, led to eight best-selling books, 
which is more books than he has read, Burns likes to say. "I left school in the 
fourth grade and started in show business when I was 8," he points out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't write books, I talk 'em," Burns says. The first ones he did in 
collaboration with his manager and longtime friend Irving Fein. "Gracie -- A 
Love Story" sold 230,000 copies in hardcover and was on the New York Times 
best-seller list for 22 weeks. Like his new book, "All My Best Friends," it was 
written with (or talked to) David Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
"All My Best Friends" (G.P. Putnam's: $17.95) was officially published only two 
weeks ago but has 390,000 copies in print and has already shown up on both the 
Los Angeles Times and New York Times best-seller lists. It is a marvelous 
succession of anecdotes, presented with the charming disclaimer, "Most of what 
I say is true, the rest is show business." 
</P>
<P>
The stories might or might not hold up in a court of law, but they are 
enchanting, none more so than the one about Harpo Marx acquiring a small pouch 
of fake diamonds, going into Tiffany's, asking to see a tray of loose diamonds 
and then dumping the fakes in with the real ones. 
</P>
<P>
"One night," Burns remembered the other day, "the Marx boys' father was in the 
theater catching their act. A guy sitting near him said, 'Harpo really can't 
talk; he's deaf and dumb.' 
</P>
<P>
' "Harpo can talk,' the father said. 
</P>
<P>
" 'He can't talk,' the guy said; 'I know him.' 
</P>
<P>
"The father says, 'Harpo can talk.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'I got 25 bucks that says he can't talk,' the guy says. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Lay me some odds and you're on,' Harpo's father says." 
</P>
<P>
Burns has just finished a new set of commercials with Betty White for the 
Southern California Gas Co. He recently played Atlantic City for six days and 
regularly works Lake Tahoe and Las Vegas. Not long ago he and Bob Hope did a 
comedy concert before a sold-out crowd in Madison Square Garden, and there are 
plans to do it at least twice more. 
</P>
<P>
The evening wasn't taped. "Never!" Burns exclaimed. "It's my vaudeville act; 
it's got to last me the rest of my career, another 40 or 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Burns says, "If you asked me just to stand up for a half-hour, I 
couldn't do it. But on stage I can do it for an hour, because of all that love 
that comes flowing up over the footlights from the audience. I come on and 
people stand up and clap; they say, 'Look, he can move.' " 
</P>
<P>
As part of the act with Hope, billed as "180 years of comedy," Hope borrowed a 
lady's hat and they did some George and Gracie routines. "My uncle was held up 
on the way home." "For how much?" "All the way." And the tale about Gracie's 
Aunt Bessie, whose canary was trying to hatch an ostrich egg. The canary wasn't 
big enough for the egg, so Aunt Bessie sat on the egg and held the canary in 
her lap. Rim shot and start the music. 
</P>
<P>
"Gracie," Burns says, "didn't tell jokes; she explained them." 
</P>
<P>
Burns remembers all the reviews, including an early one in Oklahoma City, where 
the critic said: "There's no telling how far Gracie Allen could go -- if she 
worked alone." 
</P>
<P>
Burns has said he only had to know two lines in their act: "Gracie, how's your 
family?" and "Your uncle what?" But the truth is that Burns was and is a master 
of comedy construction, having learned every hard lesson vaudeville had to 
teach. He learned to check the air currents on the stage, to be sure that 
Gracie was always upwind from his cigar smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't touch Gracie; the audience wouldn't stand for it," Burns says. 
"I've always smoked cheap cigars. Good cigars don't stay lit; they're too well 
packed. And you can't be re-lighting cigars when you're on stage." 
</P>
<P>
Burns has his own pantheon of favorite comedians: his friend Jack Benny atop 
the list; Bob Hope, Milton Berle, Lou Holtz, George Jessel. 
</P>
<P>
"Jessel once wired a pal and said, 'Desperate. Emergency. Send me $1,500.' The 
pal did and later Jessel explained that he had just made up with his wife of 
the moment, Florence Courtney, and he'd bought her a bracelet with the $1,500. 
The guy said, 'That was the emergency, you had to buy a bracelet?' Jessel said: 
'Listen, would you have sent the money if I'd said bracelet instead of 
emergency?' " 
</P>
<P>
Burns was asked if audiences differ from place to place. "Not for me," he said. 
"Everybody knows me. Everybody calls me George. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm having a heck of a time. I don't believe in dying. It's been done." 
</P>

RECORD FIRMS' PRESIDENTS MAY BE RESIGNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Both PolyGram and Chrysalis record companies appear to be losing their 
presidents. 
</P>
<P>
Sources at PolyGram in New York said Wednesday that Dick Asher, the company's 
president and CEO since October, 1985, resigned on Tuesday. Asher was said to 
have walked around the firm's New York offices saying goodby to co-workers and 
employees. Company officials said they expect to make a formal announcement, 
including the effective date of Asher's resignation, next week. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chrysalis' U.S. president, Mike Bone, has reportedly given notice 
that he will leave as of Dec. 15 from the post he has held since July, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Both moves have been long-rumored in industry circles and result in part from 
the consolidations and new ventures that characterize the record business at 
this time. In July, Thorn-EMI purchased 50% of London-based Chrysalis, while 
over the last several months PolyGram, owned by the Dutch conglomerate N.V. 
Philips, has solidified its position as the No. 3 U.S. record company behind 
the CBS and Time-Warner groups by acquiring independent powerhouses Island and 
A&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
The enlarged PolyGram is expected to reorganize into two operations: a New 
York-based Mercury label and a Los Angeles-based Polydor. Island and A&amp;M 
will continue as autonomous entities. An official statement regarding Asher's 
resignation will be released next week. 
</P>
<P>
Each resignation has also fueled speculation about future executive moves. 
Island's president Lou Maglia and A&amp;M president Jerry Moss have been 
mentioned as the most likely candidates to succeed Asher. According to a source 
at Island, Maglia has said that he is definitely not taking the job, while 
Moss' office would not comment on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Bone, meanwhile, is expected to take a top position with the new record company 
that the Walt Disney Co. is reportedly starting, working directly under Peter 
Paterno, a powerful music industry attorney and longtime business associate and 
friend. Bone was not in his office on Wednesday and Chrysalis had no official 
comment on the reports.

SOTHEBY'S MARION: ANY NUMBER CAN PLAY THE AUCTION GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I think everyone who has the means should be interested in collecting," said 
Sotheby's chairman John L. Marion. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone? Is this man greedy or what? 
</P>
<P>
As Sotheby's premier auctioneer in New York, Marion has knocked down the 
world's three most expensive paintings: Vincent van Gogh's "Irises" ($53.9 
million), Pablo Picasso's "Yo Picasso" ($47.9 million) and Picasso's "Au Lapin 
Agile" ($40.7 million). He has also sold the three priciest works by living 
artists: Willem de Kooning's "Interchange" ($20.7 million) and Jasper Johns' 
"False Start" ($17 million) and "Two Flags" ($12.1 million). 
</P>
<P>
But Marion is not content. 
</P>
<P>
Because these big sales get all the press, they lead to the misconception that 
auctions are a sport for the ultrarich, he said in a recent interview. In fact, 
more than half of the 200,000-plus lots sold in a year at Sotheby's go for less 
than $5,000; a quarter of them sell for under $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Marion cites these figures repeatedly in "The Best of Everything: The Insider's 
Guide to Collecting -- for Every Taste and Every Budget" (Simon &amp; Schuster: 
$19.95), a new book he wrote with Christopher Andersen. While the book is well 
stocked with anecdotes about the rich and famous, the central message is that 
you don't have to be Malcolm Forbes to become a smart player in the auction 
game. 
</P>
<P>
And smart is definitely the operative word here. "Do your homework," Marion 
counsels in one chapter: "Check out the auction house's reputation," "study the 
catalogue," "check out the merchandise," "ask the experts," "attend an auction 
just to observe." 
</P>
<P>
He also discusses nine criteria for assessing value: authenticity, condition, 
rarity, historic importance and provenance, size, medium, subject matter, 
fashion and aesthetic quality. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Marion exhorts readers to "set a limit" on the amount they will 
bid before setting foot in an auction room. "Buying on impulse is the single 
biggest mistake any collector can make," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
If this is unexpected advice from a man who wants everyone to collect the 
things that Sotheby's sells, it's actually good for business. Sophisticated 
buyers are the best auction customers in the long run. They don't stop buying 
when their homes are furnished. They refine their collections, branch out, 
trade up and believe their acquisitive passion improves their quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
In short, they become connoisseurs who reap the rewards of making educated 
decisions. And in collecting, "knowledge is truly power," Marion said. 
</P>
<P>
Why buy a new rug or piece of furniture when for roughly the same price you can 
have a more appealing old one that is likely to rise in value, he asked. If you 
build a coherent collection of things you love, you will be surrounded by 
objects that have "special meaning" because you took the trouble to find them 
and learn about them. 
</P>
<P>
But what's available to the aspiring collector who lacks Donald Trump's bank 
account? Marion lists African and Latin American art, American furniture, 
English salt-glazed stoneware, classic cars and the whole field of collectibles 
among "best bets" in his book. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors don't have to buy at auction, but Marion said that they are missing 
high-quality objects and educational opportunities if they don't. 
</P>
<P>
"Education is the prime reason for our success," Marion said. Dealers used to 
be the primary educators of collectors, but now the major auction houses have 
taken over part of that role by publishing catalogues, making appraisals and 
offering a range of customer services, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As collectors have multiplied, they have edged dealers out of auctions. While 
dealers once bought 60% of the goods offered at a typical auction and added 
these treasures to their inventories, they now purchase about 40% and many of 
those sales are ordered by specific clients. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the participation of more and more people, misconceptions about 
auctions persist, Marion said, and that's what persuaded him to write a book. 
He wants his readers to know that you don't have to spend a lot of money to buy 
at auction, you can walk in off the street, you can ask questions without fear 
of ridicule and you can understand what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
But what if you sneeze, scratch your nose or wave at a friend? Will the 
auctioneer think you are bidding on a Renoir? "Only if you are Norton Simon."

HELPING HANDS: The Orange County Rescue Mission is crediting increased 
awareness of the homeless situation for the big surge in volunteerism for 
today's Thanksgiving feed. . . . The mission, which expects to feed 3,000 
today, turned down about 50 volunteers after getting 150 signed up, about 65 
more than it used last Thanksgiving. . . . Volunteers can try again for 
Christmas, when 200 will be needed. Dana Parsons

IRVINE CO. ASKS FOR A DELAY IN PROJECT HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Irvine Co. on Wednesday requested that the county Planning Commission delay 
for 30 days next week's scheduled hearing on the developer's controversial 
Laguna Laurel project that would bring more than 3,000 homes into pristine 
Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"The company wants to continue its discussions with officials from the city of 
Laguna Beach," said Dawn McCormick, director of corporate communications for 
the Irvine Co. The company "felt it would be more appropriate to continue those 
(negotiations) in a climate that didn't include a public forum." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to request a delay was made by Don Hunt, senior vice president of 
the Irvine Co., who has participated in meetings with Laguna Beach officials, 
McCormick said. 
</P>
<P>
McCormick would not speculate about whether the Irvine Co. had requested the 
delay because it was close to reaching an agreement with the city concerning 
the project, which would bring suburbia to one of the last undeveloped coastal 
canyons in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"As part of our discussions with them, we've kept the different proposals and 
counterproposals silent," she said. "Therefore, as part of this, we will be 
also doing that." 
</P>
<P>
The company's request for a hearing postponement was applauded by both 
environmentalists and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased with the sincerity (of company officials) to negotiate," said 
Harry Huggins, a leading opponent of the Irvine project. "We're pleased with 
their development of new-found wisdom in the value in keeping Laguna Canyon 
free of any development. . . . We plan to make good use of this 30-day break to 
further inform countywide residents of the environmental issues at stake." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach City Councilwoman Lida Lenney called the delay a "significant 
development in the course of negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thrilled," Lenney said. "It sounds as though the Irvine Co. is serious 
about helping us find a way to preserve the canyon." 
</P>
<P>
The requested postponement follows a protest on Nov. 12 in which an estimated 
7,000 to 8,000 people marched up Laguna Canyon Road to denounce the project, 
which is just outside the Laguna Beach city limits near a greenbelt that 
separates the community from the rest of Orange County. The Irvine Co. also 
wants to turn rural Laguna Canyon Road into a six-lane highway and build major 
thoroughfares throughout the project. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. officials maintain that the 2,150-acre project, which includes 
homes, apartments and condominiums, includes a generous amount of open space 
and will improve a dangerous stretch of highway.

'ADAM' FOUND ABANDONED; 
</P>
<P>
CHILD ABANDONMENT: DISCOVERY OF NEWBORN NEAR DUMPSTER IN DRUG-SELLING AREA OF 
SANTA ANA IN SECOND SUCH CASE IN THE COUNTY THIS MONTH.

The premature baby looked warm and secure enough Wednesday, swaddled in a 
blanket with a blue knit cap covering his brown hair, as he lay in the Infant 
Special Care Unit at UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
But just hours earlier, the newborn was discovered barely breathing, naked, 
blue with cold, and lying face down on the asphalt behind a dumpster in one of 
Santa Ana's worst drug-infested neighborhoods. He was the second baby found 
abandoned in Orange County this month. 
</P>
<P>
Nicknamed "Adam," the baby -- weighing only 4 pounds, 4 1/2 ounces -- has 
captured the hearts of doctors and nurses at the medical center, where the 
infant was rushed after a police officer rescued him about 11 p.m. Tuesday. 
Doctors believe he was only 4 1/2 hours old and was born about five weeks 
prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
"Every single person who has seen him wants to take him home," said nurse 
Patricia Hanson, who gave the infant his nickname. "He'll be all right here. 
We'll take care of him right." 
</P>
<P>
Police Officer Michael Buelna, who was investigating an unrelated stabbing in 
the 1200 block of West Brook Street, found the infant between a concrete wall 
and a metal dumpster after neighbors waved him down. The neighbors told him 
that they had heard a baby crying and moaning for several minutes, police said. 
</P>
<P>
When Buelna found him, the baby was blue from the cold and did not seemed to be 
breathing, said police investigator Alan Caddell. Buelna performed 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the infant. After the baby began to cry -- 
indicating that his lungs were working -- the officer ran back to his patrol 
car with the infant and wrapped him in a blanket provided by the neighbors. 
Paramedics then rushed the infant to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt that Mike had a big impact on whether the baby was going to 
live or die. He saved the baby," Caddell said. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe the baby was born elsewhere and then left at the dumpster off 
Brook Street, Caddell said. 
</P>
<P>
Brook Street is a notorious drug-selling area in Santa Ana. Police blocked off 
the street to traffic two years ago because of the high number of car chases 
for drug arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Ruby Olivares, one of several neighbors who found the baby, said residents in 
the area were stunned. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all saying, 'My God, who can do this?' " Olivares said. "He was so 
tiny and helpless. I wanted to pick him up and hold him tight." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are now searching for the mother of the infant, who could face 
charges of child abandonment. But Caddell said the police are more interested 
in reuniting the baby with his mother. Neighbors told police they saw a woman 
near the dumpster minutes before the baby was found. Police described the woman 
as being in her early 30s, with brown hair and an average build. 
</P>
<P>
When the baby was brought to the emergency room, he was covered with bits of 
paper and food, said Denise Bamrick, a UCI clinical social worker. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so cold and it was so traumatic for him," Bamrick said. 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday morning, "Adam Doe" was in good condition -- pink-skinned and 
dressed in a UCI T-shirt, diapers, white socks and a blue knit cap that he 
tugged at every once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
The infant looked even tinier than the other babies staying at the special care 
unit. Nurses say his biggest challenge now is to gain weight, maintain his 
temperature and learn how to suckle. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Patricia Hanson is the infant's personal nurse and she stands by him 
like a doting mother. She named him "Adam" after her first glimpse of him. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at the babies and some name pops into your mind like that. He's an 
Adam all right," said Hanson, who has four grown children. 
</P>
<P>
She admits she felt anger when she had learned that Adam had been abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't help feeling a little angry at the mother for doing that to him. 
But I don't know the circumstances or why he was left behind. For now, I'm just 
thankful he's alive," Hanson said.

PEOPLE: WILD ANIMALS FOLLOW THE ZOOMOBILE DRIVER ON ROAD TO EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since her high school days, Tish Flynn has wanted to work in a zoo. 
</P>
<P>
It took some time, but Flynn, 39, fnally got her wish. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does the Cal State Long Beach graduate work for a zoo, but most days 
she accompanies many of the exotic and domestic animals on trips in her 
zoomobile throughout Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
She loads a boa constrictor, chicken, duck, iguana, opossum, rats, chinchilla, 
frogs, owl, rabbits, a macaw and sundry other animals in her white zoomobile 
and delivers "her kids" -- as she calls the animals -- to schools so students 
can get a close look and touch them. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the personable way some rabbits take to people and the way the beauty 
of a boa constrictor sparkles in the sun," Flynn said. "It almost looks 
fluorescent." 
</P>
<P>
The animal trainer and educational specialist makes three to four visits a week 
with her compact zoo. "This is the fun part of this job," she said. "The 
boorish part is the desk work that goes along with it." 
</P>
<P>
Before her job with the Santa Ana Zoo, Flynn trained walruses, dolphins and 
killer whales at now-defunct Marineland. Earlier, she said, she worked with 
mentally ill and retarded children at community recreation centers. She majored 
in recreational therapy in college. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been interested in animals," said Flynn, who noted that working at 
Marineland was comparable to working at the zoo. "The theory is the same. The 
subject is different." 
</P>
<P>
But Flynn feels what is as important as the animals is the environment they 
live in. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing we bring in the zoomobile is the environment message," said the 
Westminster woman, whose favorite clientele are preschool children. She feels 
that they are eager to make contact with new things without having developed 
many negative feelings, especially about animals. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't start taking care of the environment and the animals that live in 
it, our world is going to be a lot more sterile and unhealthy to live in," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing is teaching the conservation message," said Flynn. "It's fun 
getting an important message across and being able to get people and animals 
together so they can relate to one another." 
</P>
<P>
During animal-handling classes at the zoo on Saturdays, Flynn also weaves in 
environmental and conservation messages for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
"I really love to see a kid get turned on with animals they've only seen in 
pictures," Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, she said, she has a perfect job. "I have the teaching aspect, the 
people and the animals all in one package." 
</P>
<P>
Batman and Robin have come full cycle for Robert Schneider, 69, a retired 
government worker. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago, Schneider built an animated Batman and Robin clock that also 
featured Cat Woman, the Joker and the Penguin trying to blow up Robin with a 
bomb. The scene shows Batman trying to rescue Robin. 
</P>
<P>
"I made it when Batman and Robin were popular around the late 1950s," said the 
Garden Grove man, who has placed the clock in a red plexiglass frame. "It 
really didn't go well in our living room so I put it on a shelf in the garage." 
</P>
<P>
Now that Batman and Robin have made a comeback, Schneider has reconsidered. "I 
have it back in the house in a corner and it looks better than it did 30 years 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes to entice some enterprising entrepreneur to market replicas of 
the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we can both make some money," said Schneider, who said he made the clock 
"just for fun." 
</P>
<P>
"Back then, people used to call me Batman," he added. 
</P>
<P>

High School in Irvine, will be among 500 dancers performing in today's 
nationally televised Macy's 63rd Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City.

HUNDREDS WAIT FOR THANKSGIVING IN A BOX; 
</P>
<P>
CHARITY: ORANGE COUNTY RESCUE MISSION OFFERS HOLIDAY BASICS FOR ABOUT 400 NEEDY 
PEOPLE WHO STOOD IN LINE FOR SEVERAL HOURS.

Ida Jones was in a quandary: The 68-year-old retiree had four grandchildren 
visiting from out of town but no money on her Social Security income to buy 
turkey and the trimmings for Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
Then she heard about the turkey dinner giveaway at the Orange County Rescue 
Mission and her problem was solved. Wednesday morning, she showed up to claim 
her share. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to fix some turkey and dressing for the kids," a smiling Jones 
said as she waited for a ride home with her box of food. "You know how kids 
are." 
</P>
<P>
Jones was one of about 400 people who stood in a block-long line for up to four 
hours Wednesday to claim the holiday food box for their families. All had stood 
in equally long lines at the mission last week to get tokens making them 
eligible for a care box. Eligibility was limited to local families in need, but 
there was at least one reported case of a transient taking his box and selling 
it for $5 on the street. 
</P>
<P>
The mission on West Walnut Street in Santa Ana is in its 26th year of providing 
free Thanksgiving dinners to families. 
</P>
<P>
John F. Lands, mission executive director, said the giveaway has grown to match 
the demand. Five years ago, he said, the mission was handing out 50 boxes of 
food. Next year, he predicted, the number would top 600. The shelter also 
prepares a Thanksgiving Day dinner for the homeless and today they expect as 
many as 3,000 to show up. 
</P>
<P>
The increasing turnout of destitute families shows there is a growing problem 
of poverty in Orange County, Lands said. 
</P>
<P>
Many people interviewed at the mission Wednesday said that illness and other 
bad luck had recently thrust them into the ranks of the unemployed, forcing 
them to accept handouts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really happy that we've got this giveaway because we wouldn't have had a 
dinner otherwise," said a 43-year-old mother of two young daughters who said 
she lost her job as a card dealer after she was injured in a traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
But poverty was no stranger to many others waiting in line. A sizable number 
were Latino immigrants from Mexico and Central America, many of whom work at 
minimum-wage jobs or live with friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
At the head of the line was Juanita Carranza, a 60-year-old El Salvadoran 
immigrant who said she is caring for her seven young grandchildren whose mother 
died in childbirth last spring. Carranza and her husband, who is too old to 
work, received a box containing a stuffed turkey, a loaf of bread, canned 
beets, and stew and mashed potato mix. 
</P>
<P>
Carranza, who said she had helped bring in money as a housecleaner until an 
automobile accident sidelined her six months ago, was upbeat as the holiday 
approached. 
</P>
<P>
"America is great!" she said, beaming. "We have liberty, expression and 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
Carranza said that she would be putting her turkey in the oven this morning so 
that Thanksgiving dinner could be ready by early afternoon. Although it is not 
a holiday in her native land, she said her grandchildren, ages 4 through 13, 
were born in this country and look forward to Thanksgiving Day. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The sight of so many people gathered outside the rescue mission attracted 
others who got in line without tokens for a free care box. And with 75 no-shows 
among those deemed eligible, the mission did hand out boxes to late-comers such 
as Maria Ilveo Fuentes, 33, an El Salvadoran immigrant who arrived in this 
country with her six children only last month. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes, an electronics-plant worker from the capital city of San Salvador, 
said she had to pay a smuggler $300 for herself and each of her children to 
cross the U.S.-Mexican border at Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, she said, "I arrived here with no money." 
</P>
<P>
On hand for crowd control were a handful of orange-shirted mission workers such 
as Roy Vincent, who made sure no one tried to cut in line or start fights. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent and the others said the crowd was peaceable, with only a few instances 
of attempted line-bucking. After the boxes had been handed out, Vincent shook 
his head at a throng of about two dozen people without tokens who had waited in 
hopes of getting food. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a shame that we can't give everybody a meal," Vincent said. "Some 
of these people really, really need it."

NOISE SETTLEMENT PLAN NOT MUSIC TO EVERYONE'S HEARS

A Costa Mesa woman involved in a six-year legal battle to muffle the sound 
levels at Pacific Amphitheater proposed to settle the lawsuit Wednesday with a 
three-year plan to bring the noise within county limits. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Lusk, who lives close to the outdoor arena, submitted the proposed 
settlement during a private meeting with attorneys and Superior Court Judge 
Richard J. Beacom. 
</P>
<P>
But the proposal appears to have created a rift in the leadership of the 
neighbors who are fighting for quieter concerts. Lusk's husband, who is 
treasurer of Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa Inc., helped draft the proposed 
settlement. The organization's president, Russell Millar, said the three-year 
noise reduction plan brings residents too little relief too late. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very downhearted," Millar said. "It's taken so long already. I just feel 
pessimistic that we'll ever get the relief we want through the judicial 
process." 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Lusk and Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa Inc. are the only two 
plaintiffs in the lawsuit. As the only individual plaintiff, Lusk has the power 
to accept a settlement and end the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys are under orders not to discuss the case publicly. But Lusk, who is 
not covered by that order, said her proposal would require the 18,500-seat 
amphitheater to bring its sound levels to 5 decibels above the current Orange 
County limit during the 1990 concert season. The proposal calls for a 
2.5-decibel reduction in 1991 and compliance with the county limit in 1992, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for the amphitheater to limit concert traffic on Arlington 
Drive and Fairview Road and to route most of it into the bowl from Newport 
Boulevard instead, she said. Parking would be limited to a one-square-mile area 
around the Orange County fairgrounds. Lusk has also requested landscaping to 
obstruct the view of the parking areas from the adjoining neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed settlement includes a cash payment, but Lusk would not specify the 
amount. She said it would cover attorney's fees and reimbursement to the city 
of Costa Mesa for the money it has spent to monitor the noise. 
</P>
<P>
Beacom ordered Lusk's proposal sealed and said any counteroffers from defense 
attorneys would also be sealed. He set further settlement negotiations for Jan. 
12 to give the defense time to consider Lusk's proposal and submit a 
counteroffer, if any.

Recently Australia asked for the resumption of close political and military 
ties with New Zealand, but the plea was snubbed by Secretary of State James A. 
Baker and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the Wellington government's continued refusal to permit U.S. 
nuclear-powered ships to call at New Zealand ports undermined basic U.S. 
defense strategy. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand is right not to want nuclear-powered vessels at its ports. One of 
the few nuclear-free zones left on this earth is the South Pacific. In order to 
annihilate the threat of a nuclear war we need more countries in the world that 
will stand up for arms reduction. 
</P>
<P>
I commend Australia and New Zealand for their effort.

STATE, COUNTY OFFICIALS STEP UP INSPECTIONS FOR MEDFLIES

<P>
Examining the cola-colored liquid from the bottom of an insect trap, county 
agricultural inspector Tony Do found nothing larger than a gnat Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
That made him happy. He had been looking for the dreaded Mediterranean fruit 
fly, but he found nothing even resembling the insect's description -- a bug 
slightly smaller than a housefly, with yellowish-brown wings. 
</P>
<P>
During a routine inspection last Friday, another county expert had found a lone 
pregnant Medfly in the same trap, which had been sitting in a guava tree at a 
residence near the intersection of Puente Street and West Walling Avenue in 
Brea since last summer. The discovery has prompted the state and county to 
schedule an all-out attack on the fly that will include at least two aerial 
sprayings of pesticide over a 10-square-mile area beginning next week. The area 
to be sprayed includes portions of Fullerton, Brea and La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first -- and so far only -- fertile Medfly found in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
However, in Los Angeles County this week, Medflies were found in five 
additional neighborhoods, officials said Wednesday. The latest discoveries 
prompted serious doubts there about the current eradication efforts and raised 
the prospect of widespread aerial pesticide spraying. 
</P>
<P>
The flies were found in South Gate, Monrovia, Eagle Rock, Pasadena and Elysian 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Do is one of about 10 inspectors and technicians checking 
about 350 traps daily to monitor the spread of the fly. In addition, several 
teams of state officials have been out to sample fruit, looking for Medfly 
larvae. One wormy piece of fruit was discovered Wednesday, but it has not yet 
been determined if it contained Medfly larvae. 
</P>
<P>
So far, their inspections have not turned up any new fertile Medflies. Nick 
Nisson, an Orange County entomologist, said that all the Medflies collected 
from traps on Tuesday were sterile. Officials said it takes about 24 hours for 
scientists to determine the sterility, so test results on those flies taken 
from traps Wednesday won't be known until today. About 25 sterile flies have 
been found in Orange County since Friday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they have no way of knowing whether the fertile Medfly found in 
Brea is a "loner" or part of a wider infestation. But Brian Taylor, a state 
entomologist, said it is likely that the pregnant female had laid eggs, 
elevating concerns that other fertile Medflies may exist. 
</P>
<P>
"It is always a possibility that it was a loner," Taylor said. "But in this 
case it was a mated female, which means she probably had the opportunity to lay 
other eggs before being trapped." 
</P>
<P>
When it was confirmed Saturday morning that the fly was fertile, dozens of 
state and county workers helped place 1,000 traps within an 81-square-mile 
area, including 789 in Orange County. The new traps were all set by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Before the fly was discovered in Brea, county agricultural officials had 
checked a few hundred "routine" traps each week, said Steve Hill, the county's 
deputy agricultural commissioner. But since the fly was found, they have 
stepped up their inspections, checking traps daily within a one-square-mile 
area. They also check traps every other day around an eight-mile buffer to the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The county will follow this monitoring routine for one week. If no new flies 
are found, the department will revert to its weekly schedule, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
The traps have been placed on many kinds of fruit trees, with the owners' 
permission, Hill said. But the flies, who feed on ripe fruit, are more likely 
to be found in traps on trees that are in season, which now include guava, fig 
and apple trees. 
</P>
<P>
"Guavas are just in season this time of the year so they are more commonly 
found," Do said. 
</P>
<P>
The pregnant fly was found in a McPhail trap, which resembles an upside-down, 
round sink. The trap lures many types of insects with a liquid called Staley's 
mixture, a sweet, brownish mixture of water, yeast and borax. The flies enter 
the trap through the bottom and eventually drown in the lure. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors also have been hanging the Jackson trap, which is meant specifically 
to lure male Medflies. The fly, which is sexually attracted to a special 
mixture called Trimedlure inside the triangular trap, is captured when it is 
caught on a piece of sticky cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
Also out on Wednesday were several teams from the state Department of 
Agriculture's fruit-cutting detail. The teams go from house to house and 
carefully inspect garden fruit and vegetables for any sign of Medfly larvae. 
They often keep their eyes open for near or fully ripened fruit. 
</P>
<P>
"Just before human consumption, the flies like it," said Genaro Davila, a field 
supervisor for the detail. 
</P>
<P>
Among the team's finds on Wednesday was a wormy piece of guava fruit. The 
fruit, which had fallen from a tree in a yard on Puente Street, contained about 
a dozen small worms, which were put into an alcohol solution to be tested in a 
lab. Davila was careful to get all the maggots, which may or may not be Medfly 
larvae. There are several types of flies that lay eggs in fruit, he said.

LOS ALAMITOS COULD CHALLENGE EL DORADO

<P>
Last year, the Empire League was bad. 
</P>
<P>
That's not bad meaning good. That's baaaad, as in really bad. 
</P>
<P>
Only one school, El Dorado High, had a winning record. And the Golden Hawks 
(20-5 overall, 10-0 in league play) got bounced from the playoffs in the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos and Cypress tied for second place with 6-4 records and were each 
just 12-14 overall. 
</P>
<P>
The other three teams -- Esperanza, Katella and Loara -- didn't win 20 games 
between them. 
</P>
<P>
No, 1988-89 was not a good season for the tradition-rich Empire League. 
</P>
<P>
With that nightmare behind them, the league's coaches are looking ahead with 
great zeal to this season and a clean slate. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado wants to retain its championship and go further in the playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos wants to take the title away from El Dorado, and the Griffins have 
the talent and experience to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress, Esperanza, Katella and Loara are just looking for a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to the playoffs is the biggest goal at Katella. The Knights had 
reached the playoffs 21 seasons in a row but failed the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything is possible," Katella Coach Tom Danley said. "The whole thing is 
keyed around emotion and momentum." 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza and Loara should be much improved and Cypress will likely pull a few 
surprises, as it has in the past. 
</P>
<P>
But the two favorites figure to be El Dorado and Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
"People who know are telling me Los Alamitos will not only win the league, but 
has the ability to win (the Southern Section title) in their division," Danley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Griffins have the league's best big man in 6-foot-9 center Robert Conlisk, 
who averaged 16 points and 10 rebounds a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos has nine returning players, including four starters. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado has the best small player in point guard Mike Bradach, who averaged 
12 points and 7.5 assists last season. 
</P>
<P>
A closer look at the teams: 
</P>
<P>
CYPRESS -- The Centurions made a big move at the end of the season to gain a 
second-place tie with Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Kevin Loftus always seems to get the most from his players. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starting guard Jared Rice gives the team some steady leadership, but 
this season, Cypress would have to be considered a long shot for the title. 
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, the Centurions' junior varsity won the league title last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
EL DORADO -- Center Matt Luke, the team's leading scorer and rebounder, has 
graduated, but the Golden Hawks don't figure to miss a beat. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Bradach) is one of the best point guards around this year," El Dorado 
Coach Wayne Carlson said. "He's going to be super. He can shoot the ball, he's 
got great hands, good quickness, quick moves." 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Facione, who averaged 9.6 points and eight rebounds a game, is another 
key to El Dorado's fortunes. At 6-4, he is the team's tallest player. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Loyd, a 6-2 sophomore, was the freshman team's MVP last season. Luke's 
younger brother, Josh, a 6-3 senior; Brett Tomto, a 6-3 junior, and Gary Smith, 
a 6-1 senior transfer from Bonita, will see considerable playing time. 
</P>
<P>
"As we gain experience, we'll get better and better," Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
ESPERANZA -- The Aztecs have four players back, including Joe Foss, a junior 
who averaged 13 points and five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
They also have 6-6 sophomore Matt Cordik, who has Coach Mark Hill feeling good 
about the Aztecs' playoff chances. 
</P>
<P>
Cordik was the only sophomore to play in the North Orange County Slam-N-Jam 
summer league. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely have a shot at the playoffs," Hill said. "In order to think any 
higher, we have to improve on our rebounding. We're young and very thin." 
</P>
<P>
Thin? 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of thin guys. We don't have much strength. We've been working in 
the weight room, but we don't have much bulk." 
</P>
<P>
KATELLA -- Danley, the only basketball coach the school has had, is hoping an 
eight-man rotation can return the Knights to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can establish some things and get back on track, we can be competitive," 
Danley said. "I don't see any singular standouts. I'd like to have a 6-9 kid to 
say this is the hub of the wheel." 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a dominant player, Danley will try to counter with balance 
and depth. 
</P>
<P>
Guards Brian Rice, a junior, Jamie Vitzeilo, a senior, and Kevin Carlson, a 
junior, are among the Knights' top players. 
</P>
<P>
But they'll need a few breaks to return to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
LOARA -- Tes Whitlock, a 6-2 junior guard, was an all-league selection last 
season and has started on the varsity since his freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
But the Saxons haven't taken advantage of Whitlock's skills the past two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Loara was 4-17 and the season before, 5-16. The Saxons haven't won 
a league championship since the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
But Loara has a new coach in Jerry Halpin, and with Whitlock's continued 
improvement, the Saxons might challenge for a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
LOS ALAMITOS -- The Griffins have an impressive lineup. Rick Potts, a 6-1 
junior, plays point guard. Mike Wilson, 6-3, is the off-guard. Forward Jason 
Cunningham, a 6-4 sophomore transfer from Mayfair, is the brother of Griffin 
running back Erik Mitchell. Todd Chesebro, 6-6, plays power forward, and 
Conlisk is in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Steve Brooks will get an early look at how the Griffins react to 
difficult conditions. Los Alamitos heads east to play nationally ranked DeMatha 
of Hyattsville, Md., and St. John's of Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
The Griffins also will play in the Tournament of Champions -- in the same 
bracket as Mater Dei and Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel if we can play well back there, we'll have a very successful season," 
Brooks said. "It should be a real good test for the kids."

CORONA DEL MAR RALLIES TO TAKE 4-A TITLE

Corona del Mar High School, seeking a third consecutive Southern Section 4-A 
water polo titles, ran into a determined challenge Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park made all the right moves and got the breaks during the first half. 
But the Spartans couldn't stand prosperity and the Sea Kings got their third 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar put together a three-goal run in the third quarter, then held 
off the Spartans for a 10-9 victory at Belmont Plaza Pool. 
</P>
<P>
"I love all the titles we've won equally, but I think I appreciate them more as 
I get older," said Coach John Vargas. "I'll have to think about whether I'll be 
back next season." 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings (27-3) have won 19 of their past 20 playoff games. They also have 
won four of the past five 4-A titles. 
</P>
<P>
But at the start, the Spartans (25-5) looked like the experienced team. Villa 
Park, which has never beaten Corona del Mar in eight tries, picked apart the 
Sea King defense and led, 5-4, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans increased their lead to 6-4 with less than two minutes gone in the 
third quarter on a goal by Gavin Arroyo. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt we were in fine shape at that point," Villa Park Coach Jeff Ehrlich 
said. "Then everything fell apart." 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings scored three times in the last three minutes of the third 
quarter. Brandon Howald scored two of the goals, including a turn-around shot 
that gave Corona del Mar a 7-6 lead with 47 seconds remaining in the quarter. 
The Sea Kings never relinquished the lead. 
</P>
<P>
A goal by Villa Park's Eric Johnson cut the Sea King lead to 8-7 with 4:43 
left. The Spartans had two opportunities to tie the score, but they turned the 
ball over on the first, and goalie Rob Pike made a diving save on the second.

EL TORO WINS ITS SECOND CONSECUTIVE 3-A CHAMPIONSHIP

A little rest and relaxation was all the El Toro High School water polo team 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers got the rest during the week. The relaxation began Wednesday, 
moments after the Chargers defeated Capistrano Valley, 12-8, at the Belmont 
Plaza Pool to win their second consecutive Southern Section 3-A water polo 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"We followed the same plan we used last season," El Toro Coach Don Stoll said. 
"We didn't lift any weights and we didn't have any morning workouts through the 
playoffs. We wanted the kids to be rested." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers scored three goals in the first 84 seconds and led, 5-0, after one 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Normally a fast-paced team, Capistrano Valley (27-2) got only one goal off its 
transition game. 
</P>
<P>
Goalie Erik Terwilliger made saves on three other Cougar counter-attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"That's their whole offense," said El Toro's Ken Nickel, who scored a game-high 
five goals. "We knew if we could take that away, we would win. Even when we 
were on offense, we were thinking defense." 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars did pull to within three early in the fourth quarter on Kevin 
Eggert's third goal of the game. But Nickel followed with two goals within 35 
seconds.

EASTERN PILOTS END STRIKE; MACHINISTS TO STAY OUT; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: 'WE RAN OUT OF OPTIONS,' SAYS A UNION SPOKESMAN. BUT THE AIRLINE SAYS IT 
HAS HIRED REPLACEMENTS FOR THE 1,800 STRIKING PILOTS AND HAS NO JOBS TO OFFER 
THEM. 
</P>

<P>
Eastern Airlines' pilots voted late Wednesday to end a bitter nine-month 
walkout, but the airline's mechanics said they would continue to strike. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots' decision to end their strike is largely symbolic because Eastern 
has replaced the 1,800 striking pilots and says it has no jobs to offer them. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern's pilots voted to end their dispute one day after President Bush vetoed 
legislation that would have created a blue-ribbon panel to investigate the 
strike. In his veto message, Bush said Congress, which would have set up the 
panel, had no business interfering in contract disputes. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the pilots said the congressional panel had been the union's 
last hope to resolve its differences with Eastern and its parent company, Texas 
Air Corp. "We ran out of options," the spokesman, pilot Wayne Dolan, said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Bryan, head of the striking machinists, was angered by the pilots' 
move. 
</P>
<P>
"Our ranks are unaffected by this," Bryan said from his home in Miami. "The 
strike continues. We were the ones who were carrying the strike anyway for the 
last two or three months. 
</P>
<P>
"Eastern has been desperate for maintenance and ground support," he added. "We 
are unchanged by this decision." 
</P>
<P>
However, airline analysts said the striking machinists also have been replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan said "it is unclear to me" why the pilots ended their strike. "Eastern 
claims they had all the pilots they needed when the pilots broke ranks and many 
crossed the picket lines in August." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Ashlock, an Eastern spokesman said: "We have all the pilots we need right 
now. We're not hiring anybody. However, there will be a rising need for pilots 
as the airline expands." 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern pilots walked off the job on March 5 to support the striking 
International Assn. of Machinists, which represents mechanics and other ground 
workers. The strike's immediate impact was significant, forcing Eastern to 
cancel 90% of its flights and lay off 7,000 non-union workers. 
</P>
<P>
On March 9, a crippled Eastern filed for bankruptcy court protection from its 
creditors, then slowly began rebuilding as a much smaller airline. To raise 
money, it sold about one-third of its 255 aircraft as well as its profitable 
Northeast shuttle operations, which New York real-estate magnate Donald Trump 
now owns. It is talking with American Airlines about the possible sale of its 
Latin America routes. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern now has 1,800 pilots flying about 780 flights a day to 85 cities, down 
from 3,200 pilots and nearly 1,100 daily flights before the strike. 
</P>
<P>
The participation of the pilots had been crucial to the machinists' strike, 
because pilots are difficult to replace. But many Eastern pilots became 
disillusioned as the strike wore on, and 800 eventually returned to work. 
Another 800 pilots retired or went to work for other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the strike forced a rift in the leadership of Eastern's pilots' union. 
The members voted to replace its conciliatory chairman with Skip Copeland, a 
hard-liner when it comes to management relations. On Wednesday, he accused 
Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo of dismantling Eastern with a "scorched-earth 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
John Peterpaul, general vice president of the machinists' union, said that the 
loss of pilot support would hurt his union's efforts, but he added: "The strike 
is going to continue." Peterpaul said he hoped that Congress would override the 
President's veto of the investigatory panel when it reconvenes in January. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be difficult, but we will try," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo viewed the veto as a victory for the airline and wrote to Bush to thank 
him. "It took courage and a clear vision of a need to keep the airline industry 
competitive," Lorenzo said. 
</P>
<P>
The machinists struck the airline over a contract dispute. Eastern sought $150 
million in wage concessions, but the machinists sought $50 million in higher 
pay. Union officers said that most of Eastern's 8,500 machinists have remained 
on strike. 
</P>
<P>
The airline's work force, which numbered more than 30,000 before the walkout, 
now stands at about 18,400. The airline has said that it expects to emerge from 
bankruptcy within a few months.

TURKEY A L'ORANGE; 
</P>
<P>
HERE ARE SOME CHOICE CUTS: FROM OPERA'S BAIT, SWITCH TO DEADHEAD TRAFFIC JAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, unlike last year, we didn't hear any Orange County city officials 
decrying Shakespeare as "too high-brow" for the citizenry. But that doesn't 
mean that 1989 hasn't supplied plenty of material for the annual Turkey Awards, 
which we hand out for the lapses in taste, bad calls and downright 
air-headedness that too often have made us want to reach for the ax. 
</P>
<P>
So with a drum(stick) roll -- let the Turkeys begin! 
</P>
<P>
First and foremost to local arts groups that try to sell tickets based on hype, 
rather than performance. Here's a sample from one of the ads touting New York 
City Opera's appearance earlier this year at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center: "Treachery and murder. Mystery and magic. Passion and love. Delightful 
tales and sinister plots abound. . . . This magnificent week of soaring music, 
masterful song and opulent settings is destined to be one of the most exciting 
and memorable events of 1989!" I'm sure it was, though I really can't remember 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
An award to organizations that sell one thing, then deliver another -- the arts 
world version of bait and switch. Opera Pacific was a prime example. When 
tickets were put on sale last February for its 1989-90 production of Puccini's 
"Turandot," only the name of tenor Lando Bartolini was in the ads, leading any 
reasonable person to assume that if you bought a ticket, you'd be hearing 
Bartolini in the lead role as Calaf. But just last week, the company slipped 
out a press release announcing that in three of the six performances, Calaf 
will be sung by one Giorgio Tieppo, who is an unknown even to opera experts, 
much less to the average opera-goer. Worse, the release referred to Tieppo's 
"New York Metropolitan debut," implying an association with the Metropolitan 
Opera in New York (whose officials had never heard of Tieppo) instead of 
calling it his "New York metropolitan-area debut" -- at Long Island University, 
which, come to think of it, isn't technically the New York metropolitan area, 
either. The release was unequivocally misleading, if not deceitful. In 
response, Opera Pacific general director David DiChiera explained that he had 
"always intended on double-casting" the role. Too bad he hadn't "always" let 
ticket-buyers in on the secret. 
</P>
<P>
To numerous local rock clubs that continue to enforce the abominable "pay to 
play" policy, in which struggling bands buy a predetermined number of tickets, 
or fork out cash outright for the privilege of getting exposure. 
</P>
<P>
To the producers of "Elvis: A Musical Celebration," not so much a "celebration" 
as a theatrical grave-robbing of the late King of Rock 'n' Roll's legacy. If 
Elvis were alive and saw this show, which played the Center in March, he might 
wish he were dead. 
</P>
<P>
To Cypress College administrators who deleted a photo of an artwork by Rafael 
Serrano at the last minute from a flyer announcing the show because it used 
phallic symbols as part of its anti-war imagery. 
</P>
<P>
To the Deadheads who show up for Grateful Dead concerts at Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre without tickets and clog traffic, parking lots and surrounding 
strawberry fields, seemingly forever. Another helping to city officials who 
think the answer is banning the band, instead of the offending ticket-less 
fans, from Irvine Meadows in the future. 
</P>
<P>
To Music Plus, the first major Southland record chain to drop vinyl LPs 
completely from its stores. It, and others who have followed in treating vinyl 
as malaria of the music world, cite declining demand and consumer preference 
for CDs (which just happen to give record companies about double the profit 
margin). Of course sales of vinyl are dwindling -- you can't buy what you can't 
find. 
</P>
<P>
To security guards at South Coast Plaza, who snapped into action and hustled 
out a couple of trouble-making . . . artists. It seems a couple of local women 
who like to paint Orange County scenes one day a week decided to while away one 
rainy day making sketches of the mall's indoor carousel. Little did they know 
they hadn't applied for the proper papers, so they were told, politely but 
firmly, they would have to stop. This in Costa Mesa, the self-proclaimed "City 
of the Arts." Boy, lucky for the artists they weren't actually doing something 
illegal within city limits -- like standing on a street corner seeking gainful 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
To magician David Copperfield for his lascivious stage manner in shows at the 
Performing Arts Center, where he'll return in January. His bump-and-grind form 
of entertainment smacks more of Harbor Boulevard "tricks" than magic from the 
time-honored Houdini school. 
</P>
<P>
To the Laguna Beach City Council for declaring that a beer permit for Club 
Postnuclear would constitute a public danger, unlike all the other 
establishments in the area that do have liquor licenses. 
</P>
<P>
To Cal State Fullerton students and Associated Students officers, for the 
recent campus flap over the appearance of Morton Downey Jr. A turkey to the 
students who named Downey as their No. 1 choice in a survey of potential guest 
speakers, and stale stuffing to the Associate Students for following up this 
bone-headed choice by spending $5,000 collected in student fees to pay Mr. Big 
Mouth. The payoff? Only 150 students (of 25,065 enrolled this semester) bought 
tickets. Bravo to the good taste exhibited by the remaining 24,915. 
</P>
<P>
To the Beach Boys, for their by-the-numbers performance (yet again) at the 
Pacific Amphitheatre in May. Maybe they should call the producers of "Elvis" 
and commission a stiff musical in which they would star as themselves, paying 
homage to how wonderful they once were. Oh, wait -- they already do that. 
</P>
<P>
To poet and author Donald Britton for his pretentious series of articles 
entitled "The Dark Side of Disneyland." Writing in Art Issues magazine last 
summer, he described the Happiest Place on Earth as "less an amusement park 
than a moving elegy for dead children," stopping just short of dubbing it "The 
Tragic Kingdom." Don -- get a life. 
</P>
<P>
To the Orange County Performing Arts Center's tired batch of road shows that, 
with one notable exception (see below), masqueraded as the best of current 
musical-theater: "Anything Goes," "Fiddler on the Roof," "Cats" (for the third 
time) . . . May we expect singing waiters and chicken-fried steak dinners 
before show time in the near future? 
</P>
<P>
To the Orange County Board of Supervisors for for contributing precisely zilch 
to the arts in recent years. Now they have a new plan starting in 1990 to 
support art -- at the John Wayne Airport. Maybe this is for all our 
fly-by-night art lovers? 
</P>
<P>
To actor-turned-would-be-rock-star Dennis Quaid for thinking even for a 
millisecond that he could emulate Jerry Lee Lewis in a suffocatingly bland show 
at Club Postnuclear in Laguna Beach last March. There's more to rock 'n' roll 
greatness than a wicked smile and the ability to pound a piano. A modicum of 
talent please, maestro? 
</P>
<P>
To the Pacific Symphony for keeping ticket holders waiting for more than two 
months while they dawdled around deciding what to play on a concert program 
after canceling Verdi's Requiem. Again, the concert-goer gets the message: 
"We've got your money, we'll give what we decide to give, if and when we decide 
to give it." 
</P>
<P>
To any and all others who treat Orange County audiences with disdain, as 
credit-card numbers instead of culture-hungry denizens deserving of respect. 
</P>
<P>
Well, now that the turkeys have been thoroughly carved up, it's only fair to 
offer Thanksgiving Day toasts to those who have made our lives a little tastier 
and culturally satisfying this year: 
</P>
<P>
To the San Francisco Ballet, whose October engagement at the Performing Arts 
Center featured some refreshingly bold works of cutting-edge choreographer 
William Forsythe. All that classical ballet is swell, but it's also nice to 
look forward now and then. Ditto for the appearance of the Lewitzky Dance 
Company for introducing some modern dance on the sacred Segerstrom stage in 
October, courtesy of the Master Chorale of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
To the Celebrity Theatre's bold bookings of everything from rap and comedy to 
country and punk. If only we had a 1,000-seater run by people with similar 
sense of adventure and open-mindedness. Next best thing: any 1,000-seat pop 
music venue. 
</P>
<P>
To the Imagination Celebration, for managing to get blues musicians John Cephas 
and Phil Wiggins into the Performing Arts Center as part of the annual arts 
program for children. But a Bronx cheer to whoever wrote the impenetrable, 
overly intellectualized program. If you have to explain the blues like a 
doctoral dissertation, you jus' ain' got no kulcha. 
</P>
<P>
To the Costa Mesa City Council, which created a new agency to provide greater 
and more stable funding for artsrecognizing that the arts can not only be an 
aesthetic asset to the community, but good business, too. Imagine that. 
</P>
<P>
To the San Francisco-based Landmark Theatre Corp., which in 1989 bought the 
Port Theatre in Corona del Mar and leased the old Fox Theatre in Fullerton, 
which will now be completely refurbished. The company might be able to make 
greater profits showing "Friday the 13th, Part 39 -- Jason Takes Mylanta," but 
it prefers to cater to the smaller, under-served audience for foreign films, 
independents and other "art" films. 
</P>
<P>
To comedian Jerry Seinfeld, a regular on the Orange County comedy front, for 
showing, a la Jay Leno, that you can still get people to laugh without verbally 
or physically abusing your audience, ethnic minorities, people who are 
overweight or in any way different from the performer. Seinfeld's school of 
comedy celebrates the things we all have in common, rather than reinforcing 
those things that separate us. 
</P>
<P>
To Alternative Repertory Theatre in Santa Ana, Illusion's/New View Theatre in 
Brea (though it recently closed), Way Off Broadway Playhouse in Santa Ana for 
noble efforts, even when artistically unsuccessful, at establishing some sense 
of a storefront-theater scene in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
To KOCE Channel 50, Orange County's public television station, which nearly 
qualified for a turkey for its heavy promotion of the popular BBC series 
"EastEnders" in a March fund-raising drive, then turned around in April and 
canceled the show because they "couldn't afford it." But they earned thanks for 
rescuing the show from oblivion with a last-minute reprieve in the form of 
corporate underwriting from the Queen Mary-Spruce Goose Entertainment Center in 
Long Beach. This followed an unprecedented flood of hundreds of letters and 
phone calls protesting the cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
To the Fullerton Museum Center for its "Document Orange County" exhibit, 
especially the entertaining segment called "Looking Forward," which presented 
local kids' notions about the face of Orange County Yet to Come. Some were 
quite dark, but you couldn't help predicting that the fourth-grade kid who 
envisioned a futuristic "Computer Mug (that) will be used for drinking coffee 
and doing work at the same time" is soon gonna be a millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
To Bogart's in Long Beach, for providing at least one relatively close outlet 
for invigorating, eclectic shows, most of which never find their way to Orange 
County, and for providing a desperately needed outlet for aspiring Orange 
County rock bands. 
</P>
<P>
To "Into the Woods" at the Performing Arts Center. This engaging Stephen 
Sondheim musical had a message, even a heart, instead of the empty visual flash 
of "Cats" and all the other Andrew Lloyd Webber tripe that is so much the rage 
in the musical theater world. 
</P>
<P>
To Nicholas Slonimsky, the beloved and seemingly immortal critic and raconteur. 
During his UC Irvine talk in January, Slonimsky always had an insight or witty 
retort aimed at keeping artistic standards high and stuffed-shirts deflated. 
</P>
<P>
To South Coast Repertory for, among other things, a lively staging of Shaw's 
"You Never Can Tell." (A separate toast to those continually amazing eyebrows 
of actor I.M. Hobson.) Also, for its endlessly imaginative Second Stage 
production of Charles Dickens' "Hard Times," in which five actors miraculously, 
and convincingly, managed to conjure up dozens of distinct characters, proving 
again that invention and imagination will always triumph over spectacle and 
special effects. 
</P>
<P>
To Neil Young for a riveting performance in August at the Pacific Amphitheatre. 
Built around a powerhouse new "Freedom" album, Young's show demonstrated again 
that the best socially conscious rock is compelling, not simply suffocatingly 
well-intentioned (are you listening, Bono?). But was it just another persona 
donned by rock's stylistic carpetbagger? Answer: when the result is this 
powerful, it doesn't matter a whit. 
</P>
<P>
To the Grove Shakespeare Festival, which is as adept outdoors (in fine summer 
performances of "Romeo and Juliet" and a particularly admirable performance by 
Charles Lanyer as "Cyrano de Bergerac") as it is indoors (in a moving 
production of Rod Serling's "Requiem for a Heavyweight"). 
</P>
<P>
To Dr. Dream Records, the tiny label in Orange that is putting dozens of local 
rock acts on tape and vinyl, providing tangible evidence of a still-exciting 
original-music scene. The company released albums by noteworthy performers 
including Imagining Yellow Suns, Eggplant, National People's Gang, Ann De 
Jarnett and the late, lamented El Grupo Sexo. 
</P>
<P>
And, lastly, to any and all who conceive of, promote and disseminate the arts 
as art first, commerce second. 
</P>
<P>
Happy Turkey Day!

A Westlake Village-based television production company's plans to convert one 
of Anaheim's original luxury movie houses into a TV studio have collapsed. 
Complying with myriad requirements of Anaheim city officials -- from widening 
sidewalks to redesigning a driveway -- proved impossible for Winning 
Productions, said spokesman Matt Cimber. The production firm had signed a lease 
to turn the decaying Cinemaland theater into a studio where game shows and 
other programs would have been produced before live audiences. While Winning 
was ready to fund the theater's conversion and refurbishment, "We were not 
about to start redesigning Anaheim," Cimber said. There are currently no 
alternative plans for the landmark cinema across the street from Disneyland, a 
city official said.

POP BEAT: RATING NEW RELEASES OF ORANGE COUNTY-BASED MUSICIANS;

For this week's Pop Beat, we'll catch up on some recent releases by Orange 
County-based performers: The scale is * (poor) to ***** (a classic). 
</P>
<P>
Walter Trout Band 
</P>
<P>
"Life In The Jungle." (Bozz of Electra): **** 
</P>
<P>
Trout, who lives in Huntington Beach, gave up a steady, high-profile gig when 
he left John Mayall's Bluesbreakers to go on his own earlier this year. Now we 
can see why -- "Life In The Jungle" heralds the arrival of a blues-rock talent 
of the first order. The album, recorded in Denmark and issued in Europe (it's 
available as an import at Music Market in Costa Mesa), showcases a performer 
who is confident, mature and strikingly well rounded. Trout's sizzling guitar 
work alone makes "Life In The Jungle" a must for six-string aficionados, but 
there is much more than that here. Among the album's five original songs are 
two ebullient, good-timey rockers and a couple of lovely, pop-flavored ballads 
sung with a wistful soulfulness. The stormy title song conjures up the fear 
brought on by a murder in Trout's own neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
At various times, Trout's approach can recall the stately blues balladry of 
Eric Clapton ("The Mountain Song,"), the warmth of Little Feat ("Frederica"), 
or the animal spirits of Lynyrd Skynyrd ("Good Enough To Eat"). A live version 
of Jimi Hendrix's "Red House" finds Trout indulging his old tendency to overdo 
the speed and flash. But elsewhere, he reaches an effective balance between 
wildness and control with playing that serves his material rather than his ego. 
</P>
<P>
Trout and his versatile backing trio are at their most potent on stage: The 
album ends with a searing, 15-minute psychodrama built around live renditions 
of the blues standards "Cold Cold Feeling" and "Serve Me Right to Suffer." The 
two connected songs become an epiphany of anguish and remorse in a performance 
that can stand as a textbook example of blues musicians tapping the deepest 
reaches of their chosen calling's well of emotions. 
</P>
<P>
National People's Gang 
</P>
<P>
"Orange." (Dr. Dream): *** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
One's attitude toward National People's Gang depends largely on one's response 
to Chad Jasmine's calculatedly theatrical singing. Listeners who like their 
rock vocals in the offhanded vernacular might not go for Jasmine's stagey act, 
which can seem archly Anglicized and overdone. But there is nothing wrong with 
theatricality when it brings a meaty role to life, and NPG's songs come off 
like one-act monologues in which Jasmine gets inside the skin of obsessed 
characters placed at emotional extremes. "Love Button," for example, finds him 
doing a wired, James Woods-type turn as a gambling junkie going bust in Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these playlets are abstract, but they never lack an intriguing, 
off-center point: "Breaking Ground," an evocative, thought-provoking song about 
detachment, seems to look down upon the sweat and heartbreak of humanity from 
somewhere above the stratosphere. "White Boxes" is an unsettling examination of 
the disguises that dysfunctional families don in an attempt to appear normal. A 
feverish version of Simon &amp; Garfunkel's "59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' 
Groovy)" becomes a simultaneously mocking and exhilarating demolition derby 
ride over the song that sounds as if Johnny Rotten is in the driver's seat. 
</P>
<P>
Stylistically, NPG is an art-rock band with a strong command of textures 
ranging from shimmering pop brightness to furious, focused pounding. The rhythm 
section is deft and strong, with new bassist Deyo Glines adding some funkiness. 
Chad Forrello is the do-everything MVP of NPG, a guitarist of commendable 
selflessness whose playing is exciting without being obtrusive. Perhaps best of 
all, the band steers clear of fashionable cynicism. Without sacrificing the 
right to be ironic, National People's Gang shows that you don't have to lose a 
sense of innocence, idealism and heart to prove that you're smart. After last 
year's fine debut album, "The Hard Swing," NPG serves notice with "Orange" that 
its creative reserves run deep. 
</P>
<P>
Exude 
</P>
<P>
"Testosterone Tapdance." (Rah! Rah!): *** 
</P>
<P>
Lust and love is the subject, and while that's nothing novel, Exude's strongly 
melodic pop craftsmanship keeps the oldest theme of all from getting stale. 
Hunkering down in its Anaheim garage, this look-ma-no-guitars trio was able to 
fashion a danceable techno-pop sound that is warm and human instead of coldly 
mechanized. Frank Rogala's grainy, breathy vocals deserve some credit for that. 
Rogala's voice is limited, but by borrowing resourcefully from such non-techno 
sources as Mick Jagger, Tom Petty and Peter Wolf, he pieces together a singing 
style that makes up in verve and personality what it lacks in purity and 
strength. That's where Exude's savvy comes in: The band is smart enough to 
surround the lead vocal parts with catchy ensemble harmonies that offset 
Rogala's roughness and round out the sound. Younger brother Vince Rogala's 
saxophone riffing provides another attractive voice to bolster the framework, 
while Robin Canada's runs on conventional keyboards are a nice antidote to the 
usual dance pop synths and samples. 
</P>
<P>
On "359 Directions," an otherwise promising ballad that aims to recreate the 
Stones' "Angie"/"Wild Horses" mode, Frank Rogala falters by trying to reach too 
far beyond his ability. Exude's other false step (besides the off-putting album 
cover) is a brooding instrumental finale that has nothing to do with anything 
that comes before it on the album. 
</P>
<P>
Exude celebrates lust while giving romance its due, and it frequently brings to 
bear a light and clever lyrical touch ("You got me ga ga from the get go/You 
did a tap dance right on my testosterone") that is missing from most 
dance-oriented pop. 
</P>
<P>
Big Drill Car 
</P>
<P>
"Album Type Thing." (Cruz): ** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
The title tells a lot: Big Drill Car's music is direct, plain-spoken and 
economical, while its lyrics deal with the awkwardness that comes from facing 
the emotional growing pains of youth. 
</P>
<P>
There is a lot to admire here. For one thing, Big Drill Car hits with a force 
that fully justifies its name. There is nothing fancy going on: the ensemble 
delivers a heavy, rhythmic throb and crunch, with occasional brief solo jabs 
from a metallic lead guitar. Melody never gets steamrollered, though. Big Drill 
Car's aim is to be a punked-up pop band, hard-edged but catchy, and it usually 
succeeds. The lyrics, and singer Frank Daly's delivery, are honest and 
straightforward reflections of what it's like to be living in the aftermath of 
adolescence, with its intense loves, regrets and frustrations. While the songs 
deal with facing problems and failures, they also carry an appealing sense of 
hopefulness and optimism that experience can be the foundation for growth. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that the four-man band is a little too single-minded and direct. 
The songs take no unexpected turns -- the music is all headlong attack, with 
the occasional Led Zeppelin-style tromp beat the only minor relief. The lyrics 
don't move beyond the earnest, unadorned depiction of immediate feeling. And 
those consistently catchy melodic hooks are a little too consistent: while each 
song stands well on its own, a sense of sameness sets in over the course of the 
album. 
</P>
<P>
Word play, humor and a musical approach more conscious of the need for variety 
and dynamic shifts should be on Big Drill Car's agenda the next time out. But 
for now, this young band has laid a good foundation. (Big Drill Car plays 
Saturday at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano).

A TIME FOR GIVING THANKS; 
</P>
<P>
FOR MANY, THE MEANING OF THANKSGIVING SOMETIMES GETS LOST IN THE SHUFFLE OF 
FAMILIES AND FEASTING. BUT UNEXPECTED DRAMATIC TURNS IN THE LIVES OF FOUR 
ORANGE COUNTY PEOPLE -- AND THEIR KIN -- HAVE GIVEN THEM PARTICULAR REASON TO 
BE THANKFUL THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Lupash 
</P>
<P>
From a traditional viewpoint, they don't make much of a Thanksgiving meal, but 
this year David Lupash is thinking of chips and salsa as quite a feast. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's getting stronger," he said, glancing down at his right arm and 
moving it an inch or two. "I've been picking up chips and dipping them in 
salsa." 
</P>
<P>
He smiled. "I'm doing pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Since July, 1988, David Lupash's life has been punctuated by such seemingly 
modest milestones. Moving the hand. Breathing comfortably. Having a lighter 
"halo vest" bolted to his skull. Coming home from the hospital for a visit. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beautiful summer day when Lupash, now 14, struck his forehead on a 
sand bar and crushed his spinal cord after diving into the surf in Long Beach, 
he has striven for the small victories that are the rewards for the daily 
persistence, determination and cheerfulness that have inspired his family and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
In adapting to a turn of fate that most would call cruel at best, the young 
former competitive swimmer, violinist and A student from Westminster has built 
a life in which his immobile limbs are less important than friendship, and the 
pure love of life more precious than walking. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the most extraordinary human I know," said Barbie Meyers, a family 
friend. "He never has a bad day, never has a bad attitude. When he wakes up, 
every day is a new day and a great day. He expects good things to happen. And 
he never, ever, ever focuses on himself." 
</P>
<P>
Since the accident, David has lived in a succession of hospitals (currently 
Loma Linda University Medical Center); has been fitted with a succession of 
halo vests to keep his head immobile; has undergone three spinal cord 
operations and another to repair a blood clot in his left leg; has been 
subjected to consistent therapy, and has been fitted in a $15,000 computerized 
wheelchair that he controls with his breath through a strawlike "puff-and-sip" 
device in place near his head. 
</P>
<P>
Yet on a recent visit home, surrounded by family, friends and well-wishers, 
David was seldom without a broad smile on his face, kidding and being kidded, 
talking swimming with his twin brother, Daniel, and tennis with his doctor, 
Mark Wheaton. 
</P>
<P>
That afternoon, he had gone with his family to see his brother play water polo 
at the Belmont Plaza Olympic Pool in Long Beach, near where he suffered his 
injury the year before. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing my brother play was almost like seeing myself out there," David said. 
</P>
<P>
And, he added, returning to the scene of his accident "made me feel better. I 
was really calm. It was like the peace of God." 
</P>
<P>
His unfailingly positive attitude "doesn't seem strange at all," said David's 
father, Tiberius, a Romanian immigrant who works as a supervisor in the public 
works engineering division of the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
"He was obviously ready for it in a kind of supernatural way. He'll say, 
'Daddy, sometimes I look around at these kids (in the hospital), and they don't 
even know what's going on. That's so sad. I'm really lucky.' At the hospital, 
he's like a social worker, like a baby-sitter." 
</P>
<P>
David's reputation as a patient who can be relied upon to cheer up others is 
well known at Loma Linda, said Wheaton, a specialist in physical medicine and 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
"He's such a special kid," Wheaton said. "He's the best patient I ever had. He 
never wants to inconvenience anyone, and he has no thought for himself. He's 
always looking out for other people. And he knows more medicine at age 14 than 
I knew after one year of medical school. He'd be a great asset to the medical 
profession." 
</P>
<P>
David said he doesn't know whether medical studies are in his future or not 
but, thanks to a full scholarship from USC, designed to be awarded to athletes 
who suffer disabling injuries, his college education is assured. 
</P>
<P>
His hospital bills are another matter. Family insurance paid for only part of 
them. However, Meyers and other family friends have formed the David and 
Goliath Project, a grass-roots organization to raise money for David's 
rehabilitation, through the sale of sweat shirts and other fund-raising 
schemes. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers said she hopes that the organization can raise enough money to allow 
David to be treated at a specialized facility such as the Miami Project, "a 
coalition of doctors who are working on a paralysis cure for spinal injury 
victims." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, however, David is -- above all -- glad to be around to see it 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy that I'm in a good hospital and a good environment and my 
family and my friends support me," he said. "I'm in good shape. I'd like to 
walk someday, but that's not something I'm going to dwell on all the time. I 
haven't taken it as a burden or as a problem. I'm going to be fine." 
</P>
<P>
Still smiling broadly, he turned his eyes to a photographer in the room. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not just smiling for the camera," he said. "I'm smiling because I'm 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
Jason Pinches 
</P>
<P>
Jason Pinches, 16, shows not the slightest hint of self-consciousness as he 
holds his left hand up for examination, bringing the thumb and forefinger 
weakly together to show that they work, that he is still on the mend. 
</P>
<P>
The entire little finger is missing, but that is not the most remarkable 
feature. Rather, the eye is drawn to the long diagonal scar that entirely 
encircles the hand, the only visual evidence that shows that Pinches' hand was 
once entirely severed. 
</P>
<P>
It happened slightly less than a year ago. While helping his father remodel a 
house in Newport Beach, the power saw Pinches was using on a door frame got 
away from him, and the blade sliced through his hand from the base of the thumb 
to the little finger. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't panic. While his father tied his shirt around his son's upper arm and 
held it high to control the bleeding, Pinches, an Eagle Scout candidate, calmly 
explained that the severed hand needed to be kept cool. It was placed in a 
plastic bag and, when paramedics arrived five minutes later, it was put on ice. 
</P>
<P>
Pinches was flown by helicopter to UCI Medical Center, where three 
reconstructive surgeons, using microsurgery techniques and sutures thinner than 
a human hair, reattached the hand, grafting in a new vein from the young man's 
forearm and implanting an artificial joint in the ring finger. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, in a separate operation, nerves were taken from Pinches' lower 
right leg and grafted into the hand. And in May, tendons were taken from the 
side of his left arm and implanted in his left middle and ring finger. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Pinches is ready to go skiing. 
</P>
<P>
"There are these new handles on ski poles now that should work really well," he 
said. "So, hopefully, I'll be going skiing soon. I've found that you can work 
around just about everything." 
</P>
<P>
He has had to relearn such elementary tasks as dressing himself in the morning 
(it is now second nature), tying his shoelaces (he can do it with one hand) and 
carrying packages (he uses the palm and heel of his left hand, rather than the 
fingers). 
</P>
<P>
He has also had to accept the fact that doctors' original estimates of recovery 
were too high. Originally, he said, there was hope that he would recover 90% of 
the function of the hand. That figure has since been revised to 30% to 40%. 
</P>
<P>
But, Pinches said, in the last 11 months he has felt less and less limited. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me a while to realize it didn't matter that much," he said. "During 
the first few days, I didn't want to think about it, but then I thought it 
wasn't so bad. I'd seen people in the hospital who were a lot worse off than I 
was. I was frustrated sometimes, but not usually. It doesn't limit me at all 
mentally and not much physically. Studying doesn't take two hands." 
</P>
<P>
A junior at University High School in Irvine, Pinches said he intends to finish 
the final requirements to become an Eagle Scout and wants to study biochemistry 
in college. Through therapy, the hand continues to improve. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. (Robert) Bledsoe, one of the doctors who worked on me, said, 'I put your 
hand back on, but God does the work,' " Pinches said. "It's taught me what 
life's about. It really opens your eyes to what life is worth." 
</P>
<P>
Livia Groza 
</P>
<P>
Livia Groza hasn't stopped being overwhelmed since she arrived in Westminster 
early last month. 
</P>
<P>
And her son-in-law, Vasile Sofroni, still has moments when he thinks his eyes 
are playing tricks on him. 
</P>
<P>
But there are his mother-in-law and wife, in his kitchen, baking cakes for a 
friend's wedding, smiling and chatting in Romanian. 
</P>
<P>
"I come home from work sometimes," Sofroni said, "and I see her here, and I 
think maybe I am dreaming." 
</P>
<P>
Part of him still sees Groza, 55, as living in her native Romania, without 
family, suffering from a heart condition and unable to work after the Romanian 
government refused to let her work when she applied for a travel visa. 
</P>
<P>
But largely because of the Sofronis' determination to get Groza out of Romania 
and into the United States to live with them, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service allowed Groza to emigrate and begin a new life in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Her long journey actually began in 1984, when Sofroni, now 31, eluded armed 
border guards and sneaked through trenches to escape Romania and come to live 
in the West. He was later able to send for his wife and two children. 
</P>
<P>
But when attention turned to Groza, the INS said no. Despite three years of 
pleas from the Sofronis and assistance from Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden 
Grove), the agency rejected Groza's visa application in May, saying she was 
still young enough to support herself and therefore did not need to be with her 
family. 
</P>
<P>
The Sofronis decided that more direct action was necessary. In July, Sofroni 
and his wife, Lia, camped outside the federal immigration office in Westminster 
and went on what was to be an 80-hour hunger strike to call attention to 
Groza's plight. 
</P>
<P>
The strike worked. Because of media coverage, renewed help from Dornan and an 
appeal by an outgoing INS Western regional commissioner, the INS reversed its 
ruling and granted Groza her visa. 
</P>
<P>
"She met all our neighbors the second day she was here," Sofroni said. "They 
were very happy to see her. I have good neighbors here." 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Groza saw Orange County as one big Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
"Last Monday we went to Westminster Mall," Sofroni said. "She didn't believe in 
her life she would see anything like that. All the stores surprise her with 
their low prices. In Romania, you pay 10 times more. And the bright lights at 
night: Over there, it's dark. Here, she can't believe how bright everything is. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, it was like she was lost in this world with nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Groza smiled and shook her head when asked whether she gets homesick for her 
native country. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, everything is new," she said in Romanian, with her son-in-law 
interpreting. "The things I've seen here I've never seen in any other place. I 
thank God that I'm with my family." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Ridgeway 
</P>
<P>
Late in March, in the middle of his first trip away from home since being 
placed on regular kidney dialysis in January, Charles Ridgeway awoke at 4 a.m. 
to the beat of nearby helicopter blades and the sound of his son pounding on 
the door of his motor home. 
</P>
<P>
Ridgeway, his wife and daughter had driven to a remote desert area in Imperial 
County to camp and ride all-terrain vehicles, a welcome treat for the Rockwell 
International accountant, who had recently been forced to undergo four hours of 
dialysis a week to combat a hereditary degenerative kidney disease. 
</P>
<P>
He had been placed on a list of kidney transplant candidates at United Western 
Medical Center-Santa Ana, but he knew that finding a suitable donor often takes 
one to two years or more. Also, Ridgeway's blood type, B-positive, occurs in 
just 15% of the population. A donor kidney with the same type was needed. 
</P>
<P>
But, while Ridgeway was camping in the desolate, high sand dunes near the town 
of Glamis, a kidney was found. But it would become unusable in a matter of 
hours. And a beeper that Ridgeway wore to alert him if a kidney had been found 
had a range of about 50 miles; Ridgeway was about 200 miles away. A frantic 
search began. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital alerted the Orange County Search and Rescue Team, which in turn 
called the Imperial County Sheriff's Department and a local radio station. KNX 
Radio, whose signal is strong enough to reach Baja California, broadcast 
messages every 10 minutes but got no reply. A ranger from the Bureau of Land 
Management searched the area where the Ridgeways were thought to be, without 
result. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, Ridgeway's son, Matt, was already driving to the desert to search 
for his father. Before leaving, the younger Ridgeway had talked to KNX 
reporter-helicopter pilot Bob Tur, who decided to fly down to Glamis with a Los 
Angeles police officer co-pilot and two Orange County rescue crew members to 
cover the story and search for Ridgeway. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they spotted Matt Ridgeway, frantically waving. Running low on fuel, 
they picked him up. The son directed them to his father's campsite. 
</P>
<P>
Within a minute of landing, the elder Ridgeway was hustled into the helicopter 
and flown to Brawley's airport, where he was picked up by a private plane and 
flown to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The successful surgery was performed on Easter Sunday, with about four hours to 
spare. 
</P>
<P>
Eight months later, Ridgeway is euphoric. 
</P>
<P>
"Things have gone so great, I can't believe it," he said. "I went back to work 
June 6, and I've been working full time since. I've got so many things to be 
thankful for." 
</P>
<P>
His energy and appetite, both at low ebb while he was undergoing dialysis, have 
returned. The extensive menu of drugs he must take regularly to keep his body 
from rejecting the kidney have not produced side effects. The kidney is 
functioning perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
"I had one little rejection session (early in the recovery) where I had to go 
back to the hospital for four days of drug treatment," Ridgeway said. "But 
that's not uncommon. Right now, everything is on the good side of the ledger." 
</P>
<P>
Ridgeway, 47, has even become something of a TV star. His story was dramatized 
-- with actors playing the roles of Ridgeway, his family and his rescuers -- on 
the series, "Rescue 911." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is the real-life saviors he remembers, and they make him smile 
broadly. "The support I've received . . . I've got such a list of heroes, you 
wouldn't believe."

ASK THE VET: SURGERY MIGHT BE NEEDED LATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. GLENN ERICSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q My 7-year-old female Shih Tzu suddenly developed a sore neck. My local vet 
treated her for several days, then referred me to an orthopedic surgeon 
veterinarian. My little dog was very inactive, cried out when touched on top of 
her neck area and walked stiffly and only when urged. The orthopedic 
veterinarian X-rayed her and recommended removal of a portion of the vertebra, 
saying it was a pinched-nerve, slipped-disc situation. The charge for surgery 
would be about $1,000, which I could not do, so I have continued with 
medication prescribed by my local vet -- prednisone, Robaxin and Valium. Now, 
one month after the onset, she seems OK. She runs, plays and acts quite 
normally. 
</P>
<P>
I would like a second opinion, please. Would it be injurious to her to continue 
medication (side effects, etc.)? If the neck situation is eased, what are the 
chances of reoccurrence? Is surgery on a little dog's vertebra usually 
successful? She has had a lower back problem very similar to the problem with 
her neck but closer to her tail. Both times, a cortisone shot cleaned it up. 
The last time was nearly nine months ago. Should this be treated with surgery 
too? I would really appreciate your comments about my dog's problem. 
</P>
<P>
Lois Copenhagen, 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
A From your description of your dog's signs and the diagnosis of both your 
veterinarian and the referral surgeon, it is apparent that your dog has a disc 
problem of the cervical spine (neck), which is relatively common for her breed 
and age. Treatment depends on the severity of the signs and the potential 
damage done to the nerve roots or the spinal cord. 
</P>
<P>
Many dogs respond well to long-term medication such as the prednisone and 
restriction of activity. The use of a harness instead of a collar is mandatory 
to prevent further injury to the neck. If the damage is more extensive, with 
the disc material putting pressure on the nervous tissue, and your dog becomes 
weak and suffers more pain, surgery may be your only alternative. Success with 
surgery is generally very good, depending again on the condition of the dog's 
neck and her neurological status. If her weakness and pain become severe, 
surgery may not be as successful. 
</P>
<P>
Long-term medication is generally given on a reduced protocol in order to 
prevent any side effects and yet provide the relief necessary for your dog. You 
should follow your veterinarian's advice and have her checked frequently for 
any signs of a deteriorating condition. Reoccurrence is a definite possibility, 
and surgery may be her only alternative for a normal life, if she does get 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
Q Where can I purchase a healthy cockatiel for Christmas? I have seen them for 
sale at swap meets and wonder if it is OK to buy them there. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Twain,

</P>
<P>
A Any time you want to purchase a pet, it is best done through a reputable 
breeder or, for birds, a pet shop that specializes in birds and their 
accessories, such as food and cages. Be sure to ask about the pet's age, sex 
(if possible), special diets, exercise needs and any potential illness or 
problems. Avoid the quiet recluse or any bird that just doesn't seem right to 
you. Birds are very good at masking their illnesses, so you must be very 
observant. Hand-tamed birds are going to be more expensive than those that 
aren't tamed, so be sure to ask how the bird was raised and if it will need any 
special training. Avoid any smuggled birds, regardless of cost. 
</P>
<P>
Q With the cold season starting, do I need to keep my dogs indoors, or is it OK 
to put them out at night? They are both shepherd mixes and have good coats and 
love to be outdoors. They are out at nights now. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Buchanan, 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
A If your dogs enjoy the outdoors and are healthy, it would be OK as long as 
you do provide shelter from the rain and dampness. Most dogs like to come in at 
night, so if the house is off-limits, you might give them access to the garage. 
If the weather turns extremely cold, do keep them in.

FAMILY LIFE: THE IDEA IS TO SHARE THE BOUNTY, NOT COUNT IT

<P>
I got a call from a reader last week who complained that she was "sick and 
tired of reading all those stories about the homeless" in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Well, so am I. 
</P>
<P>
I'm also weary from reading stories about child abuse, crime in general, wars 
and other assaults on humanity. 
</P>
<P>
What to do about that fatigue is where the reader and I part company, however. 
</P>
<P>
Her solution is to cancel the paper, to ignore Socrates' advice that "it's 
better to buy knowledge than to buy food and drink." 
</P>
<P>
I think this day in particular is not the day to pretend life exists only in 
our own dining rooms. It is a day to expand the family. 
</P>
<P>
The Pilgrims, you will note, did not break off into small groups whistling, "I 
Got Mine, Babe." 
</P>
<P>
Thanksgiving is supposed to be a day of sharing the bounty, not counting it. 
And to be grateful that serendipity or something more powerful blessed most of 
us with more than we need. 
</P>
<P>
Sharing is easy. There are missions and shelters all over the county -- too 
many on one hand and not enough on the other. 
</P>
<P>
Too many because it's grotesque to think any are necessary in the midst of 
Orange County's affluence. Not enough because, well, there just aren't. 
</P>
<P>
My reader, or ex-reader by now, I suppose, said the homeless were mostly "bums 
and drunks who could find work if they wanted it." And I guess there are some 
in that category squeezed in among those who are physically, emotionally or 
mentally disabled, or old, or victims of plain bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
For the sake of argument, we can even overlook those we refer to as the 
"working poor," people whose pitiful wages can't cover both food and shelter, 
let alone clothing, medical care and other things we take for granted. 
</P>
<P>
What haunts me are the children, somewhere around 4,000 of them in Orange 
County by some estimates, who are members of those families. 
</P>
<P>
I cringe when I consider what life must be like for them, and not just on 
Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Forbath, director of the Share Our Selves program in Costa Mesa, suggests 
that people think on this Thanksgiving of all the little things a home means. 
The big things, after all, are pretty obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Think of just how often the word enters into your daily speech. 
</P>
<P>
You're tired from shopping and the kids are acting up; you say, "OK, that's it, 
we're going home now." 
</P>
<P>
You have a bad day at work or on the golf course; you think, "Boy, I can hardly 
wait to get home." 
</P>
<P>
"Wait until I get you home" can be an amorous promise or an ominous threat, 
depending on who is on the receiving end. 
</P>
<P>
You get the idea, but humor me and make a mental list anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty startling to consider not being able to say any of those, isn't 
it?" Forbath asks. 
</P>
<P>
The Family Service Assn. of Orange County reminds us that this is National 
Family Week. "Families Matter" is the theme of the observance, focusing 
attention on families and their importance to individuals and society. 
</P>
<P>
FSAOC sent a packet that included a list of "Togetherness Tips," suggestions on 
what families could do as units that don't cost a lot of money or take a lot of 
planning. They run from preparing meals together to visiting a museum to simply 
sitting down and going over the family album. 
</P>
<P>
One I particularly like is the idea of spending a few minutes to take some 
cookies or a small gift to -- and spend some time with -- a senior citizen. 
</P>
<P>
Our acts of kindness should not be seen only by the bank's computer. If we want 
our children to care and to be caring individuals, it seems to me we should 
provide the example and ask them to be involved too. 
</P>
<P>
I can still remember as a child being told, whenever I wasted food, to think of 
the starving people of Europe. For all the personal insight and knowledge I had 
at that age, my parents might as well have suggested I think of the lemurs of 
the Amazon Basin. 
</P>
<P>
The real world of the homeless and the needy isn't that far away. It's just 
around the corner from your house and mine, and I for one want my kids to see 
it and to lend a hand.

This is a story about politics and pork rinds. Government and grapes. The 
history of the U.S. presidency bulges with interesting tales about the food 
that fueled our country's chief executives. 
</P>
<P>
If you thought that nutrition was the brainchild of the 1980s, you'll be 
surprised to learn that President James Garfield popularized the term more than 
100 years ago. Somebody had to do it. The two previous Administrations served 
almost as many courses at state dinners as there were stars on the flag. A 
typical menu wallowed in thick sauces, rich desserts and enough foreign words 
to open a language school. 
</P>
<P>
When Garfield took office, he insisted on simple, wholesome food. Guests sat 
down to such basic, no-nonsense fare as "Mrs. Garfield's White Loaf Bread" and 
"Extra-Fluffy Mashed Potatoes." Garfield's tenure lasted only a few months; 
given a chance, he might have started the oat bran fad early. 
</P>
<P>
Our country has a long, if misguided, tradition of equating rich dishes with 
elegant dining. It is probably not any President's fault that when we cook for 
company, we add whipping cream to everything but the roast. Still, some popular 
notions about entertaining date back to a time when the White House led the 
social scene. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential styles vary, but a heavy entertaining schedule seems to come with 
the territory. When George Washington was President, he held a reception every 
Tuesday, a congressional dinner each Thursday and frequent state banquets. On 
Friday nights, his wife, Martha, took over the drawing room for yet another 
gathering. Refreshments or meals were served at all these events. 
</P>
<P>
Away from the demands of their public host role, our Presidents have been 
individuals with diverse palates and a varying commitment to good health. Some 
rode horses or took brisk walks each morning. Others exercised most vigorously 
with a knife and fork. 
</P>
<P>
Like many people of their time, William and Ida McKinley believed in getting 
the day off to a substantial start. Large portions of eggs, hot breads, 
potatoes, steak or chops, fish, fruit and coffee were standard morning fare. In 
"The Presidents' Cookbook," researchers Poppy Cannon and Patricia Brooks say 
lunch and dinner at the McKinleys ran the rather short gamut from abundant to 
Gargantuan. 
</P>
<P>
William Howard Taft weighed 332 pounds at his inauguration. Between enormous 
meals, he nibbled salted almonds. Under doctor's orders to reduce his daily 
breakfast steak from 12 ounces to eight, Taft complied . . . when his wife was 
there to watch him. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, then as now, diet was just one part of a President's life style. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to compare other ages," said Dr. John LaRosa, dean of clinical 
affairs at George Washington University's Medical School. "People lived 
differently. They walked more, and fewer people in the upper classes smoked 
cigarettes. The impact of a high-cholesterol diet may have been different." In 
fact, the rate of heart disease was actually lower, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Not since Thomas Jefferson introduced waffles and ice cream has any President 
intentionally raised eating to the level of a real issue. However, historians 
have retained enough tidbits about presidential diet to rate a separate 
category on "Jeopardy." Would-be contestants interested in boning up are 
referred to "The Presidents' Cookbook" and "The First Ladies Cook Book," with 
historical text by Margaret Klapthor Brown. 
</P>
<P>
For example: 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Coolidge kept crackers and preserves at his elbow for a convenient 
snack. 
</P>
<P>
James Buchanan liked grapes so much that he tended an arbor at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Zachary Taylor's three favorite foods were fried oysters, stewed oysters and 
roasted oysters. 
</P>
<P>
Ulysses S. Grant once said: "I refuse to eat anything that goes about on two 
legs." 
</P>
<P>
As executive chef for five recent presidents, Henry Haller found modern first 
families to be weight-conscious and open to nutritional advice. When 
interviewed for an article in Weight Watchers Magazine, Haller identified a 
dilemma many less-famous cooks will recognize: removing the sodium and fat from 
favorite dishes without making them taste like recipe cards. 
</P>
<P>
Haller succeeded by seasoning with herbs instead of salt and substituting 
low-fat ingredients wherever possible. That meant using bouillon instead of 
cream in chipped beef for Lyndon Johnson, who topped his Western salad with 
low-calorie dressing when dining privately. 
</P>
<P>
LBJ's hearty Texas appetite got the better of him at times. The Johnsons' 
family cook, Zephyr Wright, is said to have left a note under LBJ's plate: "Eat 
what I put in front of you, and don't ask for any more, and don't complain." 
</P>
<P>
From Southern fried chicken for the Carters to light, California cuisine for 
the Reagans, menus reflected regional tastes during Haller's 21 years on the 
job. The American palate expanded accordingly. When you think about 
presidential influence, consider how many more people now know that okra is 
something you can eat. 
</P>
<P>
Even before there was scientific evidence to back him up, Jefferson attributed 
his long life to eating many vegetables and little animal fat. One person's 
health doesn't constitute proof, but studies of whole populations suggest that 
diet contributes to the clogged arteries that can lead to heart attacks. It 
turns out that this forefather knew best. 
</P>
<P>
So how about those pork rinds, the twice-fried munchie that President Bush made 
famous? 
</P>
<P>
"It's OK to eat almost anything if the quantity doesn't break the bank as far 
as total intake of fat and cholesterol goes," LaRosa said. "You have to 
consider the total diet, not just one snack."
