BILLY LEE; CHILD STAR OF '30S, '40S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Billy Lee, a child star of the 1930s and '40s probably best known for his 
starring role in "The Biscuit Eater," a beloved film about two boys and a dog, 
has died in Beaumont, Calif., of heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
Daily Variety reported in its Tuesday editions that Lee had died last Friday of 
heart failure in San Gorgonio Hospital. He was 60. 
</P>
<P>
From 1934 ("Wagon Wheels") to 1943 ("War Dogs"), Lee appeared in pictures with 
Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Randolph Scott, Jack Benny, Donald O'Connor and George 
Burns and Gracie Allen. 
</P>
<P>
For "Cocoanut Grove" in 1938, a story of Fred MacMurray's excursion boat band 
making it to the big time in Los Angeles, he learned to play the drums. That 
led him to form the Billie Lee Band. He also was a dancer and toured in 
vaudeville. 
</P>
<P>
Besides 1940's "The Biscuit Eater" (remade by Disney with a new cast in 1972), 
Lee was seen in "Hold Back the Dawn," "Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch," "Sons 
of the Legion," "Boy Trouble" and "Night Work." 
</P>
<P>
Early in his career he also was seen in the "Our Gang" film series. 
</P>
<P>
Lee, whose real name was Billy Lee Schlensker, is survived by his wife, 
Madeleine, three daughters, a son and seven grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
Roberto Arias, a former Panamanian ambassador and the husband of British ballet 
dancer Margot Fonteyn, has died, sources close to the family said. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
Arias had been partially paralyzed since a political opponent shot him in 1964. 
He died of heart failure Wednesday, a day after surgery for cancer, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A law graduate of Cambridge University and the son and nephew of Panamanian 
presidents, Arias was ambassador to the United Nations and to England. 
</P>
<P>
In 1964, he was a member of the legislative assembly, the country's congress. 
He owned the newspaper La Hora and was director of the daily Panama America, 
which are no longer published. 
</P>
<P>
Arias married Fonteyn, a dame commander of the British Empire, in 1954. Since 
1981, they had lived on a 500-acre cattle farm on the Pacific Ocean near the 
village of El Higo, 60 miles southwest of Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
Since retiring in 1979 at the age of 60, Dame Margot has helped care for the 
farm and has advised the National Ballet Company of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Arias has four children by a previous marriage.

RAINY-DAY PLANNING FOR DRY TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Historically, the aim of California water districts has been to develop 
so-called "assured supplies." That did not mean just having enough to get by in 
any one year, but always having enough to meet demand in the worst imaginable 
drought. Under that sort of best-case operation, most districts would enjoy a 
surplus in most years. But times have changed. Even though population grows 
relentlessly in Southern California, it no longer is possible to just go out 
and get more water. The trick is to stretch the existing supply as far as it 
will go. To this end, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is 
going underground. 
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan has approved expenditure of $1.2 million to begin work on 
development of an underground water-storage system that will help buffer the 
district against future dry years. The project is going forward in cooperation 
with the 132,000-acre Arvin-Edison Water Storage District, a big farm 
distributor of federal Central Valley Project water in the southeastern corner 
of the San Joaquin Valley in Kern County. 
</P>
<P>
When Met has ample supplies available from the state Water Project, it will 
store some of the water -- up to a total of 850,000 acre-feet -- in the aquifer 
under Arvin-Edison. The program will increase the dependability of 
Arvin-Edison's canal supply, which fluctuates from 10,000 to 353,000 acre-feet 
each year. The additional water stored in the aquifer will keep the water table 
from dropping and therefore make it more economical to pump from wells. The 
program also will keep the water table from falling to levels that would be 
harmful to crops. Maintenance of the storage would increase Metropolitan's 
reliable water supply by about 100,000 acre-feet a year, enough to provide the 
residential needs of about 200,000 Southern California families. 
</P>
<P>
The cost to Metropolitan will be in the purchase of up to 600 acres of land, 
construction of water-spreading grounds and the drilling of new wells -- 
facilities that will become the property of Arvin-Edison. But these days, water 
is sometimes more precious than money. The program is a good one for both 
agencies and for the 14.7 million Southern Californians who rely on 
Metropolitan for some or all of their water.

<P>
We knew and loved Father Ignacio Martin-Baro, the academic vice rector of the 
University of Central America, murdered Nov. 16 by a government death squad. 
</P>
<P>
We watch in horror as our leaders call for a full and proper investigation of 
this murder by the Cristiani government -- a government of the Arena party, the 
party of the death squads who have tortured, raped, murdered and "disappeared" 
countless numbers of Salvadorans and have never yet been brought to justice. 
</P>
<P>
With over 70,000 Salvadorans dead and a million refugees in our country because 
they fear for their lives at home, for President Bush, the State Department and 
members of Congress not to know at this point the true nature of justice in El 
Salvador is a moral crime.

In his plausible account of the woes of Central America, Schram alludes to the

MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Surprise, surprise, surprise. What do you know? After six or seven years of 
dousing with malathion it seems the infestations are getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
Do I remember the dousing of flies in Africa that finally developed a 
DDT-resistant fly? I think if we work on it we can do the job again. 
</P>
<P>
Let's see -- maybe we could ship our malathion-resistant flies around the world 
so that we could increase our sales of malathion. We used DDT so extensively 
that we almost extinguished one species of birds before someone got the picture 
that indiscriminate chemical warfare on bugs is not the answer to pest control. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of killing off the good guys with the pest, it makes more sense to help 
the good guys. Killing the ladybugs and any other helpful insect, to say 
nothing of bees, small birds and fish, is not my idea of good sense.

MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many of us are concerned about the arrogant and ignorant attitude of urban and 
suburban residents toward the Mediterranean fruit fly problem, which 
undoubtedly was caused by someone in the greater Los Angeles area carelessly 
and illegally bringing contaminated fruit into Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is a $15-billion business in California. That represents a lot of 
taxes and a lot of employment. It provides the fresh produce Californians are 
privileged to have available year-round. Because of a few thoughtless, selfish 
people bringing fruit into California, this industry and its many jobs are 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Now the urban residents are inconvenienced by malathion applications. Are they 
in an uproar about those who transported contaminated fruit into the state 
(unnecessarily, I might add, as all sorts of exotic fruits which have passed 
inspection are available in stores)? No. Their concern is the malathion being 
sprayed at night, when least exposure is assured. 
</P>
<P>
Logic says that those areas being sprayed contain those who started this deadly 
infestation. We must stop the Medfly before it destroys our food supply. 
</P>
<P>
Those of us who live in the outlying agricultural land resent the urbanites' 
lack of concern for our livelihood.

EL SALVADOR: PROFOUND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGES ARE NEEDED, BUT TO CALL FOR 
THEM IS TO CALL DOWN ON ONESELF THE SAME FATE AS THE SIX MURDERED JESUITS.

<P>
The barbaric slaughter of six Jesuits and two co-workers in El Salvador last 
week continues to reverberate through the United States. Although Congress 
inexplicably refused to send the modest signal of withholding part of U.S. 
military assistance until evidence of serious pursuit and prosecution of the 
murderers is manifest, it is clear that the latest atrocities could be a threat 
to new military aid. 
</P>
<P>
Such predictions are cold comfort to Salvadorans caught in the cross fire of 
insurgency and repression, but they have significance for the U.S. tie to the 
violence. It is the American connection that protests rightly focused on during 
the past week; Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk, president of the Catholic Bishops 
Conference wrote President Bush, calling for U.S. diplomatic action to press 
the investigation of the killings and to protect civilians. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, the United States has been part of the war in El Salvador 
because we have contributed $4 billion to the Salvadoran government. It is not 
enough to deplore the violence; we are part of the process that has sustained 
it. 
</P>
<P>
From Archbishop Oscar A. Romero in 1980 to Archbishop Rivera y Damas today, the 
Roman Catholic Church has defined the roots of the crisis in terms of social 
justice and human rights. A long-suffering population -- the vast majority of 
the country -- has experienced neither protection of their rights nor 
participation in their society. A marginalized peasantry, a harassed labor 
movement and a persecuted church testify to the need for profound socioeconomic 
change. To call for these changes is to be labeled radical, or communist, and 
to be vulnerable to the kind of brutal attacks experienced by the Jesuits. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the attacks continue: In the past week, security forces have raided 
Catholic and Protestant offices; threats have been made on the government radio 
against Archbishop Rivera and auxiliary Bishop Rosa Chavez, and religious 
workers have been expelled from the country. An astonishing precedent was set 
by the country's attorney general -- responsible for investigating the murder 
of the Jesuits -- when he wrote to the Pope, urging the removal of bishops from 
El Salvador. The facade of the letter was to protect the bishops; the intent 
was clear: Church support for the poor is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
The murdered Jesuits and the threatened church workers who carry on their 
witness should be seen as representatives of a wider movement. A process 
initiated by Vatican Council II produced a church committed to "the option for 
the poor" throughout Latin America. In Central America, the theme was given a 
specific application by Archbishop Romero: The church was called to accompany 
the poor in their struggle for human rights and social justice. The fulfillment 
of this vocation has produced martyrs -- bishops, priests, sisters and laity. 
</P>
<P>
To see the Jesuits as accompanying the people focuses attention on all 
Salvadoran deaths, which do not attract the attention of the assassination of 
six priests. In the past month, more than 600 Salvadorans have been killed. 
While the attacks on church officials have consistently come from the right, 
both government and insurgency have treated the civilian populace as only a 
means to their ends. 
</P>
<P>
As we celebrate Thanksgiving week, all this brutality can seem distant: awful, 
yet removed. But the United States is not removed from the war. U.S. aid has 
sustained the Salvadoran government. Advocates of U.S. policy quickly point out 
the results of this expenditure: The insurgency has been contained, if not 
defeated, elections have been held and some reform of the military has been 
pursued. Critics of the policy point to other results: intensified war, an 
escalation of the technological violence through expanded air power, an elected 
government that seemingly has no control over death squads and hardly any over 
its military and Treasury police. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of the debate about U.S. aid, some realities are clear. The United 
States cannot avoid some responsibility for the violence, and several immediate 
steps by Washington are in order. First, it must be made clear to the 
Salvadoran government and its military that this "open season" on church 
personnel will not be tolerated; more specifically, it will not be funded. 
</P>
<P>
Second, effective, aggressive pursuit and prosecution of the murderers of the 
Jesuits and their co-workers will be a definitive test in the next round of 
appropriations for military aid. The message should be: No arrests, no 
prosecution, no aid. Third, the civilian population must not be treated as 
"suspected sympathizers" or "suspected subversives" but as civilians, immune 
from attack. Fourth, the International Red Cross must be allowed access to all 
areas of conflict and provided the necessary protection to do its work. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth, churches designated as places of refuge must be respected; by extension, 
church agencies should be allowed to function in safety. Sixth, the Soviet 
Union needs to be engaged by President Bush at the Malta summit; Moscow must 
deliver equally firm messages about protecting civilians, prohibiting the 
taking of hostages and respect for religious and humanitarian agencies to the 
insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after a decade of war, the Central American peace process stands out 
as the reasonable, humane and moral imperative to be pursued by all parties. 
The Salvadoran bishops' continued call for dialogue leading to negotiation is 
the alternative to the violence and madness that has engulfed El Salvador for a 
decade and, last week, claimed the lives of eight of its noblest citizens.

CHURCH-STATE SEPARATION IS BISHOP'S PAWN; 
</P>
<P>
ABORTION: IF LEO MAHER, WHO IS BARRING A PRO-CHOICE POLITICIAN FROM COMMUNION, 
HAD THROWN HIS WEIGHT AROUND IN 1960, J.F.K. WOULD HAVE BEEN TROUNCED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Meet Leo T. Maher. He's the fellow who could have succeeded where Hubert 
Humphrey and Richard Nixon failed. If he had spoken out 30 years ago as he did 
just the other day, he would have single-handedly caused the defeat of John 
Fitzgerald Kennedy in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Or, to put it another way: 
</P>
<P>
Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher of San Diego would have single-handedly 
ended Kennedy's quest to become America's first Catholic President. 
</P>
<P>
The bishop would have defeated Kennedy on the "Catholic issue" -- would have 
exposed Kennedy's eloquent statements on the separation of church and state for 
the sham that the Roman Catholic Church now seems to be telling us, by 
implication, that it thinks they were. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey, in the spring of 1960, was too decent and principled to raise the 
issue of religion in a race for the presidency. So was Nixon that fall. But 
Maher would have gladly borne the cross that would have become the favorite 
bludgeon of the anti-Catholic, anti-Kennedy forces. 
</P>
<P>
Remember those times: None other than the Rev. Norman Vincent Peale convened a 
gathering of Protestant leaders during the 1960 campaign to "question the 
loyalty of any Catholic candidate for the presidency and the wisdom of choosing 
any man of that faith for the high office," wrote Theodore H. White in his epic 
"The Making of the President 1960." 
</P>
<P>
Three decades later, a Roman Catholic bishop is making Peale's point. Due to 
circumstances beyond Maher's control, the fate of the nation is not up for 
grabs this year, but California's may be. 
</P>
<P>
In the campaign to fill a seat in the state Senate, Maher has made the private 
religious views of one candidate a dominant issue. Perhaps emboldened by a 
tough statement just adopted by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, 
Maher declared that he is barring from the sacrament of communion Assemblywoman 
Lucy Killea, a soft-spoken 67-year-old Democrat who looks a lot like Sandra Day 
O'Connor, because of her campaign statements supporting a woman's right to 
decide whether or not to have an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Killea's opponent in the traditionally Republican Senate district is an 
assemblywoman who is anti-abortion. Killea's position is that in public office, 
she should not impose her personal views as a Catholic upon those who are not 
Catholics and have different views and preferences. Polls show that her 
district favors choice on abortion, which she supports. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Bishop Maher. He turned his letter to Killea into a public debate, saying 
that her position on abortion puts her "in complete contradiction to the moral 
teaching of the Catholic Church. I have no other choice but to deny you the 
right to receive the Eucharist in the Catholic Church." 
</P>
<P>
Picture now a new, pivotal Great Debate of 1960. Forget the Nixon-Kennedy 
debates. This is the crucial Maher-Kennedy debate. 
</P>
<P>
Hear Maher (who actually said this to reporters on Nov. 16, 1989): "We're doing 
this because the politicians have failed to recognize their obligation to bring 
their Catholic faith and morality into the public arena. We are trying to teach 
them, direct them, that that is their obligation." 
</P>
<P>
Now hear John F. Kennedy (who said this in a speech to Protestant ministers in 
Houston, on Sept. 12, 1960): "I believe in an America where the separation of 
church and state is absolute -- where no Catholic prelate would tell the 
President (should he be a Catholic) how to act. . . . I believe in an America 
that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish; where no public 
official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the 
Pope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source; 
where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon 
the general populace or the public acts of its officials. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Maher: "We don't need Catholic politicians who are not truly Catholic." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy: "I do not speak for my church on public matters and the church does 
not speak for me. Whatever issue may come before me as President, if I should 
be elected -- on birth control, divorce, censorship, gambling or any other 
subject -- I will make my decision in accordance . . . with what my conscience 
tells me to be in the national interest, and without regard to outside 
religious pressure or dictate. And no power or threat of punishment could cause 
me to decide otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960 election, where there was no Maher-Kennedy debate to reinforce 
popular prejudices and fears, Kennedy received 49.7% of the votes to Nixon's

AROUND THE CORNER, PRAGUE SPRING REDUX; 
</P>
<P>
CZECHOSLOVAKIA: THE HATED OFFICIALS WHO 'INVITED' THE SOVIETS INTO PRAGUE IN 
'68 ARE ON THEIR WAY OUT, AND WITH THEM GOES THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S POWER. IN 
THE WINGS IS ALEXANDER DUBCEK.

By KAREL KOVANDA, Karel Kovanda is a software industry manager in Santa Cruz. 
He was a student leader in Prague in 1968.

<TEXT>
<P>
This week, Czechoslovakia's opposition demanded the resignation of six people: 
Gustav Husak, the country's doddering 77-year-old president; Milos Jakes, the 
reigning party boss; Karel Hoffman, a central committee secretary; Jan Fojtik, 
the party man in charge of ideology; Miroslav Zavadil, the trade union 
overlord; and Alois Indra, the geriatric, ailing speaker of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Why these six? With the exception of Husak, they have one thing in common: They 
are the most prominent "inviters" still in office, and universally despised as 
such. 
</P>
<P>
The word "inviters" refers to the group of 18 reactionary Communist leaders 
who, in August, 1968, invited the Soviet Union to crush the eight-month-old 
Prague Spring. Issuing that invitation amounted to an act of high treason. Fear 
of retribution motivated this group in power to refuse, until recently, any 
dialogue with the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition is disparate and variegated. Students are active as never before 
in the country's history. And several groups have recently gathered under an 
umbrella called the Civic Forum, which features at least four elements: Charter 
77, the senior civil-rights organization in all of Eastern Europe; Protestants 
and Catholics, who gathered some 300,000 signatures under a petition demanding 
greater freedoms; the political club Obroda ("Rebirth"), which includes the 
liberal former party leaders who lost out after the invasion; and the Socialist 
Party, one of the tiny non-Communist legal parties whose Johnny-come-lately 
leadership finally woke up. 
</P>
<P>
The personnel changes demanded by the opposition were expected to start today; 
the Central Committee was meeting in emergency session and Jakes, perhaps with 
others, was widely expected to be replaced. Curiously, who will take Jakes' 
place is no longer all-important. Even in Eastern Europe, the top party 
position isn't what it used to be. Does anyone even remember who heads the 
Polish Communist Party, for example? 
</P>
<P>
As democracy sweeps through the region, Communist parties have to share power. 
They wilt, wither, split -- even get disbanded. Meanwhile, real power is 
shifting to the presidency, the job to which the most astute politicians 
aspire. In East Germany, Egon Krenz, who now has it all, is interested in 
giving up his party mantle, the better to hold the presidency. In Hungary, Imre 
Pozsgay helped create the office of president, to which he hopes to be elected, 
as Mikhail Gorbachev was in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
In Czechoslovakia, the presidency has been an office of critical importance 
since it was first occupied by Thomas Masaryk in 1918. More often than not, 
however, it was occupied by mediocrities. In the coming months, the country 
will be looking to this office for leadership, inspiration and steady 
direction. Mediocrities -- and the country is full of them -- need not apply. 
</P>
<P>
As Husak resigns, and resign he must, there will be only one person in the 
country with the stature, the charisma, the political will, the confidence of 
the people, and, most critically, the confidence of the Soviets: Alexander 
Dubcek. 
</P>
<P>
This politician who, after his election two decades ago to the most powerful 
job in the country, went to an ice-hockey match instead of immediately starting 
to purge his enemies, may have been naive then, but he has had a long time for 
reflection. He lived in obscurity as a minor government pencil-pusher until his 
retirement a few years ago. Only recently was he allowed contact with the 
outside world. 
</P>
<P>
But last November, he visited Italy to receive an honorary doctorate of 
philosophy from the University of Bologna. He returned a changed man. There is 
no sign of depression, no sign of resignation. In May, he visited the playright 
Vaclav Havel after Havel's release, once again, from prison. He has been 
talking to foreign journalists and writing for the foreign press. He has 
approached leaders of the countries that invaded Czechoslovakia in 1986, asking 
them to reconsider and reevaluate their actions. He splits his time between 
Bratislava and Prague, conferring with his colleagues from the Obroda club. Day 
by day, he sounds less like a retired bureaucrat and more like a politician 
ready to make the comeback of a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming weeks, Czechoslovakia's parliament, awakening from its doldrums, 
may well elect Dubcek to the office that will take him to the Prague Castle. 
The romantic in me envisions him presiding over the rebirth of democracy, 
joining Masaryk as the country's most beloved leader of the century.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;

W. VIRGINIA ROLLS PAST SYRACUSE

<TEXT>
<P>
Fullback Rico Tyler scored the winning touchdown on a one-yard run in the third 
quarter as No. 17 West Virginia capitalized on a turnover and beat Syracuse 
24-17 Thursday night at Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Preston Waters preserved the victory by intercepting a fourth-down 
desperation pass at the West Virginia three-yard line in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia junior quarterback Major Harris became the first player in 
college football history to pass for 5,000 yards and run for 2,000 in a career. 
Harris rushed for 95 yards, raising his total to 2,144, and added 182 passing 
yards for a three-year total of 5,054. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia drove 46 yards on 13 plays for the winning touchdown after 
Syracuse halfback Michael Owens fumbled and defensive back Lawrence Drumgoole 
recovered at the Orangemen's 46. The Mountaineers also got one-yard scoring 
runs from Harris and tailback Eugene Napoleon. 
</P>
<P>
The Mountaineers, who limited Syracuse to just seven offensive plays in the 
third quarter while scoring 10 points to erase a 17-14 halftime deficit, ended 
their regular season 8-2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Cornell 20, Penn 6 -- Todd Nicholson ran for two touchdowns as the Big Red 
snapped a five-game losing streak at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the fifth straight for the Quakers, who shared the Ivy crown last 
year with Cornell but dropped into a fifth-place tie at 2-5 with the Big Red 
and Brown. Cornell and Penn finished at 4-6 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Cornell piled up 266 yards rushing, led by fullback John McNiff's 98 yards in 
22 carries.

FURUSETH WEAVES WAY TO WORLD CUP SKI TITLE

<TEXT>
<P>
Ole Christian Furuseth of Norway said he knew he had a flawless first run at 
Thursday's World Cup men's giant slalom. But the second? 
</P>
<P>
Then he saw his time. 
</P>
<P>
"My first run was perfect," Furuseth said after his first giant slalom victory 
of the season. "I was able to keep the fastest line through the steep part at 
the top of the course and could keep up the speed to the end. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't so sure about my second run," said Furuseth, who raised his fists in 
the air in a victory celebration as Norwegian spectators burst into song when 
his time for the second run was posted. "I tried to let the skis go at the top, 
but I thought they were going a little slow." 
</P>
<P>
Furuseth may have thought he was going too slow on his second run, but his time 
was the fastest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Furuseth finished the 48-gate course on Willy's Run in 1:07.30 in the first run 
and improved to 1:07.26 on the second. His combined time of 2:14.56 was more 
than a second better than the 2:16.03 clocking of Switzerland's Pirmin 
Zubriggen, who finished in 1:08.32 on his first run and in 1:07.71 on the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
Zurbriggen had watched four racers before him fall on the man-made snow 
surface, and he skied cautiously on his final run. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't take chances on my second run because I knew about all the problems 
some racers were having," Zurbriggen said. "I was trying to find a good rhythm. 
I'm pleased with my results." 
</P>
<P>
Lars Boerje Eriksson of Sweden was among those who fell on the second run. He 
was third after the first run, but his fall helped Italian Ivano Camozzi finish 
third for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Camozzi finished in 1:09.08 on his first run, good for eighth place. But his 
second-run time of 1:07.49 gave him a two-run total of 2:16.57. Armin Bittner 
of West Germany finished fourth in 2:16.63 and Hubert Strolz of Austria was 
fifth at 2:16.98. 
</P>
<P>
No American finished the race. Felix McGrath and Kyle Rasmussen failed to make 
the cut of 30 skiers to qualify for the second run. Tiger Shaw, Christopher 
Berra and Matthew Reid Grosjean failed to finish the first run. 
</P>
<P>
The men's giant slalom was the first race in the four-day event, which features 
about 130 racers from 18 nations. 
</P>
<P>
The women were scheduled to run their giant slalom today and the slalom on 
Saturday. The men will compete in the slalom on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Furuseth, who finished fourth in last year's World Cup standings, entered this 
weekend with the lead in the overall standings following the tour's opening 
races. 
</P>
<P>
He was second to Eriksson in the season's first giant slalom, run in Australia.

HARNESS RACING RETURNS TO LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harness racing will return to Southern California tonight at Los Alamitos Race 
Course. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Lloyd Arnold completed the purchase of the track for $71 
million from Hollywood Park, which bought it from Millie Vessels in 1983. 
Arnold managed harness races at Los Alamitos from 1979 to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Racing will be held on Tuesday through Saturday through April 21, starting 
nightly at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said the track has spent more than $400,000 on renovations, including 
600 new chairs and 100 televisions in the Turf Club. 
</P>
<P>
Part of Arnold's marketing strategy will be to improve the sport's public 
image, which has been damaged by allegations of race fixing. 
</P>
<P>
"Qualified drivers with past suspicions, but no proof of wrongdoing, will start 
the meeting with a clean slate," he said. "But all drivers have been put on 
notice that if something doesn't look right, they're gone immediately. We have 
$71 million invested and we don't want to be put out by a few bad apples."

MARYMOUNT HAS A NEW OFFENSE, 12 NEW PLAYERS AND MORE TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A powerful inside offense isn't the only new thing on the Marymount Palos 
Verdes basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners have 12 fresh faces and they'll have to do without last year's 
stars -- guards James Anderson and Ernie Woods -- who almost single-handedly 
carried the team as the state's third- and sixth-leading scorers. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jim Masterson isn't overly concerned, though. He says that although this 
team doesn't have stars, it's got more talent. For the fifth-year coach, that 
means improvement over last year's dismal 7-21 record (3-11 in the Southern 
California Athletic Conference). 
</P>
<P>
"We're better balanced," he said. "We're going to have a lot of people 
contributing this year." 
</P>
<P>
Like last season, the Mariners' three-guard offense will do a lot of fast 
breaking and apply pressure defensively. Three consistent inside scorers have 
shifted last year's strength from the outside to the inside. 
</P>
<P>
Center Warren Cox has been the most effective. The 6-foot-6, 205-pound freshman 
from the Bahamas averages 20 points and 11 rebounds in the Mariners' three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a beast," Masterson said. "He's one of the strongest players I've ever 
coached. He's fast, and he's an incredible leaper." 
</P>
<P>
Power forward Kevin Johnson (6-5, 235) is the team's second leading scorer with 
a 12.7 average. The freshman is battling with sophomore Kelly Black (6-6, 190), 
for that starting position. 
</P>
<P>
The three starting guards are freshman Lenny Kai (Kamehameha High School in 
Hawaii) and sophomores Bryon Flournoy and Brian Martin. Flournoy, the point 
guard, averaged 6.5 assists as a part-time starter last year. 
</P>
<P>
Martin and Kai have two strong competitors striving for their spots. Freshman 
Kerry Baker (R. M. Bailey High School in the Bahamas) is a solid contender for 
Martin's swing guard position and freshman Ron Dinnel (Rolling Hills High) for 
Kai's off-guard spot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really nice to have so many players working out," said Masterson, who has 
a roster of 14. "Even with injuries and the flu, we can still scrimmage. Last 
year, even when all showed up, we couldn't scrimmage." 
</P>
<P>
A coaches' poll voted Marymount fourth in the seven-member SCAC. L.A. City was 
first, Harbor second and Compton third.

LOYOLA CAGERS HOPING FOR ANOTHER VICTORY IN REMATCH WITH RENO; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: THE LIONS WANT TO GET ON THE WINNING TRACK AFTER LOSING A TOUGH 
SEASON OPENER TO UNLV. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If history repeats itself, basketball fans are in for an entertaining evening 
Saturday when Loyola Marymount opens its home season against Nevada Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola (0-1) got its most exciting victory of the season last year in Reno, 
beating the Wolf Pack, 130-125, and several of the stars of that game return 
for the rematch. 
</P>
<P>
On that night, Loyola's Hank Gathers tied the school scoring record, getting 49 
points while grabbing 26 rebounds, and five other Lions scored in double 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola lost to that other Nevada team, the Runnin' Rebels of Las Vegas, 102-91, 
in last week's Preseason National Invitation Tournament. The Lions, however, 
showed they're a competitive team by staying with the nationally top-ranked 
Rebels for most of the game on UNLV's court. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions figure to try to put more points on the board against Reno, whose 
defense does not compare to that of its prosperous relatives in Las Vegas. 
Loyola, which led the nation in scoring the last two seasons at better than 110 
points per game, and Reno, which averaged more than 90 points last season, also 
are among the nation's more generous teams. Reno allowed nearly 90 points per 
game last season while Loyola allowed more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
That may make traditional coaches wince, but it makes for entertaining games 
that test who can go all-out longest. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the answer turned out to be the Lions -- specifically Gathers, whose 
all-out effort did in the Wolf Pack. Virtually dominating the front line 
himself, Gathers hit 24 of 37 shots and had 13 rebounds at each end. If he had 
been able to hit a free throw in the closing seconds, he would have recorded 
the first 50-point game in Loyola history. 
</P>
<P>
Free throws remain a bugaboo for Gathers, who is shooting them right-handed 
again after trying left-handed in exhibition games. He was 0-for-3 against 
UNLV, but Coach Paul Westhead appeared unworried. "I think he'll turn it 
around," Westhead said. "He's trying to adjust and get a rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions hope to have fine-tuned their fast break a bit since last week. They 
also hope to get more minutes out of speedy point guard Tony alker, who fouled 
out against UNLV and saw action for only 17 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Kimble, Jeff Fryer and Per Stumer join Gathers and Walker in the starting 
lineup. Kimble and Fryer, the team's three-point shooters, combined for 44 
points against UNLV. The Lions also got a spark off the bench from swing man 
Tom Peabody and sophomore guard Terrell Lowery, who pumped in 15 points and 
five assists in 23 minutes last week. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead would still like to find a dependable big man off the bench. Sophomore 
forward John O'Connell played respectably as the first front line player off 
the bench, but backup center Chris Knight was ineffective and Marcellus Lee did 
not play. 
</P>
<P>
Reno opens with familiar faces, led by guard Kevin Franklin, a junior out of 
Taft High in Woodland Hills who gunned in 33 points against Loyola last year. 
The 6-foot-3 scorer averaged 17.7 points in last year's guard-oriented offense. 
Sophomore Kevin Soares joins him in the back court, where he averaged 5.6 
assists as a freshman. In two preseason games Franklin and Soares were the 
leading scorers. Senior Jon Baer, 6-foot-8, and junior Matt Williams start at 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
The big addition for Coach Len Stevens is 6-10 freshman center Ric Herrin, who 
Stevens feels will make a legitimate impact this season. "With the addition of 
Ric as the first true center this team has had in many years, it will free up a 
lot of perimeter shooting," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola leads the all-time series with Reno, 26-13, and has won 12 of the last 
14 meetings in Los Angeles. Reno competed in the West Coast Conference in the 
1970s but is now a member of the Big Sky Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The 7:30 game will be televised on SportsChannel-Los Angeles cable and will be 
preceded by the Loyola women's opener against Eastern Illinois at 5 p.m.

CARSON'S HARRIER STAR HAS ENERGY AND DESIRE TO BURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG GONZALEZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carson junior Steven Gonzales was so bushed after his third-place finish in the 
City Section cross-country finals Saturday afternoon that he decided to run a 
5,000-meter recreational race the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"I normally tell our kids to rest, but Steve is different," Coach Bill Mocnik 
said. "He just gets stronger as the year goes on." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales cruised to a 4:38 mile split in that 5K on Sunday but then eased off 
because it was just a workout. On Saturday, Gonzales will run in the state 
Division I cross-country championships in Fresno's Woodward Park. Mocnik thinks 
Gonzales can run in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales is one of several athletes from the South Bay who will run at the 
state meet. The Palos Verdes girls are going for their third consecutive state 
title and second Division I crown. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Israel Pose of Torrance will run in his first state meet after finishing 
fourth in the boys 4-A Division at Saturday's Southern Section championships 
with a time of 15:19 for three miles. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I can finish in the top 10," said Pose, a Spanish citizen with 
aspirations of running for Spain in the 1992 or '96 Olympic Games. "I'll try to 
stick with Bryan Dameworth and those guys and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth is a senior from Agoura who won last year's state Division I title in 
15:03 on the 5,000-meter course. Pose's all-time best for 5,000 is 15:36. A 
5,000-meter race is equal to 3.1 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura's girls will try to unseat Palos Verdes as the champions. "We've been 
running in the shadow of Agoura and Woodbridge all year," Palos Verdes Coach 
Joe Kelly said. "They've been ranked ahead of us in the state rankings, and now 
we'll see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Agoura won the 2-A Southern Section title with a total team time of 96:17 -- 44 
seconds faster than Palos Verdes but in a different race. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Maya Muneno and freshman Tami Wilcox led Palos Verdes on Saturday,

A group of boys from Redondo Beach Region 34 of the American Youth Soccer 
Organization will play a series of games with Mexican youth teams Saturday at 
Ensenada. 
</P>
<P>
The Gamblers, a co-ed slow-pitch softball team from Redondo Beach, failed to 
defend their 1988 title in the Mexicana Silver Cup, settling for the bronze 
medal in the A Division. The tournament was played in San Jose del Cabo, Baja 
California, and included 21 teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Gamblers, who opened the tournament with three straight wins, defeated 
Rocky Mountain of Alberta, Canada, 6-2, in the bronze medal game, avenging an 
11-5 loss in the medal round. The Wildthangs from Seattle, who defeated the 
Gamblers, 6-3, in the medal round, and the Midgets of California, a 7-6 
medal-round winner over the Gamblers, advanced to the gold-medal game. Seattle 
won, 15-3. The Gamblers' Jim Thome of Lawndale, John Hansen of Carson and Mona 
Welsh and Lorraine Hollweg of Redondo Beach were named to the tournament 
all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
According to coaches Hollweg and Jeffrey Babbitt, the Gamblers will probably 
skip the event next season but are considering playing in another international 
event, perhaps in Hawaii, in 1991. The team has declined an invitation from 
promoters to play in the European Cup next year in Holland.

Question: My husband works in Manhattan and is due for a new coat. He wants to 
buy a Chesterfield, and I feel that style is too dressy for a lawyer with a lot 
of conservative clients. Please comment. -- R.R.O. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Chesterfields are the comeback coat of the season in menswear. Perhaps 
your husband will find this advice from the coat's namesake, 19th-Century Earl 
of Chesterfield, as valid today as when it was written in 1840: "Take great 
care always to be dressed like the reasonable people of your own age; in the 
place where you are; whose dress is never spoken of one way or another as 
either too negligent or too much studied." 
</P>
<P>
The Chesterfield with its slight shaping and velvet collar is available in 
traditional gray and navy herringbones as well as such unexpected colors as 
taupe and olive.

Candice Bergen admits to being a notorious last-minute Christmas shopper. She 
does so in the opening pages of a new Spiegel catalogue where she also lists 
her 42 last-minute holiday gift ideas. Among her favorites are a silver-plated 
makeup set and a turquoise flannel shirt that reminds her of her Uncle Lou who 
lived in a cabin in the Adirondacks. The popular star of "Murphy Brown" isn't 
the first to speak for the company. Bianca Jagger and Jacqueline Bisset already 
have. But she is the first to guest-edit her own catalogue. "She's a great role 
model," explains Rob Logendyke of Spiegel, about the choice. Other changes at 
Spiegel include plans to carry clothing by several of New York's leading 
younger designers, including Marc Jacobs for Perry Ellis, Charlotte Neuville 
and Carmelo Pomodoro, all of who will be photographed by the famed Scavullo for 
their Spiegel portraits.

Jazz pianist Harry Connick Jr., whose rendition of "It Had to Be You" made him 
the musical sensation of "When Harry Met Sally," gave a concert at the Wiltern 
Theatre last weekend. And between tunes he admitted to having an incurable 
fashion disease -- "Armani-itis." Strutting across the stage in a gray wool 
suit by Italian designer Giorgio Armani, he added, "I'm broke, but I sure look 
good." The post-concert dinner celebration looked like a meeting of the 
similarly affected. Columbia Pictures President Dawn Steel wore an Armani 
single-button jacket and pants, actor D.B. -Sweeney wore a suit from the 
Italian designers Emporio line, and Armani-philes Billy Crystal,

'HITLER'S SHADOW' STILL OVER GERMANY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jonathan Kirsch, in his review of "In Hitler's Shadow: West German Historians 
and the Attempt to Escape From the Nazi Past," indicates that Germans should 
forever feel guilty for the sins of their forefathers (View, Nov. 8). 
</P>
<P>
There is, for most of us, no denying the German atrocities of the Second World 
War, but times do change: Germany is now a stable democracy, and most of her 
citizens took no part in aforementioned atrocities. Why should they feel guilty 
today, and why does Kirsch view so "ominously" the reunification of Germany, 
especially in view of recent happy events there? 
</P>
<P>
Give the Germans credit: Devastated and poverty-stricken after World War II, 
they picked themselves up and established a thriving market economy and a model 
democracy, which they have maintained for more than 40 years. As a supposedly 
objective reviewer, Kirsch should restrain his subjective and blatant 
anti-German feelings.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: WHEN A WIFE IS ADDICTED TO SEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My 40-year-old wife was always an exceptionally beautiful 
woman, but she was never sexually promiscuous until recently. Since I still 
love her, this pains me and causes me considerable embarrassment. She claims 
she's addicted to sex and that she can never get enough. Is this possible, and, 
if so, what does it mean? F.K. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR F.K.: Before I answer this question, I'd like to know if you've talked 
with your wife about what's happening in your marriage, if you've asked her why 
she feels there was this sudden change and if she has any theories on why she 
feels "addicted" now but never before? 
</P>
<P>
It's possible for people to be addicted to sex. Those who are use sex as an 
escape for their problems in much the same way other addicts reach for their 
"fix." There's little doubt that women who've been great beauties have an 
especially difficult time with the aging process. Unfortunately, remarkable 
beauties often fail to develop their potential because they get used to relying 
on their beauty even as small girls. If you have valued your wife primarily for 
her beauty, she may be concerned that you're losing interest as you witness her 
beauty fade. 
</P>
<P>
She may be using sexual conquests as a way to reassure herself that she's still 
attractive. If you want to salvage your marriage, get professional help. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My son-in-law is physically abusive to my daughter. She 
won't leave him because she feels she can get him to change if he stops 
drinking. Each time, after he hits her, he swears it won't happen again and 
each time he tells her he'll stop drinking. This last time, he bet his entire 
bank account that he won't touch another drop and that he'll never under any 
circumstances hit her. What do you think the chances are that he'll keep his 
promise? G.W. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR G.W.: Not good. This isn't to say that this man isn't capable of change, 
but unless he is highly motivated and gets the help he needs, there's little 
chance that he'll suddenly become the kind of man your daughter wants. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, his abuse of alcohol isn't necessarily linked to his abuse of 
your daughter. Alcoholics may sometimes blame spouse abuse on alcohol, but 
studies indicate that abstention alone doesn't solve the problem. If this man 
is an alcoholic, then he should become a part of the Alcoholic Anonymous 
program, go to meetings every evening and dedicate himself to living their 
doctrine one day at a time. This will undoubtedly help him gain control of his 
temper, but I suspect he also needs special therapy to teach him how to talk 
constructively about what upsets him and now to deal with his rage in a 
positive way, rather than simply striking out at a convenient target, usually 
someone or something weaker and smaller.

AUTOBIOGRAPHY READS LIKE A NOVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A House With Four Rooms by Rumer Godden (William Morrow: $18.95 Ill.; 319 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
"I am a storyteller," Godden tells us in the course of this altogether engaging 
autobiography, picking up the narrative in 1945, where the first volume, "A 
Time to Dance, A Time to Weep" stopped. The reminder is hardly necessary -- the 
second book is as elegantly structured, the characters as memorable, as if the 
memoir were actually a novel. Though the framework never shows, and friends and 
relations are introduced as casually as if we met them in one of Godden's 
several houses, still the storyteller's sensibility is plain, bringing order 
out of confusion, filling in gaps and tidying up stray threads. 
</P>
<P>
Candid and modest, these are the recollections of a courageous and determined 
woman in the process of becoming a remarkably versatile writer. In addition to 
more than a score of well-received novels, she has produced 8 volumes of 
nonfiction, 5 of poetry, and another 20 children's books, now considered 
classics of the genre. 
</P>
<P>
Born in England, Godden was taken to India almost at once, where she lived 
first as the daughter of a foreign service family stationed there and later as 
a young wife and mother of two small girls. When that marriage disintegrated, 
she returned to England with her daughters, expecting to live, at least 
temporarily, in a cottage on the property her parents had bought as a 
retirement house in Cornwall. Arriving with virtually nothing except the worn 
clothes on their backs, an Oriental silk rug, and the manuscript of her 
ambitious novel of Indian life, "The River," she had barely recovered from the 
grueling voyage when she realized that staying on at the cottage would be 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was it needed for the other Godden children and grandchildren, but it 
was far too remote from the literary life of London. Godden knew almost at once 
"the very contentment and protection would undo me." Afraid that she'd never 
"amount to anything" if she stayed on, she hastily established herself in the 
city, living in far less comfortable circumstances, but amounting to more than 
even she imagined when she stunned her parents by rejecting their selfless 
offer of hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
To her beloved sister and occasional collaborator Jon Godden, she wrote: "I 
have found a house in London, not I suppose a proper house, but I can pay for 
it." At that point, she had already written "A Fugue in Time," and "The River" 
had promptly found a publisher. Fortunately, the not-quite-proper house was so 
tiny that it needed virtually no furniture; all to the good because in 1945, 
hardly anything was available. Victims of the blitz had priority on the little 
that was being manufactured, while others in need could either hunt for 
antiques or make do with packing cases. Godden did both, and while the house 
was barely adequate, her time there was productive and satisfying. By 1946 she 
had met James Haynes-Dixon, the man she eventually married after a long and 
marvelously recounted courtship; a love story that not only fills the book with 
warmth and charm, but provides an inconspicuous but essential continuity to the 
various adventures that follow. 
</P>
<P>
Imaginative, strong and unfailingly dependable, Haynes-Dixon is a significant 
presence from his first appearance to his death 27 years later. Endearingly, he 
would wait until Godden had particularly admired or enjoyed something, then buy 
it, put it away, and present it at precisely the perfect moment. There are 
several such incidents here, each a romantic cameo in itself. 
</P>
<P>
Though her private life seems remarkably tranquil, professionally Godden lived 
in a state of almost perpetual motion, not only producing the amazing oeuvre in 
rapid succession, but traveling widely, moving frequently; never scanting 
parents, children, or her constantly widening circle of friends and admirers. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most absorbing episodes of the book is the account of her sojourn in 
India with Jean Renoir, working with the director on the film made from "The 
River." 
</P>
<P>
Later there's an entertaining and generous account of her extensive lecture 
tour in America, an experiment in which her delight was reciprocated by huge 
and appreciative audiences. She was, in fact, such a success that she could 
have gone on indefinitely, playing to packed houses from coast to coast, but 
"it's not writing," she said firmly, and returned to her desk, now in Scotland, 
to continue as a storyteller first and foremost.

'RUMMIES' DEFEATED BY ITS OWN GENRE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rummies by Peter Benchley (Random House: $18.95; 251 pages.) 
</P>
<P>
Bad habits can make good fiction, and Benchley's plunge into the deep of a 
residential treatment center for substance abusers is more satirical, less 
reverent, and far wittier than most. Unfortunately, the operative words are 
than most, because the drying-out novel has now become virtually a genre unto 
itself, like war, love, and coming-of-age, though unlike these classic themes, 
sobering up doesn't admit nearly so many individual variations. 
</P>
<P>
If the setting is an expensive establishment in the Western desert and one's 
fellow patients include a once-glamorous movie star, a major league ball player 
and a troubled young heiress to provide romantic interest, along with a few 
genuine wild cards, you've got a typical mix, as standard as the stereotypes 
that turn up in war novels. When the therapy itself is patterned on the 
familiar Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step program, with a lot of praying, 
confessing, and hugging, even the most skillful writer doesn't have much room 
to maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
Working within these strict constraints, Benchley does manage to stretch the 
convention by making one of the patients a 300-pound Mafioso on scholarship 
from the Mob; another a criminal sentenced to the Banner Clinic by the courts; 
adding a flamboyantly gay but noble lush, and balancing the mix with an 
otherwise ordinary fellow who arrives in a Bugs Bunny costume. 
</P>
<P>
The founder, Stone Banner, is a sanctimonious old fraud who opened the clinic 
after his brilliant career in horse opera was prematurely terminated by 
alcoholism. Saved from physical and financial ruin by the 12-step program, he 
started his own establishment, which has turned out to be a bonanza -- almost 
as lucrative as movies, but with fewer variables. The staff, as is usual in 
such places, are all recovering abusers, dedicated to the principles of tough 
love. While some are more effective than others, the differences tend to blur. 
</P>
<P>
The finest scenes come at the beginning, when the distinctly upper-class 
protagonist, Scott Preston, begins his day as a publisher in an acute alcoholic 
crisis. Like his fellow sufferers, he's been deceiving himself for years, 
interpreting his shakes and sweats as "a metabolic thing," diagnosing his 
horrendous hangovers as a mysterious virus, his serious mental lapses as mere 
oversights. Once in his office, after a harrowing commute to the city, he's 
abruptly confronted by his wife, his daughter, the president of his company and 
the representative of the Banner Clinic, assembled to conduct "an 
intervention," the encounter at which the alcoholic is forced to confront the 
fact and the evidence of his addiction. The session ends with Scott Preston 
being escorted to the plane that takes him to the clinic. On arrival, he's met 
at the gate by Chuck, the Banner's driver and general factotum, from whose 
implacable grip there's no possible escape. 
</P>
<P>
Aloof, hesitant and recalcitrant at first, appalled at the company, the rules, 
and the pervasive piety, Preston is made miserably aware that all differences 
of education and background vanish in the brotherhood of addiction. Alcoholism 
is the great leveler, and once his brain begins to clear, Preston realizes that 
he has more in common with these losers than with his Yale classmates, his 
exurbanite neighbors, or his professional colleagues. So far, the book closely 
follows the established pattern for such fiction, a wry and antic humor 
distinguishing "Rummies" from the more solemn competition in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Once the cure is under way, the novel veers away from concentration upon 
alcoholism and drug abuse to become a mystery-adventure story. The movie queen 
is found dead and the heiress disappears. Preston's fellow inmates, now welded 
into a tightly knit, if oddly constituted, task force, manage to trap the 
miscreants and expose the hypocrisy that has infected the clinic, corrupting a 
pure and worthy cause. By the end of the book, the guilty have been punished, 
the innocent saved, and the recovering addicts restored to constructive, 
careful lives in the outside world, one hopes permanently.

Biggest Box Office Wednesday: "Back to the Future Part II" broke box office 
records Wednesday grossing $7 million in its opening day for the biggest 
Wednesday in the history of the motion picture business. The Universal film, 
starring Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, opened in 1,866 theaters in the 
United States and Canada and broke the record for a Wednesday opening 
previously held by "Rocky IV." That film brought in $5.7 million on 
Thanksgiving eve in 1985. The previous all-time Wednesday high was held by 
"Batman," which made $6.6 million on its first Wednesday (the film opened on a 
Friday). "It should obviously be the biggest Thanksgiving in history," said 
Universal Pictures spokesman Alan Sutton. SHAUNA SNOW

'STORM FRONT' MOVING UP

Nobody expected Billy Joel's "Storm Front" to take the Billboard pop album 
chart by storm -- but it has. His album inched up a notch to No. 2 and should 
take over the top spot in the next week or two. Joel just might have matching 
No. 1's -- the top pop album and single. Right now he has matching No. 2's. His 
single, "We Didn't Start the Fire" is also No. 2 on the pop singles chart. 
Whitesnake's "Slip of the Tongue" is the hottest new album on the chart, 
jetting to No. 13 in just two weeks. Shades of the '60s -- two guitar heroes 
have albums in the Top 30: Joe Satriani's high-flying "Flying in a Blue Dream" 
(No. 23) and Eric Clapton's "Journeyman" (No. 30). 
</P>
<P>
* Phil Collins' "But Seriously" debuted at a relatively low No. 82 but look for 
it to take a flying leap into the Top 20 next week. His single, "Another Day in 
Paradise," is No. 6 on the pop chart and just might reach No. 1 in the next few 
weeks.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT / STAGE: OLD GLOBE COMMISSIONS LAST PLAY IN SOVIET TRILOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Maly Drama Theatre of Leningrad closed its production of "Brothers and 
Sisters" on Sunday at the Old Globe, saying "Goodby America" to a capacity 
audience that gave it a standing ovation. It won't be goodby for long. Ticket 
prices may have been slashed by 50% during the last week of performances, but 
the Old Globe gave the Maly Drama Theatre the kind of endorsement that counts 
-- a return engagement. 
</P>
<P>
The Old Globe commissioned an English translation, from the Maly's literary 
manager, Michael Stronin, of the final part of the "Brothers and Sisters" 
trilogy by Fyodor Abramov, called "The House." Like the first two parts of 
"Brothers and Sisters," a harrowing, poetic story about one family's struggle 
to survive on a post-World War II Stalinist farm, the show will be performed by 
the Maly in Russian at the Globe in 1990 or 1991 with an English translation to 
be piped in through headphones. 
</P>
<P>
"The House," which picks up the Pryaslin family's story 20 years later, may be 
presented with a second play, as yet to be determined, said Old Globe managing 
director Thomas Hall. The Old Globe also is planning to produce a national tour 
of the Maly's "Brother and Sisters." Four or five other theaters may 
participate, including the Stamford (Conn.) Center for the Performing Arts, 
which originally tried, unsuccessfully, to negotiate for performances of 
"Brothers and Sisters" on the Maly's recent trip to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Generally acknowledged as the artistic centerpiece of San Diego's Soviet arts 
festival, the critically acclaimed American premiere of "Brothers and Sisters" 
did not pull the sellout crowds that it did in other countries. According to a 
Times poll, it attracted only 2% of those surveyed in San Diego as opposed to 
17% for the Faberge eggs and 12% for the Georgian folk dancers. Still, although 
the final figures are not yet in, Hall said the show left the Old Globe in the 
black and, when coupled with the sellout performances by the Tblisi State 
Puppet Theatre, also hosted by the Globe, may even allow the theater to return 
$30,000 to $50,000 to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Hall attributed some of the initial problems with ticket sales to ticket 
prices, the show's length, and the unfamiliarity of the subject to local 
audiences. At $50 to $75 for a six-hour show presented at two sittings, 
"Brothers and Sisters" was the priciest festival ticket in town. "The House" 
will be about half the length and tickets will cost less. But more 
significantly, Hall said, it is a first step toward an Old Globe dream of 
presenting significant world theater annually. The Old Globe also is discussing 
a play it might produce in English (possibly with Russian piped in through 
headphones) at the Maly Drama Theatre. Hall said the Maly is interested in a 
play that is "uniquely American." 
</P>
<P>
"The impetus behind all this is artistic, not financial," said Hall. " 
'Brothers and Sisters' was a huge artistic success. Although we were slow out 
of the gate, it shows San Diego has an appetite for this kind of work. Everyone 
is wondering what the impact of the festival is. I think a major impact has 
been to expand the willingness of our audience to see new and different work. 
And the board, along with our staff, came away feeling that it was a unique 
experience for all of us, and the next time we host a company of this stature, 
it will be easier because we have a base audience." 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM NOTES: Des McAnuff, artistic director of the La Jolla Playhouse, is in 
New York directing and revising the book for "Chess," a since-closed Broadway 
musical being readied for a national tour that will begin in Florida and 
include the Orange County Performing Arts Center. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Repertory Theatre received its first grant earmarked for its 
4-year-old Teatro Sin Fronteras (Theater Without Boundaries) Latino theater 
project. It's a $35,000 challenge grant from the California Arts Council that 
needs to be matched three-to-one by Dec. 1, 1990. . . . 
</P>
<P>
When the Bowery Theatre mapped out its season last summer, doing a Christmas 
show seemed like a pretty good idea. But the surprising success of "What the 
Butler Saw," its second play that opened Sept. 15, has been an early Christmas 
present. So the theater has scrapped a Romulus Linney play and let the butler 
do it through Jan. 6. This will be the second and last extension of Joe Orton's 
delicious farce, however, as Bowery artistic director Ralph Elias, who is 
starring in "What the Butler Saw," needs to move in to directing duties for 
"Teibeleh and Her Demon" by Isaac Bashevis Singer opening Feb. 1. Erin Kelly, a 
Bowery veteran who has been in every Bowery show except "What the Butler Saw" 
since Elias took over the theater, will star in "Teibeleh." . . . San Diego 
comic Don Victor will perform his one-man show at the Waterfront Theatre in San 
Francisco on Monday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Puss in Boots," a dramatization of the classic fairy tale about a crafty cat, 
continues the Grossmont Theatre Arts Department's first season in the East 
County Performing Arts Center. The play will run Thursday through Dec. 2. The 
four-play season at ECPAC, which includes "Our Town" and "A Doll's House," ends 
May 26. . . . Laundry or thrift items for Auntie Helen's Fluff &amp; Fold, a 
community service organization that does laundry for persons with AIDS, will 
net you half-price tickets for the continuing world premiere of "Solid Oak" at 
the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre through Dec. 16. But call the box office first at 
234-9583. Tonight's performance of "Solid Oak" at the Gaslamp was canceled 
because of low ticket demand. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Videos of the works of San Diego playwright Philip Dimitri Galas, who died in 
1986 of AIDS, will be played in the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art's Video 
Porch throughout the day on Dec. 1. There is no admission charge for the 
presentation, which is part of the World Health Organization's second annual 
"AIDS Awareness Day," designed as a day of mourning for those who have died of 
AIDS. Also participating in the event will be the Museum of Modern Art and the 
Metropolitan Museum in New York, the Getty Museum and the Newport Harbor Art 
Museum in Southern California.

STAGE BEAT: 'PLACE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Randy was a kid, he wanted to be St. Francis. But Randy's brains have 
become a little fried. The party of the '60s and '70s is over. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I still wanted to be St. Francis," Randy says, in a throwaway line that 
exposes like an X-ray the malaise, the torpor, the stasis of a group of 
pot-smoking friends in their 30s who never made the transition from a drug 
culture to a 9-to-5 world. Randy's big dream now is to open a worm farm, sit 
back, smoke pot and enjoy life. 
</P>
<P>
Actor James Oseland as the quirky Randy in the striped tank shirt doesn't 
exactly steal Robert Hummer's new drama, "Place," at the Cast Theatre, but his 
jangly nerves illuminate this scenario of burnout cases. 
</P>
<P>
The production, developed in the Cast's Foundry workshop, answers the question 
of whatever happened to the zonked-out street people who carried their stash in 
cellophane bags. They didn't all become yuppies. Arrested development is what 
happened here. Randy and his four friends (Jon Slade, Noreen Hennessy, Tom 
Waldman and Molly Cleator) are still hanging out, and that's their problem. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Hummer, who also directed, subtly dramatizes characters who not only 
lead dreary, inarticulate lives but whose actions also give them the curious 
sensation of people swimming under water. 
</P>
<P>
The tone and style suggest a sensibility filtered through the minimalism of 
some of the work associated with John Steppling, the Heliogabalus and the Padua 
Hills Festival, sources with whom the cast members have worked. 
</P>
<P>
Short scenes, unfolding within a set of dark, speckled drapes that suggest a 
motley circus tent, propel the human discord. 
</P>
<P>
 At 804 N. El Centro Ave., Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 8 p.m., through Dec. 20. 
Tickets: $10. (213) 462-0265. 
</P>
<P>
'Unstable Conditions' 
</P>
<P>
Plays from Iceland are rare enough, and a house full of Icelandic-speaking 
opening-nighters cast a particular ambiance to the world premiere of "Unstable 
Conditions" at the Burbage Theatre Ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
But the two one-acts by visiting Icelandic playwright Sveinbjorn Baldvinsson 
have little to do with life in Iceland. The works are universal in their poetic 
intent on the one hand ("The Stars of Caesar") and responsibility for wartime 
atrocities on the other ("Visiting Hour"). 
</P>
<P>
The productions, under Paige Newmark's crisp direction, feature strong dual 
acting credits by Panos Christi. He's an old man in a mystical friendship with 
a little boy (a tenderly believable Joe Elrady) in "Stars of Caesar" and a 
wheelchair-bound, post-Vietnam explosives genius who gets the shock of his life 
in "Visiting Hour." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Herron limns well-etched roles as a mother and a nurse in the 
respective plays. And David Mack menacingly vivifies a Vietnam-scarred veteran 
in the brittle atrocity-themed "Visiting Hour." 
</P>
<P>
The disparity between the two works gives the evening a jagged edge, but the 
expressive Christi smooths the surfaces with chameleon grace. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10508 W. Pico Blvd., Mondays through Wednesdays, 8 p.m., through Dec. 20. 
Tickets: $5. (213) 839-3322. 
</P>
<P>
'The Head' 
</P>
<P>
Weird science buffs may want to check out "The Head," a late-night horror at 
the Attic Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The comic book brew has the stirrings of a poor man's "Rocky Horror Show" until 
the show runs out of imagination. That's when a ring of thugs invade the play's 
grim laboratory. For a while, though, the byplay between Tim Barber's 
disembodied head and his lover is risible stuff. The head's lover and 
maintenance man is a proper doctor wonderfully played by Neil Zevnick's 
strait-laced scientist. 
</P>
<P>
Barber's earnest dome gleams from atop a black cabinet in the center of the 
stage. It's a great head, strongly animated and vocally rich. But William S. 
Leavengood's plot disposes of the doctor-lover too soon, depriving the play of 
a riotous relationship, and devotes too much time to the gang of goons, 
featuring a Neanderthal-like Louie Bonanno. 
</P>
<P>
Jannette Rovack's lighting and Caro Walker's malevolent set are apt touches. 
Lauren Tewes directed. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6562 Santa Monica Blvd., Fridays and Saturdays, 10:30 p.m., through Dec. 9. 
Tickets: $10. (213) 462-9720. 
</P>
<P>
'Fool's Mate' 
</P>
<P>
Boyd Holister's one-man show about an actor backstage preparing to do a solo 
turn as Clark Gable is a moderately engaging diversion until you realize that 
the actor, not Gable, is the point of the show. 
</P>
<P>
Holister, who wrote the piece, might as well be preparing to do Sonny Tufts for 
all you learn about Gable. OK, Carole Lombard's plane crash is poignant, but 
what else is new? While Holister is the subject here, you'd like to see 
Holister doing more Gable. He has the King's chunky build and voice, and he 
dons a mean mustache and Rhett Butler finery. But "Fool's Mate" at the West End 
Playhouse lacks trajectory. 
</P>
<P>
The focus rambles. The actor's monologue about his days as a door-to-door 
salesman and his musings about holding an audience and capturing the actor's 
truths might buttonhole you if these were Gable's words. But, frankly, he 
wouldn't give a damn. Meanwhile, vanity theater lives. 
</P>
<P>
 At 18034 Ventura Blvd., today through Sunday, 8 p.m., concludes Sunday. 
Tickets: $15. (818) 594-1089.

'Bed' and 'Horse of a Different Color' 
</P>
<P>
Theatre of N.O.T.E. has moved into a new home (the former Fifth Estate Theatre) 
with a pair of one-acts that dramatize family Angst. The acting and production 
values signal a healthy sense of search for the membership-based ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
The freshest, most keenly felt work is Karen Spritzler's fablelike "Bed" (as in 
bed of nails). An aging couple (nicely acted by a yearning William Jackson and 
a chattering Myrna Niles) find mellow reconciliation after the husband's 
sensual encounter with the apparition of beauty (Taylor Donland). Judith 
Binder's slow-motion direction is excessively still, but the work's lyrical 
pulse is evident. 
</P>
<P>
The other play, Christi Taylor-Jones' "Horse of a Different Color," is a 
derivative parody of the monstrous nuclear family-genre. What distinguishes the 
show is the symbolic and all milk-white set and costumes. 
</P>
<P>
The inane mommy and daddy (Patricia Conklin and W. Vernon Newman) gorge and 
forge war over dinner with a rebellious, sensitive daughter (Dyanne DiRosario) 
as a callow younger brother (D.C. Douglas) slurps on. Expendable is a TV 
newscaster positioned above the action; the device is poorly staged and 
cliche-ridden. Gregory Cook directed. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1705 N. Kenmore Ave., Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, 8 p.m., through Dec. 
14. Tickets: $12.50. (213) 666-5550.

A VERSION OF OLD MEXICO IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Odd. This isn't the front door. It's a door, and it's on the front, but it 
doesn't open. It's a false door, apparently required by some Pasadena 
historical-appearances law. 
</P>
<P>
Let's not leap to a metaphor. Let's just go in by way of the non-historical 
side door. We've got to know what's going on here, because Catavinos Cafe, a 
pleasantly austere little place ornamented with Southwestern genre paintings, 
is jumping with Pasadenans. 
</P>
<P>
The word catavino means wine connoisseur or perhaps wine scrutinizer, and the 
wine list is definitely a cut above the usual thing at a Mexican restaurant. 
Perhaps the food is conceived to be eaten with wine. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe. Remembering to avoid that false-door metaphor, we can certainly see that 
it's an odd menu. On one hand, that nearly extinct L.A. tradition, albondigas 
soup (meatballs in cumin-flavored broth), an OK ceviche, a puzzling dish of 
peppers sauteed with cheese, and some simple tacos. 
</P>
<P>
But then there are mini-chimichangas that seem to be egg rolls stuffed with 
turkey. And a chicken salad with tortilla strips, suggestively named Keiko 
salad, has an Oriental sesame oil dressing. The shrimp cocktail is simply 
shrimp in salsa cruda, and one of our friends is rudely suggesting he could 
walk down to Trader Joe's and put together the same thing out of cans. 
</P>
<P>
There are also the oddest sort of pancakes. First, the crab and corn cakes 
taste like ordinary pancakes, with scarcely a hint of crab flavor, and they 
come with a sweet orange sauce. Then there are actual pancakes, tiny pancakes 
with a black bean filling and the same orange sauce. That's right: pancakes, 
black beans, orange sauce. The idea that this might be Mexican food for wine 
lovers is starting to sound unconvincing. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the entrees are like good Mexican home cooking. On a combination plate 
you can get tamales with a generous filling of well-browned pork, or a chile 
relleno that, for once, seems to have been fried to order rather than sitting 
around since early evening. It's a medium-hot chile and the cheese filling is 
more flavorful than most. 
</P>
<P>
And if the carnitas are not a large portion, they are the real thing, tender 
browned chunks of pork. The misleadingly named corn ravioli, on the other hand, 
are actually turnovers made of corn meal and filled with chicken, but a bit of 
black-bean sauce makes them perfectly enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
The best thing on the menu, to me, is the calamari steak, basically calamari 
treated like scampi, floured and fried and served with a strong garlic and 
lemon flavoring. The worst, by far, is the steak picado, tough chunks of stewed 
steak with tomatoes and onions. 
</P>
<P>
After this, there are some simple dishes like fish tacos and perhaps a special 
of sauteed sea bass with garlic, chopped raw tomatoes and cilantro. A slightly 
mushy roast chicken has a good flavor, but for some reason more of that orange 
sauce. Maybe Pasadena has gone orange-goofy. 
</P>
<P>
The desserts are to Pasadena's sweet tooth. A key lime cheesecake, a standard 
walnut pie, a fruit chimichanga, meaning a flaky roll of fried pastry filled 
with banana. And then a dessert from Mars, a lime-pistachio sorbet: lime ice, 
that is, streaked with chopped pistachio. I actually liked it. 
</P>
<P>
This is one of the oddest Mexican restaurants I've ever eaten in. Pasadena 
loves it, though, as I suppose it loves that absurd front door. Uh-oh, I went 
for the metaphor after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Catavinos Cafe, 119 W. Green St., Pasadena. (818) 578-1764. Open for breakfast 
Monday through Friday, for lunch and dinner seven days. Full bar. Street 
parking. American Express, MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food 
only, $23-$44.

AN UNEVEN 'EVENING WITH ALAN JAY LERNER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A first-class television revival of an Alan Jay Lerner show would be preferable 
to 10 star-studded black-tie collections of excerpts from his shows. 
Nevertheless, "An Evening With Alan Jay Lerner" (at 9 tonight on Channels 28, 
15 and 24) has a few moments to remember. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolf Nureyev, of all people, teaches correct English diction in "The Rain in 
Spain" (and dances more gracefully than most Henry Higginses). A formally 
dressed Leonard Bernstein, of all people, plays the part of a teen-aged black 
servant in an excerpt from the Bernstein/Lerner flop, "1600 Pennsylvania 
Avenue." 
</P>
<P>
Jane Powell and Lee Roy Reams remind us that Lerner, always billed as a great 
romantic, also asked the musical question, "How Could You Believe Me When I 
Said I Loved You, When You Know I've Been a Liar All My Life?" (for the 1951 
film "Royal Wedding," also starring Powell with Fred Astaire). 
</P>
<P>
John Cullum sings "On a Clear Day You Can See Forever," which in 1989 sounds 
like the perfect precis of '80s New Age philosophy. Robert Goulet recalls 
Lerner's observation that his partner Frederick Loewe's elevator shoes were "so 
high that when he took them off, his ears popped." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the evening consists of solos, sung straightforwardly but well. Sally 
Ann Howes and Julie Andrews are in particularly fine form, but Len Cariou 
sounds a bit hoarse. The one big group number is a brief rendition of the 
ever-witty "Ascot Gavotte." 
</P>
<P>
Video director Kirk Browning erred only in a clunky shooting of the trio 
(Cariou, Cullum and Hal Linden) that sings "One More Walk Around the Garden" 
from "Carmelina." But then how often do we get to hear anything from 
"Carmelina," an unsuccessful 1979 show? 
</P>
<P>
Of more interest is the second number from the same show, Georgia Brown singing 
"Why Him," followed by a grandiose announcement of "Miss Brown's escort, Sting" 
(they're in "Threepenny Opera" together). Sting then does nothing but enter to 
applause and usher Brown off the stage. It's an irrelevant bit of grandstanding 
in an evening that's supposed to belong to Lerner. 
</P>
<P>
The show was taped Oct. 23 at Lincoln Center. DON SHIRLEY

NIGHTCLUB SURVIVES YEAR -- BARELY -- WITHOUT ALCOHOL OR DANCING; 
</P>
<P>
NIGHT LIFE: THE COUNTRY CLUB'S WAITING PERIOD TO REAPPLY FOR ITS LOS ANGELES 
CITY ALCOHOL AND DANCING PERMITS EXPIRED LAST SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WYMA, Wyma is a regular contributor to Valley Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A disappointed Rita Lynn surveyed the crowd at the Country Club in Reseda last 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"This place used to rage," she said. "It was great. The best." 
</P>
<P>
About 300 people were there, sitting at tables and standing at the stage apron 
while the pop metal group Brunette pounded away. For nearly any San Fernando 
Valley venue, this would be a big turnout. But in the 982-seat Country Club, 
the crowd looked paltry. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be our favorite club," said Lynn, 23, of Thousand Oaks. "Now with 
no alcohol, we don't come here as much." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as good," agreed her friend, Jennifer Bucsis, 22, also of Thousand 
Oaks. "You want to party while you're spending your evening out." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago the Country Club lost its Los Angeles city permits to serve alcohol 
and allow dancing. A group of residents had complained that rowdy club patrons 
created disturbances in the neighborhood. When the permits came up for review, 
City Councilwoman Joy Picus, who represents the area, opposed an extension. 
</P>
<P>
The club's owners and its general manager, Scott Hurowitz, argued that they 
were being held accountable for a raucous period between 1980 and 1982, when 
Tom Petty, Jackson Browne, U2, Tina Turner and other stars performed there. At 
that time the Country Club was managed by Wolf and Rissmiller Concerts and 
security was inadequate, Hurowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
But the council sided with Picus, and the 9-year-old club lost its permits. 
Booking agents stopped bringing in groups such as Warrant -- acts with record 
contracts and wide appeal among lovers of so-called pop metal or melodic hard 
rock. The same was true of country and Western promoters. Ethnic community 
groups -- Israelis and Iranians among them -- stopped renting the club for 
dance parties. 
</P>
<P>
The cavernous hall that had rocked with frequent sellout crowds began to limp. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're in operation less often," said Picus, who often drives by the 
club on Sherman Way. "I don't look at their marquee every time, but it was 
about five nights a week and now it's three or less." 
</P>
<P>
Hurowitz said the club, which hopes to get its city permits again, indeed has 
dropped from five nights of operation to about three. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody from those who fought us in the first place to our supporters 
throughout the music community really thought there was no way this could work 
without liquor," Hurowitz said. "It's working in the sense that . . . we've 
shown you can do shows without liquor and a promoter can make a buck. But 
keeping the doors open does not mean profit." 
</P>
<P>
He said the club has had a few big-name acts in the past year -- Debbie Harry, 
the Replacements and the Ramones among them. But most weekend nights have been 
given over to unsigned groups that have loyal but small followings. 
</P>
<P>
"I come to hear the bands," said Christy Mead, 19, while ordering a Coke 
Saturday night. She had driven from Buena Park to see the Orange County metal 
group Razzle, which, with Zeus, was opening for the featured act, Brunette. 
</P>
<P>
Hurowitz said that increased bookings of punk groups, which draw younger 
patrons, have helped the club survive. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids can look pretty rough with their skinheads and mohawks," he said, 
"but they're just kids. They come in and have a good time and say, 'Goodby, 
thanks for having us.' " 
</P>
<P>
Picus backed up Hurowitz's claim that the punk crowds -- and all the other 
Country Club audiences in the past year, for that matter -- have been 
well-behaved. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had no complaints in that area," Picus said. "Operating without booze 
has made a world of difference." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the clean report card may not work to the club's advantage. In its 
vote last November, the City Council said the club could reapply for its 
alcohol and dance permits after one year. The waiting period ended last Sunday. 
Hurowitz and club owners said they are certain to reapply, although they do not 
know when. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to," said part-owner Elaine Landis, widow of the club's founder, Chuck 
Landis. "We're just barely making it." 
</P>
<P>
But Picus said she will not support the club's application because the 
incident-free past year proves that alcohol was a problem. She has noted that 
there were 65 arrests near the hall during its operating hours in the previous 
two-year period. Country club officials say the number is misleading in that 
many of the arrests came because club security officers called police, 
forestalling problems. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Landis said the club's four owners have talked of selling the facility 
but are awaiting the outcome of the permit application before making a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to make up our minds now what to do," she said. "We think one way 
one time and the other way the other time." 
</P>
<P>
She said she doubts that the club will continue to operate if the alcohol and 
dance permits are not reissued. 
</P>
<P>
Loss of the permits has driven away much of the adult crowd. "People over 21 
will just wait to see the groups somewhere else," Hurowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Zilijan, 26, of Canoga Park said he no longer is a frequent customer. 
</P>
<P>
"I came tonight because my friends are in Zeus and they're playing," he said. 
"But the place isn't packed like it used to be. This place used to be 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
"I know lots of girls who won't come here because it's boring," said Jimmy 
Marchiano, 25, of Hollywood. "If the girls stop coming, then the guys stop." 
</P>
<P>
But loss of the permits has been a boon to some minors. 
</P>
<P>
Carrie Clark and Summer Gaudreault, both 15 and from Chatsworth, said that they 
visit the Country Club often and that their parents might not let them if 
alcohol was served. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of teen-agers like to listen to metal, and they don't have a place 
except here," Carrie said. 
</P>
<P>
Summer said it doesn't matter to her that patrons cannot dance. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we can stand close to the stage and be by the groups, it's OK," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hurowitz, who vowed last year to do everything possible to keep the club open, 
said he will continue to find revenue sources. He has had some success renting 
the hall to record companies that are showcasing bands or making music videos. 
The Beastie Boys and Skid Row have staged concerts taped for videos. 
</P>
<P>
Hurowitz has rented the space as a nightclub set in television commercials. He 
has held onto client Ten Goose Boxing, which presents matches there, and 
occasionally rents the hall as a set in boxing movies. 
</P>
<P>
"The Country Club has had its less prestigious times before," he said. "This is 
a business with lean times. Every show can't be Prince." 
</P>
<P>
Although there are occasional sellouts, there are nights when as few as 150 
customers turn out. 
</P>
<P>
"Put 150 in the Whiskey and it looks half-full," Hurowitz said. "But put 150 in 
here and it looks like my cleaning crew." 
</P>

MY BEST RECIPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A few years ago, my husband and I attended a pre-wedding dinner in Berkeley," 
Shoshana K. Socher writes. "The food was mainly Moroccan and included a 
wonderful couscous salad. I've spent quite a bit of time remembering, 
recreating and retasting this light salad. Now that I've got it, I serve it as 
part of a buffet or as a main dish with crusty bread and light beverage." 
</P>
<P>
COUSCOUS SALAD 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups bulgur or couscous 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 cups boiling water 
</P>
<P>
1 cup diced peeled carrots 
</P>
<P>
1 green or red sweet pepper, diced 
</P>
<P>
1 cup frozen peas 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup chopped red or green onions 
</P>
<P>
2/3 cup currants 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup slivered almonds, toasted 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup oil 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons orange juice 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Place bulgur in large bowl and pour boiling water over it. Cover and let sit 10 
minutes or so. Fluff with fork to separate grains. 
</P>
<P>
Stir in carrots, sweet pepper, peas, onions, currants and almonds. Whisk 
together oil, lemon juice, cinnamon, orange juice and parsley. Pour over 
couscous and vegetables and mix well. Season to taste with salt. Chill 
overnight or at least 1 hour. Makes 6 to 8 servings.

COOK IT LIGHT: LESS BEEF MEANS LOWER-FAT MEAT PIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR JEANNE: Any way to modify this recipe to make it lower in fat? Perhaps the 
crust? It's an easy-to-make, very tasty pie I've been making for years. The 
only thing I would do is change the ground beef to half sirloin and half ground 
turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 -- BONNIE, Palm Harbor, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
ITALIAN MEAT PIE 
</P>
<P>
1 pound lean ground beef 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup chopped green pepper 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup water 
</P>
<P>
1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste 
</P>
<P>
1 (1 1/2-ounce) package spaghetti sauce mix 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
1 frozen deep-dish pie-crust shell 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese 
</P>
<P>
Brown beef in large skillet. Drain. Add green pepper and cook 2 minutes. Stir 
in water, tomato paste and spaghetti sauce mix. Cover and simmer 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkle 1/2 Parmesan cheese over bottom of frozen pie shell. Spread 1/2 meat 
mixture in pie shell. Sprinkle 1 cup mozzarella cheese over meat. Layer 
remaining meat and Parmesan cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Place pie on baking sheet and bake at 400 degrees 15 minutes. Sprinkle top with 
remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese. Return to oven until cheese melts, about 5 
minutes. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Pie freezes and reheats well. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR BONNIE: There is always a big trade-off when taking advantage of packaged 
and processed foods for convenience. In this case, though your pie is indeed 
easy and delicious, it is loaded with undesirables that can be greatly reduced 
or eliminated completely by using more basic ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest change you can make in this recipe is to serve smaller portions. I 
think it can easily serve six people, especially if you serve it with a fresh 
green salad and crusty garlic bread. Also, by reducing the amount of meat and 
increasing the vegetables, you can make a healthier finished product without 
substantial change in taste, texture or appearance. 
</P>
<P>
I haven't omitted the pie-crust shell in your recipe. However, to really 
lighten this meat pie I would suggest you make your own crust -- ahead of time 
and freeze it, if necessary -- so you can control the ingredients it contains. 
Prepared crusts often list lard as the first ingredient; and since lard is 
animal fat, it is highly saturated and contains cholesterol as well. 
</P>

BACK TO BASICS: PRESS, PUNCH AND PULL: HOW TO PREPARE YEAST BREAD DOUGH FOR 
SHAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In past columns we've discussed how to mix and knead the dough for yeast bread. 
After being prepared, the dough is covered and left in a warm, draft-free place 
until it doubles in volume. 
</P>
<P>
During this proofing, or fermentation period, the yeast cells feed on sugar and 
produce carbon dioxide. It's this gas that lightens the dough and makes it 
expand. 
</P>
<P>
The dough should not, however, be allowed to more than double or it may 
collapse back into the bowl. Bread baked from dough that is overproofed has a 
tendency to be coarse and dry. 
</P>
<P>
To check whether it is ready for shaping, lightly press a finger one-half inch 
down into the dough. If the indentation remains when the finger is removed 
(Step 1), the dough has doubled and is ready for the next step. 
</P>
<P>
Punch down the dough by making a fist and pushing it into the center of the 
dough (Step 2). This allows the gas to escape. 
</P>
<P>
Pull the edges of the dough to the center (Step 3) and turn the dough over. A 
future column will be devoted to shaping the dough into loaves.

CULINARY SOS: RAPSCALLION OIL-FREE SALAD DRESSING STYLED AFTER PRITIKIN DIETARY 
IDEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR SOS: The Rapscallion Seafood House and Bar in Irwindale serves a delicious 
oil-free salad dressing they call Pritikin dressing. I have looked in the 
Pritikin recipe books but can't find it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARLENE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MARLENE: The dressing is the creation of executive chef Chris Logan at 
Rapscallion. "This is my understanding of what a Pritikin dressing should be -- 
something made with no oils, fats or sugars," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
RAPSCALLION'S NO-OIL DRESSING 
</P>
<P>
1 sweet red pepper, cut up 
</P>
<P>
1 green pepper, cut up 
</P>
<P>
2 medium tomatoes, cut up 
</P>
<P>
1 bunch fresh basil 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
2/3 cup pineapple juice 
</P>
<P>
1/4 bunch Italian parsley 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup raspberry vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
Dash dried thyme 
</P>
<P>
Dash dried tarragon 
</P>
<P>
Dash dried oregano 
</P>
<P>
Dash white pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup Worcestershire sauce 
</P>
<P>
Combine red and green peppers, tomatoes, basil, garlic, pineapple juice, 
parsley, vinegar, mustard, thyme, tarragon, oregano, pepper and Worcestershire 
in blender container. Blend until pureed. 
</P>
<P>
Refrigerate in air-tight container. Makes 4 cups. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: Some two or three years ago The Times published an excellent recipe 
for salmon broccoli casserole using celery soup. I've lost the recipe and need 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 -- DIXON 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DIXON: Well, you're out of luck with the recipe described, but I located 
something similar using chicken in Mel Baldwin's "Down Home in L.A. Cookbook," 
a rather droll and amusing cookbook that can be purchased for $14.95 plus $1.50 
postage by mail from Mel Baldwin, 1626 N. Wilcox Ave., Hollywood, Calif. 90028. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin is host of a radio food show. The recipe, says Baldwin, came from 
Clifton's Cafeteria, where the food is "down home" in flavor and style. Like 
Baldwin himself. 
</P>
<P>
CLIFTON'S CHICKEN BROCCOLI CASSEROLE 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: With the holidays so close, could you print a recipe for Cranberry 
Bread Stuffing that can be baked in a casserole? 
</P>
<P>
 -- YEONNA 
</P>
<P>
DEAR YEONNA: Certainly. You can stuff an eight- to 10-pound bird with the

HINTS FROM HELOISE: LEARN TO STOCK THE KITCHEN FOR POWER OUTAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Every year when winter is fast approaching, I stock up on certain 
non-perishable food items I know will withstand power outages during storms. 
</P>
<P>
All of these foods can be prepared quickly, with only a few needing water 
added. My list includes canned fish, corned beef, chicken, vegetables, fruits, 
milk, prepared chili and soups; also non-refrigerated cheese spreads, peanut 
butter, dry and instant cereals, crackers, dried fruit, tomato juice, dry 
powdered milk, bottled water, instant tea and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
With these foods in my pantry and my propane camping stove (in case of power 
outage), I feel I am prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 -- J. S., Minot, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: After grocery shopping, I unwrap the fresh meats and re-wrap them 
in freezer paper. I then cut the label off the original packaging and tape it 
to the newly wrapped package. The label contains all the information needed 
such as the type of meat, date of purchase and weight. No more guessing at how 
much meat there is in a package. 
</P>
<P>
 -- CHARLOTTE, Winston-Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: The other day I was in the middle of mixing cake batter when I 
discovered I had only one egg and the recipe called for two. After checking my 
cookbook substitutions, I found that I could add two tablespoons of mayonnaise 
to the cake batter as a substitute for the missing egg. 
</P>
<P>
The cake turned out great and my husband said he could not taste any 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARY, Canton, Ohio 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I use oil and grease for frying, and to tell if the oil is hot 
enough I just drop a kernel of popcorn in it. If the popcorn pops, then I know 
that the oil is hot enough and I can commence frying the food I desire. 
</P>
<P>
 -- FREDERICK, Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: The other morning after pouring myself a cup of coffee I realized 
I didn't have any cream. I started searching the cabinets for a substitute and 
found a can of condensed milk that I thought I would give a try. I added a 
spoonful and it was delicious. It was both cream and sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A READER, Columbus, Ohio 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: When I tear out items from magazines I would never get around to 
reading them. Many times I misplaced them or finally threw them away. 
</P>
<P>
Now whenever I tear out a diet or food tip I put it on the front of the 
refrigerator. If I tear out a makeup or bathing tip I tape it to the inside of 
my medicine cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARTHA, Bulverde, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have four children and they are constantly in the refrigerator 
for a needed item and it wouldn't be there because one of them had eaten it. 
</P>
<P>
To alleviate this nuisance, I went to a discount store and bought some little 
stickers in green and red. Now when I place an item in the refrigerator, I 
place a sticker on it--red means do not eat and green means it's OK to eat. 
This solved my problem.

A NORWEGIAN CHEF SHOWS A LIGHT AND NATURAL TOUCH IN CREATING DISHES; 
</P>
<P>
CUISINE: ARNE BRIMI PREPARES A SPECIAL BUFFET IN LOS ANGELES TO HELP INTRODUCE 
THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE EDITION OF HIS COOKBOOK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Logs blazed in the fireplace, guests sipped straight shots of aquavit, and the 
buffet table was laden with Norwegian salmon, roast venison and other dishes 
prepared by one of Norway's leading young chefs, Arne Brimi. 
</P>
<P>
The location, however, was not Norway but Los Angeles -- the Hancock Park home 
of Norwegian Consul General Per A. Tollefsen. Brimi, 32, was there to talk 
about his simple, natural approach to Norwegian cuisine and to introduce the 
English-language edition of his cookbook, "A Taste of Norway." 
</P>
<P>
"My philosophy is to keep the natural flavor. I try to show people that 
everyone can do this," he said. Devoted to the outdoor life, hunting and 
fishing, Brimi cooks at the Fossheim Turisthotell in Lom, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
Like contemporary American chefs, Brimi emphasizes fresh, local ingredients and 
is developing new interpretations of Norwegian cuisine while preserving old 
ways of cooking. He has done this with such success that in 1985 he was named 
Norway's chef of the year. Two years before, he was chosen game chef of the 
year. In 1987 Brimi took part in the World Championship of Chefs in Lyon, 
France. And in 1988 he was a member of the Norwegian team that won a bronze 
medal at the International Culinary Olympics in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
For the Los Angeles buffet, Brimi prepared two versions of marinated raw salmon 
(gravad lax), one flavored with dill and the other with juniper berries. He 
also set out two styles of salmon mousse and sliced smoked salmon accompanied 
by a platter of chive-topped scrambled eggs. Crisp pea pods accompanied a hot 
dish of salmon in a light sauce based on salmon juices. 
</P>
<P>
At the Fossheim Hotel, Brimi has a cure house where he hangs hams and sausages, 
including venison pepperoni. Brimi brought some of the pepperoni to Los Angeles 
and served it thinly sliced with a sauce of sweetened lingonberries and 
aquavit. Pears stuffed with lingonberries garnished a platter of cold roast 
venison, and a sauce of lingonberries and creme fraiche went with cold venison 
that had been marinated with juniper, thyme, mint, red wine and red wine 
vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
Following his light and natural theme, Brimi served two fruit desserts -- pears 
cooked with lingonberries and a bowlful of raspberries and strawberries topped 
with caramel sauce. Both would be ideal for rich holiday dinners. 
</P>
<P>
In Norway, a typical Christmas menu includes roast pork ribs -- not spareribs 
but pork bacon with the ribs and rind attached. Dessert could be cloudberries 
folded into sweetened whipped cream, Brimi said. 
</P>
<P>
The following recipes for holiday desserts include the caramel sauce for fruit 
that Brimi prepared in Los Angeles. The other recipes appear in his cookbook, 
which has a section devoted to Christmas foods. 
</P>
<P>
"A Taste of Norway" was initially published in Norway two years ago by the 
Norwegian University Press. The English translation can be ordered from the 
American distributor, Pennfield Press, 215 Brown St., Iowa City, Iowa 
52245-1358. Send checks or money orders for $22, which includes postage and 
handling. For more information, call (319) 337-9998. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Sugar 
</P>
<P>
8 pears, peeled but with stem attached 
</P>
<P>

minutes, until slightly thickened. Cool. Arrange fruit in serving bowl. Spoon 
over sauce just before serving. Makes 1 1/2 cups sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Note: As variation, substitute 1/2 cup Port wine for 1/2 cup whipping cream. 
</P>
<P>
CLOUDBERRY CREAM 
</P>
<P>
1 2/3 cups whipping cream 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Beat egg whites with sugar and vanilla until stiff. Fold in berries. Makes 8 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Although many recipes call for uncooked eggs, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture has found them to be a potential carrier of food-borne illness and 
recommends that diners avoid eating raw eggs. 
</P>
<P>

FOOD LABELS ARE TOO CONFUSING.

More than half of American shoppers have trouble understanding the ingredient 
and nutrition information on food labels, according to a survey conducted for 
the National Food Processors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, released by the nation's largest association of food manufacturers, 
found that 11% of the country's primary food shoppers believe labels are either 
"not too" or "not at all" understandable, while 40% believe labels are 
"somewhat" understandable. 
</P>
<P>
Information about preservatives and saturated fat was the most difficult to 
understand, according to respondents. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-seven percent of those who participated in the survey said that the 
information on food labels is "very understandable." Two percent didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
Viewing the approximate 50-50 split on the positive side, NFPA concluded that 
shoppers are not seriously confused about information on food packages. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Graham, executive vice president of NFPA, said the results indicate that 
we "don't need wholesale reform of the food label," but rather that it needs to 
be "fine tuned." 
</P>
<P>
The survey results come during an ongoing debate about revamping the food 
label, a discussion that has thus far taken place in Congress, the Food and 
Drug Administration and in the offices of food companies and consumer groups. 
Graham said that a crucial piece of data has been missing, namely a 
comprehensive survey of what the public thinks and wants. 
</P>
<P>
An NFPA committee of food-company marketing and consumer-affairs executives 
devised the survey with Opinion Research Corp., a market-research firm in 
Princeton, N.J. The questionnaire surveyed 1,000 consumers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Luther McKinney, senior vice president for law and corporate affairs at the 
Quaker Oats Co. and head of the committee responsible for the study, said that 
it "does confirm that there's less confusion" but added that "it depends on how 
you define confusion." 
</P>
<P>
There's "still quite a need for reform. We're dealing with a different day and 
age. We need to give people what they need to know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of what consumers say they need is more information on the amount of 
cholesterol, fat, sodium and sugar in food products -- and even more 
significantly, how those amounts relate to what they should eat. 
</P>
<P>
For example, respondents who wanted more information on total fat wanted a 
breakdown of saturated and unsaturated fats, how much is recommended or 
healthful and the percentage of the recommended amount contained in a product. 
</P>
<P>
"They want it in perspective," said James T. Heisler, vice president of Opinion 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
NFPA's Graham said that a food label should tell people what's in a product but 
questioned whether it's the responsibility of food companies to "put it into 
context." Graham cited space restraints and said that a "label can't do 
everything," adding that it is the responsibility of schools and the government 
to help the public put the numbers into perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, food labels are required to list ingredients in descending order of 
weight. Nutrition information, the section of the label that lists calories 
etc., must be used if any vitamins, minerals or protein have been added, or if 
advertising or labeling contains a nutrition claim such as "low sodium." 
</P>
<P>
Products that fit neither category aren't required to carry nutrition 
information, although a manufacturer may do so. 
</P>
<P>
If nutrition labeling is used, the amount of calories, carbohydrates, fat, 
protein and sodium per serving must be listed, as well as the percentage 
provided of the U.S. recommended daily allowance for protein and seven vitamins 
and minerals. The amount of cholesterol and fiber and the breakdown of the 
types of fat are not required. 
</P>
<P>
Among the survey's findings: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Approximately 80% of respondents either always or sometimes read food 
labels the first time they buy a product, and about 60% read them at other 
times. People who read food labels are most interested in sodium and fat 
content, and people who don't read them just aren't interested. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Half of the respondents say ingredient and nutrition information influence 
what they buy "a great deal." Cereal and canned foods are the two product 
categories for which that information has the greatest influence on purchase 
decisions. Snack foods and produce are the two product categories in which that 
information has the least influence. 
</P>
<P>
 -- More than half of those questioned didn't know that ingredients on a label 
are listed from the most to the least amount contained in the product.

THE BUTCHER: JAPANESE ARE EMERGING AS IMPORTANT CONSUMERS OF U.S.-PRODUCED BEEF

<P>
The National Beef Cook-Off was held in Portland, Ore., this year. It was quite 
an event. 
</P>
<P>
The cook-off has changed a lot since the first time I attended back in 1978 in 
Oklahoma City. That was only the fifth annual event and a small affair compared 
to this year's 16th with more than 600 people in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
There is something, however, about those early cook-offs that I miss. They 
weren't quite so well organized, for sure. They didn't provide the media with a 
dozen pages of National Beef Cook-Off facts and trivia the way the public 
relations firm does these days, and we didn't get the prepared text of the 
guest experts' speeches on such subjects as emerging food trends, latest 
nutrition findings and the changing consumer -- impact of new and overlapping 
consumer segments. 
</P>
<P>
What we did get in the early days of the cook-off was a chance to meet and talk 
with the real people who make up the beef industry: cattlemen and cattle women. 
They kind of got lost in the crowd this year, what with all the public 
relations people, the press, the experts and the Japanese. There were probably 
more people in attendance this year from Japan than the total in attendance in 
Oklahoma City in '78. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is becoming an important customer for the American Beef Industry and the 
U.S. Meat Export Federation. Why else would Chiemi Akahori, Japan's leading 
cooking expert, be in attendance, doing a cooking demonstration as part of the 
program? 
</P>
<P>
Sukiyaki is traditionally cooked at the table, so first arrange meat and 
vegetables attractively on a large platter or tray. The Japanese are very 
particular about how food is presented since, according to them, "food is first 
eaten with the eyes." Have small containers of sugar, soy sauce and beef stock 
handy. 
</P>
<P>
When eating rice from a bowl with chopsticks, it is proper to hold the rice 
bowl under the chin. Use the large square ends of the chopsticks for retrieving 
food from the pot and the smaller round ends for eating. 
</P>
<P>
SUKIYAKI 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons peanut oil or some small pieces of beef suet 
</P>
<P>
1 pound well-marbled beef rib eye, sliced paper thin 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup beef stock 
</P>
<P>
1 bunch green onions, cut on diagonal into 2-inch lengths 
</P>
<P>
1 cup celery, cut on diagonal into 2-inch slices 
</P>
<P>
1 cup sliced mushrooms 
</P>
<P>
1 (5-ounce) can water chestnuts, drained and sliced thin 
</P>
<P>
1 (5-ounce) can bamboo shoots, drained and slivered or diced 
</P>
<P>
2 bunches fresh spinach leaves, stems removed 
</P>
<P>
1 cup fresh bean sprouts 
</P>
<P>
12 to 16 ounces tofu, cubed 
</P>
<P>
2 to 4 ounces Shirataki (dry bean threads) soaked in hot water and drained 
</P>
<P>
Hot cooked rice 
</P>
<P>
Preheat 12-inch electric skillet. Add oil or suet. If using suet, rub over 
bottom and sides of pan until 2 tablespoons fat has melted, then remove. 
</P>
<P>
Add beef 1 slice at time until bottom of pan is covered. Cook, turning each 
slice over and over, 1 or 2 minutes until just brown. Push first slices aside 
to add any remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkle meat with sugar. Pour over soy sauce and beef stock. Push meat to one 
side. Let soy sauce mixture bubble. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping in separate groups, add onions, celery and mushrooms, in that order, 
one at time. Continue cooking and toss-stirring each group over high heat for 
about 3 minutes, then push to one side. 
</P>
<P>
Again keeping in separate groups, add chestnuts, bamboo shoots, spinach and 
bean sprouts in order given. Then add tofu and bean threads. Cook and toss-stir 
each food just until heated through. 
</P>
<P>
Serve each guest piece of meat and little from each group of food on bowl of 
hot rice. Or, more traditionally, serve each guest bowl of rice and let each 
retrieve meat and vegetables from common pan. Makes 4 servings.

ATHLETE-TUTORS AT GRANADA HILLS KEEP TEAM INTACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Henry Shim is a 6-foot-1 1/2, 225-pound defensive tackle at Granada Hills High, 
the kind of player opposing coaches have to address during chalk talks, a guy 
who would be represented by a large X on the blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
For the past several weeks, in a role reversal of sorts, Shim has helped his 
teammates add, subtract, multiply and divide more than a few Xs as part of a 
first-year program to assist players with academic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Shim, a senior, has tutored teammates who were struggling in geometry and 
science courses and is one reason why Granada Hills, the North Valley League 
champion, has been relatively unaffected by eligibility problems that have 
hindered other City Section playoff teams. Mid-semester progress reports were 
released last week and the playoffs began Wednesday. The undefeated Highlanders 
will play El Camino Real in second-round of the 4-A Division next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Co-Coach Darryl Stroh said at the semester's five-week mark that about 35 of 65 
Granada Hills players were in danger of losing their eligibility. In the L. A. 
Unified School District, students involved in extracurricular activities must 
maintain a 2.0 grade-point average and receive no failing marks to remain 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
Stroh said that the five-week report served as a red flag, prompting him to 
help establish the first tutoring program for football players in his tenure. 
And while 10 Granada Hills players were declared ineligible, no starters were 
lost, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were going to have any chance of survival, it had to be done," co-Coach 
Tom Harp said. "It's an additional burden for the coaches, but we had to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Using players as teachers, Shim said, turned out to be a boon. Sometimes, it 
helps to speak to someone in their own language. Shim found some players 
particularly receptive to his ideas and methods, however rudimentary. 
</P>
<P>
Square one: the square-out. 
</P>
<P>
"Jermaine Love, a receiver on our team, was having trouble with a geometry 
problem," Shim said. "He was really confused about angles. So I drew him a 
football diagram with a quarterback and two receivers." 
</P>
<P>
And Love, who leads the team with 27 receptions for 410 yards, soon caught on. 
</P>
<P>
"I showed him that when a receiver ran a square-out that it was a right angle," 
Shim said. "All of a sudden, he understood." 
</P>
<P>
Other players serving as tutors included Jordan Fisher, Alex Villa, Charles 
Carpenter and Kirk Langer. The experience of having peers as teachers was a 
constructive one for the entire team, Stroh said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had kids who excel in certain subjects teaching the others," Stroh said. 
"It worked out real well." 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills Principal Anne Falotico said that she was surprised at the ease 
with which the players adapted to the role of teacher. Talk about your 
scholar-athletes -- this has been double duty redefined. 
</P>
<P>
"It's thrilling to see a Charles Carpenter or Kirk Langer up there," she said. 
"They teach better than some of the experienced teachers we have. Some 
(players) are just sensational. 
</P>
<P>
"They have an easy way of presenting things and the kids aren't afraid to ask 
questions. It's fun to see the kids sitting down helping one another." 
</P>
<P>
Stroh scheduled the tutoring sessions on Mondays and Thursdays, when practices 
are typically shorter, so that players who are bused to the school from the 
inner city could attend and still catch their ride home. Most bused players 
chose to stay over with friends in the Valley, however. As part of the program, 
Stroh arranged for each bused player to have the option of staying overnight at 
the home of a Valley teammate. 
</P>
<P>
"(Stroh) did a really good job of setting it up," said Shim, who was born in 
South Korea and immigrated to the United States in 1980. "It's been interesting 
and a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Under the tutorial plan, players on shaky academic ground were asked to attend 
the tutorial classes. Stroh attended the classes and members of the Granada 
Hills faculty also volunteered time, Falotico said. 
</P>
<P>
Some playoff-bound schools didn't fare as well when grades were released. Taft, 
the West Valley League champion, lost 15 players, including four starters. 
Reseda and Van Nuys each lost four starters. El Camino Real lost three 
non-starters, Kennedy lost 10 players -- only one was a starter, Cleveland lost 
two starters and San Fernando lost one. 
</P>
<P>
Stroh said he believes that starters fared better than reserves because the 
starters might have felt more pressure from teammates to remain eligible. 
Reserves, he added, might not have been as inclined to study as hard because 
their playing time was limited. 
</P>
<P>
"On a given night, we had 25-40 kids in there," Stroh said. "Of the 10 guys 
that we lost, I'd say only one of them really attended the tutoring regularly. 
No special treatment was given to starters." 
</P>
<P>
The academic successes of this season are underscored by what nearly happened 
in 1988. Last year, without the after-school program, the Highlanders would 
have lost four or five starters to eligibility, Stroh said. Granada Hills lost 
in the first round of the playoffs, before the 10-week eligibility rulings were 
handed down. Had the Highlanders won their playoff opener, the academic ax 
would have swung the following week. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have lost some big-time players, that's for sure," Stroh said. 
</P>
<P>
Langer, a team captain and a starter at inside linebacker, said that the 
tutoring idea was conceived after a recent trip to San Diego State. While 
visiting former Granada Hills football players Sebastian Glaze and Dave Kim, 
Langer learned that the pair -- both are redshirting as freshmen -- were 
required to attend two hours of study hall each day after practice. 
</P>
<P>
Langer and teammate Terrance Bito approached Irv Burch, the administrator in 
charge of athletics at Granada Hills, and suggested that a tutoring program be 
established for players in academic straits. Because practices normally run 
until 5 p.m. or later, players were unable to take advantage of previously 
established after-school tutoring programs at the school. Players felt that 
something needed to be done to address their needs, Langer said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it worked better than anyone thought," said Langer, who tutored 
teammates in algebra and trigonometry. 
</P>
<P>
Langer said that the sessions were not a one-sided affair. 
</P>
<P>
"You learn it better yourself when you're teaching it," Langer said. "It forces 
you to break it down so they can understand it, and it also helps you." 
</P>
<P>
There were also unforeseen benefits. Sure, the team GPA soared like a punt 
catching a thermal, but so did morale. 
</P>
<P>
"We were supposed to be working on school, but we ended up talking about other 
things," Shim said. "It really ended up being a bonding thing too."

PARTNERSHIP FLOURISHES WITH DOSE OF HORSE SENSE; 
</P>
<P>
EQUESTRIENNE: CALABASAS RIDER LAUREN KAY, WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM HER FRIEND, 
MELVIN, PLACES SECOND IN PRESTIGIOUS EVENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lauren and Melvin have been partners for several years now, and during those 
years they've formed a special and profitable relationship. 
</P>
<P>
The key to their partnership is Melvin's easygoing nature. Lauren says that she 
can demand more from him that way. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin is a horse. 
</P>
<P>
Together, Lauren Kay, 17, and Melvin placed second out of 100 entrants in the 
ASPCA-McClay National Finals, a prestigious equitation event for junior riders 
that tested the extent of their partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like I walk in the ring and I have total concentration on what I have to 
do," Kay said. "The only thing I think about is my horse and myself and the 
course I have to ride, so if there's an audience, I don't think about that. I 
know exactly where my horses weaknesses and strengths are, and where I have to 
push him a little more to get what I want and where I can ease off and he can 
do it himself. It's like me and the horse alone, and everything flows." 
</P>
<P>
The finals were held in early November at the Meadowlands in New Jersey, and 
Kay's accomplishment is even more impressive when one considers that only three 
other Californians have ever placed as high in this predominantly East Coast 
event. 
</P>
<P>
"They (East Coast) have more numbers than we do in terms of people who ride and 
go to this event and it's held on the East Coast, so it's more expensive and 
harder for a West Coast (rider) to go back there," Kay said. "The East Coast 
riders are basically more prestigious than the West Coast, but we're coming up 
and bringing a name for the West Coast." 
</P>
<P>
Kay, a senior at Calabasas High, qualified as one of 15 entrants from 
California for September's regional finals, which are held throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The equitation is an equestrian event that consists of a number of jumps that 
test both the rider's ability and appearance. Before the competition, each 
rider will walk the course and select an option as to how many steps, or 
strides, their horse will take between jumps. This allows the rider to get a 
feel for the course and decide, with the horses weaknesses and strengths in 
mind, which option they will take. 
</P>
<P>
"In the morning, at 5:30, they start with a warm-up class, which is judged but 
it doesn't count toward the event," Kay said. "It's just so you and your horse 
can get acclimated to the ring. Then, about 8:30, they start the first round, 
which is elimination. So all 100 people get to do the course, and then after 
that they work about 25 people on the flat, which means no jumps. You just do 
flat exercises, and then from that 25 they pick 17 people to return in the 
afternoon for the final." 
</P>
<P>
The elimination round is a demanding jumping course in a small ring with a 
large number of stride options and tight turns designed to test both the 
rider's and the horse's skills. After the flat round, a shorter, more difficult 
jumping course is set for the final. A horse has three recognized speeds; walk, 
trot, and canter, with the canter the fastest and the walk the slowest. In the 
final round the speeds are varied to increase the difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally you canter all the fences, but as a test to show how balanced your 
horse is, you do a trot jump," Kay said. 
</P>
<P>
A counter-canter also was added to the final round. 
</P>
<P>
"Counter-canter means you're cantering on the horse's outside leg," Kay said. 
"A horse usually canters on the inside leg, (meaning) whichever leg is on the 
inside leads, but a counter-canter means the outside leg leads, and it's harder 
for the horse to balance that way." 
</P>
<P>
Kay initially was tied for first with Ray Texel of New Jersey after the final 
elimination round, which necessitated a tiebreaker. The two riders switched 
horses and rode the course again, which allowed Texel to edge out Kay. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a little bit more experienced," Kay said. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the age at which Kay started riding, that statement is surprising. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was little my mom always had horses," Kay said. "I first rode when I 
was five and I just loved horses and I loved doing it. When I was nine I got my 
first horse, and I've been seriously competing since I was about 11." 
</P>
<P>
But with the time and effort involved in competing, it's easy to wonder what 
the appeal is. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the appeal is," Kay said. "I love competition. I mean I 
thrive on winning, and it's a neat relationship between me and my horse. We 
have a special relationship and understanding. I know what kind of mood he's in 
when I ride him that day and how to react to his moods so I don't get him 
upset. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't get along with your horse, or if your horse has a bad attitude, 
it takes away a lot," Kay said. "But when you guys get along perfectly, it's 
like everything works out."

PASSERS SHOW THEIR WINNING HANDS;

<P>
HART: CONTROVERSIAL ROB WESTERVELT SPEAKS HIS MIND AND UNDERMINES OPPOSING 
DEFENSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Adjectives abound when the topic is Rob Westervelt. 
</P>
<P>
To friends, Hart High's All-Southern Section quarterback, is talented, 
tenacious, successful and a motivator. 
</P>
<P>
To foes, Westervelt is cocky, mouthy, arrogant and a bit of a jerk. 
</P>
<P>
Could be that Westervelt, an outspoken senior with shuffling feet, rifling arm 
and jutting jaw is a bit of all of the above. 
</P>
<P>
On the field, he commands the spotlight, sparring verbally with opponents, 
sometimes locking face masks with teammates in an attempt to motivate, and 
generally making his presence known. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a very aggressive kid," first-year Coach Mike Herrington says. "He's 
almost like a linebacker in a quarterback's body." 
</P>
<P>
But Westervelt, 6-foot-3 and 210 pounds, stands tall in the pocket and isn't 
bothered by the rush of conflicting opinions. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what some people think, but I really don't care," he says. "If I cared 
what they think, then maybe. . . . But if those people think that, then that's 
fine. I'm sure they know I think of them the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Form your opinion accordingly, but make no mistake about his worth. Westervelt 
has proven himself as a leader and a winner. For the past two seasons, he has 
been the Indians' unmistakable on-field chief, calling the signals, sometimes 
calling the shots, while establishing himself as one of the state's best high 
school quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want a kid that's passive," Herrington says. "You want to have a kid 
that can take control. It can be overdone, but I don't think Rob's done that 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Hart (10-1) travels to Paramount for a 7:30 game in the second round 
of the Southern Section Division III playoffs. Paramount (10-1) eliminated Hart 
in the opening round last season en route to capturing the division 
championship. But Westervelt, ever cocksure, insists that the outcome will be 
different this time. 
</P>
<P>
"I think," he says matter-of-factly, "that we're going to pound them." 
</P>
<P>
When he isn't firing salvos, Westervelt is firing footballs. Last season, he 
passed for 2,130 yards and 21 touchdowns. This season, he has thrown for 1,950 
yards -- second to Alemany's Joey Rosselli among Valley quarterbacks -- with an 
area-high 24 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
His totals this season undoubtedly would be higher if not for the fact that he 
has played only three full games and has spent the fourth quarter of several 
blowouts on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
He also endured a one-game suspension by school administrators for his 
involvement in an on-campus fight ("He pushed me," Westervelt says, "and then I 
thought, 'Oh my God, I'm going to kill this guy!' "). 
</P>
<P>
On the field, Westervelt relishes the dirty work, charging up the middle on 
impromptu quarterback sneaks or serving as lead blocker after pitching the ball 
to a running back. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to play hard and get intense," Herrington says. "And he's not 
intimidated by anyone. In fact, he tries to intimidate the other team." 
</P>
<P>
Westervelt's point exactly. 
</P>
<P>
"I jump up in the other guy's face," he says. "After I've yelled at them or 
after I've hit them blocking, I want them to look over at me and say, 'Who the 
hell is that?' They start yelling at me and then they go, 'If that's just their 
quarterback, what about their other guys?' " 
</P>
<P>
Westervelt has indeed put up, so why shut up? Well, he doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
He unabashedly comments on anything -- players, coaches, rivals. While his 
remarks might seem like a breath of fresh air to some, they might seem abrasive 
to others -- especially those in his firing line. 
</P>
<P>
Some samplings from The World According to Westervelt: 
</P>
<P>
* On Canyon High, Hart's cross-town rival: "We hate Canyon, everything about 
Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
* On Canyon Coach Harry Welch, a noted disciplinarian: "He's a good coach, but 
I just could not play for him. I can't put up with. . . . stuff like 'You're 
running because you didn't do this right,' and treating me like a baby." 
</P>
<P>
* On Crespi, Hart's lone conqueror this season: "That game was just a mental 
letdown. If we played them again, we'd destroy 'em. By far." 
</P>
<P>
* On teammates: "When there's a problem, I'm screaming. I feel like everyone 
expects me to be the leader when there's a time to be a leader. I can tell when 
there is a big problem and that it's not going to be solved by saying, 'You 
shouldn't do this.' " 
</P>
<P>
* On himself: "If I feel I'm going overboard, then I slow down. If the coach 
says, 'Hey, Rob, knock it off,' I stop. When it's time to listen, I listen and 
the coach has my full attention. I never talk back." 
</P>
<P>
The flip side of Westervelt is one of a conciliatory and gracious competitor. 
He credits teammates and praises opponents during postgame interviews. He is 
modest and polite. 
</P>
<P>
In the classroom, he maintains a 2.8 grade-point average, which, he says, he is 
striving to improve to 3.0 to enhance his chances of landing a college 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Several Division I colleges are interested in Westervelt, including Stanford, 
Washington, San Diego State and numerous other West Coast schools. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really a split personality," Barbara Westervelt says of her son. "He's 
proud of himself. He's proud of his size and he's proud of the games that he's 
had, and I think at times he wants to flaunt that. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a game to him. He really isn't the bad boy that everybody makes him 
out to be. He's just a big stuffed animal at home." 
</P>
<P>
Says Westervelt: "I'm not difficult to deal with. But when we start playing, 
just the aggressiveness and the competitiveness comes out. I'm trying to 
project that." 
</P>
<P>
He has succeeded. While coaches and teammates are appreciative of his 
contributions, they also note that sometimes, like a bad masseur, Westervelt 
rubs the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the linemen don't appreciate the way he's loud," tight end Chad 
Fotheringham said. "When Rob's on the field, he tries to take over everyone. It 
never gets that bad. He knows exactly how far he can take it. He has to." 
</P>
<P>
Says center Tim DeGroote: "He tries to get everybody up and he does it in a way 
of yelling at you. We just take it that way, but sometimes he goes a little too 
far." 
</P>
<P>
Few words with Westervelt on the subject of restraint, however, have been 
necessary, Herrington says. The quarterback has a leash, albeit a long one. 
</P>
<P>
"Rob has crept over the boundaries a few times this year and we have to push 
him back to make sure that he concentrates on his execution of the offense," 
Herrington says. "It's a case of just being able to channel the energy that he 
has. But he's grown throughout the year as far as that goes." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Westervelt jousted with Hart Coach Dave Carson, whose play-calling 
he openly criticized and sometimes overruled in the huddle. "He always thought 
I tried to coach too much," Westervelt says. "I did. But somebody had to." 
</P>
<P>
After posting six consecutive Foothill League titles, Hart fell to third place 
last year with a 6-5 overall record. Carson, after only one season, was 
unexpectedly forced to resign in July after repeated conflicts with school 
administrators about his coaching and disciplinary methods. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, who has remained at Hart as a teacher, was out of town this week and 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Herrington, a Hart assistant from 1980-87, returned to the school after a 
one-year stint at Bellflower High. Westervelt, under the tutelage of brothers 
Rick and Dean Herrington, had passed for more than 2,800 yards as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, Westervelt was happy with the coaching change. But not with 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Herringtons came back," Barbara Westervelt says, "they said, 'Rob, 
we're amazed at how many people hate you.' All that hurt Robby because none of 
it's intentional. He said, 'Why would that be, Mom? What do I do to be hated by 
people?' 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's a little misunderstood and maybe he wants to be. He doesn't show 
that it bothers him, but maybe inside it does." 
</P>
<P>
Just don't count on Westervelt letting you know. His tongue may be sharp at 
times, but his actions speak much louder than his words. 
</P>
<P>
"He's doing exactly what we want him to do," Herrington says. "He's doing a 
great job reading coverages and he's doing a great job running the ball and 
blocking. That's what it boils down to, his performance." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
NOTRE DAME: FIERY GREG ANDRACHICK HAS BLAZED A NEW TRAIL BY SPARKING THE 
KNIGHTS TO THEIR FIRST POSTSEASON WIN. 
</P>

<P>
It is said history repeats itself, but in the case of Notre Dame High's 
football team, history has been reduced to a gut course: The school has not won 
a postseason game since opening in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
Or had not won, until the fourth quarter of a Southern Section Division VII 
playoff opener last week, when Greg Andrachick dived across the goal line on a 
three-yard bootleg to defeat Righetti, 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
It was a revolution No. 9, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
How appropriate for Andrachick, who wears No. 9, to fake the handoff to Errol 
Small and take what proved to be a historic plunge. Small, who has rushed for 
1,117 yards and scored 21 touchdowns, was an obvious choice for the carry. But 
Andrachick, a senior quarterback, has become the catalyst of Notre Dame's 
offense, which averaged 31 points a game in building a 10-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
The image of Andrachick is emblazoned in the memory of those coaches who once 
viewed him as a forgotten man in the Knights' offense. Beating Notre Dame, they 
have found, requires beating Andrachick. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't feel that way up until we played them," said Harvard Coach Gary 
Thran, whose team held Small to 43 yards but lost to the Knights, 42-0. In that 
game, Andrachick completed 12 of 19 passes for 213 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"He really took over that game for them when we stopped Errol," Thran said. "He 
does not make a mistake. He will not do anything that will hurt the team. When 
he decides to do something with the ball, it will not be negative." 
</P>
<P>
Andrachick will have plenty of chances to do something positive tonight when 
Notre Dame plays at San Marino, the defending division champion, in a 
second-round game. 
</P>
<P>
As he has done in earlier games, Andrachick will draft a list of nine specific 
goals for himself. He chooses nine points to correspond with his jersey number. 
Many of his previous goals begin with "Do not," such as "Do not pitch the ball 
while being tackled," and "Do not run straight up." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Andrachick doesn't wear a higher number. He is accomplished at so 
many skills that he would rapidly run out of "Do nots" for his list. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Andrachick and center Joe Vanek have fumbled just one exchange in 
four seasons and, by Andrachick's recollection, he has never bobbled an 
exchange with a running back. 
</P>
<P>
He also has one of the Valley's lowest interception ratios (one interception 
for every 26 passes) and highest yards-per-completion average (17.5 yards). He 
has passed for 1,135 yards and 12 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Andrachick leads in deed and has the charisma to whip teammates into a frenzy. 
"He doesn't get half the credit he deserves. He really runs the offense," Vanek 
said. "In the huddle when you're down, you're not looking at Errol to bring you 
up, you're looking at Greg. He takes over. He's usually the one smiling and 
clapping." 
</P>
<P>
No pushover, Andrachick was even booted from practice last month for berating a 
lineman during sprints. Friends say they like his rough and feisty attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Well, sometimes they like it. 
</P>
<P>
During a junior varsity game against St. Francis two years ago, Andrachick's 
line, weary from crouching, did not appreciate his prolonged snap count. They 
told him so, but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a bit too strong willed," Vanek said. "So we broke him. We let him get 
pounded three times in a row. After that game, he had new-found respect for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Such jarring episodes are rare for Andrachick. He has learned to survive 
running out of the pocket and enjoys his journeys into the unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"Most quarterbacks drop back and when the rush comes, that's it," Andrachick 
said. "For me, that's where it begins. I feel like a Randall Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get out of the pocket, I can throw or run. I get a lot more on the 
ball. I'm a lot more accurate. I can see things better. My strength is when I 
get flushed out." 
</P>
<P>
But Andrachick, who also plays baseball, is finding that college recruiters are 
not knocking at his door. At 6 feet, 170 pounds, he may be speedy but he's not 
the archetypal quarterback. A Northern Arizona University coach called, but 
Andrachick said he could wind up playing for an area junior college. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the kid's a great competitor," said Glendale College Coach John 
Cicuto, a Notre Dame alumnus who has seen three Knights' games this season. "I 
think he's a real good potential junior college quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
Cicuto likes the fact that Andrachick will snap back at anyone short of Chuck 
Norris. 
</P>
<P>
"I think quarterbacks have to be a little cocky," he said. "Those guys lead you 
to big wins over big teams. If a kid is cocky but he works hard at it, then 
that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
But tonight, Andrachick will not be thinking about life after Notre Dame. And 
selecting a college will not be on his list of nine goals. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to sit down with my coach and talk to him about that," he said. "But 
right now, that's like the least important thing." 
</P>
<P>
Andrachick has more pressing concerns. History, being one. 
</P>
<P>
"They always talk about that team with Tim Foli on it," Andrachick said. (Foli 
was an All-Southern Section quarterback for Notre Dame in the late 1960s before 
embarking on a lengthy professional baseball career.) "It's nice that now 
they're going to talk about us -- hopefully, the team with me on it and Errol 
-- and all the other guys. We'll erase that other team. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be the best team there."

STOMPING ON THE DAISIES; 
</P>
<P>
MIDDLE LINEBACKER LANCE MARTIN STANDS AS A FEROCIOUS SYMBOL OF THE VAUNTED 
THOUSAND OAKS DEFENSE, BUT HE GAINED TOUGHNESS WITHOUT LOSING A GENTLE NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Lance Martin's daisy, being in the fragile condition it was, is dead now, 
probably the victim of too many arid summer days, too few rainy ones. 
</P>
<P>
More likely, however, its demise is linked to far too much Lance Martin. 
</P>
<P>
For this particular daisy was not merely the unwitting victim of Southern 
California's mean streak, it was also an accomplice in the seeding and growth 
of Martin, who is better known as Thousand Oaks High's bodacious middle 
linebacker than as a botanical barbarian. 
</P>
<P>
Flora-cide, however, did not come naturally to Martin. Indeed, there was a time 
when he could have pinned that daisy to his practice jersey, worked out for 
several hours with the rest of the Lancers and not bruised a petal. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore, Martin was little more than a nice kid -- which is terrific for 
the Explorations in Photosynthesis Club but not so spiffy when you're supposed 
to be stuffing the run. 
</P>
<P>
All of which caused Paul Gomes, the Thousand Oaks' assistant coach who spends a 
lot of time telling linebackers just how difficult Paul Gomes is to please, to 
relay messages to Martin. Messages, of course, at big-time decibel levels. 
</P>
<P>
"I would tell him to quit sniffing the daisies and pull them out," Gomes says. 
</P>
<P>
It was his way of saying, hit like a linebacker, act like a linebacker and 
think like a linebacker. Essentially, be a linebacker. Go ahead, grab a 
handful. 
</P>
<P>
Martin never played youth football and an injury shortened his freshman season 
at Thousand Oaks, so when he was promoted to the varsity in 1987 -- his 
sophomore year -- it was essentially his first look at the sport. 
</P>
<P>
It was, at times, a rocky initiation. 
</P>
<P>
"I came up and didn't really know much at all," Martin says. "It really opened 
my eyes. I was really intimidated and I wasn't aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
Gomes also noticed, which triggered his daisy routine. 
</P>
<P>
"All the time they called me a daisy sniffer," Martin says with a subtle laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Having caught scent of this, Rella Martin, Lance's mother, bought a single 
daisy and planted it ever so neatly in the back yard of their Thousand Oaks 
home. Often Martin would stand outside the back door, challenging the daisy, 
staring it down. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime during that 1987 season, Thousand Oaks' Southern Section championship 
season, the daisy blinked first. It died shortly thereafter. The moment was 
among the first in Martin's gradual maturation into his present status as 
Ventura County's most dominant defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
His ability to read the intent of an offensive play and move to the ball is 
uncanny. When he gets there, people start counting limbs. 
</P>
<P>
"At first," Gomes said, "I like to ride people hard until they get to the level 
they should be at. Every day I would talk to Lance about the daisies. I'd say, 
'Lance, when you figure out what you're doing, you're going to kill people.' " 
</P>
<P>
Well, he figured it out. And he is killing people. Offensive people, mostly. He 
shrugged off the teasing that a rather large, timid guy typically generates, 
became more aggressive, and now Martin is the cornerstone of the 
well-chronicled brick-house defense at Thousand Oaks. He also plays tight end. 
</P>
<P>
"I got in my mind, enough is enough," Martin said. "It was time to grow up." 
</P>
<P>
He has sprouted a couple inches and gained 30 pounds since his sophomore season 
to top out at 6-foot-1, 215. 
</P>
<P>
He bench-presses 350 pounds, easy. He covers 40 yards in 4.6 seconds -- all of 
which gives opposing ballcarriers barely enough time to scream and brace 
themselves for the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"When he hits you, he's not that smacking sound," Gomes said. "He makes 
crunches. They're these low, crunching sounds. Lance just breaks you. He 
engulfs you." 
</P>
<P>
In his three seasons, including sporadic playing time in the first, Martin has 
273 tackles and four interceptions. This season, he leads the Lancers with 123. 
Thousand Oaks, which plays atLeuzinger tonight in the second round of the 
Southern Section Division II playoffs, yields less than 140 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers have shut out five of their 11 opponents, including a 21-0 whipping 
of Newbury Park two weeks ago that clinched the league championship. 
</P>
<P>
"He's our all-opponent of the year," Newbury Park Coach George Hurley said of 
Martin. "We couldn't block him. I think he made the first 14 tackles against 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Martin hung 17 tackles on the Panthers, six days after ringing up 20 in a 
nonleague victory over Warren. 
</P>
<P>
The progression has hardly shocked Thousand Oaks Coach Bob Richards, who two 
seasons ago had Martin skip the sophomore level. 
</P>
<P>
"The change has basically been in having confidence in himself," Richards said. 
"We made him a varsity player as a sophomore because we felt he could be a 
great player -- although I don't think he did. And he's been outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
So much so that Martin has drawn the interest of several Pacific-10 Conference 
schools, along with San Diego State and Arkansas, among others. Whoever lands 
him gets an all-around athlete, a guy who batted .379 his junior year on the 
baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty particular about linebackers," Gomes said, "and we all feel Lance 
is a Division I prospect. Whoever gets a hold of him, they've got themselves a 
jewel. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best kid I've ever met. He's so sure of himself and polite and 
well-mannered. I bark quite loudly and he has yet to give me a dirty look." 
</P>
<P>
That's because Martin probably doesn't have one. Not enough practice, 
apparently. He does have this one look, though. Not really dirty, but not 
entirely clean, either. It's something with his deep, blue eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got those eyes and they're always wide open during the game," Gomes said. 
"Lance is like our silent leader. The players know, when Lance subtly pats you, 
he means business." 
</P>
<P>
All right, so Lance Martin is a great guy and a potential Division I 
linebacker. He's among the best defensive players in the history of a program 
that has traditionally placed its most skilled athletes on the defensive side 
of the ball. And Gomes, his position coach, lets him baby-sit his two 
preschool-age children. 
</P>
<P>
There's got to be a flaw. A dark side. 
</P>
<P>
Nope, a floral side will have to do. 
</P>
<P>
"He is basically a gentle person," Rella Martin said. "And he enjoys a great 
deal getting out there and doing his job -- stomping the daisies, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lance: "I can't tell how far I've really come, but I can say I know a lot 
more. The way I play and my mentality has come a long way. 
</P>
<P>
"My daisy days are over."

EAST BLOC: AS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS RALLY IN PRAGUE, A PARTY LEADER ASSERTS 
THAT 'REAL CHANGES' WILL BE MADE. THE LEADERSHIP MEETS IN EMERGENCY SESSION 
TODAY.

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than a quarter of a million people jammed into Prague's main square 
Thursday in a rally to support opposition demands for political change, as a 
senior Communist Party figure announced that a shake-up in the party's 
hierarchy is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
Prague party chief Miroslav Stepan, also a member of the ruling Politburo, told 
a group of factory workers in the capital that an emergency party Central 
Committee meeting scheduled for today will produce "real personnel changes." 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee has the power to replace members of the Politburo, 
including hard-line party leader Milos Jakes. 
</P>
<P>
Stepan's comments were made amid signs that a major power struggle has been 
played out within the Communist Party's hierarchy. Although doubts remained 
regarding the outcome, there are signs that reformists may have won the day. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police and the party's own militia reportedly occupied state-run 
Czechoslovak television during the day Thursday, but by evening, they had 
withdrawn. Also believed to have withdrawn from the capital are militia units 
that had arrived Wednesday, triggering rumors that Jakes might use them to 
force an end to the weeklong crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The party daily Rude Pravo carried an article criticizing "the lack of 
flexibility of the hierarchy, which failed to deal with the crisis situation." 
</P>
<P>
Jakes has been under growing pressure as anti-government demonstrations on an 
unprecedented scale have shaken the regime. His resignation, along with those 
of five other senior party hard-liners, is a key demand of the political 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
There is mounting speculation that Jakes himself may be forced out today, 
although some believe he could attempt to dump others from the Politburo first 
in an effort to save himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Jakes is under attack from all sides," said one Communist Party official with 
links to the Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
While the 150-member Central Committee is heavily weighted in favor of 
hard-liners, the intensity of the pressure for change is said to have led a 
number of members to support turnover. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of 'yes, yes' men in there, but already many are swinging 
around," the Communist Party official said. "There are lots of strange 
bedfellows at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
Jakes heads one of the last hard-line Communist governments in Eastern Europe. 
His position has become increasingly precarious since the fall of East German 
hard-liner Erich Honecker last month. 
</P>
<P>
A Czechoslovak Communist Party adviser indicated that Jakes also has come under 
fire from Moscow, with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev reportedly 
demanding that the Prague regime move ahead with reform. 
</P>
<P>
Jakes reportedly met Thursday with the Soviet ambassador to Prague, Viktor 
Lomakin. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pressure on Jakes, some analysts warned that his departure is not a 
foregone conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's premature to say the game is over," one Western diplomat cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
Jakes himself appeared to show no sign of wavering, telling a group of party 
workers and trade union organizations in northern Czechoslovakia that he "will 
use political means to halt the negative development in society." 
</P>
<P>
Still, party leaders will have to take more than token action to defuse 
mounting support for a two-hour, anti-government general strike planned for 
Monday, diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's rally, opposition leader Vaclav Havel announced that more than 
500 industrial concerns had pledged support for the strike. The stoppage was 
called by the recently formed opposition group Civic Forum to press its demands 
for the resignation of hard-liners and punishment for those responsible for 
police violence against student demonstrators last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Although students and intellectuals in many large cities are backing the 
strike, the support of the workers is vital if it is to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
The massive rally Thursday, by far the largest to date, clearly gave the 
fledgling opposition coalition a powerful emotional boost. 
</P>
<P>
A bit of graffiti sprayed onto a wall near the square summed up the mood of the 
largest rally since protesters began gathering in force one week ago: 
"Victory." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the crowd clapped to the rhythm of the American black spiritual, 
"Let My People Go." 
</P>
<P>
In what one analyst called Havel's first purely political speech, the dissident 
playwright pleaded for greater support for the strike. 
</P>
<P>
"The strike may decide whether we start on the road to democracy or whether an 
isolated group of people will win who want to keep all others out -- people who 
want to keep power by mouthing empty slogans of reconstruction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to an appeal to workers to join the strike, Havel also said the 
Civic Forum remains prepared for a dialogue with the government to chart the 
country's future. 
</P>
<P>
He called on the police and the army "to join the people and, if necessary, 
defend them. We want to live in a free, democratic Czechoslovakia. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
At the same rally, the leader of the small Socialist Party, Jan Skoda, allied 
himself clearly with the opposition, even though his party remains technically 
linked to the Communists as a member of a national front that rules. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider this party again as independent and free," he said. "Our first 
task today is a renaissance of the democratic process. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The opposition received a further boost when former party leader Alexander 
Dubcek addressed a pro-strike rally of about 10,000 people in the city of 
Bratislava. 
</P>
<P>
A letter from the architect of the country's 1968 liberalization was read at 
Wednesday's rally in Prague, and there were rumors he plans to speak at an 
opposition rally here.

LAWMAKERS ARE THREATENED.

<P>
Lebanon settled Thursday into an uneasy day of mourning for assassinated 
President Rene Mouawad amid hasty preparations to select a new national leader 
and escalating fears that Mouawad's murder could demolish the country's fragile 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
Syrian-controlled areas of Lebanon shut down for a "strike of denunciation" 
over the massive bomb blast that killed Mouawad and 23 others Wednesday. 
Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini reportedly was attempting to schedule new 
presidential elections for as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a telephone caller claiming to represent an underground Christian 
group threatened Thursday that lawmakers would face the same fate as Mouawad, 
who had been in office only 17 days, if they held new elections. 
</P>
<P>
"The fate of all these men is at stake," the caller, identifying himself as a 
spokesman for the Christian Solidarity Front, told a Western news agency in 
Muslim West Beirut. "It will not be better than that of Rene Mouawad. We 
strongly warn Christian Parliament members against electing any new president 
for Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
Although the group did not directly claim responsibility for the assassination, 
an organization by the same name issued a death threat against Mouawad the day 
after he was elected Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the parties to Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war spent the day 
accusing each other of responsibility for the assassination, which raised grave 
new doubts about the prospects for a peace plan brokered by the Arab League, 
under which Mouawad had been elected. 
</P>
<P>
In an ominous public address in Damascus, Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Talas 
accused Lebanese Christian leader Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun of ordering the 
killing. Talas warned: "We shall cut off . . . the hand which has assassinated 
Lebanese legitimacy . . . and very soon." 
</P>
<P>
Aoun had refused to accept Mouawad and the fledgling national reconciliation 
plan because of its failure to immediately eject the 40,000 Syrian troops that 
now control much of Lebanon. On Thursday, he demanded that an international 
commission be appointed by the United Nations to investigate the killing and 
called Mouawad "a national martyr because he was murdered in the shadow of the 
Syrian occupation." 
</P>
<P>
Christian troops skirmished briefly with Syrian-backed Druze militiamen in the 
hills above Beirut shortly after dusk. Also, Israeli warplanes launched an 
attack on Palestinian guerrilla bases near Israel's security zone in south 
Lebanon, reportedly killing one guerrilla and wounding four others. 
</P>
<P>
But, despite the increasing turmoil, a spokesman said the Arab League has no 
immediate plans to step in to bolster the peace plan agreed upon with Lebanese 
legislators in Taif, Saudi Arabia, last month. 
</P>
<P>
"We're waiting on the Lebanese," said the spokesman, who asked not to be 
identified. "Consultations are taking place now, and we are waiting to see what 
will happen." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement released in Algiers, the three-member committee of the 
league that oversaw the peace talks emphasized it is prepared "to bring all 
assistance required to help Lebanon find a way out of its unhappiness." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40 members of Parliament on Thursday traveled to Baalbek, about 50 miles 
east of Beirut, to begin their deliberations on a new president. They were 
tentatively planning to convene today at Kleiat, a military airport in 
Syrian-controlled territory, to elect a successor. 
</P>
<P>
Possible candidates include Suleiman Franjieh, a powerful pro-Syrian Maronite 
chieftain who was Lebanon's head of state during the eruption of the civil war 
in 1975, and three other Maronite Christians: Butros Harb, Fuad Naffaa and 
Pierre Helou. 
</P>
<P>
Franjieh was a candidate for the presidency in 1988, but a boycott of the 
parliamentary session by anti-Syrian Christian deputies forced outgoing 
President Amin Gemayel to appoint Aoun as chief of an interim government. 
Lebanon had no permanent head of state until Mouawad's selection, and Mouawad 
had not yet completed the task of building his reconciliation government. 
</P>
<P>
In Damascus, Druze chieftain Walid Jumblatt and Shiite Muslim leader Nabih 
Berri urged the rapid election of a new leader. "Unless we elect a new 
president within 24 hours, or at the very most a very few days, we shall enter 
a period of hell," Jumblatt said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The government of Iran, in a statement carried on Tehran Radio, called the 
assassination a "new conspiracy" to bolster Aoun. Rival Iraq, which supplied 
arms to Aoun's Christian regime during the latest bloody months of fighting, in 
its state-run newspapers accused Syria and Iran of responsibility for the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
While some Beirut residents began fleeing the city again with fears of another 
round of fighting, a weeklong period of mourning began Thursday in 
Syrian-controlled areas of the country, with flags flying at half-mast and 
schools, banks and most shops closed. 
</P>
<P>
The two leading Arabic dailies, Al Nahar and As Safir, ran their normally 
brightly colored logos in gray and black. Lebanese flags and banners that 
festooned the government house, where Mouawad a day earlier had received 
independence day well-wishers, were hastily torn down. Others, stuck to 
electric poles, trees and buildings, remained as souvenirs of what should have 
been Lebanon's first independence day with Mouawad as head of state. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanese journalists, originally scheduled to observe a press holiday following 
the independence celebration, went back to work to put out Thursday's editions. 
All newspapers were filled with photographs of the tragic day. 
</P>
<P>
"Another corpse being put into an ambulance," one caption read, and: "Last 
picture taken of the shahiid (martyr) Mouawad." 
</P>

elections are held in the war-torn country. Associated Press

RIDING THE RAILS IN STYLE; 
</P>
<P>
REGULAR COMMUTERS ON L.A.-SAN DIEGO RUN LEAVE THE DRIVING TO THE HARRIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Train conductor Joseph Byrd glanced anxiously at his pocket watch and scanned 
the suddenly deserted rail platform at Union Station in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"All aboard!" he yelled to no one in particular. Then he produced a 
walkie-talkie from the pocket of his blue suit coat and stepped onto the San 
Diego-bound passenger train. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready," he barked to the engineer. 
</P>
<P>
On board, the train's bar car was already doing a brisk business. Two 
attendants mixed drinks with double shots for weary passengers facing the 
evening's ride home -- to any one of half a dozen stops between Fullerton and 
downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, the train sounded its whistle -- a low and humble utterance as the 
engine built up speed, soon to catch up with and exceed the speed of cars on a 
nearby freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Burly Phil Heathman heard the whistle and smiled, knowing that another Friday 
afternoon commute was finally under way. 
</P>
<P>
An optometrist from Del Mar, Heathman commutes with his father each day to 
their Pomona eyeglass shop. Every weekday morning they catch the 6:45 train out 
of Del Mar and watch the exotic Pacific coastline whiz past, telling jokes and 
sharing quality time. 
</P>
<P>
Like traveling neighbors, they know people at every stop. "Riding Amtrak has 
replaced my social life," Paul Heathman, an optician, says. "It's the only 
place I meet people anymore." 
</P>
<P>
People like George Thompson of Oceanside, a workers compensation judge who 
commutes to Santa Ana each day. Or Sean Barrett, a Carlsbad corporate banker 
who, along with his trusty portable computer, makes office visits to Los 
Angeles several times a week. 
</P>
<P>
On the train, they're known as the regulars -- the judges and high-profile 
attorneys, delivery truck drivers and go-go dancers, skip-tracers and little 
old ladies, bankers, art dealers and optometrists -- even the long-haired man 
who insists that he has just been delivered to Earth by aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 1.6 million passengers rode the 125-mile Los Angeles-San 
Diego rail corridor, the nation's second-busiest passenger train route, 
according to Amtrak statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Among them are riders who spend as much as four hours a day -- 20 hours a week 
-- on the train, beginning with coffee-laden mornings and ending with a few 
high-spirited drinks on the trip home. 
</P>
<P>
As commutes go, the Amtrak is more like a room with a view. 
</P>
<P>
On the San Diegan -- the name for the daily trains between Los Angeles and San 
Diego -- the sea is a familiar companion. At speeds of 80 to 90 m.p.h., the 
train hurtles past the unobstructed ocean vistas at Camp Pendleton until, 
heading north, it turns away from the sea. 
</P>
<P>
It dissects the rolling Orange County hillsides, offering a voyeuristic look 
into the back yards of suburban homes not seen from any freeway. 
</P>
<P>
From there the scenery breaks into a more urban landscape -- the warehouses and 
factories that make up the dark underside of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
For the regulars, the reasons for riding are myriad. Some take the train to 
beat the growing gridlock of Southern California freeway traffic and at the 
same time maybe establish a business contact among other riders. 
</P>
<P>
Others enjoy the freedom of being able to read a book or newspaper, savor the 
view, or even allow the rhythm of the rails to lull them to sleep while they go 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
The commute can be a study in free time. 
</P>
<P>
Some regulars fidget, listen absent-mindedly to the train's clackety-clack, or 
even take a chance and talk to a stranger with a backpack. Some prefer to ride 
facing forward, others like the seats that carry them along backward. 
</P>
<P>
Most forsake the custom class, which has cushier seats and costs extra, 
preferring the regular coaches, where they often sit in the same seats, next to 
the same faces, day after day. 
</P>
<P>
Most avoid the front car on the evening commute when the engine pushes the 
train toward San Diego -- and not just because it is reserved for smokers. 
Conductors call it the "death car" because in the event of a head-on crash, it 
would crumple like an accordion. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, however, the train is a "puller." Some restless men, their suit 
jackets neatly folded in the luggage rack above them, wander up and down the 
aisle, telling jokes to the conductors, introducing themselves to women half 
their age. 
</P>
<P>
Anything to keep from getting behind the wheel of a car. 
</P>
<P>
"When I look out the window and see people backed up on the freeway, I feel 
like I'm cheating the traffic somehow," said John Beliveau, a Del Mar resident 
who drives a delivery truck in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty soon, though, I'm afraid the people out there on the freeway are going 
to get wise to the train," he said. "And then it may be as crowded in here as 
it is out there." 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak officials echo that prediction. By the year 2000, they say, the 
federally subsidized train service may become a preferred method of travel 
between San Diego and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"When there's no more room to build new freeways and the air corridors become 
too crowded, the railroad will become a logical alternative," said Sue Martin, 
an Amtrak spokeswoman in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But many regular passengers say that Amtrak is still miles away from being able 
to railroad the rest of the region. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak has begun a multiphase program to install new track between Los Angeles 
and San Diego, but top officials recently announced there was no money to add 
trains or replace aging signal equipment. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, delays of up to several hours are common, especially after an 
accident on the rails in which the train plows into an unwary motorist, a stray 
animal or a suicide victim. 
</P>
<P>
Judge George Thompson says that, at least once a month, he has to borrow some 
attorney's briefcase telephone to call the court to say he'll be late. 
</P>
<P>
Others are more enterprising. During a recent train breakdown, one passenger 
recalled how he walked to a pay phone and called for a friend to come by with 
his school bus to taxi train riders to their destinations. 
</P>
<P>
The regulars don't suffer delays silently. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ran a business the way the federal government ran Amtrak, you'd go 
broke," said Dick Schwald, an Orange County engineer who regularly commutes to 
Los Angeles. "But I'll tell you one thing they do know how to do -- and that's 
throw a pretty good party." 
</P>
<P>
When Friday afternoon arrives -- and the 4:40 p.m. and 5:50 p.m. trains rumble 
south out of Los Angeles -- most rail passengers are ready to cut loose. 
</P>
<P>
Come Friday, the regular rollers are ready to rock. 
</P>
<P>
Give the regulars a reason to party, and the bar car will instantly become 
adorned with balloons, hand-made banners and crepe-paper decorations, routine 
riders say. 
</P>
<P>
On Halloween, many regulars dress in costume. They exchange gifts on Christmas 
and on Bastille Day celebrate with an assortment of French wines. They also 
throw an annual sock-hop in which prizes are awarded for the wildest socks. 
</P>
<P>
When one regular rider recently turned 40, other passengers hauled in a 
miniature coffin and even talked the conductors into wearing black ribbons as a 
symbol of mourning. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear they even brought in a stripper for the guy," one regular said. "But 
I'm not sure. Unfortunately, my stop came and I had to get off." 
</P>
<P>
According to one party legend, regulars once staged "snake races" in the 
overhead luggage bins, trying to out-wriggle each other to the front of the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
For some, however, the Amtrak ride out of San Diego each day is anything but a 
party. It's a tense adventure that could make the difference between freedom 
and a bus ride back to the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
Several times a month, U.S. Border Patrol agents board the train at Oceanside 
in search of illegal aliens who, under the cover of darkness, might have stolen 
on board in Del Mar or San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, officials estimate, thousands of aliens are snatched from trains 
heading out of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, we get 50 or 60 of them on a single train," said Mike Gregg, a U.S. 
Border Patrol spokesman. "So it adds up." 
</P>
<P>
Regulars say the illegals are often found hiding in bathrooms, in the breezeway 
between cars, even on the roof -- their figures casting eerie shadows toward 
the sea on the morning commute north. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Thompson has a grudging respect for the ingenuity of many of the trains' 
illegal stowaways. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard the story about the two Guatemalans who every Christmas season head 
north on the train from North (San Diego) County, knowing they're going to be 
apprehended by Customs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Since Mexico won't take them, they're flown back to Venezuela. From there they 
take the bus home, a free holiday trip at the expense of the U.S. government." 
</P>
<P>
John Beliveau has another feeling when he sees the timid men and women huddled 
together in the corner of a train car. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they make it, sometimes they don't -- the officers jump out and 
surprise them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"And so you start to root for them. I know a lot of people who do it, they root 
for the underdog. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little bit of intrigue on the morning commute. It's what trains are 
supposed to be all about."

RESEARCHERS ATTACK CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST RULES; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: BACKERS OF THE PROPOSED FEDERAL REGULATIONS CITE A NEED FOR UNBIASED 
JUDGMENT. BUT ACADEMIC SCIENTISTS SAY THE GUIDELINES WILL DELAY THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF DRUGS.

<P>
Academic medical researchers are mounting an aggressive campaign against a set 
of proposed federal conflict-of-interest rules that they say would 
significantly delay the development of drugs and impede progress in critical 
scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
The draft regulations were inspired by disclosures that some researchers had 
received federal grants to test products in which they had financial interests. 
Their dual role raised questions about their ability to perform their work 
objectively. 
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines, which would apply to non-governmental scientists who 
receive federal grants, would sharply curtail the financial relationships that 
have flourished in recent years between researchers and industry. They were 
proposed by the National Institutes of Health and the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and 
Mental Health Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"The measures will be disincentives to maintaining a productive relationship 
for the sake of weeding out the relatively few transgressors," said Dr. Douglas 
Kelly, associate vice president for biomedical research for the American Assn. 
of Medical Colleges. The rules "will only discourage people from coming into 
our profession or continuing in it," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert T. Schooley, a highly regarded AIDS researcher at Harvard University 
who has routinely accepted consulting fees from drug companies, says he 
believes the regulations could cost the United States the competitive edge it 
has long enjoyed in biomedical research. 
</P>
<P>
"If we adopt these rules and the drug companies can't get the advice they need 
to get drugs safely and expeditiously evaluated, we'll turn the pharmaceutical 
industry over to the Japanese, like many of our other industries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Those of us in academic medicine are not interested primarily in money. If we 
were, we wouldn't be in academic medicine -- we'd be working directly for drug 
companies or doing something else." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the measures say they are necessary to preserve the integrity of 
medical research and ensure that its outcome is not influenced by financial 
motives. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to have a system which supports medical research in a way that 
distances the researchers from the immediate pressures of the marketplace," 
said Dr. Arnold Relman, editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, the 
first medical journal to require its authors to disclose financial holdings in 
companies whose drugs are the subject of their research. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is very important for our society to be able to count on the 
unbiased, uninfluenced, dispassionate scientific judgment of academic 
investigators when it comes to biomedical technology," Relman said. "If the 
whole academic biomedical enterprise simply becomes a business, society has 
lost something essential. What can you absolutely trust?" 
</P>
<P>
The regulations were proposed after revelations that some physicians studying 
experimental drugs had held stock or stock options in the companies producing 
those drugs. In one case, doctors who tested the experimental heart drug TPA 
had held stock or stock options in Genentech, the drug's manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
In another, it was disclosed that a Harvard Medical School scientist tested an 
experimental eye ointment on hundreds of patients between 1984 and 1986 at the 
Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. The drug, developed as a therapy for dry 
eyes, apparently failed to work on most of the subjects. A subsequent inquiry 
found that the researcher had allegedly played down the study's negative 
findings while at the same time selling his rights to the formula and his stock 
in the company he had helped establish to market the ointment. 
</P>
<P>
The National Institutes of Health came under increasing pressure, particularly 
from Congress, to develop a system to prevent such abuses. Last June, James B. 
Wyngaarden, then the director of the NIH, promised the House Government 
Operations subcommittee on human resources and intergovernmental relations that 
the NIH would draft guidelines to protect the integrity of the $7 billion in 
grants it awards every year. 
</P>
<P>
"These proposed guidelines should not stifle research creativity or technology 
transfer . . . but rather provide guidance concerning the safeguards needed to 
ensure unbiased performance and reporting of research results," the NIH said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed guidelines, which are open to comments from the public until Dec. 
15, would require researchers who receive federal grants to disclose the 
sources of all their income. They would forbid researchers and their families 
to have personal equity holdings or options in any company that would be 
affected by the outcome of their research or that manufactures a product or 
equipment being studied in the research project. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations would also prohibit researchers from sharing any information or 
products derived from the NIH or Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health 
Administration-funded studies with any company with which a conflict exists 
until the information or products were made publicly available. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, researchers would be barred from receiving grants from the NIH or the 
ADAMHA to evaluate a company's product if the researchers were receiving 
honorariums or fees from the company or held a management position with it. The 
prohibition might apply -- the regulations are not clear on this -- if the 
researcher's financial ties to the company had already been severed at the time 
of the research grant. 
</P>
<P>
It is this regulation that many in the academic community and the biotechnology 
industry feel would seriously impair medical progress. Few companies, they 
argue, have enough in-house expertise to design and launch drug trials, for 
example, and private firms must be free to seek the knowledge from the very 
best sources. 
</P>
<P>
"This would really cut the critical interactions between the people in academia 
-- who know about drug development -- and American industry, which needs their 
expertise," said one California researcher who requested anonymity. "I think it 
will really hurt the research." 
</P>
<P>
Sam Broder, the director of the National Cancer Institute -- who as a full-time 
federal employee is already bound by many of these restrictions -- says the 
rules need to be far more flexible than proposed. He says he does not believe 
grant recipients should be treated as if they worked for the government 
full-time. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can start with the assumption that an industry-academic 
collaboration automatically gives a conflict of interest," he said. "It's very 
common that the very best people in the country would be sought as consultants 
by private companies. This will make it very difficult for companies to seek a 
talent pool." 
</P>
<P>
Broder believes that if the current guidelines had been in place, the rapid 
development of the AIDS drug AZT -- which reached the U.S. market in record 
time -- would have been retarded and possibly blocked. 
</P>
<P>
"AZT required an intimate interaction between the government, the private 
sector and academia," he said. "It required a three-way partnership. No one 
part would have been able to do it alone." 
</P>
<P>
Harvard University's Schooley was paid by Biogen Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., 
company, to help design a clinical trial for the experimental AIDS therapy CD4. 
Biogen had developed the product but did not know how to set up a patient 
study. Schooley is now conducting a CD4 trial under an NIH grant. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the new rules, I would either have to not do the studies or not be 
involved as a consultant to Biogen in developing those studies," he said. "If I 
had to make a choice, I'd probably choose not to be a consultant, because I 
want to be involved in the research. But I believe it's much more efficient and 
smarter to be with it right from the start. If I chose to do the consulting for 
no money, then I might have to generate funds from somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Leonard Minsky, executive director of the National Coalition for 
Universities in the Public Interest, a group founded by Ralph Nader, insists 
that when researchers take both public and corporate money, it only "undermines 
the dispassionate, objective view that a scientist must have -- unless he is a 
saint." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care who he is," Minsky said. "If he's getting large sums of money 
from pharmaceutical houses (with an interest) in drugs he is investigating, he 
has a built-in bias. Maybe he's wearing contact lenses and he's forgotten that 
he's wearing them -- but he's wearing them." 
</P>
<P>
The American Assn. of Medical Colleges' Kelly, who is former chairman of the 
USC School of Medicine's department of anatomy and cell biology, says his 
organization is soliciting reactions from its members. He says he expects the 
organization to propose an alternative to the NIH guidelines that would give 
the researchers' institutions the larger role in policing for conflict of 
interest.

EAST'S WHITE THANKSGIVING, FROSTY PARADES SET RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Record amounts of wet snow gave much of the East a rare white Thanksgiving, 
causing headaches for holiday travelers and frosting the oversized balloons in 
the Macy's parade with New York City's first Thanksgiving snowfall in 51 years. 
</P>
<P>
The storm tracked north along the East Coast Wednesday night and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"All sorts of records, tons of records" were broken, said Harry Woodworth, a 
weather service meteorologist in Newark, N.J., where nearly 6 inches fell in 
less than 24 hours, breaking the Thanksgiving record of 4 inches set in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic City also got a record 6 inches, and 4.7 inches, another daily record, 
fell in New York City, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia also set records with 1.8 inches Wednesday night and 2.8 inches 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the fifth time in 65 years that measurable snow fell in Boston on 
the holiday. The snowfall, at least 4 inches, was the heaviest on record for 
Thanksgiving there since 1925. 
</P>
<P>
The snow piled deeper outside major cities, accumulating to 7 inches in 
Solomons, Md., and on Long Island and to 8 inches in Mays Landing, N.J., just 
inland from Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
Most New York-area fliers already were at their destinations by the time the 
snow hit, said Sgt. Dominick Evangelista of the Port Authority, which oversees 
Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark airports. 
</P>
<P>
High wind at Macy's 63rd annual Thanksgiving Day parade in New York grounded 
the larger-than-life Snoopy and Bugs Bunny balloons. The snow was the first to 
hit the parade since 1938. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a white Thanksgiving!" cheered Nora Deledansky, 12, one of an estimated 
1.8 million shivering spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the record snowfall in Philadelphia, its 70th annual Thanksgiving Day 
parade came off, but not without a hitch. The 55-foot Humpty Dumpty balloon had 
a great fall when it was punctured by a light standard. 
</P>
<P>
New Englanders hauled out shovels and plows as swirling snow canceled holiday 
high school football games and slickened highways clogged with hungry 
travelers. 
</P>
<P>
Winter storm warnings in the Middle Atlantic states were all canceled during 
the morning, leaving most people plenty of time to dig out the car and get to 
their destinations in time for a traditional Thanksgiving dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The storm caught weather forecasters by surprise. At least 1 inch of snow 
cloaked southern Maine and New Hampshire, while at least 8 inches hit Cape Cod 
and Providence, R.I. Up to 9 inches was recorded at Nantucket, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
The snow was blamed for at least three deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Police in North Kingstown, R.I., blamed the snow for an accident that killed a 
Jamestown man. Thomas Jacquard, 18, was killed when his car crossed into the 
opposite lane of traffic on Route 4 and struck an oncoming vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Four inches of snow, the season's first significant snowfall in the Washington, 
D.C., area, sent a car spinning out of control and into the path of a van in 
suburban Fauquier County, Va., Wednesday night. Lucinda Fuerle, 44, and Allison 
Fuerle, 14, of Monroeville, Pa., were killed, police said.

HARD LINE, PROSPERITY CAN'T COEXIST

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those who write the history of the second "Prague Spring" will find its 
beginnings on a crisp autumn night one week ago in this city's Narodni Street. 
</P>
<P>
It was here that yet another hard-line Communist regime lost its ultimate 
weapon of power: fear. Riot police systematically beat many of the 20,000 young 
people who had come into the street that night to demand an end to the regime 
and immediate free elections. 
</P>
<P>
But they failed to crush the overwhelming emotion that filled those who 
marched, sang and tossed flowers at the police that night -- the conviction 
that freedom's hour was at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Within two days of what Prague students now call a police massacre, as many as 
30,000 were back on the street. A day later, it was nearly 10 times that 
number, and the instruments of state repression began to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
"Now those who have drowned our wishes in blood are afraid of us," the 
country's leading dissident, Vaclav Havel, told an anti-government rally 
Wednesday. Speaking beyond the crowd to the beleaguered Communist regime 
itself, Havel declared, "Now your time has come." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, to many it seemed that way: The government suddenly said it would no 
longer use force against protesters. At Prague Radio and Czechoslovak 
television, decades of straitjacketed reporting vanished when the news staff 
refused to put up with the constraints any more. 
</P>
<P>
One excited Czechoslovak journalist, near tears as he looked out on the sea of 
people crowded into the capital's main Wenceslas Square earlier this week, 
could only repeat, "It's so wonderful, it's so wonderful." Then he exclaimed, 
"Perhaps I can even write about it!" 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday, Czechoslovak TV was covering the massive demonstrations live. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic suddenness of the change caught even the most astute, seasoned 
analysts by surprise. In part, the groundswell of opposition in Prague was 
sparked by a powerful message from the streets of neighboring East Germany: 
Peaceful change was now possible from the street, even against the most 
repressive Communist states. 
</P>
<P>
But there is another explanation for the breathtaking speed with which these 
regimes have unraveled in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Czechoslovak leadership became trapped by the same dilemma that Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev saw before he began his major reforms, and that 
the East German leadership only belatedly understood: In the late 20th Century, 
prosperity and political repression simply do not mix. 
</P>
<P>
The choice facing these leaderships was a simple one -- economic stagnation and 
decline or a loosening of their repressive control. 
</P>
<P>
But once launched on a path of economic reform that required a freer flow of 
information, less centralized control and greater independent decision-making, 
the hard-line Communists were doomed. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, what is surprising is that these leaders failed to comprehend 
the consequence of such economic reform. Especially in Czechoslovakia, those in 
the regime had convinced themselves that economic liberalization was possible 
without political change. 
</P>
<P>
Only last week, in a speech to the country's Parliament, did Czechoslovak Prime 
Minister Ladislav Adamec admit he had misjudged the situation. He said a year's 
experience had convinced him that he had, in fact, been wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Economic reform cannot be successful without political reform," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But by last week, it was too late for the regime to control events. Once 
students gathered in strength last Friday, they took courage from their numbers 
and began shouting for freedom. 
</P>
<P>
The students who placed flowers on police shields, lighted candles and rattled 
keys as a symbolic death knell to the regime at that first major demonstration 
had shown they were no longer afraid. 
</P>
<P>
Although crushed by police, they were quickly joined by others. As the taunting 
of Communist Party leader Milos Jakes and demands for the resignation of other 
senior leaders escalated, the regime was paralyzed. With its most vital weapon 
-- fear -- now gone, it had no response. 
</P>
<P>
The threat of last resort -- Soviet tanks -- also no longer applied. 
</P>
<P>
The new confidence of the Czechoslovak people is fragile and most visible at 
the daily mass rallies. The scars of decades of repression do not vanish 
overnight, and many say the hard-liners' only chance to cling to power is if 
they can reimpose that fear. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very important psychological moment," said Vaclav Maly, a dissident 
Roman Catholic priest and spokesman of the recently formed Czechoslovak 
opposition group Civic Forum. "When people are in crowds, they feel stronger." 
</P>
<P>
So do others -- bystanders who viewed the initial demonstration last Friday 
with curiosity and occasionally waved their support were cheering and wildly 
applauding by Tuesday as the processions passed by. The uncertainty and tension 
that ran through the initial demonstrations had vanished. 
</P>
<P>
The sight of defiance unpunished had ignited the silent, long-cowed majority 
and swept through the capital like a firestorm.

The Canadian government admitted Thursday that it financed not one but several 
striptease clubs in a scandal that has enraged the opposition and titillated 
the press. 
</P>
<P>
Canada's Conservative government said Tuesday that a state-run development bank 
provided more than $1 million to a now-flourishing striptease club popular with 
Ottawa civil servants, politicians and foreign dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
Both the government and the development bank have publicly denied knowing the 
funds, which amounted to $850,000 in U.S. currency, were slated for strip 
joints. 
</P>
<P>
It was all a big mistake, an embarrassed Industry Minister Harvie Andre told 
the House of Commons on Thursday, pledging new procedures to prevent it from 
happening again. The admission came after newspaper reports that the Federal 
Business Development Bank had provided hundreds of thousands of dollars to 
strip clubs across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Bank spokesmen were not immediately available for comment on the latest 
developments. The bank, charged with promoting small business in Canada, said 
it has tightened its rules to prevent lending to businesses that might be 
considered offensive.

WILL SHUN ROLE IN LEBANON, ISRAELI SAYS

Israel won't be drawn into the Lebanese conflict again, and Lebanon's Christian 
army commander, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, "will pay the price" for his mistakes, a 
government official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Syria has accused Aoun of involvement in the assassination Wednesday of new 
President Rene Mouawad, a Christian rival of the general. Aoun denies it. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't support Gen. Aoun," said Yossi Olmert, director of the Israeli 
Government Press Office. "We are not in the pocket of any Lebanese warlord; no 
Lebanese warlord is in our pocket." 
</P>
<P>
Israel was allied with the Christians when it invaded Lebanon in 1982 to drive 
out the Palestine Liberation Organization, but it has taken an increasingly 
neutral position since withdrawing in 1985 from all but a border "security 
zone" in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq has backed Aoun because of its enmity for Syria, and Olmert claimed that 
the PLO also supports the Christian general's efforts to drive Syrian forces 
out of Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"The Arab enemies of Syria do not happen to be our friends," Olmert said in an 
interview. He added about Aoun: "He will do what he likes to do, and he will 
pay the price. It is his problem." 
</P>
<P>
In an unusually conciliatory statement toward Damascus, Olmert said: 
</P>
<P>
"We have no problem with the Syrians managing to stabilize Lebanon if it is 
done on a legitimate basis acceptable to the Lebanese, and provided we (Israel) 
are not required to pay the price." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Israel's continuing unrest, violence in the West Bank left three 
Palestinians dead, including a woman killed when a suspected collaborator whose 
car was being stoned opened fire on a crowd, military and Palestinian sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the Palestinians were believed to have been killed by fellow 
Palestinians in the West Bank town of Nablus, a strongly nationalistic enclave 
known for its violence and activism. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Haniyeh Abdelrahim Swaiseh, 35, was shot three times by masked men 
as she entered the Casbah district, Palestinian sources said.

An unmanned barge carrying 5 million gallons of jet fuel drifted for more than 
a day near the site of the Exxon Valdez oil spill before a tug lassoed the 
vessel, the Coast Guard reported. At one point the 400-foot barge drifted 
within 1 1/2 miles of a reef. It broke loose from a tug in stormy weather 20 
miles north of Cape St. Elias in the Gulf of Alaska, near the entrance to 
Prince William Sound. Before the barge was brought under tow, officials had 
considered bringing in an Army ordnance team to blow up the barge and burn off 
the fuel to prevent it from running aground and spilling its cargo. The site is 
about 20 miles south of Prince William Sound, where the Exxon Valdez hit a reef 
on March 24 and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil, the worst spill 
in U.S. history.

A corpse weighted down with a concrete block was pulled from a well on a farm, 
bringing to five the number of bodies discovered in a murder investigation 
focusing on an elderly couple. The discovery near the town of Ludlow, Mo., came 
in the seventh week of an investigation into the disappearance of drifters 
hired to work for Ray and Faye Copeland, a farm couple from nearby Mooresville. 
Copeland is 75 and his wife is 68. Three of the bodies have been identified, 
and the Copelands were charged with murder in those deaths. They are in jail on 
$500,000 bail each, suspected of killing their employees after using them to 
buy cattle fraudulently.

jumpsuit, emerged from the airtight, glass-and-steel module to greet 30 
co-workers, friends and reporters. She then began a medical exam before leaving 
for a Thanksgiving dinner with friends. She had entered the futuristic 
structure the size of a two-car garage Nov. 2 for the longest-ever stay inside 
an entirely independent ecosystem. "She was quite struck by the beauty of the 
system and the knowledge of how it works," said Abigail Alling, director of the 
project.

EASTERN FLIGHT ATTENDANTS JOIN PILOTS, ABANDON STRIKE

Eastern Airlines flight attendants Thursday said they are joining the airline's 
pilots in abandoning an 8 1/2-month-old strike, leaving the machinists to go it 
alone. Eastern said the workers will not necessarily get their jobs back. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the airline already has hired permanent 
replacements. 
</P>
<P>
After some late-night telephone conference calls Wednesday, the 6,000-member 
flight attendants union followed the Air Line Pilots Assn. in deciding to 
return to work while the 8,500-member Machinists union remained on strike. 
</P>
<P>
"It was extremely difficult," said Nancy Currier, vice president of Transport 
Workers Union Local 553. "It was difficult because . . . we do believe in the 
principle of union solidarity." 
</P>
<P>
The pilots union reached its decision after President Bush's eleventh-hour veto 
of a bill to create a congressional advisory commission on Eastern, which filed 
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days after the strike began March 
4. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern said it intended to keep new workers who were hired during the strike. 
Pilots and flight attendants ready to return to work were asked to sign a 
recall list at Eastern, which said it would take them back as openings 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
The number of openings for flight attendants was not immediately available, but 
Currier said 1,500 union attendants had crossed picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
The strike began after 1 1/2 years of federally mediated talks between Eastern 
and the machinists stalemated over demands for $150 million in wage cuts and 
work rule changes.

BUCOLIC SETTING BELIES TOUGH TRAIL AWAITING RANGER CADETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The dense pine forest is alive with birds chirping merrily, with deer, 
chipmunks, raccoon and other wildlife -- an ideal setting for a state park 
ranger academy. 
</P>
<P>
For the handful of cadet rangers attending the William Penn Mott Junior 
Training Center, however, the serene setting is somewhat deceptive. Enrollment 
here represents the culmination of a long, difficult struggle. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of the hardest schools in the state to get into. 
</P>
<P>
"Competition to become a state park ranger is unbelievable," sighed Carol 
Provost of San Diego. She ought to know. She tried for six years before being 
accepted to the academy. 
</P>
<P>
Provost, 30, is one of 15 women and 11 men now enrolled as ranger cadets at the 
state Department of Parks and Recreation training center. They were selected 
from a list of more than 2,000 applicants for the eagerly sought park ranger 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
They are halfway through an 18-week course for new rangers. Provost has a 
bachelor of science degree in resources management. She has been a seasonal 
ranger for the U.S. Forest Service and for the Parks Department the last six 
summers. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of my classmates say being here is the biggest accomplishment of their 
lives. There are a lot of pitfalls. As many as 10% of the class usually washes 
out before the 18 weeks are completed. For me, my biggest accomplishment will 
be when I graduate, put on my Stetson and go to work as a ranger in one of the 
state parks," Provost said. 
</P>
<P>
California has 750 rangers staffing 250 park units. "We go into this thing for 
a sense of fulfillment, not for the money," said Jay Hamann, 54, who graduated 
from the ranger academy last February, the oldest graduate in the 20-year 
history of the training center. 
</P>
<P>
Cadets are paid $1,800 a month. Rangers earn between $22,404 and $33,396 a 
year, depending on experience. 
</P>
<P>
Minimum age to become a ranger is 21. There is no maximum age limit. An 
applicant must have completed at least 60 units of college study and be 
physically fit. Oral and written exams are given, and there is psychological 
screening. 
</P>
<P>
Many ranger cadets have had previous experience working as seasonal rangers 
with the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management 
or state Department of Parks and Recreation, or have worked as rangers for 
county or city parks, as firefighters for the California Department of Forestry 
or as correctional officers. Many have college degrees, and a few have done 
graduate work. 
</P>
<P>
Persistence and patience are a prerequisite to becoming a ranger cadet. Many 
try for years before being accepted. Hamann, now a ranger at Ocotillo Wells 
State Vehicular Recreation Area in San Diego County, had been an applicant 
eight years before he was finally accepted. 
</P>
<P>
He is married and has five children and four grandchildren. He spent three 
years in the Marines, was a teacher-principal for a rural elementary school in 
Sierraville for nine years, taught in other schools and worked 10 summers as a 
seasonal ranger with the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
"I love working outdoors with the public. I know I'm older than dirt to begin a 
new career, but I believe I have a lot of good years left and am certain I can 
make a valuable contribution to the state park system in California as a 
ranger," Hamann said. 
</P>
<P>
For him, the toughest part of his training as a ranger cadet was the physical 
fitness requirements, "the endurance runs, the obstacle course, climbing walls 
and fences that I had to do in order to graduate -- but I made it. The Marines 
put a lot of that into me." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Matthews, 23, of Novato tried for three years before becoming a ranger 
cadet. He has a degree in recreation administration and worked as a seasonal 
employee with the National Parks Service. Sylvia Ramos, 33, has a degree in 
physical anthropology, is married to a state game warden and has an 8-year-old 
daughter. She waited four years before being accepted, working for a year as a 
ranger with the Ventura County Parks Department and for three years as a 
seasonal worker with the state Parks Department. 
</P>
<P>
Cadet Elizabeth McDaniel, 31, from Tierrasanta in San Diego County, is the 
mother of three children. Her husband is a career man in the Navy. She studied 
for three years at the University of Guam and worked as a correctional officer 
for two years at the Ventura County Jail. She tried to become a ranger for four 
years before being accepted. "I love state parks and enjoy working with the 
public," McDaniel said. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, there are one or two ranger cadet classes at the Mott training 
center, depending upon need, as well as more than 20 other educational programs 
for Parks Department employees. Broc Stenman, 42, a 16-year veteran of the 
Parks Department, has been the director of the training center for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
The academy began accepting students in 1969 in a small cottage here in Pacific 
Grove. At dedication ceremonies in 1974 for the training center, made up of 
three residential lodges, classrooms and administrative offices, the 
then-director of parks and recreation, William Penn Mott Jr., declared: 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in any state, a central facility has been built 
specifically to provide basic and advanced educational programs for people who 
operate and manage state parks, beaches and recreational areas." The center was 
renamed in Mott's honor later when he was director of the National Parks 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
According to Stenman, to this day "no other state park department has a 
facility or program approaching California's." 
</P>
<P>
The first 530 hours for a ranger cadet are spent completing the Police Officers 
Standards Training Program, a course required by many law enforcement agencies. 
This part of the training includes instructions in community relations, law, 
evidence, communications, vehicle operations, force and weaponry, defensive 
tactics, arrest control procedures, criminal investigation, custody and 
physical fitness. 
</P>
<P>
Then comes 160 hours studying state park procedures, management policies, 
equipment operation and fire prevention and suppression, as well as learning 
about wildlife, park environment and the history of parks. 
</P>
<P>
Field trips are made to parks for hands-on experience. Cadets receive 12 hours' 
college credit upon completing the course. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 26 ranger cadets now enrolled, there are seven state park 
lifeguards, who are also required to take ranger classes, in attendance. Also 
taking the course are three men and three women advancing to park 
superintendent positions who lack experience as rangers or peace officers.

2 BODIES FOUND NEAR BOAT WRECKAGE OFF AVALON HARBOR; THIRD IS SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bodies of an elderly couple were found floating near the wreckage of a 
small wooden boat 10 miles off Avalon Harbor Thursday and searchers were 
looking for a third body, U.S. Coast Guard officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
The wreckage was spotted by crewmen on the excursion boat, Catalina Countess, 
as it returned to the mainland from Catalina about 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Coroner's deputies said the man and woman may be a Hemet couple whose son owns 
a 40-foot boat. The names of the couple and their son, a resident of Long 
Beach, were not released. Coast Guard cutters were continuing the search on the 
possibility that the son also had been aboard. 
</P>
<P>
"There were thousands of little pieces of wreckage out there. It looked like 
someone had picked it up, chewed it up and spit it out," said Los Angeles 
County Lifeguard Lt. Paul McIlroy, who assisted in the search. McIlroy said 
there were no burn marks to indicate an explosion and nothing to indicate a 
collision. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real mystery," he said.

A 76-year-old Las Vegas retiree won $4.6 million on a dollar slot machine at 
the new Mirage resort just hours after its grand opening, a casino spokesman 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Elmer Sherwin won $4,653,697.80 on a Megabucks dollar slot machine at the 
lavish new hotel-casino about 9:15 p.m. Wednesday. The Mirage, the newest 
resort on the Strip, opened shortly after noon. 
</P>
<P>
Sherwin had been playing the machine for about 90 minutes and fed it about $100 
before hitting the jackpot, the spokesman said. Sherwin worked for General 
Electric in Cleveland before retiring and moving to Las Vegas about five years 
ago, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The check presentation is scheduled today at the hotel after state gaming 
officials verify the jackpot, which will be paid in annual installments over a 
20-year period. 
</P>
<P>
A Mirage spokesman claimed that the jackpot was the largest ever won at a slot 
machine in Las Vegas. A jackpot of about $6 million was won in Reno a few years 
ago, the Mirage spokesman said.

Americans Indians and their supporters gathered Thanksgiving morning on 
Alcatraz Island to commemorate the 20th anniversary of their occupation of "The 
Rock" in San Francisco Bay. Hundreds of people were ferried to the island for 
the sunrise ceremony, which has been held every year since 1975, said Tony 
Gonzales, director of the International Indian Treaty Council. "The first 
Thanksgiving happened in 1621," Gonzales said, "and the Indians sat at the same 
table with Pilgrims. Then in 1622, the Pilgrims organized raiding parties and 
slaughtered 600 Indians. Since that time, there hasn't been peace between 
Indians and whites," he said. "Our un-Thanksgiving dinner, bringing Indians and 
non-Indians together, is trying to change that."

SPAIN BECOMES CONDUIT FOR EUROPE'S COCAINE 
</P>

<P>
With Spain as their Continental base, Colombian drug lords have gone to sea to 
supply a rich new cocaine market in Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish and foreign enforcement officials believe that each week more than a 
ton of South American cocaine is shipped to Western Europe, most of it secreted 
in the avalanche of legitimate freight bound for European ports. 
</P>
<P>
"Increasingly, we get reliable reports of ships leaving South America with 
shipments, but they are hard to keep track of once they are at sea," said one 
officer who collects intelligence on the movement of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Freighters unload container cargo at nearly two dozen ports in Spain alone, 
where police made two-thirds of Europe's cocaine seizures last year. That is 
only the tip of the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
Booming Europe, riding the crest of unprecedented prosperity, lives on 
cross-border trade now and plans to eliminate all internal frontiers by the end 
of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The volume of sea trade is breathtaking. The Dutch port of Rotterdam, for 
example, handled more than 2 million containers last year. And in Europe, as in 
the United States, only about 5% of freight is physically inspected by customs 
agents. "To do much more would paralyze everything," said the officer. 
</P>
<P>
Although small shipments of cocaine reach Europe by commercial planes, or on 
speedboats that load from ships offshore, the new reliance on merchant ships is 
a function of geography and a hungry new market: Europe is too far from South 
America to allow smuggling by the light planes that litter American skies. 
Quickening European demand for cocaine has mushroomed beyond the capacity of 
small shipments to supply it, or of police to control it. 
</P>
<P>
"Even serious enforcement hasn't scared these people away. Spain is still the 
European headquarters for the Colombia cartel," said David G. Herrera, the Los 
Angeles native who heads the Madrid office of the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say Colombian drug families began targeting Europe in the early 
1980s, when it became clear to them that the U.S. market was becoming 
saturated. A kilo of cocaine that cost $68,000 wholesale in Los Angeles in 
1981, Herrera notes, is now $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Spain was the initial European cocaine target because of its historic links to 
Latin America, and a common language. Latin Americans, from students to 
tourists to drug dealers, tend to feel at home in Spain. And they can visit 
without visas. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors in 1984 included cocaine kingpins Jorge Luis Ochoa and Jose Mata, who 
apparently came to set up initial European networks. Spanish police arrested 
Ochoa at U.S. request, but a court ordered him extradited to Colombia, where he 
was soon released. He is now high on the Colombian government's most-wanted 
list. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, with Latin American couriers and salespeople now firmly 
established in almost all countries, in big cities and small, Europe is 
learning firsthand what cocaine costs. Seizures across Europe are 30 times 
higher than they were in 1980, according to Interpol, but are still modest by 
comparison to the United States, where recent seizures have been measured by 
the ton. 
</P>
<P>
Crack, for example, is still a stranger to Europe, but only because the street 
price is too high to make it profitable, specialists say. Increased supply is 
driving prices down, though, and police recently made Europe's first crack 
arrests in England's Jamaican community. 
</P>
<P>
In Spain, there is also nascent narco-violence. Customs inspector Luis Vidal 
Rocha became the first Spanish government fatality last summer when the boat he 
was chasing smugglers in crashed, and last month three explosions at Spanish 
government offices and near a consul's car in the Netherlands were thought to 
have been drug-related. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Spanish police seized 200 kilos of cocaine impregnated into a 
seaborne shipment of Peruvian ponchos. Earlier this year, they found 300 kilos 
in a shipment of 30,000 Colombian coconuts. Last year, seizures included a 
record 1,000 kilos that had been shipped to a port near the French border, and 
another 562 kilos in Barcelona. A kilo is 2.2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, heroin has been the drug of choice for European addicts, and the 
economic mainstay of criminal gangs that control it. Trade is still brisk. In 
another raid on a busy weekend, Spanish police seized 109 kilos of Turkish 
heroin in southern Spain and arrested two Turks and a British woman. There was 
speculation in the aftermath that the heroin might have been bound for the 
United States. Spain got 479 of the 3,100 kilos of heroin seized in Europe last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"Heroin has peaked here and in the rest of Europe. People know it kills, and 
they are afraid of AIDS. Use of cocaine, by contrast, is increasing quickly," 
said Miguel Solans, a 44-year-old attorney who is national coordinator of the 
Spanish government's quickening war against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Spanish police seized 114 kilos of cocaine. By 1985, the total was 303 
kilos, according to Solans. But shipments remained relatively small and 
airborne until recently: In 1987, a single seizure of 77 kilos was a landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, European police seized 5,500 kilos. Spanish authorities confiscated 
3,461 kilos of the total, more than half of it from ships' cargo. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Spain is joining with Italy and the United States to aid Colombia, Peru 
and Bolivia, the countries where cocaine is born. At the same time, Spanish, 
French and other European officials are seeking ways to short-circuit the 
laundering of drug money throughout Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
It is a familiar story, counted in the billions of dollars, specialists say. 
Amid an expanding flow, cocaine has already bought not only bulging bank 
accounts in big European countries and such close-mouthed enclaves as Andorra 
and Gibraltar, it has also financed major real estate and commercial 
investments in Spain's Costa del Sol and the French and Italian Rivieras.

Firefighters early Thanksgiving morning fought a huge blaze that raced through 
five Victorian homes condemned after the Oct. 17 earthquake, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Arson inspectors were investigating the fire, which began about 3:00 a.m. along 
a residential block in the Mission District and quickly spread, said Fire Chief 
Fred Postel. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the blaze, which was extinguished by 6 a.m., officials 
said. One of the stately but damaged homes collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. workers shut off electrical power to the 300 
block of Shotwell Street near 18th Street, where the fire raged. 
</P>
<P>
More than 140 firefighters using 26 pieces of equipment fought the flames and 
evacuated about 30 residents on the block behind the fire, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters had difficulty attacking the blaze in the cracked and teetering 
homes, which were condemned after the 7.1 magnitude Bay Area earthquake that 
killed at least 67 people. Unable to enter the homes that had slipped off their 
foundations, firefighters used cranes and other equipment to fight the fire 
from outside, Postel said. 
</P>
<P>
One week after the quake, neighbors along the block set up floodlights across 
the street on a warehouse balcony after two arson incidents did minor damage to 
one of the condemned buildings, Postel said. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night was the first night since the neighborhood watch began that the 
lights had been turned off, Postel said. Police had also been making frequent 
patrols of the block, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The lights went out and the fire started," said Postel. 
</P>

Smoke from the conflagration drifted over U.S. 101 as holiday traffic began to 
fill the lanes. Spectators held back by police barricades along Shotwell Street 
stood on side streets peering at the blaze.

LITTLE HARM TO S.D. SEEN IN MILITARY CUTS; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: IT IS AN EDUCATED GUESS AT THIS POINT, BUT LOCAL MILITARY AND BUSINESS 
OFFICIALS SAY PENTAGON CUTBACKS SHOULDN'T SERIOUSLY DAMAGE THE AREA'S DIVERSE 
ECONOMY.

<P>
It's too early for anything but speculation, but local military and business 
officials already are downplaying the potential effect on the San Diego economy 
of the Pentagon's proposed 3-year, $180-billion budget cut. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's economy is too diverse and the probable trickle-down effect too 
small for a budget cut even of the magnitude called for last weekend by Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney to make a serious dent locally, several observers said 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
And economists say there is little chance of a reprise of the early 1960s, when 
defense cuts along with General Dynamics' discontinuance of its Convair 
commercial airliners pitched San Diego into a severe recession marked, at its 
1964 nadir, by a 10% unemployment rate, a population decline and a dip in 
housing prices. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has not yet determined what programs or jobs will be cut, and its 
plans are always subject to intense political haggling and Congressional 
review. In light of that, local military and business officials were reluctant 
to speculate on how San Diego will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing concrete yet. This is so fresh that it literally came as a 
shock to the entire Defense Department," said Senior Chief Bob Howard, a 
spokesman for Naval Air Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet. Of the four military 
branches, the Navy by far has the strongest presence in San Diego. "Everyone 
has regrouped at this point. We're not willing to say what will happen because 
no one knows at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary indications are that the Navy is considering mothballing two or 
three of its 15 aircraft carriers and four World War II-era battleships, which 
have been overhauled and outfitted with modern weapons systems. That raises the 
possibility that one of the three carriers stationed in San Diego -- the 
Ranger, Independence and Constellation -- could be decommissioned. No 
battleships are currently ported in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the size of the carrier and whether an air wing is removed along 
with it, the removal of one carrier from San Diego could mean the loss of 5,000 
uniformed Navy personnel plus hundreds of civilian workers, Howard said. At the 
end of last year, there were 144,200 uniformed military personnel stationed in 
San Diego County, nearly all of whom were Navy. 
</P>
<P>
According to the budgetary rule of thumb applied by Max Schetter, director of 
economic research at Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce, about 1% of the 
spending cut could end up filtering down to San Diego. That would mean a 
$1.8-billion spending cut over the years 1992 to 1994, or $600 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Given that defense and military spending represented $9.7 billion or 20% of San 
Diego's 1988 gross regional product, the loss of $600 million per year in 
defense dollars would be a significant but not crushing loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Realistically, I don't see it as a severe impact to the regional economy" if 
the 1% rule holds up, Schetter said. About half of the $9.7 billion in defense 
spending here last year went for payroll and half for contracts for services 
and goods. 
</P>
<P>
Even under the worst scenario, few envision the defense cuts triggering the 
economic malaise seen in San Diego during the late 1950s and early 1960s. The 
local economy has expanded and matured dramatically since then, said Edward J. 
Neuner, professor emeritus of economics at San Diego State University, to 
include stronger tourism, construction and non-defense manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't have all the high technology that has emerged with (the growth of) 
UCSD as a scientific research center. You have broader based industrial 
production now." 
</P>
<P>
Schetter described the economy in the early 1960s as one being heavily 
dependent on defense that was "in between conflicts," referring to the Korean 
and Vietnam wars. "The (local economy) didn't fare too well in that kind of 
climate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1957, about 58,900 or 25% of the 233,000 jobs in San Diego County were in 
aerospace, most of those defense-related, said Jack Nowell, labor market 
analyst with the state Economic Development Dept. Now, aerospace jobs total 
only 26,400 jobs or 2.7% of the 965,000 total jobs in the county. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to uniformed military, there are 34,000 civilian employees of the 
military in San Diego County. Moreover, about 72,000 workers owe their jobs to 
locally based prime defense contracts, from ship repair at NASSCO to missile 
production at General Dynamics' Convair division. 
</P>
<P>
The reactions of several local defense contractors to the specter of budget 
cuts ranged from "wait and see" to optimism. A spokesman for Rohr Industries of 
Chula Vista, a manufacturer of jet components including engine pods and rings, 
said his company's "real strength" is now in commercial airliner parts. Rohr, 
which employs 6,700 workers in Chula Vista, sells 75% of its products to 
commercial customers and 25% to the military, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhat more dependent on the Pentagon is General Dynamics, which with 17,500 
employees is the city's largest industrial employer. More than 90% of its work 
is done on defense contracts, including the Tomahawk Cruise missile, automatic 
test equipment for military aircraft and Atlas missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Cubic Corp. spokesman Jerry Ringer said his company, whose defense contracts 
include military pilot training systems, hopes the Pentagon sees its contracts 
as "work that saves the government money." About 42% of Cubic's $350 million in 
revenue last year came from defense contracts. Cubic employs 3,800 in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the result of the upcoming budget cuts, it may take years for them to 
trickle down, said Raford Boddy, an economics professor at San Diego State 
University. The San Diego economy's boom of the last several years, in fact, is 
a "working off" defense dollars allocated to San Diego early on in the Reagan 
Administration, he said.

THESE TURKEYS DIDN'T STAY FOR DINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe the six wild turkeys that were found missing from a Northridge yard 
Thanksgiving morning knew that it was time to make themselves scarce. Or 
perhaps a holiday-minded thief couldn't resist the idea of a turkey-naping on 
Turkey Day. 
</P>
<P>
Police were unsure whether the birds, valued by owner Thomas Walsh at $50 
apiece, fled on their own or were the victims of fowl play. However they left, 
all that remained was a trail of feathers from the man's property to a nearby 
storm drain, Los Angeles Police Officer Richard Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was raising them, for what reason I don't know," Gray said. "They might 
have decided to leave because they knew what fate was in store for them." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh discovered that the birds were missing about 6 a.m. from his fenced-in 
back yard in the 8400 block of Wilbur Avenue, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh could not be reached for comment. A neighbor who lives two houses away 
said she was unaware that turkeys were being raised there. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm aware he had some chickens and some roosters because I hear them at 5 
o'clock in the morning," Leonora Sastre said. "But we never saw any turkeys."

EACH SIDE SAYS IT'S LOSING GROWTH BATTLE; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE BURBANK CITY COUNCIL HAS FASHIONED AN ORDINANCE TO IMPLEMENT 
MEASURE ONE. IT WOULD LIMIT SOME APARTMENT HOUSE HEIGHTS AND REQUIRE 
LANDSCAPING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Burbank homeowner groups are complaining that provisions of a controlled-growth 
ordinance under consideration by the City Council do not go far enough, but 
developers and real estate agents are saying they go too far. 
</P>
<P>
"The citizens feel betrayed," said Michael Scandiffio, director of the 
400-member Burbank Rancho Homeowners. "This council is not against growth. It's 
for the destruction of communities." 
</P>
<P>
But Mario Iacobellis, a real estate developer and president of the Burbank 
Board of Realtors, argued that provisions of the ordinance are too stringent 
and will cause rents to increase and property values to decrease. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a disaster," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Slowing growth in Burbank was the key issue in the city's February election. 
Former Mayor Al F. Dossin and former Councilwoman Mary E. Kelsey, both accused 
of favoring developers, were defeated in reelection bids. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Measure One was overwhelmingly approved by voters. The 
ordinance calls for the City Council to establish guidelines that would force 
developers to reduce the size of residential buildings and make them blend 
better with surroundings. It also calls for city officials to gauge what 
services would be needed to accommodate new apartments and condominiums and to 
charge developers fees to help pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
But critics say the development guidelines recommended by the city Planning 
Department and being considered by the council will not adequately protect 
single-family neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed guidelines include limiting the height of new apartment buildings 
to 23 feet if they are next to a single-family neighborhood. The same building 
would have to be set back the same distance from the street as adjacent houses; 
construction would be limited to 60% of a lot's area, and at least 25% of the 
lot would have to be landscaped. 
</P>
<P>
Restrictions also would be imposed on new apartments and condominiums inside 
areas zoned for large residential projects. For instance, the height of such 
buildings would be limited to 35 feet. Developers also would have to meet 
landscaping and security requirements, such as providing trees and planters 
outside buildings and installing deadbolt locks and burglar alarms. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they plan to approve final provisions of the ordinance on 
Dec. 19 to become effective in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
"What they've come up with are watered-down guidelines," Scandiffio said of the 
Planning Department recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
David Golonski, head of Enough is Enough, a slow-growth group, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The design guidelines, as far as I can tell, don't impose very many 
restrictions whatsoever," said Golonski, whose group has about 150 members. 
"It's just a tightening of codes. It's certainly not what the residents were 
asking for with Measure One. 
</P>
<P>
"Measure One, in the residents' mind, was a slow-growth initiative that was 
going to put a stop to the deterioration of the quality of life in Burbank. And 
design guidelines that have a small impact on buildings isn't how you do it." 
</P>
<P>
Golonski said the City Council should limit the number of building permits 
issued. He said the city also should tighten controls on commercial and 
industrial developments, which are not addressed in Measure One. 
</P>
<P>
Scandiffio said the Planning Department has failed to address the provision in 
Measure One that calls for the city to devise a way to charge developers for 
services necessitated by their projects -- including sewers, street 
improvements, fire and police protection and utilities. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Robert (Bud) Ovrom said the Planning Department is working on a 
fee schedule for additional services and utilities, but it will not be 
completed until early next year. Ovrom said the City Council can implement the 
ordinance by requiring developers to sign a blank check until the city can 
decide how much to assess. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard, who authored Measure One, said she prefers that 
the council require developers to obtain conditional-use permits until the fee 
schedule is determined. Such permits require public hearings at which residents 
can voice complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said she is confident that Measure One will work as intended. "I think 
it's going to reduce density tremendously by reducing the number of apartment 
units that are going to be built," she said. "There shouldn't be any doubts in 
anybody's mind." 
</P>
<P>
Some residents may have misinterpreted the ordinance, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some people thought that it was going to stop development," she said. 
"This was never intended to stop development. It will make it very difficult to 
develop. It will slow growth down, and it will create better projects." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Robert R. Bowne agreed and expressed frustration about residents' 
complaints that the Planning Department recommendations are not tough enough on 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what satisfies some of these people," Bowne said. "Some people 
want to impose such stringent standards that it's tantamount to a complete 
moratorium, and that's not even an option we've been working with. What we're 
trying to do is provide better projects and, in the process, reduce density." 
</P>
<P>
Burbank Senior Planner Roger Baker, like Howard, blamed some of the controversy 
on misinterpretation. Some newspapers, for example, have referred to Measure 
One as a slow-growth ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"This affects more the quality of development and our ability to accommodate 
development," Baker said. "It's more like managed growth." 
</P>
<P>
Another problem, he said, has been confusion over whether the ordinance calls 
for "development guidelines," which would be voluntary, or "development 
standards," which would be mandatory. The two terms have been used 
interchangeably by residents, city officials and in city documents. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said it is up to the council to determine how the ordinance is 
implemented. But he added: "The consensus has been that these will be 
development standards." 
</P>
<P>
Scandiffio and Golonski said their homeowner groups will consider drafting a 
Measure Two if members think Measure One does not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
To put a measure on the ballot, residents would have to collect the signatures 
of 15% of the 43,215 registered voters in Burbank. Also, the wording of a 
proposed ordinance would have to be approved by City Attorney Juli C. Scott. 
The City Council then would vote on when the proposed ordinance would be put on 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that residents are demanding more say about development in 
Burbank, Scandiffio said. 
</P>
<P>
"The people on this City Council said they were for slow-growth and they turned 
out not to be," he said. "This council is more pro-development than the last." 
</P>
<P>
The previous City Council was harshly criticized for its approval of several 
large developments, including a 129-house tract on an undeveloped hillside. 
Many of the projects are in or around residential areas dominated by 
single-family houses, and density restrictions for some properties were 
loosened to accommodate the developments. 
</P>
<P>
Critics complained that residential development in the city was out of control. 
</P>
<P>
An average of 186 residential units -- apartments, condominiums and 
single-family houses -- were built annually in Burbank from 1974 to 1985. But 
the rate rose dramatically in 1986, when 1,819 residential units were 
constructed. In 1987, 1,117 units were built, and planning officials say 1,316 
were built in 1988. About 1,000 units were granted permits through July, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Developers and real estate agents admit that some controls on development are 
needed but contend that the provisions under consideration by the council are 
too stringent. 
</P>
<P>
Iacobellis, of the Burbank Board of Realtors, predicted that the provisions 
would cause rents to increase 25% to 40% and would prevent some blighted areas 
from being redeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
"The council does not understand the implications of Measure One because they 
are not business people," Iacobellis said. "It's too stringent. The city 
already has enough power to restrict projects." 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Corradi, president of the Burbank Chamber of Commerce, said the 
ordinance would reduce property values by limiting the amount of space on which 
a developer can build. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of older people who had planned to sell their property to have 
something to retire on," Corradi said. Councilman Michael Hastings said some 
neighborhoods are in need of redevelopment and that he favors including 
language in the ordinance to exempt them from Measure One. Hastings said the 
council also should consider making allowances for small property owners who 
may be hurt by Measure One. 
</P>
<P>
"As much as I advocate slow growth, I have to represent those people too," 
Hastings said, adding: "If we're overly restrictive, there are going to be a 
lot of losers." 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Tim Murphy said the council should implement the ordinance 
without making exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that some people are going to be hurt, but that's the way 
these kinds of things happen," Murphy said. "For years, the developers raped 
and pillaged the land, and now we have to be prepared to respond to the damage 
that's already been done."

HOTEL LA PALMA;

<P>
HAPPY ENDINGS: A GROUP OF DAY LABORERS HAS REASON TO CELEBRATE THANKSGIVING 
WHEN A GOOD SAMARITAN ARRIVES WITH A HOLIDAY MEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Thanksgiving Day began inauspiciously for the men of "Hotel La Palma," the day 
laborer camp under a palm tree on the concrete bed of the Los Angeles River in 
Canoga Park. But in the end they got their turkey dinner. 
</P>
<P>
By 7 a.m., the 40 to 50 Mexican men who live at La Palma had rolled out of 
their one tent and the nylon covers that shelter many of them at night and were 
on nearby street corners, looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
As they had expected, hardly anyone wanted day laborers on a holiday. By 10 
a.m., about a dozen had made their way back to the camp and prepared to pick up 
a turkey they thought was waiting for them at El Centro de Guadalupe church on 
Hart Street a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
Five of them -- the man nicknamed "Camel" and Lino Flores and three others -- 
volunteered for the bird hunt. 
</P>
<P>
The night before, Rodrigo Urquiza had been in charge of fetching dinner. Those 
who had worked that day chipped in $2 or $3 each. Anastasio had been working 
for three straight weeks at a construction site, so he was gently embarrassed 
into contributing $5. The other half of the commune was broke, but they would 
not go hungry. Anastasio returned with a chicken, potatoes, onions, tortillas, 
cilantro, tomatoes and lemons. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting tacos were delicious. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, however, the turkey seemed to be on everbody's mind. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," confided Hernan, one of several campers who did not want their full 
names revealed, "back home we're not really into turkey. They really don't have 
much taste, but when they want to give us something, that's great, bring it 
over." 
</P>
<P>
Flores and the rest came back from the church empty-handed. All the turkeys had 
been given away Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to save the food baskets for needy families," explained Gabriel 
Hernandez, who runs the church's holiday food distribution program. "For single 
men, we're serving food right here". 
</P>
<P>
The campers reasoned they had misunderstood the invitation, given them by two 
police officers who dropped by La Palma the day before. They sat resignedly at 
a table and picked at Thanksgiving food without enthusiasm. "It's not the same" 
without the others, mourned "Camel," the soft-spoken construction worker who 
many recognize as the commune's leader. His long nose, strong jaw and cool 
demeanor earned him the nickname. 
</P>
<P>
"We're like a family, and we like to hang out. We're in peace by the river and 
we don't bother anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Fermin Correa picked two girls' dresses and a baby's overalls from the pile of 
free clothing outside the church dinning room. "For my relatives in Zacatecas," 
he said as he thanked Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for home, they greeted Paul Bernal and John Walker, the two 
police officers who had mentioned the church's free turkey the day before. 
</P>
<P>
"For the most part these are hard-working men," said Bernal, as he waved 
goodby. "They've even helped us solve a couple of crimes." 
</P>
<P>
Bernal and Walker were assigned last month to the "Centro Amistad" a city- and 
county-sponsored community center aimed at improving relations with the Latino 
community, Bernal said. Through the center, they hope to find the campers a 
better home. 
</P>
<P>
"We've received some complaints and they will have to leave the riverbed, but 
we won't do anything until we find them a place to live," Bernal said. 
</P>
<P>
Back in La Palma, there were more than 20 men waiting for dinner. Camel and the 
others told them about the turkey mix-up and Bernal's search for a roof for 
them to live under. 
</P>
<P>
Some liked the idea, but many others did not. At La Palma they sleep on wooden 
pallets to avoid getting wet when the river rises. When it rains, said young 
Lorenzo Magallanes, "We don't have to take a bath." 
</P>
<P>
When it's cold, they go to the Salvation Army shelter in Canoga Park. When 
police drop in, they say hello. When the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service stops by, they say, about half of them -- the ones without green cards 
-- run. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to stay together," said Miguel Alvarez, 45, as they sat in circles on 
upended paint buckets. "It would be nice to have a place, and we could even 
pitch in a little for rent as we do with the food. But the apartments would 
have to be nearby, so we can see each other and be together. Besides, who's 
going to rent an apartment to five Mexican men?" 
</P>
<P>
No one seemed too interested in talking about moving. 
</P>
<P>
"So what happened to the turkey?" asked Magallanes in Spanish, the only 
language spoken at the camp. "Let's go buy one for the tacos tonight." Some 
pitched in $2, others $3. 
</P>
<P>
Juan passed the hat around a group that was singing ranchera songs to the music 
of an old guitar, collecting cash for beer. 
</P>
<P>
Magallanes came back with a bag of food, but no turkey. "The bird cost $29 and 
something and I only had $27 and something, so I brought some beef," he kept 
apologizing to anybody who would listen. Alvarez said he preferred red meat 
anyway. The rest nodded in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Juan tried to break a 4-by-4 to start a fire. Some brought scavenged aluminum 
cans and tossed them into plastic bags. "If you don't find work, you go out 
looking for cans," said Camel. "Or firewood. Everybody helps." 
</P>
<P>
The camp has been in place for at least two years, said Lino Flores. The faces 
change. During the summer, the camp gets smaller as workers follow the harvest. 
In December, those who do well return to Mexico for the Christmas fiestas. 
</P>
<P>
They talked about Pancho Villa's heroics and his encounter with Emiliano 
Zapata. They talked about their hometowns and their families. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly someone shouted "here comes the turkey!" and all heads turned toward 
the river bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Making his way down the Hotel La Palma entrance -- a narrow opening by the 
railroad bridge in the fence enclosing the riverbed -- was Richard Osborne from 
the Valley Vineyard Christian Fellowship. He was carrying a pile of plastic 
dishes loaded with food that his wife, Joan, had passed to him over the fence. 
</P>
<P>
They recognized him in a second. He's the guy, they said, who hands out ham 
sandwiches to the day workers on nearby Vanowen Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Buenos dias," said Osborne in halting Spanish. He passed around dishes. No one 
refused. Each got a turkey sandwich and a serving of stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez stepped forward. "Thank you, thank you very much. Like you, we are all 
sons of our Lord Jesus Christ." 
</P>
<P>
Osborne had trouble understanding the greeting, but when he did, a big smile 
lit his face. He noticed he was three dishes short, so he rushed back to his 
wife. When he returned, he was smiling again. "Tres mas," he said, as he looked 
for the men without plates. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, how about that," said Magallanes with a grin as he watched Osborne 
leave. "We ended up eating our turkey after all. I guess miracles do exist." 
</P>
<P>

WILMINGTON ACTIVISTS GET HALF A LOAF ON HARBOR PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
RENEWAL: LOS ANGELES HARBOR COMMISSIONERS EXPAND THE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREA 
ON THE WATERFRONT. THE OLD HEINZ CANNERY SITE WASN'T INCLUDED, DESPITE PLEAS BY 
COMMUNITY GROUPS.

<P>
Wilmington community activists, who have been pressing the Harbor Department to 
expand a waterfront area set aside for redevelopment, got half of what they 
wanted from harbor commissioners Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners voted to expand the project area by eight to 10 acres but did 
not include the former Heinz Pet Food Cannery building. 
</P>
<P>
"They did exactly what we anticipated they would do," said George De La Torre, 
chairman of the Wilmington Community Citizens Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The original project area included a 29-acre parcel with a small amount of 
waterfront area at the foot of Avalon Boulevard. Community activists and Los 
Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores have proposed redeveloping the area 
as a commercial and tourist center that they hope will have the cachet of Ports 
O' Call in neighboring San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the commissioners added waterfront property now occupied by the 
Catalina Freight Co. terminal, a 2.3-acre container storage yard owned by the 
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the facilities of the College of 
Oceaneering, a school for underwater welding. 
</P>
<P>
No specific use for land in the expanded project area has been determined, 
although a consulting firm is working on a feasibility study. Some potential 
uses include restaurants, commercial buildings, retail shops and parkland. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to expanding the area being studied, the commissioners decided to 
consider two alternates for routing Southern Pacific rail lines and automotive 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
One proposal would extend Alameda Street, which now ends at B Street, on a 
diagonal through the waterfront area. An existing rail line would parallel the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
The other proposal, favored by Wilmington activists, would reroute the rail 
line away from the waterfront area. Alameda Street would not be extended, but 
improvements would be made to B Street and Fries Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The first route, said De La Torre, "would virtually be a death blow, because I 
don't see how a developer would want to go in there and do any kind of project 
where you would have traffic and pollution and noise." 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, De La Torre requested that the commission include the cannery 
in the project, but no action was taken. 
</P>
<P>
Community proposals to renovate the cannery for commercial uses have been 
resisted by port officials, who want to tear down the building and use the land 
as a storage area for heavy machinery. 
</P>
<P>
But the demolition plans were dealt a setback Nov. 15 when the Los Angeles 
Cultural Heritage Commission designated the building a historical monument, an 
interim move that prevents demolition. 
</P>
<P>
If the City Council ratifies the historical designation, any new use of the 
cannery would have to be approved by the council, according to Ann D'Amato, 
Flores' deputy for the harbor area. 
</P>
<P>
D'Amato said the council is expected to take up the issue within six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
De La Torre said harbor officials would prefer "to take a few pictures and put 
a plaque somewhere and say this is the way it used to be. . . . Our request is 
that if it is declared a historical monument, it be included" in the project.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN DIES IN CRASH NORTH OF NEWHALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Green Valley man was the first traffic fatality of the Thanksgiving weekend 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Klemm, 57, lost control of his Datsun on Bouquet Canyon Road north of 
Newhall shortly after midnight Thursday and plowed into a rocky hillside, said 
Officer Monty Keifer of the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Klemm died at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital about 2 p.m., Keifer said. 
</P>
<P>
Klemm was not wearing a seat belt at the time of the accident and appeared to 
have been drinking, according to the CHP report. 
</P>
<P>
The day before the accident was Klemm's birthday, officers said.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MARSH SIGNAL, CROSSWALK PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A traffic signal and crosswalk will be installed on the north side of Madrona 
Marsh as a first step toward making the marsh more accessible. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance City Council members voted 5 to 2 Tuesday, with Councilmen Bill 
Applegate and Dan Walker dissenting, to spend $30,000 for a crosswalk on Plaza 
del Amo. It will be located between Maple and Madrona avenues. 
</P>
<P>
The city hopes to find money to build an interpretive center and parking lot on 
a triangular piece of city-owned land next to the marsh. 
</P>
<P>
Applegate and Walker argued that a crosswalk in the middle of a block would be 
unsafe and asked the council to put off the decision until funding is available 
for the interpretive center. At that time, they said, money might also be 
available for a pedestrian overpass, which would cost between $300,000 and 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Council members also approved spending $121,000 to install a 7 1/2-foot-high 
steel fence around the marsh.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / S. J. DIAMOND: MATTRESS PRICING BOUNCES BUYERS AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's something very odd about the mattress business, and it's not just the 
fact that mattresses are always on sale. (Has anyone ever bought a mattress at 
regular price?) It's also the number of seemingly different models. In the 
Sealy Posturepedic line alone, one can have a Posturepedic Constitution, 
Grandeur Autograph, Palatial, Anniversary, Maxima, Crown Jewel or Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
Can there really be that many choices? No, just different names for the same 
thing, thanks to an industry tradition of giving some retail stores exclusive 
names for the mattress models they carry. What one store calls the Constitution 
is the Anniversary at another store. One store's Palatial is another's Crown 
Jewel. The Grandeur Autograph is the Maxima. 
</P>
<P>
The effect on the consumer is obvious. Who knows whether a Spring Air Back 
Supporter Societe on sale for $152 at Bullock's in Los Angeles is a good deal 
when one can't find it elsewhere? And it takes some sleuthing to find out that 
it's the same as the Heritage 2000 about to go on sale at the nearby Robinson's 
for the same $152, and for $128 at a one-day sale at May Co. "That's the 
point," says a May Co. salesman. "It makes comparison shopping impossible." And 
that in turn, says Maryland's assistant attorney general, Jim Abbott, has "a 
serious adverse impact on the marketplace because it makes it difficult for 
price competition to take place." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the name gambit got started as a way to defeat price competition. Some 
say it started when manufacturers could no longer set retail prices, and 
mattresses began to be discounted. Some say it goes back to specific trade wars 
a decade ago among the various local factories licensed to make Sealy 
mattresses, when several different licensees would be competing in the same 
market. Some sold to discounters, and retailers, "in order not to be 
embarrassed, asked for exclusive covers and exclusive labels," says Roy Unger, 
president of Serta mattress in Des Plaines, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
"The product lends itself to this because it's difficult for the consumer to 
differentiate one from another," says Nancy Butler at the Better Sleep Council, 
an industry-supported organization in Alexandria, Va. The differences between 
one store's model and another's are generally minor -- a different choice of 
insulating material or upholstery or quilting, or just a different cover fabric 
or name. And it's the last difference that means nobody has to compete on 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Not that they don't, in their way. Mattress prices bounce around something 
fierce. That Spring Air Back Supporter Heritage 2000 had four different prices 
in a week at May Co. California stores, sales-priced at $128 each twin piece on 
Nov. 18, up to $199 per piece on Nov. 20, down to $158 on Nov. 24, with another 
10% off ($142.20) for some unexplained reason. 
</P>
<P>
This up-down pricing has gotten the mattress industry in some trouble recently, 
particularly for the retail advertising of phony "sale" prices, in which a 
store competes with its own "regular" prices rather than with another store's 
prices. Maryland's attorney general, for one, filed actions against several 
retailers, including Woodward &amp; Lothrop, Hecht's, and Montgomery Ward, for 
"using as comparatives 'regular' prices that were deceptive and misleading," 
says Jim Abbott, "because they were not prices at which the goods were ever 
sold." 
</P>
<P>
As for the multiple names, which inhibit price competition among stores, 
"there's no statute that says (the same mattresses) have to have the same 
names," says Herschel Elkins, an assistant attorney general in California. "The 
obvious purpose is to confuse, but it's not a violation of anything." 
</P>
<P>
One would think the combination of different names and constant price changes 
would make the process of choosing a mattress hard for the consumer, but the 
industry seems to believe that they've never had it so good. The mattresses 
themselves, says Unger, are a better value, more supportive, more comfortable, 
built to last. 
</P>
<P>
The industry also seems to feel that the consumer, undistracted by price 
comparisons, can focus on more important considerations -- the store, the 
brand, and the feel of the mattress. Consumers shouldn't go from store to 
store, "getting involved in what I call nuts and bolts," says Gary Pleasant, 
vice president of sales for Sealy Mattress Co. in Cleveland. "They shouldn't be 
concerned about how it's made as long as it's a reputable store and a reputable 
product and it's comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough for an industry that doesn't want prices discussed or compared, 
price -- and always sale price -- is the only thing advertised, because the 
industry knows that price is what sells mattresses. "The first thing people say 
they want is comfort and support," says Pleasant, "but when someone advertises, 
'We have comfortable mattresses that support your body,' nobody comes in." So 
the industry keeps advertising sales, and consumers "see so many sale ads," 
says Unger, "that they want to be sure they're getting a good value." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard work, but it can be done, and with help from unusual sources. Calling 
the local number of major mattress companies will often get one a customer 
service representative who will provide matching model names for a whole area. 
Sometimes the caller has to guess, but a stack of recent ads provides all the 
possible equivalents. 
</P>
<P>
One can even get such information from retailers, particularly discounters. 
When asked the price of Serta's Perfect Sleeper Legato, Dial-A-Bed, a national 
discount distributor, immediately provided a list of counterparts (Perfect 
Sleeper Bronze Medallion, Supreme, Paragon and Emerald), all $299 per set, with 
free delivery. Retail stores doubtless have such information as well, says 
Abbott, and consumers "ought to put salespeople on notice that they know there 
are comparable models and they want to know which. And if the retailer is 
unwilling to tell them, they should leave."

GOURMET COFFEE SALES PERKING UP;

FOOD: AS POPULARITY BOOMS, THE INDUSTRY WORRIES THAT INFERIOR BEANS ARE 
SOMETIMES PASSED OFF AS EXOTIC BLENDS.

Any coffee brew just won't do for Jim Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
Fill his cup with freshly ground Guatemala Antigua, a full-flavored coffee made 
of choice arabica beans grown at altitudes of 5,000 feet and above. "It has a 
high degree of acidity, a spicy character and chocolaty overtones." 
</P>
<P>
Spoken like a coffee connoisseur and the general manager of Peet's, a San 
Francisco Bay Area chain of gourmet coffee shops, where a pound of 
Hawaiian-grown Kona coffee sells for $10.95. 
</P>
<P>
As have many in his specialized industry, Reynolds has profited handsomely from 
consumers' growing taste for pricey gourmet coffee. But the fast-paced growth 
has met with mixed feelings in the gourmet coffee set, who worry about inferior 
beans being passed off as exotic blends and by the entry of mass-market 
roasters. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with the tremendous growth is that you have a lot of marginal 
people who are coming in," said Larry Emerine, owner of Euro Coffee, a Los 
Angeles gourmet coffee roaster and retailer. "There is a lot of coffee being 
sold as gourmet that is not gourmet." 
</P>
<P>
For those who buy coffee that's on sale, such concerns might seem like a 
tempest in a coffeepot. But purveyors of high quality coffee fear that they 
will lose business if consumers pay hefty prices for lower grade coffee 
disguised as gourmet. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern as specialty coffee makers is that there will always be people who 
try to make a gimmick or a mockery of the program," said Steve Schulman, 
founder of Hillside Coffee, which distributes whole bean coffees. 
</P>
<P>
Worries about bogus gourmet coffee have not hurt sales. Sales have grown at 
about 25% annually and gourmet coffees now claim about 10% of the estimated $6 
billion in yearly coffee sales, according to FIND/SVP, a New York-based 
marketing research firm. Meanwhile, overall coffee sales have remained 
virtually flat. 
</P>
<P>
Gourmet coffee has won over many converts. 
</P>
<P>
Karyen Sanders, 41, of Pasadena cannot remember the last time she purchased a 
national brand. "It just seems fresher tasting, and I like grinding my own 
beans," said Sanders, who purchased two 1-pound bags of Hillside's house blend 
for more than $5 each -- about $2 more than the major brands. 
</P>
<P>
"This growth demonstrates consumers are willing to pay more to get a better cup 
of coffee," said Steven Gregg, director of marketing services for the Coffee 
Development Group of Washington, a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
In the supermarket aisles, the coffee giants, often derided for bland tasting 
products, have gone gourmet. This month, Procter &amp; Gamble rolled out its 
Folgers Gourmet Supreme, and General Foods USA recently introduced a whole bean 
version of Yuban. Even supermarkets are getting into the act: Vons is stocking 
its own gourmet Royal Request brand. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies are marketing so-called "premium coffees." Maxwell House, also 
owned by General Foods, has introduced two "premium" varieties called Rich 
French Roast and Colombian Supreme, made from a combination of pricey beans. 
</P>
<P>
But General Foods stops short of calling the two coffee varieties gourmet. 
"They are not gourmet coffee," said company spokesman Ken Defrens. 
</P>
<P>
Most coffee experts agree that gourmet coffee must contain arabica beans, 
prized for their flavor. In contrast, most coffee is made with robusta beans, 
which are less tasty than arabicas but more hardy and less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
But there are different varieties of arabica, and they are often blended with 
robusta. Complicating matters is a lack of government or industry standards 
defining gourmet coffee. 
</P>
<P>
And there are instances of outright dishonesty. Emerine recalls a company 
trying to pass off dark-roasted, low-grade beans as choice arabicas. "Once it's 
roasted, it's brown and who knows" the difference, he recalls the roaster 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a potential for abuses of the term 'gourmet' and the premiums that 
are paid for it," said Gregg at the Coffee Development Group. 
</P>
<P>
Gourmet coffee makers are also skeptical whether the giant coffee roasters are 
geared to produce and distribute high-quality gourmet products on a national 
basis. The specialty coffee makers point out that Maxwell House introduced a 
line of whole-bean coffees, Private Collection, a few years ago that has failed 
to win over many consumers. 
</P>
<P>
While Private Collection is not distributed nationally and receives little 
promotion, Defrens at Maxwell House said the brand is not a flop. "It's a 
relatively small business, but it's a vibrant business." 
</P>
<P>
And the big roasters defend their ability to produce gourmet brews. "We feel 
confident that we can produce a gourmet coffee product that consumers can enjoy 
can-after-can regardless of our size," said Procter &amp; Gamble spokeswoman 
Wendy Jacques. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their disdain for the national brands, gourmet coffee makers don't 
expect to win everybody over to their side. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people who wander into our stores and wonder what all the fuss is 
about," said Reynolds. "Then they go back to what they were drinking."

IBM TARGETS AD FIRMS TO PITCH NEW TECHNOLOGY; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: THE PUSH IS PART OF A LARGER CAMPAIGN TO GO AFTER SMALL BUSINESSES 
AND LESSEN APPLE COMPUTER'S DOMINANCE IN DESKTOP PUBLISHING. 
</P>

<P>
It's not exactly a computer manufacturer's dream market: a bunch of 
artistically inclined users who cringe at the thought of having to learn 
computer operating instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Yet mighty International Business Machines has launched an all-out campaign to 
woo a group of creative types decidedly more finicky than back-office bean 
counters. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with new software technology that it is heavily promoting, the Armonk, 
N.Y., company is zeroing in on advertising agency creative departments -- a 
market now dominated by Apple Computer. While these art directors, designers 
and copywriters constitute a small part of the desktop publishing population, 
they nonetheless present a formidable proving ground: an eclectic group hungry 
for new visual tools, whose passions tend to set design and style trends 
watched closely by other industries. 
</P>
<P>
IBM's new push pits its enormous resources against those of its smaller but 
feisty competitor, Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple, with its widely popular 
Macintosh that is by far the machine of choice in ad agency creative 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, at Zam &amp; Kirshner &amp; Geller Inc., a small Garden City, 
N.Y., agency that owns two Apple Macintoshes, creative employees use the 
computers to dream up copy, design typography for headlines, develop rough 
layouts and send copy through phone transmissions to advertisers for approval. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're talking about computers in the creative arena, there isn't much of a 
contest. It's all Apple, just about," said Tom Phelan, staff executive at the 
American Assn. of Advertising Agencies, an industry group representing roughly 
770 agencies. 
</P>
<P>
IBM's ad agency drive is part of a larger marketing campaign due to break early 
next year that also targets small businesses, such as commercial printers and 
civic associations, that may not already own desktop publishing computers. 
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate this to become a big part of company revenues," said Kim 
Johnson, IBM's manager for new business for media. "It's the fastest-growing 
area for computer resources today." 
</P>
<P>
In making its personal computers appealing to advertising creative departments, 
IBM has increasingly been relying on Microsoft's OS/2 operating system, which 
allows its PCs to perform a wide variety of graphic functions. OS/2 is the 
basic software driving IBM's most powerful personal computers and IBM 
compatibles. 
</P>
<P>
IBM hopes to use OS/2 on most of its personal computers, replacing the MS-DOS 
software that some users regard as more difficult to learn. Yet to date, sales 
of OS/2 have been languishing -- only 180,000 copies have been sold since it 
became available 2 1/2 years ago, according to Dataquest Inc., a market 
research company in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
In a bid to bolster OS/2 sales, IBM and Microsoft last week announced several 
measures to make the software available on a wider range of computers. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the MS-DOS software, the Mac-like OS/2 operating system makes it 
possible for users to choose from different edit and design options simply by 
moving the cursor onto any one of several easily recognizable images: For 
example, choosing an image of a garbage pail allows the user to delete a file. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics say that text display, manipulation and printing on the OS/2 
operating system is inferior to that of the Macintosh. 
</P>
<P>
Apple's popularity, however, isn't deterring IBM. Next year it will conduct a 
direct-mail and telemarketing campaign aimed at businesses with 50 or fewer 
employees -- including small agencies, design firms, churches and civic 
associations. A planned ad campaign could begin as early as next month in 
publications such as Adweek, Advertising Age and Marketing &amp; Media 
Decisions magazine. Big Blue will also try to attract new customers by holding 
seminars on new technology. 
</P>
<P>
The $60-billion company continues to spend more in advertising than the 
much-smaller Apple, which had roughly $4 billion in revenue in 1989. 
LNA-Arbitron, an industry research group, reports that IBM spent $36 million 
last year advertising its PS/2 computer, the personal computer on which the 
OS/2 operates, topping Apple's spending for the Macintosh by about $5 million. 
In the first half of 1989, IBM spent $8.9 million for its PS/2, compared to 
roughly half that amount spent for the Mac. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, IBM has forged what it terms "business partnerships" with software 
companies in an attempt to get them to unify their offerings and custom-tailor 
software to the needs of specific industries. 
</P>
<P>
IBM's approach contrasts with Apple's focus of spectacular ad campaigns on 
widely watched television programing such as the Super Bowl, which attract 
general audiences instead of specific industry markets. 
</P>
<P>
There are several reasons for this. Big Blue has been trying to shed its image 
as the Big Brother of technology, exploited by Apple's "1984" television 
commercial introducing the Macintosh. Super Bowl audiences five years ago 
watched a lithe runner hurl a hammer through the image of a dictator on a giant 
TV screen -- apparently symbolizing Apple's liberation of the masses from the 
Orwellian enslavement of hard-to-learn technology. 
</P>
<P>
There are some who do not think IBM's image has changed much since. 
</P>
<P>
"Buying desktop publishing from IBM is sort of like buying skis from an 
Egyptian company," said Steve Hayden, executive creative director at BBDO-Los 
Angeles, who coordinates computer purchasing for the agency's New York office 
as well. Both are heavily dependent on Macs. "IBM may have the concept, but 
they don't have the execution." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, analysts say, IBM has had a hard time getting software developers 
to create applications that work well together. The differences can be 
confusing to users. 
</P>
<P>
"IBM's problem is that it has so many products that have such a hard time 
working with each other it is forced to spend most of its time working with 
customers' problems," said Francis McInerney, an analyst at Northern Business 
Information-Datapro, a New York-based industry research firm. "IBM has to live 
with a flawed technology base." 
</P>
<P>
Besides delays in launching the much ballyhooed OS/2 operating system and the 
software to go with it, the biggest stumbling block to getting people to scrap 
their Apples seems to be the enormous popularity of the Macintosh brand name -- 
which since its introduction in 1984 has become synonymous with desktop 
publishing. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement announced last week between IBM and Microsoft is intended to make 
OS/2 available on a wider range of computers. The companies last Monday said 
they are currently developing a new version of OS/2 that would run on cheaper, 
low-end machines with only two megabytes of internal memory. Current OS/2 
versions aren't recommended for use in computers with less than four megabytes 
of memory. 
</P>
<P>
While Apple denies that heated rivalry is the reason, observers say that an 
unusually aggressive marketing campaign is perhaps the best indication that 
Apple takes IBM's threat seriously. Reviving and strengthening a concept that 
has been dormant two years, Apple this fall is letting prospective customers 
"test drive" a Macintosh and, if not satisfied, return it by mid-January. Two 
years ago, the trial period was much shorter.

JAPANESE BUILDING FIRMS, U.S. SETTLE BID-RIGGING CASE

A group of Japanese construction firms has agreed to pay the U.S. government 
$32.6 million to settle a dispute over alleged bid-rigging of projects at an 
American military base near Tokyo, U.S. officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side had threatened lawsuits both in Japan and the United States 
unless a settlement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from seven Japanese construction firms and American officials 
signed the memorandum of intent on behalf of 99 Japanese firms, the U.S. 
Justice Department said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The memorandum stipulates that the payment be made by Dec. 20, according to the 
statement, which was released by the U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Japanese companies involved in negotiations were not 
available for comment because of a national holiday in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government alleges that 140 Japanese construction and related firms 
were involved in the bid rigging and the statement said the Justice Department 
would continue to seek damages from the 41 not covered by the memorandum. 
</P>
<P>
Some executives among the 41 firms have said they should not have to pay 
compensation since they did not bid on the disputed sections of the project. 
The 41 firms are expected to hold separate talks with the U.S. side. 
</P>
<P>
In the negotiations, the U.S. side demanded a total of $34.8 million in 
compensation from the 140 firms, which participated in construction projects at 
the U.S. Navy base at Yokosuka, southwest of Tokyo, between April, 1984, and 
September, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
During the period, the U.S. Navy awarded 140 firms a combined total of $134.9 
million worth of orders, including construction of a housing complex for 
military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side claimed that there were improper charges and bid-rigging in 
connection with the construction at the base. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Japan's Fair Trade Commission issued warnings to 140 Japanese 
firms for their alleged prior consultations, or "dango," in setting prices of 
projects undertaken at the base. The commission levied a collective fine of 
about $2 million (289 million yen) on 70 companies in the cartel. The 
Construction Ministry also imposed sanctions, suspending the rights of 104 of 
the companies to bid on public works contracts for one to two months. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, critics in the U.S. construction industry dismissed the penalties 
as insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
The dango system, long established in Japan's construction industry, is 
considered an anti-competitive practice that prevents firms outside the group, 
including foreign firms, from getting contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Major firms such as Taisei Corp., Shimizu Corp. and Sumitomo Construction Co. 
were among the companies that banded together in the mid-1980s as the "U.S. 
Military Construction Safety and Technology Assn." in Yokosuka. 
</P>
<P>
The association, which nicknamed itself the "Friends of the Stars" -- a 
reference to the American flag -- became a forum for fixing prices and 
assigning contracts under the guise of competitive bidding, according to 
Japan's Fair Trade Commission.

'LIAR'S POKER' PROVING TO BE ONE HOT COMMODITY ON WALL STREET; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES: A NEW BOOK RIDICULES TRADING PRACTICES AT SALOMON BROS. A SPOKESMAN 
FOR THE FIRM CALLS IT 'AN AMUSING CARICATURE.'

<P>
Before closing the 1980s annals of excess, add a book by a somewhat 
directionless 1982 art history graduate from Princeton who ended up working for 
Salomon Bros. and who makes the bond-trading business look like a cross between 
"Animal House" and Greed Inc. 
</P>
<P>
He describes his own voyage from lowly "geek" to venerated king of the trading 
jungle, a perilous journey during which he avoided death in the form of flying 
telephones on the trading floor and a fate worse than death: selling equities 
in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
The author is Michael Lewis, age 28 and now retired from the world of finance, 
and the book is "Liar's Poker," which has become harder to get hold of on Wall 
Street than a hot stock. Lewis, who has the well-scrubbed appearance of a 
choirboy and the Louisiana drawl of a good ol' boy, seems an unlikely candidate 
to blow the whistle on Wall Street practices. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street is taking it in stride. A Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. trader says he 
bought and read the book the first day it was in the stores, before going to 
the office. He soon found himself on a business trip seated between two Morgan 
Stanley Inc. partners who were reading the book and laughing out loud. A former 
Salomon Bros. employee is annotating his copy, supplying real names for the 
handful of pseudonyms used and adding details to stories. 
</P>
<P>
The book's title comes from a game played by as few as two people and as many 
as 10. Each player holds a dollar bill and uses the serial number as his 
"hand." Each then bids and attempts to fool the others about his serial number. 
The spirit of the game is similar to the card game "I Doubt It," a test of 
luck, bluff and the ability to size up your opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Traders view the game as a test of their cunning and risk-taking acumen. For 
that reason, Salomon Chairman John Gutfreund was constantly matching himself 
against the firm's master of the game, John W. Meriwether. 
</P>
<P>
So this is the story that sets the tone for the book. He writes: "The code of 
the Liar's Poker player was something like the code of the gunslinger. It 
required a trader to accept all challengers." One day Gutfreund walked over to 
Meriwether's desk and said: "One hand, 1 million dollars, no tears." 
</P>
<P>
Meriwether replied: "No, John, if we're going to play for those kind of 
numbers, I'd rather play for real money. Ten million dollars. No tears." Was 
Meriwether bluffing, or was Gutfreund? Gutfreund could afford such a wager, 
having made about $40 million when Salomon Bros. was sold to Phibro Energy Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Gutfreund reportedly thought it over, then declined, saying: "You're crazy." 
The chairman slunk away in ignominious defeat. 
</P>
<P>
The mere possibility of such a wager, according to Lewis, was a symptom of the 
madness of a Wall Street trading room where multimillion-dollar gambles were 
taken all the time -- though usually with other people's money. 
</P>
<P>
"Large institutions can create cultures where people do things they would never 
do otherwise," Lewis said in an interview. "There is a subculture on Wall 
Street where behavior bears no relation to conventional social behavior." 
</P>
<P>
This, said Lewis, became clear to him from the moment he entered the Salomon 
Bros. training program: "It resembled nothing as much as my sixth-grade class 
on a day we had a substitute teacher." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Baker, a public relations spokesman for Salomon Bros., begins his response 
to the book in diplomatic fashion. "I think it's an amusing caricature," he 
says. "I think the first half of the book is very, very funny. We all read it." 
</P>
<P>
With a little gentle encouragement, Baker elaborates. "A caricature takes 
certain features and exaggerates them. It's 'Animal House.' Was 'Animal House' 
accurate? Is David Levine's work accurate (referring to the New York Review of 
Books political cartoonist)? Well, yes and no. But if you're Margaret Thatcher 
or Francois Mitterrand or Salomon Bros., you expect it comes with the 
territory." 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't the book true, then? 
</P>
<P>
Says Baker, "I feel Michael's being as honest with his reader as he was with 
his employer." 
</P>
<P>
Now he is picking up steam. He offers a literary critique. "I think it's very 
hard to write in the first person. The person who's speaking has to be flawed 
or ironic. Otherwise, that person becomes a divinity. Michael writes wonderful 
dialogue and knows how to set a scene -- and that's not easy. But where the 
book fails is at the end. He loses his point of view. In the first half, he's a 
greedy little (expletive) like everyone else, and at the end he's like Jim 
Bakker, 'born again,' righteous, so full of virtue that he can't sully his 
hands with comers." 
</P>
<P>
Baker now sounds like a Bible-thumping sermonizer himself. "At the end you 
don't care about this little guy. He violates Rule 6: Don't take yourself too 
seriously. He becomes tiresome. At the end, this little creature becomes so 
saccharine, you feel sorry for him." 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for mighty Salomon Bros. concludes with a high-pitched giggle. 
Even Bob Baker concedes that Michael Lewis was one of the most successful 
members of the Salomon Bros. trading class of 1985. When Lewis joined the 
training program, it consisted of 127 people, from the teacher's pets in the 
front row to Japanese trainees who snoozed during class to the back-row boys 
who howled and hooted and hurled paper missiles at the front-row nerds and, 
occasionally, at the firm's managing directors. Lewis sat somewhere in the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
The level of maturity didn't improve much out on the trading floor. A fearsome 
trader known as the "Human Piranha" uses a certain expletive as noun, verb, 
adjective and adverb. The traders in the mortgage-backed securities department 
are portrayed as Salomon's "baddest dudes," who play pranks such as snatching 
the clothes from the suitcase of a colleague headed on a vacation and stuffing 
the bag with soggy paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
On Fridays, the department indulged in an afternoon "feeding frenzy," putting 
clients on hold while traders gorged themselves from five-gallon drums of 
guacamole. Once, the department head, Lewis S. Ranieri, cut the bow tie off the 
blouse of a new female trainee with a pair of scissors, then handed her a $100 
bill and suggested she buy something else. 
</P>
<P>
Ranieri said through a spokesman that he has read the book but doesn't want to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
If an incredulous reader wonders whether Lewis conjured up these descriptions, 
take heed of a former Salomon trader who confirmed the gist of the portrait, 
adding that: "If you fired a shotgun full of M&amp;Ms over the mortgage 
department, not a single one would hit the ground." 
</P>
<P>
What fed this bond-trading frenzy was the increase in collective borrowing by 
government, corporations and consumers -- from $2.8 trillion in 1977 to $7 
trillion by 1985. In addition, a 1979 decision by Paul A. Volcker, then 
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, to maintain a steady money supply led to 
wild swings in interest rates -- and thus in the prices of previously staid 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
As king of the bond market, Salomon Bros. for a time became the most profitable 
firm on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
Though many Ivy League college graduates aspired to this world of high finance, 
the blond-haired, animated Lewis took a circuitous route. 
</P>
<P>
He majored in art history at Princeton, taking only one pass-fail class in 
economics. 
</P>
<P>
After graduation, he worked seven months as a stock clerk for a private art 
gallery in New York and four months as a woodcutter in Frenchtown, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was off to Britain. He followed his girlfriend (now his wife) to 
London, where she intended to study politics at the London School of Economics. 
Lewis enrolled in the economics program. 
</P>
<P>
While in London, he was invited to dinner with the Queen Mother, a scene 
described in the book. It turned out to be a fund-raising event with hundreds 
of other people. Seated next to him was the wife of a Salomon Bros. managing 
director. After cross-examining him during dinner, she urged Lewis to come to 
work for her husband's firm. She subsequently arranged his admission to the 
Salomon Bros. training program. 
</P>
<P>
"Wall Street paid top dollar for what I could do, which was nothing," Lewis 
writes. He started at $45,000. "I didn't really imagine I was going to work, 
more as if I were going to collect lottery winnings." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis says he decided to write the book after two years on the job, when the 
firm laid off 1,000 people just before the October, 1987, crash. Two entire 
departments were sacked; some people with 15 years' experience were told to 
leave before the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
He originally planned a less personal account of Wall Street in the 1980s, but 
his own odyssey -- "Rising Through the Wreckage on Wall Street" is the book's 
subtitle -- took over most of the narrative. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis recounts his experience at the London bond-selling office: "My job was to 
get people to do things. When my advice was completely spurious, people would 
take it anyway." 
</P>
<P>
His first customer, disguised in the book as "Herman the German," lost $140,000 
and his job after Lewis unwittingly unloaded on him Salomon's position in weak 
AT&amp;T bonds. Lewis said when he discovered the poor quality of the bonds and 
complained to the trader who urged him to sell them to the German, the trader 
responded: "Look, who do you work for, this guy or Salomon Bros.?" 
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, Lewis "jammed" -- or dumped -- $86 million worth of 
Olympia &amp; York bonds Salomon wanted to unload on a French client. He 
received calls of congratulations from New York, including one from the Human 
Piranha. But Lewis was uncomfortable. "As a rule, the greater the praise 
lavished upon a salesman within Salomon, the greater the eventual suffering of 
the customer." 
</P>
<P>
Far from destroying every buyable copy, Salomon's London office is considering 
a bulk purchase for its employees, and Chairman Gutfreund bought copies and 
gave them to the firm's managing directors. 
</P>
<P>
"This is interesting for several reasons," said a former Salomon Bros. trader. 
"First, it isn't as though the other managing directors couldn't afford to buy 
the book. Second, it shows that they don't care whether the book casts them in 
a favorable light because they figure, 'Hey, it's about us.' And finally it 
shows that they think customers have short memories." 
</P>
<P>
If there is a lesson in "Liar's Poker," it may be that another sucker, another 
"market fool," is born every minute. As Lewis writes about the firm's clients, 
"the truly incredible thing about them . . . was that no matter how roughly 
they were treated they kept coming back for more." Or as a senior trader joked 
with the training class: "Some people are born to be customers." 
</P>
<P>
It is that sentiment that leads many Wall Street financiers to believe that 
Salomon Bros. isn't likely to suffer a great deal from its portrayal. And 
despite Lewis' protestations of his own financial naivete, many people still 
seek his guidance. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing people want to believe more than that someone out there can 
turn their money into more money," Lewis said. "People are more gullible in 
financial matters than with most other things. Salomon Bros. was profitable, so 
people looked to us for advice. What they didn't realize was that we were 
profitable by taking money from them. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to demonstrate in the book how careful people must be about the advice 
they receive. Yet when I go to promote the book, people still ask me what they 
should do with their money!" 
</P>
<P>
For the record: Lewis conservatively invests in money-market funds and in 
Japanese and German securities. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact Lewis' salary, bonus and benefits totaled $275,000 a year at 
Salomon, he decided to leave his job at the beginning of 1988 (just after bonus 
payment) because it became routine, he said in his epilogue. While he said his 
father grew up with the belief that money is a rough guide to one's 
contribution to the prosperity of society, Lewis had learned otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"Never before have so many unskilled 24-year-olds made so much money in so 
little time as we did this decade in New York and London. There has never 
before been such a fantastic exception to the rule of the marketplace that one 
takes out no more than one puts in." As a result, he says, money no longer is 
connected to his feeling of self-worth. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis wrote that in leaving Salomon Bros. he wanted to take a risk. But he 
conceded that "I walked away from the clearest shot I'll ever have at being a 
millionaire." 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, no need to take up a collection. Not only is Lewis' wife a 
London-based investment banker, but he says almost every major studio has 
called to negotiate movie rights. One has offered to let Lewis do the script. 
The paperback rights will probably fetch six figures. The German publisher paid 
about $147,000, and Japanese publishers are making inquiries.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: MEDIUM MISSES THE MESSAGE IN '50 YEARS OF TV' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As always, the very look of Walter Cronkite and the sound of his voice impart 
the wisdom and credibility of a modern Moses leading his flock from a wasteland 
of ignorance to a promised land of enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's the way it is," America's anchorman emeritus and icon of trust 
assures us, like old times, near the end of Sunday night's "Fifty Years of 
Television: A Golden Celebration" on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, however, that's not the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
For this, we can mostly thank TV's partiality not only for fact-twisting 
docudramas, but also, now, for re-created contemporary news events that fuzz 
truth and speculation. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, "Fifty Years of Television" itself -- an entertainment special airing 
at 9 p.m. on Channels 2 and 8 -- is not the way it is, or was. Not entirely, 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, it frames the medium narrowly and uncritically, omitting such 
prominent recent footnotes, for example, as those controversial dramatic 
re-creations favored by some syndicated tabloids and such network offerings as 
"Saturday Night With Connie Chung" on CBS, and NBC's "Unsolved Mysteries" and 
"Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Even when properly labeled, these truth-like simulations of actual events rank 
among the most dangerous and destructive booby traps of modern TV, invariably 
exploding in our faces and bringing blindness instead of clarity. 
</P>
<P>
NBC News seemed to be acknowledging that when it announced this week that 
simulation-laden "Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow" -- a news magazine that 
aired three times last summer -- was being transfered to the network's 
entertainment division. The news division earlier produced a fourth episode 
that will air next week. 
</P>
<P>
Said NBC News president Michael Gartner about re-creations: "We have determined 
that the practice can result in confusion to the viewer. Our primary 
responsibility at NBC News is to convey information clearly. If viewers are 
confused, the solution is simple: abandon re-creations in news programming." 
</P>
<P>
Uh . . . wait a minute. Confusion is not for NBC News, but it's acceptable for 
NBC's entertainment division to confuse viewers? What else can you infer from 
Gartner's statement? 
</P>
<P>
Will re-creations on "Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow" be much less confusing 
merely because the show is switching bosses and no longer will be fronted by 
news anchors? Gartner is right about a news division's responsibility to 
"convey information clearly." Yet doesn't an entertainment division have the 
same obligation? 
</P>
<P>
You wouldn't think so judging by the CBS entertainment division's "golden 
celebration" of TV on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, it's entertaining all right, essentially a merry-go-round of archival clips 
-- many of them quite wonderful -- bridged by commentary from TV stars ranging 
from Cronkite to Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy, a fusion somehow epitomizing 
TV's merging realms of news and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
The program is fun, among its treasures being excerpts from such ancient TV 
productions as "Marty," with Rod Steiger as the story's self-deprecating pudgy 
hero who isn't interested in making a fashion statement: "The blue suit, the 
gray suit, I'm a fat little man." 
</P>
<P>
But understand "Fifty Years of Television" for what it is, two euphemistic 
hours that distort through narrowness. In a sense, the show is its own 
re-creation, flowing from Cronkite's misleading assertion that TV "was 
introduced at the New York World's Fair" in 1939, when in fact the British were 
already regularly telecasting by that time. 
</P>
<P>
Even more fundamentally, a program that celebrates TV by excluding much of TV 
-- and while also leaving out the warts -- is a celebration of ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Cronkite's presence, "Fifty Years of Television" sort of slips TV news 
in through the back door. Much worse, it doesn't even mention sports programs, 
daytime programs, children's programs or syndicated programs. Also missing, 
incredibly, are not only local TV and public TV, but also the blazing 
technologies of cable, VCRs and videos that have helped alter the TV landscape. 
The cable omission is especially ironic because the show's executive producers, 
John Moffitt and Pat Tourk Lee, have had their greatest recent success in 
creating HBO's "Not Necessarily the News." 
</P>
<P>
Now comes Not Necessarily Television. 
</P>
<P>
Covering half a century of TV in two hours minus commercials just barely beats 
trying to squeeze an 800-pound gorilla into a matchbox. Thus, "Fifty Years of 
Television" offers hardly any reflection or interpretation, no Geiger counter 
to locate the medium's common denominators, both positive and negative. 
</P>
<P>
It's as selective as our own memories, a highlight reel of prime-time clips not 
from TV's vast transparent ooze, but from mostly impact shows, making TV look 
far more exhilarating -- and bold -- than it was or is. 
</P>
<P>
We see Edward R. Murrow's famous denunciation of notorious Red-hunting 
demagogue Joseph McCarthy, for example, but nothing about the cowardly networks 
cooperating in censoring programs and going along with the black-listing of 
allegedly Communist-leaning writers, producers, directors and actors.

"Productions have continued to address the vital issues of our times," Jane 
Seymour says Sunday. Yes, such as those wall-to-wall rape stories that have 
cluttered the November ratings sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
As if hauling out a token black member of an otherwise all-white country club, 
Seymour dutifully cites the classic "Roots" as an example of TV's greatness in 
drama. Fair enough. Yet unmentioned is that the expected post-"Roots" flowering 
of black dramatic opportunities never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
Surely something more cosmic is demanded of a retrospective of American TV. No, 
you can't get enough of Sid Caesar's genius, or of "I Love Lucy," Mary Tyler 
Moore, Jack Benny, Ernie Kovacs and clips of those primitive early days, when, 
in contrast to today, TV's talent was more advanced than its technology. 
</P>
<P>
When you think of what TV has recently imprinted on our minds, however -- 
pictures of the eroding Berlin Wall, of 200,000 Czechs demonstrating for reform 
in Prague, of terrified Salvadorans caught in a crossfire of bullets and 
politics -- it's evident just how weak and soft Sunday's program is. 
</P>
<P>
This is television, not a fat little man.

MURPHY &amp; PRYOR'S STAR TREK;

<P>
MOVIES: FOR ALL THE STAR QUALITY EDDIE MURPHY AND RICHARD PRYOR BRING TO THE 
SCREEN, THEIR COMIC TALENTS SEEM TO HAVE TAKEN A WRONG TURN.

"Harlem Nights" is the first movie to co-star Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor. 
Watching the sorry, unfunny mess that has resulted is like witnessing a highly 
touted heavyweight title bout that inexplicably turns into a pat-a-cake session 
between cruiserweights. Even those of us who have just about given up on Murphy 
hoped the pairing with Pryor would snap him to attention. But it's been a long 
stretch since either Murphy or Pryor has thrilled audiences with anything more 
than their star power. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time -- say, seven or eight years ago -- when such a confab would 
have raised the rafters. Murphy began his four-year stint at "Saturday Night 
Live" during the 1980-81 season, and his appearances on that show, with his 
impersonations of pimps, jailbirds, Gumby, Buckwheat and Bill Cosby, are still 
his comic high point. He could create characters that had the whole country 
talking about them the next day. Pryor, of course, had a thriving if uneven 
movie career in the early '80s. His glory, however, was his stand-up comedy 
films, particularly the 1978 "Richard Pryor Live in Concert" and the 1982 
"Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip." They were the movies in which Richard 
Pryor could be Richard Pryor. 
</P>
<P>
In the intervening years, Murphy has become a major movie star largely at the 
expense of what made him a TV star. He has moved away from the quicksilver, 
revue-sketch humor and the edgy playfulness of his "SNL" days and turned 
himself into a commodity. His comic facetiousness has turned stone-cold. 
Whereas he once professed his idol to be Richard Pryor, his movies suggest 
another deity: Sylvester Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy is a movie star because his films make fortunes, but is there anything 
stellar about his work as a '30s nightclub dandy in "Harlem Nights," a movie in 
which his character's homicidal streak is played for cheap laughs? Is there 
anything anointed about his work in such films as "The Golden Child," "Coming 
to America" or "Beverly Hills Cop II"? His reprehensible 1987 stand-up comedy 
film "Raw" begins when, leather-suited, he strides on stage amid hoopla not 
inappropriate to the Second Coming. The film was a real potpourri of hatred. In 
it, his free-floating hostilities descend on women, gays, whites, blacks -- 
take your pick. To review it was to leave the domain of criticism for 
psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
Stardom can sometimes enlarge an actor's possibilities and bring out what was 
nascent, and best, in his talents. The reverse seems to have happened to 
Murphy. In "SNL," he was part of an ensemble; he was challenged by the other 
performers. In his movies, starting with his first (and still best) film, "48 
HRS," where he co-starred with Nick Nolte, Murphy has essentially been 
performing solo. He works with such crackerjack precision that sometimes he 
doesn't need anybody else around; he can be his own most appreciative audience. 
</P>
<P>
But Murphy desperately needs to be challenged in the movies. Yet, given the 
fact that he controls them so completely -- he is writer, director and 
executive producer of "Harlem Nights" -- how will that ever happen? His clout 
has allowed his worst instincts to come through. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Pryor is playing his surrogate father in his new film, but there's an 
element of condescension in the casting. Pryor is positioned as Murphy's wise 
and cautious mentor, an elder statesman. It's the kind of "tribute" that's 
indistinguishable from neutering. 
</P>
<P>
If Eddie Murphy's star power has allowed him all too successfully to tincture 
his films with the poison of his stand-up-comedy attitudes, then Richard Pryor 
has the opposite problem. His box-office clout has allowed him the opportunity 
to make a series of marginal movies with virtually no connection to his great 
stand-up persona. In films ranging from "The Toy" to "Bustin' Loose" to 
"Brewster's Millions," Pryor has opted for the cushiony comforts of family 
entertainment. With his pick of writers, directors and co-stars, he has 
nevertheless willingly led himself into creative oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
It's never been easy for a volatile talent to score in the movies; the 
commercial demands of the business are invariably at odds with true 
subversiveness. But Pryor has the kind of control that might have preserved his 
rawness on film, not only in his concert movies, but in his dramatic films too. 
The cuddliness of his screen image is a sick joke. It might seem like a put-on 
if only Pryor showed some sign that he was in on the con. But he is resignedly 
bland in his movies; anything malign or threatening has been bleached out. 
</P>
<P>
With an artist as troubled and complicated as Pryor, it's difficult to assign 
motivation. Does a film like "Bustin' Loose," where he plays a good-natured 
grump to a busload of kids, represent what Pryor thinks the movies deserve? 
Does he think such movies represent what he deserves? Obscenity has always been 
the fuel of Pryor's art, and these roles can't accommodate it. 
</P>
<P>
He has never quite given up entirely, though. Bad as it was, his 1986 
autobiographical film "Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling," which he also 
directed, was at least an attempt to scour the treacle from his image. In films 
like the 1972 "Lady Sings the Blues," playing Piano Man to Diana Ross' Billie 
Holiday, the 1978 "Blue Collar," where he played a Detroit auto worker, and the 
1981 "Some Kind of Hero," where he played a POW returning from Vietnam, he gave 
indications of wanting to do more as an actor than just make nice. For years 
there was talk that he was preparing a biography of Charlie Parker. 
</P>
<P>
The problem may be that Pryor believes that, in order to quell his demons, he 
can't draw on anything in his life that means anything to him. In "Live on the 
Sunset Strip," talking about his recuperation after his free-basing accident, 
he says, "Maybe I ain't funny anymore. Maybe I ain't hungry at nothing for real 
in my heart." But the triumph of that film was that Pryor demonstrated he could 
be an artist without working up a fount of rage. Pryor has been funnier than he 
was in that film, but he was never as mysteriously moving, or as fragile. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Pryor has always been mischaracterized as a riotous comic. He was 
never really a social-activist crusader; his stand-up riffs exposed racism, but 
his humor was deeply personal, screwed up, aloof. The Get Whitey agenda of the 
early '70s never quite played for Pryor as it did for the other black comics 
and actors because Pryor was after private demons, not white demons. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding whites, he went beyond rage and into stupefaction. (That's what made 
the scene in "Silver Streak" where he attempts to teach Gene Wilder how to be 
black such a howl.) His landscape was ultimately interior. He could split 
himself into an entire gallery of characters: winos, junkies, hustlers, movie 
executives, ex-wives. He could animate inanimate objects, like, most memorably, 
his cocaine pipe in "Live on the Sunset Strip." The only thing Pryor can't play 
is normal, and that, ironically, is what he's set out to be in movie after 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
The history of black performers in the movie business is such a trail of waste 
and despair that the ascension of Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor has symbolic 
value out of all proportion to their actual achievement. With few exceptions, 
black actors have only been accepted as stars when they are comics. 
</P>
<P>
This must explain some of Eddie Murphy's rage. Deprived in his early movies of 
any love interest with his white female co-stars, straitened into situations 
where he played the black sidekick joker to white actors, he has 
overcompensated by shunting his creative energies into a makeover that probably 
means a lot more to him than it does to audiences. His attempts to promote 
himself as a stud action-hero with a curdling cruel humor must function as a 
kind of retribution for him. For some of us, it's a punishment.

WHY THERE'S NO TOMORROW FOR 'USA TODAY'; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE CANCELLATION MARKS ANOTHER SETBACK FOR GTG ENTERTAINMENT, WHICH 
HAD THREE PROGRAMS DROPPED LAST YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
"USA Today on TV," which once billed itself as TV of the future, is now a thing 
of the past. 
</P>
<P>
GTG Entertainment, the production company created by former NBC Chairman Grant 
Tinker and the Gannett Co., pulled the plug on Thanksgiving Eve after a rocky 
year and two months that saw the syndicated program lambasted by critics, 
ignored by viewers and dropped by stations. The last segment is scheduled for 
Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine-format program, originally titled "USA Today: The Television 
Show," debuted in September, 1988, on 156 stations, many of them running it in 
the coveted slot just before prime time. But now, the number of stations has 
dwindled to 84, with many airing the 30-minute show during hours only 
insomniacs could appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
Executive producer Jack Hurley called the staff together in their Rosslyn, Va., 
headquarters minutes before Wednesday's taping and told them the end had 
arrived. Though the cancellation was not completely unexpected, the timing 
caught employees off guard. There was speculation among staffers that the 
announcement was made just before Thanksgiving as a way to avoid extensive news 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Miriam Hernandez, the program's Washington correspondent, said Hurley told his 
staff that he was "very upset with the timing" of the announcement as well as 
the decision to ax the show. 
</P>
<P>
Tinker and Gannett Chairman John Curley issued a joint statement saying they 
were proud of the show but "obviously disappointed" in the ratings. The program 
garnered an 8.1 rating during its first week. The show received a rating of 2.9 
for the week of Nov. 12, the most recent available. Each ratings point equals 
921,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the program's operations said several factors prompted 
the midseason cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
The ratings had dropped to a point where recovery was deemed impossible. And 
although a great many stations were contractually committed to airing "USA 
Today" for the rest of the season, it was not something they wanted to do. "So 
it was a case of forcing them to live up to a contract, not giving them 
something they were enthusiastic about," said a source. "The alternative to 
holding their feet to the fire was canceling the show midseason." 
</P>
<P>
Not unrelated was the fact that GTG is readying other syndicated programs for 
sale to individual stations -- stations that would include those now obligated 
to run "USA Today." Freeing them from a show they would drop soon anyway, 
rather than leaving them embittered, seemed like a good idea, said the source. 
</P>
<P>
The show, which cost $40 million to launch, premiered amid a flurry of 
self-generated fanfare, much of it from executive producer Steve Friedman, who 
is credited with boosting NBC's "Today" show to the top morning slot. 
</P>
<P>
But the critics hated it. Loathed it. Like its newspaper namesake, the TV show 
was chock-full of snappy graphics and short-short stories. Fluffy news blips, 
the critics said. 
</P>
<P>
Within two weeks, the show was being overhauled to slow down the pace a little 
and add some substance to the stories. It underwent several more makeovers 
during its short life. Friedman was replaced by Jim Bellows, who is credited 
with turning "Entertainment Tonight" into a winner. Bellows apparently was 
forced out soon after his arrival; he filed a lawsuit over his dismissal that 
was settled recently. Tom Kirby, a Gannett broadcasting executive was brought 
in next, only to be followed by Hurley, another Gannett man. 
</P>
<P>
Reporter Hernandez, who joined the show only six weeks ago, said the program 
had evolved into a solid news operation. "It was not sleazy. It was not 'Hard 
Copy,' " she said, referring to one of the latest and glitziest entries in the 
world of tabloid TV. 
</P>
<P>
In its most recent incarnation, "USA Today" was reporting on education issues, 
airport problems and pollution, said Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
"Significant changes were made," she said. "It became substantive, there was 
more meat on it. It wasn't just a video picture book. It had information." 
</P>
<P>
The cancellation marks another setback for Tinker and GTG. During the 1988-89 
season, the company saw all three of its network programs canceled by CBS. This 
season, the production company is making "Baywatch" for NBC, producing a sitcom 
pilot for CBS and is readying three syndicated programs -- an infotainment show 
called "Celebrity Update," a game show called "Love Thy Neighbor" and a talk 
show hosted by Diahann Carroll and her daughter.

JEWEL THIEVES HIT AGAIN, GET $20,000 
</P>

Four men brandishing handguns took $20,000 worth of jewelry and gems from a 
Robinson's store in Cerritos on Wednesday in the latest of a series of armed 
robberies at Los Angeles area department store jewelry counters, sheriff's 
deputies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Customers were in the store at the time but no one was injured, Sgt. Steve 
Manthorne said. 
</P>
<P>
"It fits in with what we call the counter-smash robberies that have been 
happening in the past three to four years," Manthorne said. "Numerous stores 
have been victims and it's an ongoing problem." 
</P>
<P>
The thieves strode into the jewelry department at Robinson's in Los Cerritos 
Center Mall about noon Wednesday, pulling out revolvers and demanding that a 
sales clerk open the display case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the robbers emptied the case of gems and jewelry, fled the store 
and drove off in a white Chevrolet Cavalier. 
</P>
<P>
The car had been stolen and was abandoned across the street from the mall, 
fitting a pattern followed by thieves in similar jewelry-counter robberies, 
Manthorne said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a method of operation that robbers have found successful," he said. "They 
take off in a stolen car, abandon it one or two blocks away from the store and 
have another car waiting for them." 
</P>
<P>
In September, three armed robbers took $500,000 worth of necklaces, bracelets, 
pins and rings from a Bullock's store at the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square, the 
second such incident recently at that shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
Two months earlier, thieves with handguns took about $200,000 worth of jewelry 
from a Broadway store at the Sherman Oaks Mall, officials said.

CITY OF LOS ANGELES 1989 PILOT PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Cecilia Rasmussen, Times Researcher 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking for ways to improve its operation, the city of Los Angeles sponsors a 
number of pilot programs in areas ranging from crime prevention to child care. 
The money for these experimental programs comes from federal, state and local 
governments, as well as from private corporations. This is a list of many of 
the major programs approved in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
California Youth Authority Re-Entry 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: This one-year program, which began operating this month at the Fred C. 
Nelles school in Whittier and the Ventura school in Camarillo, is aimed at 
protecting society by providing training, counseling, self-esteem building and 
job preparation six months before parole for 316 incarcerated youths. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: A grant of about $754,000 is administered through the Community 
Development Department and financed through the federal Job Training 
Partnership Act. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Child Care Revolving Loan 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: A one-year effort that is scheduled to start in December, the program 
will offer loans to city residents who want to open child care centers in their 
homes and who have begun the 60-day licensing process. Prospective child care 
providers can receive loans of up to $2,000 to buy toys and cribs, meet 
licensing requirements or help pay for insurance. The loans will be issued at 
two points below the prime rate and will be payable within three years. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: The city and the nonprofit California Community Foundation, a 
charitable organization that works with United Way, have provided $225,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bilingual Home Health Workers 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: Designed to train 168 participants, mostly Latinos, to become home 
health workers and provide in-home care to people with AIDS, the program began 
in April with 16 trainees. After completing eight weeks of training, 
participants are placed in jobs with local home health agencies. Twelve of the 
16 have completed the course and received their certificates. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: A $600,000 Job Training Partnership Act grant will pay for the 
two-year project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Day Laborers 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: A controversial six-month project, approved by the city in February, 
is aimed at regulating the hiring of illegal immigrants, who typically 
congregate at selected intersections, waiting to be hired by private employers. 
The first site opened in Harbor City in late October and a second will open in 
Sun Valley sometime next month. A total of six hiring sites eventually will be 
set up around the city. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: The city is providing $90,000 through the Community Development 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drew Medical Center 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: In this six-month program that began in July, 36 school dropouts and 
teen-age parents are being trained for a variety of health-related jobs, 
including medical assistant, X-ray technician, ward clerk and laboratory 
assistant. Participants will earn six-month certificates, be placed in jobs and 
become eligible to receive up to 12 college credits from the Drew Medical 
School. In some cases, participants will be able to use the program to satisfy 
course requirements in Drew's associate's and bachelor's degree programs. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: A Job Training Partnership Act grant is providing $194,675. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood Pride 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: Providing constructive outlets for youths who might be tempted to join 
gangs or experiment with drugs is the goal of the program, which began July 1 
and is scheduled to run through June 30, 1990. Up to 10 young people, ages 14 
to 21, are paid the minimum wage to help professional artists design and paint 
15 large murals in their neighborhoods, from Venice to South-Central Los 
Angeles. Nine of the murals are expected to be completed by next summer. 
Backers hope the yearlong program will instill in participants a sense of pride 
in their work and neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: The nonprofit Social and Public Arts Resource Center will spend 
$405,383 on the program, which is administered through the city's Cultural 
Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Community Service Center 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: The two-year project, a joint venture of the Community Development 
Department and the Los Angeles Housing Authority, is designed to get more 
residents at five of the city's most problem-plagued housing projects off the 
welfare rolls and into the workplace. The first center opened Nov. 14 at Ramona 
Gardens in East Los Angeles. Additional centers are planned at Nickerson 
Gardens in Watts, San Fernando Gardens in Pacoima, Rancho San Pedro in 
Wilmington and Mar Vista Gardens in West Los Angeles. The program offers 
project residents counseling, job training and services ranging from child care 
to basic education classes. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: A $1.3-million Job Training Partnership Act grant is administered 
through the Community Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Operation Clean Sweep 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: This six-month program broadens the city's attack on graffiti and 
calls for fines against property owners who do not sign a consent form allowing 
the city to paint over graffiti at city expense. A new city ordinance makes it 
illegal to leave graffiti on surfaces visible from a public roadway. If a 
property owner refuses to sign the form, the city will cover the graffiti, send 
the owner a bill or, as a last resort, assess the costs against the owner in 
the form of a lien. Since the program began Sept. 8, the Department of Public 
Works has received 915 requests to clean up graffiti. About 700 of those have 
been granted. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: The city, through the Department of Public Works, will spend $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Substation in Housing Projects 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: Designed to crack down on gang- and drug-related crime in the city's 
housing projects, the six-month program began in July at crime-plagued Imperial 
Courts in Watts. Police hope to build a relationship of trust with the tenants. 
A sergeant and 10 officers who volunteered for the program use a converted 
apartment as their headquarters and work with two officers from the Housing 
Authority's police force. Eventually the pilot project could be expanded to 
more of the Housing Authority's 21 public housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: The city budgeted $19,245 for furniture, office and technical 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refuse Collection Truck Operator 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: The project, which started in September and ran for six weeks, helped 
train 29 young people and adults to operate refuse collection trucks and 
prepared them for placement in full-time employment. The Department of Public 
Works operates a combination classroom and on-the-job training program. After 
completing the program, each participant received a Class B motor vehicle 
license and was hired by the city for two months on a part-time basis. 
Twenty-two participants have prepared to take the Civil Service examination to 
qualify for permanent employment, and 11 have passed. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: A Job Training Partnership Act grant of $200,000 is administered 
jointly through the Community Development Department and the Department of 
Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stolen Vehicle Recovery Network 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: In order to help curb the ever-growing problem of car theft, the 
three-year program, approved in March, involves installing a "James Bond-type" 
tracking device in about 150 Police Department patrol cars and a number of 
police helicopters. Homing devices that work with the tracking equipment will 
be available to the public in January for about $600, police said. If a car 
with a homing device is stolen, police can track it down by sending out a radio 
signal that activates the transponder in the car. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: The LoJack Corp. of Braintree, Mass., an auto alarm dealer, will 
donate $1.5 million worth of tracking devices and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Secured Area Foot Beat Enforcement (SAFE) 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: Prodded by pleas from residents of crime-plagued neighborhoods, 60 
police officers have been bused sinced early October to eight epicenters of 
gang activity and drug dealing in the city. Police say the program already has 
reduced crime considerably in the target areas. Statistics, however, were not 
immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: The Los Angeles Police Department is spending $750,000 for this 
scaled-down, three-month program, which is to run until Dec. 1. Mayor Tom 
Bradley balked at spending $2.5 million for the program, but promised to keep 
it alive until June 30, 1990. The City Council will have to come up with money 
for the patrols after current funding runs out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Watts Friendship Sports League Task Force 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: Operating at four city recreation centers -- Imperial Courts, Jordan 
Downs and Nickerson Gardens housing projects and 109th Street Park -- the 
program gives 240 youths in the grades 1 through 6 the opportunity to boost 
their self-esteem through sports participation. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: The city, through the Department of Recreation and Parks, is spending 
$12,960 for the soccer season, which began in October and continues through 
mid-December. The task force running the program is now seeking $44,000 from 
private corporations for the basketball, track and field and baseball seasons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Homeless Evaluation and Linkage Program 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: Dubbed HELP, the three-month demonstration program at Weingart Center, 
which began in October at the center, is designed to expand outreach services 
to 15,000 to 20,000 homeless people in the Skid Row area. Social workers match 
the homeless with existing jobs, housing and substance-abuse programs. Since 
the program got under way, more than 220 people have been helped, 95% of them 
receiving housing and meals. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: The city and county have provided a total of $67,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adult Sponsors for Youth at Risk 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: A two-year anti-gang program run by the Community Development 
Department, this effort is designed to pair as many as 500 adult volunteers 
with children who live in five of the city's housing projects to help them 
resist the lure of gang life. The program, which began last month at Mar Vista 
Gardens, Ramona Gardens, San Fernando Gardens, Nickerson Gardens and Rancho San 
Pedro, is aimed at youths between the ages of 8 and 14. Under the program, the 
city also contracts with community organizations for after-school education, 
child care and sports activities. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: A $2-million grant comes from the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Youth at Risk Advocacy Unit 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: The one-year program, which began in July, coordinates all 
youth-at-risk programs throughout the city, which include programs for school 
dropouts, nonviolent youthful offenders, truants, welfare youth, young people 
learning English as a second language, pregnant teen-agers and teen-age 
parents, learning-disabled and mentally retarded youths, victims of physical, 
emotional or sexual abuse or violent crimes, and youth who have witnessed 
violent crimes. The unit is in the process of setting up a hot line providing 
information on where to go for gang-and drug-related services. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: The city, through the Community Development Department, is spending 
$2.1 million.

$6,388.81 REWARD FOR NIGHT STALKER REMAINS UNCLAIMED; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: ALEJANDRO ESPINOZA WAS 'A BIG BREAK' IN HELPING TO CONVICT RICHARD 
RAMIREZ. BUT OFFICIALS CAN'T FIND HIM TO GIVE HIM HIS REWARD.

<P>
Alejandro Espinoza: Los Angeles County has a $6,388.81 check for you for your 
help in convicting Night Stalker Richard Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
But authorities don't know where to find you. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody seems to know his whereabouts," said Larry Monteilh, executive officer 
to the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Monteilh said Espinoza filed a claim for a share of the $36,777 reward but 
failed to include his address. Shares of the reward pot were given out to 
others this week in proportion to how important their information was to 
investigators, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Espinoza will receive the second-largest chunk of the reward because he 
assisted police in recovering property taken from the homes of some of the 
Night Stalker's murder victims. Ramirez was convicted Sept. 20 of 13 murders 
and faces death in the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Phil Halpin said Espinoza provided the link between the stolen items 
and Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
"My recollection was that this was one of the people who led us to the person 
to whom Ramirez was selling stolen property," Halpin said. "That was a big 
break in the case." 
</P>
<P>
Halpin said that Espinoza was "an acquaintance" of Ramirez, but officials do 
not believe that he was involved in the case. Authorities also do not believe 
that Espinoza was dealing in stolen property, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that he had driven (Ramirez) to the location on one or two 
occasions where the property was sold," Halpin said. Espinoza "did not know 
where the property came from. All he knew is that there was a fellow who fit 
the description that had been published (in the media) that he knew, and this 
fellow also was apparently selling property that could well have come from the 
locations where the crimes had been committed." 
</P>
<P>
Monteilh said law enforcement authorities have been asked to help locate the 
missing man. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Homicide Sgt. Frank Salerno, who worked on the Night Stalker case, 
said Espinoza's last known address was in downtown Los Angeles. He described 
him as a street-wise person who has "contact with people on the street." 
</P>
<P>
"We're told that he has a wife and a small child," Salerno said. Several 
sheriff's investigators met Espinoza, face-to-face, when he came forward with 
the information. So they would be able to verify his identity, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll continue to hold his money in trust until he shows up," Monteilh said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department homicide investigators may be contacted at 974-4341.

ROUSTING THE ROOST; 
</P>
<P>
REDONDO BEACH NEIGHBORS RUN AFOWL OF EACH OTHER OVER CHICKENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Whites, Tom and Josie, had been searching for years when they finally found 
the spot to build their dream house. A corner lot, it was, with a whispering 
sea breeze and an old cottage; where their Mediterranean estate would someday 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
Then they moved in, and the sea breeze whispered, and what it whispered was . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Cock-a-doodle-doo. 
</P>
<P>
And that was how the Whites learned that their dream house would be next door 
to the Chicken Lady of Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want a feud to develop, but that is basically what has happened," 
said Tom White, a 41-year-old orthodontist. For the Whites and their neighbor 
-- 37-year-old bird lover Roseanne Smith -- the last three years have been 
consumed with a battle over her desire to keep her back yard full of pet 
roosters and hens and their wish "not to live next door to a chicken farm." 
</P>
<P>
"The chicken situation," as the Whites refer to it, has been aired from the 
City Council chambers to Los Angeles County Municipal Court. And despite 
ordinances, court orders and even a criminal conviction, as many as 35 chickens 
-- many more than the half-dozen the city said she could keep -- continue to 
roost outside the cottage where Smith grew up. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after being hauled into court yet again by her neighbors, Smith faces the 
ultimate punishment: A court commissioner has given her until Dec. 8 to get rid 
of every chicken on her property. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, why don't they let us alone?" lamented Smith's father, Edmund Smith, 62, 
who lives with Roseanne Smith and his two other daughters in the family 
homestead on Irena Street. 
</P>
<P>
"All these birds do is peck the ground a little and sleep. They don't ask much 
out of life." 
</P>
<P>
But there is more at issue between the Smiths and the Whites than the merits of 
a family coop. More than anything, both sides say, the dispute underscores the 
changes that growth has wrought in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time, Edmund Smith recalls, when their neighborhood was rural, and 
there was plenty of room for ducks, goats and even the occasional horse. But 
since 1954, when the Smiths bought their cottage with its honeysuckles, juniper 
trees and whitewashed fence, the city's population has more than doubled and 
housing prices have soared. The cottages with the 44-by-160-foot lots that cost 
Smith $6,000 now sell for more than $325,000. 
</P>
<P>
Tom White said, "These throwbacks to the past are in conflict with the changes 
that are going on in Redondo Beach." 
</P>
<P>
The Smiths, however, believe that the Whites want to make them so unhappy that 
they'll sell out and move, leaving the possibility of an even bigger lot for 
the dream house-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
"Why else would they cause all this trouble, if not because they want this 
property?" Edmund Smith asked. 
</P>
<P>
Since Roseanne was a child, her father said, she loved poultry the way other 
children love kittens and pups. 
</P>
<P>
"She'd ride her bike with her rooster, Tommy, perched on the handlebars," he 
said. "And he'd hang on pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
No one objected to Roseanne's flock, even after the initially unincorporated 
neighborhood was annexed by the city in 1982. Although the city required 
special permits for chicken owners and prohibited the keeping of chickens 
within 35 feet of other houses, it wasn't until 1986, when the property next 
door went up for sale, that the county Department of Health Services began to 
get complaints. The chief complainants, records indicate, were the Whites, who 
acknowledged that they bought the property almost sight-unseen in July, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"On the day we went by to look at it, I heard a rooster crow, but we didn't 
realize how many chickens there were until after we moved in," Josie White, 35, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"One night, I looked out and saw her open the door and 60 chickens paraded into 
her house." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Smiths said, it was 35 hens and 19 roosters, which share the back 
yard and sometimes the house with 10 cats and eight doves. As the Whites 
cleared away the thick foliage that had overgrown the fence, the cackling and 
crowing got louder, Josie White said. Roosters materialized on the edge of 
their new back yard. Her two children developed an allergy to feathers. 
</P>
<P>
Within a year, both sides say, the relationship had so deteriorated that the 
Whites offered to either buy the Smith home or take it in trade for another 
property where flocks would be welcome. 
</P>
<P>
The offer, said Tom White, was intended as a "gentlemanly proposition." But to 
the Smiths, it implied an ulterior motive. 
</P>
<P>
Soon two petitions were before the City Council -- one signed by the Whites and 
four other families to get the chickens off the block, and another signed by 
Smith and 25 neighbors who believe that the birds should stay. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1987, the City Council ordered Smith to get rid of all but six of 
her birds. Four months later, when the flock was still there, Smith was 
convicted on misdemeanor charges of violating her wild animal permit. Her 
sentence was two years' probation plus 19 hours of community service, cleaning 
cages in a Hawthorne animal shelter. 
</P>
<P>
By September, 1988, the flock was down to the allowable six birds. But 
controversy bred fame -- and chickens. And, as her reputation as the Chicken 
Lady spread, locals deluged her with strays -- everything from orphaned Easter 
chicks to a starving rooster that was "so old he could barely crow" to a little 
hen whose side had been punctured with a nail. Within six months, the flock was 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"People just came, saying 'I can't care for this chicken anymore,' " Smith 
said. "And I couldn't bring myself to say no." 
</P>
<P>
Furious, the Whites hired an attorney and reported her as a probation violator. 
On Nov. 9, Municipal Court Commissioner Douglas G. Carnahan asked how they 
would punish Smith if they were the judges. 
</P>
<P>
Give her two weeks in jail and a $500 fine, Josie White replied. Instead, the 
commissioner ordered her to get rid of the flock. 
</P>
<P>
It's an order Roseanne Smith will not obey without a fight. The last time she 
had to get rid of her chickens, she wound up having to euthanize 29 of her 
pets, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost sleep, I didn't eat, I lost 35 pounds," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
This time, she said, she will plead for leniency and write Carnahan a letter 
asking to keep her six birds. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have taken the (extra) animals if they hadn't been in pain and 
suffering," she said, "or if I could think of anyone better to care for them 
than me."

WATER: THE ARID SIDE OF CLIMATE CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL McKIBBEN, Bill McKibben has written hundreds of articles for New Yorker 
magazine. He also has written on nature for the New York Review of Books, the 
New York Times and other national publications. He and his wife live in the 
Adirondack mountains of New York state. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America is blessed with ample water -- on an average day 4,200 billion gallons 
of rain fall on the lower 48 states. Most of that evaporates, leaving only 
about 1,435 billion gallons a day, of which in 1985, only about 340 billion 
gallons a day are withdrawn for human use. 
</P>
<P>
It seems like more than enough. 
</P>
<P>
However, as anyone who has ever flown across the nation (and looked out the 
window) can attest, the water is not spread evenly. Vast sections of the West 
are arid, though not necessarily unpopulated. 
</P>
<P>
Total water use exceeds average stream flow in 24 of 53 Western water-resource 
regions, a difference made up by "mining" dwindling ground water stocks and 
importing water. Much of the Colorado's flow, for example, is dammed, diverted 
and consumed upstream by irrigation and by the millions upon millions of people 
living (and insisting on green lawns) where it would otherwise be too dry. 
</P>
<P>
And matters may get much worse. After studying the temperature and stream-flow 
records, scientists have concluded that if a "conservative" 2-degree Celsius 
increase in temperature occurs, the virgin flow of the Colorado could fall by 
nearly a third. 
</P>
<P>
If, as some of the computer models suggest, this is accompanied by a 10% fall 
in precipitation in the Southwest as a result of new weather patterns, water 
supply in the upper Colorado could fall by 40%, but even if precipitation went 
up 10%, runoff would still drop nearly a fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Across the West, the picture is similar -- in the Missouri, Arkansas, Texas 
Gulf Coast and California irrigation regions, runoff could fall by 40% or more. 
In the Missouri, Rio Grande and Colorado basins, even current water needs could 
not be met by stream flows after the expected climatic changes. 
</P>
<P>
"One model we're looking at," says Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim 
Hightower, "predicts a 25% increase in the demand for irrigation water" from 
the Ogallala Aquifer, the great subterranean lake that irrigates the plains and 
is already badly depleted. "You can't pump more water if the well has already 
gone dry." 
</P>
<P>
Even areas that we're used to thinking of as ruined may be ruined in new and 
interesting ways. Lake Erie and the Great Lakes in general became symbols of 
the environmental decline in the 1970s. They have recovered somewhat, but a 
change in climate may subject them to unprecedented stresses (which is like 
subjecting the South Bronx to unprecedented decay). Under EPA models of doubled 
carbon dioxide levels, the average level of Lake Superior could fall by a foot 
and a half -- which doesn't sound like so much, except that the fleet of ships 
working the Great Lakes are designed to pass within a foot of the bottom of the 
locks and channels. Ships will have to carry smaller loads and sail more 
frequently (burning more fuel, which will . . . you know). 
</P>
<P>
Shippers may be aided by a longer shipping season. The central basin of Lake 
Erie currently sees 83 days of ice, but if the temperatures rise, only areas 
near shore will freeze, and then for three weeks or less. 
</P>
<P>
But in that case, the erosion along the shoreline, which has been protected by 
the ice, will increase, since the winter is the season of big storms. And if 
the ships do keep sailing, it may also increase the supply of sad folk songs -- 
it was a winter gale in 1975 that sank the Edmund Fitzgerald with all 29 hands. 
</P>
<P>
Declining water levels can cause a variety of miscellaneous mischief. When 
droughts lowered Lake Michigan in the 1960s, dry rot set in along the piers and 
pilings of Chicago's shoreline. Hydropower production may drop as flows along 
the Niagara River fall, pollutants in the lakes may become less diluted, and 
the warmer lake waters will almost certainly lead to algal blooms and a return 
of the oxygen deprivation that "killed " Lake Erie once before. 
</P>
<P>
That "increased eutrophication could make the Lake Erie Central Basin 
uninhabitable for fin fish and shellfish during the summer," concluded the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
Across the country and across the world the usual endless list of multiplying 
dangers can be compiled. 
</P>
<P>
"Water quality appears to be vulnerable to deterioration because of increased 
use of agricultural pesticides as a response to climate change," reported the 
EPA. There is an increased risk of forest fires like the 1988 Yellowstone blaze 
("The biggest difference between this year and other years is no rain," the 
park ecologist Donald Despain said after the fire). As usual, no one knows 
exactly what will happen. 
</P>
<P>
But the computer model used by Syukuroa Manabe of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration insists there's a greater than 90% chance that soil 
moisture across North America, Western Europe and Siberia will decrease. 
</P>
<P>
An obvious question is what all this means for agriculture (or, since 
"agriculture" has become abstracted from everyday life in the same fashion, as, 
say, "the military," it might be better to ask what this will mean as regards 
dinner). The answer comes on several levels, the first that of the individual 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
Quite apart from heat and drought, the simple increase in the amount of carbon 
dioxide in the atmosphere affects plants. Ninety percent of the dry weight of a 
plant comes from the conversion of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates by 
photosynthesis. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else limits a plant's growth -- if it has plenty of sunshine, water 
and nutrients -- then increased carbon dioxide should increase the yield. And 
in ideal laboratory conditions this is what happens: As a result, some 
journalists have rhapsodized about "super-cucumbers," and found other green 
linings to the cloud of greenhouse gas. 
</P>
<P>
But there are drawbacks. If some crops grow more quickly, farmers may need to 
buy more fertilizer. Leaves may become richer in carbon but poorer in nitrogen, 
reducing food quality not only for humans but for nitrogen-craving insects who 
may eat more leaf to get their fix. 
</P>
<P>
In the best case, direct effects of increased carbon dioxide on yield are 
expected to be small: Annual harvests of well-tended corn crops might rise 
about 5% when carbon dioxide levels reach 400 parts per million, all other 
things being equal. 
</P>
<P>
But all other things, of course, won't be equal. All other things -- moisture, 
temperature, growing season -- will be different. 
</P>
<P>
It is an obvious point, but one worth repeating: Everything we eat, except fish 
and a few hothouse vegetables, spends its growing life in the open air, 
"exposed," in the words of biologist Paul Waggoner, "to the annual lottery of 
the weather." Today's Lean Cuisine frozen entree stood rooted in some Kansas 
field last year, where it survived attacks from insects and disease, and grew 
as fast as its supply of water and sunshine and nutrients allowed. About 50 
million acres of America's cropland and rangeland is irrigated, but even that 
depends on the weather over any long stretch. And we can't just stick the wheat 
crop under glass. 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty ahead, in other words, extends to the pastures and the fields 
-- to our food supply. Too many unknowns and too many variables make even the 
broadest predictions difficult. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, there is a strong temptation to clutch at every reassurance: If the 
models say there will be enough food to go around, whew! 
</P>
<P>
 But when computers are modeling something as complex as all of agriculture, 
the potential for error is enormous (or the potential for accuracy is small). 
</P>
<P>
The effect of the heat and drought of 1988 made liars of most of the computer 
programs in just a few weeks. They had concluded that a doubling of carbon 
dioxide, which will not happen for several decades, might make the weather hot 
and dry enough to cut American corn and soybean yields as much as 27%. But in 
the summer of 1988, when the rains held off, the American corn crop fell more 
than 35%, down 2.6 billion bushels. 
</P>
<P>
Even if, as seems likely, the heat wave had little to do with the greenhouse 
effect, we now have some idea of what it will feel like once it does kick in. 
By early this year, grain storage around the world amounted to only about 250 
million metric tons, enough to last 54 days -- the lowest level since 1973. 
Worldwide consumption of grain outpaced worldwide production by 152 million 
metric tons last year. 
</P>
<P>
One can run a budget deficit for quite a while, but when the food runs out 
there's no central bank to mint some more. A second year of drought would be a 
"catastrophe," the assistant secretary of agriculture said. "If we return to a 
normal situation in the weather, we'll be OK," said Nelson Denlinger, executive 
vice president of the United States Wheat Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no normal situation in the weather to return to -- that's the 
point. The weather of the future cannot be predicted from the weather of the 
past, nor can its effects.

FIRST PERSON: THE BERLIN WALL ATTRACTS THE SOBER, THE SOMBER AND THE SILLY

Nigh on to midnight, a hundred yards down from the TV news scaffolds at the 
Brandenburg Gate, the Berlin Wall did not sound like the concrete belt that 
enclasps the Warsaw Pact. It sounded like a coal mine. 
</P>
<P>
In the dark beyond the reach of East German lights, to the singing whang of 
tempered steel against concrete, the wall was still coming down, one Genuine 
Authentic Souvenir Chip at a time. With penknives, chisels, crowbars, by 
moonlight, by flashlight, by -- for canny wholesalers -- car headlights, six 
days of trophy-hunting by thousands of people was making a sieve of the Cold 
War's most concrete emblem. 
</P>
<P>
A sweaty American student was hard at it, his face lighted only by the sparks 
his hammer made as it hit the wall. Two young women bent to catch the splinters 
like coins cascading from a slot machine. 
</P>
<P>
"So where you guys from, man?" He did not stop flailing as he spoke. Los 
Angeles, University of Southern California, said one of the students I was 
with. His arm stopped swinging, and he looked up. "USC? (Expletive) you guys!" 
he said, ardently, easily. One of his companions explained. They went to UCLA, 
see, and there was a big SC-UCLA football game the next day, so. . . . 
</P>
<P>
So what? I thought. Farther down the wall, another American student chipped 
doggedly away at the wall, because "I got a friend who's really into German 
history and all that crap." Why then were these young men here, in the white 
heat of events, if history was "crap" to one and it took a college football 
game to impassion the other? 
</P>
<P>
Americans -- we're big, we're rich, we're here. Daylight along the wall showed 
just how many of us. The wall has invited graffiti from its first brick; 
indeed, in places one can flake away almost three decades' worth of layered 
messages. If Kilroy had been here before, "Animal House" was here now: 
</P>
<P>
"Byron + Kim." 
</P>
<P>
"Maui Class of 90 Rules." 
</P>
<P>
"We Should've Crushed 'Em in '45" (at least they got the year right). 
</P>
<P>
"PINK FLOYED" (a rock band, its name misspelled). 
</P>
<P>
"BON SCOTT" (a heavy-metal rocker who, I am told, choked to death on his own 
vomit by the roadside). 
</P>
<P>
Banalities had defaced several durable graffito works, like the vast skull 
whose eyes were the skyline of the Wall and East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The profound, heartfelt remarks were there, as well -- "Don't Forget Rumania" . 
. . "Make Love Not Wall" . . . "Papa Ich Liebe Dich" (Papa I love you). But 
they were rather edged out in the spray-painted jumble; just as everyone wanted 
to take a piece of the wall away, equally strong was the impulse to leave 
something of oneself behind. 
</P>
<P>
That student would have been untrue to his credo had he known he was 
paraphrasing Henry Ford, who said "history is bunk." 
</P>
<P>
History here was not just bunk. It was an excellent excuse to party, to employ 
an adjective and a verb much favored by such students, who seem to drift about 
the world with Daddy's plastic, rich, mobile, incurious, uninformed, unmoved. 
Don't enlighten me, they seem to say -- entertain me. They big-footed into 
Berlin crowing like Super Bowl winners in a game they hadn't even been playing 
in. We're Americans, right? First you win, then you celebrate. They looked on 
Berlin as both -- a victory, and a party. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, Joe College -- you've just won the Cold War. Whaddya gonna do now? I'm 
going to Disneyland, dude! 
</P>
<P>
A German-born woman visiting here with her daughter, a teacher, said one of her 
daughter's American students had remarked that, you know, this was the best 
time he'd had all semester. How could he know anything? she said angrily. All 
he did was sit in a bar and drink Southern Comfort -- he didn't even try the 
local beer. One of my students cringed so at such behavior that when someone 
asked where she was from, she said, "Canada." 
</P>
<P>
Now I must make my disclaimer. Not everyone acted so. Not every student was 
heedless. Some, drawn by the TV lights, knew vaguely that something of vast and 
solemn consequence was going on here. My own students were awe-struck and 
tearful to be at the fulcrum at the moment when the balance of the world 
tipped. 
</P>
<P>
Not every adult was dignified. The clothes we found exuberantly discarded a few 
feet from the wall were German-made. (I can't swear as to the provenance of the 
condoms). It was a West German who had set up an impromptu shop on an ice 
chest, selling pieces of the wall, 1, 5 and 10 marks. Anyone with a length of 
pipe took a satisfying swipe at the wall, like Highland warriors once 
triumphantly danced over the bodies of their slain enemies. In these days, when 
everyone expected the Brandenburg Gate to open momentarily, it was feverishly 
festive. 
</P>
<P>
People handed carnations up to East German border guards, shook their hands 
through the holes hewn in the wall. Four of them, watching a crowd of us from a 
barred fourth-floor window, smiled at our smiles, blew kisses to our kisses, 
and looked regretful when we beckoned. 
</P>
<P>
As East Germans queued to go west ("They came, they saw, they went shopping," 
someone wrote on the wall), Western tourists abandoned the fleshpots of the 
Ku'Damm to stroll the length of the wall, sipping mulled wine, 2 marks a cup 
ladled out wherever someone had room for a folding table and an eye to a quick 
bit of money. A father set his little boy on his shoulders to hand a guard some 
bananas, the party favor of this new politics. 
</P>
<P>
It must have been 1 o'clock one very cold morning, 200 yards from Checkpoint 
Charlie, when several of us sat atop the wall and talked for half an hour in 
clumsy phrase-book German and many hand gestures to three young border guards. 
One of my students dropped a piece of paper down; she wanted his address. He 
wrote it out, rolling it and sticking it in the barrel of his gun and handed it 
back up. 
</P>
<P>
An American soldier from Louisville, Ky., had driven out to Potsdamer Platz 
with some of his family. After 18 months here, he knew the lore already, but 
now it was becoming as dated as a Greek myth. See that patched-up spot in the 
wall, where a hole had once been repaired? The West Berliners, he said, used to 
tell their kids that if they got too close the East German guards would grab 
them and yank them through, like uniformed gremlins in some updated Brothers 
Grimm story. Now the lights from the barren eastern stretch shone through the 
holes made by pickaxes and chisels wielded on the west. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to believe that this is the same place, he said. A month ago you'd a 
been shot for doing stuff like that. He hefted a chunk of wall -- a chunk of 
history -- into the trunk of his car. It was a Ford.

FACTORY HAS SCOOP ON OLD-FASHIONED ICE CREAM; 
</P>
<P>
FOOD: THE HERSHEY CREAMERY -- ONE OF THE LAST INDEPENDENT ICE-CREAM 
MANUFACTURERS -- CONTINUES TO PRODUCE TIMELESS DAIRY TREATS.

<P>
It's a kid's fantasy: finding yourself inside an ice-cream factory where every 
breath is like a swirling icicle and every taste lingers like the longest day 
of summer. 
</P>
<P>
In a world rapidly being taken over by fancy-schmancy ice creams with foreign 
names and butterfat contents in the stratosphere, it's nice to know that a more 
traditional, comforting place exists. A place where there are 10-cent orange 
Popsicles, ice-cream sundaes with drizzles of chocolate -- a place where every 
Nutty finds its Buddy. 
</P>
<P>
This is the Hershey Creamery, an ice-cream factory (not related to the Hershey 
Foods Co.) near the banks of the Susquehanna. 
</P>
<P>
The Hershey Creamery -- one of the last remaining independent ice-cream 
manufacturers in the nation -- has been in operation since 1894 and is still 
selling mostly to mom-and-pop groceries in the Northeast. It has been run by 
the Holder family since the 1960s and is now run by the Holder brothers, Walter 
and George Jr. 
</P>
<P>
They were the lucky kids who got to spend the hottest summer days inside the 
cool factory. Those were the preautomated days, before the gleaming white 
mixing tanks would swoosh all the basics -- milk, sugar and corn syrup -- at 
the touch of a button. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you want to stop reading now, especially if you don't want to know a 
thing about ice cream, except the next time you're going to eat some, but 
consider this: As a nation, we collectively eat almost 1 billion gallons a 
year. The biggest ice-cream consumers are in the Northeast, followed by 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
People are always trying to figure out why we love it so much, why it remains 
our No. 1 favorite dessert. Self magazine even tried to explain the 
psychological hook of ice cream, and as you probably guessed, it's all related 
to childhood. "When you're good as a child, the reward is often an ice-cream 
cone," said Dean Krahn, director of the Eating Disorders Clinic at the 
University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Some explanations are simpler. Many of us remain little kids; some of us are 
remembering the sound of bells, first distant and then closer, signaling the 
arrival -- "Hurry up, Mom" -- of the ice-cream truck on our corner. Some 
remember the old-fashioned drugstores and parlors we went to, the kind where 
they used to give out free ice-cream sundaes on your birthday. 
</P>
<P>
So, if you don't want to spend a day at the ice-cream factory, if you don't 
want your pleasures demystified, then don't read any further. 
</P>
<P>
But maybe you'd like to come along for the tour at the Hershey's Creamery, a 
large modern factory, where the temperatures can dip to 40 degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
In a 24-hour, peak summer cycle, the equivalent of 50,000 gallons a day will be 
produced in the form of 3-gallon containers, half gallons, pints, quarts and 
two dozen ice-cream novelties, including the most popular -- Nutty Buddy cones 
and chocolate-wafer-covered ice-cream sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the factory, almost everywhere you turn, it's white and the floors are a 
little wet, a byproduct of the machines churning and spewing. 
</P>
<P>
About 225 people work here during the summer, most of them on the assembly 
lines, where they watch ice-cream bars come parading by the dozens, toss out 
the drippy ones, and package everything. Ice cream comes oozing out of 
Flex-Fill cylinders merging in a perfect balletic turn with cones, nuts, syrup 
and paper. The smell can be sticky-sweet, like overripe strawberries that have 
been in an airless room too long. The constant clackety-clack is not unlike 100 
manual typewriters going at full speed. 
</P>
<P>
Two women sit opposite each other, between them a short conveyor belt. Orange 
Squeezeup tubes, wrapped in blue-and-orange silvery paper, come four at a time. 
Each woman takes her turn. In less than a minute, she will have put a dozen 
tubes into a box. 
</P>
<P>
Two dozen wooden Popsicle sticks appear on the horizon on the Vita-Line 
machine. Next, they are covered with orange ice. Then they disappear for a 
moment. The next time you see them they are covered in paper. They come off the 
machine like little toy soldiers, then down the conveyor belt they go, where 
another woman will catch them and stuff them into boxes. 
</P>
<P>
In its simplest form, without giving away any trade secrets, here's how the 
process works every day during the peak season: At 3 p.m. each day, the raw 
ingredients are brought by trucks and poured into multistory silos. For the 
day's production, the factory will need 100,000 pounds of cream, 100,000 pounds 
of skim condensed milk, 50,000 pounds of liquid cane sugar and 50,000 pounds of 
liquid corn sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Tubes from the silos lead into the mixing areas where, at 7 p.m., the 
ingredients -- including 500,000 gallons of water -- are blended, pasteurized 
and homogenized, stabilized and emulsified in 500-gallon batches, containing 
varying percentages of the products. They are then transferred to 20 holding 
containers. It's all timed by computer and operated with the touch of a button. 
This process can handle 4,000 gallons of ice cream an hour. (A product can only 
be classified as ice cream, according to federal regulations, if it includes at 
least 10% solid milk products. Most ice cream contains from 10% to 16%, which 
is considered premium ice cream. Low-fat and frozen dessert products are also 
made at this plant.) 
</P>
<P>
At 4 a.m. (and later in the process as well), samples from the mixtures pass 
through the quality control lab, which looks like a well-stocked college lab 
room. In this lab, four technicians test the mixtures in petri dishes for 24 
hours for safety and the products in finished form for flavor and texture. 
Leftovers are stored in the lab freezer for employees. 
</P>
<P>
At 5 a.m., the mixtures are pumped into the 20 flavor vats. There are more than 
100 flavors including butterscotch ripple and peanut butter cup. (Vanilla still 
corners 25% of the market with chocolate just under 10% and strawberry at 6%.) 
These flavor vats are swirls of cream and goo. The chocolate syrup for 
flavoring and dipping is made in another part of the creamery. 
</P>
<P>
After 5 a.m., the production of novelty ice-cream products as well as the 
packaging of flavors begins. Every day, specific consumer demands are met, from 
Popsicles to brownie sundaes. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, they're trying to appeal to sophisticated tastes, said George Holder, the 
vice president in charge of production. "We just try to keep up with the times. 
It's a very competitive business we're in here." 
</P>
<P>
Here's what the factory produces in a 24-hour period: 
</P>
<P>
At the two stick novelty machines in 18-hour shifts: 25,000 dozen orange 
Popsicles and 25,000 dozen Strawberry Scooter bars. 
</P>
<P>
5,000 orange Squeezeups in an eight-hour shift. 
</P>
<P>
8,000 three-gallon ice-cream cartons. 
</P>
<P>
10,000 dozen Nutty-Buddy cones in an 18-hour shift. 
</P>
<P>
10,000 dozen ice-cream sundae cups. 
</P>
<P>
30,000 half gallons of ice cream in a 10-hour shift. 
</P>
<P>
50,000 pints of ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
After the ice cream is packaged, it is then sent for two hours through the 
hardening tunnel -- a long passageway -- that is kept at 40 degrees below zero. 
After that, the ice cream is stored in an enormous hardening room kept at 20 
degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
Soon the trucks will come and take the finished product away. And somewhere, 
some kid is clutching a few quarters and is ready to take a walk to the corner.

SALVAGING ARCHITECTURAL ANTIQUES;

DECORATING: THE GREAT AMERICAN SALVAGE CO. SEARCHES OUT CHOICE REMNANTS ALL 
OVER THE COUNTRY BEFORE OLD STRUCTURES ARE DEMOLISHED.

Paul Davis wants to point out that he is no champion of the wrecking ball. But 
he figures that if an old building has to be razed, there is no reason he 
shouldn't get a piece of it. 
</P>
<P>
Davis manages the local franchise of the Vermont-based Great American Salvage 
Co., which sends its employees all over the country in search of choice 
remnants from about-to-be-demolished structures. They're not after bricks and 
mortar, but the old mantels, stained-glass windows, claw-foot bathtubs and 
Grecian columns that characterized the periods in which the structures were 
built. They buy them, and resell them to homeowners and designers who want to 
decorate with the fragments of yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't compare it with today's materials," Davis said, running his hand 
over an oak mantel in his Aldie, Va., showroom. "Why do we like antiques? They 
have history. They exist in a time we didn't and in a way we didn't. We have a 
strong enough architectural heritage in this country . . . we should be saving 
these things." 
</P>
<P>
Not that he is in it just for love. There's a big market for architectural 
antiques, as they are called, and Davis is tapping it. Just two years after 
Great American Salvage opened in the Washington area, Davis has a computerized 
file of more than 1,000 clients. The clients will pay $3,200 for a cast-iron 
gate, circa 1840. Or $20 for a doorknob from the early 1920s. Or $725 for a 
china sink salvaged from the Plaza Hotel in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Davis concedes these prices are negotiable. If he is inspired by a client's 
decorating scheme, he might let something go for a few dollars more than what 
it cost him. Other times, he will hold out until someone meets his price. 
"Unlike the clothing business, there's no real wholesale-retail formula in 
salvaging," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So what do people do with this stuff? 
</P>
<P>
Myrna Firestone recently bought 32 iron pilasters -- short posts -- to decorate 
her garden and two Victorian-style balconies recently added to her Georgetown 
house. In their former life, the pilasters graced a turn-of-the-century state 
government building in Concord, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they really make the balconies," Firestone said of her purchase. "They 
give them that authenticity. . . . Otherwise, they might have possibly looked 
new, which would have been a disaster in Georgetown." 
</P>
<P>
Great American's pieces also are available for rent. Nordstrom here recently 
used a carousel horse from Great American Salvage in a window display. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the Aldie franchise, John Graham of Boyce, Va., says his venture 
into architectural antiques has not yet turned a profit. Part of the reason is 
the $300,000 he recently spent to move the business from a large room in 
Middleburg, Va., to its present location in a two-story Victorian house on 
Route 50. But Graham says it's mostly because "in this game, we turn an awful 
lot of money back into the material." Once a piece is purchased, it often has 
to be restored before it can be resold. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who was a painting conservator and restoration consultant before coming 
to Great American Salvage, occasionally restores some items himself. But he 
spends most of his time hunting for marble statues of Japanese goddesses, 
hand-carved carousel horses or tin bathtubs with oak rims. 
</P>
<P>
Davis also has the option of "purloining" a piece from one of four other 
stores, which are scattered along the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
It's all done in the name of that paramount principle of retailing: Get the 
customers what they want. But Davis' own motto probably differs from most. 
</P>
<P>
"This comes down to three main points," he said. "Salvage. Save. Sell."

<P>
For three strange weeks 200 years ago this past summer, France's countryside 
was gripped by an inexplicable terror. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors swept through towns and villages that bandits were about to seize the 
year's grain harvest. Peasants, weeping and shouting, took to the woods with 
pitchforks and muskets. Others crisscrossed the countryside in a blind panic, 
looting and burning chateaux and so terrifying the French aristocracy that they 
took steps to abolish what was left of the ancien regime, France's 
pre-revolution social order. 
</P>
<P>
La Grande Peur of 1789 is considered a pivotal event in the history of the 
French Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
But, like so many of the outbreaks of panic and bizarre behavior of medieval 
and early modern Europe, how and why it happened remain a puzzle to historians. 
</P>
<P>
Why, for example, did it occur in some parts of France but not in others? Why 
did the hysteria appear to affect entire communities simultaneously instead of 
spreading from house to house and town to town as panic ordinarily would? And 
what possible explanation, psychological or otherwise, could there be for 
spontaneous mass psychosis? 
</P>
<P>
According to a study by Mary Kilbourne Matossian, a University of Maryland 
historian, the mystery of La Grande Peur can be explained by the rye bread that 
was the bulk of the diet of French peasants of the period. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing on historical records, Matossian argues that the French countryside was 
in the grip of a massive outbreak of food poisoning brought on by a fungus that 
grows on rye grain and that produces a natural form of the hallucinogen LSD. 
</P>
<P>
Matossian's arguments appear in her recently published book, "Poisons of the 
Past: Molds, Epidemics, and History," a sweeping reinterpretation of European 
and American history in light of what people ate. 
</P>
<P>
In everything from the Black Plague of the 14th Century, to the witch trials of 
Salem, Mass., the religious revivals of the 18th Century and the population 
explosion of the early industrial revolution, Matossian maintains that serious 
outbreaks of microbiological contamination of the food supply played a large 
role in shaping social behavior and population patterns. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of her conclusions may be exaggerated," said William McNeill, a 
University of Chicago history professor. "It is almost always the case that 
when you find something new and write about it, the result is a rather lopsided 
picture. But she is on to a very significant point. This is something 
historians simply haven't thought of." 
</P>
<P>
Matossian's focus is on a fungus known as ergot, a highly toxic mold that under 
certain climatic conditions -- cold winters and wet, warm summers, in 
particular -- can grow and infect rye. 
</P>
<P>
Ergot is the fungus from which LSD was originally extracted. 
</P>
<P>
When consumed, even in minute quantities in flour made from infected rye, ergot 
can cause an astonishing range of symptoms -- including gangrene, fertility 
suppression, loss of motor control and severe hallucinations, delusions and 
even death. 
</P>
<P>
Ergot poisoning was a risk in pre-modern Europe, because, until the potato 
became the dietary staple of the lower classes in the late 18th and early 19th 
centuries, peasants north of the Alps and Pyrenees and those in Russia were 
heavily dependent on rye, a hardy crop that can grow in extreme climates and 
poor soils. 
</P>
<P>
By some estimates, peasants in the region ate as much as two to three pounds of 
rye bread a day, making them particularly susceptible to ergot poisoning when 
conditions favored its development. 
</P>
<P>
Matossian's approach is to try to account for outbreaks of bizarre behavior in 
a given area by looking at local food consumption patterns and climatic 
conditions over the previous growing season. 
</P>
<P>
In 1789, for example, the year of La Grand Peur, "France had not seen weather 
conditions so favorable to the growth of ergot on rye . . . since 1697, when 
reasonably complete records were first kept," she writes. 
</P>
<P>
First, an unusually cold winter weakened the rye, which is planted in the fall 
for harvest the following spring. A cold and humid spring then allowed the 
fungus to grow on the plants; a warm dry May promoted the spread of fungal 
spores; the warm, wet summer that followed was ideal for the formation of toxic 
alkaloids. 
</P>
<P>
Matossian uses the same analysis to explain the peculiar phenomenon of witch 
trials, which periodically gripped different parts of Europe in the Middle 
Ages. 
</P>
<P>
The symptoms normally associated with bewitchment, she says, are strikingly 
similar to the central nervous system disorders caused by ergotism: tremors, 
parasthesias (sensations of pricking, biting ants crawling on the skin), 
spasms, seizures, contractions of the face and eyes, hallucinations and panic 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The parts of Europe where witch trials were most common were cold and wet areas 
where rye was the staple. By contrast, in Ireland -- where the peasant diet 
consisted mainly of dairy products and oats -- witch trials were rare. 
</P>
<P>
Matossian is not the first to link witch persecution with food poisoning. At 
least one other researcher has suggested that ergotism played a role in the 
Salem witch trials of Colonial Massachusetts, a conclusion Matossian supports 
with evidence of an unusual amount of rye eating in Salem at the time of the 
outbreak and ideal climatic conditions in the previous year for ergot growth. 
</P>
<P>
Matossian's most original work concerns the historical debate about the causes 
of the European population explosion of the mid-18th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Some historians have proposed "the potato theory" of population growth, arguing 
that the introduction of the potato into the diet of northwestern Europe in the 
early 1800s so improved agricultural production that it was possible to sustain 
a larger population. 
</P>
<P>
To the potato theory, which has been attacked as an insufficient explanation 
for the dramatic population gains between 1750 and 1850, which in England and 
Wales averaged some 300%, Matossian adds a critical addendum: Perhaps, she 
says, the switch from cereals to potatoes helped population growth by 
eliminating a source of ergot toxins, which suppressed fertility and increased 
mortality. 
</P>
<P>
In Russia, where dietary changes happened much later than in Western Europe, 
Matossian cites statistics that show that as the consumption of rye dropped 
from 40.8% of total starches to 20.6% between 1885 and 1926 -- and potatoes 
grew from 17.5% to 37.4% in the same period -- infant mortality dropped from 
274 per thousand births to 172 and the death rate dropped from 34 per thousand 
to 19 per thousand. 
</P>
<P>
Matossian's evidence, throughout her book, is not proof. It is based on 
correlations, which are notorious for their potential to mislead. 
</P>
<P>
"I have written this book with a keen sense of limitation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a great deal of this kind of (correlative) hypothesis behind some of 
her assertions, and in that sense she is on treacherous ground," McNeill said.

Government Propaganda: Beijing's main art museum has opened an exhibit called 
"Baptism of Blood and Fire," an array of artwork glorifying the military 
assault that crushed this summer's pro-democracy movement. The China Art 
Gallery show of 113 paintings, photographs, sketches, cartoons and works of 
calligraphy is the government's latest effort to justify June's quelling of 
what it calls a "counterrevolutionary rebellion." The exhibit includes several 
paintings of wounded soldiers, one of whom shouts "I'm for the people, the 
people are for me" as he is helped through the smoke and fire of the June 
turmoil by a sympathetic citizen. SHAUNA SNOW

Sinatra to Cross the Line: Frank Sinatra said he will perform scheduled 
engagements at Bally's in Las Vegas Dec. 4-9 and Dec. 26-31 despite an ongoing 
strike by musicians. "The holiday season is here and it's time for everyone to 
get back to work," the singer said in a prepared statement. Sinatra refused to 
cross picket lines in Las Vegas for previous shows. The singer's decision was 
seen as a major blow to Musicians Local 369, which has been on strike against 
Bally's and four other resorts since summer. SHAUNA SNOW

Loring Gives Thanks: Actress and singer Gloria Loring hosts the third annual 
"Thanks for Giving" Juvenile Diabetes Foundation special Sunday on USA Cable 
Network. "I'm trying to save my son's life," Loring says of her work with the 
telethon-like program. Her 15-year-old son Brennan has the disease. Loring said 
the special, which airs from 4-8 p.m., raised almost $4 million for diabetes 
research last year, and that she hopes even more will be raised Sunday. The 
all-star lineup scheduled to appear with Loring includes Alabama, the Jets, 
Poison and the Oak Ridge Boys; as well as Mary Tyler Moore, Ed Asner, Fred 
Savage, Susan Ruttan, Belinda Carlisle, Richard Mulligan, Alan Thicke, Cheech 
Marin and Edward James Olmos. SHAUNA SNOW

Ironically, Donald Lipski's large untitled assemblage begins to breed life from 
industrial materials. A mammoth braid of nylon rope tied like a pony tail 
strongly suggests a sperm; a long glass pipe filled with water and pink rubber 
bands looks like intestines clogged with worms; a hovering steel-wool blimp 
high on the gallery wall recalls a strangely mechanical deep sea sponge. 
</P>
<P>
Lipski's artistic forays as a mad scientist have the spark of life, but lead a 
curiously tense existence. His female-shaped bass cello case with red fluid in 
its belly is suspended by a bail picker like a prisoner of the Inquisition. His 
two white, steel pylons bolted to big chunks of wood put a vise grip on the 
verdant book titled "Meat Under the Microscope"; they have enough aerobic 
pressure to make the whitewashed wood look flush with fresh blood. 
</P>
<P>
Biological allusions are frequently subtle: as much due to the weird visual 
logic created by the assemblage as to the hardware the artist uses. Pieces give 
the gallery the feel of an underwater junkyard where derelict devices have 
combined via spontaneous generation. Human Angst seems to have been genetically 
imprinted on these things when they were originally machined and Lipski 
unleashes it effortlessly with the assembly. Ultimately, that gives the work a 
biting cynicism. (Dorothy Goldeen Gallery, 1547 9th St., to Dec. 30.) SUVAN

In the '50s, art patron Peggy Guggenheim jokingly used to admonish sculptor 
Claire Falkenstein, "Now go home and do your knitting." In fact, the artist was 
painstakingly welding iron wire or bands fused with chunks of glass to create 
dense, glinting sculptural webs suggestive of molecular structure and 
biological growth patterns. Her affinity for fields of energy and rhythmic 
patterning -- visible even in early representational drawings -- was well 
suited to translating news from the world of science into tangible imagery. 
</P>
<P>
A zingy group of works from the past 60 years by Falkenstein -- still active at 
80 -- gives an idea of the breadth of her technically adventurous creations. 
They range from "Fluids in Motion" (1947), a Plexiglas relief lit by 
fluorescent lights, to "Predator" (1963), two tightly "knitted" enameled iron 
forms that surround, and are engulfed by, a shopping cart. Falkenstein welded 
slumping green glass wine jugs to metal ("Four Within a Structure"), painted on 
X-ray film ("Game") and made a shaped wood painting in 1948, decades before 
that approach was sanctioned by the contemporary art Establishment. When you 
plug in "Planet Mars" (1962), a piece of plastic filled with mercury glows red 
and yellow behind a scruffy tangle of painted iron. 
</P>
<P>
If some of her experiments seem rather clunky and quaint today, other pieces 
remain impressive. "Cellular" (1941), for which the artist made her own 
double-triangle frame, offers an engrossing play of shapes transformed from 
nature (a foot, a planet, an orbit), painted in a luscious medley of stinging 
green, salmon, lemon and pale purple. Even "DNA Molecule" (1970-71) -- 
concentric networks of curving copper forms twinkling with Venetian glass -- is 
hard to resist as it slowly and solemnly circles in opposing directions. It is 
a tribute to the optimism and investigative energies of the American modernist 
vision, of which Falkenstein remains a vigorous, witty and superbly intelligent 
proponent. (Jack Rutberg Fine Arts, Inc., 357 N. La Brea Ave., to Dec. 23.)

THE GALLERIES: WESTWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long on style but lapsing into formula, Ron Blumberg's palette knife paintings 
of Westwood during the 1950s and '60s have a lot in common with the environment 
they're shown in this time around. Westwood is fast becoming a glass and marble 
extension of downtown architectural banality. Blumberg's paintings take a 
similar hackneyed approach to rendering architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The artist lays in buildings with small flat blocks of color and tone that in 
their faceting recall the impressionistic color landscapes Cezanne painted at 
Aix. But Blumberg's plays with space and color seem like a stylized formula, 
pat and predictable. Fortunately, the same isn't true of the more wild and 
wooly pieces of landscape painting that enmesh the fledgling city in a vast and 
rustic wilderness. In paintings like "Bel-Air," a green hillside is a 
tempestuous sea of mark and bubbling color that percolates into the distant 
ocean while awash with the white flotsam of small rooftops. The unpredictable 
strength of rampant nature in this work and in "Fallen Tree" reasserts the 
power of painting to bring an emotional reality to life like an updated Van 
Gogh. That sensitivity and emotion is the spark missing from the downtown city 
paintings. (Feingarten Galleries, Westwood Place, 10866 Wilshire Blvd., to Dec. 
31.) -- S.G.

Pamela Holmes' painted hydro-stone wall reliefs strongly evoke space-program 
photographs of Earth. Almost radiant, the biomorphic shapes -- colored with 
rich earth tones and blues -- suggest the iridescent purity of the planet as 
seen from outer space. Holmes adds some welcome layers of metaphor to many of 
the pieces by making shapes suggest sprouting seeds or portions of the human 
body. Some strong pieces suggest human organs: hearts, lungs or wombs. A few 
like the phallus/esophagus/sprouting seed-shaped "Untitled 5" are infused with 
a strong libido. This layer of sexuality, inferring that the planet is a body 
capable of giving and sustaining life, reads as a buoyant declaration of 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
Tied in spirit and process to Symbolist thought, where art reaches for the 
spiritually infinite, these abstracted land and body organics cast our 
planetary pebble in space as an intimate, physical phenomenon. Holmes may have 
a Romantic base but her content, which brushes only lightly against parallels 
between mysticism and science, has distinct appeal for a modern psyche grown 
comfortable with considering the entire cosmos within a single drop of water.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUNSET BOULEVARD WIDENING PLAN APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council has approved a $716,000 project to widen Sunset 
Boulevard at Will Rogers State Park Road in Pacific Palisades, but it may be 
two years before motorists see an improvement of the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
City engineer Mike Stafford said work to widen the roadway by up to 16 feet, 
create a left-turn lane and install a traffic signal and other improvements is 
not scheduled to begin until April, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Widening and realigning Sunset Boulevard at nearby Evans Road was approved two 
years ago. The work is now scheduled to begin by May, 1992, he said.

There used to be a time in this country when old golfers, as well as old 
football players or fighters or other famous people, were put on a shelf and 
expected to live out their lives with their press clippings and memories of the 
night they fought the Bomber or won the Rose Bowl or shot a 30 on the back nine 
of the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, if you were celebrated enough you could open a bar, or sell insurance, or 
become a greeter in a restaurant. If you were really famous, maybe they made a 
movie about you or named a football field after you. Otherwise, you were 
yesterday's roses, a faded picture on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
That's all changing. Senioritis is becoming a way of life in the world of 
sports. Senior leagues, masters track meets, senior tours abound. 
</P>
<P>
Golf was the first to break the mold. Initially, golfers were as discarded as 
any other has-been athletes. Oh, they could get a club job teaching old ladies 
how to putt and selling alpacas on commission, and they could rig up a paying 
round with a club president but golf was not a high income proposition. 
</P>
<P>
The ability to play good golf probably persisted as it did in no other athletic 
enterprise. Still, it was not put to good use till, a few years ago, a New York 
television producer got the notion of putting something on called "The Legends 
Of Golf." 
</P>
<P>
America is a country which suffers acutely from lack of a royal family. So, it 
substitutes movie stars, pop musicians -- and athletic heroes. They are our 
archdukes, crown princes, marquises, earls, miladies. We invest our dreams, our 
fantasies in them. Their success becomes our success, they fail, we fail. 
Hardly a kid grows up in this country without a hero of his very own. In later 
years, no one will ever achieve quite that stature in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Older is better. Tony Rice is good but he's no George Gipp now, is he? If Joe 
DiMaggio walks in a roomful of people with Jose Canseco, whose autograph will 
they get? Will anybody ever write in a song, "Where did you go Jose Canseco?" 
If Bret Saberhagen arrives with Sandy Koufax, who will notice him? In the movie 
"Sunset Boulevard," Gloria Swanson strikes the right note for every nostalgia 
buff in the seats when she draws herself up and sniffs "We had faces in my day! 
We didn't need talk!" 
</P>
<P>
We are given to ancestor-worship. Everybody knows Alexander Hamilton but who 
can name any of the last 10 Secretaries of the Treasury? 
</P>
<P>
So, golf cashed in on this hunger for a better past. The Legends Of Golf gave 
rise to the senior tour which quickly eclipsed the modern ladies tour, the 
satellite tours and, in some cases, even the regular tour. 
</P>
<P>
The senior tour gave rise to the gimmick tour. You had partner-golf, you had 
scramble-golf, you had alternate-shot golf, you had men's and women's golf. 
</P>
<P>
The Skins Game which is contested down here at PGA West this weekend is the 
granddaddy of gimmickry. It is golf the way it is played at a thousand country 
clubs every weekend. Regular members never play that kind of antiseptic medal 
game favored by the tour week-in and week-out. It is a kind of audacious, 
wild-card kind of game with some of the refinements high-handicappers bring to 
their four-balls to keep them interesting. 
</P>
<P>
Each hole is a tournament in itself. And each hole is a press bet, in a sense. 
</P>
<P>
Here is the way it works: the format is match play. Four players. The winner of 
any one of the first six holes gets $15,000. If there is no winner -- and if 
one ties, all tie -- the money is carried over to the next hole. Holes six to 
12 pay $25,000 apiece and 12 to 18 pay $35,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Since you have to win the hole to collect, this could conceivably mean four 
players could be playing the 18th (or 19th or 20th) hole for the whole 
$450,000. The record is $240,000 won on one hole. 
</P>
<P>
Who do you get to play for this outrageous kind of money? 
</P>
<P>
Do you want youthful, supple skill? If so, you go to the tour. You pick, like, 
players in the top 20 money-winners from last year. This could get you a 
foursome which might have a Ken Green, or a Chip Beck, Joey Sindelar, David 
Frost or Jeff Sluman in it. 
</P>
<P>
Skins Game producer Don Ohlmeyer knows better than that. The Skins Game went 
for the peerage, not the proletariat. He picked the guys who were portraits in 
the clubhouse, not pictures in the paper. Jack Nicklaus has played in all of 
them (six). Arnold Palmer played in the first five, Gary Player in the first 
two. Lee Trevino has played in the last three. 
</P>
<P>
Only 10 players have carved up the Skins Game prize money ($2,700,000) in the 
six years since its inception. Palmer was phased out in 1987 (age 58). Fuzzy 
Zoeller took over for Gary Player in '85. Tom Watson was replaced by Lee 
Trevino in '86. Raymond Floyd took Zoeller's tee time last year and Curtis 
Strange was selected to represent the Young Turks contingent last year. Curtis 
repeats this year, but, of course, had to win U.S. Opens back-to-back to get 
the kind of recognizability this game requires. 
</P>
<P>
The foursome represents 135 tour tournaments won, nine U.S. Opens, five British 
Opens, nine PGA championships and seven Masters. And the star system is alive 
and well. In 1986, the Skins outdrew every major championship in golf in TV 
ratings. Last year, it finished second only to the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
The Skins Game is yet another demonstration we don't warehouse our great 
champions any more, or just trot them out to be a float in a Thanksgiving Day 
parade. Jack Nicklaus made $113,284 as the leading money winner on the tour in 
his third year, 1964. He has made $490,000 playing in six rounds in this 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Golf -- and sports -- has turned completely around since the days when to get 
old was to die out. As the old song goes, when your hair has turned to silver, 
they will love you just the same.

<P>
The Great One (and if you think that means Gretzky in these parts, forget it) 
recently summoned Indiana tailback Anthony Thompson to the school auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
There, in front of a standing-room-only audience of about 3,000 IU students, 
fabled Bob Knight, his basketball legend secure, showered Thompson, his 
football legend unfolding, with fawning praise. 
</P>
<P>
It was a strange, special, awkward scene. Thompson isn't fond of attention. It 
makes him uneasy, self-conscious. As a freshman, you would have needed a 
Jaws-of-Life machine to pry a word from him. Now, Thompson is more cooperative 
but no less hesitant to accept a compliment, even from the grand poobah 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
As Thompson stared at his shoes, Knight conducted a history lesson. He informed 
the audience that the first collegiate football game, between Princeton and 
Rutgers, was played 120 years ago. And in those 120 years, nobody -- not Pitt's 
Tony Dorsett, Syracuse's Ernie Davis or Jim Brown, Army's Glenn Davis, Texas' 
Earl Campbell, Ohio State's Archie Griffin . . . nobody -- has scored more 
touchdowns than the workaholic from Terre Haute, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
"Each of you is given a bag of tools and a book of rules," Knight gushed that 
day in his annual get-together with the students. "Here's a guy who has done as 
much with the tools he was given as any kid I've known. . . . As good a kid as 
I've ever seen come down the pike." 
</P>
<P>
You think Knight was saying this just because Thompson was standing nearby? 
Hardly. Knight already has asked Thompson to address the IU basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
And in a coaching class that he teaches at IU, Knight once asked his students 
to name the best athlete at the university. This being a basketball class, the 
names of several Indiana basketball players, past and present, were offered. 
Knight considered the candidates, but remained unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
Then someone suggested Thompson's name. 
</P>
<P>
Correct, said Knight. And did anybody notice, he added, that the best athlete 
just happened to be the one who worked the hardest? 
</P>
<P>
Thompson can't be for real, can he? He doesn't drink. Doesn't smoke. Worships 
his mother. Attends church. Attends classes. Visits elementary and junior high 
schools to preach about the evils of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Guys like Thompson don't wear football pads, they wear merit badges, cleric's 
collars. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson also has been known to carry a football on occasion. During his four 
seasons at IU, Thompson has lugged more leather than a skycap. It began in 
1986, eight games into the season, when he made his debut as a starter against 
Wisconsin. Indiana won that day, 21-7, a fact that was not lost on Hoosier 
Coach Bill Mallory. 
</P>
<P>
"What'd he have?" asked Mallory at game's end. 
</P>
<P>
He was told 207 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Not too bad," Mallory said. 
</P>
<P>
Now it takes three full pages of the Indiana football press guide to detail 
Thompson's college career, which ties him with Mallory and is only one page 
fewer than the exalted Knight receives in IU's basketball guide. Thompson needs 
every inch of the space, what with his statistics multiplying like spores. 
</P>
<P>
The local paper, the Herald-Telephone, recently used an entire front sports 
page to detail Thompson's numbers. And even in small type they were impressive. 
</P>
<P>
You know about the touchdowns. Thompson has scored 65 regular-season touchdowns 
and another three in bowl games. So maybe it wasn't a coincidence that one of 
Thompson's first interviews at IU was conducted in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
He also holds the NCAA record for most points scored in a career, 412 total and 
394 regular-season, and most yards rushing in a single game, 377 against 
Wisconsin on Nov. 11. This season he ranks first in rushing at 169.8 yards a 
game and scoring at 15.4 points, and he is third in all-purpose yardage at 
219.9 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Moving on to the Big Ten records, Thompson is the career leader in rushing 
attempts and touchdowns. And if he hadn't missed the first six weeks of 
practice as a freshman, who knows? More than likely, Archie Griffin's 
conference-record rushing total wouldn't be safe. After all, Thompson trails by 
only about 360 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, remember what he did against Wisconsin a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
IU assistant coach Buck Suhr and Thompson were on their way to speak to a 
junior high school assembly when someone showed them that Herald-Telephone 
sports page. Buhr looked at Thompson. Thompson looked at Suhr. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at what you've done!" Suhr said. 
</P>
<P>
And about that time, Suhr confronted Thompson with the running back's least 
favorite topic: the H-word . . . the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen, you have got a hell of a chance to win it," Suhr said. "Now let's go 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 2, New York's Downtown Athletic Club will present the winner with the 
famed stiff-arming statuette, though Thompson said he isn't even sure he'll 
attend the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Given the choice, he'd rather retire to the IU weight room, or visit his mother 
in Terre Haute, or pal around with some children. Anything, but step into the 
glare generated by his gaudy statistics. In fact, you half expect Thompson to 
request that there be a change in Indiana's offensive terminology, from I-back, 
to We-back. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a guy who legitimately doesn't enjoy all the hoopla of what he's done," 
Suhr said. "The things he enjoys is playing football and being around kids. 
He's like the Pied Piper: He loves them and they love him." 
</P>
<P>
Figures. Raised by his mother, Helen Allen, Thompson learned the value of love 
and discipline early. And although the family wasn't poor, it occasionally felt 
poverty nipping at its heels. Thompson shared a bed with his younger brother 
Ernie, who is a second-string IU flanker, for years. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, with financial success an NFL draft away, his tastes remain 
conservative and subtle. For instance, you don't need a pair of protective 
goggles to approach Thompson, as you might with the gold- and diamond-laden 
Deion (Prime Time) Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson doesn't court fame, he tolerates it. Playboy once asked him to appear 
in an issue that contained the magazine's preseason All-American team. He 
declined. He didn't think his mother, a devout Apostolic Baptist, would 
appreciate her son appearing in the same issue as Miss September. 
</P>
<P>
He agrees to interviews but doesn't embrace them. Pleasant, polite, punctual? 
Without a doubt. A quote machine? Rarely. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson wants to change his phone number, but hasn't had a spare moment. 
Agents call all the time. A first-round choice-to-be in the 1990 NFL draft, 
they know a meal ticket when they see it. 
</P>
<P>
Local community groups inquire about his speaking schedule. And dinner at an 
area restaurant has become a bit of an event, what with all the autograph 
requests. Thompson smiles and plugs along, which isn't a bad way to describe 
his playing style. 
</P>
<P>
Against Wisconsin three weeks ago, Thompson carried the ball 52 times. With the 
exception of IU quarterback Dave Schnell, that's more carries than the season 
totals of each of the remaining Hoosier offensive players. That's almost half 
as many carries as Purdue's leading rusher, Jerome Sparkman, has this year. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, though, Thompson never tires. He averages 33 carries a game and 
appears as lively on the last carry as the first. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa Coach Hayden Fry once surveyed the damage of a Thompson-led romp over his 
Hawkeyes and told reporters: "The good thing in that game is he never had a run 
over eight yards. The bad thing about it is I don't think he had one less than 
seven." 
</P>
<P>
His playing idol is Walter Payton, which explains a lot. Thompson wore the 
Chicago Bear running back's No. 34 in high school. He would generally just 
watch the Bears on television, or nothing at all. He acquired some of Payton's 
playing traits, most notably the ability to ignore pain. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember we were playing Ohio State and he got hit so hard that he landed on 
his head," Hoosier tackle Todd Oberdorf said. "He just hopped right up. It's 
when he gets hit the hardest that he pops up on his feet the quickest." 
</P>
<P>
Payton once invited Thompson, then a sophomore, to join him in several 
workouts. They traveled to the Hill, a landfill near Payton's suburban Chicago 
home. About 70 yards long, the Hill slopes at a 45-degree angle. Up and down 
the embankment they sprinted. During a brief rest, Thompson glanced down at his 
thighs. They were quivering. 
</P>
<P>
From that came part of the inspiration for Thompson's near-fanatical work 
ethic. You can imagine how much time he spends with barbells and the like. But 
he also is known to strap on a 30-pound vest and run the 76 steps of Memorial 
Stadium's bleacher section -- six times. Or he'll wear that same vest and then 
pull a weighted sled. Or slip into a pair of specially designed shoes that 
promote development of specific muscles. 
</P>
<P>
They keep detailed statistics in the football department, including second 
effort and broken tackles. Guess who leads those two categories? And Mallory 
enjoys counting the times Thompson has literally carried a pile of tacklers 
downfield. Against Wisconsin (sorry, Badgers), Mallory said Thompson dragged 
eight tacklers forward. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times that projector has been run back more than once on plays he's 
made," Mallory said. 
</P>
<P>
Mallory isn't one for hyperbole, but if it were up to him, the Downtown 
Athletic Club could immediately send their Heisman Trophy to the engraver's 
shop. And don't forget to spell Thompson's name right. 
</P>
<P>
"He epitomizes to me what I've always thought the Heisman should be," Mallory 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Which is to say that you get an entire package with Thompson: student, athlete, 
leader, the whole nine yards. Or in Thompson's case this season, the whole 
1,745 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Every once in a while I think about (the Heisman)," Thompson said. "But it's 
just secondary to me. I've never been an individual player. I've always been a 
team player and honors like that mean virtually nothing if you don't have a 
winning season." 
</P>
<P>
A winning season is one game away. If Indiana beats Purdue on Saturday the 
Hoosiers finish the year 6-5 and receive an invitation to play in the Freedom 
Bowl. It's not the Rose Bowl, but it's close -- just down the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
And even if Thompson arrives without a Heisman Trophy in his possession, nobody 
at Indiana will hold it against him. "He won't have to worry about how we 
feel," said Mallory, who credits Thompson for turning around a program in 
disarray. 
</P>
<P>
For Thompson, that's thanks enough. He'll take warm words over a cold statue 
any day.

HE'S WON THE HEART OF TEXAS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: PENDERS CAME FROM RHODE ISLAND TO SHOW LONGHORNS THERE IS 
MORE TO LIFE THAN FOOTBALL.

AUSTIN, Tex. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can a Connecticut Yankee be king of the basketball court deep in the heart of 
the Texas hill country? 
</P>
<P>
After all, this is the city of Threadgill's, where Janis Joplin washed down 
chicken-fried steak with a few bottles of beer; the town of the dearly departed 
Armadillo World Headquarters, where Willie Nelson donned a bandanna and reached 
for his 12-string guitar, the place Jerry Jeff Walker sang about rednecks. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when Tom Penders would have seemed out of place here and why 
not? After all, he was truly an East Coast-type of guy what with coaching jobs 
at Tufts, Columbia, Fordham and Rhode Island. But since he's transplanted 
himself, Penders sings a different tune as basketball coach at the University 
of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 44-year-old Tom Penders is winning so many games and influencing so 
many people in the state capital that some are willing to embrace this high 
school coach's son from Stratford, Conn., forgive him his roots and call him 
one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Earl Deathe, 65, once managed many of President Lyndon Johnson's business 
interests during Johnson's White House years and now owns a custom-made boot 
store on Cameron Road. Deathe gave Penders a pair of ostrich boots, his 
initials stitched into the leather uppers between a Longhorn steer and a 
basketball stitched on either side. 
</P>
<P>
"From the minute he landed here in Austin, he let it be known he would become a 
Texan," Deathe said. "I am damned proud to have him wearing my boots." 
</P>
<P>
Coming off a 25-9 season and an NCAA tournament appearance, Penders begins his 
second year at the end of the Longhorns' bench with expectations about as lofty 
as one of those high notes his good buddy Willie can yank right out of the air. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he is a fledgling Texan, Penders counts eight pairs of boots in his 
closet, each pair a gift. In his office behind his desk hangs a large oil 
painting of a longhorn steer standing at attention, given to him by Darrell 
Royal, the former Texas football coach and athletic director who was a member 
of the search committee that recommended Penders be hired. 
</P>
<P>
Royal said he has grown close to the new basketball coach and believes that 
where Penders grew up should have no effect on his coaching. In fact, Royal 
dislikes making too much of regional differences. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, we say thank and back east they may say think, but what's the big 
dee-ul?" Royal said. 
</P>
<P>
What, indeed? Penders, this kid who used to play croquet on the lawn in 
Connecticut, is getting invited to cow chip-throwing contests and a whole lot 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"I judged an Arabian horse show," Penders said. "They wanted somebody who 
didn't know anything about horses, so I guess I filled the bill. I also judged 
a fajitas cook-off. Ate 32 of them. I haven't had a beef fajita since and that 
was in July. I liked them before. 
</P>
<P>
"I was also guest grand marshal of a rodeo and wore a cowboy hat," he said. 
"I've got a bunch of those, too. One time, I went redfishing. In New York, you 
tell them that and they think you're looking for Communists." 
</P>
<P>
Here, though, the locals are looking for a few good seasons. If expectations 
are up, so is attendance. Last year, the Longhorns had the biggest increase of 
all Division I schools -- 5,983 a game. Many who probably came to see Penders' 
fast-paced game are convinced there are no longer only two sports at Texas: 
football and spring football. 
</P>
<P>
The Penders style of play is very much unlike that of his predecessor, Bob 
Weltlich, who employed a slowed-down, deliberate pace and who was fired after 
compiling a 77-98 record in six years. In keeping with the surroundings, the 
new Texas style is often called run and gun, but Penders has come up with his 
own name for it -- chuck and duck. 
</P>
<P>
"My idea is to get people back in our building, to create the old feeling they 
had here in the late 1970s with Abe Lemons," Penders said. 
</P>
<P>
Penders' eventual Texasization probably had its roots during the Lemons regime. 
Lemons, a crusty, cigar-smoking, wisecracking proponent of the run-and-gun 
style, coached the Longhorns to the National Invitation Tournament title in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
The Longhorns scored at least 100 points six times that season and were a 
popular draw at the Erwin Center. 
</P>
<P>
Lemons' popularity soared as well. Abe become something of a folk hero and 
alumni flocked to hear him speak. Lemons also used his notoriety to negotiate a 
better car deal for himself and his coaching staff, persuading local automobile 
dealer George Coffey to provide classier cars. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened, everybody was driving (Ford) Granadas and, you know, Texas is a 
big damn state," Lemons said. "It's 950 miles from one tip to the other. You 
get out there on those roads and you need something a little better. I thought, 
'What the hell is going on? I thought Texas people were supposed to be rich or 
something.' 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody asked me, if I could have any car I wanted, what would I drive and I 
said a Lincoln," he said. "Well, I got one. And then everybody else, they're 
all driving Oldsmobiles because Texas, you fight your way around that state in 
a damn Granada, time you get there, hell, you just want to drink. You don't 
want to recruit. I caused all that. 
</P>
<P>
"They're driving Olds, Buicks, but there ain't no more Granadas," Lemons said. 
"There's nothing wrong with a Granada, 'less you're going to Lubbock. There 
ain't nothing but a crow between here and Lubbock. Hitting the damn road, you 
jar your teeth out. You can't get in the damned thing anyway. It's all right 
for a golf coach." 
</P>
<P>
Lemons was riding high until DeLoss Dodds became athletic director. A 
no-nonsense administrator, Dodds was immediately at odds with Lemons' 
freewheeling style. After Lemons charged into the stands at a game to challenge 
some heckling fans in Arkansas in 1982, he was gone. Dodds, believing that 
Lemons had embarrassed the program, fired the coach at the end of the 1982 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I was ever guilty of was cussin' and smokin' cigars," said 
Lemons, back again as coach at Oklahoma City University, whence he came. "I 
caught a lot of flak for a lot of things. I never did take that game that 
serious." 
</P>
<P>
Dodds brought in Weltlich, a coach with whom he felt a shared philosophy. 
Weltlich, a disciple of Bobby Knight, had a style just the opposite of Lemons', 
on the court and off. Where Lemons coached run and gun, Weltlich stressed a 
controlled game. Where Lemons was open and expansive, Weltlich was guarded. 
Lemons' practices always were open, but Weltlich's were closed. 
</P>
<P>
There is certainly enough room in college basketball for two divergent styles, 
but Weltlich's apparently did not appeal to Texas fans. Attendance swooned and 
so did the Longhorns' fortunes. Weltlich's teams never broke 100 points in 175 
games and attendance in the 16,231-seat Erwin Center exceeded 4,500 only once 
in his last five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Dodds was forced to fire his own man with two years and an estimated $200,000 
left on Weltlich's contract. Weltlich was reassigned within the Texas athletic 
department as an assistant athletic director in charge of special projects. 
</P>
<P>
Weltlich was reluctant to discuss his firing or to say in detail what he thinks 
about Penders, who won 25 games with the players Weltlich recruited. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a no-win situation," Weltlich said. "But I do think Tom has done a great 
job with those kids." 
</P>
<P>
Lemons said it is no surprise to him that Penders transformed the Longhorns 
into a winning team. 
</P>
<P>
"All he did was take the same players Weltlich had and put them in another gear 
and have some fun," he said. "I don't think there's any doubt Penders is going 
to win. He's a nice person and he knows what he's doing and he makes the game 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
Said Penders: "In Bob's defense, he was following a legend. He may not have 
been following Darrell Royal in football, but he followed a guy who created a 
lot of excitement here, who was well liked by the fans." 
</P>
<P>
Car dealer Coffey, who ditched the program during the Weltlich regime, jumped 
back on board for Penders, with whom he often plays golf at Barton Creek 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, he wasn't here but a short time and he's walking around in cowboy boots, 
going to barbecues, doing anything to fit in," Coffey said. "And his style of 
basketball, well, it's like his personality. He's a more upbeat guy." 
</P>
<P>
Deathe, who made the boots country singer Paulette Carlson wore for her 
wedding, said Penders' stay at Texas makes him proud of his long association 
with the university. In 1942, Deathe was a Texas freshman teammate of a 
football player named Tom Landry. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between Tom and Bob Weltlich is as much between daylight and 
darkness," Deathe said. "Tom is just a real guy, that's all I can say." 
</P>
<P>
Penders, though, understands that winning, not personality, is what the game is 
really all about. 
</P>
<P>
"If Bob had won here, he would have done fine," Penders said. "But in the end, 
he was 20 games under .500. His personality was a lot different from Abe's, 
true, that often happens. A coach gets fired and they go to the other extreme. 
</P>
<P>
"When Bobby Knight leaves Indiana, as successful as Bobby Knight is, there'll 
be somebody in the (school) administration who will say, 'Let's get somebody 
totally different. We'll win here anyway.' Maybe they'll find out the hard way, 
which usually happens." 
</P>
<P>
Penders' journey here was a roundabout one. A basketball and baseball star at 
the University of Connecticut, he was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in 1967 
and played third base in the minor leagues. He hit .343 in Class A, but besides 
having problems hitting double-A pitching, Penders knew that Max Alvis was 
entrenched at third base with the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
His dad was a coach in his hometown of Stratford and Penders eventually got 
into the family business. After three years of high school coaching, he moved 
on to Tufts University in Medford, Mass., near Boston, in 1971. Tufts, which 
had just one winning season in the previous 20 years, finished 12-8. Penders 
was 24. 
</P>
<P>
After two more seasons at Tufts, four at Columbia and eight at Fordham, Penders 
got his big break at Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
In his two seasons there, the Rams went 20-10 and 28-7, the second season 
noteworthy for a spot in the sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament. The team was led 
by guard Tom Garrick, now with the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
"I can appreciate now what a great motivator he is," Garrick said. "He is real 
good at bringing the best out of you. He made us believe in ourselves. He would 
scream at you and get under your skin, but he was a friend. You always knew you 
could go to him with anything. 
</P>
<P>
Texas guard Travis Mays said of Penders: "He just said the way we were going to 
approach it is we were going to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Royal said he knew when he met Penders that the Easterner was the right choice. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me his dad was a high school coach and then he told me the stadium his 
dad worked in and coached in was named after him," Royal said. "That told me 
right there he was of good stock. There was surely nothing wrong with his dad. 
I'm a great believer in the apple theory. I don't think they fall too far from 
the tree." 
</P>
<P>
Penders is in the second year of a five-year contract that calls for him to get 
a base salary of $85,000, an annual expense bonus of $6,000 and a 
radio-television contract worth $40,000. A shoe contract negotiated by the 
university is thought to bring the total package to about $200,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
And the good life is getting better for Penders. He and his family are building 
a 4,000-square-foot home on an acre of land near Lake Austin. Lee Trevino is 
supposed to become a neighbor, but then, sports figures and celebrities always 
seem to be gathering around Penders, who went to a concert a few weeks ago and 
sat with singers Nelson and Kris Kristofferson. 
</P>
<P>
The Southwest Conference looks improved, with Arkansas beginning the season 
ranked in the top 20 and Houston appearing to be a probable tournament team, 
but Lemons figures Penders will get along just fine both on and off the court. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing he'll miss is all the Eastern notoriety those guys get," Lemons 
said. "If a guy can just rest his ego a little bit and not worry about the Big 
East being on TV every day . . . They're on more than 'Sanford and Son.' " 
</P>
<P>
And in the office of the new basketball coach at the University of Texas, the 
Connecticut boy looks around, comfortable in his surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
His silver belt buckle gleams as he hitches up his faded blue jeans, revealing 
his burnt orange cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll stay here for a while," Penders said. 
</P>
<P>
He sort of has to. He's got a golf date with Willie next week.

A Birmingham, Ala., judge who issued an arrest warrant for Siran Stacy said the 
Alabama tailback will be given extra time to pay off his fine for speeding and 
driving with a suspended license. 
</P>
<P>
North Courtland traffic court Judge Rod Alexander said he talked with Stacy 
Wednesday, a day after issuing the warrant for his arrest when he didn't 
complete payment on a $192 fine. He said Stacy misunderstood the instructions 
on the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy was ticketed earlier this fall for speeding and driving with a suspended 
license. He pleaded guilty to the charges at an Oct. 17 hearing and made 
partial payment on the fine, with instructions to pay the balance by Tuesday's 
court date. 
</P>
<P>
When payment was not received and Stacy did not appear in court, Alexander 
routinely issued the arrest warrant.

Seattle Seahawks safety Paul Moyer reportedly has a ruptured disk in his neck 
that will sideline him the rest of the season and could end his football 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Moyer suffered a reoccurrence of a "stinger" -- a burning sensation usually 
around the neck area -- in Sunday's loss to the New York Giants, said Dave 
Neubert, team spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Moyer has had the problem several times since he suffered a concussion in the 
Seahawks' Nov. 12 game against Cleveland and was sent to a specialist, Neubert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Reports say the examination revealed the ruptured disc.

SCAN REVEALS WORTHY IS ON GOOD FOOTING 
</P>

A bone scan of James Worthy's injured right foot on Wednesday reportedly showed 
no stress fracture, and the Laker forward practiced Thursday and is expected to 
play Saturday night when the Lakers meet the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy, the Lakers' leading scorer with a 21.2 average, has been periodically 
bothered by soreness in his foot. The pain flared again recently after Worthy 
suffered a sprained ankle on Nov. 9 against the Golden State Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Vitti, the Lakers' trainer, said Worthy has injured only "soft tissue" in 
his foot, perhaps overcompensating from his ankle injury and chronic tendinitis 
in his knees. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy said he is able to play with the soreness. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't worried about it being something (major) going on in there," Worthy 
said. "But I just wanted to get it X-rayed before we got too far into the 
season. Now, I can rule out (a stress fracture). It only gets stiff at times 
(during practice and games), like a few other injuries I've had for a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Worthy said the soreness in his right foot predates his ankle sprain. Worthy 
fractured his ankle during his freshman year at North Carolina in 1980, and he 
said he periodically has had pain in his foot since.

DIVAC SHOWS HE'S HEADY PLAYER; 
</P>
<P>
LAKERS: YUGOSLAV CENTER LEARNING THE WAYS OF A NEW COUNTRY, BUT HE ALREADY 
KNOWS THE GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On impulse, Vlade Divac took the basketball and repeatedly bounced it off his 
head, soccer style, during a break in a recent Laker practice. 
</P>
<P>
If his teammates did not already know Divac and his Yugoslav ways, they might 
have thought he was a case of arrested development. But no, this was just Vlade 
being Vlade, so the unusual sight of a grown man -- a 7-foot-1 center, no less 
-- acting like a human pinball machine hardly drew much attention. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers have accepted Divac, peculiarities and all. After just nine 
regular-season games, the former star of the 1988 Yugoslav Olympic team has 
proven himself a capable NBA player and a worthy addition to an eclectic team 
that includes an extrovert from Lansing, Mich.; a homeboy from Inglewood; a 
Southern gentleman from Gastonia, N.C.; an eccentric from the Bahamas, and a 
minister-in-training from Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Comfortable in his new surroundings and fluent enough in English, Divac 
occasionally participates in the customary locker-room banter and team bonding. 
</P>
<P>
Divac even quipped that he sometimes says unprintable things, in his native 
Serbo-Croatian, to NBA referees, "because they don't understand me." Divac then 
winked and added his favorite English expression: "No problem." 
</P>
<P>
Laker fans, it seems, also have embraced Divac and accorded him cult-hero 
status not experienced since Kurt Rambis left town. They cheer when Divac 
approaches the scorer's table to enter the game, and react even more strongly 
when he dribbles behind his back or scores on a spin move inside. More than 
once, Divac has raised his hands to acknowledge crowd response. 
</P>
<P>
But Divac, 21, is more than just a curiosity; he has already proven to be a 
quality player perhaps able to fill the Lakers' needs at center for many 
seasons to come. 
</P>
<P>
Early into this foreign-exchange program -- Yugoslavia sent a center; the 
Lakers sent cash -- Divac has averaged 7.7 points and 6.6 rebounds while 
playing only 16.1 minutes a game. Of the 25 rookies picked ahead of Divac in 
last June's draft, only six have better statistics, and all of those have 
played more than Divac. 
</P>
<P>
Divac, whose playing time as Mychal Thompson's backup figures to increase, will 
face his biggest tests so far in the Lakers' next three games, when the 
opposing centers will be Mark Eaton of Utah, David Robinson of San Antonio and 
Akeem Olajuwon of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Still, early results are impressive. Twice last week, Divac played significant 
roles in victories for the Lakers, whose 8-1 record is the NBA's best. 
</P>
<P>
Against Indiana last week, Divac scored 13 points, grabbed 11 rebounds and 
dazzled fans by diving on the floor, filling a lane on the fast break and even 
sinking a Yugoslav version of the sky hook. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, against the Washington Bullets, Divac scored 17 points in 17 minutes. 
During a four-minute stretch in the second quarter, when Divac replaced 
Thompson, the Lakers went from one point down to six ahead. Divac had nine of 
the Lakers' 16 points in that surge. 
</P>
<P>
"Vlade can play," Magic Johnson said. "He still has got a lot to learn, but we 
definitely know now he can play." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley still has to explain game plans and plays carefully to 
Divac and sometimes show him where to position himself. Divac also has problems 
on defense, since the NBA man-to-man style differs from the quasi-zone used 
throughout Europe. 
</P>
<P>
For the remainder of this season, Divac probably will continue to be the first 
big man off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Which is fine with him. Whenever asked, he says he does not mind coming off the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, no problem," Divac said. 
</P>
<P>
No problem is fast becoming Divac's signature phrase. Ever since translator 
Alex Omalev's contract was terminated after the exhibition season, Divac has 
been giving interviews in broken English and has had to translate Riley's 
catch-phrases on his own. 
</P>
<P>
Divac has improved his verbal skills immensely since he and wife Snevana 
arrived from Yugoslavia last August. They still have English lessons with 
linguist Diana Platt, and he also picks up jargon and builds his vocabulary by 
watching television. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still learning," Divac said, when asked about the language. "It (is) 
better now." 
</P>
<P>
Riley, however, still detects times when Divac gives him quizzical looks as if 
he has no idea what is being said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he understands better," Riley said. "But we still see him do things 
out there on the court that are (different) from what we thoroughly explained 
in pregame talks and walk-throughs. 
</P>
<P>
"I do see times when he doesn't understand what we're talking about. If you sit 
down and have a conversation with him, though, you don't think he needs much 
help." 
</P>
<P>
One day before the start of the season, Riley tried to show Divac how to 
double-team a player without being called for illegal defense. It was a comical 
scene, since illegal defense is difficult enough for American players to 
understand. Divac stood there with his brows furrowed, occasionally nodding. 
</P>
<P>
Mark McNamara, the Laker reserve center who is closest to Divac and actually 
has learned to speak a few sentences in Serbo-Croatian, said Divac's 
comprehension level varies. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes he understands everything, sometimes not a lot," McNamara said. "He 
told me something the other day. He said that when he is tired, he doesn't 
understand as much. I guess that's because he has to translate what you're 
saying in English, in his head, to his language. 
</P>
<P>
"I played in Italy and I found that to be the case when I was trying to learn 
Italian. After a tough practice, somebody'd say something to me, and it went 
right over my head. But I think Vlade has improved a lot. He's really picking 
up on the conversation end. He already knows all the basketball terms." 
</P>
<P>
Laker players and staff have spent considerable time tutoring Divac. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting in the ticket line for the team's flight back to Los Angeles from 
Hawaii, McNamara spent the entire time helping Divac pronounce, "Trans World 
Airlines," and learn the English words for various airline terms. 
</P>
<P>
Josh Rosenfeld, the Lakers' former public relations director, huddled with 
Divac after one practice and taught him how to read a statistics sheet, telling 
him that FGA stands for field goals attempted, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Language is not the only on-court adjustment Divac has made. He said his team 
in Yugoslavia, Partizan Belgrade, practiced twice a day but not nearly as hard 
or as long as the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
Asked which coach is more difficult to play for, Riley or Dule Vujosevic, his 
former coach in Belgrade, Divac smiled and said: 
</P>
<P>
"Riley is hardest-working, best coach in the world. We don't practice this much 
in Yugoslavia. We run more here. My coach in Belgrade younger. He is now in 
Spain. Riley make you run more." 
</P>
<P>
Everything is different here for Divac, but not frighteningly so. He said he is 
not homesick, although he misses his friends and family in Kraljevo and 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
"I call home every Saturday," Divac said. "Talk to my parents. My brother is 
coming to visit me the first week of December. I have a friend from Yugoslavia, 
John, that I know. He lives in Torrance. He's been here three years. I play 
tennis with him." 
</P>
<P>
Although Divac has not had time to make many friends in Los Angeles, he has met 
several Yugoslav expatriates and descendants. He recently was invited to a 
meeting of Yugoslav nationals in San Pedro but could not attend because of a 
scheduling conflict. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of disposition and attitude, Divac is little changed from when he 
emigrated to the United States about four months ago. He still drives a Toyota, 
although he says he is close to buying a Porsche he has been looking at since 
August. He and his wife live in the same Marina del Rey apartment complex as 
the Clippers' Charles Smith. 
</P>
<P>
After some friendly persuasion by teammates, Divac updated his wardrobe for 
trips. Other than that, he is the same guy. 
</P>
<P>
As a player, however, Divac has changed for the better. 
</P>
<P>
Many NBA teams reportedly passed on Divac -- he originally was projected as a 
middle first-round choice -- because he spoke almost no English and was more of 
a finesse center than a physical one. 
</P>
<P>
When Divac made his debut late last summer in the summer pro league at Loyola 
Marymount, he impressed Riley in only a few areas. At the time, Riley called 
Divac "a project," meaning he was at least a year away from helping the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
But after two weeks at a special Big Man Camp conducted by Pete Newell and 
special weightlifting and running programs, Divac had progressed. His low-post 
defense was still weak in training camp but has steadily improved since then. 
</P>
<P>
Riley has long since dropped the "project" label when talking about Divac, 
although he said the Yugoslav still has much to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"When we drafted Vlade, all I saw of him was one or two films," Riley said. "I 
saw a player who was 7-1, who looked a little weak. But I did see some nice 
skills that he had. I didn't think he was as good as he is. I didn't know him 
as a person. He's a great person, a very intelligent person. He picks things up 
very well. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think the one thing we didn't realize is that he really knows how to 
play basketball. He's got that basketball sense. He has exceeded my 
expectations." 
</P>
<P>
Riley, a demanding coach, said he expects more from Divac. Defensively, he is 
still being outmuscled by bigger centers and, as evidenced in Sunday's victory 
over Washington, beaten by smaller, quicker centers. 
</P>
<P>
"From the summer league, he's really improved his defense," Riley said. "First 
of all, philosophically, he has changed. They used to teach him to play behind 
guys. When we saw (players) back him up in the summer league and dunk over him 
about four times, we said, 'Hey, we're in trouble here.' But Bill (Bertka, an 
assistant coach) has worked with Vlade. His defensive technique is better, but 
his positioning needs work. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows what we want. I believe as he gets stronger and learns hows to apply 
more technique, that'll change. Mychal is a good teacher. He's trying to help 
him. Mychal is one of the best at using the size you do have. 
</P>
<P>
"Vlade is not Akeem Olajuwon. He's not Robert Parish or Patrick Ewing. He's 
different. He reminds me of a 7-1 Alvan Adams. He's got a lot of agility, great 
footwork offensively and is a good passer. We're finding out exactly what he 
can do." 
</P>
<P>
The more the Lakers see of Divac, the more they like. Riley, usually hesitant 
to play rookies early (or even late) in the season, said Divac is an exception, 
adding: 
</P>
<P>
"He's got great international experience. He's been in a lot of big games, 
World Cup games, and for the Yugoslavs against the Russians. He's ready for 
this type of competition. I think of Vlade as a five-year veteran." 
</P>
<P>
The coach has one quibble. He does not like Divac's habit of throwing 
crowd-stirring, behind-the-back passes. Twice this season, Riley has taken 
Divac out of a game because of it. 
</P>
<P>
"He has to know this isn't the Harlem Globetrotters," Riley said. "We don't 
play to the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
Divac, who says such moves have long been part of his game, said he would be 
willing to stop doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"No problem," he said, shaking his head.

EVANGELICALS, CATHOLICS FIGHT FOR LATINO SOULS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The continual stream of Latino immigrants into Orange County has sparked a 
battle for their souls that church leaders predict will last throughout the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The struggle has pitted the Catholic Church, for centuries the predominant 
religion among Latinos, against evangelical Christian groups competing with 
increasing success for Latino converts. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, besieged Catholic leaders are now being forced to grapple with the 
realities of a rapidly transforming flock -- an issue they say they can no 
longer ignore. While Latinos will comprise the majority Catholic group in the 
next 10 years, the church lacks enough Spanish-speaking priests or those with 
adequate knowledge of Mexican, Central American and South American religious 
customs. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials are particularly concerned about the defection among Catholic 
immigrants, but also worry about losing Latinos who have lived here all their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
"With the absolute explosion of the immigrant population, the church hasn't 
been able to keep up," said Jaime Soto, the Diocese of Orange's Vicar to 
Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, the county estimated its Latino population at 7.2%. The RAND Corp. 
estimated the 1985 figure at 16% and predicts a 21% Latino population by the 
year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Many newly arrived Latinos hunger for a passionate, inspiring ministry that 
reaches them on a deep emotional level, say observers. An increasing number 
come to Orange County already converted to Protestant sects. And 23% of Latinos 
in the United States now identify themselves as Protestant, said Tom W. Smith, 
director of the General Social Survey for the Chicago-based National Opinion 
Research Center. According to Gallup polls, the figure was 19% in 1986 and 16% 
in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
The fastest-growing local Latino churches are charismatic, where immigrants 
find emotional, spirit-laden services, lively music and lay leadership, said 
Carlos Piar, lecturer in religious studies at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"There's none of the staid organ hymns, Gregorian-chants type of thing," said 
Piar, former pastor of the Spanish-language Emanuel Baptist Church in 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
As the rivalry grows, it evokes anxiety and accusations. 
</P>
<P>
Catholics complain that their competitors' "anti-Catholic" tactics have torn 
Latinos from their roots. 
</P>
<P>
"My one big complaint with the Pentecostals is that I have consistently 
encountered an anti-Catholic edge which seems to undercut of the positive 
aspects of Christianity in this country," said Soto. "It disturbs me with this 
new immigrant population." 
</P>
<P>
One Catholic seminary student, whose family migrated from Mexico 10 years ago, 
said his two brothers, converts to Jehovah's Witnesses, called him an 
"anti-Christ" and refused to talk to him for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been dividing my family against me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Protestant evangelicals such as Daniel de Leon, pastor of Templo Calvario 
in Santa Ana, say they are only responding to needs the Catholic Church has 
left unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
"A little sheep, if not fed by the shepherd, will go looking somewhere else for 
food," said de Leon, whose 3,000-member church is one of the largest Latino 
evangelical churches in the country. His church had just 100 members in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
He predicts that the rivalry for souls will continue for years. 
</P>
<P>
"If the economic, social and political problems persist in Latin America, we 
will continue to see a great influx of Latins in our country. Obviously, the 
Hispanic church in America will have a great opportunity to win them over to 
Christ," de Leon said. 
</P>
<P>
At a Sunday Spanish-language service, the sanctuary was packed with 
well-dressed men, women and children. On the altar, flanked by an American flag 
and a Christian flag, a band played beneath a lighted cross. De Leon says he 
does not advertise because there is no more room on Sundays in the 
60,000-square-foot condominium-style converted warehouse that holds the 
sanctuary and offices. 
</P>
<P>
As the congregation sang hymns in Spanish, ushers passed red velvet bags for 
the collection. On an average Sunday, the church collects $18,000, de Leon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The money comes from believers like Frank Lopez, 32, a junior high school 
dropout who spent 12 years in prison before turning to religion. Even when he 
cannot afford to pay his bills or buy groceries, Lopez said, he tithes to the 
church. When he gives, he said, his landscape maintenance business grows and 
his family becomes closer. He plans to earn his high school diploma and further 
his training to become a counselor. 
</P>
<P>
With a $1-million annual budget, Templo Calvario has opened 40 missions 
associated with the Assembly of God in Latin America and two in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
De Leon says he plans to expand his congregation to 6,000 during the 1990s and 
establish 15 new churches in the United States. The first one, Templo Calvario 
in Riverside, was launched in August. Under the leadership of de Leon's 
brother, Lee, the church will open for services Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
At Santa Ana's Centro Cristiano, another of the 40 Spanish-language evangelical 
congregations in Orange County, many immigrants gather several times a week to 
worship. On hard pews arranged in a warehouse, they sing, beat tambourines in 
time to lively Latin music, offer testimony in Spanish, speak in tongues and 
take part in faith-healing ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
Member Angie Martinez, a single mother of two, said the faith she found in the 
Pentecostal church helped her to forgive the husband who deserted her and to 
look forward to a 10-hour-a-day job as an electronics assembler. "I saw joy and 
happiness here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The last survey of Latino Protestant churches in Southern California, in 1985, 
showed 80 congregations in Orange County and 687 in Los Angeles County. Those 
figures have increased about 10% each year since, said Clifton Holland, 
president of the Orange-based In-Depth Evangelism Associates, a nonprofit 
research organization. 
</P>
<P>
The Protestants' success is forcing soul-searching not only among Orange County 
Catholics, but at local and national levels. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Church will need to abandon its "ostrich mentality" regarding the 
mushrooming numbers of Latino immigrants on its doorstep, said Father John 
Lenihan, pastor of St. Boniface Catholic Church, an Anaheim parish where 
Latinos are the majority group. Faced for years with the fact of massive 
immigration, many Catholics thought "if you don't see it, it might go away, or 
they hoped they would be Anglicized, or capable in the English language," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
While 50% of the 700,000-member Orange Diocese is Latino, only 17%, or 40 of 
225 priests, are Latino, according to diocese statistics. Only 60 of 353 masses 
are celebrated in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
While the ratio of priests is 1 to every 2,000 Catholics countywide, it is only 
1 to 8,000 Latino Catholics. Not only does the diocese need more 
Spanish-speaking clergy, but also those who understand cultural customs such as 
quinceanera, a religious coming-out ceremony for 15-year-old girls, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Diocesan priests in Los Angeles and Orange counties have been required since 
1987 to learn Spanish before being ordained at St. John's Seminary in 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
But considering the continued shortage of priests of any ethnicity, Soto said, 
"Our great hope is the Hispanic people themselves, especially in the lay 
movements." 
</P>
<P>
A variety of lay movements, called comunidades de base, or base communities, 
has taken hold at Anaheim's St. Boniface, a parish that has evolved from 20% to 
50% Latino in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
In many respects, the techniques used to attract Latinos mirror those of the 
evangelical Protestants. 
</P>
<P>
The church has a 200-member charismatic prayer group, a Youth For Christ or 
Jovenes Para Christo group, a weekend retreat called cursillo, marriage 
encounter, and door-to-door evangelizing to barrio immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Delia Varela, a Catholic immigrant from Mexico, visits her neighbors in Anaheim 
to explain her faith and help with their problems. She said people are unused 
to seeing a Catholic with a Bible and often mistake her for a Protestant. She 
believes living by the Catholic rules is more difficult for people than 
Protestantism and said many people have converted because the evangelical 
churches give them money, food or gifts. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hispanic coming up from South America is nominally Catholic for the most 
part," said Father John Lenihan, the parish priest. "They are usually very 
uneducated in their Catholic faith, which renders them very susceptible to a 
strong personalized outreach." 
</P>
<P>
Combating Protestants is a full-time occupation for Karl Keating, founder of 
the San Diego-based Catholic Answers. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, a former lawyer, said he uses both emotion and doctrine to bring back

stress biblical rather than papal authority. "If you don't talk Bible verses 
and meanings, they won't take you seriously and they shouldn't.

"Our position is the Catholic Church is true and, all things being equal, one 
has a better chance of getting to heaven as a Catholic than a non-Catholic."

Catholics are "still playing catch-up," Keating said. "It will take awhile. In 
20 years we'll be every bit as prominent in evangelization as the 
fundamentalist churches, even more so."

LATINOS AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH -- Waves of Latino immigrants to Orange County 
are forcing the Catholic Church to re-examine the services being provided to 
its changing flock. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the 700,000-member Diocese in the county is estimated to be Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Only 60 out of 353 masses held in Orange County are celebrated in Spanish.

<P>
Out of 225 priests in the county, only 40 are Latino.

CHRISTMAS TREE WARS: Fashion Island once boasted that the eight-story white 
firs erected there each Christmastime were the tallest in the nation, but the 
Douglas fir at the National Enquirer's offices in Florida proved to be one 
story taller. . . . After winning that commercial tree derby in 1987, the 
Enquirer retired from competition, but Florida seems intent on regaining the 
title. . . . This year's 110-footer at Fashion Island will come up short when 
Miami unveils it 144-foot tree. . . . The all-time record: a 221-foot Douglas 
fir at a Seattle shopping center in 1950. Steve Emmons

BONANZA: The holidays mark the beginning of the annual California gold rush for 
store owners -- and in Orange County in particular. . . . The average 
general-merchandise store here grossed $3.9 million last December, much higher 
than the $3-million national average. . . . Yet, the mother lode is even richer 
elsewhere. The average was higher in Los Angeles, Oakland, San Jose, Newark, 
N.J., and Bridgeport, Conn. . . . The highest average was in New York City, a 
whopping $8.4 million. Steve Emmons

BIG BUCKS: Holiday shoppers spent more in Orange County stores last year than 
the gross national products of 67 nations, including Liberia and Nicaragua. . . 
. From October, when merchants begin their holiday hiring, through Christmas, 
shoppers spent an estimated $2.19 billion to $2.73 billion on apparel, jewelry, 
appliances and the like. . . . The county's 79 general-merchandise stores took 
in $307.7 million in December alone. Steve Emmons

PHYSICIAN SAYS HOLIDAY BIRD IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL TURKEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN R. CHURM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wait! Before you carve any more leftover turkey, consider this: Gobbling that 
bird may be hazardous to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
To be "ecologically in tune," physician Michael Klaper says you should scrap 
that turkey in favor of a yummy wild rice casserole. It's more healthful, he 
preaches, and it makes sense environmentally. 
</P>
<P>
According to the good doctor, preparing the casserole requires a fraction of 
the land, water and energy needed to raise and market turkeys. 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute, you interrupt. Abandon turkey, a tradition in your house since 
your ancestors beached their boats near Plymouth Rock? Can't do it! 
</P>
<P>
Nonsense, says Klaper, a well-known author in vegetarian circles. He argues 
it's time to throw out old eating habits and adopt new ones. We must forsake 
our meat-based diet in exchange for one chock full of fruits, vegetables and 
whole grain goodies -- pasta, breads and rice -- not merely to improve the body 
but, more important, to help "heal the Earth," he says. It's a 1990-ish kind of 
thing to do, largely because the Earth's environment is in sad repair, Klaper 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother Nature is waving red flags all over," the Seattle physician said in an 
interview before lecturing recently in Huntington Beach. "Our topsoil is 
eroding, our water is polluted and being wasted and our atmosphere is breaking 
down because of the large-scale production of animal flesh. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't keep doing it. We have to change a lot of things -- the fuel in our 
cars, our energy sources and our mode of transportation. And we've got to 
change our diet." 
</P>
<P>
Persuasive stuff, but try telling that to a confirmed meat-eater dining at a 
hamburger haven. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm hungry, which happens about five times a day, I want a cheeseburger, 
the kind that oozes juice," said Mike Hardy, a burly Costa Mesa patio installer 
as he launched into his second quarter-pounder at McDonald's this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I start my day at 6 in the morning, and by lunchtime I want something with 
substance," he said between mouthfuls of burger. "I'm in no mood for sprouts 
and tomatoes between slices of wheat bread. I'm for the environment, but I've 
got to eat." 
</P>
<P>
Klaper, a general practitioner, concedes winning converts to his way of 
thinking will take time -- lots of it. 
</P>
<P>
But he has plunged full time into selling his theories at lectures and in 
books. He is the author of "Pregnancy, Children and the Vegan Diet" as well as 
"Vegan Nutrition: Pure and Simple." Television is the next conduit as he and 
his partner, John Robbins, author of the Pulitzer Prize-nominated "Diet for a 
New America," seek to spread their message about diet and the environment to a 
wider audience. 
</P>
<P>
Klaper and Robbins, the one-time heir to the Baskin-Robbins ice cream fortune, 
teamed up two years ago, about the same time Robbins started the EarthSave 
Foundation, a nonprofit environmental education group. What intrigued Klaper 
were Robbins' warnings about the damaging effects that the average meat-based 
diet inflicts upon nature. A vegetarian for more than a decade, the 40-year-old 
Klaper understood the health benefits of a diet structured around fruits and 
vegetables. But Robbins was one of the first to suggest that livestock and 
poultry production was ruining the environment by using a disproportionate 
amount of natural resources, a concept that made sense to Klaper. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Klaper is the foundation's science director, and when he isn't tending 
to patients, he is talking down meat and talking up the nutritional and 
ecological value of salads, soy pancakes and pasta. 
</P>
<P>
He rattles off statistics like a machine gun: A 10% reduction in meat 
consumption -- about two meals a week -- would free up enough land to raise 
grain to feed 60 million people. On average, it takes about 3 1/2 acres of land 
annually to produce food for a meat eater, but less than half an acre to feed a 
vegetarian. 
</P>
<P>
To produce a pound of wheat requires about 25 gallons of water. A pound of beef 
requires more than 2,500 gallons, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, to raise and manufacture the beef in a standard fast-food burger 
takes about 800 gallons of water, about the equivalent of what the average 
Southern Californian uses in a month," Klaper said. "Is that environmentally 
sound?" 
</P>
<P>
Klaper contends that 90% of all the grains grown in this country are fed to 
animals, and the amount of land used by the meat and poultry industry -- 
including grain fields, grazing land, even the property used by slaughterhouses 
and processing plants -- covers an area about the size of the western United 
States. By comparison, all the grains, vegetables and fruits consumed in this 
country and exported are grown in an area roughly the size of Vermont, Missouri 
and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
Equally disturbing, Klaper said, is the loss of 60% of the nation's forests 
over the last 300 years, much of it to create pasturelands for livestock 
grazing. Cutting down tens of thousands of trees contributes to the gradual 
warming of the Earth, the so-called "greenhouse effect," by depleting a primary 
source of oxygen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shifting our diet, Klaper asserted, is the remedy. If the demand for meat-based 
products falls off, cattlemen and chicken ranchers will be forced to convert 
their lands to wheat, rice or vegetable production. Klaper even suggested a 
federal subsidy to support ranchers who switch to farming. 
</P>
<P>
But one beef industry official said Klaper's idea is "sadly wanting for 
evidence." 
</P>
<P>
"For whatever reason, we are a constant target for these type of people," said 
John Ross, executive vice president of the California Cattlemen's Assn. 
Consumers are once again buying beef after a 15-year decline in sales, he 
pointed out. "Beef in moderation is an important part of any diet, and to 
suggest that we are at the core of all the world's environmental ills just 
doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
Ross added that much of the range land used for grazing is unsuitable for crop 
production. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it is steep hillsides or rocky ground," he said. "It's OK for 
grazing, but you can't grow on it." 
</P>
<P>
Turkey producers also were ticked at Klaper's attack. Industry officials point 
out that 254 million pounds of turkey were produced last year in the United 
States, a 40% increase over 1982 and a hefty indicator that Americans are 
sticking with that holiday classic. 
</P>
<P>
"They may be eating less red meat, but not turkey," said Laurie Wilson, 
National Turkey Federation spokeswoman. "We're all concerned about the 
environment, but I don't think a lot of people will be switching to wild rice 
casseroles any time soon."

SHERMAN GARDENS: AN OASIS OF COLOR AND LOCAL HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Speeding down the main drag of Corona del Mar on a fast-paced and bland kind of 
Orange County day, many people don't notice the small wooden, gold-lettered 
Sherman Library and Gardens sign on the side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
But it's here, behind a gated, vine-covered wall, that those weary of concrete 
can find a riot of color for the senses. They will also find roots to an Orange 
County past as colorful as any town they may have left behind. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important for people here, especially children, not to have a 
feeling of alienation," said William Hendricks, director of the historical 
library set in a 2.2-acre cultural and botanical oasis. "People should have a 
feeling of connection, so that street names and other things have meaning." 
</P>
<P>
The gardens and library originally were funded by the Sherman Foundation, 
funded by the heirs of Moses Hazeltine Sherman, a land baron who started street 
railway systems in both Phoenix and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks said the gardens and library grew out of "accidental circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
A nursery was part of the real estate that the Sherman Co. had purchased to 
expand its holdings on the block. Hendricks came down looking for papers for 
his dissertation and ended up creating a library. 
</P>
<P>
Today, about 2,500 people are Friends of Sherman Library and Gardens and pay 
dues to help support the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Specializing in color, the Sherman Gardens have more than 1,000 species of 
plants in a setting of fountains and sculpture. There is a tea garden where 
visitors may have lunch, a conservatory and a koi pond. 
</P>
<P>
For the blind, and sightseers who wish a different sensory experience, there's 
a Discovery Garden that focuses on touch and smell. 
</P>
<P>
The gardens also have guided tours, along with weddings, concerts and special 
lectures. 
</P>
<P>
And if the present-oriented sensual palette is not enough, the research library 
there is devoted to 100 years of past local color. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks is the man behind the books in the cozy rooms with three fireplaces 
and collection of plein air, or fresh air, paintings by artists once connected 
to Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Specializing in the history of the Pacific Southwest, the library houses about 
20,000 books and pamphlets in addition to maps, photographs, documents, back 
files of newspapers and more than 2,000 reels of microfilm. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks, who left a teaching position at USC in 1965 to wade through 
truckloads of papers in trunks, safes, wooden crates and even a five-gallon can 
to establish the library, is a master at making history come alive. 
</P>
<P>
The Sherman Library and Gardens is a 2647 E. Coast Highway and is open daily 
from 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Admission is free on Mondays and for children under 
12. Otherwise, admission is $2 for non-member adults. 
</P>
<P>
To visit the library without going through the gardens, ring the bell at a 
separate locked entrance on Dahlia Avenue for admittance.

CRESCENT BAY POINT PARK A HIDDEN GEM 
</P>

<P>
As you slow to enter Laguna Beach after whizzing south down Coast Highway, it's 
easy to miss the small blue sign announcing, in white letters, "Vista Point" 
that appears a mile past the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
But those who spot it -- and follow their curiosity -- turn right on Crescent 
Bay Drive, which ambles through towering palm trees and comes to rest at a 
small park snuggled between expensive homes. 
</P>
<P>
Crescent Bay Point Park is not easily found, but those who locate it are 
rewarded by relaxing scenery and the antics of marine life. 
</P>
<P>
From the lawn that greets visitors, pathways curve out toward the right and the 
left and meet again at the park's tip, which sits on the edge of a cliff 
jutting out against the ocean's crashing waves. 
</P>
<P>
To the left, spread out as if on display, curves the beach along Crescent Bay, 
and just beyond are the homes and businesses of downtown Laguna Beach, cradled 
by the rolling hills behind the city. 
</P>
<P>
Before the view captivates visitors, however, sea lions basking in the sun on 
rocks and barking a few hundred feet offshore to the right quickly steal the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
The park is maintained by the city of Laguna Beach. It was created in the late 
1970s with the help of the county after local residents fought to preserve the 
promontory as open space when it appeared the point would be developed with 
homes, according to the Laguna Beach Parks and Recreation Department. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the park's seclusion, people still manage to discover it -- people like 
David Bunch and his three co-workers, all chemical company executives from 
Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
The four men, all in coats and ties, were all lined up along the railing at the 
park's edge, shading their eyes from the sun with a hand as they looked out at 
the view. 
</P>
<P>
The four had flown into Orange County for a business meeting, and before they 
left for home they decided to drive along the coast in their rental car, Bunch 
said. Spotting the "Vista Point" sign, they turned off of Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little nicer than I expected. Nice view," Bunch said. "The seals are a 
nice bonus out there." 
</P>
<P>
Crescent Bay Point Park is also popular wedding spot. 
</P>
<P>
Jim and Wendy Russell, enjoying the park along with other visitors, said they 
had their wedding in the park about four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
One of their first dates was in the park, 30-year-old Wendy Russell said. The 
two shared a bottle of wine one evening and looked out on the city lights. So 
when they decided to get married, the park seemed an appropriate place. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great," Wendy Russell said. "They (the sea lions) were barking while we 
were getting married, and Jim's dad said, 'Well, I guess now you've got the 
seal of approval.' "

OLD HOUSES OFFER A UNIQUE VIEW OF COUNTY'S HISTORY

<P>
Standing before the picturesque wooden structures built in the late 1800s, one 
imagines the sounds of horses' hooves on cobblestones rather than the traffic 
on the nearby Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Hidden away in a parklike setting of redwood, macadamia nut and pecan trees sit 
two of Buena Park's oldest homes. One is the Whitaker-Jaynes House, built in 
1887 by Andrew Whitaker, brother of Buena Park founder James Whitaker. The 
other is the Bacon House, built in 1884 by an unknown squatter and later 
acquired by James Bacon. 
</P>
<P>
The houses hold a wealth of memories, including a display of women's hats from 
the mid-1800s, a collection of dolls with human hair modeled after the wives of 
U.S. Presidents, pastel chalk portraits that date back more than 100 years, a 
grand piano constructed in 1879, and various pieces and sets of crystal, silver 
and china collected and donated by lovers of history. 
</P>
<P>
Ready to acquaint visitors with the stories behind each piece or collection in 
the restored structures is curator Roberta Knisley, who donates her time and 
tender care to the upkeep of each house. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so few historical sites like this one for people to visit. It's an 
important part of history," says Knisley. 
</P>
<P>
One of her favorite displays is a collection of toys from the early 1900s. The 
collection includes likenesses of the Dion Quintuplets, the first quintuplets 
to survive, and a windup taxicab over 60 years old, which still operates. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most graceful settings of the Whitaker-Jaynes house can be found in 
one of the upstairs bedrooms. Set up much like it would have a hundred years 
ago is a bedroom suite donated by Walter and Cornelia Knott. The suite includes 
a double bed with headboard and dresser made from carved walnut, finished with 
burrow wood inserts from the Victorian Renaissance period. The dresser has a 
hidden drawer, and the quilt on the bed is fashioned with 13,027 hand-stitched 
squares in alternating colors. 
</P>
<P>
"We once held a contest for people to guess how many squares were in the 
quilt," said Knisley. "It was funny because the men would try to measure and 
calculate, whereas the women would just guess. A woman won." 
</P>
<P>
The Whitaker-Jaynes, house located on Whitaker Street next to Manchester 
Boulevard, later belonged to J.D. Jaynes, whose children sold the house to the 
city of Buena Park in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
The house is open for group and individual tours every Thursday from 10:30 a.m. 
until 2:30 p.m., and every second Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m., except on holidays. 
Admission is free.

John Ferguson has read plenty of stories about people down on their luck. But 
the story of what happened to Gudelia M. Calva, eight months pregnant when she 
was struck by an automobile and critically injured, inspired Ferguson to do 
more than just turn the page. 
</P>
<P>
He established a trust fund through his Irvine land development company that is 
helping Calva and her family with the costs of medical care, child care and 
finding a better place to live. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to do something about it," said Ferguson, president of Ferguson 
Partners. "The thing that grabbed me was that here was this healthy normal 
person walking down the street . . . and her life was shattered." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson is not alone in reaching out to help Calva. The family has received 
about $2,500 in donations since an article about them appeared in The Times on 
Nov. 4, and a group of volunteers has mobilized to help with everything from 
doctor's visits to baths for Calva's 2-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Calva, a 31-year-old mother of five who is still bedridden four months after 
her accident, said she is amazed that so many people have responded. 
</P>
<P>
"I prayed to God for help," she said. "These must be the angels." 
</P>
<P>
Strangers have stopped by the family's tiny one-room apartment with bags of 
groceries, hot soup and donations. Others have offered clothes, furniture, 
blankets and even a gas stove. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been so low I could sit on a cigarette paper and dangle my feet, but help 
came along the way," said Helen Schiller, who is coordinating donations 
gathered by the employees of Rainbow Technologies of Irvine. "Now I want to do 
that for someone else." 
</P>
<P>
In letters accompanying donations for Calva, many readers said they wanted to 
help because she was struggling to survive a catastrophe that wasn't her fault. 
</P>
<P>
It was around midnight on July 3 when Calva, unable to resist a craving for a 
fish sandwich, set out on foot to a nearby fast food restaurant. Halfway across 
the intersection of 1st Street and Harbor Boulevard in Santa Ana, Calva was 
struck by an alleged drunk driver traveling 90 m.p.h. The child she was 
carrying did not survive. 
</P>
<P>
She was hospitalized for three months, during which she spent one month in a 
coma and underwent eight operations. The state's program that helps poor people 
with medical expenses covered Calva's $340,000 hospital bill, but will not pay 
for physical therapy because she is an illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
Through a doctor's visit arranged by Ferguson last week, Calva was able to have 
her first medical evaluation since being released from the hospital Oct. 3. The 
doctor prescribed some new pain medications and referred her to an occupational 
therapist who will design a physical therapy regimen, said Jorge Soqui, Calva's 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is that she receives medical care," Soqui said. 
</P>
<P>
But also essential to the family's recovery is getting Soqui back in the work 
force. He quit his job to care for the two younger children and dispatched 
Calva's three teen-agers to Mexico to be cared for by his family. 
</P>
<P>
Since Calva was released from the hospital, Soqui has been reluctant to leave 
her alone for fear of a medical emergency happening while he is away. But 
through the trust fund, a housekeeper has been hired to stay with Calva and the 
children during the day, and Soqui has been able to look for work. 
</P>
<P>
Other volunteers, such as Valerie Adnani of Yorba Linda, stop by regularly with 
hot food and household supplies. Adnani, who has volunteered to drive Calva to 
doctor's appointments, said she wants to help the family because social service 
agencies are only able to provide limited assistance to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been here working, making their way. It doesn't matter that they 
weren't here legally," Adnani said. "Our society doesn't take care of the 
people who are really in need." 
</P>
<P>
Soqui is now completing arrangements to move to a new apartment, one with 
proper plumbing and electrical wiring, one where his daughter won't have to 
sleep on the floor of the closet anymore. Ferguson said he was appalled by the 
cramped and unsafe quarters where the family has been living. 
</P>
<P>
"In the context of (the wealth) of Orange County, I wasn't ready to see it," 
Ferguson said. "We walked in and she had a Bible by her on the bed. She was 
very moved by people caring about her." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson has offered to co-sign the rental agreement for a new apartment and 
help with move-in costs. He has also offered Soqui legal assistance in seeking 
a work permit, and employees of Ferguson's company have agreed to donate $5 a 
paycheck for the next few months to help the family. 
</P>
<P>
"They need kind of a safety net under them," Ferguson said. "Jorge is very 
proud. The only way I could get him to cooperate was to tell him to consider 
this a loan." 
</P>
<P>
Schiller, of Rainbow Technologies, said she has collected household items from 
fellow employees that she plans to deliver to the family's new apartment -- 
clothes for the children, blankets, a lamp and a microwave oven. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are down, and they don't have jobs, but they have their 
physical health," Schiller said. "This woman is flat on her back. It's a 
miracle she's even alive. She's a survivor. She's tough. That's what appeals to 
me."

<P>
A young man facing trial on drunk-driving charges won a dismissal of his case 
because the courts were too overloaded to handle him, said a judge who blamed 
himself for the foul-up. 
</P>
<P>
The case against Jeffrey Alan Griffin, 19, was dropped Wednesday when there was 
no time for another trial in the Fullerton court. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Municipal Judge Ronald P. Kreber said he was partly to blame for 
the incident because he missed a chance to postpone the case and did not see 
the overload coming when he denied a defense request for a continuance. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have been avoided," Kreber said. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin was arrested July 27 on suspicion of drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
Tests showed his blood-alcohol content to be 0.14%, above the legal threshold 
of 0.10%.

GARDEN GROVE MAN ARRESTED IN STABBINGS THAT INJURE 5;

<TEXT>
<P>
A 20-year-old Garden Grove man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder in 
stabbings outside a restaurant that left one man critically wounded and four 
others injured early Thursday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives arrested Thomas Simons, 20, at his Lemonwood Lane home after he was 
released from AMI Medical Center of Garden Grove, where he had been treated for 
minor stab wounds, Garden Grove Police Lt. John Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
Simons was arrested in the stabbing of Wesley F. Johnson, 23, of Garden Grove, 
who was in critical but stable condition with multiple stab wounds at the 
Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center on Thursday night. Three 
others, besides Simons, were released from area hospitals after being treated 
for stab wounds and other injuries received during a scuffle in parking lot of 
the Black Angus restaurant in the 12000 block of Euclid Street. 
</P>
<P>
Woods said police are trying to determine a motive for the fight, which started 
about 1:40 a.m. as the restaurant bar was closing. 
</P>
<P>
Michael P. Crusinberry, 30, of Garden Grove, said he was stabbed five times in 
the legs as he tried to break up a fight between two men in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of broke it up, and as I was walking to my car, it started up again," 
he said. "When I tried to break it up a second time, I got stabbed by one of 
the men. He cut me three times in my right leg and twice in my left leg. I 
never saw the knife. I didn't know I was cut until another customer yelled, 
"Hey, you're bleeding." 
</P>
<P>
Crusinberry was treated at Garden Grove Medical Center and later released. 
</P>
<P>
Also wounded was John Crooks, 23, of Granada Hills, who was treated for minor 
slash wounds, and James Kunzmann, 21, of Stanton, who suffered a black eye, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Crusinberry said he had gone with Kunzmann and two other friends to the 
restaurant for a few drinks. He said he knew only Kunzmann, not the other 
wounded men. 
</P>
<P>
"We just had a few drinks, danced a little and decided to leave," Crusinberry 
said. "We were not looking for any trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Kunzmann said he was struck by an unknown attacker as soon as he left the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone ran up to me and hit me -- bang! -- in my eye," he said. "I didn't 
have time to see who did it or to ask why? I was just floored." 
</P>
<P>
Crusinberry said the incident scuttled his Thanksgiving Day plans to have 
dinner with his sister in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm stuck at home now," he said. "My sister brought me some food, but it's not 
the same. Who wants to be stuck in bed with five holes in your leg on 
Thanksgiving Day?"

MAN FACES NEW SANITY TRIAL IN DOUBLE MURDER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ronald James Blaney Jr., the young deaf man convicted in the stabbing deaths of 
his ex-girlfriend and her mother two years ago, will face a new sanity trial 
April 10, the judge and lawyers in the case agreed this week. 
</P>
<P>
Blaney, 32, of Fountain Valley was convicted by a jury in September of 
first-degree murder in the May 4, 1987, death of Priscilla Vinci, 33, and her 
mother, Josephine Vinci, 65, at their Santa Ana home. 
</P>
<P>
But jurors were deadlocked in a separate phase of the trial to determine 
whether Blaney had been sane at the time. Two jurors held out for an insanity 
verdict. That forced Superior Court Judge Leonard H. McBride to declare a 
mistrial on the sanity issue. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert H. Gannon said a new sanity trial will almost be like 
a new trial. "A new jury is going to have to hear all the evidence about these 
murders and what led up to them," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
While Blaney's first-degree murder verdict still stands, the issue now is 
whether he will be sent to state prison, as prosecutors recommend, or a state 
mental hospital, which the defense is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
Because jurors found him guilty of multiple murder, Blaney faces an automatic 
sentence of life in prison without parole if the new jury finds him sane. If he 
is found insane, he would be committed to an institution for the rest of his 
life, but with options available for his eventual release should doctors find 
he has improved. 
</P>
<P>
Blaney was distraught at the time of the stabbings because Priscilla Vinci did 
not want to continue their relationship. Blaney had told his family that he 
wanted to marry her. Blaney admitted the stabbings, though he claims he was not 
aware that what he did resulted in the women's deaths. 
</P>
<P>
The women had been stabbed more than a dozen times each. Jurors also returned a 
finding of torture in the younger woman's death, another life-without-parole 
special circumstance.

LONG SHINES IN SHADOW OF HIS FATHER;

<TEXT>
<P>
Growing up with his body and his last name, Ian Long has had to answer a 
seemingly endless string of questions. 
</P>
<P>
 My but you're a big boy. How much you weigh anyhow? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 6-feet-6, 288 pounds right now." 
</P>
<P>
 And you say your name is Long? Any relation to Dallas Long, the shot-putter? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's right. He's my dad." 
</P>
<P>
 Your daddy was the Olympic champ in '64. You must be pretty good at it too? 
You do throw the shot, don't you? 
</P>
<P>
 "Nope." 
</P>
<P>
Ian Long is a senior offensive tackle for Newport Harbor High School, a young 
man eager to set his own course in the athletic world. 
</P>
<P>
It's enough that Long inherited his father's mammoth body, his athletic skills 
and his competitive spirit. And it's enough that he has to answer the questions 
concerning his father, who won the gold medal in Tokyo in 1964 and the bronze 
in Rome in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Long is not interested in winning Olympic medals. He wants to be a football 
player and he wants to earn his own acclaim in his own sport. 
</P>
<P>
So far he has fared well enough. 
</P>
<P>
He's a second-team all-Sea View League lineman for a team that has reached the 
second round of the Southern Section Division VI playoffs. The Sailors (9-2) 
play La Quinta (7-4) at 7:30 tonight at Bolsa Grande High. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the most important thing to Long is tonight's game. Not a possible 
college career, not postseason honors and not comparisons to his father. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, that's the last thing Long wants. And that's why he plays football and 
doesn't go out for the track and field team. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be like my dad," Long said. "He doesn't expect me to be like 
him. He wants me to go on in football and be successful there." 
</P>
<P>
There have been hurdles for Long to clear, though. 
</P>
<P>
One is his size. 
</P>
<P>
Having grown to 6-6, 288 by his 18th birthday, one wonders if Long's stature is 
a blessing or a curse. 
</P>
<P>
On one hand, size alone piques the interest of college recruiters. On the 
other, interest brings pressure and expectations that can easily surpass 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
So when Long showed up on the Newport Harbor campus as a 220-pound freshman, 
Coach Jeff Brinkley decided he had better take it slow and easy. No sense 
rushing things. 
</P>
<P>
Brinkley considered Long's amiable personality, his athletic talents, his 
potential and his strong desire to improve and established a game plan for the 
long haul. 
</P>
<P>
The goal was to make Long the best offensive lineman he could be. 
</P>
<P>
"We set a course for his high school career," Brinkley said. "It's been a 
year-by-year thing. I think Ian's progress has been steady. It's to the point 
now that you see the progress game by game. That's encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
Long said the past three games -- victories over Glenn in the first round of 
the playoffs, archrival Corona del Mar and Saddleback -- have been among the 
best he has played. 
</P>
<P>
A patient program has helped, he said. He has learned that you don't always 
have to overpower opponents, that brains and brawn can be a devastating 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
"He's set some realistic goals," Brinkley said. "We've just motivated him and 
maximized his abilities." 
</P>
<P>
Long's future is getting brighter and brighter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he'll probably get a full ride to a major university," Brinkley said. 
"He'll work hard on the weights. It's possible he'll redshirt his first year. 
They'll start the process of year-by-year improvement again. And by the time 
he's a senior, he should be a good offensive tackle." 
</P>
<P>
And that would suit Long just fine.

HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL PREVIEW '89;

<P>
SUNNY HILLS OCCUPIES FREEWAY'S FAST LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Burton, Fullerton High School's basketball coach, insists he was only 
joking when he listed the top contenders for the Freeway League championship as 
Sunny Hills, Fullerton and Sunny Hills' junior varsity team. 
</P>
<P>
"At least I hope so," Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
Seriously, Sunny Hills is the overwhelming favorite to win its third straight 
league title with a talented cast of players that probably will dominate the 
league again in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills has averaged 17 victories a season the past three years, and 
despite having only two seniors on its roster, should hit the mark again this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to be the dominant team," La Habra Coach Frank McCarroll said. 
"The rest of us should have fun fighting it out for second place." 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Sunny Hills figures to start slowly, with six key players still 
competing on its championship football team. 
</P>
<P>
"I had five players for practice this week, so we worked with the JVs," said 
Steve White, Sunny Hills' coach. "I'm used to missing players because of the 
football playoffs, but I've never had just five." 
</P>
<P>
Brett Mitchelson, the only returning starter who isn't playing football, missed 
practice all week with a pulled thigh muscle. Mitchelson, a 6-foot-7 center, 
averaged 8.2 points and seven rebounds per game as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills will start four juniors and a sophomore. White is pointing toward 
next season, when he anticipates a team similar to his 1987-88 squad that 
finished 22-4. 
</P>
<P>
"The league is probably the weakest overall in a long time," White said. "This 
is a great year for me to be starting four juniors and a sophomore." 
</P>
<P>
White, who begins his 14th season with a 193-147 record, is the dean of the 
league's coaches. But another veteran, Bill Morris of Troy, returns to coaching 
after a six-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
Morris led Troy to the postseason playoffs nine times in his 12 seasons before 
resigning in 1983. Morris' disciplined style of mistake-free basketball should 
be worth an additional three or four victories. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton guard Rene Arias, who hit 62% of his three-point field goal attempts 
as a junior, is the league's top returning player. 
</P>
<P>
A look at the teams: 
</P>
<P>
BUENA PARK -- Coach Ed Matillo had a long rookie season, winning only one game 
with an all-underclassman team. Richard Harvey, a 6-4 forward, was one of the 
few bright spots, averaging 10.2 points and 7.5 rebounds to earn all-league 
honors. 
</P>
<P>
Matillo will have another young team (two seniors), but he should get some help 
from three players off a championship freshman team that was undefeated in 
league play. Center Charles White is the best of the newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park also should improve with the addition of 6-3 guard Ray Lainer, a 
transfer from Southern High in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"We have better athletes, better scoring potential and more size and speed," 
Matillo said. "We'll be better than last year, but we're still poor 
offensively. This team can win if we can come together and improve." 
</P>
<P>
Matillo handicaps the league race as follows: 1) Sunny Hills with the best 
athletes; 2) Troy with the best chemistry; 3) Fullerton with the toughest 
players; 4) La Habra with good size. 
</P>
<P>
FULLERTON -- Two returning starters, a potential starter who was injured most 
of the season and the addition of the school's best athlete should make 
Fullerton a formidable team. Rene Arias, a deadly outside shooter, starts his 
third season. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Arias in the backcourt is returner Chris Rubal, who averaged five 
steals per game last year. Greg Bach, a 6-2 forward, would have started last 
season but was injured most of the year. 
</P>
<P>
John Bailey, the school's best athlete, will join the team after skipping 
basketball the past two seasons. Bailey was the football team's leading scorer 
the past two seasons and Burton is anticipating a big year from Bailey despite 
the layoff. 
</P>
<P>
Among the top newcomers are Illinois transfer John Hill and junior Craig Olson, 
who was cut his freshman year but averaged 16 points per game for the junior 
varsity last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of question marks to be answered," Burton said. "I have a player 
who missed most of last year, a transfer, one who hasn't played since his 
freshman year and another who was cut his freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
"We open on the road at Los Alamitos and Ocean View and then go to Trabuco 
Hills' tournament, so don't expect us to start quickly," Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
LA HABRA -- Former Hacienda Heights Wilson assistant Frank McCarroll led La 
Habra to a playoff berth in his first season, but all five starters have 
graduated. 
</P>
<P>
James Clegg, a 6-3 guard, and Mark Zehrung, a 6-6 center, were part-time 
starters who made key contributions. Clegg begins his third varsity season and 
averaged 11.5 points per game last season. Zehrung averaged five points and six 
rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be young and not very physical," McCarroll said. "Our strength is our 
outside shooting, but we lack varsity experience." 
</P>
<P>
Juniors Erik McFrazier and Ryan Kaneko and sophomores Josh Marshall and Scott 
Seminoff are the team's top newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
SONORA -- The Raiders have won only nine games in each of the past two seasons 
and all-league center Matt Rechtenwald has graduated. 
</P>
<P>
The top returning player is forward Greg Farlow, a 6-2, 140-pound senior. 
Farlow averaged nine points and six rebounds per game as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Scott Oxyguard, a transfer from Sunny Hills, should start. Oxyguard 
played for Sunny Hills' junior varsity team but decided to transfer because his 
playing prospects weren't promising, according to Sunny Hills Coach Steve 
White. 
</P>
<P>
SUNNY HILLS -- Youth was served last year when Brett Mitchelson and David 
Ragsdale when started as sophomores for the co-champions, who tied for first 
place with Fullerton. Mitchelson will be the league's best big man. 
</P>
<P>
But the player who has White most excited is sophomore guard Terry Mann. Mann 
is the son of former Gerry Mann, who was on Pete Newell's NCAA championship 
California team in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid is really something," White said. "He's a 4.5 honor student who took 
two of his senior classes last summer to get them out of the way." Asked if 
Mann was planning on graduating after his junior year, White said, "He better 
not, or I'll kill him." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchelson impressed college scouts with his play in the Slam-n-Jam league last 
spring. "Brett's future will be determined on how much he grows on and off the 
court," White said. 
</P>
<P>
White thinks his team's biggest challenger will be Fullerton, with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
"They're awfully tough in their gym," he said. "I don't think I've won over 
there in the past five years." 
</P>
<P>
TROY -- Point guard Mike Abbott and forward Richard Wesley are returning for 
their senior seasons, but Troy figures to have problems measuring up to taller 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Center Don Ploghaus is the tallest starter at only 6-3, and Coach Bill Morris 
admits the Warriors' play inside is sometimes questionable. Still, the veteran 
coach is optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be very competitive and hopefully challenge Sunny Hills and 
Fullerton for the league title," he said. "We have some good quickness and some 
perimeter players." 
</P>
<P>
Among the top newcomers are Eldon Davis, a key player on Troy's football team, 
and Josh Bray, a transfer from La Habra.

DIDDLEY'S STILL WAITING FOR HIS PIECE OF THE PIE; 
</P>
<P>
ROCK: THE LEGENDARY SINGER-GUITARIST HAS HAD A HUGE INFLUENCE ON THE INDUSTRY, 
BUT, LIKE MANY PIONEERS, HE NEVER SAW THE MONEY HE EARNED IN THOSE EARLY DAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bo Diddley has been chugging out his trademark beat for the last 34 of his 60 
years, but don't talk to him about retiring. "There are still things that need 
to be done, and I want to do them because I'm a citizen of the United States of 
America. And I classify myself as a damn good citizen." 
</P>
<P>
Though the things Diddley sees that need doing generally involve using his 
status as an entertainer to communicate to youth, participating in anti-drug 
projects and such, it may be no less an act of citizenship that Diddley is 
simply out there keeping his music alive. He performs at Knott's Berry Farm 
today and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The singer/guitarist pretty much wrote his own chapter of American rock history 
in the mid-'50s, originating the hypnotic "Bo Diddley" beat, which has 
influenced everybody from the Stones to Springsteen to the Smiths. 
Diddley-penned songs such as "I'm a Man," "Who Do You Love," "Mona," "Hey Bo 
Diddley," and "Roadrunner" were surging, musk-laden masterpieces and have lent 
themselves to numerous cover jobs, from the Grateful Dead to Chris Isaak. Eric 
Clapton's earliest recordings with the Yardbirds included a Diddley tune, as 
does his just-released "Journeyman" album. 
</P>
<P>
Diddley's raw guitar work helped expand the instrument's vocabulary with 
distortion, vibrato and other effects. And he practically defined the brash 
rock sense of style, dressing in loud plaids and jet-black cowboy outfits, 
riding tricked-out motor scooters and sporting squiggle-shaped, chrome-studded 
guitars such as his self-designed Thunderbird, which perhaps was inspired more 
by the wine than the car of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
And in payment for his efforts, Bo basically got diddley squat. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other seminal rock and R&amp;B performers, the vast majority of the 
monies earned through his talents and sweat went into the pockets of others. 
The matter is addressed by Texas' the Snakes, with Diddley guesting, on their 
current single, "Pay Bo Diddley": 
</P>
<P>
Bo Diddley had him a rockin' big time 
</P>
<P>
 But he never made a solitary dime . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Didn't know he was doing anything wrong 
</P>
<P>
 Signing away every one of his songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from his home in rural Archer, Fla., Diddley said, "It's a damn good 
song, not because it says, 'Pay Bo Diddley,' but because somebody thought 
enough of the situation that's been going on with publishing companies and 
record companies not paying artists from the '50s. I was just the first one. I 
guess the next one should be 'Pay the Coasters' or 'Pay the Shirelles,' 'Pay 
Carl Perkins' -- all of us that got ripped off. 
</P>
<P>
"I never saw any money, man. Maybe they can show you a check for $1,000 every 
here and there, something I'd get sent every now and then if my car broke down 
on the road. But they can't show you anything where Bo Diddley cashed a check 
for $35,000 for royalties, or nothing like that. 
</P>
<P>
"The position we were all in then, we had to trust some son-of-a-bitch, and we 
got ripped off. We worked hard, and a lot of people are living high off the hog 
off of our running up and down the road every night and records being sold, and 
we never seeing the money. Living in America, you have the opportunity to do 
something, but then you get slapped around with a pencil. What does a contract 
mean? Nothin'!" 
</P>
<P>
Today when someone buys a $13 CD reissue of Diddley's music, or the new Clapton 
album, Diddley said, "I don't get a dime from it," though he does claim that 
MCA, which has recently reissued his Chess label material, has "tried to clean 
up some of the bad vibes" left by previous owners of Diddley's catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Diddley has a new album out on L.A.'s punk-oriented Triple-X 
Records titled "Breakin' Through the B.S." The album abounds with funk and rap 
influences, and Diddley's trademark guitar is largely supplanted by 
synthesizers. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got a new generation of kids out here, and you've got to change with 
the times," he said. "I'm not totally out of touch with 'Bo Diddley,' say, but 
I made the album where there's got to be something that every radio station can 
understand, something that will fit that format." 
</P>
<P>
He said he's no stranger to rap. "That came out of the black neighborhood way 
back. We used to call it 'signifying.' " Diddley was the first to make a hit of 
that early "dissing" style with his mid-'50s "Say Man," where he and his maraca 
player Jerome Green traded choice insults. The new album's socially concerned 
"Wake Up America" is a response to "all the garbage that's going on. There's 
too much conniving, too much backbiting with our officials. Look at the drug 
problem in our country -- that comes under the heading of backbiting. All this 
conniving for the sake of a dollar bill. We're killing our nation. 
</P>
<P>
"You and I have to get out of the way someday and let the youngsters run the 
country, but we're killing them. With the next generation of kids, what are we 
going to have, a junkie in the White House? What else is going to be left?" 
</P>
<P>
For shows such as his Knott's appearance, Diddley sticks to his classics, 
claiming, "As soon as people start asking for the new ones, I'll play them." 
</P>
<P>
While he makes a comfortable living -- "meaning I'm not starving" -- he 
wouldn't mind getting some of the all-star attention accorded to contemporaries 
such as Chuck Berry and the late Roy Orbison in film and record projects in the 
last couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I have been ignored to the fullest. The Nike commercial I recently 
did with Bo Jackson has done more for my career than what has been done for me 
in the music industry in the last 15 years. But that's all water under the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"I might sound it, but I'm not bitter about it. I feel blessed to have had the 
life I've had. It's only that I just want some of the cake. If I'm the sucker 
that's going to put it together -- and my Bo Diddley sound is being used 
everywhere -- then give me a slice of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Diddley and the Coasters play today at Saturday at 4 and 7 p.m. at Knott's 
Berry Farm, 8039 Beach Blvd., Buena Park. Admission: $15.95 to $19.95, includes 
all park attractions. Information: (714) 220-5200.

JUST YOUR BASIC CUBAN-FRENCH-VIET FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Places Afar is your basic Cuban-French-Vietnamese restaurant set in a shopping 
mall. Two chefs are in charge of the kitchen -- one is Cuban, the other 
Vietnamese. If you are wondering about the connection, I have a good 
explanation. The chefs are married. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese dishes here are as good as you'll find in Little Saigon. 
Imperial salad is a bowlful of cold, rice noodles and leafy greens with 
vinegared carrot, crushed peanut, barbecued pork and shrimp, plus Vietnamese 
egg rolls (crisper and more densely filled than in the rest of Asia). 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant's five-spice chicken, a large plate of sauteed chicken and 
winter vegetables, is made with a pungent spice mixture that permeates every 
bite. You can also get Vietnamese fried rice, beef with mint and chili, and bun 
bo (beef noodle soup). 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the Cuban dishes -- wonderful ham croquettes, for instance, 
which are crispy, deviled cylinders served with greaseless fried plantain chips 
and perfect roulades of smoky ham and Emmentaler cheese. Even smokier is the 
puree of green peas in hot soup form with chicharrones crumbled on top. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Cuban entrees, I sampled the picadillo and the pan de bistec. I can 
recommend both. Picadillo is ground beef served over rice with plenty of 
onions, garlic and raisins in a highly seasoned tomato stock. It's like a 
sophisticated Sloppy Joe. Pan de bistec (available only at lunch) is thinly 
sliced brisket on a soft roll with a large heap of grilled onions. 
</P>
<P>
If you come at night, you can choose from a French menu that includes 
choucroute garni and couscous Mediterranean with orange chili oil. Desserts 
like cascas, guava paste over white cheese, and a good rice pudding and flan 
are always available. 
</P>
<P>
Places Afar is inexpensive. Lunch items range from $2.95 to $5.95. Dinners are 
from $5.95 to $13.95.

<P>
As the carriage wheel in the parking lot indicates, a calesa is a horse-drawn 
carriage used in the Philippines. But Calesa, the restaurant, is a richly 
luxurious place that wouldn't look out of place in any first-class hotel in the 
Philippine capital. 
</P>
<P>
Magnificent lanterns made from a Filipino shell called capiz are suspended over 
cloth-draped tables and ornate stainless steel carvings are placed throughout 
the dining room. Waiters wear tuxedoes and flame things at tables with great 
pomp and ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The motto here is "Around the World Dining," and indeed the menu is defiantly 
eclectic here. Everything from paella to Indonesian sate to pure 
Continental-style desserts (e.g., baked Alaska) shows up on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best dishes here is an appetizer called gambas al ajillo, a remnant 
Filipino favorite from colonial days. It's a sizzling casserole of golden brown 
shrimp with lots of minced garlic and crusty, oil-rubbed bread. The Shanghai 
fried lumpia are good shrimp and pork egg rolls, unfortunately served with a 
forgettable sweet red sauce that is supposed to be sour. 
</P>
<P>
Chicken tara -- grilled cutlets with sticky pineapple and mango chutneys on the 
side -- sounds intriguing, but is so sweet I thought the waiters would come by 
any minute and flame it for dessert. Better is caldereta, a spicy beef 
preparation from the little known Philippine province of Pampanga. It's a dish 
that doesn't seem Asian at all -- the beef is covered with a thick blanket of 
sauce made from duck liver paste. I pegged it as a French-Yiddish-Hungarian 
concoction, but the chef assured me it was purely Pampangan. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland crab cakes with a Mornay sauce on the side aren't bad at all. But 
lengua estofado -- sliced ox tongue in a red wine sauce with mushrooms and 
olives -- was a big disappointment. It was somewhat salty and hockey-puck 
tough. 
</P>
<P>
All the old-time hotel desserts are served at Calesa: crepe suzette, baked 
Alaska, flaming fruit jubilee. You can also get a Filipino meringue confection 
with several layers of butter cream that taste sort of like silly putty. 
</P>
<P>
Calesa is moderately expensive. Appetizers are $5 to $6.50. Filipino dishes are 
$12 to $16. House specialties are $12 to $18. The paellas (for two only) are 
$27.50 and $30.50.

'20TH CENTURY' BUSINESSES FACE DILEMMA AS 21ST CENTURY NEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Would you entrust your health to a store named 19th Century Medical Supplies? 
Would you seek advice about your newfangled, revolutionary product from a firm 
entitled 19th Century Advertising Consultants? Would you computer-shop at 19th 
Century Electronics? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, none of these establishments exist. But in one measly decade, a few 
Orange County businesses could sound equally anachronistic. As 1990 heralds the 
final lap of the 20th Century, an epithet that once conveyed up-to-the-minute 
modernism will become a relic from another era. 
</P>
<P>
So, what's a business like 20th Century Marketing to do? "Maybe we'll rename 
the company '20th Century Plus,' " laughed its owner and president, Roger 
Christopherson. Oh, well, the problem will be someone else's, he shrugged: "I'm 
56; I'll be retired by then." 
</P>
<P>
Christopherson founded his La Habra consulting firm in 1977, when the 21st 
Century seemed as distant as compact disc players, glasnost and the return of 
the miniskirt. "We chose our title because it implied that you could count on 
us to be in the know," he said. "I suppose we'll have to change it, which is a 
shame since '20th Century' has a nice ring to it. I don't think '21st Century' 
is an easy-sounding name." 
</P>
<P>
Then again, he could leave well enough alone and hope that prospective clients 
have a sense of humor. "Perhaps we'll make a joke out of it -- '20th Century 
Marketing: We'll Catch Up Sooner or Later,' " Christopherson proposed. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park-based 20th Century Pools could dive into the next century with an 
updated nomenclature -- but for now, powers-that-be are only testing the water. 
"We may go to 'Century Pools' or 'Century 21 Pools,' " said the 13-year-old 
company's general manager, Leo Newport. "There's already a '21st Century 
Pools,' so we can't use that. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever change we make will be minor. Our name has come to represent 
reliability and trust, so I don't believe it would turn people away if we 
decided to stick with '20th Century.' "

But might not the almost-passe designation conjure up images of kidney-shaped 
pools, circa 1961? 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this is a question that we will need to address more carefully in 
the coming years. However, 10 years is a long time to change direction. Exxon 
made a radical name change, but within a few years, most people couldn't tell 
you Exxon's old name. (For the record, it was Standard Oil Co., changed in 
1972.) 
</P>
<P>
Linda Manikas, founder of 20th Century Beauty Pageant, planned ahead for the 
shifting sands of time. "Originally, when we registered our name with the U.S. 
Patent Office, we also registered '21st Century Beauty Pageant,' " the contest 
producer said. 
</P>
<P>
Based in Brea, the 15-year-old organization puts on nationwide competitions for 
children and teen-agers. Since her current clients will live the bulk of their 
lives on the other side, Manikas reasoned, she won't wait until the next 
century to employ its birth name. "We'll probably start using '21st Century' 
this coming year," she said. "We basically deal with children, and the 21st 
Century will be their century." 
</P>
<P>
20th Century Insurance Co., which focuses on Southern California clientele, 
likewise has taken steps toward the new millennium. Its parent company, 20th 
Century Industries, last year added a sister insurance company -- 21st Century 
Casualty. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized that the 20th Century was quickly turning into the 21st Century," 
said company spokesman Daryn Teague. "I don't know whether or not we eventually 
will rename 20th Century Insurance Co., but we're certainly in a preferable 
position, having a (21st-Century) title off the ground and running." 
</P>
<P>
Many new players were farsighted enough to enter the game already wearing the 
more fashionable jersey number. 
</P>
<P>
"The 20th Century is a dinosaur," proclaimed Vernon VanWinkle, who opened 21st 
Century Video Productions in Orange two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that '21st Century' improves our sales, but '20th Century' 
definitely would have hurt sales in another 10 years," said Stephen Graves, 
owner of 21st Century Innovations Inc., a software developing company in El 
Toro. "I wouldn't buy software from a place named '20th Century.' I'd think: 
'These guys aren't up to date here.' 
</P>
<P>
"In the past six months, I've seen a lot of ads in computer magazines for new 
companies named 21st Century," Graves noted. "It seems that all of a sudden 
everyone is jumping on the 21st-Century bandwagon." 
</P>
<P>
Marketing experts concurred. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially if you were selling high technology, you'd be killing yourself with 
'20th Century' in your title," said Dan Krongaard, vice president of Galusha 
&amp; Associates, a Newport Beach advertising and public relations firm. 
</P>
<P>
"The 20th Century once stood for forward-thinking, but it suddenly has a patina 
about it," said Dan Pittman, vice president of Salvati Montgomery Sakoda, an 
advertising firm in Costa Mesa. "However, some companies are so identified with 
the '20th-Century' title that they wouldn't benefit from changing it. I doubt, 
for example, that 20th Century Fox will change its name." 
</P>
<P>
He was right there; the most famous of 20th Century-denominated companies sees 
no need to mess with antiquity. 
</P>
<P>
"The official word from this corner is that the company does not plan to drop 
'20th Century' from its title," said Dennis Petroskey, director of corporate 
communications. "The name is what it is. 20th Century Fox is no more identified 
with the 21st Century than it is with the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries; (the 
film-making corporation) came to be in the 20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
Also for historical purposes, 20th Century Limited Restaurant in Costa Mesa 
will stay on the same track. "It's named after a train that ran between New 
York and Chicago from 1902 until the late '50s," explained Manager Mitch 
Mortesen. "The restaurant is set up in the style of Grand Central Station. So 
its name won't ever change." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Nguyen, on the other hand, harbors no sentimental attachment to his store's 
masthead, 20th Century Video. Still, revising it hardly seems worth the effort 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
"When is the 21st Century? In 10 years? That's a long way off," the Stanton 
proprietor commented indifferently. "Why should I change the name? If I changed 
the name, I'd have to change everything -- the receipts, the membership cards. 
The patent office would charge me more money. It costs a lot to change a name." 
</P>
<P>
These are the good old days, said El Toro genealogist Steve Frogue. So his 
service, 20th Century Biography and Genealogy, will remain firmly rooted in the 
present -- even after the present becomes the past. 
</P>
<P>
"I tape people's life stories for their children and grandchildren," said 
Frogue, who teaches history at Saddleback College. "Their lives have been 
marked by 20th-Century events -- World War II, the Kennedy assassination. 
</P>
<P>
"The people I interview reminisce about the time they ran down the road to see 
a car drive by, or an airplane fly overhead. I'm struck by the feeling that no 
generation after this one will experience such a fascinating century. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember a quote by Mark Twain, who lived from 1835 to 1910. He said that 
his life and heart were with his own century, but he wished the 20th Century 
well. That's probably how I'll feel about the 21st Century."

<P>
The sun was behind him now and the enemy plane was in front. He had closed to 
within a mile of the target -- too close for missiles. He checked the guns for 
what would have to be a bullet kill: They were ready to fire. 
</P>
<P>
In the plane ahead, the enemy pilot's helmet reflected the sun. It was 
annoying, but nothing more. The foe's co-pilot was jerking his thumb backward, 
pointing at him, him, the Gray Fox, warning of the danger. It didn't matter 
now, though. He was all but locked in. 
</P>
<P>
He slammed the Marchetti SF-260 forward and felt the air currents batter it, 
almost forcing a stall. The dreaded buffeting shook the plane violently, but he 
stayed true. He lined up the enemy in the gun sight and squeezed the trigger. 
One second passed. Two. Then he heard it, the peep-peep-peep in his headphones. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeee-hawwww, that's a kill!" his co-pilot screamed. The 67-year-old minister 
grinned broadly. He swung the plane around and started once again to play the 
ultimate video game in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
In the air over Riverside County these days you can often see them, men or 
women caught by the Tom Cruise bug, flying the "Top Gun" movie-inspired fantasy 
flight from Fullerton Airport for $395. 
</P>
<P>
The company that runs the flights is called, appropriately enough, Topgun 
Aviation. It bought two Marchetti single-engine propeller planes, each costing 
close to a quarter-million dollars, and began its flights in May. The air 
battles are videotaped, letting the "killers" show their friends how they iced 
the bad guy in the other plane. For more advanced flyers who won't get 
disoriented by the sight or the experience, a "kill" triggers not only tones in 
the earphone but smoke billowing from the rival plane. 
</P>
<P>
Topgun Aviation, which runs the flights for everyone from war aces to those who 
have never been in a plane before, is the creation of 42-year-old Mike 
Blackstone, an American Airlines pilot who regrets not having experienced 
combat in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I missed something in my flying," Blackstone said. A flyer at 12, 
holder of a pilot's license at 17, a civilian pilot after graduating from Cal 
Poly Pomona, Blackstone said he never flew in the military "and I think that's 
why I got involved in this." 
</P>
<P>
Blackstone said he spent four years trying to get the right combination of 
energy sources, transponders, microwaves and the like that would allow 
civilians to track a foe, use a gun sight, and score a kill in such a way that 
there would be no arguments later. 
</P>
<P>
Blackstone said he already has bookings for next summer and business is so good 
he's considering getting two more planes and maybe shifting his base from 
Fullerton to Chino. Bill Bancroft, who helped Blackstone get the operation 
going and who often flies one of the planes, said that "there's a lot of people 
out there who really would like to be fighter pilots, but they don't have the 
opportunity or the time." 
</P>
<P>
A spur to the founding of Topgun was the aerobatic rivalry between Bancroft and 
Blackstone that often "would degrade into a dogfight," Blackstone remembered. 
On the ground, there would be arguments over which one had been "shot down," 
and "that's when I decided it was time to establish some means of determining 
who got whom. And four years later and half a million dollars, now I can tell 
him I got him." 
</P>
<P>
Blackstone was the instructor for the flight by the minister, Gregory Sloan of 
Anaheim. Blackstone lets the person who plunked down the cash do as much of the 
flying as he or she is comfortable with, ranging from virtually none at all to 
all sorts of maneuvers like high and low yo-yos and disengagement rolls. 
</P>
<P>
Since Sloan performs acrobatic flights himself and was over at Topgun Aviation 
to try his hand at aerial combat maneuvers, Blackstone let him handle much of 
the flying. 
</P>
<P>
Sloan's adversary this day was his 46-year-old son, Greg, a retired Marine 
pilot of A-4 attack jets with 276 missions in Vietnam during a military career 
that also saw him teach aerial combat for more than a decade. Bancroft 
partnered the younger Sloan. 
</P>
<P>
Back on the ground, the senior Sloan pronounced the flight "excellent. . . . 
That's what flying should be all about, having some fun." In this case, though, 
"fun" occasionally meant being pressed into the seat by five times the force of 
gravity and still trying to find the "enemy." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see him, can you? Matter of fact, I can't move my head," he said at 
one point as he swept the sky through the plane's plexiglass canopy. 
</P>
<P>
Even his son, the veteran of 23 years in Marine aviation, loved it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is more fun -- I thought I'd never say this -- this is more fun than 
(flying) in an A-4." Why? Because the Marchetti provides "a smaller, tighter, 
more compact, faster" turning radius, Greg Sloan said. "When you go out and do 
these types of maneuvers in an A-4, you're looking at 5,000 to 7,000 feet of 
altitude gained and lost in just one maneuver. And you're doing the whole thing 
here in maybe 500 to 600 feet." 
</P>
<P>
The younger Sloan, an air safety analyst for Douglas Aircraft Co. in Long Beach 
who has started working part-time for Topgun Aviation as an instructor, said 
that playing mock fighter jock is "a very inexpensive stress reducer. You can 
go out and work out your aggressions and come back and just be in hog heaven 
for three or four weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Before climbing into the Marchetti planes, potential Red Barons are briefed by 
the people who will be controlling the aircraft -- Blackstone or one of his 
staff. The briefing can take an hour or more, with a constant emphasis on 
safety. The rules bar approaching within 500 feet of the other plane. Maneuvers 
are done at least 1,500 feet above the ground and outside heavily traveled 
"highways in the sky." 
</P>
<P>
Flyers pick a code name (Sloan senior picked "Gray Fox" because he sees himself 
as a "foxy grandpa"), don a flight suit, helmet and parachute, and climb into a 
plane, sitting beside the instructor. The planes are an authentic-looking Navy 
gray, with red, white and blue diagonal stripes and the white star in a field 
of blue -- familiar to anyone who built model planes as a kid. 
</P>
<P>
The Marchettis take off from Fullerton Municipal Airport single file and head 
out toward the "killing zone." 
</P>
<P>
There they fly side by side, then break away and start the sweeping turns that 
will bring them back facing each other, a mile apart. "Tally ho," an instructor 
cries, signaling that he has the other plane in his sights. 
</P>
<P>
"Green 'em up, the music's on," the pilot announces, meaning the electronics 
are up and working. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, there's the sort of experience that Robert Hess had. 
</P>
<P>
"I was coming in," Hess remembered a month after his flight. His rival "was at 
my 2 o'clock level and I had a lead on him. I was closing too fast, so Mike 
(Blackstone) told me to pull the nose straight up, vertical. As soon as I got 
in the vertical, he told me to bank to the left, hard. When we came out, I 
acquired the target through the top of the canopy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I was right on, guns to bear, and I wasted him." 
</P>
<P>
Hess, who lives in Fullerton and is a mechanical engineer with Northrop 
aviation, said that because he replays his moments of glory again and again and 
again, his biggest worry now is wearing out the videotape that recorded his 
"kills." Although some flyers show up at Topgun with their opponents in tow -- 
maybe a friend or a spouse -- others show up solo, like Hess, who said 
Blackstone paired him up with another flier on his own. 
</P>
<P>
"I was unable to be a pilot in the military because of my eyesight," said Hess, 
who described himself as "very frustrated" over winding up as a Navy 
electronics technician on a destroyer rather than a pilot on an aircraft 
carrier. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted to fly and I've always wanted to fly some sort of combat 
mission. When I saw the movie 'Top Gun,' that really brought out the 
frustrations in me. Though there was a lot of phoniness in the movie, the 
aerial scenes were great." 
</P>
<P>
So when Hess heard about the chance to fly the Marchetti, he knew he had to do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was probably the best Sunday afternoon I ever spent," he said. And right 
after Christmas, "I'm going to go out and do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Kaltenbaugh wants to do it again too. His parents gave him a Topgun flight 
as a surprise gift for his 16th birthday -- the minimum age at which Blackstone 
will take someone up. 
</P>
<P>
"Just seeing the movie 'Top Gun' got me interested" in flying, Kaltenbaugh 
said. Then his birthday flight put him over the top. Now, "I'd like to take 
flying lessons some time." 
</P>
<P>
Kaltenbaugh said he did little of the flying himself, since "there's no way I 
could do the flips and everything (the instructor) did," but the teen-ager did 
manage to "shoot down" the guy in the other plane twice. 
</P>
<P>
The forces of gravity made him feel "a little bit" sick, but not enough to 
dampen his enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going up again. . . . I'm going up for another hour." 
</P>

<P>
My parents were not the first in my family who wished to live at the edge of 
the world. My great-uncle, Ed Gwyther, was so seriously wounded in the first 
World War that he no longer wanted to be around people. Hearing of land offered 
free to injured veterans, he put his large iron stove and his tools on a raft 
at the Idaho town of Salmon and floated down the boulder-strewn Salmon River 58 
miles to Lake Creek, where he built a log cabin. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty years later, the vast area west of the North Fork of the Salmon River is 
still a sanctuary. Some months, you're as likely to see a herd of bighorn sheep 
or a bear and her cubs on the road as an automobile. From the tiny town of 
North Fork past the tinier town of Shoup and the place my great-uncle built, 
traveling west along a steep canyon for more than 50 miles, one sees no power 
lines, no operating schools, no churches, no libraries. Mail comes only twice a 
week, and there is no newspaper delivery. The nearest daily newspaper and 
hospital are in Missoula, Mont., 140 miles north across the steep Bitterroot 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Salmon (population 3,308), a 90-minute drive from my parents' place, is the 
closest town with a doctor or a store that amounts to much. In Shoup 
(population 2), the only post office or town in this part of the canyon, Don 
and Donna Myers still pump gas from old glass-walled gravity-flow pumps because 
the canyon has no electricity. On warm evenings, the Myerses and their friends 
sit out by the pumps and watch the few cars raise dust as they pass. 
</P>
<P>
People come to this part of the world for white-water rafting and tranquillity. 
The Salmon is one of the last great western rivers to flow freely, unhindered 
by dams. It is not always benevolent; boaters have been killed on what Indians 
once called the "River of No Return." In fact, the first white men to attempt 
it -- the Lewis and Clark expedition in 1805 -- found it so intimidating that 
after a few miles of this rocky, precipitous canyon, they gave up and retraced 
their steps to find an easier route to the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all the people who live along this section of the Salmon River, many of 
them retirees, once lived down on the flatlands in "civilization." Joan and Hod 
Groff are typical; they moved here from Montana for a slower life, one where a 
person can take the time to appreciate, as Joan says, "the different lights on 
the rocks as the sun changes." 
</P>
<P>
Like most of their neighbors, the Groffs want peace and quiet but draw the line 
at isolation. That is why they and 16 other canyon families run what telephone 
experts say is the last hand-cranked telephone system in the nation, the 
nonprofit North Fork Telephone Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In 1952, the families bought this antiquated "system" from the U.S. Forest 
Service for $1; it consists of a single line strung between midget telephone 
poles or riveted into sheer rock cliffs many yards above the river. The users 
maintain the equipment, an arduous task for 60- and 70-year-olds who must climb 
the cliffs to repair lines broken by lightning, forest fires, avalanches and 
the rockslides touched off by rambling bighorn sheep. 
</P>
<P>
Without this primitive phone system, the 17 families would simply be 17 
scattered outposts along 31 miles of canyon. "Our phone line is what ties the 
people up and down the river and makes us a community," says Jack Briggs, a 
subscriber for 25 years. It also ties them to the 10 women employed as 
operators in Salmon by Century Telephone Enterprises, a Louisiana-based holding 
company that acquired the Salmon telephone company in 1981. The women are the 
ones who must manually connect calls made to and from the canyon phones. 
</P>
<P>
All of this teamwork is an oddity in a rugged area with few social 
institutions. The biggest event of the canyon social season is the annual 
potluck dinner and meeting to elect new officers for the North Fork Telephone 
Corp. When it was held in June, top executives of Century asked to attend. The 
families were pleased; some had heard rumors that Century was going to announce 
a system with dial tones, private lines and all that "modern stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Women hugged each other in greeting as the meeting began at the old log school 
in Shoup. As the families spread out casseroles, potato salad, baked beans and 
chocolate cake over three tables, the five telephone executives gave them a 
fancy plate of cheeses. But the air of hopefulness evaporated after dinner, 
when the executives began to talk from the end of the table. Century had no 
choice, the executives were saying; it would have to close the operator 
facility in Salmon in mid-December. Century was pulling the plug on the tiny 
company: The 17 families would no longer be able to call anyone in the world 
except each other. 
</P>
<P>
"It was," says subscriber Marsha Smith, "the shock of a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
City dwellers might be shocked to see what passes for telephone service in this 
canyon. The phones that hang on the walls of canyon homes are bulky black 
contraptions with headsets. They have no dials but are operated by turning a 
crank. This type of electric magneto telephone was standard in the early part 
of the century but was phased out in most urban areas before 1940. Frank 
Barsalou, Century Telephone's district manager in Salmon, calls them "1900 
telephones in a 1990 system." 
</P>
<P>
Kindness and patience help on this system. Only one party can use the line at 
any time. Each subscriber hears loud ringing every time someone makes or 
receives a call, so no one is supposed to call before 7 a.m. or after 10 p.m. 
except in an emergency. Calls are to be limited to a few minutes. Rain or hot 
afternoon sunshine can make voices inaudible, so people learn to make calls on 
cool, clear mornings. Natural forces close the line a dozen times a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Our telephone is sort of a joke, but it's very essential for our being able to 
live here," says Hod Groff. When I want to call my parents, Herman and Jennie 
Nelson, I must first talk to a California operator. The operator often tells me 
to dial direct. When I explain that I can't because my parents' number is a 
combination of five digits and the letter F, the operator sometimes says 
curtly, "Sir, there is no such thing as a non-seven-digit number in the United 
States." When subscriber Fred Porter tried to call his Owl Creek Ranch there 
from another state, he was told by an operator: "You're just drunk. There is no 
such number." 
</P>
<P>
Only Salmon's operators know how to reach those mysterious hand-cranked phones. 
The last local operators in Idaho, they are the linchpin in a system that 
requires human assistance at every level. The 17 subscribers have developed a 
special relationship with them. "They'll always stay on the line to help you," 
says Bonnie Porter. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Briggs, the affable man who runs the Indian Creek Guest Ranch, used to 
call the operator every night to get the baseball scores. And one night, years 
ago, when he was working temporarily as a miner in Leadore, southeast of 
Salmon, the operator called to say, "Jack, did you forget to call your wife 
tonight?" When Briggs said that he had indeed, the operator replied: "I'll ring 
her now for you." 
</P>
<P>
It seemed as though half of Lemhi County turned out early this month when the 
families of the canyon telephone company threw a farewell party for the Salmon 
operators at the Outpost cafe and bar, owned by John Booker, vice president of 
North Fork Telephone. They washed down barbecue with beer and soft drinks while 
reminiscing about times the operators consoled children left alone at home or 
offered advice on baking a cake. After mid-December, their jobs -- mostly 
assisting with long-distance and credit-card calls -- will be performed by 
operators in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Century attributes the elimination of the Salmon operators to the changes that 
deregulation has brought among telephone companies. Earlier this year, Barsalou 
says, US West, and AT&amp;T notified Century that they would no longer contract 
with Century for operators in Salmon because their services could be performed 
elsewhere. And Century, with only 3,000 customers, couldn't afford to keep them 
on just for the North Fork families. 
</P>
<P>
Because Century never asked the Idaho Public Utilities Commission for 
permission to serve the area covered by the hand-crank system, it has no legal 
obligation to serve it. Barsalou says it does so purely by a "gentlemen's 
agreement. There's no contract, no piece of paper." 
</P>
<P>
Without operators, the only way Century could continue to serve the canyon 
would be to lay a modern telephone cable down the river, which it estimates 
would cost more than $600,000 -- nearly $40,000 per customer. The cable would 
also require federal permission because this stretch of the Salmon is protected 
by Wild and Scenic Rivers legislation. All of this would be an unpromising 
investment in a phone system that earned Century revenues of $2,820 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
When the river folks were hit with the bombshell about the operators in June, 
at first they were at loose ends about how to proceed. Nevertheless, they were 
upset and angry, so they pulled together and mounted a campaign, spearheaded by 
Marsha Smith, partly because she owned a typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking over their crackly line to radio talk-show hosts in San Diego or 
Seattle and writing to television news directors and Idaho politicians, they 
made their case repeatedly: The phone is essential for residents and for 
visiting rafters, hikers, Boy Scouts, hunters and salmon and steelhead 
fishermen. Snow and rockslides sometimes block the canyon; the only way to get 
help is to call out and hope for a helicopter. My parents, who are both over 
80, live across the river from the road to Salmon, a few yards from the 
one-room cabin Great-Uncle Ed built. They can get to the road only by pulling a 
tiny cable car, hand over hand, above the water. They worry that a crisis could 
leave them with no way to call neighbors or paramedics for help. 
</P>
<P>
As the weeks wore on, the arguments and protests of the Groffs, Marsha Smith 
and their neighbors began to get through. The Idaho Public Utilities Commission 
called a hearing in Salmon in late August; the 17 telephone subscribers drove 
upriver to be there. 
</P>
<P>
They felt a sense of victory when the commission said it would ask Century to 
maintain their link to the outside until an alternative is arranged. "In 
Idaho," explains Commissioner Perry Swisher, "we consider access to a telephone 
close to a constitutional right." 
</P>
<P>
And then, a rescuer appeared. The Rural Telephone Co. of Glenns Ferry, Ida., 
declared itself willing to serve the area. Its owner, Jim Martell, says he can 
lay cable down the canyon for $300,000. The main trouble the canyon folks see 
in Rural's proposal is its greatly increased cost. Their basic monthly service 
charge would double to $14.75, and they would also have to pay toll charges for 
all calls to the Salmon area, calls that are now free. 
</P>
<P>
If the canyon folk and the Rural Telephone Co. can come to an agreement, and if 
the Forest Service approves laying cable along the river, it will open the way 
for more than just modern telephone service with no party line. The canyon 
dwellers will have the option of paying extra for such frills as call 
forwarding, call waiting, conference calling and automatic redialing. As early 
as next summer, the Salmon River canyon's telephone service could pass 
overnight from the country's most antiquated phone system to one that couldn't 
be more modern. In the interim, says Century's Barsalou, his company intends to 
contract with a Salmon motel whose switchboard operator will connect the 
hand-cranked calls. 
</P>
<P>
"We never could have dreamt this summer that this kind of improvement could 
happen," Smith says. The probability of modern telephone service has awakened 
the dormant desires of some canyon residents. Why not electricity? some are 
asking.

KEY TO CONDO LIVING? CONFORM AND BE HAPPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILFRED COUZIN, Wilfred Couzin lives in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ah, the joys of living in a community where the worries of home ownership are 
limited to the payments thereof. Where your home is a castle protected by the 
Knights of the Association. An extended family. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes overextended. The carefree aspect, the feeling that you no longer 
need worry about roof leaks, wall repairs, landscaping -- these are somewhat 
balanced by the necessity of reporting to a higher authority for permission to 
do things you have always done, no questions asked. 
</P>
<P>
The condominium arrangement may be the answer to the question, "Am I my 
brother's keeper?" You now have a father figure (the board president) and lots 
of helpful (and watchful) siblings (the committee chairmen). You may not need 
dad's permission to drive the car, but you might have to obtain agreement on 
where to park it. 
</P>
<P>
Rules and regulations abound; most of them are necessary, of course, for proper 
relationships in community living. One must, and should, defer to the will of 
the majority when one's actions might infringe on the life quality of others. 
But some of the rules seem to be produced in a constant stream, like popcorn 
from a popper -- a show of power from those who have it and wield it with zest. 
These are the negatives of condo life. 
</P>
<P>
Especially if you live, as I do, in a community with a view; people here, on a 
clear day, look out on the blue Pacific. Which makes for more problems than 
those faced by folks who live in more mundane areas. In a sea-view community, 
everyone is intent on seeing the sea. Some residents, equating view with those 
magic words property values, are constantly vigilant against any infringement 
of their line of sight to the ocean. Let a blade of grass grow too high, and 
the landscape committee gets 12 calls a day. Should a tree push its branch 
skyward a few inches past the allowable height, letters of complaint pour in, 
with copies to every member of the board, including past officers. 
</P>
<P>
Hew to the rules, and woe to those who transgress. Is that tree, or bush, 
planted a few inches into the "common area?" Out with it! No, you cannot put a 
nameplate on the door; it would conflict with the conformity of the street. 
</P>
<P>
Conformity is the key word in condominium life. You can be assured that no 
one's home will look any better than yours. No one's will look one bit 
different. When I arrive on my street (I count five before turning onto the 
drive that I think will take me home), I push my garage door opener. If a door 
rises, that's my house. (There will be lots of screaming if someone else has a 
door-opener on the same frequency as mine.) 
</P>
<P>
I hope someone in our community will propose the following resolution: 
</P>
<P>
1) In order to meet the requirements of uniformity in our community, and to 
eliminate the unsightly effects of variations, be it hereby resolved that the 
board of directors, in open session, limit the residents of the area to those 
of a standard height, weight and hair color. At some future date, a committee 
will decide on a common name for all people in the area, so that mailbox name 
plates can be properly matching in appearance. All vehicles, of course, will be 
of the same manufacture, model and color, since the sight of unmatched autos 
detracts from the beauty of our area. 
</P>
<P>
2) To protect our view of the sea, there shall be no kite flying, regardless of 
the height of the kite. Cars with high antennas and the wearing of hats shall 
be prohibited. A special ad hoc committee will investigate the possibility of 
installing retractable foliage, with control buttons to be installed in each 
home. Owners will be required to train dogs not to wag their tails in the air. 
</P>
<P>
These suggestions are, of course, intended to conform to our Rules and 
Regulations, which are outlined in a book as large as the family Bible. Like 
the Bible, the rules are subject to interpretation, according to the bias of 
the reader. Any action taken by board or committee can be justified by a 
judicious reading of some page or paragraph. 
</P>
<P>
But fear not, folks; we are well protected. Every condominium board of 
directors has a Mr. Veto to watch out for the interests of the masses. Superman 
against the entrenched leadership. If a proposal is accepted by the 
authorities, Mr. Veto looks for flaws -- sometimes he will even vehemently 
oppose a mode of action he himself has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
The committee chairmen include some interesting types, too. Like the ones who, 
in their zest to "make this the best place in the area," will spend funds so 
fast that they risk Chapter 11. Someone's gate needs a new doorknob? This is a 
great time to replace all the knobs in the area. Hey, why not put on new doors, 
too? If a yellow traffic line is being painted on the street, it's a major task 
to keep these guys from specifying gold leaf. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily for our bank account, these types are balanced by their opposite type 
-- the protectors of the purse. They dispense the association money as if it 
were the last drop of water on a 1,000-mile desert hike. The doorknob is 
faulty? Just leave the door open. Front gates coming apart? Gee whiz, a board 
nailed across the front will make it good as new. 
</P>
<P>
Differences of opinion are usually argued out vehemently, then conciliated by 
that other necessary individual, the Open Mind. Able to see all sides of all 
questions, he manages to keep opposing sides below the level of explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Tranquility is one of the primary aims of our association. To achieve this 
noble end, the board always has the final say. Unfortunately, it usually 
decides in favor of the side which is most vehement. 
</P>
<P>
Especially if the dreaded 'S' word is heard. The phrase, "I'll sue," reduces 
the bravest, most outspoken members of the board to cuddly balls of fluff -- 
however ridiculous the claim or flimsy the case. Suddenly that collection of 
regulations is no longer relevant, and the threatening claimant can accomplish 
almost anything. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the population of a condominium community, of course, does 
not go to such extremes in dealing with "management." They do not threaten 
lawsuits or bring objections to one board meeting after another. They do things 
the condominium way; they just ignore the regulation. No parking on the east 
side of the street? Who says so? Management? Well, let management park where it 
wants; we'll park where we prefer. It's independent people like these who built 
our country. I think they have all ended up in our condominium complex. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, life in Condoland is frustrating, troublesome, argumentative. But there is 
a positive side -- a bonding of people with a common purpose. Even those among 
us who present the most intrusive ideas are, in most cases, acting in what they 
believe are the best interests of all the residents (well, all except that guy 
down the street). And because of this common interest -- common ownership of a 
big part of what makes up our property value -- there is the opportunity, 
almost the necessity, for "getting together." Meaning that we meet people we 
would never have met, make friends we would never have had. 
</P>
<P>
Never have I met so large a group of people ready to help in a time of need. 
</P>
<P>
I love it here.

THE FAST SHUFFLE; 
</P>
<P>
WANT TO BE A DEALER? IT'S NO BIG DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It sounds like an orchestra made up of nothing but castanets. 
</P>
<P>
Resonant, ceaseless clicking, clicking. Rhythmic, staccato, measured, constant. 
</P>
<P>
Close your eyes and listen to it and before long a primal urge takes over and 
you begin to reach for your wallet. Because there's something about the sound 
of clattering poker chips that makes you want to get a bet down. 
</P>
<P>
But at Hai Trinh's school, the chips don't represent real money, at least not 
in the short run. They are props, teaching aids, used to train a roomful of men 
and women in the precise art of card-dealing. 
</P>
<P>
Trinh is co-owner of the Casino Card Dealers School in Westminster, a one-room 
launching pad for local card fanciers who want to deal in the card clubs of 
California (the closest such clubs are in Gardena and Bell Gardens). Graduates 
of the school are skilled in dealing super pan 9 (a form of baccarat), Asian 
poker and three other forms of poker: Texas hold 'em, five-card draw and 
seven-card stud. 
</P>
<P>
They come to the school, Trinh said, whenever they have time to spend in 
practice. At almost any time of the day, he said, students are working at one 
of the room's four tables topped by green felt, repeating again and again the 
moves they'll use daily as professional dealers. Students not dealing often act 
as players. 
</P>
<P>
The action at the tables is quick and efficient. But is it difficult? 
</P>
<P>
"Not at all," said Trinh, 27, who lives in Garden Grove and deals 
professionally at the Bicycle Club in Bell Gardens. "It does take practice, and 
some people learn faster than others. It's easier for people who have gambled 
before and know how it works. Usually, it takes about three months, but some 
people can do it in three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Physical skill with the cards and the chips is not as important, Trinh said, as 
the mental ability to know which bets to pay off, which to rake in, which hands 
win, which hands lose. 
</P>
<P>
"No, no, there's not much physical skill at all," he said. "You have to be neat 
and careful and alert. The hardest thing to do is to try to stay awake and 
alert late at night, because that's when most of your business is. And there 
are all types of people in casinos, the good and the bad. So you have to stay 
alert all the time." 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, basic physical moves must be mastered absolutely. Students 
begin with the most elementary action, the actual dealing out, one by one, of 
the cards (called pitching). They then progress to learning how to spot winning 
and losing hands, how to shuffle and finally how to oversee each of the games. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his students, he said, either are unemployed or are unsatisfied with 
their current jobs and want to become professional dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Trinh, who said he used to make his living gambling in Las Vegas, quit his 
studies as an electrical engineering major at Cal State Long Beach to become a 
dealer. His sister, a former electrical engineer, quit that profession and now 
also deals at a card club. 
</P>
<P>
The money comes mostly from tips and tends to be erratic, but "you can live 
fairly comfortably," Trinh said. 
</P>
<P>
That is one of the prime motivations for Tinh Nguyen, 20, a student who lives 
in Westminster. He has been practicing at Trinh's school for five months and 
said he will continue until next July when he turns 21 and becomes eligible to 
work in a card club. 
</P>
<P>
"You make a lot of good money," said Nguyen, "and it's exciting and 
challenging. It's fun for me because of working with numbers." 
</P>
<P>
A facile dealer, Nguyen handles stacks of chips with the aplomb of a veteran, 
quickly stacking and unstacking groups of four at a time, the professional 
dealer's way of making quick change at the table. 
</P>
<P>
However, Trinh said, great speed is not encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need speed," he said. "We need accuracy. After a while, if you go 
fast, you can see what's happening, but the customers who come in maybe once a 
week can't see what's happening. You have to let them see." 
</P>
<P>
Smoothness is the rule. Even the simple act of pitching the cards should be 
evenly paced and graceful, and the dealer must, above all, not expose any of 
the cards in the process, Trinh said. 
</P>
<P>
"They call it poetry in motion," said Joe Allenby, 32, of Downey, a 
professional dealer and friend of Trinh's who is spending time at the school 
learning to deal Asian poker in preparation for an "audition" at a card club. 
"To be smooth, it takes hours of practice. But it's better than working." 
</P>
<P>
And the students do practice. If they aren't dealing a game or acting as 
players, they may simply sit at the edge of one of the tables and pitch the 
cards into a stack on the other side, one after the other, first face down, 
then face up. Over and over. 
</P>
<P>
It is all done, Trinh said, to develop the professional dealer's most important 
asset: confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"You must be friendly with the customers," he said, "but you must always stay 
one step ahead. You have to always be sure of yourself. Sometimes a player 
tries to get away with something and makes you nervous. But it doesn't matter 
what they say. You're always right."

EMPLOYERS ARE SINGING PRAISES OF DISABLED WHO JOIN WORK FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAULA VOORHEES, Paula Voorhees is a regular contributor to Orange County 
Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andrea Pronk figures she has one of the best jobs around. 
</P>
<P>
As director of public relations for Goodwill Industries in Orange County, she 
helps provides rehabilitation, training, jobs and job-placement services for 
adolescents and adults with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"A typical case is the 45-year-old former aerospace engineer, happily married 
with grown children, who had a severe heart attack that left him with some 
brain damage," Pronk said. "He lost his job and his self-esteem. For two years 
he sat at home, doing nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Then someone referred him to Goodwill. We evaluated him and placed him in a 
job as an assembler. I couldn't help but get teary-eyed when, on the day we 
passed out paychecks, this man asked me, his voice full of wonderment, 'You 
mean I get paid for this, too?' You could see his self-worth return as he 
struggled to hide tears of joy. Instead of being a drain on society, he was now 
contributing to it by once again becoming a taxpayer." 
</P>
<P>
Goodwill is one of a handful of organizations in the county that match the 
handicapped with prospective employers, an agreement that can be beneficial to 
both, says Pronk, who has worked for Goodwill five years. 
</P>
<P>
"Disabled workers are very loyal and dependable employees," she said. "They 
have less burnout, because to them their job -- regardless of its level -- is 
their career, and they are dedicated to that job. They try very hard to be 
punctual and are an inspiration to others. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, there are certain tax benefits for those who hire the handicapped. This 
doesn't consider the psychological benefits for employers who experience growth 
. . . helping the less fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin McGowan, director of manufacturing for Earth Computer Technologies in 
Fountain Valley, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Our firm has hired enclaves of five or more disabled workers," he said. "We 
received high-quality production from happy workers." 
</P>
<P>
McGowan turned to disabled workers when faced with a labor shortage in the 
manufacture of IBM-compatible, diskless work stations and network interface 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
Another firm that's found disabled workers helpful is National Lumber. Howard 
Chapman, personnel director for the Fountain Valley-based chain of 20 stores in 
Southern California, has employed disabled workers for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
"We had trouble finding janitors for our stores," he said. "There was high 
turnover due to the low pay that such jobs merit. I felt that these were jobs 
mentally disabled people could perform, so we began using the disabled in our 
stores." 
</P>
<P>
First, however, Chapman met with store managers and explained what he wanted to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that the program would work only if the managers were enthusiastic," 
he said. "If a manager showed any hesitation, we eliminated that store from the 
trial program." 
</P>
<P>
Chapman approached Elwin Industries in Fountain Valley, which, like Goodwill 
Industries, provides training, supervision and job placement services and 
regularly appeals to employers to hire their mentally disabled clients. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a meeting with Elwin to explain the position, discuss their clients, and 
detail the job requirements," he said. "It's very important to be honest about 
your expectations and voice your feelings about the suitability of each person. 
Elwin worked with us on a one-to-one basis and guided us in hiring." 
</P>
<P>
Mentally disabled clients now work in eight stores. 
</P>
<P>
"Most start as janitors, without much customer contact," Chapman said. "This is 
because many feel insecure. But as they become more comfortable, they progress 
to other jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of Fred Snowden, a client who works in the Huntington Beach 
store. Snowden, who has Down's syndrome, "started as a janitor, but now he also 
works in motor parts, stocking oil, where he is exposed to the public," Chapman 
said with pride. 
</P>
<P>
Another disabled worker was recently named Employee of the Month in National 
Lumber's Culver City store. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so pleased with our workers that I'm slowly adding them to our remaining 
stores," Chapman said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Valentine, owner of the Brookfield Veterinary Clinic in Huntington 
Beach, was asked to hire a client as a kennel attendant. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very skeptical because this is a job of responsibility," Valentine said. 
"But I did it on a trial basis with the understanding that if it didn't work 
out, there would be no hard feelings." 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, Jay Dalton, now 43, who reported to work as Valentine's 
kennel attendant, today also helps bathe and groom dogs and cats. 
</P>
<P>
"He has his own key," Valentine said. "He arrives a half-hour before everyone 
else to begin his janitorial duties. I was so impressed that I've hired two 
other clients. I've had high school and college students work for me who don't 
do as good a job as Jay does. This is his profession, and he's very dedicated." 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Rehabilitation deals primarily with the physically 
disabled. "Clients come to us for job training and placement from all over," 
said Carol Weirbeky, program supervisor for the department's Santa Ana office. 
"Rehabilitation is for people who have been in the work force, but for some 
reason like accident or injury were idled, and now seek to return." 
</P>
<P>
To be accepted into the state program, applicants must meet three criteria: 
They must have a disability; it must interfere with their ability to work; and 
there must be a reasonable expectation that they can return to work, said 
Weirbeky, who has worked in the rehab program for 26 years, 15 in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Then, a client meets with a rehab counselor for assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"We go over his aptitude, interests and abilities," Weirbeky said. "We consider 
training for him, if needed. All training, supplies and transportation are at 
no cost to the client. If the disabled could benefit from college training in 
order to maintain a job, the state will pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
Weirbeky has counselors who help find jobs for clients. "The counselors monitor 
the employee for 60 days," Weirbeky said. "Employers can call in with a job 
description, which is then put into the computer so counselors in all offices 
have access to it." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Halton, an employment coordinator for Elwin Industries, said, "We have 10 
clients for every available job, so we can provide a significant labor force in 
an area where there's an acute shortage of unskilled labor. We are constantly 
seeking more jobs for our clients." 
</P>
<P>
While there are tax benefits available to employers, some, like Chapman of 
National Lumber, seek a higher reward. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't take the tax write-off because our disabled employees are treated 
like our other employees," Chapman said. "We don't like to think we're paid to 
employ them. They are paid because they are doing a good job. We feel companies 
should get involved in their communities and help the less fortunate without a 
purely financial incentive. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies that aren't are losing out on good employees, good will and personal 
growth by not going that extra mile."

NATION RINGS IN SEASON OF SPENDING; 
</P>
<P>
SHOPPING: DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING FINDS HORDES OF AMERICANS HUNGRY FOR HOLIDAY 
BARGAINS.

<P>
Customers clutching credit cards and wish lists joined by children eager for a 
glimpse of Santa Claus crammed into stores around the country today in the 
traditional start of the post-Thanksgiving buying spree. 
</P>
<P>
Old-fashioned holiday spirit mixed with a hunger for bargains sent shoppers and 
browsers out in force, promising to produce a day worthy of its billing as the 
busiest one of the year for merchants. 
</P>
<P>
The six B. Altman &amp; Co. department stores in New York, New Jersey and 
Pennsylvania that are closing down -- financially struggling parent company 
Hooker Corp. couldn't find a buyer for the chain -- drew hordes of people to 
their liquidation sales. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd clamoring to get inside B. Altman's main store in Manhattan was so 
heavy that shoppers had to be admitted in shifts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having an unbelievable day," said Brenda Smith, secretary for the 
manager at Altman's in Short Hills, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Other store managers in many areas reported customers lined up outside waiting 
for doors to open, a hopeful sign in the most crucial season of a year that so 
far has been slow for retailers. 
</P>
<P>
At Bloomingdale's department store in Manhattan, customers lined up early in 
numbingly cold weather to get a jump on their holiday shopping, and surged 
inside when the doors opened at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We're filling up with people rapidly," Bloomingdale's spokeswoman Ann Stock

Early shoppers at Bloomingdale's grabbed mittens, gloves, scarfs and hats. 
Others made a beeline for the coat department. New York's first Thanksgiving 
snowfall in 51 years combined with sub-freezing temperatures apparently put 
people in the mood to buy warm clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers streamed into suburban malls and downtowns nationwide hoping to get as 
much gift buying done as possible at the start of the peak shopping season. Big 
markdowns on merchandise at some troubled stores lured bargain-hunters while 
shoppers elsewhere scanned the aisles for hard-to-find items, such as the 
popular Nintendo video games. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Claus at Crabtree Valley Mall in Raleigh, N.C., said most of the 
several dozen children that had confided their requests to him this morning 
asked for Nintendo items. 
</P>
<P>
Operators of Southern California malls extended their hours today, but found 
shoppers already waiting when they opened for business. 
</P>
<P>
"There were people waiting for us to open when I got here at 7:20 this morning, 
even though we weren't going to open until 8," said Clair Griffith, general 
manager of the 180-store Puente Hills Mall in the City of Industry in eastern 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the region, parking lots were jamming up early. 
</P>
<P>
"The day after Thanksgiving and the day after Christmas are the two days each 
year that we fill up the lot," said Nora Levy, marketing director of the 
140-store Santa Anita Fashion Park in Arcadia, which has 5,200 parking spaces.

5 SHOT, 2 KILLED, IN WESTLAKE

Two men were shot and killed and three others were wounded, including a 
16-year-old pregnant girl shot in the stomach, all within the same Westlake 
neighborhood on the first night of the Thanksgiving holiday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the shootings were linked to an ongoing territorial war between an 
established Latino gang and a newly formed, but unusually reckless, gang made 
up mostly of first-generation Salvadoran youths, said Los Angeles Police 
Detective Andy Cicoria. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings began at 4:45 p.m. Thursday when a 26-year-old woman "walking on 
the sidewalk and minding her own business caught a stray bullet in the neck," 
said Detective Terry Wessel. The woman was paralyzed from the neck down but was 
listed in stable condition Friday at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:30 p.m. the 16-year-old girl was shot in the stomach and left knee in a 
drive-by incident, Wessel said. The girl was hospitalized in critical 
condition, but the condition of her 4-month-old fetus was not immediately 
known. 
</P>
<P>
Another man died a block and a half away in a gang-related shooting about 6 
a.m. today, Wessel said. 
</P>
<P>
In an incident apparently unrelated to the gang war, another man was shot to 
death late Thursday in a drug-related incident at the intersection of 6th 
Street and Westlake Boulevard, Wessel said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were dropping like flies around here," Wessel said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Milos Jakes and the rest of his hard-line Communist leadership resigned today 
after an unprecedented week of massive pro-democracy protests that had urged 
them to quit. 
</P>
<P>
While the shaken Communist Party Central Committee met in emergency session, 
Alexander Dubcek, the "Prague Spring" reformer Jakes ousted in 1968 after a 
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia, made a triumphant return to the capital 
before 300,000 cheering and flag-waving protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"An old wise man said: 'If there once was light, why should there be darkness 
again?' Let us act in such a way to bring the light back again," Dubcek told 
the jubilant crowd in Wenceslas Square. 
</P>
<P>
Later, upon hearing word of the resignation of the entire Politburo, Dubcek and 
top dissidents at a news conference in a theater jumped to their feet, shouted 
"Hurrah!" and hugged each other for joy. 
</P>
<P>
Jakes was the third East Bloc leader to fall from power in a little more than a 
month as support for the reforms instituted by Soviet leader Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev gains momentum. 
</P>
<P>
The resignations were offered at a closed-door session of the Central 
Committee, which was expected to approve them without delay. A new leadership 
will be elected by secret ballot, said the state-run news agency, CTK. 
</P>
<P>
Jakes said the party had not instituted reforms quickly enough and had 
underestimated the effect of the pro-democracy movement sweeping Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia's leaders, who were installed after Warsaw Pact tanks crushed 
Dubcek's reform movement in 1968, had resisted most of the reforms adopted by 
their formerly hard-line Communist allies. 
</P>
<P>
Since Nov. 17, hundreds of thousands of people have filled the streets of 
Prague and other cities demanding democratic reforms and the end of the 
Communist monopoly on power. They have been the largest demonstrations in the 
nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
"For a week, our capital lives in a feverish atmosphere accompanied by large 
demonstrations," CTK quoted Jakes as saying. "The tension is gradually 
spreading to other places in the republic. We must openly say that our country 
is at a fatal crossroads." 
</P>
<P>
"We have underestimated completely the processes taking place in Poland, 
Hungary and especially recently in East Germany and their effect and influence 
on our society," said Jakes, who was responsible for the expulsion from the 
party of half a million Communists, including Dubcek. 
</P>
<P>
Dubcek, 67, made his first public appearance in Prague since the party purge in 
June, 1970. Since his ouster, he has worked as a low-level employee of the 
state forestry services and has lived in virtual seclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"Dubcek, Dubcek!" and "Long live Dubcek!" the crowd yelled as he appeared in 
Wenceslas Square, the site of repeated pro-democracy demonstrations. He urged 
them to unite to improve the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The ideal of socialism with a human face is living in the conditions of a new 
generation," Dubcek said. "We must unify to raise our country to a higher 
level."

JAPAN OFFERS SMALL LOAN TO AID POLAND

Japan today pledged a $150-million loan for "remote" Poland and said it is 
considering other aid to Poland and Hungary to help relieve their economic 
crises and promote democratic reform. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the U.S. Congress has voted $864.5 million in outright aid to 
Poland, France has pledged $645 million and West Germany has offered $1.62 
billion in trade credits. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's low-interest loan would be used for Poland's currency stabilization 
program, said Mayumi Moriyama, the chief Cabinet secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is also considering loans through the Export-Import Bank to cover trade 
and investment insurance for Hungary and is studying plans to provide emergency 
food aid to Poland and technical assistance to both countries, said Kenzo 
Oshima, director of the Aid Policy Division at the Foreign Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why Japan was giving a loan rather than a grant, Oshima conceded Poland 
probably would have been happier with a grant. 
</P>
<P>
"It is up to each country to decide what fits," he said. "The U.S. apparently 
felt a grant would be more preferable. . . . As far as Japan is concerned, we 
felt a concessional loan would meet, if not 100% of their requirements, at 
least an important part." 
</P>
<P>
Japan has defended its relatively slow development of an aid package for 
Eastern Europe by saying the region is remote from Japan and relations had not 
been important during the time those countries, as members of the Soviet Bloc, 
had little independence. 
</P>
<P>
"It can't be denied that part of the world is remote," Oshima said. "It is not 
something like China or Korea to Japan."

A parliamentary commission accused Swiss prosecutors today of doing little to 
stop drug and money-laundering international networks from pumping billions of 
dollars through Swiss companies. 
</P>
<P>
It said Swiss justice authorities were too soft on organized crime and even 
failed to probe charges that Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie was using cocaine 
profits to buy military hardware for Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
"The threat posed by organized crime has been recognized too late by the 
federal prosecutor's office," the special investigative commission report said. 
"The fight against international drug traders and money-laundering has been 
assigned too little importance."

CARTEL CZAR ESCAPES POLICE DRAGNET IN COLOMBIA

Fugitive cocaine czar Pablo Escobar Gaviria escaped in his underwear into 
Colombia's northern jungles, eluding raids by soldiers who killed two of his 
Medellin cartel bodyguards and captured 55 suspects, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers fanned out today in helicopters and speedboats across Colombia's 
densely forested Antioquia state, near a ranch allegedly controlled by Escobar, 
the reputed head of Colombia's most powerful cocaine empire, who is wanted for 
extradition to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Escobar seems to be in the area," Gen. Octavio Vargas, the National Police 
operations director, told Bogota's Caracol radio. "We are going to continue the 
search as long as necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Vargas confirmed previous reports that Escobar escaped in only his underwear as 
police and army helicopters on Thursday assaulted the ranch house in the 
Magdalena River valley where he had been hiding. 
</P>
<P>
Medellin drug chieftain Jose Rodriguez Gacha and one of the drug-trafficking 
Ochoa brothers also were believed to have escaped the raids that began 
Wednesday night and continued Thursday, Vargas said. 
</P>
<P>
Two members of Escobar's private army were killed and five wounded in the 
fighting, said Brig. Gen. Miguel Antonio Gomez Padilla, commander of the 
National Police. There were no reported security force casualties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers arrested 55 bodyguards and reputed associates, whose fierce fighting 
apparently allowed Escobar and other cartel leaders to escape, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Escobar's personal documents and a telephone list containing the names of 
people closely linked to Escobar were found at the ranch, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Escobar, Gacha and the Ochoa brothers -- Jorge Luis, Juan David and Fabio -- 
allegedly run the Medellin cocaine cartel, the country's most prominent drug 
ring. The Medellin network reportedly supplies 80% of the cocaine consumed in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Escobar, a former congressman who reportedly started his infamous career as a 
car thief, is one of the richest men in the world, with holdings estimated at 
$2 billion. He is wanted on drug trafficking charges by U.S. courts in Florida, 
Louisiana and Colorado. Washington has requested his extradition. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently awakened by the approaching helicopters, Escobar fled with 10 
bodyguards, leaving behind a shirt with his personal identification card in the 
breast pocket, news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
The force of Colombian soldiers, police and undercover security agents seized 
four cartel-controlled ranches and an array of jeeps, speedboats, weapons and 
two-way radios, Vargas said. 
</P>
<P>
The Magdalena River valley, 90 miles north of Bogota, is a drug cartel 
stronghold and home of several right-wing paramilitary groups. 
</P>
<P>
The raids were the closest authorities have come to capturing a top kingpin 
since the government launched an all-out offensive on the drug mafia in August. 
</P>
<P>
Eight Colombians accused of drug trafficking have been sent to the United 
States since President Virgilio Barco Vargas re-established extradition on Aug. 
18 after a string of assassinations attributed to the cocaine cartels.

JAPAN GOVERNMENT WARNS 2 FIRMS ABOUT LOW BIDS

<P>
Japan's Fair Trade Commission today issued "stern warnings" to two Japanese 
computer manufacturers that may have engaged in unfair trade practices by 
bidding one yen on local government projects. 
</P>
<P>
After several weeks of investigation, the commission decided the bids of one 
yen, the equivalent of 0.7 cents, made by Fujitsu Ltd. and NEC Corp. required 
"stern warnings," said Takashi Yamamoto of the FTC's Trade Practices Division. 
</P>
<P>
The commission said the low bids, made on contracts to design computer software 
for several city governments, were judged likely to be "unjust low-price sales" 
and "customer inducement by unjust benefits" under the Unfair Trade Practices 
chapter of the Anti-Monopoly Law. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC's decision stopped short of saying the bids had violated the law but 
warned if the two companies make excessively low bids again, there was a strong 
possibility the "Anti-Monopoly Law would be applicable." 
</P>
<P>
NEC said in a statement that it had "reflected deeply on the social outcry over 
careless bidding" and had taken measures to ensure it would not occur again. 
</P>
<P>
Fujitsu also issued a statement saying it had taken steps to prevent such 
problems and repeated a request to Hiroshima and Nagano officials to cancel the 
contracts won with low bids. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Fujitsu won a contract to design computer software for the 
Hiroshima city water supply system with a one-yen bid, several other such cases 
surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
Fujitsu and NEC were found to have submitted bids of one yen to design software 
for libraries in Nagano in central Japan and for planning an information system 
for Wakayama prefecture in western Japan. Fujitsu won both contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The commission said Fujitsu also won a contract to develop a culture and 
educational information system for Hiroshima with a $700 bid and with a $70 bid 
won another contract to conduct a feasibility study on a library computer 
system for Saitama prefecture near Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"These cases are not common, but recently there has been a sudden increase that 
seems to indicate a trend," the commission's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Yamamoto said it was uncertain whether the FTC ruling would affect the 
contracts. "We cannot legally say whether the contracts should be carried out 
or not. The local government officials and Fujitsu will have to discuss that 
issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The deals provoked criticism over what U.S. officials charged was weak 
enforcement of Japan's antitrust laws. FTC officials say warnings are strict 
enough to enforce compliance with fair trade rules.

General Motors Corp. said today it has sold about 5% of its holdings in Isuzu 
Motors Ltd., dropping its stake in the Japanese auto maker to 38.2% and earning 
about $82 million after taxes. 
</P>
<P>
GM and Isuzu have been associated for 18 years. Currently, Isuzu makes the Geo 
Storm subcompact car for GM, which is sold through the U.S. auto maker's 
Chevrolet dealers. 
</P>
<P>
GM sold about 20 million shares of Isuzu to Japanese financial institutions 
that already own shares of Isuzu, said GM Executive Vice President John F. 
Smith Jr. 
</P>
<P>
GM spokesman John Pekarek said the company decided to sell the shares "to take 
advantage of our initial investment." He said the sale was completed with a 
handful of institutions at the same time it was announced.

The Forum des Halles is a huge multistory complex in the heart of Paris near 
the Louvre. It is the largest and busiest shopping center in the French 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the deal, which would be Nippon's first investment in French 
real estate, would have to be approved by the Japanese Finance Ministry.

A controlling stake in Rockefeller Center, a New York landmark and a symbol of 
U.S. capitalism, was sold to Japan's Mitsubishi Estate Co. for $846 million

<P>
Nippon, a major life insurer, already has stakes in the French travel company 
Club Mediterranee and construction group Bouygues.

<P>
France last March cleared the sale of one of its top cognac houses to a 
Japanese concern, part of a growing drive by the Japanese into the French 
luxury goods sector. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Paris restaurant Lucas-Carton, which has a prestigious three-star 
ranking in the Michelin gastronomic bible, and the jet-setters' hair salon 
Carita have been sold to Japanese interests.

Game show host Bob Barker, joined by 2,500 animal rights activists, marched 
down New York City's Fifth Avenue today telling holiday shoppers the price is 
always wrong when you're buying fur. 
</P>
<P>
Barker, the host of "The Price Is Right," led the marchers for the second 
straight year past chic shops in midtown Manhattan during the fourth annual 
"Fur-Free Friday" event. 
</P>
<P>
In Miami, vandals painted over a fur storage company's windows. Protests were 
scheduled in cities around the country on the opening day of the holiday 
shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, standing behind Barker was Gary Kaskel of Manhattan, who walked 
with his two pet fitch ferrets, which are related to minks and often used for 
furs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good image to let people see the animals alive," said Kaskel, petting 
the animals. "People don't see the animals in the traps, so you have to let 'em 
see them alive, see how sweet they are."

Kissing and fisticuffs were part of Errol Flynn's life even when the legendary 
Hollywood hero was a schoolboy. 
</P>
<P>
London auction house Christie's plans to offer a rare collection of six signed 
love letters next month that the film star penned from his London boarding 
school to a friend's sister, Mary White. 
</P>
<P>
"My dear Mary . . . I was jolly angry with your brother yesterday because he 
advertised to a lot of the third form that I had arranged to go out with you, 
of course I slapped their gobs (mouths)," the 13-year-old future swashbuckler 
wrote in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later he wrote: "My dear Mary . . . You struck the right thing about 
those kisses, there is not much in them on paper, but they are all right when 
they are real, by Jove, I know, don't you, I should think you would." 
</P>
<P>
Flynn, who died of a heart attack in 1959, wrote about the school in his 
autobiography, "My Wicked, Wicked Ways." He said the two years he spent there 
were the most dismal of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Carey Wallace of Christie's said today: "I can't imagine there are any earlier 
Flynn love letters. They give some fascinating insights into the frustrations 
of his youth." 
</P>
<P>
The letters, which are expected to fetch about $1,500, will be auctioned along 
with a pair of bowler hats that belonged to Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy and 
imitation diamonds owned by actress Mae West.

GARRISON KEILLOR: FROM PRAIRIE RADIO TO THE N. Y. JUNGLE

It's been more than two years since Garrison Keillor left gentle Lake Wobegon, 
but public radio's favorite storyteller says he's not worried about stepping up 
to the microphone again, even if the stage is in rough-and-tumble Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to become nervous, you know, at the right time. I count on it," said 
Keillor, who returns to the airwaves with a new weekly program. "But I hope 
that it doesn't raise the pitch in my voice. I think I'm counted on to sing 
bass parts." 
</P>
<P>
"Garrison Keillor's American Radio Company of the Air," which premieres on 
public radio stations Saturday will once again feature Keillor's soft voice -- 
"I'm going to sing just ever so slightly less than people would like me to." 
</P>
<P>
But he insists the new, live show will not be a spinoff of "A Prairie Home 
Companion," which attracted 4 million listeners each week on American Public 
Radio. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm doing is taking 13 years of experience doing one kind of live radio 
variety show in one place and I'm using that to create a different one, a 
different one in a different place," he said in a recent interview, sitting 
behind a desk stacked with books at his Manhattan office. 
</P>
<P>
Keillor's plans for this season's 20 shows include "classic American music of 
all kinds." Singer Eileen Farrell, pianist James Tocco and opera star Marilyn 
Horne are scheduled to guest star. 
</P>
<P>
And the 47-year-old humorist says his monologues will return, but with less of 
a focus on the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
"I've a lot of things I want to talk about, some of which have to do about New 
York," he said. "But I don't have any need to do a routine on New York."

Tammy Faye Bakker, in Minnesota for about a week to visit her husband, says 
that imprisoned former television evangelist Jim Bakker is "doing as well as 
can be expected." Mrs. Bakker, accompanied by the couple's son, Jamie, and 
Bakker's sister, Donna Puckett, spent about six hours on Thanksgiving Day at 
the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minn., where Jim Bakker is serving at 
least the first months of his 45-year prison term for fraud and conspiracy. 
"We're very thankful we could be together on Thanksgiving," Tammy Faye said. 
"We had a nice visit."

"PIGLET SIDLED up to Pooh from behind. 'Pooh,' he whispered. 'Yes, Piglet.' 
'Nothing,' said Piglet, taking Pooh's paw. 'I just wanted to be sure of you.' " 
</P>
<P>
This is from A. A. Milne's "Winnie The Pooh" and is probably the thing that 
made Dorothy Parker, the "Constant Reader" of The New Yorker, write, "Tonstant 
Reader frowed up!" 
</P>
<P>
AS LONG as we are in a positive vein, let's send up a post-Thanksgiving hosanna 
for the Walt Disney guys and their new production, "The Little Mermaid," the 
first traditional fairy tale of its kind from the Disney animators since 1959, 
when they released "Sleeping Beauty." What a winner for the coming Christmas 
season! And if you have noticed that some Disney commercials appeal to kids, 
while others appeal to grown-ups, well, that's how the film goes as well. This 
wonderful experience is a treat for everybody in the family.

I loved the crab impresario, Sebastian (voice by Samuel E. Wright), and his 
Jamaican and calypso and reggae styles. Then there is Ursula, the sea witch, 
looking divine and with the voice of actress Pat Carroll. Kudos to "Little Shop

H-E-R-E-'S EDDIE! The "Tonight Show" sidekick, Ed McMahon, is going to wed his

divorce from wife, Victoria, will be all over and done with. Ed already told 
Joanna to go out and buy them a new house in the $5-million range. Joanna has 
found a place in the $8-million category. Not bad for a restaurant maitre d'

SOCIAL SPLITS from the nation's capital: Muffy and Henry Brandon have separated

IF YOU think Kathleen Sullivan looks better and acts happier these days on "CBS 
This Morning," it's most likely because she IS. Kathleen had some rough times 
earlier this year, particularly when her parents were seriously injured in an 
automobile accident. I believe Kathleen had trouble finding a sympathetic ear 
at CBS for her personal problems. But now her parents are doing well. And 
Kathleen is "working out" these days with a fabulous new trainer. And, she has 
a new executive producer, Eric Sorenson of L.A.'s KCBS, who has helped smooth 
her path. 
</P>
<P>
"THE LISBON TRAVIATA" is another reason to go to the Big Apple. This wonderful 
Terrence McNally play will slay you if you love opera; but even if you are like 
Jiggs of the comic strips, you'll enjoy it. Beverly Sills celebrated her 33rd 
wedding anniversary a week ago by dropping in to see it with hubby Peter 
Greenough. The opera diva just adored it; "It knocked me out," says she.

SKIER BOUVIER RULED WINNER OF WORLD CUP

Nathalie Bouvier of France captured today's women's World Cup giant slalom 
after a jury overruled a protest on her first run. 
</P>
<P>
Bouvier, who was not declared the leader until well after the opening run 
because there was a question about whether she had missed a gate, did not 
appear upset for the second run. 
</P>
<P>
Following the opening run, a jury talked with the gatekeeper and reviewed the 
videotape, then declared her the leader over Diann Roffe of the United States 
with a time of 1:08.37. 
</P>
<P>
Bouvier turned in an even better time of 1:07.60 on her second run for a 
two-run unofficial total of 2:15.97. 
</P>
<P>
Roffe, a giant slalom specialist who won the world championship in 1985, 
finished the first run on the artificial surface in 1:09.06 as light snow fell. 
Her 1:08.14 on the second run gave her a two-run total of 2:17.20 and placed 
her ahead of Austria's Anita Wachter, who finished 1.54 seconds off Bouvier's 
pace at 2:17.51. 
</P>
<P>
Katjusa Pusnik of Yugoslavia finished fourth at 2:17.65 and Zoe Haas of 
Switzerland was fifth at 2:17.86. West Germans Michaela Gerg and Christine 
Meier were next at 2:17.93 and 2:18.26. 
</P>
<P>
Switzerland's Vreni Schneider, coming off the best season in the history of the 
sport, fell on her first run, but she said she'll be ready to go for Saturday's 
slalom run. 
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow is another day, and I hope to do better," she said, following her 
first run of the new season. "It is just one race. The snow was no problem. I 
had trouble with my inside ski."

Ray Floyd said in September that he did not want to captain the U.S. Ryder Cup 
team in 1991. He arrived for this weekend's Skins Game and said he has changed 
his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to do it. It was one of the most memorable experiences I've had in 
golf," Floyd said today. 
</P>
<P>
He served as captain of the 12-man American team that tied Europe's best in the 
biennial Ryder Cup matches in September. He said then that he didn't want to do 
it again. 
</P>
<P>
Since World War II, no one has served as an American Ryder Cup captain in 
successive matches. The captain, selected by the PGA of America, is expected to 
be named next spring. 
</P>
<P>
"I would certainly do it if I was asked," Floyd said. "But that has not been 
the precedent."

Phoenix Cardinals interim head Coach Hank Kuhlmann has decided to change 
quarterbacks and will give second-year pro Tom Tupa his second career NFL start 
in Sunday's game here against Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhlmann, a fourth-year assistant who took over Monday for the fired Gene 
Stallings, said he asked offensive coordinator Jim Shofner for a recommendation 
Wednesday and Shofner suggested Tupa. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-4 Tupa, a third-round draft pick in 1988 out of Ohio State, made his 
first career start here Oct. 15 against the Eagles and completed 14 of 41 
passes for 266 yards. But he also threw six interceptions and was sacked six 
times in a 17-5 loss. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's 37-14 road loss to the Rams, Stallings benched Gary Hogeboom 
early and Tupa completed 7 of 12 passes for 114 yards and one TD before rookie 
Tim Rosenbach finished up in his NFL debut.

The Miami Hurricanes have been ordered not to taunt, and Notre Dame has been 
warned not to brawl. So, Saturday night's action at the Orange Bowl may be 
limited to tackles and touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Few complaints are likely, since the showdown between the top-ranked Fighting 
Irish (11-0) and seventh-ranked Miami (9-1) is one of the year's biggest games. 
The Hurricanes view it as a rematch; they lost at South Bend, Ind., last year, 
31-30, and that was the margin by which Notre Dame won the national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
The rivalry is heated, partly because the teams have contrasting reputations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the Miami Vice image against the Pope image," Hurricanes tackle Mike 
Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
"Convicts versus Catholics," Miami safety Charles Pharms said. "Pure, wholesome 
young men against these vile, nasty boys that should be in prison. I dislike 
that. But that's part of the thing that keeps us fired up for this game." 
</P>
<P>
The teams fought in a stadium tunnel before last year's game. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, eventual Heisman Trophy winner Tim Brown of Notre Dame complained 
about the Hurricanes' taunting after they won 24-0. In 1985, the Irish accused 
Miami of running up the score after a 58-7 loss. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, the head coaches and athletic directors from both schools met to 
soothe resentment. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get two great teams together, sometimes tempers flare," Miami 
first-year Coach Dennis Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was concerned about what happened, but that's over and done with. 
What's important is playing the game itself. I don't think there'll be a 
confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the least bit concerned," Holtz said. "I don't think we have any 
bitter feelings toward Miami. . . . This is the rivalry right now that kind of 
excites us, because we've had some degree of success, and Miami has had 
tremendous success." 
</P>
<P>
After Notre Dame engaged in another tunnel fight before this fall's game at 
home against Southern Cal, Holtz said he'll resign if it happens again. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson, meanwhile, has issued orders against taunting and gloating. Such 
behavior has been as much a part of Miami football as great quarterbacks, and 
Notre Dame guard Tim Grunhard expects it to continue. 
</P>
<P>
"Miami will try to intimidate; that's the way they play football," he said. "If 
they're pointing fingers and that kind of thing, I'll look them in the eyeand 
say, 'Hey, I'll see you next play.' 
</P>
<P>
"Notre Dame isn't going to be intimidated. We've won 23 games in a row. We're a 
powerhouse now." 
</P>
<P>
And the Fighting Irish respect Miami as a powerhouse, too, Grunhard said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the players see the game as good versus evil. I think we see it 
as the two powers in this part of the decade clashing." 
</P>
<P>
That it is. While Notre Dame has the nation's longest winning streak, the 
Hurricanes have won 32 of their past 34 games, and 31 in a row at home. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish have Heisman Trophy contender Tony Rice at quarterback; 
Miami has the nation's top defense. The Hurricanes, bound for a Sugar Bowl date 
where they'll likely play unbeaten Alabama, remain in contention to finish No. 
1. Notre Dame, bound for an Orange Bowl berth against No. 2 Colorado, is the 
front-runner in the national championship race. 
</P>
<P>
"We're like being in the Final Four in basketball," Holtz said. "We've come 
down to the last two games. We've come a long way, but we've got a long way to 
go."

American Hubert Green shot a 67 -- the day's best score -- for a one-stroke 
lead today at the halfway mark of the $714,000 Casio World Open golf 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Green, winner of the tournament in 1985, sank a 6-foot birdie putt on the 
508-yard, par-5 18th hole to wrest the lead from first-round pacesetter 
Naomichi Ozaki of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Green also had seven birdies and three bogeys over the 7,014-yard, par-72 
Kaimon course of the Ibusuki Golf Club. He completed the two trips at 135, 9 
under par. 
</P>
<P>
"I am now in top shape," Green said. "I'm shooting at will, and my putting was 
also pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Ozaki, coming off consecutive second-place finishes, carded a 70. Toru Nakamura 
of Japan was alone in third place at 137. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Mize, winner of last week's Dunlop Phoenix tournament, shot a 71 to drop 
to a fourth-place tie with fellow American Mark Calcavecchia at 138. The 
British Open champion carded a 69.

SUPER MARIO CAN SALUTE WHEN FLAG IS HOISTED

Super Mario, undefeated in four starts over the turf, holds a decided edge in 
grass experience over his competition in Saturday's $115,600 Hoist the Flag 
Stakes at Hollywood Park as 10 of the 13 entrants have never started on the 
lawn. 
</P>
<P>
The Grade II stakes for 2-year-olds will be run at a mile and is the third of 
four $100,000-added stakes to be contested over the holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Super Mario, Lituanien and Stratified have started over the turf. Super Mario 
won the Southampton Breeders' Cup at Philadelphia on Oct. 9 and the Grade II 
Pilgrim Handicap at Aqueduct on Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Lituanien had a win and a third in France and was second in the Manila Handicap 
at Gulfstream on Nov. 5. The colt by King of Macedon out of Rose River by 
Riverman blew out three furlongs over the Hollywood Park lawn in :35.4. Trained 
by Frenchman Christian Doumen, Lituanien will have Corey Black to guide him in 
his local debut. 
</P>
<P>
Stratified, who was claimed out a six-length maiden win for $40,000 by Julio 
Canani, has since finished third, fourth and sixth after leaving the maiden 
ranks. The gelded son of Balzac made his first start over the lawn opening day 
against allowance foes at one mile and finished sixth, beaten by seven lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Breeders' Cup Juvenile participants Pleasant Tap and Single Dawn will be making 
their initial start over the lawn in the Hoist the Flag. Pleasant Tap prepped 
for the race with an excellent :47.0 four-furlong work over the course on 
Thursday. The come-from-behind winner of the seven-furlong Sunny Slope should 
be a late threat in race. 
</P>
<P>
Single Dawn -- fifth in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, third in the Del Mar 
Futurity and second in the Norfolk Stakes at Santa Anita, all Grade I events -- 
will be reunited with jockey Alex Solis for the Hoist the Flag. Solis rode 
Single Dawn in his first three starts and was aboard for his maiden win at Del 
Mar and his third place finish in the Del Mar Futurity. Single Dawn is second 
in the field in earnings with $166,880. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar Futurity winner Drag Race will be making his debut on the turf in the 
Hoist the Flag. The top money earner in the field with $309,938 has placed in 
five stakes. He was second in the Alameda County Futurity at Pleasanton, third 
in the De Anza, second in the Balboa Stakes and winner of the Del Mar Futurity, 
all at Del Mar. He was second in the Desert Wine Stakes at Santa Anita on Nov. 
1.
