</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the summer, the 37-year-old woman had been sail boarding and winning 
tennis tournaments. Then she began to experience insidious pains in the temples 
and jaws. Later the pain spread throughout her body. It became so intense that 
"it hurt to put my sunglasses on," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Her doctors had found extremely high numbers of the uncommon white blood cell 
known as the eosinophil in her blood stream. But despite an exhaustive medical 
workup, including exploratory abdominal surgery, they "were completely 
baffled." 
</P>
<P>
When Dr. William Blevins, a Taos oncologist, reviewed the case at St. Vincent 
Hospital in late October, he was struck by a tantalizing clue: From July until 
September, the woman had taken supplements of the essential amino acid 
L-tryptophan each night to help her sleep. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a 44-year-old Los Alamos housewife and a 37-year-old Santa Fe 
restaurant hostess were seeking medical treatment for severe muscle pains. They 
too had been taking tryptophan pills for insomnia and were found to have 
strikingly high eosinophil counts. 
</P>
<P>
Within days, Blevins and three other physicians -- a medical school classmate 
who was treating the Los Alamos housewife, a rheumatologist who was consulting 
on two of the three cases, and a Mayo Clinic immunologist who is a leading 
authority on eosinophils -- had made the connection between preparations of the 
amino acid and a potentially fatal condition, now known as the 
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians increasingly rely on complex technology and testing procedures to 
diagnose disease. But the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome illustrates how some 
clinical advances are still made the old-fashioned way -- by talking to 
patients and carefully piecing together their histories. Like many medical 
discoveries, this one combined instinct, detective work, and some incredible 
strokes of luck. 
</P>
<P>
As of Nov. 22, there had been 427 reported cases nationwide of the previously 
unrecognized disorder, including 69 in California, and two confirmed deaths, 
according to the Centers for Disease Control. About a third of the first 85 
reported patients have been hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has ordered a recall of products in which 
tryptophan is the sole or major component, and several states, including 
California, have banned tryptophan sales. The public has been warned not to 
take tryptophan capsules or tablets until it is determined if the amino acid 
itself, a chemical or microbiological impurity, or perhaps a predisposition for 
some individuals to develop the disorder is to blame for the epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
Medical progress, such as the discovery of the AIDS virus or the tick-borne 
bacterium that causes Lyme disease, often results from exhaustive 
epidemiological and laboratory research. But these developments were possible 
because connections were made between puzzling patients -- the gay men in Los 
Angeles in 1981 with the unusual lung infections or the cluster of children 
with rashes and arthritis in the region of Lyme, Conn., in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, many apparent clusters of illnesses, such as cancers, turn 
out to be coincidences and not true associations. As a result, sometimes 
potential clues to new knowledge are prematurely dismissed as "red herrings," 
while in other instances, physicians or the public cling to discredited 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
In New Mexico, "it was clear at the outset that something unusual was going 
on," said Dr. Phillip Hertzman, the Los Alamos family practitioner. "But I 
think it was luck that we talked to each other." Otherwise, Hertzman said the 
connection might have gone unrecognized for "months." 
</P>
<P>
"I have been in this game a while and when I see lightning strike once, I get a 
little suspicious, twice, more suspicious, and three times, we better take it 
very seriously," said Dr. Gerald J. Gleich, the Mayo Clinic immunologist who 
discussed the cases by telephone with the New Mexico doctors and first notified 
New Mexico and federal health officials of the illness cluster. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of cases have been in women, who appear more likely to take 
tryptophan-containing products than men. Because some estimate that tens of 
thousands to hundreds of thousands of people may be using the supplements, 
health officials expect many more cases to develop. 
</P>
<P>
Tryptophan supplements have been increasingly used during the 1980s, not only 
for insomnia and premenstrual syndrome, but also for depression and stress 
reduction, attention deficits in children, and weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the illnesses seem to have developed since July, although there have 
been sporadic reports of problems that began earlier. Some patients had only 
taken tryptophan for a matter of weeks before they became ill; others had taken 
it for several years. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem has probably been going on at a low-grade level and for some 
reason spurted this summer," said Dr. Henry Falk, director of the CDC's 
environmental hazards and health effects division. Recent studies in New 
Mexico, Minnesota and Oregon "appear to have very strongly linked the actual 
taking of these tablets and capsules with the disease." 
</P>
<P>
Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Tryptophan is one of the 
essential amino acids that is a necessary part of the diet because it cannot be 
synthesized by humans. 
</P>
<P>
In adults, the average daily dietary intake of tryptophan is slightly more than 
one gram (0.04 ounces). The amino acid is contained in proteins found in meat, 
eggs, dairy products and other foods. The syndrome has developed in people who 
were taking from as little as 200 milligrams of tryptophan supplements daily to 
as much as 18 grams a day, according to Falk. The average amount has been about 
two grams. 
</P>
<P>
Many researchers are suspicious that some form of contamination will eventually 
be identified, perhaps involving one of a handful of Japanese companies that 
make virtually all of the tryptophan contained in products that have been sold 
in the United States or some of the many American companies that repackage and 
distribute the products. 
</P>
<P>
Of the tryptophan users who have become sick, a few -- like the Santa Fe woman 
who was hospitalized -- have been more seriously ill than others. Some 
"basically have sore flesh" while others "have serious organ damage," according 
to Dr. Joseph Duffy, a consultant in rheumatology at the Mayo Clinic in 
Rochester, Minn., where about a dozen patients with the syndrome have been 
treated. 
</P>
<P>
All the patients, however, appear to share common features -- high eosinophil 
counts and marked muscle inflammation caused by an invasion of muscle tissue by 
eosinophils. Other causes of high eosinophil counts, such as parasite 
infections or tumors, have been excluded. 
</P>
<P>
The sicker patients include those whose nerves, skin, or heart muscle have been 
afflicted, Duffy said. One Mayo Clinic patient with severe impairment of her 
breathing muscles has been on a respirator for more than 10 days. A patient who 
died in New York had such severe nerve and muscle damage that she became a 
quadriplegic, and eventually her heart stopped beating. 
</P>
<P>
The severe cases of the illness resemble "toxic-oil syndrome," a disease that 
was epidemic in Spain in 1981. Toxic-oil syndrome was caused by a denatured 
cooking oil that was sold for food use, although it was intended for industrial 
use. Nearly 20,000 cases and 315 deaths were reported over a one-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Some patients seem to improve when they discontinue tryptophan and are 
prescribed high doses of steroids, which are powerful anti-inflammatory 
medications. But Duffy cautioned that many of the sickest patients have not had 
a "dramatic response" to steroid therapy and those that improve may relapse if 
the dose is reduced. The long-term prognosis of the syndrome and its biological 
mechanism are not known. 
</P>
<P>
This illness can "potentially be fatal in extreme cases," said Hertzman of Los 
Alamos. "Hopefully, if you catch it early it can be reversed." 
</P>
<P>
While the three northern New Mexico women may not have been the first to become 
ill, in the lexicon of disease investigators, they are the "index" cases that 
allowed other cases of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome to be quickly identified. 
</P>
<P>
The first case involved a woman who always had been healthy and athletic until 
she developed the debilitating muscle ailment. 
</P>
<P>
After she was hospitalized in Santa Fe in early October, her condition 
deteriorated and her abdomen and lungs filled with fluid. Her doctors thought 
she might have some rare southwestern fungus, an exotic parasite, Lyme disease 
or perhaps leukemia, she recalled in an interview last week. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 25, the woman's physician went on vacation and turned her care over to 
Blevins, the Taos oncologist. Just the day before, he had been thinking about 
tryptophan because a physician had recommended it to his wife for premenstrual 
syndrome and he had read the pamphlet that she brought home. 
</P>
<P>
When Blevins reviewed the perplexing case, "he immediately hit on it" and 
"decided it was an interesting thing to pursue," the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
Blevins said: "I spent a lot of time with her. Every test had turned out 
negative, she had even had surgery and there was no explanation. So it was one 
clue that maybe drugs (were involved). . . . I kind of suspected it but I 
didn't know, I didn't have another case." 
</P>
<P>
But Blevins was concerned enough that he called his wife and said "don't take 
the L-tryptophan. There is a case at the hospital which has this bizarre 
allergic phenomenon and I presume it is the drug." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Hertzman referred his patient to Dr. James W. Mayer, a Santa Fe 
rheumatologist. Over the course of a month, the housewife had developed 
incapacitating muscle aches, mouth ulcers and severe fatigue and was "feeling 
worse and worse," Hertzman recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer, it turned out, was also consulting on Blevins' patient. Immediately, he 
noticed "the possibility of similarities." Mayer telephoned both Blevins and 
Hertzman, telling them that "we have another patient who is also on 
L-tryptophan, maybe something is going on." 
</P>
<P>
Hertzman immediately telephoned Blevins, a medical school classmate whom he had 
not talked to in six years. Soon the three physicians were reviewing the 
situation with the Mayo Clinic's Gleich, whose advice had been sought earlier 
in October by the physician Blevins was covering for. 
</P>
<P>
The third case was identified when Blevins received a call on Oct. 30 from the 
Women's Health Clinic in Santa Fe about a restaurant hostess with severe muscle 
pains and high numbers of eosinophils. 
</P>
<P>
"I said is this patient on L-tryptophan?" Blevins recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The answer was "Yes, she is. I immediately called Gleich." 
</P>
<P>
Gleich knew that very few eosinophilia cases would remain unexplained after the 
detailed evaluation that the first two patients had received. He "was already 
getting excited when he heard that there were two cases within 30 miles before 
anybody ever said a word about L-tryptophan," Hertzman said. "And then there 
was a third case within three days and he was off the wall. He was calling five 
times a day." 
</P>
<P>
Still another case was identified the next day when Blevins was discussing 
eosinophilia over coffee in the doctor's lounge at the hospital. "(An 
infectious disease specialist) overheard me and said, 'I've got a case,' " 
Blevins said. "It was this networking, this collaboration." 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 3, New Mexico health officials sent a computer message to other states 
alerting them to look for cases. On Nov. 7, the Albuquerque Journal ran a 
front-page story on the illness cluster. 
</P>
<P>
Case reports soon began to flow in from across the state and across the 
country. Judy Kody Paulsen, an athletic 38-year-old Albuquerque woman with a 
similar problem, was on her way to the Mayo Clinic to see Duffy. After reading 
the paper, she packed her tryptophan tablets and called Duffy and Gleich from 
the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Within days, it became clear that what appeared at first to be a northern New 
Mexico curiosity was in fact a national public health emergency. "We were 
beginning to collect patients daily," Duffy said. It was "astonishing when they 
kept saying, yes, yes, yes (when asked about tryptophan use). We never expected 
that. It just had to be a cause/effect relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers do not know how to explain isolated but apparently similar cases 
that have cropped up in previous years. One example is a 1986 case involving a 
woman taking "numerous self-prescribed vitamin and mineral supplements" that 
Duffy and two colleagues described in a January, 1988, article in the Mayo 
Clinic Proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the Mayo Clinic physicians had no specific reason to ask the woman 
specifically about tryptophan use. But when Duffy telephoned her earlier this 
month, he found out that she had been "on it for years" and was continuing to 
"do poorly." Asked if he thought tryptophan products were to blame for the 
patient's years of illness, Duffy said, "I would believe so." 
</P>
<P>
The three "index" New Mexico patients are all much improved. The patient who 
was hospitalized stopped taking tryptophan supplements before entering the 
hospital and her doctors started her on steroid therapy before they suspected 
the association with the amino acid product. 
</P>
<P>
The fluid in her abdomen and lungs has disappeared and she is "getting stronger 
every day." But she is apprehensive about the future. Physicians "don't know 
whether this will turn itself off or whether I will relapse," she said. "We 
really don't know what will happen next." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHAT ARE EOSINOPHILS? Eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, are part of the 
body's immune system. The cells are so named because of their marked affinity 
for the rose-colored stain called "eosin," making them appear pink under the 
microscope. 
</P>
<P>
Eosinophils play an important role in defense against infection, because they 
can kill many types of microscopic parasites and worms. On the other hand, in a 
variety of illnesses, including asthma, some skin ailments and some heart 
diseases, the cells release toxic proteins that may damage tissues. 
</P>
<P>
"The eosinophil is a kamikaze cell," said Dr. Gerald J. Gleich of the Mayo 
Clinic. "When it goes into tissue, it loses its (cellular) identity and blows 
up," dispersing the highly toxic proteins. 
</P>
<P>
This appears to be how disease is caused in the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. 
But researchers don't understand why the body makes more eosinophils, and why 
they in turn attack the muscles and other tissues. 
</P>
<P>
Eosinophilia is the medical name for conditions characterized by an elevated 
number of eosinophils in the blood stream. The list of such conditions is very 
long. It includes allergies, asthma, parasitic diseases, other infections, 
rheumatologic diseases, and tumors. 
</P>
<P>
Normal eosinophil counts range from 50 to 350 cells per cubic millimeter, or 
just a few percent of all white blood cells in the circulation. By comparison, 
some of the patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome have had counts of 
10,000 cells per cubic millimeter or more, or more than 50% of all white blood 
cells in their circulation.

CZECH REBELS: FROM A TRICKLE TO A TORRENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years there was only darkness. 
</P>
<P>
The brief dawn of reform that came with Alexander Dubcek in the 1968 "Prague 
Spring" was crushed so completely by the repressive regime installed in its 
aftermath that for seven years, no opposition existed. 
</P>
<P>
A regime filled with incompetents and characterized by crudeness managed to 
purge its opponents with undisputed efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of that efficiency, coupled with the trauma of the Soviet invasion, 
explains why Czechoslovakia is nearly the last of the Warsaw Pact nations to 
rise up against its hard-line Communist rulers. 
</P>
<P>
Only in 1975, when Czechoslovakia, along with the other nations of Europe, 
signed the Helsinki Accords -- the document guaranteeing basic human rights -- 
did a flicker of hope burn that, today, 14 years later, has ignited a protest 
that has swept the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave Czechs something to hang on to," said one analyst familiar with the 
opposition. "They felt it. It was a handle." 
</P>
<P>
It was enough of a handle that in January, 1977, about 1,000 Czechoslovaks -- 
mainly intellectuals, writers and actors -- put their names to a short document 
demanding basic human and civic rights that became known as Charter 77. 
</P>
<P>
Its birth was calamitous. 
</P>
<P>
Driving through Prague's main Wenceslas Square on a snowy January night, 
playwright Pavel Landovsky, one of the charter's signers, was stopped by police 
as he guided his battered Saab automobile toward the city's main post office. 
</P>
<P>
On the back seat were nearly 1,000 envelopes, each containing a copy of the 
charter and the names of those who signed it. 
</P>
<P>
The crackdown was immediate and severe. 
</P>
<P>
A second opposition group called VONS -- the Committee to Defend the Unjustly 
Persecuted -- was formed in early 1979 as an arm of Charter 77, but both 
remained small, with no more than a few hundred activists. 
</P>
<P>
Those who dared to defy the system paid the price. 
</P>
<P>
Dissidents were harassed, jailed and constantly followed by Czechoslovak secret 
police. 
</P>
<P>
But the regime went beyond the dissidents themselves and hit at their families 
and those Communists who had supported Dubcek when he spearheaded the brief 
period of reform in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
The first hint of new hope for opponents of the regime came only in January of 
this year, when leading individuals protested the repressive use of police and 
the lack of free expression. 
</P>
<P>
The protest came long after the impact of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
policies of political and economic reform and openness had set in motion major 
changes in neighboring Poland and Hungary. But it was a beginning. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as two weeks ago, dissident sociologist Jan Urban sat in his small 
Prague apartment, talking of the new pluralism in Hungary and Poland and the 
collapse of hard-line regimes in neighboring East Germany and Bulgaria. He knew 
the time for freedom had come. 
</P>
<P>
His only worry was whether the Czechoslovaks, already robbed once, were ready 
to try again. 
</P>
<P>
"No one knows what is going to happen," another dissident sociologist, Martin 
Palous, said prophetically a few hours before the now-famous Nov. 17 student 
demonstration. "We're entering a new period of history, and no one knows what 
is going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
The potent mixture of students demanding change and the truncheons of the 
regime's riot police ignited a process that within the space of a few days 
turned the tiny opposition into a mass protest movement that has extended deep 
into the Communist Party and even into elements of the government itself. 
</P>
<P>
The critical breakthrough for the opposition came when dissident playwright 
Vaclav Havel telephoned Jan Skoda, general secretary of the small Socialist 
Party, and asked for help. 
</P>
<P>
Havel had already had secret contacts with Skoda, whose party is a member of 
the Communist-dominated National Front that rules Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Skoda, who understood the direction of events, agreed to join a meeting of 
regime opponents two days later that would give birth to the loose coalition of 
opposition interests dubbed the Civic Forum. 
</P>
<P>
His presence provided an entirely new and vitally important dimension to the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
In a single stroke, a legal political party, long linked with the regime 
itself, had jumped ship and allied itself with the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"Dissidents no longer exist in secret ghettos," declared Havel. "We're now in a 
time where there are the beginnings of a real opposition in our country." 
</P>
<P>
From its inception, the Civic Forum has shown a sophistication and deftness 
unseen in Czechoslovak politics in more than four decades. 
</P>
<P>
Its leading public personalities may have had such careers as playwright and 
sociologist, but they settled into the Czechoslovak political arena as if they 
had been born to it. 
</P>
<P>
The group's best-known figure, Havel, has consistently risen to the occasion. 
He has delivered a collection of pithy, cogent responses at press conferences 
and soaring speeches to massive crowds of protesters. 
</P>
<P>
Sociologist Vaclav Mali, the group's official spokesman, quickly established a 
good rapport with the huge press contingent. 
</P>
<P>
The Civic Forum's public-relations sophistication is in complete contrast to 
that of the country's Communist leadership. 
</P>
<P>
When asked why no member of the Communist hierarchy had tried to address the 
large crowds, one diplomat responded, "They have no one who knows how to read a 
speech in an atmosphere like this." 
</P>
<P>
In the wave of outrage and protest against the Nov. 17 beatings of 
demonstrating students, the long-isolated intellectual dissidents found a 
larger, stronger partner in Czechoslovakia's young people. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few days, 80,000 students were on strike. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Nov. 17) demonstration lit the fuse, but what is happening now is a 
reaction to years of lies and deception," Havel said. "It was the crisis that 
brought everyone out." 
</P>
<P>
Student groups also played a vital role in making contact with workers. Unlike 
their counterparts in Poland, Czechoslovak workers have been traditionally 
reluctant to take up political protest. 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday, grass-roots Communist Party organizations in the capital had voted 
to join the strike and Communists were attending Civic Forum's daily rallies. 
</P>
<P>
In a development that opponents could hardly have imagined only days before, 
elements of the government itself were pitching in. 
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education announced it supported the strike, while the 
government post office and Czechoslovak television helped transmit Civic Forum 
rallies to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"We are no longer the opposition," said Civic Forum spokesman Michel Horacek. 
"They are the opposition." 
</P>
<P>
One week after Civic Forum's birth, it had won a nearly clean sweep in 
achieving its demands. 
</P>
<P>
Those directly connected with the 1968 Soviet-led invasion, including the 
party's leader, Milos Jakes, had resigned from the ruling Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
A commission had been established to investigate the Nov. 17 police actions, 
and political prisoners were being freed. 
</P>
<P>
And to the cheers of the estimated half a million Czechoslovaks at a mass 
rally, Havel was able to announce, "Dialogue with the government has begun." 
</P>
<P>
Summed up sociologist Urban: "I thought such things only happened in dreams."

HUGE LOSS LOOMS IN INDIA FOR GANDHI'S RULING PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

NEW DELHI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi appeared headed for political disaster today as 
official results from one of India's bloodiest elections indicated that his 
ruling party would lose its majority for only the second time in history. 
</P>
<P>
Using final totals from almost half of the nation's districts and substantial 
totals from the rest, statistical analysts on state-run television predicted 
that Gandhi's Congress-I party, which has governed the nation for all but 30 
months since Indian independence in 1947, will lose more than half the seats it 
has held in the nation's 543-member Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
About 130 people were killed during the three-stage election, with voting on 
Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, as of midday today, winners have been declared for 222 of the 524 
seats up for election, with Congress-I having won just 80. Analysts on 
government television predicted that the ruling party would win a total of 200 
seats, compared to the 415 it won during the last general election five years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Even after all votes are tallied, no clear winner is likely to emerge from the 
polls, the analysts said, basing their projections on what they called 
"irreversible trends" in most of the races. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition National Front alliance led by former Gandhi aide Vishwanath 
Pratap Singh was leading for just 91 seats, having been declared official 
winners in 51 contests. 
</P>
<P>
The television analysts said that the most startling result was the emergence 
of a third force in Indian politics, the right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya 
Janata Party, which was ahead in 75 races after having won only two seats five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The most likely outcome of what several independent analysts already are 
calling a landmark election will be a "hung" Parliament, in which Congress-I 
may be the largest single victor but will not be able to govern without forming 
coalitions. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be a very close finish," said Prannoy Roy, a prominent Indian 
statistical analyst. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the first time in Indian history that a coalition would attempt to 
rule, and analysts said it would herald a new era of uncertainty and 
instability on India's traditionally dynastic political landscape. 
</P>
<P>
"In any case, Rajiv Gandhi's leadership of the party is going to be challenged 
-- that is without doubt," said independent political analyst Bharat 
Wariavwalla. "It is clear he is now a liability to his party. And the whole 
defeat can be neatly blamed on him." 
</P>
<P>
Privately, several senior ruling party members agreed. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old Gandhi, who inherited the mantle of leadership from his mother, 
Indira Gandhi, after her assassination in 1984, made himself the centerpiece of 
the ruling party's monthlong campaign, barnstorming the nation by jet, 
helicopter and limousine and addressing scores of rallies. 
</P>
<P>
The election also was billed as a report card on Gandhi's five years in power, 
during which the young leader had vowed to usher in a new era of science and 
prosperity in long-impoverished India. Most analysts concluded that the 
dramatic swing against Congress-I is largely due to Gandhi's failure to meet 
the nation's heightened expectations, as well as persistent charges of 
corruption that reached as high as Gandhi's own office. 
</P>
<P>
Gandhi had pledged to rid government of such corruption, and charges that he 
personally may have profited from kickbacks on an Indian arms deal with the 
Swedish firm Bofors in 1987 was a major plank in the opposition's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Rajiv certainly will be in trouble if we fail to get a majority, and we will 
most likely go for his head if we win less than 200 seats," said one senior 
ruling party leader as early trends emerged. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the fate of Gandhi's own seat in Parliament remained uncertain today. 
After documenting widespread abuses, including armed intimidation and vote 
fraud by the ruling party in his Amethi constituency, the federal election 
commission ordered new polling today in 97 of the district's 930 polling 
stations. Counting also will begin there today. 
</P>
<P>
The Amethi race had been billed as "Gandhi vs. Gandhi -- the battle of the 
grandsons," with Rajiv Gandhi, grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first 
prime minister, running against Rajmohan Gandhi, the grandson of Mohandas K. 
Gandhi, the father of Indian independence. 
</P>
<P>
But polling in Amethi was so tainted by violence and fraud that human rights 
organizations and intellectuals condemned the race there as symbolic of the 
bloodshed and rigging that took place in many areas nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has denied that his party workers committed abuses in 
Amethi. But, at a press conference Sunday, his opponent, Rajmohan Gandhi, said, 
"The whole election was a fraud from A to Z on their side." 
</P>
<P>
Rajmohan Gandhi then called for the prime minister's resignation and declared 
that he will not accept the official results of the Amethi poll, win or lose. 
</P>
<P>
Although the prime minister is expected to retain his seat when the final count 
is in, many of his key party colleagues were faring poorly elsewhere in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
Gandhi's trusted interior minister, Buta Singh, lost badly, as did several 
other powerful Cabinet ministers. His Speaker of the house, Balram Jakhar, lost 
in the north Indian state of Rajasthan, a traditional Congress-I stronghold 
where the party is not expected to win any seats. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a large majority of Gandhi's candidates were heading for defeat 
throughout the north Indian "cow belt," which has been the ruling party's main 
vote bank for four decades. And some of the prime minister's most bitter foes 
were taking their places. 
</P>
<P>
Gandhi's estranged sister-in-law, Maneka Gandhi, who attracted international 
attention in 1982 when then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi expelled her from the 
family home, was leading by a large margin in a remote district of India's most 
populous state of Uttar Pradesh, where Gandhi's cousin, Arun Nehru, who split 
from the ruling party in 1987, also was expected to win handily. 
</P>
<P>
The only bright spot for the ruling party today was in the four southern states 
that have been under opposition control for the past several years. There, 
Congress-I surprised all analysts by sweeping Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and 
Andhra Pradesh, where the regional opposition party of film idol N.T. Rama Rao 
was dealt a humiliating defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a major vote for change -- not only at the center, but a vote for change 
everywhere," said pollster and analyst Roy, who was anchoring state-run 
television's election coverage. "All over, they're voting against the party in 
power. The electorate has become more critical." 
</P>
<P>
For analyst Wariavwalla, the result is not simply an indication of negative 
voting. "It shows that the Indian electorate is a very intelligent and 
discriminating electorate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And analyst Pran Chopra, of New Delhi's Center for Policy Research, added: "It 
shows that gimmicks are not enough. There has to be a system, and there has to 
be a program. And the people clearly have created a situation in which a 
coalition becomes necessary." 
</P>
<P>
The formation of such a coalition, though, is likely to take days or even 
weeks, the analysts concluded. 
</P>
<P>
"What's going to become critical in this election are the smaller parties," 
said Roy. "And who will become the next prime minister . . . will take some 
time to decide." 
</P>
<P>
Given its large new voting bloc, for example, the Hindu national Bharatiya 
Janata Party has flatly refused to form a coalition with Gandhi's party. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not support any government which includes the Congress-I," declared L. 
K. Advani, the party's president, after winning his New Delhi seat by an 
overwhelming margin Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We are entering into an exciting period," Wariavwalla said. "But the most 
important thing to see is that for the first time in 42 years, the dominance of 
one party and the dominance of one family has been broken." 
</P>

CRISTIANI'S MOVE MAY BE FATAL TO LATIN PEACE

<TEXT>
<P>
El Salvador's decision to suspend relations with Nicaragua has dealt a 
crippling and perhaps fatal blow to a Central American peace process that, just 
a month ago, seemed moving toward a settlement of guerrilla wars in both 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Since August, 1987, four landmark agreements among the region's presidents have 
diverted much of the U.S.-backed Contra war against Nicaragua's Sandinista 
rulers into a broadly contested political campaign that is to culminate in 
national elections next Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
The latest regional accord -- among Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, 
Honduras and Nicaragua -- also led to two rounds of peace talks, in September 
and October, between El Salvador's new rightist government and the Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, both wars have escalated. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, 
accusing the Bush Administration of ordering stepped-up Contra raids to disrupt 
the elections, ended a 19-month cease-fire Nov. 1. In turn, El Salvador's 
U.S.-backed government has charged Ortega with arming the FMLN for a major 
guerrilla offensive that began here Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
President Alfredo Cristiani's announcement Sunday of a diplomatic break with 
Managua marks the most serious conflict between any of the five nations that 
have worked so closely to find a common formula for settling internal guerrilla 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, the level of war and the level of political tension in the region is 
greater than at any other moment of this process," Francisco Rojas Aravena, a 
Costa Rican political analyst, said Sunday. "It will be very difficult to 
reactivate any kind of peace initiative for many months." 
</P>
<P>
Among the likely casualties of the renewed conflict is the scheduled fifth 
Central American summit, which had been set to take place in Nicaragua early 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani said he would not go to Nicaragua but would ask instead that the 
leaders of the three other countries meet him elsewhere and condemn Ortega. 
Costa Rican officials immediately rejected that idea, apparently scuttling 
hopes for any meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think isolating Nicaragua helps any peaceful purpose," said John 
Biehl, an adviser to Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez. "If Cristiani 
has proof of Nicaraguan involvement, he should present it to the others. If 
what happened is real, it's very serious, and Ortega will have a lot of 
explaining to do." 
</P>
<P>
Arias won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for drafting the plan on which the 
original accord was based. Among its principles is that no country is to aid 
insurgents trying to overthrow the government of another and that rebels will 
lay down their arms in return for amnesty and a fair chance to compete in 
democratic elections. 
</P>
<P>
Though poles apart in ideology, Ortega and Cristiani share a stake in the peace 
process because it favors established governments. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega, while resuming the military offensive against the Contras, has held 
nine rounds of talks with their leaders this month trying to find terms for the 
rebel army's disbandment. The talks reached an impasse last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Ortega was looking forward to the December meeting to demand 
compliance with the previous summit accord to shut down Contra camps in 
Honduras by Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Some diplomats in the region believe Nicaragua has indeed shipped arms to the 
FMLN, in part as a bargaining chip to force some action to disband the Contras. 
If that is the case, Cristiani could have gained by confronting Ortega at the 
summit. 
</P>
<P>
"Cristiani needs these forums to help him delegitimize the FMLN," said a 
Guatemalan political analyst. "The fact that he is giving up that option shows 
how weak he is against the hard-liners in his own military." 
</P>
<P>
The United States has built up the Salvadoran and Honduran armed forces to halt 
what it calls the threat of subversion by the Sandinistas, who took power in 
their own guerrilla uprising in 1979 and maintain close ties with the FMLN. The 
Reagan Administration used Costa Rican and Salvadoran territory, as well as 
Honduras, as staging areas for Contra operations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the resulting regional friction -- including Nicaraguan and Honduran 
military raids into each other's territory -- the five countries managed to 
maintain diplomatic ties with each other -- until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Cristiani's decision, Costa Rican officials had expressed doubt 
that a December meeting could be held. Arias was angered when Ortega spoiled 
his Pan American summit in Costa Rica last month by announcing the end of the 
Nicaraguan cease-fire. And he felt betrayed by both the government and 
guerrillas in El Salvador for escalating their fighting just three weeks after 
holding peace talks under his auspices. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole peace plan is on the threshold of being blown to pieces," Guillermo 
Solis, a Costa Rican Foreign Ministry official, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Central American officials now believe that a summit must wait at least until 
after new governments being elected in Honduras, Costa Rica and Nicaragua take 
office between January and May. By that time, Arias -- the driving force behind 
the peace process -- will be gone.

LEGAL SHOWDOWN LIKELY FOR PROP. 13; 
</P>
<P>
THE LAW: A SUIT CHALLENGING THE PROPERTY-TAX CUTTING MEASURE COULD REACH THE 
U.S. SUPREME COURT. ATTORNEYS BELIEVE THE JUSTICES MIGHT OVERTURN THE 1978 
INITIATIVE.

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Little noticed by anyone but lawyers and tax experts, a San Diego lawsuit 
challenging Proposition 13 has taken its first step up the appeals ladder, 
setting the stage for what is widely regarded as the most formidable attack 
since 1978 on California's landmark tax-cutting law. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks to have a key provision of Proposition 13 declared 
unconstitutional and wiped out, contending the law violates guarantees of equal 
treatment by taxing new property owners at a higher rate than longtime owners. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys familiar with the suit say that the case very likely is headed for 
the U.S. Supreme Court, which they believe has signaled that it may be ready to 
overturn Proposition 13 -- and is waiting only for the opportunity to do it. 
Even some of staunchest defenders of Proposition 13 say they are concerned that 
this challenge may eventually succeed. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers' arguments in favor of and against this new challenge to 
Proposition 13 often descend into the complex technicalities of tax and 
constitutional law. But the central issue the San Diego suit poses is simple: 
</P>
<P>
Is it constitutionally fair for taxpayers who own properties of nearly 
identical type and value in the same tax district to be taxed in dramatically 
different amounts, based solely on when they bought the property? 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego challenge to Proposition 13, as well as two other pending 
challenges, can be traced to a U.S. Supreme Court decision in January. In that 
case, the court held that a similar West Virginia tax scheme was 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Relying on that ruling, a lawyer for a Nevada firm, Northwest Financial Co., a 
holding company that invested in residential property in La Jolla in 1987, 
brought suit in San Diego in April. In the suit, Northwest Financial Co. 
contended that, because it was a new owner, it unfairly had to pay thousands of 
dollars more in taxes than longtime owners of similar property. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Herbert B. Hoffman dismissed the suit in July, 
saying a 1978 California Supreme Court decision upholding Proposition 13 
obliged him to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Northwest Financial's lawyer, Robert K. Smith of La Jolla, 
filed a notice of appeal to the 4th District Court of Appeal in San Diego, 
citing the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in January and contending that the 
California Supreme Court's 1978 ruling was out of date. 
</P>
<P>
Written arguments from Smith and from lawyers for the two defendants in the 
suit, San Diego County and the State Board of Equalization, will be filed 
before the state Court of Appeal in January or February. A three-judge panel 
may schedule oral argument or simply decide the case on the legal papers, Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Two other suits have been filed since the San Diego case. One was filed in 
September in Los Angeles on behalf of lawyer Stephanie Nordlinger, who last 
year bought a house in Baldwin Hills and then discovered that her tax bill was 
five times higher than that of a neighbor, said attorney Mary Louise Cohen, who 
filed the suit. That case is pending in Los Angeles Superior Court, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
The other suit was brought Nov. 6 in Contra Costa County Superior Court, said 
Los Angeles tax lawyer Charles Ajalat, who filed that suit on behalf of R. H. 
Macy &amp; Co., the department store chain, challenging an assessment made when 
the store took over space at a local mall. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego suit, however, was the first in the courthouse doors, and is the 
first to reach the appellate level. Because the state Court of Appeal may be 
obliged to follow the California Supreme Court decision, Smith said he does not 
expect to win. 
</P>
<P>
But he plans further appeals, to the California and U.S. Supreme courts, and 
said: "We're confident." 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of Proposition 13 say they will remind judges that the disparity 
issue already has been considered -- by California voters. 
</P>
<P>
"The ballot arguments in support of and in opposition to Proposition 13 talked 
about this side-by-side disparity issue," said attorney Jonathan Coupal of the 
Pacific Legal Foundation in Sacramento, which helps defend the law on behalf of 
two taxpayer groups. 
</P>
<P>
"The people were aware of (the disparity issue) and said, 'So what?' We want 
tax relief, and we don't want our tax system to be based on increases in the 
real estate market. That is, I think, a tremendously valid policy, but even if 
you don't agree with the policy, I think it's exceptionally difficult to say 
that there's no rational basis for it." 
</P>
<P>
But Joel Fox of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. in Los Angeles conceded that 
backers of Proposition 13 are "definitely concerned." 
</P>
<P>
"We are considering very strongly going ahead and giving grants to academic 
types and having them take a look at the problem, (so) if a court should go 
ahead and overturn Proposition 13, we'll be able to say, 'Here are reasonable 
solutions that will protect the taxpayers of California and members of our 
organization and exist peacefully with the (constitution),' " Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sparked by the lawsuits, the Assembly's Revenue and Taxation 
Committee, chaired by Assemblyman Johan Klehs (D-San Leandro), has scheduled a 
public hearing Dec. 5 to "lay out the issues, the concerns and whether changes 
to Proposition 13 are appropriate," said Jay Greenwood, Klehs' spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
California voters approved Proposition 13 in 1978. It set the property rate at 
1% of assessed valuation and rolled back property tax assessments for existing 
homeowners to their 1975 levels. Unless a property is sold, those assessments 
may rise no more than 2% per year for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
When property changes hands, however, the new buyer pays taxes based on its 
purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
This two-tiered system can create huge differences in the taxes based solely on 
when the property was bought, particularly since home prices in most areas of 
California have soared since the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles suit includes a survey documenting disparities around the city, 
ranging from 4 to 1 in Watts, to 15 to 1 in Venice. In 1999, the disparity in 
one Venice neighborhood will be about 100 to 1, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest Financial's suit claims that such unequal treatment violates the 
equal protection guarantees of the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity in the San Diego suit is about 5 to 1. Northwest Financial bought 
the La Jolla property on Nov. 30, 1987 for $730,000, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
The property, a sprawling single-story house in the fashionable La Jolla Farms 
section of the wealthy San Diego neighborhood, had been assessed at $175,839. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the new assessment at its purchase price, Northwest Financial paid 
an extra $8,897 in taxes over 1988 and 1989; the lawsuit asks for a refund in 
that amount. 
</P>
<P>
Smith conceded it might cost that much, or more, to pursue the case to the U.S. 
Supreme Court. But the decision he and his clients made was that "the law was 
incorrect, that it didn't seem anyone was moving to rectify the situation and 
that this was an opportunity to do something for the public good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Proposition 13 in 
1978, saying in a 6-1 decision that taxation based upon purchase price was 
legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
Because the opinion was issued in September, 1978, only four months after 
voters approved Proposition 13, the majority said they had no actual value 
differences in assessments to consider. Chief Justice Rose Bird dissented on 
that issue, saying Proposition 13 was bound to promote disparities, and that 
treating people differently was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was not appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a policy by Webster County in 
West Virginia that assessed newly acquired properties at a higher level than 
those that had long remained with the same owner. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous opinion written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the court 
agreed that a tax system that based an assessment on a property's purchase 
price was not by itself constitutionally defective. 
</P>
<P>
But the equal protection clause requires adjustments that, over time, obtain "a 
rough equality in tax treatment of similarly situated owners," Rehnquist said. 
</P>
<P>
The Webster County system failed that test because the coal company property in 
the case had been assessed at eight to 35 times more than comparable 
neighboring property, and those discrepancies had continued for more than 10 
years with little change, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a footnote, Rehnquist noted that "we need not and do not decide" whether the 
case covered Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
California lawyers, including John Curtis, a Los Angeles tax lawyer who 
formerly was chief counsel to the West Virginia state tax department, read that 
footnote as an invitation to challenge the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the facts (in the San Diego and West Virginia cases) are so 
similar -- it was an invitation," said Curtis, a former president of Cal-Tax, a 
lobbying group that seeks to limit tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
The footnote had special significance in light of two of the court's recent 
decisions as well as the renewed interest the Rehnquist court has taken in tax 
matters, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
Two other cases that reached the U.S. Supreme Court, like Proposition 13, 
involved programs that made time-based distinctions and favored longtime 
residents over newer ones. One was from Alaska and reached the court in 1982, 
the other, from New Mexico, reached the court in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The high court struck down both, saying they violated equal protection 
guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
And while the Supreme Court historically has been reluctant to take up tax 
cases, a full 10% of the cases the court has agreed to take up so far this term 
are tax matters, court statistics indicate. 
</P>
<P>
"The court may be looking at taxation in a light they haven't in 60 to 80 
years, which is to require greater equality for similarly situated taxpayers," 
Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Proposition 13 have read the same U.S. Supreme Court cases and 
noted the court's interest in tax matters, but contend the California law will 
not be struck down. 
</P>
<P>
There are two key factual distinctions, lawyers say. Proposition 13 is imposed 
throughout California, while the West Virginia assessments were made only in 
Webster County. And Proposition 13's measuring stick is purchase price, while 
the Webster County system used current market value. 
</P>
<P>
They say the key question is whether Proposition 13 has a "rational basis" for 
setting property tax rates. They contend that the answer is yes, and point to 
the California Supreme Court's 1978 decision saying that Proposition 13 
provided property taxpayers with predictability and stability. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and other attorneys challenging the measure said that argument glosses 
over the actual discrepancies that have developed over Proposition 13's 11-year 
life. 
</P>
<P>
What has happened, they said, is exactly what Bird predicted in her dissent 
from the 1978 California decision. Inevitably, Bird said, Proposition 13 would 
create an "irrational tax world" because "people living in homes of identical 
value pay different property taxes." 
</P>
<P>
If a court does gut Proposition 13, it is unclear whether taxes would be rolled 
back to 1975 levels or increased to current values, legal experts said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego suit specifically asks that Northwest Financial get the benefit 
of the rollback to 1975 values. A court could extend the ruling to other 
post-1978 buyers. Yet remaining provisions in the California Constitution 
declare that property is taxed at its current value, said Richard H. Ochsner, 
the assistant chief counsel for the State Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
Because there are a "lot of possibilities," some sort of reform legislation is 
virtually certain, Ochsner said. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis, who said he believes "Proposition 13 has so much good about it," said 
he is "trying to build a consensus" on an alternative among legislators, tax 
groups and others, so "we can have it ready to go when something bad does go 
down." 
</P>
<P>
And "something bad" will happen to Proposition 13, Curtis said. "It's not a 
conclusion I like, but it's one I have to, as a lawyer, logically make," he 
said. "It's not the kind of case where it's clear cut, but in a close decision, 
I think the weight would fall on the side of overturning 13." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Steele, a San Francisco tax attorney, said he already is warning clients to 
expect changes to Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be a fool not to," he said. "I've been telling them . . . that there was a 
time bomb ticking here that you had to watch."

A 12-year-old boy was found dead atop a Harlem apartment building's elevator 
car, where officials believe he had been playing. The body of Walter McMillan 
was found Saturday evening when the car was at the 27th floor, a Housing 
Authority police spokesman said. The cause of death was not released 
immediately.

<P>
It was Saturday night in Sin City, but you couldn't tell it from the crowd at 
the Nite Life Lounge. 
</P>
<P>
The place was empty, except for two women in bikinis who sat chatting with the 
barmaid, a heavy-set woman in hot pants. She was so bored that she'd gone to 
look out the door a few minutes earlier to see where everybody was. 
</P>
<P>
Times have changed. Newport used to be called the Sin City of the South. 
Gambling halls and brothels flourished on Monmouth Street, the main strip. Some 
of the biggest entertainers of the 1940s and 1950s, people like Pearl Bailey 
and Martha Raye, performed there. And folks are still around who'll tell you 
they know for a fact that Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin played blackjack at 
local tables. The joints were packed in those days. 
</P>
<P>
All the barmaid saw that night, though, was a lone man shambling down the 
street in a heavy coat. His dark eyes caught her casting about for signs of 
life. Embarrassed, she burst into giggles and ducked back inside. 
</P>
<P>
The man poked his head in the door after a while and she had a giggling fit 
again. "Come on in," she beckoned. But he turned away. The air inside was heavy 
with the scent of sadness and cheap perfume. He closed the door and moved on 
down the street. 
</P>
<P>
Times have been hard for bar owners here since 1982, when a newly elected city 
commission banned nude dancing and then began strict enforcement of liquor and 
vice laws. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Newport and Covington, Newport's adjacent sister in sin, have 
since made an all-out effort to build their first substantial legal economies. 
Among the development projects the depressed Ohio River communities have 
attracted are a $120-million hotel-office complex being discussed for the 
Newport waterfront, an $80-million hotel-office complex under construction in 
Covington and a number of high-priced condominium developments. 
</P>
<P>
"Our real estate property tax has gone down 11% over the last five years 
because of all the new development," said Laura L. Long, Newport's economic 
development director. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, both cities say a rising number of professional people are moving 
there and repairing old homes. On weekdays, groups of people in business suits 
may be seen commuting to work by foot across the bridges that connect 
Cincinnati's downtown to the two Kentucky cities. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the changes, remnants of the old order are slowly fading. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here for 25 years," said Nick Acabucci, the owner of the Talk of the 
Town, one of about a dozen go-go bars remaining. "I was here when all the town 
was wide open. It was like Las Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
But now business is so bad, he said: "I had to cut my place in half. I closed 
the back room. . . . I ain't been full in eight years." 
</P>
<P>
One recent night, the bar up front was packed with drinkers watching a woman in 
eyeglasses, pasties and a G-string gyrating on stage. A larger back room, 
though, was empty. 
</P>
<P>
Vice once was northern Kentucky's biggest industry. In the 1950s, gambling was 
estimated to be an annual $10-million business, supplying between 2,500 and 
5,000 jobs and bringing a steady stream of tourists into the two towns, which 
today have a combined population of 70,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Gambling was so wide open . . . that the casual visitor would get the 
impression it was legal in Kentucky," the Kefauver Commission said in a report 
issued in the 1950s, after conducting a 16-month investigation of organized 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
The inventor of the Tommy gun was born in Newport. And for 40 years, starting 
with Prohibition, the sort of gangsters who made John T. Thompson's invention a 
household word held this town in their grip. Old-timers still talk of mob hits 
they witnessed in the 1940s, and the area's reputation for public corruption 
continued unabated until the start of this decade. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, former Cleveland Browns quarterback George Ratterman ran for sheriff 
on a reform platform. His campaign was nearly derailed when he was arrested on 
vice charges. Five people, including the Newport police chief, were later 
charged with drugging him and propping him up in bed in a hotel room with a 
stripper known as April Flowers. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1960s, the gambling halls and brothels all had been closed. They 
were replaced by a multitude of nudie bars. 
</P>
<P>
Despite efforts to stamp out prostitution -- the newspaper this year started 
publishing the photographs of men convicted of soliciting -- the sex trade 
still flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
In Newport's Kit Kat Club one recent night, two barely clad women sandwiched a 
man in a booth to explain what his money could buy. For a $60 drink, they said, 
he could move with one of them to a darkened corner of the room. "I'll be 
straight with you . . . we can't have sex in here," said one woman, who said 
her name was Jerra. 
</P>
<P>
But with insinuating words and a deft touch of her hand she suggested that 
there were other things they could do. Later, the other woman, beseeching him 
to call her at home, assured him: "Don't worry, we're clean. We don't have 
diseases or anything." 
</P>
<P>
Some bar owners contend that the cities should exploit their reputations for 
sin rather than fight them. They should turn Monmouth Street into a Kentucky 
version of New Orleans' Bourbon Street, they say. No one believes it will 
happen. "They're trying to run us out of business," groused Acabucci. 
</P>
<P>
City officials won't say that outright, but they make no secret of their 
distaste for the area's sordid image, which they say makes it hard to attract 
new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of my friends who live in other cities say to me 'where will we go to 
have fun now?' " said Jim Parsons, Newport's city manager. "They don't want it 
in their communities, but they don't mind it being someplace else. . . . I 
don't think these are the things we need in this city."

E. GERMAN OPPOSITION SEEKS DEC. 7 TALKS;

<P>
EAST BLOC: FREE ELECTIONS WOULD BE THE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION WITH COMMUNIST PARTY 
LEADERS. IT WOULD BE THE FIRST MEETING BETWEEN THE GROUPS AND THE REGIME.

<P>
East German political parties and opposition groups Sunday proposed Dec. 7 as 
the date for an unprecedented round-table discussion on free elections. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Ullmann, a spokesman for the opposition group Democracy Now, announced 
the proposal, saying the meeting would be attended by 31 delegates. 
</P>
<P>
The groups said they have not received a formal reply from the 
Communist-dominated government. The government last week proposed round-table 
talks but gave no start date. 
</P>
<P>
Such talks would mark the first time that the Communist Party has formally met 
with the various opposition organizations. It would also signal unofficial 
recognition of New Forum, the largest of the opposition groups, which now 
claims to have more than 200,000 supporters in the nation of 16.6 million 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the makeup of the meeting would place the Communist Party in a 
minority position among the delegates at the round-table talks. 
</P>
<P>
Ullmann said there would probably be two delegates from each of the four 
smaller parties represented in the People's Chamber (Parliament): the Christian 
Democrats, the Liberal Democrats, the National Democrats and the Farmers' 
Party. The Communist Party would have six delegates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Seven opposition groups would also have two delegates each. The groups are New 
Forum, Democratic Awakening, Democracy Now, the Social Democrats, the 
Initiative for Peace and Human Rights, the United Left and the newly formed 
East German Greens. 
</P>
<P>
Three other places would be reserved for churches -- the Evangelical 
Protestants, the Roman Catholics and the Free Church. 
</P>
<P>
News of the round-table proposal came as the Communist Party pondered the 
consequences of a decision by the Free German Youth (FDJ), the 2-million-strong 
young people's branch of the party, to split from the party. 
</P>
<P>
For 40 years, the Communist Party drew from the ranks of the FDJ, whose members 
were inculcated with the tenets of Marxism-Leninism. 
</P>
<P>
But the FDJ's newly elected leader, Frank Tuerkowsky, who headed the movement 
in Dresden, has said he no longer views the youth group as the "fighting 
reserve" of the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, it must "look after the interests of its members in helping 
youth." In pursuing this goal, he added, the group will be an organization 
"independent of parties." 
</P>
<P>
He said it is "false" to claim that the Communist youth group spoke on behalf 
of all the young people in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Rainer Appelmann, leader of Democratic Awakening, with a claimed 
membership of about 6,000, said the Communist Party must change itself and 
needs an opposition in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"No political power on its own can lead the country out of this crisis," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He also called for a confederation of East and West Germany, with West German 
President Richard von Weizsaecker as its head, since he is "beloved" by East 
Germans. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, reformist Prime Minister Hans Modrow called for a plan 
to cut the operating hours of factories using East German brown coal, which 
spreads noxious sulfur dioxide, as a step toward cleaning up the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the flow of East Germans to West Germany showed a marked slowdown 
during the weekend, partly because of snow and freezing weather.

The Civic Forum, the new opposition coalition, on Sunday announced a 
seven-point program that sets out in broad strokes the group's goals for 
Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
The program, entitled "What Do We Want?" will be submitted for discussion with 
Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The program addresses seven areas: the country's legal system, political 
system, foreign policy, national economy, environment, culture and a subject 
entitled "Social Justice." 
</P>
<P>
A Civic Forum spokesman elaborated on only four of the points: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Legal: Czechoslovakia must become a legal, democratic state. To achieve 
this, a new constitution is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Political system: The principle of permanent change must be accepted 
because the existing crisis cannot be resolved by what was called "altering 
jobs and retiring some people." It is essential that all political and social 
groups have equal rights. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Foreign policy. Czechoslovakia must strive for its honorable place in 
Europe, including "full participation in the process of European integration, 
and it must fully respect existing international obligations and commitments." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Economics. Civic Forum advocates a mixed but open economy, with various 
types of ownership and a free flow of capital and goods.

HUNGARY HOLDS 1ST FREE VOTE SINCE 1945 
</P>

<P>
Incomplete results in the first free national vote here since 1945 narrowly 
favored supporters of Communist Party reformer Imre Pozsgay, who hopes to be 
elected Hungarian president in elections in January. 
</P>
<P>
But freezing temperatures and snow delayed conclusive results in the 
referendum, called by pro-Western political parties in an attempt to block 
Pozsgay by delaying the January elections until multi-party parliamentary 
elections are held next spring. 
</P>
<P>
With only 23% of the vote counted by early this morning, government officials 
said that 52% voted against delaying the election, compared to 48% in favor. 
The officials said the vote results included Budapest, where support for the 
referendum was felt to be strong. 
</P>
<P>
However, referendum sponsors disputed the results, claiming that their count 
showed an opposite trend. "Frankly, we are surprised," referendum campaign 
director Tibor Vidos said. "The data we have is very different, going in the 
opposite direction." 
</P>
<P>
Official final results are not expected until Tuesday. But the early dispute 
over the results will likely add to the controversy surrounding the vote, which 
has turned into an electoral nightmare after originally being billed as the 
first free national ballot in the Soviet Bloc since 1945. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, that 1945 vote also took place in Hungary, as one of the conditions 
of the Yalta agreement between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. In that 
vote, the Liberal-Democratic Small Holders Party won 57% of the vote, compared 
to only 17% for the Communist Party. As a result of the lopsided return against 
the Communist Party, no other free elections have been held in the Soviet Bloc 
until this year. 
</P>
<P>
Although incomplete, the count released by government election officials showed 
that at least enough Hungarian voters went to the polls Sunday to make the 
referendum binding. A major opposition party, the Democratic Forum, had asked 
voters to boycott the referendum. And many here feared that widespread 
confusion over the ballot issues would keep people away. 
</P>
<P>
The National Referendum, sponsored by the pro-Western Alliance of Free 
Democrats, asked voters to decide four issues, including the abolition of a 
notorious voluntary police unit, the Workers' Militia; a proposal to require 
the Communist Party, recently renamed the Hungarian Socialist Party, to reveal 
its financial assets, and another proposal banning Communist organizers from 
the workplace. According to the preliminary results, all of these issues were 
approved handily. 
</P>
<P>
However, vote tallies on the fourth and most controversial issue -- a proposal 
to delay the presidential elections until next spring, after the country's 
first multi-party parliamentary elections in four decades -- appeared much 
closer. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Socialist Party leaders opposed the measure. Instead, they want a 
presidential election to take place as scheduled in January, in hopes that 
longtime Communist Party member Pozsgay, leader of the party's reform wing, 
would be elected before the parliamentary elections. To help their cause, they 
managed to add a confusing "explanation" to the ballot -- opposed by the 
referendum sponsors -- that claimed a "no" vote ensured the "direct" election 
of the President. 
</P>
<P>
Until the vote Sunday, organizers were not even sure that 50% of the 7.8 
million registered voters, the minimum number required to make the election 
valid, would go to the polls. But Hungarian voters overcame a reputation for 
electoral apathy and flocked to the polling places. 
</P>
<P>
"We had reports from the countryside that many people went to the polls 
directly from church," said Vidos, leader of the alliance of four parties that 
sponsored the referendum.

Swiss citizens voted to keep their army as the best way of maintaining their 
nation's neutrality, even though the highly mobilized force has scarcely fired 
a shot in anger during its four centuries of existence. A proposal to abolish 
the army by the year 2000 was rejected by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. Although it 
has only about 1,800 full-time military personnel, Switzerland can mobilize 
625,000 trained soldiers in 48 hours -- more, it says, than West Germany. The 
initiative drive had sparked a fierce debate on the usefulness of the army in a 
small, neutral country.

UNION MEMBERS VOTE TO STRIKE DETROIT NEWSPAPERS OVER WAGES

Newspaper union members voted Sunday to authorize a strike against the Detroit 
News and Detroit Free Press on the eve of the newspapers' scheduled merger of 
non-editorial operations. 
</P>
<P>
Teamsters officials said the strike was set for Thursday to give the employees 
time to get established under the new operations, set to go into effect at 
12:01 a.m. today under a joint operating agreement first proposed in April, 
1986. The merger was upheld earlier this month by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Talks between the Detroit Newspaper Agency, which will run the papers' combined 
operations, and the Newspaper Unity Coalition, representing the six largest 
News and Free Press locals, broke off Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides were far apart on union wage demands, both newspapers reported 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"The members of both papers feel the money package and benefits were an insult 
to them," said Louis Mleczko, president of Local 22 of the Newspaper Guild. 
"The publishers are going to have to share some of the new riches from the 
100-year monopoly they have been granted from the court." 
</P>
<P>
Teamsters Local 372, representing about 1,100 circulation and warehouse 
employees, voted 603 to 76 Sunday night to authorize the strike beginning 12:01 
a.m. Thursday, said Al Derey, secretary-treasurer-elect of the local. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems these corporations that had deep pockets for three years now suddenly 
have holes in their pockets," Derey said. "We asked for Martin Luther King Day 
as a paid holiday and they turned us down flat. It's incredible." 
</P>
<P>
The Newspaper Guild of editorial workers unanimously approved strike 
authorization late Sunday. The guild didn't set a strike deadline and members 
planned to be at work today, Mleczko said. About 250 members attended the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Both the News and Free Press reported that the union coalition was holding to 
its demand for weekly wage increases of $160 per worker over three years. 
</P>
<P>
Management raised its counteroffer from $35.50 to $44 weekly over 2 1/2 years, 
sources told the newspapers. The unions also were offered a contract-signing 
bonus equal to two weeks' pay if the partial merger was implemented on 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Another union, Graphics Communications International Local 13N, voted Sunday to 
accept management's money package offer but honor any other strikes, Mleczko 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The three other unions involved, Teamsters Local 2040, Graphics Communication 
Local 289 and Communications Workers of America Local 18, were also meeting 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Newsroom employees at both papers said they were working toward putting 
together their Monday editions as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Under the joint operating agreement, the newspapers will merge their 
non-editorial operations but maintain separate news and editorial staffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Free Press will continue publishing morning editions Monday through Friday. 
The News will continue publishing morning and afternoon editions but will halt 
home delivery of its morning edition in metropolitan Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
The newspapers will publish combined weekend editions.

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp said Sunday he may ask 
President Bush to test a line-item veto on housing projects opposed by the 
Administration but earmarked for funding by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to do everything I can to make sure that Congress does not earmark 
monies, including asking the President to perhaps test on a line-item veto 
those programs which heretofore have just been shoved down our throat by 
Congress," Kemp said on NBC's "Meet the Press." 
</P>
<P>
The HUD secretary did not say which programs would be involved. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 24, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater confirmed reports that 
the White House was seeking legislation on which Bush could exercise a partial 
veto -- and then allow the courts to decide whether the President acted 
legally. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater told reporters at that time: "We are looking for a vehicle that might 
be a suitable test case, but at this point we don't have one."

Newspaper union members voted to authorize a strike against the Detroit News 
and Detroit Free Press on the eve of the newspapers' scheduled merger of 
non-editorial operations. Teamsters officials said the strike was set for 
Thursday to give the employees time to get established under the new 
operations, set to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. today under a joint operating 
agreement. Talks between the Detroit Newspaper Agency, which will run the 
papers' combined operations, and the Newspaper Unity Coalition, representing 
the six largest News and Free Press locals, have broken off. The two sides were 
far apart on union wage demands.

CRIME BY ALIENS STIRS CONCERN AMONG OFFICIALS

Aliens who commit serious crimes -- including murder, rape and drug trafficking 
-- are a growing problem that is already draining law enforcement resources and 
threatening public safety, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The main problem, say congressional and Administration officials, is a lengthy 
deportation process that enables released convicts to commit new crimes while 
their immigration cases are pending, a failure to control illegal immigration 
or misplaced priorities within the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
The result, says Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, is "that we're talking about a 
massive problem, with potentially hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens who 
have committed crimes." 
</P>
<P>
Smith is ranking Republican on the House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration, 
refugees and international law. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.), the subcommittee chairman, says the country 
is "overwhelmed" with hundreds of thousands of criminal aliens, yet the INS is 
only deporting a fraction of them. 
</P>
<P>
INS spokesman Duke Austin said the agency has increased its deportations of 
criminal aliens -- those convicted or accused of a crime -- yet is bound by the 
law, which gives most criminal aliens the right to a full review of their cases 
in immigration court pending deportation. An alien can prolong a deportation 
for at least a year and sometimes two years. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, Austin said, aliens have been known to commit new crimes and 
end up back in prison. He said there are only 60 immigration judges nationwide 
handling thousands of cases. 
</P>
<P>
Although the system may be abused in some cases, an immigration rights activist 
says it protects everyone's right to due process. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of people who are legally entitled to be in the country, and 
who but for that process might be forcibly evicted," said Charles Kamasaki, a 
vice president of National Council of La Raza.

Jewish historian Salo Wittmayer Baron, who testified at Adolf Eichmann's trial 
and taught at Columbia University for 33 years, has died at his Manhattan home 
of congestive heart failure. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
"He was undoubtedly the greatest Jewish historian of the 20th Century," said 
Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi, a former student of Baron who now holds the Salo 
Wittmayer Baron Chair of Jewish History, Culture and Society at Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Baron, who died Saturday, was a witness for the prosecution at Eichmann's trial 
in Jerusalem in 1961, setting the historic framework for the Israeli 
government's case against the Nazi official, who was subsequently convicted and 
hanged. 
</P>
<P>
Baron's magnum opus was "A Social and Religious History of the Jews," which 
began as a series of lectures, turned into a three-volume Jewish history and 
eventually grew into 18 volumes. 
</P>
<P>
"He was equally at home in everything from ancient history to the modern era, 
and the major father of Jewish historical studies in the United States," said 
Arthur Hertzberg, another former student. 
</P>
<P>
Baron was born in 1895 in Tarnow, which is now in Poland but was then part of 
the Austro-Hungarian Empire. 
</P>
<P>
He eventually learned 20 languages. 
</P>
<P>
Baron was ordained a rabbi at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Vienna, 
Austria, in 1920. He also earned three doctorates from the University of Vienna 
in philosophy, political science and law. 
</P>
<P>
In 1926, Baron was invited to teach at the Jewish Institute of Religion in New 
York. In 1930, he began teaching at Columbia. He retired from Columbia in 1963.

L. BOUDIN, 77; NOTED CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY 
</P>

<P>
Leonard Boudin, a civil liberties attorney whose clients included Julian Bond, 
Paul Robeson, Dr. Benjamin Spock and Daniel Ellsberg, has died. 
</P>
<P>
Boudin, 77, died late Friday night of a heart attack, according to the New York 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
"Leonard was a role model for many lawyers, not just because of his education 
and scholarship but because of his incredible curiosity and interest in matters 
of history and politics that transcend the law," said Leonard Weinglass, a 
lawyer specializing in civil rights cases. 
</P>
<P>
Boudin was born in Brooklyn, attended City College and received a degree from 
St. John's Law School in 1936. He was accepted into legal practice by his 
uncle, Louis Boudin, a well-known constitutional lawyer and an influential 
figure in the Socialist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Boudin's work for his uncle involved union law and in the late 1940s he 
and lawyer Victor Rabinowitz started their own labor law firm. 
</P>
<P>
His best-known victory came in 1958, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Kent 
vs. Dulles that the State Department cannot withhold passports for political 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Boudin's greatest contribution came during the McCarthy era during the 1950s 
when he kept his constitutional bearings and acted as a guardian of important 
public values at a time of general institutional default," said Jamie Kalvin, a 
journalist working on a biography of the lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Boudin represented Robeson in a civil liberties case; Ellsberg, who was charged 
with theft in connection with the Pentagon Papers; Bond, who was denied a seat 
in the Georgia House of Representatives because of his opposition to the 
Vietnam War, and Spock, who was charged with conspiracy to violate the 
Selective Service act. 
</P>
<P>
He represented Cuba's interests in the United States for the last 30 years and 
the Central Bank of Iran during the Iran hostage crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Boudin was the father of Kathy Boudin, 46, a member of the Weather Underground 
who pleaded guilty to a murder charge for her involvement in the 1981 robbery 
of an armored truck in which a guard and two police officers were killed. She 
is serving a 20-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
Boudin was a visiting lecturer at Harvard Law School, Stanford Law School and 
Boalt Hall at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his daughter, Boudin is survived by his wife, a son, a brother 
and four grandchildren.

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher faced growing political trouble Sunday as 
opinion polls put her Conservative Party's popularity at its lowest point in 
nine years. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of those polled said she should quit. 
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, Thatcher, 64, confounded expectations that she would step down 
after the next general election, saying she is prepared to lead her party into 
two more elections "by popular acclaim." 
</P>
<P>
However, an opinion poll in the Sunday Times showed the opposition Labor Party 
with 51% support -- 14 percentage points ahead of the Conservatives. It was 
Labor's biggest lead since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Another poll in the Observer showed that two-thirds of the voters believe 
Thatcher should resign before the next general election, which must be called 
by mid-1992. It showed that 44% believe she should quit now, while 22% would 
like to see her go in 1992.

HOLIDAY AUTO TOLL AT 6; LAX SURPRISED BY LIGHT TRAFFIC

At least six people were killed on Los Angeles County roads and freeways as the 
Thanksgiving weekend drew to a close, including three family members in a 
pickup truck who were struck in a head-on collision with a compact car driven 
by a teen-age girl suspected of drunk driving, the California Highway Patrol 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
At Los Angeles International Airport, officials prepared Sunday for peak 
road-clogging conditions as 250,000 travelers headed home after the holiday, 
the busiest travel period of the year. But by late Sunday evening, the expected 
traffic jam had not materialized. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot lighter than we expected," said Lt. Ruben Martinez of the Airport 
Police Department. "We put on additional officers, but I don't think we're 
going to need them. I don't know where everybody is . . . they're not here." 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the CHP and local police departments reported 53 traffic fatalities 
-- four less than last year -- between 6 p.m. Wednesday and 6 a.m. Sunday, the 
latest available figures. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 451 people were arrested on suspicion of drunk driving in the 
county as part of the CHP's stepped-up holiday patrols on interstate highways. 
</P>
<P>
The worst traffic collision in the county during the holiday weekend killed two 
men and a woman and injured 8 others, including a 17-year-old Azusa girl who 
was arrested on suspicion of felony drunk driving, in a spectacular head-on 
crash in La Puente, said California Highway Patrol Officer Andy Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
A 46-year-old La Puente man, a 38-year old Salinas man and a 70-year-old La 
Puente woman were killed in the cab of a Toyota pickup when the vehicle was 
stuck by the speeding compact car at Sunset Avenue and Amar Road about 9 p.m. 
Saturday, Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
The three dead and seven of the injured, who were sitting in the covered bed of 
the truck, were believed to be related. Officials declined to release 
identities pending notification of the next of kin. The seven, with minor to 
moderate injuries, were being treated at three nearby hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car, who was traveling south on Sunset at about 55 m.p.h., 
lost control of her car as she sped through a yellow traffic light and careened 
into the pickup, which was headed north, Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the girl, who was hospitalized with major injuries, was not 
released because of her age. 
</P>
<P>
Early Sunday morning, rain appeared to be the cause of two fatal accidents, the 
CHP reported, including one on a transition road between the Foothill and Simi 
Valley freeways and a second on the San Bernardino Freeway in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers at LAX faced few traffic or parking troubles throughout the day 
Sunday, the culmination of a frenzied holiday weekend that saw 650,000 air 
passengers pass through the terminal gates, said airport spokesman Lee Nichols. 
</P>
<P>
"I was prepared for the worst, but it really hasn't been that bad," said Judie 
Richards, 41, of Los Angeles, as she waved goodby to her Las Vegas-bound 
daughter on Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Richards, who works as a reservations clerk for Northwest Airlines, said that 
she followed her own advice and showed up an hour and a half early for her 
daughter's 1 p.m. flight. 
</P>
<P>
Airport police and parking officials said they were preparing for traffic 
backups along Century Boulevard and long lines at the exits from parking lots, 
a common sight on Thanksgiving weekends. 
</P>
<P>
About 25 additional parking clerks and 12 extra officers were on hand to keep 
traffic moving, Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
However, traffic flowed smoothly on Century Boulevard, with only minor slowing 
at one of the airport's 10 terminals, airport police said.

<TEXT>
<P>
If you squint just a little, it's not difficult to believe that you are in 
south-central Florida. To the right, stretching off into the distance, lies a 
ruler-straight concrete drainage canal. Water runs smooth and fast through it, 
unimpeded by soil, trees, bends or the other geological vagaries that give a 
river character and vitality. 
</P>
<P>
To the left lie the graceful loops and oxbows of the old riverbed, now filled 
with near-stagnant water, barely moving in the dim twilight. The only thing 
missing is stultifying humidity and bombardier mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not twilight, and this isn't Florida. Rather, it is a hangar-like 
building at the University of California's field station where UC Berkeley 
mechanical engineer Hsieh Wen Shen has constructed a one-sixtieth-scale model 
of a section of Florida's Kissimmee River and the C-38 canal that replaced it a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
On this July day, about 20 members of the South Florida Water Management 
District are in the Bay Area to view Shen's model and to hear what he has 
learned about their ambitious and unprecedented project, frequently called the 
largest ecological restoration project ever attempted in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Their goal is the restoration of the Kissimmee's flow from the C-38 canal back 
into the natural riverbed. In the process, they hope to reverse the damage that 
has been done to the system, including the loss of large numbers of fish and 
wild animals, increased pollution of Lake Okeechobee -- the ecological 
centerpiece of the state -- and diminished aesthetic values. 
</P>
<P>
Shen's model is designed to tell Florida officials how to go about restoring 
the river most effectively -- whether engineers should build sheet-metal weirs 
or dams, fill in the canal with dirt or use a combination of the two 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
If the project is successful, "it could be instrumental in stimulating other 
restoration activities around the country," said ecologist James A. Karr of 
Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, Va. There are a number of 
wetlands areas in need of such restoration, including the Chesapeake Bay in the 
East and the San Francisco Bay, where development has destroyed wetlands and 
pollution has dramatically lowered water quality. 
</P>
<P>
Once, the Kissimmee was a shallow, meandering, 98-mile-long river that carried 
water south from Lake Kissimmee to Lake Okeechobee, from which it eventually 
drained into the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
But destructive hurricanes in the 1940s and 1950s whetted the public's appetite 
for flood control, and in 1961, the Army Corps of Engineers -- at the request 
of Florida officials -- began excavating a 300-foot-wide, 30-foot-deep concrete 
channel that shortened the water's path to a mere 52 miles. For the first time, 
boat traffic could pass between the two lakes throughout the year, and the 
$33-million waterway became a popular site for boating and fishing. 
</P>
<P>
But the ecological impact of the channelization project proved devastating, 
according to biologist Louis Toth of the Water Management District. About 
40,000 acres of wetlands in the flood plain, 80% of the total along the 
Kissimmee River, were drained and converted to pasture land. Those wetlands 
were home to, among other creatures, 5 billion small forest fish and 6 billion 
shrimp, all of which were lost, Toth said. 
</P>
<P>
The area was also home to eight endangered species, including Florida panthers, 
cougars, ibises, as well as a mosaic of eight major plant communities. By 
decreasing the area where the animals and birds could grow and thrive, the 
canal construction greatly reduced their chances for survival. 
</P>
<P>
But the one- to two-mile-wide flood plain was not the only area affected by the 
channelization. The wetlands filtered out man-made fertilizers and other 
organic materials from the river, preventing them from reaching Lake 
Okeechobee, which Theresa Woody of the Sierra Club calls "the liquid heart of 
South Florida." 
</P>
<P>
But today the water speeds through the C-38 canal 11 times faster than nature 
intended. Pollutants are not filtered from the water but added to it, as manure 
is washed into the canal from adjacent cow pastures. As a consequence, the 
influx of rich organics into Lake Okeechobee is three times as high as it was 
before the canal was constructed. 
</P>
<P>
The lake is so polluted now that algae blooms, as much as 100 miles wide, 
threaten to choke off all other life. "The way we look at it," Woody said, "is 
that the lake's problems have been exacerbated to the point there is a 
deathwatch on it." 
</P>
<P>
In turn, conditions in Lake Okeechobee, combined with encroaching farmlands and 
heightened development in southern Florida, are threatening the entire fragile 
Everglades system, home to more than 30 endangered species. "Of all the 
national parks, (the Everglades) is the one closest to extinction," said George 
T. Frampton, president of the Wilderness Society. 
</P>
<P>
The potential damage has been recognized for a long time. Even as the Corps of 
Engineers was finishing up the C-38 project in 1971, then-Gov. Reubin Askew was 
convening a conference to consider how to reverse the damage that had been done 
by the canal. That conference concluded that the "Kissimmee lakes and marshes 
should be restored to their historic conditions and levels to the greatest 
extent possible to improve the quality of the water entering Lake Okeechobee." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing happened for 12 years, however, until then-Gov. Bob Graham created a 
coordinating council of several state agencies to oversee the restoration and 
preservation of ecosystems throughout southern Florida as part of the "Save Our 
Everglades" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
By 1985, engineers had constructed three steel barriers, called weirs, along a 
12-mile section of the canal to force part of the water flow back into the old 
riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
But the demonstration project raised many questions about how to re-establish 
the river's flow. Should weirs be used along the entire length of the C-38 
canal, or should the canal simply be filled in with dirt to plug it, forcing 
the water back into the riverbed? If weirs and other types of dams were to be 
used, what is the best design? 
</P>
<P>
If the canal were to be filled in, what would be done about sections of the 
river that were completely obliterated during its construction? How can 
flooding outside the flood plain be prevented? 
</P>
<P>
Enter Shen, an internationally recognized expert on river dynamics who has, 
among other things, headed the United Nations' study of the environmental 
effects that would occur as a result of construction of the Aswan Dam on the 
Nile River. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1986, Shen and his students selected a one-square-mile section of 
the river that was already undergoing renovation and made painstaking 
measurements of river and canal dimensions, water flow at selected sites, 
vegetation and other characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
Using this data combined with extensive aerial photography, they constructed a 
100-by-60-foot model of the river section. Their model, in the Richmond 
laboratory, incorporates plastic mesh and other fibrous materials that simulate 
the roughness of the brush, trees and soils. 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously, Shen's group has been developing a sophisticated computer model 
that reproduces mathematically what they observe physically in both the real 
river and the model. Ultimately, the computer model will be expanded to cover 
large sections of the river more efficiently than the physical model can. 
</P>
<P>
With the model Shen can simulate changes in river level and flow under a 
variety of conditions ranging from drought to hurricanes and in any 
configuration: in its current state, with weirs in place, plugged with earth, 
or in any intermediate combination. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the physical nor the numerical modeling of the river is a new 
technique, noted hydrologist Heinz Stefan of the University of Minnesota, but 
the complexity and size of this project is. "This is not a routine kind of 
work," he said. "There is a great deal of added complexity because of the 
simulation of flood plains that are heavily vegetated." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Shen presented his final report and recommendations to the 
water district and Florida Gov. Bob Martinez. His primary conclusion: Most of 
the C-38 waterway should be backfilled and new oxbows should be dug in areas of 
the river where others were filled in during construction of the canal. Under 
this plan, the water would be naturally forced back into the riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
Any lesser measures, he said, would create two main problems: too high a flow 
rate and flooding during peak rain periods. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the use of weirs instead of backfilling would create myriad 
problems, according to Shen. If weirs are used to force water back into the 
oxbows, the rate of flow will be two to three times as high as it was when the 
river was in its pristine condition, Shen found. Such a high flow rate will be 
disastrous to normal river life, dislodging fish eggs from their precarious 
perches, sweeping away food that would normally settle to the river bottom and 
churning up mud and debris. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more important, the high flow rate created by the use of weirs 
would not allow the wetlands of the flood plain to be inundated as long as 
necessary. Those wetlands must be under water for as long as nine months of the 
year for waterfowl and other species to thrive. In many ways, if weirs are 
used, the restored river would simply be a longer canal without significant 
environmental benefits, Shen said. 
</P>
<P>
Under storm conditions, the problem caused by weirs would be worse. Flow rates 
through the oxbows would be much higher, causing erosion and depositing of soil 
that would disrupt navigability of the river and require dredging. 
</P>
<P>
The complete backfill plan, however, would mitigate all of these problems. Flow 
rates would be normal through more than half of the oxbows, the flood plain 
would be inundated for the required periods and water flow during storms would 
not be high enough to cause significant erosion and depositing problems. 
</P>
<P>
Implementing the backfill plan, however, would require constructing 60 miles of 
levees along the edges of the flood plain to control the flooding that was the 
original reason for construction of the C-38 canal. Ironically, some argue that 
the whole problem could have been avoided had the state simply put in levees in 
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
The principal objection to the backfill plan, Shen noted, is cost. Although 
precise estimates have not been prepared, crude estimates indicate the cost 
would be about $250 million. The use of weirs would be substantially cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
The governor and water district are not expected to make any decisions on the 
plans until firmer cost estimates have been prepared, and engineering studies 
are expected to begin soon. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups have pushed for the backfill plan all along because of its 
aesthetic values, Woody said, and they are "delighted" with Shen's 
recommendation. As she concluded, "We don't want to leave a legacy to our 
children of sheet-metal weirs in a concrete river."

CORPORATE AMERICA MAKES AN EFFORT TO SHAPE UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the UC Berkeley Wellness Letter 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Corporate America is becoming increasingly interested in health and fitness, 
according to two very different surveys published recently. One focused on 
work-site wellness programs; the other looked at the health attitudes and 
practices of large companies. 
</P>
<P>
About two out of three large companies now have at least one type of wellness 
program, according to a survey of more than 1,300 firms with 50 or more 
employees published in January in the American Journal of Public Health. 
Slightly more than half of the activities were started in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
Most commonly the programs involved smoking cessation, followed by health risk 
appraisal (to determine risk of heart disease and other disorders), back care, 
stress management, exercise, blood pressure control, nutrition counseling and 
weight control. Most firms offered two or three of these activities, usually 
free and on company time. Larger companies and those located in the western 
United States tended to have the most programs. The survey did not ask about 
programs designed to protect against accidents and other on-the-job hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Do such programs work? It's not always easy to tell. Some studies, notably 
those concerning Johnson &amp; Johnson's 11-year-old Live for Life program, 
suggest that these activities do help cut medical costs, reduce turnover and 
absenteeism, and help workers quit smoking. Apparently many employees do make 
use of the exercise facilities provided, thus improving their cardiovascular 
fitness and possibly boosting morale and productivity. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate wellness programs are frequently started when a fitness-minded chief 
executive officer takes charge or when other executives become enthusiastic 
about what they are doing to protect their own health. 
</P>
<P>
In Fit for Success, Dr. James Rippe, director of the exercise physiology 
laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, surveyed more 
than 1,100 top executives about their attitudes and behavior regarding health 
and fitness. Only 37% of the executives responded, so bear in mind that this 
sampling is probably not representative -- that is, the less-healthy executives 
may have been less likely to respond. 
</P>
<P>
Based on this highly select, elite group, Rippe concludes that "the days of 
stressed-out, overweight, two-martini-lunch corporate-types" are gone. Here are 
some of his findings: 
</P>
<P>
* 64% of the executives (average age slightly over 50, and nearly all of them 
male) exercise three or more times a week, compared to 20% of all adult 
Americans. And most of the exercisers include some aerobic activity, such as 
jogging, brisk walking, or cycling, in their regimens. 
</P>
<P>
* Only 10% of them still smoke. A whopping 61% of them had quit. 
</P>
<P>
* A nearly unanimous 98% rank their overall health as good, very good, or 
excellent. Three outof four of them say that they were ill fewer than three 
days in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
* Two-thirds of them know their blood pressure (which averages an excellent 
124/79). 
</P>
<P>
* 90% say they closely watch their diet. More than 60% try to restrict salt 
intake and cholesterol. Surprisingly, though, only one-third knew their 
cholesterol level. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these executives attribute at least part of their success and stamina 
to their fitness practices and the measures they take to protect their overall 
health. Looked at another way, it may be that the same abilities that make them 
successful in business also make them good at managing their health.

GROUP FLIES MUCH-NEEDED GIFTS FROM VAN NUYS TO MEXICAN TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
SANTA ROSALIA, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dozen single-engine planes from Van Nuys Airport braved thorny cacti and 
federales worried about drug smugglers to land during the Thanksgiving weekend 
at this town's tiny airstrip. 
</P>
<P>
"What's going on in Santa Rosalia -- a convention?" asked a baffled customs 
official at the border in Mexicali as one plane after another filed plans 
Friday to journey 350 miles south down the Baja peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
After all, this impoverished little mining town with its rocky beaches is 
hardly a mecca for tourists. Officials said the only group that uses the local 
airstrip is drug smugglers, who occasionally manage to refuel here despite 
attempts by federal police to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
But it is exactly this lack of cachet that makes the village an ideal recipient 
of the clothing, medical supplies and toys the pilots have delivered every 
Thanksgiving weekend for the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're lucky we have a harbor here with plenty of fish, otherwise, the poor 
would starve," said Jose Luis Nuno, as he helped the pilots and their families 
unload plastic bags full of cargo Friday evening at the airstrip. 
</P>
<P>
Nuno said the local Rotary Club will sell the hundreds of pounds of clothing to 
the poor for a nominal fee and use the proceeds to assemble baskets filled with 
enough groceries to feed 70 local families for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Without doubt, your efforts will be good for the lower classes here," said Dr. 
Miguel A. Montano, Rotary Club president and a hospital administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The annual pilgrimage from Van Nuys Airport is something of an occasion in this 
town of 20,000. At the end of journey, a five-hour trip that requires skill to 
avoid overshooting the one paved runway and landing in the cacti, the 30 
Americans were welcomed with cold beer and pots of fresh ceviche, an appetizer 
of raw yellowtail caught earlier in the day and marinated with spices and lime. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a neat feeling to help out directly instead of just giving money to a 
charity," said Ron de Moraes, 43, a television director who lives in Simi 
Valley. "And the Mexican people are so generous to us." 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the pilots are volunteer members of a Van Nuys-based squadron 
of the Civil Air Patrol, Moraes and several others joined the entourage after 
seeing signs advertising "Operation Thanksgiving" on bulletin boards at Van 
Nuys Airport. The participants gather donations of clothing, toys and medical 
supplies during the year from friends and fellow workers. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Hagen, a retired medical technician from Malibu, spent much of her spare 
time this past year washing and repairing hundreds of used teddy bears and 
other stuffed animals in preparation for the trip. "I feel like Santa Claus," 
Hagen said Friday as she handed out toys to children at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
The relief effort was started in the early 1980s by the Huntington Park Rotary 
Club and adopted by the Van Nuys group a few years later, said Lou Milligan, 
66, a Van Nuys car dealer and the organizer of the trip. The pilots spend about 
$150 per plane for fuel, and most take advantage of the trip south to visit 
nearby resort towns on Sunday, Milligan said. 
</P>
<P>
The only snag the operation has hit was in 1985 when border guards confiscated 
the group's entire cargo, claiming they were more capable of equitably 
distributing it than the Americans, Milligan said. Since then, the group had 
not been explicit about its purpose when crossing the border, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, the visitors attended a buffet dinner the Santa Rosalia Rotary 
Club gives every year in their honor. After sampling more than 20 local 
specialties, including fresh tuna salad and marinated giant squid, the guests 
were given small gifts, such as abalone shells and black coral necklaces carved 
from a nearby reef. 
</P>
<P>
The youngest person in the group this year was 11-year-old Heather Loring of 
Burbank, whose parents brought her to "teach that not everyone lives in the 
same way, but we are all people" said her mother, Carol Loring, a financial 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day in Los Angeles, you come across people in need," Carol Loring said. 
"We try to give at home through our church, but we believe in taking every 
opportunity to help out." 
</P>
<P>
Heather Loring had a chance to observe daily life in Santa Rosalia during a 
brief tour Nuno conducted Saturday for the visitors. Much of the village, which 
is tucked between a group of arid hills, has dirt roads lined with wooden 
buildings built by the French when they discovered copper here in the 1880s. 
The town's pride and joy is a prefabricated galvanized-iron church designed by 
A. G. Eiffel, who also designed the Eiffel Tower in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
But even at the church, where children met for a catechism class Saturday, the 
town's poverty was evident in the figure of a old man with a cane who 
approached the Americans for money. Later, as the bus left the center of town, 
the visitors could see on the hillsides tin and plywood shacks that Nuno said 
lacked running water. 
</P>
<P>
The town's fortunes, which declined in the early 1980s when the copper ran out, 
have improved lately with the discovery of gypsum, which is exported throughout 
the world for drywall, Nuno said. But at least 10% of the town's residents are 
unemployed, Nuno said, and many of those who work earn only about $3.50 a day, 
enough just to survive in an area where a carton of eggs costs $1, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Heather Loring may be too young to understand the economics of Santa Rosalia, 
but the trip clearly piqued her interest in Mexican culture, her mother said. 
On the way back to the hotel, the girl was practicing the Spanish alphabet with 
one of the pilots.

HERE THEY SHED THE CITY AND DANCE INTO THEIR JEWISH PAST 
</P>

West of the San Fernando Valley, under the shadow of the rugged Santa Susana 
Mountains, Peppertree Lane turns abruptly away from modern life. A sharp turn 
off Simi Valley's bustling Los Angeles Avenue, and strip shopping centers and 
tract houses are replaced by decades-old peppertrees and enormous cacti. 
</P>
<P>
Here, surrounded by the teeming suburb, is the Brandeis-Bardin Institute -- an 
oasis of natural beauty and ethnic heritage. And it is here, in this 
kibbutz-like setting of orange trees and carefully laid, stone-lined paths, 
that 100 Jewish men and women spent Thanksgiving weekend, immersing themselves 
in Israeli folk dancing and taking a break from modern life. 
</P>
<P>
"Step-step-step. Step-step-step. Listen to the sound of your feet!" commanded 
choreographer Dani Dassa, his eyebrows as dense as his Israeli accent, to his 
sluggish beginners' class. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen, you're not listening!" he repeated, redemonstrating a basic step 
during a Saturday morning workshop. 
</P>
<P>
"Now," he smiled, as the dancers finally skipped in a smooth, continuous 
circle. "Now, it's unified -- like the roll of a drum." 
</P>
<P>
The institute was founded in 1947 by a Ukrainian academic named Shlomo Bardin, 
who conceived the idea with U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis. 
Brandeis died in 1941, long before land could be found for the project. 
</P>
<P>
The institute holds a variety of seminars, weekend retreats and summer camps 
designed for assimilated Jews to rediscover their culture. Thanks largely to 
Dassa, a 61-year-old Leonard Bernstein look-alike fond of cupping students' 
faces in his hands, the folk dance retreats are among the most popular 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the appeal is community," said Dassa's wife, Judy, a New York native 
who enjoys watching talent and love bloom under her husband's direction. 
</P>
<P>
"You hold hands. You put hands on shoulders. You can talk to people without 
feeling pressure. You don't have to wait to be asked to dance. It links them to 
a people, a community, a country, a language -- it links them to a world." 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend's unmarried participants came from as far away as Seattle, Chicago 
and Wyoming to dance in the hills with strangers. Many had attended previous 
dance retreats or summer camp at Brandeis. Others simply wanted something 
different and the chance to meet someone Jewish. For $140, they got a 
meals-included experience that combined Southern California's fitness 
philosophy with Israeli history and lore. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend began Friday evening with Sabbath services and dinner and ended 
Sunday with a final dance review and lunch. Between dance sessions, students 
could roam the institute's 3,100 acres, chosen by Bardin for their resemblance 
to Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, to go dancing is therapeutic," said Michal Robins, 35, an Israeli-born 
psychologist from Woodland Hills. "It's amazing. It's cathartic. It's 
cleansing. It's physical," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like an addiction. Night comes, and you just feel you have to go. 
It's exercise, it has group dynamics, romance -- everything a person wants to 
have is in one chunk." 
</P>
<P>
"It's social and it's exercise and it's a tie to the culture all at once," said 
Debra Samuels, a 30-year-old marketing researcher from Chicago who keeps a 
kosher home and performs with an Israeli folk dance troupe. 
</P>
<P>
That enthusiasm was reflected in the vanity plates on cars lining Peppertree 
Lane: B DANCN, DNC WIME and I DEBKA, refering to a classic Eastern European 
line dance. 
</P>
<P>
A young chiropractor from Tarzana came to "get a good Jewish experience again" 
after a decade devoted largely to study and ambition. 
</P>
<P>
"Since May, I've had a spiritual revelation," said the chiropractor, 
29-year-old Steve Katz. "I went to the Esalen Institute and got in touch again 
with my spirituality. The chiropractor working with me suggested I go there 
after passing my boards, sort of to rejuvenate. He thought it'd be good for me. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a major experience," Katz continued. "It reminded me of my times at 
temple, that there is spirituality within the world." 
</P>
<P>
A 31-year-old architect from Jackson, Wyo., attended a summer program for 
college students at Brandeis 10 years ago and has "always had a real warm 
feeling about this place." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Larry Thalsaid, "a little bit of the Jewish part of myself 
has woken up. Somehow, it felt rather important to get back to my spiritual 
self, as if the rational side of humanity just was not quite making it." 
</P>
<P>
A real estate agent from Chatsworth, 28-year-old Lloyd San, said simply: "Maybe 
I'm at an age where I want to know more about who I am." 
</P>
<P>
After fueling up on an Israeli-style breakfast of cottage cheese, tomatoes, 
cucumbers and hard-boiled eggs, dancers broke into two workshops Saturday 
morning, one for beginners and one for advanced students. 
</P>
<P>
"Yemenite left, Yemenite right, a rum-pum-pum, a rum-pum-pum . . ." Dassa 
intoned for his beginners. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California "everything is very separate, and since everyone gets 
into his own car, it can be very isolating," Judy Dassa whispered as her 
husband taught. "We see a lot of college kids and there's a kind of 
desperation. They want to meet someone and they're afraid they won't. They 
don't know how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Across a footbridge in another dance hall, an anguished love song blasted over 
the stereo system. Advanced students, broken into couples, twirled gracefully, 
easily following the steps of a visiting instructor from Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Dassa wandered over from the beginners' class, looking on approvingly. 
</P>
<P>
"This is also nature taking its own course," he shrugged.

CARBON MONOXIDE DANGERS STUDIED

Very low levels of carbon monoxide, such as those found in a roomful of 
cigarette smokers, can trigger potentially hazardous oxygen shortages in people 
with heart disease, according to Dr. Thomas E. Dahms of the St. Louis 
University School of Medicine. The problems were seen at levels of carbon 
monoxide that are considered safe by federal air quality standards, Dahms 
reported last week in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
In studies with 63 men with coronary artery disease, Dahms found that they 
could perform 5% less work on a treadmill when their carboxyhemoglobin levels 
-- the combination of carbon monoxide and hemoglobin -- reached 2% and 12% less 
when the level reached 4%. Hemoglobin ordinarily combines with oxygen and 
carries it throughout the body. Carbon monoxide, however, binds with hemoglobin 
even more tightly than oxygen does. When people breathe carbon monoxide, it 
cuts down the amount of oxygen in their blood, and high doses are fatal. 
</P>
<P>
Standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency allow enough carbon 
monoxide in the air to take up 2% of the blood's hemoglobin. Dahms said a 
nonsmoker in a closed room with 20 smokers would breathe enough carbon monoxide 
to have about a 2% carboxyhemoglobin level. Someone who smokes a pack of 
cigarettes a day has levels between 4% and 8%.

Fossils recently discovered in east Greenland indicate that the earliest known 
land vertebrates may have breathed through their ears, according to 
paleontologist Jennifer Clack of Cambridge University. The discovery 
contradicts the accepted view that the first land animals with backbones had an 
eardrum, a feature that all modern amphibians, birds, reptiles and mammals were 
thought to have inherited directly. 
</P>
<P>
The new findings were based on a large group of fossils found by a 1987 
English-Danish expedition to east Greenland, an area that was once a lush 
tropical forest. Clack said the fossils included the largest samples ever found 
of Acanthostega, a 360-million-year-old creature about the size and shape of a 
modern newt. 
</P>
<P>
Other backboned animals from the same period had an eardrum connected to the 
inner ear by a thin rod which scientists thought conducted sound. They also 
believed the eardrums were housed in notches on each side of the skull. Clack 
said Acanthostega had the same notches but its rods, which were thick and 
plate-like, were unsuitable for conducting sound, suggesting that the notches 
did not house eardrums but instead supported small openings through which the 
animal breathed. 
</P>
<P>
The rods could have been used as pump handles powering the breathing movements, 
an arrangement still found today in some primitive fish.

EXPERIMENTAL DRUG TARGETS COLON CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Studies in animals have shown that a newly developed drug can cure colon 
cancer, a disease for which there is no effective chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
The research team, led by Dr. Beppino C. Giovanella of the Stehlin Foundation 
for Cancer Research in Houston, predicted that human tests of the drug could 
begin in as little as a year. 
</P>
<P>
Colon cancer strikes one in 25 Americans, an estimated 107,000 per year, 
according to the American Cancer Society, and 53,500 victims die each year. 
Colon cancer is third in incidence, behind lung and breast tumors, and in 
number of deaths it is second only to lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The most effective treatment is surgery and radiation; if colon cancer is 
caught in an early, localized stage, the five-year survival rate is 87%. But if 
the cancer spreads before it is detected, the survival rate plunges to 40%. 
</P>
<P>
The new drug, called 9-AC, is a derivative of camptothecin, first isolated from 
a Chinese ornamental tree called Camptotheca acuminata. In the early 1970s, 
camptothecin was tested in humans with an advanced form of gastrointestinal 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The drug produced partial remissions in some patients, but the trials were 
halted because of the drug's life-threatening side effects, especially 
leukopenia, a sharp decrease in the number of disease-fighting white cells. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers remained interested in camptothecin, however, because of its 
unusual mechanism of action. It inhibits an enzyme known as topoisomerase I, 
which is crucial to the replication of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid, the genetic 
blueprint of life) during the multiplication of cells. 
</P>
<P>
In the normal human cell, extremely long strands of DNA are coiled up tightly 
inside structures called chromosomes. Before the DNA can be copied for 
reproduction, it must be uncoiled so that the new DNA is not irretrievably 
tangled with the old. Topoisomerase I uncoils it. 
</P>
<P>
Cancer researchers are excited about the discovery of topoisomerase I because 
it offers a new point at which the reproductive cycle of cancer cells can be 
attacked. And because it is the only enzyme that uncoils DNA, researchers 
believe that cells will be unable to circumvent the blocked enzyme and thereby 
develop resistance to the drug. Studies have also shown that colon tumor cells 
have above-normal concentrations of topoisomerase I. 
</P>
<P>
Giovanella and his colleagues administered 9-AC, which was synthesized by 
chemist Monroe E. Wall of the Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina, to 
50 immunodeficient mice in which human colon tumors had been implanted. The 
group reported last week in the journal Science that, after treatment, all but 
one of the mice showed a complete remission from the tumors. Furthermore, the 
drug produced no adverse side effects. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, 50 other mice that received the tumors but no drug all died. 
</P>
<P>
"In 20 years of experimenting with human colon cancers at this laboratory, we 
have never seen this type of dramatic response," said Dr. John Stehlin, 
scientific director of the Stehlin Foundation. Experts cautioned, however, that 
many anti-cancer drugs found promising in animals were not as effective in 
humans.

QUESTIONS ON ROCKWELL SHIPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Myron Levin's article on the U.S. probe of Rockwell's shipping of "hot" 
materials brings up some questions: 
</P>
<P>
Is Rockwell's non-"proper compliance with procedural requirements" resulting in 
a box emitting radioactivity 2 1/2 times the permitted level an isolated 
incident? 
</P>
<P>
What about the effect on the health of the driver who was constantly exposed 
during the trip? 
</P>
<P>
Were the state police and the members of the emergency response team who 
escorted the truck after the accident overexposed? 
</P>
<P>
What about the workers who handled the box at Rocketdyne?

BISHOP BARS RITE FOR KILLEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a 33-year-resident of San Diego, I am incensed with the public attack by 
Bishop Leo T. Maher against Killea. As someone who also follows politics on all 
levels with regularity (developing an admitted cynicism in the process), Killea 
has a reputation for integrity and responsiveness to her constituents over many 
years of service. For Maher to impose a religious penalty on this woman because 
of her longstanding position on freedom of choice smacks of "hierarchical 
institutional" arrogance, to say nothing about contempt for deeply held 
convictions about the traditional separation of church and state in this 
nation.

PHILIPPINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a former Peace Corps volunteer in the Philippines (from 1985 to 1987) I was 
struck by the accuracy of John Cavanagh and Robin Broad's critique of economic 
"development" programs there ("Aim 'People's Power' to the People," Op-Ed Page, 
Nov. 7). 
</P>
<P>
In my experience, major development programs in the Philippines are little more 
than a way for local politicians and government officials to line their pockets 
-- either by awarding contracts to relatives and cronies or by stealing grant 
funds outright. In fact, one development official I talked to candidly admitted 
that his country's economic-development grants always included an extra 30% for 
"administrative costs" -- shorthand for the cost of graft. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to see how this can be changed. In a country where even 
government employees can't feed their families on their salaries alone, graft 
may merely mean survival for some. 
</P>
<P>
The great majority of Filipinos living below the poverty line want little more 
than a plot of land with which to feed their families. President Corazon 
Aquino's failure (or perhaps unwillingness) to address this fundamental concern 
has turned her "people's power" revolution on its head and restored to power 
the very people who are the causes of inequality in the Philippines -- the 
oligarchic elite. 
</P>
<P>
What should be even more appalling to us as Americans is that our foreign-aid 
dollars are helping to fund -- and, indeed, legitimate -- this mess.

<P>
How ironic that on the front page we read how six Catholic priests are willing 
to lay down their lives in the cause of democracy in Central America, and on 
the same front page that an American Catholic bishop uses his holy office to 
punish an American for using her right of free speech in our democracy 
("Pro-Choice Lawmaker Is Barred From Church Rite," Nov. 17). 
</P>
<P>
As a child I remember how proud my Northern Ireland Catholic father was that a 
Catholic was elected President of this country, overcoming the bigoted fears of 
a "papist" presidency. And how well he taught me what happened in Northern 
Ireland when the interests of democracy were subservient to those of religious 
zealots. Thank God he is not alive today to see the American Catholic hierarchy 
repeating the terrible mistakes of the past by coercing our politicians into 
becoming "agents of Rome."

PIERCE FARM'S FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I applaud all the exciting ideas for the future of Pierce College Farm in Ruth 
Loring's letter (Nov. 12). 
</P>
<P>
In a recent copy of the Pierce Roundup, I see that the president has already 
appointed a top-flight committee of business people to help him save the farm. 
With their combined expertise they will certainly produce some sound and 
innovative plans. Above all, these community leaders have the know-how to put 
their plans into immediate action. 
</P>
<P>
As a longtime resident, I am very pleased that the administration and the 
committee are anxious to preserve the farm as a profitable and attractive 
enterprise, which will greatly enrich the education of the students.

PIERCE FARM'S FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ruth Loring's thoughtful, imaginative letter on the Pierce College Farm (Nov. 
12) echoes my sentiments perfectly. I will go a giant step further than her 
suggestions and ask why not use the land for a Valley arboretum? 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County has arboretums in the San Gabriel Valley and South Coast. 
Doesn't the Valley need an arboretum more than additional religious sites or 
high-rises? 
</P>
<P>
Having lived 61 of my 62 years in Westlake Village, this summer I discovered 
Pierce College Farm. 
</P>
<P>
With hardly any student traffic afoot or in cars, it was easy to explore the 
back country of the campus: the country store, the acres of orchards, the 
cornfields, the rangeland, the nature trail and horticulture buildings. 
</P>
<P>
What I found appalled me. In this natural setting of potential great beauty and 
tranquillity, I found gross neglect and shabbiness. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully this open space will be preserved for the community college to 
develop (or other governmental agencies if necessary) to its highest potential 
as a place for all the people to use.

<P>
I am appalled at the decision of Maher barring Killea from receiving her 
church's sacrament. As a former Catholic, Maher validates my decision to leave 
the church. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Church has a right to oppose abortion, however, this country has a 
deep-seated belief in separation of church and state. Trying to coerce an 
elected official by means of religious blackmail is inexcusable. Does Bishop 
Maher not believe that Killea first and foremost is answerable to the 
constituents who elected her? After all, if we do not like the way she does her 
job, we will not reelect her. What if 75% of the voters agree with her. Does 
she ignore them because of the church's beliefs? 
</P>
<P>
Religious intimidation has no place in the government of a free people. 
Decisions of old men who are so far outside the mainstream of lay life styles 
do not reflect the complex problems in this century. What they really want is 
long gone -- women in the kitchen and pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
I would rank Maher's actions with the church's attitude on condoms to combat 
AIDs. Their apparent lack of care for the individual is abhorrent to any 
thinking person.

FIX THE JOB, NOT THE WORKER; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: IF INDUSTRIES ARE ALLOWED TO BAR FERTILE WOMEN FROM 'DANGEROUS' JOBS, 
SIMILAR RESTRICTIONS BY RACE AND ETHNICITY MAY FOLLOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN E. BERTIN, Joan E. Bertin is associate director of the womens' rights 
project of the American Civil Liberties Union and has assisted many challenges 
to these employment rules. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The notion that women must be sterilized if they want to work at certain 
industrial jobs seems bizarre, something from a fictional, despotic foreign 
nation. Not in the United States, surely. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
A federal appeals court has ruled that employers may bar all women of 
childbearing capacity from factory jobs if the job might be hazardous to a 
fetus. The bar applies whether or not women are pregnant, intend to get 
pregnant or are likely to get pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Other courts have rejected this approach, but the new decision is likely to 
encourage many employers simply to close their doors to women workers. Or women 
will have choose between fertility and employment. 
</P>
<P>
The case involves an automobile battery-making operation in which lead is used. 
Workers and their union filed a sex-discrimination case claiming that it is 
unjustifiable to bar women since lead is equally harmful to both sexes, most 
women workers will not become pregnant and workplace health risks should be 
reduced or eliminated by making the workplace safer. After all, that's what 
happened when toxic chemicals like DBCP made men sterile -- the chemical was 
banned, not the worker. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court rejected this approach in a decision that has broad 
implications. According to dissenting judges, women could be excluded from 20 
million industrial jobs. For unskilled women, such jobs may provide the only 
escape from poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Because they cannot afford to give up their jobs, many of these women may feel 
forced into sterilization. This has already happened and it's likely to get 
worse. With heavy financial responsibilities for children or elderly parents, 
some women will not have a choice. 
</P>
<P>
Employers with these policies claim that adult workers are safe at certain 
exposure levels, but that no exposure is safe for a fetus. To reach this 
conclusion, such employers often ignore the findings of federal health and 
safety agencies and rely instead on the testimony of industry-funded 
scientists. There is ample evidence that workers of both sexes exposed to lead 
face health risks ranging from adverse effects on sperm (possibly affecting 
future generations) to neurological damage and cardiovascular disease. 
Frequently, however, employers pick and choose among studies demonstrating 
lead's harmful effects to find the ones they like, usually those focusing on 
pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
Fear of liability for fetal injury is often cited as a justification for 
excluding women workers, but the concern should extend equally to both sexes. 
In fact, claims on behalf of the children of male workers outnumber those filed 
for children of women employees. 
</P>
<P>
And companies that handle toxic substances face potential lawsuits from an 
array of sources, not just workers. Toxic chemicals can spill in transport, 
leak from disposal sites or escape into surrounding air or water. The children 
of male as well as female workers may sue, alleging that a parent's workplace 
exposure caused genetic injury. 
</P>
<P>
If employers can identify fertile women as potentially "hyper-susceptible," 
then simply eliminate them to make the workplace "safe," all sorts of 
discriminatory possibilities open up. 
</P>
<P>
Some employers claim that certain genetic conditions that disproportionately 
affect racial or ethnic groups can be exacerbated by toxic exposures. Will they 
require genetic testing of all workers to identify those who are genetically 
"hypersusceptible"? Will they then seek to bar workers on the basis of race or 
ethnic origin in order to protect them or their offspring? 
</P>
<P>
Employers who bar women would sacrifice the interests of living children and 
adults for questionable gains for potential fetuses. When women encounter 
reproductive (or other) risks at work, they usually worry about them a lot more 
than the boss does. And they certainly are better equipped to decide whether 
they should stay, request a transfer or leave.

AROUND THE VALLEY: IT'S KILT BY ASSOCIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Padilla 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the skirl of bagpipes, men dressed in kilts walked slowly up the church 
aisle to the bare altar. There, they took broad pieces of tartan cloth -- 
emblems of their clans -- and laid them one after another on the altar, 
symbolically rededicating themselves and Scots everywhere to God's service. 
</P>
<P>
You would never guess this was Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
But the second annual Kirkin' of the Tartans at the First Presbyterian Church 
was filled with contrasts and contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the church the mercury hit 87 degrees, and boys in fluorescent green 
shorts skateboarded up Olive Avenue. Inside, hundreds of Angelenos sang "God 
Save the Queen." 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the member of the Gordon clan who hails from Hong Kong. Gordon 
Ting, whose father was born near the Tibetan border, must be the only Gordon 
with jet-black hair, almond eyes and a kilt. 
</P>
<P>
Only in America, as they say. What a country. The Kirkin' is a ceremony that is 
as cultural as it is religious: a chance for those of Scottish descent to 
praise their Lord and reaffirm their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"On this Kirkin' of the Tartans, we remember our brothers and sisters in the 
Church in Scotland," intoned a minister. 
</P>
<P>
It was an eye-opener for those not versed in Scottish history, or those exposed 
to too many Monty Python skits. The British comedy group treats the kilt-clad 
Scot as a subject of humor or curiosity, and, in one routine, diabolical space 
aliens turn Englishmen into Scots. 
</P>
<P>
But inside the First Presbyterian Church, the kilts were beautiful and noble. 
Men wearing pants felt left out. On the church walls, heraldic shields carried 
the emblems of each clan: three boars' heads for Gordon, a lion for Wallace, 
ships for Hamilton, five-pointed stars for Murray. 
</P>
<P>
After about 20 tartans were set on the altar, the bagpipe croaked to a stop and 
a typical Sunday church ceremony followed. In fact, until the closing hymns, it 
looked like any other Southern California worship service, except for the men 
dressed in kilts sitting in front of the choir. 
</P>
<P>
Then for a closing hymn, the congregation rose and, in lyrics seldom heard in a 
land settled by Franciscan padres, sang, "God save our gracious Queen. Long 
live our noble Queen, God save the Queen." After a brief musical bridge, the 
congregation started up "The Star-Spangled Banner." 
</P>
<P>
In a show of good sportsmanship that resisted reviving the War of 1812, the 
singers left out references to the rockets' red glare and British bombs 
bursting in air over American heads. Instead, they sang the rarely heard fourth 
verse, "Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just. And this be our motto: 
In God is our trust." 
</P>
<P>
In one sense, it all seemed out of place. "God Save the Queen" in the Valley? 
Even the church ceremony, though based on Scottish customs, was an American 
invention, created by a minister in Washington. Was this really Burbank? 
</P>
<P>
But then the warm, inspiriting sound of "Amazing Grace," played on three 
bagpipes, filled the church, the congregation humming along. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, tartans were everywhere -- if not on kilts, then on ties, scarfs, 
pants and sweaters. Everyone seemed at home, comfortable with themselves and 
with each other. It seemed so logical as the bagpipers paraded out the church 
door, the worshipers following. It was as natural as, well, Gordon Ting. 
</P>
<P>
Ting, a dentist from Agoura Hills, stood outside the church wearing an 
open-collared white shirt and the green, blue and yellow tartan kilt of Gordon. 
His father, Su Ting, left China to study geology in Glasgow, along the Clyde 
River in Scotland, in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
"He was quite taken with that country," said Ting, explaining that his father 
shared that interest with his family. "He named me Gordon, a good Scottish 
name." Back in Scotland, the dentist's father was known as MacTing. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some clans that restrict membership to blood relations, the Gordons are 
among the families that are open to anyone who swears allegiance to the clan, 
Ting explained. Other clans have members who do not fit the stereotype of the 
fair-haired, ruddy-faced Scot. 
</P>
<P>
"Clan MacLeod has an Apache," he said. "I think his wife is a Papago." 
</P>
<P>
Ting and his wife, Sylvia, met in a Scottish dance group. She's an Anderson 
whose American roots go back to 1747. 
</P>
<P>
The Scots guard their culture carefully, she explained, because they well 
remember when the English crown repressed Scottish nationalism in the mid-1700s 
by banning the music, language and dress of the Scots. 
</P>
<P>
"The kilt was banned," she said. The restrictions eventually were lifted, but 
the Scots have not forgotten and the kilt is a badge of honor. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a way to distinguish ourselves from the English." 
</P>
<P>
For Gordon and Sylvia Ting and their 9-month-old daughter Caitlin, it is clear 
that cultural identity goes beyond birthplace and ancestry. It is a sense of 
belonging to, well, the clan. 
</P>
<P>
And as for woodenheaded people who ask why her Chinese husband is wearing a 
kilt, she always replies, "He's from the Far East of Scotland."

SHOT KILLS WOMAN IN OCEAN BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman was shot and killed in an Ocean Beach apartment late Sunday morning, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police, responding to a call about at an apartment complex in the 4900 block of 
Muir Avenue about 11 a.m., found the woman with a gunshot in the upper body. 
Emergency crews summoned to the apartment were unable to resuscitate the woman, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide investigators were interviewing two people who were reportedly inside 
the apartment when the shooting occurred. Police also recovered a 
semi-automatic pistol. The victim's name was being withheld because relatives 
had not been notified, police said.

PATRIOTS' TEST PROVES THE METTLE OF BEUERLEIN; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: HOBBLED QUARTERBACK PICKS UP THE OFFENSIVE SLACK IN A 24-21 WIN OVER 
NEW ENGLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wherever the Raiders are in the '90s, they will need a quarterback, so they 
might long remember a cool November day in 1989 when Bo Jackson was merely 
mortal and the wily quarterback of the New England Patriots was using their 
secondary for target practice. 
</P>
<P>
And the Raiders' quarterback, down to one good knee and another in a brace, 
pulled them through. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots sacked Steve Beuerlein four times and rolled him over onto his 
wounded right knee another half-dozen, but he kept getting back up and firing, 
long enough finally to set up Jeff Jaeger for the 32-yard field goal that beat 
the Patriots, 24-21, Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"The knee's still hanging on my leg so far," Beuerlein said, smiling. "So we'll 
keep going as long as we can." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, who were longshots in the playoff picture a few days ago, are 6-6. 
They trail Houston and Miami, both 7-5, and are tied with Indianapolis, 
Pittsburgh and Cincinnati, each 6-6, in the wild-card race. 
</P>
<P>
Do you know whom they have to thank? 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking to their (Patriot) defensive line coach, Eddie Khayat, after the 
game," Howie Long said. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me, 'You know, that quarterback's got to be the toughest guy on your 
football team.' 
</P>
<P>
"He made a point of going up to him and shaking Steve's hand after the game. 
You know, that's respect. Steve's a tough SOB." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders needed nothing less. At one point, three receivers dropped 
consecutive passes from Beuerlein, and more than three Patriots dropped 
Beuerlein. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it more this week than I did last week because a few of the hits I did 
take, I got twisted pretty good," Beuerlein said. "It felt a little weaker than 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a sharp pain I get that stays for about 30 seconds to a minute. As 
long as I can walk it off, I'm usually all right, so. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
This game started off as the Raiders intended it to. Beuerlein drove them 76 
yards for a touchdown on their first possession, Jackson gaining 23 yards on 
his first four carries. 
</P>
<P>
But on their second possession, Jackson caught a 10-yard pass and was hit hard 
by free safety Fred Marion. Jackson, already playing with assorted bruises and 
twinges that had caused him to miss practice, wobbled off. Although he kept 
playing, and threw a terrific block on Steve Smith's touchdown run, after 
Marion's hit Jackson gained 43 yards in 15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo is a little nicked," said Art Shell. "This is early in the season for him 
(counting camp, Jackson is 12 weeks behind the others). He kept going back in 
and getting nicked, and going back in." 
</P>
<P>
It was at this point that Beuerlein's receivers dropped three consecutive 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, their offense having ground to a halt, now needed to stop the 
Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders contained their running game early, holding tailback John Stephens 
to one first-half yard -- in six carries. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Steve Grogan, playing in a neck brace, almost turned this one 
around with his 36-year-old arm. 
</P>
<P>
He led an 88-yard drive for a 7-7 tie, passing one yard to Cedric Jones for the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
Then he caught Raider Zeph Lee covering Irving Fryar and tossed Fryar a pass 
that went for a 49-yard scoring play. The Raiders were behind, 14-7, and facing 
a meaningless last month of the season. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Beuerlein and the offense took over at their 35 with 1:53 left 
in the half. 
</P>
<P>
There was a Jackson dash for 11 yards; a 28-yard pass over the middle to Mike 
Alexander; and five plays later, Beuerlein's 13-yard scoring pass to Mervyn 
Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez crossed the field under the Patriot secondary, caught the ball at the 
four-yard line, stopped and cut back on about three defenders for his eighth 
touchdown of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had to get one at that point to give us some momentum going into 
the second half," Beuerlein said. "Just to raise the level of confidence coming 
out for the second half." 
</P>
<P>
Their confidence boosted, the Raiders took a 21-14 lead in the third period 
after linebacker Thomas Benson's interception and 17-yard return to the Patriot 
33. 
</P>
<P>
A facemask penalty on the runback moved the ball to the 18. Two plays later, 
Steve Smith cut right behind Jackson's block, removing cornerback Roland James, 
and went 11 yards to score. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great to do something to help Smitty score because he's done so much this 
year as far as getting me in the end zone," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just like me going 90 yards. I was that excited." 
</P>
<P>
How's this for excitement? 
</P>
<P>
Grogan turned right around and combined with rookie Hart Lee Dykes on a 34-yard 
scoring play. It was 21-21 and who were these guys, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
Early in the fourth quarter, Beuerlein drove the Raiders to the Patriot 19, but 
there he was sacked by Kenneth Sims. The drive died and Jaeger came in to try a 
45-yard field goal, which would have tied his longest of the year if he'd hit 
it, which he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
On their next possession, with Jackson only in for half the plays and gaining 
seven yards in three cracks, Beuerlein drove the Raiders to the Patriot 15. 
</P>
<P>
Jaeger returned and hit this one, although it carried perilously close to that 
left upright. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I needed to make that one," Jaeger said. "Not only for the team, for 
myself. I'm not sure they would have kept me around if I'd have missed that 
kick. I thought about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had that many kicks like that, other than at Philadelphia (where he 
missed a late potential game-tying field goal). I'm looking at this as 
something positive for me now." 
</P>
<P>
Something positive happened for more Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
On the next-to-last Patriot possession, Terry McDaniel, the promising young 
corner who'd taken two interference penalties trying to contain Dykes, 
intercepted Grogan. 
</P>
<P>
On the last, Grogan threw up a Hail Mary and hit safety Eddie Anderson instead. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson caught it at the Raider 40 and blasted up the sideline, visions of his 
third touchdown and his end zone dance, the Fish Out of Water, jiggling in his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots dragged him down at their five, instead. Dance fever died for the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"I had it cued up but I didn't want to do it unless I got into the end zone," 
said Anderson. "I thought I had it until one guy came into play. I slowed down 
to wait for some blocking. What I should have done was to attack that one guy." 
</P>
<P>
Some days, it just doesn't go the way you planned it. 
</P>
<P>
Those days, only the strong survive. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
More revivals of Raider tradition: Marc Wilson's appearances were limited to 
holding for extra points, on which he was booed by what remains of the Coliseum 
fans. . . . "I saw Marc after the game," Howie Long said, "Marc's a good man. I 
told him I hear things are going good for him back there. Marc said, 'Yeah, 
they like me, I haven't played yet.' " . . . Long played a fine game, leading a 
surge that held the Patriots to 30 yards in 19 carries, after allowing an 
average of 151 to the last three opponents. . . . Long on criticism by NBC's 
Bobby Beathard, the ex-Redskin GM: "We're as responsible for Bobby Beathard 
being at NBC as anyone. We kick their (Redskins) butt just about every time we 
play them, and those are the players he scouted, drafted. We traded them 
everyone but Run-Run Jones (Raider equipment man), and we were about to lock 
that deal up when he left Washington. And that's fact. He was going to give us 
the right side of their offensive line, and their bookend defensive ends for 
Run-Run Jones. A lot of people don't know that. I'm going to let it out now." 
</P>
<P>
Heartless Lee Dykes? That's what they called Hart Lee Dykes, the Patriot No. 1 
pick, after some early drops this season. Sunday, he had four catches for 75 
yards and a touchdown, his fifth of the season, and drew two interference calls 
on Terry McDaniel. Let's try Heartbreaker Lee Dykes. . . . Steve Grogan passed 
for 179 yards and moved into No. 23 on the all-time list, passing Jim Plunkett, 
whom he replaced as Patriot quarterback in 1975. . . . Ex-Ram Gary Jeter, who 
went to New England as a Plan B free agent, recorded his sixth sack in the last 
six games. He has seven overall.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<P>
Sunday night football finally has arrived. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And Willie (Flipper) Anderson forever will be remembered for the night in New 
Orleans when he replaced Henry Ellard in the Los Angeles Ram game plan and 
Stephone Paige in the NFL record book. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Anderson caught 11 passes for 319 yards. Sunday night, he caught 15 
passes for 336 yards. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Flipper File: He is 6-0, weighs 172 pounds, was born and raised in 
Paulsboro, N.J., led UCLA in receiving his senior year, was drafted on the 
second round in 1988, and was nicknamed as a baby by his grandmother Pearl, who 
thought he sounded like a dolphin when he cried. . . . Maybe Al Davis should 
consult with Art Shell before moving the Raiders to Northern California. Shell 
is unbeaten and untied in four games as a head coach at the Coliseum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Shell never would have been able to celebrate a happy 43rd birthday Sunday 
without the aid of the Raider chapter of the Penn State Alumni Club. Wide 
receiver Mike Alexander caught a touchdown pass, fullback Steve Smith ran for a 
touchdown and guard Steve Wisniewski recovered Smith's fumble on the New 
England nine-yard-line to keep the winning field goal drive alive. . . . 
</P>
<P>
NFL coaches on the hot seat: Seattle's Chuck Knox, Atlanta's Marion Campbell, 
New England's Ray Berry, Indianapolis' Ron Meyer, Houston's Jerry Glanville and 
the Jets' Joe Walton. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bounty or no, the Eagles took a cheap shot at Cowboy kicker Luis Zendejas on 
Thanksgiving Day and Coach Buddy Ryan should be disciplined by the league. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Ranting and raving Mike Ditka looks as though he's a candidate for another 
heart attack. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What a fascinating, wide-open year this would be for a national football 
championship tournament. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Any of eight teams -- Colorado, Michigan, Florida State, Miami, Notre Dame, 
Alabama, Nebraska or USC -- would be capable of winning it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
How far should Notre Dame be dropped in the rankings after its only defeat in 
the last two years? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Last week, former Miami Coach Howard Schnellenberger said the Fighting Irish 
weren't in the same league with the Hurricanes. I guess he didn't just mean 
that both are independents. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It was difficult even for the most avid Notre Dame haters to root for 
swaggering, strutting, finger-pointing Miami. . . . 
</P>
<P>
For the first time all season, Notre Dame looked a step slow. Or maybe it's 
that Miami is a step faster than anybody outside Tallahassee, Fla., and 
Boulder, Colo. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lou Holtz didn't give Rocket Ismail enough to do Saturday in the Orange Bowl. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
The Notre Dame fumble that was ruled a non-fumble is another reason why the 
NCAA should go to instant replay. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Houston quarterback Andre Ware now is being projected as a comfortable winner 
in the Heisman Trophy balloting. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The many comparative scores of the Rose Bowl rivals: Michigan 28, Ohio State 
18. USC 42, Ohio State 3. Michigan 24, Illinois 10. Illinois 14, USC 13. 
Michigan 24, UCLA 23. USC 10, UCLA 10. Notre Dame 24, Michigan 19. Notre Dame 
28, USC 24. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Decisions, decisions: ABC reporter Jack Arute asked an Illinois fan at the 
Northwestern game Saturday if he would rather have his team go to the Rose Bowl 
or the Citrus. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Most unusual Nov. 25 matchup was Boston College at Georgia Tech. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum scoreboard doesn't give enough out-of-town scores. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Commentator Bill Walsh claims that this is the best San Francisco team ever. 
Wonder if he would be saying the same thing if he were still coaching the 
49ers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
There are more championships and fewer boxers around to fight for them than 
ever before. Tonight in Paris, 36-year-old Dwight Muhammad Qawi gets a shot at 
the vacant WBA junior heavyweight title against the famed Robert Daniels. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tex From Texas, a 2-year-old colt stabled at Hollywood Park, was bred in 
California. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dave Johnson screamed, "And down the stretch they come!" when he called a 
steeplechase race on ESPN. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, Easy Goer is favored over Sunday Silence in next year's Breeders' 
Cup Classic at the Sands Hotel future book in Las Vegas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I broke into a sweat watching the Maui college basketball tournament being 
played in a gym where the temperature was 90 degrees. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Golden State is talking to Dallas about a trade for Roy Tarpley, who is 
suspended and most likely will not play another game for the Mavericks. The 
Clippers, who have future draft choices to spare, also are interested in 
Tarpley.

MAJKOWSKI, DESPITE SORE RIBS, LEADS PACKERS, 20-19

A great tape job saved Don Majkowski's sore ribs Sunday, and his passing to 
Sterling Sharpe saved the Green Bay Packers in a 20-19 victory over the 
Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
Majkowski, who didn't practice all week because the rib injury, wasn't sure 
he'd even start. 
</P>
<P>
But he not only started, he completed his first 14 passes and threw two 
touchdowns to Sharpe as the Packers gained a tie for first place in the NFC 
Central with their second upset in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers, who beat San Francisco, 21-17, last week, haven't been in first 
place this late in the season since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay made the Vikings settle for field goals four times after they had 
moved inside the 20, the final time with six minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Brown, the NFL leader in interceptions among active players and sixth 
all-time, then came up with his 58th and 59th interceptions in the final four 
minutes to stop the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
"A good tape job secured my ribs," said Majkowski, who finished with 26 
completions in 35 attempts for 276 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't practice because of a lot of pain. But I had the adrenalin going 
right before the game. I wasn't even sure I'd start until right before I 
started warming up." 
</P>
<P>
He'd been bothered the week before by a sore knee and hasn't practiced in two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I should take next week off, too," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Majkowski's second touchdown pass of the game to Sharpe covered nine yards and 
capped a 65-yard drive. It also gave the Packers a 20-16 lead with 11 minutes 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Sharpe had 10 catches for 157 yards, the first receiver this season to get more 
than 100 yards against the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we had to win to have a chance to play in January," Sharpe said. 
</P>
<P>
With the Packers leading 20-16, Minnesota moved to the Green Bay six as Wade 
Wilson hit Anthony Carter for two passes covering 30 yards and connected with 
Steve Jordan for 17 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers gave up five yards to Herschel Walker in three downs but on 
fourth-and-one, Viking Coach Jerry Burns decided to let Rich Karlis kick his 
fourth field goal of the game, a 19-yarder with 6:07 left. That made it 20-19. 
</P>
<P>
"It was debateable," Burns said. "If we had gotten closer on the running plays 
-- maybe a foot or two -- we may have gone the other way. 
</P>
<P>
"They jammed up Herschel and we didn't want to come out of there with nothing. 
We knew we had six minutes to go to get the points. In retrospect I'd do the 
same thing." 
</P>
<P>
But Brown, a 15-year veteran, came up with his two interceptions -- one with 
3:57 to go and the other with 1:31 left -- to preserve the Green Bay victory. 
</P>
<P>
Walker's six-yard run, set up by Joey Browner's interception and 34-yard return 
to the Green Bay nine, gave the Vikings a 16-10 lead with 7:13 left in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Jacke's 42-yard field goal with 2:45 to go in the quarter brought the 
Packers to within 16-13. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay led 10-6 at the half, but Karlis kicked a 27-yard field goal, to make 
it 10-9 with 10:52 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
That scoring drive was kept alive when video replay reversed an interception by 
the Packers' Tim Harris on the third scrimmage play of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Harris grabbed a tipped Wilson pass at the 40-yard line, took two steps toward 
a wide open field and dropped the ball. But instead of an interception and 
fumble recovery by Green Bay's Brian Noble as called on the field, it was ruled 
incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
Majkowski lifted a 34-yard touchdown pass to Sharpe with 13:01 in the first 
half, giving the Packers a 10-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson completed four straight passes, moving the Vikings to the Green Bay 22. 
But three running plays netted only six yards and Karlis hit his second field 
goal of the game, a 34-yarder to make it 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
Karlis hit his first field goal from 19 yards to tie the game at 3-3 in the 
first quarter.

CLOSE NOT ENOUGH FOR CHARGERS, 10-6; 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO: COACHES CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT AS COLTS WIN ON TOUCHDOWN PASS WITH 1:54 
LEFT.

<P>
The reviews aren't even mixed for the Chargers anymore. They are a bad team. 
</P>
<P>
They have lost twice as many games as they have won, including a 10-6 torture 
test to the Colts in the Hoosier Dome Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But at least the Chargers still know how to mix their metaphorical sports 
cliches with the best of them. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just got to pick our pants up and go back out and play," said cornerback 
Elvis Patterson, moments after Indianapolis wide receiver Bill Brooks had 
undressed him on a crossing pattern for the 25-yard, game-winning touchdown 
pass with 1:54 remaining. That score dropped the Chargers to 4-8 and kept the 
Colts' playoff hopes alive at 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson admitted Brooks was his responsibility in man-to-man coverage. And 
Charger defensive coordinator Ron Lynn admitted he wasn't sure why an opponent 
had put together a long drive late in the final period to beat the Chargers for 
the second consecutive week. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I knew," Lynn said. "It would be one thing if this was the only time 
this has happened." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Patterson, Lynn nor anyone else associated with the Chargers could 
explain why this team has suffered its last six defeats by six, one, seven, 
three, three and four points. 
</P>
<P>
But despite Patterson's mistake Sunday and Lynn's uncertainty about his unit's 
fourth-period failings, the Chargers' demise, the rumors of which are not 
greatly exaggerated, is not the fault of the defense. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers, please: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Charger defense has allowed 11 touchdowns in the last 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Charger defense hasn't allowed an opponent to score more than 20 points 
since Week Two. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Charger defense limited four-time NFL rushing champion Eric Dickerson 
to 30 yards in 17 carries. It was Dickerson's lowest rushing total this year. 
And in his last four games against the Chargers, Dickerson has failed to score. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Charger offensive line committed six holding penalties, including three 
on one particularly ghastly fourth-period drive that ended with a botched 
24-yard field goal attempt when holder David Archer mishandled a snap from 
center Mark Walczak. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Charger offense has scored six touchdowns in the last six games. Gifted 
wide receiver Anthony Miller has produced five of those. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Miller who, according to the officials, committed an offensive pass 
interference penalty in the fourth period that nullified an eight-yard 
touchdown pass from quarterback Jim McMahon to running back Darrin Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a wrong call," Miller said. "They said it was an illegal pick. It 
wasn't. The guy (the official) just didn't have anything better to do than 
throw a flag." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson's touchdown and the extra point would have given the Chargers a 10-3 
lead. Instead they had to settle for a three-point edge on a 38-yard field goal 
by Chris Bahr. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts answered with an 87-yard, six-play drive that took less than two 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Henning had seen enough. "I'm not sure that if we played all day out 
there, we'd have won that game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Henning was unhappy with referee Gordon McCarter and his seven-man 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
Henning was especially incensed with the failure of line judge Ron Baynes and 
replay official Chuck Heberling to determine that Tom Ramsey's incomplete 
third-period swing pass to Dickerson was a lateral. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers would have recovered and scored on the play. But the whistle blew 
the play dead. Review of the replay upheld Baynes. 
</P>
<P>
One play later Henning wasted a timeout to ask for a "clarification" of Baynes' 
ruling, which he said he never got. "I wanted to clear up a cloud," Henning 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Henning used up his second timeout seven minutes later to decide whether to 
kick or go for a first down on fourth-and-one at the Colt 21. They got the 
first down and lost it on a false start by guard Broderick Thompson. Bahr then 
missed a 44-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon then had only one timeout left when the Chargers took over at their own 
31 with 1:49 remaining.

STEELERS SINK MIAMI IN RAIN GAME, 34-14; 
</P>
<P>
PITTSBURGH: A FLOOD OF 34 POINTS FOLLOWS DOWNPOUR AND WIPES OUT THE DOLPHINS.

<TEXT>
<P>
First came the rain. 
</P>
<P>
Then came a flood of points by the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
And before the Miami Dolphins knew what happened, their hopes for taking over 
the AFC East lead were sinking along with their cleats in the rain-soaked field 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh took advantage of five Miami turnovers, all inside the Dolphins 
40-yard line, and scored 34 points in a 23-minute span for a 34-14 win. 
</P>
<P>
Further dampening the Dolphins' mood was a shoulder injury that forced 
quarterback Dan Marino from the game late in the third quarter. By then, 
Miami's early 14-0 lead had dissolved in the rain, and Pittsburgh led, 27-14. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins (7-5) lost for the first time in four games and fell out of a 
first-place tie with Buffalo in the AFC East. Pittsburgh (6-6) beat a Don 
Shula-coached team in Miami for the first time in seven tries. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing in the mud and winning in the mud makes you feel good," said Coach 
Chuck Noll, whose Steelers did not commit a turnover in the poor conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"We practice in rain and snow in Pittsburgh all the time," quarterback Bubby 
Brister said. "We don't go to an indoor facility. Coach just says get your butt 
out there and practice, so the weather didn't bother us any." 
</P>
<P>
A downpour that lasted most of the first half produced two inches of rain, 
ankle-deep lakes under the benches and water on much of the field. Most of the 
rain fell after Miami scored on its first two possessions. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we just washed away with the rain," Dolphin linebacker Barry Krauss 
said. "As soon as the rain hit, something happened to us. We made mistakes, and 
they capitalized on them." 
</P>
<P>
Shula said the loss was "a real disappointment," adding: "We didn't get 
anything done in the second half. Nobody gave us a lift to get back in the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Marino bruised his right shoulder in the second quarter, struggled for several 
series before leaving the game. He completed eight of 16 passes for 128 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Three fumble recoveries and an interception thrown by Marino replacement Scott 
Secules helped the Steelers score their 34 points in the second and third 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
The surge started with Merril Hoge scoring on the first of his three short 
touchdown runs. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Pittsburgh's Carnell Lake picked up a fumbled handoff, ran 
two yards and lateraled to Dwayne Woodruff, who splashed along the sideline the 
final 21 yards to score. 
</P>
<P>
Brister threw two long completions to Derek Hill to set up Pittsburgh's next 
two scores. A 33-yard completion on third down led to Gary Anderson's 27-yard 
field goal on the final play of the first half for a 17-14 lead. A 53-yard pass 
set up a five-yard touchdown run by Hoge. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh's final 10 points were set up by Tim Tyrrell's recovery of a fumbled 
kickoff return and Greg Lloyd's 31-yard interception return to Miami's 
five-yard line.

Times handicapper Bob Mieszerski lost $30 Sunday when Earth Angel, the first 
horse in his parlay from Earth Angel to Patchy Groundfog, ran third in the 
fourth race. The loss left Mieszerski with a $1,187.30 profit for the meeting. 
He started with a mythical bankroll of $1,000.

Each racing day Bob will make at least one bet. He could make a straight win

FAIR JUDGMENT LOVES FOOTING, WINS CITATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When last seen under silks, Fair Judgment was a helpless sight, floundering 
around on soft grass and finishing up the track in the Oct. 22 Budweiser 
International. 
</P>
<P>
But that race was run over the infamous Laurel bog, a turf course notorious for 
its ability to retain, rather than drain, water. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood Park turf course, on the other hand, shed Sunday morning's 
two-hour downpour like a well-oiled duck, providing Fair Judgment with the 
perfect footing to finally score his first American stakes win in the $108,300 
Citation Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Fair Judgment's task was made easier when both Bosphorous, the morning-line 
favorite, and Ruhlmann, the morning-line second choice, were scratched as a 
result of the brief rain. Delegant, the other half of the Mike Whittingham 
entry, was also withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Mettee, however, didn't give the weather a second thought. "A soft course 
at Laurel and a soft course at Hollywood are two very different things," said 
Mettee, Fair Judgment's trainer, who also happens to be a native of Baltimore. 
"I never thought about scratching my horse." 
</P>
<P>
If anything, the extra give in the ground aided Fair Judgment in his 
three-quarters of a length victory over longshot Quiet Boy in the 1 1/8-mile 
Citation. The 5-year-old son of Alleged is a big, heavy-boned horse who pounds 
the ground and tends to burn his tender ankles. 
</P>
<P>
Neither did it hurt that Mettee was able to get Eddie Delahoussaye to replace 
Gary Stevens aboard Fair Judgment. Stevens, who took the call on Bosphorous and 
ended up watching the Citation from the jockeys' room, had ridden Fair Judgment 
in all four of his American starts. 
</P>
<P>
Delahoussaye, always a quick study, learned that Fair Judgment does not like to 
be hurried, no matter what the situation. The bay horse has one long, 
relentless run and a style that resists variation. 
</P>
<P>
Through the first half-mile of the race, Fair Judgment cruised along at the 
back of the six-horse field. The pace was being set by In Extremis, who opened 
a three-length lead down the backstretch and appeared to be in a wrestling 
match with Laffit Pincay. "He was running with his head cocked sideways," said 
Pincay of In Extremis, who also ran poorly at Laurel. "But he does that a lot. 
He's just very competitive." 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like they were going fast up front," said Delahoussaye, the meet's 
leading rider. "But the clock said they weren't." 
</P>
<P>
Around the final turn the field began to converge on In Extremis. Quiet Boy, 
who had dogged the pace from the beginning, put in a big run on the far 
outside. Patchy Groundfog, who was on the bit from the start, was in good 
position for the last run. Even the 7-year-old veteran Skip Out Front, third in 
last year's Citation, was in the hunt after being shuffled to the back of the 
pack. 
</P>
<P>
Delahoussaye chose the high road with Fair Judgment, circling wide and taking 
dead aim on Quiet Boy with a furlong to run. With jockey Martin Pedroza trying 
to get his first winner in 63 rides, Quiet Boy was running his best race since 
winning the Auld Lang Syne Stakes at Hollywood in July. But it was not quite 
good enough. 
</P>
<P>
Fair Judgment caught Quiet Boy inside the eighth pole, opened daylight, and 
then held his rival safe with one last burst. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing to it," the unruffled Delahoussaye said with a shrug. "That second 
horse was coming back at me, but my horse had pulled himself up once he made 
the lead." 
</P>
<P>
The course was labeled good, so Fair Judgment's final time of 1:50 hardly 
compared to Forlitano's stakes record 1:46 3/5 set last year. 
</P>
<P>
Fair Judgment is owned by Tokyo builder Tomonori Tsurumaki, who purchased the 
horse privately from Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum in 1988. Originally a $625,000 
yearling, Fair Judgment was three for 11 in Europe before joining Mettee about 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Mettee, 31, exhibits all the patience of his mentor, John Gosden, the English 
trainer who repatriated to his homeland last year after a successful decade in 
California. Gosden's hallmark was wait, then wait some more. 
</P>
<P>
Mettee was forced to wait with Fair Judgment last summer when the horse came 
down with a slight virus after his winning debut at Hollywood Park. Mettee 
waited again after the debacle at Laurel last month, worried that the race may 
have taken more out of Fair Judgment than was apparent. 
</P>
<P>
Now Mettee must decide if two weeks is too soon for Fair Judgment's next start. 
The Hollywood Turf Cup comes up on Dec. 10, with a $500,000 purse that is 
enough to tempt even the most patient trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fair Judgment returned $10.60 and topped a $101.60 exacta to Quiet Boy. . . . 
Champion quarter horse trainer Blane Schvaneveldt won his first Hollywood Park 
thoroughbred race Sunday with Temptation Time. The 5-year-old son of Olden 
Times won by 1 3/4 lengths for a $62,500 claiming tag. . . . Martin Pedroza's 
uncharacteristic slump reached 64 consecutive losers at the end of Sunday's 
action. . . . Gary Stevens tripled with consecutive victories in the fifth, 
sixth and seventh, moving into a tie with Alex Solis for second behind 
Delahoussaye in the standings. Delahoussaye leads by one, 13-12.

HORLICKS BREAKS HAWKSTER MARK IN JAPAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Horlicks, a New Zealand mare ridden by Lance O'Sullivan, won the Japan Cup in 
Tokyo by a head Sunday in world record time for 1 1/2 miles on turf after 
running neck-and-neck with Japan's Oguri Cap down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Horlicks' time of 2 minutes, 22 1/5 seconds broke the world record of 2:22 4/5 
set by Hawkster at Santa Anita this year. Hawkster, ridden by Russell Baze, 
finished fifth in the Japan Cup, Japan's only internationalrace. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-year-old Horlicks earned $956,000, the world's second richest prize 
behind the $1.35 million awarded to the winner of the Breeders' Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
The world's richest race is the Breeders' Cup Classic, which offers $1.35 
million to the winner, the Japan Horseracing Association said. 
</P>
<P>
"Horlicks started fast from the beginning, so I expected her to set a record 
time," O'Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
At the start, Britain's Ibn Bay led a pack of seven foreign and eight Japanese 
horses, with Hawkster in second spot before 140,000 spectators at the Tokyo 
Horse Race Course, outside the capital. 
</P>
<P>
In the stretch, however, Horlicks and Oguri Cap surged from the pack and dueled 
to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
Oguri Cap, ridden by Katsumi Minai, finished second and Pay the Butler of the 
United States, seeking his second straight Japan Cup victory, was third, three 
lengths behind Oguri Cap. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth was Japan's Super Creek, with popular jockey Yutaka Take aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Sir Richard Lewis, the odds-on choice, beat Fifteen Gold Stars by a neck in the 
$200,000 New York Stallion Stakes for 2-year-olds at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
Sir Richard Lewis, ridden by Angel Cordero Jr. and carrying top weight of 119 
pounds, won for the third time in six starts this year. He covered a mile on 
the fast track in 1:39 2/5 to earn $120,000 for Regents Farms. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen Gold Stars, 113 pounds and Jose Santos, was next in the field of five. 
5 1/4 lengths ahead of Skate's Honor, 113 pounds and Jerry Bailey. Coach Freddy 
and Talc's Reward followed. 
</P>
<P>
Sir Richard Lewis paid $3.00 to win, $2.10 to place and $2.10 to show. Fifteen 
Gold Stars paid $2.20 and $2.10 and Skate's Honor paid $2.10 to show.

<P>
Jockey Kent Desormeaux won with only one of his 11 mounts Sunday at Laurel Race 
Course, leaving him one shy of the record for most victories in a year. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux, 19, finished second twice and third twice as he continued his chase 
for the record of 546 victories set by Chris McCarron in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of pressure, but there's none for me," Desormeaux said. "It's 
all these people out here to see me, cheering me on, trying to see me get the 
record. The pressure was from them." 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux, who rode five favorites, got his only victory Sunday in the fourth 
race, a $16,000 claiming race for 3-year-olds and up, aboard Horse Talk. The 
bay gelding drew off in the stretch to win easily over seven others. 
</P>
<P>
He had seven chances to equal the record from that point, but could manage only 
a pair of seconds. Neither was close to a victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of seconds, but there was nothing I could do," he said. "They 
could have run the races 10 different ways and I would have ended up in the 
same spot." 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux, who will take a day off and not ride today, has been named on five 
horses on a 10-race card Tuesday at Laurel. Only one is expected to be a 
morning-line favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux had been named to ride seven horses at the Meadowlands tonight but 
has canceled those mounts so he can break the record in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
In the feature, the $40,000 Cameo Stakes for 2-year-old fillies, heavily 
favored Wedding Band, ridden by Edgar Prado, won by 1 1/2 lengths over five 
rivals.

THREE'S COMPANY, AT SUSHI FOR OPENERS

<P>
Three's Company kicked off its 1989-'90 season with five local premieres, live 
music, a new venue and a cameo appearance by artistic director Jean Isaacs. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber-sized concert was not a high point for the company, but it marked a 
welcome return to a local stage for San Diego's favorite modern dance troupe. 
Three's Company offers plenty to be thankful for -- even when the group is not 
operating in high gear. 
</P>
<P>
Sushi's second-story loft space, on the other hand, never looked so good for a 
dance concert before. Three's Company added a black backdrop to the white-box 
ambience and eliminated those annoying light spills that plague concerts in 
this no-frills venue. 
</P>
<P>
A dark dance floor and legs that hid the lighting instruments from the audience 
also enhanced the environment. With those improvements, Sushi proved an 
effective and intimate performing space for the troupe, although its limited 
seating Friday night left many dance buffs out in the cold and others sitting 
on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Three's Company's prolific resident choreographers -- Isaacs, and her associate 
director, Nancy McCaleb -- created all but one of the seven pieces on the 
program. That decidedly oddball addition was a dead-pan duet for trombonist and 
mime conceived by Pulitzer Prize-winning-composer Bernard Rands. 
</P>
<P>
Rands' "Memo 26 for Trombone and Mime" made an outrageous curtain-raiser and 
set up an evening of surprises. It was no musical milestone, and Rands' 
"choreography" amounted to little more than a series of poses, but it made a 
zany showcase for the artists. And it was vividly theatrical. 
</P>
<P>
The uncredited costumer decked Miles Anderson out in tattered raincoat and 
rumpled hat so that he looked like one of the street people who crouch in the 
doorways below the studio. Isaacs was all in black, in sharp contrast to the 
traditional white-faced mimes. 
</P>
<P>
The dancer never attempted to mime the musical cues that spurted at a furious 
pace from Anderson's trombone. Instead, the interaction was more like a 
conversation as Anderson spewed his cacophonous sounds in desperate bursts 
before the spotlight turned to Isaacs. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was Isaacs' turn to respond to the fitful score. The sly give and take 
continued throughout. However, it was really Anderson's show until the 
denouement. Flaunting pizazz, he sputtered, grunted and screeched feverishly 
with the trombone, coaxing every dissonant sound the instrument can make. 
</P>
<P>
McCaleb's "Aelia Laelia Crispis," a local premiere, was the most rewarding 
dance work of the evening. It was originally commissioned by the dance 
department of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, to a strong score by the 
university's composer-in-residence, Beth Mahocic. "Aelia" proved a most 
inventive duet, based on a medieval riddle about the mysteries of the great 
He-She. 
</P>
<P>
The medieval feeling reflected in the score was echoed in the marvelous gray 
costumes by Anupo. McCaleb discovered a stunning contemporary vocabulary for 
the movement -- full of androgynous lifts and exciting couplings. The piece was 
nicely danced by Terri Shipman and Kim Chidley, except for a few rough spots. 
</P>
<P>
McCaleb made only one appearance as a dancer last weekend, but her 
emotion-packed performance was extremely moving. Dancing her own "Sister of the 
Plague" (a solo she created last summer for another local dancer), McCaleb 
seemed possessed as she responded in twitchy spasms and frenzied gestures to 
the dark urgencies of the score. 
</P>
<P>
"Sister" is strong stuff, including the music (which the versatile McCaleb 
designed herself), and it was well worth another look. 
</P>
<P>
"No Shade," McCaleb's big premiere, had some powerful images and an important 
warning, but it didn't quite gel on opening night. It was the choreographer's 
reaction to the dangerous thinning of the world's ozone layer. Unfortunately, 
it filled the stage with Styrofoam cups -- which made it look more like a 
contributing factor to environmental deterioration than a protest against it. 
</P>
<P>
This was more of a performance art piece than a dance work. However, when it 
did start to move, the dancing sustained an intensity equal to the subject. The 
quintet spun violently out of control, then struggled vainly for survival in 
their hostile environment. At that point, "No Shade" showed us the rich 
potential McCaleb has for creating kinetic havoc. Anderson thumped a cactus and 
squeezed a plastic bottle to generate music. Sharp played the five-string 
electric violin. 
</P>
<P>
David Thayer's parched lighting designs were a big plus for the piece, and 
there were several striking icons scattered throughout the work, but "No Shade" 
could do with some polishing. 
</P>
<P>
"No Subject/No Object," Isaacs' answer to J. S. Bach's suite for unaccompanied 
cello, had its beautiful moments -- particularly in the dreamy duet section for 
Denise Dabrowski and Brian Cluggish. But it fell a bit short of its goal (to 
erase the boundaries between self and dreams). 
</P>
<P>
Dabrowski, one of the most accomplished dancers in town these days, had her 
best exposure of the evening when she teamed up with Cluggish. And she took it 
to the limits, even though her partner's moves were awkward. Isaacs' 
choreography played upon the physical differences between delicate Dabrowski 
and her lumbering partner to make this twosome soar, and it worked well enough. 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs' new trio, "Three Girls at the Ball," had a giddy sense of humor, but 
not enough to keep the ball rolling. The whimsy was at its best in the angular 
robotics of Terry Wilson. When the three girls got together in their funky 
beachwear, the comedy (and the dancing) seemed flat. 
</P>
<P>
Terri Shipman's interpretation of McCaleb's "Illuminata," was the oldest dance 
(1985) on the program, but it is still going strong. Anderson and Sharp 
supplied the delightful accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
Three's Company will start rehearsing, with a record number of salaried dancers 
on the payroll, early in December, but the troupe will not perform again in San 
Diego until March.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS: MAGAZINE KILLS S.D. ADS FOR 
'PUBLISHER WHO CARES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In their never-ending search for ways to publicly express their discontent with 
Union-Tribune publisher Helen Copley, members of the local chapter of the 
Newspaper Guild, involved in increasingly bitter contract negotiations with the 
company, decided to place anonymous position-wanted ads in Editor and 
Publisher, the national trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
After first checking with the magazine to ensure it would accept a large group 
of classifieds, 46 ads representing more than 75 reporters and editors were 
written and sent off to the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the ads clearly identified the authors as Union-Tribune employees 
seeking a "publisher who cares about employees," or something similar. Many 
were more detailed. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to let people know nationally that something is wrong here," one 
participant said. "That it's not just a bunch of hotheads embroiled in a labor 
dispute." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Editor and Publisher advertising department reversed its decision 
and rejected 43 of the 46 ads. 
</P>
<P>
Editor and Publisher advertising manager Donald Parvin said he was "naive" when 
he originally told the Guild members he would accept the ads, believing that 
they would submit ads legitimately seeking employment. 
</P>
<P>
The ads were not an attempt "to get relocated by sincere people," Parvin said. 
Noting that the magazine reserves the right to refuse ads, he said the U-T ads 
would confuse readers looking for real position-wanted ads. 
</P>
<P>
Parvin bristled at any suggestion that Copley's influence as a major advertiser 
might have affected the magazine's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had no contact with Copley," Parvin said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, negotiations between the guild and the newspaper continued last 
week. The two sides reportedly came to an "understanding" on health-care costs, 
an important economic stumbling block. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of reporters and photographers at both the Union and Tribune are 
continuing a byline boycott against the papers, refusing to put their names on 
stories and photos. The boycott is now entering its third week. Notable 
non-participants include columnists Tom Blair and Michael Grant, and several 
members of the sports staff. 
</P>
<P>
An unsigned letter to The Times complained about a recent column in this space, 
which chastised local TV sports departments for not following the commonly 
accepted style of listing the visiting team first and the home team second when 
reporting scores. The author pointed out that The Times and U.S.A. Today list 
the winners first in boxes on the front pages of the sports sections, and said 
an apology was due to the sports departments. 
</P>
<P>
The writer clearly missed the point. Both newspapers include box scores, and 
plainly tell readers at least once where the games were played -- basic 
information that the local television stations don't bother to share with 
viewers because of their refusal to follow the logical format. Even the 
television networks follow the style when giving the scores. 
</P>
<P>
"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire. It's easy to take pot shots at 
television sportscasters," the articulate, shy author wrote. 
</P>
<P>
He identified himself as a "local sportscaster." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Chargers received a call from former running back Chuck Muncie's 
attorney after the team aired an interview with Muncie on a recent episode of 
the "Chargers Report" television show. 
</P>
<P>
The interview, taped in the Metropolitan Correction Center, where Muncie is 
serving a 2 1/2-year sentence for drug-related offenses, included a strong 
anti-drug message. Muncie evidently thought the interview was intended for use 
in schools, and was surprised to see it on television, without so much as a 
notification from the team. 
</P>
<P>
Muncie's attorney, Cynthia Aaron, said it was Muncie's "preference" that the 
interview not be used by the Chargers until after his legal situation is 
completely resolved, i.e. he is out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Chargers spokesman, there was a "lack of communication." 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge last week denied a motion by an attorney representing 
Copley Press to unseal a civil suit filed by six deputies against Sheriff John 
Duffy. One of the main reasons for keeping the case sealed was to protect the 
identities of the deputies, who are facing disciplinary action in the sheriff's 
probe of inmate abuse at the El Cajon jail. 
</P>
<P>
One problem: The San Diego Daily Transcript had already printed the names, 
which it discovered by simply scanning court records. The next day, the San 
Diego Tribune also printed the names. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney for Copley Press argued that, because the names were already 
public, there was little reason to keep the case sealed. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge James R. Milliken, clearly irritated, denied the motion. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it is valid argument," to use the publication of the names, 
which "borders on unethical," to argue for the opening of the case, he said the 
next day. "It is an argument I find almost contemptuous." 
</P>
<P>
With the station owners heading toward Chapter 7 involuntary bankruptcy, there 
has been a rash of gallows humor at KNSD-TV (Channel 39). One report has the 
station's call letters being changed to KNSF for "non-sufficient funds." 
Instead of Channel 39, Cable 7, one staff jokester says, the station will now 
be identified as "Channel 39, Chapter 7." . . . 
</P>
<P>
KGTV (Channel 10) anchorwoman Kimberly Hunt is negotiating for a new contract 
with the station. Her current deal expires next month. "I would like to stay 
here," she said, although she acknowledged having discussions with other 
stations. Her agent is Ken Lindner, who recently inked an L.A. deal for Michael 
Tuck. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Besides turning disc jockeys Mike Berger, Jeff Prescott and Cookie (Chainsaw) 
Randolph into poster children for insomnia, KGB-FM's (101.5) 30-hour 
"Foodathon" collected almost 17 tons of food for the Joan Kroc St. Vincent De 
Paul Center, plus more than $1,000 in unsolicited cash donations. . . . 
</P>
<P>
From the San Diego Daily Transcript: "Allen Neuharth, past chairman of Gannett, 
told a gathering of the San Diego Communications Council that anonymous sources 
in news stories should be banned. A source says that's impractical." . . . 
</P>
<P>
The name of the morning sports personality at KGMG-FM (Magic 102) has a 
familiar ring. It's Benny Ricardo, former kicker for the Vikings, Lions and 
Saints of the NFL. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Former KCBQ morning personality Jack Hayes is the new afternoon news anchor at 
XTRA-AM (690).

PIERCING JAPAN 'MYTHS'; 
</P>
<P>
MAVERICK SCHOLAR CHALMERS JOHNSON INSPIRES A NEW GENERATION OF CRITICS WHO 
DISPUTE TRADITIONAL THEORIES ABOUT THE JAPANESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asia scholar Chalmers Johnson is like a mad slasher, furiously lancing every 
shibboleth many Americans have long held about the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
The major one: No, the Japanese are not going to become just like us. Whatever 
pride postwar America took in what it regarded as its faithful student, Japan 
is not going to willingly open its markets as widely as ours. Or become a 
consumer-driven society like us. Or adopt American-style institutions, such as 
a government that regulates rather than develops industry. 
</P>
<P>
And why should it? Playing by its own rules, inventing new institutions of 
capitalism and putting them together in innovative ways, Japan has succeeded 
smashingly, says the professor of Pacific international relations at the 
University of California at San Diego. It is now the technological leader in 
most future industries and, per capita, the world's richest nation. 
</P>
<P>
So Americans should forget about trying to compete with Japan along standard 
free-market rules, he says. The United States can instead adopt equally 
effective strategies, starting with a coherent industrial policy to foster 
competitiveness. It can retaliate against Japan if it refuses to reciprocate 
with open markets. Preferably, it should do both. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan is not going to become a clone of America, and the reason people think 
that is because they know so damn little about Japan," Johnson said. "We in 
America should understand that the Japanese have no incentive to change. They 
have adapted brilliantly to a world created by the conqueror. We have to change 
and present them with a new world to adapt to." 
</P>
<P>
For such views, vigorously held and bluntly expressed, the 58-year-old scholar 
has been anointed the intellectual "Godfather of Revisionism." A new, more 
skeptical thinking toward Japan that is beginning to take hold among leaders in 
U.S. government, business and academia, revisionism holds that Japan really is 
different and should no longer be treated paternalistically. The theory 
advocates new trade policies that recognize Japan and America are playing by 
two different sets of rules. 
</P>
<P>
Those policies, depending on the revisionist, include retaliation if Japan 
insists on clinging to its closed markets and non-tariff barriers and 
insistance on a guaranteed market share in certain industries. Most 
prominently, revisionists advocate learning a lesson from Japan and adopting a 
U.S. industrial policy to help promote strategic industries and desirable 
economic behaviors, such as a higher savings rate and long-term business 
outlook. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has studied Japan since 1953, but his work has been recently 
popularized by three authors: Dutch journalist Karel van Wolferen, former trade 
negotiator Clyde Prestowitz and James Fallows of the Atlantic Monthly magazine. 
</P>
<P>
In America, the four are known as revisionists. In Japan, they're called the 
"Gang of Four." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson doesn't mind the company. But he hates the terms. 
</P>
<P>
"Godfather, OK. Guru, well, maybe," the professor says. "But I don't regard my 
work in any way as revisionism. I regard it as serious institutional analysis." 
</P>
<P>
He has a point. His seminal work on the subject is a 1982 tome titled, "MITI 
and the Japanese Miracle." It is a history of Japan's Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry, and, on its face, hardly seems the stuff that would fuel a 
growing war of words across the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
But his work was the first American analysis of how one government bureaucracy 
directed and fostered Japan's startling postwar economic growth. In the 
process, Japan created new capitalistic institutions, ranging from industrial 
financing to business groupings to a savings system, and perfected a smooth 
business-government relationship. 
</P>
<P>
None of it was like anything that the United States had ever seen before, and 
the book thus challenged prevailing theories that Japan was simply a marvelous 
student of American tutelage. 
</P>
<P>
"The Americans have consistently interpreted Japan's great economic success as 
a validation of their own political philosophies, and they are terribly wrong," 
Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has his critics, of course. Some scholars, both American and Japanese, 
think that he does not adequately recognize the role of politics or market 
forces in Japan. Others disagree with his prescriptions, or at least the way 
that some people are interpreting them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people have begun to use his ideas that Japan should be seen 
as a model for the United States, especially that the U.S. should have an 
industrial policy, and I think those people are wrong," says Erwin Scheiner, 
professor of Japanese history at the University of California at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"Politics plays a much more important role in American policy-making than in 
Japan. So when you're talking about a system in which bureaucrats can guide all 
policy without having to worry as much about political interests . . . it would 
not work." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson himself acknowledges that his views have not been infallible. He used 
to advocate protecting Japan's rice market. He also defended the nation's 
Byzantine distribution system in the past, saying the Japanese "rightly resent" 
it being described by foreigners as a non-tariff barrier. In both cases, he 
says now, he was plain wrong. 
</P>
<P>
But, at the very least, Johnson and the revisionists are forcing new candor 
into the noisy debate between the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"The revisionism thing is a kind of red herring," Johnson says over a scallop 
salad in the newly constructed Faculty Center on the UCSD campus. "It isn't so 
much new as it is getting Americans to wake up." 
</P>
<P>
He grabs public attention with colorful, unconventional and often outrageous 
pronouncements on the United States, Japan and relations between the two 
countries. Japan's legendary low crime rate, for instance, isn't caused by its 
monoracial society but by the Yakuza, one of the world's largest organized 
crime networks. The professionals, he argues, supersede the large-scale 
presence of amateur street crime. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson sparked his lifelong interest in Japan and Asia as a young naval 
student during the Korean War. He earned his undergraduate degree in economics 
and his masters and doctorate degrees in political science, all at UC Berkeley. 
For the next 26 years, from 1962 to 1988, he stayed at Berkeley, teaching 
political science, arguing against the Cultural Revolution that had captivated 
many of his students, and eventually chairing the Center for Chinese Studies, 
Political Science Department and Group in Asian Studies. 
</P>
<P>
His seven-page resume lists an impressive number of fellowships, honors, 
appointments and consulting positions, including nine years for the Central 
Intelligence Agency's Office of National Estimates. He has written 11 major 
books and dozens of articles, from "Freedom of Thought and Expression in China" 
in 1959 to "Rethinking Japanese Politics: A Godfather Reports" in the current 
issue of Freedom at Issue magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, UCSD lured Johnson from Berkeley to San Diego to help start its 
Graduate School of International Relations and Pacific Studies. It was a coup 
that gave the program instant credibility. For Johnson, it was an irresistible 
chance to do what he had long and loudly advocated: train Americans for the 
urgent challenge of East Asia with not only courses in the region's political 
economy and history, but, most importantly, its languages. Students cannot 
graduate unless they have attained fluency in Chinese, Japanese or Spanish. San 
Diego is the first U.S. graduate school to insist on that requirement. 
</P>
<P>
"Most universities today are more part of the problem than the solution," 
Johnson says. "The challenge of East Asia is a real challenge, not just to 
business but to academia. I don't want to criticize Berkeley, but I don't think 
its been enormously responsive to this challenge." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Johnson lays much of the blame for America's misunderstandings about 
Japan in the lap of Cold War scholars and policy-makers. Starting with former 
Ambassador Edwin Reischauer, he argues, they promoted Japan for ideological 
reasons as a democratic nephew who would grow up to be just like Uncle Sam. The 
problem, he says, was that it just wasn't true. And it was American arrogance, 
the tendency to project Western values on other countries, to think that it 
could be. 
</P>
<P>
"What is being revised here, and it's extremely embarrassing to a university, 
is that much of our social science is not social science but ideology," Johnson 
says. "America went to war with the Marxists, and we've been blindsided by 
someone playing a different game." 
</P>
<P>
Prestowitz, who wrote "Trading Places: How We Allowed Japan to Take the Lead," 
agrees with the argument. "The U.S. wanted to tie Japan to it in its crusade 
against the Soviets," Prestowitz says. "So the whole thrust of postwar America, 
State Department policy . . . and most of the academic writing on Japan, has 
asserted the essential likeness, the shared values, the similarities of the two 
systems." 
</P>
<P>
That the differences are now being recognized and scrutinized make many of the 
Japanese uncomfortable. Some fear it will eliminate any common ground for 
alliances, but Johnson says it was in fact the start of a more realistic 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Once America recognizes the realities, he says, the nation can finally begin 
adopting solutions. He rejects protectionism and says a coherent industrial 
policy is the alternative to it: incentives to save rather than spend; to 
invest for the long term rather than quarterly profits; to rely more on the 
banking system than the capital markets to finance industry; to improve 
education, especially science; to revamp labor-management relations, to develop 
a larger number of engineers. 
</P>
<P>
All of that, however, would seriously rattle the U.S. status quo and jeopardize 
special interests -- which in many ways are greater threats to the United 
States than the Japanese, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, what is not often mentioned about the "godfather" is that he is far 
more critical about his own country than Japan. "I would not like to be called 
a Japan basher, but I am prepared to be called an America basher," Johnson 
says. "We have important things to do and we ought to be doing them." 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson, a Republican, is pessimistic that the country's political 
leadership is willing or capable of coaxing Americans to bear the necessary 
sacrifices to respond to the Japanese challenge. And in his crystal ball, that 
portends a gloomy future. 
</P>
<P>
"(George) Bush manages to be a walking watercress sandwich on every issue," 
Johnson says. "I think things will probably proceed toward crisis, at which 
point it will become politicized and Americans will finally react."

Americans have mixed feelings about gaining control of the companies they work 
for, a new Gallup survey has found. 
</P>
<P>
Many want to own stock in their employer, and most trust they would be better 
stewards of their firm's long-term interests than are outside shareholders, 
according to the poll of 1,035 people conducted on behalf of the Employee 
Benefit Research Institute in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But although they want more of a voice in day-to-day matters, most of those 
questioned want to work in companies with clear distinctions between employees 
and management, and they want managers to make the important decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The poll, taken in September for release today, affirms that some, but not all, 
of the advantages cited by backers of employee stock ownership plans, or ESOPs. 
Increasingly popular, ESOPs now give 10 million workers stakes in more than 
9,600 companies, among them Avis, Weirton Steel, Polaroid and Hospital Corp. of 
America. In Southern California, companies with employee ownership plans are as 
varied as L &amp; L Nursery Supply, a wholesaler in Chino, and Times Mirror, 
publisher of the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
One group of supporters -- companies threatened by hostile takeovers -- has 
used ESOPs to put stock into the hands of workers expected to be loyal to 
current management in any contest over their company's future. The poll 
confirms that expectation: 65% of respondents said they would not sell their 
stock to a hostile investor even if offered 50% more than the market value of 
their shares. 
</P>
<P>
Other ESOP backers -- advocates of workplace democracy -- have contended that 
employees are more productive and companies less buffeted by pressure to 
perform in the short term when workers have a significant ownership stake in 
their firms. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the poll found that 69% of respondents said they believed that 
employees would be more likely than outside stockholders to vote their shares 
in the long-term interest of a company. 
</P>
<P>
But the results were hazier as to stock ownership's likely effects on workers' 
attitudes toward their jobs. A bare majority of those questioned, 51%, said 
stock ownership would increase their "commitment" to their work, though smaller 
percentages predicted a positive effect on their work quality, productivity or 
job satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
Experts on employee ownership say ESOPs have their greatest impact on the 
workplace in the roughly 40% of cases in which stock ownership is coupled with 
heightened worker involvement in decision-making. Studies have found that firms 
that pair stock ownership with employee involvement programs achieve annual 
growth rates 8% to 11% higher than those of firms where employees get stock but 
little else changes. 
</P>
<P>
"Either one by itself, in theory, is supposed to produce that kind of result," 
said Martin A. Staubus, associate director of the ESOP Assn., a Washington 
trade group. "Yet, in practice, we just see very spotty results when only one 
approach is tried and a remarkably consistent result when they're coupled 
together." 
</P>
<P>
The survey results indicate a real, but not universal, hunger for stock 
ownership. According to the poll, 44% of the respondents would trade their next 
pay increase for stock in the company they work for. But another 44% would not. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was easier when those polled were ask to choose between stock that 
could be cashed out at retirement and employer-paid health insurance after 
retirement. A decisive 69% preferred the insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does it appear that ownership lessens American workers' historic reserve 
about controlling the destiny of their companies. 
</P>
<P>
Most Americans, 56% in the poll, prefer to work for a company with a clear 
management hierarchy, rather than for a more level, democratic organization -- 
though younger people, minorities and residents of Western states said they 
were more open to a less structured workplace. 
</P>
<P>
And while 61% of those questioned felt strongly that companies fail to give 
workers enough say in decisions that affect them, large majorities want 
management to remain firmly in control. Of those polled, 72% said management 
alone should determine a company's long-term financial strategy, 71% said 
bosses should set hiring and firing policies, and 56% said managers should set 
rules for conduct at work. 
</P>
<P>
"Employees really are not very interested in the overall policies of their 
companies as long as things are going reasonably well," said Corey Rosen, 
executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership, a membership 
and research group in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Employee stock ownership, Rosen said, is like citizenship: "You're glad you 
have the vote, but you don't really want to get involved in being a city 
councilman." 
</P>
<P>
The error range in the poll was plus or minus 3.1%, according to the Employee 
Benefit Research Institute. Of those polled, 56% were employed full time and 
17% worked for companies with employee stock ownership plans.

Semiconductor Slump Seen: Slumping electronics sales have pushed the world 
semiconductor industry into a mini-recession that is expected to last through 
March, a leading market research company said. Growth in the worldwide 
semiconductor industry is expected to slow to 11% this year and only 1.5% in 
1990, down from a robust 32% in 1988, Dataquest Inc. of San Jose reported in an 
update to its yearly electronics forecast.

Perkin-Elmer May Be Sold to Japanese Firm: Japanese companies are negotiating 
to purchase Perkin-Elmer Corp., one of the last American manufacturers of 
equipment used to make semiconductor chips, the New York Times reports. If the 
sale is completed, it could make the United States largely dependent on Japan 
for such tools. The Times said the Nikon Corp. is considered the leading bidder 
for Perkin-Elmer, whose biggest client is International Business Machines. 
Perkin-Elmer has been unsuccessful in finding an American buyer.

OPEC Ministers at Impasse: OPEC is at an impasse and loosely split into two 
camps over how to meet demands from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates for 
bigger shares of the cartel's production pie, sources said as OPEC continues 
its meeting in Vienna, Austria. The ministers from the 13 Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries were expected to resume negotiations in small 
groups, perhaps today, aimed at reaching an oil production and price agreement 
for the first half of 1990. Lack of agreement could send crude prices tumbling 
to as low as $15 a barrel in the first quarter of 1990, said one ministerial 
source.

When Sogei Inc., a Japanese advertising agency, wanted to shoot a dog food 
commercial, it spared no time or expense. It sought out Victor Haboush, the 
king of directors of animal commercials (Kibbles 'n Bits and Tender Chops dog 
foods), hired some the best performing dogs in Los Angeles and spent five days 
on location on the beaches in Malibu and the Disney Ranch in Placerita Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The result: a series of 30-second TV commercials, showing only in Japan, for 
Vita-1, a Japanese brand of dry dog food. Until recently, the Japanese fed 
table scraps to their pets, according to Gary Omura, vice president and 
executive producer at A. T. &amp; Cosmo, a Los Angeles production company. "The 
concept of buying pet food at supermarket is new . . . nobody knew how to 
direct dogs in Japan because they never had an (pet food) industry before." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to shooting television commercials, it is at least one instance 
when the Japanese still look to the United States for its expertise in film, 
special effects and talent. The Vita-1 spot is one of hundreds of Japanese TV 
commercials that are shot somewhere in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese advertisers are plopping down their yen to shoot products from 
cosmetics to cars against backdrops that range from Death Valley to the subways 
of New York. "The Japanese like to have American locations," explained Haboush. 
"They are not trying to imitate Japan." 
</P>
<P>
Today, as many as a dozen production companies such as A. T. &amp; Cosmo, 
Chiari Cook Co., Unix Enterprises and Lumination -- mostly in the Los Angeles 
area -- are specializing in shooting commercials for Japanese clients. Business 
rose significantly a few years ago when the yen fell against the dollar, making 
it cheaper for Japanese directors and ad executives to come to the United 
States for commercial shoots. 
</P>
<P>
The volume of production work shot in the United States by Japan's two biggest 
advertising agencies -- Dentsu and Hakuhodo -- alone runs in the tens of 
millions of dollars a year. The cost of an average shoot is about $100,000, but 
can rise to $1 million with the use of special effects or celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
Dentsu Inc., Japan's largest ad agency, spends about $20 million to $30 million 
annually on shooting about 100 commercials in the United States, according to 
Takashi Nakamura, president of Dentsu Los Angeles. Hakuhodo shot 24 commercials 
in past six months, spending about $7 million on U.S. productions. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one way we are getting some of the money back from Japan," said Jared 
Cook, whose 5-year-old production company, Chiari Cook Co., operates in Culver 
City. 
</P>
<P>
As Japanese consumers become more sophisticated and worldly, advertisers have 
to work harder to grab their attention. "If you see the same type of commercial 
over and over on the domestic monitor (TV), you get kind of fed up and go to 
kitchen and make sandwich," explained Yuzo Takagi of Unix Enterprises, who 
arranged the first Japanese commercial shot in the United States for Fuji Film 
in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to lose attention from the monitor," he added. "To do so, we 
have to show something different -- different scenery, different people, 
different animals -- different things to keep the people's eye on the monitor. 
The United States was always a popular country in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
Takagi said Japanese ad agencies are now looking to locations in Africa, 
Europe, Australia and New Zealand and the Soviet Union. "Japan is a small 
country, good locations have been used and overused so they are looking at wide 
open spaces," explained Omura, a former operations manager for Northwest 
Airlines who went into the production business 10 years ago. "It is easier to 
shoot here because of the way everything is set up -- Hollywood being the film 
capital of the world. . . . You can never shoot a Japanese car commercial on 
streets of Tokyo because it is too busy. It is easier get a permit to drive a 
Toyota down Rodeo Drive or Sunset Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
Helicopters are also easier to charter in the United States. Japanese viewers 
also like to see deserts (there are none in Japan) and California homes with 
ocean views and pools. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to talent, "Japanese are always looking for exotic talent, 
meaning non-Japanese talent," which is easily available in the United States, 
explained Omura. Unix, for example, was one of the first to use American 
celebrities such as the late Steve McQueen in Japanese commercials. One 
Japanese advertiser even hired an American for his specialization: dancing 
hands. "Why not do it Japan?" asked one production company executive. "They 
said 'Japanese hands are not big enough.' " 
</P>
<P>
When Japanese agencies, including the Tokyo arms of J. Walter Thompson or 
McCann Erickson, shoot commercials in the United States, they usually send a 
director, cameraman and account executive. They hire independent American 
crews, who get the business mostly by word of mouth and by developing business 
relationships that are almost familial in their loyalty and continued 
patronage. The ad concept is usually developed in Japan with input from the 
U.S. production companies. All post-production work is done in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The assignments are varied to say the least. Chiari Cook has shot giant cups 
and saucers in the middle of desert for Fuji Film. They once tried water skiing 
elephants for a Matsushita Electronics commercial, "it didn't work," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
One assignment took the crew on a nocturnal watch to Oregon for a week for a 
shot of an owl that turns its head 360 degrees. "We got about a 270-degree 
turn," recalled Cook, who was doing a commercial for a brand of videocassette 
recorder sold only in Japan. "Another commercial for a Japanese soft drink 
called Mets involved having bicycle messengers riding across roofs of cars in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"The most expensive thing we ever did, a commercial for Toyota, was to build a 
water fountain in front the Pacific Design Center," Cook said. "Then we decided 
we didn't want the Pacific Design Center and we moved (the fountain) in front 
to the Biltmore when there was a parking lot there. It required a lot of art 
direction and money for the fountain." 
</P>
<P>
Americana themes, such as cowboys and Huck Finn are popular. One Japanese 
noodle maker invested the time and expense of going to Kentucky and building a 
raft to recreate a campaign around the popular Mark Twain character. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, location is less important than Hollywood expertise. One 
commercial shoot for Mazda involved one car and a sound stage, but cost 
$700,000. The shot required a tremendous amount of special lighting -- lights 
were shipped in from as far as England and the Philippines. The commercial 
simply showed the car fully illuminated by the special lights. 
</P>
<P>
When Haboush went on loan from Paramount Image to do the Vita-1 commercials, 
his cast of dogs included a Dalmatian, Jack Russell terriers, bulldogs, 
foxhounds, beagles and even a mutt. Working with a Japanese director who had 
never filmed animals, Haboush shot the animals frolicking in the surf at 
Malibu, tumbling out of a truck and playing in a lake. The scenes were used 
with a voice-over in Japanese talking about the dog food.

Los Angeles has the nation's second-largest apparel industry, trailing only New 
York's. However, the typical garment maker in Los Angeles is smaller than its 
cousins in the nation's other major clothing centers -- New York, New Jersey 
and Alabama, according to a report on the industry by the Los Angeles Area 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the smaller size: "Los Angeles firms are (more) 
fashion-oriented, produce small runs and tend to make frequent use of 
contractors, who in turn are fairly small establishments," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Job growth in the Los Angeles apparel and textile industries, steady over much 
of the past decade, is expected to be healthy over the next five years. The 
industries produced 107,520 jobs in 1985. This figure is expected to rise to 
122,150 jobs by 1995, an increase of more than 13%, according to the California 
Department of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
When the jobs in the three related businesses -- garment manufacturing, 
clothing wholesaling and textile weaving -- are combined, the industries 
account for 117,800 jobs in Los Angeles County, according to the Los Angeles 
Area Chamber of Commerce. Only aerospace accounts for more manufacturing jobs 
in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Operators of a Japanese joint venture hope to get a financial foothold in the 
California garment industry. The joint venture firm -- formed by Nisshinbo 
Industries, a major textile maker and Kanematsu-Gosho, a trading company -- has 
constructed a $65-million textile mill in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
The plant, which will employ about 150 people, will produce a cotton weave 
fabric when it goes into full production next January. Plant executives hope to 
sell a major portion of its textile products to garment makers in the Los 
Angeles area.

HIGH COST OF L.A. PLANT SPACE IS DRIVING MANY GARMENT MANUFACTURERS TO CITIES 
SUCH AS VERNON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

When Bethlehem Steel closed its plant in Vernon in 1982, it was widely 
acknowledged to be a major sign of the decline of heavy manufacturing in 
communities located just southeast of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The plant closing was a special blow to Vernon, which borders Los Angeles along 
Alameda and 25th streets. After all, Vernon was founded in 1905 solely to 
foster industry, and the city's administrators have long held high the 
community's motto -- "Exclusively Industrial." 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the steel plant closing and the shutdown of other heavy 
manufacturing operations, Vernon's administrators stepped up efforts to lure 
garment makers and other firm involved in light manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon had only about 20 garment firms in the wake of the Bethlehem Steel 
closing. However, leasing agents at real estate firms considered Vernon's 
proximity to Los Angeles' burgeoning garment industry to be a selling point. 
Seeing an opportunity, agents began to lead some fashioners of cloth to wide 
open spaces in Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
What has happened since is a riches-in-rags story. Vernon now has more than 100 
garment industry firms, an increase of about 400% since 1983. Garment makers 
have brought at least 10,000 new jobs along with their stitching machines over 
that six-year period, a significant increase in a city with only about 45,000 
private sector jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging this initial movement and citing economic factors such as the 
rising cost of land in downtown Los Angeles, industry analysts and real estate 
mavens are now predicting that larger numbers of clothing manufacturers will 
head to small communities immediately south of Los Angeles. Some industry 
observers, noting that the face of downtown is changing, forecast even more 
change in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, is 
among those monitoring the changes. Kyser says manufacturers of garments and 
the contractors that help assemble clothing are willing to consider a move to 
Vernon because it is close to the garment district in downtown Los Angeles and 
near the home of many garment workers -- communities such as East Los Angeles, 
Huntington Park and Southgate. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been tracking this for two or three years and we're seeing a definite 
movement to Vernon and the City of Commerce," Kyser said. "Over the next 10 
years we will see more changes as they (apparel producers) . . . continue to 
slide south." 
</P>
<P>
In a recently published study of the migration, Kyser concluded that many 
clothing manufacturers are leaving the south and east edge of downtown Los 
Angeles. Clothing makers with operations in those areas accounted for 42% of 
the total garment-related employment in Los Angeles County in 1986, compared to 
a 48% share in 1984, according to the study. As of 1986, there were a total of 
36,643 garment workers in those parts of the downtown area, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of an effort to lure more garment industry firms to Vernon, one 
developer -- Trammell Crow Co. -- last month opened a new industrial park 
there. The $38-million facility, dubbed Vernon Business Park, contains 14 
buildings and about 670,000 square feet of industrial space. 
</P>
<P>
Developers are willing to build projects in Vernon and target the garment 
industry because some garment company executives now feel they do not have to 
operate in the heart of Los Angeles' garment district to be successful, said 
Christopher Ludeman, a senior sales consultant in the commercial real estate 
division at the Los Angeles offices of Coldwell Banker. Traditionally, garment 
makers have been concentrated in an area bordered by Jefferson Boulevard on the 
south, Grand Avenue on the west, 8th Street on the north and by the 
intersection of Alameda Street and Washington Boulevard on the east. 
</P>
<P>
"Nine years ago, garment makers wouldn't consider going beyond Washington 
Boulevard," Ludeman said. "They were afraid to get away from the core of the 
garment district." 
</P>
<P>
The increasingly popular Vernon landscape is a relatively treeless sprawl of 
square buildings with an obvious major asset -- space. 
</P>
<P>
For Anthony Jeremiah, secretary-treasurer at Swede Sportswear, space was an 
important consideration. Swede, which produces women's sportswear, had been 
based on Maple Avenue, between Pico Boulevard and 12th Street in the garment 
district, for more than 30 years before moving to several locations in and near 
Vernon over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremiah said the company no longer felt bound to the downtown location when it 
obtained a showroom in CaliforniaMart, an apparel exhibition center that brings 
together clothing-buying executives from retail stores and local garment 
producers. CaliforniaMart, completed in 1964 and located on Los Angeles Street, 
between Olympic Boulevard and 9th Street, has been expanding for the past two 
decades. Groundbreaking for construction of a 1-million-square-foot annex, a 
building for menswear, is scheduled for early 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies have stayed in the garment district partly because it was convenient 
for buyers (for retail stores) to quickly would visit various manufacturers," 
Swede explained. "With the success (of CaliforniaMart), manufacturers don't 
have to be located in one area." 
</P>
<P>
Jeremiah said the company decided to opt for cheaper space in the Vernon area 
partly because his operation was being pinched by the growth of retailing -- 
some of it at outdoor stands -- near his former location. 
</P>
<P>
"The sidewalks are jammed with merchandise," he said. "Parking was a problem. 
Between the parking problem and the heavy traffic, we felt squeezed." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts at the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce have also detected 
changes. For example, they cite the transformation of the Cooper Building at 
860 S. Los Angeles St.; once a center of garment making, the Cooper Building 
became a clothing retail center by the early 1980s. Santee Street near Olympic 
Boulevard is another notable example, observers say. Retailers set up shop 
along Santee several years ago and now operate cheek-by-jowl with clothing 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
As garment retailers envelop areas once considered manufacturing preserves, the 
competition for space heats up, according to real estate analysts. Analysts 
also say demand for space in the garment district has increased because 
apparel-making -- the industry in Los Angeles County generates $6 billion in 
annual sales -- has grown steadily. There are about 3,000 garment makers in Los 
Angeles County and an equal number of contractors in the county. In contrast, 
there were about 2,400 manufacturers and about the same number of clothing 
contractors in the county in 1982, according to state records. 
</P>
<P>
The demand has contributed to rising rents downtown, according to Coldwell 
Banker. On a monthly basis, downtown space rents for 45 cents to 64 cents per 
square foot per month, compared to 36 cents to 38 cents per square foot in 
Vernon and 36 cents to 40 cents per square foot in the neighboring City of 
Commerce, the company said. Property sells for $30 to $100 per square foot in 
downtown Los Angeles, compared to $15 to $18 per square foot in Vernon and $15 
to $20 per square foot in Commerce, according to Coldwell Banker. 
</P>
<P>
For Bernard Lax, president of Louie Bernard Inc., the cost of space was a major 
factor in the decision to move from Los Angeles to Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
"The square foot price for garment manufacturing space (in Los Angeles) has 
become prohibitive," said Lax, who produces women's sportswear and clothing for 
boys and girls. 
</P>
<P>
Lax, who relocated in 1987, said he was initially reluctant to move. 
</P>
<P>
However, many garment company executives review the pros and cons of a move 
from Los Angeles to neighboring communities like Vernon and decide to remain in 
the garment district. For example, Monarch Knit &amp; Sportswear President 
Sheldon Goldman shopped for space in areas southeast of Los Angeles and decided 
to stay in the garment district. He said prices in those neighboring 
communities have been rising rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
"Prices are getting as high as in L.A.," Goldman said. "It's convenient here. I 
live in L.A. . . . All of our suppliers are in L.A. The contractors and dye 
operations are all within five minutes of us." 
</P>
<P>
While many executives choose to stay in Los Angeles, some leasing agents and a 
number of Vernon officials are gearing up sales pitches for garment makers 
prepared to make a move. Lately, officials at the Vernon Chamber of Commerce 
are touting the new Vernon Business Park. 
</P>
<P>
Dolores Petullo, general manager of the Vernon chamber, is quick to note that 
the new industrial park is located on the site once held by Bethlehem Steel 
</P>
<P>
"The plant closing had a tremendous impact on the economy," she said. "Things 
declined gradually after Bethlehem closed. . . . You have to change and adapt. 
If you don't, you're going to be lost."

AN IMPROBABLE ENDING FOR A RECORD EVENING

Ram receiver Henry Ellard knew the hamstring injury he suffered in practice 
Friday was going to keep him out of Sunday night's game against the Saints. 
Willie (Flipper) Anderson knew it too. But the Saints didn't, because the Rams 
listed Ellard as probable. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want it to get public," Anderson explained. "We didn't want them to 
be able to prepare for us not having Henry." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the Saints would have gladly dealt with Ellard. 
</P>
<P>
All Flipper-The-Fill-In did Sunday was catch 15 passes for a National Football 
League single-game record of 336 yards as the Rams rallied for a 20-17 overtime 
victory in the Superdome. Kansas City's Stephone Paige had 309 yards in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I never even dreamed of having a day like this," Anderson said. "Jim (Everett) 
and I just got in this little click, and it was almost unconscious in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of teams have seen me mostly in deep routes all year and they probably 
didn't think I could go across the middle and do those other routes. And it 
probably threw them off that Henry wasn't there because they probably patterned 
their defense around Henry." 
</P>
<P>
If the Saints were unprepared for Anderson's one-man show, it's certainly 
understandable. Anderson, in his second year, won a starting job this season 
when Aaron Cox was a training-camp holdout. But he has been relegated to a role 
as the deep threat while Ellard handled the bulk of the receiving chores. 
</P>
<P>
Ellard has 61 catches for 1,176 yards. Before Sunday night, Anderson had caught 
just 19 passes for 584 yards. He led the team with a 30.7-per-catch average, 
but he was mainly a deep decoy on most downs. 
</P>
<P>
Would it be fair to say that Anderson changed the Rams' offensive plans in one 
night? 
</P>
<P>
Ellard may remain the No. 1 receiver, but certainly Anderson will have 
quarterback Jim Everett looking his way more often from now on. And the Rams' 
play-calling procedure may have, well, flip-flopped in Flipper's favor. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the greatest performance I've ever seen by a wide receiver," Coach John 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson caught nearly every ball thrown in his direction and the only one that 
got away was stolen from his grasp by Saint cornerback Robert Massey, who 
wrenched the ball from a diving Anderson for an interception early in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if there were any I didn't catch," Anderson said. "I'll have to 
look at the films. I'll let you know, because Coach (Ernie) Zampese (the 
offensive coordinator) will let me know." 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. Today will be a day at the movies Anderson won't soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the evening, the Ram offense was thwarted, scoring just three 
points in the first 47 minutes, 13 seconds. But with 2:46 remaining in 
regulation, Buford McGee crossed the goal line to put the Rams within a 
touchdown of tying the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams went 61 yards on five plays to score their first touchdown, 46 of them 
coming on a bomb down the right sideline to Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
A minute and a half later, the Rams tied the game, 17-17, when Anderson pulled 
in his 13th catch of the night, a 15-yard touchdown pass from Everett. This 
time, the Rams had marched 40 yards in five plays, with Anderson picking up 26 
more on a key second-and-32 play. 
</P>
<P>
"I was exhausted until the touchdown pass," Anderson said, managing a smile. 
"But then I got some energy back. It kind of rejuvenated me." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's touchdown reception had much the same effect on the Rams, who were 
teetering on the brink of spending the holidays at home, watching the playoffs 
on television. 
</P>
<P>
Everett hooked up with Anderson again in overtime -- this one for 26 yards on a 
third-and-11 play -- and Mike Lansford kicked a 31-yard field goal to send the 
Rams into a celebration and drop the Saints to their knees in dismay. 
</P>
<P>
"We just tried to open things up and go with three wide receivers and then, 
boom, boom, boom, we were back in it," Everett said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they anticipated Flipper doing anything like this. He just rose 
to the occasion. To tell you the truth, I'm still in shock myself." 
</P>
<P>
The only person in the Superdome who didn't seem surprised was Ellard. 
</P>
<P>
"It couldn't have happened to a better guy," said Ellard, who counseled 
Anderson on how to run his routes throughout the game. "It's great because he 
broke the record of (Paige) who was a college teammate of mine (at Fresno 
State). 
</P>
<P>
"I was glad to help him out. Everything went right. It was his day to shine." 
</P>
<P>
And then Ellard limped off, smiling and shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
The way Anderson sees it, he simply stepped in and stole a record that could 
just as easily have gone to Ellard. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing Henry Ellard's spot and a lot of balls go there in our offense," 
he said. "I never had any doubt in my talent. It was just a matter of getting 
it thrown my way." 
</P>
<P>
Count on Flipper getting the ball flipped his direction a bit more in the 
future.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams, the team you've come to observe with one hand clenched around your 
throat and the other in the medicine cabinet, did it again Sunday night, 
stretching the limits of football absurdity to new lengths with a 20-17 
overtime victory over the New Orleans Saints in the Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
The winners here drove five times inside the Saints' 30 and didn't score, 
committed 10 drive-numbing penalties, had one field goal blocked and another 
from 52 yards tease the left upright before hooking wide as regulation ended; 
spotted their opponent a 14-point lead with 2:46 to go, and caught a great 
break when their star receiver -- the league's yardage leader -- pulled up lame 
and couldn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
These are the Rams: the proud, the few, the excruciating. 
</P>
<P>
Three and a half hours of blood-letting and hair-pulling finally ended after 
Flipper Anderson's 26-yard catch and collapse (from exhaustion) of a Jim 
Everett pass at the Saints' 14. In stepped Saint-killer Mike Lansford -- "If I 
lived here they'd probably kill me" -- who avenged his missed field goal at the 
end of regulation with a 31-yarder to win it with 8:22 remaining in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford knocked the Saints out of the playoffs in 1983 with a game-winner 
here, but returned to the scene this time only as a footnote to Anderson's 
masterpiece of receiving theater, and a last-minute comeback that shook some 
ghosts back in Minnesota and Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope our fans stick in there," said Everett, who rallied his team with 
perhaps the most-overshadowed 454-yard passing performance in football history. 
"We're going to send too many people to the hospital with heart attacks." 
</P>
<P>
As for Anderson, the Rams were hoping he'd step in and pick up the slack for 
the injured Henry Ellard, who was left to watch history-in-the-making after 
pulling a hamstring in Friday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson picked up the slack and ran with it into posterity, breaking the 
National Football League's single-game yardage record with 336 yards on 15 
receptions. Kansas City's Stephone Paige previously held the record with 309 
yards in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Now that's rewriting a Paige in history. 
</P>
<P>
"Amazing, unbelievable," Everett said of Anderson's performance. "I can't 
explain it. I knew he was going to catch everything I threw up there. It was 
Flip's day." 
</P>
<P>
Some teammates were so excited afterward they scrambled for game programs in 
the hopes of getting Anderson's autograph, a keepsake from a night they'll 
never forget. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to tell my kids that I played with Flipper," safety Anthony Newman 
said. And he wasn't kidding. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Coach John Robinson called it the greatest performance from a receiver he'd 
ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, so frail and unimposing you can't image him running that far without 
refueling, made every catch the Rams asked of him. And they were asking a lot. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's 46-yard reception late in the game set up a five-yard Buford McGee 
scoring run to cut the lead to 17-10 with 2:46 left, this after the Rams had 
blown every opportunity imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
When the Rams somehow got the ball back with 2:04 left at the Saints' 40, it 
was Anderson again leading the way. His 14-yard reception with 1:10 left got 
the Rams to the New Orleans' 15. 
</P>
<P>
From there, Everett lofted a pass toward the right corner of the end zone, 
Anderson making the game-tying catch as he skidded past cornerback Robert 
Massey with 1:02 left. 
</P>
<P>
"It just happened," Anderson said of his night. "It really hasn't set in yet." 
</P>
<P>
It was on to overtime, and haunting memories lurked. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Rams (8-4) could lift up their jerseys and present battle scars. 
They took the lead in Minnesota with 28 seconds left and lost in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Larry Kelm grabbed linebacker Kevin Greene before overtime and 
cursed him out in "Remember the Alamo" passion. 
</P>
<P>
"Kelm came up to me and said 'Don't celebrate!' " Greene said later. "He said, 
'We are not going to lose this S.O.B.' " 
</P>
<P>
Everett, who kept firing pass after pass despite the relentless pressure of a 
Saints' pass rush that sacked him six times for 39 yards, explained that the 
pain of tough losses against the Bills and Vikings were motivating forces in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed like talk after the Saints won the toss and started driving as if 
nothing happened at the end of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints ordered the heating up of Morten Andersen's leg on third-and-one at 
the Rams' 45 when an identified flying object was spotted leaping over left 
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
It was linebacker Greene, who, heeding Kelm's earlier plea, leaped into the 
backfield and all but consumed Saints tailback Dalton Hilliard, who was dropped 
for a two-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints were force to punt, the Rams taking over at their own 15. 
</P>
<P>
There, the New Orleans defense, which could not cover Anderson, decided 
tackling him was the only alternative. A 35-yard pass interference penalty on 
Robert Massey freed the Rams from their hole. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Bell ran four yards, Everett threw 14 yards to Anderson to the Saints' 39 
and Lansford wiggled his toes. A holding penalty knocked the Rams back, but 
Everett attacked again, hitting tight end Pete Holohan for eight yards and 
then, finally, Anderson for 26. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, his extraordinary night not yet justified completely by victory, 
latched on to teammate Aaron Cox as Lansford took the field.

Anderson has been through this before. He caught a 78-yard touchdown pass 
against Buffalo in the closing minutes and whooped it up on the sidelines. That 
seemed kind of silly when the Bills rallied to win. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and Aaron celebrated early in Buffalo," Anderson said. "We celebrated in 
Minnesota. This time, we have a big high-five after the game." 
</P>
<P>
Lost in the Anderson moment was Everett, who refused to surrender after all 
hope seemed lost. How many chances should a team get? 
</P>
<P>
On the first play of the third quarter, Greene knocked quarterback Bobby 
Hebert's arm in mid-throw, the ball landing in Shawn Miller's hands at the 16. 
The Rams closed within an inch of the goal line and didn't score after an 
ill-advised third-down pass attempt failed and Lanford's chip-shot field goal 
was blocked by Jim Wilks. 
</P>
<P>
In the third, Buford McGee dropped a possible 30-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Saints' punt returner Rod Harris fumbled at his own 
eight-yard line, but Rams didn't score. Later in the quarter, Bell fumbled at 
the Saints 26. 
</P>
<P>
"It had been tough for us," Everett said. "But this team has guts." 
</P>
<P>
He figured there was always time for miracles. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen it happen against us," he said. "We know it can happen. We'd been 
kicked in the face, had been beaten up." 
</P>
<P>
Not this time. This time the Rams pulled it out, although every game has it's 
price. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got 10 more gray hairs," cornerback LeRoy Irvin said. "Ten. I counted 
them." 
</P>
<P>
The head coach was counting hairs, too. 
</P>
<P>
Said Robinson: "It was the most exciting, happiest and most frustrating game 
I've ever been in. It was a hell of a game." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Receiver Henry Ellard was listed as probable going in, but said afterward there 
was no way he could have played. "It wasn't that close," Ellard said. . . . 
Until the Rams' comeback, Saints back Dalton Hilliard was the star, rushing for 
more than 100 yards (112) for the third consecutive week and throwing a 35-yard 
scoring pass to Eric Martin in the third quarter. In two games against the Rams 
this year, Hilliard has rushed for a touchdown, caught another and thrown for a 
score. . . . Right cornerback Cliff Hicks was knocked from the game with a 
strained right knee. The Rams played the overtime without right tackle Jackie 
Slater, who suffered a chest bruise. . . . Bill Hawkins strained his right 
ankle.

MIKE DOWNEY: TERRY CHANGED COURSE, BUT HE STILL KNOWS HOW TO PITCH 
</P>

Ralph Terry realizes now that you do not always realize the magnitude of what 
you are doing, even while you are doing it. "You go through life real fast, and 
you really don't stop to see what's going on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to play with Roger Maris when he hit 61 home runs. I got to play with 
Mickey Mantle, one of the greatest baseball players who ever lived. I got to 
play for Casey Stengel. I played on seven pennant winners, pitched in five 
World Series. I screwed one up and I won one. That's a lot to happen to one 
guy. 
</P>
<P>
"And now I'm out there playing golf with Arnold Palmer, and pretty soon Big 
Jack (Nicklaus) and Lee (Trevino) will be out there grabbin' some of the gravy, 
and I'll tell you what, it's such a nice feeling to watch these men play and 
not have to buy a ticket," Terry said. "I guess you could say I'm an ambassador 
from one sport to another. 
</P>
<P>
"The poor man's Bo Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Terry, at 53 only five years older than Pete Rose, has been out of 
baseball since 1967. Today he finds himself on the Senior circuit -- no, not 
that baseball league in Florida, but the PGA Senior golf barnstorming troupe. 
Terry will be one of 72 competitors in this week's GTE West Classic at Ojai, 
along with Palmer, Billy Casper and dozens of other distinguished (one-sport) 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, nobody can ever say Terry hasn't spent his life playing with the best. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter-century ago, the poor man's Bo was pitching in his fifth consecutive 
World Series. Two years before, he won 23 times during the season and then 
twice more as Most Valuable Player of the 1962 Series. Seeing as how no New 
York Yankee right-hander had won so many games in one season since 1904, this 
made him a fairly famous fellow for an organization that had already given us 
Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio and the gentleman standing in center field, 
directly behind him, the Mick. 
</P>
<P>
Two years before that, Terry was the man on the mound when Bill Mazeroski of 
the Pittsburgh Pirates propelled into history a World Series homer every bit as 
dramatic as the ones by Carlton Fisk and Kirk Gibson that would follow in years 
to come. Terry much rather would have induced Maz to strike out -- after all, 
since he fanned 1,000 men in his major league lifetime, he definitely knew how. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Terry knew pressure, knew fame, knew hits and misses. 
</P>
<P>
Only now, he's the guy trying to hit the ball -- and there's nobody backing him 
up out there; no Ellie Howard, telling him what to do, or Mantle, chasing down 
his mistakes. Being out there by oneself, as during last year's three-way 
playoff for the final two exempt positions at the Senior tour's national 
qualifying tournament, can humble even a guy who knows what it is like to have 
50,000 customers in a grandstand and millions of television viewers staring 
bug-eyed as he grips a baseball in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
That golf playoff was "as tough as pitching the seventh game of the Series," 
said Terry, who should know. 
</P>
<P>
Although he remains winless on the tour, and last year never placed among the 
top 10 at any event, he does occasionally make appearances on the leader board. 
In August, Terry tied for 10th place at the Showdown Classic in Utah, his best 
finish yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I never fancied myself the next Ben Hogan or anything," Terry said. 
</P>
<P>
When he was 22, a car wreck left the pitcher with a busted left hip. "I had to 
spend the whole winter in traction. It's lucky they didn't have to replace it," 
Terry said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, when 1958's spring training rolled around, I still wasn't 100%. I played 
a little pepper, but couldn't do any running. So a couple of the coaches, who 
were avid golfers, said: 'You want some exercise? Go play golf.' And that 
intrigued me. I'd only been to the driving range, or played, you know, 
putt-putt. Bob Swift and Don Heffner told me to go rent a set of clubs and play 
this public course over in Haines City. 
</P>
<P>
"Before long, I had this nice little duck hook I was really proud of. And I 
stopped hitting grounders. I hate grounders. Some pitchers like 'em, but I hate 
grounders. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, Mickey was always out there playing, and we're both old Oklahoma boys, 
and he and Billy Martin and Tom Sturdevant always bet a lot of money, and they 
needed a fourth. So they started out giving me two shots on the (par) 5s. And 
we keep playing, day after day. And pretty soon I'm getting half a shot on the 
5s." 
</P>
<P>
Terry spent a dozen seasons in the baseball show before permanently changing 
cleats. He hasn't gotten rich from golf. From 1986-88, he earned $66,134 on the 
Senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
"The money they make in baseball now, oh, man," Terry said. "In '56, Mickey was 
the Triple Crown winner. The next year he batted .377. But Ted Williams batted 
something like .388. And Williams was about 40 then and couldn't run. If his 
legs were any good, he probably would have hit .420. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, George Weiss tried to cut Mickey $20,000 -- because he didn't win the 
league batting title. 
</P>
<P>
"Gabe Paul was that way in Cleveland. I roomed with Sam McDowell, when Sam 
struck out 325 men in 280 innings. That was the greatest strikeout percentage 
of all time, at least until Nolan Ryan came along. So I said, 'Sam, you are a 
star, man. You give 'em hell.' 
</P>
<P>
"He ain't in Gabe Paul's office 15 minutes before he comes out. 'What 
happened?' I asked. 'I don't know,' he said. 'I didn't get nothing.' 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I felt the same way, especially when I won 25 games in one year. 
But, some things you do for money, and some things you don't. With golf, I'm 
just grateful they don't kick my butt off the course."

BIG PLAYS 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' Flipper Anderson, who set an NFL record for single-game receiving 
with 336 yards, caught a 26-yard pass to set up Mike Lansford's 31-yard field 
goal 6:38 into overtime. Anderson also set up the Rams' first touchdown with a 
46-yard catch late in the fourth quarter and scored the tying touchdown on a 
15-yard pass play from Jim Everett. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' Kevin Greene stopped running back Dalton Hilliard for a loss on third 
and one to kill New Orleans' first drive of overtime, forcing a punt and 
setting up the Rams' winning drive. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Brown had two interceptions in the final four minutes as Green Bay upset 
Minnesota, 20-19. Brown is the NFL's active interception leader and sixth 
all-time with 59 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Trudeau threw to Bill Brooks on a 25-yard touchdown pass play with 1:54 
left to help Indianapolis beat San Diego, 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
Vinny Testaverde, who completed only 19 of 42 passes for 200 yards and was 
sacked five times, threw to Mark Carrier on a five-yard touchdown pass play 
with 43 seconds left to give Tampa Bay a 14-13 victory over Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders' Jeff Jaeger kicked a 32-yard field goal with 5:57 remaining to 
give the Raiders their 24-21 victory over the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburgh Steelers knocked the Miami Dolphins from first place in the AFC 
East by scoring 34 points in 23 minutes, erasing a 14-0 deficit, thanks in part 
to five Miami turnovers inside the Dolphin 40-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOWLIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
Houston's 34-0 loss to Kansas City was the first time the Oilers were shut out 
since losing 27-0 at San Diego on Dec. 7, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers, the most penalized team in the NFL, set a team record with 16 
penalties for 115 yards, including 50 in the first quarter. They set the old 
record of 14 against Denver on Oct. 6, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle quarterback Kelly Stouffer was sacked four times in the first half as 
Denver built a 38-0 lead on the way to a 41-14 victory. The Broncos sacked 
Stouffer and quarterback Dave Krieg eight times. 
</P>
<P>
A few hundred fans wore black arm bands and there were about 50 hand-made signs 
around the Sun Devil Stadium supporting former Phoenix Coach Gene Stallings, 
who was fired by the Cardinals last week. Only 33,297 watched the game at the 
74,724-seat stadium, the smallest crowd since the Cardinals moved to Phoenix 
from St. Louis in 1988. Tampa Bay beat the Cardinals, 14-13. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Jets broke a five-game losing streak at home with a 27-7 win over 
Atlanta, but the game drew only 40,429 fans with 36,462 no-shows. It was the 
second smallest home crowd for the Jets since they moved to Giants Stadium in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STREAKS 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh beat Miami, 34-14, to end the Dolphins' three-game winning streak. 
The Steelers beat a Don Shula-coached team in Miami for the first time in seven 
tries. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Jets won at home for the first time in five home games with a 27-7 
victory over the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons were the perfect remedy for the Jets' woes. New York had lost five 
consecutive games at home; the Falcons had lost six in a row on the road. The 
Jets broke their string with a 27-7 victory, extending Atlanta's to seven. The 
Falcons are winless on the road this season. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo kicker Scott Norwood ran his string of consecutive extra-point kicks to 
117 and games in which he has scored to 58, a club record, in the Bills' 24-7 
victory over the Bengals. Cincinnati had defeated the Bills the last five times 
the teams had played. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski completed his first 14 passes, finishing 26 
for 35 for 276 yards and two touchdowns, in the Packers' 20-19 victory over the 
Minnesota Vikings. Majkowski has thrown touchdown passes in 14 consecutive 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings were the only NFL team not to allow a 100-yard rusher, receiver or 
300-yard passer before Green Bay's Sterling Sharpe caught 10 passes for 157 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's Anthony Carter caught six passes for 103 yards, giving him 
receptions in 61 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City kicker Nick Lowery kicked four extra points to give him 197 in a 
row, the longest active streak in the league, in the Chiefs' 34-0 victory over 
the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
Miami quarterback Dan Marino, who bruised his ribs last week, hurt his right 
shoulder in the second quarter of the Dolphins' 34-14 loss to Pittsburgh and 
left game late in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Ram cornerback Clifford Hicks was sidelined on the third defensive play with a 
sprained right knee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ditka after his Chicago Bears lost to the Washington Redskins, 38-14, to 
fall one game behind Green Bay and Minnesota in the NFC Central: "There's 
nothing we can do this year. It's over." 
</P>
<P>
More from Ditka: "I refuse to stand back and give credit to the other people 
because we are absolutely an atrocious football team right now. It's a dark day 
for this organization. It was the worst exhibition of football I've ever seen 
in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Said New York Jet defensive end Ron Stallworth, after the Jets defeated the 
Atlanta Falcons, 27-7: "It's nice to get a win anywhere, against anybody, with 
the kind of year we've had." 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh quarterback Bubby Brister, whose team routed the Dolphins, 34-14, in 
a rain-soaked game at Miami: "We practice in rain and snow in Pittsburgh all 
the time. We don't go to an indoor facility. Coach just says get your butt out 
there and practice, so the weather didn't bother us any." 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh running back Tim Worley: "We came back, and when we got on top, the 
Miami guys just quit." 
</P>
<P>
Dolphin linebacker Barry Krauss: "We just washed away with the rain." 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski, who played despite sore ribs and completed 
26 of 35 passes for 276 yards and two touchdowns in the Packers' 20-19 victory 
over the Vikings: "A good tape job secured my ribs. I couldn't practice (during 
the week) because of a lot of pain. But I had the adrenalin going right before 
the game. I wasn't even sure I'd start until right before I started warming 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay quarterback Vinny Testaverde, telling his Buccanneer teammates about 
his five interceptions in the 1987 Fiesta Bowl at Sun Devil Stadium: "I told 
the guys in the huddle, 'Hey, I was here three years ago and I lost. Today will 
be a different outcome.' After I said that, the guys told me later on they got 
chills."

</P>
<P>
Seattle's Steve Largent scored on a 31-yard pass play from Dave Krieg in the

</P>
<P>
Denver (10-2) joined the 1988 Buffalo Bills as the only AFC teams to clinch 
division titles after 12 games of a 16-game season. It was Denver's fourth

</P>
<P>
Cincinnati's James Brooks ran for 105 yards in 20 carries in the Bengals' 24-7

<P>
Christian Okoye of Kansas City gained 67 yards against Houston, raising his

ran for 1,121 in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's Art Monk had nine catches for 152 yards and two touchdowns in the

<P>
TONIGHT'S GAME 
</P>
<P>
New York Giants at San Francisco, 6 p.m. -- As quarterback Phil Simms of the 
New York Giants must know, some old quotes can't haunt you. They are posted in 
the locker rooms of teams looking forward to their next game against you. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, it's the San Francisco 49ers, the Giants' opponent tonight in a 
game matching division leaders with 9-2 records, best in the NFC. The Giants' 
hopes of reaching the playoffs last year died on the final Sunday of the season 
when the Rams took the last available NFC wild-card spot with a 38-16 victory 
over the 49ers. Simms was quoted as saying the 49ers "laid down like dogs." 
</P>
<P>
He's sure to have jeering fans, reminding him of his 11-month-old comment 
tonight at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, who were assured of the NFC West title before their final game, went 
on to win their third NFL title under coach Bill Walsh, who retired after the 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
George Seifert, who replaced Walsh, has the league's top-ranked offense, one 
led by passing leader Joe Montana and receiving star Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, the two-time Super Bowl most valuable player, went over the 
30,000-yard mark for his career last week. He has 19 touchdown passes and only 
four interceptions. Rice, the Super Bowl most valuable player last January, has 
14 touchdowns and 1,149 yards on his 1989 catches and receiving totals of 63 
touchdowns and 6,030 yards in his five pro seasons.

NEWSWIRE: ROSEN, JACKET ELECTED AS OLYMPIC COACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mel Rosen of Auburn University and Barbara Jacket of Prairie View A&amp;M were 
elected coaches of the U.S. men's and women's track and field teams for the 
1992 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
The International Competition Committee of The Athletics Congress, meeting 
Sunday, the day before the official start of TAC's annual convention, elected 
the U.S. staffs for three major events. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1984 L.A. Olympics, Rosen was an assistant coach, handling the 
sprinters, hurdlers and relay teams. His athletes won 13 medals, including 
seven golds, and set one world record. 
</P>
<P>
He also was men's head coach of the 1987 U.S. World Championship team and is 
chairman of TAC's Men's Track and Field Committee. 
</P>
<P>
He has coached more than 125 All-American athletes, including 62 Southeastern 
Conference outdoor and 58 indoor champions. His dual meet record is 92-27. 
</P>
<P>
Jacket, 53, who started the women's track and field program at Prairie View 
A&amp;M in 1966, has guided the Lady Panthers to the last eight NAIA outdoor 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tom Tellez of the University of Houston, who coached the 1987 men's 
Pan American Games team, was named coach of the 1991 World Championship team, 
and Joe Vigil of Adams State (Colo.) was elected coach of the 1991 men's Pan 
American Games squad. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Rodda, an assistant women's coach on the 1988 Olympic team and head of the 
Nike Coast Track Club in Long Beach, was chosen coach of the women's 1991 World 
Championship team, and Dorothy Doolittle of the University of Tennessee was 
selected coach of the women's 1991 Pan American Games team.

<P>
Arlyn Bowers didn't score a point for ninth-ranked Arkansas, but according to 
Coach Nolan Richardson, he was the main reason the Razorbacks beat Oregon, 
102-75, Sunday at Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers played 10 minutes and missed all three of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Arlyn Bowers picked up our defensive intensity," Richardson said after a 
couple of scoring spurts by Lee Mayberry helped the Razorbacks get by the 
Ducks. "They took our intensity away by spreading the floor and trying to lull 
us to sleep, but Arlyn took care of that." 
</P>
<P>
Mayberry scored 10 in the opening minutes and another eight during a 
second-half run. Mayberry's initial scoring outburst -- including two 
three-point baskets -- gave the Razorbacks a 27-10 lead with 14:20 left in the 
first half. Oregon trailed by 12 at the half and closed to 60-53 with 13 
minutes left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Miller started a 37-9 Razorback run with a short jump shot and then 
blocked a shot that led to a Mayberry basket. Mayberry made a three-point shot 
and then fed Lenzie Howell for a basket and a 69-53 lead with 11:20 left. 
Mayberry's three-point basket made it 76-60, and it was 97-62 when the run 
ended with four minutes remaining.

TWO LA VERNE PLAYERS INJURED IN CRASH

<TEXT>
<P>
Two men's basketball players from the University of La Verne were seriously 
injured, one critically, in an auto accident on the Pomona Freeway Sunday 
morning in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Schroeder, a junior, and Andre Purry, a senior, were injured when Purry 
apparently lost control of his car on a rain-soaked portion of the highway. It 
skidded into the center divider and careened into an embankment. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, a passenger in the car, was taken to San Antonio Community Hospital 
in Upland, where a spokesman said he is in critical condition with head 
injuries. Purry was listed in serious but stable condition at Ontario Community 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Roland Ortmayer, athletic director at La Verne, said Schroeder suffered massive 
head injuries. He said Purry apparently has a spinal injury, although "they 
don't think there's any paralysis." 
</P>
<P>
The players had been returning from a basketball tournament at UC San Diego in 
La Jolla, where La Verne had competed Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer said the shock of the accident was starting to settle on the school. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a very, very tough situation," he said. "We're dealing with our 
psychologists to help the coaches and team members as much as possible. We 
can't do anything about the tragedy, but we're trying to deal with the 
psychological aspects as best as we can." 
</P>
<P>
Both players are transfers from NCAA Division I schools. Purry, a 6-foot-6 
forward who has been among La Verne's leading scorers, played at Cal State Long 
Beach and was an All-CIF Southern Section selection at Long Beach Poly High. 
Schroeder, a 6-3 guard, transferred from the University of Minnesota.

A LOT OF GOLF LEFT IN CHARLES; 
</P>
<P>
SENIOR GOLF: PLAYING AS WELL AS EVER AT THE AGE OF 53, HE CAN WRAP UP ANOTHER 
MONEY TITLE WITH A WIN AT OJAI THIS WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When Bob Charles joined the PGA Tour in 1962 he had two strikes against him. 
First, he came from New Zealand, a country more famous for producing sheep than 
golfers. Even worse, he was a left-hander in a game dominated by right-handers. 
</P>
<P>
Charles overcame both obstacles. Not only did he become the first left-hander 
to win a tour event, he made his country golf conscious while he earned fame 
and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Now 53, Charles is not just the best left-hander ever to play the game, he is 
the best player on the Senior PGA Tour. Already this year he has won more money 
than he did during 15 years on the regular tour. 
</P>
<P>
He will attempt to make the $350,000 GTE Classic, which will be played at Ojai 
Valley Inn and Country Club starting Thursday, his fifth victory of the year 
and a virtual lock on his second consecutive money title. 
</P>
<P>
"I've already played 32 tournaments," Charles said. "I'm tired. When Orville 
Moody made his move to catch me, I had to come back from New Zealand and start 
to play again. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a chance to win back-to-back titles. The chances are I won't have that 
chance again. Some of the greats of golf, including Jack Nicklaus and Lee 
Trevino, will soon be eligible. I just have to forget that I'm tired. It scares 
me to do battle with Orville. He's a tough competitor." 
</P>
<P>
Charles, who won four tournaments on the PGA Tour and dozens more around the 
world, including the 1963 British Open, earned $539,118 in tour money. 
</P>
<P>
In setting a senior record last year, Charles earned $533,929. Both Charles 
($592,396) and Moody ($577,285) have broken that record this season. 
</P>
<P>
After the Ojai event, there is one tournament remaining, at Kaanapali in Hawaii 
where Trevino may make his debut with the 50 and older set. 
</P>
<P>
Charles led the money list by only $152 when he rushed back to play at Las 
Vegas Nov. 10-12. He finished in a three-way tie for first, but after losing 
the playoff to Charles Coody, he had a $15,111 lead over Moody. A victory at 
Ojai might clinch the title. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't the money," said Moody, who has been battling a back problem. 
"Neither one of us needs the money. It's just the competition. When you get 
this close to being No. 1, you want to be No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"The back is getting better and I should be ready to make a run at No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
The money champion will receive a $112,500 bonus from Nabisco. He will also win 
golfer of the year honors. It is fitting that these two are battling it out. 
</P>
<P>
Moody and Charles dominate the statistics. Moody is the all-round leader, 
although he does not lead in any statistic. Charles has the best scoring 
average (69.76), and also leads in par breakers and putting. 
</P>
<P>
Moody, always one of the game's top shotmakers, was once one of the golf's 
worst putters. But now he is a close second to Charles. The turnaround came 
when Moody started using the long-handled putter. The pendulum swing has 
enabled him to conquer a lifetime of yips. 
</P>
<P>
When he won the U.S. Senior Open in June, Moody credited the long putter and 
his daughter/caddy Michele, who helped him read the putts. 
</P>
<P>
In other years Michele has caddied for her father only during the summer. In 
the fall she has gone back to school. Not this time. Instead of entering 
college she is still caddying. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about it, Moody said, "I don't know what she can learn in college 
that will enable her to earn $75,000 a year." 
</P>
<P>
By the time he became eligible for the seniors in March, 1986, he was spending 
more time driving a tractor on his ranch in New Zealand. His last victory had 
been in 1978 in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no thought of ever playing again, except for fun," Charles said. "But 
when it became obvious the new tour would be a success, I started getting 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
"I had always stayed in shape, so the only problem was how I would react to 
playing competitively. That didn't prove to be a problem and here I am playing 
more than I ever did on the regular tour. I think that has something to do with 
why I drive the ball farther than I did 25 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Ojai doesn't figure to be a two-man battle. All the top money winners for this 
year except Gary Player will be on hand. Player will be in South Africa until 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Coody, who won his first senior event at Las Vegas, defending champion Harold 
Henning (he won at Wood Ranch), Chi Chi Rodriguez, Al Geiberger, Dave Hill, 
Miller Barber and Larry Mowry are also in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Although he hasn't won a tournament this year, Arnold Palmer will also be 
there. Palmer's presence assures a tournament that the fans will be there. 
Trevino will be 50 one day before the end of the tournament. According to the 
rules, a golfer, to be eligible, must reach 50 on the Tuesday before the 
tournament opens.

Secret Harmonies by Andrea Barrett (Delacorte Press: $16.95; 256 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Here are 10 interlocking short stories (and a prelude) that function as a 
novel. The location is described exactly: " . . . that pocket of land halfway 
between the Berkshires and the Connecticut Valley but part of neither . . . a 
triangle of weirdness worth exploring." The characters, too, are set out with 
meticulous care. Among a whole flock of kids who roam this northern swamp, Reba 
Dwyer is a middle child in a family of three children. Hank, her elder brother, 
is timid and care-taking; Tonia, her younger sister, has a mild case of Down's 
syndrome, but will grow up to hold a job, and write surprisingly good poetry. 
</P>
<P>
The Dwyers' life is informed by two sources of conflict and sorrow: (1) There 
is absolutely no money; this is Eugene O'Neill country, where there's no way at 
all to make a living; and (2) The elder Dwyers -- Magda and Bowen -- are 
totally incompatible, and neither one of them, as the kids are growing up, get 
to do what they want. Thus, Magda, who should be keeping the house clean and 
making meat loaf, pretty much ignores the kids and messes wistfully instead 
with machinery. She wants to fix things -- not be a housewife. 
</P>
<P>
And Bowen, having returned from a war to take advantage of the GI Bill, has 
studied music and fallen in love with it, but he can't make a living making 
music in the tiny town of Rockledge. He ends up leaving the church choir and 
raising filthy, sickly chickens on a bleak farm he's inherited from his father. 
Bowen hates his life, and stays drunk half the time to maintain some distance 
from the facts of his life. The result in the Dwyer household is pure chaos. 
Thinking about it later, Reba will reminder: "We grew up like dogs. . . . Nice 
dogs ruined by bad training." 
</P>
<P>
But on another level, Magda is teaching her children common sense and 
self-reliance, and Bowen teaches Reba everything he knows about music theory, 
enough so that she can get a scholarship and go for one year to music school. 
Reba is a "genius," or at least a person who was born to live her life through 
art, but the author here, after having skillfully set up this chaotic, rural 
childhood, changes the focus of these stories: Life can be set on a triangular 
grid, she seems to be saying, and you can live in just one corner of that 
cosmic triangle. You can live the necessary but unexciting life of family and 
reproduction. Reba's young husband, her childhood sweetheart, Luke, wants no 
more than that. You can live a life of total isolation and independence. 
</P>
<P>
Reba's father, Bowen, picks up and simply leaves as soon as his chickens die, 
communicating with his family by post cards that he doesn't bother to sign (but 
we're to understand he's lonely). You also can live the life of the committed, 
dedicated artist, but, again, the author's position is that this life precludes 
the consolations of love, stability and family. Early on, before she's married, 
Reba takes up with a wild girl from high school. They pick up endless men, 
smoke incredible amounts of hash, drink innumerable cups of coffee, finish off 
with packs of cigarettes, and then do their very best singing in the church 
choir. When Reba marries, she loses her singing voice in the fourth month of 
pregnancy -- just about when the babies "quicken." But Reba's babies die; the 
implication is that she's just not "made" to be a mother. 
</P>
<P>
Reba, in her stable marriage, suffers terminal boredom. She has to get out of 
Rockledge; she needs to express herself artistically. She takes piano lessons; 
that's not her instrument. She collects a string of generically caddish lovers 
(the weakest part of the book, since these poor guys never come alive, but only 
serve to show Reba what she doesn't need). Is there a way for Reba to claim her 
family, accept the chaos she's come from, and still find her true calling, and 
function as an artist? The answer comes in the title, "Secret Harmonies," and a 
chain letter promising good fortune that weaves its way through the book. . . . 
</P>
<P>
These are thoughtful stories, and some of them are remarkably touching. But 
womanizers should pass on this, for their own piece of mind.

SAN FRANCISCO'S 'ORLANDO FURIOSO' IS TEDIOSO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It looks and sounds all too familiar. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Horne, mezzo-coloratura assoluta, struts about the stage in ornate 
high-heeled drag. She pretends to be a semi-mythological warrior-hero. Her 
vehicle this time happens to be Vivaldi's "Orlando Furioso," anno 1727, but it 
could be any number of related 18th-Century exercises. 
</P>
<P>
The diva models a silly plumed helmet and trails a mile-long cape. She gurgles 
and roars her mellifluous way through mile-long da-capo arias that dip and soar 
and curl and cackle with infinite convolution yet go nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
In Horne's best vocal days, one didn't have to love the style to appreciate the 
virtuosity. Those days, alas, seem to be drawing to a close. 
</P>
<P>
At the War Memorial Opera House on Friday, her technique still seemed 
extraordinary. Unfortunately, the tone at her command tended toward the harsh 
if not the threadbare. 
</P>
<P>
The new production by the San Francisco Opera relies, after a fashion, on the 
critical edition of Ulysses Roseman Jr. Mercifully, the musical sprawl is 
reduced from 83 numbers to 61. Still, the performance lasts nearly 3 1/2 hours. 
Tedium triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
In the last act, Horne interpolates an extended excerpt from an unrelated 
Vivaldi cantata -- "Fonti di pianto." This tragic digression jolts the mood, 
literally disrupts a rather bizarre mad scene, and adds one more pointless 
showpiece to an evening already overloaded with pointless showpieces. 
</P>
<P>
Vivaldi apparently cranked out more than 90 operas in his lifetime. He produced 
arias much as a good butcher produces sausages. He was a professional and a 
utilitarian. 
</P>
<P>
His melodic and harmonic formulas reveal few surprises. Little in "Orlando" 
suggests illumination, much less inspiration. Poor Ariosto. 
</P>
<P>
Terence McEwen, the former general director of the San Francisco Opera, 
obviously planned this production as yet another esoteric indulgence for Horne. 
It turned out to be a costly, and not particularly flattering, indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
It also turned out to be an indulgence plagued with misfortune. Both Sir John 
Pritchard, the intended conductor, and Pier Luigi Pizzi, the original director, 
fell ill prior to opening night. Randall Behr, who had canceled "La Rondine" in 
Long Beach to attend rehearsals here, ultimately took over Pritchard's baton. 
Ugo Tessitore, the sorcerer's backstage apprentice, assumed responsibility for 
Pizzi's staging scheme. 
</P>
<P>
The stilted music fared better than the stilted drama. Behr kept the chamber 
orchestra chugging along nicely, and accompanied his singers with sympathetic 
elan. 
</P>
<P>
Tessitore could do nothing to make Pizzi's awkward stylizations seem natural. 
Nor could he make the mannered maneuvers look anything but predictable, which 
is bad, and silly, which is worse. Adding scenic injury to theatrical insult, 
Pizzi's slick, precious, white-on-black decors explored new frontiers of cutesy 
neo-Baroque chic. 
</P>
<P>
The cast mustn't be blamed for any of this. Everyone worked bravely. Everyone 
performed stock gestures and tired rituals resourcefully, under trying 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Patterson actually sang radiantly as the unangelic Angelica, princess of 
Cathay. William Matteuzzi introduced a fine Italianate bel-canto tenor in the 
thankless duties of Medoro. Kathleen Kuhlmann mustered appropriate sorcery as 
the bewitching, if subdued, Alcina. Sandra Walker's gutsy contralto proved 
useful as Bradamante, and Kevin Langan was his old sonorous self as the 
knightly basso, Astolfo. Jeffrey Gall did his strident best to validate the 
confused passions of Ruggiero, even though the castrato challenge inevitably 
lost something in countertenor translation. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the audience stayed to the long-delayed end. Some even stayed awake. It 
was a considerable achievement.

AMBITIOUS EXHIBITS DEMONSTRATE MOCA SPREADS ITSELF TOO THIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Museum of Contemporary Art presents a pair of exhibitions that try to do 
too many things at once. The smaller -- and by far the more interesting -- is 
"Selections from the Beatrice and Philip Gersh Collection." The big one is a 
sprawling and only occasionally coherent shuffling of some 150 works from the 
permanent collection called "Constructing a History." It would be more aptly 
titled "Deconstructing History." 
</P>
<P>
Both shows are housed in MOCA's California Plaza headquarters on Bunker Hill. 
They derive graceful authority from architect Arta Isozaki's galleries and a 
crisply professional installation. If the cosmetics are a hit, the content is 
another matter. 
</P>
<P>
The Gersh material stands up nicely. The couple are veteran Los Angeles art 
patrons who have collected for some 30 years. She is a MOCA trustee and both 
have been active at the old Pasadena Art Museum and the County Museum of Art. 
They have donated and promised works to MOCA including a small Jackson Pollock 
and Susan Rothenberg's spooky "Black Dress." 
</P>
<P>
Their collection skips through the history of modern art from a small 1912 
Kandinsky to Ed Rusha's recent "Picture H House" which represents his welcome 
return to the use of images after a long siege of pure wordworks. The 45 
examples (on view through March 11) admirably combine objects of unpretentious 
domestic scale with a keen eye for excellence. Aside from a slightly 
indifferent Frank Stella -- "The Whiteness of the Whale" -- virtually 
everything is of museum quality. They also reveal a knack that museums often 
funk in their quest for boffo impressiveness by the yard. The Gershes know how 
to distill. 
</P>
<P>
The most striking quality here is in the number of works so small as to 
approach miniature scale while capturing the essence of the artist. Francis 
Bacon's "Portrait of a Man With Glasses" packs all his essential Pinteresque 
vision of everyday horror into a canvas about one foot square. From 1963 -- the 
period before Bacon started doing impersonations of himself -- it compresses 
his talent for painting a face that vacillates between old-master solidity and 
the scattered terror of a mind coming unglued. 
</P>
<P>
The Gersh nose for condensation sniffs out the right stuff in everything from 
Giacometti's poignantly dignified 23-inch "Bust of a Man" through de Kooning's 
1949 pastel "Two Women" and on to Joel Shapiro's foot-tall bronze block-man. It 
expands the surrounding gallery space into an immense hall where a cabinet-size 
painting looks like a vast billboard. A very amusing and unusually good work by 
Jenny Holzer sits nearby. It is a marble bench carved with ironic modern 
truisms like "Government is a Burden on the People." Near the Shapiro it 
becomes a marble temple. 
</P>
<P>
It's a nourishing aesthetic experience only diluted by a barely disguised sense 
of lurking mixed-motive. The Gersh collection is virtually enveloped by the art 
from the permanent collection -- as if the museum can hardly wait to get its 
hands on them. One can hardly blame the desire, but the symbolism of the 
installation and the courtliness of the catalogue foreword sets one worrying 
about matters unwelcome in the midst of an artistic experience -- of the 
shrinking numbers of serious collectors and the vanishing breed of truly 
philanthropic donors to public museums. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is "Constructing a History" (to March 4). The general idea seems to 
have been to put works in unusual juxtaposition so as to trigger unexpected 
insights. The first space contains artworks by such disparate contemporaries as 
Allen Ruppersberg, Julian Schnabel and Louise Lawler. The only insight to be 
gained from the combo is that there sure is a lot of different stuff going on. 
But we already knew that. 
</P>
<P>
In the second gallery it appears that the idea was to put the art in roughly 
chronological order, demonstrating the way MOCA's permanent collection is 
slowly growing to be able to track the development of contemporary art. Here we 
find classics by the likes of Miro, Gorky and Pollock followed by a room of 
Abstract Expressionists like Mark Rothko and Lee Krasner leading to another 
space full of minimalists. 
</P>
<P>
Here we see the likes of Morris Louis and Jules Olitski. The odd man out is Ron 
Davis represented by one of his back-painted geometric-illusion panels. 
Presumably this was the work that was supposed to kick open the doors of 
perception. All it does is cause us to remember that not every Davis is a 
masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
A room of California light-and-space types such as Larry Bell, Robert Irwin and 
Mary Corse is invaded by such contextual anomalies as Agnes Martin and Sherrie 
Levine. The net effect is to remind us that when you combine such delicately 
nuanced art it loses its subtle resonances and just looks thin, thin, thin. 
</P>
<P>
The presentation carries on like this for some 15 tedious galleries. 
Occasionally it works, as when Vito Acconci's cinder-block construction about 
social repression is joined by Larry Clark's suite of drug-culture photos, 
"Tulsa." We certainly knew that both artists have a subversive, outlaw quality 
so it's not the information that's important, it's the poetry of the 
combination. They rhyme, these guys. 
</P>
<P>
There is a hasty quality to the exhibition as if -- unable to decide on theme 
-- assistant curator Ann Goldstein just tried to present several at once. The 
result is a patchwork of art trying to prove similarities where none exist and 
papering over significant differences. But the main shortcoming here is trying 
to do a visual version of a college-exam compare-and-contrast essay question 
with works of radically different quality. 
</P>
<P>
Fine things show up by the likes of Anselm Keifer, Jill Geigerich and Alexis 
Smith, but there is too much fudging about probing the significance of art 
whose main significance is that it's second-string work. Revelatory combination 
is an important staple of curatorship but it only works to advantage when the 
art is all about equally super. New York's Museum of Modern Art permanent 
collection is smartly placed, but this is possible because the works are all 
masterpieces. 
</P>
<P>
"Constructing a History" seems to have been infected by MOCA's ever-clearer 
leanings to spreading itself too thin. It lives under a veneer of activities 
all of which are good in themselves. Good community relations are good, as are 
good international relations. Good publicity is good. Design shows are good as 
architecture, performance and radio broadcasts are good. 
</P>
<P>
But a place that calls itself an art museum is by definition about a solid and 
undistracted striving for excellence. As we move into the '90s, let's hope this 
admirable young institution sets its priorities and pursues them with the 
tenacity of a mountain climber.

"My colleagues . . . are all moaning about the high prices for works of art and 
the changes in the tax laws that have had a great impact on museums and the 
building of collections. But I don't think it's totally negative. What does a 
museum do? It rethinks priorities. Where will it put its attention if this 
continues? On younger artists -- a very good thing because the works are still 
reasonable in price."

Wonder to Play for Schools: Entertainer Stevie Wonder will headline a benefit 
concert in January to raise money for inner-city students and their schools. 
"Rejoice in Los Angeles," set for Jan. 6 at the Great Western Forum in 
Inglewood, will raise money for The Inner City Foundation of Excellence, which 
helps combat education problems in the inner city. While other performers 
joining Wonder in the concert have not yet been announced, Wonder said he will 
coordinate a Celebrity Choir -- scheduled to include Barry Bostwick, Vikki 
Carr, Marla Gibbs, Danny Glover, Robert Guillaume, Louis Gossett Jr., Edward 
James Olmos, Charlene Tilton, Clifton Davis and others -- for the concert's 
grand finale. CLAUDIA PUIG

BUZZCOCKS USHER IN NEW-WAVE NOSTALGIA

<P>
Late in the Buzzcocks' sold-out concert at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, 
the British punk progenitors tore into "Ever Fallen in Love," the pop gem that 
highlights the most recent hit album by the Fine Young Cannibals. 
</P>
<P>
Many younger fans on hand no doubt thought this an example of hard-core rockers 
offering a revved-up rave-up rendition of a popular standard, similar to what 
the Dickies have done to songs from "The Sounds of Silence" to "Silent Night," 
or what other punk bands have done lately with songs by Madonna and Suzanne 
Vega. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. Band leader Pete Shelley wrote "Ever Fallen in Love," which appeared on 
a delicious Buzzcocks compilation called "Singles Going Steady" 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
New-wave nostalgia is here in force. 
</P>
<P>
The Civic was jam-packed Saturday night for the reunion show of a band that 
hasn't released an album in eight years -- testimony to the enduring power of 
Shelley's ability to write songs with hooks strong enough that they often sound 
as though they could indeed be cover versions of pop hits, but played with, 
well, buzzsaw non-dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
This foursome's place in history is somewhat obscured by its being beat out of 
the mid-'70s gate by the Ramones and the Sex Pistols. Its legacy may well be 
that it was the first normal punk band, eschewing the campiness of the former 
outfit or the hyped-up fury of the latter (or even the poli-sci savagery of the 
Clash) to unpretentiously address the most basic issues of romance and 
alienation. 
</P>
<P>
While Johnny Rotten raged "I am an Antichrist," Shelley sang "I Don't Know What 
to Do With My Life." Guess which sounds less dated now. 
</P>
<P>
And so there were plenty of young miscreants who don't know what to do with 
their lives at the Civic, starting fisticuffs in the lobby when the slam pit 
inside got too calm or stage-diving or just modeling hairstyles -- Mohawks and, 
yes, buzzcuts -- as anachronistic as the music isn't. 
</P>
<P>
Then there were the better-dressed and better-behaved veterans of the era in 
question, showing up late so as to miss opening acts Bad Religion and the 
Nymphs, a decade older but not yet too pooped to power-pop. They have nice jobs 
but bet your bippy they can still relate to the "Don't Know . . ." business 
too. 
</P>
<P>
What young and less-young alike got from the Buzzcocks was an 80-minute set 
that stopped short of a thrilling performance -- these blokes come from the 
stand-still-and-play school, save for isolated enthusiastic outbursts -- but 
provided all the harmonic noise, fun and unfurrowed-brow angst it was supposed 
to. 
</P>
<P>
The show's first half featured the group's less melodic, more furious material, 
while the latter portion brought more recognizable numbers, including almost 
everything from "Singles Going Steady," one of the most definitive and catchy 
of all punk albums. The climactic "I Believe" had band members departing one by 
one, U2-style, while the audience kept singing the archival chorus "There is no 
love in this world anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone angling for Shelley's solo hits or new material was left hanging. 
Prospects of the band staying together to record after tour's end are said to 
be a definite maybe. The U.S. leg ends Thursday at the Country Club in Reseda.

MTV's 'Decade': MTV, which was launched in 1981, will look back over the 1980s 
in "Decade," a two-hour retrospective which the cable network says is one of 
its most ambitious projects to date. The program will first air on Dec. 13 (9 
p.m.), with repeats on Dec. 17 (2 p.m.) and Dec. 21 (9 p.m.). News clips, sound 
bites, film footage and interviews will bring back people and events, from

ONE MORE TIME: Encouraged by the overwhelming "yes" vote in Laguna Niguel, 
backers of cityhood for Laguna Hills are about to try again. . . . Their first 
attempt on the June ballot failed by less than 1% because of a strong no vote 
from Leisure World. . . . Backers say they will not include Leisure World in 
their next incorporation attempt. . . . Had they done that in June, 
incorporation would have passed by more than 8 to 1. Dana Parsons and Steve

heads the foundation that was sponsoring his Orange County visit when the Dalai 
Lama received word in October that he'd won the Nobel Peace Prize. . . . Now, 
when the Dalai Lama receives the prize Dec. 10 in Oslo, Jue will be among the 
80 people from around the world on the holy man's guest list. . . . A spokesman

CRACKDOWN: Get into a car-pool lane without at least one passenger aboard and 
you are more likely to get caught nowadays. . . . The CHP in Orange County is 
assigning officers overtime to beef up enforcement, but that still falls far 
short of enforcement programs in Washington and Virginia, where motorists who 
see a car-pool violator can call a toll-free number to report the license 
number. Dana Parsons and Steve Emmons

COLORS: Increasingly, black clothing is the order of the day in the county's 
gang-ridden areas. . . . "Gang kids are abandoning colors as fast as they can," 
says Greg Bodenhammer, director of Back in Control, a parent training center in 
Orange. . . . Wearing black, he says, "gives you safe passage through an area 
where gangs are a problem. Black says, 'Hey, I'm someone to watch out for.' "

THE GREENING OF SANTA ANA'S MIGUEL PULIDO; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: SOME CONSTITUENTS SAY THE COUNCILMAN'S NEW CONCILIATORY STYLE MEANS 
HE HAS LEARNED TO BE A LEADER. BUT OTHERS SUGGEST THAT HE HAS ABANDONED HIS 
ROLE AS LATINO SPOKESMAN.

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These days, City Councilman Miguel Angel Pulido doesn't rile easily. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he is working in his eighth-floor City Hall office or meeting a 
constituent at a Taco Bell table next door to his family's muffler shop, Pulido 
is a different man, by his own admission, than the young man who once railed 
against City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Pulido, 33, is not the kind of politician many voters expected when they 
elected him three years ago. The councilman, whose first encounter with 
government was a pitched community battle, has changed. To some of his 
constituents, the changes show that Pulido has learned to be a leader. But 
others suggest that he has abandoned his role as spokesman for Santa Ana's 
Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
Pulido said he has decided not to work from a soapbox and has instead chosen to 
be a team player, assuming a quiet, behind-the-scenes approach. Even at a 
recent council meeting where members hurled insults at each other over a 
redevelopment plan, Pulido remained quiet, finally suggesting that they 
postpone the vote. 
</P>
<P>
For Pulido, all of this started by chance. 
</P>
<P>
The Pulido family fell into politics in 1983, when the city threatened to raze 
patriarch Miguel Armando Pulido's muffler shop on East 1st Street to make way 
for downtown redevelopment. The younger Pulido, who had graduated from Cal 
State Fullerton on a tennis scholarship, quit his job with an engineering firm 
in Tustin to help his father's legal battle with Santa Ana. At that time, he 
did not even know the names of the council members. 
</P>
<P>
After a long and bitter struggle, which eventually attracted the city's diverse 
Latino leaders to the cause, the family won, and the muffler shop remained. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1986, fresh from his family's success, Pulido announced in front of 
the shop that he was running for City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"During this fight, I was forced to open my eyes to some disturbing facts about 
Santa Ana government," Pulido said then. "I learned that an individual's dreams 
can be wiped out completely by a majority vote of the Santa Ana City Council if 
folks are not willing to cast down the gauntlet and fight for what is 
rightfully theirs." 
</P>
<P>
During the waning days of campaigning, Pulido angered some Latino leaders by 
issuing a mailer urging strict enforcement of laws affecting undocumented 
workers. Pulido, who admits that the letter upset some supporters, still got a 
majority of the Latino vote. 
</P>
<P>
Pulido spent his first years on the council scrambling to learn about City Hall 
and local politics and answering phone calls from constituents who needed 
advice on anything from trash prices to American customs. 
</P>
<P>
He also had to alleviate the concern among some city leaders that he would try 
to dismantle city government. 
</P>
<P>
"There was fear that I would do everything I could do to destroy City Hall," 
Pulido said. "I had no intention of doing that." 
</P>
<P>
What did happen in those first years, Pulido said, was a transition, in which 
he learned to perform a balancing act, representing both the Latino community 
and all of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
His staunchest supporters say Pulido is doing fine. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the Hispanic politician of the 1980s and the '90s," said Reuben Martinez, 
secretary of the Orange County Democratic Club. "People want Miguel to knock 
down doors. That's a different generation. He looks boring compared to other 
politicians in the past. He doesn't cuss and he doesn't drink. But he has his 
own way of taking care of business." 
</P>
<P>
But some say Pulido, born in Mexico, has abandoned his Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
"Miguel has not taken a stand on anything," complained Sam Romero, a community 
leader who supported Pulido in 1986. "We're still waiting for the champion of 
the lower rung to show up. But he hasn't materialized." 
</P>
<P>
Romero did say, however, that Pulido provides "a flicker of hope" through his 
efforts to exempt some homes on Bristol Street from being razed as part of a 
$335-million redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
To Zeke Hernandez, president of the Santa Ana chapter of League of United Latin 
American Citizens, Pulido has been a "disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
"He's in his own world," said Hernandez, who ran unsuccessfully for a council 
seat in 1988. "He's failed to keep a close rapport with his own community." 
</P>
<P>
As a Latino politician, Pulido should help found neighborhood associations, 
attend community meetings and react strongly to issues that may affect Latinos, 
Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
"Being visible is just as important as the decisions he makes on the council," 
Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman John Acosta, the only other Latino on the council, said Pulido 
is facing the same scrutiny he faced -- and the same demands from the Latino 
constituents that he represent only them. 
</P>
<P>
"If he says no to any requests, that naturally upsets some in the community," 
Acosta said. 
</P>
<P>
Pulido also has to break stereotypes about Latino leaders, Acosta said. Pulido 
is a new breed of Latino politician, who does not need to be loud to be heard, 
said Acosta, who admits to being on the brassy side. 
</P>
<P>
"Miguel will go places in politics," he said, "because he's got a smooth, quiet 
approach. He sits down and analyzes what approaches he should take." 
</P>
<P>
Pulido's supporters say his leadership in ensuring that all Latinos are counted 
in the coming U.S. Census and in the battle to keep a jail from being built in 
Santa Ana has served his constituents well. 
</P>
<P>
Pulido adamantly insists that he represents Latinos, but not Latinos alone. 
</P>
<P>
"If people are saying that I'm ignoring a particular group, that is not the 
case," Pulido said. "My efforts are to help people across the board." 
</P>
<P>
Pulido said he is "very comfortable and secure" himself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very easy to judge and come up with the wrong conclusions," he said. "I 
don't want folks to think of me that way. Whenever you do something, good or 
bad, there's going to be criticism." 
</P>
<P>
Pulido defended his approach: "I'm not unemotional, but I'm not going to throw 
a temper tantrum and then apologize later for it." 
</P>
<P>
Pulido, who has missed just one council meeting since 1987, acknowledged that 
his tenure has been "stressful." 
</P>
<P>
"People want more than what I can possibly do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His father said Pulido, a bachelor and vegetarian who does not drink or smoke, 
"used to look like a kid before he started (being a councilman). He's getting 
old fast because he's always worrying about the people." 
</P>
<P>
The younger Pulido gives his phone number and address to anyone who asks for 
it. For now, he said, he is content to remain a councilman and will not 
speculate on his political future -- although in the past he has said he would 
consider running in 1990 for the 72nd Assembly District seat held by Curt 
Pringle (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
"When we had trouble at the muffler shop, the council didn't have five minutes 
for us," Pulido said. "We fought the hard way. If you are a congressman or 
president of the United States, maybe you don't have time for everybody. But 
I'm a councilman; I have the time for people to talk to me."

HARMONY FESTIVAL PROMOTES DIVERSITY

<P>
A year after several racial incidents sent shock waves through this city, 
residents again joined in a celebration created to soothe the tensions of the 
ethnically diverse community. 
</P>
<P>
The second annual Westminster Harmony Festival "visibly expresses the 
community's support for cultural and religious diversity and also promotes 
mutual respect and understanding among the people of Westminster," Mayor 
Charles V. Smith said at the opening ceremonies Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The festival was begun last year after the fatal shooting of a Latino youth by 
Westminster police who said the youth and others at a neighborhood party had 
threatened to attack them. The same year, a cross was burned in front of a 
black family's home, and swastikas were painted on the property and doors of 
Temple Beth David. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the ages, prejudice against race, religion or creed has destroyed 
the lives of human beings and brought civilized nations to ruin," Smith said. 
"In the spring and summer of 1988, we witnessed these illogical acts of 
prejudice. And once again we gather to reaffirm that these acts of terrorism 
will not be condoned." 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people roamed the grounds of the civic center, viewing dances and 
music of the Orient and tasting delicacies from around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that is a great thing for people to come out again this year and show 
how they feel about bigotry," resident Janet Cole said. "When I read last year 
about all the horrible racially motivated things that were happening, I was 
upset because I thought we as a nation had grown a lot more than that." 
</P>
<P>
Along with music and food, festival-goers were treated to an array of dancers, 
including L.A Chinese Folk Dancers, Belody Dancers and Vietnamese Dragon 
Dancers. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 15 organizations had booths at the festival, which is funded through 
the city and private donations. 
</P>
<P>
Opening ceremonies also paid tribute to one of the founding organizers of the 
festival, Rabbi Henri Front of Temple Beth David, who died in August of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, city officials say there have been no reports of racially 
motivated incidents. ALLISON SAMUELS

RECYCLING CHARGE EXEMPTION GRANTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As of Friday, low-income residents participating in the city's recycling 
program will not have to pay the recycling charge of $2.58 per month. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo to the City Council, Mayor Don E. Smith and Mayor Pro Tem Gene Beyer 
recommended the change in response to several seniors asked for the exemption. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said about a third of the city's residents are involved in the 
three-month-old recycling program. Next month, the city will distribute the 
colored bins for recycling to residents in the rest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Of the total monthly charge, the contractor receives $2.10 for bins, trucks and 
personnel. The city uses the remaining 48 cents for administering the program 
and for various public education programs, such as a children's coloring book 
and poster contests.

REDEVELOPMENT PLAN PROGRESS REPORTED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The past two years have marked the most productive period in the city's two 
decades of redevelopment, according to a new report by the Redevelopment 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the major developments in the city's five targeted areas are either 
finished or well under way. But some obstacles still lie ahead, the report 
found. 
</P>
<P>
New redevelopment projects completed during fiscal years 1987-88 and 1988-89 
totaled $400 million. In the Main-Pier project area, the cornerstone of the 
redevelopment effort, two major condominium projects, which combined are valued 
at $36.5 million and total 223 units, were completed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, council members rejected a proposed 10-story hotel at Main Street 
and Pacific Coast Highway, which many downtown residents argued would have 
spoiled the "village concept" of the area's redevelopment plans. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, construction began on the $55-million initial phase of the 
Waterfront project, which includes a 12-story, 296-room 
hotel-restaurant-convention complex, due to open in July. Including the 
Waterfront hotel project, located on Pacific Coast Highway between Beach 
Boulevard and Huntington Street, $149 million in new construction is under way 
in the project area. 
</P>
<P>
Other major developments completed during the period include a 
120,000-square-foot building in the Talbert-Beach project area, now leased to 
Southwest Quilted Products. 
</P>
<P>
"After stagnating for 20 years, we've finally seen redevelopment in this city 
move forward in the past two years," said Councilman Wes Bannister. 
</P>
<P>
Other council members, however, contended that the development during 1987-89 
was a result of two often-painstaking decades of work. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been a lot of things that have come to fruition in the last two 
years, but in reality, all the planning and negotiating and all of that have 
been spread out over a number of years," Councilwoman Grace Winchell said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, there were a lot of things that didn't prove to work out that came 
tumbling down (in 1986 and 1987). But we regrouped and came up with some 
different plans that have worked. I just think the timing was right. But it 
does look good." 
</P>
<P>
Still, a number of problems remain. State officials recently challenged the 
city's proposed Pierside Village project, questioning whether the city can 
legally develop land on either side of the pier now designated for public 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Some downtown property owners are continuing their opposition to proposed 
Main-Pier area projects, which ultimately could escalate into court battles. 
</P>
<P>
And several major development agreements hinge on a consensus by residents, 
developers and government agencies, some of which are far from being reached. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still some difficult questions to resolve," Winchell said. JOHN 
PENNER

MORE ROADBLOCKS PLANNED BY POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID F. BURKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of a collision that injured three members of a family, police 
announced that sobriety checkpoints will be established every three or four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Joe Milazzo said the first roadblock was set up this month on Imperial 
Highway east of Beach Boulevard, near the scene of the Oct. 29 accident. 
</P>
<P>
Police said a driver suspected of being under the influence turned left in 
front of an oncoming car carrying Edward Gonzalez, 31, his wife, Nina, 26, and 
their child, Amoz, 2 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales suffered broken ribs and serious injuries to a knee, while his wife 
suffered head injuries that have resulted in a continuing paralysis in her 
face. 
</P>
<P>
"When she smiles, part of her face doesn't move," Gonzales said. "The doctors 
want to do an operation, but we decided not to because there are too many risks 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
The two adults were wearing seat belts. The child was strapped into a car seat 
and suffered minor scratches. The family was taken to UCI Medical Center by 
helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
The other driver was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 11, a sobriety checkpoint on Imperial Highway resulted in 10 arrests. 
For four hours, officers stopped every fourth vehicle, a total of 502 cars. 
</P>
<P>
Milazzo said that two of those arrested were under the influence of both 
alcohol and other drugs. A total of 19 people were given field sobriety tests, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Milazzo said drivers did not object to the roadblock. DAVID F. BURKE

WELFARE OFFICE SITE REJECTED BY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time this year, the City Council has rejected plans for a 
welfare office in an industrial park on East Orangethorpe Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing 2 1/2 hours of public testimony Tuesday, the council decided on a 
3-2 vote that an industrial area is an inappropriate place for the county 
Social Services Agency to have an office. 
</P>
<P>
The council turned down a similar plan for the same site in March. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from neighboring companies said they did not want the area 
inundated with cars and pedestrians traveling to the office. 
</P>
<P>
The area has no sidewalks and is zoned for industrial use, said Frank Reid, 
executive vice president of the Fullerton Chamber of Commerce, whose members 
voted to oppose the project. By allowing the welfare office, he said, the 
council would be cutting back on available industrial space in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The industrial park already has traffic problems with current employees and 
trucks moving through the area, said Eddie Fischer, president of Vista Paint 
Corp. The proposed welfare office would have been next door to Vista Paint's 
office at 2020 E. Orangethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not against (social service) facilities," he said. "But I just think this 
is not the right place." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard C. Ackerman said he voted against the proposal because it 
would hurt existing businesses in the industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Don Bankhead and Mayor Molly McClanahan dissented with the council 
majority and voted to allow the office. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the industrial building at 1900 E. Orangethorpe, Burnett-Ehline 
Development Co., had asked the city to allow the building to be converted for 
use by the county. 
</P>
<P>
The county has been searching for an office in the area for the past four 
years, said Robert Griffith, chief deputy director of the county Social 
Services Agency. An office on Homer Street in Anaheim is severely crowded with 
clients, many of whom are from Fullerton, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith said he has looked at office and commercial sites in the area, but 
none was as good as the industrial building on Orangethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
"The Catch-22 for us is we don't believe there is an office, or not many 
offices anyway, that would have the characteristics we need," Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
The county requires enough parking space for employees and clients, and it must 
be close to bus routes, he said. TOM McQUEENEY

COUNTY TO STAGE TOXICS COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County residents are invited to bring hazardous household products to 
the county Fire Department's Toxics Roundup for disposal on Saturday in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that children are the most common victims of home accidents involving 
the poisonous materials, the department has asked residents to discard leftover 
items such as wood preservatives, auto and furniture polish, chemical drain 
cleaners, oven cleaners and pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people just leave certain products around for a year or more, which 
causes a big fire hazard," said Peter Depaola, communications dispatcher for 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department asks that the waste products be brought in their original 
containers, that the contents of the container match the outside label and that 
the total quantity per visit not exceed five gallons or 50 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The roundup will be from 9.a.m to 3 p.m. in the Park Place parking lot at 3333 
Michelson Drive in Irvine.

WOODBRIDGE, LOADED IN TRADITION AND EXPERIENCE, IS THE TEAM TO BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Woodbridge High School Coach Bill Shannon started to explain why his basketball 
team was the favorite to win the Pacific Coast League title this season when he 
paused and asked who Trabuco Hills Coach Rainer Wulf had picked. 
</P>
<P>
Wulf had predicted Woodbridge would win the league for the third time in the 
last four years. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, then Trabuco is by far the favorite," Shannon said. "But then again, if I 
could predict stuff, I would be in Las Vegas and not coaching here." 
</P>
<P>
Nice try, coach, but your Warriors are the team to beat this season after 
finishing second to Trabuco Hills last season. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask the league's other coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"Woodbridge is a head above everyone," Wulf said. "The biggest difference 
between Woodbridge and us is that they have experience in the front line and we 
don't, and we have an experienced backcourt and they don't." 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coach Don Burnette said, "Woodbridge is loaded. They have guys who won't 
play for them that would probably start for me." 
</P>
<P>
From Costa Mesa Coach Dean Cooper: "Trabuco Hills can light it up from 
three-point range and that will make them tough, but Woodbridge is going to be 
the toughest with all its people back. They have an outstanding program." 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge returns six players, including starters Joe Cohen, Romalis Taylor 
and Bryant McLemore from a team that finished 9-13 overall and 7-3 in the 
league. Cohen, a 6-3 senior, averaged 16 points a game and Taylor and McLemore, 
6-3 juniors, averaged eight and six points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
And what about the seven players lost to graduation? 
</P>
<P>
No problem. Shannon just promoted seven players from last season's junior 
varsity team that won the league championship. 
</P>
<P>
That's how it's done at tradition-rich schools. The Warriors have a 27-3 league 
record in the league the last three years. They won the league title in 1987 
and '88. They were the state 2-A champions in 1987 and runner-up the next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're shooting for our fifth year in a row in the playoffs," Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills lost leading scorer Rick Swanwick to graduation, but guards Randy 
Kriech and Tim Manning return from last season's team that reached the state 
3-A final. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs, 25-7 overall and 9-1 in the league last season, also picked up 
Beau Hossler, a 6-2 swingman who transferred from Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a better backcourt in Orange County," Wulf said. "Those three are 
all seasoned players. 
</P>
<P>
"At times we could have five guards on the floor. People say we will have 
matchup problems, but so will other teams because of our speed and quickness." 
</P>
<P>
Wulf said there's no pressure to repeat as league champions. Everyone is too 
busy watching the school's football team try to win its second consecutive 
Division VIII football championship. 
</P>
<P>
"No one expected us to do what we did last year," Wulf said. "I told them they 
had a shot to win a league championship again. But with our football team 
winning, a lot of fans think if you just predict it, it will happen." 
</P>
<P>
Here's what's happening in the league: 
</P>
<P>
COSTA MESA -- Cooper hopes one returning starter and two transfers will make 
his second season as coach easier than his first. 
</P>
<P>
But he doesn't expect any miracles. 
</P>
<P>
Leading scorer Tim Nguyen (22 points) graduated and only one starter, guard 
Bret Dieball, is back from last season's 4-17 team. Costa Mesa finished fifth 
in the league at 2-8. 
</P>
<P>
Dieball, a 5-10 senior, started the second half of the season and averaged 12 
points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said transfers Xavier Hana, a 6-2 forward, and Ryan McEvoy, a 6-0 guard, 
will give the Mustangs the depth and quickness they lacked last season. Hana 
transferred from Valencia and McEvoy moved from New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
With a short lineup, the Mustangs will run a fast-break offense. But they need 
rebounds to run, and Cooper has switched from a man-to-man to a matchup zone 
defense in hopes of cutting taller teams down to size. 
</P>
<P>
LAGUNA BEACH -- Leading scorers John Trevino (16 points) and Dain Blanton (15) 
return from last season's 10-13 team, but Coach Ed Bowen promises the Artists 
will spread the scoring around this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Last season, we built everything around Blanton and Trevino," Bowen said. 
"This year, everyone can pop it in. We'll be 10 times stronger off the bench. 
Last season, we had only five or six (key) players." 
</P>
<P>
And the player who will be spreading the ball around for the Artists will be 
5-11 point guard Josh Borell, one of eight varsity players up from last 
season's junior varsity team. Borell averaged 10 points a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
LAGUNA HILLS -- The Hawks, who have never won a league title, have a new coach 
who knows all about championships. Dave Brown replaces Joe Reid after leading 
Fountain Valley to seven Sunset League titles in his 20 years at the school. 
</P>
<P>
But don't expect too much from Brown and the Hawks right away. They lost 10 
players, including the top two scorers, from last season's 16-9 team. Chris 
Sheff, a four-year starter who averaged 18.7 points, has graduated and Hossler 
transferred to Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Brown will build around Pat Nelson, a 6-4 forward and the only returning 
starter, and reserves Al Saldana and Todd Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE -- The Panthers find themselves in a similar situation as Costa Mesa -- 
only one returning starter from a 4-18 team and a second-year coach trying to 
replace 12 players who have graduated. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Duran, a 5-10 point guard, returns for the Panthers, who finished last 
in the league at 1-9. Duran, a junior, averaged seven points and three assists 
a game. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll do what we did last year," Burnette said. "We'll play a little better 
defense and take care of the ball on the press, which Carlos does really well." 
</P>
<P>
TRABUCO HILLS -- The Mustangs lost Swanwick, but don't be surprised if Kriech, 
Manning and transfer Hossler pick up the scoring slack. 
</P>
<P>
Swanwick, a 6-10 center who averaged 20.3 points last season, is now a redshirt 
at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
But with Kriech (13.7 points), Manning (10.2) and Hossler (14), Wulf has 
leadership and three-point shooting threats in the backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
Wulf will have to do without Manning and Jim Farbaniec, a 6-4 center, for the 
first five games. Both are playing for the Mustangs' football team. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Khoa Tran, a 5-9 transfer from Westminster, will fill in for 
Manning and Brian Sawa, a 6-2 senior, will replace Farbaniec. 
</P>
<P>
WOODBRIDGE -- Shannon always schedules a tough nonleague schedule and this year 
is no exception with games against Estancia, Centennial, Corona del Mar, 
Mission Viejo and a trip to Las Vegas for a holiday tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a brutal schedule," he said. "We played a tough preseason last year and 
it really paid off for us in the league." 
</P>
<P>
Shannon said the Warriors have more experience and depth than any team he has 
coached. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when we won state and were runner-up, we didn't have people from top to 
bottom who could contribute," he said.

CENTURY TO UNVEIL GYMNASIUM FRIDAY 
</P>

<P>
The classiest of Orange County high school basketball facilities will see its 
first basketball action Friday afternoon when the Century High School boys' 
freshmen and sophomore basketball teams play their season openers against 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Century, located in Santa Ana, is Orange County's newest high school. It will 
unveil its $20,000 four-sided drop-down scoreboard in the 2,500-seat campus 
gymnasium at a half-hour ceremony Friday at 2 p.m. before the sophomore game. 
The freshman game will follow. 
</P>
<P>
"The gym facility is probably, if not the best, one of the best in the state 
for high schools," said Century basketball Coach Greg Coombs, who left a 
successful program at Santa Ana High for the Century job. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section officials already have inquired about using the facility in 
the future for the small schools or 1-A playoffs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You walk into the second level and walk down to the bleachers," said Coombs, 
who led Santa Ana to the semifinals of the Southern Section 4-A Division last 
season. 'We are going to have seats right along courtside like they do at the 
Forum," Coombs said. 
</P>
<P>
The game will be broadcast on KYOU Channel 26 in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just going to be a great event and it is something the whole school will 
remember for many years to come," Coombs said. 
</P>
<P>
Raising Roof-Raisers Right: Century students will receive instruction in more 
than reading, writing, arithmetic and now, computer literacy. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the students will be learning something a bit more spirited -- the 
proper way to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids are freshmen and sophomores," Coombs said. "A lot of these kids are 
just coming out of junior high, so the majority haven't been to a big game. 
</P>
<P>
"We want them to get the full effect of what it is like being part of a 
big-time event." 
</P>
<P>
The school has a daily 15-minute advisement class students attend. During that 
time, students and teachers discuss everything from how to be a better person 
to how to get into college. But this week, in honor of the basketball team's 
season opener, the students will be learning how to express their school 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
They will show off their cheers and spirit at Friday's pregame ceremony, which 
will include such activities as shot contests for prizes. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids are having a face-painting contest at the school like they do in the 
colleges," Coombs said. 'We are trying to make it just like a college event 
would be. 
</P>
<P>
"It is building both self-esteem in the kids and pride in their school." 
</P>
<P>
Don't Forget The Three Rs: Ten of the 12 members on Century's sophomore team 
have a 3.0 or better grade-point average, Coombs said. 
</P>
<P>
"More than anything else," he said, "more than this game or this gym, that 
pleases us more than anything -- that academically they are doing the job." 
</P>
<P>
No Regular Rusher: Rancho Alamitos High School's Dana Riddle, Orange County's 
regular-season rushing leader with 1,975 yards, also led the state in that 
category. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he broke the all-time state record for most carries in the regular 
season. He carried 374 times to better Rene Barton's record of 320, set in 1983 
while Barton played at Whittier Christian. 
</P>
<P>
The all-time state regular-season rushing record, held by Whittier Christian's 
Craig Johnston, is safe, though. Johnston gained 2,445 yards in only nine games 
in 1975. The record was set at the old Whittier Christian campus in Whittier, 
before the school opened its La Habra campus, so it is not an Orange County 
record. The county record was set by Servite's Derek Brown, who rushed for 
2,301 yards in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Riddle took control of this season's rushing race in the eighth week, when he 
gained 344 yards against Pacifica. That same week, his primary competitor, Mark 
Hatzenbuhler of Halt High School in Sacramento, had only two carries for 
minus-four yards after he was ejected for fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Hatzenbuhler finished third in the state with 1,770 yards in 244 carries. La 
Puente's Marshawn Thompson of Bassett High School was second with 1,918 yards 
in 304 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Sibling Rivalry: Jerry Wulf, 31, and his brother Rainer, 29, have always loved 
to compete. Not so much against each other, however, because they played 
different sports. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers might just be the first fraternal siblings to coach their teams to 
Southern Section titles. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Rainer led Trabuco Hills to the Southern Section 3-A basketball 
championship. Last week, Jerry led South Pasadena to a 14-8 victory over La 
Serna in the Southern Section 2-A water polo championships. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry's victory was important in the good-natured battle between the brothers 
over which sport is better. Especially since it might sway one of their nieces 
or nephews to take up water polo. 
</P>
<P>
"He always wants them to be water polo players and I want them to be basketball 
players," Rainer said. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers got involved in swimming early. Jerry decided to stick with 
swimming and water polo, playing the latter at Cal State Los Angeles. Rainer 
opted for basketball, playing at UC Irvine.

CLAYTON STARTLES THE FIELD AT BARRIOS 10K RACE

Matt Clayton doesn't have any national championships notched on his running 
shoes. There are no Olympic medals gathering dust on his shelf. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday at the $20,000 Reebok Arturo Barrios Invitational, Clayton, a 
24-year-old San Diego State student, raced against those who have such things 
-- and won nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton, of Imperial Beach, waited until the final 200 yards of the 
10-kilometer race to pull away from a talented field to win in 28 minutes 30 
seconds, an impressive 39-second improvement over his previous 10K best of 
29:09, run only two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Among those Clayton beat were Suleiman Nyambui, who won 15 National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. championships in cross-country, indoor and outdoor track 
competing for UTEP in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Nyambui, 37, was second in 28:39, followed by Mexican standouts Salvador Garcia 
(28:44), Abundio Mondragon (28:52) and Jorge Marquez (29:12). 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, this is a big-time thrill for me," said Clayton, a cross-country coach at 
Bonita Vista High School. "My main goal was to run under 29 minutes and break 
into the top five. I didn't think I'd win the thing. It's exciting. Like (being 
on) cloud 99, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
In the women's division, Rosa Mota, the 1988 Olympic marathon champion from 
Portugal, had little trouble outrunning a field that included four-time U.S. 
Olympian Francie Larrieu-Smith, 1987 NCAA 10,000-meter champ Sylvia Mosqueda, 
and Ingrid Kristiansen of Norway, the women's world-record holder at several 
distances, including 10K. 
</P>
<P>
Mota, who waved to the largely Latino crowds as they shouted "Vaya Rosa!" and 
"Vaya Rosita!," spent the first two miles in a shoulder-to-shoulder duel with 
Mosqueda before picking up the pace. Mosqueda, whose reputation as a runner who 
goes out hard and finishes weak proved true again, faded to third in 33:20 and 
was passed by Larrieu-Smith (second at 33:05) with two miles remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Mota, who is just 4-feet-9, 90 pounds and wears a men's size 3 1/2 shoe, said: 
"I don't like to wait for the finish (to make a move) because I am too slow. I 
try to go faster and faster each mile instead." 
</P>
<P>
Kristiansen, still recovering from her victory in the New York City Marathon 
three weeks ago, participated in the event's 5K walk with her 6-year-old son, 
Gaute, before running in the elite 10K. Kristiansen had planned on running in 
the open 10K, but changed her mind Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I planned to run the fun run, but I am a competitor; I wanted to run," she 
said. "I didn't try to win at all; I just love to race. I haven't trained since 
New York, so I'm not in shape." 
</P>
<P>
Kristiansen, whose 10K world record on the track is 30:13, ran 34:24, good 
enough for sixth and $400. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton and Mota each earned $4,000 for their victories. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Although he is hardly close to his form that brought him several world records 
some 10 years ago, 37-year-old Henry Rono, now on the comeback trail in Eugene, 
Ore., ran a respectable 32:34 for 19th. . . . Twelve men broke 30 minutes in 
the race, and seven women ran sub-35s. . . . Orange County's top finisher was 
former Orange Coast College standout Alfredo Vigueras, now living and training 
in Alamosa, Colo. . . . Proceeds from the race will benefit a "Stay in School" 
program for Orange County students. The race's namesake, Arturo Barrios, said 
$15,000 was raised for the program Sunday. Next year the goal is $20,000. "This 
sport has given me a lot of things," said Barrios, the world-record holder at 
10,000 meters. "This is one way of giving something back, to help people." . . 
. Despite the early-morning drizzle, about 2,000 runners turned out for the 
races, and an estimated 1,000 came just to watch.

CASE MADE FOR SMALLNESS BY 'SCULPTURAL INTIMACIES'; 
</P>

SMALL-SCALE WORKS HAVE A PLACE IN THE LARGE-SCALE WORLD, BUT THIS EXHIBIT COULD 
USE AT LEAST ONE PIECE WITH A BIG VOICE.

<P>
Does important sculpture have to be on a monumental scale? It sometimes seems 
that way in an era when "bigger" is ubiquitous -- if not necessarily better -- 
in other spheres of life. 
</P>
<P>
From swollen conglomerates to jumbo shrimp, outsized entities are the norm. And 
as if in response to the vast, cold public spaces of the corporate world, 
contemporary sculpture often comes in mammoth sizes. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is a case to be made for smaller, human-scaled works -- not cutesy 
miniatures but ambitious pieces that dominate only a few feet of space. That's 
the agenda of "Sculptural Intimacies," an exhibit by 12 American artists at 
Security Pacific Gallery in Costa Mesa. Although it's easy to quibble with the 
essentially conservative taste of guest curator Robert H. Byer, his graceful 
catalogue essay offers numerous insights. 
</P>
<P>
Byer, an English professor at Rhodes College in Memphis, is a former Los 
Angeles resident who has written about photography and sculpture. In his essay, 
he discusses the historical context of intimate sculpture and analyzes its 
unique qualities. 
</P>
<P>
Sculptors who work on an intimate scale get the benefit of a "decisive 
closeness" to "ideas and emotions," he writes, and viewers often find 
themselves scrutinizing detailed elements of the piece. Small-scale work can 
involve "invitations to the ceremonies of everyday use and to the 
unceremoniousness of play," he remarks, but it also paradoxically may evoke 
feelings of "distance or estrangement." 
</P>
<P>
The sculptors he chose for the show include well-known figures -- Manuel Neri, 
Bryan Hunt, Lynda Benglis and George Herms -- as well as others who are 
scarcely household names. Bronze is the hands-down favorite of these artists, 
and most of the work in the show comports itself in ways that follow modernist 
precepts set down decades ago. For some reason, work as a whole seems to 
emphasize the willful irregularities of organic life. 
</P>
<P>
William Outcault's gangly, piquant images of weeds, grass and other growing 
things are crafted from deckle-edged scraps and spikes of bronze. The sculptor 
magnifies some of the ugly ducklings of the natural world, building in a dogged 
scruffiness that goes along with the idea of "weed." 
</P>
<P>
In "Grass," the artist's ability to suggest the individual growth patterns 
within a tuft of grass is reminiscent of sculptor Louise Bourgeois' knack for 
giving each element in a group of like objects a distinctive tilt. 
</P>
<P>
Herms' assemblages are particularly elegant examples of the legerdemain he 
works with old tool parts, architectural ornaments and scraps of printed paper. 
Organic motifs are paramount in "Encrustation (Hook)." Among the luxuriously 
curving elements attached to an arch shape made out of a cardboard box are a 
sheet of curlicue-embossed metal, a rusted pan and nautical hook and a fragment 
of old-fashioned German fraktur printing (the kind that looks like Gothic 
lettering). 
</P>
<P>
The use of gold and copper lends Jacqueline Dreager's small objects an aura of 
ceremony despite their humble positions on the floor or wall. Most of these 
works seem to bear witness to an arduous transformation of some kind. The 
caramelized color of the top of Dreager's "Golden One" -- which sits on a gold 
oblong painted directly on the gallery floor -- suggests metamorphosis by fire. 
In "Shorebird," black tarry deposits cling to a scraped piece of wood that 
emerges from a curved bronze "tail." Hints of an ecological theme hover about 
this piece, but formal values ultimately seem more important. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Saunders' small bronze shapes also lie on the floor. Scattered evenly over 
a large area, they cluster, coil, fold and curl in ways that suggest all manner 
of organic objects: fingers, bladders, shells, leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Hunt's cast-bronze pieces share an emphasis on vertical flow and heavily 
gestural surfaces. Michael Steiner's ribbons of cast bronze buckle and fold 
into loopy, abstract shapes. James Dinerstein compresses slabs of bronze or 
terra cotta into severely horizontal or vertical arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Isaac Witkin's bronzes include a model for "Study for Sioux Falls" 
(ripple-edged planes notched together) and a powdery-textured construction with 
a curdled surface that fits together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle 
("Inferno"). 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Boxer casts his tiny bronzes to look like frozen brush strokes, with 
paint applied on top of the frenzied surfaces. Although a young, irreverent 
artist might do this as a sendup of abstract expressionism, Boxer is in his 60s 
and these works seem to be sincere homages to a revered modernist style. 
</P>
<P>
Benglis' lush slumping-glass sculptures drag with them snippets of fine wire 
mesh, floating areas of bright color and lengths of metal pipe. Manuel Neri's 
blurred, sexless figures emerge haltingly from rectangular slabs of plaster or 
ceramic, or stop in elusive mid-gesture. Jim Huntington's granite and copper 
abstract sculptures employ predictable contrasts of smooth curves and roughened 
masses. 
</P>
<P>
One major point Byer stresses is the "cultural erosion of a 'humanist scale' " 
in contemporary sculpture, with its frequently strident tone and epic 
dimensions. At the same time, Byer adds, viewers have become accustomed to 
looking at small photographic reproductions of art (in which everything tends 
to look the same size). So we've been missing out on the "nearness and 
palpability, and . . . the satisfying sense of formal rightness" that 
small-scale sculpture can offer. 
</P>
<P>
Well, that's true as far as it goes, but it's a pity Byer didn't chose at least 
a token small piece with a pronounced conceptual or social slant. His choices 
seem to imply that if you're going to work small, you need to make pleasing 
objects that are not unduly baffling and don't scream and shout. The fact is, 
"humanist scale" no longer necessarily means nice pieces for the living room. 
Granted the bank's restrictions on showing obviously outre art, Byer still 
could have shown us how quietly subversive a small voice can be. 
</P>
<P>

ROOSEVELT '79 REUNION: THEY STAND AND DELIVER; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: EAST LOS ANGELES BARRIO KIDS RETURN 10 YEARS AFTER GRADUATION TO 
FIND THEIR CLASSMATES ARE DOCTORS, LAWYERS, TEACHERS AND POLITICAL ACTIVISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The graduates of Roosevelt High School's Class of '79 shared some common bonds. 
They were barrio kids -- Latinos, Asians and blacks who grew up on Los Angeles' 
East Side, where they grappled with cultural differences, poverty, language 
problems and the ever-present threat of feuding gangs. 
</P>
<P>
But they also were an exceptional class that "really had its act together from 
the start," says Cynthia Augustine, a former Roosevelt teacher and a class 
sponsor who now is assistant principal at Markham Intermediate School in Watts. 
"No other class did what they did. . . . They all went out and did something 
very, very positive." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as 275 Class of '79 alumni learned at their 10th reunion Saturday night 
at the Los Angeles Hilton, their bright, ambitious and determined peers, for 
the most part, continued or are continuing their education. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of them went on to colleges, universities and trade schools, 
most on scholarships and grants. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a decade out of Roosevelt, many of them are more than simply striving 
students, struggling with hardships. 
</P>
<P>
They're doctors, like Beemeth Robles, who graduated from Stanford University's 
medical school and now is a general surgery resident at Stanford Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
They're lawyers, like South San Gabriel resident Fumio Robert Nakahiro, who 
graduated from UCLA and Loyola Law School and now works with the Arthur K. 
Snyder law firm in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
They're political activists, like Daniel Alvarez, who received a public policy 
master's degree from the University of Michigan and now serves as a legislative 
analyst in Sacramento, overseeing and monitoring California's community 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
They're educators, like David Santamaria, a UC Santa Barbara graduate, Hacienda 
Heights resident and fifth-grade teacher in El Monte. Or Joanne Carrillo, the 
class president, UC Santa Barbara graduate and now a special education teacher 
at Hollenback Junior High in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
They're nurses, like Whittier resident Esther Medina Vasquez, an R.N. who works 
at East Los Angeles Doctors Hospital and whose eight brothers and sisters also 
are Roosevelt graduates. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because we grew up in the barrio doesn't mean we were disadvantaged 
individually," said Xochitl Cruz, a 1983 Cal State L.A. graduate who now is a 
calendar coordinator for a Los Angeles law firm. "The disadvantage is in the 
whole, not the individual." 
</P>
<P>
Cruz, a member of the reunion organizing committee, added: "We were stereotyped 
as barrio kids. Well, we were. But that doesn't mean you couldn't be somebody. 
When you come out of the barrio, you're already at the bottom. The only way to 
go is up." 
</P>
<P>
Cruz, who has moved to Glendale from the East Side, returns often to her former 
neighborhood to visit family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents came here from Mexico in 1961, the year I was born," she said. "My 
father worked for $60 a week then. Now he has his own business as a wood 
turner. He recently made all the lamps for the Sheraton (hotel) in Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
Robles, who received scholarships and took out loans to finance his 
undergraduate and medical education, credits many of his teachers at Roosevelt 
for his post-graduate successes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we owe a lot to our teachers who believed in us and expected us to 
excel," he said. "A lot of times we don't have role models. And I think a lot 
of parents were responsible for this class, too. My mom was a very positive 
force. She said, 'I'll help you do what you want to do.' Of course, she 
couldn't help me financially. Back then, she was a clerk-typist who made 
$10,000 a year and had to support four kids. My dad left home when I was 8. I 
wish they had diplomas for moms. My mom should have one." 
</P>
<P>
Robles and many of his 1979 classmates have kept in contact with Roosevelt and 
other junior and senior highs in the East Los Angeles barrio, believing that 
they can serve as role models for students there. "I wish we had a mechanism to 
instill this need for an education in others," Robles said. "Many come back and 
talk to the students. It's something that we can do for the community." 
</P>
<P>
Lance Holliday, who grew up in the Aliso Village projects and now is a savings 
counselor, insisted that he and his classmates can help other Roosevelt 
students "develop a sense of pride in their school and community. . . . We were 
a different type of class. Our ambitions were higher. I thought gangs were 
silly. I saw a lot of my friends in them. And a lot aren't here now because of 
them. 
</P>

"I went back and was an assistant football coach the two years we won 
back-to-back city championships in '84 and '85," he added. "Through football, 
there was pride within the school, a sense of belonging. You've got to develop 
that in these guys and get them out of the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
He said he has fulfilled that hope for his own family: "My goal was to get my 
mom out of the barrio. She lives in Desert Hot Springs now." 
</P>
<P>
Holliday, who is married and lives in West Covina, said he had put his 
education on hold for a while, but is back in school at Los Angeles City 
College, working toward a bachelor's degree. 
</P>
<P>
He is not the only member of his class continuing his education. Maria Rivas 
Chavez, a USC graduate and an expectant mom who lives with her husband in 
Paramount, has taken a leave of absence from UCLA law school; Regina Zumaya, a 
Cal State L.A. graduate and Alhambra resident, is working toward her master's 
degree in physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Such drive for advancement is important, said Alexander Retana, a 1978 
Roosevelt graduate who married his high school sweetheart, Lourdes Lara, Class 
of '79. They now have two children and a Glendale condominium. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think they can't better themselves from the projects," said 
Retana, who works for Rockwell International and has a semester left at Pierce 
College before he earns a bachelor's degree. "I grew up in Pico Gardens 
(housing project) and it is possible to get out. You have to want to do it. 
It's easy to sit there and do nothing. It's harder to lift your eyes above." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, who studied French at UCLA for a year before they married and started 
a family, is a Los Angeles Department of Water and Power office manager, who 
plans to return to school when her son and daughter are older. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the couple plans to talk with their children about the importance of 
hard work and education, he said, adding: "If more parents did that, we 
wouldn't have so many problems. My father told me that -- get an education. He 
showed me his big hands, rough from hard work. He said, 'I've had to work hard. 
You can do better.' " 
</P>
<P>
Interrupting his reunion chat with old friends Alvarez and Nakahiro, Santamaria 
explained: "I was fortunate to have a good set of parents, and my friends, who 
were a good influence on me. I love them like brothers. I had no thoughts about 
going away to college and they kept after me. I put myself through school with 
many jobs, at a moving company, a drugstore. 
</P>
<P>
"My cause now is to inspire the children coming up," he added. "To be a role 
model. I tell them about how important education is to them. That's what it's 
all about. I had a lot of friends and family members in gangs. Some I lost. And 
that's a tragedy, because there is so much potential in the barrio."

Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies found a Burbank man and his 10-year-old 
son this morning, a day after the Jeep in which they were riding became stuck 
in a river bed in a rugged undeveloped area near Val Verde. 
</P>
<P>
William Hancock, 37, and his son, Michael, were cold but uninjured when spotted 
at 7:40 a.m. by a helicopter flying above the Santa Clara River in Indian 
Dunes, Sgt. Michael Watner said. 
</P>
<P>
Watner said Hancock had picked his son up at 10:30 a.m. Sunday at his former 
wife's home in Val Verde for a few hours of off-road riding in the Jeep. 
Hancock and the boy spent about three hours driving along dirt roads in the 
rugged surrounding areas before becoming stuck when attempting to cross the 
riverbed, Watner said. 
</P>
<P>
Hancock later said that the Jeep sank in mud and water up to the exhaust pipe 
and that the engine stalled. 
</P>
<P>
At 4 p.m. Hancock hiked out of the area to a phone in a campground and called 
his girlfriend, leaving a message on her tape machine that he was stuck in a 
creek bed, Watner said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hancocks were not spotted until after daylight this morning, Watner said.

State and county agriculture officials, trying to stave off the spread of the 
destructive Mediterranean fruit fly, today began distributing about 100,000 
flyers to North Orange County residents whose neighborhoods are to be sprayed 
later this week with a pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
The assault was prompted by the discovery earlier this month in a Brea guava 
tree of a pregnant Medfly, the insect that ravaged the state's agriculture in 
1981. County officials said today that they have revised earlier strategies for 
combating the Medfly and are planning only one pesticide spraying over a 
10-square-mile area of the northern county rather than seven separate 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
That will come Thursday night unless heavy winds cause a delay. County and 
state officials, although asserting there are no health risks posed by the 
spraying with the possible exception of temporary eye irritation, are urging 
residents in the affected area to stay indoors Thursday night and to put pets 
and cars under cover.

The State Department said today that it has lodged a strong protest with the 
Soviet Embassy concerning the "dangerous escalation" created by Nicaragua's 
alleged attempt to ship Soviet Bloc weaponry to leftist rebels in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the Central American issue, as a 
result of the abortive weapons delivery attempt, will become a prime area of 
discussion when President Bush meets with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
on Dec. 2-3 in the Mediterranean off Malta. 
</P>
<P>
The protest note deplores the "dangerous escalation of conflict, contrary to 
Soviet assurances," Tutwiler said. 
</P>
<P>
She added that Bush will press the Soviets "to take action to ensure their 
allies (Nicaragua and Cuba) cease this outrageous behavior." 
</P>
<P>
The note was delivered to the Soviet charge d'affaires Saturday evening by 
Robert M. Kimmitt, undersecretary of state for political affairs, and Bernard 
Aronson, assistant secretary for inter-American affairs.

The 21-year-old brother of a well-liked Garden Grove student teacher was 
arrested for allegedly killing her and setting fire to the family home, police 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Callen Anthony Chase was booked into Orange County Jail for suspicion of murder 
in connection with the slaying of his sister, Claudia Chase, 28. Garden Grove 
and Anaheim officers arrested the man about 9:40 p.m. Sunday at the Amtrak 
station in Anaheim. Detectives would not say why they believed he had gone 
there. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect and the victim both lived at the Garden Park Estates home with 
their mother. Garden Grove Police Lt. Chuck Gibbs declined to state the motive 
for the crime. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's badly burned corpse was found Thursday afternoon by firefighters 
who were called to the two-story home on Cerulean Avenue. An autopsy determined 
that Claudia Chase, 28, died of massive head injuries, and investigation showed 
that the fire had been deliberately set. 
</P>
<P>
She was a student teacher at nearby Pacific High School, which she once 
attended as a student.

Doctors performing a historic liver transplant operation involving a living 
donor today accidentally damaged the donor's spleen and were forced to remove 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The spleen of Terri Smith, 29, of Schertz, Tex., was damaged as doctors removed 
a portion of her liver to implant in her 21-month-old daughter, Alyssa, who 
suffers from biliary atresia, a spokesman for the University of Chicago 
Hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
A retractor came loose during surgery and hit the spleen, said Dr. Peter 
Whitington, director of pediatric transplant services. The spleen was then 
removed, forcing a delay in preparations for Alyssa's surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of the spleen will not adversely affect Smith, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said they expect the surgery on the youngster to continue into the 
evening.

Legislators today gave final approval to a plan putting the small Baltic 
republics on the road to economic autonomy from Moscow next year and possibly 
issuing their own currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies from the tiny republic of Estonia stood and cheered after the Soviet 
Parliament approved the measure on a vote of 296 to 67. Thirty-seven deputies 
abstained. 
</P>
<P>
A final vote on the bill had been delayed Friday after a sharp debate on 
whether the move amounted to an effort to tear apart the Soviet system. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev supported the bill as a step toward economic 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
Tass press agency said the law goes into effect Jan. 1 and gives Lithuania, 
Latvia and Estonia "the right to engage in independent economic activity and 
envisages equal participation in union activity."

During the night, Felker fell asleep and said that when he awoke early Sunday, 
Rogers, 40, was dead. The temperature had fallen to 34.

More people are having their cholesterol levels tested by inexpensive mobile 
health services, but there is evidence that many of the facilities are unsafe 
and inaccurate, a government report said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Health and Human Services Department study said some of the screening 
violates federal guidelines for controlling blood-borne diseases such as AIDS 
and hepatitis, which call for technicians to wear new gloves each time blood is 
drawn and to dispose of bloody materials in specially marked containers. 
</P>
<P>
The report found examples of used needles thrown into regular garbage cans, 
technicians taking blood -- sometimes from a vein -- without wearing gloves or 
wearing used ones, and blood covering mats and counters at sites frequently 
operated amid the tumult of a grocery store or shopping mall.

HONECKER 'BROKEN,' SECURITY CHIEF SAYS

<P>
Disgraced former East German leader Erich Honecker is a broken man, barely able 
to comprehend the momentous changes in the country he ruled for 18 years, his 
security chief said today. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult for him to understand everything. His whole world has 
collapsed," Maj. Gen. Guenter Wolf said at the compound that for 30 years 
housed the Communist Party elite north of Berlin behind high walls and under 
armed guard. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke to Western reporters during an unprecedented tour of the previously 
top-secret settlement, focus of many rumors and stories among East Germans. 
</P>
<P>
"I visited him after he left the Politburo . . . to discuss certain questions 
about him living here and so on," Wolf told reporters in an empty house, one of 
the 23 large but not sumptuous dwellings on the snow-coated forest site. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a broken man," the tough security chief said before pausing, looking down 
moist-eyed and visibly overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker, 77, resigned last month as party chief and head of state after a wave 
of pro-democracy protests. Now he is in disgrace, facing a party disciplinary 
hearing and an investigation into corruption during his authoritarian rule. 
</P>
<P>
"What's he got to live for? He wouldn't be able to stand appearing in public 
again," said Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
There was no sign of life behind the net-curtained windows at the front of No. 
11, Honecker's home in the "Wandlitz Forest Settlement," which the leadership 
built for themselves in 1958 as a response to the failed 1956 Hungarian 
uprising against Soviet domination. 
</P>
<P>
But photographers saw him through blinds in a room at the rear of the 
two-story, cream-colored house that would not look out of place in a West 
German suburb. 
</P>
<P>
The blinds snapped shut when he noticed the cameramen. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the house stood an East German Wartburg, the car of Honecker's wife, 
Margot, who was sacked as education minister last month. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker was forced to step down Oct. 18 in the face of huge street protests 
and an exodus of disgruntled citizens. 
</P>
<P>
He was replaced by Egon Krenz, who like almost all the remaining active party 
leaders has moved out of the compound and into a smaller property in East 
Berlin.

The orbit of Solar Max, a 5,000-pound satellite that collected information on 
solar flares for nine years, has deteriorated to the point that the spacecraft 
should crash back to Earth late this week, NASA said today. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the craft will burn up in the atmosphere, but about a dozen pieces 
weighing 3 to 5 pounds each, plus one piece weighing about 100 pounds, are 
expected to come back down to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The debris could hit anywhere on Earth from 28 degrees north to 28 degrees 
south of the Equator. Nearly 80% of that area is water. If the pieces do hit 
land, they could land in an area that includes the extreme southern portion of 
the United States, Africa, Australia, and Central and South America. 
</P>
<P>
A National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokeswoman said the most 
likely date for the re-entry is Saturday.

The average consumer price index for October was up 0.5% in the 12-nation 
European Community, compared with 0.6% in September, the bureau of statistics 
Eurostat reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The small change in the October rate compared with the September rate did not 
affect the 12-month inflation average for the community, which remained at 
5.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Seven members of the communities had individual annual inflation rates below 
5.3%: the Netherlands, at 1.3%; West Germany, 3.1%; France, 3.5%; Belgium, 
3.6%; Luxembourg, 3.9%; Ireland, 4.5%, and Denmark, 5.1%. 
</P>
<P>
The five countries that contributed to driving the rate up were Italy with 
6.5%, Spain with 7.1%, Britain, 7.3%, Portugal, 12.3%, and Greece with 13.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Eurostat said the inflation rate in the United States for the same 12-month

with the prosecution, and scheduled a sentencing hearing for March 21, an 
official in his office said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the plea bargain, the former banker admitted to two counts 
of defrauding the Florida Center Bank of Orlando and conspiracy charges against 
him were dropped, said Edward Garland, Butcher's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Butcher admitted using proceeds from a bank loan for purposes other than those 
stipulated by the loan agreement, Garland said. He was indicted on 19 counts of 
fraud by an Orlando grand jury Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charged that Butcher and several others defrauded the bank of 
about $3 million.

JUSTICES BAR N.Y. BAN ON HOTEL DEMOLITION; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESSNESS: THE COURT RULES THAT THE CITY VIOLATED DEVELOPERS' RIGHTS IN ITS 
BID TO RETAIN HAVENS FOR THE POOR.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court refused today to allow New York City, and perhaps other 
communities, to enlist unwilling developers in the fight against homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, without comment, left intact a victory for developers who said 
New York City violated their rights by banning conversion or demolition of 
hotels that offer a haven for the poor, elderly and ill. 
</P>
<P>
The court let stand a ruling that a law banning conversion or demolition of New 
York City's single-room-occupancy, or SRO, housing unconstitutionally 
confiscates private property. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Court of Appeals ruled, 5 to 2, last July that the law has the 
effect of seizing property without just compensation. 
</P>
<P>
"No one minimizes the tragic reality of homelessness," the state court said. 
"But the city's response -- to foist its responsibility on certain private 
property owners . . . simply does not meet the requirements of the federal and 
state constitutions." 
</P>
<P>
Remedying homelessness is the duty of all taxpayers, not a handful of 
developers, the state court said. It also said the city failed to produce 
enough evidence that the law would actually benefit the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The state court ruling is binding only on cities in New York. But the Supreme 
Court's refusal to disturb that decision may discourage communities in other 
states from emulating New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Notable Supreme Court rulings recently have expanded the rights of property 
owners faced with government regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The justices in 1987 limited government power to grant public access to private 
property and ruled that property owners must be compensated when government 
regulations bar them even temporarily from using their property. 
</P>
<P>
New York Mayor Edward I. Koch called the state court ruling on SRO housing a 
"devastating blow" to efforts to help the homeless. But some city officials 
said rent-control regulations barring unjustified evictions may restrain 
widespread demolition. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, they warned, in time hotel tenants may be bought out or harassed 
into leaving to clear the way for razing the buildings or converting them. 
</P>
<P>
Many tenants live on the edge of poverty and homelessness, limited to single 
rooms and sharing kitchen and bathroom facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The SRO preservation law of 1987 required building owners to rehabilitate and 
rent every unit, not leaving any vacant. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords could have "bought out" of the law by paying $45,000 to the city for 
each unit destroyed or converted. A typical hotel owner would have had to pay 
about $10 million to destroy or convert the building. 
</P>
<P>
The state court said such payments amounted to an extortionate "ransom . . . to 
avoid the illegal confiscation." 
</P>
<P>
The law was meant to prevent about 52,000 units of SRO housing from being 
demolished. Tens of thousands of similar units were razed in the 1960s and 
1970s as the city encouraged new office buildings and luxury apartments. 
</P>
<P>
The city cited studies showing that the loss of such housing contributes to 
rising homelessness. Surveys indicate that at least 25%, and perhaps as many as 
45%, of the people living in the city's homeless shelters at one time lived in 
such hotels.

Union workers at South Korea's Kia Motor Corp. are threatening to strike this 
week and could hit supplies of the popular Festiva subcompact to Ford Motor Co. 
dealers abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Ford holds a 10% stake in Kia and contracted with the South Korean company in 
1986 to make the Festiva. 
</P>
<P>
Kia, South Korea's third-largest auto maker, estimates that it shipped 68,000 
Festivas overseas under the Ford name in the first 10 months of this year, 
compared to about 60,000 in the same period of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Kia said today that the workers seemed set on confrontation over 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
A union leader said Kia factory workers are angry that their benefits are lower 
than those paid at the two other major South Korean car makers, Daewoo Motor 
Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
The union leader said a 10-day mandatory cooling-off period is to expire 
Thursday and added, "If management doesn't compromise by Wednesday, we will go 
on a full strike from Thursday."

'FUTURE' FUELS THE BOX OFFICE; WEEKEND MAY TOP $100 MILLION 
</P>

<P>
Hollywood movie studio executives were still counting receipts from the 
five-day Thanksgiving weekend this afternoon, but one thing they were sure of: 
It was the biggest Thanksgiving weekend ever, perhaps topping the $100-million 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, "Back to the Future, Part II" jumped to the top of the chart, 
taking in about $40 million at 1,866 screens between Wednesday's opening and 
Sunday's last show. The sequel to the 1985 box office smash did $7.7 million 
opening night and went on to out-gross the previous Thanksgiving holiday champ, 
"Rocky V," which also opened in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Although "Harlem Nights," backed by the superstar power of Eddie Murphy, held 
on to the No. 2 spot in its second weekend with $11.1 million, "Back to the 
Future" led a holiday weekend surge of family dramas and children's movies: 
Disney's animated fairy tale "The Little Mermaid" claimed the No. 3 spot with a 
strong $8.4 million, followed by Tri-Star's tenacious fall hit "Look Who's 
Talking" ($7.9 million) and ensemble drama "Steel Magnolias" ($7 million); Don 
Bluth's animated Disney challenge, "All Dogs Go to Heaven" ($5 million); 
Orion's live-action reindeer fantasy, "Prancer" (estimated $ 3.9 million); 
Universal's father-son reunion, "Dad" ($2.9 million); and Tri-Star's outdoor 
adventure "The Bear" ($2.3 million). 
</P>
<P>
Industry box office analysts estimated that the take from this Thanksgiving 
will be 60% higher than it was one year ago.

NEW, IMPROVED AND FUNNIER ANN JILLIAN LAUNCHES TV ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VERNON SCOTT, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ann Jillian you see assaulting the airwaves these days is a new, improved 
model. 
</P>
<P>
She's less blonde, more subdued, no longer the glossy -- sometimes brassy -- 
glamour girl she was when she first hit Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
And she's lightened up from the sometimes heavy drama she has been doing in 
"Ellis Island," "Convicted: A Mother's Story," "Mae West" and the on- and 
off-screen melodrama chronicled in her autobiography, "The Ann Jillian Story." 
</P>
<P>
The sojourn into heavy material improved her timing and technique for comedy, 
which she uses in three major television projects set to air within days of 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's two-hour NBC movie "Little White Lies" begins The Ann Jillian 
Television Festival with the actress-singer portraying a policewoman -- which 
she knows quite a little about because she's married to a cop. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the Thursday airing of the pilot to the "Ann Jillian" series, 
which settles into its regular Sunday slot on Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Little White Lies' is a romantic comedy with Tim Matheson playing my love 
interest. I play a policewoman. He's a doctor and they hide their professional 
identities when they first meet, but then they fall in love," says Jillian. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the kind of light comedy the movies used to make in the '40s and '50s. I 
think we've really captured the same romantic feeling," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On her new series, Jillian plays a widow with a 14-year-old daughter. She's an 
ex-Radio City Music Hall Rockette and a New Yorker who moves to a small 
California town. It's a sitcom dealing with the complicated relationship 
between mother and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd describe this show as being close to the heart. I've never been a mother, 
but I've played a few in other projects and I have a lot of friends with 
teen-age daughters. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel comfortable in the role with Lisa Rieffel, who plays my daughter. 
Working with Lisa is such a pleasure I'd like to have a teen-age girl of my 
own."

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: MEDICINE NOT ONLY METHOD TO LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON and TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My blood pressure is 180 over 110. My doctor has tried Minipress, 
Capoten, Calan and Tenex. Each brings my blood pressure under control but 
causes impotence. 
</P>
<P>
Within days of stopping, my erection returns. Is there any blood pressure 
medicine that doesn't interfere with an erection? I hate to give up sex at the 
age of 48. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Is it possible that you could lower your blood pressure without 
medicine? If you are overweight, losing the spare tire can often make a big 
difference in blood pressure. Exercise, special diet (more vegetarian fare 
without salt) and relaxation techniques can all be helpful. Consult your doctor 
about such a program. 
</P>
<P>
Although you have tried a number of different medicines, there are many other 
options. 
</P>
<P>
A urologist may be able to work with your regular doctor to find the right drug 
for you. Our most recent book, "50 Plus" (Bantam Books), has a chapter on 
sexual side effects of medicine, including an analysis of blood pressure pills. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I am a health-conscious 67-year-old woman. I eat oat bran twice a day and 
watch my diet very carefully, with no red meat, eggs or dairy products. Even 
so, my cholesterol is around 220. 
</P>
<P>
I was fascinated to read that Metamucil can lower cholesterol. I don't need the 
laxative action. Can it be eaten dry or sprinkled on cereal, or does it have to 
be put in a glass of water? 
</P>
<P>
A. Metamucil and other psyllium-fiber products might cause trouble if they are 
taken dry. Intestinal blockage has been reported in some persons who have not 
gotten enough liquid into their system to keep this fiber moving. 
</P>
<P>
Although Metamucil can reduce high cholesterol levels by 5% to 15%, check with 
your doctor before you slave to lower your cholesterol any further. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you have other risk factors such as high blood pressure or heart 
disease, a cholesterol level of 220 might not be too dangerous for a woman your 
age.

Although fame and fortune have brightened the future of Michael J. Fox, the 
"Back to the Future" actor does admit success has a dark side. 
</P>
<P>
"After Rebecca Schaeffer was killed, people said, 'Doesn't that scare you?' Of 
course it scares me," Fox said, referring to the actress who was gunned down, 
allegedly by a disturbed fan. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not lunatic about it," Fox said in the Dec. 4 issue of People 
magazine. "We lock the doors like everybody else. But who wants to live in a 
cocoon?" 
</P>
<P>
Last year, while Fox was shooting "Casualties of War" on location in Thailand, 
his wife, Tracy Pollan, began receiving threatening letters. The woman who 
allegedly wrote them is now in a California psychiatric facility awaiting trial 
on five counts of making terroristic threats. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just shrug it off and say, 'Well, I'm a celebrity. It comes with the 
territory,' " Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has hired bodyguards, but added: "It's key that you live as normal a 
life as possible. I don't subscribe to the theory that you surround yourself 
with a phalanx of meat and guns."

got just a 0.8 rating and a 2 share, according to ESPN, the cable network that 
televised the match on a two-hour tape-delay basis. 
</P>
<P>
The rating is the percentage of sets in the United States tuned to the game. 
The share is the percentage of those sets on at the time that are tuned in to 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Soltys, an ESPN spokesman, said the numbers mean that approximately 
432,000 sets were watching the match, the most significant for U.S. soccer in 
40 years. The game was opposite several live NFL broadcasts, including games 
involving the New York Giants, the Rams and the Raiders.

In a mile race for 2-year-olds on Nov. 11 during Oak Tree at Santa Anita, 
Effusive Bounty, carrying 112 pounds, started out seventh in a 10-horse field. 
The horse quickly moved to third and entered the stretch running second. In the 
stretch, Effusive Bounty passed the fading Due to the King and won going away 
by 1 3/4 lengths. The payoff was a sweet $75.20 for $2. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 5, 1988, the first day of last year's Oak Tree season, Petronack, 
carrying 115 pounds, in a 6 1/2-furlong maiden claiming race, started out last 
in an 11-horse field. Petronack rallied early, moved into fifth by the stretch 
and ended up winning by one length over Singularly Shady. Petronack paid a 
lofty $133.20 for $2. 
</P>
<P>
These two long shots were carrying the lowest weights in their fields. During 
the 1989 Oak Tree season at Santa Anita, at least one lightweight won on 21 
days out of the 32-day season. And the year before, the Oak Tree season saw at 
least one lightweight win on 18 days out of 27. 
</P>
<P>
Not only do the lightweights win often enough, but whenever they put their 
noses across the finish line first, they pay good prices. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in 1989, Oak Tree winners included More Than Green, $21.40; Justo 
Brown, $21.60; Prime Concord, $24.40 and $42.60; I Live the Dream, $22.80; 
Sanger Chief, $28.20; Lots of Gas, $34.20; Pass Another Tab, $23; Puppet Show, 
$34.60, and Our Brave, $24. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, longshots that won at Oak Tree included John's Lady Luck, $28; 
Speaking Part, $31.80; Magic Leader, $22.60; Bolchina, $32.40; Reasonable Raj, 
$29.60; Advancing Ways, $27.20; Wait Till Monday, $48.20; Frisk Me Not, $20.40, 
and King of Lemhi, $20. 
</P>
<P>
Along with these huge payoffs, however, comes lots of action for professional 
and novice alike, total enjoyment, many visits to the cashier's window and 
generally an exciting run for your money. 
</P>
<P>
The system is easy to work. All you need are the day's entries and the final 
weights of all the horses in each race. 
</P>
<P>
Then simply bet to win the horse with the lightest weight. If two horses are 
tied with the lightest weight, then bet the two. However, when more than two 
are tied for the lightest weight, skip the race. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes four races qualify during the day, sometimes nine or 10. Most of the 
time you will only bet seven or eight races. 
</P>
<P>
Experts like to point out, however, there is only one winner per race, except 
in the case of a dead heat, and bettors are wasting their money when they bet 
two horses to win. Disregard such nonsense, no matter how convincing the 
experts may seem, because the high payoffs will enable you to lose one bet on 
one horse and win the other without putting a dent in your bankroll. 
</P>
<P>
Play the two horses. I discovered it doesn't pay to guess between them. It just 
doesn't work. Backing two horses in the same race may be considered deadly when 
playing other systems and individual races, but with these kinds of nags and 
payoffs, it's entirely different. 
</P>
<P>
Since at least one lightweight horse wins most days of the season, some 
handicappers combine the system with money management, either doubling up on 
bets to a certain point or using some other simple progression. I like to bet 
it straight up, however, and take my chances. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the low weights result when a five-pound weight allowance is given to 
apprentice jockeys. Therefore, inexperience in the saddle more than likely will 
account for some of the losers. However, when these "bug" jocks do win, the 
price generally makes up for their losing rides. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how a day with the lightweights would have worked. Consider Nov. 9 at 
Oak Tree. In the first race, Rip Cut, a 12-1 long shot, was the lowest weight 
in the field. It ran fourth and you were out $2. 
</P>
<P>
In the second race, No Story, carrying low weight of 116 pounds, made its move 
in the stretch and won by a half-length. The horse paid $17.40. Since you had 
bet $4 so far, your profit after two races was $13.40. 
</P>
<P>
The third race, with six horses entered, came up with two horses that 
qualified, both carrying 116 pounds. Kiss 'Em Again and Popping Champagne. 
</P>
<P>
Kiss 'Em Again, running second most of the race, pulled ahead in the stretch 
and won by 1 3/4 lengths, paying $4.60. Popping Champagne, which led until the 
stretch, faded to fourth. Winnings for the race were 60 cents, which, added to 
the $13.40, would have put your profit at $14. 
</P>
<P>
Then you would have lost $2 on the fifth race and another $2 on the sixth, 
cutting your winnings to $10. 
</P>
<P>
But the seventh was the one to make your day. Flint, carrying 114 pounds in a 1 
1/8-mile race, went to the lead just after the start of the race. It then made 
its move, took the lead, and went wire to wire to win by a length. 
</P>
<P>
Flint rewarded its backers by paying $25.60. Since two horses in the race were 
tied at 114 pounds, you would have bet both, and your profit for the race would 
have been $21.60. Added to the $10, you then would have had winnings of $31.60 
for the day. 
</P>
<P>
And, as it turned out, no horse qualified for the eighth and ninth races. Thus, 
you would have gone home a $31.60 winner. 
</P>
<P>
Another good example was Oct. 9, 1988, when three lightweight horses won out of 
10 betting races. However, no system horses won until the seventh and losses 
until that race would have been $14 for the six races. 
</P>
<P>
Reasonable Raj, carrying 110 pounds in a six-furlong sprint, was the bet in the 
seventh. Reasonable Raj forced the early going in second, pushing Christmas 
Help, which finally faded at the half-mile post. Reasonable Raj then took the 
lead and won by a head after being pressed by Cresting Water in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
The horse paid $29.60 to win, for a profit of $27.60. After deducting the $14 
lost on the first six races, winnings amounted to a neat $13.60. 
</P>
<P>
Nasr El Arab, another system horse with 121 pounds up, won the eighth, a 1 
1/2-mile route, by two lengths. Nasr El Arab paid backers $10.40, pushing the 
day's winnings, after deducting the $2 bet, to $22. In the ninth race, the 
system horse, Lickety Splitter, ran second at odds of almost 10-1, and cut the 
profit to $20. 
</P>
<P>
In the tenth, betting was on Aqua Russo, which carried 109 pounds. Going off 
the favorite in a 1 1/16 race, Aqua Russo took the lead on the far turn and won 
easily by five lengths. It paid $6.40 to win for a $4.40 profit. Total winnings 
for the day came to $24.40. 
</P>
<P>
Why do lightweight horses win? 
</P>
<P>
One expert claims: "Weight, as the saying goes, will stop a freight train." It 
not only will do that, but it will bring a field of horses so close together 
that the longest shot in the field -- and it usually is the one with the 
lightest weight -- is often the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it's easier for a horse to run with less weight on its back, 
compared to the horse that picks up weight. It's the track's "secretary" who 
assigns the weights, and all he's interested in is getting all the noses to the 
finish line at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
As long as many of the stiffs can't be elevated to where they are equal to the 
"class" horses, then the "class" horses are weighted down to bring them down to 
the level of the stiffs. 
</P>
<P>
The strange thing about horse racing is that theories can be knocked flatter 
than a pancake. What holds true in one race may not in the next. It's apparent 
that a light steed matched against a heavier one has a good chance to win -- 
and does it big on many occasions!

Dangerous track conditions forced officials to cancel the last six of eight 
races Sunday at Finger Lakes Race Track. 
</P>
<P>
Track officials said jockeys found the track conditions too dangerous to race 
after the first two races had been run. 
</P>
<P>
An overnight rain storm left water standing on the track surface, under which 
the ground had frozen during a recent cold snap, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday is the last day of racing for Finger Lakes' 54-day fall meet.
