CHILD ABUSE CASES INCREASE

<TEXT>
<P>
The statistics on child abuse are truly saddening. However, your articles 
failed to mention the ultimate child abuse -- killing children before they see 
the light of day. 
</P>
<P>
The entire cycle of abortion, child abuse, spousal abuse and abuse of the 
elderly and euthanasia are symptoms of growing stress and anxiety in our 
society that no amount of money will ever prevent. A spiritual reawakening of 
moral values is necessary from the top down. 
</P>
<P>
Our society's values are truly backwards and confused.

In response to two Times articles, "Report on Child Abuse Finds Agencies 
Deluged" and "County Delays Cutting Mental Health Funding Amid Pleas for 
Services" (Nov. 14): 
</P>
<P>
Mental health funds should not be reduced! Los Angeles County must see the 
correlation between mental illness, the abuser and the effect on the abused. 
Yes, children addicted to drugs or alcohol do need protection and therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, government agencies should communicate with one another about individual 
cases. We need the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health to serve 
children, families and adults. 
</P>
<P>
I urge Pete Wilson to find the funds to support the Los Angeles County 
Department of Mental Health and urge the public to call their county 
supervisors to register their concerns. The abused frequently becomes the 
abuser in the next generation. Help stop the cycle! Help save our children and 
the future adults of Los Angeles County!

In response to Sheryl Stolberg's Nov. 14-15 articles on child abuse, it is no 
surprise to us that one child a week in Los Angeles County dies at the hands of 
his or her caretaker. We have worked in the area of child abuse prevention, 
teaching preschool through high-school-age children what their rights are in 
relation to unacceptable treatment. 
</P>
<P>
We have also taught teachers, administrators and parents precisely what 
constitutes abuse. 
</P>
<P>
One point not mentioned is that in the beginning of the 1990 fiscal year, Gov. 
George Deukmejian eliminated the $10.1 million designated for child abuse 
prevention programs from the budget, thus wiping out 80 programs statewide. 
While these programs were active, we worked to expose the abusers, educate and 
instill laws that protect the children. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the advocates for the children have been stopped cold, we can only 
expect the violence to proliferate. It's too bad that the Inter-Agency Council 
on Child Abuse and Neglect released its statistics after the elections. We can 
only hope that Gov.-elect Pete Wilson sees fit to reinstate funds to revive the 
statewide prevention programs.

HOW GENDER BIAS CREEPS INTO COURTS; 
</P>
<P>
JUDICIAL COUNCIL PROPOSALS ARE BRILLIANTLY TO THE POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The workings of the state Judicial Council appear to be grist for cocktail 
conversations among lawyers but of little interest to anyone else. But the 
recent recommendations of the council -- the constitutionally mandated body 
that sets rules for courts and standards of judicial administration -- should 
interest anyone who may ever set foot in a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations attack gender bias in the legal system in ways so specific 
that they will likely affect any woman who walks into court. And because this 
comes from the powerful council, there's no doubt that all of the 67 
recommendations will become court rules once the details are worked out. Those 
rules make California a leader among states. 
</P>
<P>
A council report concluded last March that women, be they attorneys, witnesses 
or otherwise, generally were perceived as having less credibility than men. 
That's not a problem unique to the legal system. But courts exist in the 
context of assumed fairness and impartiality. To the degree rhetoric and 
reality fail to meet, faith in the rule of law and the legal system itself 
erodes. That's why the council's effort to combat anti-female bias in its own 
ranks is vital. 
</P>
<P>
The council recommendations address ways to curb both egregious and subtle 
discrimination against women in the legal system. There are the obvious 
offenses: a judge who calls one attorney Mr. Johnson and the other "honey" or 
"Mary" -- an attorney who refers to the other attorney as "this babe." But 
there are the subtle, more common biases that illustrate the way in which 
"business as usual" in the legal system sets up barriers to equal justice for 
women. A key example is the courts' way of allocating court personnel and 
resources, which the council found was biased against family and juvenile cases 
-- which disproportionately affect women and children. One prominent jurist 
told of presiding for 10 days over a civil trial involving a $100,000 dispute 
between two companies; later, when she was in dependency court presiding over 
custody and child abuse cases, she was expected to deal with 30 to 40 cases a 
day, with each case involving an average of 2.5 children. So, 10 days for 
$100,000 for a company, or 10 days for crucial cases involving 1,000 children. 
Nothing could tell the story better than that. The council has decided that the 
system must re-order its priorities. 
</P>
<P>
The specifics for changing procedures will take time. But the process of 
sensitizing the system has already begun. Many judges are learning more about 
how gender bias creeps into language. Soon gender-neutral language will be 
required in all local court rules, documents and jury instructions. 
</P>
<P>
The council's gender-bias work was one of the last official acts of former 
state Chief Justice Rose Bird. Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas played an admirable 
role in keeping the issue alive; a racial and ethnic bias committee is in the 
works. The council can't rid society of its prejudices, but justice demands 
that the legal system be held to a higher standard.

DEADLINE COULD SPEED UP THE TIMETABLE; 
</P>
<P>
ANOTHER U.N. RESOLUTION COULD FOCUS HUSSEIN ON THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the end of this week the U.N. Security Council will have debated, and most 
probably approved, a resolution that in so many words sanctions the possible 
use of force if Iraq doesn't end its occupation of Kuwait within a fixed time. 
Washington is confident that its missionary work among the 15 council members 
in behalf of the resolution has been successful; it would not put U.S. 
diplomatic prestige at risk by plunging ahead in an enterprise whose outcome 
was uncertain. Washington wants to see a firm date set for Iraq to leave 
Kuwait. Jan. 1 has been mentioned, though U.S. officials say a specific 
deadline is negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the 11th U.N. resolution demanding Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait. 
Its intent makes it clearly the most momentous. But is it needed? Probably. A 
few thoughts: 
</P>
<P>
 1. An unmet deadline wouldn't imply that war becomes an inevitability the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, such a deadline would make war highly unlikely before the mentioned 
date, even though the U.S. position is that it retains full freedom of action 
no matter what the U.N. resolves. To be sure, a hostile act by Iraq could set 
off a confrontation at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 2. A U.N. resolution allowing force to be used against Iraq is politically 
desirable. 
</P>
<P>
It is, and for the same reason that inheres in the paradoxical experience that 
one of the most effective ways to keep the peace is by arming securely for 
possible battle. Concrete international support for using the military option 
as a last resort is needed precisely to add credibility to the political 
measures already taken, most especially the Security Council resolutions 
condemning Iraq's aggression and demanding that it disgorge its conquest. 
</P>
<P>
 3. The deadline is worth trying. 
</P>
<P>
The continuing buildup of a multinational force in the Arabian desert has so 
far done nothing to intimidate Iraq. Neither has the message that has been so 
insistently pressed on Baghdad by Soviet, Egyptian and other leaders that the 
United States and its allies aren't bluffing. From all appearances, Hussein 
continues to believe that time is on his side, that his antagonists will soon 
weary of the standoff and that the coalition arrayed against him will collapse, 
leaving him in possession of his conquest and the dominantly coercive political 
and military power in the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
It is vital for the larger cause of peace that this calculation be disproved, 
that Iraq's aggression not only be condemned but, if sanctions and political 
pressures fail to work in a timely way, that the stage be set to roll back that 
aggression by other means. The council resolution that is likely to be passed 
this week aims above all else at fixing Saddam Hussein's mind on that dire 
possibility.

PAY RAISES FOR STATE OFFICIALS, PAY CUTS FOR POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Nov. 14, The Times carried an article ("Aged Poor, Disabled to Lose Benefits 
Raise") that reported that the state planned to keep the $17-a-month (per 
recipient) cost-of-living increase from the federal government rather than pass 
it on to the aged, poor and disabled, thereby "saving" $58 million -- a small 
fraction of the projected state income shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
And what were the plans for the money saved? The answer came in a Nov. 16 
article ("Raise for Governor, Legislators Endorsed"). The raises mentioned were 
in the thousands per month category. This must be a government version of Robin 
Hood -- take from the poor and give to the rich!

<P>
GULF CRISIS: AMERICANS KNOW THE STAKES, AND THEY WON'T SUPPORT A GROUND 
OFFENSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD N. LUTTWAK, Edward M. Luttwak holds the Arleigh Burke Chair in 
Strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By spending the Thanksgiving holiday with the troops, President Bush again 
emphasized the parallels with the epic conflict of his youth. Saddam Hussein is 
Hitler, Kuwait is 1939 Poland, Saudi Arabia is the besieged England of 1940, 
and he himself is the Churchill of the hour. In the meantime, key members of 
Congress who do not share his boyish enthusiasm have begun to act. In the 
Senate, the very powerful Sam Nunn is about to open the hearings of his very 
powerful Armed Services Committee, which has the determining voice in all major 
military decisions. In the House, the formidable Lee Hamilton will concurrently 
open the hearings of his Foreign Relations Committee -- the same committee that 
blocked Ronald Reagan's secret war against Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Nunn nor Hamilton believes that Hussein should be allowed to have his 
way. Along with a majority in Congress, both are convinced that Iraqi military 
power must be demolished in one way or another. But Nunn and Hamilton are 
accurately reflecting the new mood in American public opinion in opposing a 
ground war that would cost thousands of American lives. 
</P>
<P>
During the last 100 days of crisis, Americans have had the opportunity to find 
out what Kuwait was, what Saudi Arabia is and what America's allies amount to. 
There are no street protests about the virtual absence of Japanese and European 
troops in Saudi Arabia (except for the quasi-symbolic British and French 
contingents), but the facts have registered well, and the loss of American 
lives to secure cheap oil mainly for Europeans and Japanese has become totally 
unacceptable to a growing majority of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery that pre-invasion Kuwait was ruled by a small, greedy oligarchy, 
and that young Kuwaitis in Saudi Arabia are idling in luxury hotels while 
American women soldiers are preparing for war in the desert, has done its part 
in reducing enthusiasm for any costly liberation of Kuwait. As for Saudi 
Arabia, the widely reported episode of the women drivers and their punishment 
by order of a fanatical cleric, has greatly simplified exotic complexities. 
Whatever it is, Saudi Arabia clearly is not an embattled democracy. The more 
President Bush insists on treating Kuwaitis and Saudis as friends and allies 
whose welfare deserves the sacrifice of American lives, the more he diverges 
from American public opinion -- and that, of course, is the leading cause of 
the huge drop in the President's popularity as revealed by the polls. 
</P>
<P>
What has not changed is the determination to destroy the power of Iraq, and the 
rejection of any diplomatic solution that would leave Hussein with any gains. 
Given the opposition to any war that would kill thousands of Americans, the 
equation could in theory be resolved in two quite different ways: indefinite 
continuation of the embargo, or the use of air power alone. 
</P>
<P>
But the President has now closed the first option, which would have required 
two or three years to reduce the Iraqi economy to its indigenous state -- 
without cars, electricity or anything else that depends on imports. It would 
have been hard to wait that long with 200,000 American troops in Saudi Arabia; 
with 400,000 men and women, including many reservists abruptly taken away from 
their families, it is quite impossible. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves only bombardment -- not a "surgical strike" but two or three weeks 
of air operations during which Iraqi military installations and supply columns 
would be bombed, photographed and bombed again -- until the Iraqis in Kuwait 
are starved out and nothing remains of Saddam Hussein's dreams of power. 
</P>
<P>
If President Bush ignores public opinion and decides on a ground war in the 
absence of an Iraqi capitulation, and if the expected thousands are killed in 
the desert, even a total victory would not prevent his political destruction. 
That is what Nunn and Hamilton are now urgently telling him.

MORNING BRIEFING: SHOOTING AT WILL, HE OPENS SOME WOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Donald Kagan, a classics professor at Yale, decided it was time to go upside 
George Will's pointy head. 
</P>
<P>
Kagan criticized Will's book, "Men at Work: The Craft of Baseball," in the 
current issue of the Public Interest, a quarterly that usually covers domestic 
policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to Will's statement that "games are won by a combination of informed 
aggression and prudence based on information," Kagan wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"This is the fantasy of a smart, skinny kid who desperately wants to believe 
that brains count more than the speed, power and reckless courage of the big 
guys who can play." 
</P>
<P>
Add Yale prof: Kagan wrote that Cincinnati's World Series sweep against one of 
Will's favorites, Oakland Manager Tony LaRussa, showed "how totally irrelevant 
all this masterminding is." 
</P>
<P>
Adding that baseball was "not meant to be a track meet," Kagan said that the 
running game has become the "modern substitute for the most difficult part of 
the game and its lifeblood -- hitting." 
</P>
<P>
Last add Yale prof: In a response to Kagan's criticism, published in the same 
issue of the Public Interest, Will wrote that the running game is "a substitute 
for standing around and waiting for someone to hit the ball hard enough to wake 
up the Kagans who are dozing in the stands, uninterested in anything more 
subtle than a three-run home run." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who holds the NBA record for the most consecutive complete games 
in one season? 
</P>
<P>
Pontiac Blues: A few days before the Detroit Lions came out of their stupor 
with a 40-27 Thanksgiving Day victory over Denver, the Detroit News set up a 
hot line and asked fans to submit new names for the Lions' pass-oriented 
run-and-shoot offense. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
"Shoot-and-Miss." 
</P>
<P>
"Sanders Limited," a complaint that running back Barry Sanders wasn't getting 
the ball enough. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim Arnold's Weekly Workout," referring to the Lions' punter. 
</P>
<P>
And, calling attention to the Lions' diminutive pass catchers, "Honey, I Shrunk 
the Receivers." 
</P>
<P>
A pretty sum: When center Doug Gilmour of the Calgary Flames plays the lead 
role in "The Peter Revson Story," a film about the life of the playboy race car 
driver who died in a practice run in 1974, he will be protected against facial 
and physical injury -- by a helmet, a mask, a seat belt and a $5-million 
insurance policy with Lloyd's of London. 
</P>
<P>
Just keep talking: Phoenix Cardinal defensive end Dexter Manley, who was 
reinstated last week by NFL Commisioner Paul Tagliabue after serving two years 
of a "lifetime" ban for drug use, recently recalled a moment from his rookie 
season with the Washington Redskins nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
While leaving RFK Stadium, he saw Redskin quarterback Joe Theismann stopped at 
a traffic light, surrounded by adoring fans. 
</P>
<P>
Said Manley: "People were buzzing around him and I was just amazed," Manley 
said. "I turned to my girlfriend and said, 'I want to be like that one day.' " 
</P>
<P>
Streak plus one: Miami senior tackle Mike Sullivan recently reflected on the 
fact that during his career, the Hurricanes never lost a regular-season game at 
the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sullivan: "If possible, I'd love to get married there." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Wilt Chamberlain of Philadelphia, with 47 between Jan. 5 and 
Mar. 14, 1962.

ON A WHITE NIGHT, OILERS UPEND BILLS;

BUFFALO: HOUSTON RUNNING BACK OUTPLAYS THOMAS, UPSTAGES KELLY, MOON IN 27-24 
VICTORY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Warren Moon and Jim Kelly played to a virtual standoff, but the Houston Oilers 
surprisingly had the edge when it came to Lorenzo White and Thurman Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
White had his career-best game for rushing and receiving yardage Monday night, 
leading the Oilers past the Buffalo Bills, 27-24, and completing a week in 
which all six NFL division leaders lost. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offensive line was ferocious and unrelenting," White said. "It takes a 
while for the line in this system to get used to the run. Once I get the hole I 
can create things. It was just like it's drawn up on the board." 
</P>
<P>
Houston (6-5) created a three-way tie with Cincinnati and Pittsburgh for the 
AFC Central lead, while the Bills (9-2), whose eight-game losing streak was 
ended, dropped into a tie for the AFC East lead with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
White rushed 18 times for 125 yards and caught five passes for 89 yards. His 
previous best rushing total was 113 and his best receiving was 82, both last 
season. Thomas was held to 54 yards in 15 carries and caught four passes for 32 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"They were in pass defense most of the night," Pardee said. "They had six guys 
back and five up front. You have to be able to count. We got White going." 
</P>
<P>
White, who has taken heat for his fumbles and lack of production this season, 
"was wired tight," Pardee said. 
</P>
<P>
Moon's 28-yard pass to White positioned the Oilers for a three-yard scoring 
pass to Leonard Harris, giving Houston a 27-17 lead with 7:21 left. 
</P>
<P>
"White was fantastic," Moon said. "He knew he was going to be called upon the 
way they were dropping people back." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas scored on a two-yard run with 3:29 left to trim Houston's lead, but the 
Oilers ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Moon completed 16 of 22 passes for 300 yards and two touchdowns; Kelly was 23 
of 34 for 224 yards and two scores. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it would be a matter of who had the ball last," Kelly said. "We had 
confidence we could score again. But give them credit." 
</P>
<P>
Moon's 43-yard pass to Drew Hill set up White's one-yard run with 3:14 left in 
the third quarter to give the Oilers a 20-17 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills weren't overly complimentary of White. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're split out like we were, a baby could run through the holes," 
cornerback Nate Odomes said. "I don't mean to take anything away from Lorenzo. 
My hat is off to him." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly gave the Bills a 14-13 lead by hitting Keith McKeller with an 11-yard 
scoring pass 40 seconds before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Norwood's 43-yard field goal made it 17-13 on Buffalo's first possession 
of the third quarter.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: MORSE'S CHERRY AMONG THREE TO SIGN WITH THE AZTECS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three high school seniors have signed national letters-of-intent to play 
basketball at San Diego State, Aztec Coach Jim Brandenburg said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The three are Darnell Cherry, a 6-foot-10 forward from Morse High School; 
Marcus Banks, a 6-9 forward-center from East Central High in San Antonio; and 
John Molle, a 6-5 guard-forward from Irvine High. 
</P>
<P>
Cherry averaged 14 points, 10 rebounds and four blocked shots as a junior last 
season. Banks averaged 17 points and 7 1/2 rebounds a game as a junior. In 
three games this season, he is averaging 28 points, 10 rebounds and six blocked 
shots a game. Molle averaged 20.9 points and 7.5 rebounds per game. He shot an 
Irvine High-record 89% from the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
The University of San Diego men's and women's basketball teams have each signed 
a player to a national letter of intent. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton Madden, a 6-0 guard from Bakersfield South High School, signed to play 
for the USD men's team. Madden was a first-team all-Kern County selection as a 
sophomore and a junior. He led the county last year in scoring with a 27-point 
average. Playing mostly point guard, he also averaged seven assists and six 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Signing with the USD women's team was Brittany Volk, a 5-11 guard from Oregon's 
Tigard High School. Volk averaged 8.6 points, 3.6 assists and 2.1 steals per 
game in leading Tigard to a 20-7 mark. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego State baseball team has signed eight players to national letters 
of intent, Coach Jim Dietz said. 
</P>
<P>
The most prominent is Jose Silva, a right-handed pitcher from Hilltop High. 
Silva was one of the most highly recruited players in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU also signed two pitchers from Fresno City Community College: right-hander 
Jeff Johnson and left-hander Richie Juarez. 
</P>
<P>
The five others to sign with the Aztecs: Mike Barber, a right-handed pitcher 
from Mt. San Antonio College; Benji Grigsby, a right-handed pitcher from Lassen 
Community College (Susanville, Calif.); Jay Hassel, a right-handed pitcher from 
Rancho Santiago Community College; Malcolm Warfield, an outfielder from 
Columbus Academy (Columbus, Ohio); and Ryan Nettles, a third baseman from 
Woodrow Wilson High (Tacoma, Wash.). 
</P>
<P>
Nettles is the son of former major leaguer Jim Nettles and the nephew of 
all-star third baseman Graig Nettles. 
</P>
<P>
"This is by far the best 10-day recruiting period we've ever had here," Dietz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
INDOOR SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
Sockers goalie Victor Nogueira on Monday was named defensive player of the week 
by the Major Soccer League. In two starts last week, Nogueira made 30 saves and 
lowered his goals-against average from 5.83 to 5.44, third best in the league. 
Nogueira, the only goalie to start all of his team's games (12), leads the 
league with 153 saves. 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont College will play host to Los Angeles Pierce in the second round of 
the Southern California community college playoffs at 7 tonight. The winner 
will advance to the state tournament, which starts Friday at Alan Hancock 
College in Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, Grossmont (18-4) defeated College of the Desert, 15-7, 15-5, 
15-4, while Pierce (18-2) eliminated Chaffey, 9-15, 15-7, 15-2, 15-9. 
</P>
<P>
LeAnne Lopez of Point Loma Nazarene was named first-team NAIA All-America by 
the American Volleyball Coaches Assn. The sophomore setter from Whittier led 
the Crusaders with 1,002 assists and 345 digs in 95 games. Senior outside 
hitter Jamie Wheat of Solana Beach, who led PLNC in kills (254), assists (514) 
and service aces (48), was a third-team choice.

GULLS' TRAVELS CONTINUE WITH ANOTHER VICTORY 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
ALBANY, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Gulls ran their unbeaten string on the road to eight games by defeating 
last-place Albany, 6-3, Tuesday. The victory was the Gulls' sixth in a row, and 
they are now 7-0-1 during the streak. 
</P>
<P>
It was first meeting this season between the Gulls (12-9-2) and the Choppers 
(6-14). The Gulls remained in second place in the Western Division behind 
Peoria (18-2), which was idle. The two teams will play again tonight in Albany 
as the Gulls' longest road trip of the season continues. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy Norton led the Gulls with two goals. Dennis Holland, who has scored at 
least one point in the last nine games, Clark Donatelli, Charlie Simmer and 
Derek Mayer also scored for the Gulls, who trailed 2-1 after the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Norton's first goal tied the game two minutes into the second period. Simmer 
made it 3-2 when he scored 17:10 into the period, then the Gulls broke the game 
open with three goals in the third period. Mayer scored to make it 4-2, then 
Holland scored his 20th point in the last nine games, and Norton capped it with 
his second goal with under two minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls have scored four times in their last eight power-play situations. 
They've scored 35 goals on the power play this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Our power play has been clicking of late," Gulls Coach Mike O'Connell said. 
"We're getting some chances and we're doing a good job taking advantage of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Goalie Alain Chevrier, making his second consecutive start, stopped 31 of 34 
shots and improved to 2-0 since being sent down by the Detroit Red Wings.

ZEPEDA COMES OFF BENCH TO LEAD SAN FERNANDO, 60-46 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Entering the basketball season as a substitute, San Fernando High's Fernando 
Zepeda figured it was a good idea to make himself noticed. 
</P>
<P>
Zepeda scored a game-high 17 points to pace San Fernando to a 60-46 nonleague 
win over host Birmingham on Monday afternoon, the season opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
"Fernando was a surprise today," Tiger Coach Dick Crowell said. "His stock 
certainly went up." 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando (1-0) led, 26-24, at halftime before going on a 17-8 run in the 
third quarter. George Garcia finished with 14 points and Gabe Vidana scored 12 
for the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham (0-1) was led by sophomore Glenn Lyles, who scored a team-high 11 
points. Kevin Horton added 11 rebounds and six points for the Braves. In other 
nonleague games: 
</P>
<P>
Marshall 58, Van Nuys 47 -- Jahmin Assa scored 27 points and grabbed 13 
rebounds and teammate Thamh Diep added 10 points for Marshall in the opener for 
both teams at Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar 45, Verdugo Hills 35 -- In a low-scoring opener for both teams, Sylmar 
used a 12-point halftime advantage to coast to a nonleague victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans (1-0) were led by 6-foot-4 senior forward Brandon McBride, who 
scored 14 points and grabbed nine rebounds, and senior point guard Kim Shostle 
(14 points). The low offensive output left second-year Coach Larry Link 
worried. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to find some offense," Link said. "We've got to find somebody who can 
score some points. If Brandon keeps out of foul trouble, he can score in 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar will play in the Simi Valley tournament Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We may get blown out of the gym four times," Link said. "But it will be good 
practice for us with regards to our conference." 
</P>
<P>
BOYS' SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando 5, Monroe 1 -- Oscar Arevalo scored two goals and Gadial Palomo, 
Fabian Galvin and Hector Molina scored one each for host San Fernando (1-0) in 
a nonleague game. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood 3, San Pedro 1 -- Walter Cordova, Oswaldo Vega and Ramiro Vega 
each scored one goal for North Hollywood (1-0) at San Pedro in a nonleague 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham 2, Westchester 0 -- Tony Serpas scored two goals and goalies Andy 
Sherman and Willie Palacios recorded the shutout for Birmingham in a nonleague 
opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
GIRLS' BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham 47, San Fernando 37 -- Tracie Harris scored 19 points and Dorrie 
Chang added 11 as Birmingham won a nonleague season opener for both schools at 
San Fernando.

THE PREPS: PLAYOFF DISPUTE OVER GAME SITE IS WON BY LOYOLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The burning question at the CIF Southern Section office Monday was where the 
Loyola High-Canyon Country Canyon Division I semifinal football playoff game 
would be played Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon won the coin flip for the home field, but its on-campus stadium holds 
only about 4,000 people. Loyola officials, fearing a large crowd, asked that 
the game be moved to nearby College of the Canyons, which seats about 7,000. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Welch, Canyon football coach, said he favored playing the game at Canyon 
High. He was supported by the school's administration. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon (11-1) defeated Bishop Amat in the quarterfinals last Friday at Canyon, 
21-20. The game was played before a standing-room-only crowd of 5,000. Loyola 
(10-2) upset Fontana, 10-7, before 8,000 at Glendale High Friday in another 
quarterfinal game. 
</P>
<P>
"We can be a better host at our own place," Welch said yesterday. "Our field is 
in as good a condition as any in Southern California this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
But Bill Clark, the Southern Section administrator in charge of football, 
agreed with Loyola officials and late Monday afternoon ordered that the game be 
played at College of the Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
"The facilities at Canyon are fine, but it's not reasonable as far as seating 
capacity goes," Clark said. "We want everyone to be able to watch the game." 
</P>
<P>
Bill White, Canyon principal, made a late pitch to add extra bleachers to 
accommodate the expected large crowd, but Clark wasn't satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon played two games at College of the Canyons this season, defeating both 
Hart and Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jon Dawson, Loyola athletic director: "Our fans would have filled up their 
visiting bleachers hours before the game. They just didn't have enough seats 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
In another site change Monday, Malibu Camp Kilpatrick moved its Division X 
semifinal game against Mammoth Saturday night from Monroe High in Sepulveda to 
Newbury Park High. Camp Kilpatrick officials were worried about possible gang 
violence around Monroe and feel Newbury Park will be safer. 
</P>
<P>
After going nine weeks without a defeat, Fairfax High's undefeated football 
team barely survived its first-round City 3-A Division playoff game against 
Washington on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax, which finished the regular season as The Times' fifth-ranked City 
team, took an early 21-0 lead, but had to hold off Washington, 35-34. 
</P>
<P>
Before this season, Fairfax was not expected to be a dominant team because of 
its lack of depth. Last season, the Lions had to forfeit their first-round 
playoff game when several two-way starters were declared academically 
ineligible under the City's no-fail rule, which has since been amended. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Lions have nine two-way starters, but the team did not lose one 
player to grades this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We were thrilled to go 9-0 during the regular season," said Fairfax co-Coach 
Ron Price, who shares duties with Earl Smith. "Before the season, we thought 
that we were capable of going 7-2 with a little luck." 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax last won the City 3-A Division in 1985. The team has outscored 
opponents this season, 234-83. The key for the Lions has been the play of 
quarterback-defensive back Rahim Muhammad and running back-defensive back Mario 
Mattison. 
</P>
<P>
Against Washington, Muhammad, a junior, rushed for 219 yards and two touchdowns 
in 13 carries, sealed the victory with an interception on the last play. For 
the season, Muhammad has rushed for 745 yards and 10 touchdowns and passed for 
1,042 yards and nine touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Mattison, a senior, rushed for 156 yards and two touchdowns against Washington. 
Despite missing three games because of injury or illness, Mattison has rushed 
for 852 yards and eight touchdowns in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
For Price and Smith, who coached at Crenshaw for nine years before moving to 
Fairfax three years ago, an undefeated championship season would be a first. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax, seeded first in 3-A, will play Van Nuys Birmingham (9-2) in the 
quarterfinals Friday night at Venice High. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the season, Santa Ana Mater Dei and Van Nuys Montclair Prep 
gained attention when running back Derek Sparks transferred from Montclair Prep 
to Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams struggled during the early part of the season but have rallied in 
the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei, which finished second in the Angelus League, is the surprise team of 
the Division I playoffs after beating top-seeded Rialto Eisenhower, 34-20, last 
Friday. Sparks gained 188 yards and scored two touchdowns. Mater Dei (7-5) will 
play Quartz Hill (10-2) Friday at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
In the Division X playoffs, Montclair Prep has been impressive, defeating 
Riverside St. John's on Friday, 42-0. 
</P>
<P>
Even without Sparks, Montclair Prep's running game has flourished with Eliel 
Swinton, who rushed for 1,607 yards during the regular season, and Neimad 
Durham. Against St. John's, Swinton was injured in the first half and was 
replaced by Kimo Atkins, who rushed for 123 yards in nine carries and scored 
three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep (8-3) will play Village Christian (9-2-1) in the semifinals 
Friday at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
The Carson and Banning football teams, The Times' No. 1- and No. 2-ranked City 
teams, respectively, have a common mission as they head toward another possible 
showdown for the City title: Win it for Bernie Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard J. Donahue died Nov. 18 at the age of 81. He had been retired since 
1970 but is remembered at those schools as the principal who provided the 
support to build the Colts and Pilots into football powers. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Zamperini, who coached track under Donahue at Banning, said: "If there was 
a budget, football got most of it, but he took care of all his coaches pretty 
well. He was very fair. He preferred to hang around with jocks rather than the 
English-lit types. He was a jock at heart." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue was captain and center of the Loyola University team in 1929 and later 
coached football at Torrance and Hamilton high schools before becoming boys' 
vice principal at Banning in 1947 and principal in '57. 
</P>
<P>
When Carson opened in '63, he became its first principal and brought football 
Coach Gene Vollnogle with him. Vollnogle is coaching his last season at the 
school.

Torrey Pines may be playing in foreign territory, but it will have alumni who 
have matriculated to UC Davis, Stanford and UC Santa Cruz to offer support. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, the Torrey Pines girls' volleyball team meets Central Coast Section 
champion St. Francis (Mountain View) in the State Division I semifinal at 
top-ranked St. Francis (42-1).

It marks the first time a San Diego girls' volleyball team has reached the 
third round of the tournament in Division I -- Francis Parker won three state 
titles in Division III -- but Torrey Pines has a handful of players with 
state-tournament experience. 
</P>
<P>
"They're tickled to get this far," Harrah said. "Lack of experience won't have 
an effect. They're playing so well right now, and beating the defending state 
champion Saturday gave us confidence." 
</P>
<P>
The second-ranked Falcons (31-2) sent three-time champion Mira Costa home with 
a 15-17, 15-12, 15-5, 15-9 loss and played what Harrah said was their best 
match of the season. 
</P>
<P>
St. Francis, a strong-serving team, is led by 5-foot-10 senior outside hitter 
Staci Wolfe. Wolfe's sister, freshman Shelli (5-11), is also a starter. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines is a tall, balanced team offensively and defensively. Starters 
Brett Hensel (5-10) and Sarah McCandless (5-10) switch off as setters, Amy 
(5-10) and Christy (5-11) Peters -- no relation -- and Audette Paul (6-2) are 
outside hitters and Kami Schmedding (6-1) is a middle blocker. 
</P>
<P>
Tyffanii Evans, Mira Mesa's 5-9 forward, could be the best jumper in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's anybody in the county that can jump better than her," 
Mira Mesa girls' basketball Coach Gary Blevins said. "She can just jump out of 
the gym. The other day the ball got stuck (between the rim and the backboard) 
and she just flicked it out of there. 
</P>
<P>
"When our boys are playing and that happens they have to go get Tyffanii to get 
it out for them." 
</P>
<P>
The El Cajon Valley girls' basketball team not only ranks among the county's 
top 10 for its playing ability, the Eagles' are probably the smartest team 
around. Just take a look at the team's grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles, who play Hilltop tonight in the first round of the El Cajon 
tournament, have five starters averaging a 4.0 GPA -- Heidi and Heather Holm, 
Nicolle Eskow, Tracy Wilcox and Sara Mease. The entire team's GPA is 3.7. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had anything like that," El Cajon Valley Coach Robert Holm said. 
"I'm very pleased. They are very intelligent and easy to work with. All plan to 
go onto college whether they play basketball or not. They put a lot of time 
into the sport and a lot of time into their studies." 
</P>
<P>
In one way, Rancho Bernardo Coach Rob Sills was relieved that his team did not 
advance to the Section volleyball finals Nov. 17. That was the day he wed 
Andrea Heimbecker. 
</P>
<P>
After the Broncos defeated Kearny in the first round, Sills said, "It's going 
to be interesting. I've already been told I can't coach that night." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Bernardo lost to La Jolla in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the cancellation of the Kiwanis girls' basketball tournament this 
season, Mount Carmel is hunting for games. 
</P>
<P>
Mount Carmel Coach Tracey Johnson is looking for alumni to participate in the 
school's first girls' basketball alumni game Dec. 1 at Sundevil Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it will be annual or not," Johnson said. "But right now we're 
kind of desperate for a game." 
</P>
<P>
Ramona boys' basketball Coach Al Schaffer thinks that his team's home opener 
against Helix Wednesday will be one of the best nonleague matchups this season. 
</P>
<P>
"For a cross-league game, I think it's one of the best," Schaffer said. "The 
bragging rights in the county will be up for grabs right away." 
</P>
<P>
It will be the battle of the centers -- Helix's 7-foot Jason Falconer against 
Ramona's 6-9 Travis Knight. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be a dandy," Schaffer said. "The papers have Helix ranked in 
the top 10. We're expecting a good crowd."

PEOPLE: CONTEMPO CASUALS CEO TO HEAD THRIFTY DRUG CHAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thrifty Corp. has named Eve A. Rich, chairman and chief executive of Contempo 
Casuals women's clothing stores, to lead its Thrifty Drug chain, which has 
faced stiff competition in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Rich, 49, will assume the position of president at the 577-store drug chain on 
Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
The position is a new one at Thrifty, whose stores are located mostly in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Rich had been at Los Angeles-based Contempo Casuals, a division of Neiman 
Marcus Group Inc., for 10 years. Her duties will be assumed by Bernard 
Zeichner, Contempo's president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely pleased to acquire an executive with such experience, a 
successful track record in the retailing industry and extensive knowledge of 
the Southern California specialty retailing market," said Daniel A. Seigel, 
president and chief operating officer of Thrifty Corp. in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Seigel replaced Richard G. Eils as president of Thrifty Corp., which 
also owns Big 5 sporting goods and other retailing operations that total nearly 
1,000 stores and about $3 billion in revenue. Eils, who had been president for 
10 years, resigned to "pursue other interests," the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Profit at Thrifty Corp., which is a subsidiary of Pacific Enterprises, has been 
hurt in recent years by various factors, including price-slashing wars with 
such rivals as Sav-On drugstores. 
</P>
<P>
To improve earnings, Thrifty has said it will close 50 to 100 poorly performing 
drugstores and sporting goods outlets during the next two years. As a result of 
these and other cost-cutting moves, Pacific Enterprises wrote down $100 million 
in Thrifty assets in the second quarter of this year. JESUS SANCHEZ

CHRISTMAS TREE SELLER BRANCHES OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa's Helpers Christmas Tree Express in Van Nuys makes the most of holiday 
themes, so Bob Crosby Jr. doesn't call himself president or chief executive. 
Instead, he's "Head Elf." 
</P>
<P>
Call him an elf or a president, but Crosby didn't think that he had the magic 
touch to make much money selling Christmas trees the old-fashioned way on 
vacant lots around the city. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby has been selling Christmas trees in Los Angeles for 12 years. But 
finding cheap, vacant land and people ready to work for just three weeks during 
the holiday season has become increasingly tough. On top of that, Crosby found 
that the business was always a bit speculative since he had to order the trees 
from farms in Oregon well before he could gauge how sales would go at a given 
site. 
</P>
<P>
But while Christmas tree lot sales were getting tougher, one of Crosby's other 
lines -- selling and delivering 10- to 20-foot trees to banks and the like -- 
was growing faster than he could keep up with, straining his ability to deliver 
the trees. 
</P>
<P>
So Crosby got the idea of having someone else deliver his trees -- namely, 
United Parcel Service -- and the idea is getting its first big test this year. 
Beginning last week, Crosby's freshly cut, home-delivered Christmas trees were 
advertised locally as part of a charity fund-raising drive on KLOS Radio. The 
radio promotions offer delivery "from mountain to doorstep" in fivedays. The 
company has a special phone line to take the KLOS calls, and 15% of the 
proceeds from Christmas trees sold to callers will go to two local charities. 
Crosby has similar arrangements with about 20 radio stations across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby claims that the main advantage of his home-delivered trees is that they 
will arrive fresher because they're shipped soon after being cut and don't sit 
around on a lot -- a particular problem in hot, dry Southern California. The 
problem is so bad that some dealers spray-paint Christmas trees green because 
they have begun to yellow by the time they are sold, although Crosby says he 
doesn't follow this practice at his lots. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for Crosby's home-delivered trees are based on height. For $40, Crosby's 
company will ship a 4-foot tree with a stand anywhere in the country. The 
5-foot trees are $50, the 6-foot trees are $60 and the 7-foot trees are $70. 
Crosby said the trees are easy to set up because they arrive with a stand 
attached. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby is so confident of his idea that even though he sold only about $400,000 
worth of trees last year, he hopes to ship $3 million to $6 million worth (or 
50,000 to 100,000 trees) this year. 
</P>
<P>
The venture is not without risks. Crosby and his father, Bob Crosby, had to put 
up $100,000 for extra phone lines and voice mail equipment to take orders. In 
addition, they had to buy harvest rights on Douglas firs grown on 11 farms in 
northwestern Oregon. The rights allow Crosby's company to cut down the trees on 
those farms any time in the next three or four years. In addition, the company 
will rent about 150 trucks to deliver trees to UPS. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby is not the first to think of home-delivered Christmas trees. For five 
years, L. L. Bean, the big outdoor-clothing company in Freeport, Me., has been 
selling Christmas trees by mail order. L. L Bean ships two sizes of Christmas 
trees via UPS: regular size (5 feet, 4 inches to 6 feet) for $50, or large 
trees (6 to 7 feet) for $60, both sizes without a stand. 
</P>
<P>
And some tree farms offer home-delivered trees to their established customers, 
according to the National Christmas Tree Assn. in Milwaukee. In fact, the 
association estimates that about 1% of the 34.4 million Christmas trees sold in 
the United States last year were mail-order sales, compared with 61% sold on a 
lot and 25% at "choose and cut" farms where customers fell their own trees, 
said Cate Miller, a spokeswoman for the group. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby's company will sell its trees in conjunction with charity groups around 
the country. For instance, in Los Angeles, KLOS will promote Crosby's 
home-delivered trees on the air, giving 15% of the proceeds to the Foundation 
for the Junior Blind, which runs programs for blind people, and International 
Guiding Eyes, which trains seeing-eye dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Nelkane Benton, KLOS' director of community relations, said the station hopes 
that the deal will raise $100,000 for the charities. The arrangement is also 
good business for Crosby, who said that as a result of similar deals across the 
country, Santa's Helpers has virtually no advertising costs. 
</P>
<P>
Once Crosby decided to try the UPS delivery scheme for Christmas trees, the 
main problem was figuring out how to deliver 50,000 to 100,000 trees in just a 
few weeks. Crosby got help from his father, who has design and business 
experience from his computer graphics company. 
</P>
<P>
The system they worked out runs like this: About 16 to 24 telephone operators 
for the company will take orders for trees at its Van Nuys headquarters, then 
send order information to both UPS and the company's tree warehouse in Tangent, 
Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Workers at the tree farms -- all within a few miles of Tangent -- will cut 
enough trees to fill the orders that come in from Van Nuys, then bring the 
trees to the warehouse. There, stands will be attached and the trees will be 
placed in cylindrical shipping containers. From Tangent, the company will truck 
the trees to one of several UPS shipping hubs around the country. UPS will then 
deliver the trees to the buyer's home.

PRODUCTION COMPANY SUIT SAYS STOCK WAS MANIPULATED; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: VENTURA ENTERTAINMENT CONTENDS THAT BROKERAGE FIRMS AND A 
NEWSLETTER WRITER CIRCULATED FALSE RUMORS ABOUT THE FIRM WHILE SHORTING ITS 
SHARES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura Entertainment Group Ltd., taking a swipe at naysayers of the fledgling 
North Hollywood movie and television company, said Monday it sued two 
brokerages and a stock-newsletter writer for allegedly using fraud, 
misinformation and illegal short sales to drive down Ventura's stock price. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, named as defendants Cruttenden 
&amp; Co., a Newport Beach brokerage, and some of its officials; Herzog, Heine, 
Geduld Inc., an investment firm in New York; and Michael Murphy, whose San 
Francisco-based newsletters include the Overpriced Stock Service, which focuses 
on stocks that are candidates for selling short. 
</P>
<P>
All of the defendants said they had not yet seen the suit and therefore had no 
comment, although Murphy said "it seems on the face of it to be pretty silly." 
Murphy said his firm has never shorted the stock, but that on one day, Oct. 12, 
he recommended to callers of his "hot line" telephone number that the stock was 
a short candidate. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as Oct. 29, Cruttenden's analysts also urged customers to take any 
profits in Ventura by selling the stock and repurchasing it only after they 
"see more results" from the company. 
</P>
<P>
In a short sale, a person or firm borrows stock and then sells it with the hope 
that the stock drops in price. If it does, the short seller then buys back the 
stock, returns the shares to the lender, and pockets the difference in price. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, which began operating in May, 1988, plans to produce movies and other 
programs for television. It has produced few shows to date and racked up $3.5 
million in losses between Oct. 31, 1989, and last Sept. 30, including a 
$909,510 loss in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 on revenue of $7.16 million. 
(Ventura recently changed the end of its fiscal year to June 30 from Oct. 31.) 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Ventura has twice sold stock to the public since its founding, 
raising more than $8 million. Its subsidiary, Ventura Motion Picture Group 
Ltd., sold a minority stake in the company to the public in late 1989 and 
raised $5.6 million. Yet despite its losses, Ventura Entertainment's stock 
traded above $10 a share last summer and closed Monday at $8.625, giving the 
company a market value of about $67 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura companies alleged, among other things, that the brokerage firms and 
other defendants circulated false rumors that were critical of Ventura while at 
the same time shorting the stock, in violation of U.S. securities laws and the 
regulations of the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, which governs the 
national over-the-counter market where Ventura's stock trades. 
</P>
<P>
Their alleged purpose was to "drive down the price of the companies' shares to 
a point where the short sellers will make substantial profits at the expense of 
the companies' current shareholders," the suit stated. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura also alleged that the brokerage firms engaged in "naked shorting," in 
violation of new NASD rules that took effect Sept. 1. Naked shorting occurs 
when a firm sells a stock short without first making sure that it can borrow 
the shares that must be delivered to whoever buys the stock. The new rules say 
that brokerages, with the exception of firms that primarily just "make markets" 
in a stock by matching buyers and sellers, must ensure that the shares are 
available before they short the stock. 
</P>
<P>
But Ventura alleged that Herzog, Heine and Cruttenden shorted the stock 
"without having the ability to deliver shares to cover their short positions." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura also said it hired Irving M. Einhorn to advise the company on the case; 
Einhorn formerly headed the Securities and Exchange Commission's Los Angeles 
office.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: EVEREST &amp; JENNINGS LOSES $38 MILLION IN 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everest &amp; Jennings International Ltd., citing restructuring costs, said it 
lost $38.4 million in the third quarter, compared with a $2.84-million loss a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The latest loss was expected. 
</P>
<P>
The Camarillo-based maker of wheelchairs and other medical equipment had last 
week predicted that it would post a "substantial" loss because it would take a 
charge to cover the restructuring costs and the writedown in the value of 
certain assets. The charge totaled $32.4 million for the quarter that ended 
Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Everest &amp; Jenning's revenue in the quarter rose to $53.5 million from $48.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of this year, the company lost $46.5 million on 
revenue of $156.3 million. In the comparable 1989 period, it lost $9.46 million 
on revenue of $138 million.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: MORTGAGE &amp; REALTY TRUST REPORTS 4TH-QUARTER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mortgage &amp; Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust reorganizing under 
federal bankruptcy laws, reported an $11.7-million loss for its fiscal fourth 
quarter because the company set aside $10 million for bad real estate loans. 
</P>
<P>
The loss in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 contrasted with net income of $4.97 
million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the provision for bad loans, Mortgage &amp; Realty's earnings in the 
latest quarter were $3.09 million. 
</P>
<P>
For its full fiscal year, Mortgage &amp; Realty lost $10.4 million, contrasted 
with a $19.9-million profit the previous year. The latest full-year results 
included a $23.8-million provision for real estate losses. 
</P>
<P>
The company filed under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws April 12 
because it defaulted on certain of its debts. Under Chapter 11, a company is 
shielded from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its bills. 
Mortgage &amp; Realty last month announced a tentative agreement with its 
creditors on a reorganization plan.

Lie Down: A group of London lawyers demonstrated last week what some people had 
long suspected -- they are Britain's best liars. The barristers easily snowed 
bankers, models, real estate agents and clergymen in a tournament of Perudo, a 
dice game in which players must lie to win. "I reserve my right to remain 
silent," said lawyer Clare Montgomery. "(Lying) is an essential life skill," 
said player Carl Hindmarch, a magazine editor. Whether the two were lying was

ART BUCHWALD: THEY JUST CAN'T FACE REALITY OF REAL ESTATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Our real estate group therapy class meets on Thursdays at Rebecca Milikowsky's 
house. We discuss how terrible the market is and share with each other the pain 
of living in a world where a house is no longer a ticket to instant wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Blankenship was the first to speak. "I spent all Saturday night baking 
brownies, and on Sunday I put them out on the dining room table with hot apple 
cider. Everybody who showed up ate the brownies, but not one person bit on the 
house." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Slattery said, "People don't buy homes in exchange for brownies the way 
they did a couple of years ago. It's a buyer's market. Even chocolate eclairs 
don't do it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Jodie Torkelson joined in, "We took out an advertisement in the Washington 
Post, and the only response we got was from the Washington Times saying that 
they would run it in bold type for half the price." 
</P>
<P>
"The funniest thing happened to us," Herman Methfessel said. "A woman came to 
the house and hammered a sign into the lawn that read For Sale. When I yelled 
that the house was not for sale, she shouted back, 'You never know until the 
fat lady sings.' I asked, 'What the hell does that mean?' And she said, 'Beats 
me -- they taught us to say that in real estate school.' " 
</P>
<P>
The conversation got a little dicey when Lila Crimson informed us that her 
husband Matt and she had split, and there were very bitter feelings involved. 
"If he had let me sell the house six months earlier we could have gotten 
$500,000 for the place. What a Dummkopf! The reason I left him was he never 
knew when to buy or when to sell or when to put out the garbage." 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps he didn't know that real estate prices would plummet." 
</P>
<P>
Lila blurted out, "His girlfriend should have told him." 
</P>
<P>
I tried to be helpful. "People who break up shouldn't get angry with each other 
because the price of their house isn't what it used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Lila asked, "Why is it that your home is worth a fortune when you're living 
together, and it's not worth a Russian ruble when you're splitting up?" 
</P>
<P>
"That's a good question," I said. 
</P>
<P>
David Jaffe said to me, "You lied last year when you told everyone that your 
home was worth $4 million." 
</P>
<P>
I responded, "I didn't lie. Every toolshed in the neighborhood was worth $4 
million." 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Milikowsky spoke up, "When it comes to real estate prices, people 
should exaggerate as much as they can because it helps the entire community." 
</P>
<P>
"I heard that Robbie and Tommy Gresinger couldn't sell their place, so they 
turned it into a bed and breakfast business." 
</P>
<P>
"They sound desperate." 
</P>
<P>
"They told me that the bed and breakfast arrangement will guarantee them one 
meal a day, which is the minimum that doctors say you need during a housing 
slump." 
</P>
<P>
Herman Methfessel said, "I think that the lesson from this meeting is, don't 
sell your house for what it's worth -- sell it for whatever someone is prepared 
to pay." 
</P>
<P>
"But," protested Ray Slattery, "then you take all the greed out of real estate, 
and greed is what the business is all about."

ERMA BOMBECK: IF IT'S A TYPICAL FRIDAY, IT MUST BE FIGHT NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I just figured out that if my marriage can survive Friday nights, it can 
survive anything. That's the night my husband and I have all the togetherness 
of Texas Gov. Ann Richards and Clayton Williams on a blind date. 
</P>
<P>
After dinner, I retire to the living room where I watch an evening of sitcoms 
and movies. My spouse, the news junkie, turns on the TV set in the kitchen and 
watches a verbal SWAT team led by John McLaughlin. 
</P>
<P>
From time to time I hear my husband laugh and pound his fist on the table, but 
for all purposes, we are in separate worlds. "The McLaughlin Group" has to be 
the thinking man's answer to mud wrestling. Surrounded by four cowboys who 
gallop their way through political issues, McLaughlin reminds me of a 
gunslinger in a saloon who fires at their feet and orders them to dance. 
</P>
<P>
So what does it matter if a married couple have different tastes in television? 
Well, how would you feel if your husband crept up behind you and shouted in 
your ear, "Bombeck! Bush shows Bo Derek around the White House. Will it help or 
hinder his popularity?" 
</P>
<P>
"Uhhh, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
"An answer!" 
</P>
<P>
"It would help, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
"Wrong!" he snaps. "Are you suggesting the President has nothing better to do? 
What kind of a pinko Commie answer is that! 
</P>
<P>
"OK, then, it would hinder." 
</P>
<P>
"On a scale of one to 10." 
</P>
<P>
"What a question," I said. "Bo Derek is a 10." 
</P>
<P>
"Not Bo Derek, you fool! The state of the presidency." 
</P>
<P>
My husband says John McLaughlin is a former Jesuit priest. Right. And Robert 
Novak left the show to become a maitre d' at the House of Pancakes. Can't you 
see McLaughlin hearing confessions on a Saturday afternoon? "What do you mean 
it's been three months since your last confession? Are you asking me to believe 
you've been lily-white with no impure thoughts for three solid months? You 
sound like a guy named Buchanan I just had in here. You know what I think? I 
think you just don't have the guts to admit you made a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
The other night my husband wandered onto my turf and asked, "What are you 
watching?" I looked up from my TV set and said, "It's a series called 'Over My 
Dead Body.' " 
</P>
<P>
"How can you stand all that violence?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
I don't believe he said that.

THE BUREAUCRAT WHO GOT PATTON HIS TANKS; 
</P>
<P>
LUCIUS D. CLAY; AN AMERICAN LIFE BY JEAN EDWARD SMITH; HENRY HOLT: $29.95; 812 
PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED CRAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Cray is author of the recently published 
General of the Army: A Biography of George C. Marshall (W.W. Norton). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He was a new type of soldier, a master of warfare at mid-century. One of a 
remarkable band of similar men and women, he was a chair-borne bureaucrat, the 
great, often-scorned weapon that assured the Allied victory in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
No battlefield honors for men such as Lucius D. Clay, West Point 1918, first in 
English and history, 128th out of 137 in military conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, autocratic, independent Lucius Clay found his way into the Corps of 
Engineers, and ultimately to Washington. There he dealt with a pork-barrel 
Congress, scattering vast river, harbor and dam projects about the country. He 
cooperated generously with the New Deal's Civilian Conservation Corps and Works 
Progress Administration in civilian relief -- and gained even more experience 
in managing huge enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
(According to one of his sponsors, then-Sen. James Byrnes: Were Clay given six 
months, "he could run General Motors or U.S. Steel.") 
</P>
<P>
For 20 years, Clay and a small group of like-minded men gathered those 
political and managerial skills necessary to mobilize an army of 9 million when 
the nation finally roused itself to the menace of Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
No Patton here. Only the deputy director of war mobilization who got Patton his 
tanks, Eaker his bombers, and Bradley, Clark and MacArthur their Jeeps and 
C-rations. This is dull stuff, but it was that very logistical capacity of the 
United States that won the war. 
</P>
<P>
Still, logistics is not the sort of thing to transfix a biographer for the two 
decades that University of Toronto political scientist Jean Edward Smith has 
spent on this book. Rather, it is Clay's tenure as military governor of Germany 
in the immediate postwar era, during four years of increasing Cold War tension, 
of Berlin blockade and airlift, that will assure the general as permanent a 
place in history as any man gets. 
</P>
<P>
Not for nothing did the citizens of Berlin place at the foot of Clay's grave at 
West Point a tablet that read: Wir danken dem Bewahrer unserer Freiheit (We 
thank the defender of our freedom). 
</P>
<P>
A justly large part of Smith's story then is given over to the remaking of 
Germany in a democratic image. And if Clay gets more credit as proconsul than 
he might deserve, well, Smith would not be the first biographer to enhance his 
subject's image. 
</P>
<P>
Some of that burnishing strains the record, however. Clay triumphs, in Smith's 
account, because everyone else -- the State Department, George C. Marshall, 
Dean Acheson, George Kennan, among others -- is flawed, or weak, or conniving. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Smith maintains that Clay "was not a militant cold warrior" but a 
keen student of geopolitics who believed that "the celebrated architects of 
Cold War containment were purchasing Allied unity at Germany's expense." 
(Indeed, Clay fixed a great deal of the blame for the failure of four-power 
government in Germany on the condemnatory French, not the war-weary Soviets.) 
</P>
<P>
Be that as it may, it was this same general who on March 5, 1948, sent a 
calculated, back-channels cable to Washington warning that war "may come with 
dramatic suddenness." The Clay cable triggered real alarm in the Truman 
Administration, and impelled a series of rearmament measures. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Clay did not believe a word of his telegram; he made the assertion merely 
to goose a congressional committee into approving a budget bill the Army 
favored. It was not the last time a self-serving military officer exceeded his 
authority, then pleaded innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Nor would this be the last time Clay influenced world affairs. Indeed, one 
might have wished Smith had devoted more attention to the later, political 
Clay. By then president of Continental Can Corp., Clay played a pivotal role in 
making his friend Dwight David Eisenhower the 34th President of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Clay, Tom Dewey and Herbert Brownell shaped Eisenhower's pre-convention 
strategy and candidacy. Again, Smith may give too much credit to the 
politically adept Clay -- at Ike's expense -- but he lays open Clay's largely 
hidden role. 
</P>
<P>
Clay the soldier, the diplomat, the politician, are all here in Smith's 
sometimes cumbersome biography, a book flawed, like its subject, but a 
worthwhile addition to the record of our times. 
</P>
<P>

in Life and Letters" by Gerald W. Haslam (Capra Press).

YOUR BODY: RESEARCHERS FIND GENETIC LINK TO SHYNESS, HAY FEVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Do shyness and allergies go together? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, say researchers who have found that shy people are more likely to have 
hay fever. 
</P>
<P>
"We think there is a small group of people who inherit a set of genes that 
predispose them to hay fever and shyness," said Jerome Kagan, a Harvard 
University psychology professor. 
</P>
<P>
With three co-authors, Kagan surveyed 379 college students, asking them to 
report on their own shyness and their allergies. Their findings were published 
recently in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Those students who reported a history of professionally diagnosed hay fever had 
significantly higher scores on the shyness index, Kagan and his co-authors 
found. Hay fever is an allergic reaction accompanied by sneezing and 
inflammation of the eyes and upper respiratory tract. It is caused mainly by 
exposure to grass and tree pollens. 
</P>
<P>
Extremely shy adults seem to be more likely to have hay fever than outgoing 
individuals, said Kagan. But in the study, shy individuals were not more likely 
than outgoing people to report other types of allergies. 
</P>
<P>
A link between shyness and hay fever might reflect differences in the receptors 
along the olfactory (smell) pathways or central nervous system circuits that 
regulate both mood and immune function, the authors said. In the past, other 
researchers have linked shyness with depression and allergies other than hay 
fever. 
</P>
<P>
These recent findings are preliminary, Kagan emphasized, and may not be borne 
out in further research. Parents should not imply from the research that they 
should coax shy children out of their shells to alleviate allergies, Kagan 
added. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have allergies, treat the allergies," agreed David S. King, a UCLA 
neuropsychology researcher and a co-author of the study. "If you are too shy, 
treat that." 
</P>
<P>
But a Southern California allergist says the researchers might be looking at 
the link backwards. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more likely the hay fever causes the shyness, not vice-versa," said Dr. 
Robert Ziering, a Vista allergist and UC San Diego assistant clinical professor 
of pediatrics. "A child with allergies may have a constantly runny nose. He 
hears teachers and parents telling him to take care of it. And that kind of 
input can cause kids to retreat into a shell to avoid the correction."

BUSH, SALINAS TRY TO PUT TRADE PACT ON FAST TRACK; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMICS: THE PRESIDENTS SHIFT FOCUS FROM DRUGS AND IMMIGRATION. BOTH HOPE TO 
HEAD OFF PROTECTIONISTS.

MONTERREY, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari on Monday opened 
two days of meetings intended to put approaching negotiations for a free-trade 
agreement on a fast track and to lay the groundwork to head off potential 
opposition from special interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the possible roadblocks facing an agreement, Salinas said in an 
interview with the Monterrey newspaper El Norte that he is concerned "with some 
protectionist attitudes that are arising in the United States," which, he said, 
could grow worse if the U.S. economy weakens in a recession. 
</P>
<P>
The two met at the Salinas family's expansive home in the desert ranching 
community of Agualeguas, about 40 miles south of the Texas border, before 
returning to Monterrey for the night. 
</P>
<P>
Monterrey, Mexico's third-largest city, is an industrial center that was chosen 
as the site for the talks to highlight the expectation that U.S.-Mexican trade 
will expand beyond its current level of $52 billion a year if an agreement is 
reached to drop nearly all tariffs and other trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
For the 42-year-old Harvard-educated Salinas, the visit by Bush offers an 
opportunity to "show he has a special relationship" with the U.S. President -- 
suddenly a political plus in Mexico after generations of politicians sought to 
demonstrate their independence from Washington, a White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
But White House officials made clear that in the view of the Bush 
Administration, the journey -- coming right after Bush's exhausting tour of 
Europe and the Middle East and one week before a long excursion to South 
America -- is little more than a courtesy call demonstrating support for what 
they are calling "a new-generation leader." 
</P>
<P>
By turning the spotlight on trade, the visit reflects a recent shift -- perhaps 
on the surface, perhaps deeper -- in the political dialogue between the United 
States and Mexico. Previous presidential meetings, which occur as often as 
every six months, have focused more on such sore points as unchecked Mexican 
immigration to the United States and the flow of drugs northward across the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas' surprise announcement during a visit to Washington last June that he 
would push for a free-trade agreement has received a warm reception at the 
White House and helped shift the focus of the U.S.-Mexican relationship away 
from the perennial problems that have defied solution. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater shrugged off the suggestion that 
as economic problems in the United States rise, labor unions would press the 
Administration to back off a tariff-trimming agreement that would siphon jobs 
to cheaper Mexican labor markets. 
</P>
<P>
"We want a free-trade agreement that would create jobs," he said, suggesting 
that it would bring long-range benefits to the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Bush is likely to encounter greater difficulties in winning 
approval for such an agreement than would Salinas, who already has the support 
of a Senate controlled by his Institutional Revolutionary Party. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on a trade agreement are expected to begin next spring, with a 
goal of wrapping them up in 1992. The agreement, similar to one that went into 
effect two years ago with Canada, would be a major step toward Bush's goal of a 
hemisphere free-trade zone stretching from Argentina to Canada. On Sunday, the 
President will embark on a weeklong trip to Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile 
and Venezuela to promote, among other things, his "Enterprise of the Americas" 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
As seen by the White House, elimination of trade barriers would stimulate U.S. 
exports, creating jobs at home by boosting production. Mexican tariffs on U.S. 
goods already have been reduced from an import-discouraging 100%, in many 
cases, to an average of 9%. 
</P>
<P>
From the Mexican viewpoint, an agreement would help stimulate the flow of U.S. 
capital to Mexico, bringing with it jobs, technology and management skills -- 
all benefits to the economy that are needed to discourage emigration. The 
government also wants access to U.S. markets for such Mexican goods as 
textiles, vegetables and cement. 
</P>
<P>
Two areas that were originally thought to be obstacles to an agreement -- the 
flow of Mexican workers to the United States and U.S. investment access to the 
lucrative Mexican oil industry -- have been relegated to a back seat in the 
negotiations. Salinas has said the trade talks would not deal with Mexican 
emigration, and U.S. Special Trade Representative Carla Hills, who accompanied 
Bush to Monterrey, said the United States will not demand that the state-owned 
oil monopoly be opened to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Salinas started their day together in Agualeguas, where they attended 
a Mexican rodeo at the Lionzo Charro Adriana Margarita arena, named for 
Salinas' sister, then watched folk dancing in the town plaza. 
</P>
<P>
They met for lunch and informal private talks at the Salinas residence before 
flying by helicopter to Monterrey, where the official start of the state visit 
was marked by a hail of confetti and speeches in the city's dramatically lit 
main plaza just after sundown. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexico today is the country of manana," Salinas said, "but not because we 
leave for later what has to be done. Rather it is because we Mexicans now act 
resolutely with our efforts, work and unity to take this great step toward our 
new future." 
</P>
<P>
Bush responded, "We want to work together toward the free and open trade so 
vital to creating jobs and enterprise in your economy and our own." 
</P>
<P>
At day's end, Fitzwater said that in addition to trade issues, Bush and Salinas 
discussed increased U.S.-Mexican cooperation in anti-drug efforts, violence 
along the U.S.-Mexican border and developments in El Salvador, where both 
nations favor a cease-fire between the government and leftist rebels.

In the Hollywood hierarchy, MCA Inc. Chairman Lew R. Wasserman has long 
exercised a rare kind of authority. He was the first "super-agent," a confidant 
of presidents, a political power broker and the man labor unions often sought 
out to resolve their most intractable disputes. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, as the $6.59-billion sale of MCA to Matsushita Electric Industrial 
Co. was marked with a champagne toast and a round of applause, the torch may 
have been passed. 
</P>
<P>
Creative Artists Agency Chairman Michael Ovitz, who brokered the MCA deal and 
stood behind Wasserman as the agreement was signed, is the first person since 
the MCA chairman to transcend the super-agent role. With his influence 
seemingly reaching into every corner of the entertainment industry, Ovitz may 
now stand alone among Hollywood's power elite. 
</P>
<P>
The future of other figures close to the MCA deal is cloudier. Power shifts in 
Hollywood are like earth tremors. Everyone feels them but no one quite knows 
what they mean. At 77, Wasserman will remain MCA's chairman for the time being, 
but sources contend that his influence is already diminished. MCA President 
Sidney J. Sheinberg may also suffer fallout from the sale, since some 
knowledgeable individuals say he has privately expressed the intention to 
follow if Wasserman leaves. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, David Geffen, who recently sold his record company to MCA, 
is seen as a big winner because the value of the MCA stock he acquired has 
since nearly doubled, to $710 million. He has even been mentioned as a possible 
successor to Wasserman. 
</P>
<P>
With his close links to Matsushita, Ovitz has also been linked to Wasserman's 
job. Many in Hollywood are willing to bet their Nautilus machines that Ovitz 
will take the helm at MCA within two or three years. "This is his exit visa" 
from Creative Artists, said one industry source. 
</P>
<P>
But others close to Ovitz insist that his power base will remain at CAA, where 
he enjoys autonomy and the ability to pick and choose his activities. "Michael 
is the guy in the middle who is making the deals happen," said one close 
source. "He's taken the agent's normal role and elevated it to a whole new 
level. It leaves everyone else in the dust." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever his future holds, people close to Ovitz say he is clearly anxious to 
accept the mantle of Hollywood's leading statesman and power broker. Yet 
Wasserman will be a tough act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
A tall, slender man known for his thick mane of gray hair and wide 
tortoise-shell glasses, Wasserman has had an enormous impact on Hollywood. As 
an agent, he was among the first to fully understand how government antitrust 
decisions and the rise of television would destroy the contract studio system 
and disperse power into the hands of talent agents. In 1949, he negotiated the 
first deal giving an actor -- in this case, James Stewart -- a percentage of a 
film's gross receipts. The financial clout of Hollywood stars has risen 
steadily ever since. 
</P>
<P>
In 1952, as part of an agreement with the Screen Actors Guild that allowed MCA 
-- then a talent agency -- to move into TV, Wasserman became the first producer 
to agree to pay out residuals on rebroadcasts of shows. As a result, thousands 
of television actors, producers, directors, writers and others now receive a 
check every time their shows are rerun on television. 
</P>
<P>
Wasserman also demonstrated impressive financial judgment when he bought the 
Universal lot in 1958 for just under $12 million. A nearly bankrupt Universal 
was reeling at the time from budget overruns on Stanley Kubrick's "Spartacus." 
Four years later, MCA bought Decca Records Inc., the parent company of 
Universal, and moved into movie production. With the Decca purchase, MCA was 
forced out of the talent agency business. Yet revenues continued to grow. At 
one time MCA's reach was so vast it was nicknamed "the octopus." 
</P>
<P>
Ovitz, 43, has never run a studio. He also lacks Wasserman's political clout. 
Whereas Wasserman counted Presidents Johnson, Carter and Reagan -- a former 
client -- among his personal friends, Ovitz has been slow to expand his 
professional contacts beyond Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Ovitz's co-sponsorship of a dinner last year for New Jersey Democratic Sen. 
Bill Bradley, who is a possible presidential hopeful, reportedly came at the 
urging of Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner. Ovitz's other big political 
plunge was on behalf of the "Big Green" environmental initiative, which 
California voters resoundingly defeated this month. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Ovitz arguably is every bit as innovative as Wasserman when 
it comes to the art of the deal. Sony Corp. and Matsushita both turned to Ovitz 
when they were shopping for major Hollywood studios, and in both cases he was 
able to secure highly lucrative agreements. 
</P>
<P>
His company is also widely credited with perfecting the concept of "packaging" 
talent for television and movies. CAA realizes enormous fees from its 
television deals and was responsible for assembling the casts for "Rain Man" 
and other films. The firm's top clients include screen stars Tom Cruise, Dustin 
Hoffman, Robert Redford and Jane Fonda and director/producer Steven Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
One key question is whether Ovitz will now find his role as Hollywood's most 
powerful representative of talent and corporations incompatible. 
</P>
<P>
Already, some members of Hollywood's creative community have expressed concerns 
about Ovitz's role in MCA's purchase. "Is he going to have an ongoing role with 
MCA? It's something you have to ask yourself," said one major film producer who 
declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Others have questioned whether Ovitz's access to MCA during the deal may have 
provided him with information normally unavailable to an agent. But Sheinberg 
said in an interview that "Mr. Ovitz didn't get involved in any of that, and 
this transaction didn't involve any of that." 
</P>
<P>
Labor relations are another question mark on Ovitz's resume. In his heyday, 
Wasserman was well known for his ability to create a consensus when the heads 
of various companies met for policy decisions, primarily through their 
labor-bargaining alliance, or through the Motion Picture Assn. of America. 
Wasserman was as well known for urging company concessions in the interest of 
peace as for hanging tough. 
</P>
<P>
Ovitz tried to devise a solution to the protracted 1988 Writers Guild of 
America strike, but failed. An extremely private man, Ovitz apparently lacks 
Wasserman's engaging personality and appreciation for compromise. But people 
close to him say that may change. 
</P>
<P>
"He's only 43," said one top entertainment figure. "Give the guy some time."

MATSUSHITA TO BUY MCA -- $6.5 BILLION; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE DEAL FOR THE HOLLYWOOD CONGLOMERATE IS THE LARGEST TAKEOVER 
OF A U.S. COMPANY BY A JAPANESE FIRM. THE PRICE IS LOWER THAN EXPECTED.

<P>
After nearly four months of secret negotiations, Hollywood's MCA Inc. on Monday 
signed an agreement to be bought by Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. 
for about $6.59 billion in cash and securities. 
</P>
<P>
MCA President Sidney J. Sheinberg said his company's need for a "strategic 
alliance," combined with pessimism about the economic future, led it to accept 
Matsushita's lower-than-expected offer of $66 per share in cash. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, MCA shareholders will receive stock in a newly created spinoff 
company that will own MCA's New York-area TV station. Company officers have 
privately valued the spinoff at about $5 a share, raising the total payout to 
$71, though some Wall Street traders have said the new shares might trade as 
low as $3. 
</P>
<P>
MCA -- founded in 1924 as a booking agent for jazz bands and now the 
fourth-largest entertainment company in the United States -- is the most 
diversified of the Hollywood entertainment conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
Among its properties are Universal Pictures, Universal Studios Tour in 
Universal City and a similar theme park in Florida, a publishing house, record 
labels and interests in cable television and movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
The firm has grown to become a colossus of films ("E.T. -- The 
Extra-Terrestrial," "Jaws," "Back to the Future" series), records (Reba 
McEntire, Elton John, Guns N' Roses, Bobby Brown, George Strait) and television 
("Murder, She Wrote," "Major Dad"). Its Florida and California theme parks are 
exceeded only by Disney's. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is the largest takeover of an American company by a Japanese firm. 
</P>
<P>
MCA, with about 17,000 employees, earned $192 million last year on revenues of 
$3.4 billion. Profitability has been erratic over the years, but the company 
has never been in financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita, founded in 1918 by Konosuke Matsushita, who died last year at 94, 
is Japan's largest electronics company and is familiar to American consumers 
through such brand names as Panasonic, Technics and Quasar. It had $38 billion 
in sales in its latest fiscal year and earned $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Among the world's top 20 corporations with more than 189,000 employees, 
Matsushita is following the lead of Japanese rival Sony Corp. in buying access 
to movies and recordings that can be played on its electronics products. Sony 
bought Columbia Pictures Entertainment last year for $3.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, MCA left the door open to a higher bid by guaranteeing 
Matsushita up to $125 million in fees and expenses if the Hollywood company 
accepts any unsolicited offer from another company before the current deal 
closes. 
</P>
<P>
One major shareholder, who declined to be identified, said that he did not 
regard such a bid likely. 
</P>
<P>
"(MCA Chairman) Lew (Wasserman) would have dragged his feet if there had been a 
hint from the GEs or the Capital Cities of the world. But nobody was 
forthcoming." 
</P>
<P>
MCA stock closed Monday at $65.125 a share, down 25 cents, on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
While most shareholders will receive cash from Matsushita, Wasserman, 77, will 
be paid a special issue of preferred stock for his 5 million of MCA's 92.8 
million shares outstanding. The preferred stock will enable Wasserman to avoid 
the huge tax bill that might have accompanied a cash sale. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking silence after months of closed-door negotiations, Sheinberg said in a 
telephone interview Monday that MCA had sought the alliance with Matsushita, a 
consumer electronics giant, to assure its own growth. "We felt in the world of 
the future, we were going to need more resources financially and otherwise than 
we felt we had or could get. We felt we had to be part of something more 
diversified," Sheinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
In similar moves, there was Sony's acquisition of Columbia and Time Inc. 
acquired Warner Communications to become Time Warner Inc. 
</P>
<P>
MCA had been seeking such a partner for years, but had difficulty finding a 
company that could afford an acquisition that Wasserman and others once 
believed would command $90 a share or more. 
</P>
<P>
Sheinberg defended the purchase price as not only "fair, but something we could 
recommend vigorously." He added: "Would we have liked to receive more? Sure. If 
I told you no, you would say I'm the biggest jerk you've ever run into." 
</P>
<P>
Some shareholders complained privately that MCA could have commanded more by 
waiting for a better economic climate. Wasserman's age and dim view of the 
world economy apparently militated against that. Sheinberg said MCA officers 
were "not optimistic" about the economy and doubted whether a change in the 
federal "financial interest and syndication" rules -- which bar TV network 
owners such as General Electric Co. from owning studios -- would have prompted 
a better bid. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Alfred C. Sikes 
issued a brief statement Monday predicting that the Matsushita-MCA combination 
"will almost certainly affect" the debate over a change in the rules. Network 
owners have argued that they must be allowed to produce their own shows in 
order to compete effectively with foreign-owned media conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita President Akio Tanii, addressing a Tokyo press conference from Osaka 
via a giant video screen, said MCA officers would be largely free to run their 
company under terms of the agreement. Tanii grew visibly tense at some tough 
questions from Western reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what Matsushita would do if MCA proposed to produce a "Japan-bashing" 
film, or one critical of the late Emperor Hirohito's role in World War II, 
Tanii said: "I didn't dream there would be a question like that. . . . 
Something like that (film) shouldn't emerge. . . . Filmmakers must create films 
that are inspirational, that will be enjoyable for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about U.S. criticism of Matsushita's participation in the Arab-led 
boycott of Israel, Tanii said simply: "We are fair to all. . . . We don't have 
any experience of having treated anybody or any country differently." 
Wasserman, Sheinberg and Matsushita negotiator Michael Ovitz all have been 
major backers of Jewish and Israeli causes, and it is illegal for any U.S. 
company to participate in the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, World Jewish Congress President Edgar Bronfman called 
Matsushita a "slavish adherent" to the boycott. "The Jewish community is deeply 
concerned over Matsushita's discriminatory policies . . . which are not only 
reprehensible on ethical grounds but contradict the bedrock principle of free 
and open trade between nations." 
</P>
<P>
Sheinberg said both he and Wasserman had signed new five-year contracts to 
remain in their positions, but he declined to discuss sharply conflicting 
reports about his own intentions. 
</P>
<P>
One individual with knowledge of the marathon Sunday board session at which the 
acquisition agreement was hammered out said Sheinberg explicitly declared his 
intention to leave MCA when Wasserman does, rather than moving into the chief 
executive's position. 
</P>
<P>
"His belief is that it's time for a younger man to move up. He would have to 
change his personal philosophy to stay. He sees himself as Lew's partner," the 
individual said of Sheinberg, who is 54. 
</P>
<P>
David Geffen, an MCA executive and one of the company's biggest shareholders, 
disputed that claim. "That's absolutely not true. . . . The exact reverse is 
true. His contract guarantees (the CEO job) to him," said Geffen, who will 
receive about $710 million from the sale. He said Sheinberg would become chief 
executive officer automatically if for any reason Wasserman vacated the job. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter distributed at MCA's Universal City headquarters Monday, Wasserman 
and Sheinberg assured employees that they did not expect any personnel or 
policy changes from the sale. Sheinberg said executives other than himself and 
Wasserman did not get contractual guarantees as part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals close to Ovitz, the Creative Artists Agency chairman who served as 
Matsushita's chief consultant, said the agent will not play a role in managing 
MCA. 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita will appoint new directors to MCA's board so that it controls a 
majority of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
Reportedly exhausted after more than a week of intense bargaining, Wasserman 
flew back to Los Angeles from New York on Monday after conducting only a 
handful of brief press interviews. Asked about the relatively modest 
acquisition price, he told Reuters news service: "(The deal) could have been 
derailed along the way. You reach a point where you get the highest figure 
you're going to obtain." 
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by Wasserman and Matsushita executive Masahiko Hirata at 
9:30 a.m. EST during a brief ceremony at Matsushita's New York law firm. MCA's 
board had met until about midnight the night before, as it debated the 
acquisition and apparently conducted last-minute negotiations with Matsushita 
by telephone from the board room. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Matsushita will launch a tender offer for MCA's shares by 
Nov. 30 and expects to consummate the offer by early January. The companies 
said they intend to sell Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co., through which MCA 
operates tourist facilities in Yosemite National Park, to an American buyer 
within 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials and others had objected to the possibility that a foreign 
company might profit from the park. Matsushita and MCA said the Curry Co. would 
be held in escrow until it is sold, and any profits from the operation would be 
donated to the National Park Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The exact value of the deal remains difficult to assess because of sharp 
disagreements over the likely value of stock in the spinoff that will own MCA's 
WWOR-TV station, which broadcasts in the lucrative New York market. MCA 
executives have assigned it a share value of about $5, reflecting total value 
of about $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
Several investors said they expected the so-called "stub" of stock in the 
spinoff to trade for less on the open market. 
</P>

Michael Cieply reported from Los Angeles and Leslie Helm from Tokyo.

<P>
</P>
<P>
MATSUSHITA-MCA DEAL AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
Here are the principal terms of the agreement: 
</P>
<P>
Price: $6.59 billion in cash and securities. Holders of MCA Inc.'s 92.8 million 
shares will receive $66 per share in cash, plus a share worth about $5 in 
WWOR-TV, a New York-area TV station that will be spun off to MCA stockholders 
because broadcasting licenses cannot be owned by foreign companies. For tax 
purposes, Lew R. Wasserman, MCA chairman and chief executive, will receive no 
cash, but will instead exchange his 5 million MCA shares for preferred shares 
of a new Matsushita subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Management: MCA will continue to operate under its name and existing 
management. Matsushita will name a new majority slate to MCA's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
Yosemite: Matsushita has agreed to sell the national park concession operated 
by the Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co. within a year. In the interim, profits 
will go into a trust for the benefit of Yosemite National Park. Matsushita will 
play no role in park management. 
</P>
<P>
Timing: Matsushita will launch a tender offer for MCA's shares by Nov. 30, and 
expects to consummate the offer by early January.

JAPAN FIRM WILL SELL YOSEMITE STAKE IN A YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Responding to concerns about foreign ownership of a national park concession, 
the Japanese firm that is acquiring entertainment conglomerate MCA Inc. 
announced Monday that the Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co. will be spun off to an 
American buyer within a year. 
</P>
<P>
The Curry Co., an MCA subsidiary, operates hotels, restaurants and other 
tourist services at Yosemite National Park under contract with the National 
Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
National Park Service Director James Ridenour, in a telephone interview from 
Washington, said that MCA and its buyer, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., 
agreed to put Curry Co. stock in escrow for a year until a buyer for the park 
concession can be found. In the meantime, the company's net profits, described 
by Ridenour as "multiple millions," will be turned over to the National Park 
Foundation, a nonprofit group that funnels private money into national park 
programs and projects. 
</P>
<P>
"As time got short, this became an option that looked like the best thing to 
do," the park director said. " . . . It certainly has great potential for being 
a very good deal for the people of America." 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement follows public pleas to MCA by Ridenour and Interior Secretary 
Manuel Lujan Jr. to keep the Yosemite concession in American hands. The two 
officials declared their concerns after the Park Service received dozens of 
letters from citizens objecting to a foreign-owned firm running a national park 
concession. 
</P>
<P>
Ridenour said both MCA and Matsushita "had a great feeling of sensitivity for 
this issue." 
</P>
<P>
Among the prospective buyers of the Curry Co. are the Yosemite Restoration 
Trust, a group founded by environmentalists and businessmen earlier this year 
to oust MCA from the park, obtain the concession contract and reduce 
development in the park. 
</P>
<P>
"The trust will try to buy it, and they are very serious about it," said 
Patricia Schifferle, a member of the trust's advisory council. "They are 
acquiring the financial backing now." 
</P>
<P>
Schifferle, however, called on MCA to donate the Curry Co. to the Restoration 
Trust. The Curry Co., which has been owned by MCA since 1973, has been valued 
at from $50 million to $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Few of us in our lifetime have an opportunity that (MCA Chairman) Lew 
Wasserman has today," said Schifferle, "and that is to alter the course of 
current events . . . and ensure that for the future, Yosemite will remain a 
decommercialized gem." 
</P>
<P>
An MCA spokeswoman declined to say whether the corporation has discussed such a 
possibility with the Restoration Trust. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not at liberty to disclose that right now," said spokeswoman Christine 
Hanson. "That is an option that may or may not have been considered. But at 
this point, what we are doing is to put it up for sale." 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita probably would have to agree to the donation of Curry Co. assets. 
</P>
<P>
George T. Frampton Jr., president of the Wilderness Society and a member of 
Restoration Trust's board of directors, declined to comment on any aspect of 
the deal. The Restoration Trust has pledged, should it get the concession 
contract, to return its profits to the park and reduce commercialization there. 
</P>
<P>
"As a board member of the trust, I am not in (a) position to say anything at 
all right now," Frampton said. "Obviously, we are watching what is happening 
with great interest." 
</P>
<P>
Ridenour said MCA and the Park Service discussed the possibility of MCA 
donating the Curry Co. or some of its Yosemite holdings to the government or to 
a park foundation. But he said "legal impediments" and MCA's commitment to 
protecting its employees at Yosemite made such a deal impossible, given the 
frenzied pace of negotiations with the Park Service over the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Ridenour also said the Park Service ultimately will decide who buys the 
company, and may even help determine the price. 
</P>
<P>
The director added that the Curry Co. contract with the Park Service could be 
renegotiated when the company is sold to increase fees paid to the government. 
The agreement under which the company operates accommodations at Yosemite 
expires in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The contract has been a center of controversy for more than a year. Some 
environmentalists charged that the corporation earned excessive profits at 
Yosemite and commercialized the park; Ridenour pledged to raise the concession 
payments in future contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Under its agreement with the Park Service, the Curry Co. pays 0.75% of its 
gross revenues to the federal government each year in the form of a franchise 
fee. Last year, according to the Restoration Trust, the company paid $636,000 
to the federal government in fees and rent. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have estimated that MCA's profits at Yosemite in 1989 ranged 
from $12 million to $17 million. The Curry Co., which declines to reveal its 
profits, says the estimates are "grossly exaggerated." 
</P>
<P>
The company also vigorously defends its record at the park, pointing out that 
its operations were modified or expanded only with the approval of the Park 
Service and that many of its policies and programs, including recycling, have 
been beneficial to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Jensen, executive vice president of the Curry Co., sought Monday to 
reassure employees and the public that services and accommodations will remain 
unaltered at Yosemite while a buyer is being sought. In response to 
speculation, he said there was no active proposal by company employees at this 
time to try to buy the concession. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing is waiting to see what happens with this transaction," he 
said. " . . . Being placed in escrow and held aside for a year, what that 
really means to me is that we are going to continue business as usual."

MARINE IN GROWING GROUP OF ENLISTED OBJECTORS

As his brigade prepared to deploy to Saudi Arabia, a 22-year-old Marine Corps 
corporal based at Camp Pendleton announced Monday that he has applied for an 
honorable discharge as a conscientious objector, joining a small but growing 
group of servicemen who claim moral objections to the military buildup. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Turner, a Michigan native who enlisted in 1987 for six years of service 
in the Marines, said a spiritual "reawakening" he experienced during mock war 
training exercises earlier this year led him to file his application Oct. 30. 
When the 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade is deployed -- reportedly on Saturday 
-- he said that he will refuse to go. 
</P>
<P>
"My religious beliefs are no longer compatible with the way the Marine Corps 
wants me to train and operate," said Turner, a former squad leader who claims 
that he has nightmares about leading men into combat. "Any duty that I do 
perform in the military is more or less supporting the efforts of a war 
machine. My God is behind me and giving me the strength to stand up and say 
this -- it's against the word of God to participate in any kind of killing." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "Within the near future, we're supposed to deploy. So I'm looking at 
within the next couple of days possibly going to the brig." 
</P>
<P>
Turner's application -- apparently the first to be filed at Camp Pendleton 
since Operation Desert Shield began in August -- puts him in "an extremely 
small minority," according to Maj. Doug Hart, a Pentagon spokesman in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Since early August, Hart said, fewer than 100 of the 2 million active duty 
troops and 80,000 reservists and National Guardsmen have asked to be relieved 
of their military obligation. Of those, he said, fewer than 10 have applied for 
conscientious objector status. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday in New York, five members of the 25th Marine Regiment at Ft. Schuyler 
declared themselves conscientious objectors as other members of the company 
were on their way to Camp Lejeune, N. C., for deployment to the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-war advocates say they are receiving hundreds of calls from military 
servicemen and women requesting information about how to make a conscientious 
objector claim. Harold Jordan, coordinator of the American Friends Service 
Committee's national youth and militarism program, said his Philadelphia-based 
office is working with at least 30 service members to prepare conscientious 
objector statements. 
</P>
<P>
"The meaningful statistics are hard to come by. If you ask the military, 
they'll say there hasn't been a substantial increase," said Jordan, who said 
that he has received letters requesting help with conscientious objector 
applications from four servicemen stationed in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not at the level that it was in Vietnam -- nobody means to suggest that," 
he said. Conscientious objector applications are on the rise, Jordan said, and 
there is every indication that they will not be handled as they were 20 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"During the Vietnam War, it was routine to hold people stateside (while their 
applications were processed). They are clearly saying the opposite is in effect 
now." 
</P>
<P>
That is precisely what Turner is afraid of, according to Mark Lamanna, a 
military counselor for the Central Committee for Conscientious Objection, who 
has worked for three months with Turner on his 15-page application. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way to get a proper review is to be on the mainland United States," 
said Lamanna, noting that the Marine Corps has kept Turner on combat duty, 
assigned to a rifle platoon bound for the gulf. "I'm hoping (that coming 
forward publicly) will put the pressure on the command to transfer him to 
noncombat status." 
</P>
<P>
Turner, who sent his wife, Joelle, to read a statement at a news conference 
Monday at a Methodist church in San Diego, said he wanted others to know of his 
decision despite warnings from his superiors that he not talk to the media. 
</P>
<P>
"I want people to know that you can stand up for your religious beliefs and 
that it's OK to oppose war, if that's what you believe," Turner, a Methodist, 
said. "Christ was not one to go in and use force." 
</P>
<P>
Turner said he enlisted in the service to help pay his way through college, and 
did not give the idea of going into combat serious thought. But during advanced 
infantry training earlier this year, Turner said he became increasingly aware 
that he was being trained to kill. 
</P>
<P>
After participating in a mock battle this summer, he began having nightmares, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My performance began to decline. I thought maybe I was getting burned out. I 
lost a lot of enthusiasm," he said. Then, "I realized it was the job I was 
performing. God was revealing to me that what I was doing was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Rose-Ann Sgrignoli, a spokeswoman for Camp Pendleton, said that to be 
granted conscientious objector status on religious, moral or ethical grounds, a 
serviceman must prove his belief is a controlling force in his life.

BRIEF STORMS, BRIGHT PROSPECTS HEARTEN EXPERTS; 
</P>
<P>
WEATHER: EL NINO WARMING TRENDS AND A SPATE OF RAIN AND SNOW ACROSS THE WEST 
APPEAR -- AT LEAST ON PAPER -- TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS FOR A WET WINTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Two stormy nights in a week do not a rainy season make, but some climate 
experts are wondering whether the trace amounts of rain that fell six days 
apart in Southern California and other changes in weather patterns signal an 
end to the region's four-year chain of dry winters. 
</P>
<P>
Despite continuing concern about the prospects for a fifth drought year in 
California, weather and water experts said that, at least on paper, there 
appear to be improved conditions for a wetter rainy season. 
</P>
<P>
Among encouraging indications they cited were movement by a coastal 
high-pressure system toward the central Pacific Ocean, evidence that El Nino 
warming conditions are under way off the coast, and a spate of small storms 
across the West. 
</P>
<P>
"The possibilities are there," said Jerry McDuffie, deputy meteorologist in the 
National Weather Service's Los Angeles bureau, "but they could disappear in a 
hurry. You never know in this business." 
</P>
<P>
Weather and water experts also cautioned that a failure to at least match 
average rainfall over the next three crucial wet-season months could lead to 
the driest year yet. An average snowfall of 52 inches a year in the Sierra 
Nevada is essential to provide water for the southern part of the state, but so 
far, precipitation is running more than 7 inches below average. 
</P>
<P>
"We need something in the bucket we can really count on," said Maurice Roos, 
the state's chief hydrologist. 
</P>
<P>
The two rainfalls in Southern California -- dropping just 0.19 of an inch on 
downtown Los Angeles last Tuesday and early Monday -- are at least a start, 
experts said. "They need to hang around a little longer," McDuffie said. "It's 
the two- to three-day storms that are the ones we want." 
</P>
<P>
One reason the storms blew through so quickly, meteorologists said, was the 
high-pressure system lingering in the upper atmosphere over the central 
Pacific. In recent dry winters, that system was closer to the California coast, 
acting as a shield and preventing moist air from pouring in at lower 
elevations. 
</P>
<P>
But with the system now farther out in the Pacific, there are more chances for 
not only the sort of brief showers that fell on Southern California, but also 
for heavier rainstorms of the kind that caused flooding last weekend in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We still don't have an ideal situation for heavy rains, but it's certainly 
improved," said Mike Smith, a meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which 
provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and other experts also pointed to warming sea surface temperatures as a 
sign that El Nino conditions are starting again. El Ninos -- Pacific Ocean 
temperature fluctuations near the Equator that are linked to changes in 
low-level atmospheric patterns -- may set favorable conditions for more 
rainfall, meteorologists say. 
</P>
<P>
Experts cautioned that El Ninos do not necessarily bring more rain. "We've had 
cases of heavy and light precipitation associated with El Nino conditions," 
said Dan Cayan, a climate researcher with the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography. "All we can say for sure is that if these conditions last, there 
are some changes in store." 
</P>
<P>
The early Monday rainfall brought no more than 0.02 of an inch to downtown Los 
Angeles, but was accompanied by cold temperatures and biting winds that hinted 
of winter weather to come. The overnight low was 54 downtown and the high 
Monday was 63. 
</P>
<P>
Although high temperatures inland were expected to continue in the 60s today, 
with winds between 25 and 30 m.p.h., temperatures could reach into the 70s on 
the coast, said WeatherData forecaster Steve Burback. And by Wednesday, 
temperatures will begin a warming trend that will rise into the 80s by the 
weekend, he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are no signs of more rain, Burback added. 
</P>
<P>
The latest storm brought snow to parts of the Sierra and the local mountains. 
The National Weather Service reported that 1.75 inches of snow fell early 
Monday at Big Bear Lake. 
</P>
<P>
To ward off the morning chill, Los Angeles residents donned coats and 
turtleneck sweaters and began using car heaters on their way to work. Heating 
fuel companies reported a sudden surge in business. Customers "are talking 
about what a sudden cold snap we're having," said Dale Gould, manager of 
Heating &amp; Cooling Supply in Van Nuys. "People always wait till it gets cold 
to buy a furnace." 
</P>
<P>
In the San Fernando Valley, the city opened up a shelter for the homeless as 
part of an emergency foul-weather program. The Van Nuys Armory will house 
homeless adults for one night after predictions that the temperature in the 
Valley would dip to 40 degrees or below. 
</P>
<P>
In the deserts, winds gusted to 60 m.p.h., uprooting dozens of trees, toppling 
Christmas decorations and power lines and whipping up thick sandstorms that 
caused several minor traffic accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit was eastern Riverside County, where a frigid wind caused scattered 
power outages in desert from Palm Springs to Blythe. There were no injuries or 
major damage reported, but work crews were busy throughout the day replacing 
fallen street signs and traffic signals.

ON CALIFORNIA: IT'S TIME TO THROTTLE LEAF BLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, I have assumed that the leaf blower was a creature born wholly of 
Southern California. After all, it seemed so. What other place is so suited to 
having its lawns blown than the eternally dry, snowless landscape of the south? 
</P>
<P>
But when I set out to prove this, I found I could not. The origins of the leaf 
blower, like those of the machine gun or the electric chair, are shrouded in 
historical and convenient mystery. No one will admit to knowing who invented 
the leaf blower, or when. 
</P>
<P>
What we do know is this: Southern California -- or the city of Los Angeles, at 
least -- now has a chance to kill it. So if we did invent the leaf blower, 
thereby incurring a significant and shameful debt to society, we can square 
things. This is an opportunity we should not let slip away. 
</P>
<P>
This month, City Councilman Marvin Braude introduced a measure that would make 
gasoline-powered leaf blowers illegal if they produce more than 60 decibels of 
sound. Because most leaf blowers shriek their terrorizing whines at volumes 10 
to a hundred times that level, the Braude measure would effectively end their 
evil hold on our neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
And more. As the lawn maintenance industry -- it is a great error to refer to 
these people as "gardeners" -- knows all too well, Los Angeles is the big 
enchilada in the leaf blower war. If Los Angeles drops the hammer on the leaf 
blower, other cities will quickly follow. And pretty soon, the war will be over 
and the blowers will be finished. 
</P>
<P>
So this struggle over the Braude measure is important. It means something. It's 
also an opportunity for Los Angeles to prove that once, just once, it can lead 
the way back to a civilized way of life. And perhaps it will give us a good 
answer when we are accused, as we often are, of inventing freeways, of 
inventing smog, of inventing movies such as Die Hard II. We can say, yeah, all 
that's true enough. But we also killed the leaf blower. 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect it to be easy. Even now the lawn industry has its minions doing 
their work in City Hall. Four years ago, they managed to kill a similar measure 
that received unprecedented public support and the endorsement of the City 
Council's Public Health Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Here was their argument: The lawn industry could not survive without gasoline 
blowers. The industry had grown up with the blower and must have it or die. 
</P>
<P>
This is an argument we hear often these days. As the supporters of the late Big 
Green initiative often reminded us, the apple industry once said it could not 
survive without the pesticide Alar. It did survive, and so did the apples. 
</P>
<P>
What would really happen if gasoline blowers were banned? Simple. The industry 
would switch to electric blowers that produce about one-tenth the noise of 
gasoline blowers. This switch would cost the industry money and produce some 
inconvenience as maintenance people learn how to locate outlets for their new 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
And in some rare cases, the service companies might be forced to use rakes and 
brooms, resulting in a somewhat higher charge for those whose lawns were swept 
rather than blown. 
</P>
<P>
And that would be the sum of it. In exchange for those costs, we would have 
returned to our neighborhoods a sense of peace and quiet that has not been 
present since the first blower showed up 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
OK, I suppose this issue does not rank up there with Saddam Hussein. Here's 
what it is: one of those small brutalizations that we are so good at inflicting 
on ourselves, that make life just a little uglier every day. And sometimes even 
the nights. Once I woke up in a Sacramento hotel in the middle of the night. A 
man was blowing the parking lot next to my room at 2 a.m. I'm sure everybody 
could match this episode with a blower story of their own. 
</P>
<P>
And why are these brutalizations, once created, so hard to end? Beats me. I 
know that the last time blowers came up in the City Council, the lawn industry 
lobbyists found sympathetic ears in the offices of Councilmen Howard Finn, 
David Cunningham and Gilbert Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
Please note that all three of these men are now gone. Finn died. Cunningham 
resigned. Lindsay is incapacitated by a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to say how sentiment will shake out in the present council. But this 
just may be the time to strike. Let's take back the neighborhoods. Bust the 
blowers.

COUNCIL REJECTS HIGHER PARKING FEES FOR PADRES; 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS: 7-1 VOTE OVERRULING STADIUM AUTHORITY DECISION IS BASED ON ECONOMIC 
OUTLOOK, RISING TICKET PRICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerned about the economic recession and the escalating price of a day at the 
ballpark, the San Diego City Council on Monday rejected a proposed $1 increase 
in the parking fee for Padres games. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-1 decision, which overrules a vote of the city's Stadium Authority, 
leaves the Padres as one of only four major league baseball clubs charging less 
than $4 for parking. It also will deprive the city and the club of an estimated 
$340,000 each in additional revenue that would have been generated by the 
increase next year. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to reconsider the increase during budget deliberations next 
spring. That timing virtually guarantees that the Padres will not be able to 
impose a parking fee increase before the 1991 season begins. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to the increase was led by Councilman Bruce Henderson and 
Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt, who were joined by Abbe Wolfsheimer, Ron Roberts, 
Wes Pratt, Judy McCarty and Mayor Maureen O'Connor. John Hartley voted against 
the rejection, and Bob Filner was absent. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think, at this point in time, with the economy the way it is, that it 
would be the right message to send to the people of San Diego," Bernhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres last raised the parking fee at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium from $2 
to $3 in 1988. Under the city's lease with the club, the city receives the 
first $1.5 million in parking revenue, minus operating costs paid to its 
licensed contractor, Ace Parking. All revenue beyond that amount is split 
evenly between the city and the club. 
</P>
<P>
After a disappointing 1990 season, the team increased ticket prices by $1.50 
for reserved seats and $1 for general admission seats. Reserved seats now cost 
$11 and $9.50, and general admission tickets cost $5. 
</P>
<P>
The ticket price increase was emphasized by council members and one resident 
who testified that the price of reserved seats and parking for a Padre game now 
totals $47 for his family of four. But Bill Adams, the Padres' vice president 
for business operations, noted that the same family could attend the game for 
$23 if all four sat in general admission seats. 
</P>
<P>
In arguing for the increase, Adams said the additional revenue will help make 
the Padres more competitive by allowing them to offer players higher salaries. 
The team finished in a tie for fourth place last year, after being picked by 
many to win the National League West division title. 
</P>
<P>
"Every dollar we generate in revenue goes toward us becoming a stronger and 
more competitive team," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres play 81 home games. The Chargers, which play eight games at the 
stadium, not including exhibition games, charge $5 for parking. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Lockwood urged the city to forge warm relations with the 
Padres' new owners, led by television producer Tom Werner, and perpetuate the 
cordial working relationship between the team and the city. 
</P>
<P>
Cities such as Boston, Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles and Oakland have faced 
"serious litigation" with professional sports franchises, Lockwood said, and 
endured bidding wars fostered by dissatisfied owners. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts argued that revenue generated by other facilities such as the San Diego 
Sports Arena or money from the city's general fund should not be used to cover 
a projected budget deficit by the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But none of those arguments swayed most council members, who took pains to 
praise the Padres at the same time they were turning down the parking fee 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
"The stadium shouldn't be a profit center," said Henderson, referring to the 
stadium's first-ever surplus last year, caused largely by proceeds from a 
concert by the rock group the Who. 
</P>
<P>
"It was built by the people of San Diego, and to the extent that you charge for 
parking at the stadium, you should try to recover costs."

O'CONNOR SLIPPING ON ENVIRONMENT ISSUES, GROUP SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor's environmental record has plummeted since 1988, pulling 
her from a spot as the City Council's leading environmentalist to the middle of 
the pack, the Sierra Club announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Her environmental score declined from 97% in 1987-88 to 83% in 1989 and slid 
even further to 64% in 1990," the club's analysis of council voting records in 
1989-90 says. 
</P>
<P>
"This slide is a disappointing trend, as O'Connor seems to be an important 
swing vote on upcoming issues ranging from protection of Mission Trails Park to 
the passage of a strong Resource Protection Ordinance," said Barbara Bamberger, 
conservation coordinator for the club. 
</P>
<P>
Those measures involve the possible extension of Jackson Drive through the park 
and a land-use package to protect areas such as wetlands and canyons. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's press secretary, Paul Downey, suggested that O'Connor's fall in the 
ratings may have been because issues were picked "to make other members of the 
council look good," particularly Linda Bernhardt. She faces a recall effort 
aimed at her environmental record, but is supported by the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
Council votes analyzed by the club included two votes on housing for the poor 
and a vote in which the mayor voted for a higher level of sewage treatment than 
the club has endorsed. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to question some of the votes that they chose," Downey said. "The 
only thing I can figure is it helps certain members of the City Council look 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Bamberger said the issues were chosen independently from the voting analysis, 
and the choices were based on the Sierra Club's identification of national and 
local issues of importance. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt led the club's ratings, earning her membership in a so-called 
"Environmental Four" on the current council. Newcomers Bernhardt and John 
Hartley joined Bob Filner and Abbe Wolfsheimer to form that top-rated group. 
</P>
<P>
Their percentage ratings on 66 key votes on issues such as growth, land use, 
sewage problems and recycling were Bernhardt, 85%; Hartley and Filner, 84%; and 
Wolfsheimer, 79%. Bernhardt and Hartley were on the council for only 33 of 
those votes. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer's rating would have been higher, but she was downgraded for missing 
24% of the key environmental votes over the 18-month survey period, which ended 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle group, which the Sierra Club expects to cast swing votes on 
environmental issues over the next few months, were O'Connor and Ron Roberts, 
both at a 70% rating; and Wes Pratt, at 66%, the analysis concluded. 
</P>
<P>
At the bottom of the list were Judy McCarty and Bruce Henderson, rated at 59%. 
They also were in the so-called "Bulldozer Brigade" in 1987-88, along with Ed 
Struiksma, whom Bernhardt replaced a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Council members reacted predictably to the Sierra Club ratings -- gratefully in 
the case of endorsements, and dismissively in the case of lower ratings. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider the Sierra Club leadership to be a political organization, not an 
environmental organization," McCarty said. "They're defending Linda, and 
they're coming after me, Bruce and Ron. What else is new?" 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer said she was pleased at her rating, but puzzled by being downgraded 
for absences on key votes. 
</P>
<P>
"What can I say? I don't know anything about it," she said. "I can't remember 
any key environmental votes that I missed." 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt said she hoped being at the top of the Sierra Club list would show 
voters "the facts" about the recall effort against her, said to have been 
launched because of her anti-environment activities. 
</P>
<P>
Her supporters have charged that the campaign is orchestrated by Struiksma's 
backers and developers because of Bernhardt's strong environmental stance.

LOOSER RULES SOUGHT ON OPENING SHELTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor on Monday called for the city to liberalize 
its policy on opening emergency shelters for the homeless during cold weather, 
claiming that the existing guidelines are too severe for disabled and ill 
homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
Under current policy, the city opens the Municipal Gymnasium in Balboa Park to 
the homeless when temperatures are expected to drop to 35 degrees, or 40 
degrees if at least a half inch of rain is forecast.

The mayor wants the policy changed to 40 degrees in dry weather, 50 degrees if 
half an inch of rain is expected. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only humane action that the city can take," O'Connor said in a 
news release. "The current limits are too low. Disabled and ill homeless people 
face life-threatening conditions on many winter nights, even in our relatively 
mild climate." 
</P>
<P>
The city's cost to open the gym is low, largely because it is staffed by 
volunteers, said Paul Downey, the mayor's spokesman. Liberalizing the 
guidelines would cost about $10,000 each winter, he said.

UTOPIA FOR CRIMINALS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Legislature passes many bills, but seldom does it pass a bill 
that has such potential for causing an increase in crime as Senate Bill 2557. 
</P>
<P>
SB 2557 allows counties to charge cities for certain services for which 
counties are already receiving tax money. Some counties have indicated an 
intent to take advantage of the bill to charge cities for booking of prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
If a city cannot afford to pay $183 every time a prisoner is booked, will (it) 
turn the prisoners loose or will they lay off policemen to get the money? I 
anticipate that SB 2557 will make California a utopia for criminals.

STORM BRINGS RAIN, HIGH WINDS CUTTING POWER TO ABOUT 50,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unexpected pre-dawn storm, with winds whipping at more than 30 m.p.h., left 
thousands of residents countywide without power Monday and prompted wind 
advisories for the ocean and mountains, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 San Diego Gas &amp; Electric customers from north of San Marcos to 
Borrego Springs were without power between 2:19 a.m. and noon Monday, said 
company spokesman Fred Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
There were also several smaller outages. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the outages were caused by the 33 m.p.h.-winds that blew tree branches 
into wires, Vaughn said. 
</P>
<P>
The high winds also prompted the National Weather Service Monday to issue a 
small-craft advisory for the beaches, and a wind advisory for the mountains, 
said Wilbur Shigehara, senior meteorologist for the agency. Both advisories are 
expected to be lifted today as winds are expected to subside to 5 to 10 m.p.h., 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The storm, which dropped 0.10 of an inch of rain in San Diego, did little to 
affect traffic on the county's roads, according to the California Highway 
Patrol, which reported no accidents during the early morning hours. 
</P>
<P>
The brief storm that originated east of Korea and caused extensive flooding in 
Seattle, was mostly bluster and little substance in San Diego, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
"This just brings variety to San Diego weather," Shigehara said. "This is just 
one of those things that signals a change in the weather." 
</P>
<P>
Shigehara said all traces of Monday's storm will be gone by today, and a mild 
Santa Ana will begin building midweek. Temperatures today are expected to range 
in the upper 60s and climb into the low 70s by Wednesday.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market celebrated the Thanksgiving holiday in an indecisive manner by 
continuing to rise and fall in opposition to the price of oil, which has been 
moving up or down with the threat of war or potential for peace in the Mideast, 
said Irving Katz, director of research at Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Only eight San Diego stocks managed moves of more than one point in either 
direction during the past week, Katz said, with five of those stocks heading 
down. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed Corp., which fell $1.75, was a major casualty, Katz said. The parent of 
HomeFed Bank was the largest percentage loser among San Diego stocks, closing 
the week down 23.7%. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed received a sell recommendation last week from a leading 
savings-and-loan analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities Research who 
cited HomeFed's potential increases in problem loans. 
</P>
<P>
Other stocks moving down were Mail Boxes Etc., down $2, National Health 
Laboratories, down $1.75, Rohr Industries, down $1.375, and Magma Power, down 
$1.25. 
</P>
<P>
On the upside, the consistent gainer during the past week continued to be Price 
Co., which gained an additional $1.75, to $38.25. The stock, which sold for 
$30.50 on Oct. 29, has gained 25.4% in less than a month. Many investors 
evidently believe that Price "could be their best investment in the shrinking 
wholesale club arena," Katz said. Two local stocks that made significant upward 
moves were also coming off recent lows, Katz said. PS Group gained $2, to $32, 
as it rose from its low of $29.375. Maxwell Laboratories gained $1.25, to 
$10.25, up from $8.25.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: ASPHALT COMPANY IS OPERATING IN DEFAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huntway Partners L.P., a Valencia company that operates oil refineries that 
make liquid asphalt, said it is in default of some provisions of its credit 
agreement with its bank, although it is current on interest and principal 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
Huntway said it is operating in default with the "acquiescence" of the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Huntway also said that in response to its greater need for working capital -- a 
result of higher prices for oil, a key ingredient in asphalt -- the bank agreed 
to increase the amount of money available to Huntway for working capital under 
various credit facilities. The combined total of the two facilities remains $41 
million, but the working capital line has been increased by $5 million to $15 
million.

Time Is on Their Side: Mick Jagger and his longtime girlfriend, Texas model 
Jerry Hall, were married on the Indonesian island of Bali, the Rolling Stones 
press agent said Monday. The wedding took place Wednesday and few details were 
available, except that it was a traditional Indonesian ceremony, and the 
couple's two children, Elizabeth, 6, and James, 5, attended, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even we didn't hear about it until today, so they have clearly managed to keep 
the wedding very secret," said the spokesman. The couple have been together for 
more than 10 years. British-born Jagger was divorced from first wife, Bianca, 
in 1979. Hall has not been married before. Alan Dunn, Jagger's longstanding 
friend and the Rolling Stones' tour director, was the best man. CLAUDIA PUIG

More Vanilli: To guard against future Milli Vanilli-like scams, two Boston-area 
lawmakers filed a bill Monday to prevent singing groups from giving audiences 
nothing but lip service in Massachusetts. "If you pay 'real' money for a 
concert, you ought to get 'real' live music in return," said Rep. Kevin 
Poirier. The bill would require promoters to disclose whether any part of a 
performance consists of recorded vocals. CLAUDIA PUIG

NBC Makes Changes: "Amen" will rejoin NBC's prime-time lineup Saturday and two 
shows from the news division -- "Real Life With Jane Pauley" and "Expose" -- 
will replace the low-rated medical anthology "Lifestories" on Sunday night next 
month, the network announced Monday. "Amen" will air at 8 p.m. Saturday, 
replacing "Parenthood." 
</P>
<P>
A network spokeswoman said that "Parenthood" has not been canceled, but a 
decision on its future is expected by Dec. 15. NBC also disclosed that two of 
its new sitcoms -- "Working It Out" and "The Fanelli Boys" -- will switch time 
slots beginning Wednesday. "Working It Out," will move to 9:30 p.m. Wednesday, 
and "The Fanelli Boys" to 8:30 p.m. Saturday. The low-rated medical anthology 
"Lifestories" will be seen on a monthly basis for the remainder of the season, 
NBC said. CLAUDIA PUIG

SCHRODER SHAKES YOU UP IN 'THE STRANGER WITHIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Stranger Within" is that rare TV commodity: an artfully made, crackling 
good thriller that scares you to your toes. 
</P>
<P>
The CBS drama airs at 9 tonight on Channels 2 and 8, its constant, ominous 
undertone gradually building toward an explosion of violence. 
</P>
<P>
This is slow-evolving terror without gimmicks or cheap manipulation. Credit 
John Pielmeier's sound script, some very good direction by frightmaster Tom 
Holland and first-rate performances by Kate Jackson and Rick Schroder in a 
story about the reunion of a mother and son 16 years after his abduction as a 
3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Or is Mark (Schroder) really whom he says he is? When he shows up at the rural 
Minnesota home of Mare Blackburn (Jackson) without warning and tells an 
initially persuasive tale about his origins, his sensitivity, earnestness and 
craving for affection all ring true. Yet there is something sinister about Mark 
and his ability to exploit Mare's vulnerability and guilt feelings about not 
being a "good mom." Moreover, Mare's skeptical boyfriend (Chris Sarandon) 
begins to find holes in Mark's story. 
</P>
<P>
The plot is eked out neatly and tautly in a rugged winter setting that 
emphasizes the protagonists' isolation, with that former cherub Schroder 
chillingly credible as a volatile character whose sweetness appears to conceal 
a possibly dangerous, seething anger, and Jackson on the mark as the mommy 
whose maternal instincts may override her judgment. 
</P>
<P>
There are only a few tip-offs here. Mostly, "The Stranger Within" delivers some 
good old-fashioned jolts. If you like a good scare, this one's for you. HOWARD 
ROSENBERG

WIRE TRAIN ON A TRACK WELL TRAVELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in the mid-'80s, San Francisco's Wire Train was briefly a leading entry in 
the post-R.E.M. alternative-rock sweepstakes, with its derivative but 
attractive song "Chamber of Hellos." 
</P>
<P>
After a three-year absence, the band operated on Sunday at the Roxy largely in 
the shadow of current alternative-rock contender World Party -- no big 
surprise, considering that Wire Train guitarist Jeffrey Trott toured as a 
member of that band earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
But the problem then is the problem now: Singer-songwriter Kevin Hunter has 
neither the moxie nor the mystique of R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe or Party chief 
Karl Wallinger. 
</P>
<P>
For much of Sunday's hour-plus show the quartet (augmented by a keyboardist) 
did an adequate job of covering the same expansive kind of Dylanstones 
territory that World Party often travels. But simulation was all it was: Hunter 
and crew lack the vision to make it more. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Hunter doesn't want to be seen as a visionary; he seems to want it 
real bad. The nadir came with "Tin Jesus," a ponderous attack on organized 
religion with music that sounded like an excerpt from Pink Floyd's "Dark Side 
of the Moon." In the band's best new song, "Spin," some legitimate rock 
momentum was cast aside in favor of a brief psychedelic diversion in which 
Hunter quoted "Light My Fire" and "Let's Spend the Night Together" like words 
from God. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was an encore of Neil Young's "Mr. Soul," during which Hunter 
coaxed the crowd into free-form "hippie dancing." As if it was ancient history, 
Hunter explained, "The hippies didn't like rules very much." But he should 
remember that the music figures he refered to did follow an inviolable rule: 
Shut up and rock. STEVE HOCHMAN

Thousands of workers walked off their jobs after an appeal by the opposition 
trade union for a general strike aimed at forcing Socialist Prime Minister 
Andrei Lukanov to resign. The walkout was apparently limited to about 10% of 
the nation's 4.5 million workers. President Zhelyu Zhelev called on the 
Socialists -- formerly the Communists -- and the opposition to get together on 
a plan to bring the Balkan country out of its political and economic crisis.

COLOMBIA REBELS REPORTEDLY SEIZE 3 AMERICANS

Leftist guerrillas were blamed Monday for the abduction on Sunday of five 
petroleum engineers, including three American citizens working in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
The Medellin cocaine cartel, meanwhile, freed a kidnaped journalist after using 
him and at least nine other hostages to try to pressure the government into 
abandoning its anti-drug fight. 
</P>
<P>
The state oil company Ecopetrol said that two men and a woman saying they 
belonged to the National Liberation Army, or ELN, abducted three U.S. petroleum 
engineers and two of their Colombian colleagues near the northern town of Tibu. 
</P>
<P>
The group released one of the Colombians and told him to carry news of the 
abductions to officials, William Giraldo, an Ecopetrol spokesman, said. 
</P>
<P>
He identified the three Americans as Robert Hogan, Larry Sams and John Bagbey 
and said they are employed by an Oklahoma mining company under contract to 
Ecopetrol. 
</P>
<P>
The official added that Ecopetrol had not established the motive for the 
kidnapings. The ELN has terrorized the petroleum industry for years to try to 
pressure the government into nationalizing it. 
</P>
<P>
A statement from "the Extraditables," as the Medellin drug bosses call 
themselves, said they were releasing the journalist Juan Vitta, who is about 
60, because he was suffering heart pains. 
</P>
<P>
Vitta's freedom came just four days after the Medellin traffickers offered to 
surrender in exchange for government concessions. Cartel members demanded that 
authorities protect their safety, prevent their extradition and drop a demand 
that they confess their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Jaime Giraldo responded by repeating that the government would 
respect the rights of surrendering traffickers and prohibit their extraditions. 
But he insisted that drug suspects confess at least one of their offenses. 
Giraldo and other officials called on the cartel to release its hostages as 
proof of its desire for peace. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after gaining his freedom, Vitta also called for the release of six other 
journalists still held by Medellin drug bosses. 
</P>
<P>
"At this moment, I cannot find a logical and just reason for the Extraditables 
to continue to hold the other journalists in their power," he said in a live 
radio interview after flying to Bogota from Medellin, where he was freed. 
</P>
<P>
Vitta said his captors had driven him all night in a black four-wheel-drive 
vehicle before dropping him off in Medellin. 
</P>
<P>
Vitta, editor of the weekly news magazine Hoy por Hoy, had been held for 86 
days when he was freed. The freed hostage said he was treated well by his 
captors but added that he and the other six journalists were kept in separate 
rooms and he could not vouch for the condition of the others.

OIL SUPPLY ADEQUATE EVEN IF WAR STARTS, ENERGY CHIEF ASSERTS; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETS: INCREASED SAUDI PRODUCTION WILL SOON END SHORTAGES CAUSED BY THE 
EMBARGO AGAINST IRAQ, HE SAYS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Energy Department said Monday that the world will have adequate oil 
supplies even if the Persian Gulf crisis escalates into a shooting war with 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins made the assessment at a luncheon session 
with reporters, noting that the oil supplies lost as a result of the worldwide 
trade embargo against Iraq will be made up -- mainly through stepped-up 
production by Saudi Arabia -- by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins, a retired Navy admiral, also expressed confidence that U.S. and allied 
forces would be able to defend Saudi oil fields and keep gulf shipping lanes 
open to tankers even if the allies begin military action against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The only reason oil prices are about 50% above July levels is the fear that 
Saudi oil fields would be destroyed in the event of war, Watkins said. But he 
asserted that the threat "is not credible. . . . That's why we're over there -- 
to protect Saudi Arabia," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins warned that some of the panic in oil markets -- which on Monday helped 
push oil prices up to more than $33 a barrel -- amounts to a "self-fulfilling 
prophecy" that simply is "not justified." 
</P>
<P>
"We (the U.S. and allied land forces arrayed in the Saudi desert and the naval 
forces in Persian Gulf waters) control gulf shipping, and we control the 
defense of Saudi Arabia," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The energy secretary also cast doubt on predictions that oil prices could reach 
$100 a barrel if war breaks out. "We've already lost Iraq and Kuwait," he said. 
"What's next? Only Saudi Arabia and Iran, and we've been through that already" 
during the Iran-Iraq War. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins, whose department also oversees U.S. nuclear weapons management, 
declined even to guess at how soon Iraq might be able to produce its own 
nuclear weapons. But he warned that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is "very 
serious about getting that capability." 
</P>
<P>
Watkins said that Iraq's Osirak reactor, which was destroyed by Israel in a 
preemptive bombing strike in 1981, is now surrounded by what Watkins described 
as a "100-foot-high berm" -- presumably to protect it from future attacks 
should it ever come back on line. Of Iraq's potential nuclear capability, the 
energy secretary declared: 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that's what they want and that's what they're going to 
get. They are in striking range of achieving that objective." 
</P>
<P>
Watkins also expressed concern that the Soviet Union, which is the world's 
largest crude-oil extractor, is steadily losing production capacity. Soviet oil 
production is expected to decline to 10.5 million barrels a day next year from 
about 11 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
He said the United States is actively considering ways to help the Soviets step 
up their production by modernizing their facilities and upgrading their 
management techniques. "This is very disturbing to us," he said of the Soviet 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins also confirmed reports that the Administration is nearing a series of 
critical decisions on a long-awaited proposal for a long-term energy policy. 
But he said that it is unlikely to be unveiled until sometime in January or 
February. 
</P>
<P>
The energy secretary said President Bush would be presented with a package of 
about 60 option papers early next month and that he would hammer out his own 
program from those recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
He said the program would cover many areas, including production incentives, 
expanded use of nuclear power, safe waste disposal, intensified energy 
conservation and a menu of environmental issues such as reducing America's 
reliance on fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins expressed skepticism about reports that Hussein will allow officials of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect Iraqi nuclear sites this 
year, despite his nation's obligations under the international 
non-proliferation treaty. 
</P>
<P>
He argued that only unannounced spot-checks, rather than scheduled visits, 
could be effective in the case of Iraq. "I'm not sure I feel all that warm and 
fuzzy about" scheduled IAEA inspections, he said.

GIVE EMBARGO TIME TO WORK, BUSH IS URGED

<P>
Three former high-ranking American diplomats Monday urged President Bush to 
show patience in the Persian Gulf crisis and give the economic embargo of Iraq 
much more time to work before moving to a military solution. 
</P>
<P>
Using force soon could inflict lasting damage on U.S. strategic interests in 
the region, warned Richard W. Murphy, an assistant secretary of state in the 
Reagan Administration, and George W. Ball, undersecretary of state in the 
Kennedy Administration 
</P>
<P>
"We can outlast him," said Paul H. Nitze, retired arms control adviser, 
referring to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
The statements were made at a Capitol Hill forum sponsored by the Federation of 
American Scientists on the eve of separate Senate and House hearings on Bush's 
recent decision to double the number of U.S. troops in the gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
Leading Democrats are expected to use the hearings to push more assertively for 
allowing an extended period for economic sanctions to work and for diplomatic 
pressure to erode Hussein's stand in Kuwait, which Iraq invaded Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, the Bush Administration is working to obtain a new 
U.N. resolution on use of force in the Persian Gulf that could pave the way for 
offensive military action in January. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said he believes the coalition of moderate Arab states backing the 
United States would prefer "a very hard squeeze" on Iraq rather than a U.S. 
attack in the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
However, another participant in the forum, former Marine Lt. Gen. Bernard 
Trainor, said it appears to him that the President has decided to take the 
military option. "I don't believe he (Bush) is bluffing. I think he's going 
straight at Saddam Hussein. . . . I believe he's written off the embargo." 
</P>
<P>
Harold H. Saunders, an assistant secretary of state under both Presidents 
Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter, said the President needs more advice on 
political options in the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish that somebody in the U.S. government was giving one-tenth of 1% of the 
time in writing the political scenario that they have in giving him the 
military options," Saunders said. 
</P>
<P>
The speakers agreed that a unilateral offensive would have extremely damaging 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd be in dreadful trouble internationally as well as domestically, and it 
would be a disaster for him," said Nitze, predicting longstanding Arab 
animosity against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He said the United States should reduce its troop strength in Saudi Arabia and 
prepare to wait two or three years, if necessary, for the U.N.-imposed 
sanctions to strangle the Iraqi economy. 
</P>
<P>
Ball, agreeing with Nitze, said Bush will find public support for his policy 
disappearing if it risks tens of thousands of American lives. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason the President has enjoyed high popularity ratings was because he 
was talking about defense and deterrence," Ball said. "If we actually do get 
into a war, they (Bush's poll ratings) would go to hell in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said he believes that Bush "burned his bridges" by ordering a sharp 
increase in U.S. forces in the gulf and declaring that they would not be 
replaced or rotated home until the crisis is resolved.

IRAQ TO RELEASE 3 U.S. HOSTAGES, ALL 58 SWEDES;

<P>
President Saddam Hussein on Monday ordered the release of three American men 
held hostage since his country's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, who last week offered to free all the estimated 2,000 Western and 
Japanese hostages held in Iraq over three months starting on Christmas Day, 
agreed to free the three Americans in response to a plea by their relatives, 
who met him Monday in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the three Americans appeared with Hussein and some of their relatives in 
a television broadcast. They were identified as Fred Harrington, 59, of 
Bellevue, Wash., president of the American Pulp and Paper Co. in Redmond, 
Wash.; and John Stevenson, 44, a computer specialist who worked in Kuwait for 
11 years. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the third American was not immediately known, and it was not 
clear when the three would leave Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel fantastic because we are going home. We met with the president, and he 
is a very nice man," said Stevenson's twin sister, Mary, of Brockton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
About 700 Americans are still in Iraq and Kuwait, including more than 100 held 
as so-called human shields at military and industrial facilities to deter 
attack by U.S.-led forces. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq wants peace," Iraqi television quoted Hussein as telling the relatives. 
"We don't want peace for just ourselves, but peace for all humanity." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently alluding to the U.N.-imposed trade embargo against his nation, 
Hussein said "large numbers of people" have died "because of the lack of food 
and medicine." He gave no figures. 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, Iraq's National Assembly voted to free all 58 Swedish hostages. 
Last week, all German nationals were allowed to go home, and all French 
citizens were freed last month. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the Bush 
Administration will continue to discourage the families of hostages from 
visiting Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"We discourage travel, we consider it risky and we don't think it helps," 
Boucher said. "Saddam Hussein's playing with hostages is just cynical 
manipulation of people, and we don't think that people should be involved in 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people have gotten out, and we always welcome that," he added. "We are 
happy to see people free, but we continue to discourage travel by family 
members." 
</P>
<P>
However, despite Boucher's admonition, more relatives of hostages are planning 
to travel to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Among them is Tom Van Baale, a Des Moines, Iowa, police officer whose 
father-in-law, Charles Keegan, 57, is being held in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very exciting news," Van Baale, 39, said Monday of Hussein's plan to free 
the three Americans. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he and about 15 people are scheduled to leave for Baghdad next 
Monday to plead for release of their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
Van Baale's father-in-law, a certified public accountant, was captured and 
taken to Baghdad after hiding out in Kuwait for more than seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very optimistic," said Willie Carr, 47, a Richland Hills, Tex., woman, who 
will be going to visit her husband, Gary, an oil worker. "They (Iraqis) said if 
we come in peace, not bearing arms, we will not leave empty-handed. And I 
believe them -- I'm reading into that what I want to." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein on Oct. 31 invited U.S. hostage families to Iraq for Christmas reunions 
with their loved ones. But many of the family members have made plans to go 
before then, fearful that war might be imminent. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a major hitch has developed in a previously announced plan, worked 
out by the American Red Cross and its Iraqi counterpart, for exchanging 
messages between the hostages and their families. 
</P>
<P>
The plan had called for the U.S. human-shield hostages being held to send 
written messages to their loved ones. After the relatives had responded, 
shipments of medications, clothes, books and other personal goods were to have 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
But the Iraqis last week objected to the forms to be used for the messages, 
saying they are the same ones that are used for situations such as prisoners of 
war and thus are inappropriate for Iraq's "guests," according to Stephen H. 
Richards, executive vice president of the American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are continuing in hopes of resolving the dispute, he said.

<P>
The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council agreed on a January 
deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. But until the deadline, no military 
action would be taken against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The plan may be modified before it is formally presented as a resolution. Talks 
were under way on whether Jan. 1 or 15 would be set as the date after which 
military force could be used. 
</P>
<P>
In an address to the Supreme Soviet in Moscow, Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned 
Saddam Hussein that his aggression against Kuwait will be punished and vowed 
that the alliance against Iraq will not be broken. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kuwait's finance minister, Sheik Ali al Khalifa al Sabah, said Iraq 
can resist the U.N. economic sanctions for a very long time because its 
centralized economy allows Hussein to shift resources easily. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
The Army ordered 10,567 more military reservists to active duty, bringing to 
more than 90,000 the number of part-time soldiers, airmen and sailors activated 
by the Pentagon since early August. 
</P>
<P>
In Saudi Arabia, two top British commanders predicted that allied forces would 
defeatIraqi forces in "days or weeks" if war breaks out. They said that 
additional ground forces on the way to the gulf will effectively counter Iraq's 
current numerical superiority. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hostage Front: 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein told the visiting relatives of three American hostages in Iraq 
that they are free to take their loved ones with them when they return home, 
Iraq's official INA news agency reported. The announcement spurred new hope 
among 16 Americans who plan to visit Baghdad next week to provide comfort to 
their relatives.

The State Department restated its opposition to such trips.

SECRETARY OF EDUCATION WARNS COLLEGES TO REIN IN THEIR COSTS; 
</P>
<P>
TUITION: CUT PROGRAMS IF NECESSARY, LAURO CAVAZOS TELLS THEM. NO INSTITUTION 
CAN DO EVERYTHING WELL, HE SAYS.

<P>
Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos Monday urged the nation's colleges and 
universities to make "tough choices" to cut escalating expenses, including 
eliminating some programs and courses, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to curb tuition increases will put higher education out of the reach of 
many worthy students, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos' warning came as the department released reports targeting prime areas 
for cost savings, including reductions in administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are to keep higher education affordable, college and universities are 
going to have to make serious efforts to control costs," he said. "Each 
institution must identify its central mission and focus and then allocate 
resources accordingly with the understanding that no single institution can do 
everything well." 
</P>
<P>
The department said that college tuition rose at a rate of 8% a year throughout 
the 1980s. The average tuition at independent four-year institutions is now 
about $9,400 per year, compared to about $1,800 at public colleges and 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos said that many disadvantaged Americans are still able to attend less 
expensive institutions through financial assistance but that the costs at some 
colleges have become so high many students are deterred from applying. 
</P>
<P>
"Misperceptions may discourage students and families who are trying to prepare 
for college. They may think that the situation is hopeless, that they will not 
be able to afford a college education," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said high school guidance counselors had failed to adequately inform 
students about financial aid programs. He cited a General Accounting Office 
study which found that only 12% of high school sophomores were aware of key 
financial aid programs for college study. 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos said that many colleges so far have done little to cut costs, 
concentrating instead on redistributing the burden among those enrolled and on 
exploiting some families' willingness to pay higher charges.

Rivers swollen by torrential rains began receding as Seattle commuters 
weathered the loss of a major bridge, dairy farmers discovered herds lost and 
residents began returning to flooded homes. Losses were expected to reach into 
the tens of millions of dollars. Three counties in western Washington were 
declared federal disaster areas and others could be added to the list. Gov. 
Booth Gardner has sought the declaration for a total of 13 counties. Rep. Norm 
Dicks (D-Wash.) said he had received assurances for federal funds for the old 
Interstate 90 floating bridge that sank in Lake Washington.

Defense contractors and other companies accused in civil suits of defrauding 
the government paid out $257 million in fiscal 1990, the Justice Department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It is a major jump from the $27 million collected in fiscal 1985. The False 
Claims Act in 1986 began authorizing the government to recover triple damages. 
It also made it easier for private citizens to bring fraud suits on behalf of 
the government. In one 1990 case $34 million was recovered from a Japanese 
bid-rigging cartel in the procurement of U.S. military contracts.

A defendant in the Central Park jogger trial testified that police hit, coached 
and deceived him to make him confess to attacking a female jogger who was raped 
and almost beaten to death in April, 1989. Kharey Wise, 18, said detectives 
took him to a blood-covered spot in the New York City park and told him to 
smear the woman's congealed blood on his clothes. Wise and co-defendant Kevin 
Richardson, 16, are charged with multiple crimes in the attack on the jogger 
and two men.

A Walnut Creek woman who disappeared almost four weeks ago on her way to see a 
film in Berkeley was found safe Monday in Utah, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Oh, 35, a nurse and mother of two daughters, was to return home by plane 
Monday night, accompanied by FBI agents, after she was released from Latter Day 
Saints Hospital in Salt Lake City, Berkeley Police Lt. William Pittman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't be happier. This is going to be the best Christmas ever," said Lisa 
Fernandes, Oh's 19-year-old daughter, who assisted in a search for her mother 
after she disappeared Nov. 2. Police called the family at 4:30 p.m. Monday to 
say that Oh had been rescued and was in good condition, Fernandes said. 
</P>
<P>
Police told the family Oh was kidnaped, but they asked relatives not discuss 
details, Fernandes said. 
</P>
<P>
Oh disappeared shortly after calling Fernandes and her other daughter, Aimee 
Okniewski, 12, to say that her car had stalled near the UC Berkeley campus. 
Oh's keys were found in the ignition of her Volkswagen, parked near the Pacific 
Film Archive, where the single mother was to attend a film as a junior college 
class assignment.

MARY DUQUE DIES AFTER 40 YEARS WITH CHILDRENS HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mary Duque, the indefatigable altruist who helped raise more than $100 million 
for Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, died Sunday night. She was believed to be 
87. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Barker, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said Mrs. Duque died in her 
sleep at her Hancock Park home. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 40 years -- and at an average rate of nearly $3 million a year -- 
Mrs. Duque raised money so crippled children could learn to walk again and sick 
children could return to their homes and classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Childrens Hospital, with its 331 beds, 30 outpatient clinics and various other 
treatment programs, is considered the leading pediatric facility in the Western 
United States. Founded in 1901, it has been affiliated with the USC School of 
Medicine since 1932 and is the only pediatric trauma center in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
During her time on the hospital's board of directors, beginning in 1947 and 
culminating in her election to the board presidency in 1970 -- a post she still 
held at her death -- Mrs. Duque expanded women's support groups to nearly 3,700 
members serving in three dozen units in addition to the seven auxiliaries she 
found when she arrived. 
</P>
<P>
She personally pursued the purchase of the latest in medical equipment while 
finding time to attend the baptisms and funerals of the hospital's staff and 
their families, most of whom she considered friends. 
</P>
<P>
She solicited funds from people ranging from those she barely knew to those she 
had known since birth. 
</P>
<P>
Her late brother, Harold McAlister, was responsible for a single gift valued at 
$11 million. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Call, chairman of the hospital board, on Monday remembered Mrs. 
Duque as "a driving force behind the unprecedented growth of Childrens 
Hospital. . . . Mary was a rare human being with a special capacity for giving 
and a unique ability to inspire it in others." 
</P>
<P>
H. Russell Smith, an industrialist and chairman emeritus of the hospital board, 
described her simply as the "greatest giver of the opportunity to give by 
others in the history of Los Angeles. She built Childrens Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Duque (pronounced Du-kee), always skittish about her exact age, brought 
toys to patients, helped bring the hospital back from the brink of bankruptcy 
in 1980 and, almost until her death, visited the hospital daily. 
</P>
<P>
In the mornings she greeted the nursing staff with "Good morning, darling 
girls," and left at night saying "Goodby, darling girls." 
</P>
<P>
Friends were in awe of her cheerful energy and said she spoke in "triplicate," 
saying "thank you, thank you, thank you" or "hello, hello, hello." 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 26, 1973, the main building at the hospital at Sunset Boulevard and 
Vermont Avenue was named for her at a ceremony attended by hundreds of hospital 
staff, friends and admirers. In 1984, a Mary Duque Emeritus Endowment was 
started at the hospital, to honor its single greatest fund-raiser and to 
support teaching and research activities among the hospital's department heads. 
</P>
<P>
Born Mary McAlister to a banking family in St. Joseph, Mo., she came to Los 
Angeles as an infant, attended Westlake and Marlborough schools and then UC 
Berkeley and UCLA. She married attorney Gabriel C. Duque before graduating from 
college and had two sons, Gabriel Jr., who died in 1977, and James. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Duque had earned honorary degrees and several awards, among them selection 
in 1951 as a Los Angeles Times Woman of the Year. In 1969 she became the first 
recipient of the Dorothy Chandler Achievement Award given to former Times Women 
of the Year who have risen to even greater heights in their volunteer or 
professional careers. 
</P>
<P>
Asked many years ago how she had managed to raise such an enormous amount of 
money for a single cause, she disclaimed any special knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"If a child were lying injured in the street, everybody would rush to help, 
wouldn't they?" she asked. "It's the same here. Everyone wants to help. I just 
keep busy doing little things." 
</P>
<P>
Besides her son, Mrs. Duque, a widow, is survived by eight grandchildren and 
two great-grandchildren. In lieu of flowers her family is asking contributions 
to the Mary Duque Fund, Childrens Hospital, Box 29, 4650 Sunset Blvd., Los 
Angeles 90027.

HIS ABALONE GIVE UP SEX TO GAIN WEIGHT;

<P>
AQUACULTURE: A RESEARCHER STERILIZES THE SHELLFISH BY CREATING AN EXTRA SET OF 
CHROMOSOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a small laboratory next to Southern California Edison's Ormond Beach 
generating plant in Oxnard, a marine researcher is trying to make abalone 
forget about sex and channel their energy toward growing faster. 
</P>
<P>
The lab has produced sexless abalone as part of an experiment being conducted 
by Tom McCormick of Berkeley and financed by the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
McCormick, 39, studied aquaculture -- the science of raising plants or animals 
in water -- for two years in two of Japan's largest abalone hatcheries. At the 
Ormond Beach lab, he has devised a way to introduce an extra set of chromosomes 
into abalone, rendering them triploid, or sterile. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been some good work done with scallops and oysters as triploids," 
McCormick said. "Seedless watermelons are triploids. We have borrowed some of 
those techniques and applied them to abalone to create an animal that does not 
sexually mature. 
</P>
<P>
"We suspect the abalone will channel the energy not used for reproducing toward 
meat production and shell growth." 
</P>
<P>
McCormick and his helpers had been working toward a triploid abalone for 
several years when they finally met with success last January by carefully 
manipulating the fertilization of abalone eggs. 
</P>
<P>
"The male and female brood stock are placed in separate buckets and made to 
spawn through light conditions and special feedings," McCormick said. "We add 
the sperm to the eggs and stir it up. 
</P>
<P>
"Right after fertilization, we shock the egg with either cold or hot water," he 
said. "This prevents the egg from pinching off the third set of chromosomes. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
The larvae are then allowed to develop until they reach the size of small 
garden snails, when they are placed in one of the lab's specially designed 
tanks to feed on algae. When they are larger, they will be moved to another 
tank and will feed on kelp. 
</P>
<P>
Abalone, a mollusk prized for its delicately flavored meat and mother-of-pearl 
shell, grow only about an inch per year, so the experiment has required a lot 
of patience from McCormick and his assistants. But the results could aid other 
abalone farmers in producing a market-sized shellfish in less than the usual 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
"Man by nature is impatient. We don't want to wait a millennium for a perfect 
abalone."

LAW AND GOVERNMENT MAGNET SCHOOL SLATED TO OPEN IN L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: IT WOULD BE THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN THE STATE. THE EXPANSION OF THE 
PROGRAM DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE DISTRICT MAY USE FEDERAL GRANT MONEY.

<P>
California's first magnet school specializing in law and government is expected 
to open next fall at Monroe High School in Sepulveda, Los Angeles school 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The new magnet program would offer students the chance to study firsthand the 
workings of criminal and civil courts, police operations and a host of related 
fields, including court reporting, forensics and even politics, the officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District also hopes to expand its Downtown 
Business High School magnet to include its first fashion design program and to 
create its first public administration magnet at Wilson High School. In 
addition, district officials are hoping to open a math and science magnet at 
Westchester High School and a foreign language and international studies magnet 
at Gardena High School. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said final approval depends on whether the U.S. Department of 
Education will allow the district to use federal grant money for the projects. 
The financially strapped district hopes to use a portion of a $3.4-million 
grant it received two years ago, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The new magnets would join more than 90 specialized learning centers that serve 
about 30,000 of the system's 625,000 students. Currently, the magnets 
specialize in the sciences, performing arts, business and humanities, and are 
among the system's most popular programs. 
</P>
<P>
Courses in the fashion program would include design and marketing, with help 
expected from downtown garment industry professionals. The proposed public 
administration magnet would teach students how city and county government 
agencies operate. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the law and government program, Monroe Principal Joan Elam said she 
would like to convert one of the classrooms at the San Fernando Valley school 
into a simulated courtroom, where students could stage mock trials and hold 
debates. 
</P>
<P>
"Beginning in the 10th grade we are hoping to have regular trips to local 
courthouses, probation departments and police stations," Elam said. 
"Eleventh-graders will study state law and government, while seniors will 
concentrate on national and international law and government." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the chance that money troubles could delay the opening of the projects, 
Elam next week will visit law and government high schools operating in New 
York. Elam's trip is being subsidized in part by the Los Angeles Educational 
Partnership, a nonprofit organization sponsoring academic programs to improve 
city schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We support the law and government magnet," said Judy Johnson, the group's 
program director. 
</P>
<P>
School board member Julie Korenstein, who represents the area where Monroe is 
located, has also pushed for the magnet. "We hope students become intrigued and 
interested enough to pursue a law-related profession," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if students do not enter one of those fields, establishment of the school 
is important, said Marshall Croddy, program director for the Los Angeles-based 
Constitutional Rights Foundation. The foundation, a nonprofit educational 
group, has pushed for establishment of such a magnet in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"There are underlying values that infuse our entire governmental system," said 
Croddy. "We want students to have a much better understanding of those values 
and see how they are applied and to have a basic understanding of democratic 
principals and the value of the Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
Croddy said the Monroe magnet could attract students to law-related fields and 
help train good citizens and "adults who will be prepared to deal with a legal 
system that dominates our lives."

SANTA IS SORE, HIS BEARD IS LOOSE, BUT THE MAGIC HOLDS

Santa Leg Lift, don't fail me now. 
</P>
<P>
I was halfway through my first shift as Santa Claus, sitting in a sparkly 
winter forest setting at the center court of a Manhattan Beach mall, when this 
5-year-old who looked like he weighed 200 pounds walked up and waited to sit on 
my knee. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, named Chad, actually was no bigger than any child his age. Business at 
the Santa stand at the Manhattan Village Shopping Center had been brisk on the 
Friday after Thanksgiving. Having hoisted 60 other children into my lap, my 
back and shoulders ached as though a herd of reindeer had marched across them. 
</P>
<P>
It was time to use the Leg Lift. 
</P>
<P>
The lift is a movement perfected by generations of department store Santas in 
an attempt to avoid the back strain that comes from lifting children with their 
arms. By extending my left leg and dropping my left knee, I would enable Chad 
to sit on it by himself. Then, as I drew my left foot toward me, he would 
automatically rise to Santa's lap level. 
</P>
<P>
At least that is how they had explained it at Santa school. Chad had other 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
He started talking excitedly about how I had eaten the cookies and milk he left 
for me last Christmas. As he talked, he scooted around to my right leg and 
lifted his arms to be picked up. 
</P>
<P>
I was not about to break the magic spell. So I reached out with my white-gloved 
hands and lifted Chad to my right knee, grimacing under my beard as we chatted 
about chocolate chip cookies and toy trucks and the importance of brushing 
teeth and going to bed on time. 
</P>
<P>
There were more than 100 such magical moments during my first four hours as 
Santa. I found that the children were nicer than I had expected. Their parents 
were kinder. My back was sorer. There was none of the skepticism that I feared 
would come when the children looked past my phony beard and into my nervous 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Four-year-old Amy would not recite her Christmas wish list until she threw her 
arms around my padded waist. "I love you, Santa!" she blurted out. 
</P>
<P>
Stern-faced Charles, an 11-month-old who at seemed apprehensive, burst out 
laughing after he turned to see that I had a plastic-wrapped candy cane for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-month-old named Connor broke out in tears at his first glimpse of me. His 
mother stepped out of line to feed him and he returned a few minutes later with 
a contented look. "Connor doesn't talk much yet," said Anne Geiran. "But he 
told me what he wants for Christmas is peace in Saudi Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
Adults passing through the mall waved at Santa throughout the day. One kindly 
man took his reading glasses out of his shirt pocket and positioned them on the 
tip of his nose to alert me that my plain-glass Santa spectacles were pushed 
back too far on my face. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus, a boy of about 7, studied and quizzed me closely. "Where are your 
reindeer?" he asked, looking around the center court toward the 10 food stands 
behind me. Marcus was satisfied when I answered that they were visiting the 
zoo. Then he asked how I was getting home. I told him that they were coming 
back to the mall Friday night to pick me up. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus seemed to step away a believer. 
</P>
<P>
To my surprise, so did the other kids. 
</P>
<P>
No one yanked on my beard to see if it was real, although a few large children 
came close to inadvertently pulling it off my face when they slid from my lap. 
Several babies almost did the same thing by grabbing onto it or tangling their 
tiny hands in it. 
</P>
<P>
No one noticed that the beard seemed for a time to dance up and down on my face 
when I talked. That is because I poked a gob of its hair into my mouth the 
first time I tried to discreetly pop a breath mint through it. 
</P>
<P>
My boss, John McGill III, coordinator of mall Santas for Western Temporary 
Services, used extra double-faced adhesive tape in hopes of making the beard 
stick beneath my nose. It was only partially successful: We decided that I will 
shave off my real-life mustache before my next mall assignment. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of my shift, I took my aching back home for a long, steaming shower. 
</P>
<P>
My beard went for a soak in a bath of lukewarm water and Woolite.

STORM PASSES BY, LEAVING LITTLE RAIN

<P>
A weakened Alaskan storm that flooded parts of the Pacific Northwest hit 
Ventura County late Sunday but left only traces of rain. 
</P>
<P>
The storm brought only 0.04 inches of rain to the thirsty coast in light 
showers and bypassed the northwest county completely, Ventura County Flood 
Control hydrologists said. The storm dropped a meager 0.12 inches in Simi 
Valley, making it the wettest spot in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice, but it's not enough," said Rex Laird, executive director of the 
Ventura County Farm Bureau. Laird said the county needs 30 inches of rain to 
break the drought cycle of four dry years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures remained above freezing Sunday night and the county averted any 
frost damage, Deputy County Agricultural Commissioner David Buettner said. 
</P>
<P>
But temperatures were expected to drop below freezing in inland areas Monday 
night and some growers would have needed to protect their crops, said Terry 
Schaeffer, a National Weather Service meteorologist. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the colder weather, several shelters were prepared to take in the 
homeless Monday night, but the National Guard Armory in Oxnard was still 
closed, pending a vote by the County Board of Supervisors today. Since 1988, 
the armory, at 351 S. K St., has been open on nights when the temperature falls 
to 40 degrees or below or when it is 50 degrees and the chance of rain is 
greater than 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Strong winds gusting to 40 miles per hour in some areas buffeted trees on 
Sunday night and Monday, but caused no crop damage, Buettner said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Sheriff's Department and Southern California Edison reported 
no problems from the wind or light rain. 
</P>
<P>
Seas were rough with swells of 5 to 6 feet on Monday, and the National Weather 
Service issued a small craft advisory to warn small vessels against the high 
winds. The weather caused no accidents at sea, said Barbara Lawrence, a U.S. 
Coast Guard seaman apprentice stationed at the Channel Islands Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service forecasts warmer days, with temperatures rising to 
the mid-60s or mid-70s by the week's end. JOANNA M. MILLER

<TEXT>
<P>
Almost all public funding to build Casa Pacifica, a children's crisis care 
center, has been received and organizers will soon turn to the private sector 
for donations, said Administrative Director Pamela Burke. 
</P>
<P>
The county has provided more than half of the needed $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Casa Pacifica will receive $100,000 from the Ronald McDonald Children's 
Charities Invitational golf tournament, which was held at Sherwood Country Club 
in Westlake earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' Ball, which will also benefit Casa Pacifica, will be held at the 
Sherwood Country Club on Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Casa Pacifica, to be built on 22.8 acres in Camarillo, will have room for 85 
abused and abandoned children from Ventura County. The home will include four 
cottages, nursery, medical clinic, administration building, school, gymnasium, 
dining room and recreational areas. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers hope to select a final architectural plan for the facility in 
December, Burke said. The groundbreaking is planned for the summer of 1991, she 
said. MAJA RADEVICH

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAYOR EARNED COMMISSION ON LAND SALE HE 
PROMOTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lancaster Mayor William Pursley earned a real estate commission of about 
$10,000 on the sale of property that the mayor promoted by obtaining a special 
city exemption, according to associates. 
</P>
<P>
Mid Valley Real Estate in Lancaster, where the mayor works as an agent, 
confirmed Monday that Pursley received a $9,780.15 sales commission for 
representing his business partner, who was selling the land when Pursley asked 
the council for the exemption. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office said Monday that it will review the case to 
determine whether to open a criminal investigation because of the disclosure 
that Pursley may have profited from his June council vote. 
</P>
<P>
Pursley, who was elected to the Lancaster council in March, 1989, and selected 
mayor by his council colleagues this April, was out of the city and unavailable 
for comment, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
He had previously denied any wrongdoing in connection with the vote.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE DELAYS HEARING IN MENENDEZ CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Beverly Hills judge on Monday delayed the start of a preliminary hearing in 
the murder case against brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez while a state appeals 
court decides whether tapes made by their psychologist can be used as evidence 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Judge Charles Rubin said he will set a date for the hearing 
Dec. 14, a week after the 2nd District Court of Appeal holds a closed hearing 
on the tapes issue. 
</P>
<P>
The losing side is expected to appeal to the state Supreme Court, so lawyers do 
not expect the trial to begin before spring. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers are charged with killing their parents, entertainment industry 
executive Jose Menendez and his wife, Kitty, last year. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes, which a Santa Monica judge ruled are not privileged doctor-patient 
communications, include several cassettes dictated by Beverly Hills 
psychologist Jerome Oziel and one cassette said to include the brothers' 
voices.

<P>
An arson fire started by a Molotov cocktail thrown into a Watts duplex killed a 
man early Monday, authorities said. It was the second such reported incident in 
three days. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters found the victim of Monday's incident in a bedroom of the 
two-story duplex in the 2300 block of East 107th Street shortly after they 
extinguished the blaze, Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported at 1:46 a.m. Three companies of firefighters extinguished 
the blaze at 2:05 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was started by a Molotov cocktail thrown into the building, Acevedo 
said. No arrests were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Damage to the building was estimated at $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
No one else was injured in the fire, Acevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
Early Friday, a Molotov cocktail was thrown through the front window of a house 
in Pasadena, igniting a fire that injured a man and forced residents to flee.

MURDER TRIAL BEGINS FOR IMMIGRANT, 17 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old Mexican immigrant who allegedly stabbed a Thousand Oaks 
nurseryman with a butcher knife last spring went on trial Monday on a murder 
charge in Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Luis Navarro is being tried as an adult because a Juvenile Court judge 
ruled that he has been self-sufficient for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Narvaez, 49, died of deep stab wounds at the edge of a field in Thousand 
Oaks on the night of April 19. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard E. Holmes said in an opening statement that Narvaez 
and Navarro lived in the same apartment building in the 800 block of Warwick 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Narvaez on previous dates had asked the defendant to have sex with him, 
and apparently there was an agreement to do so," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes told the jury that autopsy evidence shows that Navarro sodomized Narvaez 
that night, but he added that a brawl began when Narvaez wanted to reciprocate. 
He said Navarro was struck several times, then stabbed Narvaez once in the 
stomach and three times in the back with a 9 1/2-inch butcher knife. 
</P>
<P>
The knife, later found at the scene, was stained with blood matching Narvaez's 
blood, Holmes said. And a woman who saw Navarro punch Narvaez and run from the 
scene described the suspect to the county sheriff's deputies who later arrested 
him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Public Defender Steven P. Lipson argued in his opening 
statement that Navarro was trying to protect himself from Narvaez's unwanted 
advances. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony is expected to continue today. MACK REED

ARTICLES ON ELECTION RESULTS INSULTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The articles highlighting the election results from the day before were 
extremely insulting. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult, at best, to get people out to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Why is it necessary to say to those who understand their social obligations, 
you have been "duped," your vote was bought? 
</P>
<P>
When I pushed that lever to make my choice, only my hand and my arm made the 
mechanism work -- it was my choice. As I looked over my shoulder, I didn't once 
see any deep-pocket individual attempting to influence my choice. 
</P>
<P>
Timing is extremely important for issues to strike the fancies of the voters. 
With such uncertainty in the economy, including potential unemployment, why 
would anyone expect the approval of bond issues over and beyond the bare social 
necessities. The public has repeatedly shown their distaste for increases in 
taxes in any form. 
</P>
<P>
Again, I resent the inference that I was duped and/or bought by deep-pocket 
groups and big business.

UNITED WAY VOLUNTEERS SALUTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our Ventura County residents have benefited immensely from the philanthropic 
community's unparalleled giving to United Way, with 64 agencies and other 
nonprofit organizations. Through hundreds of thousands of these citizens, who 
volunteer their time and give money, hope has been given to those searching for 
a warm shelter, learning how to read and needing food for their family. 
</P>
<P>
Giving in Ventura County reached an all-time high in 1989 as United Way donors 
contributed $5.6 million. This year's goal is to raise more than $6 million so 
that 250 programs will continue to be available to those who need help. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the large number of volunteers who support these programs, the impact 
of monetary contributions is many-fold greater than it would be otherwise.

DEAL AIMS FOR PARK INSTEAD OF LANDFILL; 
</P>
<P>
TOWSLEY CANYON: PLANNERS AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS ENVISION THE SITE AS A KEY PART 
OF A SANTA CLARITA VALLEY WILDERNESS RECREATION AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state parks agency and a private developer have joined forces to buy land 
that could hinder development of a proposed dump in Towsley Canyon in the Santa 
Clarita Valley and boost prospects for a big new state park there, officials 
confirmed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The complex deal calls for Rivendale Ranch Associates to acquire for the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy 271 acres in Towsley Canyon that the agency cannot 
purchase directly. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the development firm, which is in bankruptcy proceedings, would get 
an infusion of cash and take a step toward having a wilderness park, not a 
trash dump, for a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Towsley is one of four canyons ringing the San Fernando and Santa Clarita 
valleys that was recently identified by the Los Angeles County Sanitation 
Districts as a suitable landfill site. 
</P>
<P>
However, park planners and environmentalists also envision the canyon as a key 
part of a proposed Santa Clarita Woodlands State Park stretching north from the 
Santa Susana Mountains above Granada Hills into the Santa Clarita Valley. As a 
result, the conservancy, a state parks agency, has been competing with the 
sanitation districts for land there. 
</P>
<P>
A long-awaited feasibility study on the proposed state park is expected to be 
released today by the state Department of Parks and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
The 271-acre tract lies in the area that the sanitation districts want for a 
dump just west of the Golden State Freeway, near the city of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Brandon, a co-owner of the property, said Monday that he and his partners 
have agreed to sell the land to Rivendale for $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The districts have purchased options on at least 1,500 acres in Towsley Canyon, 
but are still competing with the conservancy for the Brandon tract in the heart 
of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
However, officials of the districts said Monday that the deal, if consummated, 
would not make development of a dump impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Maguin, solid waste chief for the districts, said he was disappointed 
about the deal but added, "I don't want to comment on how important Brandon is 
because it's intimate to the negotiations." If the conservancy were to acquire 
the Brandon tract, "it would probably affect our plan," Maguin said. "I 
guarantee you it would not kill our plan . . . to fill the canyon." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the conservancy, said the deal was 
not struck to thwart the districts. "We're buying it for the park beauties, and 
it would be a high priority to acquire whether there's a landfill there or 
not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rivendale-Brandon-conservancy deal, which could cost the conservancy $7 
million, is still contingent on approval by the conservancy's board, which 
could vote on the issue next week. It also depends on an as-yet uncompleted 
appraisal of 20 acres of Rivendale land that the conservancy would also buy. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of the Brandon property had sought $4.5 million, a price the conservancy 
legally could not pay. State law bars the agency from paying more for land than 
the appraised value, and an appraisal pegged the property's worth at $3.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
To come up with the extra $1 million for Brandon, the conservancy struck a deal 
with Rivendale. The conservancy is to pay Rivendale $3.5 million for a 20-acre 
tract near the mouth of Towsley Canyon. Rivendale essentially would keep $2.5 
million and apply the other $1 million of sale funds toward purchase of the 
Brandon property. That $1 million, plus another $3.5 million from the 
conservancy -- the money the state agency is able to pay -- would allow 
Rivendale to pay the $4.5 million asked for the Brandon property. 
</P>
<P>
Rivendale would then give the land to the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they did not know what would happen if the appraisal of 
Rivendale's 20 acres comes in under $3.5 million. "What happens is we're back 
to the drawing board," said Monroe Shearer, president of Rivendale. "I don't 
know what the resolution would be." 
</P>
<P>
Julie Zeidner, a spokeswoman for the conservancy, said she hoped that Rivendale 
would negotiate if the appraisal came in lower. "They're in financial straits 
right now, so they have incentive to negotiate with us." 
</P>
<P>
Rivendale wants to build a 58-acre commercial and residential development along 
the Old Road near the entrance to Towsley Canyon. The company earlier sold the 
conservancy 145 acres at the mouth of the canyon for an apparently below-market 
$500,000 in hopes of denying trash trucks access to the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Both Rivendale and the conservancy assumed that that sale would deny the trucks 
access to the canyon, but districts officials said they had an alternate route. 
The conservancy-Rivendale agreement represents a second attempt to assure that 
the canyon becomes a park instead of a dump. 
</P>
<P>
While unwilling to criticize the landfill plan, Shearer of Rivendale made clear 
the proposed development would be better off without a dump for a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the value of the park," Shearer said. "I like what the park does for 
our development. They are a good neighbor to us."

CLAIM FILED OVER POLICE DOG ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A claim for damages filed last week against the city of Oxnard is the third 
time in as many years that the city has faced a legal battle stemming from 
alleged biting incidents involving a police dog named Max. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Orlando Mack, 30, said in a claim filed last week that he was mauled by 
Max on May 26 when police went to his house on the 2000 block of Sanford Street 
to respond to a reported domestic dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The claim, a legal move required before a lawsuit can be filed against the 
city, does not say how much money Mack wants in compensation. But his lawyer, 
Gary C. Faucette, said Mack spent 10 days in the hospital and continues to 
receive medical treatment for the bites he suffered on his arm. 
</P>
<P>
Faucette said Mack's arm is disfigured by the "major ripping and tearing" he 
suffered. The claim also alleges that during the incident, police used racially 
derogatory language against Mack, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials declined to comment on the claim, in which Mack acknowledged 
that he was involved in a dispute with his two sisters but said he never posed 
a threat to the dog or police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a Superior Court jury awarded $58,840 to the family of a boy who 
was attacked by Max, a 90-pound malinois, in 1988. An attorney for the city 
said the city was responsible for the attack on Wesley Eaton, now 5, but argued 
that the damage to the boy and his family was minimal. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Aaron Person, 23, filed a $5,000 claim against the city, alleging 
that he was attacked by Max when police arrested him for resisting arrest. HUGO

JUDGE BLOCKS CHRISTMAS TREE LOT AT PIERCE; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: THE COURT HEARING HAD SOME HOLIDAY TOUCHES, BUT THE RULING AGAINST 
FARMER JOE CICERO PRESENTED HIM WITH HARD ECONOMIC REALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Saying she regretted she had to play Scrooge, a Los Angeles Superior Court 
judge stepped into the San Fernando Valley Christmas tree war Monday, ordering 
farmer Joe Cicero not to sell Christmas trees on land he leases from Pierce 
College. 
</P>
<P>
The decision followed a courtroom clash with distinctive holiday touches, such 
as discussions of sleigh rides, reindeer and the telltale signs of an illicit 
Christmas tree lot -- the construction of tinsel-wrapped arches, candy-striped 
poles, and green and white flags. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there was a harsh economic reality in the ruling by Judge Dzintra A. 
Janavs, granting the Los Angeles Community College District a temporary 
restraining order against Cicero. He's stuck with 8,000 Christmas trees -- at a 
cost of an estimated $120,000 -- and nowhere to sell them. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be just devastating and catastrophic to my client," said Harold 
Kippen, who represents the farmer, whose family has plowed Valley fields since 
1947. 
</P>
<P>
The victor was Miller &amp; Sons, one of the largest Christmas tree vendors in 
California. The company has 40 lots, including one across the street from 
Cicero's, which is on the campus in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
As owner Stu Miller and his lawyer tell it, the skirmish between the two men is 
a simple case of free enterprise -- too free. Cicero pays the college district 
about $15,000 to lease 25 acres of farmland at Pierce College, but was charged 
nothing extra last year to add Christmas trees to his usual produce stand sales 
of fruits, vegetables and Halloween pumpkins. 
</P>
<P>
"They're getting something for nothing," said attorney Michael B. Scott, who 
represents Miller. "My client is not out just to put Cicero out of business. . 
. . All he wants is the right to bid on the property." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who estimated his annual statewide sales at 400,000 trees -- 85,000 in 
the Valley alone -- said Cicero had caused him to lose at least 3,200 sales in 
December, 1989. Despite assurances from the college that no trees would be sold 
this year, he said his employees noticed tinseled arches and candy-striped 
poles going up at Cicero's stand in mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who sold trees at the college in 1986 in cooperation with the 
Associated Students Organization, said he has inquired annually since then 
about the possibility of selling there again. Letters from college officials 
filed with the court show that they repeatedly responded that they would not 
allow tree sales on the property. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not the big-guy bully," Miller said. "Joe Cicero's doing no more than 
stealing our business." 
</P>
<P>
But Kippen said it is just that: a case of the Goliaths -- Miller and the 
college district -- trying to squash a Yuletide David. 
</P>
<P>
Kippen conceded that Christmas trees were not in the five-year lease that 
Cicero signed with the district in 1986; in fact, the lease only calls for the 
sale of products grown on the land. But he said that since then, verbal 
agreements were made between his client and college officials to allow sales of 
other items, including pumpkins and trees. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at all the kiddies who are going to be without their sleigh rides," 
Kippen said, referring to the rides Cicero offered on his lot last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Miller lots sometimes feature live reindeer. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, Cicero, with the college's support, succeeded in defeating an 
identical request by Miller for a temporary restraining order. But in the 
months that followed, the college switched sides, joining Miller. A series of 
telephone calls and letters to Cicero followed, banning 1990 sales on college 
property. 
</P>
<P>
James Lynch, assistant general counsel for the college district, said the 
change of mind was largely the result of a lawsuit by Miller against the 
district. That suit, filed concurrently with the action taken against Cicero in 
late 1989, alleged that the district fostered unfair competition by failing to 
allow others to bid on the right to sell trees from the campus location, in 
violation of state laws covering profit-making activities on public land. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an obligation as a public agency to do what we feel is right with the 
taxpayers' money," Lynch said. "It does us no good financially to continue 
fighting this lawsuit, which could be very lengthy." 
</P>
<P>
Lynch said that a year ago, the district sided with Cicero because the then-new 
Pierce College president, Dan Means, had inadvertently granted him permission 
to sell trees. 
</P>
<P>
Under a settlement agreement with Miller signed earlier this year, the college 
agreed that no more trees would be sold on the land until Cicero's lease 
expires in December, 1991. That agreement comes before a judge for ratification 
Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
In her ruling Monday, Janavs rejected Miller's contentions of unfair 
competition: "What's unfair about someone selling Christmas trees competing 
with someone else?" she asked. But she agreed with the college district's 
assertion that Cicero's lease did not include Christmas tree sales. 
</P>
<P>
"I am bothered by the fact that Cicero seems to be quite deliberately trying to 
go outside the bounds of that agreement," Janavs said. 
</P>
<P>
Kippen said he would discuss with Cicero the possibility of appealing.

ANIMALS: ROBERT RIDENOUR SAYS ARNOLD IS CLEANER AND SMARTER THAN OTHER PETS. 
THE CITY OF BURBANK DISAGREES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
All this little piggy wants to do is stay in Burbank. But city officials say 
Arnold, a miniature pig with a bulging belly, belongs on a farm, not in Robert 
Ridenour's suburban home. 
</P>
<P>
Ridenour was cited last month for keeping Arnold, a Vietnamese potbellied pig, 
at his house on Grinnell Drive. Ridenour, however, is challenging the citation, 
claiming that his foot-high, 45-pound pig is a far cry from the 800-pound 
oinkers that win blue ribbons at the county fair and that city ordinances were 
intended to prohibit. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold is the victim of prejudice and misunderstanding, Ridenour said. The 
citation, which would require Ridenour to get rid of his pet, is on hold 
pending a review by the Burbank City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The pig was given to Ridenour's roommate by Jackie Stallone, Sylvester's 
mother. She reportedly bought it as a birthday gift for one of her sons, but 
the surprise was not well received and she gave Arnold to Ridenour and Steve 
Erhardt to watch until a permanent home could be found. 
</P>
<P>
That was three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Ridenour and Erhardt have decided to keep Arnold, who they say is 
cleaner and smarter than their dog, Oki. The housebroken pig has been trained 
to come when called, sit on command and climb up stepladders. 
</P>
<P>
Miniature Vietnamese pigs are short and black with round bellies that nearly 
drag on the ground. They have become chic pets since they were introduced in 
this country four years ago, with females selling for as much as $3,500, said 
Phyllis Frisbey, founder of the Southern California Potbellied Pig Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Frisbey estimated that several hundred Southern California residents own the 
pigs but are reluctant to go public because they are illegal in many cities, 
including Los Angeles. "Some people are pig prejudiced," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Ridenour nor Burbank animal control authorities were certain Monday who 
squealed about Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
The National Animal Disease Center, a branch of the U. S. Department of 
Agriculture, has said Vietnamese pigs pose less of a health threat to humans 
than cats or dogs and, when cared for properly, are cleaner than other domestic 
pets. Even so, many cities refuse to allow the pigs as pets. 
</P>
<P>
Although Burbank officials acknowledge that the pigs may make good pets, they 
still are illegal under the Burbank Municipal Code. A pig is a pig and a pig is 
illegal, according to Section 6-301, which outlaws more than 90 animals. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an ordinance that says no pigs. It's as simple as that," said Fred 
DeLange, superintendent of the Burbank Animal Shelter. "It doesn't say anything 
about Vietnamese potbellied pigs. It just says no pigs." 
</P>
<P>
The same ordinance also prohibits lions, tigers and bears. Horses are allowed 
in some neighborhoods that have appropriate zoning. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles prohibits farm animals except on land zoned for agriculture, but 
Frisbey said her 60-member association is trying to persuade the City Council 
to change the law. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Monterey Park became the first city in the county to allow 
residents to keep the pigs as pets, one per household. "We found that they made 
pretty good pets," Monterey Park Police Capt. Jim Strait said. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities have not been so flexible. In La Habra Heights, for example, a 
couple said they would rather move than give up their two pigs, Elmer and Miss 
Piggy. 
</P>
<P>
Ridenour said that if the City Council does not allow the miniature pigs to 
live in Burbank, he will challenge the ordinance in court.

MAYOR WAS PAID FOR LAND SALE, FIRM SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
LANCASTER: HE RECEIVED A COMMISSION AFTER HELPING A BUSINESS PARTNER GET AN 
EXEMPTION, THE REALTY COMPANY CONFIRMED. THE D. A.'S OFFICE WILL REVIEW THE 
CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Lancaster Mayor William Pursley earned a real estate commission of nearly 
$10,000 on the sale of property that he promoted by obtaining a special city 
exemption, according to associates. 
</P>
<P>
Mid Valley Real Estate in Lancaster, where the mayor works as an agent, 
confirmed Monday that Pursley received a $9,780.15 sales commission for 
representing his business partner, who was selling the land when Pursley asked 
the council for the exemption. 
</P>
<P>
The county district attorney's office said Monday that it will review the case 
to determine whether to open a criminal investigation because of the disclosure 
that Pursley may have profited from his June council vote. 
</P>
<P>
Pursley, who was elected to the Lancaster council in March, 1989, and was 
selected mayor by his council colleagues in April, was out of the city and 
unavailable for comment Monday, city officials said. He had previously denied 
any wrongdoing in the vote. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported Sunday that Pursley had introduced and voted for a measure 
passed by the Lancaster council June 18 to reduce the size of a city-required 
street easement along one edge of a parcel of nearly one acre that Pursley's 
business partner was on the verge of selling. 
</P>
<P>
The council action helped clinch the sale, according to Lancaster insurance 
broker Clyde Golding, half owner of the site and partner with Pursley in a 
separate real estate venture. It also earned a commission for the real estate 
office where Pursley works, which handled the sale. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday's disclosure was the first that Pursley himself had directly 
profited from the transaction, broadening the legal conflict-of-interest 
questions in the case beyond whether the mayor's official actions may have 
improperly benefited only his partner and his employer. 
</P>
<P>
Routine conflict-of-interest cases are typically reviewed by the state's Fair 
Political Practices Commission, which can fine violators. The FPPC is already 
investigating Pursley for failing to disclose several hundred thousand dollars 
of income last year in unrelated cases. The agency had no comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
However, in some cases, such as those involving evidence that a politician has 
personally profited from an official action, the district attorney's office can 
file criminal conflict-of-interest charges. Those convicted can be banned from 
running for office for four years. 
</P>
<P>
The Pursley case recalled the criminal conflict-of-interest charges brought by 
the district attorney's office in December, 1985, against then-Lancaster 
Councilman Louis Bozigian, a real estate agent who now is a co-owner of Mid 
Valley Real Estate where Pursley works. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors charged that Bozigian, as mayor, had voted in 1984 for a street 
grid that benefited property, in escrow at the time, that Bozigian was 
representing as a real estate agent and for which he received a commission of 
about $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bozigian was acquitted by a Municipal Court jury in May, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
State law makes it illegal for any public official to participate in or vote on 
any decision having "a material financial effect" of $250 or more on the 
officeholder's income. 
</P>
<P>
Golding and others have said his property was in escrow at the time of the 
council's vote. Pursley acknowledged previously bringing the listing to the Mid 
Valley office. And an official there said Monday that it is "pretty normal" for 
agents who bring in listings to get some payment at the time of sale. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Gilley, a co-owner of Mid Valley along with Bozigian and his brother Ralph, 
said Golding's property sold for $221,772. Of the 10% commission -- $22,177.20 
-- Gilley said Pursley's share as the agent for Golding was the $9,780.15 
amount, paid in mid-August after the close of escrow. 
</P>
<P>
Gilley, a former city manager of Lancaster, said Mid Valley took about $4,163 
as its share. The remaining $8,234 went to Charla Abbott, another Mid Valley 
agent and Pursley's appointee to the city's parks commission, who represented 
the buyer, Farmers Insurance Exchange.

SANTA CLARITA GROWTH PLAN PROPOSES CAP OF 475 UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A citizens group that hopes to put a growth-control initiative on the ballot in 
Santa Clarita released a statement Monday saying the measure would allow only 
475 new housing units to be built in the city a year. 
</P>
<P>
Such a cap would be below present building trends in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Since Santa Clarita incorporated three years ago, the City Council has approved 
1,717 houses, apartments and condominiums, roughly 572 units a year, according 
to a recent city report. The council also approved 429 other residential units 
during that time, but those projects had already received preliminary approval 
from Los Angeles County, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The press release announcing the proposed building cap was accidentally issued 
two days early by members of the Citizen's Assn. for a Responsible Residential 
Initiative on Growth, or CARRING. The group had planned to release a draft of 
the slow-growth initiative Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
John Drew, chairman of the group, would not confirm or deny the information in 
the press release and said the group would discuss the initiative Wednesday. 
Drew would only say that the figure of 475 housing units was not official. 
</P>
<P>
CARRING has been working on the initiative for months, and city officials and 
local developers have been awaiting its release. 
</P>
<P>
The press release said the initiative would allow "475 homes a year," but it 
was unclear whether the figure referred to only single-family houses or all 
dwelling units. The release did not detail how the 475 figure was reached, but 
said it reflected growth trends in Los Angeles County in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
A public opinion poll commissioned by the Santa Clarita City Council this year 
showed strong support for a growth-control measure in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The poll, released in June, found that 78% of those polled would strongly or 
somewhat support an initiative to slow growth. The poll had a margin of error 
of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

JURY SAYS TRANSIENT UNFIT FOR TRIAL IN GIRLFRIEND'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A 22-year-old transient who told jurors that he is a "fallen angel" and has 
conversed with Jesus was found incompetent to stand trial in the stabbing death 
of his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
A Van Nuys Superior Court jury deliberated for about three hours before 
deciding that Christopher Michael Rowland is incapable of cooperating with his 
attorney and assisting in his defense as required by state law and the U.S. 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland is accused of stabbing 18-year-old Roberta Mosentheim in a Van Nuys 
motel on Feb. 12. The couple had known each other only eight days but were 
planning to be married, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge James M. Coleman ordered Rowland to return to court on Dec. 17, when he 
is expected to be sent to a mental health facility recommended by county health 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier jury charged with assessing Rowland's competence deadlocked, 9 to 3, 
in favor of finding Rowland incompetent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
During the second hearing, Rowland reiterated his claims that he had spoken to 
Jesus and was a fallen angel. Three psychiatrists, called as witnesses by 
Rowland's attorney, testified that Rowland is a paranoid schizophrenic and 
suffers from severe depression. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland insisted that he is competent to stand trial and accused the public 
defender's office of working with prosecutors to lock him away in a mental 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Mosentheim's body was found in the Chateau Motel in the 6700 block of Sepulveda 
Boulevard with Rowland's T-shirt draped over her head. Family members said 
Mosentheim fell in love with Rowland after being introduced to him by her 
brother, who brought Rowland home after meeting him on a bus. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland had been released on parole from state prison in Chino two months 
before the killing after serving four years for assault, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland's attorney, Deputy Public Defender William Thornbury, said Rowland will 
probably undergo treatment with medication and counseling. If he later is found 
to be mentally competent, he will be returned to stand trial.

DRIVER ARRESTED AFTER 3 ACCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspected drunk driver caused at least three traffic accidents Monday, 
including one that broke a water main, flooding Sherman Way in Van Nuys for an 
hour and a half, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Antonio Sandoval, 32, of Van Nuys was arrested on suspicion of felony 
drunk driving, Officer Walter Hogue said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Sandoval struck one vehicle that was stopped at a curb at Sherman 
Way and Sepulveda Boulevard while the occupants read a map. "He fled from that 
accident with them chasing him," Hogue said. "He jumped a center divider, hit a 
westbound car and that car hit another car." 
</P>
<P>
Sandoval's car struck a water main on the center divider, sending water 
shooting into the air, police said. Westbound lanes of Sherman Way were closed 
for an hour and a half while workers repaired the broken line.

GOING TO COURT: The Capistrano Unified School District is usually tops in 
grades but near the bottom in state funding. So officials Wednesday will 
announce they are suing for more money. . . . With per-student funding lowest 
among the county's unified districts -- more than $300 per student less than 
Newport-Mesa's, for example -- Capistrano argues that it should be getting more 
money under the landmark Serrano-Priest Supreme Court decision, which mandates 
equal funding for similar districts. . . . To bolster its case, Capistrano has 
hired the Los Angeles attorney who won the Serrano Priest case nearly 20 years 
ago. Tony Marcano and Jim Newton

GETTING READY: Shelter officials are hoping that the recent cold snap (A3) is 
not an indication of a rough winter ahead. . . . When nights get cold, armories 
in Santa Ana and Fullerton open as emergency shelter for the homeless. . . . 
Last winter, a mild one, forced them to open only 14 times compared to 28 the 
previous winter. Nonetheless, officials are planning for the worst. "We're just 
never sure what the weather is going to do," says one. Tony Marcano and Jim

HEARING OPENS FOR MAN ACCUSED OF SLASHING GIRL

A man accused of throwing a glass shard that disfigured 15-year-old Amber 
Jefferson last August also hit her in the knee with a baseball bat while trying 
to strike another man, according to court testimony on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony came in the preliminary hearing for Kurt David Wimberly, 18, who 
is suspected of injuring Amber during a brawl at an apartment complex in the 
Stanton area on the night of Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
The case has received widespread attention because Amber, her family and 
civil-rights advocates have contended that she was attacked because of her 
race. Her mother is white and her father is black. Orange County district 
attorney officials declined to charge Wimberly under the state's law against 
hate attacks, charging him instead with mayhem, a felony that carries a 
sentence of up to nine years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The first day's testimony gave no indication of a racial dispute. Instead, it 
focused on a dispute that two teen-age girls were having over Wimberly -- a 
quarrel that subsequently erupted into violence. 
</P>
<P>
In West Municipal Court on Monday, Wimberly sat quietly in an orange-colored 
jail jumpsuit during the hearing before Judge J. Michael Beecher. The hearing, 
which will continue this morning, is to decide whether Wimberly should be bound 
over for trial by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
The only witness to testify Monday was Michelle Schimmer, 16, who was with 
Amber the night she was injured. She testified that she, Amber and some young 
male acquaintances drove to the apartment complex where Wimberly, who she said 
was once her boyfriend, lived. She said that she got out of the car at the 
complex to talk to a young woman whom Wimberly had been seeing. 
</P>
<P>
Schimmer said that as she was talking to the young woman, whom she identified 
only as "Colleen," Wimberly came out of his apartment carrying a baseball bat. 
Schimmer said that Wimberly swung the bat at one of the young men with her, but 
missed and instead hit Amber on the knee. 
</P>
<P>
Schimmer said that she and other friends helped Amber back to the car. Schimmer 
said that she and Amber soon left the car, after which she said she saw Amber 
bleeding from a head wound. Schimmer said she did not see who caused the head 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Wimberly's defense attorney, Sal Ciulla, asked Schimmer about events that led 
up to the Aug. 6 incident. Schimmer replied that she and Amber had been at a 
motel earlier that night, looking for a party that did not materialize. They 
were only there a few minutes, Schimmer testified, and while they were there, 
she and Amber took a few sips of vodka and orange juice. The young men they 
were with then drove them to the Stanton-area apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
There had been a dispute, but no violence, the night before at the same 
complex, and it also involved Schimmer and "Colleen," Schimmer testified. She 
said some young men that previous night had also brandished "either boards or 
baseball bats." 
</P>
<P>
Schimmer is to resume her testimony this morning, and Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Kathleen Harper said she will have Amber take the witness stand this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the court room, Amber and a friend, Ralph Jones, 17, of Anaheim, said 
they were certain the attack on her was racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutor Harper said during a televised interview outside the courtroom 
that she does not believe that the attack was racially motivated. "It was a 
huge brawl," Harper said. "It was something between two groups of people that 
got out of hand."

AFTER-HOURS TUTORING FOR MINORITIES

<P>
At precisely 2:50 p.m., the bell rings at Buena Park Junior High School, 
sending excited students scrambling for the bus. But while her classmates 
hurriedly make plans for the evening and gossip about the day's events, Kenya 
Jamison buckles down for another hour of work. 
</P>
<P>
The eighth-grader isn't staying after school because she is in trouble, but 
rather because she chooses to. A slender girl with dark-brown eyes and a 
penchant for volleyball, Jamison wants to go to college. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a 2.86 average," she explained in between math problems. "I really want 
to get it up to at least a B." 
</P>
<P>
To improve their grades, Jamison and 28 other students have volunteered to put 
in extra hours at school. They are participating in a pilot program sponsored 
jointly by Fullerton College and local schools that is geared for students who 
have the potential to go to college but who, for some reason, are not doing 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"We are dealing with a society that has changed dramatically," said Richard 
Ramirez, dean of student support services at Fullerton College. "We are 
recognizing that we have to do more than stay on campus." 
</P>
<P>
For these "at-risk" students -- many from ethnically diverse backgrounds and 
low-income families -- it is a matter of being pointed in the right direction, 
he said. Besides lacking economic support, they frequently don't get course 
materials that suit their needs. "Often it is a question of not having a 
curriculum that culturally different folks can identify with," Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
To give students this sense of connection -- and keep minority students from 
dropping out -- Ramirez and other school officials decided to bring part of the 
college experience to them. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton College has allocated $24,000 to get the special tutoring program off 
the ground. So far, six junior high and high schools in Buena Park, Fullerton 
and La Habra have elected to participate. 
</P>
<P>
The money is used to help provide an hour of free tutoring every day. To create 
a sense of responsibility and a "college-like" atmosphere, the students have 
the choice to show up or not. Typical high school rules don't apply, such as 
the prohibitions against eating and talking with friends. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want it to be like a classroom," said Debbie Diaz, coordinator of 
the Learning Center at Buena Park Junior High School, where the tutoring 
occurs. "The kids don't have to be here. . . . We tell them that. We are not 
mandating anything, just providing the service." 
</P>
<P>
Parents also get involved with group meetings and are taught how to encourage 
their children to do well in school. Moreover, there are field trips to local 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
This month, for example, the students visited Fullerton College. Other stops 
will include Cal State Fullerton and a private school. 
</P>
<P>
For Jamison and several of the other students, the trip to Fullerton College 
was the first look at higher education. "At first I thought it was just going 
to be more school," Jamison said. "But it looked exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Some students said they actually like the tutoring they receive. "It is good, 
because you feel free to ask questions," said Jeff Cervantes, who would like to 
attend USC. Cervantes, who wore a "Learning Center" sweat shirt, said that the 
program's popularity has spread around campus. "At first other people would 
call us stupid because we need tutoring," he said, "but when they found out 
about it, then they wanted to get in." 
</P>
<P>
On a typical day, seven to 10 students show up for the tutoring session. The 
class is led by a student from Fullerton College and peer tutors like Alejandro 
Vazquez, an eighth-grader with a 3.71 grade-point average. Vazquez, 13, said he 
enjoys helping his friends. "When I came from Mexico, I didn't know English," 
he said. "People helped me, so I want to help them back." 
</P>
<P>
The students work on subjects they are having trouble with, and when they 
finish, they are free to leave. They are also permitted to work in groups or 
get individual help with the tutors. 
</P>
<P>
Although the program began only recently, Diaz, the program coordinator, said 
she is astounded by the response, especially since the students must give up 
free time to do schoolwork. "When we first started, I thought if we got five or 
six kids it would be great," she said. 
</P>
<P>
To date, however, as many as 29 have signed up, and more are showing an 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
"They are coming," Diaz said. "It is wonderful."LYNDA NATALI

COUNCIL CHOOSES CURTIS AS MAYOR

<P>
Councilman Robert A. Curtis was elected the fourth mayor of Mission Viejo 
Monday night, and he pledged to lead the city into a new era of unity. 
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural speech, Curtis said the last three years were marred by a 
"fierce and continuous conflict that shook the very foundation of our fledgling 
city." 
</P>
<P>
Three new council members -- Sharon Cody, Robert Breton and Susan Withrow -- 
were sworn in by U.S. Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) during a ceremony at the 
Oso Viejo Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis was elected unanimously to serve a one-year term in office. Curtis in 
February defeated a recall effort backed by nearly $500,000 in contributions by 
the Mission Viejo Co. and other real estate interests. Cody, who supported the 
anti-recall campaign and was the top vote-getter in the Nov. 6 election, was 
elected vice mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Three outgoing council members -- Christian W. Keena, Victoria C. Jaffe and 
Norman P. Murray -- had supported the Curtis recall campaign, arguing that 
Curtis' presence was disruptive to the council. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis said Monday that he appreciates what it is to be a political minority, 
and he pledged to respect "differing views" and to protect "dissenting voices." 
</P>
<P>
Outlining his agenda for the 3-year-old city, Curtis said the city should 
reconsider spending $1 million to renovate a building it recently bought for a 
city hall. Curtis has favored an offer by the Mission Viejo Co. to donate 7.2 
acres for a civic center in return for permission to build a 700-housing unit 
development near the eastern boundary of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mission Viejo is to accept its leadership role in South Orange County, then 
surely our seat of government should be a source of pride in keeping with that 
pre-eminent status," Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not call for a Taj Mahal, but I do share voters' expectations that we 
exercise foresight and prudent business practices to ensure that our civic 
facilities meet future needs and engender pride among our residents." 
</P>
<P>
The new council, he said, will also ask the city attorney whether it can 
overturn a $15-million refuse hauling franchise awarded to Dewey's Rubbish 
without a competitive bid. DAVAN MAHARAJ

CITY DEALT SETBACK ON HOMELESS SWEEPS

<P>
A judge disqualified the city attorney's office Monday from prosecuting 22 
homeless people who were charged with such minor offenses as littering and 
jaywalking during controversial police sweeps at the Civic Center in August. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Judge Barbara T. Nomoto agreed with defense lawyers that city 
prosecutors had a conflict of interest because they also advise and represent 
Santa Ana police. 
</P>
<P>
Nomoto's ruling means that the district attorney or the state attorney general 
will have to step in if the cases are to proceed. A spokesman for Dist. Atty. 
Michael R. Capizzi said prosecutors have not decided whether to accept the 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
"The city attorney plays prosecutor on the one hand and counsels the police 
department on the other," Deputy Public Defender Paul T. DeQuattro said. "As 
prosecutors, they no longer represent just the state of California. They are in 
an adversarial position." 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy City Atty. Charles H. Smith disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have handled the cases the same way as any other," Smith said. "I 
don't pass out favors or prosecute the cases harder just because the defendants 
might have something against the city." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Duane Bennett, legal adviser to the police, said motions to 
remove city prosecutors are rare. 
</P>
<P>
The 22 street people accused in the cases are among 90 arrested during two 
roundups at the Civic Center. Charges ranged from urinating in public to 
littering and jaywalking. In the first sweep, the homeless were taken to Santa 
Ana Stadium and chained to bleachers after officers drew numbers on their arms 
for identification. 
</P>
<P>
The sweeps sparked a class-action suit to halt future police roundups against 
the homeless. Last month, the city reached a settlement by agreeing not to 
target homeless people in similar police actions. The agreement emphasized that 
the Police Department was not liable for actions taken during the sweeps.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TRANSIT PLANNER TO HEAD NEW RAIL OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County transportation officials on Monday established a new rail program 
office, to be headed by veteran transit planner Brian Pearson. 
</P>
<P>
The action came during a joint meeting of the Orange County Transit District 
board and the Orange County Transportation Commission, which are in the process 
of merging into one super agency. 
</P>
<P>
Pearson, 51, of Laguna Hills, is the transit district's director of 
development. He has supervised OCTD's plans for special, elevated ramps 
reserved for buses and car-pools that will soar over congested freeway 
interchanges. 
</P>
<P>
Pearson, who will report to Stanley T. Oftelie, executive director of the 
transportation commission, will help develop plans for a 23-mile light-rail 
system that possibly will serve six cities between Irvine and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The transit district, however, will continue to pay Pearson his $80,000 annual 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
The planned light-rail system, dubbed the "Orange Line" by OCTC Chairman Dana 
W. Reed on Monday, may use monorail vehicles, although no specific technology 
has been selected yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Please think big," Reed admonished Pearson during Monday's joint meeting. 
"It's not enough to get from Santa Ana to Irvine . . . but from Santa Monica to 
Irvine." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said he was referring to plans to link Orange County light-rail projects 
with those in neighboring counties. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the urban "core" system currently being studied, officials 
agreed Monday to pursue purchase of a 5-mile stretch of old Pacific Electric 
"Red Car" right of way and an adjacent, 3.8-acre site for a passenger depot 
between Beach Boulevard in Stanton and the Los Angeles County border. The 
purchase is expected to cost $13.9 million, with the money expected to come 
from Measure M, the half-cent county sales tax hike approved by voters on Nov.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PUBLIC INPUT SOUGHT ON NEW AREA CODES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County residents will have a chance to evaluate and comment on proposals 
to split the 714 area code during two meetings sponsored by GTE and Pacific 
Bell this week. 
</P>
<P>
Both companies recommend a plan that would keep all of Orange County in the 714 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside and San Bernardino counties, as well as Claremont, Diamond Bar and 
Pomona in eastern Los Angeles County, would be placed in a new 909 area, phone 
company officials said. The new boundaries will be announced in January, after 
evaluation of customer input, and take effect about two years later. 
</P>
<P>
The first meeting will be held from 7 to 9 tonight at the Brea Civic and 
Cultural Center at 1 Civic Center Circle. 
</P>
<P>
Another meeting will take place on Friday at Irvine City Hall, 1 Civic Center 
Plaza, from 7 to 9 p.m.

ORDINANCE ON POOL FENCING IS STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA MICHAELIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council took up the issue of extra fencing around swimming pools at a 
study session Monday, but decided to delay action on a proposed ordinance until 
a county committee finalizes its policy. 
</P>
<P>
The fencing proposal has arisen because of concerns over pool safety and the 
frequency of child drownings in Orange County. Local pool safety advocate Jim 
Landis, whose son nearly drowned in a pool accident last year, asked the 
council to keep an open mind about the proposal and to consider the issue a 
matter of public safety. 
</P>
<P>
"For those of you who indicate that it is a matter of private concern, please 
remember that many of the kids who don't die in these pools end up in state 
hospitals . . . ," Landis said. "All we're trying to do is protect the 
children. There have been two deaths this year in Newport Beach alone." 
</P>
<P>
In September, the International Conference of Building Officials met and drew 
up a model ordinance for cities and states interested in adopting safety 
measures for residential pools. The policy would require four sides of fencing 
around all pools. Where the house is used as the fourth side, then the 
ordinance would require doors that close and lock automatically, as well as 
door alarms. 
</P>
<P>
Among the questions still to be addressed by any policy are whether the 
ordinance should apply to all homes or just newly installed pools, and whether 
residents without children would be exempt from the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Clarence J. Turner said the city should adopt such an ordinance. "It 
seems to me that this is a problem that cries out for addressing," he said. 
"We've had a plethora of deaths from infants falling into pools." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Hedges disagreed, saying it was out of the council's 
jurisdiction to address private safety issues.

VARDOULIS TO TAKE COUNCIL SEAT TODAY

<P>
Bill Vardoulis, who won a City Council seat in the Nov. 6 election, is 
scheduled to be sworn into office this afternoon and participate in his first 
council meeting in six years. 
</P>
<P>
Vardoulis, 52, bested four other candidates in the special election to fill the 
fifth council seat. 
</P>
<P>
That seat has remained open since July, when Sally Anne Sheridan resigned to 
become mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Vardoulis, a council member from 1976 to 1984, has said he will take a 
conservative approach to city government and will try to cut spending. Next 
spring, the council will be considering the city's 1991-93 two-year budget. 
</P>
<P>
The open seat, with two years remaining on its term, was a hot political topic 
in the city during the summer and fall after two lawsuits and one petition were 
filed to define who would take the seat. 
</P>
<P>
In August, a Superior Court judge ruled that the open seat belonged to Mary Ann 
Gaido, who had sued the city to overturn a citizens' petition calling for a 
special election. Gaido, as the runner-up in the June council race, would have 
taken the seat had the petition not been filed. The city won an appeal of the 
ruling in October, putting the election back on track. 
</P>
<P>
Vardoulis won the election with 11,409 votes, a handy margin over his nearest 
competitor, Michael Tague, who received 7,647 votes. TOM McQUEENEY

FOWLIE LAWYERS SAY 9 DRUG-CASE CHARGES INVALID 
</P>

Defense lawyers and prosecutors in the marijuana smuggling case against Daniel 
James Fowlie sparred in court Monday over whether Fowlie was being improperly 
charged with felonies that were not part of his extradition from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys James Brustman and G. David Haigh argued before U.S. District Judge 
Alicemarie Stotler that their client was not extradited to the United States in 
July to face all 26 counts filed in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Haigh and Brustman say nine charges, including operating a continuing criminal 
enterprise and making illegal money transfers, have no equivalent in Mexican 
law, hence Fowlie cannot face such charges in the United States. They said the 
Mexican authorities returned Fowlie only to face the drug smuggling 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant U.S. Atty. Elana S. Artson contended that Fowlie's extradition 
from a prison in La Paz in July was for all 26 counts -- charges that she said 
are part of the U.S. extradition treaty with Mexico. She said the only way 
Fowlie could challenge the extradition was in a Mexican court. 
</P>
<P>
Stotler began hearing arguments and taking testimony on Fowlie's extradition 
order Monday at the federal courthouse in Santa Ana. The defense seeks to have 
the nine counts in question dismissed. Testimony resumes today. 
</P>
<P>
According to a 32-page indictment, Fowlie, 57, is accused of income-tax 
evasion, distributing or intending to distribute about 53,000 pounds of 
marijuana, failing to report the shipment of hundreds of thousands of dollars 
overseas and operating a continuing criminal enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators suspect that Fowlie operated one of the largest marijuana 
smuggling operations in the United States from 1982 to 1986, using rented 
warehouses in Orange County and Rancho del Rio, a 213-acre property on the 
Orange County-Riverside County line.

<P>
RAMS: SUNDAY'S VICTORY OVER THE 49ERS DOESN'T SALVAGE THE SEASON, BUT IT 
CERTAINLY WILL MAKE IT MORE FUN TO PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The last time anybody checked, beating the Greatest Team in the History of the 
NFL still only counts as one victory -- unless you are the Rams, who have to 
cling to whatever successes they can. 
</P>
<P>
Then, every victory is worth a celebration, especially one that ends the 
two-time defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers' 18-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, in the feel-good performance of the year, the Rams beat the 49ers on 
the soggy Candlestick Park grass, 28-17, and improved to only 4-7 but their 
spirits rose from the depths of season-long depression. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I don't think this makes our season, because I don't think any one game 
can make a season," quarterback Jim Everett said. "But I'll tell you, it's a 
game that we will cherish very much. There's no question about that. It's a 
game that means a lot to us." 
</P>
<P>
With their goals for 1990 demolished by their 3-7 start, the Rams spent Monday 
savoring Sunday's brief return to glory after losing to the Dallas Cowboys only 
a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The playoffs are still almost certainly out of their picture but, after their 
defense dominated Joe Montana and their offense dismantled the 49er defense in 
the fourth quarter, so is the sense that the Rams might pack it in for the rest 
of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the key feeling is that it was fun and that it meant a lot to each of 
us personally to do it," John Robinson said Monday at his weekly media 
luncheon. "Just to play good and to get some sense of self-worth about your 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we get a chance to play again in seven days (Sunday at Cleveland against 
the 2-8 Browns.) Let's see if we can do it again. I think we're all down to 
very short-range goals at this point. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's play next Sunday, see what happens, see if we can perform anywhere near 
the same level. Then let's play again, and let's play again, and see what 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said he was never really worried about talk that his job might be in 
jeopardy. He said he simply wanted his team to play harder, better and more 
successfully and took the necessary steps toward that end last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I started (the talk) here when somebody asked me a question about it 
last Monday," Robinson said. "I think it's just natural that when you lose in 
the NFL there are people who think they should eliminate anybody that loses. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it was a big issue because the fact that somebody was saying it 
doesn't change whether it is or isn't. I think I have some sense of the 
direction that we're going as an organization. I don't know everything about 
it, but I honestly felt that the most important thing was that we weren't doing 
our jobs well, we just weren't playing. 
</P>
<P>
"Me being secure or insecure I don't think is going to make me coach better." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who usually tries to highlight the positive to his team, held an 
unusual practice-field meeting last Wednesday to slam home his points. 
</P>
<P>
"Just on the themes of toughness and self-worth," Robinson said. "The physical 
aspect of the game. Attacking instead of standing around and watching somebody 
hit you in the mouth. And then it degenerated into obscenities. Just trying to 
turn on a light that says, 'Oh, . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
If there had been a failure to communicate among the Rams, Robinson made sure 
that was corrected. And his team responded by making the plays against the 
49ers it hadn't made all year -- forcing a season-high six turnovers, keeping 
Jerry Rice and fellow receiver John Taylor relatively quiet, and driving the 
ball for more than 10 minutes in the key possession of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the big defensive performance was the decision to use a 
six-defensive back, "big nickel" alignment much more than usual, daring the 
49ers to try to run and using four safeties to bump the San Francisco receivers 
all across the field. The 49ers still couldn't run -- they gained 66 yards in 
19 carries -- and Montana had no receivers streaking free. 
</P>
<P>
For one three-hour period, the Rams' defense played the way it did at the end 
of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense did a great job of that," Robinson said. "We constantly changed, 
constantly kept different kinds of people in the game playing different 
schemes. It turned out good for us. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether we could get away with that against them the next time we play them, 
who knows? At least we made them off(-rhythm). I think Joe, as great as he is, 
did the things that quarterbacks do when things don't go right: throw 
interceptions, fumble the football, miss some targets . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's the greatest player ever to play the game, yet it's what happens 
when things don't happen right. Everybody is vulnerable to those things." 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson, who said that the Rams probably will play a lot more of that kind 
of four-safety nickel defense on first and second downs in the near future, 
also said he doesn't think the strategy alone was what mystified Montana. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's don't get too caught up on the strategy," Robinson said. "The guys 
played good. Strategy maybe gives you an additional weapon, but they played 
good. Balls were tipped in the air, and Pat Terrell makes a great play on the 
ball (for an interception). And Mike Wilcher, a ball's knocked out of there, 
makes the catch (for a fumble recovery). We were just doing those kinds of 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Said linebacker Kevin Greene, who recovered two 49er fumbles: "I think in the 
back of our minds we were thinking, were the 49ers going to, like, set records 
on us? We hadn't been playing very well on defense, but we came up with the big 
plays this time."

SCHROEDER'S KNEE INJURY NOT THAT BAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bad news for Jay Schroeder haters, some of whom cheered the Raider quarterback 
when he was injured in the fourth quarter of Sunday's setback to the Kansas 
City Chiefs at the Coliseum: He's OK. 
</P>
<P>
Tests on Schroeder's left knee revealed nothing more than a ligament sprain 
and, knee willing, he will resume control of the team next week at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Schroeder's hold on the starting quarterback position is tenuous 
only in his home bleachers, where he might have placed fourth Sunday in a 
people's choice award, behind Vince Evans, Steve Beuerlein and George Blanda. 
</P>
<P>
Down on the sidelines, where real decisions are made, Schroeder's support is 
holding. Of course, that was as of Monday afternoon, so hold all bets. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Coach Art Shell said Schroeder will remain the starter, provided his 
knee responds this week, which leaves Shell at least some room to maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't appear as bad as we thought it might be," Shell said of Schroeder's 
knee sprain. "There wasn't any swelling today. It's supposed to be a minor 
sprain. . . . If he's healthy enough to work, he'll be out there with the first 
unit, yes." 
</P>
<P>
Shell said he will decide on Friday whether Schroeder is ready for this 
Sunday's game against the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's chances of starting will diminish if he can't work Wednesday and 
Thursday, the heaviest practices days of game week. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd like for the quarterback to work on the days that you have good work 
days set for," Shell said. "That's important." 
</P>
<P>
If Schroeder can't make it, the starter against Denver will be . . . Steve 
Beuerlein? 
</P>
<P>
Not a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein's biggest concern about Denver will be what color snow jacket to pick 
out for the sidelines. Anyone have a problem with orange? In discussing 
contingency plans, Shell didn't even mention Beuerlein's name Monday. 
</P>
<P>
If Schroeder can't go, the hopes and dreams of a Raider season rest on the 
shoulders of 35-year-old Vince Evans, pressed into duty Sunday when Schroeder 
was felled. It took Evans four plays to lead his team to a touchdown. Remember, 
he was rusty. Evans paced the sidelines hoping for a chance to win it, but his 
defense couldn't get the ball back. 
</P>
<P>
Evans threw just one pass, a 36-yard completion to Ethan Horton, and handed off 
three other times. For some Raider fans, that was enough to take the job from 
Schroeder, who dropped some remaining die-hards off his bandwagon with another 
shaky performance. 
</P>
<P>
This time, it wasn't so much his passing as his ballhandling. Schroeder fumbled 
twice in critical situations. The first drop led to a Kansas City touchdown, 
the second halted what could have been the go-ahead touchdown drive. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to put the ball away," Shell said. "He's trying to move around the 
pocket, and sometimes you become a little careless with the ball. It's just one 
of those things that happened. It's unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
Shell didn't mind that Schroeder scrambled for 16 and 17 yards on two other 
runs, but admits there is a risk factor when the quarterback tries to do too 
much. Schroeder has been best this season playing it safe in a conservative 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"If the opportunity is there, you've got to take off and run," Shell said. "You 
don't want your quarterback to run, but if it presents itself, you've got to 
get out of there." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders' recent slump has been team wide. Penalties are up, defensive 
turnovers are down. But it can also be directly linked to Schroeder's 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
When the Raiders were 6-1, Schroeder was leading the AFC in passing with a 
rating of 98.6. He had thrown eight touchdown passes and three interceptions. 
The Raiders have lost three of four games since, and Schroeder's rating has 
plummeted into the 70s. He hasn't thrown a touchdown pass since the fourth 
quarter of a victory over San Diego Oct. 21. He has thrown five interceptions 
in that span. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, who once seemed a cinch to clinch the AFC West title, have set 
their sights lower. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is to qualify for the playoffs," Shell said. "I feel if we can 
take care of our business, we'll be there at the end. And we'll have a chance 
to win our division. You want to win your division, but first and foremost you 
want to qualify for the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders remain very much in that hunt, as they monitor the swelling of a 
slumping quarterback's knee and prepare a veteran who in recent years has been 
more accustomed to moth balls than footballs.

ALASKA TITLE IS PURE JOY FOR BRUINS; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA: HARRICK SAVORS THE CHANCE TO PLAY A MORE TRADITIONAL OPPONENT IN 89-74 
VICTORY OVER VIRGINIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Harrick's purist heart was aching two games into this UCLA basketball 
season. 
</P>
<P>
By the time his 12th-ranked Bruins walked onto the court to play 16th-ranked 
Virginia in the final of the Great Alaska Shootout Monday, Harrick was 
fidgeting in delighted anticipation: Real basketball, at last. 
</P>
<P>
Enough of those irksome, three-point-mad teams such as UC Irvine and Alaska 
Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
In Virginia, UCLA met a team that abides by the conventions of the game -- at 
least as the elite teams view them -- and the Bruins came away with an 89-74 
victory before 6,287 in a game they broke open far earlier than they had either 
of their first two. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt back to normal, really," said Don MacLean, chosen the tournament's 
outstanding player and whose 20 points were second to Darrick Martin's 21 for 
the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt more like we practice. We don't practice to play against teams that 
want to score 134 points." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Bruins' first two games, this one featured restraint, and most 
important, excellent defense by UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"Real basketball is where you walk it up and play defense," Harrick said. "Real 
basketball is where you average 80 points." 
</P>
<P>
The other? 
</P>
<P>
"That's not basketball," Harrick said the other day. "That's summertime. You 
score 100 points and get beat by 34? Where has the purity and the finesse and 
the beauty of college basketball gone? 
</P>
<P>
UCLA had an easier time against Virginia than it did against either UC Irvine 
or Alaska Anchorage, going ahead, 40-29, shortly before halftime when Keith 
Owens tipped in MacLean's missed shot from the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' halftime lead was built on balance. MacLean had 10 points, but many 
of the more critical blows came from elsewhere: Martin and Gerald Madkins 
pulling up for three-pointers while the Cavaliers worried about MacLean, Martin 
on a layup off a length-of-the-court drive, Owens with six points off the bench 
in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
There was also the matter of defense. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's task was to slow Bryant Stith, a 6-5 swingman who averaged 29.5 points 
in the first two games and who has scored in double figures in 33 of his last 
34 games. 
</P>
<P>
The assignment fell to sophomore Mitchell Butler, also 6-5, and was shared by 
Shon Tarver and Madkins. Before the game, UCLA wondered whether its best 
defense right now is not man-to-man, but zone. 
</P>
<P>
They played both against Virginia, but it was the man-to-man that slowed Stith, 
who fouled out with three minutes left with 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a heads-up job, just wanting to deny the ball and if he gets it, not 
let him get it back if you can," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Stith, who had 13 at halftime, went scoreless in the second half until only 
five minutes remained. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we really played well," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Kenny Turner stepped up for Virginia, scoring 25 with four 
three-pointers, but he couldn't fill the void left by Stith and guard John 
Crotty, who made one of 11 shots. 
</P>
<P>
If the game felt something like an NCAA tournament game to Harrick, there was a 
reason: So many of his NCAA tournaments have ended this way, in a game against 
an Atlantic Coast Conference team. 
</P>
<P>
Last season Duke beat UCLA, stopping the Bruins in the Sweet 16. The year 
before, it was North Carolina, in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
When Harrick was at Pepperdine, it was the same story. The Waves lost to 
Maryland in the first round in 1986, to Duke in the first in 1985. In 1983, 
Pepperdine lost in double overtime in the second round to the N.C. State team 
that was beginning its improbable run to the NCAA title. 
</P>
<P>
You have to go back to 1982 to find the only time Harrick hasn't been bumped 
from the NCAA tournament by an ACC team. Pepperdine lost to Oregon State that 
year in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
This wasn't the NCAA tournament -- far from it. But UCLA beat its first ACC 
opponent of the year, and that's something that makes a traditionalist like 
Harrick breathe a little easier, knowing the Bruins beat a basketball team, a 
real one.

DODGERS LET DAYLEY SLIP AWAY; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: LEFT-HANDED RELIEF PITCHER, AFTER VISITING LOS ANGELES, SIGNS A 
3-YEAR, $6.3-MILLION CONTRACT WITH THE TORONTO BLUE JAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers' search for a left-handed relief pitcher became more desperate 
Monday after Ken Dayley, two days after a visit here, signed a three-year, 
$6.3-million deal with the Toronto Blue Jays. The contract includes an option 
year for a fourth season, with a guaranteed $350,000 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Dodgers, unwilling to give anyone more than a three-year contract 
after signing Darryl Strawberry to a five-year deal, offered Dayley a 
three-year deal worth nearly $6 million. They would not agree to an option 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Dayley's decision was reportedly based on the contract difference, and the 
differences between the cities. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it's like to play in Toronto, but I know L.A. is a media 
center, and there is a lot of pressure there," Dayley said. 
</P>
<P>
Dayley, 31, was 4-4 with a 3.56 earned-run average and two saves in 58 games 
for St. Louis last season. Despite arm troubles, he is known as a dependable 
setup reliever who helped lead the Cardinals to the World Series in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The turndown by Dayley puts the Dodgers in a position that could worsen today 
when Dave Righetti, the other top free-agent left-handed reliever, is scheduled 
to meet with officials from the New York Yankees. Righetti has spent his entire 
10-year career with the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers have discussed a contract with Righetti's agent, Bill Goodstein, 
but their refusal to offer more than three years may hurt them again. 
</P>
<P>
"The length of a contract prior to Darryl's, and after Darryl's, is always 
going to be a factor with us," said Fred Claire, Dodger vice president. 
"Especially with a pitcher, where length of contract becomes a major 
consideration." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers attempted to woo Dayley last Friday and Saturday, when he and his 
wife, Jill, visited Los Angeles and were shown homes and schools. Afterward, he 
flew to Toronto, where he spent the rest of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess he liked the feel of Toronto better," Claire said. "We made him a 
substantial offer, now we have to move on." 
</P>
<P>
In other free-agent news, it appears that outfielder Kirk Gibson is on the 
verge of signing with another team, a leading candidate being Kansas City. 
Gibson's departure from the Dodgers has been a foregone conclusion since 
midseason.

CORONA DEL MAR AND LA HABRA PLAYING FOR TITLES; 
</P>
<P>
PREP VOLLEYBALL: SEA KINGS TAKE ON SAN JOSE LYNBROOK IN DIVISION I TONIGHT. 
HIGHLANDERS PLAY LAKEWOOD ST. JOSEPH IN DIVISION II.

<P>
In a rematch of last year's regional final, Corona del Mar High School will 
play San Jose Lynbrook in the Southern California Regional Division I 
championship match at 7:30 tonight at Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
In the Division II regional final, La Habra will play host to Lakewood St. 
Joseph at 7:30 tonight. The regional winners advance to the state championship 
games Saturday at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar (26-1) lost to Lynbrook (30-5) in five games in last year's 
regional final. 
</P>
<P>
Sea King Coach Dale Flickinger said his players have one thing on their minds 
-- revenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad we're playing Lynbrook," he said. "Losing to them last year will 
definitely serve as a motivator." 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar already has avenged one tournament loss this year. The Sea Kings 
swept Mira Costa in the Southern Section 5-A finals two weeks ago. Mira Costa 
beat Corona del Mar in the 1989 Southern Section final. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar has been led by Lara Carlsen, a 5-foot-11 middle blocker, and 
Tracy Schriber, a 5-5 outside hitter. But the Sea Kings used a balanced attack, 
led by middle blocker Tahlia Wagner's 16 kills, in a five-game victory over 
Poway in the second round Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Lynbrook features middle blocker Michelle Wagner, a 5-11 junior who's also one 
of the top basketball players in the northern section. Wagner had 21 kills and 
18 digs in Lynbrook's second-round victory over Vacaville. 
</P>
<P>
Other top players for Lynbrook include setter Dawn Hill and outside hitters 
Julie Dare and Summer Love. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra enters the Division II final with a 43-match winning streak. But the 
Highlanders could have their hands full with St. Joseph, which rallied from a 
two-game deficit to beat San Diego University in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra is led by Missy Clements, a 5-11 middle blocker, and Zrinka Kristich, 
a 6-5 outside hitter. St. Joseph's top players are Erin Balderama and Jaime 
Torromeo. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar has played La Habra and St. Joseph this year. The Sea Kings lost 
to La Habra in the finals of the Orange County Championships and beat St. 
Joseph in the Southern Section 5-A semifinals two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be surprised if St. Joseph beats La Habra," Flickinger said. 
</P>

PROMISING STARS ARE POISED TO TAKE CENTER STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERGirls' prep basketball: Loara's Titus, 
Brea-Olinda's Williams among those in a talented crop of players. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the dawning of another Southern Section girls' basketball season, it's 
time to take inventory of the talent pool to see who will shoot, rebound or 
steal -- the ball, that is -- their way into the headlines this year. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who did so last season are gone, ready to showcase their wares 
for college crowds. La Quinta's scoring machine Amy Jalewalia, for instance, is 
at UCLA. Brea-Olinda's all-everything guard Aimee McDaniel has moved on to 
Pepperdine, and Marina's three-point specialist Melisa Sortino is at the 
University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's time for last year's outstanding underclassmen, who labored in the 
shadows of Jalewalia &amp; Co., to take center stage. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the top players in that talented crop: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FRONT ROW, CENTER 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Titus (6-2, senior, Loara) -- An all-section Division II second-team 
selection and Times' all-county honorable mention in 1989-90, Titus is being 
recruited by several major universities. She averaged 16.6 points and 10.9 
rebounds last season and helped the Saxons to the semifinals of the Division 
4-AA championships. 
</P>
<P>
Jinelle Williams (5-9, senior, Brea-Olinda) -- Did not receive as much 
recognition as her more-publicized teammates (McDaniel, guard Tammy Blackburn 
and forward Jody Anton), but Williams played an integral part in getting the 
Lady Cats to the Division 3-AA state final. She averaged 15.5 points and was 
first-team all-section Division III. 
</P>
<P>
Zrinka Kristich (6-5, junior, La Habra) -- One of the premier girl volleyball 
players in the county, Kristich is an equally imposing figure on the basketball 
court. She averaged 13 points and was a first-team all-Freeway League selection 
last season. Sister Ana is a senior forward on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Heather Flaherty (6-0, senior, Corona del Mar) -- An all-Sea View League 
selection last season, Flaherty averaged 14 points and 15.3 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Deanna Harry (6-2, senior, Woodbridge) -- She averaged 12.5 points and was 
fourth among county rebounders with a 14-rebounds-per-game average. Harry was 
an all-section Division II second-team selection and the Pacific Coast League's 
MVP. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE FRONT LINERS 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Ferguson (6-0, senior, La Habra) -- Ferguson was the leader of the team 
that was the class of the Freeway League and reached the Division 4-A 
quarterfinals last season. She was named the league's MVP after averaging 15.8 
points and 10.9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Ana Kristich (6-1, senior, La Habra) -- One of the primary reasons La Habra won 
the Freeway League title last year. She is one of the county's top rebounders 
with an average of 10.4 per game. Kristich made the all-Freeway League first 
team. Her sister, Zrinka, is the Highlanders' center. 
</P>
<P>
Jody Anton (5-11, junior, Brea-Olinda) -- Named to the 1990-91 Street &amp; 
Smith magazine All-American high school team, Anton was an all-section Division 
III selection in 1989-90. Although she only averaged 11.1 points, Rancho 
Alamitos Coach Bob Becker said she's the best player in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Pea (5-10, senior, Magnolia) -- Among the county scoring leaders with a 
14.1 average, she is a good player on a weak team. 
</P>
<P>
Belinda Taub (5-11, junior, Woodbridge) -- She averaged 10 points and seven 
rebounds last season. 
</P>
<P>
Heather Brannan (5-11, senior, La Quinta) -- Brannan combined with Jalewalia to 
spark La Quinta's offense last season, when she averaged 15 points and 11.8 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Jana Davis (5-8, senior, Huntington Beach) -- An all-Sunset League selection 
last season, she collected 200 rebounds for the Oilers in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKCOURT GEMS 
</P>
<P>
Olivia DiCamilli (5-10, sophomore, Costa Mesa) -- Perhaps the best guard in the 
county, if not the section, DiCamilli averaged 14.8 points and 11 rebounds in 
leading the Mustangs to the Division 3-A title last season. She was selected to 
the all-section Division III and all-Pacific League first teams. 
</P>
<P>
Rachel Ward (5-11, senior, Costa Mesa) -- Teamed with DiCamilli, Ward gives 
Costa Mesa a potent backcourt. She averaged 10.8 points and made the 
all-section Division III second team and the all-Pacific Coast League first 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Ruiz (5-1, senior, Kennedy) -- A four-year varsity player and two-time 
all-Garden Grove League selection, Ruiz averaged 19.3 points last season. 
"(She's) one of the best point guards in the county," Kennedy Coach Pat O'Hern 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK 
</P>
<P>
Nicole Erickson (5-6, freshman guard, Brea-Olinda) -- Lady Cats Coach Mark 
Trakh calls her the best freshman in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Murdent (6-0, sophomore center, Fountain Valley) -- Baron Coach Carol 
Strausburg tabs her as a potential all-county player, as does Marina Coach Pete 
Bonny. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OTHERS TO WATCH 
</P>
<P>
 -- Martha Hernandez (5-7, sophomore guard, La Habra). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lynly Matsumoto (5-6 sophomore guard-forward, Kennedy). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Carrie Elsaesser (6-3, senior center, Los Amigos).

SURPRISE! LA HABRA OUSTS BREA-OLINDA AS O.C.'S TOP-RATED TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERGirls' prep basketball: Height and 
rebounding give the Highlanders, defending Freeway League champions, the edge. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Surprise, surprise. 
</P>
<P>
In a departure from the status quo, Brea-Olinda High School is not the 
top-rated team this year in The Times' preview of Orange County girls' 
basketball. Instead, the distinction belongs to La Habra, the defending Freeway 
League champion. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say Brea, which won the state Division III title two seasons ago 
and made it to the finals again last year, has fallen on hard times. The Lady 
Cats are expected to be a strong force again this season and are favored to win 
another Southern Section Division 3-AA championship. 
</P>
<P>
But the reality is that La Habra, which made it to the Division 4-A 
quarterfinals last season, has the material to reach higher ground this year. 
The Highlanders feature a front line that averages 6-feet-2. 
</P>
<P>
Third on the list is another team familiar with top-10 rankings, Woodbridge, 
but after the Warriors it's a mix of newcomers and old standards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1. LA HABRA 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders, winners of the Freeway League last season with a 10-0 record, 
are led by 6-foot-5 junior center Zrinka Kristich, six-foot senior forward 
Leslie Ferguson and 6-1 senior forward Ana Kristich, Zrinka's sister. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson averaged 15.8 points and 10.9 rebounds and was the league's MVP last 
season. Ana Kristich crashed the boards at a 10.4-rebounds-per-game pace, and 
Zrinka Kristich contributed 13 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, they are the reasons 12-year Coach John Koehler is looking 
ahead further than the division's quarterfinal round this time around. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main strength is height and rebounding," Koehler said. "Our greatest 
strength is our half-court offense. We think we can win the CIF title this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Koehler, who has guided the Highlanders to 10 league titles and whose teams 
have a 97-3 league record coming into the season, said the Highlanders have 
good ballhandlers who can handle the press. 
</P>
<P>
Those responsibilities will fall mainly on 5-7 sophomore guard Martha 
Hernandez, an all-Freeway League first-team selection in 1989-90, and 5-1 
senior Lisa Almanza. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2. BREA-OLINDA 
</P>
<P>
Usually the county's top-ranked team, the Lady Cats advanced to the Division 
III state finals last season with a 33-0 mark, but lost the championship game 
to Placer, 54-43. 
</P>
<P>
Under Coach Mark Trakh, the Lady Cats are 258-38 in 11 seasons and have run 
away with eight Orange League championships. 
</P>
<P>
This year they'll have to do it without their killer backcourt of Aimee 
McDaniel, the Division III state player of the year, and Tammy Blackburn, an 
all-state guard. Both have graduated and are playing at Pepperdine and San 
Diego State, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
To pick up the slack, Brea will rely on 5-9 senior center Jinelle Williams, the 
team's second-leading scorer last year, and 5-11 junior forward Jody Anton, an 
all-section Division III pick last year. 
</P>
<P>
With the changing of the guards, one of the vacancies left by McDaniel and 
Blackburn will be filled by 5-6 freshman sensation Nicole Erickson and the 
other by either 5-6 senior Cathy Lewis or 5-10 sophomore Angie Hanes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3. WOODBRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
It's no secret Woodbridge will be tough again. And five different teams will 
get a taste of what the Warriors have been dishing out for years when the team 
moves to the Sea View League this season. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge, the Pacific Coast League champions in 1989-90, feature returning 
6-2 center Deanna Harry and 5-11 forward Belinda Taub as the nucleus of a 
well-balanced squad. 
</P>
<P>
Harry, a senior, was an all-section selection last season when she averaged 
13.8 points and 14.3 rebounds. Taub, a junior, contributed 10 points and seven 
rebounds per game. They led the Warriors to the second round of the Division 
4-AA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard duties will be handled by Florencia Luppani, an Argentine-born 
sophomore who first-year Coach Russ Davis ranks very high. 
</P>
<P>
"(Our) inside play and our defense will be our keys," Davis said. "I think we 
have real good outside shooters." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4. TUSTIN 
</P>
<P>
Senior Wanda Sequeira and junior Christine Garner return for Coach Rick Falk's 
defending Sea View League champions. 
</P>
<P>
Sequeira, a 5-5 guard, broke the school single-season record for assists last 
year with 164. She's a two-time all-league selection. Garner, a six-foot 
center, scored 16 points and picked up 11 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
They will team with 5-11 junior forward Shari Needham (13 points, eight 
rebounds) and 5-6 senior guard Nancy Vinh, a defensive specialist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5. MARINA 
</P>
<P>
Coach Pete Bonny has nine of 12 players back from the squad that went 19-8 and 
reached the second round of the Division 5-A playoffs. But, as he said, the bad 
news is that the three not returning generated 60% of Marina's points last 
season. Still, the Lady Vikings have four returning seniors that will make them 
highly competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the foursome is 5-9 forward Gillian Bean (seven points and five 
rebounds per game) and 5-10 center Colleen Hatch (six points and seven 
rebounds). Both made the all-Sunset League second team last year. 
</P>
<P>
Also back are 5-3 guard Leslie Ono and 5-6 guard Dawn Cox. 
</P>
<P>
Two sophomores up from the junior varsity, 5-6 forward Aimee Periolat and 5-11 
center Jessica Trippet, will be called on for help. 
</P>
<P>
"Our strengths are team speed and quickness, and a balanced attack," Bonny 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6. ESTANCIA 
</P>
<P>
Though they made it to the Division 3-AA semifinals, the Eagles finished a 
disappointing third in the Sea View League and barely had a winning overall 
record (14-13). But Coach Lisa McNamee blamed the team's woes on the loss of 
guard Melody Earle to injury for part of the league season. 
</P>
<P>
McNamee said Estancia should be good if it can avoid similar physical setbacks. 
"If we can stay away from injuries, we'll be right up there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
With Earle and Patrice Lumpkins providing the punch, the Eagles figure to 
contend for the league title. Earle, a 5-8 senior guard, led the team in 
scoring with a 16.4 average, and Lumpkins, a 5-9 senior forward, averaged 12.4 
points and 10.3 rebounds. Earle was a Division III first-team selection and 
Lumpkins made the second team. 
</P>
<P>
The supporting cast includes 5-11 senior center Robin Cordrey and 5-10 junior 
forward Monique Sweet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7. FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
The Barons, who pretty much controlled Sunset League action throughout the '80s 
by winning six titles, fell to third place last season. But that squad, 
dominated by underclassmen, should give Coach Carol Strausburg a solid 
foundation with which to return to the limelight in her 15th season. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can get our outside game going, we could win league," Strausburg said. 
</P>
<P>
At the forefront of the resurgence are Julie Murdent, a 6-1 sophomore center; 
Heather Stanke, a 5-9 senior forward, and Shanna Wilson, a 5-10 senior forward. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
8. COSTA MESA 
</P>
<P>
Two players -- guards Olivia DiCamilli and Rachel Ward -- are the heart and 
soul of a Mustang team that last season became the first Costa Mesa boys' or 
girls' basketball team to advance to the section finals in the school's 30-year 
history. The Mustangs not only got there, but they beat Rancho Alamitos, 51-49, 
for the title. 
</P>
<P>
DiCamilli and Ward return to make life easy again for Coach Jim Weeks. 
</P>
<P>
DiCamilli, a 5-10 sophomore who was chosen to the all-section first team, 
averaged 14.8 points and 11 rebounds. She ranks as one of the top guards in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Ward, a 5-11 senior, made the all-section second team. She averaged 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
Among the team's top newcomers is 6-2 sophomore center April Van Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
9. RANCHO ALAMITOS 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros took a back seat to La Quinta last year in the Garden Grove 
League, but then again, who didn't? La Quinta is the nine-time defending league 
champion, but Rancho Alamitos looks not only like the team to beat in league 
this season, but one of the leaders in Division 3-A. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos Coach Bob Becker will miss the 24.3 points per game he got last 
year from guard Jenny Newsome (UC Riverside), but he's got 5-3 senior guard 
Shellie Tsuji to pick up the slack. Tsuji made 41 three-point baskets last 
season -- including five in one game -- to rank among the section's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Up front, 5-9 junior center Anita Stecker (10 rebounds per game) will be 
flanked by the Rodriguez twins -- Marlene and Arlene -- who Becker said are the 
team's best defensive players. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10. ESPERANZA 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps a dark horse in this derby, but one deserving of recognition. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs won the Empire League title with a 9-1 record and finished the 
season at 21-5 after losing in the second round of the Division 5-A playoffs. 
And though Coach Marc Hill must find a way to replace the 16.3 scoring average 
of Jennifer Harney, who graduated, he has what he calls a 
"strong-down-the-middle" lineup. 
</P>
<P>
At the center is 5-11 senior Wendy Fullmer, who has a 24-inch vertical leap -- 
"She's strong and quick," Hill said -- and who averaged 6.8 rebounds last year. 
</P>
<P>
Another senior that helps form the core of Esperanza's roster is 5-7 point 
guard Michele Fujioka, who had 4.2 assists per game. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch: Ocean View, Edison, Orange, Santa Margarita, Loara and 
University.

COX CAN'T SHAKE HAMSTRING PROBLEM 
</P>

Coach John Robinson said that the team is very concerned about receiver Aaron 
Cox's recurring hamstring problems and is trying to figure out why the problem 
persists. Cox, in the starting lineup Sunday for injured Henry Ellard, strained 
the same right hamstring that has bothered him his whole pro career and missed 
most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We're convinced now that there's some kind of chemical imbalance in his system 
that is causing it," Robinson said. "He's almost been inactive on this team 
since he's come here. Even when he's here, three weeks prior he's missed. So 
he's never been able to establish himself. We've done a lot of testing since 
this training camp. . . . I do know it's just not normal." 
</P>
<P>
Ellard is also having recurring hamstring problems, and Robinson hinted that 
the team could add another wide receiver to fill the roster spot that will be 
created by moving linebacker Greg Clark to the injured-reserve list. Clark 
broke his right leg Sunday and is out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson praised the performances of linebacker Mike Wilcher, who was a key 
member of the Rams' six-defensive back defense Sunday and had 11 tackles, and 
fullback Buford McGee, who threw for a touchdown and ran for another. . . . 
Although it was in a winning cause, Ram quarterback Jim Everett went without a 
touchdown pass Sunday for the third consecutive game and has thrown only one in 
his last five games. TIM KAWAKAMI

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL'S FORTUNES REST WITH HOWLETT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't the most memorable season for Cal State Fullerton volleyball Coach 
Jim Huffman. The Titans went 8-30, finished last in the Big West Conference and 
were the subject of an athletic department inquiry that uncovered minor NCAA 
rule violations. 
</P>
<P>
But in a few years, Huffman hopes he can look back at 1990 as the year 
Fullerton began its move from conference also-ran to contender; the year Becky 
Howlett sparked a rise to respectability. 
</P>
<P>
Howlett, a 6-foot-4 freshman from Aurora, Colo., was a dominating player in the 
nation's most dominant conference. She finished with 633 kills, breaking the 
previous school single-season record of 517, set by Susan Herman in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
She also set a school record for kills in a match with 36 against UC Irvine, 
breaking the previous mark of 33, set by Herman in 1987 and Laurie Jakemer in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
Howlett's kills-per-game average of 4.72 is the 12th-highest in the nation, and 
her 103 block-assists were the second-highest in school history behind 
Stephanie Scofield's 108 this season. 
</P>
<P>
For her efforts, Howlett was named Big West Conference freshman of the year 
Monday, an award Huffman hopes will be noticed by standout high school players. 
</P>
<P>
"She's my franchise kid, my Magic, and we want to build on that," Huffman said. 
"When we bring in a recruit, I tell her, 'Look at who you'll be playing with.' 
</P>
<P>
"She's shown that a freshman can have a big impact. If we get another player 
like that, maybe we can be like the San Antonio Spurs and turn things around." 
</P>
<P>
Six baseball players, two from community colleges and four from high schools, 
have signed letters of intent with Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans signed pitchers Eddie Guardado, a left-hander from San Joaquin Delta 
College in Stockton; Jeff Scarpitti, a right-hander from Diablo Valley College 
in Pleasant Hill, Calif., and Chris Gambs, a right-hander from Monte Vista High 
School in Richmond, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Guardado was an all-Alaskan League pitcher last summer, Scarpitti was the most 
valuable player in the Golden Gate Conference, and Gambs was the Northern 
California high school pitcher of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The other signees are Dante Powell, a shortstop/infielder from Millikan High 
School; Mike Sweeney, a catcher from Ontario High School, and Bryan Dunagan, a 
third baseman/pitcher from La Serna High School. Powell is a two-time, 
all-Southern Section 5-A selection, and Dunagan was the 3-A Player of the Year 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We're real excited about them," Titan assistant coach George Horton said. "You 
never know if you'll get them all because of the (professional) draft, but 
they're all highly recruited players." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton recently completed its fall baseball season with a 7-2-1 record 
against nine community college teams and the San Bernardino Pride, a senior 
league team. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Matt Hattabaugh led the Titans with a .556 average, seven doubles and 
12 runs batted in. First baseman Frank Charles hit .385, outfielder David Ayala 
hit .368, and outfielder Frank Herman hit .353 with three doubles and six RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
James Popoff (0.90 earned-run average in 10 innings), Bill Fitzgerald (1.69 ERA 
in 16 innings) and Chris Robinson (1.80 ERA in 10 innings) were the most 
consistent pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
But on the whole, Fullerton wasn't that impressive, Horton said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hattabaugh was our best everyday player and Herman had a good fall, but the 
rest were spotty," Horton said. "They didn't hit or play defense at times as 
well as we think they can." 
</P>
<P>
Horton and Augie Garrido, Fullerton's head coach, weren't that impressed by the 
numbers the players put up this fall, and the Titans' letters haven't been too 
good, either. A recent mid-semester grade check revealed that 17 players were 
making unsatisfactory academic progress. 
</P>
<P>
"There were several Ds and Fs and we're concerned with the direction that's 
going," Horton said. "That might become a problem, but hopefully they'll rally 
with the time off (from practice) and the fire we've put under them." 
</P>
<P>
Student-athletes can be disqualified at the beginning of each semester if they 
don't maintain a 2.0 grade-point average in 12 units and make satisfactory 
progress toward their degree. The Titans open the 1991 season Jan. 29, a day 
after the spring semester begins. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be easy stopping the Fullerton women's basketball team's fast break 
this season, but a two-foot-high toddler found a sure way to shut down the 
Titans Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Three minutes into the game against Oregon State, with Fullerton attempting to 
run on the Beavers, a young boy made a mad dash from the first row of the 
bleachers to Fullerton's foul line. 
</P>
<P>
Whistles blew and players stopped, putting the Titans' transition temporarily 
out of commission. Fortunately, a referee was able to grab the toddler just 
before he would have been trampled by several players. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what was going on," Titan Coach Maryalyce Jeremiah said. "I've 
never seen anything like that happen in a game. That kid almost got stepped on. 
That would have been terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Two Fullerton wrestlers and one former Titan wrestler each finished second in 
their respective weight classes in Saturday's Northern Open, an invitational 
meet at the University of Wisconsin, that included some 400 college and 
open-division wrestlers. Fullerton senior heavyweight David Jones, ranked third 
nationally, lost to sixth-ranked Jon Oostendorp of Iowa, 6-4, in overtime of 
the championship match. Titan junior Lyndon Campbell, ranked 14th at 134 
pounds, lost to top-ranked Tom Brandes of Iowa, 24-8, in the finals. Fullerton 
assistant coach Ardeshir Asgari, a former Titan wrestling in the 167-pound 
division, advanced to the championship match, where he lost to Iowa's Mark 
Reiland, 16-0. Reiland is ranked third in the nation. The Titans will compete 
at this weekend's Las Vegas Invitational.

CALIFORNIA &amp; CO.: WHY FARM OUTPUT IS UP DURING DROUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. LA GANGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's wrong with this picture? 
</P>
<P>
Concerned water officials warned last week that even a stormy season of heavy 
rain and snowfall could not counteract the past four years of withering 
drought. A few weeks earlier, they estimated that farmers and ranchers could 
lose $483 million this year and an additional $193 million next year, even if 
the dry spell ends. 
</P>
<P>
Roll back the calendar to the end of October, and you find the state Department 
of Food and Agriculture mailing out its 1989 statistical review, which showed 
California farm receipts reaching a whopping $17.5 billion. That's up over 
1988's $16.6 billion total, which was a jump over 1987's $15.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Four years of drought equals three years of agricultural growth? The arithmetic 
simply doesn't work. Sure, you could always argue supply and demand: That less 
water means fewer crops, means less supply, means more demand, means higher 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
But that's only one part of the solution, the easy part. To get the full 
answer, you have to look at the whole of California agriculture -- its products 
and its practices. 
</P>
<P>
The products alone are daunting: 250 different types of food and fiber ranging 
from alfalfa to zucchini, diversity that has helped California growers save 
their sunburned necks. Does cotton take too much water for the money you get 
out of it? Switch to broccoli, and you'll at least stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
But before you think that this is a paean to produce, there's one more item 
that needs consideration. Agricultural water use. 
</P>
<P>
The years of drought have reminded farmers how to conserve. They're switching 
to higher-value crops and drip-irrigation systems. They're digging new wells 
and buying water from damper areas. 
</P>
<P>
And that raises a nasty question: If California farmers can do so well with so 
much less water during a drought, why can't they manage to do the same in 
easier times? 
</P>
<P>
Some say the answer is that they can't. 
</P>
<P>
"Farmers are conserving through no choice of their own," says Mike Henry, 
spokesman for the California Farm Bureau Federation. "Some guy gets 75% of his 
water. Another gets 50%, another 25%. This is forced conservation, and you have 
to make do with less. You may end up planting a crop and not getting a full 
yield." 
</P>
<P>
But that, argues agricultural economist Ray Borton, is not always bad. Consider 
rice and processing tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Rice production estimates for 1990 are down 10% from 1989, says Borton, senior 
agricultural economist for the state food and agriculture department. Instead 
of the expected 32.6 million hundredweights, the state's crop is estimated at 
29.3 million hundredweights. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of that is due to not having water enough," Borton says. "But rice is 
something we're having a hard time selling anyway." 
</P>
<P>
The processing tomato crop was originally estimated at 10 million tons. But 
with the harvest winding down, Borton said, it looks as if the crop will 
shrivel to 9.3 million tons. Is that bad? Nope. The processing tomato crop was 
only 8.5 million tons in 1989, a scant 6.5 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We had plenty of tomatoes (this year) anyhow," Borton said. "It wasn't a 
problem. It may have prevented a problem. . . . We didn't quite know what we 
were going to do with 10 million tons. Supply and demand are closer in balance 
than they would have been if we had a bumper, bumper, bumper crop." 
</P>
<P>
On the down side, though, is that long stretches with little water could 
threaten crops such as oranges and nectarines. Trees and vines can handle some 
deprivation, but too much stress will start to kill them. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know yet what the four dry years has done to the trees," said Chris 
Kapheim, general manager of the Alta Irrigation District in Dinuba. "Most of 
the farmers in our district, through transfers or exchanges or pumping ground 
water, did get by. Maybe they didn't put on as much water as they would have 
liked. What that does to the tree in the long term I really don't know." 
</P>
<P>
While Borton's numbers show growth, they also raise a red flag. Adjust those 
numbers for inflation, and you still see increasing farm receipts, but the 
increases are smaller. 
</P>
<P>
Others see even greater warnings in statistics that show agricultural growth at 
a time of water cutbacks. Their fears, they say, are for the state's 
diminishing ground water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Under normal circumstances, 60% of the water used in agriculture is "surface 
water" provided through water projects, while 40% is ground water. Today, said 
Douglas Priest, manager of the state drought center, 60% is pumped from the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
"In a lot of places, people are switching form surface to ground water," he 
said. "It's not always a good thing, but it's nice to have." 
</P>
<P>
The result, he said, is that 1990 will be "another record year" for farm 
receipts. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Reisner, author of "Cadillac Desert: The American West and Its 
Disappearing Water," said, "One of the reasons farmers are doing OK is because 
they're pumping up a hell of a lot of non-renewable ground water, especially in 
the San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"They're getting a tremendous amount of irrigation water from the ground that 
nature is not putting back in," he said. "They're robbing their children and 
grandchildren of a natural inheritance."

<P>
The acquisitions by Sony Corp. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of two of 
Hollywood's crown jewels, Columbia Pictures and MCA, are likely to strengthen 
Japan's hand in directing debates over key issues in entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
While Sony and Matsushita are fierce competitors, they have a history of 
working closely together when they have interests in common. Sony Chairman Akio 
Morita and Matsushita founder Konosuke Matsushita, for example, jointly 
authored a book in 1976 about the need for reform in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies were key participants in a television export cartel organized 
by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in the 1960s. The cartel 
enabled Japan to price its televisions high in Japan while undercutting U.S. 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
And both companies worked together on a largely successful fight against the 
unitary tax, which assured American states stable revenues from foreign 
manufacturers but which Japanese companies considered unfair. 
</P>
<P>
When Sony President Norio Ohga had dinner recently with Matsushita's president, 
the two companies gave little importance to the meeting. "It is not unusual for 
the two to meet," says Akira Nagano, a spokesman for Matsushita. 
</P>
<P>
Further cooperation in the future should be expected. Take the introduction of 
digital audio tape: U.S. recording artists and songwriters have opposed the 
introduction of DAT recorders because they say the machines' ability to make 
identical copies poses a potential threat to their copyrights. 
</P>
<P>
While U.S. record companies have fought the trend by refusing to issue DAT 
tapes, Sony is already using part of its CBS Records library to put out such 
tapes in Japan to support sales of its recorders. A similar move by Matsushita 
would put weight behind the Sony move. 
</P>
<P>
While both companies want to dominate the market for extra-clear, 
high-definition televisions, they are both in favor of speeding up the 
introduction of HDTV standards in the United States. Japan regards HDTV as 
critical to maintaining growth in the consumer electronics sector. The United 
States has delayed the introduction of standards partly in an effort to give 
U.S. companies an important role in the new market. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer electronics giants could also influence trends in the 
entertainment industry. Sony has already set up a lot at Columbia to 
demonstrate its high-definition broadcast equipment and hopes eventually to 
persuade producers to make use of the technology. Matsushita, while a 
competitor to Sony in the broadcast equipment business, has a common interest 
in seeing video technology take over from film. 
</P>
<P>
But the greatest fear of those familiar with Japan is that the two companies, 
both acutely conscious of the importance of maintaining a good image of Japan, 
will use their power to suppress unfavorable footage. Matsushita officials have 
denied that they intend to influence the content of MCA films and television 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
However, if a Matsushita-owned studio were shooting "The Last Emperor" and 
wanted to show footage of the Rape of Nanking, says John Stern, senior 
representative of the Japan office of the American Electronics Assn., the scene 
might be toned down to assuage domestic criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese distributors of that film did try to edit out the section when they 
first introduced the film to their Japanese audiences. Only strenuous 
objections from the director prevented them from doing so. "It's naive to 
assume there won't be some form of self-censorship," says Stern. "There is a 
Japanese saying, 'If it smells, cover it up.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10 LARGEST JAPANESE ACQUISITIONS 
</P>
<P>
The proposed $6.13-billion purchase of MCA by Matsushita is the biggest 
takeover ever of a U.S. company by a Japanese group. The following are the 10 
previous largest Japanese acquisitions and investments in U.S. companies since 
1987:

Chevron to Stop Selling Solvents: Citing the growing cost of environmental 
regulations, the San Francisco firm said it would stop making thinners and 
solvents by Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron is the largest West Coast manufacturer of thinners, used in paints, dry 
cleaning, charcoal lighter fluid, concrete curing, food processing and 
industrial cleaners. The company makes thinners and solvents at its El Segundo 
and Salt Lake City refineries. Discontinuing the products, which are byproducts 
of gasoline and jet fuel manufacturing, will reduce operating costs at the 
refineries but not result in the loss of any jobs, Chevron said.

New Braniff Complaint: Braniff Inc. and its unsecured creditors have filed a 
complaint against the bankrupt airline's former management and an adviser, 
accusing them of illegally draining cash from the ailing carrier. The complaint 
filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court earlier this month seeks $18.5 million in 
compensatory and punitive damages, a lawyer representing the creditors said. 
The complaint charges that the executives drained more than $6 million from the 
ailing Orlando, Fla., firm in part by charging inflated fees in a number of 
aircraft transactions between Braniff and its affiliates.

Microwave Corp., AT&amp;T Form Venture: The two companies said they have 
entered into an agreement to develop advanced microwave radio products for use 
in phone networks and private radio systems. 
</P>
<P>
The two will develop digital radio products that will use a new industry 
standard to send signals over the air through the fiber-optic cables 
increasingly used in telephone networks. The new standard is based on a 
technology called synchronous digital hierarchy transmission. Both companies 
will market the new radio products, with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. 
concentrating on high-capacity applications and Digital Microwave on low- to 
medium-capacity uses.

More Oil Rigs in Service: After two weeks of declines, the number of rigs 
searching for oil and gas in the United States climbed by 72 this week to 1,175 
nationwide, Baker Hughes Inc. reported. At the height of the oil boom in 
December, 1981, the count reached a record 4,500. It plunged to a low of 663 
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.

LABOR: NEW TEAMSTERS TACK: DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The price of democracy is usually high wherever it rears its beautiful head, 
and the price is certainly mounting rapidly in the Teamsters Union. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 600 Teamsters locals in the U.S. and Canada are holding closely 
supervised elections to select delegates to the union's 1991 international 
convention in preparation for its first-ever direct membership vote for new top 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
Three court-appointed administrators have already helped cut almost all of the 
union's longstanding links to the underworld by filing charges against 66 
officers and three local unions. Some officers have been ousted, others forced 
to resign. Some cases are still pending and new ones are being filed. 
</P>
<P>
The administrators also inaugurated an era of democracy in the Teamsters. 
</P>
<P>
The price for those laudable achievements includes millions of dollars from 
union dues to pay for the administrators and their staffs and for the union's 
legal fees incurred by the officers who mistakenly have been fighting many of 
the administrators' actions. 
</P>
<P>
More money will be spent by the growing number of candidates battling each 
other for the first time as they vie for top offices. Maybe the referendum will 
help democratize the Teamsters, though that isn't clear. In general, however, 
referendums in huge unions such as the Teamsters discourage potential 
candidates because they have to raise large sums to reach the widely scattered 
membership. Almost every other union avoids that kind of costly referendum by 
having their local unions democratically elect convention delegates who, in 
turn, elect the high national officers. 
</P>
<P>
More dramatic than the election procedure and the cost involved are the furious 
feuds democratization has sparked among leaders and would-be leaders struggling 
to hold or get top positions in the nation's largest union. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, some hopefuls are making the same kind of corruption charges 
against their opponents -- though fortunately with less justification -- that 
they once denounced as slanderous when the accusations came from outside the 
union and landed many former officers in prison. 
</P>
<P>
A few are making such accusations covertly, using words from a court-appointed 
administrator to back them up. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the other day some labor writers around the country, including 
this columnist, received a packet of legal documents from an anonymous union 
source in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The documents included a ruling by one of the administrators, Frederick Lacey, 
who used inflammatory language to veto what on the surface, at least, seemed to 
be a fairly noncontroversial move by the union officers. 
</P>
<P>
The officers wanted to convert into a grant a 1984 loan of more than $4 million 
from the international to one of its divisions, the Western Conference of 
Teamsters. 
</P>
<P>
It was probably legally necessary for Lacey to use the language he did, but his 
words make effective, though unfair, political ammunition to fire at one slate 
of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Lacey said converting the loan to a grant "would constitute or further . . . 
racketeering activity within the definition of (the law). Thus, I am vetoing 
it." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't explain how converting the loan to a grant would constitute 
racketeering, but his language can hurt the officers who wanted to make the 
conversion. 
</P>
<P>
Those officers include Weldon Mathis, the incumbent secretary-treasurer who is 
running for reelection, and others who are supporting him, including Arnie 
Weinmeister, director of the Western Conference, and Mike Riley, head of the 
Southern California Joint Council of Teamsters. 
</P>
<P>
They all swore in affidavits that the loan was approved by the late Jackie 
Presser, then president of the union, with the understanding that it would 
later be converted to a grant. 
</P>
<P>
Such a conversion may have been improper since it was initially called a loan, 
perhaps to temporarily disguise the deal to get it approved quickly by all of 
the officers. But Lacey doesn't even try to explain how that is racketeering 
since no one pocketed any of the money for personal use or for payoffs to 
racketeers. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, reporters reading Lacey's words could accurately write that the 
administrator had accused Mathis and his supporters of racketeering. Obviously, 
the person who covertly mailed the Lacey decision hoped to see it in the press 
to discredit Mathis and hurt his election chances. 
</P>
<P>
Whether secretly or openly, however, the candidates are unsparing in their 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, retiring President William McCarthy fired Walter Shea, his executive 
assistant, after Shea told McCarthy that he was a candidate for the union's 
presidency. Shea has held the same post for decades under three previous 
Teamsters presidents. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy is supporting Mathis for secretary-treasurer and R. V. Durham for 
president. McCarthy also took away Shea's union-paid car, credit cards and his 
office, saying Shea was "disloyal." 
</P>
<P>
Shea protested, calling it "unadulterated political retaliation." 
</P>
<P>
Foes of Shea counterattacked, charging that he is controlled by 80-year-old 
Joseph Trerotola, a vice president from New York who has never been charged 
with any crime but who has been named in government reports as an underworld 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
The charges and countercharges in this bizarre union battle are so many and 
complex that, assuming they want to, union members may not be able to sift out 
and elect honest leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, however, the democratic process will work so well that the members will 
choose wisely and complete the reforms the administrators have made so that the 
union can function more effectively than ever, with no renewal of ties to 
mobsters.

Hughes Aircraft said Monday that it will build an $84-million commercial and 
industrial electronics plant in Malaga, Spain, part of a company strategy to 
double its non-defense business within a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The plant will employ about 400 Spanish workers, about 25% of whom will be 
engineers. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said Spain provided significant economic incentives, valued 
at up to half the plant's cost. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said it will produce electronic connectors for circuit boards and cables 
at the facility, which will be located at a newly created technology park near 
the University of Malaga. Production at the 54,000-square-foot plant is 
scheduled to begin in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Among major defense firms, Hughes has embarked on the most ambitious effort to 
diversify into commercial markets. Chairman Malcolm Currie is seeking to 
increase commercial revenue to 40% of total sales, up from 20%, with defense 
revenue remaining level. 
</P>
<P>
The new Spanish facility will be operated as a subsidiary of Hughes 
Microelectronics Europa Ltd.

MARKET RALLIES IN LATE TRADING; DOW GAINS 5.94

<P>
Renewed Middle East jitters sent stocks cascading lower in morning trading 
Monday, but a bounce in the bond market and a late halt to an oil-price rally 
helped shares end mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Investors were rattled by news that Washington is seeking an authorization of 
force from the United Nations if Iraq does not withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index tumbled as much as 31 points, but then rallied 
to close up 5.94 at 2,533.17. Gainers narrowly led decliners 789 to 714 on the 
New York Stock Exchange. But over-the-counter stocks finished mostly lower, and 
transportation stocks were big losers as oil gained. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume was a still-thin 131.54 million shares, though up from 
Friday's 63.35 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The volume would have you believe that no one is getting panicky," said 
Jeffrey Kaminski, trader at Mabon Nugent. "Once again, the market has been very 
myopic responding to the Mideast." 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices, which peaked at $34.25 a barrel earlier in the day, settled at 
$32.95, up $1.05. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. decision on Iraq will likely be a key influence for the near term. 
"Institutions were extremely quiet and will probably remain so until we get 
more feedback on the U.N. resolution," said Ron Doran, director of 
institutional trading at C. L. King. The White House said it hoped that the 
U.N. Security Council would vote by Saturday on the proposed deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* MCA slipped 1/4 to 65 1/8 after it agreed to be acquired by Matsushita for 
$66 a share. The deal does not include MCA's New York area television station. 
Arbitragers said the offer was below expectations. Matsushita's NYSE-traded 
shares rose 2 1/4 to 128 3/4. Most other movie-company stocks gained slightly 
on the news, but Paramount fell 1 5/8 to 38 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Oil-related issues were mostly higher. Arco rose 2 1/8 to 127 1/8, British 
Petroleum gained 1 1/8 to 79 5/8, Texaco rose 1 to 58 1/8 and Unocal added 1/2 
to 27 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Financial stocks in particular were strong, including Well Fargo, up 2 1/4 to 
54 1/4; Security Pacific, up 1 1/8 to 22 3/8; HomeFed, up 5/8 to 5 5/8; Golden 
West, up 1 3/8 to 23 1/2, and Citicorp, up 3/4 to 13 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Mentor gained 3/4 to 12 after the Santa Barbara-based medical devices firm 
said it may buy back up to 1 million of its 10.7 million shares. Among other 
Southland issues, medical-care provider PacifiCare Health added 3/8 to 15 1/4, 
following Friday's 1 3/8 gain. The firm on Monday reported quarterly income of 
49 cents a share, up 36% from 36 cents a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
* Browning-Ferris fell 7/8 to 21 1/2 after a meeting with analysts yielded 
little encouragement about the environmental service company's near-term 
results. Prudential-Bache and Morgan Stanley cut their 1991 profit estimates. 
Waste Management fell in sympathy, losing 1 1/4 to 32 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign trading, German shares tumbled 2.7% as fears of a war in the Persian 
Gulf dampened the more positive mood of the past two weeks. The DAX index 
dropped 40.20 points to 1,443.16. 
</P>
<P>
Shares finished lower in London, as an early romp higher ran out of steam on a 
wave of profit taking. The Financial Times 100-share index lost 18.6 points to 
2,151.9. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stocks closed higher, largely for technical reasons. The key 225-share 
Nikkei average closed up 362.58 points, or 1.6%, at 23,762.86. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Bond Prices Gain in Seesaw Session 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rose moderately in slow trading on, sharply reversing course from 
an early decline amid signs of easing inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up 3/16 point, or $1.88 per $1,000 
in face amount. Its yield eased to 8.43% from 8.44% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 7.563%, up from 7.50% late Friday.

<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Climbs on Fears About Mideast 
</P>
<P>
The dollar advanced moderately against most major currencies, boosted by the 
growing concerns about the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the foreign exchange markets were "Middle East driven," with 
traders focused on the Bush Administration's attempts to win support for a 
proposed U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing military force to drive 
Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Investors tend to view the dollar as a safe haven during times of political 
uncertainty overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed at 1.487 marks in New York, up from 1.486 on Friday. The U.S. 
currency rose as far as 1.494 marks in New York but then fell back, leaving 
traders skeptical about the dollar's chances for holding on to its gains. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the yen suffered as war speculation raised questions about the 
Japanese economy. The dollar jumped to 129.05 yen in New York from late 
Friday's 127.10.

Grain Futures Off as Sale Hopes Fade 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybean futures prices fell broadly on the Chicago Board of Trade 
amid fading hopes for new sales of U.S. crops to U.S.S.R. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, wheat futures settled 4 to 6 cents lower, with the contract for 
delivery in December at $2.435 a bushel; corn was 1.75 to 3.75 cents lower, 
with December at $2.1875 a bushel; soybeans were 2.75 to 5.50 cents lower, with 
January at $5.765 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, gold and silver advanced on the New York Commodity Exchange. Gold 
for November delivery added $2.40 to $386.10 an ounce; silver rose 2.3 cents to 
$4.15.

SOVIETS SEEK U.S. AID TO HELP EASE FOOD SHORTAGES

Three senior Soviet trade officials met with their U.S. counterparts Monday to 
lobby for loans so Moscow can buy more much needed American grain and meat, 
U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet officials also briefed the Bush Administration on an acute food 
shortage currently plaguing the Soviet Union and discussed the outlook for 
future food purchases from the United States, the U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter told reporters that Moscow must 
liberalize its emigration laws to be considered for such loans. The Soviet 
Parliament is expected to debate new immigration laws in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Yeutter said U.S. funds for food aid programs handled by his department were 
running low and added that no official Soviet request had been made for 
emergency assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The visiting Soviet officials were chairman of the State Commission on Food 
Procurement, L. M. Timofhishin; deputy minister for foreign trade and economic 
relations, Yuri Chumakov, and Oleg Klimov, head of the key Soviet grain 
importing agency Exportkhleb. 
</P>
<P>
Klimov said in reply that without credit, Moscow, normally a big buyer of U.S. 
grain, could not buy such large amounts of grain as it previously used to. 
</P>
<P>
"American suppliers have very little chance to sell grain right now because 
there is no credit available," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet grain purchases from the United States have been very slack this year 
because of the hard-currency shortage.

MAN, 2 SONS GUILTY OF FRAUD AGAINST BANKS, THRIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Newport Beach man and his two sons pleaded guilty in federal court here 
Monday to defrauding several banks and thrifts, bringing to an end a 
wide-ranging task force investigation of bogus real estate transactions 
involving two dozen individuals. 
</P>
<P>
The convictions of John M. Coughlan Sr., and his sons, John Jr. of Long Beach 
and Errol of Malibu, came in two separate cases of fraud against several 
financial institutions, including Trinity Valley Savings &amp; Loan, a Texas 
thrift that is on the federal government's priority list for fraud 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The Coughlans each face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $500,000 
fine. U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson scheduled sentencing for March 25. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation of the trio was part of a five-year effort by federal, state 
and local authorities. The probe was sparked by the $118-million fraud on Bank 
of America in the mid-1980s, said Chief Assistant U.S. Atty. Terree A. Bowers. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation resulted in more than two dozen convictions on charges 
ranging from racketeering to wire fraud, prison terms of up to 20 years and 
restitution orders as high as $70 million, Bowers said. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been the most successful joint investigation in the S&amp;L area for 
our task force," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators included agents from the state attorney general's office, the 
Orange County district attorney's office and the city of Orange Police 
Department, he said. The probe has been dubbed Operation Orange Peel because 
most of the fraudulent schemes involved defendants and real estate in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"The perpetrators focused on Southern California real estate as vehicles to 
induce lenders from across the nation to provide funds," Bowers said. 
"Sometimes, they used bond guarantees and sometimes simply the lure of 
California real estate was enough to get the loans." 
</P>
<P>
The Coughlans were accused in a 17-count indictment of defrauding 11 
institutions of nearly $8.6 million, which they obtained as loans from banks, 
S&amp;Ls and an insurance company for construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
Using one of their firms, California Pacific Construction Co., the Coughlans 
sought construction loans usually through intermediaries and obtained guarantee 
bonds from Eagle Bonds and Insurance Brokers Inc. Guarantee bonds ensure that 
construction will be completed and loans will be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
But the Coughlans failed to tell lenders that they also owned Eagle Bonds, that 
the loan proceeds wouldn't be used on the projects, that they had no business 
relationship with the owners of the projects and that the loan proceeds would 
be put in their own bank account instead of an escrow account. 
</P>
<P>
The loans were never repaid. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, John Coughlan Sr., 74, pleaded guilty to two counts of mail and wire 
fraud. His sons John, 54, and Errol, 49, had pleaded guilty to the same two 
counts Nov. 16. Monday, the sons also pleaded guilty to falsifying loan 
documents submitted to the failed Trinity Valley Savings in Cleveland, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Coughlans were charged with helping Trinity owner Alan Ross Rothery 
divert thrift funds for his alleged embezzlement schemes involving loans to 
entities that he and his associates controlled. Rothery, also indicted in 
Texas, is awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
The 31-count Texas indictment charges that the Coughlan brothers obtained a 
$3.4-million loan from Trinity for renovating an Inglewood hospital when the 
brothers knew that it would be demolished to make way for the Century Freeway. 
The Coughlans instead used $1.6 million from the loan to pay off a Rothery debt 
at Commerce Bank in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Rothery was chairman of Orange Coast Thrift &amp; Loan in Los Alamitos in 1985 
when he used $1.6 million of the institution's money to buy control of Trinity. 
Banking regulators declared Orange Coast insolvent in 1986 and seized it. 
Thrift regulators also took the same action at Trinity in 1986.

Suit Award: Lifetime Memory Products, a small Huntington Beach maker of 
computer memory modules, said it has been awarded $450,000 by a Santa Clara 
County jury in a breach of contract lawsuit against Hyundai Electronics America 
in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleged that during a worldwide shortage of a common type of computer 
memory chip in 1987 and 1988, Hyundai reneged on a contract to deliver 100,000 
chips to Lifetime, then known as Columbus International. 
</P>
<P>
The chips were 64-kilobyte DRAMs, or dynamic random-access memory chips. 
</P>
<P>
"Hyundai could have honored the contract but instead decided to withhold the 
chips and auction them off," said Paul Columbus, president of Lifetime Memory, 
which has a dozen employees. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in Superior Court in San Jose in November, 1988, alleged that 
Lifetime received only 7,000 of the 100,000 chips that it ordered and that the 
rest were auctioned off at much higher prices, Columbus said. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Berka, an attorney for Hyundai Electronics America, a marketing 
subsidiary of Hyundai Electronics International of South Korea, said the 
company acted in good faith and is considering an appeal. Hyundai was unable to 
supply the DRAM chips to Lifetime because of a production problem, Berka said. 
He noted that the court dismissed charges of fraud and bad faith and that the 
jury awarded less than half the $883,000 that Columbus International was 
seeking. The verdict was handed down Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Columbus said the $450,000 represents lost profits. Lifetime will seek to 
recover attorneys' fees at a hearing scheduled for Jan. 3.

KNOTT'S CRAFTY ACT TO BOOST REVENUES;

BUENA PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Close your eyes, feel the wintry chill against your face and listen for the 
whistle of a steam train or an occasional jangle of a passing sleigh bell. Yes, 
Virginia, it does seem a little like Christmas in the Old West. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, the Christmas Crafts Festival at Knott's Berry Farm could 
come as a welcome relief to shoppers weary of the enclosed, banal atmosphere of 
most shopping malls and their predictable gift offerings. 
</P>
<P>
So for the fifth consecutive year, Knott's has turned its famed Ghost Town into 
a haven for artisans and craft workers in a bid to beckon holiday shoppers who 
might be looking for something a little out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
The festival is separated from the main amusement park, festooned with 
Christmas decorations and costumed workers. Entry costs adults $2 (children get 
in free), a fraction of the $21 adult admission normally charged to see the 
Ghost Town and the rest of the theme park. 
</P>
<P>
But what Knott's might sacrifice in ticket sales, it hopes to recoup in craft 
sales commissions. The park takes a percentage of the artisans' sales; the 
artisans get a crack at selling to cash-laden tourists in one of the nation's 
most popular theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a way to better utilize our park during a traditional slow period and to 
offer something unique that no other park can match," said Knott's spokesman 
Bob Deuel. "It's a distinctly unique experience from what the rest of the park 
offers." 
</P>
<P>
The big hits this season are $4 and $6 cinnamon-scented whisk brooms, coin 
jewelry and hand-painted silk scarves. Santa Claus holes up in a hastily 
converted dance hall and carolers have been known to stroll the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Deuel said attendance was strong during the Thanksgiving weekend, but just how 
strong he wouldn't say. Knott's generally does not release its attendance 
figures. Though sales in the festival village exceeded last year's figures for 
the four-day weekend, some artisans claimed more success than others. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Olah of Yorba Linda reported "a nice crowd and a lot of sales" for her 
jewelry while across the way, Eva Steele of Pomona said sales were simply "OK" 
for the debut of her dolls made from the heads of mops. 
</P>
<P>
Some, including Steele, are new at the handicraft sales game. Steele said she 
had visited the Knott's fair in the past with her two children and this year 
decided to try making and selling the dolls. 
</P>
<P>
Others, such as Susie Sutton of Irvine, are veterans of handicraft festivals 
around the state. She makes dolls and her husband writes and illustrates his 
own line of children's books. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our first time. It's really a different atmosphere," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Artisans are still adjusting to find the sales formula that works best. Wally 
Peterson, who assists visitors in creating their own clay pots for $5 or more, 
made a breakthrough of sorts Monday when he moved his potter's wheel to a main 
promenade where it will attract attention, instead of stuck behind a partition. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson, a Eugene, Ore., educator and inventor who just finished a teaching 
stint in Czechoslovakia, hopes to have as many as 300 people a day create their 
own pots under his direction. The pots are then fired, glazed and mailed to 
their creators. 
</P>
<P>
"They're looking for an experience," he said. "They want to have fun. I don't 
have to persuade them at all." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said he would like to increase his income by selling videotapes of 
people as they create their clay pots on the wheel. But such technology is not 
allowed as Knott's strives to maintain its Old West theme. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to recreate an early Christmas village," said Patsy Clark, 
general services merchandising manager. 
</P>
<P>
As such, the artisans have to stay within the theme and have to demonstrate the 
making of their handicrafts in the booths. Clark said she starts interviewing 
artisans as early as July, taking care not to duplicate products or trades. 
</P>
<P>
"We've established a reputation," she said. "People wait for us to open."

MARKETING: ATTACK OF THE BELT-TIGHTENERS: HORROR STORIES ABOUT AGENCY COST 
CUTTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Just how bad are things in the ad business? For 99 cents, you can find out. 
</P>
<P>
At least, that's all it cost one executive at a Los Angeles advertising and 
public relations firm. This official, who asked not to be named, recently 
received a rather disquieting long-distance call from an anxious New York 
client. 
</P>
<P>
The client wasn't calling to discuss current business strategy or to make plans 
for 1991. Rather, the client wanted a full explanation of a 99-cent postal fee 
that the agency had billed as part of an expense reimbursement report. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I thought it was a joke," said the executive. "But it was clear they 
were serious. So I ordered my secretary to look into it." Although the 
explanation did finally satisfy the client, the executive at the agency 
certainly wasn't too keen on the interrogation. "The whole thing is based on 
fear," said the official. "On the client side, more and more people are being 
forced to act out of fear." 
</P>
<P>
While chasing down documentation for penny-ante client expenses may be the 
extreme, the current economic climate has some advertising agencies and their 
clients scrambling for ways to save money. Some clients are paying bills more 
slowly or negotiating with their agencies for lower commissions. In addition to 
laying off employees, many agencies are cutting back on travel, relying less on 
costly outside vendors and generally accepting the penny-pinching antics of 
clients who are tightening their belts before the uncertainties of 1991 arrive. 
</P>
<P>
In the annals of how to save a buck on advertising, few could top the action 
recently taken by one client at the Los Angeles firm Asher/Gould Advertising. 
</P>
<P>
The client was having an out-of-town franchisee meeting to which it had invited 
three members of the agency -- the president, executive vice president and an 
account supervisor. When the three senior ad executives arrived at the hotel, 
they discovered that the client had booked all three men into a single room. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I asked was, 'Who's going to take the first shower?' " said 
Bruce Silverman, president of the agency, who noted that the client had also 
booked its staff three to a room. OK, so the rooms were actually suites. But 
one of the executives still had to sleep on a couch that pulled out into a bed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sign of the times," said Silverman. 
</P>
<P>
A realization of just how bad things have become recently hit Peter Stranger, 
president of the Los Angeles office of the ad firm Della Femina McNamee. During 
a speculative pitch for new business, the agency left behind some print 
advertising with a prospective client. When a different agency was chosen, the 
ads were sent back to Della Femina overnight -- with $50 postage due. 
</P>
<P>
"Hard to believe, isn't it?" posed Stranger. 
</P>
<P>
One client recently demanded that the Los Angeles agency Robert Elen &amp; 
Associates cut its commission -- about 15% of the advertiser's total budget -- 
in half. The agency refused. Result: After Jan. 1, the agency will no longer 
represent the client. "I'm not going to be a bank for my client," said Robert 
Elen, president of the firm. "None of us can afford to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even harder to believe is what one client requested last month from its 
Los Angeles agency, Fotouhi Alonso Inc. Advertising &amp; Marketing. 
</P>
<P>
The agency was planning to photograph a client's product for a print ad. 
Besides the photographer who takes the photo, such shoots often require an art 
director who makes certain that the lighting is right and that the product is 
shown in the best possible manner. But art directors do not come cheaply. Some 
command daily rates of $500 or more. 
</P>
<P>
So, in an attempt to cut costs, the client ordered the agency not to send an 
art director. The agency argued against it, but to no avail. The result? "We 
ended up spending about $800 to retouch the photo," said Farida Fotouhi, 
president of the agency. "Sometimes, in the sincere effort to save a little 
money, people can make decisions that actually cost more money." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fotouhi is also taking administrative chores much more seriously. 
For years, the agency was losing up to $500 each month by not billing clients 
promptly -- or at all -- for things such as overnight deliveries or courier 
packages. Now, it sends out monthly statements for these things. "You have to 
organize the no-brainer stuff," said Fotouhi. "Otherwise you can get killed." 
</P>
<P>
At the Campbell &amp; Wagman agency, executives are turning less often to 
headhunters who sometimes charge 20% to 30% for executive placements. There's a 
"new degree of intensity" of cost cutting at the agency, said President Craig 
Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising free-lancers -- who can command up to $3,000 per week -- are being 
used sparingly by many agencies. "You could have someone on staff for a month 
for that kind of pay," said Rick Colby, president of Larsen Colby Koralek. 
</P>
<P>
And many of the costly outside vendors -- such as photography studios and 
editing houses -- that the agency D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles used to 
rely on now have to look elsewhere for business. "We've set up a complete 
studio in-house," said James Helin, managing director. "We can do everything 
now without going outside." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, however, agencies can go overboard on cost cutting. One executive 
said he recently took a client to lunch, and both men sat eyeballing the check 
long after the meal was finished before the client finally picked it up. 
</P>
<P>
"The horror stories go both ways," points out Richard Zien, president of 
Mendelsohn/Zien. There's one agency executive Zien knows of who recently pulled 
one of the all-time low moves in cost cutting. "The guy took his client to 
lunch one day," said Zion. "Later on, he not only sent the client the bill, but 
he added on an agency commission." 
</P>
<P>

Wienerschnitzel Ad Pokes Fun at Quayle 
</P>
<P>
Does the "Wiener Dude" have the wrong attitude? Perhaps Dan Quayle would think 
so. 
</P>
<P>
If you're not familiar with Wiener Dude, this unseen commercial character is an 
invention of the Newport Beach fast-food chain, Wienerschnitzel. 
</P>
<P>
In a new radio spot, a phone call is received at the White House. "Mr. 
President, there is a Wiener Dude on the phone," an operator says. 
</P>
<P>
Responds the president: "Tell the vice president I'm busy." 
</P>
<P>
To that, the operator replies, "Not a wiener, a Wiener Dude." 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Wienerschnitzel say they've received only one complaint about 
that radio spot. "If this was something we were getting a lot of calls on, we'd 
consider pulling it," said Tom Amberger, marketing director for 
Wienerschnitzel. "We're just trying to break through the clutter of traditional 
fast-food advertising." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Magazine Makes Its Home on the Range 
</P>
<P>
At a time when many magazines are riding off into the sunset, along comes one 
looking for its own home on the range -- Cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
The quarterly is written for, by and about cowboys. "The overriding theme of 
the magazine upholds the mythical image of the cowboy who conquered the 
wide-open spaces," said Darrell Arnold, editor and publisher of the Colorado 
Springs, Colo., publication. 
</P>
<P>
Although the majority of the magazine's 10,000 readers are in Nevada, Texas and 
Colorado, it has subscribers who are "cowboys at heart" in Australia, said 
Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
Full-page color ads cost $1,500. Among its early advertisers -- the Cowboy 
Country General Store of Hollywood, which specializes in mail orders of Western 
essentials. 
</P>
<P>
No word yet on whether the biggest cowboy advertiser of all, the Marlboro man, 
will show up in any issues. 
</P>

Sony Subsidiary Plans Video Game Ad Blitz 
</P>
<P>
A Nintendo licensee is about to give Southern California TV viewers the sort of 
ad blitz that only happens at Christmastime. 
</P>
<P>
Between now and mid-January, CSG Imagesoft -- a Sony subsidiary -- will air an 
estimated 1,600 TV spots regionally for its "Solstice" video game. The ad 
features a dwarf chasing after a magic wand that transforms the dwarf into a 
giant. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's the heaviest media blitz in video game history," said Jack Roth, 
president of Admarketing, the Los Angeles agency that created the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the ads mentions a retailer -- such as Target or Toys R Us -- that 
sells the software. Yet none of the retailers are paying for the ads. So why 
mention them? "Those manufacturers who know how to become important to 
retailers are the ones who will get shelf space," said Roth.

<P>
WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A BLESSED EVENT IN VICTORIA KARTER'S LIFE MAY HAVE CAUSED 
THE CONDITION THAT LED TO HER DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Late on a Friday afternoon in September, Victoria Karter walked into the Four 
Seasons Hotel, declined an offered fourth-floor room and took one instead on 
the 19th floor. 
</P>
<P>
A tall, dark-haired woman with an angular face, Karter, 33, carried a garment 
bag as well as a purse. She stayed in the room only an hour or so, but it was 
long enough to leave cigarettes snuffed out in ashtrays and to put a ring of 
lipstick around the neck of the Jack Daniels liquor bottle she brought with 
her. Long enough, too, to make a telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
The call was intended for Kathy Boone, the woman who had been Karter's friend 
for more than 20 years. But because Boone wasn't there, Karter talked to 
Virginia Rivera, Boone's mother and a woman who considered Karter a member of 
her own family. 
</P>
<P>
Karter told Rivera what she had been telling Boone since soon after the birth 
of her first child 4 1/2 months earlier: She wanted to commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"She told me that she wanted to talk to Kathy and she needed to tell her a few 
things before she would kill herself," Rivera said. "I said, 'Vicky, give me 
your number and I'll have Kathy call you. She should be here any moment.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Karter refused to say where she was. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'Mrs. Rivera, I'm so sick, I feel so sick.' At that moment it seemed 
like she dropped the phone. I kept calling her. I could hear noises. I thought 
maybe someone was there with her. I stayed on the phone the longest time. Then 
all of a sudden I didn't hear anything." 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Karter had walked out on the balcony of Room 1902 and jumped to her 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Owen Lee sits in the living room of his comfortable Newport Beach home, 
bouncing his daughter, Rachel, on his knee and then putting a bottle in her 
mouth. Periodically, he stops talking to fight back tears. 
</P>
<P>
A dark-haired, bespectacled businessman who chooses his words carefully, Lee 
says that both he and Karter had wanted children. "My personal point of view is 
. . . that's what life is all about, to have a family and raise kids." 
</P>
<P>
Lee, 35, thinks of himself as an "old-fashioned kind of guy" who wanted to 
marry just once, "settle down and live happily ever after. Unfortunately, 
happily ever after in my case was three years." 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago he was on top of the world. A husband and father-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
Today he is a widower, left to raise an infant daughter on his own. He tries to 
juggle his work schedule to spend as much time as possible with his child. He 
hopes he doesn't hear an old favorite song on the radio to make him burst into 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that despite the adversity that I'm facing right now, my primary focus 
has to be toward my baby," Lee says. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sitting here right now and you see me and I'm pretty composed and I can 
talk to you about the incident. A few weeks ago, if you had seen me, I would be 
crying and . . . distraught about not knowing what's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Baby books and toys dot the house. There is other literature, too, explaining a 
condition Lee said he never heard of before Rachel's birth: postpartum 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
The official cause of Karter's death: Injuries sustained in a suicide jump. 
</P>
<P>
But her husband blames her death on postpartum depression, for which she was 
being treated at the time of her suicide and an illness Lee said he heard about 
for the first time when his wife was hospitalized at UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
That was almost three months after Rachel's birth in late April, a typically 
happy, blessed event for most women, but one that plunged Karter into despair. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors say that while most mothers get the "baby blues" after giving birth, 
the condition lasts only a short while. Postpartum depression, by contrast, 
strikes about 10% of new mothers and does not "cure itself." Postpartum 
depression typically requires psychiatric therapy and/or medication, including 
anti-depressants. 
</P>
<P>
An even more rare disorder is postpartum psychosis, from which sufferers may 
lose touch with reality, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Postpartum disorders have been known for centuries, but only in the past 10 to 
15 years have they been studied in depth. Medical opinion is divided on whether 
the depression stems from a chemical imbalance after childbirth or if it is 
caused largely by existing emotional problems -- troubles that Lee said did not 
appear in Karter before giving birth. 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrists say only a small minority of those who develop a full-fledged 
depression wind up killing themselves or their children. One doctor calls the 
number small but significant. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Hickman, a San Diego psychologist who has treated hundreds of women 
suffering from postpartum depression, said women who have depression but not 
psychosis kill themselves but not their children. She said the number of 
suicides is not known. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the National Institute of Mental Health has no statistics on suicides 
linked to postpartum disorders. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Boone and Vicky Karter met in 1968, 11-year-old junior high school 
students. Boone described her friend as happy and outgoing, an artist talented 
at drawing, a writer of poetry, a journalism student, "very creative." 
</P>
<P>
Boone's mother, Virginia Rivera, called Karter "an average, normal girl." She 
was at the Rivera house in Montebello so often as a child that Rivera "felt 
like she was our stepdaughter or adopted daughter." The death of her mother a 
year or so after Karter graduated from high school struck her hard, Rivera 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It bothered her a lot that she didn't have her mother there for her. I told 
her whenever she needed someone, just call me, and she always did." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, even after Karter went off to college at Cal State Long Beach 
and Boone married not long after high school, the friends remained close. 
Karter would bring boyfriends by to meet Boone's mother, but she kept waiting 
to meet the right one to marry. 
</P>
<P>
Karter and Lee met at a dance in Beverly Hills in 1985. After dating for two 
years, they married in Las Vegas on her 30th birthday, the first marriage for 
each. They held a party later for friends at the Newport Beach house that had 
been his and became theirs. She worked in the family office supply store in 
East Los Angeles. He worked at the office machine distribution company he had 
founded after graduating from USC in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
If there was one smudge on the picture, it was Karter's frequent concern with 
what other people would think, and her tendency to make mountains out of 
molehills, Boone said. 
</P>
<P>
"Vicky was the kind of person that would make everything into a major problem," 
she said. "When she was thinking of marrying Greg, she would wonder, should she 
do it, shouldn't she do it. . . . What if it didn't work out? What if she got 
divorced?" 
</P>
<P>
But the marriage was a happy one, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't say we agreed on everything 100%, but we never had fights, yelling 
fights or anything like that. . . . We got along exceptionally well." 
</P>
<P>
And a little more than two years after their marriage, Karter became pregnant. 
"She seemed the happiest I've ever seen her," Boone remembered. 
</P>
<P>
But after Rachel's birth, Karter's attitude apparently changed. 
</P>
<P>
"I went with my kids to the hospital with balloons," Boone said. Karter "didn't 
seem like someone who had a baby. It didn't seem like a joyous thing to her." 
</P>
<P>
Boone recalled that one day, about a month after the birth, receiving an 
"hysterical" phone call from Karter. "She said she didn't know what to do. The 
baby cried a lot, had colic; Vicky wasn't prepared, I guess, for that. She was 
stuck in the house. She didn't know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Lee said the newborn baby was in intensive care for three days for treatment of 
jaundice. When mother and daughter came home, Rachel cried seemingly around the 
clock for nearly three months, he said. But while his wife wasn't getting much 
sleep at all, he didn't see any "abnormal type problems." 
</P>
<P>
That changed in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
First came a call from Karter's sister, Lee said, telling him that "she was 
very concerned for Vicky's safety and Vicky had expressed some thoughts of 
suicide to her." The next day came a call from Boone, saying she, too, was 
worried about Vicky. 
</P>
<P>
An alarmed Lee took Karter to UCI Medical Center, where she was hospitalized 
until the end of the month. Lee said doctors there diagnosed her condition as 
postpartum depression and prescribed the anti-depressant drug Pamelor, the 
trade name for a generic drug known as nortriptyline. (A medical center 
spokeswoman said that because of state and federal laws protecting the privacy 
of psychiatric patients, the hospital could neither confirm she had been a 
patient there, nor discuss her case.) 
</P>
<P>
When she came home from the hospital, Lee and Karter hired a nanny/housekeeper 
to help with Rachel. Lee, who attended Lamaze classes with his wife during her 
pregnancy and was in the delivery room during birth, said he also tried to help 
more with the baby. 
</P>
<P>
After about two weeks at home, in which Karter received lots of rest, Lee said, 
the medication seemed to take full effect, and "I was utterly amazed," Lee 
said. Normally an even-tempered person, after Rachel's birth Karter had swung 
into deep depression. Suddenly, "she was uncharacteristically too enthusiastic. 
. . . All of a sudden she's the most enthusiastic, energetic person I've ever 
met. And I'm thinking to myself, 'Wow, these drugs are working great. This is 
fantastic. It's a miracle.' " 
</P>
<P>
Boone saw the change, too. One day Karter telephoned her "and said she felt 
great . . . just felt wonderful. She had told me before that she felt she was 
walking around in a cloud, a fog, that she couldn't function. Then this one day 
she was wonderful, her head was clear, and for about three weeks she was like 
that, everything was fine." 
</P>
<P>
But before long Karter became depressed again. Lee said his wife told him she 
didn't understand what was happening, that she would go to the mall, see other 
women smiling happily as they pushed their babies in strollers. "And here I am, 
I've got a nice home and a nice husband and a nice baby, and yet I'm feeling 
weird," Lee remembered his wife saying. 
</P>
<P>
"And dumb me, I'm saying, 'Ah, things will pass, you're just getting back (to 
normal). Did you take your medicine?' " 
</P>
<P>
Boone said Karter told her that the doctors rejected her request to stop taking 
Pamelor when she was feeling better, but agreed to lower the dosage. Later it 
was increased again, but it didn't seem to help. (The doctor at the Santa Ana 
psychiatric offices of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program whom Lee said 
treated his wife after she was discharged from the hospital, declined comment, 
referring inquiries to the facility's administrator, who did not return phone 
calls.) 
</P>
<P>
Karter told Boone in one of their almost daily telephone conversations that she 
just couldn't function. 
</P>
<P>
"She kept telling me she was a bad person and everyone would be better off 
without her," Boone recalled. Karter said that after she died her husband 
eventually "would find somebody else and that person would take care of the 
baby." 
</P>
<P>
Karter rejected Boone's advice to get away for a few days. She said she was 
afraid to leave the baby at home for fear people would think she wasn't a good 
mother. She was afraid to admit her thoughts of suicide to her doctors for fear 
she would be institutionalized for the rest of her life, which would bankrupt 
her husband, Boone said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 19, a Wednesday, a woman who declined to give her name showed up at 
Newport Beach police headquarters at 8 p.m. with a disturbing tale. 
</P>
<P>
The woman said she had been at Cliff Drive Park in the Newport Heights section 
of Newport Beach a little earlier. While there she saw a woman with an infant. 
The woman seemed "despondent." The good Samaritan walked the woman to her car, 
copied her license plate number, and told police of her concern. 
</P>
<P>
Police traced the number to Karter and visited her and Lee at their home. After 
interviewing the husband and wife separately and together, police concluded 
Karter was no danger to herself or anyone else then, had resources she could 
turn to if she needed help, and left. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Karter told her housekeeper she was going out for a while. At 1 
p.m., she made a reservation for a room at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport 
Beach. She showed up at 3:30 p.m. to check in. One hotel employee called her 
"pleasant." Another described her as "distant." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 4 p.m., Karter called Rivera to ask if Boone was there. Rivera 
said no, that her daughter was probably either still at her home in Cerritos or 
on her way to the Rivera house in Montebello. Karter said she'd try the 
Cerritos number. 
</P>
<P>
About 4:30, Karter called Rivera again, saying she hadn't been able to reach 
Boone. "I told her to leave her number where she was and I'd have Kathy call 
her," Rivera remembered. "She said she was going to kill herself. She said she 
didn't want anyone to know where she was, she didn't want anyone to stop her." 
</P>
<P>
Minutes after she heard the phone drop and her pleas to Karter go unanswered, 
Rivera's daughter arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Boone called Karter's housekeeper. She called Lee at one of his company's 
offices, in Moreno Valley. She called the Newport Beach police. 
</P>
<P>
Lee began frantically calling Newport Beach police. He also called the 
Sheriff's Department and California Highway Patrol. Then he drove home, where 
he made more phone calls. And waited. 
</P>
<P>
He called the Newport Beach police again, but found the dispatcher "evasive." 
He called the Costa Mesa police to see if they knew anything about his wife. He 
called Newport Beach again, talking to a dispatcher whom Lee said promised "to 
have detectives talk to me." 
</P>
<P>
"Not knowing is worse than knowing," Lee said, and for more than three hours he 
didn't know. About 8:30 that night, however, two detectives and a deputy 
coroner showed up at his house "and said they had information about my wife." 
</P>
<P>
He knew.

Our favorite shrink dropped by the other Friday afternoon for an 
end-of-the-workweek drink. It was warm enough to sit in our back yard, and the 
talk was as good as the weather. It was mostly about men and women. 
</P>
<P>
The subject was on my mind for several reasons. Two newspaper stories that day 
had caught my attention. One had to do with the deep soup that Executive Editor 
Max Frankel of the New York Times found himself in when he told a symposium on 
"Women and the Media" at the Columbia School of Journalism that it is now 
easier for him to fire women than blacks because there are more women in the 
newsroom these days. 
</P>
<P>
He was talking about the politics of the workplace, explaining that "when a 
woman screws up, it is no longer a political act for me to fire her . . . but 
(the newspaper's blacks) are still precious, still hothouse in management." 
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing predictable brouhaha in which he was scalded by several black 
female reporters and reminded that the New York Times ranks last among major 
newspapers in female bylines, he compounded the felony by adding: "If you are 
covering local teas, you've got more women than if you're the Wall Street 
Journal." 
</P>
<P>
The same day, the subsequently defeated Democratic candidate for governor of 
Massachusetts, John Silber, noted that day care has resulted in a "generation 
of abused children by women who have thought that a third-rate day care center 
was just as good as a first-rate home." Whereupon the head honcho of the 
National Organization for Women allowed as how Silber was the greatest threat 
to local women since the Boston Strangler. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I'm not about to get into the same deep soup by defending either one of 
these outrageous -- and reasonably stupid -- assertions (although Frankel's 
original comment was probably a simple statement of fact) except to suggest the 
possibility that both of them might have been made with tongue slightly in 
cheek. I wasn't there so I don't know -- but I do know that tongue-in-cheek is 
a posture that gets no points from the more ardent feminists. Humor is not 
their long suit -- especially bad humor, which is regarded as a poor disguise 
for macho sentiments, and probably is. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so men are paying the price for fostering many years of male-female 
inequality in the workplace by having to tread lightly with women in certain 
ways in which men deal with each other routinely. And I think one reason men 
are having difficulty with this is that some feminists seem to want to equalize 
the sexes rather than equalize treatment of the sexes. And that's an enormous 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
Men and women are happily, joyfully, delightfully and fundamentally very 
different -- and I'm not talking about the physical differences. They're 
individually different too, of course, but that's another matter. Right now 
I'll stick to the generalizations. 
</P>
<P>
Our psychiatrist friend said that if 10 men and 10 women -- all strangers -- 
were put into a room together, within a few moments the women would be split 
into small groups talking animatedly to one another, while the men would be 
reading or watching television. Within an hour, the women would know a great 
deal about each other while the men would probably still be strangers. 
</P>
<P>
He told an illuminating story about a man who was being pressed to remarry 
several years after a long, failed marriage. The man was resisting and was 
finally asked if he preferred to be alone. He said, no, that wasn't the case at 
all, that he had nothing per se against marriage, then added plaintively: "I 
don't want to be alone. I just want to be left alone." 
</P>
<P>
This distinction eludes a lot of women who tend to be naturally gregarious and 
are therefore baffled and frequently irritated by men who aren't. 
</P>
<P>
My wife has an absolutely uncanny facility for bursting into my sanctum during 
the final 30 seconds of a close football game or the bottom of the ninth inning 
of a crucial baseball game I'm watching on TV. She will plant her feet and 
announce firmly: "There are some things we need to talk over." 
</P>
<P>
That leaves me three options. I can turn off the game, which is not acceptable. 
I can pretend to listen to her while covertly watching the game, which usually 
results in delivering some obviously wrong answers and irritates the hell out 
of her. Or I can explain that the game is almost over, that this moment is 
crucial, and can we delay the conversation briefly. 
</P>
<P>
At which point, she says, "I know how long it takes to play the last 30 seconds 
of a football game" -- a sage observation based on experience -- and stalks out 
of the room to resolve the crisis unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably that crisis might involve an impending divorce or the dog being 
eaten by our neighborhood opossum or a just-launched nuclear attack, but the 
odds of that are long, and I think I would detect such an imperative note in 
her voice. She is much more likely to be referring to a conflict in social 
engagements three weeks hence or who is going to pick up my stepson at one of 
his myriad extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
Under similar circumstances, a man would never behave in this way. He would 
recognize and respect the other person's involvement and withdraw quietly 
unless something cataclysmic was at hand. Which, I suppose, goes back to that 
roomful of 20 people and the disparate behavior of men and women. 
</P>
<P>
Cliches become cliches because in the beginning they have a core of truth. 
That's why most of the cliches about the emotional and temperamental 
differences between men and women -- with which our shrink friend generally 
agreed -- are more or less true. 
</P>
<P>
Women tend to be more open, impulsive, honest with their feelings, ready and 
able to talk rather than duke out problems. Men are more reserved, deliberate 
in judgment, internal and -- when pushed too hard -- willing to get physical. 
All of which, it seems to me, adds up to the fact that, in general, women are 
better suited to certain types of activities than men -- and vice versa. Which 
is no big deal, something to celebrate rather than deplore. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, we seem to be forever trying to fuzz those differences. A recent Oprah 
Winfrey show devoted itself to the mysteries of male involvement in spectator 
sports. One of the women panelists offered a solution. Why not, she said, get 
involved with your man's sports mania? "If you just learn a little bit at a 
time, a passion will follow. Men aren't born with this genetic blueprint. . . . 
They learned it, just like we can." 
</P>
<P>
I think she's wrong on every count. A great many men probably were born with 
this genetic blueprint, and I don't think the most dedicated devotion to 
learning it on the part of women will ever produce passion. And passion is 
essential. Besides that, I can't think of anything worse than watching football 
on TV with a wife who is determined to share this experience with me. 
</P>
<P>
Let's just celebrate the differences.

800 WINE, DINE AT NEW HAMMER MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Industrialist/philanthropist/art collector/nonagenarian Armand Hammer drew up a 
list of 800 friends and threw a big, splashy dinner party Sunday night to 
celebrate the opening of his new Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural 
Center in Westwood. (It opens to the public Wednesday.) 
</P>
<P>
Guests were greeted by a Christmas tree, a pianist at a white baby grand piano 
and a welcoming committee of waiters bearing flutes of Perrier-Jouet champagne. 
That was just in the white Carrara marble-sheathed lobby on Wilshire Boulevard 
before guests ascended the marble staircase to the five galleries. The two 
galleries housing the opening Kazimir Malevich exhibition were easily the most 
populated. 
</P>
<P>
Said collector Fred Weisman: "My first take is . . . I like it very much, and I 
like what I see inside. I like the space. It's very functional." 
</P>
<P>
"I would love to have seen the art go to the County Museum of Art," offered 
newscaster Jess Marlow, "but he has the prerogative of displaying it the way he 
wants to." 
</P>
<P>
The guest list was diverse, including Metromedia chairman and president John 
Kluge and Orion Pictures chairman Arthur Krim (both members of the board of 
Hammer's Occidental Petroleum Corp.), actress Marisa Berenson and Harvey 
Fields, the chief rabbi of Wilshire Boulevard Temple where Hammer is a member 
of the congregation. Hammer's son Julian and grandchildren Michael and Casey 
also attended. 
</P>
<P>
Constantly hovering over Hammer were a cadre of Oxy executives and his private 
tuxedoed security battalion. At the head table he was seated between his 
friend, Daniele Mitterrand, the wife of French president Francois Mitterrand, 
and Hilary Gibson, the museum's director of development. One seat away was 
Hammer's personal physician, Dr. Rosamarie Purazo. Mayor Tom Bradley sat across 
the table. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sitting where the parking lot used to be," mused Julian Hammer. "I 
couldn't do something like this in 100 years working full-time -- and he was 
also running a company." 
</P>
<P>
The museum's spacious open-air "Leonardo" courtyard is destined, no doubt, to 
become a great L.A. party spot, provided one remembers not to check one's coat, 
even when the radiant heating is on full blast. The area can accommodate dozens 
of dinner tables plus a huge dance floor. And this crowd did dance and dine, on 
green salad, smoked Norwegian salmon with golden caviar, tenderloin of prime 
beef and a buffet of dozens of cakes, tarts and cookies. 
</P>
<P>
As for the man of the evening, Hammer said he was feeling great. "I think it's 
superb. To think, in two and a half years," he said of the time since his idea 
was transformed into reality. "It's a miracle."

KEEPING FIT: DOWNSIDE OF WORKING OUT: INJURIES;

THOSE WHO EXERCISE FREQUENTLY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE HURT THAN COUCH POTATOES. 
THEY'RE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO SEEK MEDICAL HELP AS SOON AS THEY NEED IT.

I thought it was only a small step. But it turned out to be more of a giant 
leap. And when my foot hit the ground as I hopped off the bus that night, I 
felt something go "pop" in my ankle. I took a step, and felt something else: 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
"You OK?" asked one of my traveling companions. 
</P>
<P>
"What? Oh, it's nothing. I'll be all right in a minute," I said as I limped 
along. "I think I just need to walk on it a little more and let it work itself 
out." 
</P>
<P>
With every awkward step, I told myself the same thing: "It's nothing." I was 
tough. I was in good shape. I worked out faithfully, three times a week or 
more. I was not about to be done in by a mere municipal trolley. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, I was scared of what might happen if I did admit that something 
serious was wrong. I wasn't quite as far away from home as Neil Armstrong was 
when he took his famous step. But Athens, Greece, wasn't exactly my own back 
yard, either. 
</P>
<P>
We'd been planning to hit the local discos later that night. Luckily for me and 
my throbbing ankle, it was the off-season, and they weren't open on Wednesdays. 
Otherwise, my continued denial could have been embarrassing. ("What do you 
mean? I always dance this way.") 
</P>
<P>
The next day, still in pain -- and still in denial -- I hobbled out to buy a 
pair of sturdy lace-up boots to make walking less painful, or as I preferred to 
think of it, more comfortable. Then I proceeded to walk around Europe for a 
week on what turned out to be a broken ankle. 
</P>
<P>
My doctor, family practitioner Gregg A. DeNicola in Yorba Linda, says I'm 
lucky: I made matters worse by toughing it out, but I don't seem to have caused 
myself any permanent complications. Some of his other patients who denied or 
ignored injuries weren't so fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
One of his patients waited two weeks to seek treatment for an injured wrist. 
"He had a broken navicular bone, and if you miss that fracture, you can get 
vascular necrosis, which basically means you're not getting enough oxygen to 
the bone," DeNicola says. "That was last summer. He needed surgery, and he 
probably will still be in a cast for several months." 
</P>
<P>
He told me other horror stories about neglected injuries: knee fractures that 
ultimately needed plates and screws to repair, joints that unexpectedly 
dislocated or froze up completely. 
</P>
<P>
But those cases are relatively rare, he says, even though injuries aren't at 
all uncommon in his patients who make a special effort to stay fit. Running, 
aerobics, weekend softball and lunch-hour basketball, biking, hiking, soccer 
and other activities all may make a person more fit in the long run, but those 
who exercise regularly are also more likely to be injured than their 
couch-potato counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
The saving grace is that body-conscious types also tend to seek treatment 
promptly, thereby reducing their chances of complications. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny -- I was talking to a med school classmate who now practices in 
Nebraska, and he says people there wait until they're half dead before they 
break down and go to the doctor," DeNicola says. "And when they do, they don't 
want to hear the medical terms for what's wrong with them. They just want to 
get better." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County patients, DeNicola says, not only go in right away, but they also 
are likely to mention specific medical terms even before their doctors do. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a lot of people who say, 'I think I have a meniscus tear,' or 'Do you 
think it could be a rotator cuff problem?' A lot of them have read about sports 
figures who've had certain injuries, and they think, 'Hey, that sounds just 
like mine,' " says DeNicola. 
</P>
<P>
They may well be right, he says. "Even casual athletes can suffer the same 
kinds of injuries the professionals do. And with a lot of these things, being 
in good shape isn't going to help. If you zigged when you should have zagged, 
you can get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Injuries to the ankles and knees are far and away the most common, he says, 
followed by lower back and arm and shoulder injuries. 
</P>
<P>
DeNicola, who is also a clinical professor of family practice at UC Irvine and 
the University of Southern California, says you don't necessarily have to drop 
everything and run to the doctor the minute you're injured. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't really think of anything except a dislocation or a bone sticking out 
where it would be wrong to wait for 24 hours," DeNicola says. "Put ice on it -- 
I recommend 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off -- to reduce swelling. Elevate the 
injury if you can. After a day, you should switch to moist heat. It may be even 
more sore and swollen the next day. If it really bothers you, you should call 
the doctor." 
</P>
<P>
Some warning signs: Profound swelling usually means trouble, DeNicola says. And 
if you have tenderness in addition to pain, that could also be a problem. "Pain 
is subjective," he says. "But tenderness -- when it hurts to touch it -- is 
more objective. That probably means it's worth having it looked at." If a joint 
is unstable, that may mean tendon or ligament damage, which could lead to 
dislocation, he says. 
</P>
<P>
One-fourth to one-third of all ankle injuries beyond simple sprains still have 
some symptoms a year later, DeNicola says, "Primarily because they don't get 
checked early enough." 
</P>
<P>
And with children, early treatment is even more crucial. "For kids, take all 
that and multiply it by 100," DeNicola says. "Kids may not complain as much, 
but if they do have a fracture or something like that they're much more likely 
to have problems. So it's always better to have it checked." 
</P>
<P>
OK, I've learned my lesson. Meanwhile, I'm concentrating these days on 
upper-body workouts -- on crutches.

GARRETT BRINGS A NEW DIMENSION TO JOKES; 
</P>
<P>
COMEDY: HE GETS A LOT OF MILEAGE FROM HIS HEIGHT. HE WILL APPEAR WEDNESDAY AT 
THE LAFF STOP IN NEWPORT BEACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Six years after becoming the first "Star Search" grand champion in the comedy 
category, Brad Garrett prefers to downplay the television talent contest that 
lifted him from relative obscurity in Southern California comedy clubs. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the 6-foot-9 comedian's career hasn't stood still since "Star 
Search" host Ed McMahon handed him a check for $100,000 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Garrett, who will do two shows at the Laff Stop in Newport Beach on 
Wednesday, has appeared repeatedly on the "Tonight Show" and "The Arsenio Hall 
Show." 
</P>
<P>
He has served as opening acts for show business legends Sammy Davis Jr., Frank 
Sinatra and Liza Minnelli. He also has been a regular on "The Hollywood 
Squares" and "The Match Game," and he even starred in his short-lived CBS 
sitcom, "First Impressions." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett is still reaping honors. In 1989, the Las Vegas Review Journal voted 
him Best Opening Act/Comedy Performer in Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
But there's no denying that his big win on "Star Search" was the kind of career 
break that comedians would kill their mothers-in-law for. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave me six weeks of television exposure in prime-time on a new show," said 
Garrett in a phone interview from El Paso where he was appearing last week. 
</P>
<P>
And from that prime-time exposure, he said, one thing simply led to another: 
After seeing him on "Star Search," Crystal Gayle asked him to serve as opening 
act for her show in Las Vegas. "Tonight Show" staffers also saw Garrett on 
"Star Search" and asked him to audition for them. And it was on the "Tonight 
Show" that Diana Ross saw him and asked him to open for her. And then Julio 
Iglesias saw Garrett open for Ross and asked Garrett to open for him. 
</P>
<P>
"It just snowballed," said Garrett, "and here I am in El Paso. Isn't it 
exciting? The hoedown's in an hour." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett, who is on the road 30 weeks out of the year and works in casinos 12 
weeks a year, is known for his deep baritone voice, his mobile face and his 
array of characterizations and impressions that ranges from Bill Cosby and 
Dustin Hoffman to James Earl Jones and Hulk Hogan (Garrett, in fact, provided 
the Hulkster's voice in a Saturday morning cartoon series). 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard-born, San Fernando Valley-reared comedian is a former class clown 
who, despite his height, never made it as a basketball player in high school. 
As he says, "When you're 6-foot-9 and can't play ball, that's a lot of pressure 
on a white guy. But I'm not supposed to be athletic. Everybody knows, Jews 
don't dribble." 
</P>
<P>
The one-time waiter broke into stand-up comedy in 1981 when he was 20. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett's commanding height -- "I'm a little taller than your average medical 
building" -- plays a factor in his comedy act. He always mentions his height as 
soon as he walks out on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to," he said, "especially at the Laff Stop -- the air vent is right 
over my head." 
</P>
<P>
The dark-haired Garrett often says to the audience: "I know what you're 
thinking: Gregg Brady and Herman Munster had a child." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Garrett is now doing Herman Munster in his act. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably the hardest impression I ever had to get, the voice and 
physicality of it. The laugh was easy," he said, breaking into one of Herman's 
booming-yet-silly laughs. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett often gets requests to do the somewhat deranged Rev. Jim Ignatowski 
from "Taxi," an impression that helped him win on "Star Search." 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how many people remember that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In his current act, Garrett talks about being Jewish and dating a Christian 
girl: 
</P>
<P>
"She got me my first Christmas tree last year," he says in his act. "My mom 
came over and flipped out because I had a tree. . . . I wanted both sides of 
the family to be happy, so I set up a Jewish Nativity scene. It was nine 
attorneys overlooking a small auto accident."

AUDITORIUM'S RENOVATION IS DELAYED; 
</P>
<P>
REFURBISHMENT: HIGHER-THAN-BUDGETED BIDS FORCE RE-EVALUATION OF PLANS TO 
IMPROVE PLUMMER AUDITORIUM.

Renovation of the 60-year-old Plummer Auditorium will be delayed by about a 
year because of cost problems, city officials have said, causing aggravation 
for some performing arts groups and presenters that rent North County's most 
widely used concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
The auditorium was to be closed for refurbishment from July, 1991, through 
mid-1992, Fullerton officials said last spring. 
</P>
<P>
But the project had to be re-evaluated when construction bids of more than $2 
million exceeded the $1.3 million budgeted. Now work probably will not begin 
until the summer of 1992, said Terry Galvin, manager for Fullerton's 
Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"That's this week's estimate," said Galvin, adding that he and other 
redevelopment personnel have been meeting with officials of the Fullerton Union 
High School District, owner of the 1,300-seat auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to analyze where we might be able to scale down the project or 
see if there's the possibility of getting additional funds from somewhere," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for a discount on rent for 90 days annually for 10 years, the 
Redevelopment Agency has agreed to pay for renovation of the auditorium, which 
needs air conditioning, an orchestra pit, more public restrooms, an updated 
sound system and other improvements, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
The renovation delay means money out of the pocket of the Fullerton Civic Light 
Opera, which annually presents three musical comedies at Plummer, CLO general 
manager Griff Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
"The theater doesn't have many amenities and certain equipment, so I have to 
absorb extra expenses that in a class-A theater I wouldn't have to incur," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The delay hurts attendance too, Duncan said. Without air conditioning, "people 
who have been there on a very hot night just don't come back," he said.

FOOD IN RUSSIAN SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An extraordinary congress of the Russian republic's Parliament this week will 
debate a set of resolutions, including one allowing private land ownership, 
which the republic's president, Boris N. Yeltsin, says could have as dramatic 
an effect as the law that freed the serfs 129 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The session, meant to address the growing food problem in the largest of the 
Soviet Union's 15 constituent republics, will also put more pressure on Soviet 
Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and his council of ministers, whom Yeltsin 
accuses of making matters "worse by the day." He says private land ownership 
will increase farm output.

BRIEFING PAPER;

<P>
BUSH'S LATIN TOUR: TALKS ON AID, DEBT AND UNITY; 
</P>
<P>
THE NEWS: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush will be emphasizing his interest in Western Hemisphere unity 
with a five-day South American tour scheduled to begin Monday and to include 
stops in Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
The trip will take place in an international context that has evolved markedly 
in the last few years. Overriding U.S. concerns in Latin America are no longer 
fear of Marxist revolution or uneasiness with harsh military rule. Democracy 
has become predominant in the region, and Washington now faces little 
competition for influence from Moscow or Havana. At the same time, South 
American governments are less worried these days about warding off "Yankee 
imperialism" than about increasing exports to the United States and attracting 
American investment. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his South American colleagues will discuss a wide range of world 
issues such as the Persian Gulf crisis, the decline of communism, and difficult 
world trade negotiations that will be going on in Geneva the same week. But 
inter-American issues, such as Bush's Enterprise for the Americas initiative 
and the problem of Latin American debt, will get the most attention. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regional Issues: 
</P>
<P>
Bush's Enterprise for the Americas proposal last June to create a hemispheric 
free-trade zone, ease Latin America's debt burden and promote U.S. investment 
in the region has the grandiose goal of uniting the hemisphere's countries in a 
vast "economic partnership" for development and prosperity. Chile and the 
United States have reached an initial "framework agreement" aimed at bilateral 
free trade, and discussions have begun on a similar deal to promote free trade 
between the United States and a regional common market planned by Brazil, 
Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
Those four countries have set Jan. 1, 1994, as the deadline for eliminating all 
tariff and trade barriers among them. If successful, they will create the first 
fully functional common market in Latin American history. But some U.S. 
officials worry that deeply ingrained protectionism in Argentina and Brazil, as 
well as chronic economic instability and inflation, may retard efforts for free 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South American presidents will want more details from Bush on 
what his Administration is prepared to contribute, as well as an indication of 
how intensely and rapidly Washington intends to pursue the initiative's goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Reinforcement of U.S. commitment to development in South America, new 
stimulus for restructuring South American economies, and more hemispheric trade 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 The countries Bush will visit owe a total of more than $230 billion to foreign 
creditors. Brazil and Argentina will be seeking Bush's support in their 
negotiations with banks for easier repayment terms, arguing that easier terms 
are in everyone's interest because they allow the economic development that 
eventually will regenerate capacity for repayment. 
</P>
<P>
Bush may be sympathetic with the South Americans, but he cannot forget the 
interests of stockholders in American banks that are losing money on delinquent 
foreign loans. 
</P>
<P>
The Enterprise for the Americas plan includes relief on much of the $12 billion 
owed by Latin American countries to the U.S. government, but the amounts are 
relatively small for the countries Bush will be visiting. And while Bush can 
urge debtor countries and private banks to seek mutually beneficial 
accommodations, experience shows that there are no easy solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Little direct impact on foreign debt problems, but perhaps better 
understanding on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the regional issues, there will be bilateral questions on the 
agenda in each country: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brazil 
</P>
<P>
Bush will spend Monday in Brazil, the most populous (150 million people) and 
economically powerful country in Latin America, albeit one currently in a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
Because boosting exports to the United States is an important part of Brazilian 
growth strategy, President Fernando Collor de Mello may complain to Bush about 
what Brazil considers protectionist American regulations and bureaucratic 
procedures that restrict the entry of many agricultural and manufactured 
products from Brazil. Bush, in turn, could urge Collor to move ahead with his 
plans for reducing import taxes and other barriers against imports. Generally, 
however, trade relations between the two countries are greatly improved since 
Collor took office in March. 
</P>
<P>
Collor also may ask Bush to help persuade suspicious members of the U.S. 
Congress that there is no risk in permitting Brazil to buy the high technology 
needed for development. Washington has been cautious about authorizing the sale 
to Brazil of technology that could be used in missiles or nuclear bombs, even 
though Collor has vowed that his government will not build the bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Bush probably will mention the importance given by the United States to the 
protection of "intellectual property" such as pharmaceutical patents and 
software copyrights. Violations by Brazil have been a problem in the past, but 
Collor's policy favors patent protection. He may ask for patience on 
pharmaceuticals, however, because it will take time to wean the Brazilian 
industry from pirated formulas. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Improvement in already excellent U.S.-Brazil relations, with progress 
toward resolving some bilateral differences, and increased U.S. recognition of 
Brazil's international importance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uruguay 
</P>
<P>
Bush will give a strong symbolic boost to democracy in Uruguay, a nation of 3 
million people. Luis Alberto Lacalle, who took office in March, is the second 
elected president to govern Uruguay since the armed forces gave up power in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
Few Latin American countries have more to gain than Uruguay from the free-trade 
policies pushed by Bush. The Uruguayan economy is heavily dependent on its 
larger neighbors, Brazil and Argentina, and the main markets for its 
agricultural exports are the United States and Europe. The same day Bush 
announced his Enterprise for the Americas plan, Lacalle telephoned him to 
express full support. 
</P>
<P>
Lacalle may voice some concern to Bush over U.S. subsidies for farm products 
that compete with Uruguayan exports, but greater attention is likely to be 
given to their common position in favor of lowering agricultural subsidies 
worldwide under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The European 
Community has been resisting drastic cuts in its subsidies in the current stage 
of GATT negotiations, called the Uruguay Round, which began in 1986 at the 
Uruguayan resort of Punta del Este. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Full cooperation and strengthened relations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Argentina 
</P>
<P>
Bush will be in Argentina, population 32 million, on Dec. 5. U.S.-Argentine 
relations are said by Argentine diplomats to be the warmest since before World 
War II, as indicated by President Carlos Saul Menem's decision to send two 
warships to the Persian Gulf in a display of solid alignment with U.S. policy 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Menem will avoid confrontation with Bush, but there are points of friction. For 
example, the Argentines object to U.S. duties, quotas and other restrictions on 
such Argentine exports as meat, steel, textiles and leather clothing. As a 
major grain exporter, Argentina also quietly complains of unfair competition 
from subsidized American grain exports. Menem may tactfully suggest to Bush 
that the United States should practice the free-trade ideas that it preaches, 
while reiterating his administration's commitment to lowering Argentine import 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: A historical high point in U.S.-Argentine relations, and progress on 
bilateral trade problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chile 
</P>
<P>
Bush's visit to Chile on Dec. 6 will symbolize a welcoming U.S. embrace for 
that country of 13 million following its return to the hemisphere's family of 
democratic countries. President Patricio Aylwin, who took office when dictator 
Augusto Pinochet stepped down in March, is eager to resolve U.S.-Chilean 
conflicts left over from the Pinochet era. 
</P>
<P>
Chile wants the United States to end a ban on the sale of military equipment 
and parts to the Chilean armed forces. The ban was imposed by Congress in 1976 
after a car bomb in Washington killed former Chilean Ambassador Orlando 
Letelier and his American assistant, Ronni Moffitt. The United States wants 
extradition of Chilean officers charged in the case or progress toward bringing 
them to justice in Chile. 
</P>
<P>
Aylwin will argue that his administration's efforts to resolve the matter 
justify lifting the military sales ban. 
</P>
<P>
Aylwin also wants the United States to give Chilean products the same exemption 
from some import duties that it gives other Latin American countries under the 
international General System of Preferences. The latest reason given by the 
United States for excluding Chile was infringement on American pharmaceutical 
patents by Chilean laboratories. Chilean officials hope Bush can be persuaded 
that a recently enacted Chilean law protecting patents satisfies conditions for 
granting the exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
Chile also is concerned about U.S. tariff sanctions against such Chilean 
exports as flowers, tomatoes and textiles that U.S. producers claim are 
subsidized and therefore compete unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
The Aylwin administration hopes that by helping to resolve those and other 
problems, Bush will demonstrate concrete support for democratic government in 
Chile, bolstering it against criticism by the right-wing opposition and army 
officers who were happier with Pinochet as president. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Progress may fall short of Chilean government expectations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Venezuela 
</P>
<P>
On his way back to Washington, Bush will spend the night of Dec. 7 in 
Venezuela, where he will meet with President Carlos Andres Perez. 
</P>
<P>
During an earlier term in the 1970s, Perez often criticized U.S. policy in 
Latin America, siding with Cuban President Fidel Castro and Nicaragua's 
Sandinista revolutionaries. But now he seeks harmonious relations with 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas the old President Perez nationalized U.S. investments in Venezuela, a 
country of 18 million, now he is offering guarantees and favorable conditions 
to attract new foreign capital. Once he fostered government subsidies and state 
enterprise; now he is a free-marketeer. 
</P>
<P>
The new Perez administration, which took office in February, 1989, is preparing 
to sign an agreement with the United States for the protection of patent 
rights, and will renew a 1980 agreement on science and technology that was 
suspended because of disagreements between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
American officials were hoping Venezuela, the hemisphere's biggest oil 
exporter, would be ready to reach a framework free-trade agreement by the time 
Bush arrived. It's not, though apparently not because of any disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: More cooperation and trade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The President Goes South 
</P>
<P>
President Bush will visit Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, and Venezuela 
during a five-day tour scheduled to begin on Monday.

3-WAY BATTLE TO SUCCEED THATCHER PLAYED OUT ON EDITORIAL PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of Parliament (MPs) from Britain's Conservative Party vote today to 
choose a successor to Margaret Thatcher as party leader and, as a result, the 
country's prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates are Michael Heseltine, 57, the flamboyant and controversial 
former defense minister whose challenge to Thatcher led to the prime minister's 
resignation last week; Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, 60, considered the 
candidate of the party's center; and the relatively youthful Chancellor of the 
Exchequer John Major, 47, who is reportedly Thatcher's choice to succeed her. 
</P>
<P>
 All three men have their supporters in the British press, which has proven 
particularly sensitive to the personalities and class backgrounds of the 
candidates. A sampling of British editorial comment: 
</P>
<P>
 "In our own minds, there is no doubt that the first choice must be Mr. Douglas 
Hurd. The foreign secretary . . . is a politician of the highest intelligence, 
experience and integrity who has emerged during the past 14 months as a major 
national and international figure. . . . He offers by far the best chance of 
uniting Conservatives in the wake of this bitter and bruising leadership 
contest. Some doubts have been expressed about Mr. Hurd's patrician demeanor, 
his less obvious vote-winning qualities than those of Mr. Heseltine. We reject 
this argument. The government will be judged between now and the next general 
election by what it does rather than by how it looks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Hurd seems to us more substantial than Mr. Heseltine, more mature than Mr. 
Major, and ultimately more politically convincing than either. The Tory party 
will emerge . . . from what has been, frankly, a shoddy and unseemly crisis. 
Mr. Hurd offers by far the best opportunity of convincing the electorate that 
Conservative fortunes are in the hands of a convincing leader of proven 
judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Daily Telegraph 
</P>
<P>
"We . . . believe that Mr. Major would be the best man for the job at No. 10. 
He is the only candidate who has totally made his own way. No (private) school; 
no university. He has tasted life in a terraced house in a dreary suburb. He 
has even known unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
"At just 47, he belongs to a new generation of politicians. He himself is the 
product of the years when Mrs. Thatcher provided the opportunity for those of 
humble background to succeed without the benefit of privilege and connection. 
As a new millennium approaches, John Major is the man most likely to succeed. 
For himself and for the country." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Sun 
</P>
<P>
"Above all, Mr. Hurd lacks appeal among the very people essential to securing 
the Tories a fourth term: the skilled blue-collar and lower-middle-class 
voters. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The only significant reservation about Mr. Major is that he remains somewhat 
untried and untested . . . an unknown commodity under pressure, which makes him 
something of a risk as prime minister. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Except for a few die-hard Thatcherites with a grudge against him, Mr. 
Heseltine should have little problem in drawing a united party around his 
government, especially with the prospect of an election to concentrate 
fractious minds. 
</P>
<P>
"A Heseltine-Major-Hurd triumvirate is an attractive proposition for the Tories 
to offer voters, in whatever combination. But the guarantee of victory and 
progress on the issues that matter is best secured with Michael Heseltine as 
prime minister." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Sunday Times 
</P>
<P>
"The worry is that deep down Mr. Heseltine is not long on judgment and that he 
is short on what, in a commonplace way, may be described as political common 
sense. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The test must be one of crisis. If there were a gulf war, who should the Tory 
MPs -- and who would the nation -- most trust? Because he is so comparatively 
unknown, Mr. Major cannot pass the crisis test with flying colors. Mr. Hurd 
can. He has occupied two great offices of state with reasonable distinction. It 
is easy to mock his fuddy-duddy airs. He seems to some Tories to be a parody of 
the old Tory party which they have been fighting to replace. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But there is no evidence that Mr. Hurd suffers from the defeatist cast of 
thought which enveloped so many Tories from his kind of background in the 
postwar era." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Independent on Sunday 
</P>
<P>
"Douglas Hurd is a likable, respected ex-diplomat. But he has all the charisma 
of an amoeba. A privileged old Etonian is not the right choice to win back Tory 
voters in crucial northern marginal seats. 
</P>
<P>
"High on the charisma scale is Michael Heseltine. But can the Tories and the 
country unite behind an impetuous, mace-swinging Tarzan? . . . 
</P>
<P>
"As a woman leader, Mrs. Thatcher broke one mold. As a working-class hero, Tory 
Prime Minister John Major could break another." 
</P>
<P>
 -- News of the World 
</P>
<P>
"For the Tories, the real choice, it seems to us, is between playing safe with 
Hurd or taking a chance on Heseltine. 
</P>
<P>
"We urge them to gamble on Heseltine. He genuinely believes in closer 
integration with Europe, and he has the personality to shape it to our needs. 
He genuinely believes that the state has a role -- through selective 
intervention, through better-funded education and training programs -- to get 
our industries moving again. He has a genuine concern for the plight of our 
inner cities. He is a man to get things done." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Observer 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Farewell to the Iron Lady 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Britain's newspapers felt it was time for a change at the top; others 
didn't. Either way, their editorials reflected a sense of history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a shabby end to a unique career. Damaged by the economic disarray that 
resulted from her earlier disagreements with Mr. Nigel Lawson, stabbed by Sir 
Geoffrey Howe, so long a close political friend, bedeviled by her instinctive 
mistrust of her European partners, assaulted by the ambitions of Mr. Michael 
Heseltine and abandoned by the backbenchers she had put in Parliament, Mrs. 
Thatcher's political life expired. . . . Whatever the future may hold for the 
U.K., it is most unlikely to include a political figure so dominant, so 
determined and so decisive. The cliche is apposite: this is the end of an era. 
</P>
<P>
"Many will feel Mrs. Thatcher's departure was belated; more will regret its 
manner. But nothing can dim the glitter of her career. The first woman to lead 
one of the major Western nations, the longest continuously serving prime 
minister since the Earl of Liverpool, the tamer of the trade unions and the 
doughty fighter for Western values, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher cut a figure of far 
more than merely national significance. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Her flaws were as large as her virtues. She admires success, but is blind to 
the plight of the struggling. . . . She has rolled back the frontiers of the 
state while further centralizing political power; she could be supportive and 
loyal, but also overbearing and insensitive. Her virtues made her the 
formidable figure she is, but her flaws rendered her third term in office 
unhappy, unsure and, ultimately, disastrous." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Financial Times 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God for our decade of mighty Maggie. 
</P>
<P>

STALIN'S NUCLEAR TESTING MAY NOW THREATEN LENINGRAD;

<P>
THE SOVIET DICTATOR'S SCIENTISTS SCUTTLED A GERMAN MINELAYER FILLED WITH 
NUCLEAR WASTE IN NEARBY LAKE LADOGA. OFFICIALS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE 
RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION TO THE CITY'S WATER SUPPLY.

<P>
Three hours by boat from shore, in a top-secret zone of Lake Ladoga, rests a 
half-sunken ship that Soviet authorities say could one day pose a terrifying 
threat to this city and even to the Baltic Sea beyond. 
</P>
<P>
The vessel, a German minelayer from World War II, is filled with radioactive 
wastes from experiments ordered in the 1950s by the ruthless head of dictator 
Josef Stalin's secret police, Lavrenti V. Beria. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no evidence of contamination so far, the fear is that as the 
ship's hull rusts, there may be radioactive leaks into the lake, which supplies 
Leningrad's water system and also feeds into the Baltic. At 124 miles long and 
covering 6,835 square miles, Ladoga is Europe's largest body of fresh water. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot leave for our children and grandchildren these dark stains that our 
parents were forced to create," says Anatoly P. Sklyanin, chief of Leningrad's 
nuclear safety department. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that the military has a plan to lift the ship in the spring and 
dispose of its radioactive wastes elsewhere to avert the threat. But that 
revelation, which only came after a Leningrad reporter first published the 
story about the formerly secret ship last month, has raised other fears among 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Specialists agree the ship poses too great a threat to be left where it is. But 
at the same time, they are concerned that without extraordinary precautions, 
moving the ship from its resting place of more than 30 years could hasten its 
disintegration and start the spread of the radioactive materials. Sklyanin says 
even pieces of the ship's metalwork and flecks of paint are now "hot," as is 
the water that was pumped into its sealed compartments to flood and sink the 
vessel in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
After the Leningrad newspaper's report, civilian authorities demanded a role in 
the military's plan to lift the ship, arguing that the safety of the city and 
the Baltic environment were at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the specialists hope to pressure a still-reluctant military to reveal 
more information about the early Soviet nuclear program and the legacy it may 
have left behind. 
</P>
<P>
There could be hundreds more such secret nuclear waste caches around the 
country, says Alexander N. Penyagin, chairman of the subcommittee on nuclear 
ecology of the Supreme Soviet, or national legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not be surprised if we find more such barges, or spots where nuclear 
waste had been buried long ago and has poisoned underground waterways," 
Penyagin says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of that gigantic, inhumane regime of secrecy under Beria, which has 
huge consequences for us," he says. "Some of it can be explained by the excuse 
that they did not know what we know now about disposal of radioactive wastes. 
But in my opinion the main cause was that Beria, who headed the nuclear 
program, regarded people in a completely inhuman way." 
</P>
<P>
"This gives us a chance to draw attention to the problem so we can find other 
places where such hidden threats of radioactive pollution exist," Sklyanin 
says. "There is good reason to believe that some of the others could be more 
dangerous. What has been kept silent for more than 30 years, because of our 
society of secrecy, must be opened up." 
</P>
<P>
Penyagin and Sklyanin say they hope the Ladoga ship will be an example they can 
use to push the Parliament to approve laws that would force government agencies 
with information about nuclear waste deposits to reveal what they know. The 
secrecy that still surrounds most of the Soviet nuclear programs has made it 
very difficult for Penyagin's committee to search for trouble areas or chart 
the extent of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union does not have a law yet on when confidential material must be 
disclosed, the experts say, and some agencies, such as the KGB, the state 
security agency, are reluctant to inform the public of their past crimes. "The 
KGB archives are still closed," Penyagin says. "There are massive amounts of 
information to be found there." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the archives were opened, the specialists complain, many documents have 
been destroyed. Also, scientists who worked on the nuclear program have been 
obliged to remain silent about the work they did. "We need to remove the 
secrecy while there are still people alive who worked on these experiments and 
can direct us to the right locations," Sklyanin insists. 
</P>
<P>
The German ship, which the Soviet Union received as war reparations, was 
probably sunk just off one of Lake Ladoga's many islands, about 120 miles from 
Leningrad, by nuclear specialists who wanted to keep it secret and who did not 
foresee any problem with disposing of the waste in this way, Sklyanin 
speculates. 
</P>
<P>
 The vessel was most likely used as a laboratory to develop an antidote for the 
radioactive fallout that would threaten people in the case of a nuclear war, 
Sklyanin says. In the early 1950s, Stalin was afraid the United States would 
launch a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, Sklyanin and Penyagin say, and 
there was a frantic attempt by scientists here to develop an antidote for 
radiation poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
Their guesses about the ship's role cannot be confirmed because no documents 
have been found. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any documents, and the military specialists don't have any 
either," Sklyanin says. "By all indications, those documents are in a KGB safe 
at the direction of Beria." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet nuclear program was headed by Beria, whose position as the head of 
Stalin's secret police allowed him to hide virtually all its activities. Like 
most relics of early Soviet nuclear development, the existence of the ship and 
its contents were kept secret, even from specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Sklyanin, other civilian experts and the Leningrad journalist who broke the 
story have now been allowed to visit the site where the Ladoga ship was sunk 
and to consult on the operation. But Soviet military authorities refused to 
permit a Times correspondent to visit the remote area or to talk with the 
specialists directly at work on the project. 
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear what the military intends to do with the ship's nuclear 
wastes once it raises the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
"That ship was not the only place such experiments took place," Sklyanin says. 
"We already know some places in the Leningrad region where they performed 
experiments on animals. . . . But up until now we've always been told we don't 
have the right to investigate."

WHEN A LAKE SAVED A CITY

<TEXT>
<P>
Lake Ladoga may conceal a radioactive threat to Leningrad today, but there was 
a time when its frozen surface was the Road of Life for the city. 
</P>
<P>
That was during the World War II siege of Leningrad, when German forces cut off 
all land routes and left the city's 3 million residents with virtually no food 
or fuel. 
</P>
<P>
About 750,000 lives were lost, mostly from starvation. 
</P>
<P>
The bleakest time came in January, 1942, four months into the siege, when 
Leningraders were dropping dead in the frozen streets. But Red Army engineers 
were even then nearing completion of an ice road from Ladoga's eastern shore to 
the starving city. The 50-mile throughway, dubbed the Road of Life, was finally 
completed on Feb. 10, 1942, and what had been a trickle of supplies reaching 
Leningrad became a steady stream of flour, sugar, American canned meats, 
medical supplies, gasoline and ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of winter, a reputed 360,000 tons of supplies had crossed the frozen 
lake, and the famine began to ease. Thousands of Leningraders evacuated the 
city by the same route. 
</P>
<P>
But while the worst was over, the siege itself continued until January, 1944, 
lasting a horrendous 900 days.

<P>
A Los Alamitos fisherman and two crew members were rescued in the choppy waters 
off Santa Rosa Island last night after the hull of their fishing boat split and 
the vessel sank, the U.S. Coast Guard said today. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos resident Joseph Luz, the skipper of the 54-foot San Pedro Boy, 
radioed for help at about 5:15 p.m. Monday after the boat began taking on 
water, Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class Brenda Toledo said. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody was injured, Toledo said. The crew was airlifted to the Santa Barbara 
Municipal Airport at 9:22 p.m. and released. 
</P>
<P>
Toledo said that the three crew members were located by a Coast Guard jet at 
6:50 p.m. and that a helicopter dispatched from the guard's San Francisco base 
picked the survivors up a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
One of the survivors was in the water when they were spotted. He was aided by a 
Coast Guard rescuer, who was lowered from the helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Toledo said that it was not immediately known why the hull split but that the 
boat, which sank about 60 miles west of the Channel Islands, was tossed about 
in 15-foot swells and 40-knot winds shortly before it went down.

John Major, who was endorsed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as her 
successor and heir, was elected today as leader of the Conservative Party and 
will become prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Major fell two votes short of the needed majority, but his opponents conceded 
defeat and Conservative Party officials declared him elected. 
</P>
<P>
Aides said Thatcher is "thrilled." Major, 47, her chancellor of the Exchequer, 
is the youngest person to be elected Britain's prime minister since the 19th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very exciting thing to become leader of the Conservative Party, and 
particularly exciting, I think, to follow one of the most remarkable leaders 
the Conservative Party has ever had," Major said. 
</P>
<P>
He called Thatcher "a very great prime minister indeed." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher has made no public comment on what she will do next. She could 
continue to represent Finchley in the House of Commons, enter the House of 
Lords, write her memoirs or enter business. 
</P>
<P>
"Our job now I think is quite clear. We are going to unite totally and 
absolutely and we're going to win the next general election," said Major, who 
emerged smiling from his residence at 11 Downing St. 
</P>
<P>
Major won 185 votes, former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine had 131 votes 
and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had 56 votes in a secret ballot election 
among Tory members of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
"I congratulate John Major and thank him for a first-class campaign, fought 
without rancor or bitterness, which I believe lays the basis for the unity of 
our party," Heseltine said moments after the vote was announced. 
</P>
<P>
Hurd also quickly conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes, Cranley Onslow, chairman of the Conservative Party committee 
that supervised the election, announced that another ballot was not required 
and that Major was elected. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher left her residence at 10 Downing Street to congratulate Major, who as 
chancellor of the Exchequer is her next-door neighbor at No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth II will send for Major and ask him to form a Cabinet after 
Thatcher has handed in her seals of office at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Major was elected to Parliament in 1979, was appointed foreign secretary and 
then chancellor of the Exchequer last year. 
</P>
<P>
He attracted support from prominent figures on the right wing of the 
Conservative Party, although his friends insisted that Major's own views are 
more liberal than many supposed. 
</P>
<P>
He described himself as conservative on economic issues but liberal on social 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Major epitomized the self-reliant, hard-working achiever whom Thatcher 
encouraged. Born March 29, 1943, the son of a circus performer, he left school 
at 16 and was a laborer and at one time a welfare recipient. 
</P>
<P>
Major became a banker and a Conservative Party activist and was elected to 
Parliament in the first Thatcher victory of 1979. He was appointed to a junior 
ministerial post in 1985, then to the No. 2 position at the Exchequer in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He emerged as a possible heir-apparent when Thatcher appointed him foreign 
secretary in July, 1989, and then chancellor of the Exchequer three months 
later.

inspectors last week, the IAEA said no change had taken place in the status of 
nuclear material under agency safeguards since a previous inspection in April.

Sen. Sam Nunn today questioned whether it is really in the vital interest of 
the United States to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi invaders, while a former CIA 
director said it may take a year for sanctions against Iraq to be effective. 
</P>
<P>
As his Armed Services Committee opened hearings on the Persian Gulf crisis, 
Nunn (D-Ga.) said President Bush's decision to send 200,000 more troops to the 
gulf signals a fundamental shift in policy that raises a number of serious 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it in our vital interest to liberate Kuwait? How long can we sustain more 
than 400,000 troops? Has President Bush limited his options by creating a 
use-it-or-lose-it situation?" Nunn, the committee chairman, asked at the start 
of hearings prompted by Bush's decision earlier this month to send more troops 
to the region and build an "offensive military option" with a force that will 
total about 430,000 by January. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-CIA Director James R. Schlesinger, meanwhile, told the panel the government 
has concluded it will take about a year for international sanctions against 
Iraq to take full effect. 
</P>
<P>
Schlesinger said that was "an official estimate" that panel members would hear 
more about later, perhaps in a closed-door intelligence briefing later today. 
</P>
<P>
"A year, to me, seems to be in the right ballpark," Schlesinger said in 
response to questions. That will be time enough "to drain off the cash that is 
now sustaining the smuggling operations that bring in food," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Iraqi) economy will be in severe difficulty in 10 months to a year's 
time," he said. But it may take somewhat longer for those difficulties to lead 
President Saddam Hussein to change his mind and withdraw from Kuwait, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schlesinger, who also is a former defense secretary, said he believed the 
economic sanctions could have their desired effect. 
</P>
<P>
Several committee members said they believed Bush should give the embargo time 
to work before deciding to use military force to bring about an Iraqi 
withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn indicated his support for a possible U.N. resolution authorizing military 
force against Iraq unless Hussein's troops leave Kuwait. The Security Council 
is expected to act on the measure this week. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "this is not a substitute for fully informing the American 
people."

Self-funded employee health care plans, which cover about 9.5 million working 
Americans, are not subject to state insurance laws and regulations, the Supreme 
Court ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
The court, by a 7-1 vote, said in the case of a seriously injured Pennsylvania 
teen-age girl that federal regulation of such plans preempts any state 
regulation. Self-funded plans have benefits paid directly by an employer and 
not purchased through an independent insurance company.

President Bush today said the United States and Mexico are "one family," united 
in their goal to break down trade barriers and in their opposition to Iraq's 
aggression in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"The size and sophistication of U.S.-Mexico trade today only hints at our 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
We can create and share unprecedented prosperity and jobs," Bush said, 
referring to the free-trade pact that both governments want to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, joining Bush in speaking at the 
Monterrey City Theater, emphasized that Mexican migrant workers make a positive 
contribution to the U.S. economy and the United States has a "moral and 
juridical obligation" to respect their human and labor rights. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, on the second day of his visit, focused primarily on the two countries' 
efforts to negotiate a free trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, the President met with a group of U.S. and Mexican business 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he met for a second straight day with Salinas before they addressed the 
Monterrey City Theater audience. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's schedule also called for a meeting with another group of Mexican and 
U.S. businessmen and more bilateral talks on issues such as drugs, the 
environment and economic matters. 
</P>
<P>
Bush praised Mexico's cooperation in the U.S.-led opposition to Iraq and also 
for its stepped-up oil production that has helped cover the loss of oil from 
Iraq and Kuwait due to a United Nations-imposed embargo.

Three Americans, waving Iraqi flags and criticizing the U.S. government, 
arrived in Jordan today after being freed by Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
The freed Americans, whose families had traveled to Iraq to plead with Hussein 
for their release, told reporters at the Amman airport that the Bush 
Administration had ignored their plight. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not released with help from my government," said John Stevenson of 
Panama City, Fla. "It was my family who did it." 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Jesse, of Buffalo Grove, Ill., suggested the United States should 
negotiate with Hussein. "I believe it is time we started talking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The other freed American was Fred Harrington of Bellevue, Wash. Ten Britons and 
five Germans were released as well. The women in the British group carried 
flowers; the Americans waved the U.S. and Iraqi flags. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, Hussein said an undisclosed number of Americans will be allowed to 
leave the country with former boxing champion Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, talking on Baghdad television, said: "We will not let Haji Muhammad 
Ali return without taking with him a number of Americans who would be allowed 
to leave." 
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations, the Security Council today heard stories of murder, 
rape, torture and looting as a parade of Kuwaiti exiles gave evidence of 
atrocities they said had been carried out by Iraqi troops since the Aug. 2 
invasion of their country. 
</P>
<P>
Their accounts were interspersed with the showing of videotapes depicting 
injuries and damage said to have been caused by the Iraqis, as well as tapes of 
demonstrations by Kuwaitis protesting the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Ambassador Mohammed Abulhasan, who prepared the presentation, said the 
intimidation, humiliation and organized pillaging "recalls to mind the era of 
pirates and wars of the primitive ages."

Tokyo wins the dubious distinction as the world's most expensive city, closely 
followed by the Japanese city of Osaka, according to a study released today. 
</P>
<P>
Two African capitals, Libreville in Gabon and Brazzaville in the Congo, earned 
the next highest rankings in the cost-of-living index compiled by the 
Geneva-based Corporate Resources Group, a private consulting group. 
</P>
<P>
Six European cities -- Oslo, Helsinki, Zurich, Geneva, Stockholm and Copenhagen 
-- ranked in the top 10 most costly. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted during the first week of September, used costs in New 
York as a base of 100 and converted all foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. 
</P>
<P>
With its score of 170, Tokyo ranked 70% more expensive than New York. Los 
Angeles scored 95, and San Francisco 93.

The European Community Commission asked Procter &amp; Gamble Co. of the United 
States and Italy's Finaf SpA today to suspend a plan to cooperate on making 
diapers and other personal hygienic products. 
</P>
<P>
The companies said in September they planned to create joint ventures in Italy, 
Spain and Portugal for their paper products businesses, notably diapers and 
sanitary napkins. 
</P>
<P>
Procter said it would buy all Finaf's activities in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The commission asked the companies to hold off until it is satisfied "there is 
no breach" of EC fair competition rules. 
</P>
<P>
A commission official said the accord could create or strengthen dominant 
positions by the two companies and said it had received a complaint about the 
planned venture from Peau Douce SA, a French diaper maker.

GATT Director General Arthur Dunkel, declaring that world trade talks are in 
crisis, called today for compromises to be reached early in a final ministerial 
meeting in Brussels next week. 
</P>
<P>
The Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade wound up four 
years of work in Geneva late Monday by agreeing on a package of draft texts and 
comments to send to the ministers, but large gaps remain. 
</P>
<P>
"The round is in a crisis, and the negotiators have to get out of this crisis 
in the first hours and days in Brussels," Dunkel told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Dunkel said differences were so great that negotiators were unable to agree to 
include texts on three areas in the 391-page package draft -- agriculture, 
anti-dumping measures and trade-distorting conditions on foreign investment.

Britain's Allied-Lyons PLC, a diversified food and drinks conglomerate, said 
today its profit climbed 10% in the six months ended Sept. 15, helped by 
special items and results of newly acquired Dunkin Donuts. 
</P>
<P>
The maker of Beefeaters Gin said its pretax profit rose to $569 million from 
$512 million as sales edged up to $4.98 billion from $4.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The pretax figure included a substantial gain of $47 million for property 
sales. Allied said its two major acquisitions of the last year, James Burrough 
spirits and Dunkin Donuts coffee shops, had performed fully up to expectations, 
even though they added sharply to interest costs.

The Wimbledon tennis tournament made a record profit of nearly $19 million this 
year despite a significant drop in attendance and expensive construction work. 
</P>
<P>
The Lawn Tennis Assn. said today the profit was a 4.5% increase from the 
previous record, set last year. 
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon officials had said earlier this year that they were expecting a drop 
in profits because safety regulations led to nearly 56,000 fewer spectators 
this summer than in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance also was down this year because of competition from televised games 
of soccer's World Cup, in which the English team reached the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
But Wimbledon chief executive Chris Gorringe said an increase in ticket prices 
and a lucrative satellite television contract helped account for the record 
profit in 1990.

Purdue Coach Gene Keady will lead the U.S. basketball team in the 1991 Pan 
American Games in Cuba, officials announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation of Keady by USA Basketball, the national governing body, 
still must be approved by the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Keady, 54, called his selection the "second-highest honor in coaching next to 
the Olympics." He said he is excited about the challenge and noted that the 
U.S. team is "going to feel the heat because we haven't won a gold medal 
recently." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team lost to Brazil in the 1987 Pan American Games in Indianapolis and 
also lost the gold medal in the last Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
Keady, entering his 11th season as Purdue's coach, has amassed a record of 
215-93 at the school. 
</P>
<P>
He said he expects tryouts for the Pan Am team to be conducted in April or 
early May in Colorado Springs, Colo.

HOLYFIELD WINS ROUND VERSUS WBC IN COURT

World Boxing Council cannot strip heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield of his 
title for fighting former champion George Foreman, a judge ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the WBC's own bylaws, Superior Court Judge Amos Saunders said it would 
be unsportsmanlike conduct for the organization to strip Holyfield of his title 
because it was tantamount to taking the side of former champion Mike Tyson in 
the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield knocked out James (Buster) Douglas in Las Vegas last month to take 
the title. He signed a contract to defend the title against former champion 
George Foreman on April 19. 
</P>
<P>
The WBC wanted Holyfield to defend against Tyson, and had threatened to strip 
Holyfield of his WBC title if he fought Foreman first. 
</P>
<P>
At one point the WBC, the World Boxing Assn. and International Boxing 
Federation declared that the winner of Holyfield-Douglas fight must defend the 
title against Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
But the WBA and IBF switched course and sanctioned the Foreman-Holyfield fight. 
</P>
<P>
Both the WBA and the IBF have said that if Holyfield wins in April, he would 
have to then fight the No. 1 contender, who is certain to be Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
The WBC did not send lawyers to argue its case. 
</P>
<P>
In an affidavit included in the 27-page brief, Holyfield said, "If the WBC 
follows through with its threat to strip me of the title I won fairly in the 
ring, it would be of grave injury to me for which there can be no fair 
compensation."

WORLD CUP SKIING CHAMPION TAMARA MCKINNEY, 28, RETIRES

Tamara McKinney, winner of more World Cup Alpine ski races than any other 
American, announced her retirement today from competitive racing. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney, 28, a 13-year veteran of the U.S. Ski Team, will become official 
spokesperson for Jimmie Heuga's Mazda Ski Express, a charity ski series which 
raises money to fight multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
Her retirement was not unexpected. Injuries have dogged McKinney for the past 
three seasons. She suffered a broken left leg and cartilage damage to her left 
knee in a fall during giant-slalom training in Switzerland Oct. 18, 1989, 
missing the entire World Cup season that year. Her slow recovery figured to 
keep her sidelined again this season. 
</P>
<P>
But McKinney, who also missed most of the 1987-88 season with a broken left 
ankle, said the latest injury wasn't a factor in her decision. "Even before 
that injury I had decided that last year would be my final season," she said at 
a press conference. " . . . It's time to move on." 
</P>
<P>
McKinney won 18 World Cup races, more than any other U.S. skier. She competed 
in three Olympics and won gold and bronze medals in the 1989 World 
Championships in Vail, Colo.

HIGHER LEVEL OF TEAMWORK MAKES THE DIFFERENCE FOR UCLA IN WINNING THE ALASKA

The days of selfish basketball are over for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's the way it looked in the frozen north, where the 12th-ranked 
Bruins won the Great Alaska Shootout on Monday night with an impressive 89-74 
victory over No. 16 Virginia. (Story, C1.) 
</P>
<P>
"We're more together this year and it shows," UCLA's Tracy Murray said. "We hit 
the open guy for layups and set picks for each other. We were setting phantom 
picks last year." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he said, "We were a lot more selfish. We just went one-on-one 
whenever things broke down. That hurt us a lot." 
</P>
<P>
What's made the difference? 
</P>
<P>
"Camaraderie, hanging around each other, and blood, sweat and tears," Murray 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins used depth, defense and Don MacLean to win the Shootout. They never 
really had a close game. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick said the Bruins are much better than they were last season, when they 
were 22-11 and made it to the regional semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got more depth, and I think we have more firepower and I think we're 
better defensively than we've been in the past," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Depth and defense were the weapons that beat Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"The bench was just the key factor all three games," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
He praised especially Keith Owens, the 6-7 shot-blocking senior, and Shon 
Tarver, the smooth-shooting freshman who changed his mind about attending UNLV 
after the Rebels were placed on NCAA probation. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually our team improved, it seemed to me, when they came in the game," 
Harrick said. " Owens had five blocked shots against the Cavaliers and 15 in 
the Bruins' three victories in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
The last two teams to win the Great Alaska Shootout went on to great seasons. 
Seton Hall won it in 1988 and went on to finish second in the NCAA tournament. 
Michigan State won last year and made it to the final eight. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has the same kind of potential, Virginia Coach Jeff Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got a chance to be among the nation's best," he said. "What they do 
with that is what the season's about."

IOWA FINDS SILVER LINING IN ROSE BOWL MATCHUP;

FOOTBALL: COACH FRY IS RELIEVED THAT WASHINGTON, WHICH RANKS AS THE BETTER 
TEAM, ALSO WILL BE ON UNFAMILIAR TERRITORY.

<P>
Washington is ranked nine spots higher than Iowa, has a better record than the 
Hawkeyes and more speed. 
</P>
<P>
But the two Rose Bowl participants are on equal footing in at least one regard. 
Both will be visitors to Pasadena, giving Iowa Coach Hayden Fry some measure of 
solace. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly better for us than playing UCLA again, which plays all its 
games in the Rose Bowl," Fry said. "It would be a road game for Washington in 
that sense. Other than a couple of games, we've done pretty well the last 
couple of years on the road." 
</P>
<P>
Iowa lost to UCLA in the 1986 Rose Bowl, 45-28. Fry and the Hawkeyes also have 
a score to settle with Washington, which embarrassed Iowa in the 1982 Rose 
Bowl, 28-0. 
</P>
<P>
Fry claims to remember little of the 1982 game, saying he was in a daze because 
he was ill and under heavy medication. 
</P>
<P>
Don James is in his 16th season as Washington's coach, the longest tenure in 
the Pac-10. Fry, in his 12th year at Iowa, is the senior coach in the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa, ranked 18th, is going to the Rose Bowl after finishing in a four-way tie 
for first in the Big Ten at 6-2. The Hawkeyes (8-3) earned the trip because 
they beat the three other first-place teams -- Michigan, Michigan State and 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
No. 9 Washington (9-2) won the Pac-10 title outright, losing only to UCLA in 
conference play. The Huskies' other loss was to No. 1-ranked Colorado. Iowa has 
lost to No. 3 Miami, No. 25 Ohio State and Minnesota. 
</P>

"I haven't had a lot of opportunity to study Washington, but I'm sure they're 
one of the top teams in the nation," Fry said. "I do know about their won-loss 
record and how they dominated a lot of people. 
</P>
<P>
"Their defense has been unbelievable. They kind of run that old 46 defense that 
Buddy Ryan had at Chicago. They just come up to the line of scrimmage and dare 
you to run against them." 
</P>
<P>
The running game has been Iowa's strength this year. Led by 255-pound tailback 
Nick Bell, the Hawkeyes set school records with 2,560 yards rushing and 34 
rushing touchdowns. Bell has run for 945 yards and scored 10 touchdowns.

MICHEAL RICHARDSON DRAWS SUSPENSION FOR ITALY BRAWL;

<P>
The Italian basketball federation today suspended former NBA guard Micheal Ray 
Richardson for five games for instigating a brawl leading to a record 19 
ejections. 
</P>
<P>
Three other players, Americans Clemon Johnson and Frank Johnson and Italian 
Stefano Rusconi, were each suspended for two games for their part in Sunday's 
fight, which occurred during the closing minutes of Ranger Varese's 91-73 
victory over Knorr Bologna. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, who plays for Knorr, started the melee by punching Rusconi of 
Ranger. Frank Johnson of Ranger and Clemon Johnson of Knorr joined in, while 
other players, coaches and assistants rushed onto the floor. 
</P>
<P>
After riot police restored calm, referees ejected 12 players and seven team 
officials. Knorr was left with only three players to finish the game. 
</P>
<P>
The disciplinary committee of the Rome-based federation said Richardson was 
suspended for punching Rusconi in the eye, triggering a brawl and repeatedly 
trying to hit Frank Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a black page for basketball, maybe the worst I've seen in my 40 years 
in the sport," said Cesare Rubini, an official of the Italian national team. 
</P>
<P>
The brawl was the latest controversy involving Richardson, who played eight 
years in the NBA with the New York Knicks and New Jersey Nets before being 
banned from the league in 1986 for drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson's right to play in the NBA was restored in 1988 but he has been 
playing in Italy for three years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Richardson was suspended for two games for fighting and last year drew 
a one-game penalty for another skirmish. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, 35, caused a sensation last week when he threatened to break his 
contract with Knorr and join the Philadelphia 76ers of the NBA.

AXL ROSE URGES A TEST OF TRUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Singer Axl Rose today challenged a West Hollywood neighbor he allegedly hit 
with an empty wine bottle to take a lie detector test about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are expected to decide Thursday whether to try Rose, the lead 
singer of the rock 'n' roll band Guns 'N Roses, on felony charges stemming from 
the Oct. 30 incident. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released today by Geffen Records, Rose's record label, the 
singer said he passed a polygraph test when telling his version of his 
confrontation with Gabriela Kantor, 37, and that "my truth rating was so high 
there wasn't room for doubt." 
</P>
<P>
Now Rose is offering Kantor, whom he describes as an obsessed fan, the chance 
to take a similar test at his expense. 
</P>
<P>
Rose was arrested and jailed for four hours before posting $5,000 bail after 
Kantor told sheriff's deputies he confronted her outside his condominium. 
</P>
<P>
Kantor said she knocked on Rose's door and when he came out "he was in one of 
those crazy moods and he attacked me." She alleged Rose threw her keys off a 
12th-floor balcony, grabbed a wine bottle from her, emptied it and then struck 
her with it. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, 28, denies the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"I never touched her with a wine bottle or anything else," Rose said. "I only 
asked her to stop making so much noise in the hallway because my wife had been 
ill and was sleeping. Kantor was banging incessantly and hysterically on my 
door -- which still has the marks to prove it -- and threatened me!"

LIZ SMITH: 'RECLUSIVE' REDFORD WILL GET 'REAL' IN TV SPECIAL DEC. 9 
</P>

ROBERT REDFORD, so often described as "elusive, "reclusive" and "intensely 
private," will finally lift that veil of secrecy -- a bit -- and reveal a side 
of him never caught on camera before. 
</P>
<P>
Producers Mark Cowen and Paul Hall are putting the final touches on a TV 
special for NBC, set to air Dec. 9 at 8 p.m. This will focus on the "real" 
Robert Redford and also his working relationship with Sydney Pollack. The 
seventh Redford/Pollack movie collaboration, "Havana," opens, not so 
coincidentally, on Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Redford has apparently decided to let his vast public finally "meet" him. And 
to that end he sat for several candid, wide-ranging interviews with Cowen and 
Hall. The two producers obtained rare film and early TV clips of Redford, 
including some blooper-type material that shows Redford's seldom seen funny 
side. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Universal, who have screened portions of the upcoming special are 
happy and convinced that it will add not only to Redford's already vast legion 
of fans, but also to the box-office of "Havana," too. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, yes, Redford will escort his leading lady, Lena Olin, to the premiere of 
"Havana" in New York. "Please don't read anything into that," my source said. 
"They are just both in town at the same time and they are starring in the movie 
together. It's just convenient. OK?" OK. 
</P>
<P>
WAIT TILL you see it!! I'm talking about the eagerly awaited Fox TV special 
"Marilyn: Something's Got to Give." Finally Marilyn's fans will view some of 
the fabulous footage from her last, aborted film. And they will be stunned! Not 
just by her beauty and the superb quality of her performing, but with the 
inside story of what led up to 20th Century Fox's firing MM, denouncing her to 
the press and suing her, before her death in August, 1962. (And, eventually, 
quietly rehiring her at twice her salary. She was set to resume filming in 
September.)

ABC IS NO. 1 FOR 1ST TIME THIS SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: FOOTBALL, VIDEOS AND 'IT' HELP THE NETWORK KNOCK NBC FROM THE TOP 
SLOT.

A monster, a football game and some home videos helped put ABC on top of the 
ratings race for the first time this season as Thanksgiving week again proved 
to be a turkey for NBC, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The top-rated show of the week was CBS' "60 Minutes," which had its highest 
rating of the season, but coming in second was Part 2 of "Stephen King's 'It' " 
on ABC, followed by Monday night football and the two "America's Funniest . . . 
" shows, all on ABC. It was the highest-rated multiple-part program of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The week was NBC's third loss this season; CBS took opening week and World 
Series week. While NBC came in second for the week and CBS was third, CBS and 
ABC each had four shows in the top 10, compared with only two for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason was the seasonal slump for Thanksgiving, which every year 
shows that Americans would rather eat than watch television. Even NBC's 
Thursday night lineup can't keep the couch potatoes away from the candied yams. 
</P>
<P>
When they did tune in, they were slightly more likely to vote for "The 
Simpsons" on Fox than for "The Cosby Show" on NBC. "Simpsons" tied with "The 
Trials of Rosie O'Neill" (CBS) for 37th place while "Cosby" was in 39th. 
"Simpsons" had an 11.9 rating and a 24 share, while "Cosby" had an 11.6 rating 
and a 23 share. 
</P>
<P>
Another head-to-head contest among new shows was neck and neck: "Fresh Prince 
of Bel Air" on NBC was in 25th place, while "Evening Shade" on CBS tied for 
27th. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC margin for the week was substantial, with the network boasting a 13.4 
rating and a 23 share. NBC had an 11.8 rating and a 20 share, while CBS had an 
11.3 rating and a 19 share. ABC noted that was the widest gap between first and 
second place this season, except for World Series week, which CBS won handily 
thanks to four games in one seven-night stretch. 
</P>
<P>
In the tight 10-week-old season-to-date statistics, NBC holds onto its lead 
with a 13.2 rating and 22 share, while ABC has moved into second with a 12.7 
rating and a 21 share. CBS is only a tenth of a ratings point behind, with a 
12.6 rating and a 21 share. 
</P>
<P>
With the November sweeps almost over, NBC leads, with ABC second and CBS third. 
</P>
<P>
Each ratings point represents about 921,000 households. A share is the 
percentage of TV sets in use that are tuned to a particular show or network. 
</P>

Stacy Arthur, who posed nude for the January centerfold of Playboy magazine, 
says the photographs have caused problems with her fellow contestants in the 
Mrs. America Pageant. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the other girls are very upset about it. I have gotten a lot of flak," 
Arthur said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"But the pageant system is not going to stop me from competing. They are going 
to let me compete. They say it would not hinder my odds (or) my chances of 
winning," said Arthur, who was crowned Mrs. Ohio June 17. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur, 22, and her husband, James, live in Sidney, about 30 miles north of 
Dayton, and run a ceramics shop there.
