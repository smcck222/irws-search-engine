JUDGE OPPOSES THE MERGER OF SCE, SDG&amp;E 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal law judge Tuesday recommended that the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission prohibit Southern California Edison from merging with San Diego Gas 
&amp; Electric because the combination would stifle utility competition, 
generate few benefits for utility customers and further degrade Southern 
California air quality. 
</P>
<P>
Merger opponents greeted the 125-page report as further proof that federal and 
state regulators should prohibit the controversial merger that would create the 
nation's largest electric utility, with 4.8 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, a strident opponent of the planned merger, 
said Tuesday that the utilities designed the merger to benefit "SCE, the 
corporation, and SCE shareholders. . . . there's not any benefit for the 
citizens of San Diego, rates would go up and environmental quality would go 
down. . . . It's what we've been saying all along." 
</P>
<P>
But utility executives predicted that the federal commission's five members 
will ignore many of the law judge's objections and issue a favorable, final 
decision on the merger early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners have the option of rejecting or accepting all or part of the 
report written by George P. Lewnes, the administrative law judge, after he 
conducted the FERC's merger hearings this past summer in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The federal merger review is one of two remaining hurdles for utility 
executives who proposed the merger in late 1988. FERC approval is necessary 
because two utilities own a substantial number of the interstate transmission 
lines, and the commission is responsible for determining whether antitrust laws 
would be violated. 
</P>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission is also conducting a review that is 
now scheduled to be completed early in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lewnes' report focused largely on antitrust concerns, it also faulted 
the utilities for failing to prove that the merger would generate cost savings 
needed to provide "substantial net benefits" for consumers in the form of lower 
electric rates. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how the FERC could overturn this decision," said Michael Shames, 
executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network, a San Diego-based 
consumer group that has opposed the merger since it was first suggested in 
1988. "This decision is so strongly worded and is so strenuous in its 
objections that it, for all intents and purposes, kills the merger." 
</P>
<P>
But SDG&amp;E Vice President Lee Haney said commissioners might ignore the more 
negative portions of Lewnes' report. In 1988, Haney said, commissioners 
rejected an equally bleak recommendation from Lewnes when they unanimously 
approved Portland-based Pacific Power &amp; Light's now-completed merger with 
Utah Power &amp; Light. 
</P>
<P>
Lewnes' negative recommendation was "not unexpected," said Edison spokesman 
Lewis Phelps, who maintained that Lewnes is known to believe that "larger 
utilities are by definition anti-competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Shames maintained that commissioners will be hard-pressed to ignore Lewnes' 
arguments in the review of the Edison-SDG&amp;E merger. 
</P>
<P>
"The regulatory environment is different in the 90s than it was during the 
1980s," Shames said. "I don't think you'll see the same Edison having the same 
kind of success in lobbying Washington, D.C. regulators that Pacific Power 
&amp; Light had." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor called for FERC members to "listen to the facts. . . . Not only is the 
FERC law judge saying it's a bad deal, the PUC staff is saying it's bad. Edison 
hasn't won one ruling based on the facts. They're sitting back and waiting 
until they get to the politicians." 
</P>
<P>
An attorney who is familiar with FERC proceedings Tuesday said that 
commissioners can -- and do -- toss administrative law judges' recommendations 
aside if they feel the reports incorrectly represent testimony taken during 
hearings. "That's what they did with Pacific Power, and they could do it again 
here," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Phelps said that Lewnes' recommendation ignored Edison's contention that the 
merger will generate $1.7 billion in cost savings that would be passed through 
to utility customers. Haney said that Lewnes also ignored an agreement that the 
utilities have reached with the Department of Justice that would eliminate 
possible antitrust concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The FERC recommendation prompted a mixed reaction on Wall Street. SCEcorp, 
Edison's Rosemead-based parent company, closed up $.125 at $38.25 on New York 
Stock Exchange trading while SDG&amp;E closed down $2 at $43.25. 
</P>
<P>
Edward J. Tirello Jr. a New York-based utility industry analyst with Smithy 
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., said Tuesday that Lewnes' recommendation was 
"no surprise . . . because he hates" utility mergers. 
</P>
<P>
"Lewnes was overruled (by the FERC) in Pacific Power, and that's exactly what's 
going to happen here," Tirello said. "Lewnes also ignored the fact that the 
merger has the support of FERC staff members and the Department of Justice." 
</P>
<P>
Both the FERC and PUC regulatory reviews were conducted by administrative law 
judges, who are supposed to act as impartial observers of both fact and law. 
PUC and FERC staff members have also reviewed the mergers and made 
recommendations that the law judges are free to accept or reject. Similarly, 
the commissioners have the right to reject or accept reports offered by staff 
members and law judges. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Miles, a Washington-based attorney who represents the city of San Diego 
in the FERC's review, described Lewnes' recommendation as "a major finding. 
We're obviously gratified by the decision, which reaches the appropriate and 
correct finding . . . that the merger should be killed." 
</P>
<P>
Tirello, the New York-based utility industry analyst, on Tuesday predicted that 
the state PUC will issue a final decision that is favorable to the utilities. 
"The PUC is a pretty level-headed group," Tirello said. "I think they're going 
to issue a (positive) decision." 
</P>
<P>
In a related development Tuesday, state PUC Chairman G. Mitchell Wilk for the 
first time acknowledged that the PUC's long-running merger review won't be 
completed by the end of December. Wilk, in a prepared statement linked the 
delay to the thousands and thousands of pages of evidence that must be 
reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Wilk's admission that the merger review won't be completed by year's end raised 
the question of whether the merger review should be determined by the current 
PUC or by the PUC that will exist after Gov.-elect Pete Wilson replaces two 
commissioners whose terms expire Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor on Tuesday suggested that Wilson appoint two new commissioners, 
including "hopefully, one from San Diego" because the two commissioners whose 
terms will expire on Dec. 31 seem likely to approve the merger. "Southern 
California Edison has been steam-rolling this from the beginning," O'Connor 
said. "They know how the system works, and they've got big, deep pockets." 
</P>
<P>
California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp on Tuesday described the FERC 
recommendation as "a major step toward preserving competition, and the 
potential for lower utility bills and a cleaner California environment." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, during state and federal reviews, has described the merger as 
"contrary to antitrust laws."

UCLA EXTENSION REACHES OUT TO LATINOS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE UNIVERSITY IS OFFERING COURSES DESIGNED TO LURE PROSPECTIVE 
STUDENTS. ONLY 3% OF THE CONTINUING EDUCATION PROGRAM'S 100,000 STUDENTS ARE 
HISPANIC.

<P>
UCLA Extension, the university's vast continuing-education arm, has long drawn 
its enrollment from its surrounding Westside population. 
</P>
<P>
But changing demographics that point to an increasing Latino population in the 
Los Angeles Basin have prompted extension officials to reach across town to the 
East Side to maintain a steady enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to look at what we are offering for the Latino population in terms of 
career advancement and just plain interests," said Patricia Mendoza, a former 
special assistant in the UCLA Office of Student Affairs who now heads the 
extension's Latino outreach program. 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza said she believes that there are two big reasons for the low Latino 
enrollment: the Westside location of the campus and poor promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the Latino community to know that although we are not located in an 
area that is traditionally Latino, we are sensitive to Latino concerns," she 
said. "We know that that is one of the reasons that a lot of people are not 
familiar with what UCLA Extension offers." 
</P>
<P>
About one-third of the region's population is Latino, but Latinos make up only 
about 3% of the more than 100,000 students who enroll annually in UCLA 
Extension courses, according to extension officials. Maintaining a steady 
enrollment is important because UCLA Extension does not receive any state aid 
and is supported almost exclusively by class fees. 
</P>
<P>
Although some classes are offered in downtown Los Angeles and other satellite 
locations, Mendoza said the challenge will be to attract more Latinos to the 
Westwood campus, because the bulk of the classes in certified programs will be 
offered there. 
</P>
<P>
She hopes to do that by offering more Latino-oriented classes, such as the 
eight-week course "Chicano Culture in America," which was offered in the fall 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"The course cuts across different disciplines," Mendoza said. "We wanted to 
make it attractive for teachers, as well as for Latinos to have an opportunity 
to learn more about themselves. Also, because of the changing demography, 
non-Latinos might also have an interest in their Latino neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
For the winter quarter, which begins Jan. 7, UCLA Extension will be offering an 
advertising and marketing course on reaching the Latino market. 
</P>
<P>
Extension officials hope to make the cost of attending extension courses easier 
by broadening a minority community outreach scholarship program -- Scholarships 
to Encourage Extension Diversity -- to include Latinos.

MORNING BRIEFING: BLUE DEVILS JUST LOOKED LIKE THE DEVIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Central Connecticut State Blue Devils lost to St. John's last 
Saturday, they looked horrible. 
</P>
<P>
They looked so bad, in fact, that Coach Mike Brown said the team plans to file 
a civil lawsuit for breach of promise against Russell Corp., the Alabama-based 
sportswear company. He said Russell made an oral commitment last summer to 
deliver Central Connecticut State's game uniforms before the 1990 season began. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't arrive, and the team wore practice uniforms in its first two games, 
including a 135-92 loss to St. John's on regional television. 
</P>
<P>
Said Brown: "It is just not right. We are trying to build a credible program, 
and I am ripped that we come to New York and play on TV and we look like a 
bunch of ragamuffins." 
</P>
<P>
Add ragamuffins: The Blue Devils don't know how much longer their thrift-shop 
look will last, because when Russell called to say the outfits would be late, 
the company set no new delivery date. 
</P>
<P>
Said Brown: "The kids came to me and asked what kind of recourse they had 
against the company. Dennis Murphy, our captain, had the idea for the lawsuit 
and the kids are serious about it. This is not just a lark, this is for real." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Which two teams played the only doubleheader in NFL history? 
</P>
<P>
A little too gamy: Steve Hellyer, the University of Oregon's sports information 
director, was in Anaheim last week to prepare for his football team's visit to 
the Freedom Bowl, where it plays Colorado State Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
While dining at the restaurant where the Oregon team dinner will be held, 
Hellyer made one request: "Would you please remove 'Grilled Duck' from the 
menu?" 
</P>
<P>
Dialing for Dawgs: Former USC linebacker Marcus Cotton, recently waived by the 
Atlanta Falcons and picked up by the Cleveland Browns, told Ed Meyer of the 
Akron Beacon-Journal why he has two phones in his Mercedes 750 SL. 
</P>
<P>
Said Cotton: "I'm a businessman as well as a football player. One's a business 
phone. One's a pleasure phone." 
</P>
<P>
Noting Cotton was fined 11 times in Atlanta, Meyer wrote: "The Browns were able 
to acquire Cotton . . . because, according to the word from Falcon Coach Jerry 
Glanville, the bill on the pleasure phone was too high." 
</P>
<P>
Aptly named: From Phil Jackman of the Baltimore Evening Sun: "Maryland vs. 
Louisiana Tech in the Poulan-Weed Eater Independence Bowl Dec. 15, come on! It 
extends the season a month, falls during exams when the school is making large 
noises about academic upgrading and further reduces the players to simple 
chattels to be used for the purpose of making a few bucks." 
</P>
<P>
Add Jackman: "Meanwhile, a team like Temple goes from a 1-10 season to 7-4, 
seemingly is deserving of a reward (no one plays the game for the game itself 
these days) and is blanked. Obviously, there are not enough bowls with 'just' 
19." 
</P>
<P>
Bite, ball, bite!: South African golfer Butch Kruger had a good round going in 
the central Orange Free State trials, until a mongoose-like animal grabbed his 
ball with its mouth and dropped down its hole. 
</P>
<P>
Kruger wrote on his card: "Meerkat." 
</P>
<P>
Ben de Wet, assistant curator of the Bloemfontein Zoo, erased all doubt when he 
told Reuters: "A meerkat could pick up a golf ball with its teeth." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Pirates played two 
exhibition games on Aug. 25, 1939. The first game ended in a 7-7 tie, and the 
Packers won the nightcap, 17-0.

<P>
Those streaking Lakers hope to extend one string and break another tonight 
against San Antonio. They have won four consecutive games and failed to sell 
out the Forum seven consecutive times. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Boston Celtics' new offense is the run-and-win. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Portland has the best record in the NBA but doesn't have a scorer or rebounder 
in the top 10. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Those disappointed by Michael Jordan's unspectacular performance against the 
Clippers at the Sports Arena Friday should be aware that he was suffering from 
the flu. That's also why the Denver Nuggets held him to 38 points the next 
night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Remember the Clippers' famous draft class of 1987? None of the first-rounders 
are on their active roster today. Ken Norman is injured, Reggie Williams is 
with San Antonio and Joe Wolf is with Denver. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In beating Virginia, UCLA looked improved from last season's sweet-16 team 
because of a tighter defense and a more disciplined offense. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Keith Owens could be the Bruins' first genuine shot blocker in quite a while. .

</P>
<P>
Hold off the induction of Indiana freshman Damon Bailey into the Hall of Fame. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
USC freshman Lisa Leslie didn't dunk, but scored 30 points in her debut against 
Texas. At 6 feet 5, she can dominate the women's game in the manner of a 
seven-footer in the men's game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
From Coach George Raveling, who is on the last year of his contract with USC: 
"Like Tommy Heinsohn once said, if you listen to the people in the stands, 
pretty soon you'll be up there with them." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Every year, the three-point line in college basketball seems closer to the 
hoop. . . .

Among the most important numbers the winner of the Los Angeles Athletic Club 
John Wooden Award must have is a cumulative grade-point average of at least 
2.0. . . .

Those fines levied against the New England Patriots in the Lisa Olson case were 
worth the long wait. . . .

Is every NFL game refereed by Jerry Markbreit, Jerry Seeman or Jim Tunney?. . .

The Rams have won 16 of 20 games from the 49ers in San Francisco since the 
rivalry shifted from Kezar Stadium to Candlestick Park in 1971. . . .

What do Mike Lansford and Milli Vanilli have in common? . . . 
</P>
<P>
It was refreshing to see two coaches, Houston's Jack Pardee and Buffalo's Marv 
Levy, shake hands after a game as though they really meant it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Warren Moon excites me like no other quarterback in the AFC. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Quietly enjoying a good season is Buffalo's James Lofton, who is catching 
passes and carrying defenders on his back. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia, which already has a great pass rush, put a claim in on Dexter 
Manley. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh offensive coordinator Joe Walton, who took so many knocks early in 
the season, deserves to take a bow or two. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The same network, ABC, has the best pro football announcer -- Al Michaels -- 
and the best college football announcer -- Keith Jackson. . . .

When Notre Dame beat USC, 10-6, the first time in 1940, all the points were 
scored by fullbacks. Milt Piepul had a touchdown, a field goal and an extra 
point for the Irish, and Bob Peoples had a touchdown for the Trojans. It was 
the last game ever coached by USC's Howard Jones. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This is the kind of year it has been in college football: Miami whipped 
Syracuse, 33-7, and was dropped from second to third behind idle Georgia Tech 
in the Associated Press poll. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It made a lot of fiscal sense for Virginia to lose to Georgia Tech. Instead of 
representing the Atlantic Coast Conference in the Citrus Bowl, the Cavaliers 
will make more than twice as much money in the Sugar Bowl. . . .

Of the 106 players listed in the Notre Dame football media guide, only six hail

Palisades and Gardena high schools continued their dominance in girls' tennis 
by winning City Section championships Tuesday at the Racquet Centre in North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Palisades won its seventh consecutive 4-A title by defeating Taft, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena won its third consecutive 3-A title and fifth in the last seven years, 
defeating South Gate, 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
Palisades cruised behind straight-set singles victories by Torrey Miller, Karen 
Manson, Sirsa Shekim and Birdie Gessford, all of whom are ranked among the top 
five in the City. 
</P>
<P>
Taft's Stephanie Fontaine and Pam Klosterman, the No. 2-ranked doubles team in 
the City, defeated top-ranked Yael Allswang and Karly Lemen, 7-6 (9-7), 7-5, 
for Taft's only point. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like having the second-best hand in poker," Taft Coach Marvin Jones said, 
referring to his team's inability to beat Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
Gardena had a tougher time with South Gate, which took an early lead when 
freshman Aide Orejel defeated Mindy Watanabe, 6-1, 6-3, in the No. 1 singles 
match. 
</P>
<P>
Four of Gardena's five points, including all three doubles victories, were 
achieved in three sets. 
</P>
<P>
The City Section individual singles and doubles championships will begin 
Thursday at the Racquet Centre.

GULLS' FOUR-GAME STREAK SKIDS TO A HALT IN ALBANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last-place Albany brought the Gulls' string of four victories to a halt Tuesday 
night with a 5-2 International Hockey League victory at Knickerbocker Arena. 
The Gulls fell to 7-3-1 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the 19th time in 24 games the Gulls have allowed the first goal. This 
time, the scoring was opened by Nicholas Beaulieu, who got his ninth goal of 
the season at 8:10. Teammate Mike Golden, who ended up with a hat trick, scored 
his first goal of the year at 14:20 for the 2-0 lead, then scored again in the 
second at 4:12. 
</P>
<P>
Clark Donatelli pulled the Gulls (12-10-2) to 3-1, scoring his ninth goal on 
the power play at 8:20, with assists by Derek Mayer and Brent Sapergia. It was 
the Gulls' 36th power-play goal of the season, a league-leading total. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't as sharp as we have been lately," Coach Mike O'Connell said. "But 
that happens sometimes on the road." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Holland took a feeder from Charlie Simmer to record his ninth goal at 
14:15 in the second and pull the Gulls to 3-2. It was as close as they would 
get. 
</P>
<P>
The Choppers (7-14-3) scored twice in the third, at 18:30 on a goal by Yeves 
Heroux, then with 50 seconds left, Golden got his third goal of the night -- 
and the season -- to close the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Goalie Alain Chevrier stopped 15 of 20 shots and the Gulls outshot Albany

WILDLIFE PANEL TRIES TACKLING BIG PICTURE

<TEXT>
<P>
The time has come, some deep environmental thinkers have concluded, to stop 
criticizing the Department of Fish and Game and start figuring out ways to save 
the state's wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
That was the tenor of the second annual Natural Diversity Forum conducted in 
Los Angeles Monday by State Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose), chairman of the 
California Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really easy to bash (Fish and Game)," said Deborah Jensen, a researcher 
for UC Berkeley's Energy and Resources Group. "But they're stuck between a rock 
and a hard place." 
</P>
<P>
The rock: Legislative mandates for an increasing load of environmental work. 
</P>
<P>
The hard place: a lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
"None of us is capable of solving the problems individually," said DFG Deputy 
Director Paul Jensen, filling in for vacationing Director Pete Bontadelli. 
</P>
<P>
Said Deborah Jensen, no relation to Paul, "It should be broader than just Fish 
and Game." 
</P>
<P>
Most of those testifying agreed. Some thought that Governor-elect Pete Wilson 
should establish a new department in the Resources Agency to manage non-game 
wildlife, leaving Fish and Game -- the commission and the department -- to do 
what it was created to do: manage hunting and fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Spotts, state representative for the Defenders of Wildlife, suggested 
that Wilson ask all five commissioners to resign and remove the commission's 
authority for listing endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
Better, Mark Palmer of the Mountain Lion Preservation Foundation suggested, to 
have the DFG's expert biologists identify endangered habitats, and Frank Davis 
of UC Santa Barbara proposed managing those habitats instead of individual 
species. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Jensen agreed. "The solution is habitats of sufficient size that they 
provide built-in protection," he said. "If we continue to address just an 
animal at a time, one by one we're going to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Johnson of the California Nature Conservancy said: "The fragmentation of 
habitat and elimination of (connecting) corridors that are too small leads to 
extinction." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Bill Dempsey, also of the CNC, proposed borrowing Prop. 117 funds 
up front to buy habitat now, when land is less expensive and more available 
than it will be over the next 30 years. The proposition, passed in June, calls 
for spending $30 million a year for 30 years for habitat acquisition and, 
incidentally, bans the hunting of mountain lions. 
</P>
<P>
Did all of this fall on deaf ears? Since it was an interim hearing, between 
legislative sessions, only one other member of McCorquodale's committee was 
present: Robert Presley (D-Riverside). But the six others will get a full 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
LOCAL FISHING -- The transition from surface to bottom has for the most part 
been made, and fishermen are finding the deep holes and high spots at the outer 
banks and Channel Islands extremely productive. Big fish: a 42-pound lingcod 
taken by Ventura's Bob Oren aboard the Pacific Dawn out of Ventura 
Sportfishing. 
</P>
<P>
BAJA FISHING -- Fishing remains consistent for most species in the Cabo San 
Lucas area. "It's wide open for (striped marlin) and sailfish, some blue 
(marlin) and some wahoo, and real strong on dorado," said Lowanda Josephson of 
the Finistera Tortuga fleet. East Cape fishermen are finding dorado weighing 
between five and 25 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
LICENSES -- The Department of Fish and Game is pushing the holiday sales of 
sportfishing licenses for 1991, along with a reminder that being caught fishing 
without one will be costlier than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Under legislation approved this fall, anglers cited for fishing without a 
license next year face fines from $250 to $1,000. Current law puts the minimum 
fine at $100 and the maximum at $500. 
</P>
<P>
A resident general sportfishing license for 1991 costs $20.50 at DFG offices 
and $21.55 at licensing agents. 
</P>
<P>
HUNTING -- A desert bighorn sheep taken by Soudy Golbachi of Atlanta in the 
Eastern Mojave Desert is believed to be the second highest-scoring ram in 
California: 173 3/8 on the Boone &amp; Crockett scale. 
</P>
<P>
Golbachi bid $37,000 for the privilege of an exclusive hunt, before the five 
hunters drawn by lottery start their two-week hunt Saturday. All of the money 
goes to bighorn restoration projects. Golbachi and his guide, Floyd Krank, 
reported seeing "numerous mature rams." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of San Dimas Canyon are at odds with bow-hunters in the nearby 
Angeles National Forest, charging them with trespassing and threatening the 
citizens' safety. 
</P>
<P>
"I had one man come in my back yard with a stocking over his face, a net over 
the stocking and dressed in camouflage," Kathy Curtis told the Associated 
Press. "It was scary to see. He was crossing the yard looking for deer." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, John C. Scruggs, a DFG hunting safety instructor, said residents are 
harassing hunters, calling the San Dimas sheriff's substation several times a 
day. Hunters complain that residents are letting the air out of and slashing 
their tires, and setting booby traps along trails. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal laws prohibit hunting within 150 yards of a public area, but 
because of the drought, animals have wandered down to residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
POACHING -- Three hunters who were arrested more than a year ago by Nevada game 
wardens for the illegal killing of mule deer in that state, among them Randy 
Solmonsen, 32, of Yorba Linda, have been sentenced to 30 days in jail and must 
pay heavy court-assessed fines as part of a plea agreement approved by Elco 
District Court Judge Thomas Stringfield. 
</P>
<P>
Solmonsen and Utah resident Ronald B. Smith were arrested -- after an anonymous 
tip -- in possession of a six-point, 33-inch spread mule deer head and hide, 
minus the body. Kevin B. Frame, also from Utah, had left the scene and was 
later arrested. 
</P>
<P>
A four-point buck was also involved in the case but Utah and Nevada officials 
believe there were others involved in what appeared to be "a (poaching) case of 
major proportion." Two of the three were ordered to pay $1,500 for the services 
of a public defender, and $500 civil penalties for each deer killed. All three 
were placed on three years' probation, during which they are not allowed to 
possess firearms and are subject to searches of their homes, vehicles or 
persons at any time. They also lose all hunting and fishing privileges during 
the probation period. 
</P>
<P>
MISCELLANEOUS -- Volunteers are needed to lead walks for inner-city school 
children. Weekday volunteers will be trained in bird, plant and animal 
identification, geology and history of the Santa Monica Mountains. About 1,000 
children a month, from more than 150 schools, are scheduled for visits to the 
William O. Douglas Outdoor Classroom in Franklin Canyon. Details: (213) 
858-3834. . . . Fly reel manufacturing specialists Abel Automatics of Camarillo 
will have an open house Saturday, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. It's free, but reservations 
must be made by tonight at (818) 484-8789.

FISHING REPORT: IRVINE LAKE LUNKERS ABOUND AFTER PLANTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine Lake was stocked Tuesday with 5,500 pounds of trout, some topping 10 
pounds, and fishermen are having little trouble filling their stringers. 
</P>
<P>
Joey Watanah of Fountain Valley caught a 12 1/4-pound rainbow on a chrome 
Kastmaster. The heaviest stringer was 24 pounds 12 ounces by Simi Valley's Ken 
Ross.

PSYCHIATRIST NOT THE ANSWER

Coach Dan Henning was asked Tuesday if he has entertained the idea of hiring a 
team psychiatrist as the Dodgers have done. 
</P>
<P>
"You know I must have 75 letters since I've been here at San Diego and probably 
another 125 when I was at Atlanta," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People write in and tell you they have the answer. 
</P>
<P>
"I had one on my desk yesterday from a guy in Knoxville, Tenn., who said he can 
massage away all our ills. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were to give the card of that psychiatrist maybe I could have it 
printed up and sent to these 75 people that continually write to me and have 
the answers. The problem is they have all the answers, but they keep changing 
the questions." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers placed running back Joe Mickles on injured reserve and re-signed 
Tim Spencer, who was released during the exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer played with the Chargers for five seasons as a running back and was 
moved to H-back shortly before being cut. He will return to the running back 
position now and will be used as the upback in goal-line situations if injured 
linebacker Gary Plummer is unable to play. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said Marion Butts will continue to be the team's primary ball carrier, 
and should he be injured, the ball will be given to Ronnie Harmon next. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers released practice squad player linebacker Willie Joe Walker 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The team is presently carrying quarterback John Friesz, offensive lineman Dean 
Brown, defensive back Derrick Kelson and wide receiver Ron Heard on its 
five-man practice unit. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said linebacker Billy Ray Smith, who suffered a hyperextended elbow, 
will be available on a limited basis at best for the game against the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's backup, Henry Rolling, has been bothered by a hamstring injury. T.J.

SAN DIEGO COLLEGE NOTEBOOK;

<P>
AMITUANAI DOING HIS PART FOR PALOMAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the praise going to the Palomar College football team this year has 
centered around record-breaking quarterback Brett Salisbury. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar (6-4) plays Antelope Valley (8-2) in the annual Hall of Fame Bowl 1 
p.m. Saturday at Balboa Stadium, and Salisbury, a transfer from Brigham Young, 
has certainly been a major factor. He is the state's leading passer at 332 
yards per game and has established a pair of national records for completions 
(273) in a season and touchdowns (eight) in a game. 
</P>
<P>
But the Comet defense deserves some of the credit as well, and not many would 
deny that credit after a visit with defensive lineman Tamasi Amituanai. 
</P>
<P>
Amituanai is one of those guys that isn't quite sure of his weight, because 
there aren't many cattle scales around the Palomar campus. Just say he's 
heavier than 300 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
A highly recruited All-American from Vista High, where he was the San Diego 
Section defensive player of the year, Amituanai signed a letter of intent with 
Colorado. He never quite got untracked in Boulder, though. 
</P>
<P>
He was declared academically ineligible last year as a freshman for not meeting 
Proposition 48 requirements, but he could live with that. 
</P>
<P>
The illness and death last fall of his first cousin, Sal Aunese, was a bit 
harder on him. 
</P>
<P>
"(Sal) was the reason I went over there in the first place," Amituanai said. 
"After he died, everything kind of fell apart for me. The thought of Sal not 
being there really began to gnaw at me." 
</P>
<P>
Later, in February, a dormitory fighting incident led Colorado Coach Bill 
McCartney to suspend Amituanai for the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than sit out another year, Amituanai decided this summer to transfer to 
Palomar. 
</P>
<P>
And so far, he has been quite happy with the decision. He and Palomar have had 
fine seasons, and he expects more of the same next year with eight freshman 
defensive starters expected back. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't even bother him to look in the paper and see Colorado ranked No. 1 
and nipping at a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, he said, "I root for them every game." 
</P>
<P>
Another former San Diego player built like Capitol Hill is Lincoln Kennedy of 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, a Morse High graduate, is a 6-9, 310-pound offensive tackle for the 
Rose Bowl-bound Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
Did you know?: In the San Diego State men's basketball media guide, player's 
Division I statistics are listed below a brief biographical sketch. For 
first-year players, a graphic entitled "Did you know . . . " takes the place of 
the stats. 
</P>
<P>
Did you know the "Did you know . . . " graphics outnumber the stats graphics, 
9-5? 
</P>
<P>
One of the "Did you know . . . " graphics informs us that Tony Gwynn, a former 
Aztec point guard before he went on to terrorize National League pitchers, is 
the Aztecs' record holder for assists in a game (18), season (221) and career 
(590). 
</P>
<P>
What about Penzoil or Chico's Bail Bonds?: The Illawara Hawks of Australia's 
National Basketball League, in town last week for exhibition games against SDSU 
and USD, wore numerous advertising logos on their uniforms and warmup suits 
like a NASCAR driver or the players in the movie Bad News Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Examples: State Bank; Tile Power; BHP Steel; Cooper Tools; and Wollongong 
Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
Do as I did: Ben Foster, Point Loma Nazarene men's basketball coach who played 
for the Crusaders from 1964-68, is fourth on the schools' all-time scoring list 
and second on the all-time rebounding list. Foster, who stands about 6-feet-6, 
also holds the school mark for rebounds in a game with 33 during the 1965-66 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Add coaches' stats: Gus Magee, an assistant coach and former player (1966-70) 
at USD, holds the Toreros' records for rebounds in a career (948) and game (24) 
and is second in season rebounds (344). Randy Bennett, another USD assistant, 
is fifth on the UC San Diego career assist list with 216 in 52 games.

JACK SMITH: CRUSH OF FAMILY LEAVES THEORY OF RELATIVITY BEHIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I have suggested, an understanding of Einstein's theory of relativity is not 
available to most of us. 
</P>
<P>
I have read several brief explanations of it, and, like Omar Khayyam, "I came 
out by the same door where in I went." 
</P>
<P>
Being married to an engineer, Marguerite B. Robinson, of Kirkland, Washington, 
has been exposed to the theory, but decided to leave it to those who understand 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Some years ago, however, when the Robinsons lived in Los Angeles, she had an 
experience that gave her a clue to Einstein's vision of space/time. The 
Robinsons were visited, en masse, by relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Except when they are inundated by relatives, the Robinsons live a sane and 
orderly life. "At these times," she writes, "something happens. Even my dogs 
sense it and run through closed screen doors and dash madly toward some unseen, 
unknown time or place." 
</P>
<P>
It began with postcards from Mrs. Robinson's sister, Jean, hinting that she and 
her daughter, Mrs. Robinson's niece, Dona, and the niece's 5-year-old son, 
Justin, might come to the Robinsons' for a visit. Jean's husband would come 
later. "If it's not too much for you or anything," a postscript added. 
</P>
<P>
The day comes. "I empty the supermarket and mortgage the boat to stock up the 
liquor cabinet. I put some of the liquor inside me and get set. I'm ready for 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
On a Sunday morning, a call comes from the airport. Jean and Dona and Justin 
are there. Rob Robinson drives out to pick them up. "Los Angeles Airport at 
noon is worst than traffic at the Mardi Gras!" 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Robinson assumes that they would have eaten on the airplane. Her food is 
frozen. But they have come economy class, and are starved. "Well, good old 
McDonald's is only a few light blocks away -- no problem." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Robinsons' parents join them at McDonald's. When they returned to the 
house, the dogs "went into their ecstasy thing. Pandemonium prevailed. The kid 
decides he is a dog and removes his clothing and 'arfs' around on all fours 
biting ankles." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes time to prepare dinner (for 11 by now -- more relatives), Mrs. 
Robinson discovers that she has forgotten to thaw the roast. "Another trip to 
the market and 50 bucks disappears into shopping sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I return to the kitchen and start preparing dinner for 11 people. They all try 
to join me in the kitchen. Rob is pacing the floor and the back yard. He looks 
like a wild man. He is a wild man. He's into Martini No. 3 by 2 p.m. I wish I 
could join him. 
</P>
<P>
"At 6 p.m. dinner is on the table. Everyone is having a marvelous time, at 
least everyone is laughing, even myself. It is hardly noticeable that my own 
laughter is hysterical . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
At 4:45 a.m., the kid shakes her awake. Later the visitors decide to go to the 
beach. Mrs. Robinson declines. "I warned them of sunburn, sharks, riptides, and 
they were off." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Robinson's son and his wife are coming for dinner. Jean's husband, Don, is 
arriving. "I scrambled a big meat loaf together and scalloped some potatoes and 
made a huge salad and ran out for fresh fruit for dessert, another $15." 
</P>
<P>
The two women return from the beach badly sunburned. Mrs. Robinson's son and 
his wife arrive at dinner time. Jean's husband calls from the airport. "I gave 
a passing thought to the primal scream therapy." 
</P>
<P>
The sunburns turn worse. In the morning Jean goes to a dermatologist, who 
prescribes cold compresses. Mrs. Robinson tries to help. Meanwhile, Don and 
Dona and the kid decide to go to Marineland. They will eat lunch before they 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
"Off to the store again, more dollars. Cold compresses for Jean, cold gin for 
me. And again dinner is served, I know not how nor even when." 
</P>
<P>
Next day everybody goes to Disneyland. Jean isn't sure she can go. Don finds a 
motel near the park. They go to Disneyland at 3:30 p.m., and again the next 
day, all day. 
</P>
<P>
Another nephew calls. He's coming too. Don flies home. "I sure don't blame him. 
I would if I could." 
</P>
<P>
The gin isn't working. Mrs. Robinson thinks she is having a heart attack. Rob 
takes her to the hospital. A doctor gives her some tests and tells her she is 
OK. He advises, "No drinking, no smoking, plain food, and plenty of rest." 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't been here long. My own doctor was, of course, not on call. He has 
lived here about the same number of years that I have and understands 
relativity. 
</P>
<P>
"You see how easy it is to understand Einstein?" Mrs. Robinson concludes. "He 
left all of his relatives in Germany. I personally think he was a very nice 
man. And, I'd really have liked to tell him how I learned to understand his 
theory."

MIDEAST OIL AND U.S. TROOPS IN SAUDI ARABIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because the Middle East has most of the world's oil reserves, the region will 
be a problem until sufficient alternate fuels are developed to take the place 
of oil. Our government and the energy companies have known about this problem 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
As pointed out by President Carter in the late 1970s, the oil problem is the 
moral equivalent of war. Part of Carter's response to the oil shortage was to 
call for conservation and to initiate alternative-fuel research, although these 
measures were later canceled by the Reagan Administration. Now, a decade later, 
we realize that Carter was correct. The world's oil reserves will be gone 
within the first half of the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Who will control the final pool of oil in the Middle East while it is being 
depleted? This is a critical question, and its answer involves the reason why 
the United States reacted so quickly to the crisis. If Saddam Hussein were to 
be left unchecked, he could easily control the economic destiny of the entire 
world. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and the United Nations need to take this opportunity to create 
safeguards rather than obfuscate the issue with talk of war. Gulf oil is a 
permanent world problem that requires a permanent solution. We must spend money 
on the problem, but let us spend it for diplomacy, and a permanent and peaceful 
solution. One permanent solution could be, for example, to establish a U.N. 
presence headed by a coalition of Middle Eastern countries. Pay for peace, not 
war. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush must establish a clear energy policy for our country. While it 
is reprehensible that Hussein has taken over Kuwait, this does not threaten 
American security, as does the much larger potential threat to oil supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. President, you have a chance to lead the world into the next century with a 
long-term and peaceful solution to one of its major problems -- energy. You 
have a chance to break the historic chain of reaction and war.

<P>
There is much talk about car-pooling and rapid transit. These are certainly 
important considerations in the desire to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. 
</P>
<P>
But everyone cannot participate in these programs. There is, however, one way 
in which every driver can assist in reducing our dependence on foreign oil. I 
have made a personal effort to hold down my top speed by 5 miles per hour and 
to eliminate rapid acceleration and braking. With just this simple effort, I 
have improved my mileage from 28 to 30 miles per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
To the average driver, this may mean an additional driving time of five minutes 
each way. This is not much of a hardship to see our soldiers return from Arab 
lands and to put people like Hussein in his place.

GIVING WITH AN INDIVIDUAL TOUCH; 
</P>
<P>
UNITED WAY TRIES AN EXPERIMENT TO PERMIT DONORS THEIR CHOICE OF CHARITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Way of Orange County is trying a new plan that's been tried in just a 
few places around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
And United Ways in both Los Angeles and San Diego are studying the idea to see 
if it would provide adequate support to all their beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
The program, called "donor choice," allows contributors to designate their 
gifts in three ways: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The traditional method, in which funds are distributed among 21 areas of 
need serviced by Orange County's 118 United Way-affiliated service providers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Targeted issue" care, in which donors designate an area of particular 
concern, such as homelessness, disaster services, hunger or literacy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Specific care," in which donors designate contributions to specific 
agencies affiliated with United Way or to any eligible nonprofit organization 
in the United States. These gifts will be monitored to make sure they are used 
as intended. 
</P>
<P>
United Way executives in Orange County say they devised the new plan after 
hearing from donors that they wanted more control over which charities received 
the gifts and how the money was used. It hopes that the program will help in 
its pursuit of $22.5 million this year -- a 9% increase over the $20.9 million 
pledged a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County doesn't give as generously to United Way as some other areas. 
Some say it's because there aren't many corporate headquarters that conduct 
company-wide giving programs. Others say it's because the county's neediest 
people are not as visible as in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
While many United Ways allow donors to designate their donations, usually the 
money becomes part of the designated agency's overall allocation and doesn't 
change the total it receives. What makes Orange County's program different is 
that designated donations will be added to an agency's allocation for a given 
year. The program also allows donors to designate their money to nonprofit 
agencies outside United Way's traditional "family." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles and San Diego are concerned that some good causes that are not as 
popular, or that don't have means of promoting themselves, might suffer. That's 
a good point that should be evaluated as Orange County's program gets under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County experiment does respond to a feeling throughout the business 
community that people nowadays want more autonomy in decision-making. Thus, the 
creation of a stronger link between giver and receiver should foster 
generosity.

THERE THEY GO AGAIN, BLAMING FOREIGNERS; 
</P>
<P>
MCA DEAL SHOULD CAUSE SOUL-SEARCHING NOT HAND-WRINGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yet another big studio is being sold to foreign interests, unleashing fears 
about the loss of our cultural identity. But Americans who are howling about 
the purchase of MCA Inc. by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. would be wise to 
stop pointing fingers at those economically aggressive Japanese and take a look 
in the mirror. They're not likely to like what they see. 
</P>
<P>
For what America will see in the mirror is a society that has lived on the 
credit card for too long and let its savings dwindle to a pocketful of pennies. 
It will see a society that would rather curse the foreigners with all their 
money than take stock of why more and more American properties are being sold 
to the highest bidder, who more often than not lately is a foreign corporation. 
Look at yourself, America, and stop pointing fingers at others. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion for this necessary self-examination is Matsushita's record 
$6.59-billion purchase of MCA , whose Universal Pictures has brought us such 
movie gross-busters as "Jaws" and "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial." MCA's Universal 
Studios is a must on any tourist's visit to Southern California. MCA's other 
holdings include record labels and a publishing house. 
</P>
<P>
MCA also owns Yosemite Park &amp; Curry Co., which runs all concessions at 
Yosemite National Park (but that subsidiary will be spun off before the 
Matsushita deal is completed). 
</P>
<P>
Only a year ago Sony Corp., another giant Japanese electronics company, 
purchased Columbia Pictures. Now, four of the six big Hollywood studios are 
owned by foreigners. But the Matsushita deal has triggered rumblings about 
whether this company, which is less Americanized than Sony, will interfere with 
the content of books, records and movies. Funny, those questions did not 
immediately come up when Australians bought 20th Century Fox or when Italians 
purchased MGM/UA. The Matsushita-MCA deal must not make Japan a renewed target 
for bashing. 
</P>
<P>
The real issue is one of competitiveness -- and having an economic environment 
where U.S. companies can slug it out in the global economy. MCA, for example, 
set off in search of a buyer with deep pockets in order to secure capital for 
projects, new markets for products and access to the fast-changing technology 
of entertainment. It needed to become bigger to compete in what's becoming a 
truly global entertainment industry. No U.S. buyer surfaced, but MGM's new 
Italian owners may be waiting in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
So rather than be concerned about foreign investment, Americans should instead 
focus on getting our economic house in order. The budget deficit requires high 
interest rates to finance the debt. The U.S. savings rate is dismal. The go-go 
1980s was a decade of deal-making where too much money went into buying and 
breaking up companies for profit instead of building factories. Lawyers and 
deal-makers got rich while average Americans lost their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Now we are in jeopardy of having to follow a global economic agenda set by 
other countries. The Matsushita-MCA deal is a symptom of a deep problem. It 
should inspire us to fire up our cultural assets of enterprise, creativity, 
resourcefulness and hard work. That's what made America great before; that's 
what will make America great again.

CHOOSING THATCHERISM MINUS THATCHER; 
</P>
<P>
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER BECOMES THE YOUNGEST BRITISH PRIME MINISTER IN 
THIS CENTURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It probably won't be clear for some time whether the Conservative Party has 
chosen in John Major a truly worthy successor to Margaret Thatcher, who has 
been a giant on the world stage. The truth, which has been added to over each 
of her 11 1/2 years in power, is that they don't make many like her anymore. 
</P>
<P>
With the undoubted exception of Winston Churchill she has been her country's 
greatest prime minister of this century. No one did more to reorient and 
restore a troubled and even floundering nation than the shopkeeper's daughter 
who became Britain's first woman PM. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Iron Lady is gone from the front benches of the House of Commons but, 
judging from Tuesday's vote for Major, she is hardly forgotten. Of the three 
candidates for party leader, and so for PM, Major, the chancellor of the 
Exchequer, was politically closest to Thatcher and indeed had been publicly 
endorsed by her. Thus, Thatcher succeeded in thwarting the ambitious "Tarzan" 
-- former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine, whose bold challenge to her 
leadership set in motion the events that triggered her resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Major may not be a Thatcher clone, but there is no doubt he was the favored 
choice of the Tory right wing, and the one least likely to break dramatically 
from her policies. This means the Tories presently intend to confront the Labor 
Party in the next general election with the benefit of all that Thatcherism has 
meant, minus the sometimes abrasive personality of the lady herself. 
</P>
<P>
For the United States, this probably means a British foreign policy more or 
less to its continued likening, though Britain without Thatcher in the driver's 
seat could be less resistant to the European Community's glamorous lure. For 
John Major -- who, rare among Conservative Party leaders, never attended a 
university, and, indeed, dropped out of school at 16 -- and who once even stood 
in an unemployment line -- this is an extraordinary moment to be thrust so 
quickly into power. At 47, this son of a onetime circus performer becomes the 
youngest prime minister in this century. It is impossible not to wish a man 
well who came from these beginnings and now has achieved the pinnacle of 
British political power.

POLICE CHECK OF BODYBUILDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I can't support The Times' editorial "Case of Mistaken Identity" (Nov. 16), 
especially when you feel security officers should apologize for confronting two 
questionable-looking individuals who happen to be using a ladies restroom, but 
who just happened to be women themselves. Won't we admit that security 
personnel are trained to spot unconventional appearances/behavior to protect 
other women using the restroom, and if the two people the officers stopped just 
happened to be a team of men plotting a robbery or rape, the press would 
instead be praising the officers' caution. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California was able to see the women bodybuilders on TV news, and -- 
sorry ladies -- anybody would have stopped them near a ladies restroom! Society 
must be honest with itself. If we can expect sexist charges every time a woman 
is approached, we are in big trouble. Society didn't choose their appearance, 
and surely other women on the scene had to be grateful the two were checked 
out. Let's be honest; they might have been men bent on violence, and our wives 
and daughters might have been there. It's happened before -- but this time 
security said no.

The state is offering $28 million in low-interest loans for the rehabilitation 
and development of rural hotels and rental properties in California. The 
Department of Housing and Community Development said the funds were approved by 
the voters in 1988 and 1990 as Propositions 77, 84 and 107. The 20-year and 
30-year loans are being offered to commercial and nonprofit developers, owners 
of rental properties and local government agencies at a simple interest rate of 
3%.

A former legislative aide and a one-time lobbyist pleaded innocent to charges 
growing out of the FBI's investigation of state Capitol corruption. Tyrone 
Netters, 36, a former aide to Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), is 
charged with nine counts of racketeering, extortion, conspiracy, 
money-laundering and tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Freeman, 43, the former lobbyist, is named in two counts of conspiracy 
and extortion. U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton set a tentative trial date 
for the pair for June 4. During the elaborate three-year sting investigation, 
FBI agents posed as businessmen seeking legislative favors. Moore sponsored two 
bills that would have helped the phony businessmen, but prosecutors earlier 
announced that she will not be prosecuted. Netters is accused of taking money 
to help shepherd the bills through the Assembly. Freeman worked as a lobbyist 
for the FBI's bogus firm.

Republican state Sen. Rebecca Morgan has told Gov.-elect Pete Wilson that she 
is not interested in being appointed to his U.S. Senate seat, saying that she 
wants to stay in California. Morgan, of Los Altos Hills, said Wilson told her 
she was on his "short list" of possible candidates, but she asked that her name 
be removed.

"I am flattered to have been considered, but truly enjoy working in an arena 
where I can play a major role in shaping the educational and economic future of

ARAB PROTEST DISRUPTS ISRAELI TEAM'S VISIT

<P>
An Israeli basketball team walked off the court Monday in response to a noisy 
pro-Arab demonstration at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, university 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 Arab students and community residents waved Palestinian flags and 
shouted anti-Israel slogans during the protest, which started about a half-hour 
before the game and continued into its opening minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli team, Hapoel Hagalil Haelcon, was eight points ahead when it left 
the court after university officials would not eject the protesters, who were 
in the stands and had been following the Israelis from one end of the court to 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
"We came to play basketball, not argue politics," Israeli Coach Muli Katzurin 
told the Detroit News. 
</P>
<P>
University of Michigan-Dearborn basketball Coach Joe Zabrenski apologized to 
the team -- ranked among the top four Israeli college teams -- after the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
A university spokesman defended the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very well-behaved, they did not physically obstruct the game, nor 
break any school codes," spokesman Steve Wasko said of the students. 
</P>
<P>
A student leader, Mike Awad, who is Palestinian, told reporters that the 
protest was in support of 1.5 million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. 
The suburban Detroit community has one of the largest Arab populations outside 
the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The game was the seventh on the Israeli's team's Midwest tour and the first 
marked by protest.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: HART RUNNERS FOCUSED ON TITLE, NOT SPOTLIGHT

The Hart High boys' cross-country team was nowhere to be seen Friday afternoon 
in Fresno while top-ranked and undefeated Madera, the local favorite, was 
making a public appearance at Woodward Park before Saturday's state 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
A Fresno-based television station interviewed Madera Coach Dennis DeWitt and 
top runner Jose Santiago and taped the Coyotes during a pre-meet workout. Hart 
was neither in the picture nor in the park. 
</P>
<P>
"I made the mistake of getting (to Fresno) too late last year and felt rushed 
to get to where we were going," Hart Coach Gene Blankenship said. "So we got 
there about 11:30 or so and jogged the course, practiced sprints off the start 
and into the (finish) chute." 
</P>
<P>
Hart started rolling when the cameras stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having lost twice to Madera this season by margins of 35 and 65 points, 
the Indians handily defeated the nation's third-ranked team, 58-113, for their 
first state Division I title. 
</P>
<P>
"The announcer was making all this talk about Madera being the first 
non-Southern Section team to win the state (Division I) title and that sort of 
fired the team up," Blankenship said. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians placed five runners ahead of Madera's No. 2 runner. Hart's sixth 
runner, freshman Gavin Klinger, placed 45th in 16 minutes 28 seconds, finishing 
ahead of Santiago (48th in 16:30), Madera's fifth and final scorer. 
</P>
<P>
"It took everyone to race a good race and no one would give up," senior Billy 
Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon finished eighth in 15:48 to lead Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Chrome dome: Local cross-country coaches and runners might not recognize 
Blankenship after Friday. Hart will be honored Friday at a school rally at 
which the Indians will shave Blankenship's head. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an agreement with the kids that if we finished in the top three they 
could shave my head," Blankenship said. 
</P>
<P>
The event is not without precedent. When El Monte Arroyo won the state Division 
I title in 1987, a rally was held at the school and Knight runners shaved Coach 
Tim O'Rourke's head, beard and mustache. 
</P>
<P>
Marmonte madness: Marmonte League cross-country teams and individuals were 
about as prominent at the state championships Saturday as Florence Griffith 
Joyner's one-legged body suits. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Speck, a national authority on high school running with California Track 
&amp; Running News magazine, called the league the nation's most competitive. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind that the Marmonte League is the toughest all 
around for boys and girls," Speck said. "I can guarantee you that no league has 
three top girls like the ones in the Marmonte League." 
</P>
<P>
Three runners from the league won individual titles and another placed second. 
Five teams also finished among the top five in their respective divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura's Deena Drossin, Westlake's Jeannie Rothman and Newbury Park's Jeff 
Wilson captured Division I, II and III titles, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Drossin, the Ventura County and Marmonte League titlist, timed 17:29 in beating 
league-rival Veronica Barajas (17:44) of Channel Islands. Barajas, a junior, 
finished second to Drossin in the Southern Section Division I final. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman notched the fastest girls' time of the day at 17:28, one second off 
Drossin's state-meet record set last year. Rothman won the Southern Section 
Division II title and finished second to Drossin in the Ventura County and 
Marmonte League championships. 
</P>
<P>
A fierce Division III race was waged between Wilson, the Southern Section 
runner-up, and San Luis Obispo's James Menon, the section champion. The Newbury 
Park junior surged away from Menon with about 400 yards to go to win in 15:15, 
the third-fastest time of the day. Wilson was the Ventura County and Marmonte 
League champion. 
</P>
<P>
The Agoura girls' team concluded an undefeated season by winning the Division I 
title after finishing second to Palos Verdes the past three years. The Chargers 
are ranked second in the nation by The Harrier magazine. Mountain View of Orem, 
Utah, is ranked first. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands, a Marmonte League co-champion with Camarillo, tied for fourth 
with L. A. Belmont but the Sentinels were awarded fourth place outright by 
virtue of a faster sixth runner. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo finished second in the boys' Division II and rival Agoura was fourth. 
Westlake's girls' team finished third in the Division II final. 
</P>
<P>
Site dispute: The controversy over the site of Saturday's football semifinal 
between Canyon and Loyola has been solved, but the Cowboys are none too happy 
about the Southern Section's decision to move the game from Canyon High to 
College of the Canyons, which seats about 8,000. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon Coach Harry Welch, coaching in his first Division I playoff but in his 
eighth consecutive semifinal game, insists that Canyon's home field is suitable 
for the game. Loyola argued that Canyon's stands were insufficient to hold its 
large following. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon drew an overflow crowd of about 5,000 for its quarterfinal against 
Bishop Amat, which brought about 2,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bunch of bunk," Welch said. "Canyon High can host a first-class, 
Division I final game. We provide the little amenities: Our locker rooms are 
close to the field and we can take care of the working media. And the field at 
Canyon is far superior to most any in Southern California. I felt the players 
should come first."

Agoura 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Kevin Pasky, 4th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 14-9; 3rd in Frontier League, 6-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Only two starters, senior guard Sean Martin and junior 
forward Eddie Corridori, return for the Chargers. Martin, a 5-foot-11 senior, 
was a second-team Times All-Valley selection last season and averaged 21.6 
points a game. He is considered a Division II prospect by national scouting 
services. The only remaining Charger with varsity experience is senior forward 
Diego Edber (6-3), who played sparingly last season. Senior Dennis Fowler (6-1) 
likely will start beside Martin in the backcourt and junior Jon West (6-2) 
probably will start at the other forward position. The remaining starter could 
be sophomore forward-guard Jeff Niemann (6-3). Jeremy Fant, a 6-5 transfer from 
El Paso, Tex., sustained a broken ankle in September and likely will not play 
until January. Agoura is deep with senior forward Jeff Feinman (6-4), junior 
guard Brent Finch (5-10) and senior guard David Siegel (6-0). 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: 
</P>
<P>
Agoura's move from the Frontier League will be soothed by a deep roster. "This 
is one of the best benches we've had," Pasky said. "We'll probably run a 
nine-man rotation. We only have starters because we need five guys out there 
for the opening tip." The Chargers, who lost to Edison in the second round of 
the 4-AA Division playoffs last season, lack size. But they will attempt to 
overcome that with their quickness, full-court pressure and an up-tempo attack. 
Agoura will rely heavily on Martin's shooting touch. "The question is whether 
the team can handle the frustration when they're not shooting well," Pasky 
said. Agoura improved dramatically over the summer, but lack of size likely 
will keep the Chargers from moving into the league's upper echelon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Mike Prewitt, 1st season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 16-9; tied for 3rd in league, 7-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Senior guard David Harbour (6-3), a two-time all-league and 
All-Ventura County selection who averaged 27.7 points a game last season, has 
signed an early letter of intent with Stanford. He leads a group of nine 
players who return from a team that lost to Walnut, 52-49, in the first round 
of the 4-AA Division playoffs. Seniors Brian Vellmure (5-10) and Greg Erickson 
(5-11) are battling at point guard. Junior Geoff Gordon (6-3), who has been 
hampered by a knee injury, and seniors Dave Nathaniel (6-1), Marc Teretola 
(6-2) and Fred Tepesano (6-3) are the leading candidates for the front-line 
positions. Other returnees include senior forwards Jamie Shaver (6-0) and Matt 
Watson (6-2). Sophomore point guard Jaime Jaquez (6-0), junior guard Brandon 
McFadden (5-11) and junior forward Anthony Bartolotto (6-1) are first-year 
varsity players. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Last season, Camarillo struggled to provide scoring support for 
Harbour, who by season's end was facing double- and triple-team defenses. 
Camarillo again will be a one-man show unless a scorer emerges to relieve the 
load. "We're just hoping we can share the ball enough to get some balance, and 
that alone will take the pressure off David," Pruitt said. The Scorpions are 
short and quick and will push the ball up the court. "We'll try to find any 
advantage possible to make up for our weaknesses," Pruitt said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Don Salado, 17th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 8-15; 6th in league, 2-10 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Senior Stephane Brown (6-2) could be the best all-around 
player in the league. Brown transferred from Columbus, Ohio, last season but 
was academically ineligible until the final game -- in which he had 24 points, 
10 rebounds and 10 assists. Also returning are senior point guard Marlowe 
Durmiendo (6-0), who averaged 16.2 points and was second-team all-league and 
All-Ventura County. Junior guard Noe Noyola (6-3) averaged 11 points and 
received league honorable mention last season. Senior forward Paul Estrada 
(6-2) is a two-year letterman. Senior forward Renard Carn (6-2) is a returning 
starter. Brian Schimelpfehing (6-3), a senior forward, is a returning 
letterman. Senior Marlon Jones (6-4) could start at center. Seniors Tremaine 
Larkin (5-10) and Victor Medina (6-1) and sophomore Raysean Campbell (6-0) have 
moved up from a strong junior varsity and will provide the Raiders with depth. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Channel Islands has steadily improved since its 1-19 mark during the 
1988-89 season and the addition of Brown to an already-talented team will make 
the Raiders a contender for the league title. But, despite raves about the 
Raiders from the league's other coaches, Salado is not convinced that his team 
will finish much better than .500. Channel Islands is quick and experienced but 
lacks height. It will attempt to parlay that weakness with pressure defense and 
an up-tempo offense. The guard combination of Brown, Durmiendo and Noyola 
provides the Raiders with perhaps the best backcourt in the league. "I'm very 
optimistic, but this is a very tough league," Salado said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Greg Ropes, 2nd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 7-17; 7th in league, 1-11 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Senior Tim Lane, a 5-10 point guard who averaged 11.8 points 
and four assists, and 6-3 senior forward Chris Falzone (11.8 points) are the 
lone returning players with varsity experience. Senior guards Mike Bannister 
(5-9) and Jamey Famularcano (6-1) move up from the junior varsity as do 
forwards Tyghe Harrell (6-0), Sean McKeown (6-4) and Jason Patterson (6-2). 
Junior transfer Matt Cummings (6-2) played at the junior-varsity level at 
Ventura last season. Newbury Park will rely on help in the middle from seniors 
Robby Robinson (6-3), Owen Ryan (6-2), and Jeff Hook (6-3). 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Lane, one of the league's best point guards, is the lone bright spot 
for Newbury Park. "We don't have any size or speed, but our work ethic and 
attitude have been pretty good," Ropes said. Last season, the Panthers relied 
on the size of Kevin Loveall (6-8), who led Ventura County players in 
rebounding at 12.3 a game, and Joe Smigiel (6-5) and Ryan Turner (6-4). This 
season, no Panther is taller than 6-4, which will change Ropes' strategy. 
"We'll have to increase our defensive pressure and control the ball on 
offense," he said. Newbury Park, which is the smallest school in the league 
(1,300 enrollment), likely will struggle again this season. "If we were a 
football team, everybody would be scheduling us for homecoming," Ropes said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Royal 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Joe Malkinson, 4th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 20-7; tied for 1st in league, 9-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Royal has the biggest team in the league with a front line 
that includes seniors Jared Byrne (6-7), Kevin Hambly (6-7), Mark Fiala (6-5) 
and Aaron Kammerman (6-3), and juniors Kerry White (6-5) and Ryan Fien (6-4). 
Byrne averaged 11.5 points and eight rebounds last season and Hambly grabbed 
six rebounds a game. Senior Greg Gray (5-10), a returning letterman, will start 
at point guard. David Tyner (6-3), a senior transfer from Rim of the World, hit 
44 three-point baskets last season and will play off-guard. Royal's bench will 
be strong with junior guards Pratik Patel (5-9), Darren Mitchell (5-11), Brett 
Osterhoudt (6-1) and senior forward Tim Ross (6-3). 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Last season, Royal set a school record for wins in a season (20) and 
earned its first league title since 1971. Yet Malkinson believes the 1990-91 
version of the Highlanders will be even stronger. Russell Myers, the school's 
all-time leading scorer, has graduated and is playing at Cal Poly Pomona. But 
Tyner will help fill that void. "We'll have a little more offensive power and 
will be stronger all-around," Malkinson said. Royal is seeded second in the 
always-tough Beverly Hills tournament, which features top-seeded Rolling Hills 
and traditional power Long Beach Poly. "We'll have something to say about the 
league title race," Malkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Dean Bradshaw, 3rd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 19-9; tied for 1st in league, 9-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Senior guards Tim Jaqua (5-11) and Daryl Hernandez (5-10) are 
Simi Valley's only returning players and will provide the Pioneers with a 
strong backcourt. Michael Crawford (6-4), a senior transfer from Kennedy, has 
not played organized basketball but is the Pioneers' best all-around player. 
"We're counting on a lot of things from Michael," Bradshaw said. "He has a lot 
to offer us." Junior Gordon Stolla (6-1) will provide strong shooting from the 
perimeter. Senior Mike Fukumoto (5-8) will spell Jaqua. Senior guards David 
Lazicki (5-10), Tim Kirksey (6-0) and Brian Meyer (5-8) add depth. Junior 
forwards Shawn Smith (6-1) and Danny Alexander (6-5) move up from a 
junior-varsity team that finished 18-4 and won a league championship for the 
sixth consecutive year. Senior Diego Cabezas (6-2) is an exchange student from 
Ecuador. Seniors David Hayden (6-1) and Jeff Havard (6-6) will provide help in 
the middle. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Simi Valley has won at least a share of the past five league titles 
and six of the past seven. Bradshaw called last season's title run the Drive 
For Five and has dubbed this season Pick Six: "Because we'll feel like we've 
won the lottery when we win it," Bradshaw said. Simi Valley's odds improved 
dramatically with Crawford's transfer, which fills some gaps left by the 
graduation of center Mike Wawryk, forward Kenny Hood and guard Steve Carnes. 
Simi Valley, which traditionally works the ball into its post players, does not 
have the luxury of an accomplished post player this season. Instead, the 
Pioneers will push the ball up the floor and allow Crawford to exhibit his 
skills. "The best thing we have going is our tradition," Bradshaw said. "Our 
kids believe they are going to get it done." And, true to form, the Pioneers 
again are contenders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Ed Chevalier, 12th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 12-12; tied for 3rd in league, 7-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Senior forward Chris Loll (6-5), who averaged 15.6 points and 
seven rebounds last season, has bulked up to 190 pounds and is one of the 
finest all-around players in the league. Loll was All-Ventura County last 
season. Eight more players return from a team that dropped a 100-73 decision to 
Loyola in the first round of the Southern Section 5-A Division playoffs. They 
include senior point guard Scott Peterson (6-0), senior guard Brian Capella 
(6-1), junior guard Andrew Borg (5-10), senior guard Gal Hever, senior forward 
Tony Siegel (6-2), senior forward Shane May (6-1), senior forward Dusty Lysobey 
(6-3) and junior forward Shane Graham (6-5). Lysobey was second to Loll in both 
scoring (10.5) and rebounding (6.9), and Hever averaged 7.2 points. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Thousand Oaks is the preseason favorite to win the league title and 
could win 20 games for the first time since the 1983-84 season. The Lancers 
have so much talent that Chevalier has difficulty choosing a starting five. 
"They're almost indistinguishable," Chevalier said. "But I can live with it." 
Like many league foes, Thousand Oaks will abandon its deliberate approach in 
favor of an up-tempo attack. "We're going to let our players play to their 
abilities," Chevalier said. That, no doubt, will result in some long nights for 
opposing teams. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Westlake 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Gary Grayson, 1st season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 13-11, tied for 3rd in league, 7-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Senior John Van Spyk (6-6), a returning first-team all-league 
player who led the team with 16.3 points and 6.3 rebounds, could be the top 
post player in the league. Returning letterman Lonnie Chavez (5-9), a junior, 
will start at point guard. Senior forward Dave Monheim (6-3) was a part-time 
starter last year. Senior forwards Rob Hoover (6-3) and Esau Blanco (6-3 are 
returning lettermen who will contend for a starting position along with seniors 
Derek Stein (6-5) and Ryan Jenkinson (6-5). Guard Ramin Kabir (5-9) moves up 
from the freshman team. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Grayson, an assistant at Canyon the past four seasons, will be pressed 
to improve upon last season's record, especially after he got a late start -- 
he wasn't hired until August. "It might take us a little time to catch up," he 
said. Westlake's strengths are its post players, specifically Van Spyk. The 
Warriors will find out how strong their post players are Thursday when they 
open with powerhouse St. Monica in the St. Monica tournament. "Obviously, we'd 
like to win," Grayson said, "but it will be a time for us to grow as a team."

Bell-Jeff 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Steve Wahl, 1st season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 9-15; 4th in league, 5-5 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Wahl replaces Joe Dunn, who stepped down after 12 seasons in 
August because of personal reasons. Three junior starters, swingman Brian Lee 
(6-foot-3), point guard Bryon Camacho (5-7) and guard Ignacio Castro (6-0) 
return. Wahl calls Lee the top all-around player. "He can play forward, guard 
or center and score and rebound," Wahl said. Camacho averaged 11.6 points a 
game last season and is the catalyst for an offense that will play an up-tempo 
game. "He makes everything go," said Wahl, who also coaches the boys' and 
girls' tennis teams. "We have good team speed and we want to take advantage of 
it." Two juniors, forward Damien Scott (6-2) and center Joe Bunning (6-5), 
round out the starting lineup. Scott and Bunning will be the dominant forces 
under the boards. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The team, which did not participate in summer league because of Wahl's 
late hiring, has eight underclassmen on its 12-man roster. "It's been difficult 
just trying to get it going with a new philosophy, but I think we'll come 
around once they catch on," Wahl said. Wahl believes Harvard and St. Francis 
and possibly El Segundo could contend for the league championship, but he 
believes that Bell-Jeff should finish no lower than third. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harvard 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Greg Hilliard, 6th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 23-3; 1st in league, 10-0 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Seven players return from last season's San Fernando Valley 
League championship team, which advanced to the Southern Section 3-A Division 
semifinals. Forward Andres Carlo (6-4) and center Spencer Miller (6-8), both 
seniors, are returning starters. Carlo played in all 26 games, averaging 10 
points, 8.8 rebounds, 2.8 steals and 1.5 blocks. Carlo and Miller should be 
strong inside forces, but Hilliard said that Carlo also is an effective outside 
threat. Iheanyi Uwaezouke (6-2), a Division I football prospect, and Marcus 
Puhvel (6-5) received significant playing time as juniors. Newcomer Tarlin Ray 
(6-2), a junior point guard, rounds out the starting five. Hilliard said that 
Puhvel probably is the best outside shooter and that Uwaezouke and Ray are the 
best ballhandlers. Harvard averaged more than 85 points a game last season and 
Hilliard thinks this year's team can duplicate that effort. "We're definitely a 
running team with a full-pressure defense," Hilliard said. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "Our strength is our conditioning and we have good athletes that have 
yet to be proven," said Hilliard, who has guided Harvard to two league titles 
and four playoff berths in five seasons. "Last year's team was tight and 
cohesive and how well we come together will be the determining factor." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
St. Francis 
</P>
<P>
COACH: John Jordan, 4th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 7-15; 5th in league, 2-6 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Kyle Barrett (6-3), Dave Landa (5-3) and Marty Konrad (6-3) 
return and are expected to play key roles. Barrett is the Golden Knights' main 
offensive threat and averaged 16.4 points last season. Landa, who averaged 
eight points and 5.1 assists, will play point guard. Konrad averaged seven 
rebounds last season. Junior Tory Carruthers (6-3) also will start. Four 
sophomores and two juniors with no varsity experience round out the team. 
"Hopefully, we can build around (Barrett, Landa and Konrad) and find some other 
kids to help them out," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Jordan believes that the basketball team will benefit from the move 
from the Del Rey League to the San Fernando Valley League in the same manner as 
the football team, which improved from 1-9 to 7-4. But Jordan is unsure of what 
to expect. "I have no idea what we'll do," Jordan said. "We're so young. I'm 
not sure what kind of character this team is going to have." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
St. Genevieve 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Scott Smith, 3rd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 2-20; 6th in league, 0-10 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Senior guards Jeff De La O (5-9) and Josh Smith (5-10) 
started last season and are among seven returning players. De La O, who 
averaged 10 points, will be relied upon for his offensive output. Smith will be 
the primary ballhandler. Junior center Pat Rodriguez (6-2) and junior John 
Hoffmann (6-2) and senior Victor Dionisio (5-11), both forwards, also will 
start. Pete Miranda (5-10), Dominic Parero (5-9) and Mike Robinson (6-1), a 
transfer from Crespi, also will be given extensive playing time. "We don't have 
any size so everybody is going to have to crash the boards," Smith said. "Once 
we get the ball, we'll be all right." Smith says quickness is the team's most 
valuable asset and that he will utilize a motion offense. "We'll set screens 
and try to roll out of them." 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: St. Genevieve should be improved, but Smith believes the league, in 
particular St. Francis and Harvard, is very strong. "It was a long season and 
we didn't get any wins (last year)," Smith said, "but we have only one way to 
go. We don't have any outstanding individual, but we work well as a team."

Buena 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Glen Hannah, 9th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 17-10; 3rd in league, 10-4 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Buena's top returning player is junior guard Lance Fay 
(6-foot), a returning starter at off-guard who averaged 10.4 points a game last 
season and will move to point guard this season. Senior forward Josh Evarts 
(6-2), the only other returnee, will start at one forward position. Junior Matt 
Bortolin (6-0) is a probable starter at off-guard. The other forward position 
is a battle between junior Matt Houchin (6-0) and senior Jordan Barkalow (6-1). 
Seniors Matt Egan (6-3) and Joey Young (6-4) are vying for the starting center 
position. Reserve forward Doug Wilder is recovering from a fractured wrist and 
Russell Rose sustained a knee injury. Both players could be sidelined until 
league play begins in January. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Eleven players graduated from last year's team, including guard Jeff 
Oliver (28 points a game) and Darren Shearer (15.7), the Bulldogs' leading 
scorers. The Bulldogs' tallest player is 6-4, but their up-tempo attack should 
diminish some of their weaknesses. "I think we'll run the ball pretty well," 
Hannah said. "Our press could be the key for us." Buena, which has qualified 
for the playoffs in eight of the past nine seasons, likely will finish in the 
middle of a pack of very talented teams. Favored for the title are San Marcos, 
with eight returning lettermen from last year's 24-8 team, and Santa Barbara, 
led by all-league forward Matt Purdy and guard Simon Banks. 
</P>

Hueneme 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Howard Davis, 3rd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 6-18; 7th in league, 3-11 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Senior forward Jack Brown (6-1) and junior forward Isreal 
Fuentes (6-5) are the lone returning lettermen. Sophomore Tony Smith (5-9) will 
start at point guard and senior Pedro Duran (5-11) will start at shooting 
guard. Sophomore Wendell Nunnery (6-3) likely will start at forward and junior 
Dwine Knott (6-4) might start at center. Sophomore Wayen Revas (5-8), a 
transfer from Texas, will spell Duran. The Vikings will be deep with senior 
guard Jay Aguilar (5-7), sophomore guard Ike Coleman (5-9), senior forward Fred 
Villaneuva (6-4) and Todd Uffens, a 6-6 junior center from Spain. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Last year the Vikings were one-dimensional behind Mike Spears, who 
averaged 21 points. But Spears has graduated, and Davis will have more depth 
with which to work. And, as much as the Vikings are expected to run, he will 
need it. "We'll run and press and do whatever we can to increase the tempo," 
Davis said. "Our strength is our quickness, which is the best I've had at 
Hueneme, and we shoot the ball pretty well." The key to a successful season for 
the Vikings lies in the development of their youth; seven of their 15 players 
are underclassmen. "Because we're pretty young, we'll be pleased to finish over 
.500," Davis said. "But it's possible we could be better than that. You can be 
a real good team in this league and finish fifth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Dan Garcia, 8th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 8-16; 8th in league, 2-12 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Senior guard Antonio Williams (6-1) averaged 16 points last 
season and was an all-league selection. Other probable starters include junior 
forward Jasper Satterwhite (6-3), junior shooting guard David Dickey (6-0), 
senior point guard Rubin Bryant (6-0) and junior center Corey Upchurch (6-5). 
Dickey averaged 17 points a game at the junior-varsity level last season. 
Bryant has recovered from a knee injury that sidelined him much of last season. 
Senior Yuseph Sharpe (6-0) will add depth at guard. Senior forward Fred 
Martinez (6-2) will contribute a soft shooting touch. Garcia says junior 
forward Casey Turner (6-2), who did not play last season, has improved 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Oxnard has not had a winning season since 1984-85, the season in which 
the Yellowjackets last reached the playoffs. Yet Garcia says Oxnard has a 
legitimate opportunity to climb out of the league cellar for the first time in 
two seasons. "We aren't very big, so rebounding is going to be a question 
mark," he said. "If we can rebound, we'll be pretty competitive." Kenyon Lewis, 
a 6-3 forward who played considerably as a junior last season, decided not to 
play. Oxnard will increase defensive pressure this season. "We'll try and use 
our quickness," Garcia said. "If we rebound, we'll run. If we don't rebound, 
we'll slow it down." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Steve Wolf, 6th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 14-15; 4th (tie) in league, 7-7 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Rio Mesa will employ a talented, three-guard offense that 
includes seniors Greg Bellman (6-3) and Manuk Kayaoglu (6-2) and junior Swanson 
Nunnery (5-9). Nunnery averaged a team-leading 5.1 assists and 2.5 steals last 
season. Junior David Halverson (6-3) was the MVP of the junior varsity last 
season and will start at forward. The starting center position might be filled 
by sophomore Jade Peterson (6-7). Junior Jason McLean (6-0) will work into the 
guard rotation and Rio Mesa has talented athletes in front-line players Jeff 
Howatt (6-5), Mike Mitchell (6-4), and Dusty Kawai (6-3). 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The Spartans were a one-man show last year with Eric Thomas, who 
averaged 21 points and nine rebounds and is playing at the University of New 
Mexico this fall. But they will attempt to make up for that loss with quickness 
and shooting ability. "We don't have any big people, but hopefully we have 
enough 6-3 players who can get some rebounds," Wolf said. Rio Mesa's immediate 
strength lies in the quickness and shooting of guards Bellman, Kayaoglu and 
Nunnery. Halverson and Peterson are young but talented. "As our inside players 
mature, we'll get better," Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ventura 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Dan Larson, 2nd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 8-17, 6th in league, 5-9. 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Ventura will start three sophomores: point guard guard Larry 
Anter (5-10), off-guard Darien Roberts (6-0) and forward Curt Vaughan (6-2). 
Anter and Roberts were co-MVPs of the junior varsity last season and Vaughan 
was MVP of the freshman team. Senior center Mike Ryken (6-4) and senior forward 
Randy Martinez (6-2), an honorable-mention selection who averaged 8.2 points 
and 4.3 rebounds last season, are probable starters. Three of Ventura's four 
inside players return, including seniors John Seiler (6-1) and Chris Rockwell 
(6-3). Senior Jonas Barnes (6-8) is a first-year player. Junior Josh Powers 
(6-0) and seniors Mike True (6-2), Omid Sohrab (6-3) and Ulf Dorner (6-2) will 
provide the Cougars with depth. Dorner is an exchange student from Germany. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Ventura does not have any superstars but will be steady throughout its 
lineup. The backcourt is inexperienced at the varsity level. "We're young, but 
I think there's some quality there," Larson said. Ryken and Martinez each weigh 
215 pounds and Barnes adds an additional 220 pounds, all of which gives Ventura 
potential to become a strong rebounding team. The Cougars, with leading scorers 
Kevin Keich (14.7 points a game) and Kevin Williams (13.6) graduated, lack a 
proven scorer. But it could turn out be Seiler, who averaged 9.3 points and 6.7 
rebounds last season. "If we gain some confidence, we could be a team to beat," 
Larson said. "If we're slow coming around, it could be a problem." Ventura has 
the potential to post its first winning record in three seasons, but much of it 
relies on the development of its young backcourt. Last season, the Cougars 
played their best basketball during the league season; a repeat performance is 
likely.

Lose Your Turn: Parker Bros., the famous game maker, gushed over its new board 
game, called "Careers for Girls." But then along came Susan Engeleiter. 
</P>
<P>
The administrator of the Small Business Administration said in Washington, 
D.C., the game has only six "careers": super mom, schoolteacher, rock star, 
fashion designer, college graduate and vet, and she said it does not include 
such careers as business executive, government leader, astronaut or scientist. 
"If the Parker 'Brothers' were the Parker 'Sisters,' this game would never have 
passed 'Go,' " she said.

Dogged: Ronald Reagan's autobiography, "An American Life," is a best-seller, 
but sales are lagging behind those of "Millie's Book," the dog's-eye-view of 
the Bush White House. "Millie's Book," ghostwritten by Barbara Bush, was No. 3 
on this week's New York Times nonfiction best-seller list, five notches ahead 
of Reagan's read. "It's a bit of an unfair comparison," growled Jack McKeown, 
spokesman for Reagan's publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster. "They are appealing to 
quite difference audiences."

lost. "If more people . . . talked openly about Alzheimer's, the day for a cure 
might arrive sooner," she said. Her husband, Harry, 81, was charged in the tax 
case but could not help in his defense because he suffered from some memory 
loss.

Kelly. The couple will wed next spring.

MARKETS THAT FOCUS ON GIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For socially conscious shoppers who just can't bring themselves to bestow 
another fruitcake or necktie this year, the San Gabriel Valley offers a number 
of alternative holiday markets. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the markets go to a variety of causes such as the preservation of 
the world's rain forests, shelter for the homeless and purchase of clean 
syringes for Eastern European hospitals and livestock for villages in far-flung 
regions of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Gift-givers make a donation in the recipient's name and receive a greeting card 
to leave under the tree. 
</P>
<P>
A $3 donation buys a rabbit, $30 buys a box of syringes, and up to $3,750 buys 
a year of job training for a disabled Navajo Indian. 
</P>
<P>
Toys and dolls will also be on sale at markets through a group called Third 
World Hand Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Following is a list of some alternative marketplaces in the San Gabriel Valley: 
</P>
<P>
All Saints Episcopal Church will feature opportunities to donate to a number of 
relief programs around the world and to the church's own charity projects for

GUN OWNERS IGNORING LAW ON REGISTRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Owners of hundreds of thousands of military-style assault guns in California 
are holding onto their weapons and not registering them in what an official of 
the National Rifle Assn. characterized Tuesday as a massive demonstration of 
civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
Under an 18-month-old statute that all but outlawed such firearms, owners of 
legally acquired Uzis, AK-47s, AR-15s and other exotic semiautomatics must 
register them by Dec. 31 or face a stiff fine or possible criminal penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Since the law was signed by Gov. George Deukmejian, only 5,150 out of 
approximately 300,000 such guns believed to be owned by Californians have been 
registered with the state Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
Although a last-minute rush to register is possible, "I think it is pretty 
obvious that there is non-compliance with the law," said Robert Drake, a bureau 
chief in the department's division of law enforcement. "Enforcement is not our 
job. Enforcement is a local issue." 
</P>
<P>
However, local authorities, who will be called on to enforce the registration 
law, said they do not intend to launch extraordinary efforts to find and 
prosecute violators. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Richard Gardiner, who led the NRA's unsuccessful fight to kill 
the assault weapons bill in the California Legislature, said he believes that 
as the deadline approaches "there is going to be massive civil disobedience" by 
gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
"According to all the surveys, nine out of 10 citizens believe they have a 
constitutional right to own firearms and they are going to exercise that 
right," Gardiner said. "People are not going to take (unregistered) guns out on 
the street and try to get themselves arrested. (But) a lot of people are going 
to quietly keep the guns in the hope that the law will be either invalidated or 
repealed." 
</P>
<P>
Gardiner said the NRA does not advise its members to obey or disobey the law. 
"We tell them that we believe it is unconstitutional. We leave it to them to 
choose what they want to do. If someone chooses to disobey the law, civil 
disobedience is a moral decision that each must make for himself." 
</P>
<P>
Historically, many gun owners, even so-called moderates, have viewed 
registration as the first step toward the unthinkable: confiscation of their 
firearms. 
</P>
<P>
The law gave owners of legally obtained assault weapons 18 months, or until 
this Dec. 31, to register them. Failure to do so is punishable by an infraction 
fine of $350 on the first offense. Subsequent violations may be treated as a 
misdemeanor or felony, including jail terms. 
</P>
<P>
Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los 
Angeles), authors of the statute, expressed disappointment that the 
registration requirement is apparently being ignored. 
</P>
<P>
"Civil disobedience is fine, but it is going to be expensive," Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Roos: "It's just amazing to me that an organization, and Gardiner himself, 
who have been suggesting that we get tougher with people who break the law, 
should now be so cavalier with a law they don't believe in." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the law made it illegal as of last Jan. 1 to sell, 
transfer, import, loan, manufacture, distribute or give away about 60 types of 
military-style assault guns, including semiautomatic rifles, pistols and 
shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
For Californians who already legally owned these weapons -- estimated by the 
NRA and the state Department of Justice at about 300,000 -- the law created a 
heavily publicized, first-ever firearms registration system. 
</P>
<P>
There is no statewide policy that governs how the registration requirements 
will be enforced. But in a series of interviews, officials of several local and 
statewide law enforcement organizations indicated that police chiefs and 
sheriffs intend to establish similar local policies. 
</P>
<P>
These officials agreed that no special effort would be made to enforce the new 
law and that citations would be incidental to another offense or citizen 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to go out and create a task force of any kind," said Los 
Angeles Police Department spokesman Fred Nixon. "We anticipate that in the 
course of some other kind of investigation that occasionally we will become 
aware of failure to register the weapon. In those instances, we will, of 
course, take the weapon into custody and then request the appropriate criminal 
filing." 
</P>
<P>
In Northern California, Lt. Lyle Shores of the Contra Costa County Sheriff's 
Department said domestic disputes and divorce cases may provide the best 
incidental leads to unregistered weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know what you are going to stumble over," Shores said. "If you get 
called to a domestic fight, the wife may tell you all the things the husband 
has that he isn't supposed to have, or vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
In a case that may end up in the U.S. Supreme Court, the NRA failed late last 
summer to persuade a federal judge in Fresno to strike down the assault weapons 
law as unconstitutional. The NRA has asked that the ruling be reconsidered.

10 DOWNING ST. TO BE HOME TO A HORATIO ALGER

<P>
The election of John Major on Tuesday as the leader of the ruling Conservative 
Party puts a political Horatio Alger in No. 10 Downing St., the home and office 
of British prime ministers. 
</P>
<P>
A high school dropout who drifted from job to job until he caught on as a bank 
trainee and rose to become chancellor of the exchequer in Margaret Thatcher's 
Cabinet, Major personifies the Conservative Party as rebuilt by Thatcher to 
recognize talent and reward merit. 
</P>
<P>
And the centerpiece of his five-day campaign to succeed Thatcher was his vision 
of a "classless society" to reform further a country where white collar still 
looks down upon blue collar, where Englishmen disdain immigrants, where 
ambition is often scorned as social climbing. 
</P>

"I want a genuine classless society in which people can rise to whatever level 
their abilities take them regardless of their origins," Major said last week, 
making his claim on the Conservative Party leadership and the premiership that 
comes with it. 
</P>
<P>
Major, at 47 the youngest of Britain's 18 prime ministers in this century, is 
himself a model of such a grit-and-guts rise out of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
His election over two classic Tory politicians -- one, Michael Heseltine, a 
millionaire who set himself the goal of Downing Street while at Oxford more 
than 35 years ago, the other, Douglas Hurd, a patrician graduate of Eton and 
Cambridge, the son and grandson of Conservative members of Parliament -- 
symbolizes the shifts in British politics under Thatcher away from the decades 
of battles between the country's moneyed governing class on the right and the 
rebellious working class on the left. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the very essence of the classless meritocrat," says Hugo Young, 
Thatcher's biographer. "He went neither to public (private) school nor 
university and would thus personify and perhaps complete the routing from Tory 
power and influence of the old landed gentry and their heirs." 
</P>
<P>
But Major is also very gray -- a pleasant man but nearly featureless as a 
politician. He is invariably compared by Britons to their neighborhood bank 
manager or perhaps the chairman of the local school committee. 
</P>
<P>
"A politician without an ideology of his own who would rather be led by a 
strong prime minister and well-informed officials than lead himself," two 
writers in the left-leaning Guardian said of Major this week. And a friendly 
journalist, writing in the Daily Mail, said, "Alas, for those who admire him as 
I do, he can be deeply exasperating." 
</P>
<P>
To that was added the more serious charge on Tuesday that he would be a 
Thatcher puppet after she was quoted as telling Conservative Party officials at 
a farewell that she would be "a very good back-seat driver." 
</P>
<P>
Major, already dubbed Thatcher's "poodle" three years ago for his devotion to 
her policies, was clearly the prime minister's preference as a successor. 
Political insiders said she had been grooming him for several years, valuing 
his sharp mind and talents for negotiation, and Major described himself 
unhesitatingly as a "Thatcherite." 
</P>
<P>
He has insisted, however, that he will be his own man. "I am not running as 
'Son of Thatcher,' " he told a television interviewer over the weekend. "I am 
running as myself, with my own priorities and my own program." 
</P>
<P>
Some policy differences did emerge in the brief campaign. Major stressed the 
need for stronger measures to control inflation; he called for a review, and 
implicitly a change, of the much-hated per-capita "poll tax" used to help 
finance local government services, and he put an unaccustomed emphasis on 
social services. 
</P>
<P>
Major, in the view of many analysts here, had won his independence two months 
ago with the decision, reversing Thatcher policy, to join the European 
Community's exchange rate mechanism, which links Europe's principal currencies 
to one another and, above all, to the dominant German mark. He had also 
promoted a further, interim measure, although publicly rejected by Thatcher, to 
lay the basis for an eventual common European currency. 
</P>
<P>
While supporting all the virtues, notably initiative and self-reliance, that 
have formed the core of Thatcherism for the past decade, Major is notably less 
doctrinaire. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not ideologically pure in any way," he said. He would continue the 
economic and social revolution begun by Thatcher, Major said, but the 
government would have to move ahead. "I am in the business of further change." 
</P>
<P>
"Classlessness" would be one of his major goals, Major said. Praising the 
contribution of blue-collar workers -- he had been a construction worker 
himself -- Major said that Britain must begin to treat all equally. "I hope the 
general atmosphere we create will remove those old social attitudes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have nearly got the property-owning democracy (through the sale of 
government-owned housing to their occupants), but we have not yet got the 
capital-owning democracy," Major said, referring to the extensive privatization 
of state-owned enterprises under Thatcher. "I don't mean rich men with piles of 
money. I mean the ordinary 'everyperson' having his own savings for the 
independence and security it gives them." 
</P>
<P>
He also stressed in weekend interviews that he would be a collegial prime 
minister, not dominating the Cabinet as did Thatcher. "The Cabinet has to be 
the centerpiece of the government's administration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"As a chairman of Cabinet committees, he is very good at summing up the voices 
and coming down decisively for what he feels to be the common will," a fellow 
minister, who was not among his backers, said of Major. "He does not exclude 
people. He is a good listener." 
</P>
<P>
But another parliamentary colleague added, "He is quiet but not soft. He 
definitely has a steel girder running up his backbone." 
</P>
<P>
Elected to Parliament in 1979 when the Conservatives won and Thatcher became 
prime minister, Major worked his way up the political and governmental 
hierarchy, holding seven jobs in the past nine years and winning promotions 
through his talents as a politician and administrator and devotion to 
Thatcherism. 
</P>
<P>
Before becoming chancellor of the exchequer, or the country's chief Treasury 
official, in October, 1989, he served briefly as foreign secretary; chief 
Treasury secretary, or principal budget officer; the undersecretary of state 
and then minister for social security; a whip in the House of Commons and a 
parliamentary secretary for the Home Office minister. He was the first member 
of Parliament from the "Class of '79" to be promoted to the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Still, critics said that Major was not experienced enough to become the party's 
leader and prime minister, noting that his rivals for the post had at least 10 
years more experience than he. 
</P>
<P>
But no one faulted his performance in any of those posts. He even drew praise 
for the swift correction of a major mistake, in 1987, of not immediately 
providing the country's old-age pensioners with additional money as a fuel 
subsidy during a bitter January cold spell. 
</P>
<P>
Major had been an executive of Standard Chartered Bank, one of Britain's 
largest, for 14 years before he entered national politics with the patronage of 
Tony Barber, a former chancellor who was then the bank's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, I discourage people from entering politics if they have a young 
family and don't have money," Barber said on Tuesday. "John Major was 
different. He was too great a talent to ignore. We had to grab him for the 
Conservative Party." 
</P>
<P>
Major learned his politics as a Young Conservative on a soapbox in Brixton, a 
poor, racially mixed neighborhood in south London, where he took on the 
socialist Labor Party for its inept management of the area's public housing 
projects. He won election to the local council primarily with the support of 
blacks; housing and racism were his issues as he established a reputation as a 
progressive. 
</P>
<P>
He had grown up in the neighborhood after his father -- once a trapeze artist 
with Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, later a vaudeville 
performer and then a sculptor -- went bankrupt manufacturing lawn ornaments. 
The family moved from comfortable, middle-class Wimbledon to Brixton, where 
they lived in a two-room apartment, cooked on a gas stove on the landing and 
shared a bathroom with other tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Major left school at 16 to help support his family. He worked a variety of 
jobs, mostly in the construction industry, and once was rejected when he 
applied for a position as a bus conductor on grounds that he was weak in 
arithmetic. He was unemployed for eight months and collected welfare. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been of immense value to me to have been on the other side of the fence 
and know what it is to face difficulties, and I don't regret any of that," 
Major said when asked whether he regretted not having gone to a university. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher described him this week as "a man of the people," and Major has seemed 
truly happy being with them, even eating dinner regularly at a nearby McDonalds 
and other fast-food restaurants while foreign secretary and chancellor of the 
exchequer. 
</P>
<P>
During Major's years in Parliament, his wife, Norma, 45, and their children, 
Elizabeth, 19, and James, 16, have lived in Great Stukeley in his constituency, 
Huntingdon, in Cambridgeshire, north of London, and he has come home on 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Norma Major, an expert cook and dressmaker, prefers a quiet family life and 
seemed almost frightened Tuesday as photographers and television crews thronged 
her and her husband. She has been active in local Huntingdon charities, and in 
1987 she published a biography of opera singer Joan Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very fulfilled by domesticity, and I don't feel ashamed or guilty about 
that," she said -- doing her ironing to an operatic aria -- when her husband 
was named foreign secretary last year. 
</P>
<P>
Even more quoted on Tuesday was her reply to another interviewer who asked in 
1986 whether she thought her husband would ever become prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
"No," she said, "that kind of thing doesn't happen to people like us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MAJOR'S POINT OF VIEW 
</P>
<P>
A look at the views of John Major, new leader of Britain's Conservative Party. 
He will succeed Margaret Thatcher as prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
ON THE PERSIAN GULF: "There will be no difference in policy," Major said. 
"There is absolute unity that what has happened there is unforgivable and that 
it has to be reversed." 
</P>
<P>
ON THE ECONOMY: In the mold of Margaret Thatcher, Major is a rigorous 
free-marketeer who will follow her policies of selling nationalized industries 
and holding down government spending. As chancellor of the exchequer, he has 
kept interest rates high as part of the government's program to combat 
inflation, currently at 10.9%. He has said he would make some tax cuts in lower 
brackets. 
</P>
<P>
ON EUROPE: Major will show more enthusiasm for European monetary union than 
Thatcher did, but he remains cautious. He drafted a plan for a "parallel 
currency" that would be used in addition to the 12 national currencies. As 
chancellor, he took the pound into Europe's exchange rate mechanism in October. 
</P>
<P>
ON LOCAL TAXES: Major has pledged to review the unpopular per-capita "poll 
tax," which has become a major political liability for the Conservative Party. 
But he has ruled out its abolition.

JOHN MAJOR, 47, A THATCHER PROTEGE, WILL LEAD BRITAIN;

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Major, the 47-year-old chancellor of the exchequer who rose out of one of 
London's toughest neighborhoods and the unemployment line, was selected Tuesday 
as Britain's next prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Major, whose father was once a circus trapeze artist, was elected leader of the 
Conservative Party to replace Margaret Thatcher, whose sudden resignation under 
pressure last week surprised the nation. Thatcher formally presents her 
resignation today to Queen Elizabeth II, who will then ask Major to form a new 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives' choice of Major, a Thatcher protege, came after a battle 
pitting him against two other contenders for the party leadership, former 
Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. The 
three-way race took shape last week when Thatcher, stunned by Heseltine's 
strong showing in the first-round voting for party leader, resigned. 
</P>
<P>
In the secret, second-round balloting among the 372 Tory members of the House 
of Commons on Tuesday, Major got 185 votes -- two shy of the total he needed 
for an outright victory. But as party members began preparing themselves for a 
Thursday runoff between Major and Heseltine, the runner-up, both Heseltine, 
with 131 votes, and Hurd, with 56, threw their support to Major. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher said she was "thrilled" by Major's victory, adding that he was her 
personal favorite among the three contenders. 
</P>
<P>
Major becomes Britain's 18th prime minister and the youngest in this century. 
</P>
<P>
His election ensures the unity of the fractured Conservative Party, which now 
has become the favorite to defeat the opposition Labor Party in the next 
general election. Before Thatcher's resignation, the polls had been favoring 
Labor. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing outside his official residence at No. 11 Downing St., next to the 
prime minister's, Major declared Tuesday evening, "We are going to unite 
totally and absolutely, and we are going to win the next election." 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very exciting thing to become leader of the Conservative Party, and 
particularly exciting, I think, to follow one of the most remarkable leaders 
the Conservative Party has ever had," Major said. 
</P>
<P>
He complimented his rivals for a campaign based on "substance, not 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
When the results of Tuesday's vote were announced about 6:20 p.m., both 
Heseltine and Hurd said that they would vote for Major in the scheduled third 
runoff ballot on Thursday and advised their supporters to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
Party leaders, however, waived the third ballot -- which was expected to be 
unanimous -- and Major was declared party leader. 
</P>
<P>
After his appointment by the queen today, he is expected to name his Cabinet in 
a few days. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, en route to Washington after a visit to Mexico, telephoned 
Major from aboard Air Force One to congratulate him. 
</P>
<P>
"The President said he looked forward to working with Major and to maintaining 
the special relationship" with Britain, said White House Press Secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State and Defense departments also welcomed the news. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very glad that it's all settled, and that it was able to be settled so 
quickly," a State Department official said. "We know John Major and expect to 
work well with him. We don't expect any change in U.S.-U.K. relations." 
</P>
<P>
After Major's election, Thatcher declared that she wanted everyone "to rally 
behind him." The prime minister had picked Major from among "backbenchers" -- 
those who are not party leaders -- as someone to watch several years ago and 
regarded him, aides said, as "a man of the people." 
</P>
<P>
With her support, he rose swiftly through the Department of Social Security and 
then the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher will remain a member of the House of Commons, representing the 
Finchley section of London. She and her husband, Denis, will move out of 10 
Downing St. today to their house in the South London community of Dulwich. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher may accept a peerage in the House of Lords as a hereditary countess, 
friends said, since earldoms (the male equivalent) are the traditional award to 
former prime ministers. That tradition was not followed by recent Labor prime 
ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Major is a high school dropout who made his name in banking before winning a 
seat in the House of Commons in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
He has few enemies and is regarded as a leader who can unify the party and, 
associates said Tuesday night, lead the Tories to victory in the next election, 
which must be held within 18 months, at a time of the party's choosing. 
</P>
<P>
He is not expected to introduce any major new policies but will take a more 
sympathetic view toward Britain's role in the European Community and has 
promised to review the controversial community charge, the so-called poll tax 
introduced by Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock, who likely will face Major in the next 
national election, immediately labeled him "more of the same" in the Thatcher 
mold. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party had expected to defeat an unpopular Thatcher in the next 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Cunningham, Labor's campaign coordinator, argued that Major's victory was 
that of the "Thatcher candidate." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham pointed out that 187 members of Major's own party, a majority in the 
House of Commons, voted against him Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
That in a sense was true. 
</P>
<P>
With 185 votes in the three-way race, Major did not gain as many as the 202 
votes Thatcher won Nov. 20, when Heseltine was her sole opponent. That vote -- 
while she was in Paris attending the summit meeting of the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe -- forced her into a runoff with Heseltine 
and ultimately cost her the party leadership. 
</P>
<P>
But in that vote, under the party's complicated rules, she needed a majority 
plus 15% and she fell four votes short. In Tuesday's ballot, only a simple 
majority was needed to win outright. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's downfall came after she had run into a stretch of 
unpopularity -- partly through her authoritarian manner, partly because of 
inflation and high interest rates and partly because of her unpopular new "poll 
tax." 
</P>
<P>
She also appeared to take an anti-European attitude toward her 11 partners in 
the European Community, which caused her long-serving Cabinet colleague and 
deputy prime minister, Geoffrey Howe, to resign and deliver a witheringly 
critical resignation speech. 
</P>
<P>
That speech led Heseltine, who had walked out of the Cabinet in 1984 in a 
dispute over how to aid of a defense contractor, to challenge Thatcher for the 
leadership in that first ballot last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's failure to gain the necessary majority forced her to 
reassess her position. Her closest advisers reported that her support in the 
House of Commons was eroding, friends said, so she decided to resign rather 
than risk the humiliation of a defeat at the hands of one of her own 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, on Thursday morning, both Major and Hurd, loyal members of her 
Cabinet, entered the race against Heseltine. 
</P>
<P>
Many Tories in Parliament were angry at Heseltine for his role in bringing down 
Thatcher, who had won three national elections during her 15 years as 
Conservative Party leader. 
</P>
<P>
Her 11 1/2-year tenure as prime minister was the longest in this century. Her 
confrontational style of leadership won her many admirers at home and abroad -- 
and many enemies, here and in the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
During the past few days, Major picked up strength among his colleagues, as 
opinion polls showed him to be the next most popular Tory after Heseltine 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Thatcher let it be known that she personally preferred Major to 
succeed her. 
</P>
<P>
Some commentators feared that Thatcher's revelation of her choice might harm 
Major -- with her comment Tuesday morning that she would make a "good back-seat 
driver." Labor members called Major "Mrs. Thatcher's poodle." 
</P>
<P>
But Major was the clear-cut victor in the balloting, held from 11 a.m. to 6 
p.m. Tuesday in a House of Commons committee room. 
</P>
<P>
After the results were announced, Heseltine declared that the election had been 
fought "without rancor and bitterness." To "lay the basis for unity," he said, 
he would ask his supporters to vote for Major in the expected third ballot on 
Thursday, as he himself would do. 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, Hurd did the same. 
</P>
<P>
A third ballot seemed certain until Cranley Onslow, who heads the Conservative 
Party organization called the 1922 Committee, which supervised the party 
election, announced that another ballot would not be necessary and declared 
Major the party leader. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear whether Hurd and Heseltine would join Major's 
Cabinet, though Major's aides indicated they would be offered roles in the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative Party members of all hues were elated by the result and by the 
fact that the short campaign was conducted in the most gentlemanly fashion, 
with no blood on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party, almost overnight, went from being the strong favorite in the 
next election to second place behind a Tory party led by Major. Recent opinion 
polls had suggested that any new leader would greatly enhance Tory popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Labor's Cunningham declared that the Conservatives' lead was "a temporary blip" 
and promised "to fight an election as soon as he (Major) names a date." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

IMMUNITY OFFERED IN USE OF FAKE ID CARDS; 
</P>
<P>
SOCIAL SECURITY: THE ESTIMATED 2 1/2 MILLION ALIENS WHO HAVE USED THEM CAN 
AVOID PROSECUTION AND RECOVER ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Using an obscure amendment added earlier this month to the controversial budget 
deficit reduction bill, federal authorities are offering immunity from 
prosecution to recently legalized aliens who used fake Social Security cards to 
work illegally in this country. 
</P>
<P>
The action exempts not only aliens who used fraudulent Social Security cards, 
but also those who are still using them. But to be eligible, the latter group 
must stop using their fraudulent cards by Jan. 3, 1991, 60 days after President 
Bush signed the bill into law. 
</P>
<P>
The action is expected to ultimately affect an estimated 2.5 million of the 3.1 
million people who applied for amnesty under the historic Immigration Reform 
and Control Act of 1986. Officials at the Social Security Administration said 
that, to their recollection, it marks the first time that the agency will allow 
fraudulent use of Social Security cards to go unpunished. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never done this before," acknowledged Social Security spokesman Scott 
Rose in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that people suspected of trafficking for profit in 
counterfeit cards will continue to be prosecuted by federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Aliens who qualified for legal U.S. residency under the 1986 law received a 
valid Social Security card, allowing them to work legally in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But civil libertarians and advocates of immigrants' rights contended that this 
did little to help correct the employment record and benefits eligibility of 
someone who worked for many years under either a false name or a fake Social 
Security card. 
</P>
<P>
The immunity from prosecution should rectify that, said Charles Wheeler, 
director of the Los Angeles-based National Immigration Law Center. 
</P>
<P>
"These people essentially have the green light to amend their (work) records . 
. . to get credit for their earnings posted (with federal authorities)," 
Wheeler said. "It's important to adjust all of this now because their work 
history is still fresh in their minds -- people they worked for and when." 
</P>
<P>
He said that if an alien worker dies before amending his work record, the 
worker's family will be denied survivors' benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Social Security officials said legalized aliens can adjust their work records 
at any time so long as they are not using any fake cards after Jan. 3. If they 
continue to use fake cards, the officials warned, their eligibility might be 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler said some aliens are likely to be hesitant about approaching employers 
to correct work records since some firms could use lying on an application form 
as a reason for dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
"I would urge a little caution in approaching some of these employers," Wheeler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Use of a fraudulent Social Security card is punishable by a maximum of five 
years in prison and a $250,000 fine, but Social Security officials admitted 
that they were swamped by rampant fraudulent use of cards as millions of 
illegal immigrants entered the country in the 1970s and early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The ease with which a fake Social Security card could be obtained made it one 
of the surest ways for an illegal alien to become a documented worker in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
When former President Ronald Reagan signed the amnesty measure, it lacked a 
provision to grant immunity from prosecution for the illegal use of fake Social 
Security cards. 
</P>
<P>
Civil libertarian groups, such as the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil 
Rights under Law, pushed for such a measure, but Congress balked during last 
year's negotiations over the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
"We became concerned by the absence of (Social Security) immunity when the 
legalization law passed," said attorney Deborah Sanders of the Washington 
Lawyers' Committee. "In talking with Social Security, they obviously weren't 
interesting in prosecuting people. We needed the law to make everything legal." 
</P>
<P>
During this year's budget debate, Bush and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill 
sparred over spending cuts of $325 billion and tax increases of $164 billion 
over five years. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders and others quietly approached conference committee members -- who were 
trying to resolve the House and Senate versions of the budget -- and persuaded 
them to include the immunity provision in the final measure that was signed 
into law by Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The provision went unnoticed for several weeks until the lawyers' committee, a 
public interest organization, began to publicize the upcoming Jan. 3 deadline 
to stop using fake Social Security cards.

$2-MILLION FIRE DESTROYS SCHOOL RECORDS

A spectacular fire early Tuesday gutted a school district warehouse in Simi 
Valley, causing at least $2 million in damage and destroying irreplaceable 
school records, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The district, with 18,000 students and 26 schools, is the largest in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
A cause has not yet been determined for the fire, the third this year at Simi 
Valley Unified School District and the most destructive in terms of the 
materials and records lost. 
</P>
<P>
More than 80 firefighters battled the blaze for 2 1/2 hours before controlling 
it, said Ron Taylor, a Ventura County Fire Deparment spokesman. There were no 
injuries reported and no one was inside the 20,000-square-foot concrete 
structure when the fire was discovered at 4 a.m., authorities said. The 
two-story, 17-year-old building is directly behind the district's 
administrative headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire undoubtedly burned for quite a while before we got our first call 
because it had already gone through the roof when the first unit got on the 
scene," Taylor said. The roof collapsed, requiring extra precautions to be 
taken because several hundred gallons of toxic chemicals, mostly for use in 
photocopy machines, were stored inside, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
District officials estimated the damage and loss of supplies and equipment 
stored in the building at about $2 million but said the figure could go higher. 
</P>
<P>
Instructional materials, including thousands of textbooks and hundreds of 
educational films used at the district's 26 schools, were destroyed, said 
Associate Supt. Allan Jacobs. Food for the district's cafeterias was also 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
But school officials said the biggest loss was of student records, which, they 
said, date to 1890, when the district was formed. Student records from 1985 to 
the present are kept at the individual schools. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs said that although the district may have duplicates of some old student 
records, others would be irreplaceable. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said a number of local businesses have offered to help the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Beth Wolford, assistant superintendent for business and property 
management, said the district will "be working with our insurance firm to 
decide what we are going to do long-range. It will probably take a year to 18 
months to rebuild another facility." 
</P>
<P>
Wolford said the district's purchasing and food service departments will work 
with the warehouse staff to determine the district's needs over the next few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a tough year for the district, which recently underwent $8 million 
in budget cuts that included dozens of layoffs. Several top administrators also 
have left the district in the last few months, including Supt. John Duncan. 
Duncan, who served as chief administrator of the district for 16 years, 
resigned in September to head a school district in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
The district is still recovering from two fires at schools this year. A fire in 
April at Park View Center School, a training facility for teachers and 
administrators, caused $250,000 in damage. The fire was blamed on faulty 
wiring. 
</P>
<P>
An arson at Madera Elementary in August caused $150,000 in damage.

The Union Label: Crew members on "Twin Peaks" are working under a union 
contract for the first time starting this week, as a newly negotiated agreement 
with the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employees begins to 
take effect. The contract, which covers make-up artists, photographers, film 
editors and stagehands, was negotiated just hours before the union was to have 
struck the set of "Twin Peaks," as well as ABC television offices in Los 
Angeles and New York. The union had been the only labor organization left out 
when Lynch/Frost Productions initially negotiated contracts for "Twin Peaks."

However, a network spokesman said the series will remain in production and will 
return to the schedule later this season. An announcement about a replacement 
series is expected later this week. "The Company" which stars Anthony Denison 
and Linda Purl as CIA agents trying to strike a balance between their marriage

An old Middle East flash point flared again Tuesday as five Israeli soldiers 
were killed in southern Lebanon in a clash with Palestinian guerrillas, and, a 
few hours later, Israeli jets bombarded Palestinian bases in the volatile 
neighboring country. 
</P>
<P>
The jet raids were not in retaliation for the killings, Israeli officials said, 
but part of "routine operations" in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Two Palestinians were killed during the midnight gunfight with Israeli troops, 
part of a contingent that routinely patrols Israel's so-called security zone, a 
buffer strip inside Lebanon along Israel's northern border. 
</P>
<P>
The bloodshed highlighted concern in Israel that a shifting balance of power in 
Lebanon will spill into the militarized zone, which is designed to thwart 
guerrilla attacks on Israel. While much of the world has been watching the 
Persian Gulf, Israel has been expanding its military operations in Lebanon to 
limit the threat it perceives from the north. 
</P>
<P>
The clash in Lebanon came amid turmoil on Israel's other borders. On Sunday, 
three soldiers and a civilian were shot and killed by an Egyptian border guard 
in southern Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The hostile atmosphere results from several factors, Israeli analysts say. 
Passions among Muslims in Israel and abroad have flared since the October 
killing of 20 Palestinians by police at Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque. 
</P>
<P>
Arab grass-roots support for Saddam Hussein in his confrontation with the 
United States and its allies in the Persian Gulf is also reflected in the 
border turmoil, especially in Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
In Lebanon, Syria's crackdown on Christian militias in Beirut and the expulsion 
of Shiite Muslims from the city is also shaking up the military panorama. 
Israeli officials have expressed concern that militias shifting to the south 
will challenge Israel's control of the buffer strip. 
</P>
<P>
Israel relies on the South Lebanon Army, an allied Christian militia, to 
dominate the zone, but the defeat of Christians in Beirut is said to have 
demoralized the SLA. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be new pressures. The SLA took inspiration from the Christian 
resistance in Beirut, and now that is gone," said Israeli army spokesman Moshe 
Fogel. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Israel announced a policy to permit its troops to make forays north 
of the buffer zone in order to head off hostile units before they reach 
Israeli-controlled Lebanese territory. The policy was revealed after an army 
officer was killed in a battle north of the strip. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to do is push the terrorists as far as possible from the 
Lebanese border," said Gen. Yossi Peled, commander of Israel's northern region. 
</P>
<P>
Commented a Western diplomat: "In essence, Israel will be creating a firing 
zone to protect the strip itself." 
</P>
<P>
The Western observer and Israeli analysts predict that Israel will increase air 
raids to supplement ground forays if the government perceives a buildup of 
hostile forces north of the buffer strip. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Israeli jets swooped down on a base belonging to the Democratic 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, another PLO faction, and a camp 
belonging to the Revolutionary Council of Fatah, a breakaway Palestinian group 
headed by terrorist Abu Nidal. Both targets are east of Sidon. 
</P>
<P>
Jets fired rockets on a military base and nearby positions, reports from 
Lebanon said, flattening buildings and starting fires. Israeli jets have raided 
Lebanon 17 times this year. 
</P>
<P>
The ground battle Tuesday took place within the buffer zone near the village of 
Shebaa, Israeli officials said. Shebaa is located at the eastern end of a main 
infiltration route to the south. 
</P>
<P>
There were several conflicting reports of how the soldiers died. The army gave 
at least three versions: They were killed in an exchange of rifle fire; a 
Palestinian played possum and then threw a grenade at the troops as they 
approached; a grenade blew up in the hand of a wounded Israeli. 
</P>
<P>
Another report said that a Palestinian corpse was booby-trapped. 
</P>
<P>
After Syria cleared Christian opponents of Lebanon's central government out of 
Beirut, the beneficiary of the move, Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, made it 
clear that he wants Israel out of the south and its militia disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
Israel is eyeing with suspicion Hrawi's plans to put his army in the town of 
Jezzine, at the northern edge of the security strip, as part of an effort to 
extend control over the whole country. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens blamed Syria for the stepped-up attacks in 
Lebanon and said, without elaboration, that warming relations between Damascus 
and Washington "could be a factor" in Syria's actions. 
</P>
<P>
A Syrian-backed group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command, was the target of an Israeli air raid Nov. 1. On 
Saturday, an Israeli patrol boat sank a dinghy off the southern Lebanese coast, 
killing five guerrillas of the group, which is headed by Ahmed Jibril. The next 
day, a woman belonging to another pro-Damascus splinter group tried to wipe out 
an Israeli patrol with a bomb but blew herself up instead.

SANCTIONS: THE CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTER IS INVITED TO WASHINGTON AS THE 
ADMINISTRATION SEEKS BEIJING'S BACKING ON U.N. VOTE AGAINST IRAQ.

The Bush Administration, which is seeking China's backing for a new U.N. 
resolution against Iraq, on Tuesday substantially eased the ban on high-level 
meetings between U.S. and Chinese officials that was imposed after the 1989 
massacre in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department announced that Secretary of State James A. Baker III has 
invited Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to Washington on Friday, where 
Qian will be the highest-ranking Chinese visitor in the past 18 months. U.S. 
officials also left open the possibility that Qian will meet with President 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
For months, U.S. China scholars and experts had been predicting that the 
Administration would loosen its sanctions against Beijing soon after the U.S. 
congressional elections. Administration officials insisted Tuesday that they 
are not abandoning the sanctions adopted after China crushed the pro-democracy 
movement at Tian An Men Square in June, 1989. But they gave the ban on 
high-level exchanges a much narrower interpretation than previously. 
</P>
<P>
"We're being tentative," one Administration official explained. "We want to try 
to give them a little and then watch." 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the Washington visit by Qian Qichen (pronounced Chien 
Chee-chun) came only days after authorities in China charged two pro-democracy 
activists with counterrevolution and sedition -- crimes punishable by long 
prison sentences or even death. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the Bush Administration's action) must cause deep disappointment among the 
Chinese people," Liu Binyan, a leading Chinese writer and dissident, said in an 
interview Tuesday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of the American human rights group Asia 
Watch, said the Bush Administration's invitation to Qian sends a message that 
"continued cooperation in the (Persian) Gulf can bring an end to international 
criticism and isolation, no matter how severely China abuses the rights of its 
own citizens." 
</P>
<P>
The State Department also confirmed Tuesday that Baker will meet with Cuban 
Foreign Minister Isidoro O. Malmierca in New York City later this week, the 
highest-level meeting between the United States and Cuba in two years. Cuba, 
one of the 15 members of the Security Council, generally has opposed U.S. 
policy in the gulf. The council is expected to vote later this week on a 
resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
As one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, China has 
the power to veto council resolutions. State Department spokesman Richard 
Boucher noted Tuesday that "to date, China has consistently held to the 
Security Council consensus on the gulf crisis and has voted for every one of 
the 10 U.N. Security Council resolutions in response to Iraq's continuing 
aggression." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Baker's invitation to Qian amounted to a payoff for China's vote 
on a new U.N. resolution authorizing force against Iraq, Boucher replied: 
"China's vote . . . will be based on its own national-interest determination." 
</P>
<P>
Since August, China has criticized Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. But it has also 
often emphasized that it opposes the use of force by superpowers in the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
Most diplomats, scholars and U.S. officials have said they believe China would 
not veto a U.N. resolution allowing the use of force against Iraq because the 
Beijing regime needs foreign loans, trade and investment and does not want to 
jeopardize its efforts to improve ties with the United States and other Western 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration's sanctions against meetings with Chinese leaders date 
back to June 20, 1989, two weeks after the massacre in Beijing, when Baker 
announced on Capitol Hill that the Administration was suspending talks between 
officials of the U.S. and Chinese governments at the level of assistant 
secretary or higher. 
</P>
<P>
Only two weeks later, the Administration dispatched National Security Adviser 
Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger to 
Beijing on the first of two secret missions aimed at smoothing ties with the 
Chinese leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials argued that the Scowcroft missions did not violate the 
policy because it applied only to "exchanges" between the two governments -- 
that is, official visits to each other's capitals. 
</P>
<P>
Baker himself has met with the Chinese foreign minister four times over the 
last 18 months. But the sessions were restricted to foreign capitals or the 
United Nations and were aimed largely at discussing Cambodia or the Persian 
Gulf.

"Haole go home." That's Hawaii's version of "Yankee go home." And Haunani-Kay 
Trask, a professor at the University of Hawaii, thinks it's a reasonable idea. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent article in the school newspaper, she urged a student who had 
publicly lamented "Caucasian-bashing" in Hawaii to move back to his home state 
of Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
"Hawaiians would certainly benefit from one less haole (white) in our land," 
wrote Trask, who is part Hawaiian. 
</P>
<P>
Her remarks touched a raw nerve in a state that prides itself as a Pacific 
"melting pot," where the "aloha spirit" of love and tolerance is supposed to 
prevail. The article set off a raging debate on racism and free speech that has 
engulfed the university and spilled off campus. Passionate letters, denouncing 
or defending Trask, fill the local papers.

The professor contends her remarks are appropriate given the history of 
oppression of native Hawaiians at the hands of Caucasians. Her people, she 
says, lost their health, culture and land through contact with Westerners, and 
they are still struggling to recover. 
</P>
<P>
"Hawaiians have a right to resent haoles (pronounced how-lees)," she said in an 
interview. "We have a historical right. We have a contemporary right." 
</P>
<P>
And whether people agree or not, Trask, and her supporters, defend her right to 
speak her mind. The university, they say, is the best place to air ideas. At a 
rally for Trask this month, supporters carried signs reading, "Free Speech for 
Natives" and "White is Not Right." The professors' union and the Women's 
Studies Department passed resolutions upholding her right to speak out. 
</P>
<P>
But other faculty members and observers accuse Trask of abusing her position 
and creating a "climate of intimidation" on campus. The philosophy department 
has asked that she be reprimanded and its chairman, Larry Laudan, has called 
for her removal as director of the university's Center for Hawaiian Studies. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that the principle of academic freedom gives faculty members 
a hunting license to harass or intimidate individual students for their race, 
sex or beliefs," Laudan said. 
</P>
<P>
The student whose column, "Being Haole in Hawaii," irritated Trask, dropped out 
of school last month. Contacted in Berkeley, while he was checking out schools 
he might attend in California, philosophy major Joey Carter said the 
controversy had become distracting. 
</P>
<P>
"It just wasn't that comfortable on campus. People were constantly coming up to 
me asking questions about it," said Carter, 32. " . . . I didn't get any direct 
threats, but I was getting people saying they knew someone looking for me, 
wanting to bust my face." 
</P>
<P>
His column highlighted a subject seldom aired seriously: racism in Hawaii. No 
ethnic group constitutes a majority in Hawaii, and the state has a reputation 
for harmony among its peoples. The largest ethnic group is white, 34%. 
Hawaiians make up 12% of the islands' population. Other large groups include 
Japanese, 25%; Filipino, 14%, and Chinese, 6%. 
</P>
<P>
Forty percent of marriages each year are interracial, according to state 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
But there are tensions. 
</P>
<P>
In his article, Carter said he had been chased and beaten by "groups of locals 
who have been taught that I am the cause of their problems, taught to hate or 
fear my skin, hair and eye colors." 
</P>
<P>
Carter, a 10-year Hawaii resident, says he considers people here "a lot more 
accepting than other places," but he wrote the article because discussions of 
racism on campus always focused on "white dominance." 
</P>
<P>
Trask, however, dismisses Carter's comments as "uninformed, childish 
bemoaning." The real racism in Hawaii, she says, is the white domination of a 
native people. She mourns the decimation of the Hawaiian population through 
disease introduced by white settlers and "cultural destruction." In her 
article, she points to the American overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893 
and the forcible annexation of the islands in 1898. 
</P>
<P>
"With the overthrow, things Hawaiian were outlawed and things haole American 
were imposed," she wrote. "As an American in Hawaii, Mr. Carter is benefiting 
from stolen goods." 
</P>
<P>
"All I am saying, is 'You're an interloper"' she explained later.'If you don't 
like it, get out.' I don't think it's racist at all." 
</P>
<P>
Trask, 41, calls the reaction to her article a symptom of racism against 
Hawaiians. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason they get so upset is because it's a native woman saying it to the 
dominant white class," said Trask, who wears a kikepa (Hawaiian-style sarong) 
rather than Western dress. "I break the ideology of happy natives and that 
makes me dangerous."

After a day at the Russian Federation Congress that had gone his way and half 
an hour of friendly chatting with reporters and Russian lawmakers, Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was in a jovial mood. 
</P>
<P>
Told that entrepreneurs were selling jokes about him for a hefty profit, the 
Soviet president was moved to mention that he had heard a good one lately -- 
but could not tell it because there were women in the crowd crushed around him. 
</P>
<P>
"We give our permission," one said authoritatively. 
</P>
<P>
"You permit it?" Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
Then he hemmed and hawed a moment, and recited: 
</P>
<P>
"President Mitterrand has, they say, 100 lovers, and one has AIDS, but he 
doesn't know which one. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush has 100 bodyguards, and one of them is a terrorist, but he 
doesn't know who it is. 
</P>
<P>
"And Gorbachev has 100 economists, and only one of them has any brains, and he, 
too, doesn't know which one." 
</P>
<P>
He paused for a moment, to let the laughter subside. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked that one," he said.

MILITANT NATIONALISTS WON'T GET NUCLEAR ARMS, SOVIETS PROMISE

Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov assured his nation and the world 
Tuesday that nuclear weapons will never get into the hands of the country's 
increasingly militant nationalists as more powers are given to local 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech delivered on orders from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, 
Yazov pledged the military's loyalty to Gorbachev and to his reform agenda, an 
evident attempt to spike persistent rumors of preparations for a coup. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-million-member Soviet armed forces, undergoing intense change because of 
Gorbachev's policies, "have been, are and will be true to the course of 
perestroika that is being carried out under the direction of the president of 
the U.S.S.R," Yazov said. 
</P>
<P>
If supplies and utilities are cut off by local authorities, Yazov said, army 
and navy commanders have now been given orders to seize local "life support 
systems" and put them under guard. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the president told reporters he had signed an order that 
will allow military units to use their firearms if they or their posts are 
attacked by armed nationalist bands, as has happened frequently in the 
Caucasus.

YELTSIN AND GORBACHEV CLASH AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: ANOTHER UNEASY COMPROMISE EMERGES AS A NEW TREATY COMES BEFORE 
THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION PARLIAMENT.

In the latest round of the rivalry at the pinnacle of Soviet power, President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's allies nearly wrecked Russian Federation leader Boris N. 
Yeltsin's plans for a key parliamentary session Tuesday, but the two managed to 
forge yet another uneasy compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The Yeltsin-Gorbachev clash was played out before nearly 900 members of the 
Russian Federation Parliament, and the stakes were high, potentially deciding 
the fate of the union treaty Gorbachev is now pushing to the country's 15 
constitutent republics with all his political might. 
</P>
<P>
"Without Russia, there is no (Soviet) Union, this should be perfectly clear," 
Gorbachev told reporters during a break in the session which, as a guest, he 
observed from the balcony of the ornate Great Kremlin Palace. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, however, insisted that the Russian Parliament, of which he is 
chairman, had convened to discuss the food crisis and land reform, not the 
treaty, which Gorbachev officially presented last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Only when deputy after deputy took to the floor to demand that the treaty be 
addressed did Yeltsin finally call a break and work out a compromise with 
Gorbachev: that the Russian Parliament, officially known as the Russian 
Congress of People's Deputies, would hold an "exchange of opinions" on the 
union treaty. He implied that it would take no final decision. 
</P>
<P>
Russia's verdict on Gorbachev's treaty proposal, which four republics already 
have flatly rejected, will decide its fate, and thus the future of the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't accept this conception (of the federal treaty), it means the 
collapse of the country," Gorbachev told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yeltsin was pulling in the opposite direction, telling the lawmakers 
that although he does not seek confrontation with the national government, he 
would not allow it to usurp powers that rightfully are the domain of the 
Russian Federation government. 
</P>
<P>
"Russia delegates a whole set of functions to the center," he said, his deep 
voice booming through the long hall. "But we cannot acquiesce when they 
interfere in affairs that we are best able to decide ourselves, better than 
anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Gorbachev clashed earlier this year on the Russian Federation's 
right to create its own independent state bank, as well as its claim to the 
vast riches of gold, diamonds, oil and other valuable resources on its 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
After a long tete-a-tete Nov. 11, Yeltsin and Gorbachev agreed to create a 
commission to decide how to divide power and resources between the central 
government and Yeltsin's Russian Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two weeks later, however, Gorbachev griped at a news conference that 
although his program and Yeltsin's were 80% identical, Yeltsin seemed intent on 
criticizing and trying to torpedo his every move. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, for his part, snubbed Gorbachev by failing to announce to the 
Parliament that the Soviet president was attending. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev disclosed another cause for rancor Tuesday when he told reporters 
that he had only just begun reading the draft of the new Russian Federation 
constitution in the newspaper because no one had sent it to him personally. 
</P>
<P>
He also objected to a cartoon he had seen likening him to the Russian czar and 
other insinuations that he was out to increase his personal power. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm amazed by these people if, after six years, they still suspect me of 
dictatorship and monarchism," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His main theme, however -- which he returned to again and again during 
impromptu chats in the lobby of the Great Kremlin Palace -- was the proposed 
union treaty and his fear that the Soviet Union could split up. 
</P>
<P>
Even the food crisis, the main subject of the Russian Parliament, stemmed 
largely from the Soviet Union's growing inter-republic strife, he said, with 
regions refusing to send foodstuffs across republic lines. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Western food contributions that have begun arriving in the Soviet 
Union will reach their targets rather than rotting in train depots like many 
Soviet shipments, Gorbachev assured deputies and reporters that the government 
is working out a system of distribution. 
</P>
<P>
He said, "The main thing, however, is the modernization of Soviet light 
industry, the creation of our own base, and all our Western partners want to 
participate in that," largely by supplying equipment for food processing 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also focused on the food question that now dominates Soviet media and 
public discussion. Extended rationing is expected next month in Leningrad, and 
other cities have complained that they have reserves for only a few days. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin called on the lawmakers to approve a land reform program that would 
bring radical changes to the impoverished peasants living on the Russian lands 
that occupy two-thirds of Soviet territory. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the central government's milder land reform, it would allow the eventual 
sale and purchase of land and give substantial aid to private farmers who 
decide to strike out on their own. 
</P>
<P>
"How and with what to feed the people -- today, that's the most important 
thing," Yeltsin said. "We have been convinced by our own bitter experience that 
even the deepest truths and greatest values of world civilization don't take 
root in a country where people are fighting for a piece of bread." 
</P>
<P>
Along with approving the land reform and other food measures, the Parliament is 
scheduled to vote on major benefits for rural residents aimed at stemming the 
exodus from the Soviet countryside that has contributed to the dearth of farm 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
Its original agenda also included discussion of a new constitution for the 
Russian Federation, but Yeltsin said this will be postponed to give the public 
more time to discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
Several deputies, however, said Yeltsin backed the postponement because it 
appeared that the draft constitution, a decidedly Western-style document, did 
not have the votes to pass in a Parliament still heavily weighted toward 
Communist conservatives.

A businessman who was helping another man with a stalled car was killed when a 
runaway dump truck crashed into a parking lot, struck the car and covered him 
in tons of steaming asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
Truck driver Terry Conner told police he was approaching a busy intersection 
Monday when an indicator showed a loss of brake pressure. "His only option was 
to run into the traffic at the light or turn off into the parking lot," Officer 
Steve Tinder said.

The truck crashed into a bank parking lot, striking three cars before dumping 
the asphalt and tipping over. The asphalt engulfed Charles H. Sprankle, 71,

STUDY FINDS DRUG TEST VALUE EXAGGERATED; 
</P>
<P>
EMPLOYMENT: AS EXPECTED, WORKERS WHO TESTED POSITIVE BEFORE HIRING HAVE MORE 
INJURIES AND ABSENCES. BUT THE RATES ARE FAR LOWER THAN EARLIER ESTIMATES.

People who test positive on pre-employment drug screening are more likely to 
have work-related problems than those who test negative, but the benefits of 
the controversial screening programs have been exaggerated, according to a 
study of 2,537 Boston postal workers published in today's Journal of the 
American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers found "an association" between a positive drug test for marijuana 
or cocaine and problems such as industrial accidents, injuries and absenteeism, 
but the relationship "is more modest than what people seem to want to hear," 
said Dr. Craig Zwerling of the University of Iowa. Zwerling, the principal 
author of the study, previously worked as a physician for the U.S. Postal 
Service in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Others said the figures in the report are substantial and support the need for 
pre-employment drug screening. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that the 7.8% of postal employees with marijuana-positive 
urine samples had 55% more industrial accidents and 78% more absences when 
compared to other employees. The 2.2% of postal employees with cocaine-positive 
urine samples had 145% more absences and 85% more injuries. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, these percentages are far lower than earlier 
estimates, publicized in scientific journals in the mid-1980s, that workers who 
use drugs are involved in 200% to 300% more industrial accidents, sustain 400% 
more compensable injuries and use 1,500% more sick leave than workers who do 
not use drugs. 
</P>
<P>
This led the researchers to conclude that "many of the claims cited to justify 
pre-employment drug screening have been exaggerated." 
</P>
<P>
"It seems a little ludicrous to me that we spend loads of money to find the 
marijuana user in the employee population and we largely ignore the serious 
drug abuse problem in the criminal population," said Eric D. Wish, a 
substance-abuse researcher at the University of Maryland. Wish wrote an 
editorial for the medical journal on the study. 
</P>
<P>
Others took a different view. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if you take the lowest numbers, they are still significant," said 
Jonathan Segal, a management attorney with Wolf, Block, Schorr &amp; 
Solis-Cohen in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers "are substantial," said Joel S. Trosch, an assistant postmaster 
general. "The results of the study support (pre-employment) drug screening" by 
the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last several years, an increasing number of companies, including The 
Times, have established mandatory pre-employment drug screening programs. 
Typically, job applicants who test positive for drugs without a valid medical 
reason are not hired. 
</P>
<P>
The new study is one of the first to scrutinize the effectiveness of the 
practice. The researchers note that earlier estimates of the problems caused by 
drug-abusing employees were not based on solid data. 
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted between 1986 and 1989, was a "blind study," which means 
employees, hiring officials, medical personnel and management officials were 
not informed of the results of the urine drug screens and the test results had 
no effect on hiring decisions. The Postal Service has since instituted a 
national policy of pre-employment screening. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, urine drug screens were performed on nearly 5,000 applicants for 
postal jobs. Positive tests were confirmed by additional testing. 
</P>
<P>
The work performance of individuals who were hired, including absence rate, 
work-related injuries and accidents, disciplinary actions and terminations, 
were followed for an average of 406 days. 
</P>
<P>
"Those with marijuana-positive urine samples had increased risks of 
termination, accidents, injuries and discipline compared with those with 
negative urine samples," the report said. The results for those with 
cocaine-positive urine samples were similar, except that these individuals were 
not at increased risk of being fired. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service has subsequently confirmed these findings in tests conducted 
at 21 sites around the country, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
A key shortcoming of the study is that it did not take into account the 
possible role of alcohol abuse, in addition to drug use, in poor work 
performance. The researchers did not perform blood or urine tests that might 
have detected alcohol abuse. They also did not ask job applicants about alcohol 
because they thought the applicants were unlikely for give accurate 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Zwerling said the study was not meant to tell companies whether to perform 
pre-employment drug screening, but to "provide an empirical background" for 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Segal, the management attorney, said that as more employers establish testing 
programs, companies that do not test "run the risk of attracting a higher 
percentage of employees who use drugs. . . . Job applicants know which 
companies test and which don't."

Forty-three deer have been shot and killed in the past two months in an effort 
to keep the animals off the runways at Orlando International Airport, 
authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
Three commercial airliners have hit free roaming deer this fall, but there have 
been no injuries to people or damage to the planes. 
</P>
<P>
The airport hired a consultant in early October to trap and move deer because 
the animals were a hazard when they wandered onto runways from nearby woods. 
But after a Delta jet struck a deer on takeoff Oct. 7, the consultant was paid 
$100 a deer to kill the animals.

SURGEON DRAWS JAIL TERM, $1-MILLION FINE FOR THEFT 
</P>

<P>
A Coronado heart surgeon was sentenced to six months in jail, fined $1 million 
and placed on five years' probation after pleading guilty Tuesday to the theft 
of 70 rare coins from a prestigious Manhattan coin society. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Juan Suros XII appeared in a New York City courtroom and pleaded guilty to 
a count of grand larceny. The conviction is a felony and may jeopardize Suros' 
California medical license. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the state Board of Medical Quality Assurance have said they will 
investigate Suros' conduct. Earlier this month, a board official told The Times 
that if disciplinary action is taken it could range from a public reprimand to 
revocation of Suros' license. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plea-bargain agreement with New York prosecutors, Suros, 49, will serve 
his jail sentence at the Descanso honor camp in San Diego County begining Jan. 
13. 
</P>
<P>
The $1-million fine includes $160,000 in reparation to the American Numismatic 
Society, the owner of the coins. The $1 million will be paid in yearly 
installments of $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Suros and his New York attorney, Don Birnbaum, were not available for comment 
and have declined interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for the New York district attorney, said the jail 
sentence and fine were required by New York law. The fine reflects the value of 
the stolen coins, all of which were recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Suros had argued that the value of the stolen coins was only 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Angry officials at the numismatic society told prosecutors the theft of the 
coins had caused them irreparable harm. 
</P>
<P>
"In the course of his depredations, Suros created a mess that can never be 
wholly untangled," chief curator William E. Metcalf said in a letter to 
prosecutors. " . . . The damage to the society's good will is, by definition, 
incalculable." 
</P>
<P>
Suros was a member of the numismatic society when he was arrested on April 15, 
1989, at the exclusive Harvard Club in Manhattan by New York City detectives. A 
search of his briefcase revealed 13 stolen coins. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police found 57 stolen coins, most of them rare Spanish and Mexican 
pieces, among a collection of 2,000 coins when they searched Suros' home and 
office. 
</P>
<P>
As a member and benefactor of the society, Suros was allowed to handle coin 
trays when he visited the group's office. Police said curators began to notice 
in February, 1989, that coins would disappear every time Suros handled the 
trays. 
</P>
<P>
Suros, who graduated from the University of Barcelona in Spain, also uses the 
name Juan XII, Count of Besalu. He is board-certified in cardiovascular and 
thoracic surgery and has an office in Chula Vista.

2 TOP COMMAND POSITIONS FILLED BY SHERIFF-ELECT; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: ROACHE APPOINTS JAY LASUER TO DEPARTMENT'S NO. 2 POST AND 
MAUDIE BOBBITT TO DIRECT ACTIVITIES OF DEPUTIES IN THE FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Sheriff-elect Jim Roache moved quickly Tuesday in naming two of the four top 
administrators who will help him lead the department for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
Roache selected Sheriff's Capt. Jay LaSuer as his undersheriff, the No. 2 
administrator in command of the 1,349-member Sheriff's Department, and Capt. 
Maudie Bobbitt as his assistant sheriff in charge of law enforcement services. 
Bobbitt will replace Jack Drown, whom Roache defeated in the runoff election 
for sheriff three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Roache said he is going to conduct a nationwide search for an assistant sheriff 
to run the jails. And he has not yet named an assistant sheriff for 
administrative services, although he is believed to have offered the job to 
Melvin Nichols, 50, who has been with the department 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols, the department's commander for jail operations, was ill Tuesday and 
could not be reached for comment. Roache would not confirm that Nichols had 
been offered the job. 
</P>
<P>
The four administrators report directly to Roache and serve at his discretion. 
All other employees in the Sheriff's Department are protected by the Civil 
Service system. 
</P>
<P>
Although he had hoped to make his appointments next month, Roache said he found 
he is too busy building his new administration and desperately needs help. 
Although those in the department he has selected still must do their jobs until 
Roache is sworn in Jan. 7, they will be expected to attend morning, lunch and 
evening meetings on Roache's behalf, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many things that need to be done, that it is physically 
impossible for me to gather all the data I need by myself," he said. "I needed 
to identify people to assist me in these tasks." 
</P>
<P>
LaSuer, 50, who has been a captain at the Poway station for 4 1/2 years, 
preceded Bobbitt as captain in the El Cajon jail. A member of the Sheriff's 
Department for 21 years, LaSuer spent about three years at the jail and was a 
lieutenant at the regional training academy operated by the Sheriff's 
Department. He spent 4 1/2 years as a lieutenant and sergeant at a substation 
in Otay. He also worked in Lemon Grove and Santee. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, LaSuer won a seat on the La Mesa City Council. LaSuer would 
not comment about the appointment, which is to be made officially at a Roache 
press conference today at the County Administration Building. 
</P>
<P>
The undersheriff serves as the department's chief of staff and runs the 
day-to-day operations of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt, 43, has been with the department 21 years and is one of only two 
female captains in an agency that is 17% female. A year ago, she was suspended 
for 35 days for her connection with the so-called "Rambo Squad," a group of 
deputies that the county grand jury concluded had harassed and abused inmates 
in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Ten members of the department were disciplined. Bobbitt's suspension was 
revoked last month by the county's Civil Service Commission. But Sheriff John 
Duffy said he was reopening the investigation into Bobbitt's role at the jail 
and would reinstate the suspension or worse if it was discovered that she or 
others violated the civil rights of inmates. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Duffy said he was reopening the probe after her Bobbitt's husband, 
attorney Everett Bobbitt, filed legal papers raising allegations that Duffy and 
other top administrators "condoned or encouraged the mistreatment" of inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Everett and Maudie Bobbitt were enthusiastic Roache supporters and served on a 
small transition team assembled after Roache's election. Everett Bobbitt is 
representing Roache on the legal question of who controls money and property 
the Sheriff's Department seizes in drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
Maudie Bobbitt will become the department's first female assistant sheriff. She 
is the captain at the department's Santee station and was head of the El Cajon 
jail from 1986 to 1988. She was once a lieutenant in Santee and started the 
department's juvenile services unit, which investigates child abuse and other 
juvenile problems. 
</P>
<P>
As the head of law enforcement services, Bobbitt will be in charge of all 
patrol stations and the investigations, narcotics, homicide and vice divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Whoever Roache chooses to run the jails will have to help establish a 
corrections division, which will use correctional officers rather than sworn 
deputies in the county's six jails. 
</P>
<P>
Having a corrections division will save the department money, Roache said, 
because correctional officers do not require the extensive training that 
deputies do. 
</P>
<P>
Roache said he has asked county personnel administrators to help him conduct 
the nationwide search. He said that Sheriff's Department employees also can 
apply for the job. Roache said he has offered an interim job to someone inside 
the department until a permanent replacement is hired. The offer is still being 
considered, Roache said. 
</P>
<P>
The department has had repeated problems in the jails over the years, including 
allegations by inmates and jail visitors of abuse and harassment. The county 
has been forced to pay out large jury verdicts in some of those cases. 
</P>
<P>
The administrative services job believed to have been offered to Nichols 
includes oversight of the department's financial matters, payroll, purchasing, 
records, personnel and training. 
</P>
<P>
Former San Diego Police Chief Ray Hoobler, who served on Roache's transition 
team, said it was important for Roache to name his administrators quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he probably recognized that he had to get his team up and running, and 
that he would be getting no help" from Duffy, Hoobler said. 
</P>
<P>
Roache has yet to name three special assistants who serve the sheriff: one in 
charge of legal affairs, one in charge of legislative affairs and one in charge 
of special affairs. 
</P>
<P>
A reform candidate who campaigned on a pledge to clean out the Duffy 
administration, Roache is ousting four veteran officers when he is sworn in 
Jan. 7. Besides Drown, Undersheriff Richard Sandberg and assistant sheriffs 
Richard Reed and Charles Wigginton are being replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Roache said his new team is being chosen on the basis of "diversity of 
background, diversity of assignment history, the proper education and some 
particular skills relative to the commands they will be responsible to."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: BRODERICK CASE IN LIMBO BUT THE LEGAL BATTLES CONTINUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Superior Court, Betty Broderick appears headed for retrial. 
</P>
<P>
Once again she can portray Dan Broderick as a cruel father and treacherous 
husband who pushed her to violence. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the San Diego County Bar Assn., as part of its overall building fund 
drive, has gathered $50,000 from lawyers and others for its Daniel T. Broderick 
III Memorial Fund. 
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to refurbish a meeting room to be renamed in Broderick's 
honor at the association's headquarters in downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
An oil painting of Broderick may adorn the room. More than 100 big-name firms 
and practitioners have asked to be listed on a plaque as friends of Broderick. 
</P>
<P>
But a mild dissent to the Broderick memorial has now been raised from an 
unlikely source. 
</P>
<P>
Not from a feminist attorney or a criminal-defense lawyer, but rather from a 
49-year-old retired Air Force pilot turned San Diego business and tax lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the bar association magazine, Joseph E. Driscoll said that Dan 
Broderick's death was "the culmination of uncontrolled mental and physical 
violence" involving both parties. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, his professional competence is in question because of the 
domestic violence, all of which affected their children -- thus making 
debatable his compassion as a caring and loving father. So, what did we really 
know about him?" 
</P>
<P>
Driscoll, who has practiced in San Diego for two years, suggested that the 
Broderick fund be used to "assist all who suffer from domestic violence." 
</P>
<P>
In a response that was longer than Driscoll's letter, bar association President 
Virginia Nelson said that Broderick is being honored for his legal career. She 
also noted the bar's work with the Domestic Violence Prevention Program. 
</P>
<P>
Driscoll says he appreciated Nelson's response but that it did not satisfy his 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
He says he continues to be concerned about a profession that sometimes puts a 
higher value on courtroom victories than on morality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Things Never Change 
</P>
<P>
Locals only. 
</P>
<P>
* Crying Wolfe? 
</P>
<P>
As Times reporter John Glionna pointed out this week, San Diego surf-turf wars 
are as real today as they were when Tom Wolfe wrote about the Pump House Gang. 
</P>
<P>
If you believe Surfer magazine, the latest battle pits Point Loma locals 
against surf team members from Point Loma Nazarene College in the waves off 
Sunset Cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
Says a letter purportedly signed by one Pat (Smedley) Phillips: 
</P>
<P>
"Remember what you're getting into when you paddle out, and don't be a fool. 
Localism lives like soul surfing. And a special note to all you PLNC goons: 
Beware. . . . Take my advice and stay" away. 
</P>
<P>
* First the route of the San Diego Marathon, set for Dec. 9, was changed 
because the marathon could not get permission to run through Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Now the route of Saturday's 50-mile Glendale Federal Bank Holiday Bowl Bicycle 
Tour also has been changed. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, the bike tour has gone up the coast highway from La Jolla to 
Encinitas and back. This year it will loop through less-scenic Clairemont and 
Miramar instead. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the marathon, the bike tour did not get a turndown from Del Mar. But 
organizers decided to make the change anyway to avoid hassles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Out With the Odd 
</P>
<P>
In Lemon Grove, it's against the law to molest an elk. Also, pool halls in 
Lemon Grove must be equipped with spittoons. 
</P>
<P>
Both laws, musty leftovers from the turn of the century, are being repealed 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
I know this because of San Diego attorney Vaughan de Kirby, whose specialties 
include finding the absurdities of the law. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he discovered that San Francisco has a leash law for elephants. 
</P>
<P>
De Kirby tried to see if San Diego has a similar rule. He was told he would 
have to bring a test case to determine if the city ordinance applies. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we'll never know. I don't have access to an elephant."

REAGAN GETS PRESIDENTIAL TREATMENT ON SON'S RADIO SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For other radio talk show hosts, it might have been a coup -- having former 
President Ronald Reagan alone in the radio booth for an hour. Imagine the 
possible fodder, not the least being the Iran-Contra affair, and whatever else 
callers might want to spring on him, live on the air, for a spontaneous and 
unrehearsed reaction. 
</P>
<P>
But clearly, Reagan wasn't exactly walking into treacherous territory Tuesday 
afternoon. Maybe it was the red, white and blue balloons that telegraphed 
friendly environs, or the similarly colored streamers hanging from the radio 
booth's window, or the "Welcome Mr. President" banners. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe it was the sense that he wouldn't be blindsided by his interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
"For the next hour," said the host, "we're going to be visiting with a man who 
was the 40th President of the United States, all because at one time, he was 
incapable of reading the morning news, at WOC in Davenport, Iowa. He'll be 
taking your phone calls. He's my father. I also call him Mr. President. Welcome 
to the show, sir." 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you, Mike. It's a pleasure to be here, to see where you carry on," the 
former radio broadcaster responded to his son. This was, after all, the first 
time Michael Reagan had landed his dad to be a guest on his KSDO-AM afternoon 
talk show. 
</P>
<P>
And so it was Tuesday, the Reagan-Reagan Show, father and son, one-on-one like 
some Thanksgiving dinner banter over old times, about as cutting and pointed as 
a high school newspaper reporter interviewing the principal. Son asked father 
if he had any favorites in the Notre Dame-USC football game. It was that kind 
of a show. 
</P>
<P>
It was a mix of warm-fuzzies and spleen venting over old adversaries, and what 
it wasn't was a call-in show. Over the hour, only four callers were put through 
-- reasonably tender and manageable calls that were easily fielded. 
</P>
<P>
Not that more people weren't trying. 
</P>
<P>
"People are calling (on the radio station's business phone lines) to leave 
messages for Ronald Reagan," a haggard telephone receptionist said to Executive 
Producer Gayle Falkenthal. "And they're staying on the phone. Do I have 
permission to hang up on them?" Other callers on the phone-in lines were put on 
hold at 2 o'clock, and by show's end, they were still holding. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Ronald Reagan talked to Michael Reagan about his summits with 
Soviet President Michael Gorbachev, the melting of the Iron Curtain, childhood 
memories, of working at Sears and getting a job on radio and, oh yeah, the 
President's dismally selling autobiography, "An American Life." 
</P>
<P>
He got somber discussing his decisions to send American servicemen and women to 
battle in Grenada and the death of Marines in Lebanon, and empathized with 
President Bush's handling of the Persian Gulf crisis. Give the Iraqis until 
Jan. 15, the former chief executive advised. 
</P>
<P>
About the only time the President got testy was when he recalled battling a 
Democratic Congress over deficit spending and the media for lying, he said, 
about the Iran-Contra affair and for casting him as "the President of the 
rich." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to burn down every journalist in the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the show, Reagan the son asked Reagan the elder about how he coped 
with one of his most trying days in office, with the Lebanon terrorism, Grenada 
and turmoil at home. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you get through it?" son asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you have to get through it," father answered. 
</P>
<P>
How about Margaret Thatcher's resignation as prime minister? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry about it, because I think she was one of the best things that has 
happened in England in years and years and years." 
</P>
<P>
As the hour neared its end, the younger Reagan picked one last call. He scanned 
his computer monitor to see which callers were on hold -- identified by first 
name, city and a synopsis of the topic the caller wanted to broach. 
</P>
<P>
One was on "choosing running-mates." Another was on "battle with cancer." Still 
another was on "budget deficit." And then there was "Iraq-U.N." Instead, the 
younger Reagan picked line 8. 
</P>
<P>
It was Mike, from Tierrasanta, who wanted to know the President's "greatest 
accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan answered: "I'll have to tell you. When I took office, I had a feeling 
the American people who had been told for such a long time before I got there 
that we had a malaise, that we were never going to be as good as we were 
before, that we had to gauge down and know we could never be as prosperous as 
we once were, I just had a feeling the American people were hungry for a 
spiritual revival, and this, I think, we succeeded in changing. . . . The 
American people (now) are patriotic, they believe in their country, they love 
their country, and they believe, once again, that ours is the best way of 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Reagan closed the show by quoting the boss's reaction to his father's 
first radio job audition. "He said, after your audition on WOC Radio, 'You done 
good, you big s.o.b.' " Both Reagans laughed. 
</P>
<P>
When the hour was over, as the elder Reagan was being escorted from the 
second-floor interview booth to his waiting limousine, his son caught up to him 
in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks, Dad!" Michael Reagan called out to his father. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you for having me on your show, son," Ronald Reagan answered. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks for not taking it over," Michael replied, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
They shook hands. Then they embraced. 
</P>
<P>
Then, just after the 3 o'clock news, KSDO-AM returned to the normalcy, with 
Bill Holland's "Money Talks" show, of T-bills and Fanny Maes and volatile 
stocks.

ROCKWELL TO PAY $280,000 FINE IN TOXIC WASTE CASE; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: A COMPANY OFFICIAL SAYS THE PAYMENT IS 'JUST TO SETTLE THE THING AND 
PUT IT BEHIND US.' STATE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS AT SANTA SUSANA AND CANOGA PARK 
SITES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rockwell International has agreed to pay a $280,000 fine to settle a state 
lawsuit alleging hazardous waste violations at the firm's Santa Susana Field 
Laboratory west of Chatsworth and its main Canoga Park plant, according to 
documents filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was filed simultaneously with a 31-page complaint in which the 
attorney general's office, on behalf of the California Department of Health 
Services, accused Rockwell of 27 violations of state and federal hazardous 
waste rules at the two sites. The sites are operated by Rockwell's Rocketdyne 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Each violation, if proven in a trial, could have brought a penalty of up to 
$25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Ken Alex characterized the $280,000 settlement as "a 
significant and substantial fine," but said it was "not in the top 10 of fines" 
meted out by the state for hazardous waste violations. 
</P>
<P>
"The conduct that was alleged and found . . . was also not in the top 10," Alex 
said, adding that Rockwell had been guilty of "serious but not extreme 
violations." 
</P>
<P>
In agreeing to the settlement, Rockwell did not admit guilt and said in a 
prepared statement that "a number of allegations in the complaint were without 
legal merit." 
</P>
<P>
"None of the counts constituted any type of danger whatsoever to employees or 
the neighboring communities," said Jennifer Crone, manager of water and waste 
programs for Rocketdyne. "We're settling with the department, without guilt, 
just to settle the thing and put it behind us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the agreement allows state officials to treat any future violations by 
Rockwell as repeat offenses for the purpose of assessing penalties. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was long expected. It was based on the results of a series of 
inspections conducted between June, 1989, and January, 1990. Some of the 
findings were publicized previously. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the charges did not involve waste releases but rather Rockwell's 
failure to obtain state permits for various waste storage, treatment and 
disposal operations. 
</P>
<P>
Alex said these were "serious violations" because "the permit is how the 
department controls the hazardous waste world, in essence." He said 
nonpermissible waste operations are difficult for the state to "control . . . 
because they don't know of their existence." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Alex said he did not believe any of the violations posed a direct 
risk to public health. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Susana lab, which occupies 2,668 acres of a rugged plateau in the 
Simi Hills southeast of Simi Valley, has been embroiled in controversy over the 
shutdown and cleanup of former nuclear operations there. However, most of the 
property is devoted to rocket testing for the government, and the lawsuit 
addressed the management of chemical rather than radioactive waste. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the complaint accused Rockwell of failing to meet deadlines 
at Santa Susana for closing former hazardous waste ponds; burning explosive 
waste without a permit; contaminating soil, which constituted improper 
disposal; failing to promptly report discovery of contaminated soil; and 
failing to provide the state with manifests for off-site shipments of hazardous 
wastes. 
</P>
<P>
At the Canoga Park plant at 6633 Canoga Ave., where Rockwell manufactures 
rocket engines, the company was accused of storing drums of hazardous waste for 
more than 90 days without a permit; failing to label several hazardous waste 
tanks; not maintaining adequate aisle space in the hazardous waste area; and 
improperly managing toxic beryllium-contaminated air filters.

STUDY BACKS INCLUSION OF 8,000 ACRES IN SANTA SUSANAS IN NEW STATE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight thousand acres north of the San Fernando Valley qualify for inclusion in 
a proposed state park because they have botanically diverse plant communities, 
natural scenic attributes and potential as a recreational area for populous Los 
Angeles County, a study released Tuesday concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The land, which is part of a proposed Santa Clarita Woodlands State Park, is 
"especially attractive because it is so close to a lot of people," said Lon 
Spharler, manager of park system planning for the state Department of Parks and 
Recreation, which prepared the study. "The next step will be to acquire the 
land. The big problem is going to be finding the funds for it." 
</P>
<P>
Park planners estimated the cost of buying the land from its 94 different 
owners at $44.1 million, or an average of $5,250 an acre. But no funds are 
presently available. 
</P>
<P>
The study, begun two years ago, is part of an effort by state Sen. Ed Davis 
(R-Santa Clarita) and local environmentalists to preserve the dense forests, 
sparkling waterfalls and abundant wildlife in the privately owned Santa Susana 
Mountains land between the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm elated that the professionals in the state Department of Parks and 
Recreation have determined that the area . . . is so significant that it 
deserves protection," said Davis, who released the study at a news conference 
at his Northridge office. 
</P>
<P>
Although only 6,000 acres were in the initial study, the department concluded 
that more than 8,000 acres in the area were valuable and should be acquired. 
</P>
<P>
The study said 2,700 acres in Rice, Wiley and Leaming canyons should be 
purchased first because they contain "the best wildlife habitats, the most 
extensive area with the greatest tree cover" and are the most scenic and 
accessible. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main interest is in acquiring a core for the project," Spharler said in a 
telephone interview from Sacramento. "Then, we'll have to work with the 
property owners one by one as funds become available to get the rest. It 
doesn't happen overnight." 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that it would take at least 10 years for the state to acquire most 
of the property. 
</P>
<P>
The study estimated that 9.5 million people who live within a 40-mile radius of 
the area would be served by the proposed park. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, a state agency that acquires land for parks, said the Santa Susana 
Mountains land is a critical link in the Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor that 
the conservancy is trying to create to encircle the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the conservancy purchased 145 acres at the foot of Towsley Canyon 
near Calgrove Boulevard and the Golden State Freeway as a first step toward 
creating the state park. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy's board will vote on whether to buy 271 additional acres of 
Towsley Canyon land at its meeting Monday, Edmiston said. If that purchase is 
approved, he said, the conservancy would still have about $10 million available 
to purchase what he called key access areas into the proposed park. 
</P>
<P>
"There will have to be another funding source," Edmiston said. "But we have 
pretty much tied up the access points."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISORS SUPPORT OLIVE VIEW SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday endorsed a $3-million 
settlement with two firms for defects in the design of Olive View Medical 
Center in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
The county filed a lawsuit against four firms in 1986 after officials 
discovered that the nearly completed county hospital was riddled with design 
flaws. 
</P>
<P>
It cost the county $4.8 million to correct the problems, according to records. 
</P>
<P>
The two firms that reached a settlement with the county are Syska &amp; 
Hennessey Inc. and Welton Becket Associates Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The other two defendants haven't settled their cases. 
</P>
<P>
Problems cited by the county included a sophisticated exhaust system that did 
not work properly and a miscalculation on how much hot and cold water would be 
needed to heat and cool the medical facility. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed settlement must still be approved by the Los Angeles County Health 
Facilities Authority.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FARM WILL APPEAL BAN ON CHRISTMAS TREE SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cicero Farms will return to court to try to persuade an appellate judge to lift 
the ban on its Christmas tree sales at Pierce College in Woodland Hills, 
attorney Harold Kippen said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge issued a temporary restraining order Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said Joe Cicero did not have the right to sell trees on the property 
because it was not allowed under his lease agreement with the Los Angeles 
Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
That lease calls for the sales of produce grown on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Kippen said Cicero will claim that he would face irreparable harm if the 
restraining order is enforced because he has ordered $120,000 worth of trees 
and has spent another $30,000 or so putting up lights and erecting a motorized 
sleigh ride. 
</P>
<P>
Stu Miller, owner of one of the largest Christmas tree companies in the state 
-- Miller &amp; Sons -- prompted the court action by filing lawsuits against 
Cicero and the college district, citing unfair competition. 
</P>
<P>
One of Miller's 40 lots is across the street from the Cicero operation.

COUNCIL COMMITTEE LIFTS ROADBLOCK TO MCA PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A roadblock to MCA's plans to build a 257,000-square-foot pedestrian-oriented 
commercial-restaurant complex at Universal City was quickly removed Tuesday by 
the planning committee of the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning and Land Use Management Committee voted 3 to 0 to lift 
restrictions previously placed on the media giant's $70-million "CityWalk" 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions, which were imposed in July and included limits on the hours 
of use of a private road on the 420-acre property, had been called illegal by 
MCA attorney and lobbyist Burt Pines. They had been imposed when the project 
was granted a variance by the city's Board of Zoning Appeals. The road provided 
access to a 550-space MCA parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"CityWalk" was dubbed the "ultimate Los Angeles boulevard" last spring by 
architect Jon Jerde, who has worked on its design. It calls for boutiques, 
cafes and bookstores to be built along a pedestrian mall connecting the 
amphitheater, restaurants, Tour Plaza and movie theaters at Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the project, set to begin construction in January, is located outside 
city limits. However, 28,000 square feet are to be in the city, necessitating 
the city variance. 
</P>
<P>
The county portion is already approved. 
</P>
<P>
Several local homeowners opposed to the project had sought the restrictions on 
the road to the parking lot and the lot itself, and had urged the city to 
require a full environmental review of the project. 
</P>
<P>
But Pines, Los Angeles' former city attorney, said that the protesting 
homeowners are a small group and that residents supporting the project are in 
the majority. 
</P>
<P>
Pines also said the city had no jurisdiction to regulate the operations of the 
road or the lot itself.

Plenty of Grace, who was 56-1 when she won the Yellow Ribbon at Santa Anita on 
Nov. 4, will be a considerably shorter price and may even go off as the 
favorite on Sunday in the $200,000 Matriarch at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer John Veitch hopes that a victory in the 1 1/8-mile Matriarch might be 
enough to convince voters that his 3-year-old filly deserves the Eclipse Award 
for best female on grass this year. 
</P>

The other stake at Hollywood Park this weekend is Saturday's $100,000 Native 
Diver Handicap at 1 1/8 miles on dirt. BILL CHRISTINE

THE BOTTOM TEN: IT'S THE PITS FOR NO. 1-RANKED PITT

THE COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
Ranked No. 18 in AP's preseason top 25 poll, a team that bad-mouthed its 
opponents and then got beat up by them, Pitt (3-7-1) was a true Bottom Ten 
phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers, who criticized Miami before a 45-point loss and Oklahoma after a 
42-point loss, rallied on the last week of the regular season and won the 
Bottom Ten title. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt's ascension climaxed a confusing weekend marked by a shocking upset of SMU 
by previous Bottom Ten-leading Arkansas and a decision by the voters to option 
out Cal State Fullerton (1-11) to Division II football. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt's name will now be engraved on the Bronze Dunce Cap in the Bottom Ten Hall 
of Fame, currently located in the basement of Al's Billiards, Sushi and Tanning 
Parlor in Venice, Calif.*

JOHN JENKINS POUR-IT-ON AWARD: The honor, named for the Houston coach, goes to 
BYU's LaVell Edwards who left quarterback Ty Detmer in game into fourth quarter

</P>
<P>
How low has Cleveland fallen? When the red-faced Browns fell behind Miami, 3-27 
at halftime, Sunday, NBC switched away for good to the Indianapolis-Cincinnati 
game. Yup, NBC canceled Cleveland (2-9), the "Cop Rock" of NFL football. 
</P>
<P>
The move robbed viewers of the chance to watch the luxury-box frowns, sneers 
and head-shakes of Browns' owner Art Modell, the man who deserves much of the 
credit for the team's demise. 
</P>
<P>
It was meddling Modell who stabilized quarterback Bernie Kosar and the rest of 
the team with three coaches in the last three years and five offensive 
coordinators in the last six.

EASTERN AWARDED $135-MILLION CASH INFUSION ; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE'S RULING FOLLOWED TESTIMONY THAT THE AILING 
CARRIER'S CHANCES FOR SURVIVAL WERE HURT BY ADVERSE PUBLICITY EACH TIME IT 
SOUGHT FUNDS IN COURT.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal bankruptcy judge, giving troubled Eastern Airlines breathing room to 
survive at least into next spring, granted the carrier a $135-million cash 
infusion Tuesday that will save it from making repeated requests for operating 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by Judge Burton R. Lifland followed testimony by Martin R. Shugrue 
Jr., the airline's bankruptcy trustee, that requiring Eastern to come to court 
every time it needed money dramatically hurt business and the carrier's chances 
for survival. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major victory for Eastern Airlines and a major victory for its 
18,000 employees and a major victory for the American traveling public," 
Shugrue said after an hourlong hearing. "Passengers can book with confidence." 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Shugrue had complained that when hearings were held earlier 
this month on the airline's request to draw $30 million from an escrow account, 
the adverse publicity nearly killed advanced bookings, costing Eastern $36 
million. 
</P>
<P>
At that time and again on Tuesday, Eastern's unsecured creditors argued that 
the airline should be liquidated. 
</P>
<P>
"Eastern is not reorganizable," said the attorney for the creditors committee, 
Joel B. Zweibel. "It is not a viable, stand-alone airline." Zweibel said the 
carrier was still losing $2 million daily. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Lifland said "tension exists" between the two parties and agreed that the 
airline's chances to remain viable were better served if it did not have to 
come back to court every time it needed money. 
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the creditors for contributing to the bad publicity by 
seeking liquidation and by leaking information to the media. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Lifland ordered that $15 million of the released funds be set 
aside for Eastern to make deposits with credit card companies that are 
breathing down its neck. Shugrue said American Express had already required 
Eastern to make a $10-million deposit as "cash-up-front money" to cover 
customer ticket purchases. Other credit card companies are about to do the 
same, Shugrue said. 
</P>
<P>
The $135 million for day-to-day operating expenses includes $15 million which 
the judge previously had said would be paid out to the airline on Dec. 3. Two 
weeks ago, Lifland allowed Eastern to take $30 million from its escrow account, 
which holds funds it has realized from the sale of assets since declaring 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the judge's vote of confidence in Shugrue's management, observers' 
assessments of Eastern's chances for survival were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of going back and asking the judge for money all the time, they have 
to generate cash from their business," said Edmund Greenslet, a Florida-based 
analyst. "I think Eastern can reach the point where it can generate cash in a 
reasonable period of time." 
</P>
<P>
But Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., an 
investment house, said efforts to rescue the Miami-based carrier were wasted. 
</P>
<P>
"Put Eastern to rest," he said. "Competition should not be held back. There is 
too much capacity," he said, and Eastern's competitors could readily absorb its 
passengers if the carrier is allowed to fold.

ECONOMIC REPORTS MAKING CONSUMERS INCREASINGLY WARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Consumer attitudes about the U.S. economy edged lower in November and are close 
to the gloomiest depths reached in the 1982 recession, the Conference Board 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The finding, which raises new questions about the Christmas shopping season, 
came on a day of mostly downbeat economic news. A large majority of business 
economists said the U.S. economy has entered a recession, and new reports said 
sales of existing homes fell in October and that the U.S. trade deficit widened 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"All these things combined point in the same direction -- that we're getting 
deeper and deeper into an economic recession," said Sung Won Sohn, chief 
economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. "Now, we're really talking about how 
long and deep the recession is going to be." 
</P>
<P>
The notable exception to the dreary list was a sharp rise in auto sales during 
November, U.S. car makers reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the drop in consumer confidence, there's still evidence that consumers 
are spending," said David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill in Lexington, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, how comfortable Americans feel parting with their money in the coming 
months will help determine the severity of the downturn, because consumer 
spending accounts for two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
By one recent gauge, consumers may pull back. Public confidence in the economy 
slipped a bit further in November, following sharp plunges since the Persian 
Gulf crisis began in August, according to a survey by the Conference Board, a 
business research organization in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The board's index of consumer confidence now stands at 61.5, sharply down from 
the year-ago level of 115.1. 
</P>
<P>
"It is likely that the Persian Gulf crisis and pending tax increases have 
contributed to the precipitous decline in consumer spirits," said Fabian 
Linden, executive director of the board's Consumer Research Center. Concerns 
about unemployment and the shaky financial system also have eroded public 
optimism about the economy, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The flagging spirits spark worries about this year's Christmas shopping season, 
a crucial period for many retailers. Wyss predicted that the season would be 
essentially flat or "pretty bad but not terrible" for retailers. "Americans 
have to be awfully scared to put their plastic away," he maintained. 
</P>
<P>
To the surprise of some, Americans have continued to spend for cars, albeit at 
a slower pace than last year. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, U.S. auto makers said mid-November sales of cars made in North 
America were 18% higher than last year, with gains for the Big Three -- General 
Motors, Ford and Chrysler -- of 16.2%. Car sales are down for the year, 
however, by 3.3% for all U.S. auto makers and 8.3% for the Big Three. 
</P>
<P>
While signals from the auto industry have been mixed, the message from the 
housing market has been clear: Times are tough. Sales of existing homes dropped 
4.7% in October, falling to the lowest level in nearly six years, the National 
Assn. of Realtors reported. 
</P>
<P>
The median price of an existing house declined 1.7% to $92,800 in a reflection 
of the fragile market. (In the western United States, the median price was 
$140,600, up 4.4% from September. Sales in the West were down 5.8%. In 
California, the home resale market gained 2.2% in October, the California Assn. 
of Realtors reported Monday.) 
</P>
<P>
"Consumer confidence is a major concern. It's affecting housing, it's affecting 
autos, it's affecting retail sales," said John Tuccillo, chief economist at the 
realtors association in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The varied signs of economic frailty have finally persuaded an erstwhile 
optimistic group, the National Assn. of Business Economists, that a recession 
has begun. In a survey released Tuesday, three out of four business economists 
said the United States slipped into a recession sometime between July and 
November. Two-thirds expect the slump, triggered by soaring oil prices, to last 
up to six months. 
</P>
<P>
"Our best guess is the recession will be short -- two quarters or less -- and 
the decline shallow," said Richard Rippe, president of the association and 
chief economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, the Commerce Department released a compilation of trade data, 
which showed that the U.S. trade deficit widened 29% to $29.8 billion between 
July and September.

U.S. Stepping Up Investigation: Federal engineers are stepping up an 
investigation of reported seat belt failures in 1984 and 1985 Ford Mustang 
automobiles, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced. The 
NTSB said it had upgraded the probe from a preliminary evaluation -- an 
examination of paper work -- to an engineering analysis, in which engineers 
will study the possibly defective parts. The agency said there had been 21 
complaints of plastic components in the seat belt buckles breaking, preventing 
the belt from being able to be latched.

Food Inflation Seen Dipping in 1991: The Agriculture Department forecast that 
food prices will rise 2 to 5% in 1991, a return to more moderate levels of 
inflation after two years of increases in the range of 6%. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast suggested that food prices might return to the stable levels of 
the mid-1980s, when year-to-year increases were a modest 2% or 3%. Food prices 
are projected to rise 6% this year. Last winter's freeze in the South drove up 
fruit and vegetable prices.

GE to Quit Nuclear Trigger Plant: General Electric Co. confirmed that it plans 
to give up its $6.9-million-a-year management contract at a Florida plant that 
makes triggers for nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
GE said it found unacceptable Department of Energy changes in an agreement that 
call for contractors that run government plants to assume responsibility for 
environmental liability at the facilities. In the past, the government has 
borne such responsibilities. The DOE, which oversees the contract at the 
Pinellas plant in Largo, said the estimated 1,600 employees at the plant likely 
will continue to work there for the new operator. GE will quit the facility by 
May 31, 1992.

Kaiser Aluminum Plans Public Offering: The Oakland firm said in a filing with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission that it intends an initial public 
offering of up to 6 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Although the timing of the sale and the price have not been set, the offering 
could raise up to $120 million, based on the $20-per-share value listed for 
registration purposes. Kaiser's parent, Houston-based Maxxam Inc., would 
continue to be the majority shareholder after the offering, a company spokesman 
said. Proceeds from the sale would be used to pay off debt.

Gasoline Price Rises: The price of regular unleaded gasoline rose an average of 
0.7 cent a gallon -- from $1.359 to $1.366 -- in the past week, the American 
Automobile Assn. said. It will rise more if retailers begin passing on a new 
5-cent-a-gallon tax to motorists, the association added. The federal excise tax 
will go from 9 cents a gallon to 14 cents Saturday.

Possible AIDS Treatment Tested on Humans: Genentech, a South San Francisco 
biotechnology firm, said a small pilot study was begun last week at Walter Reed 
Institute of Research in Washington with "gp120," a potential immune system 
booster for those already infected with the AIDS virus. The drug being studied 
is a recombinant form of gp120, which is an exact copy, made through 
biotechnology, of a major protein on the surface of the virus that causes AIDS. 
"This study is the beginning of what could be a very long process, with an 
outcome that is uncertain," said Arthur J. Ammann, Genentech's director of 
clinical research.

LOOKING AHEAD: THE INFRASTRUCTURE PREDICAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A healthy infrastructure -- city streets, interstate highways, bridges, 
waterworks and sewer systems -- is vital to business. But the United States is 
facing major infrastructure problems in the next decade and beyond that will 
make "business as usual" increasingly difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the problems will be aggravated by demographic trends that also will 
affect business. Help from Washington is unlikely to be as forthcoming as it 
was, forcing state and local governments to turn to local taxpayers and 
businesses for funds. 
</P>
<P>
"From a demographic perspective, infrastructure needs (and our ability to pay 
for them) are influenced by changes in where people live and work, migration 
patterns, consumption and lifestyle patterns, the age of the population and 
income levels," according to "America in the 21st Century: Infrastructure 
Needs," a report by the Washington-based Population Reference Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Trends that will affect infrastructure include the movement of large numbers of 
Americans from Northeastern cities to the South and Southwest (leaving behind 
aging facilities and lower tax bases and bringing with them a demand for new 
roads and increased sewage-system capacity). Another trend is the rising 
economic expectations of many middle-class Americans, which in the past has 
meant more cars on the highways and greater business and housing-related 
infrastructure demands. 
</P>
<P>
What lies ahead? The Population Reference Bureau warns that deteriorating 
streets and highways, gridlock traffic conditions, bridges in dire need of 
repair, leaky water storage and distribution systems and inadequate sewage 
treatment capacity could become common in the 1990s and the early 21st Century. 
Businesses will feel the effect of infrastructure deterioration in everything 
from increased delivery time due to traffic congestion to laws limiting new 
offices and store construction because of strained water and sewage-system 
capacities. 
</P>
<P>
Also exacerbating the situation will be worker-related trends that include a 
declining supply of civil engineers to address infrastructure problems. 
Enrollment in schools of civil engineering has dropped, while the number of 
engineers reaching retirement age has grown. Business may have competition from 
government in attracting tomorrow's civil engineers. 
</P>
<P>
"Competition for scarce labor is likely to force wages up," notes William 
O'Hare, the Population Reference Bureau's director of policy studies. "If 
municipalities cannot find a sufficient number of civil engineers or 
construction workers in the United States, they may turn to labor markets 
abroad. These potential labor shortages will spur debate on revising U.S. 
immigration policies to fit the nation's perceived labor needs." 
</P>
<P>
While there is agreement that the United States needs to put more money into 
infrastructure preservation, the question of who pays remains to be answered. 
The Population Reference Bureau concludes that, given a large budget deficit 
and a strong anti-tax climate, a big increase in federal funds for 
infrastructure repair is unlikely. This means that states with large 
populations and large infrastructure needs, such as California, may be 
shouldering rapidly increasing infrastructure expenses.

APPLE TO JOIN ACORN, VLSI IN CHIP-MAKING VENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Apple Computer, chip maker VLSI Technology and British computer vendor Acorn 
Computers announced Tuesday that they had formed a joint venture company to 
design and market computer chips based on reduced instruction set computing 
(RISC) technology. 
</P>
<P>
The new venture, based in Cambridge, England, will further develop chip 
technology that was pioneered by Acorn. Apple has invested about $3 million 
(roughly 1.5 million pounds) for a 30% interest in the company, dubbed Advanced 
Risc Machines Ltd. (ARM), but the exact ownership stake of VLSI and Acorn was 
not disclosed. Additional partners are being sought, and ARM will also try to 
get funding from one of several European Community technology development 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Acorn, which is 80% owned by the Italian computer giant Olivetti, has over the 
past five years developed a series of RISC microprocessors -- or 
computers-on-a-chip -- primarily for use in its own personal computer products. 
RISC dramatically improves computer performance by cutting down the number of 
individual instructions a machine must execute to carry out a given function, 
and many regard it as the key to a broad range of future computers. 
</P>
<P>
But while RISC chips from such well-known firms as Sun Microsystems, 
International Business Machines and Hewlett-Packard have been designed to 
improve the performance of high-powered desktop computers, Acorn has focused on 
making small, inexpensive RISC chips that don't use much power. 
</P>
<P>
The ARM venture will retain that orientation, aiming to produce RISC 
microprocessors that will be used in small portable computers and for so-called 
embedded control functions such as controlling laser printers, tape drives and 
other computer peripherals. The ARM-designed chips will be manufactured by VLSI 
Technology of San Jose. Sanyo Electric Co. of Japan also has a license to 
produce the products. 
</P>
<P>
Apple Vice President Larry Tessler said Apple had no specific plans to use ARM 
chips in its computers. He said low-cost, low-power RISC chips would create "a 
lot of exciting new products in the industry," but that Apple regards the 
venture as a good investment in support of good technology rather than a source 
of future products. 
</P>
<P>
Apple has previously taken equity stakes in companies from which it did not buy 
products, but it has never before invested in a chip firm. Some analysts 
speculated that Apple might be eyeing ARM chips for use in a future 
notebook-sized computer, but Tessler declined comment on future products. 
</P>
<P>
VLSI Senior Vice President Douglas J. Bartek noted that the market for embedded 
control processors -- which are invisible to the computer user but perform 
critical functions -- is expected to be worth $200 million a year by 1992, up 
from just $18 million in 1989. "The volumes are absolutely huge," he said, even 
larger than the volume for the more well-known RISC workstation chips. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Elliot, an analyst with the chip research firm Dataquest, said it appeared 
that the ARM chips would be "very viable products," both as embedded control 
devices and as traditional microprocessors. 
</P>
<P>
Erik N. Jansen, an analyst with the investment banking firm Robertson Stephens 
&amp; Co., added that the venture was "a heck of a deal for VLSI Technology," 
which gains the prestige of a joint venture with Apple and access to some 
potentially hot-selling chip technology. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first effort to present a broad range of system-level RISC 
machines that are low-power," he said. "The product sounds right to me."

MICROSOFT HELPS SET MULTIMEDIA COMPUTER STANDARDS

In an effort to boost the development of a major new market for personal 
computer hardware and software, Microsoft Corp. and a number of PC 
manufacturers on Tuesday announced a set of basic standards for so-called 
multimedia computers. 
</P>
<P>
Multimedia combines traditional computing functions with high-quality sound and 
video, thus opening a broad new range of possible applications. Technological 
advances over the past several years have rendered multimedia practical on 
standard personal computers, and many companies have seized on multimedia in 
recent months as a key growth area. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's announcement was an effort to establish a minimum set of criteria for 
multimedia personal computers, thus allowing software developers to write 
multimedia programs with a knowledge of what kind of hardware will be 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Tandy Corp., parent company of the Radio Shack electronics chain, joined with 
nine other computer vendors in agreeing to ship a multimedia machine by next 
year. Such a system will include an IBM-compatible personal computer with 
either a 286 or 386 microprocessor from Intel Corp. that's equipped with at 
least 2 megabytes of memory, a 30-megabyte hard disk drive, VGA graphics, a 
digital audio system and a CD-ROM laser disk drive. In addition, the machines 
will include Microsoft's Windows operating software equipped with special 
multimedia extensions. 
</P>
<P>
A multimedia package would add about $1,000 to the cost of a typical business 
PC. 
</P>
<P>
International Business Machines, while not committing to specific hardware 
deliveries, is supporting the initiative in promoting the development of 
multimedia software for its OS/2 operating system. 
</P>
<P>
Among the computer vendors joining Tandy in supporting a multimedia platform 
are AT&amp;T, NEC, Fujitsu, Olivetti and Zenith. Tandy said it would promote 
multimedia through special promotions in its Radio Shack stores. 
</P>
<P>
While Tuesday's announcement should give a lift to multimedia development 
efforts, it did not resolve many of the thornier issues, such as exactly how 
full-motion video will be handled in future multimedia computers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, computer vendors whose machines are not IBM-compatible, such as 
Apple Computer and Next Inc., are pushing ahead with their own multimedia 
plans.

AT&amp;T SAYS MONDAY WAS BUSIEST CALLING DAY IN ITS HISTORY

Americans set a long-distance calling record this week that broke the one set 
the day after last year's San Francisco earthquake, AT&amp;T said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph has only theories to explain why 148.4 
million long-distance calls were made on its lines Monday. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 18, 1989, the day after the San Francisco earthquake, AT&amp;T handled 
about 144.7 million long-distance calls, said spokesman Herb Linnen. On an 
average day, the company handles 115 million to 120 million calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, the Monday after the Thanksgiving weekend is busy, although 
there has never been one like this," Linnen said. "It was the busiest calling 
day in the history of AT&amp;T." 
</P>
<P>
Linnen speculated that people were trying to catch up on business or perhaps 
discussing the possibility of war with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
But then there were a lot of calls to toll-free "800" numbers, and that could 
mean people were doing more Christmas shopping by phone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T handles 70% or more of the nation's long-distance calls. There was no 
similar announcement from the other two major long-distance companies, US 
Sprint and MCI.

Mid-November sales of North American-made cars and light trucks pulled 14.9% 
ahead of a slow mid-November period last year, auto makers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 major U.S. auto makers said they sold an average of 35,646 cars and 
light trucks a day in the Nov. 11-20 period, up from an average daily rate of 
31,032 during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Car sales jumped 18% and truck sales were up 10.1%, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. reported a 16.2% gain 
in domestic car sales while sales of transplant cars, made in North America by 
foreign companies, jumped 29.5%. 
</P>
<P>
The sales outpaced a market that slumped last fall after auto makers used heavy 
incentives to boost sales and clear out inventories before the 1990 model year. 
</P>
<P>
Wary of the impact of the slow economy and rising gasoline prices on buyers, 
auto companies have avoided excess inventories in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In their latest production cut, the Big Three ordered shutdowns that began 
Monday, idling 38,000 employees at 14 assembly plants in eight states. The 
companies blamed slow dealer orders. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Assn., said 
Tuesday's figures showed that economically, "We are not poised at the edge of a 
cliff." 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic was up substantially" in mid-November at Highland Chrysler Plymouth in 
Grand Rapids, Mich., sales manager Chuck Stockmar said. "Elections were over 
with, for one thing." 
</P>
<P>
But while sales rose, auto industry analyst Jeannette Garretty of Bank of 
America in San Francisco said: "They are up over a very weak period last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumer sentiment fell very sharply in October," Garretty said. "There's 
still a great deal of concern about where the economy is headed and about where 
unemployment is headed." 
</P>
<P>
For the year through Nov. 20, car and truck sales by the 10 domestic makers 
still trailed last year's pace by 3.2%, with car sales lagging 3.3% and truck 
sales down 3%. 
</P>
<P>
GM said its combined mid-November car and truck sales were up 14.5%, with car 
sales up 16.9% and truck sales up 10.6%. For the year, GM said car and truck 
sales lagged 3.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Ford reported car sales up 17.6% and truck sales up 14.6% for a combined 16.3% 
gain for mid-November. Ford said car and truck sales for the year were trailing 
last year's sales by 7.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler said its car sales rose 10.8% while truck sales edged up 0.5%, an 
overall 5.4% mid-November rise. For the year, Chrysler reported car and light 
truck sales trailing by 13.5%.

A HOUSE DIVIDED -- POLITICALLY; 
</P>
<P>
GEOGRAPHY: A HOME ON THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY-VENTURA COUNTY LINE SUMS UP 
WESTLAKE, WHICH IS PLAGUED BY JURISDICTIONAL PROBLEMS.

<P>
Jim Pauley has only to go in his front yard to plant a foot in Thousand Oaks 
and another in Westlake Village. He is used to borrowing sugar from Los Angeles 
County neighbors and milk from those in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
And it is all because his house in Westlake sits on the county line. 
</P>
<P>
"I can sit in Los Angeles County and read something in Ventura," said Pauley, 
60. "If I open a window in Ventura County, I can poke a finger into L.A. Not 
many people can do that." 
</P>
<P>
If Pauley's bi-county reach has become something of a household joke, some of 
his neighbors are occasionally frustrated by the confusing jurisdictional 
problems that plague this community divided between two counties. 
</P>
<P>
Students living in the same block often attend different high schools. Those 
who live in Ventura County attend Westlake High School. Only a few doors away, 
other students are bused five miles to Agoura High School in Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of this community are served by two fire departments, two sheriff's 
departments and two telephone area codes -- 818 and 805. 
</P>
<P>
When streets crossing the county line need repair, the job requires 
coordination of two municipal public works crews. Even La Venta Drive, the name 
coined as the marriage of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, complicates repair 
work because it was designed by engineers from two counties. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the political lines, most Westlake residents consider themselves 
members of one community. Given the choice, Westlake Village Councilman Ken 
Rufener says, area residents would have the political boundary tumble like the 
Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"People would like to have one city here," Rufener said. "I think that if it 
came to a vote that you would form a larger city of Westlake Village." 
</P>
<P>
For most of its 23-year history, Westlake has been a tale of two counties. 
</P>
<P>
On the Los Angeles County side is the incorporated city of Westlake Village, a 
5.4-square-mile area stretching from Decker Canyon Road to the south to the 
area north of Thousand Oaks Boulevard. The city counts about 11,400 residents. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, Westlake is actually a portion of the city of Thousand Oaks. 
It is bordered by Kanan Road and Lake Sherwood. About 22,000 people live in 
this area and consider themselves Westlake residents. 
</P>
<P>
The call for unifying Ventura County's Westlake and Los Angeles County's 
Westlake Village is nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
History shows that the city's original developer envisioned building a united 
community out of what was once a cluster of sheep ranches. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, Daniel K. Ludwig's American-Hawaiian Steamship Co. began developing 
12,500 acres of ranchland into one of the nation's first instant cities. 
</P>
<P>
Architects of the master-planned city mapped a community of 70,000 people 
stretching from Triunfo Canyon Road in Los Angeles County to what is now Kanan 
Road in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Billed as "The City in the Country," Westlake Village was portrayed in a 1970 
Time magazine article as the centerpiece of Ludwig's $1-billion empire. 
</P>
<P>
The community was designed to appeal to Los Angeles residents who sought escape 
from the big city but wanted to keep their urban amenities. Under Ludwig's 
vision, the city got the nation's first golf course lighted for nighttime play 
and the first man-made lake. 
</P>
<P>
Ludwig's strategy was that the future city lie entirely in one county. For a 
while, Ventura County political leaders toyed with the thought. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, a local newspaper quoted an official with the Ventura County Local 
Agency Formation Commission outlining a "logical" exchange of land between the 
two counties so that Westlake Village could be located entirely in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Los Angeles County nor Ventura County would give up any territory. 
Thousand Oaks annexed parts of the Westlake Village community in 1967 and 1972. 
</P>
<P>
The notion of unification was resurrected four years ago when a group of 
Westlake Village residents proposed carving a piece out of Los Angeles and 
Ventura counties and creating a new county that would extend from Calabasas to 
the Conejo Grade, north to Simi Valley and south to the Santa Monica Mountains, 
Westlake Village Councilwoman Berniece Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
That effort also failed because it would have involved state legislation, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for incorporating on Dec. 11, 1981, was to retain the 
community's upscale image. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were becoming a city, people were afraid that we would lose the name 
Westlake Village on the Ventura side. The name itself helps maintain property 
values," Bennett said. "People did perceive Westlake to be on the snooty side." 
</P>
<P>
In turn, some Thousand Oaks residents considered Westlake Village residents 
snobby, said Larry Horner, the only Thousand Oaks councilman who claims 
Westlake as his home. "There was a lot of jealousy between the two communities. 
They felt people in the Westlake area were snobbish," Horner said. 
</P>
<P>
Except for casting votes, most residents have forgotten that the official line 
exists, said Crosby E. Fentress, 65, a former president of the Westlake Joint 
Board of Homeowners Assns., which represents 45 homeowner groups in both 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
"The community does indeed think of itself as a monolithic community," he said. 
"There really is no difference between the two sides." 
</P>
<P>
If political boundaries divide the city, the upscale business community works 
in favor of unifying it. 
</P>
<P>
The community's major shopping centers and employers lining Westlake Boulevard 
use Westlake Village in their address and advertisements, despite being in 
Thousand Oaks' city limits. 
</P>
<P>
One of them is the upscale Sedona Restaurant, which uses its Westlake Village 
address to attract locals, said owner and attorney John Hollis, a 14-year 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had used Thousand Oaks, nobody would have known where we were," he said.

SETTLEMENT REACHED OVER SINKING HOMES; 
</P>
<P>
MONTEREY HILLS: MORE THAN TWO DOZEN INSURANCE COMPANIES AND LOS ANGELES WILL 
PAY $62.5 MILLION TO THE RESIDENTS OF THE CONDOMINIUM COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 700 homeowners who bought city-funded townhouses in Monterey Hills -- 
only to watch their investments literally sink into the earth beneath them -- 
reached a $62.5-million settlement Tuesday with Los Angeles and more than two 
dozen insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that it was one of the largest settlements ever to involve the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
So complex was the battle over the hillside homes -- a village of 18 
condominiums and townhouses where floors sloped, walls cracked, swimming pools 
tilted and at least one building had to be condemned -- that it took more than 
two hours to read the settlement terms into the court record. 
</P>
<P>
It took nearly three years of arbitration hearings to settle the lawsuit filed 
six years ago against the city, contractors, soil engineers and others. Some 
hearings were held in the grand ballroom of the Bonaventure Hotel because there 
was not a courtroom big enough. As many as 100 lawyers argued the emotional 
case about homes built on soil that turned to mush. 
</P>
<P>
"Homeowners who were very long-suffering deserve a lot of credit because they 
stuck with a process that was sometimes difficult to understand," said Jim 
Wood, board chairman of the city's Community Redevelopment Agency, which 
directed the development. "Monterey Hills is a successful community. It is a 
very livable community. This settlement will make it more livable." 
</P>
<P>
After years of argument, tears and finger-pointing, the case ended without an 
assessment of blame. Instead, 25 insurance companies have agreed to pay most of 
the $62.5 million settlement, with the city paying about $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Had it gone to trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court, hundreds of millions 
of dollars in legal fees and years of court time probably would have been spent 
to reach a settlement, officials agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, several lawyers said, everyone cut their losses. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday, the homeowners had a lawsuit," said retired appellate court Justice 
John Trotter of the Judicial Arbitration &amp; Mediation Service, an Orange 
County firm that arbitrates lawsuits. "Today, they have something." 
</P>
<P>
About half of the settlement will be used to repair the damage to about 700 
units tucked into the hillside four miles east of downtown. Another $27.4 
million is to be divided among the 770 homeowners who sued -- an average of 
$20,000 apiece after legal fees, said attorney David A. McVey, who represented 
one of seven homeowner associations. 
</P>
<P>
For residents such as 39-year-old Gordon Anderson, who bought his two-bedroom 
condominium unit nine years ago with his life's savings and gifts from his 
family, the money hardly covers the years of fear and uncertainty that he and 
his neighbors endured since they bought in a development funded by $114.3 
million in city bonds. 
</P>
<P>
It was envisioned in 1971 as a community of nice homes minutes from downtown, 
with a portion to be set aside for low- and moderate-income people. So pleasant 
were the tree-lined hills and meandering roadways that notables such as Police 
Chief Daryl F. Gates and Councilman Richard Alatorre settled there. 
</P>
<P>
People stood in line to buy units offered at 5% down and an interest rate five 
points under the market price. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after moving in, they found the fire doors would not close and walls were 
cracking. Pillars holding up some of the buildings had begun to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
Soil experts determined that the landfill on which the homes were built was not 
properly prepared. The soil had not been properly compacted, and clay that 
should have been removed absorbed too much water, causing the homes to settle 
unevenly. 
</P>
<P>
One building was condemned and its residents forced to find housing elsewhere. 
Those who wanted to sell could not. Some let their investments lapse into 
foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
"They couldn't sell. They couldn't move on. They were housebound," McVey said. 
"As far as righting the wrong, the settlement is half a loaf. It won't make 
them financially whole. But we hope there will be enough money to make the 
structures safe and stable." 
</P>
<P>
Wood, of the CRA, said he was confident that the homes could be repaired. The 
soil has stopped sinking, he said, and the market value of the units will rise 
again once the cloud of litigation is lifted. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement must be ratified by the homeowners and given final approval in 
Superior Court at a hearing scheduled Dec. 14. A hearing officer must be 
appointed to determine how the money will be divided among the homeowners, 
already a matter of dispute. 
</P>
<P>
If the settlement is accepted, further lawsuits on the matter would be banned, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Although several homeowners were less than thrilled with the terms, they 
predicted that the agreement would be approved.

NEW TAXES FOR MENTAL CARE SOUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
SOCIAL SERVICES: COUNTY SUPERVISORS WANT A 5% LEVY ON UTILITY BILLS AND A 
HIGHER BED TAX. A PLAN FOR CITIES TO PAY ANOTHER $30 MILLION APPEARS DOOMED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, faced with the prospect of 
drastically cutting mental health services, Tuesday took the first step in 
trying to offset the cuts with $8 million in new taxes on utilities and motel 
and hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the supervisors decided to ask the county's municipalities for 
another $30 million to bolster county-run health and mental health programs, 
but less than two hours after the meeting, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley 
sharply rejected the request. 
</P>
<P>
Without additional money the board can only balance the mental health budget by 
imposing $41.9 million in cuts of mental health clinics and other services, 
leaving a bare-bones system capable of responding only to the most seriously 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors asked the county counsel to draft ordinances imposing a 5% 
utility users tax on gas and electric bills and raising the motel/hotel room 
tax from 10% to 12%. Both measures would apply only to residents and businesses 
in the unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
Their prospects of getting money from the cities appeared slim after Bradley's 
rebuff. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has had to step forward in recent years to support child care and 
homeless services because the county was not fulfilling its responsibilities," 
the mayor said in a statement released by his press secretary, Bill Chandler. 
"The county has already proven its lack of concern for those most in need, so 
there is no proof that these additional tax increment funds would be used 
wisely at all." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach also was cool to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I give them an A for creativity," said John Shirey, Long Beach's assistant 
city manager. The city's first priority is to use the money to repay $65 
million that the redevelopment agency borrowed from the city. "The board will 
have to get in line for our tax increment monies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the supervisors want cities to turn over 20% of so-called tax 
increment funds -- additional tax money realized from the construction of 
valuable office buildings and other projects in the redevelopment of formerly 
blighted areas. 
</P>
<P>
The bailout plan involving the cities and the new tax proposals joins a 
revenue-shifting plan already before the supervisors as options for preserving 
mental health services. 
</P>
<P>
The revenue-shifting plan, proposed a week ago by Chief Administrative Officer 
Richard Dixon, would squeeze about $15 million for mental health from the 
budgets of other county departments. 
</P>
<P>
But supervisors were discouraged Tuesday by testimony from representatives of 
the Sheriff's and Probation and Parole departments about the effect of this 
effort on their programs. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Probation Officer Barry J. Nidorf said he could not cut $3.4 million -- 
the amount ordered by Dixon -- from his $220-million budget without closing 
programs that the board ordered him to launch. Among these would be a program 
of supervision for newly released, high-risk felons. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts would "dramatically affect recidivism," Nidorf said. "We are going to 
have more crime on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Sheriff J. L. Harper also painted a dire picture of the effect of 
cuts to his department as well as to mental health services. The latter, he 
said, will result in more "hostage situations, barricade situations, suicides 
and suicide attempts." With these additional burdens plus an increase in 
incidents of disruptive or dangerous behavior by the untended mentally ill, 
Harper said, the department will have fewer deputies to deal with traditional 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just creating a revolving door," said Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who 
shortly afterward unveiled his tax and city assistance proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich said later he would not support cuts to other departments. 
Supervisor Pete Schabarum, on the other hand, said he would go for Dixon's 
countywide belt-tightening plan, but would not support new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates for the mentally ill were nonetheless encouraged by the supervisors' 
decision to again delay what could be a drastic $41.9 million in cuts to mental 
health services and the abandonment of 27,000 of 52,000 patients currently 
receiving care. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still dangling over the edge," said Anthony W. Harris, executive 
director of the Assn. of Community Mental Health Agencies, whose members work 
under contract to the county Department of Mental Health. But that, he and 
others said, is better than working under orders to shut down programs, lay off 
staff and turn patients away. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting was the longest and most spirited of the three devoted to the 
problem of major shortfalls in the health budgets, resulting from the failure 
of the Proposition 134 alcoholic beverages tax. Besides the revenue shortfall 
for mental health, the county is faced with a court order that the supervisors 
say requires $19 million more for the Department of Public Health Services to 
maintain adequate levels of care at county hospitals and health centers. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Schabarum called Supervisor Ed Edelman a socialist for proposing 
a license fee on businesses in the unincorporated areas that would tax gross 
revenues at 1% to 1.25%. Only Kenneth Hahn supported the idea. Edelman, 
nevertheless, has asked that such an ordinance be drawn for a formal vote next 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich's proposals had better luck, but he, too, was feeling the pressure 
of the situation. Even before Bradley turned down the idea of donating city tax 
revenues to the health cause, Atonovich said that if Los Angeles did not 
cooperate he would punish the city by blocking its effort to raise the 
$750-million ceiling on tax increment monies for exclusive city use. 
</P>
<P>
After the ceiling is reached -- probably in the next two years -- the county is 
scheduled to receive 47% of the money while the city splits the remainder with 
the school district. The city wants the supervisors to agree to a ceiling of $5 
billion, according to Mary Jung of the county administrative office. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum, as he has in previous meetings, once again blasted the state for 
failing to meet statutory obligations to fund mental health services. At one 
point, he testily interrupted the testimony of a mental health clinic 
administrator to admonish him for suggesting that the supervisors would be 
responsible for the increases in crime and homelessness that would result from 
mental health service cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"The people will pay one way or another," said Carl McCraven, executive 
director of Hillview Mental Health Center. 
</P>
<P>
"And where were you and where was everyone else when the game was in 
Sacramento?" Schabarum demanded. 
</P>
<P>
Also testifying against the mental health cuts was actor Nicholas Cage. He said 
cutting such programs while Los Angeles proposes to spend $5 million for a new 
theater downtown strikes him as insane.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SHOT BY DEPUTY IS CLEARED IN ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Long Beach man who was shot three times by a sheriff's deputy last week is 
not the robbery suspect police were seeking and will not face charges, an 
investigator in the case said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Investigator Jerry Jansen said Palema Matangi, 27, "sure looked like" a man who 
had committed a robbery last year at a home in North Long Beach, but that he 
had been cleared any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation into whether the deputy, a 15-year veteran, was justified in 
the shooting was not complete, but Jansen said it "appeared" that it was. The 
deputy, who was not identified, said Matangi failed to keep his hands in his 
pockets as ordered after he was stopped near the North Long Beach house. 
</P>
<P>
Matangi, who was in good condition at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center 
Tuesday with wounds to his hand, leg and stomach, told a reporter that he was 
on his way home and does not know why the deputy shot him.

BILL BOYARSKY: POLITICAL PERIL IN THE MOUNTAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Perennially threatened by fire and slides, the Santa Monica Mountains are well 
known as a dangerous place to live. What you may not know is that the mountains 
are just as dangerous to govern. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent homeowners ferociously resist the arrival of newcomers. The rugged 
topography raises safety issues that must be decided by elected officials 
relying on conflicting technical advice. Environmentalists are major players, 
for the mountains are a playground for the entire region. 
</P>
<P>
A playground, but also a political graveyard. Two decades ago, then-City 
Councilman Jim Potter was beaten by Joel Wachs because homeowners felt he'd 
allowed too many houses to be built in the Santa Monicas. Two years ago, 
anti-development homeowners in the far western portion of the mountain range 
put together a rebellion against Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, 
giving him a real scare before he finally won reelection. 
</P>
<P>
So it's easy to understand the potential dangers awaiting Los Angeles City 
Councilman Michael Woo in a small -- but symbolic -- dispute with one of his 
mountain constituents, Andrew Suser. Suser owns a home in the Hollywoodland 
subdivision on a narrow street in Beachwood Canyon, in the portion of the 
mountains known as the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Property owner Russell Belinsky owns the lot on the steep hillside above 
Suser's. With his lot zoned for single-family residences, Belinsky in 1989 
applied for a permit to build a three-story house. As his lawyer later 
explained, Belinsky and his wife are a young couple simply attempting to follow 
the law and build a house. 
</P>
<P>
However, citing recent city restrictions on home construction in the area, 
Planning Department officials at first turned Belinsky down. But when 
Belinsky's geologist reported that construction would be safe, the department 
reversed itself and supported his application, subject to several safety 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Woo, a cautious man respectful of procedure, went along with the city 
bureaucrats. As Woo explained it to me, if he overruled the officials, the city 
could be hit with a huge lawsuit from an outraged property owner. As is the 
custom, the other council members deferred to the councilman from the district 
and approved the project. 
</P>
<P>
About that time, Suser called me. He told me the construction threatened his 
house and the safety of his family. 
</P>
<P>
I try to avoid these stories. I'm as confused as the politicians by the 
conflicting geological claims. But Suser kept calling. He besieged me with 
documents, some of them arriving in envelopes marked with red "rush" and 
"confidential" labels. He didn't get mad at my failure to report on them. Nor 
did he lose his temper when I confessed that one of my cats had chewed up the 
construction site photographs he had loaned me. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, impressed by his persistence, I went to see him. 
</P>
<P>
Suser gave me his geologist's report:"Although it may be feasible to construct 
two residences on the steep slopes ascending from your property, there appears 
to be inadequate data to substantiate safety. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He showed me the proposed building site, on a narrow, unpaved hillside road 
that serves as a hiking trail into Griffith Park. The city spread out below, 
from downtown's towers to the Westside to Santa Monica Bay in the distance. 
Behind us was the park. 
</P>
<P>
While the hillside was too steep for me to live on, I could see why Belinsky 
wanted to build there. For all the political complications, it's a beautiful 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
Although only one house is involved, the building site's close proximity to 
Griffith Park has made the issue important to Santa Monica Mountains 
preservationists -- so important that it might come to haunt Woo if he decides, 
as expected, to run for mayor in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state agency created to stop 
overdevelopment, unsuccessfully intervened early this year. In attempting to 
persuade the City Council to block the construction of the house, conservancy 
official John Diaz said, "The proposed project would adversely impact the 
Griffith Park watershed, disrupt a natural watercourse and wildlife corridor 
and obliterate one of the few remaining active trails in the area." 
</P>
<P>
Diaz told me that there are about 170 such Hollywoodland vacant lots adjacent 
to Griffith Park, and if this house is approved, it may clear the way for other 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
The battle over the Belinsky house, combined with similar disputes, could unite 
environmentalists and homeowners against Woo. Woo was elected to the council as 
a slow-growth environmentalist. But if he puts an environmental plank in 
mayoral platform, Hollywoodland homeowners would be certain to shred it. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder politicians think the Santa Monica Mountains may be a great spot to 
visit, but not a safe place to represent.

DEPUTIES DESCRIBED AS CORRUPT; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: THE PROSECUTOR SAYS SEVEN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TURNED THE DRUG WAR 
INTO THEIR OWN PERSONAL PIGGY BANKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Seven Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies, accused of skimming more than $1.4 
million during narcotics raids, were portrayed by a prosecutor Tuesday as 
corrupt officers who "turned the war on drugs into their own personal piggy 
banks" and used stolen drug cash for spending sprees. 
</P>
<P>
The officers -- who worked together on an elite narcotics investigation team -- 
stole huge sums of money from drug traffickers and money launderers to finance 
cars, boats, vacation homes and other luxuries, Assistant U.S. Atty. Jeffrey C. 
Eglash told jurors in Los Angeles federal court. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor described the defendants as veteran deputies who had sworn to 
uphold the law but, in the end, "flaunted the law" by succumbing to the 
temptation of drug money. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence "has established one terrible, but indisputable, fact: The 
narcotics officers . . . were a group of corrupt, dishonest thieves," Eglash 
said in his closing statement in the seven-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
"(They were) thieves who turned the war on drugs into their own personal piggy 
banks from which they could satisfy their greed," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Eglash's statement came as both prosecutors and defense attorneys began final 
arguments before the jury. 
</P>
<P>
The seven deputies, who were suspended last year in the worst corruption 
scandal to hit the Sheriff's Department in recent history, are accused of a 
variety of charges -- including conspiracy, theft, tax evasion, money 
laundering and extortion. 
</P>
<P>
Six defendants -- Deputies Terrell H. Amers, James R. Bauder, Eufrasio G. 
Cortez, Ronald E. Daub, John C. Dickenson and Daniel M. Garner -- had worked 
together on the team, known as Majors II, while defendant Macario M. Duran 
worked as an undercover officer on another elite investigative team known as 
Majors III. All have maintained their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
And attorney James Riddet, who represents Cortez, told jurors Tuesday that they 
should vote for acquittal because the federal government has failed to prove 
its case beyond a reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
"When you review the evidence, there's not just reasonable doubt but 
overwhelming doubt whether any of these defendants committed a crime," Riddet 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As the first defense attorney to make a closing statement, Riddet attacked the 
prosecution's case as one built on the testimony of admitted drug dealers, 
incomplete financial information and dependent upon one witness, the 
defendants' former boss, Robert R. Sobel. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the former sheriff's sergeant the key to the government's case, Riddet 
argued that Sobel -- who has already pleaded guilty to conspiracy and tax 
evasion -- was an admitted liar and thief who has falsely accused his former 
subordinates to save himself from a lengthy prison term. 
</P>
<P>
"When we talk about Robert Sobel, we are talking about a person who is morally 
bankrupt," Riddet said. 
</P>
<P>
While Eglash acknowledged that Sobel was "a corrupt cop," he said the former 
sergeant was truthful in describing how he and his deputies stole money on more 
than 20 drug raids during 1988 and 1989. And he argued that the prosecution's 
case went beyond Sobel's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Eglash said that a videotape of an FBI sting showed deputies stealing money and 
that the prosecution also presented bank records, sales receipts, income tax 
returns and other financial documents that disclosed how deputies spent money 
well beyond their sheriff's salaries -- and conducted many of those 
transactions in cash. 
</P>
<P>
"There's only one question left to answer," the prosecutor told the jury. 
"Where did all this money come from and how did all these members of Majors II 
get so rich?"

LONG BEACH OFFICERS INVOLVED IN STING RETIRE WITH DISABILITY PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROXANA KOPETMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Long Beach police officers who were caught in the widely publicized sting 
involving civil rights activist Don Jackson have received stress-related 
disability retirements that will pay them 50% of their salaries for life, city 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Officers Mark Dickey, 29, and Mark Ramsey, 28, are suffering from psychological 
problems stemming from their arrest of Jackson on Jan. 14, 1989, according to 
city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors representing the officers and physicians with the city Health 
Department agreed that Dickey and Ramsey can no longer do their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, were shocked to hear of the retirement pay. 
</P>
<P>
"It's outrageous," Jackson exclaimed when told of the retirements. "These guys 
were stressed out because they were engaged in misconduct and they got caught." 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1989, Jackson set out to show that racism existed in the Long Beach 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
While an NBC camera crew tagged along, Jackson drove through Long Beach and 
eventually was stopped by Dickey and Ramsey for an alleged traffic violation. 
In the videotaped encounter, Dickey appeared to push Jackson's head through a 
glass window, shattering it. 
</P>
<P>
Dickey was charged with misdemeanor assault. He and Ramsey were also charged 
with misdemeanor violations for allegedly lying about the incident in a police 
report. A trial is set for Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Two months after the Jackson incident, Dickey went out on disability. Ramsey 
followed in April. 
</P>
<P>
In separate workers compensation claims, both cited anxiety and 
gastrointestinal problems among their illnesses. The claims said the illnesses 
were stress induced and began after January, 1989. Those claims are pending. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors from the city's Health Department said that the officers' "primary 
disabling condition is psychological," according to a report the city filed 
with the Public Employees Retirement System, which will pay the officers their 
lifetime disability. Officials declined to elaborate on the officers' medical 
problems, citing confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
The officers are free to work other jobs and still receive their disability 
pay. At the time he left the department, Dickey earned $756.92 a week and 
Ramsey was earning $663.24 a week. Dickey joined the department in October, 
1984, and Ramsey joined in April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Disability retirements for police officers and firefighters are not unusual. 
They happen ever year," said William Storey, the city's personnel director. 
Since 1979, Long Beach has averaged between 10 and 12 disability retirements 
for officers annually, Storey said. Officials could not say how many of those 
were stress related. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, all the doctors who examined the officers concurred that they 
could not do their jobs, according to Barbara de Jong, the deputy city attorney 
in charge of worker's compensation claims. 
</P>
<P>
The city did not dispute the officers' claims because the city's Health 
Department doctors agreed with the officers' doctors, officials explained. 
</P>
<P>
"We make valid medical recommendations," Storey said. "That affects what we put 
in the Public Employees Retirement System. If we were to let everybody go off 
on medical disability, we'd be paying a heck of a lot of money. Obviously, we 
don't want to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Ed George Jr., the attorney representing the officers in their upcoming trial, 
said, "Emotionally, they're still hurting over this whole thing, but they're 
doing the best they can. This has been a devastating experience."

TARGET OF DRUG TASK FORCE SUES; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: HE ACCUSES OFFICERS OF ABUSING HIM AND PLANTING EVIDENCE ON 
SUSPECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An alleged South-Central Los Angeles drug dealer, once the target of a special 
crime task force, has filed suit against several law enforcement officers, 
saying they violated his civil rights in their attempts to send him to prison. 
</P>
<P>
One of the officers cited in the complaint filed by Ricky Donell Ross is former 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Robert Sobel, the key government witness in 
the current money-skimming trial of seven sheriff's narcotics officers. He has 
testified in Los Angeles federal court that deputies abused and planted 
evidence on numerous drug suspects, including Ross. 
</P>
<P>
The civil suit filed in federal court alleges that from March, 1987, to about 
November, 1989, several sheriff's deputies and Los Angeles police officers 
violated Ross' civil rights by denying him due process and subjecting him to 
excessive force -- including beatings and a mauling by a police dog. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint, which seeks unspecified general and punitive damages, also 
charges the officers with assault, battery, false arrest and false 
imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
Also named in the suit are Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, and the 
city and county of Los Angeles, which the complaint accuses of having 
maintained an "official" policy that permitted the civil rights violations to 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, currently imprisoned for a drug conviction, could not be reached. His 
attorney, Robert Mann, also could not be contacted. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiff's brother, David Ross, 38, said Tuesday he was aware of the 
lawsuit and shared its sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"This is to compensate for all the brutality the police did to my brother and 
all the harassment my family has suffered," said David Ross, who, with his 
mother, was attending the trial of the seven deputies accused of stealing $1.4 
million from drug dealers and money launderers. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Cmdr. William Booth declined to comment on the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
A sheriff's deputy named in the suit denied that he and his colleagues had done 
anything wrong and questioned the credibility of a suspected drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
"We did our jobs effectively and professionally," said Deputy Ed Jamison, a 
former member of a task force that targeted Ross and other suspected drug 
dealers. "It doesn't surprise me that (Ross) would come up with these 
allegations. . . . He's responsible for putting hundreds of pounds of poison on 
the streets." 
</P>
<P>
Jamison was a member of the joint Sheriff's-LAPD Southwest Task force, a unit 
once dubbed the "Freeway Rick Task Force," because it initially was formed in 
January, 1987, to build a case against Ross. 
</P>
<P>
In testifying recently against his fellow officers, Sobel -- who once headed 
the task force -- recalled how some of his crew members allegedly attempted to 
set up Ross in April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The former sergeant, who has pleaded guilty to money-skimming and tax-evasion 
charges in the case, said he and other law enforcement officers once pursued 
Ross in an auto chase to a residential area, where Ross abandoned his car and 
climbed a fence to escape.

VIETNAM WAR: NGUYEN NGOC HUNG ONCE FOUGHT AGAINST AMERICAN TROOPS. NOW, LIKE 
SOME OF HIS FORMER ENEMIES, HE HOPES TO BURY PAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The scene along the Strand at Hermosa Beach Sunday afternoon was one of America 
at its most carefree -- people basking in the brilliant sun, spiking a 
volleyball over a net, skateboarding, strolling. The Pacific Rim looked 
peaceful and thoughts of war seemed very far away. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, they were not. The crowd milling around June Pulccini's patio and 
living room -- which opens onto the Strand -- seemed to expect something 
momentous. Guests kept their eyes on a slightly built man in gray flannel pants 
and navy blazer as they munched on vegetable dip and Thai takeout. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Ngoc Hung, 42, an English teacher at Foreign Languages College in Hanoi 
and veteran of the North Vietnamese Army, 1969-1975, sat talking quietly, 
waiting until it was time to speak formally. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, people tensed; a few caught their breath. Ron Kovic, U.S. Marine 
sergeant ("retired," he said dryly), wheeled himself into the room and shook 
hands with his former enemy -- a man who had fought in what his army called 
"the anti-American war," lived in the jungle for six years and traveled the Ho 
Chi Minh Trail. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard so much about you," Hung said softly to America's most famous 
Vietnam vet. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you?" Looking pleased, Kovic handed Hung -- the first veteran from the 
other side he had ever met -- a copy of his autobiography, "Born on the Fourth 
of July." 
</P>
<P>
Hung had not read the book or seen the movie. He had seen only a Rambo movie 
and "Missing in Action," films that dehumanized Hung's people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes more sense to be friends with you here than to be fighting with you 
there," said Kovic, who is paralyzed as a result of injuries suffered in the 
Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
And it seemed to make more sense to most of the people in the room -- a 
sympathetic group of about 50 longtime political activists, peace movement 
supporters, and several Vietnam veterans. The National Network of Indochina 
Activists had invited them, and had brought Hung to America, as part of its 
campaign to normalize relations between the United States and Vietnam. The 
organization is a self-described "loose network of old anti-war activists," 
said Tony Russo, a member who, along with Daniel Ellsberg, was involved in the 
Pentagon Papers case. The network invited Hung after seeing a CBS television 
interview with him in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
It was a day for talk of reconciliation, of healing wounds, comparing notes and 
looking toward the future -- with the crowd drawing parallels between Vietnam 
and the brewing conflict in the Middle East, looking to avoid what network 
coordinator Merle Ratner called "making the same mistake again." 
</P>
<P>
No battles were refought nor war stories told. Rather, people talked about the 
war's aftermath, and asked Hung about life in his country. After years of 
eating supper with the war on their televisions, Americans watched their 
screens go dark; guests said they knew next to nothing about present-day 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"Life is very difficult there," Hung told them in his soft-spoken, nearly 
flawless English. Vietnam had been eager to normalize relations with America 
after the war, he said. Instead, there has been the economic boycott, a border 
war with China and prolonged combat in Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Hung said, his teaching salary amounts to about $10 month. 
Married, with two young sons, he said he moonlights as a translator and 
interpreter, and his wife works. Together, they pull in about $20 a month. His 
salary, he said, would buy about two pounds of meat and 50 pounds of rice. 
Housing is provided for them, but the family must pay for electricity and 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"Luckily," he said of making ends meet, "we don't have a telephone." 
</P>
<P>
In a private conversation, Hung attributed the plight of the Vietnamese boat 
people largely to a disastrous economy and fears of war. He downplayed fears of 
present-day political repression. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a vast tragedy," he said, second only to the war with the Unite States 
itself. "If we'd been able to normalize relations, we may have been able to 
avoid it." 
</P>
<P>
It was a time of poverty, he said, of fear of more war. Ethnic Chinese, fearing 
repercussions from China, fled. People emboldened by Voice of America 
broadcasts promising asylum or refugee status fled. Those who had worked for 
the South Vietnamese government and had spent time in rehabilitation camps 
fled. 
</P>
<P>
"We made some mistakes. We discriminated against the intellectuals in South 
Vietnam. A tiny mistake led to vast destruction. We lost of hundreds of 
thousands at a time when we needed them most. . . . In coming back, many of 
them were scared they'd be put in camps. A few years ago the government called 
them traitors. That's a terrible word to use against these poor people." 
</P>
<P>
He had seen the Vietnamese settled here, he said, and had visited Bolsa Avenue, 
the famous Little Saigon in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to see (the Vietnamese immigrants) doing so well. They're a potential 
intellectual source for rebuilding a Vietnam in the future," Hung said. Well 
aware that their children are firmly rooted here, that they own homes and are 
not trying to live on $10 a month, he said they nevertheless would be welcome 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"Only probably no one can pay them," he said, chuckling a little. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the afternoon, Shad Meshad, a Vietnam vet who later started the Vet 
Centers program for the Veterans Administration, arrived. Now executive 
director of the Vietnam Veterans Aid Foundation, Meshad removed his group's 
yellow plastic bracelet from his arm; Hung immediately put it on. "I'm a Part 
of the Healing," it read. 
</P>
<P>
Hung, Kovic and Meshad agreed that Vietnamese veterans had one advantage over 
their American counterparts -- the way they were received and treated after the 
war. Meshad told Hung of homeless vets on Venice Beach, of joblessness, of 
suicides, of "a society not welcoming its warriors." Kovic spoke of his demand 
that the government apologize to the Vietnam vets. 
</P>
<P>
In Vietnam, Hung said, they were welcomed home with honor and love, the 
disabled were well cared for, and, in general, veterans have been "very active 
in the reconstruction of the country." The American treatment, he said, "is 
somehow very difficult to understand," 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating a subject that has frequently come up on his U.S. tour, Hung told 
the crowd that he does not believe American POWs exist in Vietnam. Speaking 
personally, he said, and not for his government, he acknowledged the issue 
remains a big obstacle to normalizing relations, and wondered whether the rumor 
was kept alive for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
His side, he told them, had 300,000 MIAs, his brother among them. The families 
would never know what happened to these soldiers and could only hope that, at 
best, they were buried in mass graves. Vietnamese villagers, Hung said, had 
little desire to cooperate with Americans who came searching for information, 
or bodies: " 'What about our sons, our brothers?' they ask." 
</P>
<P>
Families from both sides want to find their dead, he said. Perhaps it is 
something they could work on together. 
</P>
<P>
Calling himself a "very small potato in Hanoi," he said he came to offer 
goodwill and friendship. "It's time we put this war behind us, not to forget 
it, but learn from it. Fifteen years is a very long time."

<P>
The "Museum of Modern Male Art" in the offices of Esquire magazine, features 
neatly mounted trout and salmon flies, spoked wheel covers, an electric drill, 
billiard balls and a martini glass. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the simpler era that collection represents, it was easy to define the 
American man. Everyone knew what kind of man read Playboy. Or Argosy. Or True. 
</P>
<P>
But in the wake of the feminist and sexual revolutions, general and 
special-interest women's magazines overran the newsstands and their male 
counterparts languished. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 25 years later, publishers are trying to corral male consumers and readers 
with general-interest men's magazines. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that no one can agree on what it means to be a man anymore. Is 
he the aggressive executive who's studying haiku to expose his feminine nature? 
Or the gentle painter who gets in touch with his "inner warrior" at 
male-bonding seminars? Is he embittered by feminists or outraged by the 
photographs in Penthouse? Does he go bear hunting with Dad or bare his feelings 
about his conflicted relationship with father figures? 
</P>
<P>
If this were a barroom debate, would it end in soulful blubbering or someone 
getting his face bashed in? 
</P>
<P>
With those sorts of questions in mind, the small fraternity of men's magazine 
editors find themselves tangled in a sort of rugby scrum, with everyone kicking 
desperately to gain possession of the male reader. 
</P>
<P>
This autumn, despite the worst advertising climate in ages, publishers launched 
four new general-interest men's magazines: Men's Life, M-Inc., Details and 
Forbes' FYI. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few weeks, Men's Life, a quirky new publication produced by a former 
editor at Playboy, had gone belly up. But at least two more magazines -- Smart 
for Men and Rolling Stone's as yet unnamed publication -- are champing to join 
the fray. 
</P>
<P>
It was near the end of the '80s that publishers suddenly seemed to notice 
something: There are at least a dozen women's service, fashion, and general 
interest-magazines that sell between 1 million and 8 million copies each month 
and at least half a dozen others that sell more than 500,000, for a total 
yearly advertising revenues well over $1 billion. Yet only a handful of 
comparable men's magazines -- Playboy, Penthouse, Esquire, GQ -- are nearly as 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
"Billions of dollars have been made off the feminist and women's movements," 
said Asa Baber, who has written a column about men for Playboy since 1982. 
Books, movies, television shows, and magazines have all profited from the 
culture's focus on women, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But now, Baber believes, the women's movement is fading and "people are looking 
around for what's next. It's clear to me that for 25 years we've had very 
unbalanced reporting in the area of sexual politics and gender studies," he 
says. "Men have gotten either bad press or no press. I think that is about to 
be rectified . . . . In a marketing sense, a vacuum was created." 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Kimball estimates that he and Peter Kaplan spent "thousands of 
hours, drinking beer and going over and over and over" the question of man's 
current place in humanity. 
</P>
<P>
The product of all this pondering, Smart for Men, will hit the newsstands in 
mid-December, fusing the old Smart magazine with a yet another men's 
publication that Kimball and Kaplan, a former Esquire editor, had been planning 
to launch. 
</P>
<P>
Its arrival is geared to correspond with what Kimball calls "the return of the 
new man." 
</P>
<P>
"In the past 25 years, America has been feminized." Kimball says. "It was a 
good thing, generally speaking. But men have been on the back burner for a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Smart for Men, he says, will give men what they want. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, men are adolescent and over-sexed. We always have been and always 
will be," says Kimball, a tall, thin man wearing spectacles and a bow tie. 
Moreover, he adds, most of the women he knows are increasingly willing to 
accept that. "They're sick of the wimpy '80s image." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the days when women's magazines might feature the question, "Why 
Can't a Man be More Like a Woman?" may be over, Kimball thinks. 
</P>
<P>
"Men's Life" went so far as to turn those stereotypical headlines around. In a 
brief humor item, it suggested that if men's magazines were to handle 
gender-sensitive issues the way so many women's magazines do, they would run 
stories such as "Raising Consciousness: Why Can't She Raise the Toilet Seat?" 
or "Hey, How About My G-Spot?" 
</P>
<P>
Or, as the magazine's editor and creator, Barry Golson, a 17-year veteran of 
Playboy, said in his editorial: "Many of us have this suspicion we're not the 
jerks some women say we are . . . . Welcome back, guys." 
</P>
<P>
This defensive self-definition ran through the premiere issue of the magazine, 
which sold 250,000 copies on the newsstands. That the magazine went belly-up on 
Oct. 26, just six weeks after its official launch, was the result of a lousy 
advertising climate and the financial woes of owner Rupert Murdoch, rather than 
a failure to connect with readers, who did indeed identify with the magazine's 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the magazine, including Arthur Cooper, the editor of GQ magazine, 
think that readers were attracted to Men's Life out of a sense of "a nostalgia 
for the type of man that existed before the '60s." 
</P>
<P>
But "those were simpler times," he says. "A man was what he did. His wife was 
at home. He had his buddies, his poker playing. It was very easy then to define 
what a man was." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Cooper has found, many men and women alike are baffled by the male role in 
this culture. 
</P>
<P>
In the late '80s, GQ held panel discussions with members of each gender. They 
revealed that "women are angry and hostile because they thought men would 
change more," and because their sprint onto "the super-woman treadmill," had 
caused them to lose balance and teeter between a successful career, home life 
and personal life. 
</P>
<P>
Men, on the other hand, were simply confused, and wondered aloud why women had 
urged them to be more sensitive, then turned around and "bashed them" for their 
vulnerability, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Magazines like Men's Life, he continued, are ignoring the complexities of 
today's life. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Cooper, like others, is skeptical about their basic motives. 
</P>
<P>
"The women's magazine market," he said, "seems to be glutted, every niche 
occupied. So people are looking around and saying, 'We've discovered or 
rediscovered men.' But these magazines are market-driven, not reader-driven." 
</P>
<P>
To grab a piece of the perceived male readership pie, publishers have torn the 
gender into fragments defined by generation, economics, values, sensibilities 
and interests. 
</P>
<P>
Men's Life, for instance, was targeted to "a generation of men grown up," the 
41 million middle-income men ages 30 to 49. The newly launched Forbes FYI, 
shared "a sense of humor and sensibility" with Men's Life, said its editor 
Christopher Buckley, but it is more narrowly directed at corporate executives 
in their 40s and 50s. 
</P>
<P>
Men's Life featured articles on necktie selection and the allure of blondes. 
The premiere FYI, a quarterly, features former President Richard M. Nixon on 
wine, a pictorial spread on President George Bush's $20,000 double-barreled 
shotgun, and a fashion spread titled "Slammer Glamour," in which financial 
wizards and junk bondsmen are featured in chic clothing and handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our man of the '90s," Buckley said with a laugh, as he sat with his 
loafers up on the desk of his well-appointed office in the Forbes building. 
"He's going to jail!" 
</P>
<P>
Kimball and Kaplan at Smart for Men will attempt to attract those Baby Boomers 
who now feel comfortable, but trapped. 
</P>
<P>
"Every man wants to be James Bond," Kimball said, and as he describes it, Smart 
for Men will provide vicarious thrills for a generation of men who don't get 
many of the real kind any more. 
</P>
<P>
That take on manhood is at least a decade removed from the world view of the 
young men James Truman is hoping will be drawn into the newly redesigned 
Details magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Truman sees an old-fashioned generation gap rather than a gender gap as the 
heart of the difference between Details and the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very frightened of the term men's magazine. It sounds like a magazine of 
locker-room chat, men standing around, slapping each other on the back, and 
talking about babes," said Truman, 32, as he sat in a starkly black and white 
office in the bustling new black and white suite of offices in a totally hip 
section of New York's SoHo District. 
</P>
<P>
"I think any magazine that creates a ghetto like that is cutting itself off 
from a lot of potentially interesting stories . . . and interesting reaction 
from its audience." 
</P>
<P>
Whether Truman likes it or not, though, Details bills itself as a men's 
magazine. And it is the one that causes most older editors to make odd faces 
and admit that they just don't get the Details mix of gruesome photographs, 
high fashion, weird comic strips, Obsession ads and columns on such decidedly 
male topics as the penis. 
</P>
<P>
M-Inc.'s typical reader -- upscale executives in their 40s -- for instance, may 
read that magazine's November cover story about why the United States is in 
Saudi Arabia and worry about the effect on oil prices from the comfort of his 
armchair. The average Details reader is of the age to actually be there digging 
foxholes in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think our audience is nearly as big on self-definition," Truman said. 
"I think they're young and living a life rather than sitting around agonizing 
about the state of the collective soul of their generation." 
</P>
<P>
Or gender. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess our readers have reaped the benefits of the (feminist and sexual) 
conflicts of the '60s and '70s without having to absorb the bitterness and 
anger that came with those changes. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, the thing about Playboy and Penthouse was the discomfort men felt about 
women. These magazines brought a non-human woman into their homes in a 
pictorial way. I tend to think men feel more comfortable about women than they 
did 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
But Baber, at Playboy, said he thinks the declared gender truce is premature: 
"Younger men have often been raised in a feminist environment, and are simply 
much more wary of voicing some of the discomfort they feel when masculinity is 
trashed and feminism is handed out as the religion of the day." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "gender identity is crucial to all identity -- always will be 
and always has been. Androgyny as a model of behavior has probably had its 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Other men's magazines, old and new, have paid too much attention to the 
feminist movement, which was, Baber said, "a very conservative and puritanical 
movement." 
</P>
<P>
Only Playboy, he contends, "has always had the courage to confront those 
forces. When we were being told over and over on Donahue and Oprah and in Ms. 
magazine that we men were terrible people, Playboy said, 'No!' " 
</P>
<P>
Most men's magazines -- the veterans and the upstarts -- are too feminine, 
Baber said: "Esquire for example, tried very hard for a long time to please the 
feminist population, and I don't think that really answered the demands of the 
readership." 
</P>
<P>
Owen Lipstein, publisher of Smart magazine shares that view, and said he thinks 
that's why the Hearst Corp. hired away Terry McDonell, the creator and founding 
editor of Smart magazine, to run Esquire -- one of the oldest and most 
prestigious American magazines period, let alone in the men's magazine niche. 
</P>
<P>
"Terry has a Western sensibility, a macho-ness" that Esquire has been sorely 
lacking for some time, Lipstein said, leaning back on a couch in Smart 
magazine's offices, which feature a window full of New York skyline and a 
cactus, guitar, and pair of cowboy boots on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
McDonell, newly planted in the more elegant offices at Esquire, bristles upon 
hearing this observation. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, I think of myself as a feminist," he snapped. "I really do. No 
(expletive). I'm not kidding. 
</P>
<P>
"So macho," he continued, leaning forward with the sort of body language that 
might precipitate a barroom brawl, "is like a word from the Pleistocene." 
</P>
<P>
The real men's magazines, he said, are those read by both men and women -- 
Time, Newsweek, Businessweek, for example, and if Esquire competes with any 
magazines, it is the New Yorker and Vanity Fair. The men -- and women -- who 
read Esquire aren't "out there thinking 'Which of the men's magazines am I 
going to buy?' They're saying, 'Should I pick up the Wall Street Journal? 
Should I watch Entertainment Tonight or watch McNeil/Lehrer?' " 
</P>
<P>
The last thing the male readers want to do is waste their increasingly precious 
time pondering the meaning of their own masculinity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
This paradox -- the real men don't talk about what it means to be a man 
syndrome -- exemplifies the problem faced by aspiring men's magazine editors. 
</P>
<P>
As the odd woman out in the predominantly male field, Jane Lane, editor in 
chief of M-Inc., doesn't plan to make her magazine a forum for complex debates 
about gender politics or touchy-feely discussions of sexual identity. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not offering psychotherapy, we're offering entertainment and good 
writing," she says. The "real concerns" about such issues as the economy are of 
more interest than "whether a guy is likely to change diapers or do the 
dishes," she says. "Certainly there are a lot of platitudes around about the 
new man and old man. But the minute you say them, they're out of date." 
</P>
<P>
"If men are confused, they're not particularly interested in reading about 
their own confusion," says John Rasmus, a former editor of Outside magazine, 
who is now working with Rolling Stone's Jann Wenner on a men's magazine 
scheduled for release next fall. 
</P>
<P>
Push Christopher Buckley on the "sensibility," of his magazine, and he becomes 
the stereotypically nonverbal male. The "new manism," he says with a grin, 
"bores me to death!" 
</P>
<P>
Even the hyper-analyzed Smart for Men will be "a magazine that's for men, not 
about them," Kimball said. "I think many women's magazines are about working 
women, are about working mothers, are about savvy women. Women confess. Women 
want editors to tell them, for example, how to dress for success," he said. 
"Men convey information through storytelling . . . . This magazine isn't going 
to fret a lot about being a man . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
McDonell's said his full impact on Esquire will be felt in the February issue, 
not with any treatise on "the man of the 1990s," but with a renewed commitment 
to investigative journalism and hard-edged reportage. 
</P>
<P>
On the wall outside McDonell's office is a long line of Esquire's covers framed 
in glass: October, 1972, Burt Reynolds. May, 1976, Truman Capote. On the March, 
1965, cover Marilyn Monroe is shaving. The caption is "the masculization of the 
American woman." 
</P>
<P>
But the one McDonell stops in front of is the October, 1968 cover, showing 
images of John and Robert Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in a 
cemetery. Rapping it with his knuckle he said, "See that!" 
</P>
<P>
That is sort of magazine fare that shapes men's -- and women's -- views of 
themselves and how they should live. 
</P>
<P>
It may even be the sort of thing that shaped McDonell as a young reader, and, 
in turn, will shape his magazine. But McDonell doesn't want to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
"People ask, 'Will your magazine be more about guys who like Alan Alda or guys 
who like John Wayne?' " he said. "That's a preposterous equation to set up. 
Nobody in their right mind thinks like that."

ARMAND HAMMER MUSEUM OPENS;

<P>
THE GALLERIES: A PLEASANT PLACE TO SEE ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Opinion is likely to be divided on the horizontally striped building that 
houses the new Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center, opening today 
in Westwood, but one aspect of the facility can be expected to generate 
near-unanimity: For the display of art, the gallery spaces are quite fine. 
</P>
<P>
With one small exception, New York-based architect Edward Larrabee Barnes has 
fashioned graceful, adaptive, nicely lit rooms that work well for paintings. 
Happily, they work well for people, too. The galleries are pleasant to be in. 
</P>
<P>
As the architect who designed perhaps the most widely acclaimed museum 
galleries in the United States for the display of contemporary art -- those at 
Minneapolis' Walker Art Center -- Barnes is not without an established track 
record in the difficult job of gallery design. Although the Hammer Museum's 
collection does not encompass postwar art, nor is contemporary work expected to 
be a component of the temporary shows the museum will host, Barnes has chosen 
to rely on a spare architectural vocabulary familiar to showcases for recent 
painting and sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is small, including just five galleries in a total of about 14,000 
square feet. (For comparison, the Museum of Contemporary Art claims about 
25,000 square feet of exhibition space in its main building, and 50,000 square 
feet in its Little Tokyo annex.) The cream-white walls and lightly whitewashed, 
oak floors soften the boxy gallery spaces, which are subdivided into more 
intimate rooms by movable, free-standing walls. 
</P>
<P>
Interior articulation of these galleries is minimal but deft. The free-standing 
walls are substantial, not flimsy, creating flexible but solid rooms. Most 
important, their relatively modest height visually lowers the galleries' higher 
ceilings to a domestic scale, which is further evoked by simple baseboards 
along the bottom. Barnes, while retaining an institutional formality, has thus 
subtly managed to give the galleries a welcome intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
Two galleries for the permanent collection of paintings and for the collection 
of prints and small sculptures by Honore Daumier, as well as two galleries for 
temporary displays, also feature a well-handled system of electronically 
controlled skylights that gently wash the rooms with natural light. (For 
evenings and dark days, some skylights are equipped with concealed fluorescent 
tubes.) On visits made on two days under different conditions, the mix of 
natural and artificial lighting was handsome. 
</P>
<P>
In a manner reminiscent of Arata Isozaki's design for MOCA, skylights shaped 
like pyramids punctuate the high ceilings. As light enters the apex, the 
pyramid shape acts as a reflective baffle that spreads indirect daylight into 
the room, where it mixes with the artificial illumination typically found in 
museums. A photoelectric system of louvers automatically controls the amount of 
light admitted by the skylights, softening and diffusing it to protect the art. 
The only drawback is minor: When the louvers are closed, a dark hole can result 
overhead. 
</P>
<P>
The paintings gallery, which is the largest at 5,040 square feet, claims the 
most sophisticated use of skylights. A perimeter skylight rings the entire 
room, its visibly angled wall echoing the interior shape and function of the 
two pyramidal skylights also found in the gallery. This perimeter system, aside 
from its illuminating function, creates a quiet architectural illusion. Imagine 
the room surmounted by one large pyramid whose base is the ceiling, inside of 
which a pair of smaller pyramids are nested side by side. This illusion, more 
viscerally sensed than seen, is magical rather than showy or obtrusive. 
</P>
<P>
The one gallery that is showy is both the smallest and the least successful. 
Although not installed at preview time, it will house six upright cases for the 
display of portions of the Leicester Codex, a scientific manuscript written 
circa 1508-10 by Leonardo da Vinci. The small, barrel-vaulted room features 
finished plaster walls and limestone paving on the floor, with one end 
culminating in a semi-circular apse. 
</P>
<P>
The trite conceit is that this gallery is a modernist chapel -- a latter-day 
reliquary for the autographic text by the Divine Leonardo, and a shrine 
appropriate to a Renaissance palazzo, which is the metaphor Barnes has used to 
describe his overall plan for the Hammer Museum. Kept dark to protect the 
exceedingly fragile paper and ink of the Codex, whose individual pages will be 
lit by low-level spotlights in the display cases, the hushed room is also a 
noisy echo chamber. 
</P>
<P>
The chapel cliche and the echoes are annoyances far less problematic than a 
serious design flaw. The little room opens directly onto a small foyer whose 
glass doors lead outside. Open the door to the Codex gallery and one end of the 
room is flooded with light, which makes the preservation of fragile manuscript 
pages more than an academic question.

CRITIC AT LARGE: THE FILM INDUSTRY IS NOT JUST ANOTHER BUSINESS; 
</P>
<P>
STUDIOS: WITH MATSUSHITA'S ACQUISITION OF MCA / UNIVERSAL, THE MELANCHOLY FACT 
IS THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THE MAJOR FOUNDING UNITS OF THE U.S. MOVIE INDUSTRY 
ARE NOW IN FOREIGN HANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR

<TEXT>
<P>
The sale of MCA/Universal to Matsushita will, among many other things, call for 
some re-ranking in Forbes' list of the richest Americans and Fortune's lists of 
the 500 richest firms here and abroad. So much for the neutral news. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction is another blast of the icy winds of change that have been 
blowing through the whole American economy ever since we collectively began 
sending our dollars abroad for TV sets, VCRs and cars, cars, cars. 
</P>
<P>
It carries yet another message about an economic colossus being cut down to a 
new, lesser size. In other parts of the economy and indeed elsewhere in 
Hollywood, the changes in ownership betoken failures of American management to 
respond adequately, let alone forcefully and imaginatively, to new technologies 
and shifting marketplace tastes. 
</P>
<P>
The Universal buyout is different in one significant way from some of the other 
foreign purchases. Matsushita acquires a viable, well-managed and profitable 
concern. The price was a bargain, compared to the $3.4 billion Sony paid for 
Columbia, which was still in disarray when Sony bought it. 
</P>
<P>
Very little will change, keen observers in the investment community are saying. 
The foreign buyers, now representing not just Japan but Australia (Murdoch of 
Fox) and Italy (Parretti of MGM), simply want and need the product -- and, of 
course, the profits -- but are content to leave the driving to the locals, 
whose expertise they have long admired from afar. 
</P>
<P>
Coming from the paper-dollar experts in the sector that gave us Michael Milken, 
Ivan Boesky and Charles Keating, these reassurances are less serenely 
reassuring than they might be. 
</P>
<P>
The melancholy fact, sharp and inescapable, is that the ultimate shaping 
control of four historic segments (more than half of the major founding units) 
of the motion-picture industry has passed into foreign hands. And what is 
abundantly clear is that we probably have not seen the last of the studio 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
There seems nothing in Hollywood, nor in the country at large, that is nailed 
down -- if the price is right. The tax laws make it wise if not imperative for 
proprietors to sell, to cash in their gains. And in the present atmosphere of 
deregulation and non-regulation, the fact that foreign takeovers are often 
one-way streets seems to bother no one. (Universal could presumably not have 
bought Tojo Studios even if it had wanted to. T. Boone Pickens can't get on the 
board of a Japanese company of which he is a principal stockholder.) 
</P>
<P>
But the larger concern for anyone reading these symptoms of economic decline is 
that movies are not just another business. Picture-making began almost 
simultaneously in several countries -- Australia itself was making serials 
before 1920. Yet some fortunate conjunctions in creative history gave the 
American industry a world-dominating position it not only still has but has 
extended to television. 
</P>
<P>
And the importance of this global saturation was not simply the profits that 
have rolled back home on the plus side of the balance of trade. It has been the 
movies' exporting of ideas, images, aspirations, ideals bearing the American 
label. Some of the images -- notably as they still stress material possessions 
above all else -- have admittedly been delusive and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the simple presumptions about equality and justice as fundamentals of 
American society and as dramatized by the movies have had a powerful impact all 
over the world. And the freedom of the American screen to be critical of 
American society when it has fallen short of its own ideals has been watched 
with envy by audiences -- and filmmakers -- even in nominally democratic 
countries where the screen is guarded more circumspectly.

The freedom of the American film to deal with social and political issues here 
or abroad has been one of its glories (an infrequent glory, maybe, in a medium 
designed to divert and entertain, but a glory when it happens). This is not to 
say that things will inevitably change. But all the foreign buyouts are 
predicated on profits and the bottom line -- in considerations of which 
chance-taking and daring departures from the norm are anathema. A hard-eyed 
realism must suspect that the blockbuster mentality, series, remakes, prequels, 
sequels and Roman numerals generally will be in greater vogue than before, not 
less. 
</P>
<P>
Individual filmmakers or stars with clout, like Kevin Costner in the matter of 
"Dances With Wolves," may be able to buck the bottom-line mentality. But the 
fact that Akira Kurosawa, Japan's greatest filmmaker, had to look to the United 
States rather than to his own industry to be able to make "Kagemusha," "Ran" 
and "Dreams" does not invite confidence. 
</P>
<P>
And that old devil, the well-known chilling effect, is a presently incalculable 
consequence of all the takeovers. How will it play in Peoria is no longer the 
relevant geographic question. 
</P>
<P>
It is a new day in Hollywood, and no mistake. The question is what kind of a 
day it will be, and the weather reports are inconclusive.

RURAL, URBAN DIFFERENCES ENDANGER TRI-COUNTY PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A proposal to form a new regional coalition among Ventura, Santa Barbara and 
San Luis Obispo is in jeopardy because officials of the two northern counties 
say they have little in common with the more urban Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't believe there's a rationale for hooking up," said Michael G. 
Powers, deputy director of planning for the Santa Barbara County Assn. of 
Governments. "We have a few issues in common: air quality, beach erosion, water 
exchanges. But there are really no significant urban government issues." 
</P>
<P>
Powers said the staff of the Santa Barbara association will suggest to its 
board of directors in January that the proposal to form the tri-county group be 
turned down. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Camarillo officials sent a letter to each city in Ventura County 
urging local officials to pull out of the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments and form a coalition with the two counties to the north. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo officials said they fear that if the state Legislature passes a bill 
giving regional governments more power, Ventura County will be stuck in SCAG, 
which includes the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and several 
others in Southern California. They say that since Ventura County is not as 
urban as its southern neighbors, it would be overlooked when crucial decisions, 
such as where to build dumps, are made. 
</P>
<P>
"Our representation will be nil," Camarillo City Councilman Michael Morgan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Morgan said he was disappointed to learn of Powers' comments, he said 
Camarillo officials will continue pushing for tri-county government. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) introduced a 
bill that would have created regional agencies in the seven largest areas of 
the state to handle land-use planning and infrastructure development. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of stiff opposition from local governments, Brown withdrew the 
proposal in August. But he said he would introduce a modified bill when the new 
legislative session convenes in January. Complicating the matter is that SCAG 
officials are drawing up their own bill that would force cities within its 
jurisdiction to abide by its rules. 
</P>
<P>
SCAG now serves as an advisory committee that has little power. 
</P>
<P>
No other Ventura County city has voted to leave SCAG, although some officials 
have expressed an interest in forming a tri-county coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, the mayors of Simi Valley, Ojai and Camarillo are expected to meet with 
officials from Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties to discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Herron, a planner with the San Luis Obispo Area Coordinating Council, said 
officials there are intrigued by the idea of forming a regional government. But 
he also questioned whether Ventura County would fit in with San Luis Obispo and 
Santa Barbara counties. 
</P>
<P>
"It does seem like there are more differences than similarities," Herron said. 
</P>
<P>
Powers said that if Santa Barbara County joined with Ventura County, the 
northern county would be in the same position Ventura County now finds itself 
in with SCAG. 
</P>
<P>
"If we joined, Ventura County would have 62% of the population," Powers said. 
"They would have a great deal more authority. We would be concerned about that. 
It is the staff's position that we would be well advised to go at it alone."

MCGRATH LAND IS 4TH FINALIST FOR CSU SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Land owned by the McGrath family and lying in the flood plain of the Santa 
Clara River between Ventura and Oxnard is one of four final sites to be 
considered for a Cal State University campus, trustees decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 312-acre parcel is bordered by Harbor Boulevard to the west and straddles 
Gonzales Road, which would probably have to be rerouted to accommodate a 
university, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State does not want a campus divided by a major thoroughfare. But if 
Gonzales were rerouted to line the southern border of the river, it could be 
built up as a levee to prevent flood damage from the river, according to one 
proposal from consultants hired by the McGrath family. 
</P>
<P>
That multimillion-dollar project could get some financial or other support from 
the city of Oxnard or the McGrath family, although no formal arrangements have 
been made, said David Leveille, director of institutional relations for CSU. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears there is a strong city commitment to help work this through," 
Leveille said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the site could face a strong opponent in the city of Ventura, which 
contends that a university at the McGrath property would add to the already 
crowded Ventura Freeway interchanges at Seaward Avenue and Victoria Boulevard. 
The campus would also add to traffic along Harbor Boulevard, Ventura City 
Manager John Baker wrote in a letter to Cal State Vice Chancellor John M. 
Smart. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees, acting on recommendations from a Ventura County panel, also chose 
as possible university sites 448 acres of farmland south of Foothill Road and 
east of Ventura, 589 acres west of Camarillo and north of the Ventura Freeway, 
and 300 acres south of Wooley Road, south of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
All four will be studied in depth for potential consequences to the environment 
and suitability as a campus site for 15,000 students. The studies will help 
trustees decide on a final site in May. 
</P>
<P>
However, if consultants find during their studies that the McGrath property is 
environmentally or financially infeasible, the property will be dropped from 
consideration, Leveille said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are problems with all the sites to varying degrees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
William G. Haydon, senior engineer with the Ventura County Flood Control 
Department, said engineering and design could solve the problems of building in 
the flood plain. The university could build levees to contain the river or 
elevate all the buildings on the campus a foot or two, but those solutions 
would be expensive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as they stay out of the floodway, then dollars are the cure," he said, 
referring to the direct path of the river during heavy rains that cause the 
river to flood. 
</P>
<P>
Leveille said the university is not considering building a concrete channel to 
contain the river, similar to what has been done to the Los Angeles River 
through populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Capelli, a biologist and executive director of the Friends of the 
Ventura River, said any building near the river is an encroachment on the river 
environment and on wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
"If you've got urban uses in a flood-prone area, then the pressure is much 
greater to straighten out the channel and remove the vegetation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Gardiner Johnson, a planner for the California Coastal Commission, 
said protection of existing structures is a valid reason to build concrete 
channels for a river, according to the state's coastal plan. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is not yet existing development," she said. "We would be very 
concerned about the upstream effects that the development might have on the 
estuary downstream." 
</P>
<P>
Trustees chose the four sites as potential university locations after a 
four-year search in Ventura County. Taylor Ranch, which had been the trustees' 
preferred site, was eliminated after the owners declared that they would not 
sell without a legal battle and community opposition developed. 
</P>
<P>
Leveille said the McGrath property was added Tuesday to the site list after a 
discussion with flood control engineers, strong support expressed by the city 
of Oxnard and a hint by the McGrath family that it may be willing to donate a 
portion of the land. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Conway, a member of the family and an attorney representing the 
McGraths, said Tuesday, however, that the family "is not considering donating 
any land at this time."

ARMORY TO TAKE IN HOMELESS; 
</P>
<P>
WEATHER: SOCIAL WORKERS EXPECT MOST OF THE OXNARD FACILITY'S 100 BEDS TO BE 
USED ON COLD NIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Oxnard National Guard Armory will be opened as a shelter for the county's 
homeless population on cold and rainy nights starting Friday, the County Board 
of Supervisors ordered Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The board's decision was welcomed by representatives of social agencies that 
provide shelter to the county's estimated 4,000 to 6,000 homeless. In recent 
weeks, officials have been forced to double room occupancy or turn people away. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the third year in a row that the armory has been opened to the 
homeless. After an unusually mild winter last year, during which the armory 
averaged 59 guests per night, social workers said they expect most of the 
armory's 100 beds to be occupied this year as temperatures drop near freezing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be colder this time, so we expect a lot more people," said Staff 
Sgt. Daniel Quolos, night manager at the armory. 
</P>
<P>
For armory doors to open, the temperature must drop to 40 degrees or below, or 
less than 50 degrees with a 50% chance of rain. The building in the 300 block 
of South K Street will be open until March 31. 
</P>
<P>
The county's decision follows authorization by Gov. George Deukmejian to use 
National Guard armories throughout the state as temporary shelters. 
</P>
<P>
If weather conditions are met, the armory will be open from 7 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. 
and the homeless will be given dinner and a small breakfast, said Nancy 
Steinhelper, deputy director of the County Department of Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
The armory shelter will cost about $53,000 to operate, Steinhelper said. The 
county will provide $29,000 and the rest will be paid by donations from a group 
of private and nonprofit organizations including the American Red Cross, which 
has managed the program since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
While the shelter offers partitioned bed space for women and children, most of 
its users are men, Steinhelper said. Unlike the two year-round shelters 
operating in the county -- one of which specializes in homeless families, the 
other in drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs -- the armory has 
traditionally served the more transient segment of the homeless population, 
Steinhelper said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them are single men, and we don't force them to do anything," she 
said. "The only rules are that no weapons, alcohol or drugs are allowed." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, however, the Red Cross workers will provide social services 
and counseling on a voluntary basis. Also, this year the Red Cross will add a 
full-time coordinator and divide supervisorial duties among two crews so that 
workers are more rested to meet the needs of the homeless, said Martha Ruth 
Lefevre, Red Cross director of emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
"This year we're trying something new because it's not easy to to manage a 
shelter," Lefevre said. "It's very hard to get any rest because people wander 
in at all hours of the night." 
</P>
<P>
The armory's opening will bring much-needed relief to the other shelters, where 
bed space has all but disappeared after a week of cold, windy nights with 
temperatures dipping below 40. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard Rescue Mission, with 50 beds for homeless substance abusers, has 
been full for the past three nights and several people have been turned away, 
Assistant Director Carl Roberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very, very happy" about the armory shelter's opening, Roberg said. "We 
don't like turning people away, and this will help considerably with the 
overflow." 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard-based Zoe Christian Center also has been stretched thin by increased 
housing demands. 
</P>
<P>
Normally a 150-bed facility, the center is housing more than 160 homeless 
families already -- including an increasing number of migrant workers out of 
work since the fall harvest season ended, Director Jim Gilmore said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilmore said the armory shelter would help meet the needs of the homeless this 
winter, but more help from private groups and individuals also will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a tough winter," he said, "and the homeless shelters will 
need help. We need blankets, canned foods, volunteers. There are people out 
there who don't even have a blanket to wrap around themselves."

JUDGE URGES REJECTION OF PLAN TO JOIN 2 UTILITIES; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: PROPONENTS PREDICT THAT A FEDERAL COMMISSION WILL IGNORE THE 
JURIST'S OBJECTIONS AND APPROVE THE MERGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A federal law judge on Tuesday recommended that a proposed merger of Southern 
California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric be rejected, saying it would 
stifle competition, generate few benefits for customers and increase smog in 
Ventura County and other parts of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
But utility executives predicted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
would ignore many of the law judge's more strident objections and issue a 
favorable, final decision on the merger early next year. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation to the five-member commission delighted merger opponents in 
Ventura County and elsewhere who are pressing state and federal regulators to 
block the move to create the nation's largest electric utility. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a final decision, but it is a real victory for cleaner air," said 
Patricia Baggerly of the Environmental Coalition of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Area environmentalists and city officials in Simi Valley, Oxnard, Ojai and 
Ventura oppose the merger because, if it is approved, Edison plans to shift 
electricity generation from older San Diego power plants to newer ones in 
Oxnard. The increased electrical load would add hundreds of tons of pollutants 
to the county's air every year for at least four years. 
</P>
<P>
In making the final decision, commissioners have the option of rejecting or 
accepting all or part of the report written by Administrative Law Judge George 
P. Lewnes after he conducted the FERC's merger hearings this past summer in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The federal merger review is one of two remaining hurdles for utility 
executives who proposed the merger in late 1988. The California Public 
Utilities Commission is also conducting a review, which is scheduled to be 
completed early in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
While Lewnes' report focused largely on antitrust concerns, it also faulted the 
utilities for failing to prove that the merger would lower customers' electric 
rates and said it would hurt air quality. 
</P>
<P>
"The pollutants in the South Coast, San Diego and Ventura areas will increase 
under the merger to levels beyond those absent the merger, levels found to be 
unacceptable by the Environmental Protection Agency and other state agencies," 
Lewnes wrote in his 125-page report. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Ventura County officials objected to Edison's plans to increase 
electricity production and pollution at power plants at Ormond Beach and 
Mandalay Bay. But county officials agreed not to oppose the merger after Edison 
promised several anti-smog measures, including converting the diesel engines 
used to pump oil around the county to cleaner electric motors. 
</P>
<P>
Under a final agreement, Edison would increase air pollutants in the county 
through 1995 in exchange for more substantial reductions in smog through the 
next 20 years. However, Edison's promises failed to satisfy all critics, such 
as city leaders in Oxnard and Simi Valley, which would receive the largest 
initial increases of smog. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at five years of increased smog," said Simi Valley Mayor Greg 
Stratton. "So if this ruling holds us, at least we will keep the status quo. 
Most of what happens in Oxnard gets blown into Simi Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Richard L. Baldwin, manager of the county's Air Pollution District, said if the 
merger is blocked, it would reduce the leverage to get Edison to help replace 
the dirtiest diesel engines that operate the county's oil fields. But he said 
it would also eliminate concerns of critics who contend that Edison's promises 
of anti-smog measures weren't good enough. 
</P>
<P>
"It would certainly be easier on me if it were not approved," he said. "I 
wouldn't have to continue explaining why our agreement with Edison would work." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Mayor Maureen O'Connor, an outspoken opponent of the planned 
merger, said the judge's ruling bolstered her claim that the merger was 
designed to benefit Edison shareholders, not electric customers. Opponents in 
San Diego suggested that the strongly worded ruling should kill the deal. 
</P>
<P>
But SDG&amp;E Vice President Lee Haney said commissioners might ignore the more 
negative portions of Lewnes' report. In 1988, Haney said, commissioners 
rejected an equally bleak recommendation from Lewnes when they unanimously 
approved Portland-based Pacific Power &amp; Light's now-completed merger with 
Utah Power &amp; Light. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not unexpected," said Edison spokesman Lewis Phelps, who maintained 
that Lewnes is known to believe that "larger utilities are by definition 
anti-competitive." 
</P>
<P>
An attorney who is familiar with FERC proceedings on Tuesday said that 
commissioners can -- and do -- toss administrative law judges' recommendations 
aside if they believe that the reports incorrectly represent testimony taken 
during hearings. "That's what they did with Pacific Power and they could do it 
again here," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Phelps said Lewnes' recommendation ignored Edison's contention that the merger 
will generate $1.7 billion in savings that would be passed on to utility 
customers. Haney said Lewnes also ignored an agreement that the utilities have 
reached with the federal Department of Justice that would eliminate antitrust 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development Tuesday, state PUC Chairman G. Mitchell Wilk 
acknowledged in a prepared statement that the PUC's long-running merger review 
won't be completed by the end of December, the original target date. 
</P>
<P>
Wilk's statement ended hopes that the PUC would meet its self-imposed deadline. 
That goal was dashed, according to Wilk's statement, by the need for "extensive 
and careful analysis" of the thousands of pages of evidence that have been 
submitted. 
</P>
<P>
Edward J. Tirello Jr., a New York-based utility industry analyst, predicted 
Tuesday that the PUC would issue a decision favorable to the utilities. "The 
PUC is a pretty level-headed group," Tirello said. "I think they're going to 
issue a (positive) decision."

COUNCIL TO EXPLORE ENLARGING THE CITY

<P>
The Ojai City Council decided Tuesday to explore forming a larger city to 
govern more of the Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The council will advertise for a consultant and appoint a citizens committee to 
study possible city boundaries, public opinion and the legal and financial 
issues involved. 
</P>
<P>
A public forum will be held on Dec. 18 to invite suggestions for the study. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jim Loebl, who opposed the county's attempt to form a valleywide 
city in 1981, requested the study in September. 
</P>
<P>
Greater control of the valley could ward off urban growth and offer a wider tax 
base to provide more services, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai, population 7,501, is the only municipality in the 10-mile-long valley, 
where another 25,600 people live in the communities of Meiners Oaks, Mira 
Monte, Oak View, Casitas Springs and the upper Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The unincorporated area is growing twice as fast as Ojai. Since 1984, Ventura 
County has issued about 1,015 building permits in the valley, whereas the city 
has issued 130. 
</P>
<P>
While some rural residents support annexation or incorporation, others fear 
that higher taxes or building restrictions could result from municipal 
government. THIA BELL

<P>
A group representing the unincorporated community of Oak Park plans to launch a 
petition drive for cityhood on Monday, an official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Oak Park Municipal Advisory Council are looking for volunteers 
to gather signatures in support of forming the new city, said Ron Stark, a 
member of the council. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of the council members say they want to create a city, which would 
have local control over land use and development around Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member Municipal Advisory Council merely acts as an adviser to the 
County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood supporters must collect signatures of about 25% of the registered 
voters. There are about 4,500 registered voters, said Duane Skavdahl, another 
member of the council. PSYCHE PASCUAL

<P>
Amid flattering speeches and hearty handshakes, the winners of the Nov. 6 
election -- Nao Takasugi, Manuel Lopez and Michael Plisky -- were sworn in as 
Oxnard city councilmen in a brief ceremony Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
All three acknowledged that because of tight finances, the city faces a 
difficult future. 
</P>
<P>
But they vowed to work together to solve the city's problems.

Takasugi, who won a fifth two-year term as mayor by receiving 45% of the vote, 
thanked his wife, Judy, for her support in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez won his fourth four-year term on the council by receiving about 17% of 
the vote. He said some family members were initially opposed to him running 
again. But he said after he made the decision, the entire family gave him full 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Plisky, a former council member who won 22% of the vote, said he has not always 
agreed with other council members but promised to try to work in harmony within 
the council for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
During a light moment in the ceremony, Takasugi poked fun at Plisky when City 
Clerk Mabi Plisky, the new councilman's wife, told him where to stand so that 
he could take his oath of office. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like home; Mike takes orders from Mabi," Takasugi said, amid laughter 
from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Before starting the regular meeting, each council member praised Ann Johs, who 
lost her reelection bid after five years on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Johs said she will stay active in community service organizations. "I'm not 
dead and buried," she said. "I have a lot more to do." HUGO MARTIN

PART OF ROAD NAMED AFTER AUTO CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
About half a block of Ventura Road leading to the Ventura Auto Center will be 
renamed Auto Center Drive and freeway signs with the new name will be posted on 
the Ventura Freeway, the Ventura City Council has decided. 
</P>
<P>
Car dealers and owners of the Auto Center asked that the signs be posted and 
that the 100-foot stretch of road between the Johnson Drive off-ramp from the 
Ventura Freeway and Leland Street be renamed so their businesses would get more 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the decision Monday, new street signs will be put up within a 
month, City Clerk Barbara Kam said. The California Department of Transportation 
will put up the freeway signs and that will probably take longer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the businesses asked that all of Leland Street, which runs in front 
of the car dealerships, be renamed Auto Center Drive. But executives at Valex 
Corp., also located on Leland, objected that the new address would be 
inappropriate for their company, which manufactures stainless steel for 
semiconductors and the pharmaceutical industry. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the new name, businessmen are seeking permission to put up a 
16-foot electronic sign in the Auto Center that would flash ads visible from 
the freeway. The proposal will not come before the City Council until early 
next year, Kam said, but some officials have already said the sign would be an 
eyesore. MAJA RADEVICH

STILL IN HARM'S WAY;

<P>
METHOD TO PREVENT ACCIDENTS INVOLVING PIT CREWS ELUDES AUTO RACING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pit row accidents, even fatalities, are not new to motor racing, but the recent 
death of a crewman during a NASCAR race in Atlanta has refocused attention on 
one of racing's most perplexing problems -- how to reduce high-speed congestion 
in the pits. 
</P>
<P>
The crux of the problem is this: Every second spent pitting -- which includes 
slowing down, getting fuel and tires, and getting back to racing speed -- can 
be worth 100 yards on a superspeedway. Drivers work for laps to get around 
another car and they don't want to lose that advantage when they come in for 
midrace service. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if there is an answer," Dale Earnhardt, the four-time Winston Cup 
stock car champion, said when asked about the subject. "I know it's not safe 
the way we're doing it, but is there any safe way? The drivers think about it 
and talk about it, but so far no one's come up with a better idea. If some one 
does, we'll all listen." 
</P>
<P>
Most pit stops -- in both NASCAR and the Championship Auto Racing Team's Indy 
car races -- are made during caution flag periods, when speeds on the race 
track are reduced from 200 m.p.h. to 65 or 70 behind a pace car. Obviously, 
time spent in the pits under yellow flag conditions is not as costly as time 
spent there under green flag -- full speed -- conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Caution periods create another problem, however. When a yellow flag is 
displayed, it usually triggers high-speed gridlock along pit row as from 25 to 
35 cars come in at the same time. Drivers who have been racing at speeds of up 
to 200 are asked to slow down and find a 26-foot patch of pavement where their 
crew awaits with 22 gallons of fuel and two or four tires. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've been going 200 and slow down to 75 or 100, it feels like you're 
going about 10," one driver said. "You think you've got plenty of space to stop 
when you hit the brakes, but it's not always true." 
</P>
<P>
That, essentially, was what happened in Atlanta 10 days ago when Ricky Rudd 
came down the pit road and hit the brakes. His car spun and whiplashed into the 
side of Bill Elliott's pitted car, pinning crewman Mike Rich between them. The 
impact crushed Rich's chest, and he died a few hours later of a heart attack 
while undergoing surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing like this ever happened to me before," Rudd said. "I'm tore up about 
it. I don't know if I hit a grease spot or what, but when I hit the brakes they 
locked up and spun the car around. Hitting a car is one thing, but hitting a 
human being was tragic." 
</P>
<P>
Earnhardt pinpointed a problem inherent to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the only track where the pit row is slanted in toward the wall," he 
said. "Instead of being flat, or slanted out toward the track, it tends to 
pitch your car in toward the crew. That's apparently what happened to Rudd. 
Once a car breaks loose, it slides downhill and that's toward the pit wall." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in four years that Elliott's crew was hit while doing 
its job in the pits. In the 1987 Winston Western 500 at Riverside International 
Raceway, Elliott's car was pitted when Michael Waltrip's car was hit from 
behind and knocked into Elliott's pit area. 
</P>
<P>
Although he did not make contact with Elliott's car, Waltrip slid into four 
crewmen. Chuck Hill, a neighbor of Elliott's from Dawsonville, Ga., suffered 
serious internal injuries, a dislocated hip and broken arm. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Elliott, Bill's younger brother and a member of the crew, suffered bruises 
in both accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Melling, owner of Elliott's car, was so distraught after the Atlanta 
incident that he said he is considering pulling out of racing. 
</P>
<P>
Earnhardt's crew came within a few seconds of a similar accident at Charlotte. 
His crew had changed the right tires and were switching to the other side when 
Alan Kulwicki and Ernie Irvan tangled and Irvan's car spun into Earnhardt's. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have been identical to what happened to Elliott's guys if it had 
happened a split second earlier," an observer said. "The right tire guy -- the 
one who got killed at Atlanta -- had just moved out of the way when the car got 
hit." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the crew most in peril is the driver's own. 
</P>
<P>
At Phoenix, a car driven by Ted Musgrave didn't stop in time and slid into his 
waiting jack man. Jeff (Pancho) Walton was knocked 10 feet into the air, but 
his only injuries were a bruised knee and leg. 
</P>
<P>
"Our driver came in a little too hot," crew chief D.K. Ulrich said. 
</P>
<P>
That is what NASCAR must address -- how to keep drivers from coming in "a 
little too hot." 
</P>
<P>
Les Richter, vice president of competition, says the matter is being studied 
and that a solution will be announced before the opening race of 1991 at 
Daytona. The rule would be in effect for all Winston Cup and Busch Grand 
National races. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be something that will slow cars down on pit row, both coming in 
and going out," Richter said from his offices in Daytona Beach, Fla. "The 
mechanics of how to implement it are not yet in place, but the plans are to 
have such a severe penalty for excessive speed that drivers will not want to 
take the chance of being sent to the rear of the field." 
</P>
<P>
Pace-car speeds vary from track to track. At Bristol and some short tracks, 
pace-car driver Elmo Langley will hold it down as low as 35 m.p.h., but on the 
high banks at Daytona it is 70. Drivers are informed of the planned speed at 
their prerace meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"When cars on the track are running 65 or 70 and you see someone like Earnhardt 
going through the pits at what looks like about 120, it catches your 
attention," one NASCAR official said. "It also catches the attention of the 
other drivers and pretty soon the pits are like a speed trap." 
</P>
<P>
Richter said: "The one thing we must prevent is drivers coming in hell-bent for 
election and speeding out the same way in hopes of picking up a position or two 
on the track. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to take away the speed of the crew in doing their job of 
refueling and changing tires, but we must slow the cars down while entering and 
exiting their pit." 
</P>
<P>
Crews are as proud of their times in refueling and changing tires as drivers 
are of winning pole positions. Geoff Bodine, third-place finisher in this 
season's Winston Cup standings, bragged about his crew members being so fast 
that they gave him barely enough time to sip a cup of water. 
</P>
<P>
"At Darlington, Junior Johnson's guys did a two-tire, right side change with a 
full load of fuel consistently at 12.5 seconds," Bodine said. "That just gave 
me enough time to grab the tube from my on-board juice jug and get a couple of 
fast swallows before it was time to go. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not complaining, though, because most of the other teams were taking 
between 13.5 and 15 seconds, and I could tell the difference when I got back on 
the track. The crew's best one, though, was a four-tire change with fuel in 
18.5 seconds. That was awesome." 
</P>
<P>
Richter said that NASCAR has rejected several widely circulated rumored changes 
in pit procedure, among them freezing the field in the position they held at 
the time a yellow flag was displayed, and permitting pitting only under the 
green flag. 
</P>
<P>
"They tried freezing positions at Indy and it didn't work," he said. "There is 
no end to the confusion you can have trying to fit cars into their place on the 
track. You could lose five or six laps just trying to get the mess straightened 
out. Or you could end up with a lot of bellyaching and arguing, like they did 
that time at Indy." 
</P>
<P>
Richter was refering to the 1981 Indy 500, in which apparent winner Bobby Unser 
passed a number of cars while coming out of the pits. When he was penalized a 
lap, the victory fell to Mario Andretti. Later, after several court sessions, 
Unser was fined $40,000 but reinstated as the winner. 
</P>
<P>
"The green flag-only idea means the drivers and crews would be trying to be 
even faster than they are today because time lost under the green is so much 
more costly than time lost under the yellow," Richter said. "They could be so 
rushed (to get their car back out) that they could let it go with a loose lug 
nut or something equally as dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"We stress pit safety and pit strategy at every driver's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, we set no specific speed limits on how fast they could run in the 
pit lane. We warned drivers of the consequences and asked them to be careful 
and considerate, but what it has come down to is that there is just too much 
competition these days. We are using pit procedures we used 10 to 15 years ago 
and times have changed. Drivers didn't have the urgency then that they have 
today because the competition was so much less intense." 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, for instance, there were 30 races and Richard Petty, Cale Yarborough, 
Bobby Allison and David Pearson won all but one. This year there were 29 races 
and 14 different winners. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't change places with them cats that change tires for a minute," Petty 
said. "It used to be that we'd come in at different times and pit stops were 
part of the strategy. Nowadays it's chaos. There's so many cars in there every 
time they drop a yellow flag you don't know where you're at sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Pit accidents, of course, are not confined to NASCAR. Anywhere there are 
vehicles built for speed being maneuvered in and around narrow passages where 
human beings are standing or working, the situation is volatile. No matter how 
safety-conscious crewmen or drivers are, accidents happen. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Andretti was coming into the pits once during an Indy car race when a 
mechanic working on another car grabbed a piece of hot metal and instinctively 
jumped backwards -- directly into the path of Andretti's speeding car. He died 
of injuries the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Another year at Indianapolis, a crewman was killed when he was run down by an 
emergency vehicle going the wrong way through the pits. 
</P>
<P>
Even drag strips, where cars are all going the same direction -- in a straight 
line -- can be unsafe. Herb Parks, a longtime crew chief for Don Garlits, was 
killed while helping line up Rocky Epperly's car after a burnout at DeSoto 
Dragway in Bradenton, Fla.

MIKE DOWNEY: THIS REALLY ISN'T A HIGH ENOUGH PRICE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Crime doesn't pay, but criminals do. They pay. They pay money. That's how some 
of them pay for their sins. With money. That's how they buy their way out of 
trouble. With money. That's how they avoid getting off scot-free. They pay 
scot. 
</P>
<P>
And this is the way sinners, too, pay for their sins. With money. A little 
green paint covers everything. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody from the New England Patriots got suspended Tuesday over the female 
sportswriter incident. Nobody got hauled before a judge. Nobody got taken 
downtown for questioning. Some Ivy Leaguer came around and asked them if they 
had been good little boys or bad little boys, then told them to be good for 
goodness' sake. Santa Claus is coming to town. OK, so they got away with it. 
They beat the rap. The quality of mercy wasn't the teensiest bit strained. 
</P>
<P>
You say $72,500 in fines is a pretty stiff price to pay for a non-criminal 
offense? Fine. Fines are fine. Just be aware that these Patriot people are 
laughing all the way to the bank. Just be aware that Zeke Mowatt's $12,500 tab 
will be creatively accounted for in his next contract, or be covered by some 
team emergency fund, or be raised by some citizens' committee that thinks the 
poor Zekester got a raw deal. They'll rally like Amish farmers to help him 
rebuild his barn. 
</P>
<P>
As for the little shaver himself, Victor Kiam, he has to ante up $25,000 in 
fines and $25,000 additional to supply material to NFL athletes instructing 
them on how to behave like upright human beings instead of like prehistoric 
cave people who walk on all fours. 
</P>
<P>
They say this man who owns the Patriots and an electric-razor company has been 
up to his stubble in financial problems lately, so maybe this $50,000 fine 
couldn't come at a worse time for him. 
</P>
<P>
Good. 
</P>
<P>
This is the price Kiam and the Patriots must pay to accept fully the 
realization that the bullying and physical, sexual and emotional harassment of 
innocent bystanders cannot be tolerated . . . not by the NFL, NHL, NBA, NBC, 
NCAA, NAACP, CPAs, CIA, TWA, PTA, PGA, FBI, IBM, IRS, NOW or USA. 
</P>
<P>
For those who missed it -- and continue and continue and continue to miss the 
point -- Lisa Olson of the Boston Herald was only doing her job. She was in 
that Patriot locker room legally, properly and professionally. She wasn't a 
trespasser. She wasn't off-limits. She was working. If what happened to her had 
happened to a doctor, lawyer, waitress, homeless woman or any woman you happen 
to know, it would not have been any more or less forgivable. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Olson got mind-raped. These men affronted her and emotionally manhandled 
her, in an era and a setting wherein no woman should take even a man's vaguest 
suggestions too lightly. Anybody who believes this behavior falls under the 
category of locker-room "hijinks" is either a fool or a male, which is often 
redundant. 
</P>
<P>
What a world it is we live in when an adult woman doing her job, a trained 
journalist taking notes after a football practice, can be subjected to a 
frontal assault by amateur flashers and professional bullies and then become, 
in some eyes, not the victim but the villain, thereafter the object of public 
scorn and vile threats and hateful mail. How disgusting. How distressing. How 
borderline horrifying. 
</P>
<P>
The woman went to a basketball game and had a full cup of beer hurled at her. 
For what? For being brutalized by football players? For having the audacity to 
be standing in a room? For believing that she was entitled to make a living and 
be treated with a little civilized common dignity? 
</P>
<P>
All Olson wanted was two things: For the Patriots to acknowledge what they did, 
and for the NFL to acknowledge that there would be hell to pay should it ever 
happen again. 
</P>
<P>
Well, there may not be that to pay, but there is money to pay. And that's 
something, at least. Mowatt is $12,500 lighter today, and Michael Timpson and 
Robert Perryman have five grand apiece to fork over, and then there's the 
$25,000 that will go toward pamphlets and instructional videos that NFL players 
will be obliged to watch like airline passengers being told how to buckle that 
seat belt and use that foam cushion for flotation. 
</P>
<P>
Good. 
</P>
<P>
It's a start. Nobody is saying athletes should accommodate anyone and everyone 
who ventures into their locker rooms. They can dress, undress, talk, balk, 
yell, smell, scratch, spit, hurry, linger, heckle, howl or just sprinkle their 
stinky armpits with baby powder, whatever they want. It's their room. 
</P>
<P>
Just don't abuse anybody. Any time. Any place. 
</P>
<P>
No amount of money in the world can buy you respect.

NFL FINES PATRIOTS IN HARASSMENT CASE; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: KIAM, THE CLUB AND THREE PLAYERS ARE TOLD TO PAY A TOTAL OF 
$72,500. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The National Football League fined the New England Patriots $72,500 Tuesday for 
sexual harassment of Boston Herald sportswriter Lisa Olson, penalizing the club 
$50,000 and three players a total of $22,500. 
</P>
<P>
Although he suspended no one, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the players 
were guilty of harassing Olson Sept. 17 and that the club "appeared to condone 
the misconduct." 
</P>
<P>
The principals all refused to speak for the record but one source said that 
others in the league concluded quickly that the fines were surprisingly modest. 
In TV revenue alone, the Patriots are averaging $30 million annually, and NFL 
players' salaries average $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue said he was dividing the $72,500 in fines as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Victor K. Kiam II, club owner, $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Zeke Mowatt, Patriot tight end, $12,500. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michael Timpson, cornerback, $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Robert Perryman, a Patriot running back last September, now with the Dallas 
Cowboys, $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the club has been assessed $25,000 to provide a wider range of 
print and videotape materials for NFL personnel advising "responsible dealings 
with the media." 
</P>
<P>
Among the players, Mowatt's fine was the largest, Tagliabue said, because "his 
conduct involved both verbal and demonstrative actions" when "two or three 
players . . . paused and 'modeled' themselves briefly (near Olson)." 
</P>
<P>
The quotes are from special counsel Philip Heymann's 60-page report, which 
Tagliabue endorsed. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe Olson's account," Heymann, a Harvard law school professor, said in 
his report. 
</P>
<P>
Mowatt's account, he added, "is not credible." 
</P>
<P>
Continuing, Heymann, who in the 1970s was a Watergate prosecutor, said: "Nine 
of the (70) people interviewed saw (Mowatt) walk toward (Olson in the locker 
room). . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Other players were laughing (and shouting) in the background. . . . (There 
was) a good deal of responsive banter. One player estimated that at least 10 
players were involved in (the) joking concerning (Olson's) presence down by the 
shower. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"No one tried to bring the humiliating activity around Lisa Olson to a stop. 
Neither players nor management personnel said or did anything (to stop it)." 
</P>
<P>
Heymann was unavailable for comment. So were Kiam, Olson, Tagliabue and the 
players. Prepared statements by all were faxed to the press. 
</P>
<P>
A Patriot spokesman said that Kiam, who reportedly has threatened to fire some 
of his employees in connection with the charges and the investigation, will 
have "no more comments today, tomorrow or next week." 
</P>
<P>
In his one-paragraph statement, Kiam said: "The Patriots will certainly abide 
by (Tagliabue's) judgments. We regret that the incident occurred. The team and 
I previously expressed our apologies and we repeat them once again." 
</P>
<P>
Said Olson: "My satisfaction with the investigation and subsequent sanctions is 
surpassed only by my wish the disgraceful incident had never occurred in the 
first place." 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue, in a letter to Kiam, said: "This entire episode was distasteful, 
unnecessary and damaging to the league and others. . . . There was a serious 
lack of direction, control and supervision by the Patriots. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"(Heymann's) report is thorough and balanced. . . . The Patriots' organization 
and its players have learned a hard lesson." 
</P>
<P>
The Assn. for Women in Sports Media, in a statement by its president, Michele 
Himmelberg of the Orange County Register, said: "(The) penalties should send a 
clear message to every coach and athlete: Sexual harassment will not be 
tolerated in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the association, however, as well as many male reporters throughout 
the country, were reportedly disturbed by the comparatively small fines. 
</P>
<P>
But in her statement, Himmelberg said: "AWSM is less concerned (with the size 
of) the penalties than we are with the message they deliver." 
</P>
<P>
Heymann said in his report, which included many pages of earthy locker-room 
dialogue, that the harassment incident began when Olson sought to interview 
Maurice Hurst after a Patriot practice. 
</P>
<P>
"Olson (was) crouching directly in front of Hurst 'like a baseball catcher,' in 
the words of one player. At some point, Olson sat down on the floor while in 
that location. 
</P>
<P>
"In both instances, Olson was keeping her back to the general locker-room 
population. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of players commented to each other that Olson was crouching or 
sitting on the floor rather than standing or sitting on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
That started it all, according to the report, which continues: "When (Patriot 
publicist) James Oldham arrived in the locker room and saw Olson seated on the 
floor, he approached her and whispered, 'Stand up, Lisa,' because he thought it 
was inappropriate for her to sit on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"She then moved to the bench and sat to the right of Hurst (and) continued the 
interview facing Hurst (and) the shower room entryway. There was no room on the 
bench on the other side of Hurst, facing away from the showers. 
</P>
<P>
"At least 22 players saw (her there). A number of them commented (on) her 
presence near the . . . shower entry." 
</P>
<P>
The harassment followed.

MYRICKS' SUSPENSION CUT FROM LIFETIME TO ONE YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After being informed Tuesday that the executive committee of The Athletics 
Congress had commuted his lifetime suspension to a one-year ban, long jumper 
Larry Myricks responded with disappointment rather than relief. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hoping for the indoor season," said Myricks, who was ranked No. 2 in 
the world last year. "We figured all along that they (had) intended to keep me 
out for (at least) a year." 
</P>
<P>
Myricks will be reinstated April 13, which will allow him to compete in the 
outdoor season but will bar him from the indoor season and the World Indoor 
Championships. Myricks, a four-time Olympian, is the two-time world indoor long 
jump champion. 
</P>
<P>
During a period from Jan. 12 to Feb. 27, Myricks tested positive three times at 
indoor meets for phenylpropanolamine, a banned stimulant. 
</P>
<P>
According to IAAF rules, with the third positive test an athlete is suspended 
for life. 
</P>
<P>
Myricks, 34, has been ineligible to compete for the last nine months. He had 
appealed his suspension and had a handful of hearings. He had previously 
applied for reinstatement and was denied. The latest panel, which met last 
week, recommended that Myricks be reinstated. The executive committee of The 
Athletics Congress, which governs track and field in the United States, met 
Monday night in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Myricks has maintained that he took Alka-Seltzer Plus to combat flu symptoms 
during the winter. The stimulant phenylpropanolamine is found in that medicine. 
Some athletes are believed to take the drug as a performance boost. 
</P>
<P>
Myricks, who lives in Upland, said Tuesday he is dissatisfied with the entire 
procedure, which will keep him out of competition -- his means of earning a 
living -- for a year. He said that TAC's strict drug-testing program still has 
"glitches." 
</P>
<P>
"My first reinstatement was denied, and they never told us why," Myricks said. 
"I still think it went a lot longer than it had to. TAC wants to be tough and 
put its foot down and show that it has the biggest, baddest program." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he felt any satisfaction with the reinstatement, Myricks again had 
mixed emotions: "The reinstatement is good, but the stigma will still be 
there."

BICKNELL FIRED BY BOSTON COLLEGE

Jack Bicknell, who coached Boston College to four bowl games in his first six 
seasons but had losing records in his last four, was fired Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bicknell departs after a 4-7 season in which the Eagles lost their last four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
His 10-year record was 59-55-1. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no bitterness," Bicknell said after a meeting with Boston College 
President J. Donald Monan. "I think they made a mistake. I think they got rid 
of a good coach." 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles went 5-6 in 1981, Bicknell's first season as football coach, but a 
freshman named Doug Flutie emerged as the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Boston College went 8-3-1, 9-3 and 10-2 the next three seasons. The Eagles lost 
the Tangerine Bowl to Auburn, 33-26, in 1982 and the Liberty Bowl to Notre 
Dame, 19-18, in 1983. In 1984, Flutie's senior season, they beat Houston, 
45-28, in the Cotton Bowl.

NEWSWIRE: WBC ENJOINED FROM PUNISHING HOLYFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge in Paterson, N.J., ruled that the World Boxing Council cannot strip 
heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield of his title for fighting former 
champion George Foreman, pending arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Acting Tuesday on a suit filed by Main Events-Monitor Production, Inc., and 
Holyfield, State Superior Court Judge Amos Saunders ordered the WBC to show 
cause why it should not submit to arbitration with the plaintiffs "in 
accordance with the plaintiffs' demands for arbitration filed with the American 
Arbitration Assn." 
</P>
<P>
Saunders also enjoined the WBC from withdrawing championship recognition from 
Holyfield "pending completion and resolution" of the arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield knocked out Buster Douglas in Las Vegas last month to take the title, 
and signed a contract to make his first defense against Foreman April 19. The 
WBC had threatened to strip Holyfield of his title if he does not defend 
against Mike Tyson first.

RUELAS WINS STATE FEATHERWEIGHT TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rafael Ruelas of Arleta won the state featherweight championship Tuesday night 
by stopping Richard Abila of Los Angeles in the seventh round of a scheduled 
12-round fight at the Country Club in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Ruelas, 19, ran his record to 22-0 with his 19th knockout. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time he fought for a title. 
</P>
<P>
Ruelas knocked Abila down midway into the seventh round with a straight left 
and the referee stopped the fight. Ruelas dominated the fight, winning each 
round easily as Abila (16-7) threw few punches and didn't land many. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, former middleweight contender Alex Ramos, a New Yorker living in Simi 
Valley, weathered a severe beating early in the fifth round and stopped Roberto 
Rosiles at the end of the round. 
</P>
<P>
It was Ramos' second victory in two fights since a two-year layoff. A member of 
the 1980 U.S. Olympic team, he spent more than 20 months in state prison on an 
assault conviction. 
</P>
<P>
He was taking a pounding in the fifth when he landed a right under Rosiles' 
left ear and followed it with a right to the body. 
</P>
<P>
Rosiles went down from the second punch. After the bell, his handlers asked the 
ringside doctor to stop the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos is 30-8-2. Rosiles, of Mexicali, Mexico, is 21-12-1. 
</P>
<P>
In another preliminary bout, heavyweight Rocky Pepeli of Burbank, knocked down 
by a left hook to the chin in the second round, came back to stop William 
Morris of Ontario in the third round.

MELVIN DURSLAG: HYPOCRISY IMPERILS THE FUTURE FOR ROSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In January -- maybe even in December -- Pete Rose will stroll from the 
jailhouse where he has been consigned for a memory flaw. 
</P>
<P>
He forgot to pay his taxes, an oversight not recommended, but not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
Re-entering society, Pete will create a dilemma for (a) those in baseball asked 
to decide whether he should be given employment and (b) those voting for the 
Hall of Fame, pressed to determine whether one doing time, and suspended from 
the game, belongs in their shrine. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that one decision will be linked to the other, which is to say, 
unless Rose is readmitted to baseball, Hall of Fame voters might find him unfit 
for approval. 
</P>
<P>
Pete has done a lot of things in life distressingly stupid, but he has been 
smart enough to keep a low profile during his incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
He has reduced the profile, in fact, to non-existent, rejecting all publicity 
on the ground that news of him might enhance the status of those gathering it, 
but not of Pete. 
</P>
<P>
Jail is an ugly experience. Rose wants out and obviously he wants to return to 
baseball, which he knows something about. 
</P>
<P>
At anything else, he has to be a bust. He can't build bridges. He can't write 
poetry. He can't sell. And in today's competitive market, it isn't likely he 
could make a go of saving souls. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's piety in connection with the Rose case is the least bit repulsive. 
The game has been grandstanding, creating the impression that forgiveness of 
its wayward sons is a bigger deal than it is in other sports. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Johnson is back on the track. And what sin greater than cheating in the 
Olympics, holiest of athletic endeavors? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson cheated. He used substances banned by Olympic law. His victory was 
negated. He brought disgrace to his country. 
</P>
<P>
But he is back in business, because punishment needn't be forever. 
</P>
<P>
Dexter Manley, a three-time drug loser, is back in football, forgiven with tons 
of others, in all sports, for drug violations. 
</P>
<P>
Lester Piggott, England's most successful jockey -- the Bill Shoemaker of his 
land -- is back at work. Lester served a year for income tax evasion, a god 
giving racing the blackest of eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Muhammad Ali ducked the draft at a time America didn't consider it good form. 
He not only was forgiven, but Louisville named a street after him. 
</P>
<P>
And during his early and middle years in pro basketball, was Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar saint-like? He went around punching guys. One night, he 
sneak-punched a player named Kent Benson, injuring him badly. In an off-season 
pickup game, he punched some nondescript, breaking the man's jaw. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in the end, Abdul-Jabbar departed a conquering hero, if not a patriarch. 
</P>
<P>
Need you be reminded that one Super Bowl Sunday, the wife of Darryl Strawberry 
told police her husband came home and broke her nose? 
</P>
<P>
If this happened, as charged, how would baseball, so tenderly sensitive to the 
game's image, compare wife-beating as a sin to betting? 
</P>
<P>
And would those Hall of Fame voters, guarding the ramparts of baseball 
integrity, turn down a guy who bet and vote in one who busted up a wife? 
</P>
<P>
Did George Steinbrenner, making a burlesque of baseball, not do more to damage 
the game than Pete Rose? And look how long George survived before getting the 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
The mad course followed by Rose hardly is recommended here, but when the 
jailhouse doors open and he comes to baseball, which he served most of his 
life, asking for a job, we don't see it as a major concession if he gets one. 
</P>
<P>
We don't even see the need for deep and profound soul-searching. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner was forgiven for an act of lunacy that all but got him chased across 
the border. 
</P>
<P>
Guest speaker at a breakfast of the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters 
Assn., Ted outlined his objection to player agent Jerry Kapstein. Then he 
added: "You should have some reason to dislike a guy besides the fact he wears 
a full-length fur coat and is a Jew." 
</P>

Mind you, here was a baseball owner, a basketball owner, a guy licensed by the 
government to televise. 
</P>
<P>
He would apologize, gain forgiveness and grow from that point to the corporate 
giant he is today. 
</P>
<P>
So, reflecting on the Rose case, you want to discourage finger-wagging. Too 
many who wag are vulnerable.

REPORT FAVORS CANYON JAIL BUT O.C. CAN'T AFFORD ANY 
</P>

Orange County cannot afford to build and operate an often-touted new jail in 
the Riverside desert, and instead should concentrate on developing a 
controversial site near Anaheim, county planners conclude in a draft report 
obtained Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The report acknowledges, however, that even that proposal -- to build in Gypsum 
Canyon -- comes with a huge and unresolved problem: The county has no way to 
pay for that facility either. 
</P>
<P>
Those findings -- assembled by the county administrative office and subject to 
review by the Board of Supervisors -- offer little hope of soon solving the 
county's mounting jail-overcrowding crisis. More than 4,400 prisoners already 
are jammed into jails designed to hold 3,203, and thousands are being let go 
early every year to make room for more serious criminals. 
</P>
<P>
With the board long deadlocked over the Gypsum Canyon proposal, Supervisor Don 
R. Roth has been the primary advocate of building a desert jail in Riverside 
County, which he hoped would be a cheaper way of moving forward. Roth has also 
argued that building the jail in a remote desert location might make it more 
acceptable to residents who don't want it in their community. 
</P>
<P>
However, the 54-page draft report, which was circulated to board members late 
Tuesday, is likely to deal that proposal a severe, perhaps fatal, blow. For 
while the report notes that such a jail "is a feasible alternative available to 
the Board of Supervisors in order to acquire needed jail beds," it goes on to 
conclude that the facility actually would cost more to build and operate over a 
30-year period than a jail in Gypsum Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The total cost of building and operating Gypsum Canyon for 30 years would be 
$1.05 billion, according to the report. A 2,000-bed desert jail at Chiriaco 
Summit in Riverside is estimated to cost $1.77 billion to build and operate, 
and a 4,000-bed desert jail is predicted to run $2.02 billion over the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line that transcends any site, any location, is that it's going to 
be expensive," said Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, whose district includes the 
Gypsum Canyon site. "That's the common thread." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez, whose has long opposed the Gypsum Canyon plan, said he had not had a 
chance to read the draft in detail and declined to comment on its specific 
options and recommendations, as did other supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"Don (Roth) will not comment to anybody on this today," said Dan Wooldridge, an 
aide to the board chairman. "He's taking the report home with him, and he'll 
study it there." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to recommending that the supervisors reaffirm Gypsum Canyon as 
their preferred location for a new county jail, the report recommends that 
they: 
</P>
<P>
* Direct a team of county officials to "re-scope" the Gypsum Canyon project 
design to make it more affordable; 
</P>
<P>
* Direct the county administrative officer and other officials to search for 
revenue sources for building in Gypsum Canyon; 
</P>
<P>
* Direct the CAO to report back to the board within a year on the progress 
toward scaling back the project and finding ways to pay for it; 
</P>
<P>
* Direct the CAO and other agencies to develop a comprehensive program of 
"Alternatives to Incarceration," including intensive probation, home 
confinement and electronic monitoring of convicted criminals. 
</P>
<P>
It is the recommendations regarding the desert jail that are sure to create the 
biggest stir among supervisors, however. The board has wrestled with the issue 
of building a new jail for more than a decade, and has made only halting 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
Three board members voted for Gypsum Canyon in 1987, but it takes four votes to 
acquire the land through condemnation, and both Roth and Vasquez have remained 
adamantly opposed. Roth had hoped the desert jail might break the deadlock, but 
the report makes it clear that such a course is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the desert jail would trigger some indirect expenses that 
inflate its overall price tag. Building a regional jail in the desert would 
force the county to keep open the James A. Musick Branch Jail, for instance, in 
order to house inmates who are awaiting trial. A desert jail also could not 
accommodate pretrial inmates because it would be more than 100 miles from the 
courthouse in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Gypsum Canyon is much closer, and could be used to house pretrial inmates as 
well as those who have been sentenced. Building a jail in Gypsum Canyon would 
give the county enough new beds to close the Musick facility near El Toro and 
sell the land there. 
</P>
<P>
Still, while Roth's desert jail proposal is the most obvious victim of the 
draft report's findings, Gypsum Canyon suffers from significant drawbacks as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"While the Gypsum Canyon Jail is a financially more desirable alternative over 
the long term, Orange County currently does not have the financial resources 
needed for the initial capital expense, the ongoing level of expenditures, and 
a debt service payment schedule required with any of the scenarios presented in 
this report," county planners wrote. "Previous construction has been with the 
aid of state jail construction bond funds, which are not currently available." 
</P>
<P>
The county faces deep budget shortfalls already, and some officials are worried 
that an upcoming mid-year budget report could force serious cutbacks in 
programs or even layoffs of some employees. 
</P>
<P>
But budget problems notwithstanding, the jail study echoes what many officials 
have been saying in recent weeks: Orange County's jail overcrowding problem has 
reached a critical point, and the supervisors cannot simply push the issue 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
"Additional beds are critically needed in Orange County," the report concludes. 
"Existing overcrowded conditions, combined with projected inmate population 
increases, make the acquisition of additional (beds) a significant priority 
that cannot be ignored." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the problem needs quick attention if the county hopes to deal with 
overcrowding before the turn of the century: 
</P>
<P>
"Given the time frames involved in construction of jails, new jail construction 
will need to begin in the very near future in order to meet Orange County's bed 
needs by the year 2006," the report said. "Even under the best of scenarios, it 
will take until the year 1998 to construct all 5,946 beds (needed to meet the 
project shortage), assuming that board approval is obtained in January, 1991." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors and their staffs are reviewing the findings of the draft report and 
will send comments back to the county administrative office during the next 
several days. The board is expected to receive the report formally at its Dec. 
18 meeting, and it could act on the recommendations at that time.

HEADING BACK: Three minutes after election of Britain's new prime minister 
(A1), Sir Eldon Griffiths (above) was phoning Orange County, saying he'll be 
back here by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Griffiths, a Conservative member of Parliament from Suffolk and president of 
Orange County's World Affairs Council, was recalled to London to vote for prime 
minister. . . . The result seems "very brutal, but it is very efficient. In two 
weeks, we changed from a longstanding prime minister who was getting into 
trouble to a man who has the support of the entire party. If you have a 
President who falls out of favor, you're stuck with him." Jerry Hicks and

DANA PARSONS: GUNS WON'T WIN THE WAR AGAINST CRIME

<TEXT>
<P>
How many times have you lain in bed at night and heard a sound somewhere in the 
house? 
</P>
<P>
 Is that just the wind? Did I lock the sliding door? Is it my imagination? 
</P>
<P>
Then, for a few fleeting moments you think, What if someone's in the house? 
</P>
<P>
You put that irrational thought out of your mind, because that's never it. But 
you also realize that if this is that 1-in-10,000 chance that somebody is in 
the house, you could be a dead duck. 
</P>
<P>
And you wonder again about getting a gun. And then you wonder if you could use 
it. 
</P>
<P>
An increasingly unsafe society thrusts these kinds of decisions upon us, 
forcing us to choose between our abstract theories and real-life applications. 
In theory, you don't believe in having guns in the house, but you don't exactly 
believe in surrendering your fate to some punk who breaks into your house, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
So, you continue to play the odds and not get a gun, all the while knowing that 
it only takes one time in the Punk Sweepstakes to come up a big loser. 
</P>
<P>
Earl Swoap's number came up on Thanksgiving night, but he didn't lose. He and 
his wife were retiring for the night when someone literally kicked the back 
door of their Anaheim home off its hinges. 
</P>
<P>
Swoap grabbed his shotgun and, according to police, confronted four armed 
youths in a hallway. He fired three blasts at them. They scrambled out the back 
door and into their car, with Swoap in pursuit. As they fled in their car, 
which they had parked in Swoap's driveway, he fired at least three more times. 
Swoap killed one teen-ager and wounded two others. 
</P>
<P>
In some quarters, Swoap is something of a hero. 
</P>
<P>
A self-styled law-and-order group in Anaheim known as the Citizens Anti-Crime 
Taskforce (Citizens ACT) has sent Swoap a letter of congratulations for "the 
courage and initiative you demonstrated during that critically dangerous period 
when you decided to confront the armed intruders. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
They said they'd also like to give him a commendation at a future press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
The group said Swoap's actions "help serve notice on criminals as to what they 
might expect under such circumstances. It also serves as a reminder in this age 
of escalating criminal violence that citizens must be prepared to act in our 
own defense under such circumstances, until such time that government is able 
to adequately perform its most important function -- to protect and secure the 
population." 
</P>
<P>
Under California law, Swoap was entitled to use deadly force to protect himself 
and his wife as soon as the armed intruders smashed their way into his house. 
Although the law doesn't prescribe the death penalty for either burglary or 
robbery, it does allow a homeowner to use deadly force if he has reason to 
believe he's in danger. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office said Tuesday that, barring some new information, 
it isn't planning to file any charges against Swoap. This case cuts too close 
to the bone of the average citizen for the D.A. to file charges against Swoap. 
Indeed, frontier justice is what Swoap exacted, and it will sit well with the 
public at large. 
</P>
<P>
It's just that I don't feel like raising a toast to Earl Swoap, and it has 
nothing to do with second-guessing him on what he did. Inside his home, with 
his and his wife's protection at stake, he did what he had to do. What he did 
outside -- by continuing to fire at them even as they, theoretically, were 
removing the threat to him -- is an iffier proposition. 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time, "scaring them off" was considered an adequate means of 
self-defense. Nowadays, that isn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
It might make nice radio talk show conversation to talk about an armed 
citizenry, doing to criminals what the police and courts can't do, but arming 
the general populace is a scarier proposition to me than sporadic street crime. 
</P>
<P>
What about the next homeowner, this time confronted by youths who aren't armed? 
Do you want him running out into the night, firing a shotgun at the getaway 
car? Do you want your next-door neighbor making decisions on when to shoot, 
when not to shoot? 
</P>
<P>
Does it represent some victory for society because John Q. Public put a notch 
in his gun? 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
Will it slow down the punk parade? 
</P>
<P>
Fat chance. 
</P>
<P>
And that's what troubles me -- the notion that what happened in Earl Swoap's 
home represents some kind of meaningful victory for Us against Them. If we 
think that way, we're bound to start thinking that if only more of us did what 
Earl Swoap did, we'd win the battle. 
</P>
<P>
And if the war on crime comes down to shoot-outs between criminals and the guy 
next door, we're all gonna lose in the long run.

TEACHER IS CHARGED WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE DANA HILLS SCIENCE INSTRUCTOR IS ACCUSED OF MOLESTING A 17-YEAR-OLD 
FEMALE STUDENT DURING A FIELD TRIP IN OCTOBER. 
</P>

<P>
A Dana Hills High School teacher has been charged with sexually assaulting a 
17-year-old female student during a science field trip in Inyo County, 
authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Michael W. Gaskins, 43, has been charged with one felony count of sexual 
battery and one misdemeanor count of annoying a child under 18, according to a 
criminal complaint filed Nov. 16 in Inyo County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Gaskins has been suspended with pay since Oct. 25, when the Inyo County 
district attorney's office notified Capistrano Unified School District 
authorities that it was investigating a report of a sexual assault involving 
Gaskins and a Dana Hills student. 
</P>
<P>
The incident is alleged to have taken place on Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I can say . . . . I'm kind of blown away," Gaskins said 
after learning from a reporter that charges had been filed in the case. "It's 
been a tough time since this alleged incident." 
</P>
<P>
"There was a real misunderstanding, (but) obviously the person making the 
complaint doesn't feel that way," said Gaskins, who said he has been a science 
teacher with the district for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
Gaskins said that he has been involved in more than a hundred field trips 
during his career and that he has never before been accused of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"In the U.S.A., a person is innocent until proven guilty," he said, declining 
to discuss the case against him further. 
</P>
<P>
The assault is alleged to have occurred during the 18th annual Earth Science 
Field Study at Serales Lake in Last Chance Canyon in Inyo County, school 
authorities said. The purpose of the five-day geology outing is to give 
students an opportunity to study rocks and land formations. 
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint, Gaskins "did willfully and unlawfully touch an 
intimate part" of the victim while she was "unlawfully restrained by the 
defendant" for the "purpose of arousal, gratification and abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Inyo County Deputy Dist. Atty. Elizabeth Corpora declined to elaborate on the 
case or disclose any other details of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the felony charge, Gaskins could serve up to four years in 
state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Unified Supt. Jerome Thornsley declined to discuss Gaskins' 
suspension, saying that it is a personnel matter. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills High School Principal John E. Smart, who also declined to discuss 
the case, said Gaskins has been a "very active member of the science 
department. . . . He did a very good job as a teacher and seemed to be 
well-liked among the students." 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Cerra, spokeswoman for the school district, said the district "began 
to prepare material to take to the (school) board at its next closed-door 
session on Dec. 3, at which time they will determine what kind of future action 
will be taken." 
</P>
<P>
Cerra said the state education code "is quite clear on what a school district 
is supposed to do" in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
It might be that, under certain sections of the code, the board could adopt "a 
mandatory leave without pay for the employee pending legal resolution of the 
matter," Cerra said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the charges are dropped or changed, it does not preclude the board from 
continuing to pursue the matter administratively," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Gaskins is scheduled to be arraigned Dec. 17 in Inyo County.

SUPERVISORS REJECT PLAN FOR MORE MEDFLY TRAPPING SITES; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: STATE PROPOSAL MIGHT HAVE RESULTED IN MORE MALATHION SPRAYING, 
THEY FEAR.

Afraid to do anything that could trigger new rounds of aerial malathion 
spraying, county supervisors ignored the advice of scientists Tuesday and 
rejected a state plan to double the number of Medfly trapping locations in 
parts of the county. 
</P>
<P>
State officials had argued that they could more quickly detect Mediterranean 
fruit fly infestations by rotating existing traps more often and splitting up 
pairs of traps to double the number of locations with at least one. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisors Roger R. Stanton and Harriett M. Wieder, whose North County 
districts were most heavily hit by malathion spraying last winter and spring, 
complained that the proposal would have made a test case of Orange County and 
might have subjected residents here to more rounds of spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see a logic to increasing the probability . . . of finding a new fly 
out there," said Stanton, who led the move to reject the proposal. "I really 
have found no cogent reason at all to support this program." 
</P>
<P>
In response, state Medfly experts accused the supervisors of playing politics 
with the problem and said the action could actually worsen the chances of 
heading off a major infestation. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds to me like a bury-your-head-in-the-sand approach," said James Carey, 
an associate professor of entomology at UC Davis and a member of the state's 
Medfly advisory panel. "The whole point of trapping is to find the fly 
population so that you can surgically remove them. . . . You can use a rifle 
instead of a shotgun." 
</P>
<P>
Because the proposal would have amended an existing county contract, four 
supervisors would have had to favor it. But only three did, with Stanton and 
Wieder opposed. As a result of the board action, the number of trapping 
locations in Orange County will be reduced as planned at the end of this month. 
There are currently about 6,000 traps in Orange County, about 4,500 of which 
are overseen by the state, Agricultural Commissioner James D. Harnett said. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of those will be taken out by the state within the next few 
weeks, he added, now that the Medfly infestation that hit the county earlier 
this year appears to have passed. 
</P>
<P>
Harnett would not criticize the board for its vote but said he brought the 
proposal to the supervisors because "we thought from a professional standpoint 
that it might be a good idea to do this." 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, what was presented was not comfortable to them at this time. It 
seemed to me that there were other things afoot than just the logic of the 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
Gera Curry, information officer for the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture, was more outspoken. "I'm stunned," said Curry, who accused Wieder 
and Stanton of putting politics ahead of science in the Medfly battle. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that it's unfortunate that some members of the board politicized this 
issue," Curry said. "I can't argue with the premise that if you don't look, you 
don't find, but early detection is what can prevent a wider spray area. It's an 
early warning system." 
</P>
<P>
Some of those concerns were raised during the board meeting, as Supervisor 
Thomas F. Riley voiced his support for the trapping proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Preparedness is a better way to be than to be surprised," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder questioned Harnett closely about the proposal, asking the commissioner 
whether other counties were participating in the program and questioning 
whether Orange County is already living up to its contract with the state on 
placing traps. 
</P>
<P>
Harnett acknowledged that the county is abiding by that contract and said the 
state's proposal would mark the first time that a county split its traps or 
rotated them more often. Orange County was picked, Harnett said, because it is 
an urban county squarely within the hazard zone for Medfly infestation. 
</P>
<P>
If the pilot program succeeded in capturing more Medflies, Harnett said, the 
new method of trapping would be extended to other areas as well. 
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of their exchange, however, Wieder said she was not satisfied 
that the county should agree to the proposal. "Your answers haven't convinced 
me," she told Harnett. "Why are we being such heroes?"

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: $50,000 GRANT OKD FOR HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA MICHAELIS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council paved the way for construction of a low-income housing complex 
this week by voting to spend nearly $50,000 in federal grants for a West 
Newport project. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-unit complex of four studios and 10 two-bedroom units was approved for 
the corner of 15th Street and Placentia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to house about 24 people. 
</P>
<P>
The complex is the sixth low-income housing project to be built in the city by 
Mesa Development Co., a Costa Mesa company that specializes in building such 
complexes. The project will be the first in the city to offer studio apartments 
for low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
The 400-square-foot studios are expected to rent for about $350 a month, City 
Planner Craig Bluell said. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify as low-income by federal standards, one must earn less than $17,200 
a year, according to Bluell. The figure is higher for households of more than 
one person. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of Mayor Phil Sansone, the City Council also voted to specify 
that city employees will be given priority when prospective renters are 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ruthelyn Plummer supported the project and suggested that the city 
and contractor work with the nearby Interfaith Housing Network to publicize the 
project among families or individuals living in shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Mesa Development had sought $200,000 in funding to begin the project, and the 
city's $50,000 grant gave the company enough money to proceed. Developers of 
the 28th Street Marina project, a luxury condominium development being built in 
the Cannery Village area, have promised to contribute $147,000 to the 
low-income housing complex. 
</P>
<P>
That contribution is part of the developers' agreement to build four low-income 
apartments in the city in return for council approval of the marina project.

2 COUNCILMEN WAGE FIGHT FOR MAYOR'S JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fierce behind-the-scenes political struggle is under way for selection as the 
city's next mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Each year council members choose one of their colleagues to serve in the post. 
Sometimes the seven council members attempt to rotate the job. But outside 
political pressure from pro-growth and slow-growth forces frequently play a 
role in the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Thomas J. Mays completes his one-year term Dec. 3, and the council will 
elect his successor that night. 
</P>
<P>
There are two candidates for mayor this year: Councilmen Jim Silva and Peter M. 
Green. Each acknowledges lacking the four votes needed to win. "It's wide 
open," Silva said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Green, 63, is a biological sciences professor at Golden West College and has 
been on the council since 1984. He is mayor pro tem, filling in for the mayor 
as needed. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor pro tem often becomes the mayor the next year, but no rule requires 
it. The City Council on Jan. 22 adopted a motion, 4 to 3, to have the mayor pro 
tem automatically become the next mayor each year. But on Feb. 5, the council 
rescinded the action, also by a 4-3 vote. Silva's was the swing vote; he first 
voted for the automatic succession, then against it. 
</P>
<P>
Silva, 46, is an economics teacher at Los Amigos High School in Fountain Valley 
and also a real estate broker. He has been on the council since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Green, Councilwoman Grace Winchell and Councilwoman-elect Linda 
Moulton-Patterson are supported by environmental groups, and the three have 
taken stands against some controversial development projects, Pierside Village 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
Green, however, noted Monday that his vote is never totally predictable. Just 
last month, for instance, he voted for the mammoth Holly-Seacliff development 
agreement even though Winchell opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
Silva usually supports development proposals before the council, and he has 
said he is a strong advocate of continuing downtown redevelopment on Main 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
"A primary goal for me is getting downtown Phase II on line," Silva said. 
Silva's vote is another that cannot be totally predicted. For instance, he and 
Mays joined Winchell and Green earlier this month in killing a high-density 
condominium project vehemently opposed by residents of the Talbert Avenue-Beach 
Boulevard area. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the council members could not be reached for comment on their choices 
for mayor. Councilman-elect Earle Robitaille said Tuesday that he has "made up 
my mind who I'm voting for mayor, but I won't disclose it until that night."

STUDENT PROTESTERS SPARK OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
About 75 teen-age protesters and counterdemonstrators gathered outside Dana 
Hills High School Tuesday for a lunchtime demonstration over the buildup of 
U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 students lined the street outside the school and displayed placards 
reading, "Give Peace a Chance" and "Another Vietnam?" to passing drivers. A few 
supporters honked their horns. 
</P>
<P>
For a few moments, the student protesters wandered out into the street to 
demonstrate, but sheriff's deputies asked them to return to the sidewalk. No 
arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street, a group of student counterdemonstrators, some wearing 
military fatigues, waved American flags and argued with the small but vocal 
contingent of protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not sitting here praying for war, (but) I just want them to respect what 
we're doing there," said counterdemonstrator Andy Connolly, 17, who was dressed 
in khaki fatigues and waved a large American flag. "I'm hoping to avoid any 
forceful action." 
</P>
<P>
"I object (to the protest)," added Dan Danforth, 18, a senior who was also 
holding an American flag. "They should support (Operation) Desert Shield 
because it's the right thing to do. We're protecting our economic stability in 
the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
Protester Steve Janssen, 17, a senior, said he was demonstrating because he 
does not believe protecting economic stability is sufficient cause for military 
action. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't fight for that; I wouldn't fight for oil," Janssen said. "I 
wouldn't lay down my life for it, and I don't think anyone else should lose 
their life over it, either." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Balderman, 16, a junior who organized the protest, said he asked students 
to participate because "killing people is wrong for any reason." 
</P>
<P>
Balderman and his fellow protesters complied with school officials when they 
were asked to return to classes at the end of the lunch period. School 
Principal John E. Smart said he thought the protest was "more of a social 
activity than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think half of them know where Kuwait is," he said. " . . . I think 
some of them have genuine convictions, and I think others are out here having a 
good time." TONY MARCANO

<P>
BOARD GETS VIEWS ON SUPERINTENDENT

The Capistrano Unified School District's next superintendent should be an 
academic with strong communication skills, according to residents who addressed 
the Board of Education this week. 
</P>
<P>
"In selecting candidates you should consider academic leaders and not just 
business managers -- a Ph.D. in English or languages, perhaps," the board was 
told by Marilyn Sullivan of the local chapter of the American Assn. of 
University Women. 
</P>
<P>
"Interpersonal relationships are most important. We suggest someone who can 
bring honor and respect for the administration among teachers and the support 
staff." 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen residents attended a hearing Monday at which the board sought public 
comment on qualities that should be possessed by the successor to Jerome 
Thornsley, who is retiring June 30 after 16 years as superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
The board, however, wavered on its announced goal of hiring a replacement by 
Jan. 25. Because of delays in advertising the position in education magazines 
and newspapers, board member E.G. (Ted) Kopp said, the board would have to rush 
to meet that deadline. He suggested moving the date to Feb. 25, but the board 
delayed a decision. 
</P>
<P>
The board did decide to hold similar public hearings at 7 p.m. Monday and 6:30 
p.m. Dec. 17, before its regularly scheduled meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The board also invited residents to call Ira Krinsky, the consultant who is 
conducting the district's search for candidates, at (818) 568-3311 to express 
their views or to write to Krinsky in care of the district. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's meeting, Nancy Fee, president of the Capistrano Bay chapter of the 
League of Women Voters, agreed with Sullivan, adding that the new 
superintendent should be able to relate to the growing minority community. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the same district (as) 10 years ago," she said. TERRY SPENCER

CARS FOR SALE CAN'T BE LEFT AT MALL, CITY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to keep parking lots from becoming used car lots on the weekends, 
the City Council has adopted an ordinance prohibiting vehicles that are for 
sale from being left on private property. 
</P>
<P>
"The ordinance is geared to cars for sale that are parked in shopping centers," 
said Ray Kromer, assistant city manager. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big problem when there's 30 to 40 vehicles being left on the weekends, 
making it look like a used car lot." 
</P>
<P>
The police have been unable to get rid of the cars because until now, the 
municipal code did not prohibit the practice. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance applies to vehicles parked without the property owner's 
permission. Violators may be fined up to $1,000 and receive up to six months in 
jail.

LAGUNA HILLS HIGH CLIMBS BACK ON TOP IN DECATHLON

<P>
Laguna Hills High School, a perennial winner in county, state and national 
Academic Decathlon competitions, was the top school again this year in the 
Orange County Academic Decathlon for 11th- and 12th-graders. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills, proclaimed the county champion at an awards banquet Tuesday night 
at the Anaheim Marriott, won the title with a combined score of 44,492, besting 
its nearest competitor -- Sunny Hills High School of Fullerton -- by nearly 
2,000 points. The competition was held Nov. 17 at El Dorado High School in 
Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Hills team, which won the state championship last year and went on 
to capture second place in the national Academic Decathlon in Des Moines, Iowa, 
in April, took the county championship despite falling 500 points short of 
Sunny Hills in the Super Quiz, the event's final test and often the deciding 
factor in academic decathlons. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills will represent Orange County and attempt to defend its state 
championship at the California Academic Decathlon next March in Riverside. The 
national finals will be held in April at Occidental College in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Following Laguna Hills and Sunny Hills in overall scores were University High 
School of Irvine, with 41,714 points; Esperanza High, Anaheim, 41,037; Los 
Alamitos High, 40,232; Mission Viejo High, 40,145; Trabuco Hills High, Mission 
Viejo, 39,871; Dana Hills High, Dana Point, 37,940; Troy High, Fullerton, 
37,622; and Irvine High, 37,431. 
</P>
<P>
Among individual winners, Winston Chang of University High School scored the 
highest point total in the honors division with 8,467 points, including a 
perfect 1,000 on the essay portion of the test. Todd Faurot, a member of the 
national runner-up Laguna Hills team last year, scored the highest in the 
scholastic division with 7,428 points, and Kirk Brown, a newcomer to the Laguna 
Hills team, topped the varsity division with a score of 6,885. 
</P>
<P>
The Decathlon, created 20 years ago by outgoing county Supt. of Schools Robert 
Peterson, tests students in economics, essay-writing, fine arts, interview 
skills, literature, mathematics, science, social science and speech, and is 
capped by the Super Quiz, a "Jeopardy!"-style quiz segment. Forty-eight high 
school teams took part this year.

A house sustained extensive damage to its roof Tuesday after sparks from the 
fireplace flew up the chimney and started the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Damage was estimated at $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were called to the San Andres Street home after a neighbor alerted 
the home's owner, Joseph Newberry, that his roof was on fire. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks hit the shingle roofs of two other homes, but no serious damage was 
reported.

CITY SUES EX-PLANNER ON CONFLICT ALLEGATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: ORANGE CITY COUNCIL SEEKS TO RECOVER MORE THAN $100,000 FROM FORMER 
COMMISSIONER DON GREEK AND HIS ENGINEERING COMPANIES. HE IS SUING TOO.

<P>
The City Council has filed a conflict-of-interest lawsuit against former 
Planning Commissioner Don Greek, seeking to recover at least $104,000 paid to 
his engineering firms while he was a public official. 
</P>
<P>
Greek used his position to influence other members of the Planning Commission, 
Planning Department, city staff and City Council members "for the purpose of 
benefiting his own personal and financial interests," according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The city filed the suit last week in Orange County Superior Court, five weeks 
after voting unanimously to seek repayment of money paid to DGA Consultants 
Inc. and Don Greek and Associates. Greek had been warned in writing by 
Assistant City Atty. Gene Minshew that the contracts could be a conflict of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't have any comment except that (the city is) following through 
with the procedure and we will be vindicated in the end," Greek said Tuesday. 
"I am optimistic that we will prevail." 
</P>
<P>
Greek has filed a $20-million claim against the city, paving the way for a 
defamation lawsuit. Greek was a planning commissioner from 1983 until his 
resignation in August to run for City Council. He lost in the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Council members voted unanimously to sue after the district attorney's office 
disclosed that it was investigating conflict of interest allegations against 
Greek. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line here is that as elected representatives of the people, we have 
a reputation to take a stand in regard to ethical behavior and potential 
conflict of interest," Councilman William G. Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office is trying to determine if Greek has violated 
State Government Code 1090, a felony punishable by a fine of $1,000 and up to 
three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The code states that state, county and city employees and officers "shall not 
be financially interested in any contract made by them in their official 
capacity or by any body or board of which they are members. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Since the contracts date back to 1986, the statute of limitations could have an 
effect. The statute for criminal prosecution of a conflict of interest 
violation is within "three years of discovery of the offense or within three 
years of when it reasonably should have been discovered," Deputy Dist. Atty. 
John Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
The city will argue that the statute of limitations should cover at least four 
years, which would include the Sandpiper School contract, a $20,000 agreement 
awarded in 1986 just 12 days after Greek received a conflict-of-interest 
warning from Minshew, according to Leo B. Newton of the law firm of Corrado 
&amp; Newton, special counsel to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Conley said he is also investigating whether Greek may have violated 
conflict-of-interest provisions of the Political Reform Act, an misdemeanor 
offense. Conley noted that his investigation is still weeks from completion 
because he is seeking additional city documents, including minutes from 
Planning Commission meetings. 
</P>
<P>
According to the city's lawsuit, Greek was acting in his official capacity as a 
planning commissioner when the city awarded his firms seven contracts ranging 
from about $1,400 to $58,000. 
</P>
<P>
Among the contracts outlined in the suit is one in which the city claims that 
Don Greek and Associates appears to have solicited city staff members to win a 
project. In a 1987 letter to city recreation superintendent Richard Kollen, 
firm partner John Cuervo proposed a $23,500 plan to provide preliminary 
engineering and design work for the relocation of a building.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
CHARITY WITH AN INDIVIDUALISTIC TWIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County doesn't give as generously to United Way as some other areas. 
Some say it's because there aren't many corporate headquarters that conduct 
companywide giving programs. Others say it's because the county's neediest 
people are not as visible as in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, United Way of Orange County is trying a new plan that's 
been tried in just a few places around the nation. And United Ways in both Los 
Angeles and San Diego are studying the idea to see if it would provide adequate 
support to all their beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
The program, called "donor choice," allows contributors to designate their 
gifts in three ways: 
</P>
<P>
* The traditional method, in which funds are distributed among 21 areas of need 
serviced by Orange County's 118 United Way-affiliated service providers. 
</P>
<P>
* "Targeted issue" care, in which donors designate an area of particular 
concern, such as homelessness, disaster services, hunger or literacy. 
</P>
<P>
* "Specific care," in which donors designate contributions to specific agencies 
affiliated with United Way or to any eligible nonprofit organization in the 
United States. These gifts will be monitored to make sure they are used as 
intended. 
</P>
<P>
United Way executives in Orange County say they devised the new plan after 
hearing from donors that they wanted more control over which charities received 
their gifts and how the money was used. They hope that the program will help in 
their pursuit of $22.5 million this year -- a 9% increase over the $20.9 
million pledged a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
While many United Ways allow donors to designate their donations, usually the 
money becomes part of the designated agency's overall allocation and doesn't 
change the total it receives. What makes Orange County's program different is 
that designated donations will be added to an agency's allocation for a given 
year. The program also allows donors to designate their money to nonprofit 
agencies outside United Way's traditional "family." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles and San Diego are concerned that some good causes that are not as 
popular or that don't have means of promoting themselves might suffer. That's a 
good point that should be evaluated as Orange County's program gets under way. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County experiment does respond to a feeling throughout the business 
community that people nowadays want more autonomy in decision-making. Thus, the 
creation of a stronger link between giver and receiver should foster 
generosity.

MIKE PENNER: FEAR HAS SETTLED IN ON 49ERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Suddenly, something new fills the air above Nob Hill and Fisherman's Wharf. 
Suddenly, fog is out and doubt is in, the mighty 49er dynasty cast adrift like 
the runaway Fuji blimp that threatened to turn Ram Sunday into Black Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"When we lose one, it's like a death in the family," says San Francisco tight 
end Jamie Williams. "We kinda take it hard." 
</P>
<P>
So does the city. On most days, it prefers its proper designation, The City, 
but during this week of civic mourning, in lieu of black arm bands, all letters 
are at half-mast. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been shaken and this time, not by Mother Nature. The city has seen 
the Falling of the Forty-Niners, for the first time in a full year, but worse 
than that, the team failed to go down nobly, as the local gentry would have 
imagined it. 
</P>
<P>
There was no Joe Montana gallantly firing away until time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
There was no Ronnie Lott lunging after his man in the end zone, gripping a 
pulled hamstring as the winning pass eluded him by inches. 
</P>
<P>
There was no comeback, no overtime, no one-point loss to an opponent deemed 
worthy of the feat, such as Sir Phil Simms and the esteemed New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
No, this loss was as ugly as the quagmire that passed for the field at 
Candlestick Park. This loss was about Captain Montana throwing three 
interceptions; about 49er ballcarriers fumbling three times; about Lott getting 
beat for a pivotal 53-yard completion; about the Red &amp; Gold defense 
surrendering a 95-yard scoring drive in the mud and the rain late in the fourth 
quarter -- a total system shut down in the clutch. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, this was a loss to the riffraff and the rabble, to the black sheep of 
the division, to the louts from down south -- the Rams, owners of a pregame 
record of 3-7 and the kind of defense Montana usually dunks into his morning 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Deep-fried and glazed, with a hole in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Against this defense, which would rank last in a league without the Detroit 
Lions, the 49ers committed six turnovers, converted three of 10 third-down 
attempts, scored two touchdowns and were held to 291 yards -- nearly 90 shy of 
their weekly average. 
</P>
<P>
Not quite sure how to react -- the Niners hadn't lost since Nov. 19, 1989 -- 
the city has overreacted. Sunday morning, it was God, country and 49er 
football. By Monday morning, it was Faith No More. 
</P>
<P>
Some postgame headlines: 
</P>
<P>
 Why Can't They Run? 
</P>
<P>
 49ers' Ground Game Worries Seifert 
</P>
<P>
 Secondary Isn't Too Impressive, Either 
</P>
<P>
The sure sign of panic in San Francisco: When they start second-guessing 
Montana. Tuesday, one newspaper printed its weekly 49er report card and graded 
Montana out at D-, wondering why St. Joe didn't scramble when "he could have 
run for a two-yard TD in the third quarter but (instead) threw incomplete and 
the 49ers didn't score." 
</P>
<P>
Next, an appointment awaits with the team they call the Giants, which, this 
year, is both a nickname and a description. It will be 10-1 vs. 10-1 in front 
of the Monday Night Football cameras. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers keep saying they aren't worried, but why do we keep hearing nervous 
talk? 
</P>
<P>
Offensive lineman Harris Barton says, forebodingly, "The Giants play better 
defense than the Rams, I can tell you that right now." 
</P>
<P>
Coach George Seifert labels the week ahead, the limbo between defeat and the 
Giant struggle, as "kind of a glum situation." He warns, too, of pressure. "You 
don't want to be the team that winds up with two losses in a row." 
</P>
<P>
The concern is justified. Say this for the Rams: They've finally found their 
purpose in life. They're not going to the playoffs and they're not going to get 
the No. 1 draft choice, but they have served as a valuable barometer in trying 
to gauge the weather next Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Rams 28, 49ers 17. 
</P>
<P>
Giants 31, Rams 7. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the clues as to what's in store -- and good clues they are. The 
Giants should beat the 49ers for the same reason the Rams split their games 
with the NFL's elite. It involves moving the football on the ground and only 
one of the teams involved can do it with power, consistency and precision. 
</P>
<P>
They might be Giants. 
</P>
<P>
New York's rushing offense has the big (Ottis Anderson) and the short (Dave 
Meggett) of it, plus a mid-sized rookie (Rodney Hampton) who's a threat inside 
and out. Against the Rams, three running backs scored for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
With San Francisco, the problem is Montana. The 49ers now depend so heavily on 
their quarterback that their running game is a victim of neglect. After 11 
games, San Francisco ranks dead-last in average gain per rushing attempt (3.3) 
and 24th in average rushing yards per game (88.6). Against the Rams, the 49ers 
netted 66 yards on the ground -- 44 in 13 carries by Roger Craig, with Montana 
outgaining his fullback, Tom Rathman, 15 yards to seven. 
</P>
<P>
Do the 49ers have enough ground force to overtake another Super Bowl? "I don't 
know," Seifert says. "I think it's a good question." It wasn't raised before 
because 10-0 teams tote few questions. "You win ballgames," Seifert says, "and 
you may have a tendency to overlook some things." 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, they're not overlooking anymore. In San Francisco, the 
two-time defending Super Bowl champion 49ers have lost to the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Once that happens, you begin to fear that anything is possible.

ESTANCIA NO. 1, BUT LOOK OUT FOR MATER DEI; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: MONARCH COACH INSISTS HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH WHEN HE SAYS MATER DEI 
IS REBUILDING, BUT OTHERS AREN'T BUYING IT. 
</P>

<P>
Gary McKnight has a confession to make. Over the past seven years, Mater Dei 
High School's basketball coach hasn't been truthful when evaluating teams 
before the season. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight has done his best to downgrade his teams' prospects, but results don't 
lie: Mater Dei has won six Southern Section championships and two state titles. 
</P>
<P>
"All those years, I lied," McKnight said. "This time, I'm telling the truth 
when I say this is a rebuilding year for us. This is the most inexperienced 
team I've ever had, with five sophomores and three juniors." 
</P>
<P>
But few are buying it. 
</P>
<P>
"McKnight's 12th man could start here right now," said Tim O'Brien, Estancia 
coach. "I know he's singing the blues, but when the season ends, he'll be on 
top." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, O'Brien is no George Washington himself. Even without Mater Dei's 
12th man, Estancia opens the 1990-91 season as the top-ranked team in The 
Times' preseason poll. Tustin is a close second, followed by Marina. But most 
coaches will keep a close watch on fourth-ranked Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
"Truthfully, I think Mater Dei is better than we are," said Tom McCluskey, 
Tustin coach. "We beat them by 10 points this summer, but I still remember 
playing against one of Gary's teams in the playoffs when I was at Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
"We had Sean Rooks (now at Arizona) at center, and I thought we had a good 
chance to beat them. We got dissected, losing by 32 points, and I learned to 
never underestimate their program again."

<P>
League: Pacific Coast 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Tim O'Brien 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the top eight players are returning, but more important, O'Brien is 
also back after an unsuccessful bid for the Christ College Irvine job last 
spring. The only missing ingredient is graduated guard Agustin Heredia, who 
scored 32 points in a 51-49 victory over Servite in the 3-AA title game. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so far ahead of the game with everybody back that it makes coaching a 
lot easier," O'Brien said. "This is a good group of high school players. I have 
16 seniors who have been with me for four years." 
</P>
<P>
Estancia's convincing run through the Newport-Mesa summer tournament -- it won 
every game by double figures -- had rival coaches wondering if anyone could 
beat the Eagles this season. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien will have the luxury of using 10 players with no significant drop-off 
in quality, and he plans to press opponents into mistakes. It's an outstanding 
senior class, but Estancia's top player should be junior forward Matt 
Fuerbringer. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I've seen a group together for four straight years," 
said O'Brien, whose Eagles move from the strong Sea View League to the weaker 
Pacific Coast. "I can see four or five players averaging 10 points a game. We 
have excellent balance." 
</P>
<P>
2 TUSTIN 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 20-8 
</P>
<P>
League: Sea View 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Tom McCluskey 
</P>
<P>
Four returning starters, including all-league selections David Beilstein, 
Thomas Clayton and Jentry Moore, lead the talented, experienced Tillers. 
Beilstein averaged 17.7 points and shot 67% as a junior and was a second-team, 
all-Division II selection. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the quickest and most experienced team I've had at Tustin," said 
McCluskey, the Tillers' fourth-year coach. "Our expectations are very high." 
</P>
<P>
Tustin had a 36-4 record over the summer, including victories over Marina (with 
Cherokee Parks) and Mater Dei (by 10). But McCluskey insists depth will be a 
problem because projected sixth man Rod Blake, a 6-4 forward, has moved to 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"We have five good starters, but after that, we're hurting," he said. "We've 
never been in a situation where we were ranked among the top five teams in the 
county, so it's going to be interesting to see how the players respond. I'm 
sure if you asked them now, they'd tell you they're the No. 1 team in the 
county. I'd rather wait until we play a few games." 
</P>
<P>
MARINA 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 18-9 
</P>
<P>
League: Sunset 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Steve Popovich 
</P>
<P>
The mere presence of All-American center Cherokee Parks makes Marina a tall 
order for any opponent, but questions about mental toughness keep the Vikings 
from being ranked No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Marina was inconsistent last season, struggling to an 8-7 nonleague record, 
excelling to a 9-1 Sunset League record and title, then showing little heart 
while losing to Cajon, 67-61, in the second round of the 5-A division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
There are also questions about Parks' supporting cast. Forward Brant Shelor and 
guard Sean Haselrig are proven performers, but the lack of a true point guard 
could hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I like our inside game," Popovich said. "I also like our 
versatility. I can go with a big lineup or a smaller lineup if we're playing a 
real quick team." 
</P>
<P>
The return of forward Dennis Winners, who played volleyball as a junior, gives 
Popovich added board strength. "Our league is going to be every bit as tough as 
last year, so we needed another physical player who can pound inside," Popovich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
MATER DEI 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 34-1 
</P>
<P>
League: Angelus 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Gary McKnight 
</P>
<P>
A rebuilding year at Mater Dei? Hard to believe, but that's what McKnight has 
after losing most of a senior-oriented team that won the state Division I title 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are forwards Andy Karich (Santa Clara) and David Boyle (Holy Cross), 
center Derek Stone (Boise State), guards Jason Quinn (Southern California 
College) and Danny O'Neil (Oregon) and sixth man Paul Nolan (Redlands). 
</P>
<P>
The new kids on the block are sophomores DeJuan Matthews and Kamran Sufi, 
junior Reggie Geary and seniors J.J. Ballesteros, Jason Janeski and Mark 
Moneypenny. Moneypenny and Geary played in the waning moments of lopsided 
victories last season. 
</P>
<P>
Moneypenny, a 6-11 string bean of a center, has drawn interest from several 
Division I colleges. Geary is the team's best all-around athlete. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight, who brings a 227-19 record into his ninth season, is predicting early 
losses and has picked Santa Margarita to win the Angelus League title. Here's 
another prediction: Mater Dei will be the county's top-ranked team at the end 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
OCEAN VIEW 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 16-11 
</P>
<P>
League: Sunset 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jim Harris 
</P>
<P>
The prospects of a solid inside game with returning center Marcel TenBerge and 
an outstanding outside game with sharpshooting guard Ryan Martin should be 
enough for Ocean View to challenge Marina and Edison for the league title. 
</P>
<P>
TenBerge, who signed with Colorado State, broke his finger on Jan. 3 against 
Long Beach Poly and was never 100% afterward. "He's a relentless rebounder and 
has a nice touch inside, so we're expecting big things from Marcel," Harris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In TenBerge's absence, Martin made 45 of 100 three-point attempts, and Jimmy 
Harris made 22 of 51 three-pointers. Harris, the coach's sophomore son, will 
play the point. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense needs to improve, but we have three very good players, and our 
depth will be improved over the past couple of years," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
CAPISTRANO VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 18-9 
</P>
<P>
League: South Coast 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Mark Thornton 
</P>
<P>
A team concept returns to Capistrano Valley after the graduation of forward 
Scott McCorkle and guard Chris Kostoff, the top duo in the county last year. 
McCorkle averaged 24.4 points and Kostoff 20.1 in an unbalanced attack. 
</P>
<P>
McCorkle and Kostoff were such dominating players that Thornton resorted to 
practices in which they were not allowed to shoot in an effort to build their 
teammates' confidence. McCorkle's younger brother, Brett, is the only returnee 
from last season. 
</P>
<P>
"This year's team will be well-balanced, and all the players have the green 
light to shoot, unlike last year's team," Thornton said. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton predicts junior guard Tom Airey will be among the county's top 
shooters, but the Cougars' future largely depends on the play of sophomore 
point guard David Sedgwick. 
</P>
<P>
EDISON 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 20-9 
</P>
<P>
League: Sunset 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jon Borchert 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Jessie, a 6-5 junior forward, will be overshadowed by Parks but should 
develop into one of the county's top players before he graduates. He averaged 
16.1 points as a sophomore and was named most valuable player in the Coast 
Christmas Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's sixth man, Todd Smyser, moves into the starting lineup and will be 
joined by Dave Deck in the backcourt. Deck was the second player off the bench 
for Borchert last year, and Borchert said both guards are fine perimeter 
shooters. 
</P>
<P>
"I have high hopes for Smyser and Deck," Borchert said. "Offensively, we should 
be very good. The main focus of our practices has been rebounding and defense." 
</P>
<P>
MISSION VIEJO 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 19-7 
</P>
<P>
League: South Coast 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bob Minier 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo figures to start slowly with five players participating in the 
football playoffs. Two returning players, guard Bill Denny and forward Mike 
Boucher, start at strong safety and wide receiver for the football team. 
</P>
<P>
Another football player, Rob Cullinan, will likely be the team's starting 
center. Cullinan is the team's tallest starter at 6-5, but Minier believes 
quickness will overcome size problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike Boucher has the ability to become one of the best players in the county," 
Minier said. "When he consistently plays both ends of the court and rebounds to 
the level of his potential, he's a tremendous player." 
</P>
<P>
ESPERANZA 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 16-11 
</P>
<P>
League: Empire 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Mark Hill 
</P>
<P>
The surprise team of the Empire last season, Esperanza should end Los Alamitos' 
reign as the best of a six-team league. 
</P>
<P>
Guards Joe Foss and Brett Evans and center Matt Thimgan, all starting their 
third varsity seasons, form the nucleus. 
</P>
<P>
Foss is one of the county's top players. He averaged 21.2 points and shot 56% 
from the field as a junior. He led Esperanza to a 30-5 summer record and was 
named most valuable player of the San Dimas and Ventura College tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Kordik, a 6-6 junior forward, also gives the Aztecs added rebounding 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 11-16 
</P>
<P>
League: South Coast 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Steve Keith 
</P>
<P>
Additional depth and the return of forward John Molle should help Irvine 
improve on last year's record. 
</P>
<P>
Molle signed with San Diego State in the fall. He averaged 20.9 points and 7.5 
rebounds and was the county's second-best free-throw shooter (89%). 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Brad Gramlich, who will be a co-captain with Molle, will team in 
the backcourt with Brian Boothroyd, who started as a sophomore last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Our team is more experienced and stronger than last year's," Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
Others to Watch: Canyon, Century, Foothill, Garden Grove, Los Alamitos, Santa 
Margarita, Servite, Sunny Hills and Western.

MICROPROCESSOR INVENTOR TARGET OF BROTHER'S SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: THE MAN CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE COMPUTER ON A CHIP AND A 
SIBLING, AN ENGINEER WHO FILED A "WHISTLE-BLOWER" SUIT AGAINST NORTHROP, ARE 
INVOLVED IN A FAMILY SQUABBLE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gilbert P. Hyatt, the La Palma inventor who last July won a 20-year legal 
battle to be recognized as the inventor of the computer on a chip, is now 
facing litigation from another front: his brother. 
</P>
<P>
Michael A. Hyatt, a 50-year-old Cerritos resident, is suing his older brother, 
Gilbert, for allegedly failing to turn over property that belongs to him. 
</P>
<P>
Like his brother, Michael Hyatt also has achieved some degree of fame. In 1986, 
the former engineer for Northrop Corp., also known as Brian Hyatt, filed a 
"whistle-blower" lawsuit against the Century City-based defense contractor for 
alleged contracting fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Hyatt said in an interview that his brother, Gilbert, has refused to 
turn over funds held in a family trust and various collectibles. Michael Hyatt 
said the delay is jeopardizing his own costly legal fight against Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Hyatt said that his brother's suit, which was filed Nov. 14 in Orange 
County Superior Court in Santa Ana, is unnecessary. He said he would turn over 
the trust fund once probate on his mother's estate closes. The probate has not 
closed, he said, because unrelated litigation involving the trust is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Hyatt also said he would return the property to his brother if he is 
willing to sign a release and receipt and pay for the cost of returning the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"He has his temper up and he tends to get stirred up about things," Gilbert 
Hyatt said. "He is out of work and is trying to find a way to get cash to 
support his activities. I can't distribute money until probate closes." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Hyatt said his brother has refused to surrender about $90,000 in a 
trust set up for the Hyatt children and one cousin after their mother died. 
Michael Hyatt also said that Gilbert has refused to allow him access to the 
collectibles that he asked his brother to store for safekeeping in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Though Gilbert Hyatt said his brother is jealous of his recent patent award for 
inventing the microprocessor, which could net him hefty royalty payments from 
computer-chip manufacturers, Michael Hyatt said his suit has nothing to do with 
the patent. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yvette Hyatt, Gilbert's and Michael's older sister, said she is not 
a party to the suit, though she believes that she is entitled to a share of her 
mother's estate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's close to three years now (since she died) and nothing has happened," she 
said. "The money was part of my mother's estate, and I wish she had spent it 
and enjoyed it herself." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Hyatt said he needs money from the family trust to live on while he 
pursues his suit, which seeks millions of dollars in damages against Northrop. 
He claims that he has been blacklisted by the defense industry and has been 
unable to find work since Northrop fired him. 
</P>
<P>
In his suit against Northrop, which is pending, Michael Hyatt alleges that the 
company knowingly manufactured defective parts for the MX missile guidance 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Les Daly, a Northrop spokesman, said Tuesday that the company denies the 
charges and noted that the federal government has declined to join Hyatt's 
lawsuit.

SANTA GROWS CIRCUMSPECT AT MANY COUNTY FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County companies plan to hang out the stockings for their employees 
again this holiday season, but they may not be filling them as full as in years 
past. 
</P>
<P>
"We're watching what we're spending," said Paul Hitzelberger, marketing vice 
president at Costa Mesa-based Del Taco Inc. The company plans more holiday 
events, he said, "but not as high-ticket." 
</P>
<P>
The attitude is in line with a national survey released Tuesday that said many 
companies still plan parties, gifts and bonuses for their employees during the 
holidays. But the scale of the celebration will be smaller, in reaction to the 
ailing economy. The survey, conducted by the Alexandria, Va.-based National 
Institute of Business Management, polled several hundred small to mid-size 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Few plan to hand out pink slips during the festive season, the national survey 
said, but those who have to make staff cuts will be breaking the bad news after 
the new year. 
</P>
<P>
Among the findings is that fewer companies will be tossing holiday galas for 
their employees -- 72% this year, compared to 86% last year. 
</P>
<P>
Del Taco, operator of a Mexican-style fast-food chain, traditionally puts on an 
evening holiday banquet at a local hotel, Hitzelberger said. But this year 
employees will share in smaller, weekly events that will include writing 
letters to troops overseas and collecting items for Toys for Tots. And they 
will sit down to a catered lunch in their offices just before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
On the bright side, the survey found that 65% of the firms plan to give their 
employees more time off during the holidays. Since Christmas and New Year's Day 
are on Tuesdays, many employers will observe Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve 
as full or half-day holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Lofstrom, a spokesman for Allergan Pharmaceuticals in Irvine, said the 
company is encouraging its more than 2,000 local employees to take their 
vacations between Christmas and New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
"It reduces vacation accrual and helps us meet our 1990 profit objectives," 
Lofstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
In the national study, 52% of the firms surveyed said they will award year-end 
bonuses, which will average $400. Last year, 66% awarded about the same amount. 
The survey said 42% plan to give gifts to their employees, down from 53% in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Wright, owner of Incentive Associates Inc. of Laguna Hills, said some 
companies are still offering their employees free trips as holiday rewards for 
good work, but the destinations may be closer to home. "Instead of looking at 
Paris, they may be looking at Hawaii," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The national survey also showed a trend away from serving hard drinks at 
company-sponsored parties, because of safety and liability concerns. This year, 
51% say beer, wine and liquor will be served, down from 63% last year. 
</P>
<P>
John Moffa, general manager of the Airporter Inn Hotel in Irvine, said liquor 
is still being served at company parties this holiday season, but fewer bosses 
are picking up the tab. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not as many host bars; it's more on a cash basis, so (companies) are 
saving a little money there." 
</P>

Equity Loan Boost: With tax deductions on most consumer loans being phased out 
this year, more homeowners are expected to tap the equity in their homes to pay 
off their debts and keep their tax write-offs, said Walter P. Blass, chairman 
of Shearson Lehman Mortgage Co. in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The average amount of home equity loans and lines of credit -- essentially 
junior mortgages -- approved last year by banks and savings and loans grew 38% 
to $287.6 million from $207.7 million in 1988, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1986 tax law was passed, the interest on consumer loans allowed to be 
deducted from income tax returns has been winding down. Only 10% of consumer 
loan interest is deductible this year, he said.

ROCKING THE 'MESSIAH' IN A MODERN CHRISTIAN WAY; 
</P>
<P>
NEW VERSION OF HANDEL MASTERPIECE WILL BE PERFORMED TWICE AT THE ANAHEIM 
CONVENTION CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comes the holiday season, and more than coal in his stockings, a music critic 
dreads the inevitable performances of Handel's "Messiah." 
</P>
<P>
Don't get me wrong. I love the "Messiah." 
</P>
<P>
What gets me down is the dreary way so many soloists and choruses sing the 
words. You would think they were talking about last year's Porsche or the price 
of homemade pasta in the local health food store, for all the emotion you get. 
</P>
<P>
So when news of a contemporary Christian version of the work -- called the 
"Young Messiah" -- came into the office, my ears perked up. (The "Young 
Messiah" will play Thursday and Friday at the Anaheim Convention Center as part 
of a 10-city tour. The Friday performance is sold out.) 
</P>
<P>
Here we were likely to hear people who believed these words. I mean, really 
believed them. 
</P>
<P>
Now, "Contemporary Christian" is a label of praise to some groups and anathema 
to others. Leaving that issue aside, I decided to have a listen to the cassette 
-- and a look at the videotape. (I mean, this is not your standard classical 
concert. . . . ) 
</P>
<P>
After all, there are various editions of this masterpiece. Handel made a number 
of them during his lifetime, adapting them to available singers. 
</P>
<P>
And until the "authentic" period performance movement really got its steam up 
in the last two decades, you also could hear all kinds of "Messiahs." Some had 
enormous choirs, a bevy of extra trumpets and drums, and even -- on one famous 
recording -- an anvil and cymbals. So why not an electric guitar, drums and 
synthesizers? 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to make a list of items a classical critic can scoff at, but what if 
we treat it as just another edition? 
</P>
<P>
The concept originated with Norman Miller, 48, a self-described entrepreneur 
and executive producer of the cable television program Videosyncrasy. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally love classical music," Miller said in a recent phone interview 
from his company headquarters in Virginia Beach, Va. "That's where it started. 
</P>
<P>
"I was brought up very much with classical music. I went to see the 'Messiah' 
every year in Edinburgh, Scotland, with my mother and father. I had a real love 
for the 'Messiah.' 
</P>
<P>
"From the very beginning, from the age of 20, I wanted other people to hear the 
'Messiah' that would possibly never, ever hear the classic version in a concert 
hall. . . . It has just taken a long time (for the idea) to come around." 
</P>
<P>
For all the changes, including the overlay of a rock beat, what you hear is 
authentic Handel -- mostly. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I was real sensitive to that, as other people were," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"We formed a committee to choose (what to include). We decided by songs that 
were better known or songs which would work in a more contemporary fashion. 
Some songs wouldn't adapt very well in a more contemporary style." 
</P>
<P>
He sang some of the running notes on single syllables as an example of what 
they felt wouldn't work in the new style. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the committee included Paul Mills, credited for keyboard and rhythm 
arrangements, and Don Hart, who did the singing, orchestra and choral 
arrangements. Both are classically trained musicians, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Clocking in at just over an hour, roughly one-third of the original, the "Young 
Messiah" necessarily omits much of the original, rescores sections and also 
changes Handel's order. 
</P>
<P>
The work begins (after the Overture) with the chorus "And the glory of the 
Lord" instead of the tenor recitative, "Comfort ye my people." It ends with the 
"Hallelujah!" chorus tacked onto "Worthy is the Lamb" (the "Amen" chorus is 
omitted). This change is particularly jarring. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the omitted recitatives or arias are simply spoken by a narrator (Barry 
"Eve of Destruction" McGuire) over the beginnings and endings of other pieces. 
Some of the musical parts are simplified or otherwise edited. 
</P>
<P>
The soloists definitely sing American. You hear "comfert ye" instead of 
"comfort," for instance, and other reminders of our everyday speech. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the soloists will bend, embellish or add expressive elements to their 
lines, a practice expected in Handel's time but all too rarely exercised by 
classically trained musicians today. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, negative thoughts in the original are omitted. 
</P>
<P>
In "I know that my Redeemer liveth," cut is the line: "And though worms destroy 
this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God." Instead, the whole chorus comes 
(at first a cappella, then with hymn-like harmonies) to repeat the opening 
phrases, even though Handel has no such repeat, nor such passages for chorus. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in "The trumpet shall sound," the entire middle section, "For this 
corruptible must put on incorruption" is cut. (This, however, used to be a 
traditional cut). Handel didn't flinch from these ideas. Why should the "Young 
Messiah"? 
</P>
<P>
The Overture begins as if you're going to hear a straight classical 
performance, with the orchestra playing stylishly crisp rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
Then on the repeat of the opening Grave passages (or at bar 13 of the score), 
the three-piece rock band (electric guitar, synthesizer and drums) comes in. 
There and in the ensuing fugue, the rhythms become blocky, even and square. 
Extra notes are thrown in to fill out measures. 
</P>
<P>
Over time the incessant rock beat (softened to a light Latin pulse in "He was 
despised" and "I know that my Redeemer liveth") begins to wear, and this points 
up some essential differences between rock and classical music: 
</P>
<P>
Rock tends to emphasize the four-bar phrase, with the drummer accenting the 
second and fourth beats; classical music favors longer musical lines and 
less-regimented rhythms, so a steady rock beat works against Handel's musical 
stresses within a bar and also his spinning out of phrases beyond a single bar 
or two. 
</P>
<P>
For all that, Miller said that so far negative reactions to this version have 
been "remarkably few." 
</P>
<P>
"One or two people have written in and said that they feel I deserve to go to 
purgatory," he said. "A few people have been totally offended. Also, some wrote 
that I was, like, tampering with Scripture. 
</P>
<P>
"Then some other people wrote and said that I arranged this to replace the 
original 'Messiah.' But I always felt I could get people to listen who might 
otherwise not listen to it. And I have been amazed at the purists who have 
actually loved it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, the most radical (arrangement) is 'The trumpet shall sound,' " 
Miller said. "A purist would find it the hardest to accept because we've got 
this unbelievable trumpet player, Phil Driscoll, who also is a singer in the 
vein of Joe Cocker. So you put this outrageous trumpet playing together with 
his outrageous voice. Some purists have been most disturbed about this song. 
But I get goose bumps when I hear it. My feelings are that people are going to 
go wild about this song."

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has canceled a planned visit to Oslo for 
the presentation of his Nobel Peace Prize, Tass news agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
Tass quoted the Soviet president's press office as saying plans to attend the 
Dec. 10 presentation were changed because of the "crucial situation in the 
country and the president's preoccupation with affairs that occupy his constant 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, awarded the Peace Prize for his reforms that allowed the end of the 
Cold War and the flourishing of democratic movements in Eastern Europe, has 
been criticized at home for devoting too much time to foreign affairs and 
overseas trips while the Soviet Union suffers serious shortages and domestic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped in Moscow that the Nobel committee will understand the reason for 
this postponement and agree to present the prize at a later date," Tass said.

<P>
Two men shocked a Huntington Beach woman with an electric stun gun before 
robbing her of her purse, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Alicia K. Derieux, 23, told police that the robbers escaped with $1 in cash 
along with her checks and credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a rare one," Lt. John Foster said of the stun gun robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Stun guns, which are legal, send out electronic charges from two metal prongs, 
shocking the victim and in some cases rendering the person unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery occurred late last night at Derieux's carport at an apartment 
complex in the 6700 block of Warner Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Foster said two men approached Derieux and instructed her "not to turn around." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the suspects shot the woman (with the stun gun) in her right arm," 
Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
Derieux suffered a small bruise but she did not require hospitalization, Foster 
said.

D.A. WON'T CHARGE AXL ROSE

<P>
Citing insufficient evidence, prosecutors today declined to file assault 
charges against Axl Rose, lead singer for the heavy metal band Guns 'N Roses, 
who was arrested for allegedly hitting a woman neighbor over the head with a 
wine bottle. 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of the criminal charges, prosecutors scheduled an informal hearing at 
which both Rose and the neighbor will meet with a representative of the 
district attorney in an attempt to reach an agreement to ensure that no future 
confrontations occur. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, 28, was arrested Oct. 30 at his West Hollywood condominium for allegedly 
hitting his neighbor, Gabriela Kantor, 37, over the head with a wine bottle, 
authorities said. He was booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon 
and was released on $5,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies said Kantor and Rose had been involved in an ongoing dispute 
over the last few months about how loudly he played music in his unit. 
</P>
<P>
Since the incident, Rose has decided to sell his condo and move into a 
single-family home.

Liberia's three warring factions agreed on a cease-fire today, boosting 
prospects for an end to civil warfare that has claimed more than 10,000 lives 
in 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed at a summit attended by leaders of 13 Western African 
countries convened to seek a settlement in Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
Signing the agreement were Charles Taylor, head of the main rebel faction; 
Prince Johnson, leader of a breakaway rebel force, and Maj. Wilmot Diggs of the 
Liberian army, representing the followers of slain President Samuel Doe. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place in Mali's capital city, Bamako, 400 miles northeast of 
the Liberian capital, Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
The talks that led to the accord marked the first time that all three sides had 
met face-to-face for negotiations to resolve the conflict. Taylor had refused 
to attend previous peace talks.

A piece of a B-17 bomber buried for 48 years in the Greenland icecap was 
presented today to the woman whose name was painted on the piece of metal by 
her pilot husband before he flew off to fight the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
Explorers who found the bomber buried in the Arctic icecap presented the 
keepsake to Phyllis Arleen Hanna this morning at Peachtree-DeKalb Airport north 
of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the St. Louis woman gave keys to the plane to the explorers who set 
out nine years ago to locate eight American warplanes that crash-landed in 
Greenland in July, 1942. 
</P>
<P>
The two B-17s and six P-38 Lightning fighters ran out of fuel after receiving 
false radio transmissions from German submarines. The crews camped for nine 
days until rescuers arrived on dog sled. 
</P>
<P>
One of those rescued was Hanna's husband, Joe D. Hanna Jr., who had painted her 
name under his cockpit window. He died in 1981, the year the Greenland 
Expedition Society was formed. 
</P>
<P>
The expedition located the bomber with radar in 1988 and used a borer to cut a 
3 1/2-foot-wide hole and take the piece with Hanna's name on it. Last summer, 
the explorers cut a much larger cavern 20 feet long on one side. 
</P>
<P>
The fuselage of the bomber was found to have collapsed under the weight of 250 
feet of ice. Movement within the glacier had broken it apart.

JUDGE LIFTS BAN ON CNN AIRING OF NORIEGA TAPE

<P>
A federal judge today lifted his ban against Cable News Network's broadcast of 
Manuel Noriega's prison phone calls to his legal team. 
</P>
<P>
The ban on CNN's use of the tape had sparked a fierce constitutional debate, 
pitting the right of free speech against the right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
"The tapes may be published as CNN wishes to publish them," U.S. District Judge 
William Hoeveler said at a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's attorney, Frank Rubino, said he no longer had any objection to CNN's 
use of the tapes. The only tape he challenged was a conversation between 
Noriega and his defense team that had already been broadcast by CNN. 
</P>
<P>
"It does no good to close the barn door after the horse is out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also ordered the federal Bureau of Prisons to stop its practice of 
sharing tape-recorded conversations in the Noriega case with other government 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler last month temporarily barred CNN from using parts of taped 
conversations between Noriega and his attorneys, who said airing the tapes 
would destroy the ousted Panamanian dictator's defense against drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
CNN broadcast some tapes, including a conversation between Noriega and Rubino's 
secretary, who acted as a translator for Rubino's investigator. 
</P>
<P>
An appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to lift the order, and CNN 
last week turned over the tapes it had obtained to Hoeveler for review.

Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov's government of former Communists, unable to halt 
the slide toward political and economic anarchy, will yield to demands that it 
resign, the state news agency reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Police beat anti-government students blocking traffic today on the third day of 
a general strike against Lukanov, BTA news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Support for the strike called by the opposition Podkrepa trade union appeared 
to be growing. The national airline Balkan suspended all flights because of the 
strike and Sofia airport was closed, according to radio reports. 
</P>
<P>
Podkrepa said Tuesday that 790,000 Bulgarians took part in the strike, 
including 220,000 in Sofia. The figures could not be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
BTA said it had learned from sources close to President Zhelyu Zhelev that the 
52-year-old Lukanov and his Socialist government will resign in a compromise 
with the Union of Democratic Forces, the main opposition coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"The president will appoint a caretaker Cabinet headed by a prime minister who 
will be neither of the Bulgarian Socialist Party nor of the Union of Democratic 
Forces," the news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Lukanov, speaking to reporters later, said the BTA report was premature. But he 
did not deny it. 
</P>
<P>
He said the composition of a new government had not yet been discussed. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this will happen soon because the current situation must not continue," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
BTA quoted opposition leader Petar Beron as telling a rally that Lukanov's last 
condition for resigning was to be permitted to do so with dignity.

Americans will spend $37 billion on Christmas gifts this year, about 4% less 
than the 1989 holiday season, the Conference Board said today. 
</P>
<P>
The typical American family is expected to spend about $325 on Christmas gifts 
in 1990, down from $335 last year, the research group said. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday spending is expected to drop in three of the nation's four major 
regions. Median family spending in the Northeast is expected to drop the 
sharpest -- 7% to $357. 
</P>
<P>
The West, including Rocky Mountain and Pacific coast states, is expected to be 
the only region to hold steady, at a projected $315. 
</P>
<P>
"Holiday joy is being tempered by continuing fears about the Middle East crisis 
and pending federal tax increases," said Fabian Linden, executive director of 
the board's Consumer Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, it may very well be that when all the Christmas lights are lit and the 
carols are being sung, the gift-giving spirit will be stronger than suggested 
in the current survey. One bright spot is this year's holiday shopping season 
is slightly longer than last year's," he said.

TRANSPORTATION SECTOR FUELS RISE IN DURABLE ORDERS

Orders to U.S. factories for "big-ticket" durable goods jumped 3.6% in October, 
driven by a 14.6% gain in the transportation sector, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods -- items 
expected to last more than three years -- totaled a seasonally adjusted $129.4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
It was the largest advance since a 4.1% gain in May. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding transportation, however, orders fell 0.4% last month. 
</P>
<P>
Orders fell 1.6% in September and 0.9% in August. 
</P>
<P>
"Since reaching a high in December, 1988, of $132.1 billion, orders have been 
unstable, fluctuating around a monthly average of $125.9 billion," the 
department said. "Much of the volatility was attributable to transportation 
equipment." 
</P>
<P>
Durable goods orders are a key barometer of manufacturing industry plans for 
production. A decrease in orders could result in a slump in that sector and 
subsequent job layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation orders totaled $37.9 billion, reflecting purchases of both 
aircraft and automobiles. They had fallen 6.1% in September after a 1% gain the 
previous month. 
</P>
<P>
Orders in the key category of non-defense capital goods, often a barometer of 
business plans to expand and modernize, rose 8.3% to $41.4 billion after 
advancing 6.7% in September. 
</P>
<P>
Only orders for non-electrical machinery and for defense goods posted declines. 
Non-electrical machinery orders were off 1.5%.

The Sunday Correspondent, a weekly newspaper with national circulation, is 
folding after failing to find the investment needed to stay afloat, the paper's 
management announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Correspondent, which includes the owner of the Chicago Tribune among 
major shareholders, was launched on to the crowded Sunday newspaper scene on 
Sept. 17, 1989, at a cost of $25.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
But sales of the paper fell below the 350,000 figure needed to break even, and 
last August shareholders pumped in another $19 million to keep it going. 
</P>
<P>
The paper also switched editors in what it called "the interests of the 
continued shareholder support," and on Sept. 30 became a tabloid. The demise of 
the Sunday Correspondent leaves Britain with 10 national weekly Sunday 
newspapers.

New York City has moved to take cigarettes out of the hands of youngsters by 
taking cigarette machines out of most public places. 
</P>
<P>
A law banning cigarette vending machines in all public places but taverns and 
hotel bars, where minors are not allowed anyway, was passed 33 to 1 by the City 
Council on Tuesday and signed by Mayor David N. Dinkins. "Today we have 
achieved an important pro-child, pro-health law that will save lives," said 
Dinkins, who quit smoking 28 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Each year in New York, 32,000 children begin a habit that will lead to the 
death of 10,000 of them." 
</P>
<P>
The law, which orders the machines removed by Jan. 31, 1992, is similar to 
measures already in effect in Minneapolis and Salt Lake City.

Cooper won five NBA titles with the Lakers but never made the league's all-star 
team.

"It's a great honor making the all-stars no matter what league you're in," 
Cooper said. "I feel guilty that after being in the so-called elite of 
basketball for so long it took me such such a short time to become an all-star 
here."

Stern said in today's edition that it had obtained a confidential East German

<P>
Voss, the only one of the accused athletes who could be reached for comment,

SURGERY EASES PAIN OF DARLING'S BAD YEAR

Tuesday was an exciting day for Ron Darling. The Mets' right-hander found he 
was able to touch his right shoulder with his right hand for the first time in 
four years. "It was a wonderful feeling," Darling said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a feeling made possible by Oct. 25 elbow surgery in which he said "lots 
and lots of chips the size of lima beans" were removed from his right elbow. 
Plans call for him to begin throwing around Jan. 1 and be at full strength by 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
Darling has concluded that the injury may have contributed to his poor 7-9 
season. But in an odd way, the injury is helping him. He forgets "the craziness 
of last year" by focusing on his return to health. 
</P>
<P>
For the present, anyway, Darling has recanted on his wish to be traded. "I've 
always said I'd love to stay in New York if I could pitch here," he said. "The 
key is, if I pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Darling asked to be dealt after his confusing and personally unsuccessful year 
ended, but the Mets did not oblige. 
</P>
<P>
Darling was unhappy much of the season as he shuttled between the rotation and 
the bullpen. "I'm praying to God I don't have to repeat it," Darling said. "But 
if they keep all of us (starting pitchers), it's going to be a similar 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Trading a pitcher with a suddenly questionable arm isn't easy. Asked about 
that, Mets Vice President Gerry Hunsicker said, "First, I would want to make 
certain that everyone knows we're not coming out with the statement that we're 
looking to trade Ron Darling. To answer the generic question, I would say (an 
injury) would not help the situation." 
</P>
<P>
And Darling added, "It's a real touchy issue because you're talking about a 
pitcher who had a bad year."

LIZ SMITH: CELEBRITY HONCHOS DUDED UP FOR CHARITY 'HOEDOWN'

MARY TYLER Moore won my vote for the best costume at the Literacy Volunteers of 
New York City "Hoedown" Monday night in Manhattan's Armenian Church rec hall. 
She was in suede fringe showing plenty of that fine MTM leg. 
</P>
<P>
Two other midnight cowgirls were Claudette Colbert and Gayfryd Steinberg, both 
head-to-toe in black and wearing what each told me was "a real cowboy hat." 
Tita (Mrs. Sammy) Cahn had on an authentic Indian headdress, but was too 
chicken to wear it until the New York City Swing Band had revved the crowd up 
to total madness. She ended the night with feathers flying. 
</P>
<P>
You should have seen Peter Jennings and Kati Marton in their authentic Wild 
West togs. However, the sedate Mike Wallace came as a civilian, and Walter 
Cronkite, my Texas pal, was more informal than Western. Pauline Trigere wore 
her bandanna like a mask and had on mismatched cowboy boots. "I made a fashion 
mistake," the fashion giant said. Brooke Astor was in a dirndl that seemed to 
come from west of the Alps. She looked divine, saying, "It still fits me after 
35 years!" Barbara Walters and Beverly Sills had a table right out of "Girl of 
the Golden West." 
</P>
<P>
Would you believe Nancy and Henry Kissinger dressed up wild and woolly? They 
were wonderful. And it is always fun to watch dudes trying to eat the Joe T. 
Garcia of Ft. Worth special tamale without removing the shuck. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Steve Ross and Time Warner and many other generous souls, Literacy 
racked up almost $500,000 with this one, which may become an annual event. 
</P>
<P>
I'M SO happy to report Betty Furness is doing well at Memorial Sloan-Kettering 
Hospital in New York. Doctors say her surgery was entirely successful and 
there's no sign that her abdominal malignancy had spread.

COLEMAN HOSPITALIZED IN ARIZONA

Former child actor Gary Coleman, the star of television's "Diff'rent Strokes" 
series, has been hospitalized in Arizona with kidney problems, his publicist 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
"It is anticipated that the actor, who is resting comfortably and in good 
spirits, will be released from the hospital within a week's time," said Coleman 
spokesman Michael Gerety. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman lives in Tucson, but his exact whereabouts were secret. The publicist 
wouldn't reveal the name of the hospital or even the Arizona city where he was 
bedridden. 
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old actor was stable and "is expected to make a complete recovery," 
Gerety said. 
</P>
<P>
The exact nature of Coleman's ailment wasn't revealed, but his publicist said 
in a statement: "Coleman, the recipient of two kidney transplants, has a 
longstanding history of renal disease and his hospitalization is related to his 
kidney condition."

SYLVIA SIDNEY, 80, TAKES FILM HONOR IN STRIDE 
</P>

Barking. Dogs are barking. Two black pugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Petey! Malcolm!" their owner, Sylvia Sidney, calls out. "Quiet! You be quiet 
in there!" The barking, heard from the bedroom of her hotel suite, quickly 
fades. 
</P>
<P>
Animals hardly intimidate an actress who faced down football players in 
"Beetlejuice." Sidney is 80 years old, a tiny woman built to last. Last spring, 
she caught pneumonia and was hospitalized for several weeks, but she gets 
around quite well now, not needing a cane. 
</P>
<P>
Luck and "excellent medical care" are the secrets, she insists. Also a strong 
mind. Sidney has no use for sentimentality. She doesn't gush about her old 
movies and shrugs off a tribute being given by the Film Society of Lincoln 
Center on Friday, joking, "If they don't get to it now, God knows what is going 
to happen." 
</P>
<P>
"Ugh, God," she groans as she remembers Alfred Hitchcock's "Sabotage," a 1936 
thriller in which Sidney murders her husband (Oscar Homolka) after discovering 
he's a saboteur. 
</P>
<P>
"If you did not know I was already an established fine actress, if you had 
never heard of me, had never heard of Homolka, you would have looked at it and 
said, 'What are those people doing?' 
</P>
<P>
"It was all Hitchcock. It had nothing to do with people acting. It was 
carefully timed. It was easy to indulge in the ego, 'My performance,' but it 
was because of Hitchcock. He was a cinema man." 
</P>
<P>
She's equally dry-eyed about today's movies. Most young directors don't impress 
her. "I think I'm too tough for Spielberg," she snaps. Tim Burton of 
"Beetlejuice" is an exception. 
</P>
<P>
"I turned it down so many times because I couldn't understand the script," says 
Sidney, who played a cranky social worker from the great beyond. "I finally had 
a long conversation with them, and they said, 'Read the script again.' I said 
you'll have to send another one because I threw the other one away. So they 
sent me one again. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never heard of Tim Burton. He met me the morning I arrived in 
California. We had breakfast together. We had lunch together, and I was in love 
. . . his sensitivity, how he thought about scenes." 
</P>
<P>
Sidney, a descendant of Russian Jews, was born Sophia Kosow in New York City in 
1910. Her parents were divorced when she was young, and her mother took another 
husband, Dr. Sigmund Sidney, a dental surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
She began taking dancing lessons at age 10 and was a teen-ager when she made 
her stage debut, appearing in the title role of the Theatre Guild's production 
of "Prunella" in 1926. After breaking into films in the late '20s, Sidney 
became one of Paramount's five leading actresses along with Claudette Colbert, 
Marlene Dietrich, Miriam Hopkins and Carole Lombard. 
</P>
<P>
The others were tough and sharp-witted, the way Sidney is. But her specialty, 
ironically, was playing victims: the slum girl who loses her boyfriend to a 
socialite in "An American Tragedy" (Shelley Winters had the same role in the 
1951 remake, "A Place in the Sun"), the nice girlfriend of racketeer Gary 
Cooper in "City Streets," the nice girlfriend of falsely accused murderer 
Spencer Tracy in "Fury." 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, she received an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actress 
for "Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams," in which she played Joanne Woodward's 
mother. She won a Golden Globe in 1986 and was nominated for an Emmy for "An 
Early Frost." 
</P>
<P>
She married three times, all ending in divorce, and had one child, Jacob, who 
died in the mid-1980s of Lou Gehrig's disease. Sidney has done extensive work 
for the National ALS Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Now living in Danbury, Conn., Sidney's hobbies include gardening and 
needlepoint, about which she has written two books. She also makes occasional 
trips to Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Her illness changed her priorities, she says, and she plans to leave all her 
money to charities such as Covenant House, anything to do with children. 
</P>
<P>
"I plan to die without a nickel," she notes calmly. "I will be penniless, but 
not a pauper. It will all be gone, at least what's in cash. The rest will be 
disseminated among my friends."

Rock star Sting said his Virgin Forest Foundation has collected $1.3 million to 
help create Brazil's biggest Indian reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Sting said Tuesday he came to Brazil to meet with the foundation's leaders and 
account for donations raised since the group was founded in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation seeks to join five national parks to form a 30-million-acre 
Indian reserve. Sting said the money would also be used for education, health 
and Indian cultural projects. 
</P>
<P>
Foundation President Olimpio Serra said the donations had been deposited in a 
foreign bank account and will be transferred to Brazil's National Indian 
Foundation if the government authorizes the reserve.
