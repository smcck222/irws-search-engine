A recent issue of the Daily Bruin featured eye-opening stories about UCLA 
students sighting alien spacecraft, a planned missile silo on campus, and a 
seminar "on the art of winning" by USC football coach Larry Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Daily Trojan surprised some readers one day by reporting that it 
was ceasing publication because of "mounting litigation costs" while also 
trumpeting a USC chemistry professor's discovery of bean dip. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the "Daily Trojan" was published by the Daily Bruin, and vice versa. 
The traditional parodies were dropped secretly on each other's campuses before 
the USC-UCLA football game. 
</P>
<P>
The fakes caused more controversy than usual because there were some 
accusations on each side that the stories contained undercurrents of racism, 
sexism and homophobia. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Student Council went so far as to condemn the Daily Trojan. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's been blown out of proportion," responded one USC editor. "And 
please keep in mind that we are only college students." 
</P>
<P>
There's even been talk of a mutual agreement to discontinue the bogus editions. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt if that'll happen," said one UCLA editor. "We have a lot of fun doing 
it (the parody), as long as it's tasteful." 
</P>
<P>
Estimating the value of gifts obviously isn't a science among L.A. council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
A list published in The Times the other day showed that attorney Art Snyder 
sent a monthly fruit package to six City Council members in 1988. And the 
yearly worth of the gifts was valued variously at $100 (by Joy Picus), $180 (by 
Gloria Molina) and $225 (by Ruth Galanter). 
</P>
<P>
It isn't a case of comparing apples and oranges, either. Snyder, a former 
council member, says he sends the same fruit shipments (worth about $160) to 
each of his pals. 
</P>
<P>
Freeway Spill du Jour (let's not even mention the body that fell out of a 
coroner's van on the Hollywood Freeway): A refrigerator on the Golden State 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Enticing sign outside a Long Beach pizza joint: 
</P>
<P>
"Money contains germs. Spend it here and take no chance." 
</P>
<P>
A while back we mentioned that Los Angeles -- once known as a city full of 
people born somewhere else -- had never produced a native who became mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, one of the 38 Hizzoners was born here, just a few blocks from the 
current site of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
He was Fred Eaton (1855-1934), who was born, writes historian Abraham Hoffman, 
"in an adobe building on Fort Moore Hill where the administrative offices of 
the L.A. Unified School District are now located." He served from 1898 to 1900 
(too early to receive any fruit from Snyder). 
</P>
<P>
Does this make you feel a bit older? Dick Clark, America's oldest teen-ager, 
turns 60 Thursday.

DENG RETIRES

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the things I have to be thankful for is that the politicians here in the 
United States do not follow the example of former Chinese leader, Deng 
Xiaoping, and retire because they "might say crazy things" (Part A, Nov. 21). 
</P>
<P>
We would have no government left if our leaders retired just because they might 
say crazy things. And what would David Letterman, Jay Leno and Johnny Carson do 
for material without leaders saying crazy things! 
</P>
<P>
I would not want to live in a world without Dan Quayle, George Bush, Richard 
Nixon, Gerald Ford and Gary Hart. 
</P>
<P>
I'm only 42 and I already say crazy things. I'm glad I don't live in China!

CUTTING U.S. DEFENSE SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Change in Europe Clouds Defense Industry Outlook," Part A, Nov. 
21: 
</P>
<P>
As countless Americans go without adequate nutrition and housing, as our 
children fall behind their peers around the world in basic learning and turn 
instead to dangerous drugs, as our air and water become unsafe, as thousands 
upon thousands fall sick and die from AIDS, and as our country loses ground 
daily in the technological battle with the Japanese, we worry that the fallout 
from democratic change in Eastern Europe may include a substantial drop in the 
defense budget. This $180-billion reduction might lead to widespread layoffs in 
Southern California's defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
$180 billion! Think of the potential. We could help shore up our crumbling 
bridges and roadways before the next natural disaster. We could equip our 
schools with computers and pay our teachers a wage commensurate with their 
extraordinary value. We could map the human genome -- maybe even find a cure 
for AIDS or come close to understanding the terrible mystery of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
We could begin to tackle, with real resolve and national will, the big issues: 
famine, pollution and overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
Surely the immensely talented men and women who are employed in the design and 
manufacture of instruments of warfare could turn their remarkable ingenuity and 
dedication to solving the problems of a troubled human community. Surely our 
taxes are best spent when they leave the world a healthier place.

JOB PAYOFF FOR TEENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boston's business leaders made an intriguing offer several years ago. If the 
public schools improved, high school graduates would be given the first shot at 
jobs. The Boston Compact has paid off with a dramatic success in teen-age 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
Boston is the only city in the nation where white and minority employment is 
nearly equal for recent high school graduates. The near parity dates back to 
1985, three years after the compact began, a time when all high school 
graduates faced a 19.5% unemployment rate, and minorities faced a 50% 
unemployment rate. But in Boston, 61% of white high school graduates were 
working and 60% of minority graduates also had jobs. There has been no letup: 
90% of recent graduates are working or going to college. 
</P>
<P>
Boston's success has led to many spinoff programs. The National Alliance of 
Business is directing projects in 12 other cities with the same goals -- better 
schools and a better-trained work force -- although the approaches differ. In 
Detroit, according to the NAB, a sense of crisis motivated the business 
community to get organized and back school reform. In Cincinnati, Procter &amp; 
Gamble took the lead and top executives personally spent 15 hours a week to 
launch an educational program that embraces preschool through high school. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the United Neighborhoods Organization and South-Central 
Organizing Committee persuaded business, government and school leaders to sign 
a similar compact for graduates of six public high schools. But the results 
have been disappointing. The original criteria -- a 2.5 grade-point average and 
a 95% attendance record -- focused on students who were more likely to go to 
college rather than seek a job after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
It is encouraging to note that the Los Angeles business community is taking the 
lead with a new partnership, dubbed Work Force LA. The task force includes the 
mayor, the state and Los Angeles superintendents of schools, the chancellor of 
the community colleges and business leaders, including members of the 
California Business Roundtable. Work Force LA will concentrate on Mayor Tom 
Bradley's new program to place 1,000 at-risk youngsters in city jobs and 
solicit commitments for additional jobs from major corporations. It is an 
effort that deserves the community's full and long-term support.

CUTTING U.S. DEFENSE SPENDING

<TEXT>
<P>
The unfolding major decline in worldwide communism should strikingly improve 
the military security of the United States. However, even if we receive a 
"peace" dividend because of reduced military expenditures, our country might 
face tougher economic competition. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those countries converting from communism to capitalism would become 
far more competitive in a global economy. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of World War II, the U.S. dominated the world economy, but has seen 
its share of the world gross national product slip with the rise of other 
capitalist economies out of the ashes of war. 
</P>
<P>
Aren't we in for a new wave of hard-nosed competitors out of the ashes of 
communism? 
</P>
<P>
What if a number of these new capitalists follow Japan's post-war philosophy of 
high savings and investment rates, in order to favor a rapid buildup in 
production capacity? If so, are we willing to curtail our profligate consumer 
borrowing and spending habits in order to compete under the new reality?

GRAMMAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Colburn argues that low achievement in writing is the result of "junking 
the grammar lesson" and a failure to correct errors ("The Ostrich Method of 
English Grammar," California Commentary, Nov. 20). Research over several 
decades, however, has shown that direct teaching of grammar and error 
correction has little or no effect on student writing. The research does show 
that students who read more read better, write better, have larger 
vocabularies, and even do better on grammar tests. Our students need good 
literature programs and improved school libraries, not more sentence 
diagramming.

CLEAN UP THE SWEATSHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sweatshops are generations old in the garment industry, where extreme 
competitiveness among clothing manufacturers melds with the needs of immigrants 
to scrape out even the meanest of livings. Traditional enforcement has focused 
on unannounced sweeps by inspectors from one sweatshop to another, looking for 
wage, child labor, home sewing, overtime and other violations. 
</P>
<P>
But, as a recent Times series pointed out, many sweatshops that had been 
concentrated in downtown Los Angeles are moving to the suburbs and Orange 
County. That makes the task of those charged with protecting such workers 
harder still. 
</P>
<P>
Overwhelmingly female Latina and Asian immigrants, they toil either in small 
industrial parks or rent sewing machines to work in their own homes. Few know 
that commercial home sewing violates both state and federal laws. Nearly all 
work for far less than the minimum wage. Some get their children to help. But 
workers seldom speak up about wages or working conditions for fear of being 
fired. Some also fear deportation; still others are silent because they 
illegally supplement their incomes with welfare payments. 
</P>
<P>
The system that breeds such misery must be attacked on many fronts. Gov. George 
Deukmejian -- who had dismantled Cal/OSHA before it was reinstated last 
November by a vote of the people -- has never made enforcement of labor laws a 
priority. So the state must do more to enforce laws already on the books to 
protect workers, especially those who work at home. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Labor's Wage &amp; Hour Division in Santa Ana has dusted 
off a 1938 "hot goods" statute forbidding shipment across state lines of any 
product made in violation of federal labor laws. Using the law, authorities are 
cracking down on four Los Angeles manufacturers who were shipping to retailers 
"hot goods" made in Orange County sweatshops that allegedly violated minimum 
wage and other laws. That's a good start. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration also must abandon its effort to lift a 47-year-old ban 
on sewing women's clothes in the home. Garment union officials, testifying on 
the proposal in Los Angeles last spring, said that if the ban were lifted, even 
more women would be vulnerable to unscrupulous and exploitative contractors. 
</P>
<P>
There is another way to get at the problem: Manufacturers who knowingly 
cooperate with contractors who hire workers at illegally low wages should be 
publicly exposed. Then retail buyers -- who have no other way of telling under 
what circumstances the clothes they buy are made -- can exert pressure on the 
manufacturers to clean up their act.

TENNIS: FASTER INDOOR PLAYING SURFACE COMPLEMENTS LENDL'S POWER GAME IN 6-1, 
6-3 NABISCO MASTERS VICTORY.

<P>
If Michael Chang never again beats Ivan Lendl, at least he will always have 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
They held a rematch of one of the great mismatches of all time Tuesday night in 
the opening round of the $3 million Nabisco Masters at Madison Square Garden, 
where Lendl defeated Chang, 6-1, 6-3, the opposite outcome of Chang's French 
Open upset. 
</P>
<P>
It was on the red clay of Roland Garros that Chang, a teen-ager suffering from 
muscle cramps, defeated the No. 1-ranked Lendl in a five-set epic that left the 
tennis world shaking its head. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, who went on to win the French Open and claim his first Grand Slam title 
at age 17, said he expects Lendl to remember that June day in Paris for a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say there is going to be a little bitterness whenever he plays me 
because of what happened in France," Chang said. "But I think it's just one of 
those things. Everybody has his day." 
</P>
<P>
This time, it was Lendl's night. He served five aces, watched Chang double 
fault twice on break points and was the clear victor in the game of power and 
aggression that is the usual product of winning players on the blue rubberized 
indoor surface. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Chang could use his speed to run down Lendl's booming groundstrokes on 
the slow French clay, this surface kept the ball bouncing low and fast. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, this surface favors me over him," said Lendl, who said he should 
always enjoy an edge in power whenever he faces Chang. 
</P>
<P>
"He's never going to be 6-foot-2," Lendl said. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker, who is 6-4, stood tall in his match against Brad Gilbert. Becker 
started slowly but finished fast and beat Gilbert, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
The defending champion, Becker weathered a blizzard of break points and won 
despite struggling against Gilbert, who had won four of their five previous 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope things get better from here," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
Chang's serve betrayed him at the worst times. Serving to stay in the first set 
and trailing, 1-5, Chang led, 40-0, but eventually double faulted at set point. 
</P>
<P>
Now down a set, Chang broke Lendl at love to begin the second set, but he was 
quickly broken back when he double faulted to 1-1 on the first break point of 
the second game. Chang lost his serve in the seventh game when, at 15-40, Lendl 
unloaded a big forehand winner down the line as he approached the net. 
</P>
<P>
Serving for the match at 5-3, Lendl worked to 30-30, then placed a perfect 
forehand drop shot barely out of Chang's reach and served his fifth and final 
ace at match point. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl said that he had no revenge motive against Chang. What happened to him in 
Paris might have been a mechanical problem, Lendl said. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, it enters your mind," Lendl said. "You think of what you did and 
what went wrong and you second guess yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"(In Paris) I just ran out of strength in my upper body when he was hurting," 
Lendl said. "I could not put the ball away. Obviously, that's not going to 
happen here." 
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of his Masters debut, Andre Agassi wore pink tights. His left 
pinky nail was painted with a pink lightning bolt on a black background. 
</P>
<P>
A pink pinky? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was quite spectacular," said Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
Thus was made the fashion statement of the evening, however brief it may have 
been. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi absorbed a 6-4, 6-2, defeat from Stefan Edberg which wounded his neck, 
if not his sartorial taste. He must have slept on his neck wrong the night 
before, Agassi said, then wondered if he might be forced to pull out. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, Agassi said, forces him to move stiffly when he turns one way. 
</P>
<P>
"I look like Frankenstein when I look to the right," Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
He looked something entirely else with his groundbreaking tennis attire. It 
included a black and white shirt with vertical pink stripes. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi was asked why he wore the pink tights, the color of which is called "hot 
lava." He knew one reason for sure. 
</P>
<P>
"Looks is a priority," he said. "And I guess it keeps my hips warm." 
</P>
<P>
As for his fingernail polish, Agassi said there is nothing so special about the 
black and pink. 
</P>
<P>
"It just matches my shorts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg said he was unaware that he was playing someone wearing nail polish. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really look at guys' nails, do you?" Edberg said. 
</P>
<P>
If Agassi is unable to play Becker tonight, then alternate Alberto Mancino will 
take his place.

49ER ADVANTAGE OVER GIANTS WAS MONTANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When quarterbacks Joe Montana and Phil Simms were shooting it out Monday night 
at Candlestick Park, their only difference, it sometimes seemed, was the color 
of their uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
In his familiar red 49er shirt, Montana threw 27 strikes for 292 yards, missing 
on only six attempts. In his whites, Simms, playing catch-up, completed 25 of 
48 passes to advance the New York Giants 326 yards. 
</P>
<P>
And although Montana delivered three touchdown passes, Simms, nearly as 
impressive, threw a pair. 
</P>
<P>
But after the Giants had lost it, 34-24, you could look back and see why. Simms 
had thrown three interceptions, Montana none. 
</P>
<P>
Simms' interceptions were crippling. Two set up 49er touchdowns after 
linebacker Matt Millen and cornerback Eric Wright took passes away from New 
York receivers at the Giant 35 and 16. The other theft, by 49er safety Chet 
Brooks, ended a fourth-quarter Giant move at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
An interception is probably the most damaging football misplay -- chilling the 
confidence of the passer, raising the spirits of the other team, and often 
changing the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
And, not surprisingly, Montana has been taking pains to avoid this particular 
error. He has thrown 22 touchdown passes this season against four 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Simms in 12 weeks has thrown 12 touchdown passes and 12 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
That was the 49er edge. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reigning experts on 1989 passing is Mouse Davis, the creator of run 
and shoot football who serves the rising Detroit Lions as offensive coordinator 
under Coach Wayne Fontes. 
</P>
<P>
"You can trace almost every intercepted pass to one of three causes," Davis 
said from Detroit, where the Lions upset Cleveland Thanksgiving Day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's either a good defensive play, a bad pass, or the quarterback has misread 
the defense. 
</P>
<P>
"You can live with good defense. You can even live with bad passes. The only 
bad quarterbacks are the bad readers. 
</P>
<P>
"If Montana is the league's best quarterback, it's because he's one of the best 
readers in the game. He almost never throws a 'misread' interception." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco's success has spanned the 1980s under two coaches, Bill Walsh and 
his successor, George Seifert, and continues to defy the odds. At 10-2, the 
49ers are the NFC's top club, a game up on the 9-3 Giants, who are at least a 
game up on everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"It's surprising, I guess, but possible," said 49er Vice President John McVay. 
"You need two things. You have to have continuity without stagnation. And 
you've got to keep the focus on football. 
</P>
<P>
"We fight stagnation but keep continuity by keeping most -- but not all -- of 
our assistant coaches right along; and most -- but not all -- of our scouts. We 
make it a point to bring in new coaches every year or so and new scouts from 
time to time. And other new employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Continuity starts with a stable owner. We have that with Eddie DeBartolo -- 
who also helps us keep the focus on football. As Eddie says, marketing is 
vital, but peripheral. Cheerleaders are important, but peripheral. 
</P>
<P>
"We all get up every morning asking: How can we improve the football product?" 
</P>
<P>
Tom Landry, who coached the Dallas Cowboys for 29 years, let go before this 
season's failures, knows all about constancy in the proprietor's office. 
</P>
<P>
For 25 years, Landry worked for the same club owner, Clint Murchison. 
</P>
<P>
"What that does, it causes stability," Landry told Texas writers the other day. 
"Most pro football teams aren't stable at all, from that standpoint. 
(Murchison) took (the) pressure off. 
</P>
<P>
"When he sold the Cowboys in 1984, the pressure changed pretty quick." 
</P>
<P>
It's all in the record. In 1985, under new owners, the Cowboys had one more 
good year -- finishing 10-6 -- but since then they've gone 7-9, 7-8, 3-13 and, 
this season, 1-11. 
</P>
<P>
Their changing ownership structure isn't, of course, wholly responsible. Some 
critics point to these other explanations for the downfall of the Cowboys: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the final drafts of the Landry era, they put the emphasis on good 
athletes with good character instead of good football players. Continuing a 
trend that had worked well for them for a while, they began, perhaps, to 
over-value speed and good guys. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They didn't invariably keep the focus on Cowboy football. Their president, 
Tex Schramm, became the NFL's most powerful club executive, a time-consuming 
role. And there were other distractions. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the Cowboys might not have fallen if Murchison, an oilman who fell 
ill, had kept his health and his money. 
</P>
<P>
One More Thing Dept.: Depth remains the 49ers' secret weapon. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Giants aren't the team they were before they lost tight end Mark 
Bavaro, running back Joe Morris and -- in the second quarter Monday night -- 
linebacker Lawrence Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The 49ers have more successfully replaced their most devastating 1989 
losses: nose tackle Michael Carter, probably the NFL leader at his position, 
and safety Jeff Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
Chet Brooks may not be a Fuller, but he's close, and the 49ers brought in 
nine-year pro veteran Jim Burt to help Pete Kugler at Carter's position. 
</P>
<P>
It cost DeBartolo plenty to import Burt from the Giants and Matt Millen from 
the Raiders, but his club wouldn't be 10-2 without them. 
</P>
<P>
Millen is playing the role here that former Ram Jack Reynolds played for San 
Francisco's Super Bowl champions in 1981 -- when he was badly needed by the 
Rams, who in the 1980s have lost more talent than most clubs for financial 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
DeBartolo's emphasis is on winning, not profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he does have a problem. The 49ers, like the Rams, can't run against good 
defenses. Down the road, that could be costly. 
</P>
<P>
More ominous for the 49ers is the December schedule. Before and after the 
Ram-49er rematch at Anaheim Dec. 11, the Rams will meet three easy marks, 
Dallas, the New York Jets and New England. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers are scheduled against easy Atlanta and tough Buffalo and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, in the NFC West, nothing has been settled. Though at present the 8-4 Rams 
are two games behind the 49ers, January will belong to the team that wins in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
"The pro season isn't as long, really, as some people think," Viking President 
Mike Lynn said from Minneapolis. "For most teams, the last month is what 
counts. You win in December, you're in the playoffs. The NFL is a December 
league." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' Jim Everett conceivably rounded the corner to become the NFL's next 
great quarterback with his comeback win Sunday at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Braman, president of the Philadelphia Eagles, is among those who think 
so. 
</P>
<P>
From his office in Miami, Braman said: "Remember when Joe Montana threw those 
four fourth-quarter touchdown passes to beat us (38-28) in the third week of 
the season? Everett showed all that beauty Sunday night. He did it just the way 
Montana does it." 
</P>
<P>
Quote Dept.: Randall Cunningham, Philadelphia quarterback, on the injuries that 
have retarded the Eagles, whose problem is lack of depth: "I used to use (tight 
end) Keith Jackson to control the offense, and I used to use (wide receiver) 
Mike Quick for touchdowns." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Murphy, Tampa Bay linebacker, on dynasties: "Times change, and people 
change. Good players retire. Other teams start getting good players. You saw it 
happen to the Steelers and Cowboys. It happens to everybody." 
</P>
<P>
George Young, New York Giants' general manager: "We didn't lose the Eastern 
Division in Candlestick. (If) we beat Philadelphia (Sunday) and Dallas, we win 
the East."

MORNING BRIEFING: GRIFFITH: $32 MILLION TOO CHEAP FOR TWINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shirley Povich, reviewing "Calvin" in the the Washington Post, praises Jon 
Kerr's biography as "the complete definition of Calvin Griffith as a figure in 
the game and as a person." 
</P>
<P>
Povich writes: "For 30 years, Calvin Griffith offered major league baseball and 
its fans the picture of a club owner most singular -- born to the game, homely 
of speech, contemptuous of his peers and persevering with his mom-and-pop 
operation in the new era of baseball supermarkets." 
</P>
<P>
Griffith sold the Minnesota Twins in late August of 1984, when they had a 5 
1/2-game lead in the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
"That sale to Minneapolis banker Carl Pohlad later infuriated Griffith," Povich 
writes. "He said his mistake was to leave the final dealing to his nephew, 
Bruce Haynes, a novice at the business, and Howard Fox, his former assistant. 
Griffith says Haynes was outsmarted and Fox was too intimate with the buyer. 
The $32 million they got for the team wasn't much in light of the Orioles' sale 
four years later for $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Griffith also charges Pohlad didn't keep his promises with hirings and firings 
after promoting Fox to president. He later would recall that when he had to 
seek approval of the AL club owners for the team's transfer to Pohlad: "I had 
to make a speech to tell them what a great guy the (SOB) was." 
</P>
<P>
No drip dry: Members of the Lake Wales (Fla.) High School band spent most of 
Monday trying to blow-dry the plumes on their hats. They had to sit in a 
driving rain during the first half of the Miami Dolphin-Pittsburgh Steeler game 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the plumes fail to regain their splendor, but the dye from them 
bled onto the new uniform jackets. The uniforms had been bought recently for 
$40,000. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Nov. 29, 1890, Navy and Army met in football for the first 
time. Which team won? 
</P>
<P>
Best wishes: The latest in the feud between Jerry Glanville, coach of the 
Houston Oilers, and Chuck Noll, coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers: 
</P>
<P>
Glanville says he saw a newspaper headline last week that said "Knoll Fired." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'What a terrible time to fire Chuck, just before Thanksgiving.' 
Then I looked down through the article and saw it was the New Mexico State 
coach (Mike Knoll). So I had my hopes up a little bit there for Thanksgiving, 
but they dwindled." 
</P>
<P>
Throw it back: New Jersey Coach Bill Fitch, after watching the Nets set a 
franchise low for points in a 105-68 loss at Utah Monday: "I've always said 
that out of 82 games you can take a couple and throw them out. This was one of 
them. I sure as heck didn't give up golf and fishing to spend nights like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
No ear for fashion: Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson says he is so fond 
of new clothes that he buys apparel every day, according to an interview 
published in the December issue of Vogue. 
</P>
<P>
But although Tyson keeps up with the latest clothing fashions, he's not 
interested in one popular male fashion accessory -- earrings. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I would never do that," Tyson said. "I'm a man, and I know what my 
opinions are about that kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Joe must go: Former New York Jet Joe Klecko on the team's 3-9 record: "(Coach) 
Joe Walton has taken a potential Super Bowl team and run it into the ground 
since 1983. We had the potential to win it all as much as any team when he took 
it over from Walt Michaels." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Navy, 24-0.

The wild spending spree in baseball is a source of amazement to Don Drysdale, a 
Hall of Famer who held out for the grand sum of $115,000 in the spring of 1966 
after winning 23 games for the World Series champions the year before. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"You read about somebody signing for $2 million or $3 million a year and the 
next article is about a lockout or a strike," Drysdale said at the kickoff 
luncheon for the Dodger centennial celebration Tuesday. "It's beyond my 
comprehension." . . .

A GOOD OMEN FOR SUNDAY SILENCE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Will Sunday Silence return as good as ever from his surgery? Only time and 
Charlie Whittingham will tell. But the results of last Sunday's seventh race at 
Hollywood Park had to be encouraging for anyone who has ever had a horse with a 
bone chip removed from a knee. 
</P>
<P>
Crown Collection, a 3-year-old son of Alydar who made some strange headlines in 
the past year, ran for the first time since arthroscopic knee surgery last 
spring and won the six-furlong allowance race by nearly three lengths. 
</P>
<P>
The results were a pleasant surprise for the Wayne Lukas stable, since Crown 
Collection has never been known as a sprinter. Neither had he won a race in 
almost 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Greg Ferraro, who removed two chips from Sunday Silence's right knee two 
weeks ago, performed a similar operation on Crown Collection in March, after 
the colt's last-place finish in an allowance race at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, it was no great loss to racing. Crown Collection had won his first 
two races the previous August at Del Mar, but his subsequent record was 
peppered with crushing defeats. They included a ninth-place finish as part of 
the favored entry in the Del Mar Futurity and another ninth at 102-1 odds in 
the Florida Derby. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of his frustrating run of seven consecutive defeats, Crown 
Collection's name was linked to the alleged cocaine positives announced by the 
California Horse Racing Board last February. Supposedly, traces of the drug 
were found in the colt's frozen urine samples taken from his two Del Mar wins. 
</P>
<P>
But the racing board backed down when the California attorney general's office 
got a good look at the details of the case, along with independent lab reports 
that indicated the sample was clean. All charges were dropped, leaving the 
board embarrassed and its official lab open to lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Crown Collection, recuperating at owner Gene Klein's Rancho el Rayo, became a 
footnote in an unhappy chapter of local racing lore. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's back, apparently ready to pick up where he left off after those first 
two races. He's got a new owner, a new knee and turn of foot he never had 
before. 
</P>
<P>
"Last Sunday was the first time he ever showed that kind of speed in a race," 
said Jeff Lukas, Wayne's son and chief assistant who supervises Crown 
Collection at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The knee had to be bothering him in those last couple of races. And the time 
off did him good. He was always a big colt. Now he's stronger and more mature. 
We're planning to run him through the Strub Series at Santa Anita." 
</P>
<P>
Crown Collection was a $575,000 yearling purchase by Klein, who banked just 
$47,840 with the colt before putting him up for sale with the rest of his 
horses on Nov. 6 at Keeneland in Lexington, Ky. Crown Collection brought a 
final bid of $170,000 from William T. Young and Wayne Lukas himself. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's race was the first time Crown Collection had ever run as short a 
distance as six furlongs. His final time of 1:10 4/5 was accomplished over a 
fast but dull track. Earlier in the day, $10,000 claimers ran the same distance 
in 1:10 1/5, but times grew progressively slower as the cool afternoon wore on. 
</P>
<P>
The first stop in the Strub Series is the seven-furlong Malibu Stakes on Santa 
Anita's opening day, Dec. 26, followed by the 1 1/8-mile San Fernando Stakes on 
Jan. 14 and the 1 1/4-mile Charles H. Strub Stakes on Feb. 4. Crown Collection 
will have his hands full with the likes of Prized, Hawkster, Music Merci, 
Bruho, Mr. Bolg and Quiet American in those races. 
</P>
<P>
Crown Collection showed only two recent workouts beneath his past performance 
lines for last Sunday's comeback -- a pair of five-furlong drills on Nov. 13 
and 20 at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, when a horse has not raced within 30 days, the track stewards prefer 
to see at least three recent workouts recorded before allowing it to run. Crown 
Collection had not raced since March 26. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing is carved in stone. The stewards have the discretion to allow a 
horse to run as long as they are convinced it is fit and has been in steady 
training. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't particularly happy with the fact that (Crown Collection) showed 
only two works," said steward Pete Pedersen. "Our rule of thumb, however, is 
that we must be reasonably satisfied with the horse's condition based on what 
we can find out about his recent training." 
</P>
<P>
The stewards learned that Crown Collection had been working at the Wayne Lukas 
Training Center, just east of Del Mar, before he was shipped to Kentucky for 
the Klein sale. Though not an officially recognized training facility -- as are 
Galway Downs and San Luis Rey Downs -- the Lukas center has its own six-furlong 
track. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd had several good, solid mile works down there," Jeff Lukas said. "The 
sale interrupted his training only slightly." 
</P>
<P>
A total of $55.3 million was bet on this year's Breeders' Cup races at 149 
North American sites. Of that amount, $10.4 million was bet in California. 
</P>
<P>
Pretty impressive figures . . . until you digest the numbers coming out of the 
Japan Cup last Sunday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Amount wagered on the Japan Cup program: $222.7 million, or 32,073,472,400 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Amount bet on the Japan Cup alone: $136.5 million, or 19,662,099,200 yen. 
</P>
<P>
With Japan's extensive off-track betting network -- which includes telephone 
accounts and several huge off-track emporiums -- more than 80% of the wagers 
were placed away from Tokyo Race Course on the big day. 
</P>
<P>
At the recently concluded Oak Tree meeting at Santa Anita, the proportions were 
just the opposite: 81% of the handle was bet at the track and 19% was bet at 
off-track outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Everything is relative, though. The price of a steak dinner at the Keio Plaza 
Hotel, official Japan Cup headquarters: $100, and it wasn't even Kobe beef. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
After scratching Ruhlmann from the Citation Handicap last Sunday, Charlie 
Whittingham says the colt will probably run in the Native Diver Handicap at 
Hollywood on Dec. 23. "He's probably not the greatest turf horse in the world 
anyway," Whittingham said. "And when it rained the night before, the course 
came up just dead enough to give me second thoughts about running him." . . . 
Latest contribution to the top-10-horses-of-the-decade debate, in order: 
Spectacular Bid, John Henry, Alysheba, Precisionist, Sunday Silence, Easy Goer, 
Spend a Buck, Slew o' Gold, Perrault, Personal Ensign.

MAGIC COOLS OFF HEAT, 104-99

<TEXT>
<P>
If the Orlando Magic was looking for a way to impress Florida fans, the 
expansion club couldn't have done much better than it did Tuesday night at 
Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
The Magic christened its rivalry with Florida's other NBA team by defeating the 
Miami Heat, 104-99. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the victory gave the Magic a chance to finish November with a .500 
record, unheard of for a new club. 
</P>
<P>
Ever the realist, however, Orlando Coach Matt Guokas said: "It's the end of the 
first month's games and, although we're pleased with what we have accomplished, 
we can't pat ourselves on the back because we have a long way to go." Of the 
victory, he said: "It wasn't pretty on either team's part, but both teams 
played extremely hard, maybe so hard that nothing came smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Nick Anderson scored a career-high 24 points and keyed a fourth-quarter 
burst that brought Orlando (6-7) from behind. The Magic's last game this month 
is Thursday night at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves, the NBA's other 
first-year club. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, the Magic's first-round pick in the college draft, led an 18-5 run 
that turned a five-point deficit into a 94-86 lead with 5:09 remaining. 
Anderson scored nine points in the spurt and Sidney Green made two jump shots 
to hold off Miami in the last three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Miami, which has tried to downplay what Pat Williams, the Magic's general 
manager, has promoted as an budding rivalry, lost its fourth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Catledge led the Magic with 26 points after missing three games because 
of a sprained left thumb. Reggie Theus added 13 points for the Magic and Green 
had 11 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 92, Washington 91 -- Randolph Keys sank a short half-hook shot with 
three seconds left at Richfield, Ohio, capping Cleveland's rally from a 
16-point third-quarter deficit and ending a two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the Bullets' seventh straight on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers' injury-riddled starting lineup made only one of 15 shots in the 
first half as Washington built a 49-37 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets led, 53-37, early in the second half, 53-37, but Cleveland trailed 
by only seven after three quarters and scored the first 12 points of the fourth 
quarter for a five-point lead. Neither team led by more than five thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Washington led, 91-88, on a pair of free throws by John Williams with 1:01 to 
play. But the Cavaliers' John (Hot Rod) Williams sank two free throws with 43 
seconds left and Kerr got the ball back for the Cavaliers with six seconds to 
play. He called a timeout as he fell out of bounds while grabbing the rebound 
of a missed Washington shot. Keys then made the winning shot from the left 
baseline while surrounded by defenders. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard King's three-point shot for Washington at the buzzer hit the rim. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 93, Sacramento 81 -- Joe Dumars scored 12 of his 16 points in the 
fourth quarter, 10 on free throws, in leading the Pistons at Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Isiah Thomas added 14 points as seven Pistons scored in double figures. Danny 
Ainge topped Sacramento with 20 points and Rodney McCray had 15. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 117, Seattle 104 -- Terry Cummings scored 32 points for the Spurs 
and Willie Anderson had 11 of his 24 in the fourth quarter at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs led, 100-93, with 6:58 left, then pulled away with an 11-4 run that 
included technical fouls on Seattle Coach Bernie Bickerstaff and assistant Tom 
Newell. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Ellis scored 37 and Nate McMillian added 14 assists, 12 points and 11 
rebounds for Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 113, Atlanta 98 -- Michael Jordan scored only 22 points but he had 
eight assists as the hot-shooting Bulls won easily at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting 55% in the third quarter, after a 61% second, the Bulls twice built 
21-point leads, the second on Horace Grant's layup. The closest the Hawks got 
thereafter was when John Battle sank a 14-foot jump shot that cut the deficit 
to 70-58. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 141, Golden State 120 -- Walter Davis came off the Denver bench and 
scored 26 points, Fat Lever added 24 and Michael Adams 22 as the Nuggets 
rallied from a 16-point first-period deficit at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets led at halftime, 75-72, then broke the game open with third-period 
runs of 13-2 to begin the quarter and 15-0 late in the quarter.

LEMIEUX BOOED, PENGUINS LOSE, 6-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mario Lemieux heard boos in his home rink Tuesday night, which is a pretty good 
indication of how badly things are going for the Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins lost to the Philadelphia Flyers in the opener of a home-and-home 
series with their Patrick Division rivals, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the Penguins' third straight at home -- and some of the fans who 
remained booed when Lemieux touched the puck in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux had two assists to extend his point-scoring streak to a league-high 13 
games, but he had only two of Pittsburgh's 36 shots on goal and wasn't a factor 
in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It does have an effect," he said of the booing. "If I'm not playing well, 
they're allowed to boo, which they did tonight. All I can do is do my best to 
help the team. If that doesn't work, try something else." 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins hadn't played the Flyers since April, when Philadelphia put an end 
to their playoff dreams. 
</P>
<P>
And the Flyers picked up where they left off six months earlier, beating 
Pittsburgh on two goals each by Ilkka Sinisalo and Mark Howe and Mike Bullard's 
300th goal in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers scored four goals on 17 shots in the first period, chasing 
Pittsburgh goalie Wendell Young, who was starting his ninth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
Bullard broke a 1-1 tie with his milestone goal, his 12th of the season, on a 
power play at 9:44. He took Murray Craven's pass in the slot, held the puck and 
placed the shot over Young's shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get that much time, you can pick any corner you want," Bullard said. 
"Young went down so I went up high." 
</P>
<P>
Boston 5, St. Louis 1 -- Cam Neely extended his goal-scoring streak to a 
league-high eight games and Bobby Carpenter and Ken Linseman each scored twice 
at St. Louis as the Bruins picke up their eighth victory in their last nine 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins raised their record to 10-2-1 against teams outside the Adams 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Zezel scored for the Blues, whose six-game home unbeaten streak ended. 
St. Louis had been 4-0-2 in that stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter got his seventh and eighth goals for Boston. Neely, who started the 
game tied with seven players for the league lead in goals, got his 18th of the 
season at 4:34 of the second period to snap a 1-1 tie. His shot from the left 
circle, off a pass from Linseman, bounced off the stick of goaltender Vincent 
Riendeau, over Riendeau's head and into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 4, Hartford 2 -- Phil Housley and Christian Ruuttu had a goal and an 
assist apiece for Buffalo at Hartford, Conn., as the Sabres swept a 
home-and-home series against the Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
Housley, who got his 500th point with an assist in the first period, scored an 
insurance goal in the second. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 3, New York Islanders 2 -- John MacLean's goal at 3:30 of overtime 
gave the Devils their victory at East Rutherford, N.J., and extended the 
Islanders' losing streak to five games.

RUELAS BROTHERS WIN MAIN EVENTS; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING: COUNTRY CLUB IN RESEDA HOUSE FIGHTERS MAKE QUICK WORK OF OPPONENTS IN 
DEBUTS AS FEATURE PARTICIPANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The brothers Ruelas, the Ten Goose Boxing budding stars who appear to have long 
futures in professional boxing, made short work of two opponents in main event 
debuts Tuesday night at the Country Club in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Featherweight Rafael Ruelas knocked out Ricardo Flores in the first round with 
a crunching left hook. Then, after an intermission that was longer than both 
fights combined, junior-lightweight Gabriel Ruelas stopped Javier Macias at 
1:52 of the second round. 
</P>
<P>
It was quick, neat and impressive. Gabriel, 19, and his brother, Rafael, 18, 
earned $2,000 each for the quick victories. And their manager, Dan Goossen, 
said he plans to move Gabe up quickly to bigger paydays, starting with a 
network TV boxing show early in 1990, with Rafael soon to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel (18-0) the shorter but slightly stronger of the two, had Macias (12-5) 
in trouble and in full retreat by the end of the first round. He stunned Macias 
with a right hand midway through the first, but was late in following up, 
temporarily allowing Macias to escape. 
</P>
<P>
Ruelas dropped Macias on his back with a right hand that followed a set-up left 
jab, but Macias got up. Ruelas, weighing 127 1/2, was a bit wild and out of 
control trying to finish Macias, but he finally did so in a neutral corner. 
There, with Macias helpless, ringside physician Dr. Robert Karns, stood up and 
raised his arms, a signal for referee Robert Byrd to stop the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Ruelas, who is 12-0 with 10 knockouts, was tagged on the chin with the 
first punch of his fight, a sweeping left hook by Flores, who weighed 121 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
But Ruelas, who weighed 124 3/4, quickly established his left jab over his 
slower, shorter opponent, and Flores (15-7) wound down quickly in the last half 
of the round. The end came shortly after Ruelas rocked Flores with a left hook 
and left uppercut on the ropes. Fifteen seconds later, Ruelas got Flores with a 
right to the ribs, followed by a near-perfect left hook to the chin. 
</P>
<P>
Flores went down on his back, a clean knockout at 2:49 of the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Goossen said that the brothers may soon move out of their 900-seat home, the 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to get them both on a Forum card soon, then I'd like get get Gabe 
on a network (United States Boxing Assn.) or (North American Boxing Federation) 
title fight early in the year," Goossen said. 
</P>
<P>
On the undercard, Burbank heavyweight Rocky Pepeli knocked out Tyrone Armstrong 
of Las Vegas at 2:22 of the first round.

CONSUMER VIEWS: THE SO-CALLED 'ONE-ARMED BANDIT' CAN HOLD A MIGHTY HAUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL, Campbell is a syndicated columnist and former Times staff 
writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My husband and I have just come back from one of our frequent trips 
to Las Vegas. Both of us are impossible slot machine addicts. How many coins 
(dollars or quarters) does the average slot machine hold? They must have a 
fantastic capacity the way people like us pour money into them. 
</P>
<P>
Do they ever run out of coins? 
</P>
<P>
How come we never see anybody from the casino emptying them? How profitable are 
the slots to the casino, and is there any control over how much they have to 
pay out? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, if I wanted to buy one for my own use, how much would it cost? -- L. 
McA. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I'm sure you're not alone in your curiosity. The slots have had an 
almost hypnotic fascination for people since a Bavarian immigrant named Charles 
Fey -- a mechanic employed by an electric supply company in San Francisco -- 
tinkered around in his spare time and introduced the Liberty Bell (a nickel 
machine) in 1905. 
</P>
<P>
How much the average slot machine "holds" is an interesting question, because 
it's a little more complicated than it sounds. The payouts, according to Judy 
Sullivan, a public relations representative in Chicago for Bally Manufacturing 
Corp., one of the big three makers of slots, all come from a "hopper," or large 
tray, in the body of the machine -- naturally. 
</P>
<P>
And, while the capacity of the hoppers will vary, Sullivan said, the average $1 
machine will hold about 600 to 800 coins, and the average quarter machine will 
hold about 2,000. But, sure enough, the machines take in a whale of a lot more 
coins than that in the course of a day or night, so why aren't the coins 
squirting out the seams of the machines? 
</P>
<P>
Well, you probably thought that those heavy wooden stands on which every slot 
machine sits were there to elevate the machine to a comfortable playing level. 
Actually, the stands underneath the machines are more like small safes; they 
contain buckets into which the bulk of the coins go as you feed them in. And 
they do, indeed, have an impressive capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Does a slot ever go dry -- run completely out of coins? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, sure, it happens all the time," says Jack Deremer, a Bally sales 
representative in Las Vegas. "The hoppers all have a weight-activated sensor in 
them so that when the machine starts getting low, the incoming coins will be 
diverted directly into the hopper to build it back up instead of going into the 
stand. But, things happen, and the slots suddenly go dry. The floor man fixes 
it, pays the player what's owed him and that's all there is to it." 
</P>
<P>
And yes, obviously, the buckets under the machine have to be emptied 
periodically in spite of their capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally," Deremer said, "the casino will do this during the off-hours, 
sometime between 3 and 6 a.m. Some are emptied every day, others every other 
day, depending on how much play they get." 
</P>
<P>
How profitable are the slots? Oh boy! The casinos make more from slots than all 
other games combined. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll vary a lot, of course," Deremer said, "but a dollar machine in a good 
location -- where it gets pretty steady play all the time -- will net the house 
about $300 to $400 a day." 
</P>
<P>
That's profit, of course, and it is related to how many dollars are actually 
passing through the slot. 
</P>
<P>
How much does a slot cost? Well, they're pretty sophisticated and complex. If 
you walk in off the street to buy one, figure on spending "$4,200 to about 
$4,500," Deremer added. 
</P>
<P>
Getting back to profits, consider that aforementioned heavily played $1 machine 
that nets the house, on average, $350 a day. Even at full retail price 
($4,500), it will pay for itself in a hair under 13 days; in a year it has 
grossed $1.2 million and has returned a profit to the house of $127,750. 
</P>
<P>
And how seriously the casinos now regard the slots -- once dismissed as 
something appealing to little old ladies in tennis shoes with rolls of nickels 
in their purses -- can be seen in the recent upswing in slots appealing to the 
traditional "high rollers." 
</P>
<P>
Both $5 and $25 slots have become commonplace, "and a few of the casinos here 
in Las Vegas," Deremer said, "now have $100 and $500 slots." 
</P>
<P>
There is an edge of awe in his voice: "Can you imagine it -- playing a 
three-token, $500 machine? That's a $1,500 bet on one pull of the handle."

SCREEN STYLE: WINGING IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The movie: "Harlem Nights" 
</P>
<P>
The look: Gangster polish, circa 1938. Without relying on costume cliches, 
tough guys Eddie Murphy, Richard Pryor, Redd Foxx et al. move in a decadent 
world without appearing boorish. 
</P>
<P>
The costume designer: Joe I. Tompkins, two-time Emmy award winner for "Eleanor 
and Franklin" and "Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years." Other credits 
include "Swing Shift," "Betrayed," "Nuts," "The River," "Missing" and "True 
Confessions." 
</P>
<P>
The conflict: How to reinvent the gangster genre without regurgitating tired 
old fashion idioms. As Tomkins puts it, the characters "don't have to run 
around in black shirts and white ties" to identify their place and profession. 
</P>
<P>
The plan: Murphy, the film's executive producer, writer, director and star, 
told Tompkins he wanted the costumes to be not exactly understated, but "crisp 
and smart, glamorous and good to look at," says the designer. Consequently, the 
male characters, the real stars of this movie, rustle around in lush silk 
smoking jackets; broad-shouldered, slim-hipped suits and tuxedos; brocade 
tuxedo vests; perfectly cut cotton shirts, and handsome wide silk, faille and 
satin ties. But we're not talking Fred Astaire time. This isn't understated 
elegance; not with Eddie Murphy strutting in a snow white topcoat, white 
fedora, cream dinner jacket and diamond studs. The women characters, including 
Della Reese, Berlinda Tolbert and Jasmine Guy, are secondary. And their gowns 
are imaginative, especially the maribou-trimmed numbers, but not nearly as 
appealing as the menswear. 
</P>
<P>
The program: Tompkins had all the principals' clothes custom made, including 
suits, shirts, bow ties -- and it shows. Details are first rate. To wit, 
underneath it all, Tompkins put the male stars in silk lisle or cotton lisle 
socks, considered top of the line in the late '30s. He found them at Brooks 
Brothers. Men's jewelry, including collar pins, tie bars, studs and watch fobs, 
was found in local antique jewelry stores -- Repeat Performance in Los Angeles 
and Marion's Chest of Jewels in Hollywood in particular. Many of the '30s ties 
came from Tompkins' personal collection. For men's shoes, Tompkins maintains 
that Ralph Lauren makes the best wing tips around. 
</P>
<P>
The payoff: With New Year's Eve approaching, men in the audience can learn a 
few basics about formal wear at this movie. So much of the '30s look, 
especially the wing-collar shirts, are back in style today. Tompkins had all 
his shirts custom-made, but he says that after the film wrapped he discovered, 
too late, the "drop dead" wing-collar shirts made by Hugo Boss. And clip-on 
ties were verboten. One of the film's dressers was strictly responsible for 
hand-tying bow ties. According to Tompkins, the only cast member who could tie 
his own was Redd Foxx. BETTY GOODWIN

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: TEST WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT FEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Should children be afraid? How much do you know about normal and abnormal fears 
in children? Here's true-or-false test on this subject. 
</P>
<P>
1. -- A healthy child has no fears. 
</P>
<P>
2. -- The child who fears that every cold may turn into pneumonia is 
intelligent, not unhealthy. 
</P>
<P>
3. -- The young child's fears are basically the same today as they were in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
4. -- If a 7-, 8- or 9-year-old expresses a fear of strangers or robbers, 
parents should be concerned, because chances are this is an indication of 
neuroses. 
</P>
<P>
5. -- Parents can help reduce the level of a child's anxieties about almost any 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
6. -- If a child has fears, it may be an indication that he's less intelligent 
than the child without fears. 
</P>
<P>
7. -- Parents should protect their children but not worry them about so-called 
"bad" people who might take advantage of them. 
</P>
<P>
8. -- The greatest fears and worries of 15-year-olds center on whether or not 
their world will be destroyed by nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWERS: 
</P>
<P>
1. -- FALSE. Everyone needs to have some fears. Without them no one would 
survive, for we would take too many foolish risks that could destroy us. 
</P>
<P>
2. -- FALSE. This is an unrealistic fear that may be an early indication of 
hypochondria. This shows an excessive preoccupation with sickness and may be 
reflecting a parent's anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
3. -- TRUE. Children between the ages of 4 and 7 fear unknown things and bad 
things. 
</P>
<P>
4. -- FALSE. These are normal anxieties in children of that age, because 
they're more aware of things happening in the neighborhood and community. 
</P>
<P>
5. -- TRUE. They can do this by being calm and rational themselves and by 
talking about specific problems that concern the youngster. Children's fears 
often reflect their parents' anxiety levels. 
</P>
<P>
6. -- FALSE. Actually, a child who is fearful is apt to be more intelligent 
because he or she is more aware of the dangers in the world and the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
7. -- FALSE. Of course parents should protect their children, but part of the 
protection is to warn them that all strangers may not be nice. They should know 
how to protect themselves from sexual abuse just as they should know about the 
importance of obeying traffic rules. 
</P>
<P>
8. -- FALSE. Probably the biggest fear and anxiety of 15-year-olds is related 
to sex. By this age, many children have been pressured by peers either to have 
or not to have sex. Those who do may feel guilty and fearful of the 
consequences, and those who don't may worry about being liked by peers and 
being considered "normal." 
</P>
<P>
If you answered six questions correctly, you're better informed than most on 
this subject.

A COTTONSEED ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I've gotten into the habit of reading labels on food products, not 
because I'm trying to avoid sugar or salt or cholesterol, but because I'm 
worried about having an allergy attack. 
</P>
<P>
I've been told that I'm allergic to cottonseed and that I should be careful of 
this, particularly when I buy candy. What puzzles me is that I've used 
cottonseed oil, and it has never caused me any problems. Why can I use the oil 
but not the meal? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Cottonseed meal can produce an allergic reaction in susceptible 
individuals. The product does not appear to be widely used, but it can be found 
in candy and baked goods. However, cottonseed oil does not affect people the 
same way, even those who are sensitive to the seeds.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC / THOMAS K. ARNOLD: A LOT OF GOOD SOUNDS GO 
UNNOTICED IN SAN DIEGO

Let's take a moment to spotlight some of the San Diego pop music scene's 
best-kept secrets -- weekly events that are musically enriching but generally 
draw sparse crowds because of a lack of exposure: 
</P>
<P>
* The "Sunday Night Blues Jam" at Winston's Beach Club in Ocean Beach. Close 
your eyes and pretend you're in some Kansas City roadhouse. Up to a dozen local 
blues musicians engage in a spirited free-for-all, tearing up the house with 
sizzling interpretations of classics like "Little Red Rooster," "Mannish Boy" 
and "The Thrill is Gone." 
</P>
<P>
* Jack Tempchin's Monday night gigs at the Casbah in Middletown. Accompanying 
himself on guitar, the local singer-songwriter performs mostly originals, many 
of which you're bound to recognize. Among them: "Peaceful Easy Feeling" and 
"Already Gone," big hits for the Eagles in the early 1970s; "Slow Dancing," a 
minor hit in 1976 for Tempchin and his own band, the Funky Kings, and a major 
smash a year later for Johnny Rivers; and several more recent chart-busters 
Tempchin penned for ex-Eagle Glenn Frey, including "Smuggler's Blues," "You 
Belong to the City," and "I Found Somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Alternating sets with Tempchin are two other local singer-songwriters: country 
traditionalist Robert Savery and Candye Kane, sure to evoke memories of the 
late Patsy Cline. 
</P>
<P>
* Tom (Cat) Courtney's Thursday-night appearances at the Texas Teahouse in 
Ocean Beach. The veteran bluesman has been playing at this tiny beach-area dive 
for 17 years. Before that, he toured and recorded with such blues legends as 
Lightnin' Hopkins, T-Bone Walker and Jimmy Reed. 
</P>
<P>
Courtney consistently refuses offers to play elsewhere on other nights. He's 
got a full-time job -- as fry cook at the Stardust Hotel and Country Club in 
Mission Valley, working the graveyard shift. 
</P>
<P>
* Open Mike Night, every Tuesday at the Spirit in Bay Park. Local wanna-be's 
take the stage and perform a song or two; alumni include punk-rock bands, folk 
groups and even a country fiddler. "We've also had comedians, jugglers, and 
poets -- anybody off the street who thinks they have something to offer," said 
Spirit owner Jerry Herrera. "It doesn't matter how good they are; it all turns 
into fun." 
</P>
<P>
* The Wednesday night "Original Music Showcase" at Rio's in Loma Portal. Three 
or four local bands are featured each week, performing hourlong sets of their 
own material. Talent coordinator Buddy Blue doesn't care whether they play 
punk-rock, heavy metal, reggae or whatever else -- just as long as they don't 
do any (ugh!) covers. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's appearance at Winston's Beach Club by the recently resurrected Iron 
Butterfly is something of a homecoming. The much-maligned heavy metal 
progenitors, best remembered for the 1968 mega-hit, "In-a-Gadda-Da-Vida," began 
life in San Diego two years earlier as the Palace Pages, the house band at the 
long-defunct Palace nightclub on Frontier Street (now Sports Arena Boulevard). 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Herrera, who owned the Palace (and who now owns another club, the 
Spirit), remembers them well. 
</P>
<P>
"When I hired them, they were a soul-psychedelic band," he said. "They took the 
old soul sound from, say, Otis Redding and James Brown, and then added the 
freaky psychedelic music, with lots of feedback, that was just starting to get 
popular up in San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, Herrera added, the Palace Pages continued in that vein, 
cultivating an interracial following that routinely packed the place, night 
after night. 
</P>
<P>
"They appealed as much to blacks as they did to whites," Herrera recalled. 
"And, let me tell you, they really sounded good -- they combined the best of 
rhythm-and-blues with the best of psychedelic rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
The Palace Pages' metamorphosis into what Lillian Roxon's Rock Encyclopedia 
calls "the original heavy metal Cro-Magnons" came after they moved to Los 
Angeles in 1967 and changed their name to Iron Butterfly, Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think after they left San Diego, they sort of became part of the scene that 
was happening up there," he said. "They got into a completely different groove 
and just fell into it." 
</P>
<P>
This stylistic change may have put Iron Butterfly on the fast track to 
commercial success, but Herrera didn't like it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard their (second) album, I was really disappointed," he recalled. 
"It made them really big, but the music wasn't very good at all. I knew they 
were capable of doing so much more." 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: Club of Rome, one of San Diego's most promising original-music 
bands, will perform a two-hour concert of acoustic and experimental music 
Saturday night at the Sonic Arts Gallery downtown. The band will play acoustic 
versions of the six songs on its recently released debut album, "New World 
Coming," as well as new tunes reflecting chief songwriter Steve Saint's growing 
interest in ethnomusicology. Band members will be backed by an assortment of 
guest musicians, including a flutist, a sitarist and a tabla player. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 14 heavy metal concert by Badlands and D.A.D. has been moved from the 
Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa to Iguanas in Tijuana. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Exactly 22 years ago this week, San Diego pop quintet Gary Puckett and the 
Union Gap made their first-ever appearance on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart 
with "Woman, Woman." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: Former X singer Exene Cervenka and the 
Walking Wounded, tonight at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach; the Blasters, 
Thursday at the Belly Up; Spirit, Friday at Winston's Beach Club; the Meat 
Puppets, also Friday, at San Diego State University's Backdoor; Third World, 
Saturday at the California Theater downtown, and Ronnie Montrose, also 
Saturday, at the Bacchanal.

JAZZ NOTES: ED SHAUGHNESSY JUST WHAT DOC ORDERED; BON APPETIT BENEFIT FOR AIDS 
HOSPICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ed Shaughnessy got his start as a small-group drummer in New York in the 
mid-to-late '50s, but it's as the rhythmic helmsman of Doc Severinsen's 
"Tonight Show" orchestra that he is best known. "I guess you could say I was a 
be-bop drummer that developed into a big-band drummer," Shaughnessy said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to learn a few different things for big-band drumming. With a big 
band, you have to provide more of that solid rhythmic core, whereas in a small 
group you have a lot more room and freedom to experiment with the time." 
</P>
<P>
Shaughnessy gets to delve into his experimental side when he leads his quintet 
tonight through Saturday at St. Mark's in Venice. Though the band -- Tom 
Peterson, reeds; Bruce Paulson, trombone; Tom Ranier, piano; and John Leitham, 
bass -- hasn't played that much locally, they work out of town occasionally, as 
on a recent jazz cruise on the Seaward, which is the sister ship of the Norway. 
</P>
<P>
"We played opposite (alto saxophonist) Phil Woods," the drummer said. "It was 
both nice to hear Phil and to feel that we held our own against him. He joked 
that since he has (trombonist) Hal Crook in the front line, and I have Bruce, 
that we're single-handedly bringing back the ''bone.' There aren't that many 
groups that use the trombone." 
</P>
<P>
Shaughnessy, 60, describes his quintet as a "1980s acoustic jazz group, in that 
we're trying to play music of the '80s but with a lot of traditions of acoustic 
groups of the past, and with a lot of elasticity and freedom in rhythm section. 
Sometimes we'll play without the drums, sometimes just go with drums and horn, 
we do different things." 
</P>
<P>
Big bands are still dear to the drummer's heart. His work in the large ensemble 
arena is represented on two recent releases, "Doc Severinsen and the Tonight 
Show Band, Volume 2" (Amherst) and "Big Band Hit Parade," with Gerry Mulligan, 
Dave Brubeck, Eddie Daniels, et al., in the company of the Cincinnati Pops 
Orchestra, directed by Erich Kunzel. 
</P>
<P>
Shaughnessy has been making big-band records for a few decades and a handful of 
'50s sessions he did with the late Count Basie on the Command and Roulette 
labels bring forth fond memories. "Those dates I'm really proud of," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Keyboardist Dan Siegel, singers Mark Winkler and Julie Kelly, guitarists Carl 
Verheyen and Richard Smith and bassist Brain Bromberg are among those who will 
take part in a double birthday party at Bon Appetit in Westwood, Monday at 8 
p.m., that benefits the Chris Brownlie AIDS Hospice in Los Angeles. The hospice 
is a 25-bed facility that "aims to offer quality care to persons in the last 
stages of the disease," said Hywel Sims, a spokesperson for AIDS Hospice 
Foundation, a hospice umbrella organization. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be kind of a giant jam session. We invited some of our musician 
friends to play, and everyone thought it was a neat idea," said Ellen Cohn, 
vice president of the Chase Music Group label, who shares the birthday honors 
with her friend, Geri Nelsen, a saleswoman for Navarre Corp., a West Coast 
independent record distributor. 
</P>
<P>
"We picked the Brownlie Hospice because a lot of people are raising money for 
research projects, but not often enough for the people who are suffering," said 
Cohn. "We wanted to do something for people who have the disease, to help make 
their lives as comfortable as possible up until the end." 
</P>
<P>
The requested donation is $12. Those unable to attend may donate funds through 
AIDS Hospice Foundation, 1800 N. Argyle St., Suite 301, Los Angeles 90028. 
Information: (213) 208-3830, 462-2273.

**** Trumpeter-arranger Jerry Gonzalez's "Rumba Para Monk" (Sunnyside) is a 
collection of eight classics by Thelonious Monk -- most bearing a Latin tinge 
-- that shows how adaptable the great man's songs are. For though the Monk 
sound isn't here in these well-crafted quintet treatments by the leader, the 
essential vibrant flavor of his music is. "Bye Ya" and "Jackie-ing" are 
accompanied by a steady, cheery Latin rhythmic babble, while "Nutty" sashays 
between Latin and straight-ahead time and features a restrained solo from 
pianist Larry Willis that has more than a few sparkling corners. "Reflections" 
(a soothing meringue, with sax man Carter Jefferson softly speaking), "Monk's 
Mood" and "Ugly Beauty," the latter two done as the pure jazz ballads they are, 
all spotlight the leader's appealing melodic improvisatory nature.

Basinger Case Takes a Twist: There are probably a few Hollywood celebrities 
with more than a casual interest in the divorce case of sultry Kim Basinger, 
one of the hottest stars of the past few years, and her soon-to-be ex-husband, 
Ron Britton. The two start negotiations next week leading to a divorce 
agreement, and the New York Daily News reports that Britton is threatening to 
take the case to trial, where he says he will name men romantically involved 
with his wife if Basinger does not give him a multimillion-dollar settlement. 
Basinger, who has never been shy about her life style, has been linked with 
"Batman" co-star Michael Keaton, producer Jon Peters and rock star Prince, 
among others. DANIEL CERONE

Beatles Watch: There was no Beatles reunion at the Forum Monday night, despite 
Paul McCartney's suggestion at an afternoon press conference that he'd be 
receptive to getting together with George Harrison and Ringo Starr. Harrison 
was in town but not at McCartney's third night at the Forum. Before McCartney's 
press conference, Harrison had told Musician magazine's Mark Rowland that at 
this time he has "no relationship" with his former bandmate. But there was a 
surprise guest appearance for McCartney fans Monday: Stevie Wonder came onstage 
for a duet of "Ebony and Ivory," which he wrote and recorded with McCartney.

A LOOK AT THE 'CRISIS' WITH OUR ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stop me if you've heard this before . . . didja hear the one about the hole in 
the ozone layer? Oh, well, what about the one about the danger of global 
warming? Oh, that too? Well, maybe the one about the perils of air pollution? 
</P>
<P>
"Crisis in the Atmosphere" -- a comprehensive look at the major environmental 
threats our planet faces -- covers all of these areas and more. But despite its 
overall excellence, the program seems a little flat, a victim of the 
I've-seen-this-somewhere-before syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
That's too bad, because this "Infinite Voyage" segment airing at 8 tonight on 
Channels 28 and 15, and at 9 on Channels 50 and 24, is definitely worth a look. 
Producer-writer Lionel Friedberg delivers a well-written, well-illustrated look 
at the ecological mess we've gotten ourselves into. 
</P>
<P>
"Crisis" manages to avoid a strident tone, offering a neat balancing act 
focusing on what one scientist calls the "spectrum of opinion in between the 
extremes" -- those who believe it is already too late and those who believe 
there is no problem in the first place. Segments include a look at a Swiss 
laboratory charting atmospheric carbon dioxide build-up, a Colorado lab where 
computers project global warming's effect on the weather, and an overview of 
the work of the scientist who sounded the alarm about chlorofluorocarbons 
destroying the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
Of particular interest is the segment on the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District's 20-year plan to reduce the sources of what sadly has become Los 
Angeles' most visible features: smog. "Crisis" graphically illustrates the 
problem and delineates the proposed solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"Crisis" offers other solutions, ranging from reducing fossil fuel use to 
controlling population growth -- issues that most politicians do their best to 
avoid. "Crisis' " reasonable approach and measured tone can do much to advance 
the environmental cause. MARTIN ZIMMERMAN

VISTA TAKES ROUND 1 IN BID FOR NEW COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $100-million expansion of the North County courthouse complex in Vista was 
recommended Tuesday over construction of a second courthouse in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido plans to fight the recommendation when it goes before the county 
Board of Supervisors next week. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Hickey, chief county administrative officer, endorsed the opinion of a 
special advisory committee that Vista's bid for the court expansion project 
made more financial sense than Escondido's, even though the Escondido proposal 
offered about $10 million in "up-front" funds, while the Vista proposal offered 
none. 
</P>
<P>
North County court and jail facilities are located in Vista. The court 
evaluation committee, composed of county technical staff, recommended expansion 
at the present site to avoid the "bifurcation" of courts, which would require 
transporting prisoners from the Vista complex to court appearances in 
Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
Hickey said the Vista proposition met the requirements of the county bid 
proposal, offering to provide a 51-courtroom facility and adequate surface 
parking, while the Escondido proposal offered a scaled-down 22-court complex 
with an adjacent parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
The cities see the courthouse facility as a way to draw related professional 
and commercial businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Judge Victor Ramirez said Tuesday that North County municipal 
judges unanimously support the Vista complex expansion. Superior Court judges 
will be polled on the recommendation Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Vista's offer includes using a six-acre parcel adjacent to the present county 
courthouse complex for surface parking, thus avoiding the expense of building a 
parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the committee report states, $700,000 to $800,000 would be saved 
annually because inmates would not need to be transported from the Vista jail 
to courts located in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
Although Vista offers no up-front funds to cover the planning and design of the 
expansion, the committee noted that county-owned land in Escondido -- Deer 
Park, which now is used to house California Conservation Corps volunteers -- 
could be sold for about $2.4 million to finance the court expansion in either 
location. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Lounsbery, a former Escondido city attorney and now spokesman for the 
Escondido courthouse bid, called the committee recommendation for a Vista 
location, "an endorsement of yet another indefinite delay in construction of 
much-needed North County courts." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Vista proposal depends on financing from the half-cent sales tax 
approved by county voters last year to fund court and jail expansion. Those 
funds, he said, have been frozen ever since a Riverside County judge overturned 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Lounsbery argued that the project could be delayed for up to five years until a 
final decision on use of the sales-tax funds is made, probably by the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"It is inconceivable to me that county staff believes construction (on the 
courthouse expansion) can begin without funding," Lounsbery said. Escondido has 
proposed construction of a 22-courtroom complex within its civic center 
development at Broadway and East Valley Parkway. The city, along with Lusardi 
Construction Co., offered $10 million toward their scaled-down, and less 
expensive, $32.5 million facility. 
</P>
<P>
In its proposal, Escondido offered to buy the Deer Park property from the 
county to provide immediate funds for the courthouse development. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Campbell, economic development director for the city of Vista, said that 
the funds from the county-owned Deer Park sale and property taxes due the 
county from Escondido's and other cities' redevelopment efforts could be used 
to begin immediate planning for expansion of the courts at the Vista location. 
</P>
<P>
Long-term financing could be handled by issuing bonds through a joint-powers 
authority formed for that purpose, Campbell said, and would not be delayed 
until the outcome of the sales-tax suit in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell stressed that nine to 11 courtrooms with support facilities could be 
available in the near future under the Vista proposal. A 2,000-car parking lot 
also could be provided on the 6-acre parcel that the city of Vista, which 
partially owns the land, has offered to acquire, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He conceded that the proposed $104-million Vista courthouse proposal could not 
be completed without an affirmative outcome for the use of sales-tax funds, but 
stressed that temporary portable courtrooms, lease of nearby office space for 
auxiliary services, and other interim measures could resolve the present 
overcrowding at the Vista facility until the sales-tax suit is settled. 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors have scheduled a 10:30 a.m. hearing Tuesday to hear 
arguments from the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor John MacDonald, whose district includes most of the North County 
judicial district, was unavailable for comment because of a personal emergency. 
His chief aide, Nancy Allen, said he is expected to have a statement on the 
issue after he has reviewed the committee report.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: AN 18-HOLE COURSE IN THE GOOD LIFE WITH THE SHAKESPEARE OF 
GOLF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a golden winter afternoon in North County. The good life is all around 
me. 
</P>
<P>
I am talking golf with Arnold Palmer. I am in heaven. 
</P>
<P>
This is how it must have felt to discuss iambic pentameter with Shakespeare. I 
have fantasized about meeting Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"Arnie, what club do you use if you have a 175-yard approach shot over water, 
to a green surrounded by sand?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Myself, I use a 7-iron, test for wind direction and then let it drift gently 
right to left, coming in slightly pin-high. How about you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually a 4-iron. If that doesn't work, I just pick the sucker up and throw 
it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Palmer is the guest of honor at a wine-and-cheese reception put on by the 
developers of Aviara, the 1,000-acre residential and resort development under 
way in Carlsbad. It's the former Hunt Brothers project, overlooking Batiquitos 
Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer's firm designed Aviara's 18-hole golf course, set to open next November. 
If you believe Palmer himself did the heavy lifting, you also believe Joe 
DiMaggio does the cooking at his restaurant in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The golf course was a major inducement for the Carlsbad City Council to approve 
the overall project. In a slow-growth world, golf courses have emerged as one 
of the few politically popular land uses. 
</P>
<P>
And not a moment too soon. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Places Rated Almanac gave San Diego County a lowly "C" for the quality 
and quantity of its golf courses but a "B" for its bowling alleys. I ask you: 
Would you rather live in a place known for its golf courses or its bowling 
alleys? 
</P>
<P>
Have you ever heard of any upscale male bonding accomplished at a bowling 
alley? Any important business deal consummated during Moonlight Lanes? 
</P>
<P>
Luckily our public servants have responded to the backswing of our discontent. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors is allowing country club courses in the pristine San 
Dieguito River Valley. Carlsbad hiked the hotel-motel tax to finance two 
municipal courses, one full size, one pitch-and-putt. 
</P>
<P>
The councils in Escondido and San Diego just approved a controversial land swap 
so a course can be built near Lake Hodges. Oceanside is even trying to 
eradicate the snakes on the back nine of its muni course. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the environmentalists carp about the profligate use of water and 
pesticides at many courses and damage to the habitat of the black-tailed 
gnatcatcher and the like. A friend of mine calls these people enviro-fascists. 
</P>
<P>
But there is just something about golf courses that politicians like. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad Mayor Bud Lewis asks Palmer to autograph an Aviara golf visor. So does 
Councilwoman Ann Kulchin. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my husband's Christmas present," she says. 
</P>
<P>
I could tell you all the things that Arnie told me about curing my slice and 
avoiding those three-putts. I could but I won't. 
</P>
<P>
Check your Elizabethan history books. You won't find a lot of guys who wrote 
memoirs about their private discussions with the Bard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Group Rates Political Pet Peeves

SON PLEADS GUILTY TO KILLING MOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Thomas Hayhurst was harangued incessantly by his 74-year-old mother and finally 
exploded in anger, killing her with crowbar blows to the head after she accused 
him of stealing her walking stick, his attorney said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"She got in his face and the next thing he knew, he was striking her with the 
closest thing he could grab -- a crowbar," defense attorney John Jimenez said 
after his client pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in Vista Municipal 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Hayhurst, 41, will be sentenced Dec. 28 and faces a sentence of 15 years to 
life in prison. He will be eligible for parole in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, 74-year-old Violet Hayhurst, was an imperious, stubborn matriarch 
who ruled with an iron hand and had won the scorn of even some of her closest 
friends, according to those who knew her and who expressed sympathy for the son 
after the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband committed suicide in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Hayhurst, a slightly built man with his hair in a pony tail, spoke 
softly Tuesday as he admitted his guilt in Judge Michael Burley's courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you intentionally kill Violet Hayhurst without provocation and 
premeditation?" Jimenez asked his client. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Hayhurst answered. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you plead?" Burley asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Guilty," Hayhurst replied. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Greg Walden said he accepted the plea from Hayhurst because 
there was no indication of premeditation on Hayhurst's part, but said he could 
not accept a lesser plea, such as manslaughter, because there was no legal 
provocation for the brutal killing. 
</P>
<P>
Even Walden acknowledged that Violet Hayhurst apparently drove her son to the 
killing with her "constant diatribes," but said her temperament "didn't warrant 
the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Hayhurst had most recently lived in Arizona but, after his mother 
suffered serious injuries in an auto accident last December, moved back home to 
Escondido so that he could help care for her and his sister, Ann, 30, who has a 
developmental disability, Jimenez said. 
</P>
<P>
The son lived in his van in the driveway, and was allowed in the home by his 
mother only to use the bathroom and to have occasional access to the kitchen, 
Walden said.

ALLEGED DEPROGRAMMING TARGET TESTIFIES CAPTORS HURT HER

Ginger Brown told a Vista Superior Court jury Tuesday of injuries she said were 
suffered at the hands of her father and others in their alleged kidnaping and 
deprogramming attempt, but defense attorneys branded her testimony and behavior 
on the witness stand as rehearsed and phony. 
</P>
<P>
During her daylong testimony, Brown, 24, said her father, Earle Brown, forcibly 
held her on the floor of a getaway van after the abduction and later threatened 
to break her leg if she didn't cooperate with their efforts to get her to 
renounce her affiliation to the group known as Great Among the Nations. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Ginger, you know me. . . . You know I can break your legs," she told 
the jurors, crying. "He grabbed it, squeezed it. Then a guy said, 'Earl, don't 
do it,' and he let go." 
</P>
<P>
Breaking into sobs, she added, "And I think my mom was watching." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, when asked to estimate the speed at which the van was driven after she 
was taken, she began to cry and said, "'Very fast." 
</P>
<P>
The show of emotion was ridiculed later by her father's attorney, Saul Wright. 
</P>
<P>
"Her crying is turned on and off at the wrong times," Wright said outside the 
courtroom. "It's a master performance, almost like she has a script of when 
she's supposed to cry -- but that she slipped up once and so she cried later to 
make up for it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the greatest rehearsal of testimony I've ever seen," Wright said. "I 
was following along by reading the transcripts from her preliminary hearing, 
and she was responding exactly the same, word for word. I've never seen 
anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
While her sister testified, Holly Brown -- another of the five defendants -- 
wrote "phony crying" and "she's lying" on her note pad, and shook her head from 
side to side during some of the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said he will eventually call Earle Brown to the witness stand to explain 
the deprogramming efforts in his own words -- testimony, Wright said, that 
Ginger Brown inflicted injuries on herself "by battering herself against the 
wall" of the house where she was held in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
The defense claims that Ginger Brown baited her parents to kidnap her so she 
could then sue them for monetary damages to help finance Great Among the 
Nations, which critics say is a cult led by Benjamin Altschul, who leads a 
comfortable life style in Coronado financed by the so-called love offerings of 
his 17 followers. 
</P>
<P>
Altschul and group members say Great Among the Nations is a fundamental 
Christian Bible study group and evangelism ministry. 
</P>
<P>
During her testimony and with the aid of color photographs, Brown described 
various injuries she said she received during the abduction and her five days 
in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
The photographs showed bruises to her head and hip as well as cuts and 
abrasions to her knee, calf and feet. 
</P>
<P>
She said she was unable to fend off her abductor, a man she identified by name 
as Steve Bronc who has not been arrested, who grabbed her as she was trying to 
get into her car after work May 12 outside an Encinitas real estate office. 
</P>
<P>
"I screamed and I ran," she said. "It was a horror scream, a terror scream. I 
never heard my voice sound like that." 
</P>
<P>
She was hit on the jaw and ended up on the floor of the getaway van. She next 
remembered her father on one side of her, holding her down on the van's floor. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad was squeezing on me. He bent my thumb back very hard. He was speaking 
-- but not to me. He said, 'Gosh, she's strong. It's hard to hold her.' " 
</P>
<P>
At another time, she said, her father hit her across the face with his fist, 
and she responded by biting her father on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Someone else in the van grabbed her hair and pounded her head on the floor four 
times, she said. Brown was taken to the Escondido home of Hank Erler, another 
defendant, where she was confronted by Cliff Daniels, the fifth defendant and a 
self-described deprogrammer. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted me to agree with him that the lies he was saying about the church 
were real," Brown said. "He wanted me to renounce my faith and join his team." 
</P>
<P>
The five defendants -- Earle Brown; his wife, Dorothy; their daughter, Holly; 
Erler and Daniels -- are charged with kidnaping, false imprisonment and battery 
during the first phase of the trial. Later, they will be tried in front of the 
same jury on related conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
Cross-examination of Ginger Brown is expected to begin today. Thursday, defense 
attorneys will privately view videotapes of Brown made by fellow group members 
after the incident. Trial testimony will resume next Wednesday.

AIR FORCE SAYS BILL THREATENS SOME TEST FLIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
DESERT CONSERVATION: MILITARY OFFICIALS SEEK TO ALLAY BUSINESSES' FEARS THAT 
PROPOSED RESTRICTIONS MIGHT FORCE EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE TO MOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Air Force officials told Antelope Valley business people Tuesday that a desert 
preservation bill pending in Congress could hamper low-altitude flights from 
Edwards Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
However, they rejected local speculation that the base might be forced to move. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed California desert protection act, sponsored by Sen. Alan Cranston 
(D-Calif.), would give about 7.5 million acres of desert, mostly in Southern 
California, either wilderness or parkland status. The land would include tracts 
under the 20,000-square-mile area of airspace used by Edwards Air Force Base 
and other military bases. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston and environmental groups supporting his legislation contend that the 
bill does not attempt to restrict military use of airspace over the desert. But 
Air Force officials argued that language in the bill could be interpreted to do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably would preclude us from being able to meet our mission," said 
Robert Johnstone, chief of the plans and policies division at Edwards' Air 
Force Flight Test Center. The 300,000-acre base in southern Kern County is 
where most of the Air Force's advanced aircraft are designed and tested. 
</P>
<P>
Johnstone's warning came during a forum on the dispute held in Lancaster before 
a group of Antelope Valley business leaders. Edwards is the single biggest 
economic force in the high desert region. It employs about 14,000 people and 
has an estimated regional monetary impact of $1.1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
Business leaders from nearby Lancaster and Palmdale in northern Los Angeles 
County came to the session believing that the Air Force might move the base if 
Cranston's legislation passed. But Johnstone and other Air Force officials said 
the talk of moving was the result of a misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I don't have my suitcases packed," Johnstone said. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force likes its 20,000-square-mile restricted flight area between 
Edwards and the town of Bishop to the north because it is sparsely populated 
and has a diversity of terrain suited for combat flight testing. Many flights 
are done at low altitudes, under 3,000 feet, to simulate avoiding enemy radar. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the desert dispute is language in Cranston's bill that specifically 
allows low-level military flights over the desert areas, provided they are "in 
approximately the same location and degree as existed prior to the enactment of 
this act." 
</P>
<P>
His bill was originally silent on the subject, but military officials wanted 
the added language, and Cranston obliged. The military says the new language 
could hamper it by preventing testing that is different from what's done now. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say they want some conditions in the bill to prevent the Air 
Force operations at Edwards from expanding from the current testing mode into a 
broader training operation. There are already 90,000 aircraft sorties a year in 
the military airspace, Johnstone said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Dodson, the base's budget officer who also is a director of the California 
Desert Protection League, an environmental group backing Cranston's bill, said 
preservationists are not bothered by the current flights. He said his group is 
satisfied with the bill.

NO RISKS FOUND AT ROCKWELL LAB BUT MORE TESTS SOUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
RADIATION TESTING: AN EPA REPORT ON CHECKS MADE IN JULY AT THE SANTA SUSANA 
SITE DISCLOSES THAT ONLY SIX SAMPLES WERE TAKEN AT THE 290-ACRE SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that soil and ground 
water tests show the Santa Susana Field Laboratory west of Chatsworth presents 
"no public health risk from radiation at this time." 
</P>
<P>
The agency gave that assessment in releasing a report on soil and water 
sampling done last July at the Rockwell International nuclear research site in 
the Simi Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"From the levels of contamination detected and their location, it is doubtful 
that contamination has spread off-site," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
But EPA officials were backpedaling slightly by the end of the day and 
predicting that there will be more tests, in part because they failed to test 
one area of known contamination. 
</P>
<P>
The main findings in the report -- the discovery of low levels of radioactive 
tritium in a ground water sample and cesium-137 in soil samples -- had been 
disclosed by EPA officials in September. 
</P>
<P>
But the report revealed for the first time that the July tests were limited to 
only six soil and water samples on the entire 290 acres at Santa Susana that 
have been used for nuclear work. 
</P>
<P>
The author of the report, Gregg Dempsey, chief of field studies for the EPA's 
radiation programs office in Las Vegas, acknowledged the sampling was limited. 
He said the agency was under a "pretty heavy time constraint" to get data on 
potential hot spots to see "if there was an immediate problem." 
</P>
<P>
But one of these areas, called the radioactive materials disposal facility, was 
not sampled due to a communication mix-up and will probably have to be checked 
on a follow-up visit, another EPA official said late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
And Dempsey said he has proposed to EPA regional officials in San Francisco 
that they fund a more complete study, involving more tests of soil, water and 
vegetation samples. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're going to find anything in any of these other areas," he 
said, but "you have to be thorough." 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell officials refused to answer questions. But in a prepared statement, 
they said the report confirmed their contentions that "only very minor amounts 
of low level contamination are present in the soil and water . . . and that 
there is no evidence of it migrating off-site." 
</P>
<P>
The cesium-137 was found in soil near Building 64, where contaminated soil was 
being cleaned up at the time of the EPA visit. Dempsey said the cesium levels 
were far above amounts deposited by fallout from atomic weapons tests, but far 
below hazard level. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Susana lab was once a flourishing nuclear research site with as many 
as 16 nuclear reactors, where atomic fuel fabrication and recycling work was 
done for the U.S. Department of Energy. But the main work in recent years has 
been cleanup from past activities. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, EPA and DOE officials have repeatedly stated that conditions 
at the site pose no danger to the public -- but have added the caveat that 
environmental testing there has been inadequate.

BLOCKS DONATED TO REFUGE ARE TESTED FOR RADIOACTIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Radiation safety officers are testing concrete blocks that UCLA donated to an 
animal refuge because the university may have skipped a required test for 
radioactivity when the blocks were salvaged from a nuclear reactor, federal 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The huge blocks, which once shielded the core of a university reactor, were 
declared non-radioactive two years ago and donated to the Wildlife Waystation 
east of Sylmar for construction material. But there is concern that UCLA, in 
decommissioning the reactor, failed to conduct one safety test required before 
the blocks could be given away, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Radiation safety officers from UCLA last week began the testing at the animal 
refuge in Little Tujunga Canyon because they could not document that all 22 
blocks were measured for fixed contamination, according to the NRC. 
</P>
<P>
Agency officials said it was uncertain whether UCLA lost records of the tests 
or failed to conduct them. 
</P>
<P>
But Emilio Garcia, an inspector at the NRC's western regional office in Walnut 
Creek, said initial tests have turned up no readings above federal safety 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of radioactivity that is left there does not constitute a public 
health and safety issue," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said he had no qualms about relying on UCLA to conduct the tests. "We 
don't have any reason to suspect at this point that they're lying to us," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
James E. McLaughlin, director of radiation safety at UCLA, said he has "no 
reservations" about the safety of the blocks, adding that he is not convinced 
that the type of testing now being done "was required for all the blocks" under 
NRC rules. 
</P>
<P>
Martine Colette, director of the Wildlife Waystation, said she understood the 
concrete blocks "were approved for release as absolutely safe, and I still have 
that feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Two of the blocks are being used for erosion control, and the other 20 are 
stored in a salvage area, McLaughlin said. He said all tests so far have been 
negative, but that equipment will have to be brought in to lift the 5,000-pound 
blocks and gain access to all surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
It was not the NRC but an anti-nuclear group that first raised the issue of the 
missing test records. The group, Committee to Bridge the Gap, led the 
successful fight several years ago to shut down the research reactor on the 
Westwood campus. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said some of the blocks shielding the reactor core were disposed of 
at a commercial radioactive waste dump at Richland, Wash. But 22 were declared 
non-radioactive and hauled to the Waystation, which cares for homeless lions, 
bears and other dangerous or exotic animals. 
</P>
<P>
According to NRC officials, three types of tests are required before such 
nuclear components can be released for unrestricted use. They said UCLA records 
showed that two types of tests -- for removable contamination and for radiation 
levels three feet from the blocks -- were performed for the 22 blocks. Missing 
are the results of tests for fixed contamination -- which occurs when atoms of 
the concrete, under neutron bombardment, become radioactive. 
</P>
<P>
In an inspection last winter, NRC officials criticized UCLA's record-keeping 
but did not specifically note the lack of data for fixed contamination. The 
issue was raised instead during the summer by Dan Hirsch, president of 
Committee to Bridge the Gap, Garcia and Hirsch said in interviews.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PAROLEE ARRESTED IN ATTEMPTED ABDUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state prison parolee has been arrested on suspicion of attempting to kidnap 
an 8-year-old Burbank girl as she walked home from Bret Harte Elementary School 
last week, Burbank police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond M. Blackmore, 23, of Anaheim was taken into custody Monday afternoon as 
he made a delivery in Glendale for his employer, an Anaheim messenger service, 
Sgt. Don Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Undisclosed evidence at the scene of the attempted abduction led police to 
suspect Blackmore, who was on parole for assault with attempt to commit rape, 
assault with a deadly weapon and burglary, Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmore allegedly grabbed the girl last Tuesday in an attempt to abduct her 
in a delivery van, Goldberg said. But her screams drew the attention of several 
passers-by and the man fled, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmore drove his van alongside the girl as she walked on Allan Avenue in 
Burbank and asked her for directions, Goldberg said. When she refused to 
answer, he continued driving near her, prompting her to run. Blackmore drove 
ahead, stopped his van and stood waiting for the girl to walk by, Goldberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the neighbors and witnesses hadn't scared the guy off, he would have 
definitely kidnaped her," Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmore was being held without bail in the Burbank Police Department Jail. 
Arraignment was scheduled for Nov. 29 in Burbank Municipal Court, Goldberg 
said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-COUNSELOR PLEADS GUILTY IN SEX ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Foothill Rehabilitation Center counselor pleaded guilty Tuesday in San 
Fernando Municipal Court to sodomizing a psychiatric patient in his care. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plea bargain with prosecutors, Roger Branson, 43, of Valencia will be 
sentenced to no more than one year in County Jail, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Kenneth L. Barshop. 
</P>
<P>
Branson was originally charged with one count of sodomizing a mentally disabled 
person and one count of forcible oral copulation. If he had been convicted of 
both charges he could have received a maximum sentence of 16 years in state 
prison, Barshop said. 
</P>
<P>
However, there were "problems with proof," Barshop said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Sheriff Pam Schrick, who investigated the case, said the victim was 
committed to the psychiatric hospital involuntarily and prosecutors feared he 
would have trouble testifying at a trial. Barshop said Branson had no prior 
criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred on Aug. 26, 1988, Schrick said. Branson took the victim 
out of the hospital, saying he wanted to treat him to a birthday dinner. 
Instead, Branson took the patient to his home, where he sexually assaulted him, 
Schrick said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim reported the incident after Branson returned him to the hospital. 
Branson was fired shortly after and was arrested Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his arrest, he was teaching at Saugus High School as a permanent 
substitute, Schrick said.

Police arrested two 16-year-olds Tuesday in connection with racist graffiti 
spray-painted last month at Simi Valley High School. Each teen-ager was charged 
with two counts of misdemeanor vandalism, said Simi Police Lt. Robert Klamser. 
</P>
<P>
The high school juniors were arrested in connection with two vandalism 
incidents reported by school employees on Oct. 3 and Oct. 19. In the two cases, 
swastikas and racial epithets were spray-painted on the school's tennis courts, 
baseball field dugout and windows on two buildings, causing about $3,000 
damage, said police and school Principal David Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis said school officials would conduct their own investigation and take 
appropriate disciplinary action when the students return. 
</P>
<P>
Klamser said the case bore no apparent connection to four other "hate crimes" 
reported in the city since May that involved either skinhead gang members, 
racially oriented vandalism or both. No arrests have been made in those cases, 
the most serious of which caused about $20,000 in damage to the home of a black 
school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Klamser said in a prepared statement that police had "indications that the 
suspects have sympathies to the white-supremacist movement" but no evidence 
that they belonged to any gangs.

WESTLAKE VILLAGE OKS MAJOR DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Westlake Village City Council voted 4 to 1 Tuesday night to approve 
construction of Westlake North, a residential and commercial development that 
will be the largest in the planned city's history. 
</P>
<P>
"It is good for the community," Mayor Franklin Pelletier said, citing the $31.7 
million worth of concessions the developer agreed to in exchange for council 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
Pelletier, Councilwoman Bonnie Klove, Councilman Kenneth E. Rufener and 
Councilman Irwin A. Shane voted to approve the project. Councilwoman Berniece 
E. Bennett cast the dissenting vote, but said she did so because she wanted 
more information about the development company, Westlake Village Associates, 
and the savings and loans institutions that comprise it. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake North would be built on a 129-acre, horseshoe-shaped property that 
surrounds the Valley Oaks Memorial Park Cemetery north of the Ventura Freeway 
and east of Lindero Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake Village Associates first proposed 400 condominiums and 1.5 million 
square feet of commercial space, including six-story buildings. But the 
proposal eventually was reduced to 250 dwelling units, 1.4 million square feet 
of commercial space and a height limit of four stories. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial area is to include a 960,000-square-foot office park and 454,000 
square feet of general commercial space with a shopping center and a 
four-story, 250-room hotel. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-day public hearing on Nov. 15 and 16, in sessions that ran past 
midnight both nights, the council and Westlake Village Associates reached an 
agreement under which the developer would provide several concessions in 
exchange for approval of Westlake North, including a guarantee to preserve the 
Westlake Village Golf Course, which the developer owns, for 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
The firm also agreed to build a four-acre park within Westlake North and to pay 
for $6.5 million in street improvements and pay $3.5 million the city could use 
for a new library and other projects, such as storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
Pelletier, who did not seek re-election this year, and Shane, who was defeated, 
leave office on Dec. 6. They will be replaced by James E. Emmons, the town's 
former city manager, and businessman Douglas R. Yarrow. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's council vote was known as a "first reading." Passage of the bill must 
be confirmed by a second vote. The council scheduled that vote for Dec. 6, 
before the new council members are seated.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: COUNTYWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trying to address an increasing need for day-care facilities, San Diego County 
supervisors decided Tuesday to study whether parents would use child-care 
centers if they were placed at transit centers. 
</P>
<P>
Officials will examine transit centers in Oceanside and Chula Vista to see 
whether parents using public transportation would also drop children off at 
day-care centers there. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the greatest difficulties for working parents in using public 
transportation is the difficulty in finding appropriate day-care facilities in 
close proximity to bus, trolley or rail lines," said Supervisor John MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous vote, supervisors approved spending $15,000 from a state grant 
to study the feasibility of such day-care centers. The study, pending state 
approval, will take about three months, said Nancy Allen, MacDonald's chief of 
staff. And if the survey indicates parents' willingness to use day care at 
transit centers, the supervisors might consider launching pilot projects. 
</P>
<P>
By 1995, nearly two-thirds of preschool children and three-fourths of all 
school-age children will have working mothers, according to a report presented 
to the supervisors.

MIKE DOWNEY: ASSIGNING A VALUE TO CHEAPEST SHOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buddy Ryan has brought new meaning to the term Thanksgiving bounty. 
</P>
<P>
The coach of the Philadelphia Eagles -- the bespectacled guy with the "fat rear 
end," to use Dallas Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson's description -- put a bounty on 
the heads of certain Dallas players during the Thanksgiving Day game at Irving, 
Tex., or so the head Cowpoke claims. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson accused Ryan of offering cash bonuses to certain Eagle players to knock 
certain Cowboy players out of commission. The principal targets were, 
allegedly, quarterback Troy Aikman and kicker Luis Zendejas, players not 
accustomed to defending themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan denied all charges, except the part about his rear end. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time the Eagles supposedly have been paid to do bad 
things to opponents' bodies. We find it difficult to believe, though, that 
players would do such a thing to their NFL brothers, particularly considering 
that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Darryl Stingley is still sitting in his wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The amount Ryan was offering, according to Johnson, was as little as $200. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The spiritual leader of Philadelphia's squad is the Rev. Reggie White, the 
NFL's minister of defense. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow we cannot picture Rev. Reggie condoning such actions. We can't imagine 
him leading a prayer in the huddle: "Do unto others . . . and pick up a nice 
piece of change!" 
</P>
<P>
Johnson produced a film clip of a Philly player trying to turn the Dallas 
kicker into cream cheese. According to other Texans who have seen this scene, 
it was the dirtiest thing on film in Dallas since that picture starring Debbie. 
</P>
<P>
Well, now everybody's wondering about Buddy. Could he possibly be so mean a 
man? Is it true he wanted some Eagle, any Eagle, to go after Mike Ditka on the 
sideline when the team played Chicago? Is it true that Buddy Ryan, to borrow an 
old line by Bob Uecker, is one of those Philadelphia people who is so mean, 
he'd boo blind children on an Easter Egg hunt? 
</P>
<P>
Ryan says he never set out to hurt a living soul. The fact that one of his 
over-eager Eagles drew a bead on li'l Looie Zendejas and practically knocked 
the cuckoo out of the poor guy's clock, well, gosh, gee-whillikers, Buddy said, 
that's just an occupational hazard. If you don't want to get hurt, don't play 
football. Play chess. Play piano. Join a commune. Grow organic vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Buddy, Buddy. Better be tellin' the truth, Buddy. Anybody from the NFL finds 
out that you really are putting bounties on opponents, they're going to be 
coming after you. Not just with suspensions. With knuckle sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
Because, as we now know, nobody is safe on a football field, not even the 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Burt, a big brute of a San Francisco 49er, came right out last week and 
said if he'd get the chance in Monday night's game against the New York Giants, 
his old team, he would make sure he careened out of bounds in the general 
direction of Giant Coach Bill Parcells, just so he could bump him into the next 
area code. Burt hoped to hit Parcells on Monday night and have him wake up 
Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Whoa, what a rough sport football is becoming. We knew it wasn't for wimps. We 
just didn't know it would turn into Last Man Standing Wins. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Johnson is playing a dangerous game, making accusations against a fellow 
coach. Buddy Ryan might assign one of his hit men to go after the Cowboy coach, 
next time the teams meet. Don't forget, Jimmy doesn't have any real protection 
from injury, except for his hair. 
</P>
<P>
NFL binocular carriers are going to be keeping a careful eye on the 
Philadelphia Eagles from this day forward. If any Eagle so much as pats an 
opponent on his skinny rear end, he had better do so gently. Any rough stuff, 
there's going to be a fistfight. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, and by the way, we strongly recommend that the Philadelphia kicker consider 
taking karate classes, first chance. Dallas players could be contemplating 
retaliation. Open warfare on kickers could be just around the bend. Barefoot 
types such as Mike Lansford and Rich Karlis are particularly vulnerable to 
getting their tootsies stomped. 
</P>
<P>
The only hitch facing the Dallas Cowboys is that nobody on that particular team 
has yet shown that he knows how to hit anybody. 
</P>
<P>
One thing about all this violence, we simply cannot believe that players would 
deliberately try to injure coaches. Imagine pulling some such stunt on George 
Halas or Tom Landry. Imagine somebody making the mistake of going after Art 
Shell. Shell would fold his arms and send the guy flying halfway to Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
Houston's stadium is known nowadays as the House of Pain. Such a lovely image. 
New Orleans Coach Jim Mora opened a recent news conference by ripping apart a 
stuffed referee doll. Such sportsmanlike conduct. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL is a dangerous place. Guess it always was. 
</P>
<P>
From now on, though, injured players no longer will be listed in this newspaper 
as questionable and doubtful. They'll be listed as was injured and will be.

PARRISH, NOW A FREE AGENT, EXPECTED TO KEEP HALO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

Although Angel catcher Lance Parrish was declared a free agent Tuesday by an 
arbitrator's ruling and has until Jan. 8 to negotiate with all clubs, it's 
unlikely that the 33-year-old veteran of more than 12 major league seasons will 
wear a different uniform in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish's agent, Tom Reich, indicated that Parrish is eager to remain with the 
Angels, and General Manager Mike Port seems equally eager to keep Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
Reich said he plans to meet with Port later this week or next week during the 
annual winter baseball meetings in Nashville, Tenn. Port said in a statement 
issued by the club that "processes are already under way" to ensure that 
Parrish is retained. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking whatever steps are necessary to keep Lance Parrish as a 
California Angel," a club spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish, who graduated from Walnut High School and lives in Yorba Linda, could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of mutual admiration between Lance Parrish and the club," Reich 
said. "Let's say one thing: It was a real good year for Lance and the club and 
his family. All things being relatively equal, he appeared to be happy. This is 
his home. Those are important elements. Fair treatment is certainly another 
important element." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels acquired Parrish from Philadelphia on Oct. 3, 1988, for pitcher 
David Holdridge and paid him $1.21 million in 1989, including bonuses totaling 
$210,000. He hit .238 last season -- 23 points higher than his 1988 average -- 
with 17 home runs and 50 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish was part of baseball's second collusion case, which resulted in 
arbitrator George Nicolau's granting several players free agency after the 1988 
season. Parrish, however, was not granted free agency at that time. 
Management's Players Relations Committee claimed that he had waived his rights 
to free agency when he left Detroit to sign with Philadelphia between the 1986 
and '87 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing before Nicolau on Parrish's right to free agency was scheduled for 
next month but was canceled when the PRC agreed not to contest it. Nicolau then 
issued his order Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty straightforward," Nicolau said of his ruling. "Something like 12 
players (received a similar verdict) last year. . . . It's nothing unusual. 
It's the same kind of . . . order given in prior cases and that I gave last 
year."

Ivan Lendl, in search of his fifth Masters title and confirmation of his No. 1 
ranking, got revenge Tuesday by defeating Michael Chang 6-1, 6-3 in the year's 
tennis finale at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
It was their first meeting since the French Open, when Chang, hobbled by 
cramps, surprised the world's top-ranked player in the fourth round and went on 
to capture his first Grand Slam title, becoming the first American to win on 
the clay in Paris in 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
But Lendl, more at home on the faster carpet surface, made sure he wouldn't 
lose this time. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, third-seeded Stefan Edberg swiftly and silently crushed flamboyant 
Andre Agassi 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl took aim with his big serve, then powered forehands and backhands that 
repeatedly caught Chang on the wrong side of the court. It was an awesome 
display of firepower tempered with the discipline that allowed Lendl to 
constantly change speeds and, when need be, sneak into the net for winning 
volleys. 
</P>
<P>
In making his first step toward a 10th consecutive trip to the Masters final, 
Lendl gave Chang a lesson in tennis strategy. He even came back from 0-40 to 
break Chang in the seventh game and close out the opening set. 
</P>
<P>
But Chang was a quick study. Several times he stepped inside the baseline and 
crushed Lendl's second serve, and he began the second set by breaking Lendl at 
love, the third point coming on a winning return of a second serve. 
</P>
<P>
When Chang rifled a backhand down the line to the corner, forcing Lendl to sail 
a forehand long, Lendl said, "Nice shot." It was one of the rare times Lendl 
needed to acknowledge his foe.

Wilf Paiement, as former NHL star, was ordered by a New York judge to pay 
$85,000 for smashing the nose of another player with a hockey stick during a 
1978 game in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
State Supreme Court Justice Eugene Nardelli said Paiement, who retired in 1988, 
must pay the estate of Peter Gilbert, late owner of the company that owned the 
Colorado Rockies, now the New Jersey Devils. 
</P>
<P>
Paiement was playing for the Rockies when he hit Detroit's Dennis Polonich in 
the face with his stick on Oct. 25, 1978. Polonich sued Paiement and APA Sports 
Inc., which owned the Rockies. A federal court jury awarded Polonich $850,000. 
In a $650,000 settlement reached the next year, the team paid $85,000 and the 
Rockies' insurance company paid the rest.

The A's also included a no-trade clause in the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, first to sign a four-year deal since Ken Oberkfell with Atlanta in 
1985, gets a $1 million signing bonus, $2 million in 1990 and $3 million in 
1991, 1992 and 1993. It makes him baseball's second $3 million-a-year player. 
Minnesota Twin center fielder Kirby Puckett agreed to a $9 million, three-year 
contract last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Arn Tellem, who represents free agent pitcher Mark Langston, was pleased to 
hear about Henderson's four-year deal, calling it an encouraging break with the 
owners' pattern of the last few years. He couldn't predict what impact it would 
have on Langston's negotiations, but added that length of contract will be a 
factor in Langston's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm asking for a five-year deal," Tellem said. "I'm waiting for someone to 
step forward and offer five years." 
</P>
<P>
There are rumors that Gene Autry, the Angels' owner, has already done that, but 
Tellem said he wouldn't comment on specific aspects of his negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson's agent, Richie Bry, said his client "has the largest guaranteed 
contract in baseball, by a wide margin." 
</P>
<P>
"My heart was set on playing in Oakland," said Henderson, 30, an Oakland 
native. 
</P>
<P>
A's General Manager Sandy Alderson knew he needed to act fast to avoid giving 
Yankee owner George Steinbrenner a chance to lure Henderson back to New York. 
The Yankees traded him to Oakland on June 21. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson was named the outstanding player in the playoffs against Toronto, 
batting .400 with two home runs, five RBIs and eight steals.

ANDERSON SIGNS TWO-YEAR CONTRACT WITH THE GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Free agent Dave Anderson, the Dodgers' veteran utility infielder, signed a 
two-year contract with the San Francisco Giants Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, 29, received $420,000 in 1989. Terms of his new contract were not 
disclosed, but it was learned that he is guaranteed more than $1 million for 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
Once considered the Dodgers' shortstop of the future, Anderson was plagued by 
back problems and never appeared in more than 121 games in a season. He hit 
.229 in 140 at-bats last season and .232 during his six previous seasons with 
the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants were attracted to Anderson because they may lose Ken Oberkfell, a 
free agent, and Chris Speier who is expected to retire after 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Claire, the Dodgers' executive vice president, said he was interested in 
retaining Anderson, but only on a one-year basis. He said the Dodgers remain 
well stocked in utility infielders. ROSS NEWHAN

HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: DAMEWORTH'S 3RD STATE TITLE A CINCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He used a tremendous finishing sprint to win the inaugural state Division I 
cross-country championship in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he fended off Thousand Oaks High's Mike Williamson and Jimmy 
Rodriguez of Santa Ana Valley in a thrilling stretch duel for a second Division 
I title. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, though, things were different for Agoura's Bryan Dameworth. 
</P>
<P>
There was no last-second surge toward the finish line. No rival runner 
breathing down his neck. And there certainly was no doubt that the soloist was 
on a Division I record pace en route to his third consecutive state title. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth toured the 5,000-meter (3.1-mile) course at Woodward Park in Fresno 
in a personal-best 14 minutes, 45 seconds. He also lowered his previous 
Division I mark of 15:03, which he set in last year's state championship. His 
previous best on the Woodward Park course was a 14:58 clocking in the 1988 
Kinney West regional. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth's closest competition Saturday was Arroyo Grande junior Louie 
Quintana, who finished second in 14:59. Dameworth built a 100-meter lead over 
Quintana in the final three-quarters of a mile after the two runners passed two 
miles in 9:32. 
</P>
<P>
"I really expected Quintana to be there (in the end)," said Dameworth, who said 
that he felt sluggish during the race because of a cold. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth might have entered the race carrying the expectations that accompany 
a two-time state champion, but an undefeated season and clutch performances in 
the major races this fall have bolstered his confidence. 
</P>
<P>
That confidence primarily stemmed from the 2-A Division championships Nov. 18 
when Dameworth clocked 14:36 on the challenging Mt. San Antonio College course 
to win the individual title. Only Burbank's Jeff Nelson, who ran 14:32 in 1978, 
has run faster. "I guess I impressed myself," Dameworth said. "I didn't think 
I'd run that fast." 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth might have been surprised with his mark in the 2-A final, but Agoura 
Coach Bill Duley, who is also Dameworth's stepfather, wasn't taken aback with 
his protege's performance Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured he'd be down in that range because he's been pretty consistent all 
year long," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Dameworth has won three state titles in cross-country, he has yet 
to claim one on the track. He finished seventh in the 3,200-meter final in the 
state track and field championships as a freshman and was second last year in a 
personal-best 9:00.27. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd definitely like to win one in track," he said. "I'll take them both (the 
1,600 and 3,200) pretty seriously. Maybe I'll run in both." 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth prefers the Woodward Park course, but he still has some unfinished 
business there. He placed second in the Kinney West regional last year and said 
that he would like to move up a notch this season. Nothing would please him 
more than an undefeated season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to win (the Kinney National title) and finish the season totally 
undefeated," he said. "I'm not going to take it lightly because I'm not sure 
what other people can do."

BASEBALL COACH HIRED AT OAK PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Randles has been hired to run the Oak Park High baseball program, filling 
one vacancy created when Ron Veres resigned in September. 
</P>
<P>
Randles, who will turn 30 on Dec. 6, has had limited coaching and playing 
experience. He played varsity baseball under Fred Williams at Agoura High in 
1974-77, and he coached and played rugby for nine years at the club level. 
</P>
<P>
The vacancy was created when Veres resigned as football and baseball coach 
Sept. 6 because of philosophical differences with the administration. 
</P>
<P>
Randles, who was hired as a full-time science teacher this fall, became an 
assistant with the junior varsity when Oak Park reshuffled its coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
Randles said that he developed his coaching philosophy after taking two 
physical education classes with Cal Poly Pomona Coach John Scolinos, one of the 
winningest active coaches in college baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not familiar with the players at Oak Park," said Randles, who will hold 
his first team meeting today. "I understand we have a young team with only four 
varsity lettermen returning. We'll find out (today) who wants to play." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Goldstein, who coached boys' tennis last season, will return to his 
position as junior varsity baseball coach. Goldstein also coaches the school's 
boys' basketball team.

PIERCE SWEPT FROM STATE PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The finely tuned defensive machine that carried the Pierce College women's 
volleyball team to its first state playoff berth came to a clanking, grinding, 
shuddering halt Tuesday night in a second-round, three-game loss at El Camino 
College. 
</P>
<P>
The end took barely an hour as El Camino rolled to a 15-12, 15-5, 15-5 win. 
</P>
<P>
Frustratingly for Pierce (18-3), it was not only beaten soundly but also beaten 
at its own game. 
</P>
<P>
"They just played smarter than us," Pierce outside hitter Anna Suarez said. "We 
just didn't pull together at all. Nothing worked." 
</P>
<P>
The undersized Pierce players earned their postseason berth with a combination 
of clever offense and surprising defense, but, suddenly, against El Camino, 
passes were going awry, serves were being mis-hit and blocks were crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt we probably played our worst match that we've played all year," Pierce 
Coach Steve Gazzaniga said. "We made probably as many unforced errors as we 
have in any game we've played." 
</P>
<P>
As it often does, sixth-seeded Pierce fell behind in the first game, 7-3, but 
battled back to an 8-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded El Camino (14-1) answered with consecutive bursts of three and two 
points, however, to stymie what proved to be Pierce's only threat. 
</P>
<P>
Despite holding a distinct height advantage, El Camino initially eschewed a 
power game and caught Pierce off balance with an off-speed attack. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised," said Suarez, who led Pierce with 10 kills. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino recorded 17 aces. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce quickly fell behind, 8-3, in the second game. Then, after an exchange of 
sideouts, El Camino reeled off six consecutive points on Cindee Rutherford's 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce scored the first point of the third game before being walled in by a 
progressively more dominant El Camino block. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Alofaituli (5-foot-11) and Lisa Wenker (6-0) each recorded seven stuff 
blocks, and Wenker led El Camino with nine kills and five aces. 
</P>
<P>
Alissa Levisohn supported Suarez with seven kills, but El Camino held Andrea 
Banducci, the Western State Conference leader in hitting percentage, to four 
kills. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino moves into the final eight and the double-elimination stage of the 
state tournament.

NORTHRIDGE GATHERS OFFENSE TOGETHER IN TIME TO BEAT CLU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having suffered a heartbreaking quadruple-overtime loss to the College of St. 
Thomas in its opener Saturday night, the Cal State Northridge men's basketball 
team was eager to make amends against Cal Lutheran on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps too eager. 
</P>
<P>
An impatient Matador offense made only 32% (11 of 34) of its shots in the first 
half. But in the second half, Northridge settled down, hitting 18 of 34 shots 
en route to a 79-63 victory in a nonconference game at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"We're like a bunch of thoroughbreds," Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said. 
"We're young and we have a tendency to just want to get out and run. . . . We 
get overanxious, and it affects the way we play." 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Gathers was a prime example of what Cassidy was talking about. The 
Matadors' leading scorer last year, Gathers scored only two points in the first 
half on one-of-11 shooting, but he finished with a team-high 18 points after 
hitting six of 11 shots in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
'I'm a shooter," said Gathers, who scored a team-high 26 points against St. 
Thomas. "So I wasn't really worried about the first half. I knew I would heat 
up sooner or later. Coach told me at half to just relax and things would start 
to fall and they did." 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 38-32, early in the second half, Northridge -- led by Gathers -- put 
the game away with a 23-9 run. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, who had missed his last 10 shots of the first half, made three of four 
-- including two three-point baskets -- during the surge. 
</P>
<P>
With a 20-point lead, Cassidy sat four of his five starters, but Cal Lutheran, 
led by Jeff deLaveaga, countered with an 7-0 run to narrow the Matadors' lead 
to 61-48 with 9:12 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
DeLaveaga, who scored a game-high 27 points, had five points during the 
Kingsmen rally, prompting Cassidy to reinsert Gathers and Co. into the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (1-1) quickly hit four consecutive baskets to take a 71-48 lead with 
7:35 left, and Cal Lutheran (0-4) got no closer than 14 points after that. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers made three-point baskets to start the run and finish it, and baskets by 
Kris Brodowski and Kendell McDaniels were sandwiched in between. 
</P>
<P>
Brodowski scored 12 points in the game, along with teammates Jemarl Baker and 
Eugene Humphrey; McDaniels had 11 points and a game-high 17 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Brown added nine points off the bench -- all in the second half -- for 
the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge led, 36-30, at halftime, despite Gathers' troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey picked up the scoring slack, scoring 10 points on four-of-five 
shooting, including two three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
"Gene is one of our most patient players," Cassidy said. "He's a very 
intelligent player on the court. He doesn't get overly excited." 
</P>
<P>
DeLaveaga, the younger brother of former Cal Lutheran standout Steve, led the 
Kingsmen with 12 points in the first half, hitting four of eight shots. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge appeared to be on the verge of blowing Cal Lutheran out in the first 
half -- leading, 29-17, with 5:37 left -- but the Kingsmen went on an 11-4 tear 
over the next 3:59 to narrow the deficit to 33-28 with 1:38 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors will travel to Utah later this week for games against Weber State 
on Friday and Utah State on Saturday.

ANTELOPE VALLEY BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT PREVIEW;

HOST SCHOOL BRACES FOR BAKERSFIELD

<P>
As pushovers go, the Bakersfield College basketball team is not a very good 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Antelope Valley College, Coach Newton Chelette did not know 
that when he was arranging the pairings for the 16-team basketball tournament 
that Antelope Valley will play host to beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield (4-2), therefore, became the host school's first-round opponent in 
a game that is scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the coach-slash-tournament director was to do it all over again . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably wouldn't be playing them," Chelette said. "The decision was made 
well beforehand. But it's too late to change now. 
</P>
<P>
"I know one coach who did that, but I won't. Like I've said all along, I like 
my team. I wouldn't trade my guys for anybody's." 
</P>
<P>
Chelette, who is in his first season as the Antelope Valley coach, has good 
reason to be confident. The team has won four of its first five games, the only 
loss coming against College of the Sequoias -- a team that Bakersfield has 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
No matter, Chelette says. Antelope Valley is a team improving by leaps and 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still early, with all of our new faces and a new coach, it takes time," 
Chelette said. "You see it in spots. And I like what I see. We're starting to 
play well. We just need to develop some consistency." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Mantashigian, a 6-foot-5 freshman from Bishop Gorman High in Las Vegas, 
leads the Marauders in scoring with a 14.3 average. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Griffin, a 6-8, 210-pound freshman from Crenshaw, is averaging 12.6 
points and 8.3 rebounds. He scored 30 points in Antelope Valley's 108-93 
victory over College of the Canyons on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the same game, point guard Dedan Thomas set a school record with 16 assists. 
Thomas is a freshman from Taft High who signed with Nevada Las Vegas but didn't 
meet the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s minimum academic requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons, which led Antelope Valley at the half, will be looking for its first 
victory of the season in the tournament's first game, at 8:45 a.m. against 
Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
Valley (2-2) will play East Los Angeles in its first-round game at 10:30 a.m. 
Glendale (2-2) will meet Desert at 3:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark, the only Valley-area junior college not taking part in the Antelope 
Valley tournament, will play host to seven other teams in its own tournament 
beginning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders (3-2) will open against Rio Hondo in a 7 p.m. game. 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round match-ups, West Los Angeles will meet Citrus at 3 p.m., 
Oxnard will meet San Jose City at 5 p.m. and Ventura will take on Pasadena, the 
defending tournament champions, at 9 p.m.

KOHL PROPOSES FEDERATION OF TWO GERMANYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his first major statement on the future of the two Germanys since the Berlin 
Wall was breached Nov. 9, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl proposed Tuesday a 
federation of West and East Germany, saying it should be an interim step before 
the ultimate goal of reunification. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to Parliament, Kohl offered substantial support to encourage 
democratic reforms in the East and pressed for closer cooperation between the 
two states. 
</P>
<P>
"We are ready," he said, "to develop confederative structures. . . . Nobody 
knows today how a reunited Germany will look. But I am sure unity will come, if 
the people in Germany want it." 
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that "a legitimate democratic government in East Germany is a 
prerequisite" and that "the future structure of Germany must fit into the 
architecture of Europe as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl said he had no timetable in mind to carry out his ideas and made it clear 
that it could take years to form a federation. He said the two governments 
should establish -- soon after free elections in the East -- joint committees 
on such matters as the economy, transport, environment, technology, health and 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
He offered to establish a fund to finance visits to West Germany by East 
Germans and to help modernize East Germany's transport and communications 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
East German leader Egon Krenz quickly ruled out any talk of reunifying the 
Germanys. "A unity of Germany isn't on the agenda," he told West Germany's 
ARD-TV network, insisting on the continued existence of two "sovereign, 
independent German states." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's proposal was described by officials in his party, the Christian 
Democratic Union, as a rebuke to critics who have complained that he has not 
reacted quickly or imaginatively enough to fast-moving developments in East 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, East Germany has replaced its hard-line Communist 
leader, Erich Honecker, installed a reformist prime minister, opened the Berlin 
Wall dividing the old capital and promised free elections. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl is expected to confer with Krenz in East Germany in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficially, Kohl's proposal was widely viewed as a blueprint for the 
incorporation of East Germany into West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Writer Stefan Heym said that Kohl, "with this overture, has begun the process 
of absorption." 
</P>
<P>
A newspaper that speaks for the National Democratic Party, which has been in 
the Communist camp, said that reunification "would be . . . equivalent to East 
Germany's incorporation into West Germany." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said: "Chancellor 
Kohl is responding to the deepest aspirations of his people for unity. This is 
a goal we have long shared with the Federal Republic of Germany. It is not a 
cause for concern that the chancellor has laid out his vision. It is not a 
blueprint for reunification but a coherent approach to the rapid changes that 
have taken place." 
</P>
<P>
But Vadim Zagladin, a diplomatic adviser to Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, said in Rome that Kohl appeared to be contradicting what he has said 
in the recent past. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Kohl," he said, "is deciding the future of another state that is perfectly 
capable of deciding itself." 
</P>
<P>
Even before his speech to Parliament, Kohl had pledged massive West German 
financial help to the ailing East German economy, provided that its new 
leadership moves to ensure human rights and guarantees free elections. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Kohl's critics, including his foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, 
have urged him to offer economic aid with no strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany's constitution calls for eventual reunification of the country, 
which was partitioned at the end of World War II in 1945. But West Germany's 
allies, and many West German political leaders, would prefer gradual 
reunification -- a series of steps that would ensure that the country remains 
firmly anchored in the Western Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl aides said Tuesday that his call for confederation was designed to quiet 
West European fears that the Bonn government might be focusing too much 
attention on reunification and pushing for new relations with the countries of 
East Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl said in his speech that Bonn is firmly committed to the European Community 
but that the EC should extend its vision to the East. 
</P>
<P>
"The European Community," he said, "must not end at the Elbe (River) but must 
also be open to the East." 
</P>
<P>
Hans-Jochen Vogel, leader of the opposition Social Democratic Party, agreed 
with Kohl and issued a separate call for confederation and economic aid for 
East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, Manfred Woerner, secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, said Kohl's proposal is basically in line with the NATO position, 
spelled out last May, that German reunification should be achieved through 
self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
He said the approach outlined by Kohl "links the development of the German 
future to the larger process of building Europe, and to the existing 
institutions of the West." 
</P>
<P>
A German confederation, which would create an economic powerhouse with a 
population of 80 million in the heart of Europe, is not a novel concept. Until 
late in the 19th Century, more than a dozen German-speaking states were united 
in a loose confederation that was to become the German Empire. 
</P>
<P>
The empire was shattered in World War I. A brief period of democracy followed, 
which was succeeded in 1933 by Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. Legally, according 
to some international experts, Germany's frontiers are still those of Hitler's 
Germany and will remain so until a World War II peace treaty is concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Some Germans on the political right contend that a reunified Germany would have 
a legitimate claim to lands ceded to Poland and the Soviet Union after the war.

MASSIVE U.S. TROOP CUTS IN EUROPE PLANNED 
</P>

<P>
American defense planners are preparing massive new troop cuts in Europe, 
reducing the U.S. presence here by as much as two-thirds over the next several 
years, a senior U.S. official said Tuesday. The current 310,000 U.S. troops in 
Europe will be cut to 100,000 to 150,000 in response to a sharply reduced 
Soviet military threat and in recognition of severe budgetary pressures at 
home, said the official, who asked that his name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
The new cuts would be conditioned on equal Soviet reductions and strict 
verification measures to ensure compliance with the agreement, U.S. officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, President Bush on Tuesday sought to dampen speculation over the 
upcoming U.S.-Soviet summit meeting by declaring that the weekend talks in 
Malta will produce no deals on troop reductions in Europe. And here in 
Brussels, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney reassured West European allies that 
the United States will not unilaterally reduce forces committed to the Western 
military alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, White House budget officials have proposed deep cuts in the 1991 
defense budget that would require substantial troop cuts relatively soon, The 
Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
Richard G. Darman, White House budget director, has proposed cutting the 
defense budget to $290 billion, a slight reduction from the 1990 level and a 
4.6% cut from the level that would be required to keep pace with inflation. The 
Pentagon is fighting to hold the line at $301 billion to avoid a rapid 
scale-back, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is expected to make a decision on the issue after returning from the 
superpower summit. 
</P>
<P>
Senior planners here have concluded that it is safe to gradually "draw down" 
U.S. forces to substantially lower levels. 
</P>
<P>
Bush may propose the new numbers to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at 
the Malta meeting, the officials here said. White House Press Secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater said Monday that Bush is considering "a wide range of military 
options that involve a number of different force levels." 
</P>
<P>
The new cuts would be negotiated with the Soviet Union beginning immediately 
after completion of the current round of arms talks in Vienna known as CFE, or 
Conventional Forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
CFE II, as the new talks are already being called, would build upon the 
principles of the first round, which began earlier this year. U.S. negotiators 
are under a firm White House deadline to complete the CFE I talks in time for a 
Bush-Gorbachev summit next June, officials here said. 
</P>
<P>
The current round of talks would reduce U.S. and Soviet troop levels in Europe 
to 275,000 on each side. That represents about a 10% cut for the Americans and 
a 50% cut for the Soviets. The second round would at least halve those numbers 
but use the CFE framework as the means to accomplish the cuts, officials said. 
The proposed CFE treaty provides for constant monitoring of each side's forces 
to assure that they are within the overall ceilings and are deployed and 
equipped in compliance with the treaty language. 
</P>
<P>
"With CFE, you're getting two for one," a senior U.S. official at the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization said. "In addition to cuts everyone wants to make 
anyway, you're also getting a security structure in the bargain." 
</P>
<P>
Talk of unilateral U.S. force reductions or a separate U.S.-Soviet peace 
outside of NATO leave European leaders profoundly uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Uigleik Eide of Norway, chairman of NATO's military committee, said at a 
press conference Tuesday: "Defense planning must be in accord with the arms 
control process. . . . The committee strongly recommends a step-by-step process 
of controlled and verifiable progress, thus avoiding unilateral Western 
disarmament." 
</P>
<P>
Although expressed in NATO code language, his comments were meant as a sharp 
warning to Bush and Cheney not to bypass the alliance in their haste to 
conclude arms deals with Moscow and to trim the Pentagon budget. 
</P>
<P>
Eide said that despite the symbolism of the Berlin Wall cracking apart, the 
military might of the Soviet Union and its allies remains formidable. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Norwegian's language echoes that of Cheney just a few weeks 
ago, when the American defense chief was virtually the last voice in the Bush 
Administration warning of a continuing Soviet menace. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Cheney appears to be among the Administration's foremost advocates of 
disarmament. Aides suggest that Cheney has adopted a conciliatory tone in part 
to reassure Gorbachev that the Administration speaks with one voice and in part 
to convince Congress that he's serious about cutting military spending. 
</P>
<P>
The arms control process provides several opportunities for reducing the 
Pentagon budget. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official assigned to NATO noted that arms control verification measures 
and improved surveillance of the Soviet Union and its shaky Warsaw Pact allies 
have provided the West with much greater warning of an impending Soviet attack. 
</P>
<P>
The increasingly remote possibility of a surprise invasion of Europe will allow 
the Pentagon to scale back expensive overseas deployments and keep the forces 
in reserve in the United States in the event they are needed, U.S. military 
planners say. 
</P>
<P>
The longer lead times will allow the Pentagon to save money on transporting 
troops back to Europe, if needed, shifting the job from expensive aircraft to 
cheaper ships.

CZECH PREMIER VOWS A COALITION GOVERNMENT;

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with an opposition ultimatum, Czechoslovakia's Communist prime minister 
promised Tuesday to form a new coalition government, including an unspecified 
number of non-Communists, by next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec also said he will submit to an emergency session 
of the Parliament today a draft amendment that would eliminate from the 
Czechoslovak constitution both its guarantee of the "leading role" of the 
Communist Party and its commitment to Marxism-Leninism as the official state 
ideology. 
</P>
<P>
But the umbrella opposition group Civic Forum kept up its pressure, threatening 
to move by year's end for dissolution of the new Cabinet as well, if it fails 
to come up with an acceptable timetable for holding free elections and 
introducing legal guarantees for a host of other human rights. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum, which in only 10 days has mobilized virtually this entire nation 
against its discredited Communist political leadership, also demanded: 
</P>
<P>
That President Gustav Husak, the former party chief installed by Moscow after 
the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion that ended an earlier drive for reform here 
in 1968, resign his remaining, largely ceremonial post by Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
That the authorities publicly condemn the 1968 invasion and appeal to the 
Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact to also declare the intervention a violation 
of international law. 
</P>
<P>
And that the government disband so-called workers' militias -- Communist 
loyalists who are issued firearms and serve as an extra military arm of the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
The latest developments added to the sense of amazement here over the lightning 
speed with which the hard-line Communist system appears to be collapsing in 
Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
"It took years in Poland, months in Hungary, weeks in East Germany, and here 
it's taken days," said a Western diplomat of the extraordinary transformations 
that have swept through Eastern Europe, posing new terms of reference on a 
continent divided for more than 40 years by the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
However, Civic Forum strategist Jan Urban warned in an interview that despite 
the breathtaking changes, the battle is not yet won. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the next few days as the most risky period," Urban said, adding that the 
opposition has "received many warning signals that the situation in the army is 
very complicated and risky." 
</P>
<P>
Urban said Civic Forum has information that much of Czechoslovakia's army has 
been confined to barracks for the last 11 days, with no access to mail, 
television or newspapers, while political officers "talk to them about the 
possibility of civil war." 
</P>
<P>
The danger of a military coup has increased, the activist added, because "the 
leadership of this (Communist) Party doesn't control the situation; this 
government doesn't control the situation; Civic Forum doesn't control the 
situation. So the only organizational strength in the state is the army and the 
security, and this is very, very risky, because they are tied so closely to the 
old regime." 
</P>
<P>
Urban said this weekend's summit meeting between Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev and President Bush is probably the greatest guarantee against 
violence. The Czechoslovak army is closely integrated within the Warsaw Pact 
structure and presumably could not be used against the democratic revolution 
here without the knowledge of Gorbachev, who appears intent on improving 
East-West relations. 
</P>
<P>
Assurances Sought 
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition takes its information seriously enough that it has 
asked both the Socialist Youth Union, which has chapters in the armed forces, 
and the prime minister's office to clarify the situation. Unless it is assured 
by today that conditions in the military have been returned to normal, "our 
best defense would probably be to launch a mass campaign to warn the public of 
this (coup) possibility," Urban said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Tuesday's dramatic developments occurred on what was otherwise 
probably the quietest day in Prague in nearly two weeks after Civic Forum 
declared an end to the demonstrations that had drawn as many as 500,000 
Czechoslovaks into the streets daily. The opposition group said it wants to 
cool down the situation during negotiations with the government, knowing that 
it can quickly mobilize the population again if the authorities balk at change. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to celebrate, but everybody is so tired we're close to collapse," said 
Eva Lnenickova, 22, one of the university students who ignited the political 
firestorm engulfing the country. "We hope this week there will be a chance to 
celebrate, because this is a great victory," she added after hearing about 
Adamec's capitulation at a two-hour meeting with Civic Forum leaders earlier 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But student leaders said they will continue their strike until Adamec meets the 
Sunday deadline to deliver on his promises. 
</P>
<P>
"It was beautiful," said Petr Gajdos, 27, a scientific researcher, of the 
government's latest concessions. "But it is not yet confirmed, and it is not 
yet complete." Gajdos and half a dozen other young men were camped out at the 
base of a statue of religious reformer Jan Hus in what their name badges 
proclaimed to be the "Liberated Old Town Square." 
</P>
<P>
Confirming Adamec's commitment to propose a new government, Marian Calfa, a 
minister without portfolio who participated in Tuesday's negotiations, 
described the atmosphere as "rather excited" because of the conflicting views 
exchanged. But later, he said, the mood became more "constructive . . . in a 
mutual endeavor to find possible ways out of the present political situation." 
</P>
<P>
Calfa said the new Cabinet is to include "both non-party representatives and 
representatives of other political parties, and at the same time, of course, 
representatives of the Communist Party. It will be a government constituted 
primarily of experts," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Calfa refused to answer questions after reading a brief statement to 
journalists, but Tuesday night, Civic Forum leader Vaclav Havel said that his 
organization "is not and cannot be a political party," and that while it is 
ready to consult with the prime minister on the new government's makeup, "in no 
case will these demands have the form that representatives of Civic Forum are 
directly represented in the Cabinet." 
</P>
<P>
Separately, it was learned that Adamec has already offered five Cabinet seats 
to two small political parties -- the Czechoslovak Socialist Party and the 
Czechoslovak People's Party, a Catholic group -- that have in recent days 
dramatically transformed themselves from tame puppets of the Communists to 
truly independent voices. 
</P>
<P>
The current federal government has 23 members of ministerial rank, all of them 
members of the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Adamec refused to rejoin the party's ruling Presidium during two stormy 
emergency meetings that saw wholesale leadership changes last weekend, saying 
he was disappointed in its commitment to reform. 
</P>
<P>
However, Communist Party spokesman Josef Hora told reporters Tuesday that "I am 
convinced" Adamec consulted the new party leadership before agreeing to Civic 
Forum's demand for a coalition with non-Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's negotiations were adjourned twice in just two hours, reportedly while 
Adamec conferred with party chief Karel Urbanek. 
</P>
<P>
To Meet Gorbachev 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Hora revealed that Urbanek has been invited to visit Gorbachev in 
Moscow early next month, following the Soviet leader's return from his summit 
meeting in Malta. 
</P>
<P>
Havel and other opposition leaders outlined the additional demands they had 
made of Adamec at a packed press conference Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, they said, the delegation had "requested of the prime minister 
that the changed Cabinet, as speedily as possible, issue the outlines of its 
program declaration which would make it plain that the government is prepared 
to create the legal prerequisites for the holding of free elections, assuring 
freedom of assembly and association, freedom of speech and the press, the 
abolition of government supervision of the churches and change in the defense 
law, as well as others." 
</P>
<P>
It said the new government should "as quickly as possible transform its program 
declaration into visible deeds. The (Civic Forum) delegation made it plain to 
the prime minister that if the public is not satisfied with the program 
declaration of the government and its transformation into specific measures, 
the Civic Forum and Public Against Violence (an allied Slovakian group) will, 
at the end of this year, ask the prime minister and his Cabinet to resign, and 
the president of the republic to name a new prime minister, which, if the 
president considers it suitable, will be drafted by the Civic Forum and Public 
Against Violence." 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders said Adamec informed them that he has already requested that 
President Husak pardon as many as 30 political prisoners who remain in 
Czechoslovak prisons. 
</P>
<P>
They also said that a commission, including representatives of Civic Forum and 
students, is to be set up at today's emergency Parliament meeting to 
investigate the brutal police repression of a student demonstration here Nov. 
17. Creation of such a commission was a key demand of student strikers.

NUCLEAR DUMP PLAN 'IN SERIOUS TROUBLE'; 
</P>
<P>
WASTE: BUSH ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS CONCEDE THEY WILL MISS DEADLINE FOR 
OPENING SITE IN NEVADA. THE PLAN FACES LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS AND FIERCE 
OPPOSITION FROM NEVADA POLITICIANS.

<P>
The Bush Administration, in a major setback to the nuclear industry, is 
preparing to officially concede that it will be unable to meet its schedule for 
opening a long-term dump for highly radioactive nuclear waste that has been 
planned for Yucca Mountain in Nevada, Administration officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Progress hasn't been made with the site," a senior Administration official 
said. "The program is in serious trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The problems are twofold, both technical and political. On the technical level 
"everyone, members of Congress, the executive branch, has known for some time 
that there are serious problems" with meeting a deadline of 2003 for opening 
the waste site, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
On the political level, "you've got some Nevada politicians out there that have 
staked their careers on stopping this thing," the official added. 
</P>
<P>
The new delays may push back the opening of the waste site by three years, 
according to Robert Loux, executive director of Nevada's Nuclear Waste Project 
Office. Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore said the delays could be as 
much as seven years beyond the 2003 date. 
</P>
<P>
Several steps that would be necessary to put the waste site into business have 
not yet been taken. For example, under legislation passed during the last year 
of the Reagan Administration, the federal government is supposed to appoint a 
negotiator to work out terms with Nevada for accepting the burden of housing 
the nation's nuclear waste dump. So far, no action has been taken on that 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Finding a suitable site for a permanent nuclear waste facility has been a major 
priority for the nuclear industry and for nuclear power supporters within the 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Energy plan, 70,000 metric tons of deadly waste 
from commercial nuclear reactors and weapons plants would be buried 1,000 feet 
under Yucca Mountain, 100 miles north of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
A 116-mile grid of tunnels in the mountain's volcanic rock would house the 
waste repository. Steel canisters would hold the nuclear waste, which would 
come by truck or rail for 26 years. The site would be then be sealed. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials have said the mountain's geology and its remote location in a 
Nevada desert make it an ideal site for the waste dump. The rock must prevent 
radioactive leakage from reaching the underground water table for 10,000 years, 
when most of the radioactive elements will have decayed. 
</P>
<P>
Some scientists, however, have questioned the mountain's stability because 
several earthquake faults run through it. There is also concern about possible 
volcanic activity in the area. And some scientists have said fractures in the 
volcanic rock might allow moisture to seep through to the storage vault, where 
it could corrode the steel waste canisters. 
</P>
<P>
If this scenario occurred, it could introduce radioactive materials into the 
water table, which stretches across the California border to Death Valley 
National Monument, 25 miles to the west. 
</P>
<P>
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins has been stymied in efforts to persuade 
Nevada to grant the air- and land-use permits required to begin work sinking 
exploratory shafts in the mountain to determine the geologic suitability of the 
site. The Nevada Legislature also passed a bill earlier this year declaring 
that no high-level nuclear waste could be buried in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The delays will clearly compound waste storage problems already faced by the 
nation's 114 commercial plants. Nuclear utilities have contributed nearly $4 
billion toward construction of the dump. 
</P>
<P>
With previous delays already postponing the estimated opening of the repository 
for five years, operators at many of the plants are running out of storage 
space for the deadly waste and have been forced to expand temporary facilities 
for storing the waste on their property -- an expensive undertaking shouldered 
by consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Loux said the developments Tuesday amount to a major restructuring of the 
Department of Energy's Yucca Mountain program.

A Republican legislative aide, whose refusal to become an FBI informant in 1988 
triggered a raid of Capitol offices, pleaded guilty Tuesday to extorting 
$12,500 in payments from an undercover agent on behalf of GOP Assembly members. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing in U.S. District Court, the aide, 42-year-old Karin Watson, formally 
agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors in their continuing political 
corruption investigation in exchange for reduced charges and a recommendation 
of leniency in sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the Republican legislators who received the money solicited by 
Watson were not included in a brief court statement describing her offense. 
</P>
<P>
However, the amount and timing of the payments described in court filings 
correspond to $10,000 in campaign contributions that former Assembly Republican 
Leader Pat Nolan of Glendale reported receiving June 29, 1988, and a $2,500 
honorarium that Assemblyman Frank Hill of Whittier reported accepting June 27, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Hill nor Nolan could be reached for comment Tuesday. However, Nolan's 
office issued a statement quoting Nolan as saying that Watson's guilty plea 
came "as a total and complete surprise." Nolan said, "I have always demanded 
the highest ethical and moral standards of my staff and in my work with Karin I 
have never seen her engage in an unethical act." 
</P>
<P>
Watson is a $58,428-a-year legislative consultant who last year worked closely 
with Nolan and Hill, both leaders of the Assembly Republican caucus at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Her decision to cooperate with prosecutors represents a significant advance in 
the political corruption probe that began in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Following Watson's guilty plea, U.S. Atty. David F. Levi said the legislative 
aide had already provided prosecutors with a detailed statement of her 
activities on behalf of lawmakers. And he acknowledged that Watson's 
cooperation has been valuable to investigators, hinting that it could lead to 
future indictments before she is scheduled for sentencing in six months. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to assume we only enter into (plea-bargain) agreements if we believe 
they are of value to us," Levi said. 
</P>
<P>
He said prosecutors deliberately omitted the names of legislators. "There is no 
reason to name people and injure careers until a formal charge is filed," Levi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hill and Nolan have been repeatedly identified by those familiar with 
the federal corruption probe as targets of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
As a Republican legislative consultant and a one-time key confidante of 
Assembly GOP leaders, Watson is in a position to describe in detail efforts to 
raise funds for political campaigns and to garner honorariums, such as speaking 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities first confronted Watson with their case against her on Aug. 
24, 1988, according to several sources familiar with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting lasting several hours, FBI agents told Watson of a Capitol sting 
operation that had begun in 1986. In the sting, agents posing as Southern 
businessmen tried to win support for special interest bills that supposedly 
would help their phony companies set up a shrimp processing plant near 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
In that 1988 meeting, the FBI urged Watson to become an undercover informant in 
the sting. 
</P>
<P>
But Watson repeatedly denied that she had done anything wrong and refused to 
cooperate with federal authorities, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Watson then knew of the sting, the prosecutors decided to bring the 
undercover phase of the corruption probe to an abrupt end. Armed with search 
warrants, about 30 agents swept through the Capitol and searched the offices of 
Watson, Hill and Nolan, as well as Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) and a Moore aide, Tyrone Netters. 
Former Sen. Paul Carpenter (D-Cypress), now a member of the State Board of 
Equalization, has also been named as a sting target. And sources close to the 
investigation say federal investigators continue to look at the activities of 
Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana). 
</P>
<P>
However, until Watson's guilty plea, the only Capitol figures to have been 
charged were Montoya and his ex-aide, Amiel A. Jaramillo. Both have pleaded 
innocent. Montoya is scheduled to go on trial Monday. 
</P>
<P>
According to a statement attested to in court by Watson, beginning in April of 
1988 she met frequently with another legislative aide -- apparently Senate 
Democratic staffer John Shahabian -- to discuss "how much money would be needed 
in order to have the assemblymen support the proposed legislation. . . . Ms. 
Watson indicated on several occasions that approximately $10,000 would be 
divided among certain assemblymen for their support." 
</P>
<P>
Shahabian had begun cooperating with federal authorities after he was 
confronted with evidence that he had extorted money from undercover FBI agents. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Shahabian, Watson arranged the meetings -- on June 27 and 
June 29 -- during which the Republican legislators she worked for received a 
total of $12,500 in campaign contributions or honorariums from the 
"businessmen." 
</P>
<P>
The court documents also state that she made false statements to law 
enforcement authorities at the August, 1988, meeting when she was first 
confronted with the evidence against her. 
</P>
<P>
However, prosecutors agreed not to charge Watson with making the false 
statement as part of the plea-bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of that agreement, prosecutors will recommend that she serve no 
prison time but instead be sentenced to no more than six months in a half-way 
house. The maximum penalty for extortion is 20 years in prison and a fine of 
$250,000. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Edward J. Garcia is free to decide on a more severe 
sentence. In that case, Watson would be able to withdraw her guilty plea and 
any statements she made to federal investigators could not be used against her 
in court.

FREE-CHOICE SCHOOLING GETS AN 'A' IN RICHMOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

RICHMOND, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until a year and a half ago, Myron Ho attended a private school. Now he is a 
seventh-grader at Adams Middle School in the once-declining Richmond Unified 
School District, and his parents couldn't be happier. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a lot more choices here; there are always new challenges," said Myron's 
mother, Patti Ho, who turned to the public school system because she and her 
husband were allowed to choose which of the district's schools they felt would 
be best for their son. 
</P>
<P>
Yvonne Smith pulled her son, Tashyia, 13, out of his neighborhood school, where 
he was getting Fs and "hanging around certain elements. Now he's earning A's at 
Adams. 
</P>
<P>
Since reopening two years ago as a school for gifted and talented sixth-, 
seventh- and eighth-graders, Adams has become a showcase for proponents of an 
increasingly popular movement to let parents choose among public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond Unified is the only district in California to have fully embraced the 
much-debated parental choice concept. While the program has its critics, both 
parents and school officials say choice has produced dramatic improvements. In 
the two years since the choice system began, enrollment has been climbing, 
unexcused absences have dropped by 50%, suspensions are down by 60% and 
achievement scores have been rising dramatically, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In California Assessment Program standardized test results for eighth-graders 
released earlier this month, Richmond's students scored a combined average of 
241 points. That is still below the statewide average of 263. But the 
district's three-year improvement of 29 points is well ahead of the state 
average growth of 16 points. Results for other grade levels were similar. 
</P>
<P>
"Choice brought students back into school district," said Adams Principal Myra 
Silverman, who has a long waiting list for the school's program of basic 
academics bolstered by about 300 electives. 
</P>
<P>
This week Richmond is host to the last of five meetings held by U.S. Education 
Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos, who has called parental choice the "cornerstone to 
restructuring" public education. 
</P>
<P>
Attended by about 1,000 parents, educators and policy-makers, the three-day 
conference that began Tuesday in this East San Francisco Bay Area city provides 
a way for the Bush Administration to stump for open enrollment as the premier 
means of improving public schools. 
</P>
<P>
The free-market, low-cost aspects of the choice system of educational reform 
have drawn support from conservatives and from parents frustrated with having 
little or no say over where their children go to school. Some liberals have 
also embraced it as an avenue for improving educational opportunities for 
children of the poor, who often are stuck at problem-riddled inner-city 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Still others see choice as a means of improving parental involvement in their 
children's education. As parents become more knowledgeable about schools and 
begin choosing among them, schools will be forced to improve in order to 
compete for students, proponents of choice believe. 
</P>
<P>
The choice system is not admired by all, however, and debate over it continues 
up and down California, much as it does in the rest of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Gabrielle Moore, president of United Teachers of Richmond, the teachers union, 
said she is not opposed to the concept, but she strenuously takes issue with 
the way choice was implemented in the district. 
</P>
<P>
"This program was imposed on the district by the superintendent," she said. 
"Neither teachers nor parents had any input." 
</P>
<P>
The plan is also severely limited, she said, because the district provides 
transportation only at Adams. Without transportation, which can be costly, 
moving out of a neighborhood school is not a realistic choice for many of the 
district's children, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Johnson, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, echoed that sentiment, 
saying that "a lot of kids realistically have no choice" if transportation and 
other problems inhibit their movement to other schools. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles) raises the same objection, saying 
the program abandons, for the most part, the children who are most in need. The 
poorest, minority inner-city students are most often left behind, he said. 
</P>
<P>
An outspoken critic of choice, Hawkins dispatched aides to the Richmond 
conference to distribute leaflets spelling out his objections. 
</P>
<P>
"The congressman felt it was important that the other side of this issue be 
heard here tonight," said one Hawkins aide who was passing out pamphlets. 
</P>
<P>
Other critics, such as Supt. Leonard Britton of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, suspect that choice is a vehicle for parents to avoid integration or 
to abandon average or troubled schools, leaving the students who remain in even 
worse straits. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also questions whether it can work in a system as vast as the 
600,000-student, 708-square-mile Los Angeles system. The district must also 
grapple with overcrowding and desegregation problems, which could be aggravated 
if parents, who long have had some limited choices through the district's 
system of specialized magnet schools, are given free rein. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond's relatively new experiment with open enrollment has already sparked 
enthusiasm and positive results, proponents say. 
</P>
<P>
The East Bay district, which includes El Cerrito, Pinole and San Pablo as well 
as Richmond, began its experiment with choice in 1987 shortly after Walter L. 
Marks took over as superintendent and sold the concept to his school board. 
</P>
<P>
Having implemented open enrollment programs in Montclair, N.J., and Raleigh, 
N.C., Marks saw choice as a way to improve the district's troubled schools. 
</P>
<P>
District scores on state achievement tests had been declining for years and 
were well below state averages. The financially troubled district, with an 
ethnic composition of 37% black, 33% Anglo, 16% Asian and 13% Latino, was also 
plagued by low attendance and a high rate of student suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
Today, 48 of the Richmond district's 50 schools are on open enrollment. Besides 
schools for the gifted and talented, there are campuses offering classical 
studies, future studies, applied arts, international studies, language, visual 
and performing arts, mathematics, science and technology, and Montessori and 
university laboratory programs. 
</P>
<P>
There are also several "alternative education" programs aimed at dropouts, 
students with academic and disciplinary problems and house-bound pupils. All 
schools offer a core program of reading and language arts, math, sciences and 
history and social studies. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the explosion of options to choose from, only about 4,000 of the 
district's 30,000 students have taken advantage of the open enrollment program. 
District officials expect that number to rise dramatically in the next couple 
of years as students move from one school level to another and parents become 
more familiar with the system. 
</P>
<P>
State laws allow districts to have open enrollment programs and provide for 
transfers between districts based on such factors as child-care needs, parents' 
job sites and a need for specialized schools not available in a student's own 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Some districts have begun limited programs of choice, including the San Juan 
Unified School District in Sacramento County, which has 11 of its 51 schools 
operating under open enrollment, and the San Jose Unified School District, 
which has allowed open enrollment and magnet schools to help it comply with a 
court-ordered desegregation plan. 
</P>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig praises choice as a way of 
offering "black, Asian and Hispanic Californians an entirely new dimension in 
educational opportunity within our public school system." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration frequently cites an August Gallup Poll that found a 2-1 
margin of support for allowing parents to choose which public schools their 
children will attend. But the poll also found that only 21% of those surveyed 
believed open enrollment would help all schools. About half felt parental 
choice would help some schools while hurting others. 
</P>
<P>
Despite dramatic gains in student performance, school officials acknowledge 
that the district still has a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
"The important fact here is that (district test) scores had been on a steady 
decline for several years, and we have turned that downward trend around," 
Richmond Supt. Marks said. "We have a lot of work to do, but we are heading in 
the right direction now."

HIGH WINDS TOPPLE TRUCKS, KNOCK OUT POWER, FAN FIRES

Strong Santa Ana winds raked Southern California on Tuesday -- particularly in 
San Bernardino and Orange counties -- toppling big rigs on freeways, knocking 
out electricity to tens of thousands of homes and fanning brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
Just after dawn, gusts up to 50 m.p.h. prompted closure of Interstate 15 
between Highland Avenue and Interstate 215 near Devore in San Bernardino County 
for more than three hours. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol reported that wind blasts tipped several 
high-profile vehicles on their sides in Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
Two were house trailers and the others were commercial tractor-trailer rigs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's blowing like mad," said CHP Officer Dale Clark in San Bernardino. "The 
Santa Anas are back with us again." 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service reported sustained winds of 43 m.p.h. in Fontana 
and up to 39 m.p.h., with gusts to 51 m.p.h., at Sandberg in the Tehachapi 
Mountains. Sustained winds of 40 m.p.h. and gusts in the 60-m.p.h. range were 
recorded at Laguna Park, east of Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers of high-sided campers and trailers from Santa Barbara to Orange County 
were warned to proceed with extreme caution. Motorists in the southern San 
Joaquin Valley were warned of the additional hazard of blowing dust. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more unusual wind-related events of the day occurred on California 
60, west of Riverside, where a wind-driven rock crashed through the rear window 
of a CHP car. 
</P>
<P>
"The officer was just driving along on the freeway, and all of a sudden, 
kathunk, a rock came through his back window," said CHP spokesman John Anderson 
in Riverside. "The window's shattered, but the officer's fine." 
</P>
<P>
Wind-related power outages affected an estimated 40,000 Southern California 
Edison Co. customers from early Monday to Tuesday afternoon, according to 
utility spokesman Kevin Kelley. Most of the outages were in the San Bernardino 
and Ontario areas, in Orange County and in the Simi Valley and Oxnard areas of 
Ventura County, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 customers of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power were 
blacked out Tuesday, with a heavy concentration of outages in Sylmar and 
Chatsworth, according to DWP spokeswoman Dorothy Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
Downed lines sparked a brush fire in the Chatsworth area. 
</P>
<P>
There were also three brush fires near San Bernardino, two minor blazes in 
southwest Riverside County, three small fires in Ventura County and a large 
fire in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
By late Tuesday, firefighters had contained a blaze that scorched about 3,000 
acres 20 miles north of downtown San Diego. Several ranch homes were evacuated 
as more than 300 firefighters battled the flames with the aid of water-dropping 
helicopters. But no homes were damaged, fire officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
In San Bernardino, Battalion Chief John Benfield said the most troublesome 
blaze burned about 120 acres on Little Mountain, about five miles north of 
downtown. Thick smoke from the fire, which was controlled by 100 firefighters 
after several hours, swirled across Interstate 215, impairing visibility for a 
time and causing traffic tie-ups. 
</P>
<P>
In Riverside County, 15 engine companies battled a 20-acre fire burning in 
heavy brush and bamboo in the Santa Ana River bottom in the Mira Loma area 
Tuesday evening. Fire officials said no structures were threatened. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the winds uprooted trees, caused sporadic power outages and 
fanned a fire that broke out in a manure pile near a riding stable. 
</P>
<P>
At the Marine Corps Air Station in El Toro, winds were blamed for causing 
"spontaneous combustion" in piles of horse manure belonging to a fertilizer 
firm. Marine Corp Maj. Jim McClain said the fire broke out about 3:15 a.m. near 
the base's riding stables, creating a heavy pall of smoke that blew directly 
into a nearby housing project. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents were evacuated to the El Toro Marine School until the blaze was 
extinguished about two hours later. 
</P>
<P>
The hot, dry winds were also blamed for a roof fire that caused $50,000 damage 
to a house in Yorba Linda. Burning embers from the chimney ignited the shingles 
of a residence in the 4500 block of Plumosa Drive, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In Mission Viejo, the planned groundbreaking ceremony for the start of the 
$15.5-million Oso Parkway extension was canceled because of high winds. Plans 
called for shuttling guests up to a hilltop vista to view the 1.7-mile route. 
</P>
<P>
"The caterer suggested that there have been gusts up to 40 m.p.h. in the area," 
one organizer said. "You just got a lot of loose dirt in the area, and it would 
have been difficult to have any formal ceremony under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Prospects for almost everything affected by weather should improve today, 
according to weather forecasters, because the high winds are expected to taper 
off. 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologist Rick Dittman of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for 
The Times, predicted that the high-pressure area over the Great Basin that 
created the rush of winds toward the ocean will start to weaken. 
</P>
<P>
The mercury reached a high of 75 at the Los Angeles Civic Center on Tuesday. 
Relative humidity ranged from 51% to 15%. Forecasters said the high should 
reach 80 today.

Government forces in Peru are using "terror to fight terror" and have killed 
3,000 people in the last seven years using the same brutal tactics as their 
opponents, the human rights group Amnesty International said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Torture, mutilation, 'disappearance,' murder and rape have become a hallmark 
of the armed forces' 'campaign against terrorism,' " the organization said in a 
report on Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Peruvian troops are fighting against the Maoist Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) 
rebel group. 
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 detainees have disappeared in the past seven years, and at 
least 3,000 more are estimated to have been killed by security forces, 
individually or in mass executions, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Amnesty International called on the government of Peru to investigate and 
prosecute all cases of disappearances, extrajudicial executions, torture and 
rape by its forces. 
</P>
<P>
It also stressed the extensive and continuing massacres and torture by 
opposition forces such as Shining Path.

GANDHI RESIGNS; OPPOSITION GOVERNMENT SEEN;

<P>
INDIA: THE PRIME MINISTER'S PARTY LOST ITS PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY IN LAST 
WEEK'S ELECTIONS.

<P>
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi resigned today, apparently clearing the way for an 
opposition government, after his ruling party suffered its second-most 
humiliating defeat in four decades in national elections now viewed as a 
watershed in Indian politics. 
</P>
<P>
Gandhi's resignation, which he personally delivered to India's largely 
ceremonial President Ramaswamy Ventkataraman this morning, was seen by several 
analysts as a strong indication that the ruling Congress-I party had resigned 
itself to a new role in the opposition for only the second time in four 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
With almost all of the results now counted in the parliamentary elections that 
ended Sunday, Gandhi's party had won just 190 seats in the 543-member 
Parliament. However, none of the three major opposition blocs had secured a 
majority either. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition, led by Gandhi's defense minister, Vishwanath Pratap Singh, was 
to meet later today in an effort to chose a prime ministerial candidate who 
could lead a minority government. The new government already has been 
guaranteed support from the country's extreme right- and left-wing minority 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation of the 45-year-old prime minister had been expected for the 
past two days, after the election returns made it clear that Congress-I had 
lost its majority for only the second time since Indian independence in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
President Ventkataraman asked Gandhi to stay on as a caretaker prime minister 
until the president selects the party that will form a new government. Gandhi 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
The president also accepted the resignations of Gandhi's Cabinet ministers, who 
will also stay on until a new government is formed. 
</P>
<P>
As Gandhi was meeting with the president, the election commission announced 
that Gandhi had retained his own seat in Parliament by a margin of 200,000 
votes. But Gandhi's official resignation merely capped a grim week of reckoning 
for the ruling party. Many analysts saw the elections as a total rejection of 
the family dynasty that has ruled Indian virtually without challenge for 42 
years. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, even the family and co-conspirators in the assassination of 
Gandhi's mother were swept into office. 
</P>
<P>
Five years after bodyguard Beant Singh shot and killed Prime Minister Indira 
Gandhi, his widow, Bimal Kaur Khalsa, was declared a member of the Indian 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The assassin's father, Sucha Singh, was also declared a winner. 
</P>
<P>
In perhaps the ultimate rebuke to four decades of dynastic rule, voters in the 
north Indian state of Punjab also delivered equally huge parliamentary 
victories for the two men accused of masterminding the assassination. Both had 
campaigned from prison. 
</P>
<P>
As the political opposition sought to form a minority government, expected to 
be unveiled today or Thursday, it became clear that the voters had repudiated 
one of the longest-serving political dynasties in the modern world. 
</P>
<P>
"To borrow a phrase from the old British Empire, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi 
has just presided over the liquidation of a dynasty," analyst Rajni Kothari 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rajiv Gandhi inherited the leadership of the Congress-I party from his mother, 
Indira, and his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister after 
independence in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as Mrs. Beant Singh is concerned," Prof. Kothari said, "her victory 
certainly is an assertion of that anger toward the ruling family." 
</P>
<P>
There were other signs that India's increasingly sophisticated voters finally 
have lost faith in the Gandhi family. 
</P>
<P>
Maneka Gandhi, the 33-year-old widow of Indira Gandhi's son Sanjay, also scored 
an overwhelming victory, seven years after her mother-in-law threw her out of 
the house and publicly declared her "Family Enemy No. 1" for challenging party 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
Arun Nehru, a cousin of Rajiv who publicly split with the family two years ago, 
also won a seat in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
But as symbols go, analysts said, the victories of the relatives of Indira 
Gandhi's assassins are the most dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
All are members of the Sikh community, which for the past decade has been torn 
apart by a secessionist movement in the state of Punjab, where Sikhs 
predominate. And at least half of those elected to Parliament in Punjab are 
either members of or sympathizers with the Sikh secessionist movement. One is a 
terrorist who has confessed to public bombings and at least one airline 
hijacking. 
</P>
<P>
Beant Singh and Satwant Singh (no relative), his accomplice in the killing of 
Indira Gandhi, were both Sikhs. One was killed by other guards just after the 
shooting, and the other was hanged last year. 
</P>
<P>
Hindu mobs took to the streets after the assassination, and thousands of Sikhs 
were killed. But no one was convicted during Rajiv Gandhi's five years in 
power. Several members of the Congress-I party are believed to have been 
involved, and at least one was defeated last week. 
</P>
<P>
Many Sikhs said they were voting against the ruling party as a way of 
protesting. 
</P>
<P>
"The vote, you see, is also an indication that the Sikhs are still in great 
anguish," Prof. Kothari said. "It is an assertion against the ruling family 
that declares: 'You have not yet punished the guilty. You have only hanged the 
assassins.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kothari is one of many analysts who see the election of secessionists and the 
family and friends of assassins as something more than symbolic. They say it is 
a potentially positive sign for the strife-torn state of Punjab, where fighting 
over the secession issue has left thousands dead in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly some of the voting is a severe rebuke to the ruling family, but the 
fact that it took place in the parliamentary process and not in street killings 
is very reassuring and encouraging," Kothari said. "This will isolate the very 
hard core of the terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
Kushwant Singh, a Sikh newspaper columnist, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this can be construed as a vote for (independence) or any other 
such thing," said Singh, who is considered a moderate on the secessionist 
issue. "This is just a very angry vote." 
</P>
<P>
Kothari said the best indication that the Punjab results augur well for the 
state's future was in the way the election was carried out. 
</P>
<P>
"In an election where a record number of killings, fraud and vote rigging took 
place almost everywhere else in the country, one must note that the most 
peaceful poll of all was in Punjab," he said. "So in Punjab it was not just a 
vote for change. Strange as it may seem, I really think it was a vote for 
peace."

The Soviet Parliament on Tuesday approved a plan that apparently returns 
control of the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan, but it 
also ordered the republic to work closely with the Armenian majority in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Armenian deputies walked out of the hall when the directive on the 
Nagorno-Karabakh region was approved at a closed meeting on the final day of 
the Supreme Soviet's fall session. 
</P>
<P>
The neighboring republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia have been waging a bloody 
dispute over the region. It is located entirely within the borders of Muslim 
Azerbaijan, but its Christian Armenians outnumber Azerbaijanis by 4 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
A special Kremlin commission was formed in January to impose order on the 
region, where more than 60 people have died in ethnic clashes since February, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The directive that was passed by the legislature eliminated the commission, 
which was headed by Arkady Volsky. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wanted to talk about it; no one understood it," said Zuri Balayan, an 
ethnic Armenian from Nagorno-Karabakh, in a telephone interview. He was one of 
the deputies who walked out of the hall. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it passed by a wide margin. Balayan said more than 350 deputies 
voted for it, only four voted against it and 20 abstained. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what the likely effect of the directive will be, Balayan said only, 
"We'll wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute has been one of the sources of continuous tension between the two 
Caucasus republics in the southern part of the Soviet Union, and despite the 
presence of soldiers, some reports have warned of a virtual state of civil war.

The Bush Administration is sending Poland's new Solidarity-backed government 
just what some people say it doesn't need -- another delegation of high-level 
VIPs. 
</P>
<P>
The visitors, who are scheduled to arrive late today on a special Air Force 
jet, include three U.S. Cabinet officers -- Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. 
Yeutter, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher and Labor Secretary Elizabeth 
Hanford Dole -- and Michael Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of 
Economic Advisers. Accompanying them will be AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland 
and a bevy of top U.S. business executives. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials concede privately that the visit was designed more for 
domestic political reasons in the United States than a pressing need on the 
part of the Poles. 
</P>
<P>
Early in October, the White House was searching for a way to underscore its 
admonition to Congress that "throwing money" at Poland wasn't the only way to 
help it solve its economic problems. Someone came up with an idea: Why not send 
a team of Cabinet officers and business leaders to survey the situation and 
provide the Poles with advice? 
</P>
<P>
Even with the stiff transatlantic rates charged by the Air Force, it sounded 
like a bargain -- compared to the extra $600 million that Congress wanted to 
appropriate for greater aid to Poland. 
</P>
<P>
But the high-level visit will consume three full days and the personal 
attention of Poland's key Cabinet ministers at a time when the Poles themselves 
urgently need to finish hammering out their special economic and domestic 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz is in the final stage of complex 
negotiations with the International Monetary Fund over a crucial economic loan 
that he hopes will be approved in late November or early December. The 
government's new plan for privatizing the economy is due out in early December 
as well. And Poland is slated to start its sweeping new economic restructuring 
program in early January -- only a few weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
To add to the troubles, the new Solidarity government is paper-thin. It is 
composed of a handful of Cabinet ministers and aides who until recently were 
professors and labor activists, inexperienced in getting a new government off 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"All we have is 10 ministers at the top, a few deputy ministers and no heads of 
departments," said Jacek Szymanderski, head of the fledgling Solidarity Polish 
Peasants' Party, an offshoot of Lech Walesa's original group. The rest of 
Poland's government are leftovers from the Communist days -- men who have 
neither the training nor the inclination to carry out Solidarity's programs. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all of the new Solidarity ministers have been working nearly around 
the clock to get their new policies in shape. Krzysztof Lis, the undersecretary 
of finance, who has been drafting the new industry privatization program, has 
been putting in 16- to 20-hour days. 
</P>
<P>
This week's American delegation isn't the only one that the Poles have had in 
recent weeks. Since its start in September, the new Solidarity government has 
been distracted by a seemingly endless string of VIP visits from other donor 
countries, ranging from West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Jacques Delors, 
president of the European Community. Last week, a delegation of Swiss members 
of Parliament was here. 
</P>
<P>
"They are almost bumping into one another at the airport," lamented a Polish 
official who helps arrange such official visits. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to VIPs, there are visiting journalists. They require far less 
hoopla, but nevertheless take up ministers' time. 
</P>
<P>
Western governments "have so deluged Poland with delegations that we may end up 
killing the new government by giving its top ministers heart attacks," wryly 
warned Gregory Vaut, director of the Warsaw-based Foundation for the 
Development of Polish Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Vaut cited a string of visits by congressional delegations: "Each of them 
includes 12 members of Congress and their wives, and they all want to get Lech 
Walesa's signature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration itself is not united about the wisdom of this week's 
mission. Back-corridor bureaucrats, borrowing the title of a novel and movie, 
already have irreverently dubbed the entourage the "Ship of Fools."

FOREIGN POLICY: PERESTROIKA, INTENDED TO CHANGE THE SOVIET UNION, IS PAYING

<P>
When Mikhail S. Gorbachev assumed the leadership of the Soviet Union almost 
five years ago, he set out to transform the country and stem the collapse of 
its political and economic system. In the process, he has begun reshaping world 
politics as well. 
</P>
<P>
The reforms that Gorbachev undertook have dramatically altered the Soviet 
Union's relations with the West, turning what President Ronald Reagan called 
the "evil empire" into what President Bush now hails as a "partner for peace." 
</P>
<P>
Warming to the charismatic Soviet leader and his efforts to replace the 
totalitarian system that had existed since the time of the dictator Josef 
Stalin with political pluralism and a market economy, the West saw Gorbachev, 
as British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher put it first, as "a man we can do 
business with." 
</P>
<P>
The changes Gorbachev is attempting at home -- the Communist Party's 
progressive sharing of power, the freeing of the Soviet economy from rigid 
central planning, the opening to the outside world, the growing respect for 
human rights -- have fascinated the West and increasingly diminished its 
long-held perception of the "Soviet threat." 
</P>
<P>
With their growing resonance in other socialist countries, even in such 
formerly hard-line states as East Germany and Bulgaria, Gorbachev's reforms now 
promise to bring historic change to Europe and to East-West relations as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
Perestroika, begun as an effort to pull the Soviet Union out of two decades of 
political, economic and social stagnation, has brought Moscow more prestige and 
influence than its military might did. And what was an urgent necessity in 
terms of domestic policy has become an unexpected virtue in foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Appraising their country's position in the world, Soviet leaders and foreign 
affairs specialists are able to argue that their reforms are creating a 
political watershed on the eve of the 21st Century, not only for their country 
and other socialist countries but virtually around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"We see that many countries and people in the world are responding actively and 
positively to perestroika," Alexander N. Yakovlev, a member of the Communist 
Party's ruling Politburo and one of Gorbachev's closest advisers, said recently 
on a visit to Tokyo. "It is tackling not only the problems of Soviet society; 
it is also looking for answers to the questions faced by the whole 
international community." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of these shifts, Gorbachev goes to his first summit meeting with 
President Bush off Malta this weekend with confidence that a new relationship 
is developing not only between the Soviet Union and the United States but 
between East and West, a relationship that Soviet officials see ending the Cold 
War and forming the basis of a new international order. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in one of the greatest moments of the 20th Century," Leonid N. 
Dobrokhotov, a senior official in the Communist Party's policy-making Central 
Committee, said in an interview. "A fundamental revolution in people's 
mentality has occurred. . . . Our relations with the United States will not -- 
cannot -- return to what they were for so many years. . . . And on that basis, 
we can honestly look forward to further changes in international relations." 
</P>
<P>
Tired of the Cold War years of nuclear threat and stalemate, the West has 
welcomed the changes in the Soviet Union's foreign policy under Gorbachev -- 
his substitution of a "balance of interests" for the old balance of power, the 
abandonment of confrontation in search of cooperation and the end of "class 
struggle" -- as the basis for Soviet actions around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"We can take pride in the fact that our new revolution acts as a locomotive of 
positive change in the world and has a favorable effect on world politics, 
warming the international climate," Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign 
minister, told a legislative committee reviewing the country's foreign policy 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, we see the signs of the consolidation of all mankind in response to the 
threats -- nuclear, economic and ecological -- to our civilization. This is the 
only way to our survival. The sooner this is understood, the greater our 
chances for salvation." 
</P>
<P>
Brought together as "new political thinking," the far-reaching changes in 
Soviet foreign policy have given Moscow considerable leverage on most 
international issues. Under Gorbachev, the Soviet Union generally takes the 
initiative, leaving the West to match it in pragmatism and willingness to 
rethink old positions. 
</P>
<P>
Georgy A. Arbatov, the veteran director of the Institute for the Study of the 
United States and Canada and an influential member of the party Central 
Committee, calls this the "Gorbachev challenge." 
</P>
<P>
"We take what we call our 'new political thinking' right to the people," 
Arbatov said. "We want them to see what we are proposing and to compare it to 
what has existed for so long, to what others are proposing. . . . And people 
have begun to see that we are not doomed to live under that modern sword of 
Damocles -- the threat of nuclear war." 
</P>
<P>
The term "new political thinking" is summed up by Yuri A. Krasin, rector of the 
party's Institute of Social Sciences, as starting from "an overall change in 
outlook on security, moving from the balance of forces to a balance of 
interests, from force and the threat of force to confidence and trust, from the 
projection of military power to sufficient defense." 
</P>
<P>
"What we have realized and are trying to get others to share," he told a 
military conference here not long ago, "is that no real security is obtainable 
in this age without a general agreement that is based on trust . . . but for 
trust to work, we need sweeping changes in international relations." 
</P>
<P>
Recalling the theory of an escalating thermonuclear conflict developed during 
the Cold War by the late American strategist Herman Kahn, Krasin proposed "a 
reverse model" of de-escalation, characterized by unilateral moves to signal 
good will and then by reciprocal and mutual measures. 
</P>
<P>
Andrei A. Kokoshin, a political scientist at the U.S.A. Institute here, said 
that in the searching reappraisal that came with Gorbachev's assumption of the 
leadership, the Soviet Union realized that the West's military strength, 
although growing, was not the greatest threat to Soviet national survival. 
</P>
<P>
A greater threat, particularly to the Soviet Union's posture as a great power, 
stemmed, he said, from the gap between its scientific-technical level and that 
of the West, and from its failure to improve living standards through economic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
'Cost Us a Lot' 
</P>
<P>
"Military parity (with the United States) was a key guarantee of national 
security, but it cost us a lot in sacrifice and expenditures," Kokoshin said. 
"It also left us vulnerable in other ways, some of them unforeseen, and today 
we attach priority to political means in ensuring our national security." 
</P>
<P>
Although the greatest impact of Moscow's foreign policy reorientation has been 
on Soviet-American relations and, more broadly, on the whole East-West 
relationship, Soviet officials quickly tick off other changes of considerable 
consequence in the past two years. Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
"In setting Eastern Europe 'free,' we also freed ourselves," a foreign policy 
adviser to Gorbachev said, asking not to be quoted by name. "The prestige of 
socialism is enhanced; no one talks any longer about 'satellites' or the 'Iron 
Curtain.' We are not burdened with their mistakes, nor they with ours. 
Recognizing the right of every nation to choose its political and economic 
system freely was not only the moral thing to do, it was the politically smart 
thing. . . . In the long run, we will be drawn together by natural interests, 
and that will be a far healthier and stronger basis for relations. As the 
confrontation with the West is reduced, our security is increased. Already we 
are planning the transformation of the Warsaw Pact into a political grouping to 
help us manage the transition away from confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
Western Europe, where Gorbachev regularly ranks in opinion polls as the world's 
most popular political figure, is rapidly adjusting its vision of the future to 
include a democratized Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Gorbachev, who visited 
Britain, Finland, France and West Germany before his current trip to Italy and 
the Vatican, has won considerable support for what he calls "the common 
European home," a new Europe no longer divided into armed camps but united 
through shared values and such goals as disarmament, economic cooperation and 
environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
The long estrangement between China and the Soviet Union was ended with 
Gorbachev's trip to Beijing in May. The rapprochement reflected not only 
Moscow's acknowledgment that every socialist country had to find its own way 
but its willingness to resolve outstanding disputes with Beijing. The benefit 
to Moscow was great -- the further reduction of tension along the 4,600-mile 
Sino-Soviet border, allowing for a substantial reduction in the forces it had 
stationed there for more than 20 years, and the prospect of economic 
cooperation that would bring development to Siberia and the Soviet Far East. 
</P>
<P>
In the Third World, the Soviet Union is limiting its exposure to what it can 
afford, politically as well as economically. No longer does it preach 
Soviet-style socialism as the best course for development, and no longer does 
it offer to underwrite such efforts with military and economic assistance on 
the vast scale of the 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet troops completed their withdrawal from Afghanistan in February, and 
after nine months, the Moscow-backed government of President Najibullah remains 
in place. Moscow assisted directly in the U.S. mediation effort that led to the 
recent elections in Namibia and the accompanying withdrawal of Cuban forces 
from Angola. And the Soviet Union continues to promote a political settlement 
of the conflict in Cambodia following the Vietnamese pullout there. 
</P>
<P>
"We have created some space for ourselves in which to maneuver," Andrei V. 
Nikiforov, the editor of the influential journal USA, said in an interview. 
"Gorbachev goes to Malta without nearly the problems he had pressing on him 18 
months ago when he met Reagan here, or even last year when he met Reagan and 
Bush in New York. Foreign policy no longer constricts us in the way it did for 
so many years. We have a new posture in the world today."

EAST BLOC UNABLE TO LAUNCH QUICK ATTACK, SECRET U.S. STUDY FINDS

The U.S. intelligence community, in a fundamental reassessment of the military 
balance in Europe, has concluded that for the past several years, the Soviet 
Union and its Warsaw Pact allies have been incapable of quickly launching a 
massive attack against the West. 
</P>
<P>
The finding is contained in a classified study for the secretary of defense 
completed before political reforms swept through Eastern Europe, an upheaval 
that officials say has further reduced the danger of an attack against the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization from the East. 
</P>
<P>
The study depicts as outdated two scenarios for war in Europe that drove the 
West to keep its forces at a high level of readiness over the past decade: a 
Soviet invasion with little advance preparation, the so-called standing start 
or bolt-out-of-the-blue attack, and a Soviet attack after only two weeks of 
mobilization. 
</P>
<P>
In the most likely circumstances for a Soviet attack, the study reports, "the 
intelligence community believes we would have some 33 to 44 days of warning 
time." This is a consensus judgment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the CIA and 
the Defense Intelligence Agency, the report said. In some cases, the West might 
know as far as six months in advance of a major war, the study stated.

DYING MAN'S EYE-BLINK SIGNALS SEND FRIEND TO JAIL FOR GUN PLAY

<P>
A man whose fatally wounded friend identified him as the assailant via 
eye-blinking signals was sentenced Tuesday to six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"God brought him back for a few moments to communicate with detectives," 
Westchester County Court Judge John LaCava said of the deathbed identification 
made by Frederick Sannicandro, 38. 
</P>
<P>
Sannicandro died six hours after his friend, Frank Zollbrecht, shot him in the 
abdomen as they were working in a Yonkers bakery last year. 
</P>
<P>
As Sannicandro was being wheeled into surgery, detectives and an attending 
physician questioned him about the shooting. They asked him to respond by 
blinking once for "yes" and twice for "no." 
</P>
<P>
Sannicandro blinked "yes" when asked if it was Zollbrecht who had shot him, and 
"no" as to whether the shooting was accidental, according to trial testimony. 
He could not speak because he had a breathing tube in his throat, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Zollbrecht had a history of heavy drinking, according to testimony. During 
drunken horseplay, he got a gun his boss had hidden and shot Sannicandro. 
</P>
<P>
The defense maintained that Sannicandro's deathbed testimony should not have 
been admitted as evidence because Sannicandro also was drunk at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Zollbrecht was found guilty of criminally negligent homicide and could have 
been sentenced to four years in prison. The judge ordered him to spend five 
years on probation after his prison term, to do 1,000 hours of community 
service and to get treatment for his psychological problems.

FDA APPROVES DRUG THAT QUICKLY DISSOLVES CLOTS AFTER HEART ATTACK

The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved a new drug that quickly 
dissolves blood clots to prevent permanent damage following a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
The drug, called anistreplase, is the third clot-dissolving drug to be 
approved. But its advantage is that it can be administered in five minutes or 
less while the other two must be administered continuously for one to three 
hours, according to SmithKline Beecham, which will market the drug as Eminase. 
</P>
<P>
Although clot-dissolving drugs can open blocked arteries and limit damage from 
heart attacks, they are used in only 20% or so of the estimated 400,000 to 
600,000 patients who could benefit from treatment each year, according to the 
Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 of the 1.5 million people who suffer heart attacks each year 
die before getting to the hospital and an additional 300,000 get there too late 
for treatment with clot-dissolving drugs, the department said in announcing the 
FDA action. 
</P>
<P>
"Ease and convenience of administration of anistreplase hopefully will lead to 
greater use of this life-saving thrombolytic therapy even in emergency rooms 
and small hospitals not equipped with sophisticated coronary care facilities," 
HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
A blood clot blocking one of the arteries to the heart is the most common cause 
of heart attacks. The clot prevents blood from carrying oxygen to the heart 
muscle.

Two young men were struck by a train and killed early Tuesday, apparently as 
they were writing graffiti, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Cans of spray paint were found near the bodies at the 59th Street subway 
station, Transit Police Officer Joseph Ciociola said. The victims were about 50 
feet south of a waiting platform. 
</P>
<P>
The train's motorman said he did not see the men as he pulled into the station, 
but the train braked automatically upon impact, Ciociola said.

GOVERNOR'S QUAKE PANEL GETS DOWN TO WORK; 
</P>
<P>
DISASTER: THE GOAL IS TO FIND OUT WHY THE NIMITZ FREEWAY AND THE BAY BRIDGE 
COLLAPSED, AND TO HELP SHAPE THE DESIGN OF NEW STRUCTURES.

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian on Tuesday convened his special commission to 
investigate the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway and the Bay Bridge in the 
Northern California earthquake, asking the board to determine why the failures 
occurred and whether they could have been prevented. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of our state are entitled to a comprehensive, thorough and 
objective examination of the failure of these structures," Deukmejian told the 
panel. "Your goal is to find out the facts and to give us recommendations for 
steps that we should take so that this tragic chapter in our state's history 
will not be repeated." 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Inquiry, as the 11-member panel is officially known, is expected 
to examine whether the state did all it could to strengthen the elevated 
portion of the Nimitz Freeway in west Oakland against the forces of 
earthquakes. The 32-year-old structure was built before a 1971 earthquake in 
the San Fernando Valley prompted state engineers to rewrite their seismic 
design standards for bridges. 
</P>
<P>
The board's report, due by June 1, also will help shape the state's design of 
any new freeway structure built to replace the collapsed portion of the Nimitz. 
And the findings will guide an accelerated program to reinforce older bridges 
throughout the state, including several in San Francisco that are similar in 
design and vintage to the Nimitz. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's panel is chaired by retired Caltech professor George Hausner, a 
pioneer in earthquake engineering. It also includes professors from UC 
Berkeley, UC Davis, Caltech and USC, as well as two private engineers and three 
federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
Top Caltrans officials told the board that they still are not sure exactly what 
caused the collapse of the Cypress Viaduct on the Nimitz, which killed 42 
people. But they said they tend to agree with preliminary reports that blamed 
the collapse on the failed connections between the double-decked highway's 
upper and lower columns. 
</P>
<P>
James Gates, chief of the department's seismic and structural analysis unit, 
said it appears that the failure started toward the northern end of the 1 
1/4-mile-long structure and moved north and south from there. In almost every 
case, the column joints cracked and gave way in the same manner. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said the department is analyzing thousands of still photographs taken 
after the quake and will review California Highway Patrol interviews with 
scores of witnesses. A team of engineers is still at the site examining pieces 
of the structure as it is demolished. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Bay Bridge, James Roberts, chief of Caltrans' structures division, 
said a 50-foot span of the bridge collapsed after the structure moved 14 inches 
back and forth during the shaking, finally coming to rest five inches from its 
original position. The movement sheared two dozen inch-thick bolts, opening a 
gap through which the top span fell onto the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
The composition of the soil under both the Bay Bridge and the freeway is 
believed to have played a role in their collapse, because soft soils are known 
to amplify the ground motion caused by quakes. But the Caltrans engineers and 
geologists from the state Division of Mines and Geology gave different 
interpretations of the effect the soil had on the Nimitz disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Gates of Caltrans pointed out that most of the damage was on the portion of the 
freeway built on pilings sunk 50 to 60 feet through soft soil into hard sand. 
The collapse ended abruptly very near the point where the soil structure 
changed, and only minor damage occurred where the pilings were just 10 feet 
into the harder ground, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Anthony Shakal, supervising geologist for the Division of Mines and 
Geology, told the board that the connection between the damage pattern and the 
soil structure could be a coincidence. While the soft soils under the freeway 
amplified the ground shaking to a level four to five times that found on solid 
ground nearby, Shakal said the entire flat coastal area of Oakland experienced 
the stronger motions, not just the collapsed portion of the freeway.

HORSE BREEDER WINS IN HIGH-STAKES TAX DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a case followed statewide for its possible effect on the horse-breeding 
industry, a Ventura Superior Court judge has ruled in favor of a breeder from 
Lake Sherwood in a high-stakes dispute with the Ventura County tax assessor 
over the definition of a racehorse. 
</P>
<P>
The decision Monday by Judge Edwin M. Osborne entitles wealthy real estate 
developer David H. Murdock to a refund of about $115,000 in back taxes and 
interest for the year 1986-87. Challenges for other tax years back to 1981 
could bring Murdock's total rebate to $500,000 or more, according to Ventura 
County Assessor Jerry Sanford. 
</P>
<P>
But Sanford said Tuesday that he will appeal the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Murdock was not available for comment. His attorney, Richard Craigo, hailed the 
ruling as good news for all racehorse breeders. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the case were conflicting interpretations of a 1971 state law that 
gives tax breaks to owners of five racing breeds, including the blue-ribbon 
Arabians bred at Murdock's Ventura Farms. 
</P>
<P>
Horses ordinarily are taxed at 1% of their market value, the same as boats, 
planes and other personal property. But under a law aimed at boosting the 
state's horse-racing industry, racehorses qualify for lower taxes, with a 
ceiling of $1,000 a head. 
</P>
<P>
In Murdock's case, the county argued that some of his 200 Arabians were 
ineligible for the break because the animals were never entered in races, 
trained for races or registered with the state as racehorses. 
</P>
<P>
Murdock successfully contended, however, that a horse should be classified as a 
racer if it is merely eligible to race or produces a foal eligible to race. 
</P>
<P>
Horse-breeding experts differed Tuesday on the case's significance. 
</P>
<P>
Nat Gorham, editor of Arabian Horse World magazine in Palo Alto, said the case 
had limited importance because the valuations were made before changes in 
federal tax laws reduced the benefits of investing in horses. The resulting 
sharp drop in horse prices makes them less attractive as a source of property 
taxes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Sypolt, treasurer of the Arabian Racing Assn. of California, said the 
state's breeders closely watched the case because a decision against Murdock 
could have encouraged Ventura County's practices to spread.

TEXTS LABELED MORBID, EVIL WILL GO BACK TO PUBLISHER; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: EAST WHITTIER SCHOOL DISTRICT SAYS IT DID NOT RECEIVE THE BOOKS THAT 
WERE ADVERTISED BY THE PUBLISHER. SCHOOLS ARE SCRAMBLING TO FIND REPLACEMENT 
READING TEXTS.

<P>
East Whittier School District officials gathered cardboard boxes Tuesday to 
ship a controversial series of elementary school reading texts, labeled morbid 
and evil by some parents, back to the publisher. 
</P>
<P>
The district has also directed its lawyer to demand a $160,000 refund for the 
texts from publisher Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston of Canada Ltd., Supt. Dorothy 
Fagan said. 
</P>
<P>
The actions came after the school board met Monday night and decided during a 
long, closed-door session that the publisher breached its contract by sending 
the district books that were different from what it had advertised last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Officials for the publishing company said they would not comment on the matter 
until the firm's president returns from a business trip today and reviews the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
According to Janet Hoyt, curriculum coordinator for the 7,000-student district, 
many of the controversial stories -- including tales about monsters who 
decapitate children and about excrement-eating pigs -- were not in the sample 
editions district officials reviewed and approved. 
</P>
<P>
District administrators said they did not realize that they had received the 
wrong books until the controversy surfaced several weeks ago in the Hacienda La 
Puente Unified School District, where educators also received books different 
from those they had ordered. 
</P>
<P>
The Hacienda La Puente school board temporarily banned the books last month 
until the issue can be studied. The board is expected to hear a report at its 
Dec. 7 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, teachers and administrators in east Whittier are scrambling to find 
alternative texts. The district no longer has the books teachers used before 
the series, titled "Impressions," was purchased last spring, Hoyt said. 
</P>
<P>
The mix-up, school officials said, caught them by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like buying a Cadillac and getting a Ford," Fagan said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we don't have a text, and there's no money for new books," John Fulford, 
the president of the East Whittier Teachers' Assn., said. "Pulling the 
textbooks messes up every teacher's curriculum, and it will keep us dangling in 
the wind next year. This will take years to settle. They should have just left 
us alone to do our jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Some schools are using library books and reserve resource books, officials 
said. Other schools are trying to raise enough money to buy paperbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"The board made the decision and we respect that," Jenifer Mac Lowry, a 
third-grade teacher, said. "The teachers now are looking for ways to make the 
best out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Mac Lowry said a special book-selection committee, including teachers and 
district officials, spent three years reviewing texts before choosing the 
"Impressions" series. Starting over, she said, will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents in the Hacienda La Puente and the East Whittier districts have 
said the texts evoke devil worship and a curiosity in witchcraft. But some 
educators say the series stimulates children's interest in literature. 
</P>
<P>
During heated debates in both districts, the books have raised a conflict 
between 1st Amendment rights and parents' rights to censor what their children 
read. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a teacher and a parent," said Olivia Ramirez, who attended the 
standing-room-only school board meeting in east Whittier Monday night, "and I'd 
like to see the series banned. Stories like that are frightening for children. 
They have a hard time separating imagination from reality."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COLISEUM DANGLES THE BOTTOM LINE FOR DAVIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Coliseum Commission President Richard Riordan and two officials of 
Spectacor Management Group, the Coliseum's private managers, have told Al 
Davis, owner of the Los Angeles Raiders, that he could make far more money from 
a reconstructed Coliseum than he could if he moved the team to Oakland or 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting last week with Davis amid reports circulated by Raiders sources that 
Davis may announce a move north as early as next week, Riordan said Davis was 
told that sales of 180 new luxury boxes and 10,000 club seats in a new Coliseum 
to corporate and other buyers for up to $50 million would in effect match the 
franchise fees that Oakland and Sacramento interests have offered. 
</P>
<P>
Riordan said Davis had indicated he would like to hear more details. Davis did 
not return a telephone call seeking comment. However, various Raiders sources, 
asking not to be identified, have said that a deal is close to being 
consummated to move the team out of Los Angeles and could be announced next 
Monday or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sacramento sold $91.8 million in bonds Tuesday, with about half of 
that reserved to pay the Raiders the $50 million fee it has offered.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 17TH-CENTURY PAINTING RECOVERED; 2 ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff's detectives Tuesday arrested two Lancaster men on 
suspicion of stealing a 17th-Century Dutch oil painting worth at least $50,000 
from a gallery at Antelope Valley College and recovered the painting. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives serving a search warrant found the painting in an apartment in the 
43300 block of Gadsden Avenue in Lancaster, Deputy Cory Kennedy said. They 
arrested Timothy Cain, 27, and Jerald Sharitz, 23, both residents of the 
apartment, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
The painting by the Dutch neoclassicist Gerard Hoet, "Nymphs Gathering Flowers 
in a Landscape," was apparently removed from a gallery wall at the school in 
Lancaster on Nov. 6 and simply carried out of the building, where an exhibit of 
European masters was being staged, authorities said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AIR FORCE SAYS BILL THREATENS TEST FLIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Air Force officials told Antelope Valley business people Tuesday that a desert 
preservation bill pending in Congress could hamper low-altitude flights from 
Edwards Air Force Base. However, the officials rejected local speculation that 
the base might be forced to move. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed California desert protection act, sponsored by Sen. Alan Cranston 
(D-Calif.), would give about 7.5 million acres of desert -- mostly in Southern 
California -- either wilderness or parkland status. The land would include 
tracts under the airspace used by Edwards and other military bases. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston and environmental groups supporting his bill say it would not restrict 
military use of airspace over the desert. But Air Force officials say it could 
preclude the sort of low-altitude testing now done at Edwards. The officials 
said the base will stay where it is, but that they could be forced to shift 
some flights to more remote areas.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 24 ARRESTED IN SWEEP OF BAD-CHECK SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A two-day sweep by district attorney's investigators for unrepentant bad-check 
writers across the San Gabriel Valley netted at least 24 arrests, authorities 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The operation, employing about two dozen investigators armed with more than 200 
arrest warrants, was designed to publicize the District Attorney's Bad Check 
Enforcement Program, which has operated since 1986 in the San Gabriel Valley 
and is being expanded to include the city of Los Angeles. Thirteen people were 
in custody by midday Monday and by Tuesday afternoon, a total of 24 people 
either were arrested or voluntarily surrendered after finding notices of the 
warrants left at their homes, said Lt. Duane Trump of the District Attorney's 
Bureau of Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Despite arresting only a small fraction of the people sought, Trump said the 
operation was a success.

VALLEY YOUTHS GET AN EARFUL OF HEAVY METAL GLASNOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Birmingham High School students got a blast of glasnost Tuesday from a Soviet 
rock band that is touring the United States to promote cultural exchange and, 
on this day at least, to engage in a bit of old-fashioned capitalism by 
promoting its new album. 
</P>
<P>
Four members of Gorky Park, a band that played with U.S. heavy metal favorites 
Motley Crue, Bon Jovi and Ozzy Osbourne at the Moscow Music Peace Festival in 
August, performed one song and showed videos of several more for 500 
enthusiastic students at the Van Nuys high school. 
</P>
<P>
The band is the first Soviet group under contract to a U.S. recording company. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even like rock -- I listen to rap -- but these guys are great," said 
Jay Mamaghani, a Birmingham ninth-grader, echoing the sentiments of many of 
those in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the group told students that rock music can overcome many of the 
barriers that have separated U.S. and Soviet citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody ever hated the American people in Russia; it was all propaganda," said 
band member Alexei Belov. He drew the largest round of applause from the 
students when he explained the similarities between the two countries by noting 
that "people are the same, they make love the same all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
The event, billed as a cultural exchange, also had an anti-drug message with 
band member Belov warning the students to stay away from drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
The band members have apparently learned a lot from exchanges with their U.S. 
counterparts. They arrived by limousine, had long hair, wore lots of black 
leather and hailed the Beatles and Led Zeppelin as the greatest rock bands 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
Lead singer Nickolai Noskov was a no-show: He was asleep back at the hotel 
during the 1 p.m. performance, band members said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the group plays a hard-edged brand of rock, it performed for the 
students a 500-year-old traditional Russian folk song called "Oh Frost." The 
electric guitars were being reserved for a show Tuesday night at a local 
nightclub, band members said. 
</P>
<P>
The group showed a video of members performing a remake of the 1960s song "My 
Generation," originally by The Who. "The feelings that they were singing about 
25 years ago is what started happening in Russia five years ago," Belov said. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that Belov and fellow Gorky Park musicians were able to emerge from 
underground rock clubs and no longer risk arrest for playing the type of rock 
music that until recently was banned by authorities, Belov said. 
</P>
<P>
Belov, the group's lead guitarist and a classically trained violinist, said he 
was arrested several times for performing in "unofficial bands" before 
restrictions were eased under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost 
policy. The band gives thanks to Gorbachev in a message on the cover of its 
PolyGram album entitled "Gorky Park." 
</P>

Glasnost has also had an economic impact. In past years, popular musicians 
employed by Soviet authorities earned only a small salary and no royalties for 
their work, Belov said.

<P>
"Now we make as much in one concert in Russia as a regular guy makes in eight 
years," Belov said.

PARENTS PROTEST DAY-CARE SHUTDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Three women -- an out-of-work housekeeper, a legal secretary and a shoe-factory 
worker -- gathered with their children outside the now-closed Echo Park Day 
Care Center on Tuesday to commiserate about their plight. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I'm going to do," said the housekeeper, Vilma Marquina, 38, 
as she tied the shoelaces of her son, Hugo, 6. "This is the closest center to 
my house." 
</P>
<P>
"The city just doesn't care," added Patricia Mendoza, a 26-year-old secretary, 
who interrupted the conversation to tell her 4-year-old daughter, Sandra, that 
no, she could not have any more ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
The day before, the two women and Marta Dorantes, 32, the shoe-factory worker, 
had been called -- with scarcely two hours' notice -- to come pick up their 
children because the center had been shut down by the state Department of 
Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, two part-time male employees were accused of molesting children at 
the center. Although the men were immediately dismissed, state officials said 
Monday that the facility should be closed because of conduct "inimical to the 
health, welfare and safety of the children." 
</P>
<P>
The closure of the city-run center left about 40 parents without child care. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a handful of parents, mostly single women, took a day off from work 
to stage an eight-hour protest. They held signs that read, "Punish the 
criminals, not our children" and "We need our day care center." 
</P>
<P>
The Echo Park program received government subsidies, and most of the parents 
who used the facility were poor. Some paid as little as $40 a month for a 
service that can cost $250 a month at private centers. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the city Recreation and Parks Department, which ran the day-care 
center, told parents at a Monday night meeting that the city would help them 
find alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
The officials gave parents a list of facilities where they could find child 
care. But on Tuesday, Michelle Stover, 33, said the city had not yet kept its 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the parents went down to these places where they had openings, and 
they were turned away," said Stover, whose 6-year-old son, Salvador, attended 
an after-school program at the Echo Park center. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the list of alternative day-care centers included the now-closed 
Echo Park center. Below the center's address and phone number was the notation 
"No openings." 
</P>
<P>
Recreation and Parks Department spokesman Al Goldfarb said Tuesday that he was 
not aware that parents were turned away from the alternative child-care 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
State officials said the order closing the Echo Park center will remain in 
effect until an administrative law judge hears the case, probably in January. 
Officials said they will then seek to have the center's license revoked for 14 
months. 
</P>
<P>
City officials ordered the immediate fingerprinting of 2,000 part-time workers 
in the Recreation and Parks Department after it was disclosed earlier this 
month that the two workers arrested on charges of child abuse did not have 
their backgrounds checked before they were hired. The disclosure touched off 
heated complaints from parents and from City Councilwoman Gloria Molina. 
</P>
<P>
Goldfarb said the fingerprinting is to begin today at a Westside recreation 
facility. He said he did not know when the fingerprinting would be completed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're new at this," Goldfarb said. "It's going to be a big job, but we're 
going to have to do it."

EL CAMINO HIGH CAPTURES CITY ACADEMIC DECATHLON 
</P>

<P>
After two years of near misses, El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills 
captured the Los Angeles City Academic Decathlon, it was announced Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"It was such a close victory, the most amazing achievement we could hope for," 
said Chris Shellen, 17, after school district officials released the results of 
the competition. 
</P>
<P>
Taft High School, also of Woodland Hills, which won the national decathlon 
competition last spring, placed second. 
</P>
<P>
Palisades High School finished third. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino, which lost the city decathlon to Taft last year, rebounded this year 
by scoring 46,621 of a possible 60,000 points in 10 events. Taft, a close 
second, pulled down 45,790 points. 
</P>
<P>
Counties throughout Southern California held academic decathlons this month. 
Each selected a winning team to send to the state championship scheduled March 
8-10 in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its size, the Los Angeles area held three separate decathlons: one 
for the Los Angeles Unified School District, one for Los Angeles County public 
schools and one for private high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson High School in the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District won the 
county public schools competition, racking up a final score of 42,269 points to 
beat 80 other teams. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last year, they've been finishing near the top, but this is their 
first year at the championship," Richard Sholseth, decathlon coordinator for 
the county public schools, said after the results were announced Tuesday. 
"They'll be a formidable competition for the entire state." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson edged out Beverly Hills High School, which placed second. Beverly Hills 
has gone to the state championship six of the last eight years and is a 
two-time California winner. 
</P>
<P>
Third place went to Diamond Bar High School. 
</P>
<P>
The decathlon held for 198 students at 22 private high schools in the area was 
won by Bishop Amat Memorial High School of La Puente, which scored 35,836 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all excited," said Mary O'Neil, the school's decathlon coach. "This is 
the third year in a row we've won." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame Academy in Los Angeles came in second. Third place was won by 
Brethren High School in Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, nearly 3,000 schools and 27,000 students participate in the 
Academic Decathlon, which is in its ninth year. Students are tested in a 
variety of subjects including mathematics, science, history, geography, public 
speaking and essay writing. 
</P>
<P>
State winners go on to the national finals April 19-22 in Des Moines, Iowa. The 
1991 national finals will be in Los Angeles.

EXHIBIT UNDERSCORES COMICS' PORTRAYAL OF MINORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A heated exchange on a comic book cover between Superman and Black Lightning 
mesmerized a visitor to the California Museum of Science and Industry in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
DC Comics' Man of Steel offers the African-American renegade super-hero, 
Lightning, a handshake and a place in the Anglo-dominated "Justice League of 
America." 
</P>
<P>
The gesture was made in a 1973 issue, when affirmative action had reached even 
the Justice League. 
</P>
<P>
"We want you on the team," Superman says. 
</P>
<P>
Lightning's response: "With that jive bunch of turkeys in the JLA? Forget it!" 
</P>
<P>
The cover appears in "Ethnic Images in the Comics," an exhibit on display until 
Dec. 3 at the museum in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, produced by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and the 
Balch Institute of Ethnic Studies, is an unapologetic look at how minorities 
have been portrayed by cartoonists in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Images like these made you feel confused," said Oscar Garcia, 28, as he led 
his 6-year-old son, Christopher, through the exhibit earlier this week. "There 
we were, just children at the time, all of us trying to be like Superman." 
</P>
<P>
Through the comics, Garcia's memory drifted back to the early '70s. He 
remembered growing up in East Los Angeles, not yet 10 years old, when Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputies in riot gear fired tear gas canisters to 
break up an anti-Vietnam War rally, and one projectile crashed through the 
skull of Latino journalist Ruben Salazar. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia remembered how some of his neighbors charged that the officers incited a 
series of violent confrontations in East Los Angeles. He remembered rioting and 
the subsequent Latino empowerment movement. 
</P>
<P>
"Hispanic people were struggling for our identity; the black super-hero 
character was doing the same," he said. "But back then we would have thought 
that the black guy was the bad guy, because he was going against Superman. The 
picture on the cover makes him look like an outlaw." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said that Lightning's dilemma was similar for most minorities -- whether 
to remain outsiders or to try to assimilate into white society. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at the comic book cover now, "the black character's reaction is 
understandable," Garcia said. "He doesn't want to become part of the system. 
Like a lot of us, he wasn't understood." 
</P>
<P>
In between explanations to his son, Garcia said that the myriad of images 
covering the walls of the 3,000-square-foot exhibit room brought back powerful 
memories of a turbulent time. 
</P>
<P>
The reason people are drawn to comics, said David Lehrer, regional director of 
the Anti-Defamation League, is because they provide an index of popular 
sentiment and culture. 
</P>
<P>
Begun in the 1890s as a "gimmick" to boost newspaper circulation, the comic 
strip pages have become perhaps the most widely read portion of modern 
newspapers, Lehrer said. The comic book format spawned in the late 1930s 
attracted even more readers. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not high literature, or esoteric poetry," he said. "Comics are, 
though, what a lot of people are reading and thinking about." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit measures the effect that changing immigration patterns, American 
foreign policy and civil rights consciousness had on ethnic portrayals -- 
including Italians as "underworld thugs," African-Americans as "jungle-dwelling 
savages" and Asians as "sinister Orientals." 
</P>
<P>
America used its "super-heroes to play out the myth of its own superiority," 
reads an exhibit panel written by the Balch Institute. And in the pages of the 
comics, "the idea of equality could be played out without disturbing 
contradictions," the panel reads. 
</P>
<P>
Non-Anglo people -- including Asians, African-Americans, Middle Easterners and 
Native Americans -- who cannot assimilate racially with whites have for the 
most part remained in secondary roles as valets or foils to the Anglo-American 
lead characters, another panel reads. 
</P>
<P>
And while there have been improvements in portrayals, the advances toward 
equality in the comics have been incremental. 
</P>
<P>
"Except for a few black faces there are no distinctly ethnic figures in comics 
today," the audio narrative to the exhibit concludes. 
</P>
<P>
"Ethnic Images" has drawn a modest audience since it opened on Oct. 6, said 
Evan Nossofs, spokesman for the museum. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not our most popular, but people who do go through usually stay longer," 
he said. "Visitors tend to go around and read all the copy. There's a lot to 
take in."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'REVELATIONS' OF AMERICA WON'T BE SEEN IN L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: KCET CALLS THE DOCUMENTARY, A VIEW OF THE U.S. THROUGH THE EYES OF 
ORDINARY WEST VIRGINIANS, 'MEAN-SPIRITED.' KOCE MAY RESCHEDULE THE PROGRAM; 
OTHER PBS STATIONS ARE BROADCASTING IT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's as American as Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
Yet viewers in Los Angeles may never have an opportunity to see what is 
arguably the season's best documentary hour to date, one that many PBS stations 
either wisely aired Monday when it was distributed by the network or have 
promised to air in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Revelations" -- a sometimes grim, often critical, but acutely honest and 
meaningful view of the United States through the eyes of ordinary West 
Virginians -- is scheduled to air soon on public TV stations in New York and 
Boston, among many others. 
</P>
<P>
But it's been vetoed here by KCET Channel 28, whose director of broadcasting, 
Jacqueline Kain, finds the program "mean-spirited" and "condescending." 
</P>
<P>
Not on your life. 
</P>
<P>
At once reflecting the throbbing ache and sinewy strength of America's 
heartland, "Revelations" is art with an edge, giving resonance to voices rarely 
accommodated by television and taking viewers where they haven't been taken 
previously. Isn't that what public TV is supposed to do? 
</P>
<P>
"Revelations" was scheduled to run tonight on KOCE Channel 50 in Orange County, 
then was preempted for a special "Frontline" documentary investigating the 
crash of Pan Am 103. Program director Roberta Smith said she would try to 
reschedule "Revelations." "I'm looking over my February schedule now," she 
said. But no guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
What's the fuss? Indeed. What is the fuss? 
</P>
<P>
A high-achieving documentary arising not from such PBS giants as KCET, New 
York's WNET or Boston's WGBH, but bold little WNPB in Morgantown, W.Va.? WNPB 
deserves a medal, not a slap in the face. 
</P>
<P>
KCET, for example, should be toasting "Revelations" -- which has already aired 
in Britain, whose BBC co-produced it with WNPB -- instead of condemning and 
withholding it. 
</P>
<P>
Although the subject is intensely American, the guiding hand here belongs to 
the program's British director, Paul Watson, head of documentaries for BBC 
Elstree, who has a critical eye for the absurd as well as the profound. 
Watson's films have angered people in the past. 
</P>
<P>
A documentary without narration, "Revelations" is laden with irony and 
symbolism, intercutting television's daily onslaught of flim flam with the 
troubled realities of West Virginians trying to adapt to the changing world 
around them. 
</P>
<P>
Center stage are state trooper Larry Smith, his wife Rhonda, their 17-year-old 
son Lacy, and Larry's parents, elderly Jenny and Guy Smith. Although mostly 
shown passively watching a preacher on TV, Guy briefly weighs in on world 
affairs ("This Gorbachev feller . . . ."). 
</P>
<P>
Much of "Revelations" is a sort of Appalachian "Our Town." It's about values -- 
religious values, conservative values, life-affirming family values movingly 
expressed at Thanksgiving time. There are deep roots here, too, the continuity 
of generations visible at the local cemetery, where 10 of the Smith clan are 
buried. This Watson feller is respectful of their traditions. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, however, "Revelations" shows the dark side of rural America 
that Charles Kuralt leaves out. 
</P>
<P>
"Corruption is everywhere," Trooper Smith says while cruising on Interstate 79. 
"My father had to pay a politician to get a job. My sister worked for those 
politicians who were indicted." 
</P>
<P>
Rhonda: "You just don't know who you can trust out here." 
</P>
<P>
Deep in the forest, "Revelations" also finds a group of orange-clad hunters, 
male comrades living out a cultural attachment to nature that is paradoxically 
manifested in the destruction of life. There's lots of quick cutting: Hunters 
drag a dead buck through the woods. Click. Shoppers in Charlestown chatter in 
the climatically controlled atmosphere of a shopping mall. Click. Back to the 
hunters. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This is National Rifle Assn. heaven, the deer slayers representing a segment of 
society for whom guns are considered a birthright. A stocking-capped, 
red-bearded hunter: "I think everybody ought to have at least one or two guns 
laying around. I've got a boy that's 7 years old and I've got one that's 3 
years old, and both of 'em have had guns in their hands, and the 7-year-old can 
come up here right now and shoot anything he wanted to shoot -- even you!" 
</P>
<P>
Not show this hour? 
</P>
<P>
KCET's Kain says she was "predisposed to like" the documentary before seeing it 
in Stockholm last May at the 1989 International Public Television Conference. 
"I look forward to cross-cultural viewing. But I found this mean-spirited and 
cliche-ridden. I also found it to take a condescending attitude toward the 
people it was depicting." 
</P>
<P>
Barry Stoner, executive producer for international production at KCTS in 
Seattle, is as critical as Kain, saying he finds the program "jaundiced, 
shallow and a cheap shot at American culture." 
</P>
<P>
It is anything but those, actually. 
</P>
<P>
"You take from it what you bring to it," said Harry Chancey, vice president and 
director of the broadcast center at New York's WNET, which will air 
"Revelations" next month. "I didn't see it as negative. Work like this just has 
to be given a chance. I look upon it as a new way of seeing things, a seminal 
work in experiencing the icons and the society we live in." 
</P>
<P>
"Revelations" was debated angrily at the public television conference in 
Stockholm. "It was 90% Americans arguing with Americans," said WNPB's Mark 
Samels, the co-producer and cameraman for "Revelations," who originated the 
idea for the program and then two years ago recruited Watson to execute it. 
</P>
<P>
Some Americans at the conference weren't enthusiastic about a foreigner, 
Watson, controlling a program critical of America, Samels said. "One called 
Larry Smith an aberration. Another one said you can't purport to make a show 
about America set in a rural setting." And Stoner virtually begged European 
broadcasters not to show it, Samels said. 
</P>
<P>
"These were high-level people from public-TV stations. What the discussion 
revealed was how intensely Americans need to be loved." 
</P>
<P>
WNET's Chancey would like to see the "Revelations" concept extended, and he may 
get his wish. 
</P>
<P>
The West Virginia station is now assembling a consortium of 
small-to-medium-sized public-TV stations for another BBC co-production that 
would be titled "States of Mind," an eight-part series examining America from 
the perspectives of families in other sections of the country. 
</P>
<P>
It sounds exciting, just as "Revelations" is exciting and exactly the kind of 
challenging and deeply indigenous work that fulfills the public TV mandate. 
Except in Los Angeles, apparently.

ART: OSWALDO GUAYASAMIN HAS BECOME A BEMUSED SYMBOL OF U.S.-LATIN AMERICAN 
TENSIONS AS HIS LATEST HISTORICAL MURAL PROVOKES SHARP DEBATE IN THE UNITED 
STATES.

QUITO, Ecuador 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ecuadorean artist Oswaldo Guayasamin began his ascent toward world renown 
thanks to Nelson Rockefeller and the State Department, but he has no friends 
these days in the U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Although French President Francois Mitterrand visited his home last month, and 
Mitterrand's wife is a regular house guest, some Americans denounce him as a 
leftist ingrate guilty of a perfidious insult to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Guayasamin, 70, has thus become a bemused symbol of the tensions that have 
periodically surfaced since World War II between small Latin countries and the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
On the way to winning acclaim as one of Latin America's finest artists, 
Guayasamin has been causing controversy with his paint brush for nearly 50 
years. While he doesn't say so, his smile suggests his delight in the debate 
that his latest major work has provoked. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble began in August, 1988, when one of his murals was unveiled in the 
Ecuadorean Congress. Covering about 1,600 square feet of the main wall facing 
the hall, the mural's 23 panels tell Ecuador's history through portraits of 
heroes, dictators, tortured images of suffering and a hopeful pair of delicate 
hands reaching toward a pre-Columbian sun. 
</P>
<P>
In a panel off to the left lies the source of the polemics. Above a Nazi-style 
helmet enclosing a skeletal face, Guayasamin inscribed three letters: CIA. 
</P>
<P>
The reference to the Central Intelligence Agency passed almost unnoticed at 
first in Ecuador where, as elsewhere in the region, the CIA has often 
symbolized American meddling. Furthermore, the CIA was just one of four 
literally negative, black-and-white images in the otherwise warm-colored mural, 
along with Ecuador's former military dictators, its oligarchical civilian 
tyrants and the first president who enslaved the native Indians. 
</P>
<P>
But Americans reacted fast and loudly: 
</P>
<P>
Then-Secretary of State George P. Shultz, visiting Quito for the inauguration 
of President Rodrigo Borja in the Congress hall last year, called the painting 
an insult to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
According to Guayasamin, the U.S. Ambassador told the president of the 
Congress, Wilfrido Lucero, that he should climb a ladder and paint out the 
offending letters. In January, the Congress president was given only a limited 
visa to the United States in what Ecuador's No. 2 public official calls a 
reprisal measure. 
</P>
<P>
Two outraged U.S. congressmen threatened in May to seek a cut-off of the 
$37-million American aid program to Ecuador unless the offending panel is 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
For some Ecuadoreans, such demands confirm that the United States touts free 
expression at home, but not beyond its borders. Others began to examine the 
panel more closely, and agreed that it was offensive. 
</P>
<P>
But no one has entertained the notion of changing it. 
</P>
<P>
Borja, the newly elected president of the Democratic Left Party, fled from this 
no-win problem, saying it was a congressional matter. Congress sought to 
downplay it, noting that Ecuador had signed a convention protecting free 
artistic expression, pressure or no. 
</P>
<P>
Guayasamin had already toned down his mural. Originally, he planned to place a 
U.S. flag and a swastika above the Nazi helmet, implicating the entire United 
States. Then he replaced the flag with the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the work was completed, he said in an interview, he read of an 
attempt by private American citizens to send 10 to 15 truckloads of donated 
food and clothing to Nicaragua as a counterweight to the official support for 
the CIA-backed Contra rebels. 
</P>
<P>
"This opened my eyes and I said, 'It is not all the American people.' I think 
it is the U.S. government, not the U.S. people. Inside the United States, there 
is a very strong opposition to the CIA, there are progressives. But the 
attitude of the government -- of the U.S. governments -- has been quite tragic 
for Latin America. There are repeated examples: Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"We have all been more or less victims, in one form or another, of the U.S. 
government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A friend and admirer of Cuban leader Fidel Castro and a committed leftist since 
his youth, Guayasamin calls himself a humanist, incapable of violence. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my form of fighting," he said, showing his works-in-progress in his 
studio. "I cannot take up a rifle but, damn it, I fight this way." 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, the controversy has overshadowed the artistic achievements of a 
prized artist, whose work has just completed a three-year tour of museums, 
including the Hermitage in Leningrad. A vast retrospective exhibition is 
scheduled for Paris next October. 
</P>
<P>
The son of an Indian father and a mixed-race mother, Guayasamin grew up in 
poverty as the eldest of 10 children, and recalls bitterly how he discovered 
Latin American racism. 
</P>
<P>
"The children in primary school didn't play with me because I was named 
Guayasamin," he said, referring to his Indian last name. "I never learned to 
play marbles, or spin a top. Those games I learned with my own children." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, studying at Ecuador's fine-arts school, he resisted the temptation to fall 
into the trap of becoming "an indigenous painter." He scoffs at those who paint 
cheerful Indians and more so at those who portray downtrodden natives, which he 
dismisses as "folklore in reverse." 
</P>
<P>
His sights were higher: a style that would convey more subtly the sufferings of 
the century without caricature. He evolved a wrenching figurative style that 
reflects what he calls his "inside skin," his personality and experiences, and 
his "outside skin," the era in which he lives -- "the most monstrous century 
that humanity has ever endured." 
</P>
<P>
Traveling through Latin America in the 1940s, he gathered material for his 
first major series, Huaycaynan, or "The Road of Lamentation," in which his 
figurative, angular faces began to emerge through the 1950s. Self-portraits 
from those years show a brooding face with searing eyes and a short, slender 
frame, now thickened a bit with age but still hardy. 
</P>
<P>
After more worldly travels, he produced perhaps his greatest, and most 
anguished work, in a series called "The Age of Wrath." Outsized hands cupping, 
pleading, protecting or beseeching are a constant and haunting feature. 
Distorted faces are often reduced to eyes, bodies to bones. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish writer Jose Camon Aznar said in a study of Guayasamin: "Truly he is the 
Michelangelo of the defeated race." 
</P>
<P>
Later, he produced a gentler series called "The Age of Tenderness," focusing on 
his mother and other women. (He has married three times, has seven children and 
is again unmarried. But he says he wants to marry once more "because I want to 
have two more children.") 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, he has taken up leftist causes, though he has never belonged to a 
political party. He was expelled twice from art school, once for supporting a 
strike and then for his rebellious artwork itself. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Nelson Rockefeller, named by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940 to 
coordinate inter-American affairs, found Guayasamin's work compelling during a 
1942 visit to Quito. The future New York governor, presidential candidate and 
vice president took home six paintings, and included with his payment an extra 
"incredible" gift that made the artist instantly prosperous. 
</P>
<P>
He also extended a State Department invitation to the United States. Guayasamin 
spent several years there, living for a while in Bayside, Queens, with his 
family, and exhibiting around the country. 
</P>
<P>
A six-month visit to China at Communist Party Chairman Mao Tse-Tung's 
invitation in 1960, however, ended his ties with the United States. When he 
sought to return to New York, the U.S. Embassy in Paris "nearly destroyed my 
passport," and he says he was openly followed and harassed in New York. So he 
packed up, sold out and went home to Quito. "And now I know that I cannot enter 
the U.S.," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While he assiduously avoided overt political images in his work, he has never 
escaped trouble. A mosaic mural by him at the Central University in Quito was 
criticized and once sprayed with machine gun fire. Yet now, he said, "it is 
part of the city, it is part of the consciousness of the people." 
</P>
<P>
That will happen as well with the mural in Congress, Guayasamin predicts, as 
emotions die down. 
</P>
<P>
The last thing that Congress President Lucero wants is to see the matter 
resurrected. He inherited the problem -- the work was commissioned by the 
previous Congress -- and expresses surprise at the depth of the anger. 
</P>
<P>
"If it were the State Department, that would be different, it would be 
understandable that they make demands," Lucero said. "But the CIA is an 
institution charged with certain tasks that are not so clean, and we know of 
its interventions in other countries, not just in Latin America." 
</P>
<P>
"For the U.S. people, and their government, we have the most profound respect," 
Lucero said. "It seems exaggerated on the part of the United States to consider 
that having CIA painted there represents officially the image of the whole 
United States. That is not the case." 
</P>
<P>
The artist's Guayasamin Foundation has printed posters of the mural, with 
accompanying explanations, to be sent to schools around the country. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation is clearly a major business, with a splendid museum showing not 
only the artists's own works but his collection of pre-Columbian and Spanish 
colonial art, all bequeathed to the nation. Signed lithographs are on sale, as 
is designer jewelry and copper work produced in the Guayasamin workshop. 
</P>
<P>
Some Ecuadoreans grouse that Guayasamin has cashed in on foreign sales, often 
to Americans like Rockefeller, while railing against imperialism. He is 
certainly a wealthy man, living in a magnificent home on a 5-acre spread on a 
wooded hillside overlooking Quito. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), who saw the mural during a visit this year, 
complained to the House that Ecuador received $33 million in foreign aid last 
year while it "openly, willfully insults us every day of the year." Joining 
Inhofe in supporting a cut-off of aid unless the mural is changed, Rep. Gerald 
B. H. Solomon (R-N.Y.) noted that the United States has accepted 76,000 
Ecuadorean immigrants and has given a total of more than $800 million in aid. 
</P>
<P>
Guayasamin professes not to understand the fuss. 
</P>
<P>
He is furiously prolific, working 12 to 14 hours a day in the vast studio that 
forms part of his rambling white mansion, styled in part after a pre-Columbian 
house in Peru. Smoking unfiltered Chesterfields, he rifles through an envelope 
of his drawings with hands trembling with excitement and energy. A Schubert 
symphony fills the room as he displays a new work, a child suckling at a 
skeleton mother, meant to express his feelings about the 1982 massacre of 
Palestinian refugees in the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
More controversy is ahead, Guayasamin promises, that will dwarf that of the CIA 
mural. Perhaps he means the mural to be placed at the United Nations cultural 
center in Paris next October, to coincide with a new book and film on his life. 
</P>
<P>
He is proud of his small Ecuador, font of ancient cultures and one of the 
continent's more tranquil places these days. 
</P>
<P>
"All the painting I do is born 8,000 years ago. I don't believe myself the 
author of these works. I am the most surprised of anyone when I finish painting 
something. From where do so many things come? When I am painting, I am 
completely outside myself, things are surging from inside me that I don't even 
know myself." 
</P>
<P>
He cannot be accused of inconsistency. In 1938, he wrote a poem vowing: 
</P>
<P>
 And with fire and pain and anguish, 
</P>
<P>
 I will paint man, I will paint the sky . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I will paint with the shout of a gun, 
</P>
<P>
 and with the power of the sun's rays, 
</P>
<P>
 and with the fury of battle."

WRITERS COALITION JUMPS INTO THE CENSORSHIP FRAY; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: ORGANIZATION FOUNDERS HOPE TO STRENGTHEN ARTISTS' POSITION IN THE ONGOING 
FUNDING DISPUTE BETWEEN THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS AND CONGRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An ad hoc group of more than a half dozen major writers' organizations and 
literary associations has taken preliminary steps to organize a national 
coalition to protest censorship pressures on the National Endowment for the 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
A two-day organizational meeting of the still-unnamed coalition ended Monday 
afternoon in Washington after members held a private -- but reportedly frank 
and candid -- 90-minute meeting with John E. Frohnmayer, the endowment's 
chairman who was recently caught up in a controversial decision to impound and 
then restore a $10,000 grant for an AIDS-related art show at a New York City 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Organizations that attended the initial meeting meeting Sunday -- held at the 
Washington offices of the New Republic magazine -- and met Monday morning with 
Frohnmayer included PEN Center USA West (based in Los Angeles) and the New 
York-based PEN American Center, which was represented by its president, author 
Larry McMurtry. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups involved include the Modern Language Assn., the Coordinating 
Council of Literary Magazines, the Authors Guild, the Poetry Society of 
America, Poets and Writers, Associated Writing Programs, which is an umbrella 
group of college and university creative writing departments, and at least 
three regional writers' organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Bray, executive director of PEN Center USA West, said the coalition 
hopes to encourage writers and literary societies to take a direct role in 
working for repeal of provisions of a 1990 endowment appropriation bill that 
impose content-controls on endowment grants for artwork in any medium that 
could be construed as obscene. 
</P>
<P>
Coalition members were reluctant to give details of the discussion with 
Frohnmayer. But The Times learned that the writers requested the meeting, which 
Frohnmayer first agreed to, then canceled and later rescheduled. Frohnmayer 
reportedly encouraged the writers' organizations to make a forceful, public 
case against the potential for censorship within the context of the restrictive 
language in the funding bill. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer declined to discuss the Monday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Development of the coalition within the nation's literary community was 
characterized by some key figures in the organizing movement as important 
because the literature field has historically been the source of the 
endowment's most heated and public controversies. Until disputes over two 
photography exhibitions broke out last spring, literature grants had been the 
precipitating factor in nearly every threat in Congress to the endowment. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the organizing panel discussed the new coalition on Tuesday. They 
said the group, which hopes to grow and broaden its base over the next three or 
four weeks, expects to select a name for itself by sometime next week and hold 
a larger, more public gathering in Washington early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Bray and Elliot Figman, head of the New York-based Poets and Writers and 
himself a member of an endowment literature review panel, said the coalition 
hopes to encourage writers of all sorts to offer opinion pieces and other 
essays focusing on censorship to newspapers and magazines. They said writers 
will also be urged to undertake work dealing with censorship and to engage in 
direct contacts with arts policy leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Bray said coalition organizers hope to broaden membership to include such 
diverse organizations as the American Library Assn. and the Writers Guild of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
"I was glad to see that a few writers' organizations could get together around 
a common cause," Bray said Tuesday. "Obviously, we need to broaden that. It 
needs to be not just people from New York or Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Figman and Liam Rector, director of the Virginia-based Associated Writing 
Programs, said the coalition came into being because writers have begun to feel 
the effects of a possible chilling of artistic freedom at the endowment in the 
wake of insertion of obscenity-control language in the funding bill. The 
language was a watered-down version of wording initially proposed by Sen. Jesse 
Helms (R-N.C.) last summer that would have prohibited federal funds to art 
deemed offensive or indecent. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the consensus was we wanted to support the endowment and make a 
stronger case in favor of the arts and what writers and other artists have 
contributed over the years," Figman said. "We feel the new law is detrimental. 
It gets in the way of the best art being produced and the endowment supporting 
the artist." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was at least the second unpublicized, off-the-record encounter with 
arts leaders Frohnmayer has held since the AIDS art show controversy broke out 
earlier this month. He previously met with top officials of state, regional and 
local arts agencies after giving a public speech at a convention of a national 
group of such organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The writers' concerns were galvanized by a decision by Frohnmayer to separate 
and hold out for special review five literature fellowship grant applications 
because writing samples accompanying them included stylistic or thematic 
elements that might be construed as obscene. Frohnmayer endorsed the 
fellowships after the National Council on the Arts unanimously recommended 
approval earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Several writers' group officials who attended the meeting said Frohnmayer 
overcame initial concern about his decision to hold up the literature 
fellowship grants. "I came away with a kind of confidence that he (Frohnmayer) 
is going to act as an advocate," one writers' official said. "We need to see 
that he is an advocate, but he has to walk a very close line between enforcing 
the laws and protecting the endowment from going down in flames." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a separate development in an apparently growing attempt to 
broaden public support for the endowment and to oppose perceived censorship 
pressures on the federal arts agency, a group of 17 members of the 
Congressional Arts Caucus, which includes more than 250 members of the House 
and Senate, will meet today at the Los Angeles Theatre Center with four 
influential local arts officials to discuss threats to artistic freedom of 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
The visit of the arts caucus members, who include Rep. Bob Carr (D-Mich.), the 
caucus chairman, was not publicized. Officials of the Motion Picture Assn. of 
America, which organized the three-day congressional tour, said the public 
would not be permitted to attend today's censorship discussion. The association 
says it wants to encourage a blunt exchange between the congressmen and local 
arts officials.

Armed state officials had no right to set up a "riverblock" to stop and search 
people canoeing on the Saco River, Maine's Supreme Court ruled. Two state 
agencies set up the riverblocks on three weekends in 1988 to try to stop rowdy 
and illegal conduct. The justices agreed unanimously with a lower court judge 
who said the searches violated the federal and state constitutions. The ruling 
came in a suit by Daniel and Jarlene Hatfield of Rochester, N.H., who were 
searched extensively.

The District of Columbia's former police chief, Maurice T. Turner, said 
investigators were unable to substantiate a report six years ago that Mayor 
Marion Barry was twice hospitalized for cocaine overdoses, the Washington Post 
reported. The mayor's spokesman denounced the report of overdoses as 
ridiculous. WUSA-TV said Monday that Barry was hospitalized for cocaine 
overdoses at Howard University and D.C. General hospitals in 1983, according to 
allegations made to police nine months later by Dr. Alyce Gullattee, a Howard 
University drug abuse specialist. Turner said he turned the allegations over to 
the department's Internal Affairs Division, which was then unable to verify 
them.

Teen-age survivors testified about the panic on a burning church bus that 
collided with a pickup truck headed the wrong way on Interstate 71 near 
Carrollton, Ky. "It looked like somebody was standing in the front of the bus 
with a flamethrower," one said. The May, 1988, accident killed 27 people. The 
truck driver, Larry Mahoney, 36, faces 27 counts of murder, one count of drunk 
driving and other charges. Mahoney broke into tears as Carroll County's coroner 
graphically described bodies found inside the bus.

DISNEY PLANS A MAINSTREAM RECORD LABEL; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE FIRM SAYS IT WILL START FROM SCRATCH BECAUSE MERGERS HAVE 
PUSHED ACQUISITION PRICES OUT OF SIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

In a widely expected move, Walt Disney Co. announced Tuesday that it will wade 
into "the mainstream" of the recorded music business by starting a new label to 
be run by Peter T. Paterno, an industry lawyer who has represented heavy metal 
acts. 
</P>
<P>
Disney -- which already owns the largest children's music company in the world 
-- recently told Wall Street analysts that it would enter the industry's 
mainstream, and Paterno told The Times last month that discussions about his 
hiring were under way. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared release, Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner said the company 
elected to start from scratch because a wave of mergers "has driven the cost of 
record company acquisitions beyond feasibility." 
</P>
<P>
The name tentatively selected for the new unit is Hollywood Records, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry executives have questioned whether image-conscious Disney has the 
stomach for hard-rock albums, which have drawn fire from pulpits and Capitol 
Hill, but Disney has apparently given its answer with the hiring of Paterno as 
president of the division. His clients include Metallica (a band that delivers 
with "fury," according to one reviewer) and Guns N' Roses, which became a 
phenomenon several years ago with its "Appetite for Destruction" album. 
</P>
<P>
A start-up operation is "difficult, but they've always been in the record 
business," said Gordon Crawford, a senior vice president of Capital Research 
Co. who specializes in entertainment stocks. "I don't doubt their abilities to 
do much of anything," Crawford continued, praising the Eisner-led management. 
"Since taking over the company, they've done everything right." 
</P>
<P>
Eisner told a news service that he expects the launch to cost less than one 
motion picture movie, which averages about $18 million these days, but the 
costs could be even lower. Warner recently reached an agreement to spend $50 
million to $60 million over five years to launch a new record operation with 
former MCA Records chief Irving Azoff, an industry source said.

JAMES FLANIGAN: COLD WAR'S END MAY OPEN DOORS FOR DEFENSE WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Armed Services employ 2.1 million people in uniform and an additional 
1 million civilians. In addition, more than 2 million people work for 
aerospace-defense companies and thus stand to be affected by cuts in the 
defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
And there is a multiplier effect among the millions more who work for the 
non-defense firms that supply those aerospace companies with everything from 
paper clips to gasoline. Add them all up, and it's understandable that 
communities in practically every state are apprehensive about cuts in the 
defense budget, even as they hail the end of the Cold War and tell pollster 
Louis Harris that they favor reduced military spending. Fear of unemployment 
clouds even a hope as bright as peace. 
</P>
<P>
The record is not reassuring: The end of World War I in November, 1918, led to 
a severe economic downturn in 1920. The economy did better in the transition to 
peace after World War II, but it had help from the buildup of peacetime defense 
industry -- the advanced aircraft and high-tech weaponry programs that are now 
faced with winding down. 
</P>
<P>
So what's likely to happen to the economy this time? Things will be better than 
communities fear today -- maybe far better. Two things to keep in mind are that 
simple inertia will ease the economy's transition and that people don't stop 
thinking just because defense money stops pumping -- hosts of skilled workers 
in defense may find great opportunities in commercial projects. 
</P>
<P>
First inertia. Cutbacks won't happen as swiftly as feared. "Politics won't 
allow dramatic cuts to happen," says analyst Michael Lauer of Kidder, Peabody 
&amp; Co., who notes that the New York congressional delegation's lobbying has 
kept production of the Navy F-14D fighter plane going at Long Island's Grumman 
Aircraft. Similar politicking will at least extend the transition from growing 
to shrinking defense budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, the amount of the $286-billion budget's ultimate shrinkage is a good 
question. Reports are that $180 billion will be cut from defense budgets during 
fiscal years 1992 to 1994 and that defense spending will be reduced from 6% of 
the U.S. gross national product -- now $5.13 trillion -- to 4% by 1994. But by 
that time the GNP will have grown to nearly $6 trillion -- which indicates an 
annual defense budget roughly $40 billion less than today's. 
</P>
<P>
Translation: There will be cuts in defense spending, but not enough to cause an 
economic depression. In a nutshell, the defense industry is entering a long 
period of no-growth. "It will just be a tougher business for aerospace-defense 
companies," says analyst Wolfgang Demisch of UBS Securities. "They'll have to 
keep their eye on the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Some programs will be canceled: Analysts suggest the B-2 bomber will be a 
sacrificial pawn in negotiations to get the Soviets to give up mobile missiles. 
Some programs will be expanded: Surveillance satellites will continue to be 
built, perhaps even more so in an era when disarmament agreements need 
verification. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, expect some troops to come home from Europe and expect the armed 
forces to be reduced by 500,000 or so -- but not to swell the ranks of the 
unemployed. "Most military people are confident they'll find jobs," says a 
military analyst. "They're trained people, who have proved themselves in the 
military, and we have a labor-short economy." 
</P>
<P>
Even more positive are the possibilities that await the thousands of engineers 
working in defense firms. If their projects get canceled or their departments 
are cut back, they could find a welcome in commercial industry, even the chance 
to found their own business, with the aid of venture capital. "We're eager to 
listen and talk to people in aerospace about ideas, or even better about 
setting up a business," says Michael Moritz, a partner in Sequoia Capital, a 
venture capital firm in Menlo Park. 
</P>
<P>
Other venture capital firms, such as Sevin-Rosen Management in Dallas and New 
York and Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &amp; Byers of San Francisco and Palo Alto, 
hope to see a new breed of entrepreneurs come out of defense work -- although 
they admit that the idea is new and unfamiliar. The conventional thinking is 
that there is no connection between commercial industry and what one does in 
defense work -- or as one analyst puts it, "You can't easily sell knowledge of 
wing-based gun systems." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not, concedes Sequoia Capital's Moritz, "but there's certainly a call 
for advanced semiconductor skills and skills in telecommunications and 
imaging." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of good optics work is done in the military -- space lasers, pop-up 
computer displays -- while the commercial field is crying out for optical 
engineers," says Floyd Kwamme, a partner in the Kleiner, Perkins firm. "I see 
engineering talent from the defense field taking jobs in commercial start-up 
firms and then perhaps founding their own company when the next product comes 
along." 
</P>
<P>
A heady vision. "It won't take many guys coming out of Rockwell or McDonnell or 
the other dinosaurs to give their colleagues ideas," says a venture capital 
type. The message: The economy's need for weapons may diminish but not its need 
for brains.

GREAT WESTERN EXPECTS LOSS OF $75 MILLION IN 4TH PERIOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Great Western Financial, the nation's second-largest thrift and one of the 
healthiest survivors of the nation's savings and loan mess, disclosed Tuesday 
that it expects to post a $75-million loss in the fourth quarter stemming from 
problem commercial and apartment loans. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western said most of the loans were made outside of California, primarily 
in Arizona, Texas and Florida. The bulk of them also were made before 1987, 
when Great Western virtually stopped making such loans in favor of more 
conservative single-family home loans and consumer loans. 
</P>
<P>
Although securities analysts had expected Great Western to show some problems 
with loans, they said the loss is surprising and shows an aggressive move by 
Great Western to rid itself of its problem loans and properties. 
</P>
<P>
"Great Western is one of the Rolls-Royces of the business. It's not a case 
where you expect to see any engine trouble, or even any sputtering," said 
Jonathan Gray, a thrift analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Great Western will devalue foreclosed real estate by $50 million, 
set aside $50 million as a reserve for specific problem loans and set aside 
another $100 million as a general reserve for unspecified loans that may become 
a problem in the future. Taking the actions will free Great Western to sell its 
problem properties for money that can then be invested in profitable loans. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western Financial, the Beverly Hills-based parent of Great Western Bank, 
is posting its first quarterly loss in seven years. Despite the large loss, the 
company said, it expects to post a profit of more than $100 million for the 
entire year, compared to $248 million in 1988. In the first nine months, Great 
Western earned $177 million, compared to $188 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
James F. Montgomery, Great Western chief executive, said in an interview that 
the announcement is not a sign of widespread problems in real estate lending 
for Great Western. He said that the thrift's $25-billion portfolio of 
single-family mortgages is in good shape and that Great Western decided to take 
the large loss now to deal with its problems as it enters the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no fun to do this, but we want to get it behind us," Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
The problems generally involve loans for developing office buildings, shopping 
centers and apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western is the latest of several financial institutions to show problems 
in Arizona, which is suffering through a real estate recession caused mostly by 
overbuilding and a slowdown in immigration. Other institutions with problems in 
Arizona include First Interstate Bancorp, Great American Bank, Security Pacific 
Corp. and Chase Manhattan Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery attributed the problems with the loans to two other general factors: 
the continuing impact of the 1986 tax reforms that made investing in commercial 
projects less desirable and an abundance of property being unloaded by troubled 
thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Gray said that Great Western's problem is not that its troubled assets 
have been increasing but that the size of its problem assets has remained 
steady and is not declining. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western said it that its non-performing assets -- made up of real estate 
that it has foreclosed on and loans that are delinquent 90 days or more -- 
total $718 million, or about 2% of its total assets. Single-family mortgages, 
considered among the safest of loans, now make up more than 80% of Great 
Western's $30 billion in loans. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Great Western Financial disclosed that it plans to raise $300 
million through a debt offering and that the money will be shifted to the 
thrift to bolster its capital, which is the cushion financial institutions 
maintain to protect against losses. Great Western said it should easily meet 
new, tougher federal standards that go into effect within two weeks.

BAY AREA REAL ESTATE SHAKEN UP; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: SALES OF SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES WERE DOWN 26.7% IN THE MONTH OF OCTOBER. 
BUT THE POPULAR VIEW IS THAT THE MARKET WILL BOUNCE BACK ONCE THE QUAKE DAMAGE 
IS REPAIRED.

For the seller of one house in San Francisco's posh Marina district, it was a 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
The Oct. 17 earthquake gave a buyer cold feet, and a $950,000 deal fell out of 
escrow. But another buyer from Hong Kong immediately stepped in, and the house 
sold a few days ago for $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
In hard-hit Santa Cruz, one broker is selling a corner lot for $175,000. The 
five-unit, yellow clapboard apartment building that had stood on the site -- 
and might have commanded a price of $300,000 if it had not rattled apart in the 
quake -- lies in a heap. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the Bay Area, real estate brokers and would-be home sellers and 
buyers are feeling economic aftershocks from the devastating 7.1-magnitude 
temblor. Sellers have lowered prices. Buyers have backed out of deals. Escrow 
closings have been delayed and brokers are suffering reduced sales commissions. 
</P>
<P>
Numbers released Tuesday by the California Assn. of Realtors gave the first 
firm indication that the quake, indeed, had a negative effect on property 
values. Bay Area single-family home sales fell a sharp 26.7% in October from 
the year-ago levels. But perhaps more telling, the median home price dropped 
1.4% from the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
But brokers -- facing lost or reduced commissions -- attempted Tuesday to cast 
the figures in as favorable a light as possible. 
</P>
<P>
After all, they say, one can blame some of the decline on the normally slow 
holiday season. Moreover, after a long period of torrid sales and price 
increases, housing activity in the San Francisco area and elsewhere in the 
state had tapered off, putting buyers in the driver's seat and keeping a lid on 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
And, brokers point out, some housing transactions that were disrupted by the 
quake to allow buyers time to inspect properties anew are simply taking longer 
to work their way through escrow. 
</P>
<P>
In the 15 business days after the quake, escrow closings on single-family 
dwellings in the Bay Area declined an average of 12% to 15% from the 15 
business days before the temblor, according to John Karevoll of Dataquick 
Information Services, a data company in La Jolla. San Francisco County showed 
the sharpest drop, 26%. Last year, he said, there was no significant difference 
between the first half and the second half of the month. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Scherbert, resident sales manager in the San Francisco office of Coldwell 
Banker, a real estate brokerage firm, blames much of the October decline on the 
season. "And we're in a buyer's market," she said. "People have been denying it 
for quite some time, but we're clearly in it." 
</P>
<P>
Figuring the temblor would scare off some buyers, Coldwell Banker advised many 
would-be sellers to hold off a bit before putting their houses on the market 
immediately after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes some time to recover," said real estate broker Pius Lee, a Marina 
resident. "When you repair (all the damage), the market will come back. I still 
have a lot of confidence that the houses will continue to go up in the 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Lee's California Realty &amp; Land Inc. represented the Hong Kong buyer of the 
$900,000 home in the Marina, in a prime location across from the Palace of Fine 
Arts. The buyer had actually made a stand-by offer of more than $900,000 when 
the home was in escrow with the original $950,000 bid. After the earthquake, 
the original buyer halted the deal, and the Hong Kong bidder stepped up, asked 
to view the property, then negotiated the lower price because of some quake 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
The seller, Lee said, was "very happy" because it would have been difficult to 
capture a $900,000 price otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Lee expects housing prices to remain soft for at least another month or so, 
with 5% to 10% declines typical in the Marina and other heavily damaged areas. 
</P>
<P>
He figures that his agency's business is off by 15% to 20%. At least one 
$800,000 apartment sale on Post Street near the Tenderloin was lost because of 
the quake. "My saleslady felt bad," he said. No wonder. She lost out on a 
$40,000 commission. 
</P>
<P>
Marina sales activity undoubtedly suffered from the presence of barricades 
erected after the quake to keep out gawkers as utility workers and contractors 
went about the business of shoring up damaged buildings and restoring power. 
</P>
<P>
Until last Thursday, only residents who showed identification with their home 
addresses were allowed past guards. Power and water service were only recently 
restored to some residences; many Marina residents have had to shower in 
trailers set up in the middle of streets by the Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
Broker optimism aside, clearly it will take some time for the memory of crushed 
neighbors, falling-down buildings and flattened cars to fade. On several 
corners in the Marina district, apartment buildings that came crashing down had 
to be demolished. In all, 60 homes and apartment buildings were lost in the 
district. One apartment building hung a triangular green sign reading "Safe." 
</P>
<P>
Scherbert of Coldwell Banker, also a Marina resident, said most buildings that 
tilted off their foundations have been pushed back into place "so they don't 
look so cockeyed." Sidewalks are being repaired, and things are largely getting 
back to normal. Now that non-residents are once again strolling the 
neighborhood, Scherbert expects business to pick up. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Cruz County, 63 residences were destroyed by the quake. Throughout the 
picturesque college town of Santa Cruz, the streets echo with the sounds of 
hammering and buzz-sawing as repair workers fix up damaged homes. 
</P>
<P>
At the corner of Center and Elm streets, a sign for Susan Liebl Properties has 
been hung on a window of a collapsed 50-year-old apartment building. It stood 
on poorly compacted soil in the so-called liquefaction zone, where shaking was 
magnified and many buildings suffered extensive damage. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco owner put the property on the market immediately after the 
quake. Liebl, whose firm is based in nearby Aptos, said she hopes the deal will 
close about year-end, 2 1/2 months after the temblor. Meanwhile, the owner is 
losing rental income. 
</P>
<P>
"He is recouping close to his investment (in the property)," Liebl said. 
However, "he just has to eat" the loss of appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
Liebl noted that she got about 30 calls on the listing. 
</P>
<P>
"Buyers are thinking they can pick up properties for a song," she said. "But I 
don't see a lot of people jumping to put houses on the market. You don't see a 
lot of panic selling. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the earthquake truly scared anybody away except my relatives in 
Kansas."

New Construction Down 6%: New construction contracts were down 6% in October to 
$262.58 billion, compared to $279.72 billion in September, the F. W. Dodge 
construction report said. The October figures reflected the tone set in the 
industry in the past two years, and followed a strong September performance 
reflecting an unusually large number of public works projects, the report said. 
The October decline mostly reflected an 11% drop to an annualized $46.8 billion 
from $52.88 billion in September in the public works and utilities construction 
sector. Residential building held steadily in October at $121.5 billion.

Japan's Auto Exports Decline: Japan's auto exports in October dropped 13.6% 
from September and 11.4% from a year ago to 462,548 units, mostly because of a 
substantial decline of shipments to the United States, the Japan Automobile 
Manufacturers Assn. said. Exports to the United States, the biggest overseas 
auto market for Japan, declined 24.3% from a year ago to 191,369 units, while 
those to Europe increased to 128,792 units, up 15.4%. October exports totaled 
$5.17 billion, down 15.7% from September's $6.14 billion and down 8.7% from a 
year ago.

Pan Am to Hike Holiday Fares: Pan American World Airways said it plans to raise 
its discount fares during the busy Christmas travel season, boosting MaxSaver 
ticket prices on domestic routes by $10 to $20 round-trip. None of Pan Am's 
competitors matched the increases, and all of them said they were studying the 
proposed fares. One airline official said he doubts that other airlines will go 
along with the increases -- which probably would force Pan Am to cancel them -- 
because passenger traffic is generally low this year. Separately, Delta Air 
Lines belatedly matched a $5-to-$8-per-trip increase in full fares instituted a 
week ago by United Airlines.

LOOKING AHEAD: WHEN IT COMES TO PLANNING, DISAGREEMENT IS CRUCIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY H. WILLARD, TIMOTHY H. WILLARD is managing editor of the Futurist, a 
publication of the World Future Society, based in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Businesses interested in achieving accurate forecasts should make sure that 
their planning committees agree to disagree. Futurists have found that 
disagreement among committee members forces the group to look at more 
alternatives. Examinations of group behavior have concluded that judgments made 
by groups are more accurate than those by individuals precisely because of this 
tendency to disagree. 
</P>
<P>
"With more disagreement, people are forced to look at a wider range of 
possibilities," says psychologist Rebecca A. Henry, co-author of a recent study 
of group behavior. "It makes them think of things they hadn't thought of 
before." 
</P>
<P>
The study found that the greater the disagreement at the beginning of a group 
discussion, the more accurate the final judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasts of sales and other financial data made by groups are generally more 
accurate than the forecasts of individuals. The use of committees for 
forecasting can lead to a significant increase not only in the accuracy of the 
forecast but also in a company's confidence in it. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses should be wary of committees that strive for an easy consensus. 
Henry suggests that individuals should be encouraged to make judgments before a 
meeting, which will almost guarantee disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trend Toward Bald Women 
</P>
<P>
Balding men may have company in the future: Hair loss by working women seems to 
be on the rise. In Japan, a growing number of women have the same types of 
baldness as men -- thin hair at the crown or receding hairlines. According to 
the Nippon Hair Specialists Assn., the number of women seeking treatment for 
balding has more than doubled in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts attribute this increase to a growing number of women in the work 
force. Working women are increasingly facing employment stresses traditionally 
felt by men. Along with an increase in the number of women experiencing 
stress-related illnesses such as heart attacks, hair loss aggravated by stress 
may, for some women, be a result of the hectic pace of the modern workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Look for more women wearing hairpieces too. In recent years, three of every 10 
customers buying hairpieces in Japan were women. According to one hairpiece 
manufacturer, at least 5 million women in Japan are worried about thinning 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changes in an Aging World 
</P>
<P>
Offices and stores are in for a major redesign. The graying of America -- a 
steady rise in the number of elderly as the baby boom generation ages -- means 
that the structures where people work and shop will need to be redesigned to 
accommodate an aging society. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Dychtwald, president of Age Wave Inc., which advises businesses and 
government on the implications of an aging America, says the growing number of 
elderly will necessitate changes in physical design and environment as 
businesses and stores seek to attract older Americans as both workers and 
customers. Stores and offices with fewer and less steeply pitched stairs, 
physical spaces rearranged to provide better access for people whose 
flexibility is limited, transportation devices such as motorized walkways to 
increase mobility and even furniture that responds to verbal commands will 
allow the elderly to work and shop more easily. 
</P>
<P>
Futurists suggest that during the 1990s workers over 50 will find a growing 
demand for their stability, expertise and experience. At the same time, 
Americans over 50 will also account for more than three-fourths of the nation's 
wealth and half of its discretionary spending, which will make stores even more 
eager to accommodate them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Snubbing a Shorter Week 
</P>
<P>
For years, we've been hearing about how we will all work fewer hours in the 
future. But those predicting the shorter work week may be in for a surprise: A 
recent survey said most workers don't want it. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed that about 
two-thirds of all workers, if given a choice, would not want to change their 
work week. Of those who would change the number of hours they worked if given a 
choice, most said they would opt to work more hours -- and earn more money. 
Only 6% of the men and 9% of the women expressed a preference for a shorter 
work week accompanied by a wage cut. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, the 40-hour work week may already be a myth. Another recent study 
found that the average work week is now about 49 hours. Among business men and 
women, more than 85% work more than 45 hours each week.

BRANIFF STRUGGLING TO FIND BUYER, CREDITORS TOLD

Executives of Braniff Inc. told a roomful of disgruntled creditors Tuesday that 
the airline was just getting by as a "limited charter carrier" while seeking a 
buyer and continues to run up expenses under bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a number of alternate plans, but each plan requires investments," said 
Howard McKinnon, the company's chief operating officer, who along with Braniff 
Chairman Bill McGee has been talking to potential investors or outright buyers 
for the Orlando-based airline. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of adequate funding "prevents us from having any meaningful discussion 
or planning," McKinnon said, adding that pressure from creditors "clouds this 
whole issue." 
</P>
<P>
Howard T. Glassman, a Philadelphia lawyer representing Braniff, told the 
creditors in one of a series of meetings conducted by the bankruptcy trustee 
that there was no clear picture of the airline's future. 
</P>
<P>
But officials said they do not expect Braniff to go into liquidation and sell 
its assets. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors Sept. 28, has 
275 to 300 employees left from a total of about 4,800, the officials said. It 
is losing money on a charter operation run by 15 pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Osterberg, Braniff's senior vice president for finance, said in response 
to questions from creditors' lawyers that the company had about $500,000 cash 
in hand and monthly expenses of about $1.7 million, including $1 million in 
payroll for remaining employees. The figures do not include hefty legal fees, 
the charter operation and other non-scheduled expenses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Osterberg also said the company pays $1 million in rental costs every month. 
Braniff anticipates some $3 million to $4 million in credit card fees and 
another $1.5 million from other sources this coming month, he said.

DOW TOPS 2,700 AFTER OIL ISSUES STAGE A RALLY

<P>
Wall Street's Dow industrials rose for the fifth consecutive session Tuesday, 
closing above 2,700 points after a surge in oil stocks and modest gains in U.S. 
bond prices reversed the stock market's early drop. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index finished up 7.04 points at 2,702.01, bringing 
its gains since Nov. 20 to 69.97 points. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's modest advance was led by the oil stocks, which rallied after the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to limit its output for 
the first half of 1990. The gain in the stocks came despite a fall in oil 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks benefited from lingering expectations that the Federal Reserve will 
nudge interest rates lower. 
</P>
<P>
However, following the Fed's somewhat contradictory actions last week, most 
analysts expect the central bank to ease very gradually. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who were obsessed with the short-term maneuvers of the Fed got out of 
the market," said Michael Metz of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "The Fed is going to 
take its time . . . (but) there is a feeling that there will be some action." 
</P>
<P>
Oil stocks topped the most-active list following OPEC's agreement. Dow 
component Exxon Corp. rose 1 to 47 7/8, Texaco gained 7/8 to 54 3/4, Philips 
Petroleum rose 3/4 to 23 3/8 and Unocal Corp. added 3/8 to 28 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron, another Dow industrial, was one of the few oil stocks to fall. It 
ended 1/2 lower at 67 3/4 after a Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. analyst recommended 
that investors sell their Chevron stocks and buy into Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
The oil service company Schlumberger climbed 5/8 to 46 3/8, while Halliburton 
was unchanged at 40 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
American Express gained 5/8 to 35 3/8 in active trading. The company raised its 
quarterly dividend Monday. 
</P>
<P>
IBM declined 1/2 to 98 7/8, Texas Utilities lost 1/2 to 34 1/4, and McDonald's 
slipped 1/8 to 32 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Avon Products dropped 1/8 to 36 5/8. Chartwell increased its stake to 8% from 
6.9%, but traders said investors were uncertain about further developments at 
the company, a longtime takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
Dayton-Hudson Corp. fell 1 5/8 to 64 1/8 after an analyst at Sanford C. 
Bernstein changed his recommendation to "hold" from "buy" on the stock, traders 
said. Another analyst said that while the department store's November sales are 
expected to be on target, sales at its Mervyn's unit were below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Airline stocks ended mixed after news of more price increases. Delta Air Lines 
said it would match domestic fare hikes aimed at business travelers initiated 
by UAL Corp.'s United Airlines last week. Delta was up 1/4 to 68 1/2, and Pan 
Am Corp., which raised fares aimed at leisure travelers, added 1/8 to 2 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
UAL, the parent of United Airlines, sank 3 1/4 to 165 1/2. British Airways' 
chairman told Reuters there was nothing on the horizon that would cause it to 
reassess its decision not to participate in any UAL buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 848 issues up, 647 down and 502 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 153.77 million shares, up from 149.39 million in 
Monday's session. 
</P>
<P>
Late futures-related buying took Japan's Nikkei index to its fifth straight 
record close after prices languished in a tight range earlier in the day. The 
225-share Nikkei jumped 103.77 points to close at a record 36,985.30, after 
surging 397.06 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Prices also finished higher on London's Stock Exchange, bolstered by 
futures-led buying and increased confidence in the outlook for British interest 
rates. The Financial Times 100-share index closed up 17.7 points at 2,242.0.

Bond Prices Mixed After Fed's Actions 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices finished narrowly mixed as traders retreated to the sidelines a day 
after many evidently guessed wrong on whether the Federal Reserve was 
encouraging lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/32 point, or about 30 cents for 
every $1,000 face amount. Its yield held at 7.90%, the same as late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Government bond prices fell on Monday after the Federal Reserve drained money 
from the banking system, driving the federal funds rate to 8.50% by the end of 
the day from 8.25% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The move surprised many traders, who had interpreted central bank moves last 
Wednesday that added reserves as an indication that the Fed was relaxing its 
credit policy and encouraging lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The confusion "put a lot of people on the sidelines today," said Steven A. 
Wood, economist for BankAmerica Capital Markets Group in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate is the interest that banks charge each other for 
short-term loans. The Fed can drive the borrowing charge higher or lower by 
arranging short-term securities sales or purchases that affect the amount of 
money available in the banking system. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate was quoted at 9% late Tuesday, up from 8.50% late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said the Fed on Tuesday added reserves to the banking system because 
of seasonal needs for more money, but the move was seen as necessary and not a 
sign of a looser credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY

<P>
Dollar Heads Lower Over Rate Worries 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was generally lower as interest rate concerns continued to dominate 
the foreign exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar has fallen in recent sessions amid expectations that the Fed would 
move interest rates lower. But Monday's developments "caused a momentary 
hesitation in the market" and traders began buying dollars early in Tuesday's 
session to shore up their positions, said Robert Ryan, senior foreign exchange 
trader with the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
But the dollar continued its slide in later trading because of continuing 
expectations that interest rates would rise overseas, particularly in West 
Germany, making foreign currencies more valuable, said Jack Barbanel, president 
of First Global Asset Management Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The mark suffered from some profit taking Tuesday, but still closed higher. In 
New York, the dollar fell to 1.7770 marks from late Monday's 1.7890 after 
slipping earlier in Frankfurt to 1.7880 marks from 1.7900 late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose slightly to 143.20 Japanese yen in New York from late Monday's 
143.195. In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 143.65 Japanese yen from 143.35 
yen, and in London, the dollar traded at 143.69 yen. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar also declined against the British pound. One pound cost $1.5670 in 
New York, compared to $1.5585 late Monday, and in earlier London trading, 
sterling rose to $1.5625 from $1.5605 late Monday. 
</P>

COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bargain Hunting Leaves Metals Mixed 
</P>
<P>
Precious metal futures prices were mixed in active trading Tuesday on New 
York's Commodity Exchange as bargain hunting developed a day after profit 
taking sent prices sharply lower. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, energy futures were lower, grain and soybeans prices rose, 
and livestock and pork futures declined. 
</P>
<P>
Gold ranged from 50 cents higher to 60 cents lower, with the contract for 
delivery in December down 60 cents at $413.50 a troy ounce; silver was 2 to 6 
cents higher with December at $5.695 cents a troy ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices continued Monday's slide in early trading, but reversed direction 
as speculators began to bargain hunt. Prices also were helped as the dollar 
weakened during the day, nearing its 1989 low against the West German mark. 
</P>
<P>
"Gold continues to be bought by speculators," said analyst Peter Cardillo of 
Josephthal &amp; Co. in New York. "Basically, there still is a sense of fear 
about the strength of the economy." 
</P>
<P>
Energy prices declined sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange as traders 
reacted to news that OPEC ministers reached a new production agreement that 
would raise the group's output ceiling to 22 million barrels a day and maintain 
a target price of $18 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Robert Baker of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York said the 
agreement, reached in Vienna, "had a few more leaks in terms of quota 
discipline" than was desired by the market. 
</P>
<P>
"The agreement was signed with the recognition that the United Arab Emirates 
would continue to overproduce," Baker said, adding that Kuwait would also 
continue to surpass its quota. 
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have been producing 2 million barrels a day 
apiece, or double their current quotas. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 29 to 43 cents lower, with January at 
$19.25 a barrel; heating oil was 0.61 o 0.94 cent lower, with December at 60.31 
cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.80 cent to 1.36 cents higher, with 
December at 49.53 cents a gallon.

<P>
OPEC managed Tuesday to agree to an oil production ceiling for the first half 
of 1990, but the specter of cheating on the quotas arose immediately as the 
United Arab Emirates announced that it would do as it pleased. 
</P>
<P>
The 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced 
after six days of talks that a production limit of 22 million barrels of crude 
a day would be imposed starting Jan. 1. That would remove at least 750,000 
barrels from the market and keep the group's average oil price at about $18 a 
barrel. 
</P>
<P>
OPEC has called this its "target price," but that title was changed Tuesday to 
"minimum reference price." The markets view it differently, however, with the 
average price for OPEC oil now about $17.75 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
The new agreement parcels out specific shares for each member in hopes of 
keeping overall output by OPEC members at 22 million barrels a day to prevent a 
flooded market. The world burns more than 50 million barrels each day. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he signed the formal accord, the UAE's oil minister, Mana Said 
Oteiba, told reporters as he left the conference that he had no intention of 
observing the OPEC quota for his country of about 1.1 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
"We will limit our production to 2 million barrels a day," Oteiba said. "We are 
now producing 2.6 million barrels a day. If any member country goes above (its 
quota) we will produce more." 
</P>
<P>
With that, he turned on his heels and strode out of OPEC's headquarters to a 
waiting limousine. 
</P>
<P>
A senior OPEC minister branded him privately as "an outcast" and said he was 
skeptical that the UAE could produce that much oil. "That 2.6 million figure is 
ridiculous," said the minister, who did not want to be quoted by name. 
</P>
<P>
Oil markets in the United States looked on the UAE's flouting of its quota as 
bearish, and the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate dropped 38 cents a 
barrel to $19.25 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts said the new agreement could slow an expected decline in 
prices in the first half of the year, when oil demand usually weakens. 
</P>
<P>
And Hisham Nazer, the influential oil minister of Saudi Arabia, told reporters 
that prices "will steadily go up after the market ascertains the durability of 
the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Oil industry sources said the UAE does not want to accept a binding single 
quota because each of the seven emirates that make up the UAE has sovereignty 
over its own oil and mineral resources. 
</P>
<P>
OPEC did manage to persuade another big Persian Gulf producer, Kuwait, to 
return to the fold. Kuwait had also flouted the rules, but has how agreed to 
cut production to 1.5 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
Libya was unhappy that it got too little out of the agreement. "Libya will 
continue to have reservations on the quota because it did not satisfy us," its 
oil minister, Fawzi Shakshouki, said of its daily share of 1.233 million 
barrels. It now produces 1.15 million, but wanted a higher number. 
</P>
<P>
Ecuador said it would produce 7,000 to 17,000 barrels a day above its new quota 
of 273,000 barrels because of hard economic times. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's Nazer said the pact would cut a total 1.2 million to 1.3 million 
barrels a day. But analysts said the cut would be more like 750,000 barrels if 
everyone plays by the rules. 
</P>
<P>
Fergus MacLeod, an oil analyst with the London investment firm Barclays de 
Zoete Wedd Ltd. said the agreement "looks better than most people thought was 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Nicol, an analyst at Warburg Securities in London, said: "They haven't 
cut production as much as the market would like to see. It's probably not 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister, told a news conference 
that OPEC would meet again if prices do not reach the $18-a-barrel minimum. The

COLT INDUSTRIES TO SELL ITS TROUBLED FIREARMS UNIT

Colt Industries Inc. said Tuesday that it would sell its beleaguered firearms 
division to a group of investors in a deal that could end a nearly 4-year-old 
strike by some union workers. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the sale to CF Holding Corp., which includes a Colt executive and two 
former United Technologies Corp. officials, were not disclosed. Analysts had 
said they expected the sale to bring between $150 million and $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
The deal at the 153-year-old company that makes the Colt .45 pistol ended 3 1/2 
months of negotiations as well as attempts by striking union workers to buy the 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Dunn, a spokesman for New York-based Colt Industries, said company 
officials expected to complete the sale in January. The new company will be 
called Colt's Manufacturing Co. 
</P>
<P>
The new owners said they did not know how many people will be employed by the 
company, but they extended an offer of sorts to striking United Auto Workers 
who walked off the job in January, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony D. Autorino, one of the investors, said the new company would contact 
current and striking Colt workers immediately and begin hiring based on skill 
and seniority within three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We think this will work out well for the people of Connecticut and the workers 
as well," Autorino said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Colt currently employs about 950 workers at plants in Hartford and West 
Hartford. Another 800 union workers are still on strike. 
</P>
<P>
Colt was founded in Hartford in 1836 by Samuel Colt, who invented the revolver. 
The firearms division is a leading manufacturer of handguns and rifles for 
military and commercial uses. 
</P>
<P>
Products include the Colt .45 pistol, the King Cobra Magnum revolver, AR-15 
sport rifle and the M-16 military rifle. The company also makes aerospace and 
automotive parts. 
</P>
<P>
Colt lost its contract to produce the M-16 for the Army in 1988. The loss of 
that contract, coupled with the strike, apparently figured in Colt's decision 
to sell that division, but company officials deny it played a role. 
</P>
<P>
"The buyout of Colt Firearms division by the CF Holding Corp. offers us an 
opportunity to write a new chapter for Colt workers, and I am hopeful that all 
the elements of this will come together," Phillip Wheeler, executive director 
of the UAW's Region 9A, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The investors include Autorino, former president of United Technologies' 
Hamilton Standard division and now president of Wethersfield-based Shared 
Technologies; Richard F. Gamble, another former president of Hamilton Standard, 
and Ronald F. Stilwell, Colt Firearm's vice president for military sales. 
</P>
<P>
Autorino declined to identify the remaining investors. 
</P>
<P>
When Colt announced in April it was seeking a buyer, the union and managers of 
the firearms division combined forces with the state and private investors to 
make a bid. State officials declined to comment on Tuesday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,050 union workers walked off the job Jan. 24, 1986, after failing to 
reach agreement on a new contract during 10 months of negotiations. Some 
workers have crossed picket lines and others have found new jobs, leaving about 
800 on strike. Replacement workers have been hired to fill their positions. 
</P>
<P>
Autorino said the Colt plants are to close briefly in January to allow for 
inventory and transition. He said the plants should be operating at full 
capacity by March, 1990.

Westinghouse Electric Corp. said it sold its tethered aerostat systems unit to 
a limited partnership of Craig Capital Corp. and MH Equity Corp., an affiliate 
of Manufacturers Hanover Corp. of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The sale to TCOM L.P. involves Westinghouse administrative and engineering 
operations in Hanover, Md., and a leased aerostat assembly and test facility in 
Elizabeth City, N.C. These units presently employ 120 workers. 
</P>
<P>
"Westinghouse decided to divest its tethered aerostat systems activities 
because the systems are no longer in the mainstream of our electronic systems 
business focus," said Milton Borkowski, general manager of Westinghouse's 
Command and Control Divisions.

BOMB SCARE AT AIRPORT IS JUST A CHILD'S GAME; 
</P>
<P>
 TERRORISM: IT LOOKED LIKE DYNAMITE IN THE X-RAY. BUT WHEN POLICE BLEW UP BAG, 
THEY FOUND NINTENDO.

<P>
To the U.S. Customs Service agent at Los Angeles International Airport, the 
object spotted by an X-ray machine in a piece of luggage bound for Colombia on 
an Avianca Airlines jet looked like "three sticks of dynamite, bound together." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Department bomb squad experts weren't willing to get that 
descriptive, but after viewing the X-rays early today they decided they had a 
"suspicious device" on their hands. They hauled it out to a remote spot at the 
western edge of the airport and blew it to smithereens. Then they examined the 
smithereens. 
</P>
<P>
The device turned out to be a Nintendo video game. Or what was left of one. 
</P>
<P>
None of the agencies involved -- not the airline, not the police, not customs, 
or the FBI, which was called in on the case -- criticized the operation. 
</P>
<P>
All of them agreed that, in the wake of the explosion of an Avianca jetliner 
over Colombia earlier this week, the concerns that led to the destruction of 
the luggage were well founded. 
</P>
<P>
The flight for which the luggage had been destined -- Avianca's Flight 73 to 
Bogota -- had originally been scheduled to leave LAX at 7:20 p.m. Tuesday. 
Because of mechanical problems, the jet to be used on the flight was held up at 
Mexico City, and Flight 73 was rescheduled for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, screening of the baggage for Flight 73 at LAX's Bradley 
International Terminal was delayed until about 12:30 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lovern, a customs supervisor at the airport, said the screening is a 
routine procedure for Avianca flights that has been intensified because of 
Monday's explosion of an Avianca Boeing 727 jetliner shortly after takeoff from 
Bogota that killed all 107 aboard. Drug traffickers have claimed they bombed 
the jet. 
</P>
<P>
Lovern said he was studying the images of the baggage passing through the X-ray 
machine shortly after midnight when he saw "the image of three sticks of 
dynamite, bound together," in a piece of soft-sided luggage. 
</P>
<P>
He said he ran the piece through again, and saw the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
The customs supervisor said he called Los Angeles Airport Police, who called 
Los Angeles police, who dispatched their bomb squad.

The Legislature today passed a motion urging the forced return of Vietnamese 
refugees, and several lawmakers condemned U.S. opposition to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Council vote reflected the strong local sentiment to rid this 
British colony of the nearly 57,000 Vietnamese languishing in squalid detention 
centers after fleeing their communist homeland by boat. 
</P>
<P>
"Mandatory repatriation is a must, and it should have been implemented 
yesterday," lawmaker Rita Fan said during the debate. 
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers attributed Washington's position to a "guilty conscience," a 
reference to the U.S. role in the Vietnam War.

<P>
The son of actress Susan Cabot, star of numerous 1950s "B" movies, was 
sentenced today to three years' probation for bludgeoning her to death with a 
metal bar in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Scott Roman, 25, an art student at Pierce College, was sentenced by Van 
Nuys Superior Court Judge Darlene Schempp, who convicted him Oct. 10 of 
involuntary manslaughter after a non-jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
Roman, who was born a dwarf but took steroids and other drugs as a child to 
stimulate his growth to his current 5-feet-4, could have been sentenced to up 
to six years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Cabot, 59, who had been plagued by mental and emotional problems, was 
bludgeoned to death by her son in their Encino home Dec. 10, 1986.

A 15-year-old girl was expected to be released from a hospital into police 
custody today, a day after she gave birth to a baby boy who was found dead 
lying face down in a toilet in a girl's high school bathroom, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
While an autopsy was conducted this morning on the baby, Garden Grove police 
said the Santiago High School honor student could face manslaughter charges or 
worse in connection with the death. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll not really know for sure what we'll do until after the autopsy," said 
Garden Grove Police Lt. Chuck Gibbs. He added that, for now, "we're handling it 
as a homicide." 
</P>
<P>
The girl, a sophomore whose name was not released because of her age, was 
arrested Tuesday for investigation of homicide. (Story, A1). The girl was taken 
to UCI Medical Center in Orange and will be booked directly at Orange County 
Juvenile Hall upon her release, Gibbs said. He said authorities fear that the 
girl may run away if released into the custody of her family, 
</P>
<P>
Santiago High School Principal Bob O'Higgins said he told the school's 1,900 
students of the tragedy this morning in brief remarks over the loudspeaker 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically I explained the tragedy and that there was an ongoing investigation 
and that I appreciate how they handled the situation," he said.

<P>
Fresh battles in San Salvador today forced the U.S. Embassy to close down, and 
left-wing rebels demanded the evacuation of leading hotels in embattled 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
As the crash of exploding mortar shells resounded through the fashionable 
western part of the capital, security guards and Salvadoran army officers at 
the bunker-like U.S. mission said it had been closed until further notice due 
to the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat said there was shooting throughout Escalon, San Benito and 
Lomas de San Francisco, where most of the U.S. personnel live. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not safe ... to drive the streets to go to work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Radio Venceremos, the radio station of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
front (FMLN), meanwhile, called for the evacuation of three leading hotels in 
the area -- the Sheraton, the Hotel Terraza and the Presidente. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the rebels shot their 
way into several homes, including the residence of a U.S. Embassy officer, but 
were driven out by Salvadoran armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment it is our belief that all United States personnel and their 
families are safe," Baker told reporters at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"This might represent something of a desperation effort by the FMLN," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A soundman for the U.S.-based Spanish-language television station Univision was 
hit by a bullet in the shoulder while covering battles in Escalon, where the 
guerrillas had seized parts of the Sheraton last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A photographer said he saw an armored personnel carrier that had been blown up 
early today in an apparent guerrilla ambush about four blocks from the 
Sheraton. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of five dead soldiers lay on the street nearby, and guerrillas 
picked through their pockets, searching for ammunition and valuables. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting around Escalon followed a night of battles in areas stretched 
along a southeastern arc, witnesses and residents reported. 
</P>
<P>
Using the darkness of night, guerrillas slipped into positions only about 1,000 
yards from the headquarters of the armed forces chiefs of staff, an army 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"They used mortars and rifles, but they failed to do damage to the building," 
he said, adding that the casualty toll stood at 12 guerrillas and five soldiers 
dead since the fighting flared.

Former Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) was released today from a hospital where 
he underwent hip replacement surgery earlier this month. He said he feels fine. 
</P>
<P>
"If I don't run out of parts, I'll probably be here the rest of my life," said 
Goldwater, 80, referring to St. Luke's Medical Center, where he has had several 
major reconstructive surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
Goldwater has suffered from degenerative arthritis of his hips and knees since 
his early 60s. 
</P>
<P>
The Nov. 14 surgery replaced an artificial right hip he received in 1975. 
Goldwater had similar surgery on his left hip in June, and also has had his 
left knee replaced.

The Air Force has chosen bases in six states -- Louisiana, Texas, Washington, 
North Dakota, Arkansas and Michigan -- as sites for the railroad-based version 
of the MX nuclear missile, Defense Department sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
The sites are: Barksdale Air Force Base, La.; Dyess AFB, Tex.; Fairchild AFB in 
Washington; Grand Forks AFB, N.D.; Little Rock AFB, Ark., and Wurtsmith AFB, 
Mich., the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty of the 10-warhead MX missiles are to be taken from silos at Warren AFB in 
Wyoming and placed on 25 trains, each with two MX missiles aboard, said the 
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The missiles are to be kept at the military sites and moved out onto civilian 
railroad tracks in time of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Ten sites had been under consideration. Those not chosen included Eaker AFB in 
Arkansas; Malmstrom AFB in Montana; Minot AFB, N.D.; and Whiteman AFB, Mo., the

Israeli Vice Prime Minister Shimon Peres, on a pilgrimage to Auschwitz, urged 
Polish authorities today to remove a Roman Catholic convent from the former 
Nazi death camp as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this stain will be taken away soon. I discussed the issue with the 
Polish government and they promised to deal with it," Polish-born Peres said as 
he stood by the death camp's outer wall, to which the Carmelite convent is 
joined. 
</P>
<P>
The convent was established in 1984 to allow nuns to pray for the 4 million 
people, most of them Jews, killed at Auschwitz by the Nazis during World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
An international dispute started when Jewish leaders demanded the convent's 
removal. Poland's Roman Catholic church eventually agreed to move the nuns but 
has not said when it will do so.

DOW DROPS 13.23; TRADERS GROW WARY OVER INTEREST

<P>
The stock market fell in generally lackluster trading today amid continued 
uncertainty about interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 13.23 points to 2,688.78. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 3 to 2 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 897 issues up, 577 down and 479 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 147.27 million shares, against 153.77 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index lost 1.08 to 190.26. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 1.46 to 373.64. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said computerized trading strategies helped push stock prices lower in 
the final hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks came under pressure from the opening as investors took profits after the 
market's recent gains. The Dow had gained nearly 70 points in the last five 
trading sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the stock and bond markets largely ignored reports on 
third-quarter gross national product and corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Wachtel, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said investors 
were focusing on the current quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the market is concerned, that is dated material," Wachtel said. "We 
now know the economy is floundering and corporate profits are floundering." 
</P>
<P>
Bank stocks came under pressure today after Southwest Bank of St. Louis 
announced that it was raising its prime rate back to 10.5% from 10% after 
cutting it three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said, however, that the market's sluggishness is merely a pause 
after the recent run-up in stock prices and before the start of a pre-Christmas 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
"It's two days overdue," said Ralph Bloch, chief market analyst with Raymond, 
James &amp; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices posted minor losses early today amid disappointment about the 
chances for an imminent cut in interest rates; analysts believe that the GNP 
report will not cause the Federal Reserve Board to alter its cautious approach 
to credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank is expected to wait for clear signs of substantial economic 
weakness before loosening its hold on credit, which would lead to lower 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond dropped 5/32 point, or less than $1.50 
for every $1,000 face amount. It yield, which rises when the price falls, 
increased to 7.92% from 7.90% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Market analyst Jack Barbanel of First Global Asset Management Inc. said the 
Commerce Department's revised estimate of economic growth in the third quarter 
was close to expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're going to take an extremely cautious approach to lowering 
interest rates," Barbanel said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he does not attach much significance to an increase in the federal 
funds rate today, attributing its movement to technical factors. The rate was 
quoted at 9 1/8% this morning, up from 9% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts watch the fed funds rate for clues about the central bank's policy 
intentions. Last week the markets apparently misinterpreted a drop in the rate 
to mean that the Fed was moving aggressively to encourage interest rate 
declines. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate is the interest that banks charge each other for 
short-term loans, and the Fed can drive the borrowing charge higher or lower by 
arranging short-term securities sales or purchases that affect the amount of 
money available in the banking system. 
</P>
<P>
Today is the last day of a two-week reserve maintenance period and banks were 
trying to acquire funds to meet reserve requirements. This could account for 
the rise in the closely watched rate. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term 
governments were unchanged to 1/32 point lower, intermediate maturities fell 
1/32 point to 3/32 point and long-term issues were down by 1/8 point to 5/32 
point, according to the Telerate Inc., financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, 
declined 0.58 to 1,193.22.

Turner Broadcasting System Inc. has sent representatives to California to study 
MGM/UA Communications Co.'s financial records, even though the Turner board 
recently cut off discussions on a bid for the troubled movie studio, it was 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Constitution quoted unidentified sources as saying Turner 
Broadcasting is researching finances of the studio to help Chairman Ted Turner 
ascertain a "fair price" for MGM/UA. Turner spokesmen had no comment on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts have estimated the studio could sell for $1.7 billion. But a 
previous $1.5-billion MGM/UA sale agreement with Qintex Australia Ltd. fell 
apart in October, and News Corp. Ltd., which bid $1.25 billion for the studio, 
apparently dropped out of the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner wants to bid for MGM/UA in partnership with Tele-Communications Inc. 
of Denver, the nation's largest cable-TV operator and Turner Broadcasting's 
biggest shareholder after Turner, the paper said.

President Bush plans to nominate Assistant Treasury Secretary David W. Mullins 
Jr. to fill a vacancy on the Federal Reserve Board, an Administration source 
said today.

<P>
Mullins, 43, one of the chief architects of the Administration's bailout bill 
for the savings and loan industry, has served in his current position since 
October, 1988. Before that he taught at the Harvard Business School. 
</P>
<P>
He was also the No. 2 staff member on the task force named by then-President 
Ronald Reagan to study the October, 1987, stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
At the Fed, Mullins would succeed H. Robert Heller, who resigned from the 
seven-member board in June to become executive vice president of Visa 
International, the credit card company. The term of the vacancy runs to Jan. 
31, 1996.

A Los Angeles judge ruled that the latest sports videotape featuring comedian 
Tim Conway's diminutive "Dorf" character can be shipped to stores despite a 
distributor's claim that it was unfairly cut out of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Kurt J. Lewin ruled Tuesday that J2 Communications Inc. 
has the first right of refusal for distribution of "Dorf" videos only when they 
are produced by Longshot Enterprises Inc., of which Conway is the majority 
owner. Lewin said the story idea and production of the new "Dorf Goes Auto 
Racing" came from Liaison East Inc., so the distribution contract between J2 
and Longshot does not apply. 
</P>
<P>
J2 distributed the first three "Dorf" videos, "Dorf on Golf," "Dorf and the 
First Games of Mt. Olympus" and "Dorf's Golf Bible."

Aksa International, a Japanese conglomerate, paid $6.8 million for Paul 
Gauguin's 1889 painting of a Breton boy in a landscape at an auction at 
Sotheby's Tuesday night of impressionist and modern paintings. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauguin was one of five works that together brought nearly $17 million for 
the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu. The museum recently sent 15 works to 
Sotheby's for auction, saying they represented the private taste of the oil 
billionaire, who died in 1976. The museum said it will use the proceeds to 
acquire other works better suited to its collection and public display. 
</P>
<P>
The top price at the London auction was $8.9 million, phoned in by an anonymous 
bidder for one of Claude Monet's water lily paintings.

Star magazine has sued Don Johnson, claiming that the former "Miami Vice" star 
encouraged a bodyguard to fire shotgun blasts at a helicopter trying to cover 
his June remarriage to actress Melanie Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's publicist, Elliot Mintz, said Tuesday that the supermarket tabloid's 
allegations are "a complete fabrication, just a pathetic attempt to sell some 
magazines." 
</P>
<P>
The Star claimed that a photographer and reporter aboard the helicopter were 
injured. The lawsuit, filed in Pitkin County Court, also named Greg Isaacs, 
described as a Johnson bodyguard who "lay in wait for the helicopter and . . . 
ambushed the aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
An investigation by the Pitkin County Sheriff's Department and the Colorado 
Bureau of Investigation concluded that shots probably were fired from Isaacs' 
gun and hit the helicopter. Isaacs told investigators he was skeet shooting. No 
charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
The tabloid, reporter Barry Levine, Thunderbird Helicopters of Montrose and 
pilot Burt Metcalf are seeking unspecified damages from Johnson and Isaacs. 
</P>
<P>
Mintz said Johnson and his attorney haven't seen the lawsuit and could not 
comment.

University of Nebraska officials plan to name a new theater for Johnny Carson, 
and not just because the talk show host studied radio and speech at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Carson made a "very, very generous" contribution to construction of the 
$20-million Lied Center for Performing Arts at the University of 
Nebraska-Lincoln campus, project director Sheila Griffin said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin said she wrote Carson asking whether a multiuse space at the center 
that seats about 2,300 people could be named the Johnny Carson Theater. He 
agreed as long as the amount of his donation was not revealed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin said Carson had asked that his contribution be anonymous when he made 
it during a fund-raising campaign that ended in 1986. Since the Lied Center has 
been completed, names of benefactors who gave $50,000 or more are being placed 
on various parts of the building and on pieces of the equipment in it, she 
said.

LIZ SMITH: LOOK WHO'S TALKING ABOUT TRAVOLTA'S 'RETURN'

"COMEBACK? I hate that word. It's return -- a return to the millions of people 
who've never forgiven me for deserting the screen!" -- Gloria Swanson as the 
splendidly self-deluded Norma Desmond in "Sunset Boulevard," written by Billy 
Wilder and Charles Brackett. 
</P>
<P>
JOHN TRAVOLTA's presence in the mega-hit comedy "Look Who's Talking" has 
certainly heated up the actor's recently ice-cold career. So much so that Amy 
Heckerling, the writer and director of "Look Who's Talking," has pitched to 
Paramount the idea of starring Travolta in a third follow-up to his 1978 smash, 
"Saturday Night Fever." This would continue the adventures of one-time disco 
king and Broadway dancer Tony Manero (Sylvester Stallone directed John in the 
"Staying Alive" sequel -- reshaping his body at the same time.) 
</P>
<P>
If "Saturday Night Fever III" gets the green light, Heckerling will once again 
put Travolta through his paces. And a success in this project would firmly 
re-establish John as a hot box-office commodity all on his own. That is, 
without an adorable baby spouting wisecracks in Bruce Willis' voice. Comeback 
or return, it's good to have Travolta circulating. 
</P>
<P>
VANESSA REDGRAVE ends her 12-week limited engagement of "Orpheus Descending" on 
Sunday, Dec. 17, and Broadway will be considerably less exciting with this 
brilliant, controversial actress gone from the boards. The moment Vanessa ends 
her rigors portraying Tennessee Williams' tragic Lady, the actress will undergo 
microsurgery on her knee. It was injured some time ago during the early run of 
"Orpheus." The producers say that Vanessa was scheduled to end her run on the 
17th anyway, but if the star had been able to continue her dazzling and 
athletic performance without pain, it seems likely that "Orpheus," which has 
been the highest grossing play on Broadway every week since its opening, would 
have extended its run. 
</P>

K.D. LANG will "absolutely torch and twang" the TV airwaves on "Saturday Night 
Live" this weekend. She now plans to be really "live from New York." The 
Canadian singing sensation wants to bring back Irving Berlin's great musical 
"Annie Get Your Gun." Ethel Merman immortalized Annie on stage and Betty Hutton 
did the 1950 movie version. A revival of this rousing show is overdue and 
wouldn't k.d. be perfect belting out those Berlin showstoppers -- "Doin' What 
Comes Naturally" and "You Can't Get a Man With A Gun"? K.D. Lang as Annie 
Oakley -- on Broadway -- an idea whose time has definitely come!

never tell. Like many another glamorous lady of a certain age, Tina appreciates 
the value of illusion.

SACRAMENTO RAIDER BID HITS A SNAG

<P>
Just as Sacramento closed the sale on $40 million in bonds to lure the Los 
Angeles Raiders, its bid for the team appeared to founder over a local 
partnership'sinsistence that it own part of the team. 
</P>
<P>
That issue has been a sticking point since negotiations started eight months 
ago. But with every other issue virtually resolved it now threatens a deal that 
has come tantalizingly close in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of local ownership is important," City Manager Walter Slipe said 
Tuesday, "but I'd hate to see the whole thing fall apart over it." 
</P>
<P>
Slipe said he'd be particularly upset since city officials have done everything 
they've been told was necessary, including the selling of bonds to help raise a 
$50-million franchise relocation fee to help land the team. 
</P>
<P>
Like almost every other point in Sacramento's bid for the National Football 
League franchise, the ownership question has taken numerous odd twists. 
</P>
<P>
First, according to the partnership led by Gregg Lukenbill and the Sacramento 
Sports Assn., Raiders managing general partner Al Davis agreed to sell 20% of 
his team for about $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
But as talks progressed and other issues were resolved, Davis, who has refused 
all interview requests on the subject, became more and more reluctant to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually he agreed to allow an option to buy. The option could be exercised 
five years after the team starts playing in Sacramento, probably by 1996, but 
at today's prices. If he wanted to block exercise of the option, Davis would 
have to pay Lukenbill's group whatever the 20% share was worth in 1996 dollars 
-- up to $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
Davis would also get paper ownership of a new stadium and $45 million in tax 
depreciation and guarantees of $115 million or five years of sellouts. 
</P>
<P>
But Lukenbill, who as late as Tuesday was saying privately that ownership was 
not necessary for him to make the deal, has told Davis in the last 10 days that 
an option to buy was not enough. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, at a meeting in Los Angeles two weeks ago, the two strong-willed men 
were on the verge of a handshake agreement that would move the Raiders to 
Sacramento for the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
But Lukenbill abruptly left that meeting after Davis laid out his ownership 
proposal.

Carl Lewis said today that he will not try to "bully my way" into the 1990 
Goodwill Games, despite a ruling that excludes those who don't compete in next 
year's national outdoor championships. 
</P>
<P>
The rule was passed by the International Competition Committee of The Athletics 
Congress. The Goodwill Games are in Seattle July 20-Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want me to be there, I'll be there. If not, I won't be there," said 
Lewis, a six-time Olympic medalist. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis boycotted this year's championships in his hometown of Houston because of 
"ideological differences" with TAC, the national governing body for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
He said he does not plan to compete in the 1990 national championships, to be 
held in California in June, because he will not be prepared to run until July.

Al Luginbill, San Diego State University's head football coach, has agreed to a

</P>
<P>
The pact announced Tuesday amounts to a one-year extension for Luginbill, 42,

to replace the fired Denny Stolz. Terms of the new deal were not disclosed. 
</P>

In his first full season as the Aztecs' coach, Luginbill's team posted a 6-5-1

Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Italy, Spain and West Germany will be the seeded

governing body, said in an interview published today. 
</P>
<P>
The seeds for the 1990 World Cup will be announced formally Dec. 7, two days 
before the draw. The newspaper reported that Havelange said Argentina, West 
Germany and Belgium would be seeded on the basis of the 1986 World Cup results 
in Mexico; Argentina won the title, West Germany finished second and Belgium 
was a semifinalist. 
</P>
<P>
"Italy, as host country, and Brazil are also certain seeds, while Spain is 
going to take over for Mexico," Havelange was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Each seed will be placed in one of the six groups whose initial games are 
scheduled in 12 Italian cities. The World Cup finals begin at Milan on June 8, 
with the final in Rome's Olympic Stadium on July 8.

HIALEAH LOSING MONEY, MAY END SEASON EARLY

<P>
Historic Hialeah Park, competing head-to-head for the first time against nearby 
Calder Race Course, has lost an estimated $68,000 a day since its season began 
Nov. 18. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 10 days of the meet, Hialeah averaged 2,715 fans wagering 
$224,276 a day. That's a 62% drop in attendance and an 80.5% drop in handle 
from corresponding days in 1987's unopposed fall meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The track is already an estimated $680,000 in the red this season when 
operating expenses, salaries and purse money are considered. Projected over the 
full 158-day meet, the losses would come to $10.74 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not quitters," said John Brunetti Jr., Hialeah general manager and son 
of the track's owner. "We'll be here until we are dead or have empty pockets." 
</P>
<P>
But Brunetti acknowledged Hialeah might end the season before the scheduled May 
20 closing. 
</P>
<P>
Head-to-head competition, the result of state deregulation that left racing 
dates up to each track, has had less of an impact on Calder. The Miami track is 
down 7.2% in average attendance to 7,453 and 12.6% in handle to $1.06 million 
compared with a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Hialeah's bad business is costing the state money, too. The first $300,000 of 
the betting handle is non-taxable. There have been only two days when Hialeah 
exceeded that total and the state collected revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"The state is very concerned that it is losing money and that one of its 
better-known race tracks may close," said Van Jones, director of the state 
Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering. 
</P>
<P>
Hialeah, regarded by some as the world's most beautiful race track, has been in 
decline for years, a victim of its location and competition with Calder and 
Gulfstream Park in Hallandale, Fla.

END-OF-YEAR PLAYOFF FOR COLLEGE FOOTBALL IS A SURE-FIRE LOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN EISENABERG, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that Miami has stopped Notre Dame's 13-month run at the top of the college 
football rankings -- and what a beating that was, incidentally -- this season 
could have the most uproarious finish in years. 
</P>
<P>
There is the possibility of sheer madness, that no team will be unbeaten and 
that seven will have one loss when the bowls are over. (I would pay to see the 
coaches argue it out in a locked room.) There also is a chance that two teams, 
Colorado and Alabama, will finish unbeaten, untied and understandably 
possessive of the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
The call for a championship tournament will go up again, as it always does when 
opinion, not football, determines the No. 1 team. But you will not hear my 
voice in the chorus. The idea of a playoff is not without merit, but it is 
flawed and would damage the fabric of the sport. The cons outweigh the pros. 
</P>
<P>
The aspect of a playoff that appeals to so many is, of course, the spotless 
finish, the clean lines to No. 1. There would be no debate about who played a 
tougher non-conference schedule or an easier bowl opponent. No complaining 
about regionalism or the whims of poll voters. The championship would be 
decided on the field. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, it would be interesting this year to put eight teams in a bracket 
and see who survived. Certainly, a Final Four of Miami, Michigan, Colorado and 
Notre Dame would result in terrific games. (Sorry, Alabama. You're a 
first-round loser.) 
</P>
<P>
But there still are better reasons not to put on a tournament. It is an 
emotional play, mostly. College football is professional enough already. A 
playoff would exact a great toll on the sport's original, vibrant nature. 
</P>
<P>
You can start with what would happen to the bowls. Even if they were 
incorporated into the tournament as game sites, the New Year's Day bowls would 
be stripped of their importance, one-upped as a forum for determining No. 1. 
That would be unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
The bowls may be a sprawling, eccentric brotherhood, but they have served the 
sport well, providing a strong tradition, dozens of memorable games and fodder 
for an endless supply of speculative gossip. 
</P>
<P>
The bowls also have proved adept at determining a champion. That is the best 
rebuttal to any pro-playoff argument: Hey, the current system works fine. In 10 
of the last 13 years, a clear No. 1 has emerged from the bowls with either a 
perfect record or, at least, the best record in the land. 
</P>
<P>
You can look it up. Only three times since 1976 has there been debate after the 
last touchdown of the season. (Four times if you include the year Brigham Young 
beat a lousy Michigan team in the Holiday Bowl and finished No. 1, to loud 
hooting.) 
</P>
<P>
And, anyway, is it so awful to confront a little gray area occasionally? With 
the pursuit of No. 1 so often grim and relentless in sports these days, college 
football, with its system of polls, partiality and debate, is like a funny, 
quirky uncle who doesn't quite conform to the family. He is different, and, for 
that reason, interesting. 
</P>
<P>
The point is that arguing, and differences of opinion, are part of the sport's 
basic, chaotic appeal. A playoff not only would wipe out the dialogue, but also 
probably affect changes reaching the very core of the game. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, no longer would Big Ten players spend all fall striving to play 
in the Rose Bowl, as they have since World War II. Now the Rose Bowl wouldn't 
be that important. The players would strive to make the tournament (the Sony 
College Football Championship?) and probably get sent to Orlando to play their 
big game. How's that for romance? 
</P>
<P>
It is even possible, if the bowls were used as playoff sites, that the Big Ten 
champions wouldn't go to the Rose Bowl. Few conference champions would wind up 
at their traditional bowls. Take the Southeastern Conference out of the Sugar 
Bowl? Southwest out of the Cotton? It isn't right. 
</P>
<P>
Call me sentimental, but it is wrong to wipe out the whole of a sport's 
tradition in one giant, made-for-TV swoop, especially to make room for a 
sterile tournament that probably would send teams all over the country 
throughout Christmas break for a series of games at neutral sites, far away 
from fans and students. One such game, a bowl, is fine. But no more than that. 
Hasn't the sport already been sufficiently disenfranchised from college life? 
</P>
<P>
Some will say this year's potential poll madness drives home the need for a 
playoff. To me, it only drives home the need to keep things as they are. The 
plot is as convoluted as a soap opera, almost a football whodunit, or 
who-won-it. Pay close attention: 
</P>
<P>
Colorado will be No. 1 if it beats Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl, although if 
Alabama beats Auburn Saturday and also Miami in the Sugar Bowl, the Crimson 
Tide will scream about its candidacy. If Notre Dame wins the Orange Bowl and 
Miami wins the Sugar Bowl, Miami probably will get the most votes of the many 
one-loss teams, although Michigan will scream if it wins the Rose Bowl. And 
psst: Notre Dame could slip back in if Miami and Michigan lose. 
</P>
<P>
It is all messy, loud and hysterical, and college football would be sadly 
diminished without it. 
</P>
<P>
There is an apt analogy in architecture. The championship tournament would be a 
chrome-and-glass skyscraper, modern, cooly efficient, huge. The current 
arrangement is a rambling, old mansion: big, a little imperfect, full of life. 
Give me the latter any day.

YEARLONG RECORD CHASE HAS DESORMEAUX WITH ONE VICTORY TO ACHIEVE 
</P>

<P>
Kent Desormeaux's yearlong record chase has endured two days of letdowns and 
disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
Since pulling within one winner of Chris McCarron's 15-year-old record of 546 
victories in a year on Sunday, Desormeaux has ridden in 12 races without a 
visit to the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
That has made for 12 hopeful pre-race conversations with 12 trainers and 12 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
"They all say: 'I hope it's this one. I'd like to be in the circle when the 
record breaks.' Right now they all want to be there when I tie it," Desormeaux 
said after coming up empty Tuesday. (Story in Section C.) 
</P>
<P>
"I can see the anticipation and desire to be there to enjoy the feeling of it 
all. Today (Tuesday) and all day (Sunday) it's been a letdown to them." 
</P>
<P>
Laurel is dark today and Desormeaux, who has promised to stay in Maryland to 
break the record, has been named on horses in six of the track's 10 scheduled 
races Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Christmas season, and my fiancee is off tomorrow, we'll probably do some 
Christmas shopping," Desormeaux said Tuesday. "We've got some things to do 
about the wedding and to go home for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll just probably be out . . . tackling the malls, and just trying to forget 
about all this." 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux will be trying to file away his second day of failing to equal 
McCarron's mark. He came away without a winner in five mounts at Laurel 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A day off can only do some good for Desormeaux, who has won once in his last 16 
mounts, and has three winners in his last 26 mounts after averaging better than 
one winner in every four rides the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
With 11 mounts on Sunday, including five favorites, Desormeaux won only once, 
giving him 545 victories in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still a long two away," Desormeaux said. "It's like the last two pounds 
of a diet. This is where it really gets tough." 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux even heard a few boos after his final ride Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been really good up until the last race," he said of the boo birds. 
"They know there wasn't much stock today." 
</P>
<P>
Or much action for the rider who has been averaging eight or nine mounts a day. 
Three of the horses he was named to ride on Tuesday were scratched. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little upset," he said. "It's not usual for me to only ride five 
horses. We always do the best we can with what we have to work with. . . . We 
had three scratches. That would have been three extra shots. We're playing to 
win. We only played half the time today."

FREE-CHOICE SCHOOLING GETS AN 'A' IN RICHMOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

RICHMOND, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until a year and a half ago, Myron Ho attended a private school. Now he is a 
seventh-grader at Adams Middle School in the once-declining Richmond Unified 
School District, and his parents couldn't be happier. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a lot more choices here; there are always new challenges," said Myron's 
mother, Patti Ho, who turned to the public school system because she and her 
husband were allowed to choose which of the district's schools they felt would 
be best for their son. 
</P>
<P>
Yvonne Smith pulled her son, Tashyia, 13, out of his neighborhood school, where 
he was getting F's and "hanging around certain elements. Now he's earning A's 
at Adams. 
</P>
<P>
Since reopening two years ago as a school for gifted and talented sixth-, 
seventh- and eighth-graders, Adams has become a showcase for proponents of an 
increasingly popular movement to let parents choose among public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond Unified is the only district in California to have fully embraced the 
much-debated parental choice concept, and both parents and school officials say 
that it has produced dramatic improvements. In the two years since the choice 
system began, enrollment has been climbing, unexcused absences have dropped by 
50%, suspensions are down by 60% and achievement scores have been rising 
dramatically, district officials say. 
</P>
<P>
In California Assessment Program standardized test results for eighth-graders 
released earlier this month, Richmond's students scored a combined average of 
241 points. That is still below the statewide average of 263. But the 
district's three-year improvement of 29 points is well ahead of the state 
average growth of 16 points. Results for other grade levels were similar. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, students are not permitted to transfer out of a district. But 
at least two school districts -- Irvine and Santa Ana -- allow intradistrict 
transfers when space at each school permits. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, there is not a whole lot of action on open enrollments going on 
here," said Mike Kilbourn, director of special services for the county 
Department of Education. "Everybody is waiting to see what happens in the 
Legislature next year." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) has a bill pending that would extend an 
existing law, scheduled to expire next June, that allows students to seek 
enrollment in districts where their parents are employed. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Allen said the bill is intended to be a "pro-family statute" 
that will allow parents to be close to their children in the event of an 
emergency. It will also ease the burden of child care and lets parents and 
children share "quality time during commutes," the spokesman added. 
</P>
<P>
According to a poll conducted last August for The Times Orange County Edition, 
62% of county residents favored the open-enrollment concept and 31% opposed it. 
School administrators, however, said they disapprove of such a practice. 
</P>
<P>
But in Richmond, attitudes are different. "Choice brought students back into 
school district," said Adams Principal Myra Silverman, who has a long waiting 
list for the school's program of basic academics bolstered by about 300 
electives. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Richmond will host the last of five meetings held by U.S. Education 
Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos, who has called parental choice the "cornerstone to 
restructuring" public education. 
</P>
<P>
Attended by about 1,000 parents, educators and policy-makers, the three-day 
conference that began Tuesday in this East San Francisco Bay Area city provides 
a way for the Bush Administration to stump for open enrollment as the premier 
means of improving public schools. 
</P>
<P>
The free-market, low-cost aspects of the choice system of educational reform 
have drawn support from conservatives and from parents frustrated with having 
little or no say over where their children go to school. Some liberals have 
also embraced it as an avenue for improving educational opportunities for 
children of the poor, who often are stuck at problem-riddled, inner-city 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Still others see choice as a means of improving parental involvement in their 
children's education. As parents become more knowledgeable about schools and 
begin choosing among them, schools will be forced to improve in order to 
compete for students, proponents of choice believe. 
</P>
<P>
The choice system is not admired by all, however, and debate over it continues 
up and down California, much as it does in the rest of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Critics such as Supt. Leonard Britton of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District suspect that it is a vehicle for parents to avoid integration or to 
abandon average or troubled schools, leaving the students who remain in even 
worse straits. 
</P>
<P>
Others, such as Wayne Johnson, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, the 
district's teachers union, question whether it can work in a system as vast as 
the 600,000-student, 708-square-mile Los Angeles system. The district must also 
grapple with overcrowding and desegregation problems, which could be aggravated 
if parents, who long have had some limited choices through the district's 
system of specialized magnet schools, are given free rein. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of kids realistically have no choice" if transportation and other 
problems inhibit their movement to other schools, said Johnson, who believes 
choice "is not a bad concept, but it won't resolve the basic problems in 
education." 
</P>
<P>
But state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig praises choice as a way of 
offering "black, Asian and Hispanic Californians an entirely new dimension in 
educational opportunity within our public school system."

OFFICIALS ARE WARNED OF OBSTETRICS CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA and LANIE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying that obstetric services at Los Angeles County hospitals are "critically 
overloaded," county health department chief Robert C. Gates told a state 
medical commission Tuesday that women in labor might be turned away from county 
hospitals unless an immediate solution to the overcrowding problem is found. 
</P>
<P>
"It's to the point now where we must seriously consider sending patients out to 
other (private) hospitals because the overload is so great," Gates said at a 
California Medical Assistance Commission hearing in Burbank. "Our system is 
well beyond capacity and something must be done right now." 
</P>
<P>
Gates' idea for turning away pregnant women followed a controversial plan 
instituted in June by UCI Medical Center in Orange, where conditions on the 
maternity ward have been described as not only overcrowded but also "unsafe." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, UCI Medical Center officials on June 5 began an "obstetrical 
diversion" program that is expected to continue indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever both the maternity ward and emergency room are full, hospital security 
guards wearing badges and blue blazers ask women in labor to go to a different 
hospital. However, those women are still admitted to UCI if they insist. 
</P>
<P>
Gates told the commission, which oversees the state's Medi-Cal contracting 
program, that he expects more than 46,000 babies to be delivered at Los Angeles 
County hospitals this year, severely overtaxing a system in which possibly 
35,000 babies "could be safely delivered." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center has a capacity for about 14,000 
deliveries, but officials expect almost 25,000 babies to be born there this 
year. Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, with a capacity of 6,000 deliveries, expects 
to handle 8,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we have patients (giving birth) in corridors," said Dr. Charles 
Brinkman, chair of the obstetrics and gynecology department at Harbor-UCLA 
Medical Center. "Some patients are sent home in 12 hours, some are sent home in 
two hours. It becomes really battlefront obstetrics we're practicing." 
</P>
<P>
Gates said that if the county is to remedy the situation, it must expand its 
contract agreements to hospitals that do not provide Medi-Cal coverage. 
Currently, private facilities with Medi-Cal coverage are able to accommodate 
only 9,000 referrals from the county, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said the commission could also help by easing Medi-Cal guidelines, which 
allow the county to send only low-risk patients to its contract facilities for 
obstetric care. And a number of hospital officials asked the panel to provide 
speedy reimbursements to obstetricians as an incentive to expand Medi-Cal 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County hospital officials, including UCI Medical Center's acting chief 
of obstetrics, Thomas J. Garite, have been making similar pleas to Medi-Cal 
officials for months. 
</P>
<P>
Since UCI's policy began, more than 20 "diversions" have been announced when 
the maternity ward has been full, including one that began shortly after noon 
Tuesday. About 40 women have elected to deliver at other hospitals since the 
policy was enacted, a medical center spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the policy, though, overcrowding has continued at the medical center. 
In a maternity ward designed to handle 250 births a month, UCI Medical Center 
counted 452 deliveries so far this month. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, however, stopped short of saying that Los Angeles County would copy UCI 
Medical Center's plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a problem with the concept (of security guards) and would only do it if 
there was no other alternative," Gates said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Both state and federal health officials have scrutinized UCI's diversion 
policy, but while some are unhappy with it, they have not declared it illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Before Garite and hospital director Mary Piccione enacted the "diversion" 
policy, deliveries in hospital corridors were a regular occurrence, and 
obstetricians complained there were not always enough oxygen tanks and fetal 
monitors for their patients. 
</P>
<P>
Garite also has asked Medi-Cal officials to consider special funding for a 
proposed UCI "birthing center" -- a center for low-risk births -- that would 
relieve crowding in the hospital's maternity ward. But Garite said earlier this 
week that it will take "a major change in their thinking" to change Medi-Cal 
rules and make such a center a break-even proposition. 
</P>
<P>
While Gates was making his comments before the state medical commission, the 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors adopted a motion directing him to 
develop a plan within two weeks to reduce the number of births at county 
hospitals. The current delivery rate "exposes patients to unsafe care and 
expands the county's potential for legal liability," supervisors said. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said that Los Angeles County's proposed "self-referral" plan would allow 
county health care workers to refer women in labor to other contract facilities 
"as long as it was safe for them to transport themselves."

DRY, GUSTING WINDS CREATE QUITE A STINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dry desert winds slashed through Orange County on Tuesday, uprooting trees, 
blowing down power lines and causing a 30-foot pile of manure to spontaneously 
ignite, prompting residents of an east Irvine housing development to briefly 
evacuate because of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The winds set off burglar alarms that were sensitive to movement, knocked out 
traffic signals and forced cancellation of a hilltop ceremony to mark the start 
of construction on a section of roadway linking Mission Viejo and Rancho Santa 
Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
Downed power lines blocked railroad tracks near San Juan Capistrano, delaying 
Amtrak trains passing through the county between San Diego and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In Riverside and San Bernardino counties, the winds were strong enough in 
places to tip over tractor-trailer trucks. Gusts up to 50 m.p.h. forced closure 
of Interstate 15 between Highland Avenue and Interstate 215 in Devore. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service reported that wind readings in Santa Ana topped 30 
m.p.h. twice Tuesday morning. But the winds were reported to be blowing even 
harder elsewhere in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station said winds up to 43 m.p.h. 
caused a "spontaneous combustion" fire amid huge piles of horse manure on a 
nearby fertilizer farm. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Maj. Jim McClain said the fire broke out about 3:15 a.m. near the base's 
riding stables at Irvine Boulevard and Lambert Road. 
</P>
<P>
The fire cast a pall of heavy smoke that blew directly into a housing 
development nearby. Some residents evacuated to the El Toro Marine School, he 
said, until the flames were extinguished about two hours later. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman said there were several piles of 
manure at the site, some 20 to 30 feet high. She said they are owned by the 
Wilbur-Ellis Co., which packages the manure as fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
The hot dry winds were also blamed for a roof fire that caused $50,000 damage 
to a house in Yorba Linda. Burning embers from the chimney, which lacked a 
spark-arresting screen, ignited the roof of the house in the 4500 block of 
Plumosa Drive, fire officials said. About 20 Orange County firefighters were 
sent to quell the blaze and protect other homes from the flying embers, fire 
spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
The winds caused widespread power outages, interrupting service to about 7,400 
Orange County customers of Southern California Edison Co. by mid-afternoon, 
said company spokesman Steve Nelson. They were among the approximately 40,000 
Edison customers experiencing power outages Tuesday throughout Southern 
California because of the wind. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, Nelson said, the outages were confined to neighborhoods or 
individuals rather than widespread areas of north and central Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
South County customers of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. also experienced 
sporadic outages, officials said. Several hundred lost power for two hours 
starting at 11:50 a.m. when winds blew down power lines in south San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
The lines landed across the Santa Fe Railroad tracks used by Amtrak. The tracks 
were blocked for about 40 minutes, setting back the trains' schedules by about 
30 minutes, a Santa Fe spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
In Mission Viejo, the planned ground-breaking ceremony for the start of the 
$15.5-million Oso Parkway extension was canceled because of the high winds. 
Plans had called for shuttling guests up to a hilltop vista to view the 
1.7-mile route. 
</P>
<P>
"The caterer suggested that there have been gusts up to 40 m.p.h. in the area," 
said one organizer. "You just got a lot of loose dirt in the area and it would 
have been difficult to have any formal ceremony under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach police officials said officers were busy answering 40 false 
burglar alarms set off by the winds overnight. In Anaheim, a police lieutenant 
said, "we got some signal lights out and stuff like that, but nothing major" in 
terms of damage. 
</P>
<P>
And in Tustin, a tree toppled at Red Hill and Edinger avenues, blocking a lane 
of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Contributing to this report were Times staff writers John Kendall and Jenifer 
Warren in Los Angeles and Wendy Paulson in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Winds 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana winds occur at all times of the year, but they are most frequent in 
the fall. This week the air has flowed from a high pressure area over southern 
Idaho and northern Utah toward a low pressure area off the Southern California 
coast. Since the air moving from the high pressure area is relatively cool, the 
Santa Ana winds have not brought particularly hot temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal Zone 
</P>
<P>
The coast is one of the warmest areas since the air is compressed down to sea 
level and it has the highest density and temperature. Smog and dust particles 
are blown out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
Effects Of The Wind 
</P>
<P>
The wind can cause widespread damage, including downed trees, power poles and 
the spreading of brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain Compression 
</P>
<P>
The air is compressed as it moves down through the mountains surrounding the 
Los Angeles Basin toward sea level. As the density of the air increases, its 
temperature goes up and its humidity goes down. This helps create the hot dry 
conditions of the Santa Anas. 
</P>
<P>
High Pressure Area 
</P>
<P>
Air moving in a clockwise motion over Idaho/Utah is drawn toward a low pressure 
area off the Southern California coast. 
</P>
<P>
Dry Desert Air 
</P>
<P>
The dry desert air removes much of the moisture as the air flows from the high 
pressure area to the low pressure area. 
</P>
<P>
Heating Of The Air 
</P>
<P>
As a general guide, air warms about 5.5 degrees F for every 1,000 feet it 
drops. As the air moves from the Great Basin region -- elevation about 4,500 
feet -- toward the coast, the air will heat up by at least 25 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons And Passes 
</P>
<P>
The canyons and passes surrounding the Los Angeles basin are well suited for 
increasing the speed of the Santa Ana winds. The Santa Anas tend to be from the 
north-northeast and the canyons are mainly oriented in the same direction. As 
the air enters the canyons, it is squeezed much as a stream whose banks have 
narrowed.. As the winds are funneled they accelerate, often causing 2 to 3 
times the wind speed in the canyons than in the basin.

DIANNE KLEIN: DREAM HOUSE FOR SALE BUT TAB COULD KEEP YOU AWAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dianne Klein

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We are sitting in the park, the very private park of Michael and Pat DeAngelo 
in the Tustin Hills, and the video camera of "The Lifestyles of the Rich and 
Famous" is rolling. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Nelson, real estate agent to the rich and famous, is sitting on a bench 
with his back to the 36,000-square-foot DeAngelo manse. There's a slight 
breeze, just enough to make the palm fronds shimmer a little, and Bruce is 
talking about the difference between a major and a minor estate. 
</P>
<P>
The DeAngelos, he says, have an absolutely major estate, which is why, of 
course, we are all here. 
</P>
<P>
Then the inimitable roar of a leaf blower wafts up the mountain from a rather 
boxy looking house below. Conversation stops. People are annoyed. The moment is 
broken. Cut! 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Jason," the cameraman asks the 12-year-old son of Michael and Pat. "You 
have one of those high-powered pellet guns?" 
</P>
<P>
"No," Jason says, "but my brother does." 
</P>
<P>
Jason and his two brothers, Mike, 15, and Augie, 19, are making it their 
business to be helpful to the crew of "The Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous." 
For kids who have everything, TV is still a big deal. Mike and Jason have 
stayed home from school so as not to miss anything. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Robin Leach, who will do a voice-over on the segment, will oooh and ahh 
over one of their bedrooms -- the house has 10 -- or maybe the projection room, 
the disco, the gym, the tanning room, the video arcade, the wine cellar, the 
library, the his-and-her beauty salons, the television room or the two-story 
master bedroom suite. 
</P>
<P>
One could go on, and on. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have 18 bathrooms," Pat tells me as she gives me a tour, during 
which we almost get lost. 
</P>
<P>
"You think?" I say. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I'm not sure. I haven't counted them. Maybe I should send the kids 
around to count the bathrooms and the TVs." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt the "Lifestyles" crew will figure this out. This is their business, 
after all, although even they were a bit astounded by this whitewashed and 
sun-kissed Mediterranean palace on 26 hilltop acres. 
</P>
<P>
"Fabulous," a producer has scrawled on the crew's assignment sheet. "Better 
than we've ever done before!" 
</P>
<P>
Moments earlier, Jason had offered to show the crew around the grounds, in his 
own golf cart. The guys loved this. In a golf cart. Great kid you've got here, 
ma'am. 
</P>
<P>
But there may have been another reason for the offer. The fellows were more 
than an hour late, having lost their bearings once they ventured outside the 
Platinum Triangle. They ended up in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The Platinum Triangle," Bruce explains, "is a term I coined two years ago and 
now everybody's using it." 
</P>
<P>
For those of you who don't know, Bruce says the triangle runs from Holmby 
Hills, which is where Bruce lives and where most of the money is, to Bel-Air, 
which ranks second, to Beverly Hills, in third. 
</P>
<P>
"So where do you put this?" I ask as we stroll past the waterfall just outside 
the DeAngelos' massive front door. 
</P>
<P>
"This," Bruce says, "is in a world of its own. This is the greatest estate in 
Orange County!" 
</P>
<P>
"Any offers yet?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
"Uh, no," he says, "No offers yet, but I can tell you right now that in six 
months it will be sold." 
</P>
<P>
For those of you who are asking, you know what that means. . . . 
</P>
<P>
That's right. You cannot afford it. 
</P>
<P>
If the DeAngelos get their asking price of $22 million, this will be the most 
expensive estate, major or minor, ever sold in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
(There is, however, another house in South Laguna vying for the same honor as 
well as one in Newport recently reduced from the same sum. "I priced this at 
$22 million, so, of course, they had to put theirs at 22," Bruce says.) 
</P>
<P>
Now Bruce makes a little joke. Say you come in with 10% down, that would make 
your payments about $160,000 to $170,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"No, seriously," he goes on. 
</P>
<P>
"This property is for the super rich. They fall in love with it. They write a 
check and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
Which, of course, is what happened with the DeAngelos, he of ClothesTime Inc., 
and she, of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Pat tells me that before the house, the six of them -- daughter Gina lived at 
home then -- were ensconced in a 5,000-square-foot home in Anaheim's Peralta 
Hills for 10 years. Can you imagine? 
</P>
<P>
But that was three years ago, before Michael and Pat walked through the door 
and decided they had to have this. Not that it looked like this back then. 
</P>
<P>
The DeAngelos just finished the interior renovations -- white walls, white 
furniture, gigantic aquariums, Mexican pavers, marble, tile, rock, and flow, 
darling, fabulous flow. 
</P>
<P>
Now they're mapping out plans for the yard, er park, including a lake and 
helipad. 
</P>
<P>
This has involved great sums of money. 
</P>
<P>
"Millions?" I ask Pat, rather crudely. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah," she says. "We've spent that much on the palm trees alone." 
</P>
<P>
We are sitting in the kitchen when Pat is telling me this. She has just pointed 
out the retractable skylight and a built-in surveillance monitor that flashes 
scenes of real life in the house and on the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
This, she explains, is great for keeping in touch. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the kids running in the halls and then I pick up the phone and say, 'No 
running in the halls!' " Pat says. 
</P>
<P>
Just then, the phone rings. It is Michael, upstairs. He's a little hungry. Pat 
puts down the phone and asks her mother, Jean Hobbs, if she'd mind running to 
the grocery store for some goodies. 
</P>
<P>
No, she doesn't mind. Keeps her busy. Jean explains that that's why she leaves 
her home in Orange to be here by 7 a.m. most every day. She takes her 
grandchildren to the orthodontist, does the laundry, the shopping and the 
cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
"I walk around with a spray bottle of green cleaner at my waist," she says. 
"Jason likes to kick his soccer ball in the halls and it leaves black marks . . 
. I hope they don't move to the beach because then I wouldn't have anything to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, yes, about this moving business. Despite the improvements they've made, Pat 
explains that maybe the family would like something a little closer to the 
beach, maybe something a tad smaller, say, in the 15,000 square feet range. 
</P>
<P>
But that's only if they find something they love, which, so far, they haven't. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, this place seems, what's the right word? Incomparable.

COMPUTER SYSTEM TO MONITOR SEWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The city is paying a consultant $70,000 to develop a computer system to monitor 
the sewer network in central Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
CH2M Hill California Inc., an engineering firm, will create a system in which 
sewer flow is monitored through some of the area's 2,700 manholes and other 
points of entry into the sewage system, according to city documents. 
</P>
<P>
The information will be used to help city planners determine how much 
development the area can sustain, as well as when and where the sewer system 
needs to be expanded. MARY LOU FULTON

STUDENTS 'ADOPT' ENDANGERED PLANTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
At Pegasus Elementary School, 10-year-old Chris Rakunas said he worries about 
where food will come from if certain animals cease to exist. Nine-year-old 
Nathania Chen worries about the vanishing ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
As a part of their lessons on endangered species and science, the fourth- and 
fifth-grade students took nature into their own hands by adopting endangered 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
"I really have a new respect for the plant since we've begun learning about 
them," Rakunas said. "It is so important that we work hard to keep all the 
things around us alive." 
</P>
<P>
The school, which is designed for gifted children in kindergarten through fifth 
grades, is working with the Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden. Through its Adopt 
an Endangered Plant Program, the center is fervently trying to save endangered 
plants found only in California. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we are concentrating particularly on types of plants that are 
common to this area," said Rebecca Caughman, spokeswoman for the garden. "There 
are various plants around that there are no more than a handful remaining." 
</P>
<P>
The garden introduced the adoption program last month at its annual native 
plant sale. Buyers of native plants each received a personalized certificate of 
adoption along with a plant care guide. 
</P>
<P>
Pegasus science teacher Adrianne White, who heard about the sale, was certain 
it would be perfect for her class. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we've concentrated a great deal on endangered species, I knew this 
adoption program would work very well with what they were learning, 
particularly since this is a life form that gets very little attention," White 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The children planted three species in the back of the schoolyard and will take 
turns monitoring them. 
</P>
<P>
"What we try to do here is incorporate science as part of their lives, said 
Laura Katz Hathaway, school director. "These children really do worry about 
what they see and read and are sometimes afraid for their surroundings and 
what's happening to them." ALLISON SAMUELS

<P>
RESIDENTS PLAGUED BY POWER FAILURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A four-day series of power failures affecting more than 4,000 area households 
continued early Tuesday with a six-hour outage caused by faulty cables in one 
of the city's main electrical circuits, a power company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
An outage from 2:30 to 8:30 a.m. Tuesday was not related to strong winds that 
hit the county and blew down overhead power lines Tuesday afternoon in San Juan 
Capistrano, said Fred Vaughn, spokesman for San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
The morning incident was caused by ongoing cable failures that also triggered 
outages Sunday and Monday, Vaughn said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m., 2,400 customers in south and central San Juan 
Capistrano lost power because of a combination of a cable failure and a bird 
flying into a power line. An electrical short in the same circuit at 7:30 p.m. 
Sunday left some homes without power until 11 a.m. Monday, Vaughn said. 
</P>
<P>
A Saturday power failure from 8:30 to 11 a.m., affecting 1,800 homes in east 
San Juan Capistrano, was caused by a bird tangled in a wire, Vaughn said.

COUNTY AGENCIES GET $500,000 IN GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County should be smiling pretty by now. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen thousand toothbrushes and 6,000 spools of floss were among the nearly 
$500,000 in gifts, services and cash donated to county agencies this year, 
according to a report from the county auditor presented Tuesday to the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more unusual gifts were $2,000 worth of Captain EO T-shirts and 
toddler toys from Disneyland, $1,330 in free tickets for the opera in 
Fullerton, five truckloads of dirt and $1,733 worth of men's and women's 
personal hygiene kits from the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Social Services Agency collected the most in cash, gifts and 
services with a total of $175,744. The big winners within that agency were the 
county's annual Operation Santa Claus and the Orangewood Children's Center, 
both of which serve disadvantaged or abused children. 
</P>
<P>
Fire departments in the county donated 239 bikes to Operation Santa Claus; 
about half of the remaining donations to social services were contributions of 
less than $100 from private individuals. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department collected the second most among county agencies. Cash 
and other contributions to the department totaled $154,293. Most of that came 
from local construction firms that donated time and supplies to help build 
Laser Village, a state-of-the-art shooting range that uses lasers to train law 
enforcers. The Sheriff's Advisory Council also donated $20,000 worth of pistols 
and vests for the shooting range. 
</P>
<P>
The report does not include political donations to the supervisors, who submit 
separate reports to a state political watchdog agency.

ANIMAL SLAUGHTER IN PUBLIC PROHIBITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An ordinance that prohibits the slaughtering of animals in public was adopted 
by the City Council unanimously Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was introduced in response to a citizen's complaint about a 
neighbor seen killing a duck in view of several children during the summer, 
said Councilman Frank Fry Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which goes into effect in 30 days, is intended to prevent, for 
example, the slaughtering of poultry where the public might see it. 
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't make it illegal to kill a chicken," said Councilwoman Anita 
Huseth. "It just means you have to kill it in your garage instead of your back 
yard." The rule exempts commercial slaughtering buildings or buildings with 
interiors not visible to the public.

GALA CHRISTMAS WALK TO BE HELD SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 13th annual Christmas Walk will be Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. along 
Pacific Coast Highway and side streets. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Corona del Mar Chamber of Commerce on the first Sunday of each 
December, the free walk goes from Acacia Street to Poppy Street. 
</P>
<P>
"The Christmas Walk is our gift to the community," said Chamber administrator 
Ellen Buck. "This is not something done for a profit." 
</P>
<P>
Last year about 5,000 residents and visitors, many bedecked in Christmas 
finery, strolled through the shops and streets of downtown. This year's turnout 
is expected to be larger, Buck said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 entertainers will perform throughout the day, including 10 
multicultural dance groups, four Big Bands, a jazz quartet, Coventry Carolers, 
strolling musicians, mimes and a gospel choir. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment for children will include a magic show with Gum Drop the clown, a 
puppet show at the Corona del Mar library, an Orange County Philharmonic Music 
Mobil, a Be a Clown makeup table manned by Newport Theatre Arts Center 
volunteers, a marionette show and pictures with Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants will host free open houses and serve champagne, wine, cookies and 
other refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
"Stores and restaurants serve things like Chinese chicken salad, hot buttered 
rum and Indian food," Buck said. "There's a lot of food." 
</P>
<P>
At 4 p.m., drawings will be held for about 150 prizes, including a $1,000 
shopping spree at Lorraine's Boutique. 
</P>
<P>
Toys for Tots barrels will be manned by Marines and spotted throughout the 
walk. New toys should be wrapped for distribution later to underprivileged 
children. The packages should have labels telling the type of toy and whether 
it is for a boy or a girl. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas Walk headquarters will be outside the Studio Cafe at Marguerite 
Avenue. For more information, call (714) 673-4050. LESLIE HERZOG

A REAL FIND: ATLANTIS FOR KIDS ONLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES TORTOLANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this New Age era of channeling, spirit guides and harmonic convergences, not 
a few people have hunted for the fabled Lost City of Atlantis which, according 
to legend, sank beneath the waves thousands of years ago, drowning an advanced 
civilization. 
</P>
<P>
Not quite lost, but certainly tucked away, is a local version of Atlantis. It 
is populated not by geniuses and philosophers but by suburban boys and girls, 
and you don't need to experience a past-life regression to find it. 
</P>
<P>
Just go to Atlantis Play Center, at 9201 Westminster Ave., next to Garden Grove 
Park, between Brookhurst and Magnolia streets. There the city has built an 
unusual park with a watery theme, exclusively for kids. 
</P>
<P>
"The play equipment is unique," says Roxanne Kaufman, community services 
supervisor who oversees the park. "Since the theme is Lost City of Atlantis, we 
have equipment that you won't find anywhere else -- it was designed especially 
for the park." 
</P>
<P>
On the four acres of Atlantis, the young visitor can slide on dragons or 
whales, teeter-totter on a sea horse or sail a Viking ship. 
</P>
<P>
"No adults are allowed into Atlantis unless accompanied by a child," Kaufman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Moon, 36, of Garden Grove, who brought daughter Erin to Atlantis for a 
fourth birthday party, said: "I like the idea of the park being enclosed. Not 
having to worry about her getting lost or worse means a lot to a mother." 
</P>
<P>
All these submarine names and notions began in the late 1960s -- a time, 
Kaufman acknowledges, when "budgets were a little plumper. The parks department 
wanted to try something a little different," and Atlantis opened in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 77,000 children and parents visit annually. The center is open 11 
a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturdays, noon to 4 
p.m. Sundays. It is closed on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Although it has a number of pint-size alumni, many residents are not aware it 
even exists because its entrance is at the end of long Atlantis Way, several 
hundred yards from busy Westminster Avenue. JAMES TORTOLANO

<P>
What could be the final step before beginning construction on the second phase 
of the Greenbrier Plaza development has been taken by the Garden Grove City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members, acting as the Agency for Community Development, voted 4 
to 1 Monday night that the proposed commercial-industrial project was 
"consistent with the goals and objectives of the city's redevelopment plan." 
</P>
<P>
The project, at the former site of the Greenbrier Inn, one of Garden Grove's 
early hotels, is on a 6.1-acre parcel on Garden Grove Boulevard between 
Brookhurst and Nutwood streets. 
</P>
<P>
Pelican Properties of Newport Beach first announced plans to redevelop the 
location in the late 1970s, but the shape of proposed projects has changed from 
its original plan, which included an enclosed shopping mall with a skating rink 
and adjacent hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's action by the council approved a phase that will include a pair of 
two-story office/commercial buildings fronting on Garden Grove Boulevard, and 
two one-story service-industrial buildings toward the rear of the project.

HOT LINE IS ABUZZ WITH MEDFLY CALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Tuesday was the busiest day yet for the Orange County Medfly Hot Line, as calls 
poured in from residents seeking information in advance of the county's 
first-ever malathion spraying for the destructive Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had calls from as far south as Laguna Niguel," said Theresa Knitter, an 
agricultural technician for the county's Department of Agriculture, Weights and 
Measures who has been working since Nov. 20 as a hot-line operator in 
preparation for the spraying planned for Thursday night. Early questions 
indicated that "the people were more on edge. . . . Now we're getting people 
who are just more concerned about how to protect their immediate self." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Los Angeles County, a fertile fly was reported Tuesday to have 
been detected in Downey, expanding an already large swath of residential 
neighborhoods in Los Angeles County and Northern Orange County that are 
targeted for at least one dose of aerial pesticide spray. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fertility Confirmed 
</P>
<P>
The fly was found late Monday and flown to Sacramento where its fertility was 
confirmed. The Downey find and a fly found last week in Brea have further 
complicated eradication efforts, stretching resources to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, hot-line operators have listened to worries, calmed fears and 
corrected faulty information from inside the agriculture department's building 
in Anaheim, as county residents prepare for Thursday's scheduled 9 p.m. 
spraying over parts of Brea, Fullerton and La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, are the birds under cover?" Howard L. Garrett, usually a deputy 
agricultural commissioner and now a hot-line operator, asked a Tuesday 
afternoon caller who said she lived in the treatment area. "If there's a roof 
(on the outdoor cage), they should be all right. It probably wouldn't hurt to 
put something around the edge." 
</P>
<P>
From another of the five telephones on Tuesday, Knitter was assuring a woman 
that although she lived in the northern part of the county, she was not in the 
treatment area or the surrounding quarantine area, and so would not be affected 
by the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"No, you're not in the spray zone," Knitter told the caller. "You'll hear the 
helicopters -- you might have them come over your house -- but they're not 
actually spraying." 
</P>
<P>
Knitter said that last week there were about 70 to 80 callers a day, but this 
week the number of calls has increased, with a high on Tuesday of more than 100 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
She said that last week, callers seemed seemed more concerned about potential 
adverse effects that the spray could have on the environment and wildlife, 
rather than individual household concerns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pet Inquiries 
</P>
<P>
Now, people are calling with particular questions about a pet, plant or health 
condition, and most of the calls Tuesday were about exactly when and where the 
spraying would occur, she said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, another hot line was set up at the field nurse office of the county 
Health Care Agency, where Supervising Public Health Nurse Carol Mosely said she 
received about 10 calls on Tuesday and about five on Monday, mostly inquiries 
about pets. 
</P>
<P>
Mosely said that a few people with respiratory illnesses called with concerns 
about the effect the spray would have on them. 
</P>
<P>
Mosely operates the hot line from 7 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., and on Thursday, she 
plans to answer phones until 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The other hot line will be operating from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. today through 
Thursday, and until 2 a.m. Friday, when the spraying is expected to be 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, agricultural officials prepared Tuesday for the second 
application of malathion over a 23-square-mile area of the San Gabriel Valley 
encompassing San Marino, Rosemead, El Monte and parts of Monterey Park. The 
planned 9 p.m. liftoff could be delayed or canceled if strong Santa Ana winds 
kick up, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The recent Santa Ana winds also could be contributing to the spread of the 
Medfly problems, said Roy Cunningham, an entomologist and leading member of the 
state's scientific advisory panel on the Medfly. He has conducted studies in 
Hawaii that show that the quarter-inch-long fly has been carried up to eight 
miles by island trade winds. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping these winds settle down," Cunningham said. "This fly is a weak 
flier. But in an open stretch it can be carried for miles." 
</P>
<P>
The Downey discovery represents the "last straw" in the state's ability to 
fight the Medfly by releasing sterile flies to breed the population out of 
existence, Cunningham said. Even the billions of sterile flies being purchased 
from Mexico will not be enough to cover the Downey infestation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This definitely means we have exceeded our capacity to . . . flood all areas 
with sterile flies," Cunningham said. "There is a limit to what we can handle." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Richard Simon and Stephanie Chavez contributed to this 
story. 
</P>
<P>
THURSDAY'S MEDFLY SPRAY AREA 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture officials have advised residents in parts of Brea, Fullerton and La 
Habra to take precautions before aerial pesticide spraying Thursday night to 
eradicate a Mediterranean fruit fly infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended steps include: 
</P>
<P>
Stay indoors if possible. Officials say the amount of pesticide used in the 
spray is small enough that contact with it will not cause any long-term health 
effects. It can be an irritant to eyes, but no other short-term effects are 
likely to result. The semisweet mixture of malathion and corn syrup is released 
in droplets too large to inhale. It has toxicity equivalent to laundry 
detergent, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Cover cars that are parked outside. The malathion mixture may cause blemishes 
or discoloration to the finish or paint of some cars. 
</P>
<P>
Keep dogs, cats and other pets in garages or under cover. 
</P>
<P>
Shallow back-yard fish ponds should be covered. But officials say pool owners 
should not worry because the pesticide will not significantly affect the water 
quality in a standard-size pool. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, all patio furniture, play equipment, tools and household 
items left outdoors during the spray should be hosed down.

A postal worker was killed Tuesday when his motorcycle crashed on a street 
here, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Wayne Hill, 32, of Santa Ana apparently lost control of the motorcycle 
about 7:15 a.m. as he rode west in the 3400 block of West MacArthur Boulevard, 
police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that Hill appeared to be riding faster than the speed 
limit when his motorcycle jumped the curb, clipped a utility pole and crashed 
into a mailbox. Thomas said the man was believed to have been riding to work at 
a post office in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he wore a helmet, Hill sustained major head injuries and was dead 
on arrival at a Fountain Valley hospital, she said.

JURORS RECOMMEND DEATH PENALTY FOR MAN WHO GUNNED DOWN CHURCH ELDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court jury on Tuesday recommended that a reputed gang member with a 
long criminal record die in the gas chamber for killing a Santa Ana church 
elder during a spree of shootings and robberies. 
</P>
<P>
After three days of deliberation, the jury rejected Tracy Lavelle Carter's 
pronouncements of innocence from the witness stand and decided that he should 
be put to death in the slaying of David Eugene Thompson, an elder of the Zion 
Apostolic Church in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The jury of seven women and five men further recommended that Carter, 21, who 
is a member of the 74 Hoover Crips street gang, receive life in prison without 
possibility of parole for killing Leopoldo Salgado. 
</P>
<P>
Salgado, 48, of Los Angeles, and Thompson, 27, of Tustin, were robbed and shot 
within 90 minutes of each other in South-Central Los Angeles on April 9, 1987, 
during an attempt by Carter and two other young men to obtain money for beer 
and cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who has two children, was killed in a telephone booth while his hands 
were pressed together in prayer and his wife looked on from a few feet away. 
"Hallelujah, hallelujah," he said before he was shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied with what the jury has concluded," said Thompson's widow, 
Namora. "It didn't surprise me at all. It's like a relief to me. Now, it is 
over with." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors made their decision after reviewing evidence and hearing arguments from 
the prosecution and the defense about whether Carter should get the gas chamber 
for two first-degree murder convictions returned Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Anne Ingalls argued that Carter should get the death penalty 
because of the serious nature of the offenses, his previous criminal history 
and his conduct in jail while awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that Carter has been in continuous trouble with the law since he was 
11 years old when he was first convicted of robbery and malicious mischief. 
Except for 14 months of freedom, Carter has been serving time in Los Angeles 
County Jail and the California Youth Authority for the last seven years, 
Ingalls said. 
</P>
<P>
When Thompson and Salgado were gunned down, Carter was on probation for a 
cocaine possession conviction. He had been released from jail only 1 1/2 months 
earlier. While in jail on the current murder charges, Ingalls said, Carter was 
accused of trying to stab to death two inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a fabulous verdict and a just verdict," Ingalls said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Anthony Alexander contended that Carter did not deserve to die 
and reiterated his position that his client did not commit the crimes. He could 
not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Carter testified that he was present when Thompson and Salgado were shot but 
did not participate in the crimes. His family members told the jury that they 
thought the defendant was a good person and that they still loved him. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Jean Matusinka is scheduled to impose Carter's sentence on 
Jan. 12. Although she must consider the jury's recommendation for death, 
Matusinka can reject the penalty if she believes that it is not just. 
</P>
<P>
Ingalls said the jury probably gave Carter the death penalty for "the 
cold-blooded way" he killed Thompson. "He looked him right in the eye as he 
prayed and pulled the trigger," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson was killed in a gas station telephone booth at Slauson Avenue and 
Broadway, where he had gone for help after a bus from his church broke down 
during an outing. As his wife, Namora, waited in their car, three men accosted 
them and took $10 from her purse. Then Carter shot Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the men took Thompson's 1986 Hyundai and drove to a liquor store 
where they bought cigarettes and beer. Ingalls showed that they returned to the 
store later and shot Salgado when he and a friend refused to give them money. 
</P>
<P>
Carter is the last of three people to be convicted in the slayings. Earlier 
this year, an accomplice, Andre Moore, 19, was sentenced to 32 years to life in 
prison. Todd Lavera, 25, received 58 years to life in prison for his role in 
the crimes.

REAGAN MAKES A WISH COME TRUE; 
</P>
<P>
CANCER: LA HABRA GIRL GETS HER CHANCE TO CHAT WITH THE FORMER PRESIDENT AS PART 
OF A PROGRAM TO HELP ILL CHILDREN.

Eight-year-old Laurel Eernisse walked out of Ronald Reagan's Century City 
office Tuesday beaming. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't mind if he was my grandpa," she said, elated after exchanging 
stories, questions and jelly beans with the former President. 
</P>
<P>
For Laurel, who has leukemia that is now in remission, the visit with Reagan 
was a wish fulfilled. The Orange County chapter of the Make-A-Wish Foundation 
had offered to grant the La Habra girl a wish a few weeks ago, and Laurel, who 
watches the evening news almost every night, chose to meet Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation, which fulfills the wishes of children who have terminal or 
life-threatening illnesses, selected Laurel on the recommendation of her 
physician and a social worker. Her cancer was discovered in March, but after 
about four weeks of treatment, doctors found that her disease had gone in 
remission. Her parents, Karin and David, said her prognosis is excellent. 
</P>
<P>
Laurel had a list of questions on her mind to ask Reagan, who told her he was 
proud to be the object of her wish. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a violet shirt and white blouse, Laurel sat face-to-face with Reagan 
and rattled off several inquiries, one of which was what were the best and 
worst parts of being President. 
</P>
<P>
"You had so many opportunities to help people," Reagan said as he sat next to 
her on an armchair. "You have the ability to marshal forces if help is 
required." 
</P>
<P>
The worst, he said, were in the times of tragedy "when you had to report to 
families that some member of their families wouldn't be coming home." 
</P>
<P>
Then Reagan had a question for her. What did she want to be when she grew up? 
</P>
<P>
She told Reagan that she wanted to be a veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
"My golly," Reagan said. "One day maybe I can get you to come and help my 
horse." 
</P>
<P>
For Laurel, the visit, albeit short, turned out to be what she wanted. She 
described Reagan just as she had pictured him before the visit. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very, very nice," she said. "Nicest man I ever met."

MIKE PENNER: FREEDOM'S TRAIL FORCED TO FOLLOW LOW ROAD

<P>
From Heisman to the Heistmen. 
</P>
<P>
Those Boilermakers pack quite a kick, don't they? One fourth-quarter field goal 
by Purdue on Saturday and the Freedom Bowl is waylaid, losing Anthony Thompson 
one second and replacing him the next with Team Renegade, the Florida Gators. 
</P>
<P>
Or, what's left of them. 
</P>
<P>
Florida is playing out the season with an interim coach. The incumbent, Galen 
Hall, was forced to resign on Oct. 8 amid charges that he made illegal payments 
to a player and two assistant coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Florida is also playing out the season with an interim quarterback. The 
starter, Kyle Morris, was dealt a year's suspension for betting on college 
football games. 
</P>
<P>
And now, Florida is playing out the season as the Freedom Bowl's interim 
opponent for Washington. Indiana was Anaheim's team of choice until Saturday, 
when the Hoosiers were forced to resign. A 15-14 upset loss to 3-8 Purdue did 
them in, leaving Indiana with a 5-6 record and ineligible for bowl 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Florida has a winning record. It also has a reputation. The football program is 
under NCAA investigation, but in the Freedom Bowl, the Gators have found 
sanctuary -- one last fling before the first sanctions fall. 
</P>
<P>
"They aren't under NCAA sanctions right now," says Freedom Bowl executive 
director Tom Starr, looking on the bright side. "That certainly doesn't bother 
us. I guess you're innocent until proven guilty, right?" 
</P>
<P>
Starr scans this year's bowl-bound map and finds Florida keeping, well, 
high-profile company. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look across the country, you see so many allegations," Starr notes. 
"There are allegations at Nebraska, at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't know what are causing those allegations, disgruntled players or 
what. Again, until you're proven guilty . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Feel for Starr. It has to be tough directing a bowl game on the backpedal. 
</P>
<P>
And before Saturday, it seemed all so easy. All Starr needed was one Indiana 
victory over a ninth-place Purdue team -- the Hoosiers were 16 1/2-point 
favorites, which Kyle Morris probably knew -- and Heisman Trophy front-runner 
Thompson was coming to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Starr and other Freedom Bowl representatives flew to Indiana, primed for a 
night of toasts and handshakes. Hello Anthony, hello sold-out Anaheim Stadium. 
The whole gang was going to celebrate later that night at the Indiana-Miami 
(Ohio) basketball game, court-side with Bobby Knight. 
</P>
<P>
Starr still has his ticket. Unused. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in the bowl business 10 years and I usually have premonitions about 
these things," Starr said. "But, to be honest, I was caught off guard. I 
thought Indiana was pretty safe." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Hoosiers are out and Thompson's Heisman hopes have been damaged, 
perhaps terminally. Purdue held Thompson, the nation's leading rusher and 
scorer, to 97 net yards and kept him out of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Houston quarterback Andre Ware has moved ahead of Thompson in most 
informal Heisman polls. 
</P>
<P>
It was a lost afternoon for everyone who had the most to gain. 
</P>
<P>
For Thompson, it was a big disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
For the Freedom Bowl, however, it is simply a way of life. From Game I, when 
the teams from Texas and Iowa nearly drowned in a December downpour, a hard 
rain has been falling on Starr and associates. 
</P>
<P>
That year, the deluge ensured a meager turnout of 24,093. 
</P>
<P>
The next, a top-10 Air Force team led on Starr for weeks and then abruptly 
committed to the Bluebonnet Bowl, forcing an 11th-hour scramble that left 
Freedom II with some 7-4 leftovers from Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
And this year, three of the four California Pac-10 teams -- UCLA, Stanford and 
Cal -- did nose dives and the fourth, USC, qualified for the Rose Bowl. Like 
that, the Freedom Bowl was shut out of a local draw. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, it turns to Indiana to save Dec. 30 -- and Anthony Thompson turns 
it over. 
</P>
<P>
Bring on the backup. Hail Florida. And hope the NCAA gets through December 
without deciding to jail Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"Florida will be on national TV this weekend against Florida State," Starr 
says. "Hopefully, people will look at the quality of the team Florida has and 
the kind of quality back Emmitt Smith is." 
</P>
<P>
And look the other way on the other stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, that could be part of Freedom Bowl VI's ticket drive. Catch The 
Gators While You Can. You never know when Florida might be allowed to play in 
one of these things again.

MONTANA CONTINUES TO FRUSTRATE ROBINSON

Oh well, it certainly wasn't the first time Joe Montana had messed up John 
Robinson's plans. And at least this time the Ram coach didn't have to watch 
from the sidelines. He could grimace in the privacy of his living room. Even 
cry into a sofa pillow if he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco quarterback threw three touchdown passes in the first half 
Monday night against New York and then squelched a late Giant rally in typical, 
"I-own-the-last-few-minutes-of-the-game" form. Montana passed. Montana ran. And 
the 49ers scored twice in the last four minutes 12 seconds, winning, 34-24. 
</P>
<P>
How many times has this guy ruined Robinson's plans in recent years? Too many 
to contemplate. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was hoping for some help from the Giants. Now, his hopes are resting 
on the Atlanta Falcons, who play host to the 49ers Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm praying for is for the 49ers to go into one of those periods where 
the balls just tick off their fingers and they're not quite running on all 
cylinders," Robinson said. "If they're into a flat period, that's what we need. 
</P>
<P>
"We need them to lose and us to keep winning, and then if we beat them, we can 
win the division championship." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams trail the 49ers by two games in the NFC West. If they can close the 
gap to one by Dec. 11, when the 49ers come to Anaheim Stadium for a Monday 
night game, a victory would give the Rams a 2-0 record against San Francisco 
and the edge toward the division title. 
</P>
<P>
"It would really add to that game," Robinson said. "It could turn that game 
into one of the big games of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta, of course, is 3-9 and with a new coach -- Jim Hanifan was named 
Tuesday as interim coach to replace Marion Campbell -- but the Rams can still 
dream about a division championship. Heck, Robinson has even allowed himself to 
mention the words "world championship." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the time of year when there are lots of reasons to step aside and let 
someone else fight for the world championship," he said. "We're in that hunt 
now." 
</P>
<P>
This is also the time of year when everyone has a different scenario about who 
will make the playoffs and why. Mathematically, the possibilities abound, but 
here's some of the things to consider when assessing the NFC wild-card race: 
</P>
<P>
 -- At this point, the Rams and Philadelphia (both 8-4) seem favorites for 
wild-card spots, but Green Bay (7-5) finishes the season against four teams -- 
Tampa Bay, Kansas City, Chicago and Dallas -- that are a combined 12-30. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Rams would rather see Minnesota (7-5) win the Central Division than 
Green Bay. If the Rams end the season with the same record as the Packers, they 
would get the wild-card spot because they beat the Packers, 41-38, Sept. 24. If 
Minnesota finishes second in the division and tied with the Rams, the Vikings 
get the spot based on their 23-21 overtime victory Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Vikings (7-5) play three of their last four games at home under the 
dome, where they are 5-0 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- New Orleans, Chicago and Washington (all 6-6) will need some help, but 
their playoff hopes are still alive. The Redskins play three of their four 
remaining games on the road, but still seem to have the best chance at winning 
four in a row, which is a must for these three. 
</P>
<P>
Washington finishes with Phoenix (5-7), San Diego (4-8), Atlanta (3-9) and 
Seattle (4-8). 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans plays at Detroit (3-9) and Buffalo (8-4), then gets the Eagles and 
Indianapolis (6-6) at home. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago has the toughest schedule. The Bears play at Minnesota, will host 
Detroit and Green Bay, then end the year at San Francisco (10-2). 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Rams play at Dallas (1-11) Sunday, the New York Jets (3-9) come to 
Anaheim after the 49ers, and the Rams end the season Christmas Eve in Foxboro, 
Mass., against the Patriots (4-8). 
</P>
<P>
The Rams could win three of their last four and still fall short of the 
playoffs, however. If they finish in a three-way tie at 11-5 with Philadelphia 
and Green Bay, the Packers would get the first wild-card spot based on best 
conference record and the Eagles would get the second because of a better 
record against common opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Everett passed for 454 yards Sunday against New Orleans. He dropped back to 
pass 57 times. The Rams even called a pass play on third down from the one-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't Robinson always criticized for his conservatism? Didn't the Rams used to 
run the ball, and run the ball, and run the ball some more until they finally 
ran opponents down? Does this recent dependence on the pass worry Robinson? 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe a little. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned about it," he admitted. "We're not concerned about numbers, as 
much as we are concerned about our will to run the football. When you're behind 
most of the game, like we were Sunday, clearly, throwing is the right thing to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"But you go along for awhile, if you don't run the football, and pretty soon 
you look up in a month when you have to run the ball and say, 'What happened to 
this team?' We're fighting the tendency to let that happen to us." 
</P>
<P>
Flipper Anderson was all over the field Sunday during his 336-yard, 
record-setting performance against New Orleans. Robinson thinks Anderson did 
more than just open some eyes. He says he opened a can of worms for Ram 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"We can become less predictable," Robinson said Monday at his weekly media 
luncheon. "You guys see us all the time, and you can say, 'They're going to 
throw underneath to (Pete) Holohan. They're going to throw into the flat to 
(Bobby) Delpino. They're going to run crossing routes to Henry (Ellard), who 
will work the middle of the field, and deep (patterns) to Flipper.' 
</P>
<P>
"And you want to get to a point where there's some things you do really well. 
But now this opens things up. Opponents can't say we'll take away this and 
that. It's the next level for us." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Flipper Anderson had 25 yards in the first quarter, 60 in the second, 56 in the 
third, 155 in the fourth and 40 in 8 1/2 minutes of overtime Sunday. . . . Jim 
Everett's 454 passing yards was the third-best performance by a Ram 
quarterback. Norm Van Brocklin set the National Football League record with 554 
in 1951 and Vince Ferragamo threw for 509 yards in 1982. . . . Everett, in his 
fourth year with the Rams, is already fourth on the team's all-time passing 
yardage list with 10,321 yards. Roman Gabriel racked up 22,223 yards in 11 
seasons. Van Brocklin is second with 16,114 in nine years. Bob Waterfield 
passed for 11,893 in eight years.

<P>
Kendall Gill scored 23 points and Marcus Liberty added 16 as eighth-ranked 
Illinois opened its season with an impressive road show Tuesday night, whipping 
Mississippi at Oxford, Miss., 83-72. 
</P>
<P>
After 15 minutes of close basketball, the Illini, the first Big Ten team ever 
to play on the Oxford campus, went on a 12-2 run to take a 41-32 halftime lead, 
never trailed in the second half and led by 20 points at one stage. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Joe Harvell led the Rebels with 23 points and senior Gerald Glass 
added 20 for Mississippi, which lost its second consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
In other nonconference games: 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 79, Kent State 68 -- Freshman Greg Graham scored 22 points and No. 14 
Indiana held off Kent State by making 17 of 19 free throws in the second half 
at Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoosiers (2-0) made 25 of 29 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana's sharpshooting from the line stopped a Kent State squad that came back 
from a 17-point deficit to pull within four with 6:22 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Temple 55, Penn 54 -- Heavily favored Temple shut out Pennsylvania for the 
final 1:40 and the 16th-ranked Owls squeezed by their city rival in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Penn's Paul Chambers sank a jump shot with 1:40 remaining to make it 55-54, but 
the Quakers then missed several scoring opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 101, Siena 89 -- The 18th-ranked Panthers, opening the season at 
home, avenged last season's surprising loss to the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Shorter led Pittsburgh with 29 points but Darelle Porter, subbing for the 
injured Sean Miller at point guard, had 21, as did Bobby Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt went on a 9-2 run to turn a three-point edge into a 48-38 lead late in the 
first half, then increased the margin to 14 on Shorter's breakaway dunk to 
start the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame 84, San Francisco 64 -- Keith Robinson scored 26 points and led two 
key runs for the No. 19 Fighting Irish at South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
USF (1-1) trailed 33-27 with 5:19 left in the first half before Notre Dame, 
playing its season opener, scored 12 consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame led at halftime, 48-29, but the Dons scored nine of the first 10 
points in the second half, including seven by Joel DeBartoli, who finished with 
17. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish responded with another 12-point run to boost the lead to 61-38 with 
13:41 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech 87, Richmond 74 -- Dennis Scott scored 30 points and freshman 
standout Kenny Anderson added 24, nine assists and five steals to lead No. 21 
Georgia Tech at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Tech (2-0) squandered leads of nine and 14 points before finally putting the 
Spiders away. Richmond fell to 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 85, Chicago State 62 -- Minnesota had five players in double figures 
in the season opener at Minneapolis. The Gophers outscored Chicago State, 10-2, 
at the start of the second half, breaking open the game. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa 68, Drake 54 -- James Moses scored 18 points and Les Jepsen added 14 
Tuesday to lead the Hawkeyesat Iowa City. The victory was Iowa's 11th straight 
over the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson 71, The Citadel 54 -- Forward Dale Davis scored 17 of his 19 points in 
the second half as Clemson pulled away from a 24-22 lead in the second half at 
Charleston, S.C. Davis also pulled down 12 rebounds. The victory boosted 
Clemson's record to 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky 76, Ohio University 73 -- Rick Pitino got a narrow victory in his 
debut as coach of the Wildcats at Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky opened a 48-32 lead on Jeff Brassow's tip-in with 17:23 remaining in 
the game, but Ohio (1-1) battled back on Dave Jamerson's outside shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Jamerson, who scored 19 of his game-high 30 points in the second half, got 12 
of them in a 22-8 run that trimmed Kentucky's advantage to 56-54 with 10:18 
left to play. Jamerson made two three-pointers in the spurt. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Hanson scored 24 for Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia 87, Samford 61 -- John Crotty scored a career-high 26 points and 
Bryant Stith powered a first-half Virginia surge at Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Crotty, a junior point guard, sank four three-point shots and Kenny Turner, a 
junior forward, made all nine of his shots as the Cavaliers improved to 3-0. 
Stith added 18 points. Wisconsin 81, North Dakota State 55 -- Willie Simms 
scored 20 points and Danny Jones added 18 for the Badgers at Madison, Wis. 
Wisconsin opened a 42-29 halftime advantage against the Division-II school and 
had no trouble improving its record to 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Rhode Island 88, Brown 59 -- Eric Leslie, Rhode Island's leading scorer last 
season, picked up right where he left off by scoring a career-high 34 points in 
the Rams' season opener at Providence. 
</P>
<P>
Manhattan 85, Columbia 67 -- Peter Runge and Keith Bullock each scored 19

scoring in a second-half surge for the Jaspers. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard 94, New Hampshire 74 -- Ralph James had 19 points as Harvard handed New 
Hampshire its third-straight loss in a game at Durham, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis State 91, Wyoming 75 -- Elliot Perry scored 24 points and had eight 
steals for 22nd-ranked Memphis State in a ragged game at Memphis. There were 46 
turnovers and 59 fouls. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State 94, North Texas 66 -- Royce Jefferies scored 21 points as 
23rd-ranked Oklahoma State, playing without leading scorer Richard Dumas, 
opened its season at Denton, Tex. Dumas was serving a one-game suspension 
because he missed a team curfew. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada Reno 70, Santa Clara 69 -- Jon Baer drove for a layup with 12 seconds 
left, lifting the Wolf Pack to its victory at Reno. 
</P>

1989-90 BOYS' BASKETBALL PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
MATER DEI EXPECTED TO REBOUND FROM 'DISAPPOINTING' SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
THE TEAMS: THE MONARCHS, WHO RETURN FOUR STARTERS FROM LAST YEAR'S 25-3 TEAM, 
ARE THE PRESEASON CHOICE TO TOP THE COUNTY'S RANKINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Where else but at Mater Dei High School would a coach term a 25-3 season as 
disappointing? 
</P>
<P>
That's disappointing, as in being upset by St. Monica, 69-66, in the 
quarterfinals of the postseason playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
That's disappointing, as in failing to win a Southern Section championship for 
the first time in six years. 
</P>
<P>
And that's disappointing, as in losing for only the second time in 28 playoff 
games since Gary McKnight became Mater Dei's coach in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, the expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"The team exceeded my expectations by winning 25 games, but when you consider 
what other teams have done here in the past, it was disappointing," McKnight 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, more expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei, with four starters and nine players who made significant 
contributions last year returning, is The Times' choice as Orange County's 
top-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
There isn't a player comparable to former stars Matt Beeuwsaert, Tom Lewis, 
LeRon Ellis or Mike Mitchell in the lineup, but McKnight thinks he could have 
four players who will eventually sign with Division I college programs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my most-balanced team," he said. "It's a very good team without a 
superstar." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, six county teams -- Saddleback (5-AA), Capistrano Valley and Irvine 
(5-A), Corona del Mar and Trabuco Hills (3-A) and Orange Lutheran (2-A) -- 
reached Southern Section championship games. Trabuco Hills advanced to the 
State Division III title game. 
</P>
<P>
It's considered another strong year for area teams, with the Sunset and South 
Coast leagues among the most competitive in the county. Here's a look at The 
Times' top teams: 
</P>
<P>
1. MATER DEI 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs will have two distinctly different looks as McKnight plans to 
employ a two-post offense or a four-guard lineup depending on the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Jason Quinn, the most valuable player in the Angelus League as a 
junior, averaged 6.6 assists and two floor burns per game last year. Quinn's 
in-your-face style of defense is rare in an era of high-powered offenses. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the toughest players I've ever coached," McKnight said. "We have 
players more talented than Jason, but no one works harder." 
</P>
<P>
The thin towers -- 6-foot-8 Derek Stone and 6-11 Mark Moneypenny -- are the 
main supports of McKnight's double low-post power game. Forwards Charlie Andres 
and David Boyle are proven starters who will be joined by Danny O'Neil, the 
school's starting quarterback, in certain situations. 
</P>
<P>
"The first nine games will tell the story," McKnight said. "If we stay healthy, 
we could be a pretty good team come January." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei figures to get better in midseason, when Ocean View transfer Reggie 
Geary becomes eligible. Geary, a sophomore point guard playing on the junior 
varsity team, received recruiting letters from Nevada Las Vegas, Kentucky, 
Notre Dame and Southern Methodist this week. 
</P>
<P>
2. LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
<P>
Two victories over Mater Dei during the summer were encouraging, but the 
question of whether Los Alamitos can play with the county's best teams could be 
answered in the Tournament of Champions next month at Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
Center Robert Conlisk is among three all-league players returning for Coach 
Steve Brooks. Conlisk, a 6-9 senior, was impressive during the second half of 
Empire League play and opened some eyes by scoring 30 points and getting 18 
rebounds in a playoff victory over El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
"He just continued to improve all summer," Brooks said. "He's a very good 
offensive player. He just needs to improve on his rebounding and defensive 
play." 
</P>
<P>
Junior point guard Todd Chesebro begins his third varsity season, and backcourt 
mate Mike Wilson averaged 15 points with his accurate outside shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Cunningham, younger brother of standout running back Erik Mitchell, is 
the most athletic player on the team. Cunningham is an excellent leaper with 
good quickness. He's also a threat from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
"Potentially, this could be the best team I've ever had," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
3. CAPISTRANO VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
Last year's top-ranked team in the preseason poll went on to win the 5-A 
division title despite repeated signs of immaturity by forward Scott McCorkle, 
who still believes he has never committed a foul. 
</P>
<P>
McCorkle, the county's best player, is often moody and selfish, but few can 
match his natural talent. McCorkle broke three scoring records by averaging 
32.5 points per game in the Tournament of Champions and averaged 24.1 points 
for the season. 
</P>
<P>
McCorkle shared the South Coast League's most valuable player award with 
teammate Chris Kostoff, a six-foot guard who averaged 15 points and 8.4 assists 
per game. Both are excellent players who should score than than half of 
Capistrano Valley's points between them. 
</P>
<P>
"We have two very good players, but the rest of the players on the team are 
going to have to learn their roles," said Mark Thornton, Capistrano Valley's 
coach. Translation: Pass the ball to McCorkle or Kostoff and then get out of 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
4. MARINA 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Marina Coach Steve Popovich said he would like to have the money 
colleges were spending for postage sending letters to 6-11 center Cherokee 
Parks. He also wanted some outside shooters to compliment Parks' imposing 
inside game. 
</P>
<P>
While six or seven letters a day continue to arrive addressed to Parks at the 
high school, Popovich found two outside shooters to take some of the pressure 
off Parks. Sean Haselrig and Mater Dei transfer Travis Boyd will keep opposing 
defenses honest. 
</P>
<P>
Parks, who will be the most actively recruited player in county history next 
season, continues to improve while growing into his lanky body. Up to 222 
pounds, Parks is stronger and more versatile. 
</P>
<P>
"He's improved his skill level to the point where he can go outside and hit the 
jump shot," Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
5. EDISON 
</P>
<P>
Only the day-to-day status of center Bill Martineau keeps the Chargers from 
being ranked higher. Martineau, who averaged 12.8 points and 7.6 rebounds as a 
junior, has a sore back that kept him from playing in Edison's scrimmage with 
Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Returning with Martineau from last year's 15-13 team is guard Tom Tyler, 
forward Steve Thobe and swing man Todd Smyser. Brandon Jessie, son of former 
Ram wide receiver Ron Jessie, is an impressive newcomer. 
</P>
<P>
"This could be the best team I've had at Edison," said Coach Jon Borchert. 
"With Martineau, Thobe and Jessie, we are a very good rebounding team." 
</P>
<P>
6. HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
<P>
The arrival of Savanna transfer Mustaphi Abdi could help ease the memory of 
eight football forfeitures and a lost league football championship. 
</P>
<P>
Abdi was only the third player in 15 years to earn all-county honors as a 
sophomore when he averaged 17.7 points to lead Savanna to the 
</P>
<P>
Orange League championship. He was a force in two playoff games, scoring 65 
points against Azusa and Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Abdi joins returning starter Stephan Lucas to give Huntington Beach one of the 
best forward tandems in the county. Dennis Callahan, who played two years at 
Mater Dei, is the team's point guard. Callahan was the most valuable player on 
the Oilers' junior varsity team that won the Sunset League title. 
</P>
<P>
"The big question is how Mustaphi adapts to the Sunset League," said Roy 
Miller, Huntington Beach coach. 
</P>
<P>
7. OCEAN VIEW 
</P>
<P>
The fourth member of the Sunset League ranked among the top 10 teams lost the 
league's most valuable player, Todd Norman, who has graduated, but returns 
another tall, talented cast of players led by point guard Greg Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Evans averaged 10.6 points, 3.7 rebounds and three assists per game last year 
to help Ocean View to a share of the league title with Huntington Beach and 
Edison. He has signed a national letter of intent with Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
Darren Ernst, a 6-6 senior, also started last season, and 6-5 Jim Gwaltney was 
a key reserve. Coach Jim Harris has five players on his roster standing 6-5 or 
taller, but his freshman son, Jim, broke his foot last week in a scrimmage 
against Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
8. FOOTHILL 
</P>
<P>
A tall front line and guard Mark Wilkinson should help the Knights shed the 
role of perennial runner-up in the Century League. Foothill has finished second 
in the league for five consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
Jamal Duff, a 6-7 center, has improved his shooting touch to the point where 
Coach Jim Reames said, "He's almost a player." Another bright spot is 6-6 
forward Fred Amos, who led Foothill's junior varsity to a league title. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson, who has signed with Cal State Northridge, has improved his shooting 
range to 17 feet and takes on the added responsibility of playing the point 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my biggest team," Reames said. "If we had a legitimate point guard, 
we'd be dynamite." 
</P>
<P>
9. EL TORO 
</P>
<P>
Rob Johnson and Jeremy Hogue are still playing football, but El Toro should be 
strong once those two join Greg Everett and Kirk Riddle. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, one of the premier three-point shooters in the county, averaged 17.2 
points as a sophomore despite often being asked to play point guard. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Rob will be a more consistent and complete player who has the 
capability of becoming a great player," Coach Tim Travers said. "But we're 
going to start slowly without him." 
</P>
<P>
Everett, who signed with Creighton, is one of the top defensive players in the 
county. But it's the play of Riddle, a 6-7 center, that has Travers smiling. 
</P>
<P>
10. WESTERN 
</P>
<P>
No longer the best-kept secret in the county, Western won 26 games over the 
summer despite being without its second-best player, Tom Barraza, who was 
injured. "It was our best summer ever," said Greg Hoffman, Western's coach. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Sam Sabbara, the All-American kid with a 3.8 grade-point average 
and the student body president, is the school's best player in the past 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows he's good, so he'll be harassed, chased and spit on all year," 
Hoffman said. Center Robbie Shelton's rebounding is the key if the Pioneers 
hope to live up to their preseason ranking. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch: Brea-Olinda, Fountain Valley, Irvine, Mission Viejo, 
Saddleback, Santa Ana, Savanna, Sunny Hills and Woodbridge.

<P>
There was little doubt Rancho Santiago College's football team played the final 
three weeks of the regular season with a degree of revenge. 
</P>
<P>
As the Dons defeated Fullerton, Saddleback and Orange Coast, each victory 
erased memories of a three-game losing streak last season that ruined a 6-0-1 
start. 
</P>
<P>
But in Saturday's first game of the Orange County Bowl doubleheader at Orange 
Coast, the Dons (9-1) will play a new role when they take on Moorpark (9-1) at 
1 p.m. Riverside (10-0) faces El Camino (10-0) at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
No longer will revenge be a motivational tool for Coach Dave Ogas and his 
staff. Instead, they will have to combat it. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago upset Moorpark, 17-10, last season after Moorpark came into the 
bowl game with a 9-1 record and the Western State Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark is back with an identical 9-1 record, but this time, the Raiders have 
added incentive -- a chance to avenge last season's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"We told the kids they (Moorpark) will come into the game with something to 
prove," Ogas said. "But we also have something to shoot for. We can win 10 
games and that would be impressive." 
</P>
<P>
The nine games Rancho Santiago already has won is the most since 1962. The Dons 
were 10-0 and won the Junior Rose Bowl that season. 
</P>
<P>
Men's soccer: Orange Coast opens play Friday in the state soccer championships 
at El Camino College in Torrance. The Pirates (16-4-2) play American River 
(18-1-1) at 6 p.m., and Cuyamaca (15-4) plays Fresno City (15-3) at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The winners meet Saturday at 1 p.m. for the state title. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast, which defeated East Los Angeles, 2-1, Saturday to advance to the 
final four is expected to get a boost from the return of Andy Strouse. 
</P>
<P>
Strouse, the Orange Empire Conference's most valuable player, missed two 
playoff games because of arm surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Oldham leads the Pirates with 21 goals, and Strouse is second with 19. 
</P>
<P>
Women's soccer: The Orange Coast team, which won its fourth consecutive South 
Coast Conference title last week, plays for the state title Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast (12-4-4) meets Cosumnes River at El Camino College at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
If the Pirates can win the title, it will be the 100th victory for the program 
and Coach Barbara Bond in eight seasons. Bond, the only coach the program has 
had, has a career mark of 99-30-12. Orange Coast has won the South Coast 
Conference title five of the past six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
All-conference volleyball: Sophomore Maureen Flannigan of Golden West was voted 
the most valuable player of the Orange Empire Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West, the conference champion, put three other players on the first team 
-- Joli Eberhart, Jeni Murrell and Heather Bova. Golden West's Albert Gasparian 
was voted coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Cyndi Rhone and Heather Mead of Saddleback, Lisa Falletta of Fullerton and 
Angela Ramirez of Riverside also were named to the first team. 
</P>
<P>
Stacia Allen and Erin Holleman of Golden West, Laura Farrell and Jody Narey of 
Saddleback, Lisa Papazian and Christy Richmond of Fullerton, Melanie McDowell 
and Erin Wood of Riverside, Kari Calliham of Cypress and Cathy Scanlon of 
Orange Coast were named to the second team. 
</P>
<P>
Noticeable omission: Although the Mission Conference Central Division coaches 
put 18 players on their offensive first team -- a sure penalty -- Mark Craig of 
Orange Coast was left off. Craig, who did make second team, had more receptions 
than any of the first-team receivers or any receiver in the Central Division, 
for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
Craig had 52 catches for 802 yards. Paul Peters of Rancho Santiago had 38 
catches for 612 yards, Mike Thomas of Fullerton had 41 catches for 638 yards 
and Cameron Lymon of Riverside had only 21 catches 610 yards. Peters, Thomas 
and Lymon were named to the first team. 
</P>

O.C.'S KOLL CO. SELLS INDUSTRIAL PLANTS TO JAPANESE 
</P>

In one of the largest sales of Orange County real estate this year, the Koll 
Co. sold 24 industrial buildings -- half of them in the county -- for $138 
million to Fujita Corp. USA, a Japanese developer with U.S. headquarters in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Scher-Voit Commercial Brokerage in Irvine, the broker on the deal, said it was 
one of the largest purchases of industrial buildings in California this year. 
</P>
<P>
The deal also included warehouse, light industrial, and research and 
development buildings in San Diego, Los Angeles and the San Francisco area. In 
all, the deal included 1.8 million square feet of space. 
</P>
<P>
Among the larger properties sold by Koll in Orange County were a Garden Grove 
business park at Garden Grove Boulevard and Western Avenue and the Toshiba 
building in Irvine with 118,000 square feet of space. 
</P>
<P>
Koll is a huge real estate developer based here that occasionally sells 
buildings from its $4 billion in West Coast real estate holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Fujita USA, though it has operated in the United States since 1972, is only a 
small player in the California real estate market. The company specializes in 
industrial buildings -- preferring to stay away from what it says is an 
overbuilt office market -- and until now had owned only 13 buildings in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Fujita is a larger player in the Japanese real estate market, where it owns and 
develops property as well as doing engineering and construction. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial buildings are often a good investment in California's urban areas 
because land is so expensive that few new factories or research and development 
buildings are being constructed. That means landlords have less competition for 
tenants in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
Fujita USA said several other buyers had been interested in the Koll buildings 
since they went on the block about three months ago but declined to identify 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Koll executives were said to be unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
No specific breakdown was available for how much the Orange County properties 
accounted for the $138-million price tag. But with half the properties in the 
county, the deal is sizable and likely ranks among the biggest real estate 
transactions of the year here. 
</P>
<P>
The other major deals this year also involved foreign buyers. Those were the 
$104-million purchase of the Dana Point Resort by a Japanese kimono 
manufacturer, Tokyo Masuiwaya California Corp., and the $245-million sale of 
two parcels to Australia's Qintex for construction of another resort hotel. 
Qintex's deal for one of the parcels later fell through, however.

TRADE DEFICIT RISES AFTER 6 MONTHS IN DECLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit, after improving for six months, deteriorated slightly 
to $27.75 billion in the third quarter, fed by America's appetite for imported 
goods and by flat exports, the government said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts do not see much improvement in the near future. Imports may drop 
somewhat because of a slowing U.S. economy, they said, but exports also are 
likely to fall because of a strong dollar and moderating economies overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the gap between imports and U.S. exports edged up 
0.7% in the July-September quarter from the second quarter's $27.55 billion. 
The April-June gap deficit was the narrowest since a $27.7-billion imbalance in 
the first quarter of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Imports posted a 0.3% gain to a record $119.3 billion, while exports rose only 
0.2% to $91.6 billion, also a record. Both imports and exports have reached 
record levels during each of the last five quarters. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts worry that exports, which sustained much of the U.S. economy last 
year, will remain unchanged in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"The trade report substantiates what we've already seen," said Allen Sinai, 
chief economist of the Boston Co. "Export growth simply has flattened out after 
booming previously and is a major source of the wave of weakness rippling 
through the U.S. economy, particularly the manufacturing sector." 
</P>
<P>
Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist for Kleinwort Benson Government 
Securities Inc. in Chicago, agreed that the pace of exports is "probably coming 
to the end of its run due to the dollar." 
</P>
<P>
A stronger dollar makes U.S. goods more expensive and thus less competitive 
overseas, while making imported goods cheaper and thus more attractive to 
American buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Kahan also said that "as the (British) economy slows, which seems likely, and 
some of the other industrial countries, particularly Japan, moderate their 
(economic) activity, that should hurt our exports." 
</P>
<P>
Sinai said he expected imports to decline and the U.S. economy to weaken in the 
next few quarters. 
</P>
<P>
But Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser for the WEFA Group in 
Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., pointed to the high level of oil imports, which he said will 
continue and further aggravate the trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the average number of barrels imported daily 
increased 8.5% to 8.65 million barrels in the third quarter -- the highest 
level since the third quarter of 1977. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the increase, oil imports showed a July-September numerical 
decrease of 1% because of lower prices. The average price per barrel fell to 
$16.85 from $18.46. 
</P>
<P>
Non-oil imports rose 0.5% to $106 billion, led by consumer goods, including 
clothing and household goods. Imports of industrial supplies and materials 
fell, while both capital goods and automotive products were virtually 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Non-farm exports increased 2% to a record $81.8 billion. The sector was boosted 
by shipments of capital goods, including aircraft and parts to Western Europe, 
Japan and newly industrialized countries in the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Shipments of non-farm products such as industrial supplies and materials and 
automotive parts fell. Farm products also fell, down 10% to $9.8 billion.

PACIFICARE SYSTEM'S EARNINGS RISE 71%

Powered by strong membership growth and aggressive control of medical costs, 
PacifiCare Systems Inc. earned a record $10.9 million for the year ended Sept. 
30, up 71% from $6.3 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The health maintenance organization, the fourth-largest in California, said 
Monday that its membership increased more than 70%, to 553,165 enrollees in the 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Lowell, PacifiCare's chief financial officer, said the burgeoning 
membership substantially increased its administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
However, that added expense was successfully offset by the company's efforts to 
reduce medical costs as a percentage of revenue, Lowell said. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Terry Hartshorn, PacifiCare's president and chief 
executive officer, said: "The earnings increase is primarily attributable to 
our ongoing cost-control efforts and our case-management program. 
</P>
<P>
"Our health-care costs as a percentage of revenue are down, compared with a 
year ago. Our hospital costs -- measured by days per thousand members -- are 
among the lowest in our history and are even lower today than they were a year 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
PacifiCare's revenue for the 1989 fiscal year was $650.2 million, up 52% from 
$428.5 million. Net income for the fourth quarter stood at $4.1 million, up 78% 
from $2.3 million for the same period of fiscal 1988. Revenue was $190.6 
million for the quarter, up 60% from $119 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
PacifiCare Health Systems owns and operates HMOs in California, Oregon, 
Oklahoma and Texas and an insurance subsidiary licensed in 33 states. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Richter, senior vice president and health services analyst with Dean 
Witter Reynolds in New York, said PacifiCare's bright year-end financial report 
comes as no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"These numbers are very strong and show the strength of PacifiCare as a 
dominant player," he said. "And we should see a continuation of very strong 
results in 1990 and 1991."

FIDELITY CHAIRMAN QUITS HAMMOND BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The chairman of Fidelity National Financial Inc. resigned Tuesday from the 
board of the Hammond Co. in an attempt to ease tensions that have sprung from 
Fidelity's interest in a possible buyout. 
</P>
<P>
William P. Foley II, chairman of the Irvine title insurance company, resigned 
mainly because Fidelity was making no headway in its limited talks with Thomas 
T. Hammond, chairman and president of the mortgage banking firm, according to 
Frank P. Willey, Fidelity's executive vice president and general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Foley had earned a seat on Hammond's board in July after Fidelity bought 16.3% 
of the firm. Fidelity has since acquired a 23.6% stake in Hammond and said in a 
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in late September that it 
would be interested in acquiring Hammond on a friendly basis. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 8, Fidelity agreed not to purchase any more shares of Hammond for six 
months. In return, Hammond was to provide business and financial information to 
Fidelity so that it could decide whether to make a formal offer for Hammond. 
</P>
<P>
Willey said the two firms had "very preliminary" talks during the summer about 
doing business together by steering customers to each other and had talked a 
little more in recent months about a possible purchase price for the rest of 
the Hammond Co. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on what they would like to receive for the stock on a friendly basis, 
the price is more than we're willing to pay," Willey said. No offer ever was 
made during the limited talks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're comfortable with where we are now," Willey said. "It's not our intent to 
aggravate Tom or give him any concern over operations of Hammond Co. We'll 
weigh the alternatives at the end of six months and decide what to do then."

UCI'S MADRIGAL DINNER SERVES UP HEARTY SLICE OF 16TH-CENTURY RENAISSANCE;

<P>
For the first time in nine years, Richard Clark won't take part in UC Irvine's 
annual Madrigal Dinner. 
</P>
<P>
He won't help re-create the 16th-Century Renaissance yule feast -- complete 
with hot wassail and figgy pudding, wandering minstrels, magicians and mimes -- 
that has fed and entertained more than 30,000 guests over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
He won't sing traditional airs or perform a pillow dance for 20th-Century 
comers to the court of King Henry VIII. 
</P>
<P>
And he won't supervise props, as he has for the past four years, ensuring that 
the king and queen have their golden goblets or that the ceramic wild boar's 
head arrives on time and intact. 
</P>
<P>
But Clark, who moved from Orange County to Northern California in January, 
won't miss the merrymaking either, even though it meant paying for a plane 
ticket to travel back to Tudor England. 
</P>
<P>
"The holidays don't start until opening night of the madrigal dinners," 
insisted Clark, who has flown in from Cupertino to dine with the audience and 
make sure the prop department knows what it's doing when the banquet's 10-night 
run begins Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Nina LoMonico, who is in her seventh year and will play Catherine of Aragon, 
Henry's first wife, echoed Clark's sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Christmas would be the same without doing a madrigal dinner 
first," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark and LoMonico's devotion to the Madrigal Dinner, through Dec. 13 at the 
UCI Fine Arts Village, is common among the production's 140 cast members. 
</P>
<P>
Presented by the choral organizations of UCI, the popular Christmas feast and 
well-mannered celebration features a full meal, Renaissance music and song, and 
the antics of King Henry VIII's court. It is acted, sung, danced and served by 
students and community members, many of whom come back year after year, even 
some, like Clark, who have left Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Clark's return to help his replacement through opening night characterizes "the 
kind of dedication we can't do without," said Melinda Huszti, who designs and 
sews the production's costumes. She also assists her husband Joseph Huszti, 
UCI's music department chair, who is directing the 12th annual Madrigal Dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"They are hams," said Joseph Huszti, explaining his cast's persistent 
enthusiasm with a kindly laugh. The dinner also allows them to learn about 
British history. They do extensive research to develop their roles and to bring 
the characters to life, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Drace Langford, a sociology senior, will play Henry VIII this year, his fourth 
time in the role. At a recent rehearsal, he explained that each year's dinner 
takes place during a different period in the king's life, and said this 
semester his research focused on the year 1520 and "The Field of the Cloth of 
Gold," a key summit meeting between England and France. 
</P>
<P>
"The king at this time is a very happy man," said Langford, 21. Dressed in a 
fur-trimmed coat, the 6-foot-2 student has an auburn beard and an uncanny 
resemblance to the young monarch. "He's in shape physically, he hunts, he wrote 
a lot of music and he had absolute reign. His word was obeyed, there was no 
screaming. He just said it and it was done. I take that into my character, but 
I don't get cocky because he was a fun guy and everyone respected him." 
</P>
<P>
While key Madrigal Dinner cast members, such as Langford, play characters 
modeled after real-life figures and largely follow a script, other participants 
make up their own characters. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ellen Patitucci, a 22-year-old senior studying music, created the persona 
of Marie of Aragon this year for her fifth banquet. 
</P>
<P>
"I've decided to be the cousin of the queen, and I'm traveling with the court 
as a guest," said Patitucci, bedecked in a red and purple velveteen gown. "I'm 
in search of a French man (to marry) and I also enjoy sitting next to (Henry's 
chief adviser) Cardinal Thomas Wolsey because he's a man of great power and 
perhaps I can get some land out of him by being very friendly and charming." 
</P>
<P>
Patitucci, like all court members, will also mingle with the audience, 
improvising as she goes: "I'll talk to them, spread gossip, tell them how I 
want to find a French man. People love it when you let them in on your story, 
they think they are getting something special and you are a historical figure 
speaking to them." 
</P>
<P>
"Playing off the audience" is also a way to sustain a high level of energy 
during the three-hour production during which not a single court member leaves 
the banquet hall, Patitucci said. "It's hard. You're singing and dancing and 
you get hungry. Everybody is eating and you're not." 
</P>
<P>
Staying in character all the while proves challenging to madrigal performers as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, a rainstorm blew open a giant door to the banquet hall, startling 
diners and court members alike. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in the middle of a song and we did react to the door -- we looked 
around in concern for our guests -- but then we just kept right on singing," 
said LoMonico, 25, a first-year graduate student studying vocal performance. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Erwin, who will play France's lecherous King Francis I and a refined 
English lord, finds it easy to stay in character. He has the opposite problem, 
in fact. 
</P>
<P>
"The first two nights it's a breeze," said Erwin, who graduated from UCI in 
1988 and returned for his fourth Madrigal Dinner this year. "But then you'll go 
to work or class, and you'll find yourself bowing to people as they walk by. Or 
I've gone shopping and I find myself saying, 'Yes, my lord, quite.' It's really 
embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
Erwin, 24, said he expects another sort of challenge ahead: "Not to collapse of 
utter exhaustion by the end of the run. Especially this year, I'll be working 
an eight-hour day, then going straight to theater from work." 
</P>
<P>
But, like others who must prepare for finals while they rehearse and perform 
the project, the effort is absolutely worthwhile, said Erwin, a claims 
representative for State Farm Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's weird. Some nights all of a sudden you look up and say 'Good heavens, 
that's Henry the VIII,' and it hits you that you are doing more than a show. 
Theater is supposed to be a willing suspension of disbelief and that really 
does happen. Everyone is so into what they are doing that it does become Tudor 
England for two hours and you really are yanked back into the 16th Century when 
those house lights go up." 
</P>
<P>
There's also the camaraderie that results from all the hard work and hours 
spent together, Madrigal Dinner players agree. 
</P>
<P>
"You make friends here you'll keep for life," LoMonico said. 
</P>
<P>

CINEMA SOCIETY ROUNDING UP THE USUAL SUSPECTS: REAL BUFFS; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: ABOUT 100 FILM FANS HAVE BOUGHT MEMBERSHIPS IN A NEW ORANGE COUNTY 
CHAPTER, WHICH SHOWS U.S. FILMS BEFORE THEY PREMIERE AND SPONSORS RECEPTIONS 
AND TALKS.

<P>
Owning and running a restaurant used to keep La Jolla film buff Bruce Klowden 
from going to the movies as often as passion impelled him. Work botched up any 
sort of social life, in fact. Cinema Society helped change all that. 
</P>
<P>
For the last four years, Klowden and his wife have belonged to the society, an 
organization for movie lovers that offers private screenings of major, 
first-run U.S. films before they premiere publicly. Advance-screening 
receptions and post-show lectures and audience discussions are part of the 
package. 
</P>
<P>
Begun in San Diego in 1984 and since expanded to three other West Coast 
chapters, the society has now found its way into Orange County with a fifth 
chapter in Costa Mesa and is scheduled to screen its first film in January, 
organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
"We love it," said Klowden, owner of Aesop's Table restaurant in La Jolla. "It 
forces us, in our busy schedule, to go and do something of a social nature, and 
we have an interaction with people doing the same thing we are interested in." 
</P>
<P>
Much like season subscribers to the ballet or opera, for $150 annually members 
are guaranteed admission to at least 10 films and typically are shown more, 
said society founder and director Andy Friedenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Among movies the society has screened, anywhere from a few days to a month 
before general release: "Moonstruck," "A Room With a View," "Working Girl," 
"Kiss of the Spider Woman," "Stand by Me," "Mystic Pizza" and, recently, "Steel 
Magnolias." 
</P>
<P>
Membership also includes a monthly newsletter with screening dates, the 
advance-screening receptions with free light refreshments and post-movie 
lectures, delivered occasionally by an actor in the film or its director, but 
most often by local specialists conversant with each movie's subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance, when we showed 'The Last Emperor' in San Diego, we had a 
professor of Chinese history from the local university," Friedenberg said. 
"When we showed 'Punch Line,' we had a local stand-up comic." 
</P>
<P>
In Costa Mesa, the society will be co-sponsored by Women in Commercial Real 
Estate, a trade group that sells memberships to the movie group in return for 
15% of the revenues. Films will be shown Thursday nights at the Edwards Town 
Center Cinema. 
</P>
<P>
Why join the society, whose San Diego branch has sold out its 500 memberships 
annually since 1984, rather than simply drive to the local multiplex? Several 
reasons, Friedenberg said, but mainly it "forces" busy people, as Klowden put 
it, to make the time and commitment to movie-going. 
</P>
<P>
"We send members the newsletter two to three weeks before, and they put 
(screenings) on their calendar," Friedenberg said. "Also, they have a cocktail 
party where they know they'll see friends, they know they won't wait on lines, 
that they'll learn about the film they're seeing and get to talk about it, that 
they'll see it before others see it, and see it with a mature audience with no 
crying kids." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the society's "mature audience" is key to its modus operandi, 
Friedenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
While he said he has no special arrangement with the Hollywood studios from 
which he rents films, the society generates ticket sales and support for movies 
that appeal to "adult, sophisticated" film fans (you won't see "Friday the 
13th," for instance) -- the very sort of films that he would like to see 
Hollywood make more often. 
</P>
<P>
Society members, mostly professionals whose average age is 40, "are key 
opinion-makers in the community (who) will see a film and tell their friends," 
said Friedenberg, who also runs a nonprofit foundation screening classic films. 
"Word of mouth is the strongest advertising tool for studios." 
</P>
<P>
Friedenberg, 34, created the film society after working for six years a 
regional publicist and promoter for such studios as Columbia and United 
Artists. The society screens mostly U.S.-made films because "it just works out 
that way," he said. "There are a lot of interesting films being made in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
He decided to open a chapter in Orange County partly because "people said, 'You 
have to do it in Orange County. They support the arts, they love the arts 
there.' " 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach-based Women in Commercial Real Estate will use its 15% of county 
membership revenues to support its own work encouraging professional 
development among real estate women, said Patricia Ann Rock, a Newport Beach 
real estate agent who is coordinating the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Rock added that some of her group's proceeds may also go to a local charity. 
The other society chapters -- based in northern San Diego County, Seattle and 
Portland, as well as the city of San Diego -- form similar partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an interesting joint venture between an artistic group and a 
business organization in a local community, and a novel way to promote the film 
arts," Rock said. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 Orange County Cinema Society memberships have already been sold, she 
said. For information, call (714) 733-5545, or the society's San Diego 
headquarters, (619) 454-7373.

O'CONNOR HEADS TEAM FOR OWNERS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: MEETINGS AIMED AT NEW AGREEMENT WITH THE PLAYERS ASSOCIATION OPEN 
WITHOUT RONA ON MANAGEMENT BARGAINING UNIT

Negotiations begin Tuesday on baseball's new collective-bargaining agreement, 
just hours after Chuck O'Connor replaced Barry Rona as head of the owners' 
negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
Rona, executive director and general counsel of the clubs' Player Relations 
Committee since 1986, resigned Monday in a move that surprised some baseball 
officials. Neither Rona nor Commissioner Fay Vincent would comment on the 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
With O'Connor in charge as acting general counsel, management's team met for 
two hours with officials of the Major League Baseball Players Association. The 
current collective-bargaining pact, agreed to in August 1985, expires at 
midnight Dec. 31. Both sides expect negotiations to be difficult and have 
amassed strike funds that will amount to more than $50 million each. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor called the meeting "constructive" and said, "It was typical of the 
opening meeting of negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee owner Bud Selig and New York Mets co-owner Fred Wilpon sat in on the 
talks, along with PRC lawyers John Westhoff and Lou Melendez, Bill Murray of 
the commissioner's office and Robert Manfred, a lawyer at O'Connor's firm. The 
union was represented by union head Donald Fehr, union lawyers Eugene Orza, 
Lauren Rich, and Michael Weiner, and Mark Belanger, Fehr's assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr said the union wanted to discuss "iron-clad collusion protection," 
negotiating rights of players with less than three years service, increasing 
roster sizes and increasing the money devoted to benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Selig, the PRC chairman, said Rona's resignation was voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
"He could have stayed on," the Milwaukee owner said. "Was it forced? Absolutely 
not. It's always interesting that people read things into things like this." 
</P>
<P>
One source said there was no indication of the move prior to Monday. Another 
source, who asked not to be identified, indicated that Rona's relationship with 
Vincent was different from the relationship he had with Peter Ueberroth and A. 
Bartlett Giamatti, Vincent's predecessors.

<P>
Here's what you want to know. 
</P>
<P>
The top boys' basketball players in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Introducing . . . 
</P>
<P>
THE STARTING FIVE 
</P>
<P>
Scott McCorkle, forward, Capistrano Valley: A senior, McCorkle was the 
runner-up to Rick Swanwick (now at UC Irvine) as The Times' Player of the Year. 
McCorkle, 6-feet-5, has signed with Syracuse. He led Capistrano Valley to the 
5-A championship and averaged 24.1 points a game. Great jumping ability makes 
him first-team all-slamma jamma. 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee Parks, center, Marina: He's already the greatest name in county 
basketball and about to become the greatest player in some time. Only a junior, 
Parks, 6-11, averaged 20.3 points and 10.3 rebounds and was the runner-up in 
Sunset League MVP voting. A week at the Nike Camp in Princeton, N.J., this 
summer gave Parks experience against the nation's best. 
</P>
<P>
Mustaphi Abdi, forward, Huntington Beach: Transferred from Savanna over the 
summer. Abdi, 6-3, was the Orange League player of the year as sophomore, 
averaging 17.7 points and 11.2 rebounds. Also shot 60% from the field. In two 
playoff games, he averaged 31.5 points and shot 78% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Sabbara, guard, Western: Best point guard in Orange County by far, and 
could prove to be the most versatile, too. Sabbara, 6-1, averaged 14.6 points, 
6.1 rebounds and 5.8 assists as a junior. What more could you want in a point 
guard? The best player at Western in years. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Walker, guard/forward, Brea-Olinda: Averaged 26 points a game last season 
and has improved greatly since. The 6-5 Walker, had 65 points in a scrimmage 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
THE SECOND FIVE 
</P>
<P>
Daryl Cole, forward, Orange Lutheran: The best of the small schools players. He 
shot 55% from the field and 85% from the free-throw line last season. Averaged 
21.6 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Conlisk, center, Los Alamitos: The second-best big man behind Parks, and 
improving. Conlisk, a 6-9 senior, averaged 16.4 points, 9.4 rebounds and four 
blocked shots. Voted the No. 1 center at the Superstar Camp at UC Santa Barbara 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Evans, guard, Ocean View: A fine outside shooter, Evans, 6-2, has signed 
with Loyola Marymount. He averaged 10.6 points, 3.7 rebounds and three assists. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Johnson, guard/forward, El Toro: Johnson averaged 17.3 points and 3.8 
assists as a sophomore. He was a first-team all-leaguer. He's one of the best 
three-point shooters. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Kostoff, guard, Capistrano Valley: A point guard, Kostoff directed the 
Cougars to the 5-A championship. He averaged 15 points and 8.4 assists. 
</P>
<P>
TWO TO WATCH 
</P>
<P>
Jason Cunningham, forward, Los Alamitos: A 6-4 sophomore transfer from Mayfair, 
Cunningham is the younger brother of Griffin running back Erik Mitchell, a 
1,000-yard rusher this season. Griffin Coach Steve Brooks raves about him. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Geary, guard, Mater Dei: A 6-2 sophomore, Geary transferred from Ocean 
View and has to sit out for a calender year. He'll be dominant on the junior 
varsity level until he becomes eligible for the varsity team in February. 
Monarch Coach Gary McKnight says he's as good as he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
BEST OF THE REST 
</P>
<P>
CENTERS 
</P>
<P>
Bill Martineau (Edison) -- At 6-9, 200, Marinteau qualifies as all-space-eater. 
He averaged 7.5 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Mitchelson (Sunny Hills) -- A 6-6 junior, Mitchelson averaged 8.2 points 
and 6.9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Stone (Mater Dei) -- A 6-8, three-year starter, Stone is as solid and 
hard-working as they come. Averaged 7.1 points and five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Wilborn (Canyon) -- Averaged 12.4 points and was the county's 
fifth-leading rebounder with 10.5 average. A 6-4 junior. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Wiltshire (Southern California Christian) -- Coach Mike Murphy calls 
Wiltshire, a 6-7 senior, one of the best in any division. Averaged 19.2 points 
and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch: Greg Everett (El Toro); Steve Marusich (Servite); Eric Preuss 
(Savanna). 
</P>
<P>
FORWARDS 
</P>

man, carrying on in the tradition of fine front-line players at Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
John Molle (Irvine) -- As a sophomore, Molle made an impact on the Vaqueros' 
5-A runner-up team. A 6-4 junior, Molle shot 62% from the field, 82% from the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
Elton Moore (Saddleback) -- Was a key player off the bench, helping the 
Roadrunners to a runner-up spot in the 5-AA. He's a 6-3 string bean, cut in the 
mold of Craig Marshall, Saddleback's defensive specialist now at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Wilson (Santa Ana) -- The Man-Child has grown into a Man. At 6-3, 225,

Quinta); Trent Jullian (La Quinta); Jeff Leedom (El Modena); Bryant McLemore 
(Woodbridge); Joe Squyres (Garden Grove); Romalis Taylor (Woodbridge). 
</P>
<P>
GUARDS 
</P>
<P>

Averaged 17 points a game and shot 65% from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Barker (Kennedy) -- A 6-5 swing man, Barker camps out on the three-point 
line. He averaged 16.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
Augustine Heredia (Estancia) -- He's not real big at 5-11, 150, but is one of 
the best long-distance shooters in the county. Averaged 15 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Kriech (Trabuco Hills) -- Another good outside shooter, Kriech helped the 
Mustangs to the state championship game. 
</P>

Jason Quinn (Mater Dei) -- Quinn, a 5-10 senior, averaged 3.5 points and 5.5 
assists and was Angelus League player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Tes Whitlock (Loara) -- He's playing on a mediocre team, but that makes his 
efforts stand out all the more. A 6-2 junior, Whitlock is a three-year starter. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch: Addi Barkordar (Canyon); Tom Barraza (Western); Mike Bradach 
(El Dorado); Danny Castro (Anaheim); Jimmy Galbert (Saddleback); Andy Karich

For the third consecutive season, a conflict with the Padres likely will force 
San Diego State to alter its home football schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs were scheduled to play Texas El Paso Sept. 22 at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium in the third game of the 1990 season. But the Padres have taken 
that Saturday night for the second game of a three-game weekend series against 
the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs would prefer to eliminate the conflict by arranging a three-way swap 
of home states with UTEP and Wyoming. SDSU Athletic Director Fred Miller said 
Tuesday night. Instead of playing host to UTEP Sept. 22, the Aztecs would 
travel to El Paso, and instead of playing at Wyoming Oct. 6, the Cowboys would 
come to San Diego. The Aztecs would complete the switch in 1991 by playing at 
Wyoming and playing host to UTEP, the opposite of how the games originally were 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
But the plan has hit a snag because of Wyoming's objection to playing the 
Aztecs in San Diego three years in a row. Wyoming also is concerned that the 
switch could affect its home football revenue for 1990, said Bill Lamberty, 
Wyoming's assistant sports information director. 
</P>
<P>
The swap also would mean that the Aztecs would play at UTEP for three 
consecutive seasons, but Miller said SDSU had no objection to that arrangement. 
He said the matter would be discussed further at the Western Athletic 
Conference meetings later this month. But Lamberty said Wyoming was firming its 
objections to the proposed swap. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the schedule conflict is the result of football schedules being set 
years in advance before the Padres' schedule is known. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have scheduling priority over the Aztecs in the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
This conflict comes after a season in which the Aztecs were fored to move what 
was a planned Sept. 9 game against Cal State Long Beach to Oct. 14. Last year, 
the Aztecs moved their 1988 home opener with Air Fore from Saturday night to a 
Sunday night to accommodate the Padres.
