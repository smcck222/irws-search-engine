MAKEUP OF PUC MAY SHIFT BEFORE VOTE ON MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The announcement that the state Public Utilities Commission won't complete its 
review of Southern California Edison's proposed merger with San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric until early next year is raising questions about which PUC members 
will be around to write the controversial decision. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners had hoped to stick to a self-imposed schedule that called for a 
final merger decision by the end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
That schedule irritated some merger opponents, who argued that the PUC was 
moving too quickly on the merger that would create the nation's largest 
electric utility. But utility executives, who proposed the merger in late 1988, 
have maintained that the year-end deadline gave opponents ample time to voice 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
PUC President G. Mitchell Wilk's acknowledgement on Tuesday that the review 
will be extended into 1991 prompted merger opponents to begin speculation on 
what Gov. George Deukmejian and Gov.-elect Pete Wilson intend to do with 
positions that will become vacant Dec. 31, when commissioners Stanley W. Hulett 
and Frederick R. Duda are scheduled to leave office. Both have asked to be 
reappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Although all five commissioners have followed merger developments, following 
PUC practice, Hulett and Wilk were assigned early to pay special attention to 
the complex merger review. Some utility industry observers have questioned the 
wisdom of adding two new commissioners who would have to wade through thousands 
of pages of testimony to get up to speed on the complex merger review. But 
others believe that the merger is so important that a final vote should be 
delayed until after two new commissioners are appointed. 
</P>
<P>
If Hulett and Duda depart, and successors are not quickly named, the merger 
vote could be taken with just Wilk and Patricia M. Eckert and John B. Ohanion 
on the commission. Wilk said Wednesday that a recently written report from the 
PUC's chief legal counsel gives the three remaining commissioners an "absolute" 
right to conduct a merger vote. 
</P>
<P>
But Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network, a 
San Diego-based consumer group, argues that the PUC has an "obligation" to 
Californians to wait until the commission is at full strength before voting on 
the monumental merger that would create an electric and gas utility with 4.5 
million customers in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Shames and San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor soon will ask Deukmejian and Wilson 
to appoint two new commissioners to the PUC, including one San Diegan and, 
possibly, another Southern Californian. Now, Eckert, from Los Angeles, is the 
only Southern Californian on the PUC. Shames maintains that the two new 
appointees should have as few ties as possible to the utility industry. 
</P>
<P>
Wilk said Wednesday that Hulett and Duda both have told Deukmejian and Wilson 
of their desire to be reappointed to the PUC for full terms, or, at the least, 
until the merger vote occurs. 
</P>
<P>
But Deukmejian, who is busy dealing with a growing state budget deficit, said 
Wednesday that he hasn't "made a decision on (PUC appointments) yet. Honestly, 
it's not on my desk yet." Wilson was not available for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said Tuesday that Wilson should appoint two new commissioners, 
including one from San Diego, since a San Diegan has not sat on the commission 
in at least 30 years. O'Connor also questioned whether Hulett and Duda have 
already made up their minds to support Edison and SDG&amp;E when the final vote 
is taken. 
</P>
<P>
But O'Connor spokesman Paul Downey said Wednesday that the mayor has not yet 
formally asked Wilson or Deukmejian to appoint new commissioners. "She's spoken 
to the governor-elect and congratulated him, but she's not had an opportunity 
to discuss issues," Downey said. "But I think it would be her hope that he 
would make two new appointments." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for SDG&amp;E and Edison on Wednesday declined to comment on the 
question of how Deukmejian and Wilson should handle the PUC appointments. "We 
have a very significant merger case pending before the commission, and it would 
not be appropriate for us to comment on the makeup of the commission," said 
Edison spokesman Lewis Phelps. "Whatever we say might be misconstrued." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we would have a preference," said Bill Reed, SDG&amp;E's 
director of regulatory affairs. "That would be talking about how the commission 
conducts its business, and that would be at the discretion" of Wilk, the PUC 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Hulett, who was appointed to the PUC in 1986, said Wednesday that he hadn't 
heard one way or the other from Deukmejian or Wilson. "But Gov.-elect Wilson 
has 1,000 appointments to make, so obviously he's (busy)," Hulett said. 
"Neither of them has told me to go away and stay away, though."

SUPT. PAYZANT'S BIRTHDAY STIRS A BROUHAHA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Depending on which city teacher you talked to this week, Kay Wagner had either 
a "cute idea" to make Supt. Tom Payzant smile or one of the more "Mickey Mouse" 
notions of late out of the district's central office. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, the city district's fine-arts coordinator, suspected she was navigating 
uncharted waters when she sent a memo earlier this month suggesting that 
teachers and students might want to draw portraits of Payzant in honor of his 
50th birthday today. 
</P>
<P>
True to her suspicions, Wagner found out this week that not even the birthday 
of the schools' chief proves immune from the political and philosophical 
crosscurrents of urban education. 
</P>
<P>
On one hand, elementary teachers from about 40 schools responded positively to 
the idea of having their first- or second-graders spend an hour putting 
together caricatures of Payzant, "roughly based" on copies of photos Wagner 
attached to the memo. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the idea was harmless and real cute -- since kids like to draw -- 
and we should be supportive of our superintendent," Rhoda Kaldowksi, a teacher 
at Bethune Elementary in Paradise Hills, said of the charcoal sketches and 
pop-up pictures her students made. 
</P>
<P>
But, at the secondary level, the corps of fine arts teachers, with few 
exceptions, found the proposal both a ridiculous diversion from their already 
crammed curriculum and ironic, given the diminishing district resources 
allotted to their subject the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really stupid, to be honest with you," said Toni Green, art teacher at 
Marston Middle School. "Lots of teachers aren't exactly crazy about the man we 
fight with over salary every year, and the kids don't even know who he is -- 
they want to draw something meaningful, to get recognition or prizes for their 
art." 
</P>
<P>
Sighed Wagner this week, "I thought of this activity to get (Tom's) attention 
on the arts and to celebrate something that is really significant for everyone 
here, his 50th birthday." 
</P>
<P>
Some schools returned Wagner's memo to her with various sarcasms scrawled 
across the margin, accusing her of hero worship, and the like, in wanting to 
post the portraits outside of Payzant's office this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there's a lot of anti-Payzant sentiment out there, but I've worked with 
a lot of superintendents, and Tom has been as supportive of the arts as any of 
them," although that would not always be saying much, Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
"But goodness sakes, it's his birthday and, despite those sour feelings, 
wouldn't they have gotten into the spirit of things?" 
</P>
<P>
At Zamorano Elementary, the district's fine-arts magnet school, some teachers 
laughed, thinking the idea was a "joke" to make Payzant into a "Martin Luther 
King" Jr. icon or something, vice principal Beth Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
But a few were intrigued, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great way to make him smile when he walks through the door today," 
teacher Leslie Barnes said. "I talked with the children about his job, and how 
to make gifts and how to show people we appreciate them. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about facial shapes, and where the chin goes, and we took yellow 
pieces of paper and cut and fringed it to look like his hair, and then the 
children put ties on him, or drew flowers in a pocket or put glasses on him." 
</P>
<P>
For art teacher Sandra Buck at Crawford High School and many of her colleagues, 
however, Wagner's idea only fit the concept of "a quickie assignment" for grade 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got our own curriculum, and this was by no means important enough to 
take time out and paint portraits of Payzant," Robert Coons of University City 
High said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Ernestine Bradley at Point Loma High: "It's bizarre -- Payzant gets this 
huge big raise (a four-year, 54.5% pay increase last May) and we get $1,000 for 
the year for arts supplies. So why should we bow ourselves to Dr. Payzant and 
honor him with our school work when he's done so little for the arts?" 
</P>
<P>
Wagner agreed that district funding for the arts "is not overwhelming" but 
asked, "By not doing something, is that going to get him to support arts more?" 
</P>
<P>
One of the few secondary teachers who did take on the assignment as a class 
project was Catherine Carrick at Mira Mesa High, whose outspoken principal, Jim 
Vlassis, has not always been known as a Payzant fan. 
</P>
<P>
To balance matters, however, Carrick promised a similar effort for Vlassis when 
he retires in two years.

EX-LAWYER PLEADS GUILTY TO FEDERAL CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former San Diego attorney Richard Degallegos, who already had given up his 
clients to the State Bar and quit the practice of law, pleaded guilty Wednesday 
to federal fraud, tax and contempt charges. 
</P>
<P>
Degallegos, 50, who had been named in April, 1989, on a 24-count indictment, 
pleaded guilty on the day his trial was due to begin to three charges: mail 
fraud, filing a false claim for a tax refund and contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
The former lawyer, who could draw as much as 10 years in prison, also agreed 
Wednesday to repay each of the clients the indictment alleged he defrauded, 
said Assistant U.S. Atty. George D. Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
If he had been convicted of all charges, Degallegos could have been sentenced 
to a maximum term of 115 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleged that, over a six-year period, Degallegos was involved in 
various criminal schemes. 
</P>
<P>
He was accused of misappropriating funds belonging to clients, disobeying the 
orders of a bankruptcy court judge, setting up an illegal rebating scheme while 
working as a life insurance salesman in 1984, and falsely claiming an income 
tax refund of about $85,000 in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Degallegos, a graduate of Western State University of Law in San Diego, 
operated a law practice under the names Plaza Legal, Carriage Legal Center and 
Scripps Mesa Legal Center. He claimed to have offices throughout the state and 
in Washington, Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, after clients complained that Degallegos failed to show up for court 
appearances and misappropriated money, he was investigated by the State Bar, 
the Internal Revenue Service, the San Diego County district attorney's office 
and the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1988, State Bar officials made the unusual move of taking over his 
law practice. Later, Degallegos resigned from the bar.

PAIR ARRESTED IN KIDNAPING OF 4 STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four San Diego State University students were kidnaped and robbed early 
Wednesday as they left an East San Diego pizzeria. An hour later, two suspects 
were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured, but three shotgun blasts were fired during the incident, 
said Dave Cohen, a spokesman for the San Diego Police Department. The suspects 
were taken into custody without incident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Paige, 24, Matthew Pianin, 19, Erik Kaplan, 19, and Ryan Dinsmore, 18, 
were leaving the Etna restaurant in the 4400 block of El Cajon Boulevard about 
1:45 a.m. when two robbers confronted them, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
The students were forced at gunpoint to drive to a bank branch at College 
Avenue and El Cajon Boulevard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the gunmen became angry and fired a single shotgun blast into the air 
when one of the victims was unable to withdraw more than $40 from the bank's 
automated teller machine, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The students were then forced to drive to an apartment complex at 39th and 
Myrtle streets in East San Diego, where one of the abductors went inside and 
returned with a second shotgun and a handgun, Cohen said. During the time they 
were at the apartment complex, the gunmen in the car fired a shotgun blast 
through one of the car's doors and another through the back window, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The journey continued to the dormitory of one of the students at 5500 Montezuma 
Road, Cohen said. While one of the captors took the student to his dorm room, 
the three other students and a gunman remained in the car, he said. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU campus police patrolling the area noticed the illegally parked car about 3 
a.m. and became suspicious, Cohen said. As they approached the car, the three 
students escaped, and the gunman fled on foot, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
After waiting several minutes, police caught one suspect, identified as Timothy 
Long, 19, when he and the student returned from the dorm room, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
The second suspect, identified as Bryan Tanner, 27, was arrested a short time 
later at a nearby convenience store, where he had ordered a clerk to call him a 
cab. Both suspects were booked into County Jail on suspicion of kidnaping and 
robbery.

FPPC CLEARS NATIONAL CITY COUNCIL MEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jess E. Van Deventer, National City city councilman, has been cleared by a 
state agency of allegations that he willfully failed to disclose properties 
that he owns in the city's redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for the Fair Political Practices Commission, 
said Tuesday that the agency's eight-month investigation showed that Van 
Deventer complied with the law by filing amended economic disclosure statements 
showing ownership of the lots. 
</P>
<P>
The new filings also disclosed 14 sources of income that Van Deventer had 
previously failed to report. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided not to open a case. He presented a lot of amendments (to previous 
disclosure statements), and there was nothing to suggest anything was amiss. 
The disclosures were provided voluntarily," Michioku said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Deventer amended his filings with the FPPC in March, after he became aware 
that private investigator John Gier was probing the councilman's financial and 
property interests. Gier, who is from Orange County, said he was hired by a 
National City businessman to investigate Van Deventer. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Van Deventer said he was not surprised by the FPPC's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very comfortable. I did all the corrections required by law that we had 
to do. You just can't leave it in the hands of someone else. You've got to take 
care of it yourself, and that's what I did," Van Deventer said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Deventer acknowledged all along that he had violated state law by failing 
to report all of his properties and sources of income. But he blamed a former 
business adviser, who Van Deventer said advised him to transfer the properties 
and the income they generated to a corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Although the properties were listed as being owned by the corporation, Van 
Deventer admitted that he and his wife were still the real owners. 
</P>
<P>
He blamed the business adviser for giving him faulty advice and subsequently 
fired him. 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC's finding only clears one hurdle for Van Deventer. The district 
attorney's office is investigating possible conflict-of-interest violations by 
Van Deventer for purchasing property in the redevelopment area while on the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
At issue are eight properties he purchased from 1981, when Van Deventer was in 
his first council term, to 1988. Van Deventer failed to report them and 14 
other sources of income in the economic disclosure statements he filed with the 
FPPC between 1981 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the eight properties that were not previously disclosed lie in the 
redevelopment zones. 
</P>
<P>
Van Deventer and the other City Council members also serve as the Community 
Development Commission, the city's redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
District attorney spokeswoman Linda Miller said Wednesday that the local 
investigation of Van Deventer is continuing. She refused to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, National City City Atty. George Eiser said Van Deventer 
committed a misdemeanor violation of redevelopment laws that prohibit 
councilmen from buying property in redevelopment areas once the boundaries are 
drawn. The National City redevelopment boundaries were first drawn in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Eiser told The Times that he advised Van Deventer in 1986 that he was in 
"technical violation" of state conflict-of-interest laws and urged him to 
dispose of the properties. 
</P>
<P>
Van Deventer said he acted on Eiser's recommendation by transferring the 
properties to the corporation set up by his former business adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Eiser could not be reached for comment on the FPPC's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Van Deventer declined to comment on the district attorney's probe, but said, 
"I've got nothing to hide."

BUSH AND ASSAD

<TEXT>
<P>
Why does our President meet eagerly with the Syrian head of state, our former 
enemy, Hafez Assad, instead of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, our former friend? 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, for all the wrongs he may have done, has shed no Yankee blood, whereas 
Hafez Assad has been accused of master-minding the terrorist attack on the 
Lebanon Marine headquarters that killed 241 American Marines. 
</P>
<P>
Might it not be more to the point and far less costly if Bush and Hussein could 
share a meal together and talk turkey? It wouldn't be as spectacular as Bush's 
well-staged desert extravaganza on Thanksgiving Day, but it might be more 
productive, especially if both leaders would give a little to gain a peaceful 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Surely both men are smart enough to know that war gains nothing but loses 
lives, dollars and the very property they are trying to save.

In The Times' article "Women Drivers Banned by Saudis as 'Portent of Evil' " 
(Nov. 15), the Saudis showed their true feelings towards Americans, who have 
saved their country from being invaded and annexed by Iraq, when they condemned 
Saudi women drivers as either "American agents" "communists or secularists." If 
it weren't for the presence of American troops there, the Saudis would have 
Iraqi drivers in tanks in their streets instead of Saudi women to complain 
about. 
</P>
<P>
We must not get involved in a war in the Mideast protecting people of such a 
diverse culture who really resent us. As Sen. Bob Dole said, we are in the 
Mideast because of three letters: Oil. We are there because of the industrial 
complex to protect their supply of oil. We have ethanol and can convert our car 
engines to run on that fuel and thus help American corn farmers and not have to 
spend billions on Middle Eastern oil. That entire region (especially Iraq and 
Iran) is holding us hostage because of our dependence on their oil. 
</P>
<P>
We must break free of that dependence and let the area solve its own problems.

NOW TAXPAYERS ARE STRESSED; 
</P>
<P>
LONG BEACH GRANTS STRESS-DISABILITY RETIREMENT TO TWO COPS IN STING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Long Beach police officers appearing -- on videotape -- to violate the 
civil rights of an activist will receive stress disability payments for life, 
city officials have decided. The source of this debilitating stress? 
Psychological problems stemming from their own alleged misconduct. Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
In question is the case of Don Jackson, African-American activist and a former 
police officer who set out to show through a sting operation that police 
brutality against blacks was still a major problem. In January, 1989, hidden 
NBC cameras videotaped Long Beach police officers' arrest of Jackson and one 
officer's apparent assault. Officer Mark Dickey appeared to push Jackson's head 
through a plate-glass window. Dickey was charged with misdemeanor assault; he 
and Officer Mark Ramsey were also charged with allegedly lying about the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Citing stress-related illness from the incident, the city granted Dickey and 
Ramsey half of their pay for life. Dickey is 29; Ramsey is 28. 
</P>
<P>
A trial in January will determine the guilt or innocence on the criminal 
charges. But whatever the outcome, stress disability retirements in cases like 
these are enough to set anyone's teeth on edge. Half salaries for the two young 
officers will cost taxpayers more than $36,000 every year for decades. The very 
thought is outrageous. What sort of mixed message is Long Beach or any city 
sending in a case like this? How can such disability retirements not be seen by 
many as almost a reward for alleged police misconduct? 
</P>
<P>
Yet the city may have had no choice. While city officials were tight-lipped 
about the matter, some suggested that since city doctors agreed with the 
finding of the officers' doctors -- that Dickey and Ramsey could not continue 
to do police work -- the city had to grant disability retirements. Yet Dickey 
and Ramsey are free to work other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Go figure. At the very least, better police training probably figures in here 
somewhere. It certainly is cheaper. And a lot less galling.

FOUL PLAY

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was more than mere unsportsmanlike conduct by some clownish football 
players. Much worse. And so the most famous football incident of the season so 
far has occurred off the field -- in the locker room of the New England 
Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
And now NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue has had his say. With his ruling 
Tuesday, he put all players, staff, coaches and owners on notice: Women 
sportswriters have every right to cover these teams -- and without sexual 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliabue fined the New England Patriots and three players after an independent 
investigation substantiated allegations made by Lisa Olson, a reporter for The 
Boston Herald. She was interviewing a player in the locker room when several 
teammates sexually harassed her with offensive words and repulsive actions. 
Tagliabue levied $25,000 fines against the owner, Victor Kiam, and the team. 
</P>
<P>
He also fined the most active and insulting player, Zeke Mowatt, $12,500. Two 
verbal accomplices were each charged $5,000. Those fines -- small change to 
athletes who earn an average of $400,000 -- should be a warning of even 
stronger penalties for any such future violation. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also criticized Kiam and his management for their abysmal 
handling of the matter. Kiam initially belittled the incident, dismissing the 
allegation of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
All too often that's management's initial reaction when one of the guys 
harasses a female colleague. In too many cases, including that football locker 
room, nobody tries to stop it.

PRESIDENT SALINAS SHOWS THE OIL CARD; 
</P>
<P>
A STUNNING CRACK IN LONG-HELD MEXICAN POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like a magician who keeps pulling rabbits out of a hat, Mexico's President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari came up with another surprise at his Monterrey summit 
meeting with President Bush. There the energetic young leader who has broken so 
many of the totems of Mexican politics began chipping away at the biggest one 
of all: his nation's oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady announced that Salinas has requested a $1.5- 
billion loan guarantee for PEMEX, Mexico's state-run oil monopoly, from the 
U.S. government. If approved, the money would be used to contract with U.S. oil 
companies to drill for Mexican oil. For their own political reasons, spokesmen 
for Salinas downplayed the significance of the announcement, saying that it 
does not mean Mexico's oil fields are now open to foreign exploitation -- 
merely that a closed door had been opened just a crack. 
</P>
<P>
But even if this is only a small step, it's still dramatic. It's a step in a 
direction that no Mexican political leader has been willing to take for more 
than half a century, since revered former President Lazaro Cardenas 
nationalized the Mexican holdings of U.S. and British oil companies in 1938. 
Mexicans consider Cardenas' decision a declaration of economic independence, 
and to them it's every bit as significant as what the U.S. Founding Fathers did 
in 1776. In Mexico's political lexicon, oil is commonly called "the national 
patrimony." 
</P>
<P>
In effect, Salinas is offering Bush yet another opportunity to help him open up 
Mexico's heretofore closed economy to the rest of the world. It should be 
seized quickly. For the economic circumstances are such that Salinas may 
actually be able to convince his people and a vociferous political opposition 
-- led by, among others, Cardenas' son Cuauhtemoc -- that the oil industry is 
being opened to U.S. investment not because the gringos want it, but because 
Mexico needs it. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico has the world's fourth-largest oil reserves, and they may be even 
grander than that. One reason nobody knows for certain is that PEMEX is limited 
in its ability to look for more oil by Mexico's financial problems. That is 
also why Mexico has benefited only slightly from the recent upsurge in oil 
prices caused by the Persian Gulf crisis. Its extracting and refining 
capacities are already at their limit because there is simply not enough 
capital left in Mexico to build more refineries and look for more oil, 
especially in the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas knows the closest place to find the money and technology PEMEX needs is 
just across the border in states like Texas and California. Now he must 
convince his compatriots that, in asking the traditionally mistrusted gringos 
for help, he's not surrendering to the economic imperialism Mexicans defeated 
in 1938. It won't be easy. Politicians and oil men in this country can help by 
not boasting about this opportunity or appearing overly eager to march into 
Mexico like triumphant Marines. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end it will be up to Salinas to sell this deal to his countrymen. If 
he does, it will be the most impressive part of his act so far.

PURCHASE OF REPUTED MOBSTER'S LOW-INCOME APARTMENTS RECOMMENDED; 
</P>
<P>
REPORT: TASK FORCE CONCLUDES THAT ALLEGATIONS ABOUT OWNER'S TIES TO ORGANIZED 
CRIME 'PALE' IN COMPARISON TO CITY'S NEED FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego Housing Commission task force report released Wednesday urges the 
city to buy two low-income apartment complexes, arguing that unproven 
allegations about the owner's ties to organized crime "pale" in comparison to 
the need for low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-page report called the $47.5-million cost of buying and renovating the 
Penasquitos Gardens and Mt. Aguilar apartment complexes, owned by reputed 
mobster Alvin Malnik, "fair and reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor and Councilman Bruce Henderson, the two biggest 
opponents of the purchase, have expressed concerns about dealing with Malnik. 
Although the report responded to many of the criticisms previously raised by 
opponents, it failed to move either O'Connor or Henderson any closer to 
supporting the project. 
</P>
<P>
At a joint meeting of the commission and Housing Authority, O'Connor raised 
additional questions about the financing and whether Malnik has made all the 
necessary disclosures about his role as owner of the complexes. Henderson 
continued to argue in favor of a private buyer for the properties, which 
consist of 816 units for low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the project, led by Councilman Wes Pratt, chairman of the task 
force that put together the report, charged that O'Connor was being picayune in 
her opposition and that Henderson was opposed to the purchase on philosophical 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Although the report itself did not break any new ground, it answered some 
questions raised by O'Connor at an Oct. 15 council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Malnik has never been convicted of any crimes, and, as a result of the 
acquisition, would have no further associations with these projects," the 
report said. "HUD further reported that Malnik had managed the properties 
responsibly for more than 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Lockwood said Wednesday that a police investigation of 
Malnik's background failed to disclose any evidence of wrongdoing by him. 
However, Malnik is still the subject of a similar investigation being done, at 
the council's request, by the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
If the two complexes are purchased by the commission, rents will be subsidized 
with Section 8 funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
Rents now range from $288 to $326 for two- and three-bedroom units. There are 
no one-bedroom units. 
</P>
<P>
Housing Commission spokeswoman Mary Jo Riley said the rents are unrealistically 
low because of a financing agreement between Malnik and HUD when the complexes 
were built. Although the complexes were built for low-income residents, renters 
are allowed to stay even if their incomes increase dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
"The agreement (between Malnik and HUD) was that nobody could move in unless 
they were low-income. But, as their income increased, they were allowed to 
remain," said Riley. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, 70% of the families living at the two complexes are paying less 
than 30% of their income for rent. Under Section 8 guidelines, low-income 
renters pay 30% of their income for housing. 
</P>
<P>
If the commission succeeds in purchasing the apartments, rents would increase 
by one-third per year for three years, Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Oct. 15 council meeting, O'Connor suggested that someone on the 
commission staff purposely omitted Malnik's name as owner of the complexes in 
the paper work forwarded to the council. She also accused the commission of 
hiding the fact that a company partly owned by Malnik would manage the 
properties for one year after their sale to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The task force report said the commission had acted on other purchases by 
identifying only the company that owned them and not the individual owners. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no policy at this time to identify individual owners of property in 
this type of transaction. . . . In light of this experience, it is recommended 
that a policy of identifying owners be developed and implemented," said the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
As for the company that will manage the apartments for one year after their 
purchase by the commission, the report said Malnik divested himself of the firm 
in early 1989. Further, it was HUD's recommendation that the company that now 
manages the apartments continue in that capacity for one year after the 
purchase, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The report urged the City Council, which also acts as the Housing Authority, to 
move quickly on the apartments, warning that federal money for the purchase may 
not be available in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt's staff said $6.8 million for the financing will come from federal funds. 
About $4.2 million will come from tax credits, $9.2 million from state housing 
rehabilitation funds and $500,000 from a reserve account. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the financing will come from $26.7 million in tax-exempt bonds to 
be issued by the Housing Authority. Approval for issuing the bonds is expected 
to come Jan. 17, when the commission and Housing Authority meet jointly again.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oceanside's growth-control law received another setback Wednesday when the 
state's 4th District Court of Appeal refused to hear the city's plea to 
overturn a lower court ruling against Proposition A. 
</P>
<P>
Without comment, the three appellate judges let stand Vista Superior Court 
Judge Herbert Hoffman's decision on Aug. 22 that Proposition A fails to 
guarantee that the city will provide its regional fair share of lower-income 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
The Building Industry Assn. of San Diego, which along with developer Del Oro 
Hills filed suit against the slow-growth law, had hailed Hoffman's decision as 
helping invalidate Proposition A. 
</P>
<P>
However, the city asked the appellate court on Oct. 20 to set aside Hoffman's 
ruling, claiming he had incorrectly interpreted the law in reaching his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
But the appeals court's unwillingness to hear the matter means the litigants 
return to Superior Court on Feb. 11 to begin a new trial on another aspect of 
Proposition A. 
</P>
<P>
While the first trial before Hoffman focused on whether Proposition A made 
enough housing available, the next phase will concern whether the 
growth-control law is necessary under state law to protect the health and 
safety of the city.

When 13 Navy ships depart San Diego and Long Beach on Saturday for the Persian 
Gulf, they will carry 6,000 sailors and more than 7,000 Marines, military 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held aboard the amphibious assault ship Tarawa, Rear Adm. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen S. Clarey, commander of Amphibious Group 3, said the 13,000 crewmen and 
troops will be part of the largest single amphibious task force to deploy from 
Southern California since 1965. Ten of the ships will leave from San Diego, 
three from Long Beach. He said the 12,000-mile journey will take more than a 
month, and the ships are prepared to celebrate Christmas at sea. 
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. Peter J. Rowe, commanding general of the 5th Marine Expeditionary 
Brigade, said his Marines are ready. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be hard for some people to understand, but this is our profession. This 
is what we get paid to do," he said. "It's certainly not easy to walk away from 
one's family, especially during the holiday season. But that's all part of 
discipline. . . . We are willing to pay a price."

U.S. Border Patrol agents early Wednesday seized 246 pounds of ephedrine, the 
primary precursor to crystal methamphetamine, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials say increasing amounts of ephedrine are being smuggled into 
the country from Mexico after a crackdown on sales in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Agents discovered the substance at about 6 a.m. Wednesday in the trunk of a car 
that came from the area of the border fence near Dairy Mart Road in San Diego, 
said Ted Swofford, a Border Patrol spokesman. When agents attempted to stop the 
vehicle, Swofford said, it sped towards the fence and the driver fled into 
Mexico on foot. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
The ephedrine was valued at about $133,000, Swofford said, and it could yield 
more than $1 million worth of methamphetamine.

HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: 'WOMEN AND AIDS' FOCUS OF ANNUAL OBSERVANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The third annual World AIDS Day has been set for Saturday. The United States is 
one of more than 150 countries that have set aside this day to draw attention 
to the pandemic disease, according to a recent issue of NEA Today, the magazine 
of the National Education Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA is a U.S. co-sponsor of AIDS Day, along with the American Assn. for 
World Health, the Pan American Health Organization and the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
The theme of the 1990 observance is "Women and AIDS." An estimated 150,000 
women have developed the disease since 1980, and 2 million are infected with 
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. During the '80s, an estimated 200,000 infants 
were born with HIV infection contracted from their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
The theme also acknowledges women's role in preventing infection with HIV and 
in caring for people with HIV infection or with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The American Assn. for World Health is producing a free kit that contains 
activities suggestions, a resource directory for AIDS educational materials, 
proclamations and the 1990 poster. 
</P>
<P>
To get on the mailing list for World AIDS Day, send your name and address to

HOT TOPICS: CENSORSHIP IS REJECTED BY TEEN-AGERS POLLED, 17 TO 8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ties that bind can sometimes gag, too. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts at censorship are often undertaken for the good of the public, but 
what about the counter argument? Do we not have the right to be exposed to 
anything and everything and then make up our own minds? 
</P>
<P>
Hot Topics wonders, "What, if anything, should be censored and who should be 
empowered to do the censoring?" 
</P>
<P>
"No one has the right to censor anything because we live in the United States, 
where people have the freedom to do as they please as long as it does not harm 
anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Pam Kuramorohit, 15, junior, Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing but foul and abusive language should be censored by a group of young 
teachers, i.e., a censorship board." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Mastropaolo, 17, senior, Mater Dei 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of anything to be censored, but it doesn't mean that there's 
nothing out there to be censored. The general public should get the authority 
to censor." 
</P>
<P>
Teri Lo, 16, junior, University 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing should be censored . . . just let it be." 
</P>
<P>
Tarek Captan, 15, sophomore, La Habra 
</P>
<P>
"Bad language on daytime shows should be censored because of the kids who watch 
them. An elected official should do the censoring." 
</P>
<P>
Young Oh, 18, senior, El Modena 
</P>
<P>
"A person should censor what he thinks, rather than other people telling them 
what he can't do or say." 
</P>
<P>
Jay Cecil, 15, sophomore, St. Margaret's 
</P>
<P>
"No one has the power to censor anything because everyone has the right to 
self-expression and freedom of speech and choice." 
</P>
<P>
Royce Lin, 17, junior, Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
"Censorship is a sign of fear and weakness on the part of the censor. If it was 
obliterated, artists, musicians and writers wouldn't be so intent on creating 
the shocking, and censorship would no longer be necessary to protect the easily 
offended."

A STRONG VOICE AGAINST MATERIALISM

<TEXT>
<P>
Since I first saw your (Joseph Bell's) columns in the L.A. Times about four 
years ago, I've said to myself that I wanted to write, but being the 
world-class procrastinator and disorganized mother of two kids that I am, I'm 
only now getting around to it. It's actually better that I've waited this long 
because now I have even more admiration for the fresh (and necessary) 
counterpoint you offer the rest of us minority free thinkers here in the 
bastion of Western Conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you so much for your column on the movie (and the fundamentalist 
knee-jerk reaction to it), "The Last Temptation of Christ." Your column gave me 
the courage to stand up to the Christian "religionists" -- thanks for a very 
apt label -- who tell us that if our relationship to God doesn't please them, 
it can't possibly be acceptable to Him. It cost me a "friend," but it set me 
back on a spiritual path I had left years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you for your column on the importance of teaching discernment. It's so 
easy to fall into the trap of answering 
when-did-you-stop-beating-your-wife-type questions without seeing them for what 
they are, and in this time of dangerously narrowing focus, you help by 
continuing to remind us of the broader context and background we all fit into. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you for your column on the rip-off valet parking at local restaurants. 
Granted, compared to some of the other issues you've tackled, this one really 
didn't loom that important on the social awareness scale, but it did address 
that disturbing, all-pervasive materialistic mentality that is now the hallmark 
of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
I remember as a child hearing my staunchly Republican parents being both 
scornful of and disturbed by those in our society who seemed to feel 
automatically entitled to "their share," but now that sense of getting what you 
can from whatever situation is at hand, never mind who it leaves impoverished 
in the process, seems to be the prevailing "OK" attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks especially for your recent column about the Irvine shoeshine man who 
takes food to homeless people. What a wonderful lift it is to know people who 
go out and do things to make some of the misery and hurt better, and what a 
lesson about the good that just one person can do. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks for today's (Nov. 13) piece about how we tsk-tsk and are scandalized by 
people who are on welfare while we admire the societal manipulators who cause 
millions and billions of dollars worth of damage to everyone by working "the 
system" to their own advantage. These are the same people whose attitude of 
unbridled greed is emulated by the upper crust of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
What's happened to us? I was born here, so was my father and his father before 
him, and although I saw the progression from agriculture to our present mix of 
land development (and they call it 'progress'!), industry and business, I 
didn't see when our values changed so much. 
</P>
<P>
I could go on, but the purpose of this letter was to tell you how much I 
appreciate and admire your ideas and your column, not write one of my own, 
although reading yours sure makes me want to!

NATURE MARKET: A WALK ON THE WILDFOOD SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's mid-morning on a crisp fall Saturday in Pasadena, and a number of us are 
paying a visit to the supermarket of the swamps. It does not look much like a 
supermarket, but rather like a thicket of cattails. 
</P>
<P>
We are reassured, however, and then convinced that we are indeed in a 
supermarket by our guide and commentator Christopher Nyerges, who knows about 
such things. He tells us that both the cattail rhizome and the yellow pollen on 
young, green spikes can be pounded into nutritious flours. The plant's young 
shoots, when peeled to a white, fleshy core, are an eminently edible vegetable 
called "cossack's asparagus," and the young spike, steamed and buttered, tastes 
like corn on the cob. 
</P>
<P>
The fluff on the cattail itself is great for insulation and as a fire starter. 
And naturally the reeds can be woven into mats and baskets. All in all, the 
plant provides warmth, covering, and a variety of tasty food. 
</P>
<P>
If we'd still like to shop elsewhere for lunch, Nyerges tells us, perhaps we 
should look a few yards away, to a shallow pool that the cattails haven't 
over-run. That bright green algae swirling around the edges? Well, it tastes 
like pumpkin and is a little crunchy. We could saute it with an onion, or make 
it into a soup. 
</P>
<P>
"Scum soup," Nyerges says. "It will keep you alive." 
</P>
<P>
Nyerges conducts wild food and survival skills outings many Saturday mornings 
out of the year. This one, which focuses on the swamp environment, meets where 
the local Indians of Pasadena used to live, that is to say, right under the 
Colorado Street Bridge and the 134 Freeway. The stream here has been restrained 
with concrete banks and man-made water slides, yet prehistoric riverine 
vegetation grows virulently, along with some of the compatible European plants 
that came over in the 18th century and later. As we tramp along cars and trucks 
rumble far overhead. 
</P>
<P>
A lean, fit fellow in his mid-30s, Nyerges spent most of his Pasadena boyhood 
hiking in the San Gabriels. An interest in Native American crafts and skills, 
he says, was a natural extension of so much time spent out of doors. "I was 
intrigued that people lived here for thousands of years without stores. Yet 
they somehow made it, and I wanted to know how." Much of what he knows about 
the uses of wild food comes directly from Native American tradition. "Knowledge 
of wild plants is one part of the larger picture," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He started out thinking of wild food as a commodity, something to be used, but 
as he learned more about aboriginal ways of thinking, he saw that using up the 
earth's resources was exactly one of the attitudes which was bringing the 
planet to the brink of destruction. Aboriginal peoples, he says, regard plants 
as living things, and thus treat them with regard and restraint and reverence. 
</P>
<P>
The first plant he identifies as edible is growing along the curb of the 
parking lot. It's a small tumbleweed. Nyerges pinches off the tender tops and 
tells us that we can chop them up fine, steam them and serve them with butter. 
They're like spinach or chard, only they don't lose bulk. In the desert, they 
can be a lifesaver. These, right here, however, might not be so good to eat. As 
a rule, he says, it's best not to eat plants that have grown too close to the 
road since they might be toxic from car exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
We meet the common plantain, also called goose tongue, a squat weed with 
edible, but tough and bitter leaves and seeds that function, like psyllium, as 
an intestinal cleanser. Then there's the lemonade berry on an oak-like shrub: 
Soak the berries in water for a lemonade-like drink; as such, it was one of the 
few sources of sugar available to Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
We stop to admire the hundreds of acorns underfoot and learn that, under the 
cap and beneath the rind, there's a white meat so full of tannic acid, it's 
inedibly bitter. This acid can be leached out with repeated long boiling, after 
which the meats can be dried and ground into a passable flour for cakes and 
breads and pancakes. They have a flavor, Nyerges says, like graham crackers. 
</P>
<P>
An hour into the outing, the world appears to be very different: Everywhere we 
look, there is food. Food on trees, food in the water, food on the ground. How 
have we come to be so far from our earthly ties that we can't recognize food 
except when it's packaged and labeled and priced in a supermarket? 
</P>
<P>
Amazed, we shake seeds from common grasses and learn that any grass seed that's 
mature and not moldy can be safely eaten. We sniff laurel sumac, which is a 
natural bug repellent, and sample epazote, an unprepossessing weed with a 
beguiling, pungent clout similar to that of cilantro. When added to soup or 
beans, epazote imparts a distinctive spiciness and effectively prevents 
flatulence. Then there's the bitter mint called horehound, popular for teas and 
candy, and curly dock with its sour, vinegary greens. 
</P>
<P>
California buckwheat, with its gorgeous, deep russet blossoms, sounds and looks 
more promising than it apparently is. "You can take the flower heads, grind 
them, mix with other flour, make a bread or cake and you'll have an unappealing 
food which will give you some indication of what Native Americans were willing 
to eat," says Nyerges. "It won't remind you of buckwheat." 
</P>
<P>
When gathering wild food, Nyerges instructs us to take only what we need. Don't 
uproot whole plants for a few leaves. Pick leaves carefully and selectively, so 
the plant will keep growing. Think of beauty, of the next foragers, and the 
next generation of plants. 
</P>
<P>
As we move along, Nyerges thus collects leaves for our luncheon salad. He 
entrusts the plastic sack full of greens, however, to the eight-year-old boy of 
our expedition. As any self-respecting boy will do, he twirls the sack, beats 
it against every tree trunk and cement wall he finds, and when utterly bored, 
proceeds to stuff the whole of our promised lunch into his hip pocket. We begin 
to wonder: Will this sack of bruised greens even be edible? 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, we are introduced to the notorious Jimson weed. It's inedible, but 
not to worry, nobody would want to eat it anyway; the leaves, when rubbed smell 
like rancid peanut butter. We also meet snake root, which is toxic, and poison 
hemlock, which for over two thousand years has been famous for curing Socrates 
of life. Slowly, we recall why it is that we haven't been eating out of our own 
back yards and vacant lots. We remember our mothers, frantic, trying to find 
out if the pyracanthus berries or grass soup or ivy salad we just ate would 
kill us. Nyerges himself is stern on the subject of poisonous plants. "If you 
don't know what the plant is," he says, "don't eat it." 
</P>
<P>
Nyerges empties the plastic bag full of wild greens onto a cutting board he's 
brought in his pack. The group pulls out the bowls and forks they've brought 
and watch him expectantly. As Nyerges chops he administers a written test. It's 
hard, especially since we're hungry. He chops the leaves fine and puts them 
into a bowl. The salad contains wandering Jew, lambs quarters, cattail spikes 
(cossack asparagus), watercress, curly dock, and cactus. He pours a dressing of 
olive oil and vinegar over it. The salad is finished, only we won't be served 
until we answer all the questions in the little test. The only question I want 
answered is: Does the salad taste good or not? 
</P>
<P>
First, however, we must recite: Berries that glisten are not necessarily 
poisonous. Yucca and century plants are not cactus, but lilies. Tannic acid is 
removed from acorns by what method? We remember: Boiling. Once more, we are 
called upon to acknowledge that we should not test foods for toxicity either by 
sampling it in tiny quantities or by watching to see if animals eat it. 
"Animals get poisoned all the time," Nyerges says. The only absolutely sure way 
to avoid toxic plants it to make a positive identification. "If you don't know 
what it is," Nyerges repeats, "don't eat it." There are, however, seven plant 
families which are entirely, or at least primarily, nontoxic. Finally, the test 
is over and lunch is served. That is, Nyerges pushes some of the dark green 
glistening mash into each of our bowls. 
</P>
<P>
It is unexpectedly delicious, at once vegetal and flavorful and textural. The 
cress made the salad peppery, the cossack asparagus made it crunchy, the cactus 
made it a little bit viscous. A vinegary flavor came from the curly dock and a 
huge burst of nutrition came from the lambsquarter, or goosefoot. In a manual 
called "The Analysis of Foods" by the USDA, Nyerges tells us, lambsquarter, 
compared to all green vegetables, is shown to be the richest source of vitamins 
and minerals across the board. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert, Nyerges pulls out carob pods. Yes, carob pods, the long, shiny, 
dark-brown pods about the size of large, flat fingers that grow on the stinky 
carob trees in so many back yards. It isn't exactly the European carob that we 
eat as a chocolate substitute. The pods don't grind well; but eaten out of 
hand, the way Nyerges serves them, they are chewy and sweet and mildly 
chocolatey. They taste like a health-food candy bar, only better. 
</P>
<P>
Nyerges doesn't advocate a purely wild diet -- for himself, or anybody else. 
But he does assert that the average householder could obtain 10% to 20% of his 
or her diet from wild foods. "It takes work, it's not completely easy and it's 
not all purely fun," he says, "but it's a worthwhile thing to do." Eating wild 
food slowly attunes people to what's outdoors, to what lives and grows in their 
environment. It makes them pay attention and take care how they walk in the 
world -- after all, they might be stepping on their lunch. 
</P>
<P>
SCUM SOUP 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons butter or oil 
</P>
<P>
1 onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 potato, cut into small cubes 
</P>
<P>
1 cup algae 
</P>
<P>
2 cups water 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
Heat butter in saucepan over medium heat. Saute onion and potato in butter 
until onion is translucent. Add algae and stir. Add water and simmer until 
potato is fully cooked. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Makes 2 to 4 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
CACTUS (NOPALITOS) OMELET 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon butter 
</P>
<P>
2 cups peeled and diced cactus pads 
</P>
<P>
1 onion, diced 
</P>
<P>
4 eggs, beaten 
</P>
<P>
Hot tortillas 
</P>
<P>
Heat butter in skillet. Saute diced cactus pads and onion in butter until 
juices of cactus are released. Continue cooking until juices evaporate and 
cactus has turned from bright green to light brown. Add eggs and scramble. 
Serve over hot tortillas. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: To pick and prepare cactus pads: Pick young pads carefully, shielding 
hands with a bag, or scrape spines free of glochidia (little barbed hairs) with 
knife before picking the pads. Each pad must be cleaned of all spines and 
glochidia before it is eaten. (Scorching pads over open flame is helpful in 
removing pernicious glochidia.) Once skin is peeled, dice pad into bite-size 
pieces.

CONTROVERSY EATS AT 'DIET FOR A POISONED PLANET' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The author of a controversial book about food and water contamination claims an 
industry-sponsored campaign used slanderous tactics to discredit his recent 
publication. Others say the negative outcry, regardless of origin, is 
scientifically justified. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, David Steinman's "Diet for a Poisoned Planet" (Harmony: $21.95) has 
generated more criticism than any other book of its kind. The phrases used to 
describe the work include "trash," "harmful to the health of any consumer" and 
"alarmist." 
</P>
<P>
Steinman became a target because he painted a bleak picture of how pesticide 
residues, chemical contaminants and other toxins are pervasive in the 
environment. He writes, for instance, that "just eating the foods and drinking 
the water of late twentieth century America can kill you." 
</P>
<P>
A surprisingly diverse collection of groups have gone on record against the 
author, including the Bush Administration, the American Dietetic Assn., the 
American Cancer Society, the Alliance for Food and Fiber, the American Council 
on Science and Health, and former surgeon general C. Everett Koop, who wrote "I 
was amazed that any publisher would publish such trash." 
</P>
<P>
"It's remarkable how much effort food and chemical industries are making to 
squelch this book," said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the 
Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest. "Steinman made a 
sincere effort to alert people to problems in the food supply and -- whether or 
not I agree with him -- those problems deserve discussion and should not be 
shoved under the carpet by the food industry." 
</P>
<P>
Even before national distribution of the book's 40,000 copies began, California 
Raisin Advisory Board lawyers requested that it be halted because Steinman 
"misled" readers when describing raisins as "a highly pesticide-saturated 
food." 
</P>
<P>
Freshwater fish, processed meats, dairy products and conventionally grown 
produce are other foods considered dangerous by Steinman. "Cows, pigs and other 
animals raised for slaughter concentrate toxins in their flesh from all the 
food they eat -- thousands of plants laced with chemical pesticides," the book 
states. 
</P>
<P>
Portions of "Poisoned Planet" use red, yellow and green lights to characterize 
the safety of individual foods. Some red-light victims: peanuts, bacon, hot 
dogs, veal, swordfish, lobster, eel, butter, milk chocolate, cheese, ice cream 
and whole milk. 
</P>
<P>
And in his most ambitious leap, Steinman maintains that diabetes, cancer, 
Parkinson's, Alzheimers and other diseases are the "consequences" of exposure 
to chemical residues in foods. 
</P>
<P>
Critics complain that he writes about the total number of residues on certain 
foods, but he doesn't discuss the actual level of these compounds present. For 
instance, using federal data Steinman states that as many as 97 chemical 
residues were found on 16 different peach samples between the years 1982 and 
1986. Yet he does not say at what level these compounds were detected nor how 
many were found on each piece of fruit. Neither is any mention made of whether 
the residues were present in parts per million or parts per billion. (The 
federal government establishes Acceptable Daily Intake levels for each 
pesticide permitted for use on foods.) 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Steinman stood by all the controversial claims made in 
his book and came armed with volumes of data to support his contentions. He 
also tape-recorded the session -- for his "protection," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he thinks "Poisoned Planet" has generated so much criticism, Steinman 
said it was because his approach to the subject differs from that of 
scientists. "I've painted food safety on a much larger canvas than scientists, 
who lose control of the subject when you paint food safety as a political and 
moral issue," he said. "They (scientists) want to place (the debate) on risk 
alone but they do not deal with the issue in its entirety." 
</P>
<P>
Steinman was unrepentant about his use of terms such as "drenched in 
pesticides," even though virtually all pesticide residues in food are found in 
parts per million or parts per billion. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Saturated with pesticides' is correct, exactly," he said. "There are lots of 
safe foods and a few bad actors that I have highlighted (in the book). . . . 
I'm here to say that not all foods are created equal. There are clear patterns 
of contamination." 
</P>
<P>
Although there are no known causes or cures for Alzheimer's disease, Steinman 
stands by his book's claim that the presence of aluminum in cookware, foods and 
medicine "may play the decisive role in the onset of Alzheimer's." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware of any nutritive value of aluminum in foods," Steinman said. "No 
one has acquitted aluminum as a contributor to Alzheimer's. It may not be a 
sole cause . . . but what's the difference?" 
</P>
<P>
On the link between industrial pollution and pesticides triggering the onset of 
diabetes, Steinman said he could not give references for the association "off 
hand." Nor did any diabetes research reference appear for the chapter in which 
the illness was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
While listing numerous sources in a "Poison Planet" appendix, Steinman rejected 
the use of footnotes in the book. As a result, his claims of cancer rates, 
pesticide residue calculations and other important scientific references are 
difficult to directly attribute. He said the use of footnotes would be 
"tedious." "I wrote this book for a lay audience," Steinman said. 
</P>
<P>
And Steinman's reply to critics who claim "Poisoned Planet" is "alarmist" is 
"the only ones alarmed by my book are those with a lot of money to lose if 
people stop eating pesticide- and chemical-(laced) food," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most controversial points in "Poisoned Planet" is the author's 
advocacy of "detoxification," or a nutritional regimen designed to cleanse the 
body of contaminants with the aid of, among other things, niacin supplements. 
He specifically recommends a formal $3,000 detoxification program offered by 
HealthMed (with clinics in Sacramento and Los Angeles). The basics of this 
detoxification formula were advanced in the 1950s by the late L. Ron Hubbard, 
Church of Scientology founder; Steinman says that the California clinics are 
operated by practicing Scientologists although the directors have no formal 
connection with the church. Steinman, who denies any personal link with 
Scientology, says he himself has no religious affiliation. He says he would 
"pray anywhere that they didn't ask him to pay." 
</P>
<P>
Steinman argues that several published research studies indicate that the 
cleansing does occur and can be accelerated through dietary changes, exercise 
and regular saunas. "Some damage can be reversed. Not all," he said. "We sweat 
out all sorts of chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
Recent research indicates that niacin supplements can cause liver damage, gout 
and elevated blood sugar in some people, but Steinman says that "Poison Planet" 
is explicit in saying that no one should take the vitamin without a doctor's 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Steinman's critics also question his statement that, "Most people today have no 
conception of true mental clarity. We have all been exposed to low-level 
chemical residues for so long that it is difficult to conceive of life without 
their neurotoxic effects." But Steinman maintains that consumers' exposure to 
low-levels of toxins does indeed affect the thought processes and cloud mental 
clarity. For example, he points to the known deleterious effects of lead 
poisoning in children. One such symptom is a slowed learning process. He said 
that by following his diet people will feel better both "mentally and 
physically." 
</P>
<P>
Steinman has gotten some support from the medical community. Janette D. 
Sherman, an Alexandria, Va. physician, was asked by the book's publishers to 
review "Poisoned Planet" once the scientific controversy ignited. She wrote a 
complimentary review stating that Steinman's over-all approach is valid, his 
methods clear and his sources documented. 
</P>
<P>
However, Arthur L. Craigmill, a UC Davis toxicologist who reviewed the book for 
a food trade group, skewered "Poison Planet." 
</P>
<P>
"Borrowing some of the favorite terms of the author, the book is 'saturated' 
with misinformation, 'laced' with misconceptions and 'soaked' in the selective 
presentation of outdated, unsubstantiated and anecdotal reports," Craigmill 
states. "There are many serious flaws in Steinman's approach." 
</P>
<P>
Steinman is undaunted, "I've said something simple, 'We have the right to 
control our exposure to toxic chemicals.' "

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: SAWTELLE RUSTIC: ISHI OR ISN'T HE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a while in the early '80s, I and most of my friends did a great deal of our 
serious eating at the tiny Japanese-French restaurant called Ishi's Grill, 
which was in that odd tangle of streets popularly known as the Bermuda 
Triangle, a couple miles west of Downtown. At first, Ishi's was that hungry 
man's dream, a lunch counter that served haute French cuisine at close to 
coffeeshop prices. The artist community adopted the restaurant. Later Ishi's 
became more of a regular restaurant, if an odd one -- it looked like the kind 
of place the Jetsons might visit on a romantic evening out -- and it remained 
the eccentrics' favorite Japanese-French place in town. 
</P>
<P>
Ishi's was the restaurant where a lot of people learned how to use sesame oil 
in a vinaigrette, how to arrange a salad to look like a Zen garden, and just 
how good slightly undercooked chicken could taste sparked with a bit of ginger. 
I remember the shock of spooning up a bit of what I thought was split-pea soup 
and tasting the clean, strong bite of fresh peas, overlaid with the briny scent 
of mussels. I suppose Ishi's was my standard spot for a second date: someplace 
romantic. 
</P>
<P>
When Ishi's closed four or five years ago, a lot of us tried hard to discover 
where its gifted chef, Masayuki Ishikawa, had moved his pots and pans. There 
were rumors of a big restaurant in the Valley, undone by brutal city building 
inspectors before it had a chance to open, and I think Ishikawa was supposed to 
develop the trans-Pacific menu at Noa Noa before that Beverly Hills restaurant 
hired Orange County hotel chefs instead. While he was away, styles in L.A. 
cooking changed, and where small mounds of food on great big plates had been 
hip, rustic cooking became the norm, and places that had previously served a 
lot of scallops in buerre blanc started serving a lot of scallops in tomato 
sauce instead. 
</P>
<P>
Which bring us to Sawtelle Kitchen, Ishikawa's new restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
A smallish place up the street from the strip malls and office buildings of the 
Sawtelle-Olympic corridor, Sawtelle Kitchen is tastefully rustic right down to 
the patinaed walls and the weathered hutches that hold the bowls for cafe au 
lait. The tables are covered with sheets of copper and little fiaschi hold 
homemade chile-flavored olive oil. The restaurant is identified from the street 
only by a tiny sign painted on the window in discreet Art Nouveau lettering. 
Recorded torch songs play softly. Customers are allowed to bring their own wine 
-- like Ishi's, the restaurant has no alcohol license -- and on a typical 
Wednesday night many of California's better Chardonnay vineyards are 
represented, along with trendy red varieties from the Rhone. There is no more 
charming restaurant in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But where Ishikawa's cuisine worked beautifully at Ishi's -- Japanese cooking 
and nouvelle cuisine have, after all, lightness, rigor, and the importance of 
presentation in common -- his take on rustic cooking is a bit weird. The world 
may not be ready for Japanese-Provencal-Italian cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
The salads are pretty much the old Ishi toss of greens, though the dressings 
are spiked now with exotic rustic things like lavender and balsamic vinegar. 
He's solved the pizza problem by using flour tortillas instead of crust, two of 
them glued together with a layer of melted cheese, and topped with delicious 
things such as proscuitto and mushrooms, duck sausage, or a modified puttanesca 
made with anchovies, capers and sliced hard-boiled eggs. They're pretty good in 
spite of themselves, much better than they were when the restaurant opened last 
spring; crisp and light and easy to eat. 
</P>
<P>
Many entrees are a different matter. Where at most new-rustic places you might 
expect something called bistecca to at least resemble the terrific grilled 
T-bones that go by that name in Florence and Siena, Ishikawa's version is a 
tough, thin rib-eye steak served a la pizzaiola, in an acrid, over-reduced 
tomato sauce dotted here and there with lumps of melted fontina cheese. A 
beautiful, crisp-skinned roast chicken was drowned in a salty brown sauce that 
obscured the flavor of the meat. A special of veal stew -- topped with a 
rock-hard crown of puff-pastry -- was overcooked and unpleasantly gamy, 
redeemed only by a few soft rounds of sweetly spiced veal sausage. 
</P>
<P>
Sawtelle Kitchen seems to do best where it is closest to refined French 
cooking. Broiled Norwegian salmon, while nondescript, is served on a bed of al 
dente pasta sauced with a textbook-perfect buerre blanc; sauteed sea bass, 
served with sort of a Tuscan-style ratatouille, is sweet and nicely 
undercooked. Soups have been wonderful, especially an intense carrot puree 
flavored with fresh clams. 
</P>
<P>
And though you should at all costs avoid the clammy sweet-potato tart, Ishi's 
most famous dessert, coffee Jell-O topped with rich cappuccino ice cream, is as 
good as ever. I'm not sure how it is on a second date, though . . . maybe a 
third date: something exotic. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawtelle Kitchen, 2024 Sawtelle Blvd., West Los Angeles, (213) 445-9288. Open 
Monday-Thursday, 6-9 p.m., Friday and Saturday 6-9:30 p.m. No alcohol; own wine 
OK. MasterCard, Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $30-$40.

THE CORNER BAR: STROLLING MARIACHIS, BLUE CORN CHIPS AND BEER! SALUD! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By APRIL JACKSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owners of Salud! Restaurant and Bar must have been toasting the planned 
success of their new establishment when they came up with this name. And, given 
the crowds that pack the place, there's every reason to party. 
</P>
<P>
Salud! is a great after-work pit stop. Drinks are well-stirred and the happy 
hour buffet table is well-stocked with spicy finger foods, including blue corn 
chips, buffalo wings and taquitos. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the customers come in to share a few drinks in the bar with 
their co-workers or to wait for the next show at a nearby movie theater 
complex. And they come to Salud! for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside, one can't help but feel like it's fiesta time. Papier-mache 
parrots and chintzy decorations hang from wooden rafters. On Tuesday nights 
mariachis stroll through the crowd and there are a taco bar and beer wells. The 
chatter level can get high, especially during the televised games, so be 
prepared to get a buzzing in the ears -- or escape onto the outdoor patio. 
</P>
<P>
A glass-enclosed patio faces the parking lot of the Holiday Health Spa. (Major 
jock watch alert!) Not that everyone who sits outside is there to catch a 
glimpse of the veritable hunks, and leotard-clad hunkettes, ambling to and from 
their cars. The patio is in front of the restaurant, so it's also a good spot 
to cruise the suits as they wander into the bar. Not that everyone at the bar 
is cruising. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Whatever you're toasting (or whomever you're chasing), Salud! is an upbeat 
place to escape office drudgery and get on with the serious business of 
partying. 
</P>
<P>
 Salud!, 17041 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. Open Mondays through Thursdays, 
11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays till midnight; Sundays, 4 to 11 
p.m. (714) 842-1194. APRIL JACKSON

"Fandango" (1985), directed by Kevin Reynolds, 91 minutes. Rated PG. Critics 
panned this, one of Kevin Costner's first movies, because they said it went 
nowhere.

<P>
But who says a movie has to go anywhere? This tale of five graduating Texas 
college students contemplating their futures is poignant and adventurous.

SANTA CLARITA RESIDENTS ASSAIL NEW DUMP PLANS; 
</P>
<P>
SANITATION: CRITICS SAY THE COUNTY IS IGNORING RECYCLING AND OTHER ALTERNATIVES 
BY PROPOSING LANDFILLS IN NEARBY CANYONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County sanitation officials are misguidedly planning new garbage 
dumps in the Santa Clarita Valley instead of encouraging recycling and other 
alternatives to landfills in scenic mountain canyons, valley residents charged 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
At a public hearing attended by more than 200 people, public officials and 
private citizens denounced the draft of an environmental impact report which 
said landfills could be safely operated in Towsley Canyon and Elsmere Canyon, 
both just outside the city of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita), in a letter read by aide Mark Matta, 
noted that a new study found that Towsley Canyon was located within a rich 
forest worthy of being a state park. The study by the Department of Parks and 
Recreation, released Tuesday, concluded that 8,000 acres of the Santa Susana 
Mountains west of Santa Clarita deserve protection because of their abundant 
and unusual plants and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
The draft environmental impact report prepared by the Los Angeles County 
Sanitation Districts, does not address the impact of a garbage dump on the 
canyon, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Sanitation Districts have billed the report as a comprehensive 
plan to reduce and dispose of garbage in the county. 
</P>
<P>
But Santa Clarita City Councilwoman Jill Klajic and other speakers said the 
report gives scant attention to recycling and innovative concepts in handling 
garbage, such as hauling it by rail to remote desert locations. "Instead, you 
rely on stale concepts and dangerous proposals," Klajic said. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night's meeting at the William S. Hart High School auditorium, the 
fifth public hearing on the draft, was scheduled after Santa Clarita officials 
and County Supervisor Mike Antonovich complained that the first four hearings 
were held outside the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental impact report, which could be completed early next year, also 
said landfills could be located in Blind Canyon above Chatsworth and in three 
canyons -- Mission, Rustic and Sullivan -- in the Santa Monica Mountains.

REFLECTIONS: THE DREAM OF WORKING FOR ONESELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Perry C. Riddle 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They called him Wild Bill Foster when he drove Detroit stock cars to victory at 
Saugus Speedway in the 1960s and 1970s. A racing accident helped him make the 
switch to running his own business. Now he's just plain Bill Foster, a most 
contented muffler man, owner of Bill's Muffler Service in Newhall. Foster, 56, 
and his wife, Marie, live in Agua Dulce. 
</P>
<P>
I joined the Navy on the 13th of September, and I was 18 on the 15th. I got 
three years exactly. So no senior year of high school. The service did me a lot 
of good. When I came out, I was much more mature than when I went in. They 
teach you how to become an adult. I liked the Navy. Got to travel. Went to 
Japan, Korea, Indochina, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
When we got back, I got stationed at Port Hueneme. San Fernando had a muffler 
shop. I went down to have some work done, louvers put in my hood, that's what 
it was. I asked him for a job, and he said, "Yeah, when you get out of the 
service I'll give you a job." 
</P>
<P>
The man I worked for, he was a good teacher. He taught me the muffler business, 
taught me how to do special welding, how to stock a shop, buy the parts that 
you need per week and places where to buy them. 
</P>
<P>
You've always got a dream you want your own business. You want to be 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
I had a car wreck. Fouled me up where I couldn't go to work for someone else 
any more. 
</P>
<P>
It was a stock car, Saugus Speedway. It was just terrible. Car went upside down 
and came down right on the roof. The roll bars were there, but when you hit 
this way your body stretches down through the seat belt, and my head hit just 
like that, pow! 
</P>
<P>
This doctor said, "You'll never work again. Take this medicine and don't exert 
yourself." So you know he was a quack. He had to be. 
</P>
<P>
Don't do what the doctor says, that's what you do. When you get a headache, go 
to sleep, don't take the medicine. 
</P>
<P>
This is what forced our hand. No boss is going to hire you from 8 to 12. The 
muffler shop when I opened was four hours, 8 o'clock till noon. So when I'd 
start feeling a headache, I could just lock up and go home. Sometimes sleep 
five minutes and it would go away, sometimes five hours, sometimes two days. In 
two years it was gone. 
</P>
<P>
And that's how it happened. And progress, you know, the town started to grow. I 
did everything. Mufflers, welding, mechanics, brakes, anything you needed we 
could do. Cars were easier to work on in those days, no computers. Spark plugs. 
That was it. It was mechanical, so you could change some parts and always make 
them work. 
</P>
<P>
I am going to enjoy myself when I get here at 8. I'm going to make me a pot of 
coffee. If you're here as a customer you can have some. I'm going to work on 
your car, and if not I'm going to tidy up. Shops like this get real dirty. 
</P>
<P>
If I don't get any customers at all, see that potbelly stove I'm working on, 
and I've got an ice box over here, an antique for her. I've got little projects 
that I can occupy my time. No money coming in, but that's business, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
The best part is being able to do what you want to do and enjoy it. I wonder if 
a doctor likes to go to work every day. If he's a good doctor, I would think he 
would, just to help people. 
</P>
<P>
I like to do muffler work. You can build something, create something out of 
metal, and make it sound nice, make it look nice. 
</P>
<P>
You have to like what you're doing. It's like your wife. If you don't like her, 
you're going to get divorced. If you like her, you're going to stay married 
forever. If you do it right and you enjoy doing it, why quit? I've raised three 
daughters, over 30 years, still got the same wife. 
</P>
<P>
I haven't had a paycheck in 30 years, and I don't miss it a bit. I can tell 
when business is slow and when business is really booming. I can tell by how 
tired I am when I go home. I don't need to count the money.

Grace C. MacInnes, a longtime resident of Van Nuys who taught elementary school 
classes in the San Fernando Valley for 22 years, has died in a Simi Valley 
nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
She was 67. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. MacInnes died Saturday of cancer, said her daughter-in-law, Carol 
MacInnes. 
</P>
<P>
Born June 22, 1923, in Newark, N.Y., she came to California in 1942 and later 
earned a bachelor's degree and teaching credential from San Fernando Valley 
State College -- now Cal State Northridge. She began teaching in 1966, working 
at several San Fernando Valley elementary schools, including Langdon Avenue 
School in Sepulveda. Mrs. MacInnes retired two years ago from Beachy Avenue 
School in Arleta, where she taught third grade. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by her son, Scott MacInnes of Simi Valley; a daughter, Bonnie 
MacInnes of San Francisco; mother, Anna Burzynski of Hollywood; brothers Jerry 
Burzynski of Hollywood and Jim Burzynski of Arkansas; sisters Dorothy Martino 
and Joyce Curtis of Hollywood; and four grandchildren. Her husband, John 
MacInnes, died in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral, with burial to follow, is planned at 1:30 p.m. Friday at the Old 
North Church at Forest Lawn Memorial-Park, 6300 Forest Lawn Drive, in the 
Hollywood Hills. Donations can be made to a memorial fund in Mrs. MacInnes' 
name at St. Mark's Presbyterian Church in Van Nuys.

STATE AUDITOR GENERAL FINDS '86-'88 ANTELOPE VALLEY FAIR LACKED FINANCIAL 
CONTROLS

The state auditor general Wednesday reported that a former manager of the 
Antelope Valley Fair operated it "in a very loose administrative fashion" and 
concealed the real balance sheet from the event's directors between 1986 and 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Specifically, the fair did not follow established budget and accounting 
requirements for managing fair resources," said Acting Auditor General Kurt R. 
Sjoberg, who added that the manager, C.W. Adams, "did not keep the board 
apprised of what was truly going on." 
</P>
<P>
Adams, who served as manager for four years, retired in April, 1989, after the 
financial irregularities first surfaced. He eventually was charged with 
embezzling public funds to build a $700 fence around his house and purchase 
$500 worth of tires for two private vehicles. Last March, Adams entered a plea 
of no contest to a misdemeanor grand theft charge. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, who until this summer handled promotions for a rodeo based in Marysville 
north of here, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Among the financial irregularities cited in the auditor general's report were: 
</P>
<P>
* The fair's expenditures in 1988 exceeded its allotments by about $842,000, 
apparently without approval of the board. 
</P>
<P>
* Many fair purchases in 1987 and 1988 were completed without purchase orders 
or with purchase orders that were incomplete or unauthorized. 
</P>
<P>
* Controls over revenues were weak. For example, more than $7,500 in horse-show 
fees from the 1985 fair were left in a desk drawer and not discovered until 
nine months after the fair ended. In another instance in 1987, $5,200 
disappeared from the fair and the theft was not discovered until two months 
later, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Sjoberg attached to the audit, Ralph V. Bozigian, president of 
the fair board, said internal controls have been instituted to correct the 
deficiencies spelled out in the report.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRE GUTS NIGHTCLUB, SNARLS ENCINO TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An arson fire gutted a vacant Encino nightclub Wednesday and snarled early 
morning commuter traffic on Ventura Boulevard for about an hour while 
firefighters battled the blaze, the Los Angeles Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 firefighters were called to the one-story building at 15910 Ventura 
Blvd. at 5:51 a.m., city Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries in the fire, which engulfed the empty 7,500-square-foot 
building. 
</P>
<P>
The building, which formerly housed the nightclub and restaurant called Danny's 
Apple, was scheduled to be demolished later this year and had been vacant for 
several years, officials said. No estimate on the loss was made because the 
building was to be demolished. 
</P>
<P>
Fire investigators determined that the cause of the fire, which started inside 
the building, was arson, but there were no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Westbound Ventura Boulevard was blocked to traffic in the area and eastbound 
traffic was backed up by the fire and cleanup.

<P>
Walt Williams scored seven of his 20 points in a 17-6 second-half run, and 
Garfield Smith made nine of 10 field goal attempts as Maryland beat USC, 72-59, 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland trailed, 42-40, before Matt Roe and Williams made consecutive 
three-point shots to put the Terrapins on top for good. 
</P>
<P>
With the score 50-46, Williams hit a layup, a dunk and a three-pointer to make 
it 57-48 with six minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
USC (1-1) never got closer than six points the rest of the way. Smith helped 
fend off the Trojans' last gasp, nailing a three-point play to give Maryland a 
62-53 lead with 4:33 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Smith scored 19 points and had 12 rebounds for Maryland (2-0) and Roe scored 
16. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Miner scored 22 points to lead the Trojans, who had opened their season 
at home with an easy victory over Chicago State. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland, getting six points from Smith and four from Williams, opened the game 
with a 10-2 run and never trailed in taking a 28-27 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Neither team played particularly well in the first half. The Terrapins shot 40% 
from the field and made two of nine free throws. USC was 13 for 33 (39%) from 
the field and just one of four at the line. Each team had 11 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Pack opened the second half with a pair of layups to give the Trojans a 
31-28 lead. There were six lead changes until Roe's three-pointer made it 
43-42.

<P>
The audience almost couldn't believe it. And even after the show was over, most 
of the full house at the Improv on Tuesday night still weren't convinced. 
</P>
<P>
Here was a comedian who didn't pounce on them. A comedian who was actually 
courteous and respectful, with no thoughts of shredding any of the 310 comedy 
fans. Once, he even apologized for missing someone's remark. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the world of Wayne Cotter, a 35-year-old stand-up comic who boasts 
one of the cleanest and most refreshing acts on the circuit. 
</P>
<P>
He wonders why his refrigerator door only has 10 egg holes "I have to eat two 
eggs immediately when I get home." 
</P>
<P>
Or why men would rather drive lost around the tip of South America than ask for 
directions -- until "God speaks to us personally." 
</P>
<P>
Wearing blue jeans, a purple David Letterman T-shirt and a black dinner jacket, 
Cotter was the picture of a friendly, unassuming comedian with a comforting 
voice that just wanted to reach out and touch someone, not ravage them. His 
voice is reminiscent of a young Jimmy Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Cotter's rare harsh words were reserved for airlines, and with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the comic flew from Los Angeles (where he lives) to Baltimore for a 
benefit that night before spending all day Tuesday flying to San Diego, then 
"fishtailing into the parking lot" for the Improv show with just the clothes on 
his back because the airlines lost his luggage. 
</P>
<P>
But he seemed more concerned that the airplane lacked a Row 13. "Does that make 
you feel good knowing the airline is superstitious? In the cabin they got 
rabbits feet all over." 
</P>
<P>
Nor is he fond of airlines that do things on the cheap. At the end of most 
trips, flight attendants wave and say, "Goodby. Goodby. So long." But on this 
one, particularly cheap airline he singled out, the flight attendants prefer: 
"Spare change? Spare change?" 
</P>
<P>
Cotter attributes a share of his success to Jay Leno, whom he calls a mentor. 
Besides their choice of material, that relationship is most noticeable in the 
comedians' paternalistic attitude toward their fans. It's a peaceful 
coexistence, a mutual respect. "I didn't come here to tear you from limb to 
limb," Cotter kept reminding the audience. 
</P>
<P>
He was about 5 years old when he got hooked on comedy, memorizing Mel Brooks' 
and Carl Reiner's 2,000-year-old man routine. He went to the University of 
Pennsylvania on a scholarship to study electrical engineering, doing stand-up 
on the side, before taking a job programming computers for four years, then 
turning to comedy full time. 
</P>
<P>
Cotter, who has been married to a painter for almost five years, spends 40 to 
45 weeks a year on the road. He has been on the Tonight Show six times during 
the past year and a half and the David Letterman show four times in the past 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
During another part of the 55-minute show, Cotter spoke about a frozen-egg 
custody battle and how a baby can now have five parents. A card company is 
going to jump on that, he says, making "some Sunday in July ovum donors' day: 
</P>
<P>
"I want to take this chance to say, / You have a way with your DNA." 
</P>
<P>
Like Leno, Cotter avoids blue material and takes an innocent glance at life in 
the slow lane, taking a look at anything from ringing phones to words, to 
hospital stays to pets. And odometers. Cotter got excited when his odometer was 
at 3-3-3-3-8 and ready to turn all 3's. But he got so excited he drove into a 
ditch, where he sat until a state trooper asked if there was anything he could 
do to help: "Yeah. Push me another two-tenths of a mile." 
</P>
<P>
Warming up the crowd for Cotter was Dave Dugan, another veteran of the comedy 
club circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking with a clear, deep voice, Dugan said he is pleased that he has a roof 
over his head these days, albeit at a picnic shelter, but he is "getting tired 
of all the unexpected company on the weekends." 
</P>
<P>
And he couldn't believe he was almost kept off a plane because he had a pair of 
short, blunt scissors in his bag. "We're going to Cuba," he said sarcastically, 
"or someone's getting a bad haircut." 
</P>
<P>
Dugan's act is similar to Cotter's in subject matter -- both focus on the life 
of the common man -- but they overlap only minimally. He provided an ideal 
segue into Cotter's act and did a good job himself, including a skit about 
Capt. Jerry, the DJ pilot.

Cafe Break: A Parisian truck driver transporting paintings worth more than $5 
million stopped at a cafe, leaving the ignition keys on the dashboard. 
</P>
<P>
Thieves drove off with the loot Wednesday, police said. Fifty canvases by 
Watteau, Fragonard, Rubens and others from Flemish, Dutch and French schools 
were on board the truck when the driver stopped just before midnight. When he 
emerged, he found that the truck had vanished with its contents. The artworks 
were being transported from Paris, where they had been on display, to 
Strasbourg in eastern France, where they were to have been auctioned today.

Hindu-Stone: A priest who conducted the secret wedding of British rocker Mick 
Jagger and actress-model Jerry Hall on the island of Bali last week said the 
couple had converted to Hinduism. Antara news agency Wednesday quoted Hindu 
priest Ida Pedanda Sukawati as saying they had signed a letter stating their 
commitment to Hinduism during the ceremony a week ago. CLAUDIA PUIG

Mother and Child Reunion: Burger King, which recently placed an ad in several 
hundred newspapers trumpeting its support of "traditional American values on 
television, especially the importance of family" and proclaimed it would 
support only programs that reflected those values, was among the commercial 
sponsors of CBS' "The Stranger Within," a violent television movie that aired 
Tuesday night. The thriller features Rick Schroder as a psychopath who claims 
to be Kate Jackson's long-lost kidnaped son. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-age Schroder appears to be an earnest, loving son, then emerges as a 
deranged killer. Some of the movie's scenes include the Schroder character 
shooting at the family dog, drowning his "mother's" boyfriend under the ice, 
attempting to bury her and a policeman alive after he's just about done them 
in. Schroder, who's beaten and verbally abused Jackson, comes at her with a 
hammer after she's shot him; another policeman finally puts him to rest. Burger 
King said the movie had been reviewed by its advertising agencies and marketing 
staff and "found to be within the guidelines the company has set forth," 
according to spokesman Michael Evans. CLAUDIA PUIG

STAGE WATCH: ARTS FIGURES DEBATE MERITS OF A CITY-OWNED LATC; 
</P>
<P>
AMONG THE ISSUES RAISED ARE THE POTENTIAL DANGER OF GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ART 
AND WHETHER THE LOS ANGELES THEATRE CENTER COULD BE USED BY OTHER ART FORMS. 
</P>

Should the City of Los Angeles spend $4.5 million to buy the Los Angeles 
Theatre Center, and between $150,000 and $2 million annually to operate it? 
Should the city's Cultural Affairs Department take over as administrator of the 
building? 
</P>
<P>
And if all this comes to pass, would your favorite arts group (other than LATC) 
be able to use the building alongside the current resident company? 
</P>
<P>
These questions are on many minds this week in the wake of a report that a city 
takeover will be recommended by the commission that was charged with drawing up 
a blueprint for the future of the downtown theater complex. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's detailed conclusions have not been released, pending further 
negotiations among interested parties -- talks that are presumably covering the 
delicate subject of how all of this would be financed. 
</P>
<P>
Even Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who normally opposes further city funding of 
LATC, declined to comment until he sees and digests the report. 
</P>
<P>
However, several leading arts figures agreed to discuss their reaction to the 
idea of a city-owned and operated LATC and on whether they might want to be 
included in such an institution. 
</P>
<P>
"Any theater that has that kind of city support has my wholehearted support," 
said choreographer Bella Lewitzky, whose own Dance Gallery has been stymied in 
its efforts to raise enough money to begin construction on its downtown site. 
</P>
<P>
"But I would now like it to extend to the dance world," she continued. "It 
doesn't extend easily to dance." She said LATC's Tom Bradley Theatre "would be 
an ideal space" for her company's intimate "In the Works" series. But most of 
the facility's theaters lack the wings, the overhead space and the proscenium 
possibilities that larger dance presentations need. 
</P>
<P>
Danielle Shapiro, the artistic director of Pacific Dance Ensemble, presented a 
dance series, Generator Eight, at LATC last spring. She hopes dance would be 
included in the scenario for the theater's future, she said, "but my main 
concern is that the Cultural Affairs Dept. would administer the complex. My 
instinct says that it seems like too much power in one place, since they 
administer the L.A. (Arts) Endowment. 
</P>
<P>
The Center Theatre Group's Gordon Davidson said he told the LATC commission 
"that they must find a way to remove the burden of (operating) the building 
from LATC. It's not inappropriate for the city to buy it. But the idea that it 
would become the responsibility of the Cultural Affairs Department has to be 
looked at seriously. What are the consequences?" 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see LATC diminished," he added, "unless (the reduction in available 
slots for LATC shows) helps them by allowing them to do more concentrated 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Because "multiculturalism" is a hot buzzword in Los Angeles arts circles, and 
because one of LATC's claims to fame is its emphasis on multiculturalism, some 
of the city's smaller minority-oriented theaters might be likely to receive 
invitations to perform at a city-operated LATC. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a chance to get in, that would be great," said East West Players 
artistic director Nobu McCarthy. "But at this point I don't like to speculate. 
I'm not saying, 'Oh, good -- another space for us.' " 
</P>
<P>
Carmen Zapata, artistic director of the Bilingual Foundation of the Arts, which 
runs a 99-seat theater, was more restrained. "I would have to consult my board, 
and I would do a survey of my audience, to see how they would feel about 
attending theater in that area," she said. However, she added, "I'm feeling the 
pressure of seams splitting. We're turning away people at the door. We're in 
search of a bigger space." 
</P>
<P>
Zapata said she didn't like the idea of groups other than LATC (which would 
remain as the primary tenant, according to the plan) becoming ensconced in the 
facility. "Different theaters should use it at different times of the year." 
</P>
<P>
But the Odyssey Theatre's Ron Sossi -- while prefacing his remarks with "I have 
to see the details before I have an intelligent opinion" -- had the opposite 
reaction. He suggested that LATC could share the facility with two other 
long-term tenants, "like the Ft. Mason complex in San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said, "if it's 'this month, this group; next month, that group' 
-- there is no way to promote." 
</P>
<P>
He said he would be "disinclined" to take his own Westside-based group to the 
building, especially if it weren't subsidized for a long engagement. "I don't 
have a great deal of faith in the downtown renaissance. The problem in pulling 
audiences to that neighborhood still exists." 
</P>
<P>
Sossi also expressed concern about the possible role of the Cultural Affairs 
Department. He said he wants to know if the agency would control artistic 
decisions or whether it would operate "sheerly as a landlord."

ROGER BINGHAM PROBES THE SCIENCE OF THE BRAIN ON 'INSIDE INFORMATION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Mander once wrote a wonderfully incendiary book titled "Four Arguments 
for the Elimination of Television." But even Mander might have second thoughts 
after seeing a piece of television like "Inside Information" (tonight at 8 on 
Channel 28). 
</P>
<P>
Once again, KCET's Mr. Wizard, Roger Bingham, has made science -- in this case, 
the science of the brain -- knowable, tangible, appealing. Perhaps television 
can do this better than any other medium: reason enough not to eliminate it. 
</P>
<P>
That's especially the case with this probing, engaging look at how the brain 
works. Bingham begins with crude models, like the loom or needlepoint, to 
suggest brain function, and then works up to more involved ones -- bird flocks, 
beehives -- as the report tracks how neurological research is now suggesting a 
brain of great subtlety and sophistication. Throughout "Inside Information," 
the viewer is given a lively visual sense of this intensely complicated story. 
</P>
<P>
Medium becomes message: The act of watching this program and absorbing its 
information becomes a replication of the kind of brain process described by 
researchers such as Caltech's Carver Mead. If you're stumped by sections like 
the one explaining the latest research into "parallel computation" (in which 
individual brain sections work separately and together as a network), then 
that's just an example of how the brain isn't a perfect machine. It's a 
survival mechanism borne out of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
It is also offering us, as UC San Diego's V.S. Ramachandran puts it, "a 
convenient fiction, a tentative reality" -- a conclusion arrived at by both 
advanced science and post-modern art. This is worth thinking about, while 
wondering if biologist Richard Dawkins' obvious love for a post-human 
cybernetic "civilization" isn't pushing things too far. TV can provide brain 
food. ROBERT KOEHLER

'ORANGES ARE NOT THE ONLY FRUIT': AN ENGLISH GIRL'S ENGROSSING ODYSSEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A beguiling BBC drama, "Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit" (airing twice tonight, 
at 6 and 10, on Arts &amp; Entertainment), unfolds like a cinematic, 
first-person novel, in this case the odyssey of a girl growing up in a 
fanatical evangelical environment in northern England. 
</P>
<P>
What rewards the viewer hearty enough to stick through the overlong three-hour 
production (including some 10 commercial breaks) are the sense of place, the 
weathered faces of the Christian zealots (a gaggle of aging women mostly), and 
the luminous protagonist with the orange hair and wondrous eyes (Emily Aston as 
the child and Charlotte Coleman as the adolescent). 
</P>
<P>
This debut of an all-female production team (producer Phillippa Giles, director 
Beeban Kidron, and writer Jeanette Winterson, who adapted the film from her 
autobiographical novel) is impressive in capturing the novelist's first-person 
viewpoint, which is difficult to do on film. You observe this pinched world and 
these hatchet faces through the unwavering eyes of the young girl. 
</P>
<P>
The second hour is the most riveting, with the teen-age girl's tumultuous 
discovery of the flesh in a lesbian love affair, her denunciation in front of 
the pulpit, a harrowing exorcism performed by a charismatic pastor, and her 
ultimate break from the church to hit the road selling ice cream out of a van. 
</P>
<P>
Geraldine McEwan is memorably fierce and also loving in her crazed way as the 
girl's spiritually obsessed mother. The heroine's two girlfriends (Cathryn 
Bradshaw and Barbara Hicks) are exquisite casting, and the protagonist's 
affairs with both leap from puppy love to sexual discovery with economy and 
touching sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing pat about the story. 
</P>
<P>
The tone is never merely satiric or mean-spirited, and the film grows into a 
reflection of a young woman's looming acceptance as she prepares to go off to 
Oxford with one last visit with Mum and her now rather affectionate-looking 
band of believers. 
</P>
<P>
One caution, besides the length, is the British accents. Occasionally, you 
can't make out what people are saying, but don't worry about it. 
</P>
<P>
It's small talk, it's life, and you don't need to hear everything. RAY LOYND

BEST BETS: HISTORIC NOTE TO HOLIDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Get in tune with the Christmas spirit Sunday at a concert of holiday music 
featuring a historic pipe organ. The event begins at 4 p.m. in the Piru United 
Methodist Church, 227 Center St. 
</P>
<P>
This is a rare opportunity for the public to hear the second-oldest pipe organ 
in the state. Built in 1864 by William A. Johnson of Massachusetts, the 
instrument was originally installed in the Eastside Presbyterian Church in 
Stockton. In 1934, the organ was bought by the Warring family of Piru for the 
local Methodist church. 
</P>
<P>
Organ builder Michael McNeil of Lompoc, who did restoration work on the organ 
during the 1970s, has called it "a priceless historical instrument." Organist 
Roberta Palmer of Bardsdale has chosen a program of familiar seasonal melodies 
and Christmas carols to showcase the special timbre of the instrument. 
Admission is free and refreshments will be served after the concert. 
</P>
<P>
Both the organ and the church are county historical landmarks, located about a 
mile from California 126. Take Main Street north from the highway, and go west 
one block on Center Street. For information, call 524-2697.

LIGHT OF DAY; 
</P>

AFTERNOONS ARE GOLDEN AT THE VENTURA HARBOR EATERY, BUT A NIGHT THERE HAD THAT 
DESERTED FEELING.

Itook my son, Teddy, to Lorenzoni's for dinner the other night. Teddy's a good 
person to take out to eat because, while he takes his food very seriously, he 
always leaves plenty on his plate for me. 
</P>
<P>
It was dark when we got down to Ventura Harbor, so we couldn't enjoy the view 
much; we couldn't even see it. The whole complex of shops and restaurants was 
deserted and a bit forlorn. I felt as if we had shown up at a party after 
everyone else had gone home. 
</P>
<P>
But Lorenzoni's was a pleasant oasis -- albeit a small one. The food 
preparation area seemed larger than the dining area, and we couldn't help 
having the impression that most people buy their food here and take it 
elsewhere to eat. 
</P>
<P>
Teddy and I shared a lovely Mexican corn chowder -- full of fresh kernels of 
corn and shreds of red pepper -- in a hot and satisfying broth. Lorenzoni's is 
big on melted cheese, and a lot of their sandwiches are "melts." The tuna melt 
came with the reassuring guarantee that it was "dolphin free," so I felt 
obliged to order it. A generous portion of tuna, covered with melted Cheddar 
cheese, tasted good but struck me as more of a casserole than a sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
The arrival of boxes of fresh-baked bread as we were eating our meal made it 
clear that our timing was off; sure enough, both our sandwiches were made on 
somewhat stale bread. There was nothing stale, however, about the delicious 
pasta salad -- a perfect blend of pasta shells, tomatoes, olives, zucchini, 
green peppers and fresh, sweet tarragon. I loved it. I also loved the muffins, 
which could have passed anywhere as classy desserts. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of this place can really bake. There is a whole case filled with 
freshly baked sweets that you won't want to miss. They go well with the 
coffees, which can be ordered in a myriad of flavors, from the ornate espresso 
machine. Even the sugars came in exotic guises. 
</P>
<P>
I figured that Lorenzoni's would be more cheerful in the light of day, and I 
went back with my friend Elizabeth just to prove that my hunch was correct. In 
the sunlight, the harbor, with its blue and white boats and glistening green 
ocean, was enchanting. Off in the distance were the golden hills of Ventura. If 
this was a tourist spot, I wanted to be a tourist. 
</P>
<P>
I ordered scrambled eggs with avocado slices, served on a fat chunk of 
sourdough bread. Although the dish was somewhat plain, I was perfectly happy . 
. . until Elizabeth slipped me a sliver of her sandwich. The Lombardo special 
also came on sourdough bread, but there its resemblance to what I was eating 
ended. Chopped marinated olives and sun-dried tomatoes were covered by a fat 
slice of fresh tomato and then a blanket of melted mozzarella. I looked 
greedily at the huge half sandwich still left on Elizabeth's plate, but I was 
doomed to disappointment. Elizabeth is the one person I know who hates to give 
away any of the food on her plate. I stared longingly at the Lombardo; the only 
thing Elizabeth offered me were her happy comments as she ate. Where was Teddy 
when I needed him? 
</P>
<P>
I had to console myself with a snickerdoodle -- a sweet, perfectly delicious, 
chewy sugar cookie with a light dusting of cinnamon. I didn't offer Elizabeth 
one bite. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzoni's, 1575 Spinnaker Drive (in the Ventura Harbor), (805) 658-2228. 
Breakfast, lunch and dinner, 9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. everyday. No alcoholic

A GALLERY IN SANTA PAULA WILL FEATURE 500 ORIGINAL ANIMATION CELS AT AFFORDABLE 
PRICES.

<P>
If you just heard about the popularity of cartoon artwork and want to see 
what's up, Doc, tune in to the animation exhibit "The Magic World of 'TOONS" 
opening Sunday at the John Nichols Gallery in Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
The show, which runs through January, will feature 500 original animation cels 
from the past three decades. Unlike the $13,000 recently paid at a New York 
auction for a cel and background setup from a 1947 Bugs Bunny cartoon, the 
artwork for sale at the Nichols gallery will be $25 to $200. A few older pieces 
will go for more, such as a print of a demon from the "Night on Bald Mountain" 
sequence in Disney's "Fantasia." Owner and show curator Jeff Garcia is pricing 
that print at $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, a local collector of animation art who suggested the show to John 
Nichols a year ago, said he wants to help the public realize it is a legitimate 
and uniquely American art form. 
</P>
<P>
Animation began in the '20s with the film "Gertie the Dinosaur," a print of 
which will be shown during the exhibition. Warner Bros. and Disney quickly 
entered the field, and its popularity has been legendary. 
</P>
<P>
The term "cel" derives from cellulose, the material on which cartoons were 
originally painted. The animation studios switched to acetate in 1960 after 
discovering that cellulose was flammable and tended to yellow and shrink over 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The show will include cels of the Road Runner, Roger Rabbit and the Mutant 
Ninja bunch, as well as two original drawings by master animator Bill Tytle, 
who, Garcia said, is considered the Michelangelo of the field. Although the 
cels are the more colorful and popular collector items, the true work of art is 
the drawing the cel is copied from. 
</P>
<P>
The drawings, which are the first step in producing a cartoon, were originally 
hand-traced onto the front of the cellulose and then painted onto the back. In 
the '60s, Disney and Xerox developed a process that chemically transferred the 
images onto the acetate, although the painting is still done by hand. 
</P>
<P>
In the early days of animation, cels were not considered valuable. Because 
cellulose was expensive, the images were washed off and the material reused and 
eventually discarded. Therefore a limited supply of vintage cels is available, 
which, Garcia said, is a factor in the skyrocketing prices. Another factor is 
the characters' popularity. "Disney always tends to be pricey," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
A demonstration of how cels are made will be held Sunday from 3 to 4 p.m. at 
the studio of Judi Cassell, an animation production company, across the street 
from the Nichols gallery at 971 E. Main St. A reception will follow at the 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols, a longtime resident of Santa Paula, started out as an elementary 
school teacher. At that time, his interest in photography was limited to 
collecting and taking pictures in his spare time. Then seven years ago he 
rented two rooms for a photo gallery that he opened on Friday evenings and 
Saturday afternoons. The good response and pleasure he got from this work made 
him decide four years ago to open a full-time business. 
</P>
<P>
"It came to me I enjoyed being a Main Street merchant and gallery owner. I knew 
I would also have to make enough money to pay the bills, and I wanted a 
business which would be compatible with the gallery. I have always been 
interested in new and used books, antiques and magazines, so I opened the front 
half of the shop as Mr. Nichols." The back portion, which is dedicated to 
displaying artwork, is called John Nichols Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols is a serious collector and promoter of a field many people don't 
consider serious art. His is one of only 10 to 15 private photography galleries 
in California, which he said allows him the advantage of having a large pool of 
talent from which to draw. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols' interests extend beyond photography. He has built sets and run the 
light board for the Santa Paula Theatre Company where his wife, Leslie, is 
acting in the current production of "Company." He has also served as stage

<P>
Ten years ago, Joe Cardella was a frustrated artist living in Santa Barbara, 
trying to find expression in what he perceived to be a conservative, closed art 
scene. He found it with a monthly limited-edition publication bearing the name 
Art/Life. 
</P>
<P>
The portfolio featured graphic art, prints, poetry, Xerox art and collages, all 
bound into an attractive package available at a modest price. Cardella could 
not have predicted the longevity or scope of his project. It was, it turned 
out, an idea with legs. 
</P>
<P>
At present, 200 copies of Art/Life are produced 11 times a year (every month 
except January) and distributed internationally -- the biggest drop points 
being New York City and Tokyo. Most of the contributing artists are 
California-based, but work comes from Germany -- which has the second largest 
contingent of Art/Lifers -- and other corners of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized the publication would have the potential to do something, but I 
didn't know what form it would take," Cardella said last week during a break 
from assembling the 10th anniversary issue of Art/Life. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that one of the main reasons Art/Life continued and flourished 
was because the need for it already existed. I merely filled the need. I didn't 
create the need." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Art/Life is in the midst of its "10th anniversary world tour," with 
separate gallery shows in New York, Milan, Tokyo, Kassel, Germany, and, in our 
neighborhood, at Ventura's Momentum Gallery (34 N. Palm St.) and Westmont 
College (955 La Paz Road) in Montecito. 
</P>
<P>
And Cardella is now living in Ventura, not in Santa Barbara, although moving 
was a bit more complicated than a 30-mile drive down U.S. 101. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, after several years of getting Art/Life off the ground and around the 
world, Cardella returned to Connecticut, his birthplace. He had graduated with 
a degree in design from Syracuse University before heading west and thought 
that it was time to go back. 
</P>
<P>
"Mistakenly, I thought it would be helpful to Art/Life to be closer to New York 
City, the art center and publishing center of the world," Cardella said. "But I 
was there and was still doing everything through the mail, so it seemed 
pointless. I preferred California. We had been out here long enough so that we 
enjoyed this lifestyle and climate." 
</P>
<P>
So after three years, Cardella returned to Southern California with Barbara 
Smeltzer -- "my life partner as well as my Art/Life partner. She's helped me a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, Art/Life has come a long way from the Xerox machine. It has 
also come a long way from two-dimensional images on paper. Perusing past 
Art/Life issues on display at Westmont, as well as pieces hung on the gallery 
walls, it's apparent that the variety and ambition of the art has evolved over 
the years. Within each bulging issue, you are liable to find such "found 
objects" as chopsticks, paint brushes, rubber gloves, even patches of 
Astroturf. The canvas ranges from paper to metal leaf to transparent plastic to 
fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
The publications force artists to think relatively small -- to work to the 
scale of its 8 1/2-by 11-inch format. "It takes some people a while to get used 
to," Cardella said of the format. "And other people just can't grasp the 
concept. But once you work within that framework, there are really no 
limitations. You can use scaled images of larger pieces and you can also do 
conceptual pieces which are all-encompassing and that deal with global 
concepts. It's just a matter of becoming facile with the medium." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the aesthetic temperament of the Art/Life art is gentle, 
often conveying soft-edged absurdity and soothing abstraction. Noticeably 
lacking are strident political messages or abrasive imagery meant to provoke. 
In other words, Art/Life is by no means a guerrilla art enterprise or an 
underground art tract. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably has something to do with the people we attract," Cardella said of 
his monthly. "I generally don't encourage things that are real downers. The 
purpose of what we're doing is not to depress people. It's to enlighten people. 
I prefer things that are primarily well done and that also make positive 
statements." 
</P>
<P>
Art/Life is as vital as ever, and Cardella believes that "returning to 
California was pivotal because people still have more freedom out here with 
their ideas." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
The Art/Life exhibit will be displayed at the Momentum Gallery, 34 N. Palm St., 
in the Livery Building, downtown Ventura, from Sunday to Jan. 15. Gallery hours 
are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturdays. There will be a 
reception from 5 to 7 p.m. Sunday. Call 653-0828. The exhibit is being shown in 
the Reynolds Gallery at Westmont College, 955 La Paz Road, Montecito, through 
Dec. 16. Reynolds Gallery is open 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. weekdays. There will be a 
reception from 4 to 6 p.m. Saturday. Call 565-6162.

A DELIVERY COMPANY EXPECTS TO BE EXTRA BUSY THIS HOLIDAY SEASON, BRINGING JOY 
TO KIDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
So it's beginning to look a lot like a hectic holiday season? Well, just 
imagine what it's like for the people who work at a delivery service this time 
of year. 
</P>
<P>
"Our business increases about 25% from October to December," said Steve 
Keihner, president of Westwind Express Courier, which has its corporate offices 
in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Our drivers drive about 350 miles per day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As if Westwind Express employees weren't busy enough, from Saturday to Dec. 23 
the company is offering to go to businesses throughout the county and pick up 
toys to be distributed to local charities at no cost to giver or receiver. 
</P>
<P>
"I hired two full-time drivers to drive around all day long to pick up these 
toys. There could be thousands of them," Keihner said. 
</P>
<P>
When he was handing out posters about the offer, a receptionist in one office 
said her daughter had died two months ago of leukemia. "All her friends and a 
lot of people from the community had bought stuffed animals for her. They want 
to donate the dolls." 
</P>
<P>
As unclear as the future may be, one thing is certain: The new year will roll 
around. And no one is happier about that than photographer Tom Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because a major portion of his income comes from the sale of calendars. 
Kelly, who recently opened a studio in Ventura, is the guy who sets up the 
scenes and takes the pictures for the popular antique doll calendars put out by 
Workman Publishing. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing calendars is like rolling dice," he said. Puppies, for example, he said. 
"Are they going to be able to sell 50,000 copies? Fifteen years ago calendars 
weren't as big as they are today. The business is now in the billions of 
dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly has done calendars featuring other subjects, but he said his doll 
calendars are his most popular. "I think that's because dolls look back at 
you," he said. "They are a little bit alive." 
</P>
<P>
Not only do the dolls have a human quality to them, Kelly said, but with the 
right -- or wrong -- lighting they can look a little eerie, especially the 
dolls with the teeth. (Check out October's 1990 model). 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said he never gets frightened by the dolls but he does get tired of them. 
"After you do this many calendars you could sometimes just take a doll and 
throw it against the wall." 
</P>
<P>
So what kind of fancy calendar does Kelly use for himself? "I really don't use 
one. I just use the plain white kind," he said. "What do you think, that I have 
big cheesecake calendars on my wall?" 
</P>
<P>
By the way, Kelly's father, the late Tom Sr., who had his own photography 
studio in Hollywood in the 1940s, was a photographer of the stars. In fact, his 
nude photo of Marilyn Monroe ended up as the first centerfold for Playboy 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Saxophonist Gerald Albright will perform at the Dorill B. Wright Center on 
Sunday on the first stop of a tour promoting his third Atlantic Records album, 
"Dream Come True." It's kind of a hometown performance for Albright, who is a 
resident of Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it's true. A saxophonist from Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I'm from Los Angeles. I've been a resident of Moorpark for about a 
year," Albright said. "My family was expanding so I needed more square 
footage."

CHILDREN CAN PEEK AT THE PAST AT AN ANTIQUE TOY EXHIBIT. A FESTIVAL WITH A 
HAYRIDE IS ALSO PLANNED.

<P>
If you're looking for a calmer, gentler Christmas season for your children, 
there are a few excursions that will soften some of the holiday glitz and 
provide some meaningful fun. 
</P>
<P>
Two displays of antique toys are going up for the holidays. If children think 
toys and batteries have always gone together, they will find out how 
yesterday's children managed to do without whiz-bang gadgetry. 
</P>
<P>
Another option is a ranch-style Christmas festival, complete with a hayride. 
</P>
<P>
The toy exhibit at the Ventura County Museum of History and Art opens Dec. 3. 
One of the most intriguing items is a pair of roller skates dating back to the 
1890s. The skates were carved from wood with leather straps around the toes and 
heels. Each skate has four little wooden wheels inset in the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no sidewalks back then, so we don't know where they were used," 
said Jeanne Brown, a museum docent who is setting up the exhibit. "Maybe they 
used them in the house." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the toys have been donated to the museum over the years by area 
residents. Brown is setting them up around a seasonal theme, with Christmas 
stockings hanging from a fireplace mantle. Life-size boy and girl mannequins 
will be wearing Victorian-era holiday clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the toys are elegant. An ornate picture book about Cinderella comes 
with a set of puzzle blocks that can be put together six ways, corresponding to 
the pictures in the book. In their day, probably in the 1870s, they sold for 25 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
A Victorian doll sits majestically in an upholstered wicker doll carriage 
decorated with elaborate scrollwork. Another doll, made in Germany at the turn 
of the century, has a leather body with knees constructed to bend and real hair 
on her head. 
</P>
<P>
Some toys reflect everyday home life. A miniature cast iron stove sold in the 
early 1900s is displayed with cast iron kettles, pots and a skillet on its six 
burners. A miniature working sewing machine also will be shown. The six-inch 
metal machine was made in California about 1920. 
</P>
<P>
There's much more -- cowboy and Indian figures, an old Uncle Wiggly board game, 
marbles, a game of Old Maid with cards showing the old maid at home alone 
sipping tea and Henry Holler getting a licking with a switch. 
</P>
<P>
At the Albinger Archeological Museum, children will see more of a hands-on 
exhibit. Opening Dec. 2, the display includes old phonographs -- one from 1906 
and an 1878 replica. They will see working antique music boxes dating back to 
1880 and 1895, and a replica of an 1860 zoetrope, an early motion picture 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
A collection of Victorian dolls, including some from France, will be on 
display. Children also will see handmade folk toys. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the toys are from private collections in the area, and some are on loan 
from local merchants. 
</P>
<P>
For some outdoor fun, businessman Mel Cummings is again hosting his Cummings 
Ranch Christmas Festival to benefit the community outreach program at St. 
John's Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The festival will be Dec. 1 and 2, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the ranch, three 
miles up Wheeler Canyon Road, which is off Foothill Road near Santa Paula. Last 
year about 750 people attended the fund raiser for the program. 
</P>
<P>
Children can take a hayride around the ranch and see cows, horses, pigs, sheep 
and fields of oats. Christmas ornaments and handmade crafts will be on sale, 
along with homemade pies, jelly and other snacks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<P>
You must remember this: poise, patter and business cards. 
</P>
<P>
Especially the business cards. You wedge them into your wallet until you feel 
like you're sitting on a phone book. Then you straighten your tie and venture 
into the heart of commerce: your first Professional Network Seminar. 
</P>
<P>
You have evidently dozed through the arrival of this trend. For years now, 
scores of groups around Southern California, and a few in Ventura County, have 
looked upon networking as an activity too valuable to be left to chance or 
informality. For them, networking can be a sole cause for congregation. And on 
this particular Tuesday in Ventura, it is cause for breakfast at Marie 
Callender's. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty broad, but most people are professional business people and 
service-oriented," Denise Kulha Picard, acting president of Professional 
Network Seminar, had explained on the phone. "It runs the gamut from an 
attorney to an auto mechanic." 
</P>
<P>
And of course there's the hypno-numero-therapist -- more about him later. The 
structure of the meetings is the same each week. Each networker offers a 
30-second "commercial" for his or her business. They catch up on leads that 
could enhance colleagues' businesses. And each week, two members speak at 
greater length. Most meetings last about an hour, leaving networkers plenty of 
time to reach the office by 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
It's 7:20 a.m. now. Picard, who sells gifts for Anne McGilvray &amp; Co. and 
sells Mary Kay cosmetics on the side, is at the head of a long table. You're 
off to the side, across from Ron Cameron, one of group's co-founders three 
years ago. You could say Cameron spends most of his time looking for fights; he 
is director of the Dispute Resolution Center on East Main Street in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"The public doesn't really know that there are opportunities for resolution 
other than court," says Cameron. "So I take every opportunity to speak before 
clubs and organizations about concepts in mediation." 
</P>
<P>
On your left is Pete Baptiste, stockbroker. 
</P>
<P>
"In the business I'm in, I just cast a real wide net," Baptiste says, and 
reeled off a list of involvements from Rotary to Sunday churchgoing. "Pretty 
soon you start seeing the same people at different things, and you start 
building your identity in the community." 
</P>
<P>
And what about your identity? You are a newspaper reporter -- that is, a bearer 
of bad tidings, a depositor of ink on people's fingers, a killer of trees. For 
purposes of salesmanship, you resolve to stress the value of your colleagues 
Dear Abby and Ann Landers, to point out the vigor of your recycling efforts. 
Maybe you'll even throw in that the district attorney says nice things about 
you. 
</P>
<P>
"At this time," says Picard at the head of the table, "we might as well start 
with our 30-second commercials." 
</P>
<P>
Around the table, poise and patter. The business cards are already taken care 
of -- filed alphabetically in a circulating recipe box. The network gives every 
member an exclusive in his or her field -- one attorney, one chiropractor, one 
mechanic, and so on. The five-member board reviews candidates for membership, 
and those chosen pay $30 to start and then $25 monthly. 
</P>
<P>
You hear commercials from: Linda Chenot, owner of Creations Unlimited in 
Ventura, who is offering tiny Christmas trees to customers at her furniture and 
design store on East Main Street; Bill Harrel, a desktop publisher and 
free-lance writer; Edward T. Buckle, attorney at law; and Laurie M. Beisel, 
travel consultant for Club Tours &amp; Travel. 
</P>
<P>
"United is having a special until the end of November," Beisel notes. "So if 
you need any help getting to see loved ones Thanksgiving week, please give me a 
call." 
</P>
<P>
Then more commercials. Ed Boughton of Don L. Carlton Realtors reports that 
business in Ventura is up in the last week. Bill Shorts, whose insurance agency 
is part of the Farmers group, takes his turn, as does clothing consultant 
Marcena Randall Brook. And then it's you. 
</P>
<P>
You confuse Ann Landers with Erma Bombeck, but no one notices. You forget 
recycling entirely. You remember the district attorney, but from the glassy 
eyes around the table, it seems clear that his endorsement doesn't pack much 
punch around here. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial ball keeps rolling. Picard shows off a new gift novelty item -- 
a bright green snap-on bracelet that retails for 75 cents. "If you know anyone 
who's in the business of selling to 8- to 12-year-olds," she says, "please let 
me know." 
</P>
<P>
She is followed by Ed Brough, a slight man in a gray cardigan, who has come in 
late. 
</P>
<P>
"Ed Brough, hypno-numero-therapist," he says. "The day has proved itself 
already, and I don't like it. . . . You look at my car and you'll see why I'm 
late." Brough, based in Ojai, offers advice based on numerology, either 
one-on-one or as entertainment at parties. 
</P>
<P>
After Fran Jacobs makes his pitch for Lord Moving and Storage -- "for a moving 
experience, give me a call" -- Ed Buckle steps over to chat privately with 
Brough for a moment. Later, Brough will make plans for car repairs with 
mechanic Brad Minkhoff, another networker. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Baptiste steps up as one of the day's featured speakers -- "I started 
investing when I was 15 years old" -- and then there's a quick session of 
lead-exchanging. Tales are told of business cards offered, referrals given, 
patronage pondered. Those without leads are required to contribute a quarter to 
the kitty -- which leads you to a white, or rather green, lie. 
</P>
<P>
You are, you report, seriously considering purchase of Picard's snap-on 
bracelet. More polite chuckles, and the kitty bypasses you. 
</P>
<P>
But then Gail Cohen, an account representative for Alphagraphix, puts you to 
shame. She is the second featured speaker of the day, and right away she hands 
out stationery. Recycled stationery. With a variety of discounts and new 
products, she says, Alphagraphix is promoting recycling. 
</P>
<P>
"Some larger corporations, like Patagonia, use only recycled paper. It's part 
of the image they want to project," she says. Among some other, unnamed, firms 
she finds more reluctance. At one such company, Cohen says, she was told "we'd 
like to be conscious of the environment, but it's not worth it if it costs us 
another penny a page." 
</P>
<P>
Around the table there is scoffing at the penny-pinching paper purchaser and

MUSIC: T.S.O.L.; 
</P>
<P>
OF LOST LABELS; 
</P>
<P>
INSPIRED BY THE GERMS, JOE WOOD FORMED HIS OWN BAND, WHICH HAS BEEN THROUGH SIX 
RECORD LABELS, 10 ALBUMS AND SOME STYLE CHANGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
T.S.O.L. spelled backwards is "lost," as in lost their record label. 
</P>
<P>
That's nothing new for this hard-rocking outfit that has 10 albums on six 
different labels, but is now temporarily unsigned. That situation probably 
won't last too long since T.S.O.L. (originally known as True Sounds of Liberty) 
is one of the most popular L.A. bands. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we were on Enigma," vocalist-guitarist Joe Wood said in a recent phone 
interview. "But that doesn't matter anymore -- it's all over for them. They're 
out of business. A lot of labels have expressed interest in signing us; we're 
just waiting for the best deal." 
</P>
<P>
Wood is clearly unconcerned. Rock 'n' roll is what T.S.O.L. has been doing for 
a number of years and, judging from the size of the crowds, their future seems 
secure. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to become a musician when I saw The Germs play at The Masque in L.A. 
in 1978 or 1979. I figured if they can do it, I can, too. I started my own band 
the very next day." 
</P>
<P>
For the first 10 years, T.S.O.L. was a punk band. Today, the members are these 
rock 'n' roll leather guys, a sort of AC/DC with a touch of the blues. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the band used to be more image-conscious, but not any more," Wood 
said. "We're just a rock 'n' roll band. All those stupid categories, who cares? 
Before, people thought we were punkers; now we're supposed to be metal. People 
like to put bands into categories -- and we're in a metal box now, but we're 
really nothing but a rock 'n' roll band . . . when we play, we just get up and 
do a nice sweaty set." 
</P>
<P>
Wood has this loud, gritty voice that sounds as though he's inflicting grievous 
damage to his throat; perhaps he's just earning enough money for a down payment 
on a voice box when he finally does blow a hole in his neck from too much rock 
'n' roll. Come to think of it, Wood sounds a lot like the lead screamer in 
AC/DC, only a bit mellower. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done five T.S.O.L. albums in six years," Wood said. "Our latest album, 
'Strange Love,' is doing very well -- it's our best yet." 
</P>
<P>
T.S.O.L. crowds can be a little -- what's the word -- rambunctious. The slam 
pit will be slamming -- that's when young males crash into each other really 
hard, and girls had better be tough or watch out. It's not at all like the 
Charleston contest in "It's a Wonderful Life" when members of the opposite sex 
actually danced together. 
</P>
<P>
A flak jacket would be appropriate for this show. William James wrote about the 
"Moral Equivalent of War"; this could be the "Musical Equivalent of War." 
</P>
<P>
"People's expectations of what they think we should be doing can be pretty bad 
sometimes," Wood said. "We've been around for a long time, and I do at least 
one song off every album that I've been on. I don't do stuff that the other 
singer did. That's his stuff, and I don't do his stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not just my attitude, but how the whole band feels. Anyway, when we 
play, people call out songs for us to do. If I did one, then I'd have to do 
another, and it would never end. Some of these people just come to have a 
miserable time. Some of these people just haven't grown with the band -- it's 
not 1981 anymore. I think music is the purest, most direct, most expressive 
form of communication. We just pick up our guitars and play. That's all there 
is to it. Whatever comes out, comes out." 
</P>
<P>
T.S.O.L. will play Tuesday night at the Carnaval Club in Santa Barbara, a venue 
they frequent. "We like it up there," Wood said. "This will just be a one-shot 
deal -- we'll play, then drive home to L.A. after the gig. We've already done 
three U.S. tours this year; then we try to play a couple times a month around 
Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
The future for the band is pretty easy to predict: more hard-edged rock 'n' 
roll, more leather and more albums. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to open for ZZ Top or AC/DC and do a national tour," Wood said. "For 
now, we just want to reach as many people as possible with our music, but never 
compromise our principles. I want to just write what I want to. We're doing OK, 
better than the Rams -- they're hurtin'." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
T.S.O.L will be performing on Tuesday at 9 p.m. at the Carnaval Club, 634 State 
St., Santa Barbara. This is a show for 18-year-olds and older. Tickets are $12. 
For more information, call (805) 965-8422.

BUDGET CUTS AND APATHY HELP FOLD NEWSPAPERS AT MANY HIGH SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After six decades of reporting on student life at Hamilton High School in West 
Los Angeles, The Federalist quietly died this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The demise of the school newspaper was not unexpected. Once a weekly newspaper, 
The Federalist had labored against a variety of obstacles over the last decade 
and was published only five times in its final year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone the way of the (Los Angeles) Herald Examiner," said George Hedges, 
journalism adviser for 17 years. "Not enough students were interested. We came 
out so infrequently that by the time we got the newspapers out, the news was so 
old and stale nobody cared. And we were always in the red." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, high school newspapers in urban school districts from Los Angeles 
to New York are facing the same kinds of problems. Once the chroniclers of prep 
football games, homecoming parades and senior proms, they are succumbing to 
student apathy, declining writing skills and minuscule budgets. 
</P>
<P>
A generation ago, nearly every Los Angeles-area high school produced a weekly 
newspaper. Now only a handful of weeklies survive among the 49 high schools in 
the Los Angeles Unified School District. In New York City, most high school 
"newspapers" are actually quarterly newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
"The hurdles get higher and higher," said Alison Rittger, president of the 
Southern California Journalism Educators Assn. "And if you lost your paper, the 
chances are your school wouldn't care," said the journalism adviser at Narbonne 
High School in Harbor City. 
</P>
<P>
At Hamilton High School, for example, Hedges said a final affront was a 20% cut 
in the Federalist's $2,500 budget. Even worse, only two students had signed up 
to work on this year's newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
It was all a far cry from Hedges' first days as adviser in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to come out every two weeks," he said. "Then it became a monthly. Then 
it came out every two months, then every three months." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the urban school papers that have survived publish only intermittently 
and continue to shrink; photocopied, letter-sized sheets have replaced the 
once-standard broad sheet at several schools. Photo layouts have all but 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the best writers are shying away from journalism classes. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly, there's a lack of interest on the part of the students," said 
Linda Puntney, executive secretary of the Kansas-based National Journalism 
Education Assn. "We're not nearly the reading society we used to be. 
</P>
<P>
"The other big factor is the financial crunch in education programs," Puntney 
continued. "And with a soft economy, it's going to be hard for papers to sell 
advertising. I can see the situation worsening. It's pretty frightening." 
</P>
<P>
Still, high school publications seem to be flourishing in most middle-class and 
suburban communities. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems today that the suburban schools are the ones that are shining," said 
Tom Rolnicki, executive director of the National Scholastic Press Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Union High School is among the more fortunate schools, for example. Its 
paper, the High Tide, publishes eight pages every two weeks on four Macintosh 
computers and a laser printer, and is funded by a $1,000 grant from the student 
activities budget plus advertising sales, said adviser Mitch Ziegler. 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles, however, is struggling to print a 
monthly newsletter. In the 1930s and '40s, the school published a daily 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Journalism teacher Tom Liebengood works against a daunting set of obstacles to 
guide 17 students in the production of The Manual Press. 
</P>
<P>
Writers are hard to find at the South-Central Los Angeles high school, where 
students' reading scores ranked among the lowest in the state, Liebengood said. 
And like many student publications, The Manual Press does not have a 
typewriter; students must line up to borrow a single computer in the graphic 
arts class. 
</P>
<P>
Year-round schedules in some Los Angeles schools mean the entire newspaper 
staff is missing for months at a time. At Belmont High School, the staff was on 
vacation for the homecoming football game and the senior prom. 
</P>
<P>
With an irregular publishing schedule, Belmont journalism adviser Dentler 
Erdman said he has trouble persuading his students to meet deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles school district officials acknowledge that some school newspapers 
have faced difficulties in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"I am aware that some schools do not have publications, for a variety of 
reasons," said Richard Browning, director of administrative support services 
for senior high schools. "It's not uncommon that you can't find anyone to be 
the adviser. Another problem is that it's expensive." 
</P>
<P>
At most Los Angeles high schools, newspapers are paid for with student body 
funds, controlled in part by the student government and used for a variety of 
school activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Schools don't have money to fund all the activities they want," Browning said. 
"If the basketball team wants new uniforms, if you need new choir robes, are 
you going to buy those things or put out a newspaper?" 
</P>
<P>
In some school districts, journalism classes no longer count toward admission 
to the University of California system. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers in California and other states also complain that some school 
counselors have transformed journalism classes into "dumping grounds," where 
they can enroll students who fail to qualify for more advanced and rigorous 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the ideal system in the old days, the school newspapers were one of the 
most desirable things to work on in the school," said Keith Hefner, publisher 
of New Youth Connections, a student-produced newspaper in New York City. 
"(Students) put it on their college applications. That's not true anymore." 
</P>
<P>
With the decline of newspapers at inner-city schools, several independent 
publications such as LA Youth and New Youth Connections have stepped in to fill 
the void. 
</P>
<P>
After learning that Lincoln Park High School in northern Chicago had not 
published a newspaper in years, 17-year-old Sarah Karp joined New Expressions, 
an independent Chicago monthly. 
</P>
<P>
Karp and a group of students have plans to revive Lincoln Park's school 
newspaper. She dreams of creating a publication that will take a critical look 
at a recently approved plan to restructure Chicago public schools. 
</P>
<P>
At inner-city schools where they still publish regularly, many young writers 
are trying to revolutionize student journalism, using their newspapers to 
critically examine campus life. They report on the disappearance of driver 
training and other programs and feature interviews with the student victims of 
drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the staff at Pioneer High School in Whittier published four pages on 
homosexuality and homophobia. 
</P>
<P>
When rumors began circulating about the firing of a track and field coach at 
Narbonne High School, reporter Luis Orona dogged school administrators two 
weeks until he got confirmation of the story. The Green &amp; Gold, a weekly 
newspaper considered among the best in Los Angeles, has won many journalism 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
According to several journalism teachers in Southern California and elsewhere, 
censorship has become a problem at some schools. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that newspapers will cast their schools in a negative light, some 
principals have attempted to censor articles about such problems as gang 
violence, grimy bathrooms and teen pregnancy, the journalism teachers said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are principals in this district who reserve the right of veto, which is 
totally against (Los Angeles school) board policy," said one journalism adviser 
who asked not to be identified. "But they don't feel what they have done should 
be held up to scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
Browning, of the Los Angeles school district, said he believes most principals 
follow district policies protecting the editorial freedom of student 
publications. He said he knew of no instances in which a principal censored a 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
School district officials and journalism teachers in Los Angeles and elsewhere 
point out that not all the news about high school papers is bad. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, I think journalism at many schools is getting stronger," said 
Jennie Bashara, president of the San Diego Journalism Education Assn. and 
adviser at Montgomery High School near the Mexican border. "The quality of the 
writing and reporting is improving." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Montgomery High, where 65% of the students are Latino, started 
a second, Spanish-language newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, some schools have begun reviving their publications. Inglewood High 
School re-established its newspaper this year after an absence of several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
At Locke High School in South Los Angeles, the newspaper had been dead so long 
that no one could remember the exact name, said newly appointed journalism 
adviser Suzanne Mustacich. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, a teacher retrieved a back issue of the Saints' Courier and the 
resurrected newspaper published its first issue this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The student editor of the Saints' Courier, Tiffany Dirks, speaks with passion 
about the newspaper's duty to keep Locke High informed. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to change something here," she continued. "I want the students to be 
able to know what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers John D. Cramer, Shawn Hubler and Marc Lacey contributed to 
this story.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEFENSE LAWYER SUGGESTS WITNESS FRAMED 
DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lawyer for one of seven Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies on trial for 
alleged money-skimming suggested Wednesday that the prosecution's chief witness 
framed his former deputies to hide his own thefts of drug money. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Jay Lichtman told a federal court jury that former Sheriff's Sgt. 
Robert R. Sobel lied when he testified that the deputies shared in the thefts. 
</P>
<P>
And Lichtman said Sobel may even have planted "bait money" from an FBI sting on 
two deputies to implicate them. 
</P>
<P>
Lichtman said his client, Deputy Ronald E. Daub, and another defendant, Deputy 
John C. Dickenson, may have been victimized by Sobel, who has already pleaded 
guilty to the money-skimming charge. 
</P>
<P>
In their closing statements Wednesday, other defense attorneys also attacked 
Sobel's credibility, noting that he has admitted beating suspects, stealing 
money and committing perjury while he was a narcotics sergeant.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CANCER RISK REPORTED FOR NEIGHBORS OF 
LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Gabriel Valley residents living near the controversial BKK Corp. landfill 
face a risk of contracting cancer that is slightly above the U.S. average, 
according to a recently completed health-risk assessment by USC and the state 
Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
However, researchers also concluded that the cancer rate for those living 
around the West Covina landfill was essentially the same as for Los Angeles 
County overall. 
</P>
<P>
The studies involved 100,000 residents who lived around the landfill from 1972 
to 1982, when it was one of the state's principal toxic waste disposal sites. 
</P>
<P>
The heightened risk translates into an additional 2 people out of 100,000 who 
are likely to develop cancer as a result of the presence of vinyl chloride, a 
carcinogen present in the air, soil and water around the landfill, which is now 
closed to toxic waste. 
</P>
<P>
About 33,000 people in the study area would be expected to contract cancer 
regardless of the landfill's proximity, researchers said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BERNSON BACKS PROPOSAL FOR 'SUPER' TRANSIT 
CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson urged county officials Wednesday to 
convert the old Chatsworth railroad station site into "an expanded super 
transit center" where commuters could catch trains, taxis and airport shuttles 
in a complex equipped with restaurants, child care centers and other services. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson introduced a motion asking that the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission help private developers construct a retail complex on the 13-acre 
parcel on Devonshire Street. 
</P>
<P>
The commission agreed in October to buy 177 miles of Southern Pacific right of 
way and related properties -- including the Chatsworth station site for $450 
million -- to make the properties the backbone of a commuter train system that 
would carry passengers from the San Fernando Valley and elsewhere to downtown 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson's motion was referred to the transportation committee.

LONG DRUG TRIAL IN LAST STAGE; 
</P>
<P>
NARCOTICS: MONEY-LAUNDERING CASE HAS SET RECORD AS LONGEST CRIMINAL TRIAL IN 
L.A. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE. IT IS NEARLY READY TO GO TO JURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
A record-setting trial of more than seven months, in which nine defendants are 
accused of conspiring to launder about $350 million in drug money through a 
business in Los Angeles' downtown jewelry district, appeared nearly ready to go 
to the jury Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The case, which grew out of a lengthy federal investigation code-named 
"Operation Polar Cap," has set the record for the longest criminal trial in Los 
Angeles' federal courthouse, according to a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection began last April 11 and testimony from nearly 100 witnesses 
began on May 22. 
</P>
<P>
It is expected the government will conclude its final rebuttal argument today 
so that U.S. District Judge William D. Keller can instruct jurors before they 
start deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
In his rebuttal, Assistant U.S. Atty. Russell Hayman told jurors Wednesday it 
was not necessary to produce evidence of drug deals to prove that the millions 
of dollars in small bills that flowed through the Andonian Bros. Manufacturing 
Co. represented drug profits. 
</P>
<P>
Of the nine defendants, including the brothers Nazareth and Vahe Andonian, 
Hayman said: "It wasn't their job to handle drugs. It was their job to handle 
receipts." 
</P>
<P>
Hayman and co-prosecutor Assistant U.S. Atty. Jean Kawahara argued that the 
defendants conspired to participate in an international drug-money laundering 
scheme which was concealed through purchases of large amounts of gold bullion. 
They alleged that the cash was returned to South American drug lords to 
underwrite their operations. 
</P>
<P>
In an affidavit filed with the court, Drug Enforcement Administration Agent 
Michael Orton estimated that between 1986 and February, 1989, when the 
defendants were arrested, the Andonian firm and another downtown jewelry 
company which is the object of a separate trial, Ropex Corp., "deposited in 
excess of $1 billion in cash into their accounts at Los Angeles area banks." 
</P>
<P>
The government has alleged that the individual who orchestrated the money 
laundering scheme was Raul Vivas, 38, a gold dealer from Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
Vivas' attorney, Martin L. Schmukler, told jurors Wednesday that his client 
"was held in very high regard" in the precious metals business and was "a man 
of integrity."

DOG SHOOTING PROMPTS ANIMAL TRAINING FOR DEPUTIES; 
</P>
<P>
PETS: SESSIONS WILL BEGIN NEXT YEAR AS PART OF A LARGER PROGRAM TO FAMILIARIZE 
OFFICERS WITH WEST HOLLYWOOD.

In the wake of the recent shooting of a homeless man's dog by a Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputy, the city of West Hollywood and the sheriff's station 
there have agreed to provide the city's 130 deputies and officers with special 
training in the handling of animals. 
</P>
<P>
The training sessions will start after Jan. 1 as part of a larger program 
designed to familiarize deputies with the West Hollywood community, said Nancy 
Greenstein, assistant to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
"The training program was already in the works, but after the shooting happened 
we decided to add it into the program," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A deputy's shooting Sunday of Baby -- a mixed-breed dog belonging to Robert 
Uderos, a 36-year-old homeless man -- has sparked an outcry among animal-rights 
activists, who accused the deputy of cruelty to animals. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Public Safety Commission, which reviews complaints about deputy 
misconduct, plans to take testimony in the incident when it meets Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred in a parking lot in the 600 block of La Peer Drive, where 
Uderos and another homeless man had been sleeping. When the deputy ordered the 
two to leave, the dog charged, according to sheriff's officials. The officer 
drew his gun and fired three times, hitting the dog twice. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, animal-rights activists disputed the sheriff's report that the 
dog provoked the shooting. "The dog never charged the deputy," said Bill Dyer. 
"He just positioned himself between Uderos and the deputy." 
</P>
<P>
The dog was rushed to a nearby animal hospital where it died. Both Uderos and 
his friend, Arnold Morales, were arrested after the shooting. Morales was 
charged with loitering and also was being held on an unrelated drug charge. 
Uderos was charged with a form of trespassing and has been released.

D.A. DECIDES NOT TO CHARGE ROB PILATUS OF MILLI VANILLI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Citing insufficient evidence, prosecutors refused to file sexual battery 
charges Wednesday against Rob Pilatus of the lip-syncing, scandal-ridden pop 
duo Milli Vanilli. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that I question her credibility," Deputy Dist. Atty. Lynn Reed said 
after interviewing the 25-year-old woman involved. "But the conduct described 
did not rise to the level of a sexual assault or battery that we could 
successfully prosecute." 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, sexual battery is the touching of a person's private parts 
while he or she is restrained, against his or her will, for sexual arousal, 
excluding rape. Reed declined to specify what the woman claimed Pilatus had 
done, but his attorney said no bondage was alleged. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, whose name was not released, had met Pilatus on Monday night at the 
China Club, a Hollywood nightspot, and later went home with the star, his 
partner and another friend. The couple were "moving toward a romantic encounter 
of some sort," said Mike Botula, a spokesman for the district attorney's 
office, when the woman decided to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Pilatus, 24, was arrested just before dawn Tuesday when Los Angeles police 
responded to a 911 emergency telephone call from a taxi dispatcher who heard 
arguing and shouting in the background when someone at the pop star's Bel-Air 
home called for a cab. 
</P>
<P>
He was released later that day after posting $10,000 bail and paying nearly 
$500 for outstanding traffic violations. 
</P>
<P>
"There was 'probable cause' for arresting him on suspicion of a felony based on 
what the woman told the officer," said Lt. Ron Hall, commanding officer of the 
West Los Angeles detectives unit. "But the district attorney felt there was not 
enough evidence to get a conviction. It was a one-on-one situation, with no 
corroborating evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Hall said it is unlikely the case will be referred to the city attorney for 
prosecution as a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not his month," said Pilatus' attorney, Erroll Stambler. He was 
referring to Pilatus being stripped of the 1989 Grammy Award won with partner 
Fab Morvan for the best-selling album "Girl You Know It's True," after the two 
admitted that they had not sung a note on the album or at any of their "live" 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that they also misled fans with their catchy name: Milli Vanilli 
doesn't mean "positive energy" -- or anything -- in Turkish, as they had once 
claimed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate for him, with the recent publicity, that this has come 
about," Stambler said. "He's not at fault. He has done absolutely nothing 
wrong."

OFFICIALS TELL UNIVERSITY TO FIND NEW SITE; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THEY WILL MEET MONDAY WITH THE HEAD OF THE JAPANESE SCHOOL, WHICH 
PLANS TO EXPAND ON LAND COVETED FOR A SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS PARK HEADQUARTERS.

<P>
State and federal parks officials have urged top administrators of a Japanese 
university in the Santa Monica Mountains to come to a meeting Monday prepared 
to discuss alternative sites for a proposed campus expansion. 
</P>
<P>
That request came in a letter in which the parks officials vow to eventually 
acquire land now slated for the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
The park authorities say they have been frustrated for months in their attempts 
to suggest other locations for the proposed 5,000-student campus of Soka 
University Los Angeles because the college's administrators have refused to 
furnish a list of their needs and desires. 
</P>
<P>
Without such a list, park officials say, it will be all too easy for the 
university to reject any site offered. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very leery about pointing to sites on a map and then having them say, 
'Oh no, that one doesn't work, that one doesn't work,' " said Joseph T. 
Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. "We 
want to establish an objective criteria and then let the world decide." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Soka University is nestled in a valley in Calabasas in an unspoiled 
grove of oaks that is home to several species of wildlife. The school provides 
short-term English courses for rotating groups of about 80 students from the 
main campus in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring campus officials announced plans to expand to 5,000 students by the 
year 2015 and in August disclosed that they had doubled the school's land 
holdings to nearly 600 acres. That alarmed the National Park Service and the 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which have long viewed the property as the 
ideal site for a Santa Monica Mountains park headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
University administrators have said they have no interest in a land trade 
because the Calabasas site meets their needs perfectly and they have no 
intention of moving. County property records showed the school may have spent 
up to $56 million purchasing the land around the school. School officials say 
they spent at least $1 million more renovating dilapidated buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Soka spokesman Jeff Ourvan said Wednesday that the school's general director, 
Hiroshi Okayasu, is coming from Tokyo to attend the meeting with parks 
officials Monday. Okayasu met recently with his board of directors in Japan to 
discuss a possible land swap and will announce the board's position on Monday, 
Ourvan said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, his position has been that he's personally opposed to the idea -- 
he's skeptical," Ourvan said. "We definitely want to establish a university 
here." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Okayasu dated Nov. 16, David E. Gackenbach, superintendent of 
the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Areas, said the park agencies 
"intend to acquire" the Soka land. Gackenbach also said that the agencies will 
help the university identify alternative surplus government properties. 
</P>
<P>
The parks agencies have spent $15,000 to hire an environmental consulting firm 
to do preliminary studies of the Soka property, asking it to look at the impact 
of traffic and additional buildings on wildlife areas and streams. Edmiston, of 
the conservancy, said that too is an effort to persuade university 
administrators that they should consider taking the land trade proposal 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"If it proves there are some serious problems, then we could . . . say, 'Here's 
some of the problems you guys are going to face. Doesn't it make sense for us 
to join hands and go look for alternative sites together?' " he said.

RELATIVES OF HOSTAGES GET A BRIEFING, ENCOURAGEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILIES: 35 OF KIN GATHER AT SESSION IN LOS ANGELES. THEY GET MORE EMOTIONAL 
SUPPORT THAN INFORMATION.

Her married name is Davis. A native of Kuwait, she was working in a computer 
firm when she met the American who would become her husband. After the Iraqi 
tanks rolled in Aug. 2, she was able to get out with their two young sons. Her 
husband remains in hiding in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband has not seen the sun in four months," said Davis, who asked that 
her first name not be used. If he is discovered, she said, he would likely 
become one of Saddam Hussein's "human shields" and the Arab friends who are 
hiding him could face execution. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was among about 35 people who gathered at a Westwood hotel Wednesday for 
a private briefing on the Persian Gulf crisis by State Department officials. 
All have relatives trapped in Iraq and Kuwait and are wondering when and how 
their shared trauma might end. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Tamposi, assistant secretary of state for consular affairs, said the 
briefing was established to help officials understand "the unique personal 
burdens" experienced by family members. When possible, officials said, they 
would offer assistance. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department spokesman emphasized that the meetings "give families a 
chance to meet each other, to network (with) each other." 
</P>
<P>
Participants said they largely avoided sensitive discussions concerning 
military options. Some who are married to Kuwaiti nationals or have American 
relatives in hiding in Kuwait spoke of the need to drive Hussein's troops out. 
But others, whose loved ones are being used as human shields at key military 
targets, urged patience. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles meeting was the eighth in a series of nine briefings organized 
by the State Department. The consular affairs office's Kuwait Task Force, 
established to aid families of Americans held in Kuwait and Iraq, had 
previously briefed families in Washington, Boston, Chicago, Orlando, Fla., and 
twice in Houston. Another briefing is scheduled for today in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"It was for emotional support" rather than for imparting a lot of information 
to the families, said Jan Chandler of La Canada Flintridge, whose brother, 
Kevin Bazner, is being held as a human shield in Iraq. "It gave us a chance to 
see the faces of people whose voices we've heard over the telephone the last 
few months," she said of the briefing. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles meeting, Chandler said, was largely devoid of the expressions 
of anger that marked some earlier briefings. "People seemed to want to do what 
they could do to make things better," she said. 
</P>
<P>
There was wide agreement, participants said, for an effort to persuade the 
Voice of America to devote more air time to messages from home for hostages, 
and interest was strong in improving delivery of "care packages" via the Red 
Cross.

HAWTHORNE COUNCIL TO CONSIDER EXPANSION OF REDEVELOPMENT AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that could open the door for redevelopment, the Hawthorne City 
Council on Monday agreed to consider an ordinance that would declare as 
blighted 254 acres of land along Imperial Highway and nearby areas. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1 to consider the ordinance despite the objections of 
dozens of property owners and tenants who say their homes and businesses are 
not blighted as defined by state law. The area includes 210 single-family homes 
and 527 apartment units. 
</P>
<P>
A state-mandated citizens' group that has been studying the neighborhood for 
more than a year generally agreed that Imperial Highway needs help. But the 
25-member Project Area Committee recommended the exclusion of nine acres of 
land from the proposed redevelopment area, saying the 46 homes and 111 
apartment units there are well-kept and unnecessary for the city's 
redevelopment plans. 
</P>
<P>
The council nevertheless voted to consider the Hawthorne Redevelopment Agency's 
recommendations, which include the nine acres south of Imperial Highway between 
Gale and Grevillea avenues. Councilwoman Ginny Lambert voted against the 
proposal, saying she believes the neighborhood can be revitalized "without 
going so deeply into the residential area." 
</P>
<P>
Although substantial portions of land along Imperial Highway have been 
earmarked for redevelopment since 1984, Hawthorne planning officials say they 
need the additional 254 acres to make the area more attractive to developers. 
</P>
<P>
"Without giving (the area) some additional depth, the only thing you can build 
there is what's there or something like what's there," Bud Cormier, Hawthorne's 
assistant redevelopment director, said in an interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Highway, which runs parallel to a portion of the Century Freeway that 
is still to be constructed, has been economically depressed for years and has 
one of the city's highest crime rates. The area mostly contains small retail 
shops, motels and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Several people who spoke at Monday's meeting said they agreed that Imperial 
Highway needs to be upgraded, but they said redevelopment is not the only 
answer and should be considered a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Chiappe, a homeowner in the affected area who served on the Project Area 
Committee, said the city's "complete lack of attention" to the area north of 
Imperial Highway was to blame for the blight, rather than the residents. 
</P>
<P>
Chiappe, who was a liaison between the panel and Spanish-speaking residents, 
also complained that Spanish speakers were not adequately informed about the 
proposal and "don't really understand the implications" of it. 
</P>
<P>
However, city officials, who sent out notices in both Spanish and English and 
provided a translator for all public meetings on the proposal, said they did 
everything they could to ensure Spanish speakers were fully informed. 
</P>
<P>
Albert J. Cadis, who lives in Hawthorne and operates a business there, told the 
council he came to the meeting "to condemn the city of Hawthorne for going 
forward with a project when 500 to 600 people have objected to it." If the 
proposal was put before the citizens of Hawthorne, he added, "it would be voted 
down." 
</P>
<P>
His remarks referred to a public hearing two weeks earlier that drew about 500 
property owners and tenants, so many that the council was forced to move the 
hearing from City Hall to the Hawthorne Memorial Center. 
</P>
<P>
At that meeting, more than 20 people spoke against the redevelopment agency's 
recommendations, and 21 written statements opposing the plan were submitted. 
</P>
<P>
Many speakers said they feared that inclusion in a redevelopment area would 
drive down the value of their properties and would make it more difficult for 
them to obtain loans and to sell. Others expressed fear of losing their homes 
under eminent domain proceedings to make room for redevelopment projects. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth McKaig, a widow and senior citizen who lives on 116th Street in the 
proposed redevelopment area, said her home was built with extra-wide doors and 
lowered fixtures to accommodate her wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never leave this house by choice," McKaig said during the public 
hearing. "Finding another house would be a great burden for me. . . . I don't 
see how I could ever be adequately compensated for having to make such a move." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne resident Martin Trouillon said the inclusion in the redevelopment 
proposal of a former county area that was annexed by the city in 1975 was "a 
slap in the face to those residents" who voted in favor of annexation. 
</P>
<P>
At both the public hearing and Monday's meeting, city officials told the 
property owners that being included in a redevelopment area does not 
automatically give the city the right to take away their homes, and they said 
that several more public hearings would take place before any redevelopment 
projects are approved. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, a city can declare an area to be blighted if it is physically 
or economically depressed and if redevelopment would be in the interest of the 
health, safety and general welfare of the residents there. Existing businesses 
and homeowners must be given first crack at redeveloping a depressed area. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Hawthorne declared more than 960 acres of land throughout the city to 
be blighted. 
</P>
<P>
Current plans in that redevelopment area include a 36-acre office and retail 
project known as the Oceangate Business Park on the southeast corner of the 
intersection of the San Diego Freeway and Rosecrans Avenue, and a 27-acre 
housing, retail and office development complex commonly known as the Cloverleaf 
project on the southwest corner of the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
About three years ago, the city's redevelopment agency proposed amending the 
redevelopment area to include more land. In addition to the extra 254 acres, 
the proposal under consideration by the council would extend the redevelopment 
agency's authority to use eminent domain from 1996 until 2002. It also would 
increase the amount of bonded indebtedness the agency could incur to finance 
redevelopment, from $100 million to $665 million. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would boost the maximum amount of tax increment revenue that the 
agency can receive during the 35-year life of the redevelopment plan, from $200 
million to $1.9 billion. Tax increment revenue is the difference between the 
revenue generated by a property before its inclusion in a redevelopment plan 
and the revenue generated from improvements to that property during the life of 
the plan.

FINAL HURDLE CLEARED FOR BUILDING HOTEL ON STRAND; 
</P>
<P>
HERMOSA BEACH: DEVELOPER DAVID GREENWOOD IS GIVEN A BUILDING PERMIT FOR A 
172-ROOM STRUCTURE, ENDING SEVEN YEARS OF WRANGLING. THE GROUNDBREAKING IS 
EXPECTED WITHIN SIX MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Brentwood developer who for seven years has sought to build a hotel on The 
Strand in Hermosa Beach received his building permit this week, clearing the 
way for construction of one of the most debated projects in the city's history. 
</P>
<P>
David Greenwood said he will break ground within the next six months on the 
$35-million beachfront hotel, which will take up the 1300 block of The Strand 
where the defunct Strand Bathhouse now stands. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for a four-story, 172-room structure draped with greenery and 
surrounded by palm trees. Staffers at the California Coastal Commission, which 
approved the project in March, called it a "Holiday Inn-style" project. 
</P>
<P>
But Greenwood said the hotel will be comparable to upscale inns in La Jolla and 
Laguna Beach, with "an atmosphere of casual elegance" and an ocean-view 
restaurant that will run the length of the block. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Bathhouse, the project will displace several businesses, 
including the well-known La Playita cafe. Susan Cohen, who owns La Playita with 
her husband, Harold, said the restaurant will be relocated a short distance 
away, to the site of the former Cafe Christopher on 14th Street. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed. We don't think the hotel really belongs there," Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents, including community activist Parker Herriott, have complained 
that despite the hotel's size, city officials never gave them an opportunity to 
protest the project. Because the hotel will be built to code on private 
commercial property, no public hearing was required under the municipal code. 
</P>
<P>
But most beach-area merchants and restaurateurs said they are delighted the 
hotel will be built, and that the boarded-up Bathhouse will finally be razed. 
</P>
<P>
"Some don't want the tourists it would bring, but I want the business. I'd like 
the tourists," said Shar Franklin, manager of Good Stuff On The Strand, a cafe 
across the street from the bathhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Added Leslie Newton, a lawyer who practices and lives in Hermosa Beach and who 
owns Loreto Plaza on Pier Avenue: "I think it will have a very positive effect 
on downtown. It'll offer amenities to visitors and residents alike. And it will 
bring more shoppers as opposed to beach-goers, which will attract a better type 
of retail business to the existing commercial buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Newton, who is also a member of the city's Downtown Revitalization Committee, 
complained that "most of the successful businesses in downtown Hermosa cater to 
our children -- to younger kids going to the beach and buying T-shirts and 
shorts and things like that. But there's nothing for someone like me to shop 
for, unless I'm buying for one of my kids." 
</P>
<P>
The stretch of beach where the hotel will rise has for years been tied in with 
one of the city's most vexing issues: What to do with the two blocks where the 
old Biltmore Hotel used to stand. 
</P>
<P>
Until its demolition in the 1960s, the Biltmore Hotel took up most of the 1400 
block of The Strand, with its Bathhouse next door at 13th Street and The 
Strand. But over time, the once-grand establishment deteriorated. By the time 
it was razed, it was a low-rent residential hotel that many in the community 
saw as an eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
La Playita's Cohen, for example, recalled taking swimming lessons at the 
Biltmore's indoor pool as a child, and said her memories were mostly of "the 
musty smell and chipping paint and the sound of the place -- like an echo 
chamber!" 
</P>
<P>
The site was taken over by the city, but residents could not agree on what to 
do with it. City Hall's specific plan for the site involved linking the 
0.85-acre Biltmore plot with the privately owned 1300 block to make way for a 
260-room hotel. But the hotel idea was voted down at the polls, along with just 
about every other plan imaginable for the site, from skyscrapers to a public 
park. 
</P>
<P>
It was Greenwood and a partner who initially were to have built the 260-room 
hotel. But as the squabbling continued over the years, the developer quietly 
completed his acquisition of the 1300 block and went ahead with plans for a 
smaller hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Because the block was already zoned for commercial development and the city had 
already certified an environmental impact report for the larger hotel, city 
officials had little leverage over Greenwood's scaled-down project. In an 
executive session in 1989 -- called because the council at the time feared 
litigation by Greenwood -- he agreed to meet a number of conditions that would 
be attached to his building permit. 
</P>
<P>
This year, as a result of the Greenwood affair, the City Council passed a new 
ordinance requiring public review of virtually all new buildings in the city. 
Included in the ordinance was a deadline that gave Greenwood only six months to 
submit blueprints and plans explaining how he would mitigate the impact of 
construction on the densely packed beach area. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, he promised to hire a consultant to make sure excavation 
does not affect nearby buildings. Critics note that the foundation of 
Greenwood's hotel will be 35 feet underground, 25 feet below the water table. 
The excavation and siphoning, they said, may cause surrounding property to 
sink. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwood said the hotel will open in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the Biltmore site next door, meanwhile, remains under debate. The 
City Council has voted to zone it for single-family homes, a plan that is 
before the Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
If the commission approves the zoning, the council has agreed to put the plan 
to a voter referendum. Meanwhile, civic activist Herriott has vowed to put a 
competing plan before the voters that would make a public park of the site. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwood said that, having gotten the go-ahead for his project, he has no 
strong feelings about what goes in on the block next door.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPUTERS DONATED TO SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A computer firm has donated $235,000 worth of equipment to the California 
Academy of Mathematics and Science, a specialty high school at Cal State 
Dominguez Hills in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty academy students will soon be able to take home computers donated by 
Apple Computer for use during a nine-week computer skills course, said Douglas 
Stewart, the academy's director of development. 
</P>
<P>
An additional 32 computers, along with printers and other equipment, are 
already in place in classrooms and offices. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said the donation will enable the school, which accepts students from 
five neighboring school districts, to keep up with changing technology. The 
academy opened this semester and is the first math-science high school in the 
nation situated on a university campus, school officials say.

CLIPPERS SLOWED BY MAVERICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DALLAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were flashes of brilliance in the first quarter and flashes of a return 
to form in the fourth, but in the end there was too much Clipper smoldering to 
beat a team needing someone to light a match under them. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, Dallas smoked the Clippers. With motivation of avoiding a fourth 
consecutive home loss serving as the spark, the Mavericks, suffering through 
injury problems of their own, won, 107-88, Wednesday night at Reunion Arena. 
Rolando Blackman scored 30 points, reaching that plateau for the fifth time in 
eight games, and pseudo power forward Alex English added 17. 
</P>
<P>
It could have been worse had the Clippers not put together a 17-0 run in the 
first quarter, turning an 11-2 deficit into a 19-11 lead as Dallas went 
scoreless for a stretch of 6:09. But what seemed so impressive, not to mention 
encouraging, mattered little in the end. 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks, who have gone from playoff probables to hopefuls with injuries 
that will keep Roy Tarpley out the rest of the season and Fat Lever sidelined 
at least another few weeks, adjusted. They quickly regrouped and cooled the 
Clipper offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to react to it because we would have kept on sliding at home," said 
Blackman, who is averaging 27.3 points and shooting 56.1% the past eight 
outings. "We were already battered, and that (the Clipper run) was like one of 
those punches across the chin. We were staggering a little, but were we going 
to drop? It took some resolve." 
</P>
<P>
The main adjustment was denying quick baskets to the Clippers, who came in 
having shot 51.9% and 53.3% in the previous two games. Seven of the eight field 
goals that accounted for the majority of the early run came on first shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, there was one shot available, and that was a 15-footer with no one on 
them," Blackman said. "Once we slowed them down, it was a different basketball 
game. They're especially good when they run." 
</P>
<P>
Dallas grabbed control from there, taking a four-point lead, 48-44, by halftime 
and pushing that to 12, 75-63, at the end of the third quarter. The Mavericks' 
biggest margin was 19, the final score. 
</P>
<P>
Forced back into a more pedestrian pace, the Clippers struggled, finishing at 
38.8% in their ninth consecutive road loss dating to last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done that before in spurts," said Charles Smith, who led the Clippers 
with 24 points and nine rebounds. "But the biggest thing is that we've got to 
keep it going. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Dallas played very well, but I think a lot of it is on us. I missed 
a lot of tough shots, crucial shots, too. Everyone was in and out all night 
long." 
</P>
<P>
The final flicker came from Danny Manning, not the most likely of sources these 
days. The still-recovering forward showed a glimpse of what he can provide when 
100%. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Manning scored all the Clippers' points in an 8-2 rally -- a runner on 
the right side, a couple of free throws, a turnaround jumper on the right 
baseline, a layin after driving the lane. That was the best of his 14 points in 
18 minutes, but, more important, also his best stretch since coming off the 
injured list three games ago. 
</P>
<P>
Then he went out. Even as the doctor-imposed time limit to avoid a return of 
tendinitis was increased from 15 to 20 minutes for this and at least one more 
game, the clock remains his ball and chain. 
</P>
<P>
"That's frustrating," he said. "I've got to get back in shape, got to get my 
timing back. I'm missing shots I am accustomed to making. In time, it'll get 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Loy Vaught continues to impress in the exact the role the Clippers drafted him 
for: rebounder off the bench. The 6-9, 240-pounder had eight in 19 minutes 
Wednesday, one short of the team high, and this after reaching double figures 
as a reserve in three of the previous four games. "I pursue every ball," Vaught 
said. "When you do that, you stack the odds in your favor. A lot of guys will 
only go after balls they think they can get." . . . One game after establishing 
a season high with 25 turnovers at Houston, the Clippers bounced back with a 
season-low 12 against Dallas. . . . Rolando Blackman became the Mavericks' 
all-time leading scorer. A second-quarter basket gave him 13,931 points, one 
better than Mark Aguirre.

THIS TEST IS A SNAP FOR LAKERS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: L.A. BEATS SPURS, 97-80, FOR FIFTH WIN IN A ROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If this was a test, the Lakers whizzed through it and the San Antonio Spurs 
flunked so badly, they were kept after class. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, returning to quality competition after beating up on several tomato 
cans, dropped San Antonio, 97-80, Wednesday night before 17,210 in the Forum, 
running their winning streak to five games. 
</P>
<P>
They play next at Phoenix, then return home to face the Detroit Pistons. If San 
Antonio was reading, here come writing and arithmetic. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big game," Laker Coach Mike Dunleavy said. "No getting around it, 
we won five games out of the last six, but the only real good ones in that 
stretch were Golden State and Houston. The other games, you're supposed to win. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a test against a team that we played earlier in the season and 
basically folded in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers held the Spurs to 34% from the field. David Robinson missed 13 of 19 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
Terrific Laker defense, or what? 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't the defense," said Spur Coach Larry Brown. "Just an awful effort on 
our part. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a chance to come into a building and play against a great team. I 
didn't care about winning. I wanted to see us play hard and I didn't see that. 
. . . I'm really disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Brown kept his dressing room closed for an extra 10 minutes to tell his players 
how disappointed he was. 
</P>
<P>
The game belonged to the Lakers almost from the beginning, with hints of that 
big lead they blew at San Antonio in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
They led by 18 points in the second quarter, only to see the Spurs cut it to 10 
at the half. 
</P>
<P>
They led by 24 in the third quarter, only to see the Spurs cut it to 13. 
</P>
<P>
They led by 20 early in the fourth quarter, only to see the Spurs climb to 
within 12. At that point, Terry Cummings came down and fired from behind the 
three-point line. The ball clanked off the side of the rim, and the Spurs 
finally sank. 
</P>
<P>
For the Spurs, the day started early, at 6:15 a.m. in Seattle, where they had 
won the night before. A two-hour plane flight, a couple of bus rides, a nap and 
they were raring to go, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot easier to get up after a win," Brown said before the game. "You 
come in here, you should be excited to play against the best." 
</P>
<P>
Who was that, the 6-5 Lakers or the 8-3 Spurs? "We've got a long way to go 
before we can talk like those guys," Brown said. "They've done it." 
</P>
<P>
Well, the game wasn't as exciting as Brown had hoped. The Lakers hit his team 
with an 11-0 run in the first quarter and a 10-0 run to begin the third. 
</P>
<P>
After that, it was just a matter of maintaining their poise. This time, the 
Lakers managed. 
</P>
<P>
So the team that started 1-4 has since gone 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
"Which do I hope is the real Lakers?" said Dunleavy, late Wednesday night, 
laughing again. 
</P>
<P>
Guess which. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
The non-sellout was the Lakers' eighth of the season. They sold out a 
team-record 35 of 41 games last season. . . . A.C. Green had another good game 
in a substitute role: 14 points, five rebounds. In his last two games, he has 
29 points, 22 rebounds. . . . Mike Dunleavy: "Coming in, a lot of people told 
me A.C. couldn't come off the bench. . . . In Dallas, I got him up, woke him 
out of an afternoon nap to tell him I wanted to talk to him in his room. When I 
told him, he said, 'Whatever you want, Coach.' A.C. is a terrific guy. I 
expected him to say what he said. Still, I know it'd be difficult for him." . . 
. Seen in the Laker dressing room: rookie Elden Campbell, with a book titled 
"The Thinking Man's Guide to Eating Right" at his feet, munching sour cream 
potato chips and drinking Hawaiian Punch 1 1/2 hours before the game. . . . 
Spurs have lost reserve forward Sidney Green for four weeks with bone spurs in 
an ankle. . . . Spurs' Reggie Williams, the former Clipper disappointment 
subsequently dumped by Cleveland, started the night with an 8.5 average and a 
70% average from three-point range. "I think he's with a young group of guys 
and they've made him feel comfortable," Spurs Coach Larry Brown said. "He 
didn't have to go through that pressure situation. When we got him last year, 
it was hard for him to get through a practice the first week. We've tried to 
accentuate the positive with him."

USC FADES IN LOSS TO MARYLAND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
George Raveling's booming voice echoed down the hallway outside the locker 
room. For 20 minutes Raveling lectured USC's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
He had every right to be upset after watching the Trojans collapse in the final 
12 1/2 minutes of a 72-59 loss to Maryland Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 42-40, after guard Harold Miner, who scored 22 points, hit a 
three-point jump shot with 12:25 remaining, the Trojans fell apart and Maryland 
outscored them, 17-6, in the next six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was sauna-like in Cole Field House, USC was ice cold, missing 10 of 
its final 18 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the heat was a factor," Raveling said. "What disappoints me is 
the manner in which we lost. We didn't exhibit the kind of basketball that 
we're capable of playing." 
</P>
<P>
Raveling was so flustered after emerging from the locker room that he grabbed 
the wrong sports jacket on his way to the press room. 
</P>
<P>
"That's symbolic of the evening, nothing fit," Raveling said. "The only 
positive I see in this game is that it happened in our second game of the 
season. We have to use this game as a bucket of cold water to wake us up and 
make us realize some things we're going to have to do to be a better basketball 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly were not a team tonight. The rules say you have to put five 
players out there, so SC had five players out there, but they didn't have a 
team out there tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Shadowed by forward Vince Broadnax and reserve guard Kevin McLinton, who were 
assigned to him in Maryland's box-and-one defense, Miner missed 10 of 20 shots. 
He began forcing shots, missing six of seven three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely didn't play well at all," Miner said. "But you have to take the 
good with the bad. You can't play perfect every game. I just have to build on 
this and move forward." 
</P>
<P>
Miner wasn't the only Trojan who played poorly. 
</P>
<P>
USC forward Ronnie Coleman, who had 10 points and 11 rebounds, missed 10 of 15 
shots, including a dunk. The Trojans shot only 38.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Robert Pack missed six of 10 shots and had a team-high five 
turnovers. Guard Phil Glenn missed five of six shots and forward Calvin Banks 
missed three of four shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody for SC played well," Raveling said. "It was just one of those horrible 
nights that you wish never happened to you." 
</P>
<P>
After opening the season with a 41-point victory over Chicago State last 
weekend, Raveling thought the Maryland game would provide him with a better 
barometer for the Trojans (1-1). 
</P>
<P>
Although USC shot 39.4% in the first half, the Trojans trailed by only 29-28 at 
halftime because Maryland couldn't convert its free throws, missing seven of 
nine. 
</P>
<P>
But the Terrapins took control of the game in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Walt Williams scored 16 of his 20 points in the second half to lead the 
Terrapins (1-1). He had 10 points in Maryland's decisive run, hitting two 
three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Garfield Smith had 19 points and 12 rebounds, and center Cedric Lewis 
was a force inside with eight points, 14 rebounds and six blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
USC center Yamen Sanders, sidelined with a sprained ankle, didn't make the 
trip. Keith Greeley started in place of Sanders, but he was replaced by 
freshman Mark Boyd at the start of the second half. Boyd had eight points and 
four rebounds for the Trojans. . . . Maryland guard Matt Roe, a transfer from 
Syracuse, had 16 points.

NBA ROUNDUP;

<P>
PISTONS GO TO EDWARDS FOR NINTH IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Detroit Pistons are so talented and well-balanced that the same player 
rarely leads them in scoring two games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
They have developed a knack for finding one or more hot shooters whenever they 
are needed. 
</P>
<P>
What does stay constant, though, is the defense. 
</P>
<P>
The two-time NBA champions ran their winning streak to nine games and improved 
their record to 12-2 Wednesday night at Auburn Hills, Mich., with a 90-83 
victory over the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
It was James Edwards' turn to lead the scoring. The veteran power forward had 
22 points and sank a couple of key baskets down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the defense took control. The slumping Knicks, who have lost four in 
a row, played the Pistons to a 52-52 standstill at halftime. But in the second 
half the Knicks scored only 31 points and, despite a Detroit cold spell in the 
fourth quarter, never really had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons led, 77-66, going into the final 12 minutes but failed to get a 
point in seven consecutive trips down the court. Their tough defense, however, 
let the Knicks get no closer than six points despite the Pistons' 13-point 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good thing we played great defense in the second half," Coach Chuck 
Daly said, "because we couldn't get any shots. We had six 24-second violations, 
which shows you just how good their defense was." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards was expecting a good night. "Charles Oakley is a fine player, but at 
6-9, he's too short," the seven-footer said. "I can go over the top of him." 
</P>
<P>
Miami 97, New Jersey 79 -- Maybe winning three games in a row made the Nets 
overconfident. Whatever, they didn't come to Miami ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
They shot a season-low 36% from the field but still trailed by only four points 
until late in the third period when Heat rookie Willie Burton triggered a 9-0 
run that broke it open. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 110, Cleveland 108 -- The Warriors are a much better team with 
Mitch Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
In his second game back from a sprained ankle, Richmond scored 24 points and 
made a key rebound in the closing seconds at Richfield, Ohio, to end the 
Warriors' three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Hardaway had 23 points and 17 assists for the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 118, Washington 94 -- Michael Jordan started out at Chicago as if he 
were on his way to one of his 50-point games. He had 15 points in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But high-scoring games are not that important to the Bulls' star these days. 
With the Bulls building a 39-26 lead, Jordan spent most of the rest of the game 
on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, 11 of 15 from the field, finished with 24 points in just 27 minutes. 
All 12 Bulls scored as they romped to their third victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte 118, Milwaukee 111 -- The Hornets never led during regulation at 
Charlotte, but behind J.R. Reid and Rex Chapman, went wild in overtime, scoring 
16 points. It was their first victory over the Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
Armon Gilliam, after missing four games because of tendinitis, scored 20 points 
and had 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks led most of the night and had a four-point lead with 35 seconds left 
in regulation. But Muggsy Bogues hit an 18-foot jumper and followed with two 
free throws. Ricky Pierce, who scored 28 points, gave the Bucks the lead back 
with a short jumper, but Chapman sent it into overtime with a jumper with four 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 116, Indiana 106 -- Charles Barkley had 33 points, 12 rebounds and 
five assists at Philadelphia to lead the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 103, Houston 92 -- Karl Malone scored 31 points at Salt Lake City and the 
Jazz held Akeem Olajuwon to 19 and won their fourth in a row. DAN HAFNER

Nothing fishy about this rainbow trout. It's simple, healthful and quick. 
Oven-steamed in foil with flavorful vegetables, the fish is not masked with any 
complicated sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The secret to tender, moist trout is to avoid overcooking. The fish is done 
when it flakes easily with a fork. (Note: If you buy the fish frozen, check the 
expiration date on the package; also, make sure there are no holes in it, or 
the fish may have suffered dehydration.) 
</P>
<P>
Green beans team nicely with our catch of the day; saute them in garlic butter 
and splash a little balsamic vinegar at the end. A no-fuss sweet ending to the 
meal is instant persimmon sorbet: a frozen whole persimmon. It's delicious, but 
make sure the fruit is ripe and juicy. 
</P>
<P>
Try this Tomato Trout Bake. Its healthful goodness will set you up for the 
forthcoming indulgences of holiday foods.

WINE NOTES: CHIANTI IN RIVERSIDE? 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mt. Palomar Winery in Temecula harvested a small quantity of Sangiovese grapes 
in September, and will make a red wine out of the grape of the Chianti region 
of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Poole, general manager of the winery in southern Riverside County, said 
the winery crushed 1.5 tons of the variety, yielding just more than four 
barrels of wine. Mt. Palomar grafted somewhat over an acre of vines to 
Sangiovese in 1989 and got a small crop in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Very little Sangiovese is planted in California. Trentadue, Robert Pepi and 
Atlas Peak are among the few California producers who have made a Sangiovese in 
the past, but interest in the variety is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
Haywood Winery in Sonoma announced it will relocate in Kenwood at the Kunde 
Estate Winery, which is nearing completion, and that Ravenswood Winery has 
signed a lease-option to acquire the Haywood property. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Haywood said his principal source of grapes would continue to be Los 
Chamizal Vineyard, in which he retains ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to a new law passed by the European Economic Community restricting 
certain terms in wine bottles, Italy has adopted the term classimo to designate 
sparkling wine produced by the French methode champenoise. 
</P>
<P>
The term methode champenoise has appeared on some bottles of Italian sparkling 
wine, but EEC rules now restrict that term to sparkling wine made in France. 
</P>
<P>
EEC also restricts the term Champagne from appearing on any wine other than 
those made in the Champagne region of France. 
</P>
<P>
Nestle Enterprises said Walter Klenz, formerly senior vice president of 
finance/operations, was chosen to be president of Wine World Estates, parent 
company of Beringer Vineyards and other wine brands, replacing E. Michael 
Moone, who was promoted to president of Stouffer Foods Corp. in Solon, Ohio.

Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
Bouvet Rubis Excellence: ($13.50) -- This is a delightful change-of-pace wine 
and one that recalls a story of an old friend who went to his mother's house 
each Thanksgiving and was served a red Cold Duck. "It was a headache in a 
bottle," he said. "Sweet and yucky. I'll never drink another red, sweet, bubbly 
wine." He might drink this one. It is red; it is sweet, to be sure, but it's 
well balanced. Rubis is a blend of 60% Cabernet Franc and 40% Gamay, made from 
grapes grown in Anjou and Touraine. The bubbles are fine and persistent and the 
taste is rich. Pair it with sweeter foods (duck in orange or cherry sauce, 
sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce) or serve it after dinner with slightly sweet 
cookies for a rare treat. DAN BERGER

Robert M. Parker Jr., author of five wine books and publisher of a wine 
newsletter, canceled a book-signing tour of Los Angeles and San Francisco this 
week after threats were made against him, his secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, an attorney who left that profession after founding the successful wine 
journal The Wine Advocate in 1979, couldn't be reached for comment on the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Passman, Parker's secretary, said that on the advice of police and 
attorneys, he was not making public comments about the situation. "There have 
been threats against him, and the events are under investigation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A friend of Parker, who requested anonymity, said a caller made threats in 
which Parker's West Coast schedule was mentioned. Among the places Parker was 
to appear to sign copies of his new book "Burgundy" were Wally's in Westwood 
and the Wine House in West Los Angeles. He also canceled appearances at Draper 
&amp; Esquin and Pacific Wine Co. in San Francisco and at Beltramo's in Menlo 
Park.

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Bordeaux producers was in Los Angeles last week showing the trade 
advance samples of the 1989 Bordeaux. The red wines of that vintage were 
impressive, for the most part, but a few of them left me wondering whether this 
wasn't more of a spotty vintage than a "vintage of the century." 
</P>
<P>
The most impressive 1989 I tasted at this event was from Chateau Giscours, a 
powerful, dense wine with marvelous richness and finish. I also liked De 
Fieuzal and Palmer. I was less impressed than I hoped to be with 
Pichon-Lalande. 
</P>
<P>
However, the best values in the room were unquestionably the White Bordeaux, 
and heading the list were three exceptional wines: 
</P>
<P>
* 1989 Chateau de Fieuzal is one of the most complex white wines of Bordeaux I 
have ever tasted, with a spicy richness, deep, intense flavors and layered 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
* 1989 Chateau La Louviere, which offers more spice than the above wine, but 
with a citrusy lilt to the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
* 1989 Chateau La Tour Martillac, with similar components and a little softer, 
richer taste. 
</P>
<P>
All three wines should sell for $15 to $25 a bottle. All three may be hard to 
find, but merchants may be able to place orders for them. 
</P>
<P>
* 1988 Stewart Chardonnay, Columbia Valley ($11) -- A lovely wine from 
Washington State that's just been made available in Southern California. The 
delicate citrus and spice aroma is not mucked up with too much oak and the 
taste is delicate, not as heavy-handed as a lot of today's Chardonnays. The 
finish is full of fruit and yet delicate, and the wine is crisp enough to go 
with food. Good value. 
</P>
<P>
* 1989 Conn Creek Sauvignon Blanc, Late Harvest ($14/half bottle) -- From 
grapes off high-altitude Atlas Peak after rains helped to rot the grapes, this 
marvelous wine has delicate varietal fruit in the aroma (new mown hay and 
honey) and amazingly deep concentration even though the residual sugar (9%) 
isn't as high as some sweet wines. A wine the equal of many Sauternes at a 
competitive price. Top-notch wine making. 
</P>
<P>
* 1990 Charles Shaw Gamay Beaujolais Nouveau ($6) -- A violet-hued wine that 
was in grape form less than three months ago. A generous aroma of raspberries 
and cranberries leads to a soft, fleshy taste. Serve chilled as an 
accompaniment to ham, turkey leftovers, spaghetti, hamburgers, or as a Monday 
night football accompaniment to pizza. Don't age it; drink it before spring. 
</P>
<P>
* 1990 Robert Pecota Gamay Beaujolais Nouveau ($6) -- Similar to the above wine 
with a trace more blue in the color and a bit more sassy black cherry aroma 
with a hint of black pepper. The wine is a bit gutsier than the Shaw and 
shouldn't be chilled quite as much as the Shaw. But it, too, would be superb 
with unpretentious cooking. These two wines are the American counterparts of 
vin de l'anee, the Beaujolais Nouveau from France that has shot up in price 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
* 1989 J. Carey Sauvignon Blanc ($9) -- Complex aromas of melon, pear and a 
trace of grassy/herbal notes are intriguing, and the taste is soft yet still 
distinctive. The finish is dry and rewarding. Unlike so many Sauvignon Blancs 
that are neutral these days, this wine has some flavor and pizzazz. DAN BERGER

ZONE CHANGE DEFERRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to concerns from 20 angry residents of Mildred Avenue, the City 
Council deferred the granting of a zone change for construction of an office 
building on their block until the developer comes back to the council with 
plans that would shift the driveway for the building from Mildred Avenue to 
Washington Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the three-story office complex had already been approved by the 
Planning Commission, and the council was to rule on whether to grant a change 
from a residential to a limited commercial zone. 
</P>
<P>
Residents were concerned that having the driveway on Mildred Avenue would 
increase traffic on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a quiet street, relatively speaking, and we would like to keep it that 
way," said Jerry Kaye, who organized residents on the street. 
</P>
<P>
A traffic engineer hired by the developer said that putting the driveway on 
Washington Boulevard would be more dangerous for cars making left turns out of 
the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents expressed anger that they had not been notified of the 
project. According to city ordinance, notification is required only for 
property owners within 300 feet of any proposed construction or zone change. 
</P>
<P>
The architect for the building, who was present at the meeting, said he would 
come back to the Planning Commission in December with plans that include a 
driveway on Washington Boulevard. The request for a zone change will then come 
before the council at its first meeting in January.

ZONING CODE CHANGES OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Culver City Council approved several changes in zoning codes Monday that 
will affect new construction of apartment complexes. The changes include 
reducing some height limits, increasing the number of parking spaces per unit, 
and mandating open space for larger complexes and private outdoor space for 
smaller apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-2 vote approving the changes also maintains current density regulations 
that limit large R-3 complexes to 15 units per acre and smaller R-4 buildings 
to 29 units per acre, with a further limitation of nine units per lot. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Steven Gourley and Councilman James Boulgarides, who were in favor of 
reducing the number of units allowed per lot, voted against the measure. 
Council members Paul Jacobs, Jozelle Smith and Mike Balkman voted in favor. 
</P>
<P>
"This does not solve that problem (of high density housing)," said Gourley, who 
noted that the purpose of having the Planning Commission review the code 
regulations was to prevent such high density housing. "Maybe it couldn't. Maybe 
it was an impossible task. But because of that, I can't support it." 
</P>
<P>
Among the code revisions the council approved, the height limit and parking 
requirements are most significant. Buildings in R-3a and R-4 zones will be 
scaled back from 35 feet to 30 feet, or two stories. 
</P>
<P>
Developers will be required to provide two parking spaces for each one-bedroom 
apartment, 2 1/2 spaces for a two-bedroom apartment, and 3 1/2 spaces for a 
three-bedroom apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Larger R-3 complexes will now have to provide at least 30% of a project as open 
space. Smaller R-4 buildings will have no open space requirement, but they will 
instead have to provide 70 square feet per unit of private outdoor space, such 
as balconies, patios or decks. 
</P>
<P>
Other revisions deal with formulas for determining front, rear and side 
setbacks, landscaping for side setbacks, and a requirement for a storage area 
for each unit of 78 cubic feet.

Astronomer Andrew Fraknoi's "Other Worlds: A Grand Tour of the Solar System" 
certainly interests us. We have a strong suspicion that we're from outer space, 
since not a day goes by that someone doesn't ask: "What planet are you from?" 
The program will include images sent back by U.S., Soviet and European 
spacecraft, and the latest information from telescopes on Earth and in space. 
</P>
<P>
And Fraknoi, who's executive director of the Astronomical Society of the 
Pacific, promises his discussion of the subject won't even contain a syllable 
of NASAspeak. Just plain, everyday language about the rings of Saturn, 
Jupiter's stormy moon Io, asteroids, the search for Planet X and more. It will 
be held Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in Room 2160E of the Dickson Art Center 
at UCLA. Fees vary. For information call (213) 825-7093. Klaatu, barada, nikto.

Fred Beteta, an unsuccessful candidate for state Assembly in the recent

Beteta, 61, a longtime Santa Monica College trustee and retired engineer,

"I thought I was going to die," said Beteta, who said he was slashed in the ear 
and had his face repeatedly pushed into the floor. "They kept roughing me up, 
asking me where the money was in my house." 
</P>
<P>
After tying Beteta's hands and feet behind him with nylon cords, the two 
assailants escaped with about $60 from his wallet and stole his maroon 1978 
Toyota Cressida, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Beteta said a jewelry box belonging to his wife, Lucy, also was stolen, but 
that he did not notice it until after he filed the police report. 
</P>
<P>
Beteta, a Republican who challenged Assemblyman Tom Hayden in the race for his 
44th District seat, said two young men had approached him about three weeks 
ago, saying they were hungry and looking for food. 
</P>
<P>
Beteta said the men told him they were illegal aliens from Mexico. He said he 
did not know if they came to his house randomly or if they noticed his home 
address printed on a campaign mailer. 
</P>
<P>
A staunch conservative who was born in Nicaragua, Beteta said he took pity on 
the men and gave them some yard work in exchange for food and about $20 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Beteta said the men returned Tuesday asking for more food, and that he again 
gave them some yard work. Beteta told police that after letting the men into 
his house so they could wash their hands when they were done, they brandished 
butcher knives and tied him down. 
</P>
<P>
Beteta said that despite being bound, he managed to maneuver his hands to dial 
operator assistance to ask for help. Telephone company officials notified 
police, who arrived at Beteta's home at 1:40 p.m. to find that he had just 
freed himself, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
The men, whom Beteta described as being of medium height and build and in their 
early 20s, are still at large, according to Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Beteta said he thought the attack illustrated a growing danger in Santa Monica 
posed by transients attracted to the city by its feeding and social service 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are creating a haven for these people here, not realizing we're creating 
trouble at the same time," said Beteta. "People are getting victimized by 
attempting to be compassionate." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, the police daytime watch commander, said people "should be very careful 
of the people they hire to work in their yards."

HOMEOWNERS' SANTA MONICA VIEW PREVAILS; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: NEIGHBORS STOP AN ADELAIDE DRIVE REMODELING PROJECT THAT WOULD HAVE 
BLOCKED THEIR VISTA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After nearly four years, a group of homeowners can officially declare victory 
in their fight to stop a neighbor's remodeling project that would have blocked 
ocean and canyon views on scenic Adelaide Drive on the Santa Monica-Los Angeles 
border. 
</P>
<P>
A Santa Monica Superior Court judge earlier this month released a $55,000 bond 
put up by the Adelaide Drive Homeowners Assn. in 1986, when it filed suit to 
stop Peter Olmstead from remodeling his home at 345 Adelaide Drive. The group 
was required to post the bond to cover damages in case it lost the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The release of the money was the last legal step in the fight, which began Dec. 
10, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Jon Diamond, an attorney representing the homeowners, said the successful 
fight was significant because if Olmstead had been allowed to enlarge his house 
so as to block his neighbors' views, it may have opened the way for others to 
do it. 
</P>
<P>
The house is next to a public stairway of nearly 200 steps connecting Adelaide 
Drive to Entrada Drive, and both the stairway and Adelaide Drive are used by 
many joggers in the area because of the panoramic view of the Pacific Ocean and 
Santa Monica Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"The big worry was that if one house went up above what is now considered one 
of the most beautiful streets in Los Angeles -- not only for residents but for 
visitors -- this scenic drive would have turned into an alley," Diamond said. 
"Residents would have had to face the rear portions of people's houses, and it 
would have ruined the street." 
</P>
<P>
Olmstead received building permits from the city of Los Angeles on Oct. 1, 
1986. Neighbors complained when they realized that he planned to build above 
the street level, which they said was prohibited by a 1961 zoning ruling that 
limited the height of some hillside houses to no more than five feet below 
Adelaide Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The frame of Olmstead's house is built into the hillside between Adelaide Drive 
and Entrada Drive. Although most of the wood frame is below Adelaide Drive, a 
steel girder rises about 20 feet above the street. 
</P>
<P>
City officials issued a stop-work order on Oct. 21, 1986, but Olmstead ignored 
it. Residents filed suit, and the courts issued a temporary restraining order 
blocking construction until a city zoning adminstrator heard the case. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was held Dec. 16, 1986, and on Jan. 8, 1987, the administrator 
ruled that the height limit was valid. Olmstead appealed the decision to the 
city Board of Zoning Appeals, and the neighbors received a preliminary 
injunction to prevent Olmstead from going forward with the remodeling during 
his appeals, all of which he lost. 
</P>
<P>
Olmstead, who could not be reached for comment, was also fighting a separate 
lawsuit filed by a couple who live next-door to the house. Terry Sanders and 
his wife, Freida Mock, had filed suit in August, 1986, charging Olmstead with 
encroaching on a driveway easement they needed to get to their home. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the court ruled in favor of Sanders and Mock. Olmstead appealed the 
decision, but lost. Trial for damages was scheduled for October of this year, 
but a settlement was reached in September. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the settlement, Olmstead agreed to sell his unfinished house to his 
neighbors. According to property records, the unfinished house sold for 
$900,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great," said Sanders. "This is like recovering from an affliction." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders said he plans to finish the house and sell it, but has agreed not to 
build above street level.

<CORRECTION>
<P>
House remodeling -- A Westside story on Nov. 29, 1990, about the end of a 
four-year effort by neighbors to stop a homeowner from remodeling his home on 
Adelaide Drive in Los Angeles incorrectly stated that the homeowner, Peter 
Olmstead, lost his appeal of a ruling by a city zoning administrator. In fact, 
the city Board of Zoning Appeals ruled in his favor. The story also incorrectly 
stated that Olmstead lost an appeal in a related lawsuit filed by his next-door 
neighbors. The court refused to hear the appeal because only a partial ruling 
on the suit had been made by the lower court.

SETTLEMENT REACHED IN METHANE GAS EXPLOSION; 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUIT: THE EXACT AMOUNT IS UNKNOWN, BUT MCFARLAND ENERGY CO. REPORTEDLY 
AGREES TO PAY 21 PEOPLE BETWEEN $2.5 MILLION AND $8 MILLION.

<P>
Court documents indicate that the McFarland Energy Co. has agreed to a 
settlement worth between $2.5 million and $8 million to the 21 people injured 
in a methane gas explosion and fire five years ago at the Ross Dress for Less 
store in the Park Labrea shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
The exact amount of the settlement has been sealed by court order, but 
documents show that the two sides were working toward a compromise in the range 
of $2.5 million and $8 million. The agreement means that McFarland, the last of 
several defendants, paid the biggest settlement by far. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the firm, which operates oil wells beneath the Fairfax District 
from a tree-hidden enclave behind the Farmers Market, declined to comment on 
the financial value of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But Lawrence Hirst, vice president and general counsel, said that the Santa Fe 
Springs-based company had no responsibility for the blast and fire. 
</P>
<P>
"The insurance companies got together and decided to settle. They had the 
authority to do that, but it was done without any acknowledgement of fault on 
the part of McFarland Energy, certainly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Court records show that the earlier settlements totalled about $850,000, 
including $500,000 from the May Co. stores and the Metropolitan Life Insurance 
Co., which owned the property at the time of the March 24, 1985, incident. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the victims then demanded $8,170,711 from McFarland, arguing that 
its operations, which included removing oil and reinjecting water and natural 
gas into fault-riddled underground formations, made it responsible. 
</P>
<P>
CIGNA, McFarland's insurance carrier, then responded with a counteroffer of 
$2,530,000, the documents showed. 
</P>
<P>
That offer was rejected in June, but continued negotiations yielded an 
agreement by October. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Wollman, an attorney for McFarland, said expert testimony would have 
shown that the methane that seeped into the Ross store was caused by the 
degeneration of plant matter near the surface, thousands of feet above 
McFarland's oil and gas reserves. 
</P>
<P>
"This evidence notwithstanding, McFarland has chosen, without admitting 
liability, that it would settle with the plaintiffs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Matthew B. F. Biren, the attorney who brought the suit, said the result 
"represented an appropriate acknowledgement on the part of McFarland of its 
responsibility for the explosion, despite Mr. Wollman's protestations to the 
contrary." 
</P>
<P>
Accusing McFarland of "grossly negligent conduct," Biren said the conditions 
that led to the 1985 blast continue today. 
</P>
<P>
Recent incidents, such as the forced closure of a Wells Fargo bank branch on 
Fairfax Avenue because of a low-pressure methane leak, present "unequivocal 
evidence of the continuing danger," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hirst, however, said that the existence of shallow methane deposits is well 
known in the area, and that the 1985 explosion had more to do with changes in 
the underground water table than with McFarland's work thousands of feet lower. 
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that he says we were grossly negligent or there's a continuing 
danger, he's clearly mistaken," Hirst said. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, we'd suggest that as a producer of oil and gas in the area we are 
actually helping to alleviate the problem, to the extent that we are producing 
in a controlled way, consistent with existing law and regulations," he said.

FINDS IN CUYAMACA MOUNTAINS SPAWNED AREAWIDE RUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard Crawford, Richard Crawford is archivist for the San Diego Historical 
Society. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While few people know Southern California for its mineral wealth, northern San 
Diego County -- from the Laguna Mountains in the east to the foothills of 
Escondido -- has contributed millions of dollars in gold to the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's best known mining period -- the Julian gold rush of 1870 -- began 
when rancher Fred Coleman spotted gold in a creek in the Cuyamaca Mountains. 
When Coleman spread word of his discovery, scores of prospectors raced to the 
hills to pan for placer gold in the mountain streams. The miners formed a 
mining district, and a town of tents emerged called Emily City. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, skepticism over the strike vanished when a load of 1,500 pounds 
of gold ore arrived in town in March, 1870. The San Diego Union reported the 
event: 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of so large a quantity of rich gold-bearing quartz created intense 
excitement in town. A stampede immediately ensued and the road has now for 
several days been lined with teams of every description and men mounted and on 
foot in route to the mines. From persons who returned yesterday we learned that 
there are now on the ground not less than 600 persons and the number is daily 
increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Julian gold fever soon infected the whole of the Southwest. Miners poured into 
the region from San Francisco via steamer or overland from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The miners found lode gold in several hillside areas. The claims bore formal 
names such as George Washington, Mount Vernon, The Monroe, and U.S. Grant, as 
well as novel titles such as Shoo Fly, April Fool, You Bet, and Don't Bother 
Me. 
</P>
<P>
The first significant town site was laid out by homesteader Drury Bailey and 
named "Julian City" after his cousin, Mike Julian. A tent city at first, Julian 
grew in two years to a population of nearly 2,000 -- half the size of San 
Diego. At its gold-rush peak, the town boasted two hotels, two cafes, five 
stores, two blacksmith shops, two livery stables, a school, a race track, and 
uncounted saloons and dance halls. The town became important politically after 
Mike Julian was appointed county assessor (an attempt to move the county seat 
to Julian from San Diego failed). 
</P>
<P>
Neighboring mining camps grew up in the region: Branson City, Eastwood, and 
Coleman City (Emily City). Banner, located a few miles southwest of Julian, 
became a sizeable town. 
</P>
<P>
The mining boom of Julian-Banner lasted less than five years. In 1873 the camps 
produced $500,000 in gold, but late in the year, plans for the long-anticipated 
Texas and Pacific Railroad collapsed. A severe recession gripped the region. 
Gold production began to decline and, by 1876, most of the mines had closed. 
The population of Julian fell to less than 100 people, and Banner became a 
ghost town. Between 1870 and 1875 the mines had produced about $2 million in 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
The late 1800s saw a major revival in mining, helped by the completion of 
railroad connections to the north. The new rail and stage lines promoted fresh 
interest in mining ventures. The most successful activity came from the 
Stonewall Mine south of Julian. Purchased by California Gov. Robert W. Waterman 
for $75,000, the mine yielded $1 million in gold between 1888 and 1891. 
</P>
<P>
Gold mining was not confined to the mountains of the northeast county. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1890s, prospectors found gold in the Escondido region. The 
Cleveland-Pacific, Oro Fino, and Cravath mines -- located only 2 miles 
southeast of the Escondido city hall -- produced about $150,000 (at $20 per 
ounce) in the early century. 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland-Pacific Mining Company developed the most important site from 
1896 through 1911. A 350-foot incline shaft followed a vein of gold-bearing 
quartz. Ore was processed at the site using a five-stamp mill and 10-foot high 
tanks of cyanide. Slow activity continued from the 1920s until about 1932, when 
all mining stopped and the shafts were dynamited shut. Citrus and avocado 
groves soon covered all traces of the mines. 
</P>
<P>
Reminders of the San Diego County gold producing days still exist, though. 
</P>
<P>
Old mine dumps near the junction of San Pasqual Valley Road and Bear Valley 
Parkway can be seen today as low hills. 
</P>
<P>
The site of the Stonewall Mine near the southeast shore of Cuyamaca Reservoir 
is clearly marked within Cuyamaca State Park and easily reached by visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagle-High Peak Mine of Julian produces gold to this day and even provides 
guided tours of the diggings.

NORTH COUNTY GROUPS BRING TRUE SPIRIT OF HOLIDAY SEASON TO NEEDY

Shannon and Stan Kuder began to truly explore the meaning of Christmas about 10 
years ago when her parents asked that they be given no gifts. Instead, the 
parents said, they would prefer that the Kuder family donate to a good cause in 
their name. Eventually the Kuders found the Adopt-A-Family program at the 
Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, the entire family -- including two teen-age sons and a young daughter -- 
got caught up in the idea of giving rather than receiving at Christmas and 
decided to forgo gifts to one another. For six years now they have devoted 
their efforts to adopted families that they never meet. 
</P>
<P>
"We love it," says Shannon Kuder. "We wrap all the gifts and sign the cards 
from Santa Claus. It was especially fun when we got a family where the kids 
were really little. My kids got excited looking at all the tiny clothes and 
toys. One year, back when they were so popular, I won a Cabbage Patch doll in a 
drawing. We had a 9-year-old girl in our family that year and I was able to 
give her the doll." 
</P>
<P>
The Kuders, from Encinitas, are particularly glad to be able to adopt a family 
this year because they themselves went through a time of economic uncertainty. 
The company Stan Kuder worked for went out of business, and he lost his job. 
After a brief stint in a temporary position, however, he found permanent 
employment. Shannon Kuder, a full-time homemaker, says the experience made her 
even more sympathetic to the plight of the needy. 
</P>
<P>
During the holidays, the prospect of going without is acutely felt by many. 
There are many people in North County in need of help -- military families, the 
homeless, migrant workers, battered women and children. It is estimated that 
about 14% of North County families subsist on incomes of $10,000 a year or 
less. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 36,000 Marines normally stationed at Camp Pendleton have been sent 
to Saudi Arabia, leaving many Marine families in the area to face the holidays 
with only one parent at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of those Marines had second jobs," said the Rev. Michel Gagnon of the 
Parish Church at Mission San Luis Rey. "Now they're overseas and that second 
income is not coming in. Some families can't make the payments on their houses. 
The families are hurting." 
</P>
<P>
Nightly shelter space accommodates only about 20% of the homeless in North 
County, according to United Way figures. Soup kitchens struggle to feed the 
large number of people who show up each day. 
</P>
<P>
"We're serving 600 to 700 meals a week," says Janet Sucro of the Faith and Love 
Ministries in Vista, one of a half-dozen daily meal programs in North County 
for low-income and homeless people. "Each day we get 15 to 20 children. About 
35% are homeless, though we're getting more migrant workers and single parents 
who just can't make it," said Sucro. 
</P>
<P>
The needs of migrant and field workers is more intense at this time of the year 
when the weather is colder and work may be scarce. Nobody knows precisely how 
many undocumented workers there are in North County, but it is estimated that 
more than 60% of San Diego County's migrant workers, a majority of them 
Hispanic, can be found in North County. 
</P>
<P>
"We feed about 100 undocumented workers a day," said Gagnon. "The church keeps 
sandwiches, fruit and other food on hand, and gives it out as travelers pass by 
and ask for it. . . . We do a lot, but there is always more we can do." 
</P>
<P>
As always, children in hospitals, shelters, receiving homes and other social 
welfare situations need toys and clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, the need does increase at holidays," says Judy Winter, director 
of development at Escondido Youth Encounter. "We receive many, many requests 
for help. People feel the stress of not having enough money for food or a tree. 
People feel the hopelessness." 
</P>
<P>
Winter says the group's shelter for battered women and children becomes so full 
at the holidays that roll-away beds must be brought in to accommodate everyone. 
</P>
<P>
There are programs throughout North County offering services -- from dinners to 
gifts for children -- designed to make the holidays a more pleasant time for 
those in need. 
</P>
<P>
The sponsoring organizations all rely on contributions of time, money and goods 
from many individuals to accomplish what they do. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas dinner at the Armed Forces YMCA in Oceanside has been an abiding 
tradition. This year, with Operation Desert Shield in full swing, the Y is 
inviting not only members of the military but also Marine dependent families 
who find themselves alone at the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we fed 220 people at the Y," says YMCA director Glen Bryson. "This 
year we expect more. . . . We need people to carve turkeys, to serve pies, and 
to sit and talk with those who are looking for friendship," said Bryson. 
</P>
<P>
Many community organizations collect and distribute food and gift baskets, 
including churches, the Salvation Army and crisis centers. And in North County 
there are organizations that exist for this sole purpose. The Carlsbad 
Christmas Bureau and the Vista Christmas Caring &amp; Sharing Program are two 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
Milt Cooper, a retired Marine Corps colonel who runs the Carlsbad Christmas 
Bureau says the effort begins with a meeting in June, and picks up steam in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers find storage places, collect food, clothing, toys and other gifts. 
Families register for the baskets, listing the sexes and ages of each member of 
the family. 
</P>
<P>
Then, just before Christmas, volunteers get together and tailor boxes for each 
of the families. When available, canned hams are put in the boxes, but vouchers 
are given for turkeys. Actually, Cooper says, canned ham is the preferred 
Christmas main course, since many of those who receive the baskets have no 
cold-storage facilities or ovens in which to roast the turkeys. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all volunteers," says Tracy Lipinsky, coordinator of Vista Sharing and 
Caring. "We work out of our homes and get referrals from schools, churches, 
public health nurses and welfare offices." 
</P>
<P>
Vista's Caring and Sharing program gave baskets to 540 families last year while 
Carlsbad Christmas Bureau distributed 451. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper says the Carlsbad Christmas Bureau also tries to respond to pleas for 
help for migrant workers, often through the Rev. Rafael Martinez's North County 
Chaplaincy. 
</P>
<P>
Most organizations providing holiday assistance try to screen recipients to 
ensure that they are indeed in need and that they are not being helped 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to take some chances," said Cooper. "You can't worry about that too 
much. For the few that take advantages, there are many more who really need the 
help. Your real enjoyment is when you see the expression on the kids' faces 
when they get a toy, maybe the only toy they'll get this year."

VIDEO DISCOVERY: SOME FUN RIBBING PUNK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the aftermath of the explosion of punk music and its accompanying lifestyle 
in the mid-70s to early 1980s, Hollywood began cranking out teen movies like 
never before. Yet there is no real correlation to be made between the two 
movements since filmmakers all but ignored the punk phenomenon and the culture 
it molded. But far from the safe world of suburban high schools and Hollywood, 
independent filmmaker Susan Seidelman created Wren, a hyper, 
just-out-of-high-school Jersey girl, trying to be a part of the New York punk 
scene in the 1982 film "Smithereens." 
</P>
<P>
In the spirit of the punk movement that inspired it, the film spews raw 
spontaneity, stars a mostly non-professional cast and looks like it was made 
for a few thousand dollars. And, singer-songwriter Richard Hell, co-founder of 
the seminal punk band Television, is cast as a punker whom Wren tries to latch 
on to. In the film, his band is called Smithereens, a name used later in the 
1980s by a real-life pop band. 
</P>
<P>
But it is Wren's nervy determination to have her 15 minutes of fame that drives 
"Smithereens." In the opening scene, this skinny girl wearing a hip-hugging 
miniskirt and silver high heels steals a pair of sunglasses right out of the 
hand of a woman. Wren, played by Susan Berman, meets Paul, a strait-laced 
Midwestern guy, while posting Xeroxed pictures of herself on the subway and 
meets punker Eric, played by Hell, while on a date with Paul. 
</P>
<P>
To Paul, her irresponsibility is exotic, but to everyone else, she's just a 
pain. But she doesn't seem to notice as she dreams of managing a punk band and 
moving to Los Angeles where she wants to "be in a swimming pool, eating tacos 
and signing autographs." Berman, who has appeared in only one film since 
(Seidelman's "Making Mr. Right"), creates a fascinating girl-woman, amoral and 
innocent, a perpetual outsider who thinks she is an insider and seemingly 
doomed by her personality. But Seidelman doesn't turn this pitiful girl's life 
into a maudlin TV Movie of the Week; it's fun and funny, and the studied 
seriousness of punk is given a ribbing. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, Seidelman used the same milieu in her big-budget commercial 
hit "Desperately Seeking Susan." But "Smithereens" is the rough, home-movie 
version -- the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Smithereens" (1982), directed by Susan Seidelman. 90 minutes. No rating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moonlighting" (1982), directed by Jerzy Skolimowski. 97 minutes. Rated PG. An 
unforgettable story of four Polish construction workers sent to London to 
renovate the foreign getaway of their wealthy boss. It's comical, touching, 
newsy and political, a heartfelt tale of workingmen's values and Western 
consumerism. 
</P>
<P>
"Smile" (1975), directed by Michael Ritchie. 113 minutes. Rated PG. A Michael 
Ritchie film about America's unbending faith in traditions and pageantry, no 
matter how tarnished. DOUG LIST

ANYTHING BUT ENFANT'S PLAY

<BYLINE>

covers film for The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 European movie makers have long had a thing for films about children, but not 
necessarily for children. 
</P>
<P>
Some might call it an obsession, all these cinematic love songs to growing up. 
But the best directors realize that the simplicity of kids and their feelings 
make for direct movies able to reflect the adult world in defining ways. See a 
child's terror and joy in facing everyday life and begin to grasp the ineffable 
anxiety and satisfactions of the adult. 
</P>
<P>
Francois Truffaut ("The 400 Blows") understood this, and, more recently, Lasse 
Hallstrom ("My Life as a Dog"), John Boorman ("Hope and Glory") and Jean-Loup 
Hubert ("Le Grand Chemin") have shown they get it too. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Louis Malle's "Au Revoir les Enfants" (screening Friday at UC 
Irvine), a thoroughly honest film based on a few days in the director's life 
when he was 12. Like Truffaut's "The 400 Blows," it balances the pathos of 
experience with a journalist's keen eye. Malle tells his story crisply and 
fondly, and through the naturalness of its emotions, it breaks your heart. 
</P>
<P>
The setting is a Catholic boys school in provincial France, a place of 
stern-faced but kindly priests and fortress-like walls and burnished wood. The 
young students study Latin and arithmetic in the spartan classrooms, vent 
aggression during unruly recesses and get to know each other, slowly, in the 
bunk room where they all sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Against the seeming casualness of all this is the threat of Nazism. The school 
is in occupied territory, and it's a little startling to see German jeeps drive 
by or a Nazi soldier ask a priest to hear his confession. The boys feel the 
influence and are affected by Nazi propaganda. Most of them have never met a 
Jew, but some of them say things like "better the Krauts than the Jews or the 
Communists" to each other in the hallways. 
</P>
<P>
Malle focuses on Julien Quentin (Gaspard Manesse), a self-possessed 12-year-old 
based on the director's own experiences, and Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejto), a new 
boy whom Julien initially rebuffs. When they first meet, Jean asks who he is 
and Julien replies curtly, "I'm Julien Quentin. Don't mess with me." 
</P>
<P>
Later, they develop a tenuous friendship. When Julien asks Jean if he's ever 
scared, he answers, "All the time." It's an insightful moment that tells so 
much of what it's like to be young and small, and it brings them closer. 
</P>
<P>
We discover early on that Jean is Jewish and hiding out in the school with two 
other Jewish boys. The priests know they'll be taken to the concentration camps 
and must be protected. Julien begins to decode Jean's mystery, not realizing 
the danger and only fascinated by the exotic presence of a Jew. 
</P>
<P>
When the inevitable happens and Jean is found out by the Nazis, Julien 
struggles with the notion of a world where a boy can be taken away by anonymous 
men. His melancholy epiphany signals manhood and the start of a courageous 
moral foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is so engrossing because it never slips from the boys' point of view. 
Malle has coaxed touchingly unaffected performances out of all his young 
actors, especially Manesse and Fejto, and has been graced by Renato Berta's 
uncomplicated but purposeful cinematography. 
</P>
<P>
Berta's camera stays with the children and their perspective -- we see the 
students head-on, his camera finding their eyes. It's their vision that shows 
us this world of looming adults, both intimidating and soothing, and unjust 
events that confuse and frighten.

MUSHROOMING GROWTH LEAVES MANY DELIGHTED

Whether you are choosing everyday button mushrooms for your pizza, exotic 
oyster mushrooms for a gourmet salad, or shiitakes for a special sauce, you can 
buy ones grown just down the road in North County. 
</P>
<P>
Exotic and staple varieties of mushrooms are quitely being cultivated from 
Bonsall to Escondido. White button mushrooms are raised in growing beds stacked 
in dark, warehouse-like buildings; oyster mushrooms are grown on trees made of 
straw. 
</P>
<P>
While the white button mushroom has long been a fixture on supermarket shelves, 
several exotic varieties -- such as shiitake, enoki and oyster mushrooms -- are 
now attracting attention. North County growers are finding a market for both 
types in local stores and across the country. 
</P>
<P>
The new-found popularity of the exotic mushroom varieties is due in part to the 
Golden Gourmet Co. in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
The company, in business for just over three years, has become the largest 
supplier of specialty mushrooms, as well as the largest year-round producer of 
oyster mushrooms in the United States. Shiitakes are also being tested for 
large-scale commercial production. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to supplying markets and specialty stores in North County, Golden 
Gourmet ships more than a million pounds of its exotic mushrooms a year to 
supermarket chains nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The crop is grown inside spotless labs as warm and humid as a tropical forest. 
Row upon row of "trees" made of sanitized and steam-cleaned straw mixed with 
millet grain serve as the growing medium for the oyster mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Two or three weeks after the grain is injected with the mycelium, or mushroom 
spores, mushrooms the size of a pinhead begin to sprout. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Ivanovitch is director of the spawn laboratory, research and quality 
control for Golden Gourmet. She has fond memories of mushroom hunts while 
growing up in Yugoslavia. "Mushrooms are very nutritious," she said. "They are 
part of the daily diet in many European countries. I would love to see them 
become as popular among American consumers." 
</P>
<P>
Mushrooms, she said, are high in protein and contain all the essential vitamins 
and minerals. They are also low in calories. "Each mushroom has its own 
identity," she said. The oyster mushroom, which she says tastes a little like 
bacon when sauteed on medium high heat for a few minutes, remains one of her 
favorites. 
</P>
<P>
What: Exotic mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Who: Golden Gourmet Mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Where: P.O. Box 369, San Marcos 
</P>
<P>
Calls: 471-7300. 
</P>
<P>
Sales: Available at most major supermarkets. Oyster mushrooms about $2 for 4 
ounces; shiitake mushrooms about $4 for 3 1/2 ounces; enoki mushrooms about 
$1.80 for 3 1/2 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most common mushroom varieties is the button, or "agaricus 
bisporus," actually a hybrid that was bred for its familiar white color. 
Originally brown, the "white button" was developed to appeal to consumers, 
according to Jeanne Marlowe, microbiologist at the San Luis Rey Mushroom Farm 
in Bonsall. 
</P>
<P>
In a year, the farm produces a million pounds of mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
While Jeanne Marlowe supervises the early stages of production, her husband, 
Alan, manages the later stages of the 23-week mushroom growing cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Marlowe grows her own mushroom spawn rather than buying it from a commercial 
lab. "We make our own spawn because we can better control the quality and also 
because it is much more advantageous commercially," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The spawn is cultivated in test tubes filled with "agar," a gelatin-like 
medium. It takes two weeks to determine if the culture is stable. Production is 
chancy at best: There is no way to predict size or quantity of the eventual 
crop except by careful monitoring of the spawn. 
</P>
<P>
If it passes muster, it is transferred from test tubes to gallon jars filled 
with millet or sorghum to continue developing. Eventually, the spawn is mixed 
with sterilized compost and placed in growing beds. 
</P>
<P>
The farm uses nearby raw materials to create its compost: grape pomace (a grape 
residue) from neighboring vineyards, chicken waste from a chicken farm, 
cottonseed meal and straw from the San Luis Rey Downs stables. (At the end of 
each mushroom harvest, the compost is recycled to area gardeners who line up to 
fill their trucks at $6 a cubic yard.) 
</P>
<P>
The tiny mushrooms, called "pins," must have just the right amount of fresh air 
to allow them to pierce the compost, which has been mixed and pasteurized to 
destroy any detrimental organisms. 
</P>
<P>
During the final growth, clusters of mushrooms develop in the moist darkness, 
transforming the beds into a gray, lunar-looking landscape. The mushrooms are 
then harvested according to size. 
</P>
<P>
What: White button mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Who: San Luis Rey Mushroom Farm. 
</P>
<P>
Where: 1923 Dentro de Loma, Bonsall.

<P>
Sales: Available in local supermarkets and at the farm, where the top grade is 
$1.15 to $1.45 per pound; No. 2 grade, $1 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
White button mushrooms are also the specialty at Mountain Meadow Mushroom farm 
in Escondido. Bob Crouch, who left a career in aerospace to become a mushroom 
grower, took over an established farm six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I got tired of the rat race," he says, "so I bought a mushroom farm. Besides, 
this is much more interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Mountain Meadow produces upwards of 5,000 pounds a day out of 17 growing rooms, 
for distribution to local restaurants and markets. 
</P>
<P>
Mushroom sizes range from the classic button to the extra large variety, ideal 
for stuffing.

HOW TO PICK MUSHROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone contemplating going on a mushroom hunt would do well to join a mushroom 
hunters group or go with a knowledgeable person, advises Betty Ivanovitch of 
Golden Gourmet. 
</P>
<P>
Each mushroom has its own characteristics, which make it difficult for novices 
to distinguish an edible mushroom from a poisonous one. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Farrar, plant manager at Golden Gourmet, offers some advice for judging 
mushrooms for freshness. 
</P>
<P>
Oyster: Make sure the gills underneath look fresh and crisp. Don't worry if the 
mushroom caps have a few cracks. They may change color from white to yellow as 
they age, but these mushrooms keep well for up to 10 days when stored in their 
original container or in a paper bag in the refrigerator. Discard any mushrooms 
that have a slimy feel. 
</P>
<P>
Enoki: Color should be white to off-white and texture should be firm. Enokis 
get spongier as they age. They are usually sold in shrink-wrap packages which 
extend their shelf life to 21 days. Once open, enokis should be consumed within 
a day or two. A slight fermented smell is acceptable when the package is 
opened, but if the mushrooms smell like strong wine they have started to 
decompose. 
</P>
<P>
Shiitake: Stay fresh from 2 to 3 weeks. They turn yellowish as they age, and 
white gills are the best indicators of freshness. Discard any mushrooms with 
sunken or dark spots on the cap.

RESERVISTS' FLIGHT TO GULF: BORING, SCARY AND ENDLESS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Engel, a sometime major and full-time AM-PM Mini Mart mogul, must wonder 
if a jinx has followed him here from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In five days away from home, Engel's first lucky break comes just now, when he 
sits down to lunch just before the Saudi cafeteria line closes for midday 
prayers. Radios have gone on the fritz, switches have failed and his plane 
almost ran out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, sand is gusting 30 miles an hour across the airfield where he plans to 
take off in a few minutes. And his back aches. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you believe it?" he says over lunch. "What else can go wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
Engel is 10,000 miles from home commanding a flight crew of Air Force 
reservists from Southern California. All volunteered to leave their jobs and 
families for about 10 days in November to fly cargo into Saudi Arabia. They 
landed two hours ago with a load of X-ray machines. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Engel, the crew consists of a railroad engineer for Southern Pacific, 
two California state corrections officers, a jet-engine mechanic and a student. 
Tech. Sgt. Jo Ferry, the senior flight engineer -- a veteran of last year's 
Panama invasion and a medical consultant in civilian life -- is the only woman. 
</P>
<P>
Most in the crew have served in the Air Force before. Their unit, the 445th 
Military Airlift Wing at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, has provided 
reserve crews for 93 missions in the massive delivery of American might to the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
For Engel, 47, this is the fourth trip down-range -- Air Force slang for the 
gulf area. The world may view the standoff here as high drama, but for flight 
crews the missions are more grind than excitement. The cockpit seats are mushy 
-- "awful," Engel says. Box lunches and long layovers in old barracks become 
tiresome, and the scenery lacks the richness of the Pacific island runs they 
usually fly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most boring flight in the world," Engel says of the seven-hour 
stretch into Saudi Arabia from Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Now that he is here, Engel is eager to get it over with. Saying goodby to 
10-year-old daughter Shannon is still fresh in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"She looked me in the eye, held my hand and made me promise I wouldn't get 
hurt. That gets to you," Engel says. " . . . Little girls can do that to you." 
</P>
<P>
Engel and the crew fly the aging workhorse of the Military Airlift Command 
fleet, the C-141B Starlifter. Lumbering giants with wings that span 160 feet, 
Starlifters are neither sleek nor comfortable. But more than half the 5,000 
airlift missions into Saudi Arabia have been on the camouflage-painted birds 
Engel calls green lizards. 
</P>
<P>
Crew members like flying the Starlifter. But time and the strain of a 
long-distance airlift running nonstop for nearly four months have sapped the 
plane's dependability, as Engel and crew learn on the mission. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people don't drive cars as old as these airplanes," Engel says. Built by 
Lockheed-Georgia in the mid-1960s, the Starlifter "is a very reliable plane -- 
but it does break down." 
</P>
<P>
Trouble begins almost as soon as the wheels leave the runway at Norton one 
early morning. The plane, the General Lee, is empty except for the crew and six 
passengers. An easy flight is promised to Dobbins Air Force Base outside 
Atlanta, then to New Jersey for a rest stop at McGuire Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
"Got a problem with a bogie on the left," Lt. Col. Ron Fluitt, the co-pilot, 
calmly announces. A warning tab on his panel says the main landing gear on the 
left side did not fully raise. 
</P>
<P>
On a plane this old, the problem may be just a defective warning switch. But if 
the gear indeed is stuck, the crew might have to return to Norton for an 
anxious landing. 
</P>
<P>
Tech. Sgt. Chris Roybal, a flight engineer who monitors the plane's engines and 
physical condition, goes to the cargo bay and peers through a hatch in the 
fuselage. The gear looks OK, he tells Engel. 
</P>
<P>
Over the California desert, Engel calls on Ferry for advice. She was a C-141 
crew chief in the active Air Force and knows the Starlifter more thoroughly 
than anyone on board. Her counsel will be sought frequently as the crew comes 
to regard the mission as snake-bit, if not cursed. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry suggests to Engel that he could recycle the gear -- lower, then raise it 
again -- to see if the warning signal corrects itself. Regulations allow the 
mission to continue, but it's his call, she advises. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot decides to press on. "It is probably just a bad micro-switch," he 
says. Ferry concurs, but she leaves the flight deck to make her own inspection. 
When she returns, Engel asks for a prognosis. "Let me think about it," she 
answers, then buries her head in a manual. 
</P>
<P>
Cruising at 41,000 feet, with three hours before landing in Georgia, the pilots 
relax. Most actual flying is done by the inertial navigation system. It senses 
the plane's movement and the wind, then makes minute adjustments to the 
controls to keep the aircraft on course. 
</P>
<P>
Engel and Fluitt have not flown together in a long time and use the time to 
catch up on personal news. 
</P>
<P>
Fluitt, also 47, is an engineer at the Southern Pacific railroad yard in West 
Colton. He flew C-141s in the Air Force, and these reserve missions constitute 
the only flying he does anymore. He is the crew member most enchanted with the 
cockpit scenery, and he comments on the red sliver of moon that rises in the 
windshield. 
</P>
<P>
Engel's grandfather was a flier in World War I, and his father was killed 
flying in World War II. A Tustin native, Engel was on active duty for seven 
years and dropped bombs on Vietnam from B-52s. He also flew secret observation 
missions over Laos. "There were no numbers on the airplanes," Engel says of 
Laos, "and we flew in blue jeans." 
</P>
<P>
He opted out of the Air Force in 1973. "I just got real tired of being in 
'Nam," he says. After getting a master's degree and spending 14 years with Bank 
of America, he took the franchise three years ago on a busy AM-PM Mini Mart in 
Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Engel may be one of the few Americans deployed on Operation Desert Shield whose 
livelihood -- the gas station -- is entwined with the world oil market. But he 
didn't volunteer out of self-interest, he says; nor is a lust to fight Iraqi 
leader Saddam Hussein a motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm past that," Engel says. "I spent too many years in Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
He volunteered, he says, because his country made the decision to prepare for 
war. "I wanted to help out," Engel says. "It's my duty to the unit, to the 
military, to everybody who is involved." 
</P>
<P>
The landing gear flaw does prove to be the suspected micro-switch. The crew 
lands without incident in Georgia to pick up the load for the next leg -- 11 
Army reservists being mobilized for the Persian Gulf. Many are middle-aged. All 
are secretive about their specialized unit. 
</P>
<P>
Before takeoff, a new glitch is found in the General Lee. The cowling on the 
number three engine is stuck open. It takes three hours and a phone call back 
to Norton to cinch it shut. For the first time, the possibility is mentioned 
that the mission is jinxed. 
</P>
<P>
"Some planes seem to be no problem," says co-pilot Fluitt, waiting impatiently 
on the flight deck. "Others, well . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The flight to New Jersey goes more smoothly. The General Lee and her cargo are 
turned over there to a fresh crew for delivery down-range. Engel and the Norton 
crew must rest at least 12 hours before they will be assigned another 
Saudi-bound C-141. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some bases, the quarters at McGuire are welcomed -- private rooms in a 
Days Inn off the base. With scores of flight crews deployed on Operation Desert 
Shield, shared rooms are common. Ferry drew a room on the men's floor of a 
barracks on one mission. "I had to go to the third-floor latrine for some 
privacy," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Planes are late coming in, and the 12-hour rest grows past 24 hours. The crew 
becomes restless. Engel delights in roller coasters and spied a good one on the 
landing approach, but it is closed for the winter. Ferry goes for a run in the 
central New Jersey countryside. 
</P>
<P>
On the second night in New Jersey, the crew finally draws a plane. The flight 
across the Atlantic should take about eight hours. American bases are located 
in Spain, Germany and England, among other places. Defense Department rules 
forbid disclosing the exact staging country, despite the non-sensitive cargo -- 
mail for the troops. 
</P>
<P>
As the U.S. coast slips behind, the talk turns to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Engel's three trips down-range are the most of any crew member. First time in, 
he was told to expect dry heat but was misinformed. "It was so humid," Engel 
says. "It's horrible." 
</P>
<P>
Fluitt has been down-range once, Ferry twice. On her first trip to the gulf 
area, flight crews were required to carry flak jackets and survival gear. Now 
that airfields are secured, the heavy gear is not required. The most essential 
extra gear on the plane now consists of blankets for the long nights in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry is reticent with personal details, including her age. She spent six years 
on active duty, time she used to travel overland in the Middle East from her 
base in Turkey. She has flown volunteer reserve missions for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"I have my own business, so I have control of my time," Ferry says. "My family 
has gotten used to it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Engel and Ferry agree to try massaging the military bureaucracy to get 
the crew home in under 10 days. Everyone has work waiting for them. Engel's gas 
station manager, a Pakistani Muslim who did not relish his boss flying off to 
fight the Iraqis, is reliable -- "but he's not the owner," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Midway across the Atlantic a new problem arises, this one partly of Engel's 
making. Instead of flying at 41,000 feet, the plane's most efficient altitude, 
the crew is assigned 29,000 feet. The jets burn more fuel -- much more -- at 
the lower level. Bad weather or a landing delay could leave them short. 
</P>
<P>
About 250 miles from the airport, Tech. Sgt. Edward Kingcade, one of two 
loadmasters on board -- both state correctional officers -- pours himself a 
bowl of Rice Krispies in the cargo bay. Up front on the flight deck, the pilots 
advise the ground that they need to land as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Should the fuel go below 10,000 (pounds), I want you to tell me immediately," 
Engel barks to a flight engineer -- one of his few instructions on the mission 
to carry the tone of a direct order. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty miles out, Engel peers into a haze. He is tense. "Anybody see anything 
that looks like a runway out there?" he asks of everyone on the flight deck. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, the plane turns onto final approach with about 10,000 
pounds still in the fuel tanks. Relieved, Engel lands in Europe without a bump. 
Ferry keys her mike: "Nice job, pilot." 
</P>
<P>
But Engel is upset with himself for not insisting that more fuel be loaded in 
New Jersey. "I hate it when I do that," he says. "I'm a sweaty mess. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Fuel gauges on the old planes are notoriously imprecise, so the crew isn't sure 
exactly how close they came to running dry. "You know, 10,000 pounds sounds 
like a lot unless you're in the air," Fluitt says. 
</P>
<P>
From Europe, the flight down-range makes for a long day. It is at least seven 
hours to Saudi Arabia, an hour longer coming out due to winds, with about three 
hours on the ground between legs. 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of adrenaline flows on the trip down to Saudi Arabia. The transponder 
that beeps codes to inform ground radar that the Starlifter is a friendly 
aircraft failed over the Middle East. Engel is advised to return to Europe 
rather than risk overflying the Arab world unprotected, but the fuel is too 
low. Landing at Cairo is rejected because of zero visibility. 
</P>
<P>
Engel finally picks his way to an airfield beside the Persian Gulf with 
guidance from Navy ships in the Gulf and Red Sea. Crew members get three hours 
on the ground to eat, stretch their legs and make a quick inspection of the 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
During the taxi to takeoff -- the first leg toward home -- Engel's navigation 
system abruptly dies. Buttons are pushed and circuit breakers tripped. Nothing. 
"OK, anybody got any ideas?" Engel asks. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Engel taxis back to the parking ramp and shuts down the engines, 
frustrated. "Oh, man . . . " he mutters. "Remember when I said at lunch, 'What 
else can go wrong'? Well, next time I say that . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The problem turns out to be a bad circuit breaker that takes 10 minutes to 
replace. 
</P>
<P>
The flight out is routine. But in Europe, bad news awaits. Instead of flying 
home as they wished, the crew is tapped for a second mission to Saudi Arabia. 
Engel appeals to 21st Air Force headquarters, but the crew is needed. 
</P>
<P>
"They more or less ordered us to do it," Engel says. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the long Saudi trip is uneventful. The crew delivers classified 
cargo to a desert airstrip close to the front lines, then high-tails for 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the 21st Air Force is sympathetic. After a rest stop of 24 hours -- time 
for a little sightseeing and a relaxed dinner -- the crew flies to Charleston, 
S.C., and on to Travis Air Force Base near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
A plane is dispatched from Norton to fetch them home. They land in San 
Bernardino late on a Wednesday night, nine days after first taking off in the 
General Lee. 
</P>
<P>
Flight engineer Roybal is home in time for his son's first birthday. Engel's 
store and gas station survived his absence. The neighborhood gangs and the kids 
who boldly swipe six packs of beer were kept at bay. In fact, he's in the 
market for a second Mini Mart. 
</P>
<P>
Engel wrote letters for five years to get in the reserves. Promotion to 
lieutenant colonel may be coming next year, and he plans to stay "until they 
kick me out." The mission's troubles are already fading from his mind.

L.A.'S HIRING FREEZE IS EXPANDED TO POLICE; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: FIREFIGHTER AND SANITATION JOBS ALSO ARE FROZEN FOR 7 MONTHS AS THE 
CITY'S FINANCIAL CRISIS DEEPENS.

<P>
As one of the bloodiest years in Los Angeles history draws to a close, Mayor 
Tom Bradley on Wednesday ordered an emergency, seven-month freeze on hiring 
police officers and other city personnel to cope with a deepening, 
recession-driven city financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The order, which also encompasses fire and sanitation workers, follows a 
warning earlier this week from the city's top budget watchdog that Los Angeles 
faces a $120-million budget deficit over the next 18 months if cost-cutting 
measures are not implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials coping with a homicide rate that has already topped 800 said 
cutbacks may mean that response times will again creep upward and that officers 
will have less time to patrol the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt . . . the city needs more police officers," Deputy Mayor 
Mark Fabiani said. "But all city departments, including the Police Department, 
are going to have to be more efficient. This is a moderate step that will 
prevent more drastic steps later." 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, saying he was concerned by the mayor's action, 
criticized the city's budget planning. "This money crunch should have been 
anticipated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gates said the Police Department will do its part to reduce costs "if the 
city indeed is building an indebtedness." 
</P>
<P>
Other police officials said the hiring freeze, which by next July will shrink 
the 8,400-officer force by 150 to 200 through attrition, could have serious 
long-term consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"That will kill us. . . . We're going to set a (homicide) record this year . . 
. the timing is terrible," LAPD Assistant Police Chief Jesse Brewer said. 
</P>
<P>
Brewer said the freeze likely will mean it could take police longer to respond 
to emergency calls. The department -- with the addition of 1,500 officers over 
the last six years -- had just recently reached its goal of responding to 
emergencies in an average of seven minutes. Brewer also said that as job 
vacancies mount, officers will have less time to patrol neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just now getting the department to a level where we think we can 
provide some adequate level of protection," Brewer said. 
</P>
<P>
Some community leaders in crime-plagued sections of Los Angeles reacted with 
outrage at the prospect of fewer officers patrolling the streets. Others 
welcomed the prospect that controversial and costly programs, such as anti-gang 
sweeps, will be re-evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's incomprehensible," said Lou Negrete, a senior leader with the 
Eastside-based United Neighborhoods Organization. "Our community is already 
swamped by crime . . . gangs control the streets. If violence and crime 
continue to go up, we'll never catch up." 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Ridley-Thomas, executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of the 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said that the buildup of the 
department's manpower has not curbed crime anyway. He said the budget squeeze 
offers a "very, very ripe" time for city officials "to look more creatively at 
how the limited resources . . . can be most effectively used." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's freeze on police hiring is another sign that the city is suffering 
from an economic downturn because of lower tax collections. 
</P>
<P>
"It's called a recession and it's going on across the country," said Keith 
Comrie, city administrative officer, who recommended the hiring freeze. 
</P>
<P>
With the city's major sources of revenue closely tied to real estate and 
business transactions, the economic slump has hit fast and hard, city analysts 
said. In the current fiscal year, taxes tied to business incomes will be off 
$7.3 million from what was projected, sales tax collections will be off $5.2 
million and fees for new construction permits and real estate transfers will be 
down about $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
All together, Comrie predicts a $20 million shortfall in city income in the 
current fiscal year and up to $100 million in 1991-92. 
</P>
<P>
The budget problems were evident earlier this year when Bradley and the City 
Council imposed nearly $60 million in new taxes and placed a hiring freeze on 
most departments. Officials had hoped to spare police, fire and sanitation 
departments, but because they are so substantial, Bradley was forced to include 
them, Fabiani said. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani said that even with the loss of 200 officers over the next seven 
months, the police force will still be the largest ever in the department's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
But police officials note that the population of Los Angeles has grown rapidly 
in recent years and that gang shootings and other street violence have 
increased. Homicides in the city are running 17% ahead of last year and are 
approaching the all-time high of 1,028 in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani and Comrie said the depth and duration of the recession will determine 
how long the police hiring freeze will have to be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's action did not come as a surprise to City Council members, who have 
been receiving gloomy financial forecasts for months. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi downplayed the significance of the mayor's move. 
</P>
<P>
"This is almost a ritual, as long as I can remember, whether it was Yorty or 
Bradley," said Bernardi, a 29-year council veteran. "We don't have a budget 
crunch, we have a priority crunch. . . . All these warnings, all these threats 
about the dire consequences we're going to be faced with, that's a lot of 
malarkey." 
</P>
<P>
However, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the Budget and Finance 
Committee, repeated warnings he has issued over the last several months. 
</P>
<P>
"The freeze is one of a series of steps necessary to get us through this fiscal 
year and preserve what limited options we have for next year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and the council must now take additional steps, Yaroslavsky said, 
including a freeze on equipment purchases, cutbacks in departmental programs 
and deferral of capital improvements and other projects. 
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental message is that the city must stop spending beyond its means 
in order to avoid massive tax and fee increases, and/or layoffs during the next 
18 months," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the fire and sanitation departments said Wednesday that they had 
just begun assessing the effects of the hiring freeze.

MAJOR PLEDGES OPPORTUNITY FOR BRITONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Major replaced Margaret Thatcher as Britain's prime minister Wednesday and 
promised to preside over a Conservative government that would create "a society 
of opportunity -- an open society." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of his first day in office, the new prime minister announced a broad 
restructuring of the Cabinet designed to lead a strong, united government into 
the next election against the Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
Although few of the ministers were fired, Major put a fresh face on the Cabinet 
and made a strong gesture toward party unity, following the bitter infighting 
of the past month, by including in his government the two men who had been his 
strongest rivals for the party leadership. 
</P>
<P>
He retained as his foreign secretary Douglas Hurd, 60, who ran third in the 
Tory party balloting Tuesday. And he named as his environment minister Michael 
Heseltine, 57, his closest runner-up in the race and the man whose challenge to 
Thatcher for leadership of the Conservatives last week staggered the prime 
minister and ultimately led to her resignation. 
</P>
<P>
To fill his old exchequer post, the equivalent of U.S. Treasury secretary, 
Major named Norman Lamont, who had been his top treasury aide and who ran 
Major's short campaign for the Tory leadership. He retained Tom King as defense 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old Major, a Thatcher protege, is Britain's youngest prime minister 
in this century. 
</P>
<P>
After accepting the seal of office from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham 
Palace, the tall, gray-haired Major stood on the steps of 10 Downing St. with 
his wife, Norma, and declared that "a decade of the most remarkable 
opportunities" lay ahead of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see us build a country that is at ease with itself," he said, "a 
country that is confident and a country that is able and willing to build a 
better quality of life for all its citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to counter charges that Britain is less than a full-fledged member of 
the European Community, Major declared that the nation will play a "full and 
leading role" in building "an entirely new Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Major paid tribute to the 65-year-old Thatcher, who left office after 11 1/2 
years as prime minister, the longest term in this century. He called her a 
"towering" leader who "left our country in a far better condition than she 
found it." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, wearing a plum-colored suit, tendered her resignation to the queen at 
Buckingham Palace on Wednesday morning, a day after the Conservative Party 
elected Major its leader and six days after she announced her intention to step 
down. 
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented series of party events, Thatcher failed to get the 
necessary majority in a leadership vote among Tory members of Parliament eight 
days ago, and she quit rather than face the prospect of a humiliating defeat in 
Tuesday's second round. 
</P>
<P>
Major, her personal favorite, entered the race and ran ahead of Heseltine, a 
former defense secretary, and Foreign Secretary Hurd, who both then conceded 
the leadership to him Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Thatcher wished Major "all the luck in the world" and said, "He 
has the makings of a great prime minister, and I am sure he will be in a very 
short time."

<P>
Then, fighting back tears, she and her husband, Denis, left No. 10 for good. 
</P>
<P>
In the new Cabinet, it will be Lamont's task to reduce inflation and interest 
rates and avoid a recession. 
</P>
<P>
In Major's other appointments, Home Secretary David Waddington was moved to the 
House of Lords as party leader in the upper chamber, and Tory Party Chairman 
Kenneth Baker was shifted to the Home Office. 
</P>
<P>
Environment Secretary Christopher Patten, one of the younger Cabinet stars, was 
made party chairman to tighten up the ranks of the Conservatives, who have 
suffered from by-election defeats and internal wrangling. He will direct the 
campaign for the next general election against the opposition Labor Party, 
which must be held within 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
That opened the environment portfolio for Heseltine, who held the same job in 
Thatcher's first Cabinet in 1979. It is a complex office with the 
responsibility for local planning and for administering the controversial local 
tax known as the community charge, or poll tax. 
</P>
<P>
Heseltine has been critical of the tax, which has proved to be the most 
unpopular domestic measure. Major has promised to review it. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in 25 years, there is no woman in the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock, who had been witheringly critical of Major's 
predecessor, said Wednesday that the new prime minister was "just about as 
extreme and dangerous as Margaret Thatcher." 
</P>
<P>
Major left his residence at 11 Downing St. as chancellor on Wednesday morning 
after Thatcher resigned, spent 30 minutes with the queen, and then went next 
door to take up residence at 10 Downing, the prime minister's office and 
private residence. 
</P>
<P>
In calling for an open society in which people have wide opportunities, Major, 
a high school dropout, declared: 
</P>
<P>
"I do not promise you that it will be easy, and I do not promise you that it 
will be quick, but I believe it is an immensely worthwhile job to do."

SALT OF THE EARTH; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S HARVEST TIME AT BAY AREA PONDS WHERE NATURE TURNS WATER INTO BRINE

<P>
Creeping slowly down another arrow-straight row, the giant harvester deftly 
snatches the crop from the ground and spits it, two tons at a time, into a 
train of railroad hopper cars lined up alongside. 
</P>
<P>
The sun is setting, but the harvest will continue -- 24 hours a day, seven days 
a week. As with many other crops, rain is the enemy here and forecasters warn 
of imminent showers. 
</P>
<P>
But this is no ordinary crop of avocados or artichokes, zinnias or zucchini. 
The small army of seasonal workers is reaping a totally inorganic bounty: salt. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the most unusual forms of "farming" in agriculturally diverse 
California, the Leslie Salt Co. pulls more than 1 million tons of salt each 
year from tens of thousands of acres of evaporation ponds along the southern 
and northernmost parts of San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to accounting for about 5% of all U.S. salt production, the 
company's evaporation ponds comprise an important habitat for birds and other 
animals that have been hurt by the loss of most of California's wetlands to 
development and farming. 
</P>
<P>
About 12,000 acres of the company's 40,000 acres of ponds make up the bulk of 
the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge. With the varying salinity of 
the ponds supplying a variety of food, such as brine shrimp, the salt farm has 
become an important nesting area for the white pelican, Caspian tern, 
black-necked stilt and other species. 
</P>
<P>
"As the salinity increases, different life forms take over the ponds," said 
public affairs manager Lori A. Johnson. "At each stage, this attracts different 
bird species, many of which we wouldn't find here otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie is the bigger of the nation's only two remaining major "solar salt" 
producers -- those who produce salt by evaporating sea water in open salt ponds 
using only the sun and wind. The other, Western Salt Co. near San Diego, 
produces a small fraction of the annual Leslie harvest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty simple process, probably the oldest method in the world for 
collecting salt," said Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The process begins each summer, when the bay water is saltiest because 
fresh-water rivers and streams emptying into it are at their lowest flows. 
Thousands of acres of shallow, irregularly shaped ponds are flooded, and the 
sun and wind begin evaporating the water. 
</P>
<P>
Over five years, the increasingly salty brine is transferred, mostly by gravity 
and some pumping, through a series of new ponds ever closer to processing 
plants in Newark and Redwood City and south of Napa. 
</P>
<P>
When about 90% of the water has been removed, the resulting liquid, called 
"pickle," is sent to several shallow, 40-acre crystallizer beds where the salt 
crystals grow on compacted-clay liners. In the fall, a 5- to 8-inch-thick crust 
of 99% pure salt lines the pits and the highly automated harvest begins. 
</P>
<P>
Rain during the harvest months of September, October and November can dissolve 
the salt crystals, so the harvest runs nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
Giant mobile harvesters -- which look like grain harvesters and were built by 
Leslie employees -- scrape the salt from the ground, grind it up to the size of 
pencil erasers and then pour it into miniature railroad hopper cars on movable 
tracks. The tracks are shifted every time the harvesters scrape a 12-foot-wide 
path through the rectangular crystallizer beds. 
</P>
<P>
In the processing plant, the salt is briefly washed with brine to remove the 
pinkish stain left by microorganisms that flourish in the brackish pickle. The 
salt is then piped onto distinctive snow-white, 90-foot-high "stacks," or 
piles, where it is left to dry for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Other salt-production techniques -- such as carving it from salt mines, 
dissolving underground deposits in water which is evaporated on the surface, or 
boiling it out of seawater in factories -- produce salt that requires 
additional refining, Johnson said. Other big salt-producing states are 
Louisiana, Kansas, Oklahoma and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said most of the 1.2 million tons of salt to be harvested from the bay 
each year requires no additional refinement because the solar process produces 
salt that is 99% pure. The raw salt is sold for such industrial uses as pulp- 
and paper-making, textile manufacturing and chlorine-bleach production, as well 
as salt licks for livestock. 
</P>
<P>
The small fraction of salt used for food production -- sold to canners, soup 
manufacturers, cheese makers, hospitals and restaurants -- is refined to remove 
most of the 1% of metallic salts that remain in the crystals after they are 
harvested. Table salt, which accounts for only 3% of all production, is 99.9% 
pure sodium chloride, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Ohlone Indians drew salt from San Francisco Bay for centuries by evaporating 
bay water in natural tide pools, Johnson said. Commercial salt production did 
not begin until 1854, when a man named John Johnson (no relation to Lori 
Johnson) diked off a small part of the bay near Newark -- on land still used 
for salt production by Leslie -- and reaped a harvest he was able to sell for 
the then-lucrative price of $50 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
Competitors soon followed Johnson in this profitable field, and increased 
production quickly dropped the price to $2 a ton. But the business persisted, 
and even though a series of mergers has left the bay with only one producer, it 
still pulls salt from the sea in basically the same way as the Ohlone. 
</P>
<P>
"We prefer to think of it here as 'harvesting' salt rather than 'mining' 
because in mining you come in and take something that will never come back," 
she said. "We really harvest a crop every year. When you take it from the sea, 
salt is a renewable resource."

GUN OWNERS FIRE VOLLEY AT BUREAUCRATS;

<P>
REGISTRATION: THEY SAY EFFORTS TO OBEY LAW ON POSSESSING SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS 
WERE MET WITH RUDENESS AND LACK OF COOPERATION.

<P>
Owners of assault guns angrily protested Wednesday that they have tried to obey 
a law that requires them to register their weapons but were prevented from 
doing so by rude and uncooperative law enforcement bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
A state Department of Justice official conceded that administrative foul-ups 
had occurred and promised to immediately streamline the process so citizens can 
more easily comply with the Dec. 31 registration deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Drake, whose Bureau of Justice Information Services handles registration 
of legally acquired assault guns, said requests for registration documents can 
be sent directly to his office and applications will be processed as promptly 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone is really trying and cannot get the information, we will mail it to 
them," Drake said. 
</P>
<P>
Under California's landmark "Assault Weapons Control Act," owners of legally 
obtained assault guns must register them by Dec. 31 or face a $350 fine for the 
first violation and stiffer fines or jail sentences for subsequent offenses. 
</P>
<P>
The registration provision of the 1989 law was intended to enable law-abiding 
owners of legal semiautomatic military-style combat weapons to keep them even 
though the law's main intent was to ban their importation, manufacture, 
distribution, sale and transfer. The prohibition provisions took effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Only 5,150 assault weapons have been registered in California since the law was 
signed in May, 1989. Although no one can be certain, the National Rifle Assn. 
and the Justice Department believe there are about 300,000 such weapons in 
private hands statewide. 
</P>
<P>
A top-level official of the National Rifle Assn. suggested Tuesday that the 
meager number of registrations reflected a mounting expression of civil 
disobedience by California assault gun owners who believe the state law 
violates their constitutional right to keep and bear arms. 
</P>
<P>
But assault gun owners throughout Southern California swamped The Times with 
telephone calls on Wednesday, insisting they were not part of any civil 
disobedience. They asserted that local police and sheriff's offices and the 
state Department of Justice itself thwarted repeated attempts to register their 
firearms. 
</P>
<P>
In several cases, the callers said they tried to obtain the forms from police 
and sheriff's stations in Los Angeles County, but were told no such materials 
existed. Calls to the state Department of Justice were met by rude and 
unhelpful answers, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are citizens, not criminals," one caller told a reporter. "We're asking for 
help. I feel like saying, 'well, stuff it. I'm not registering my weapons.' " 
</P>
<P>
An owner of an Uzi assault carbine seeking information said he was told by an 
employee answering the department's telephone that his gun couldn't possibly be 
registered by Dec. 31. "That makes me illegal, doesn't it?" the caller said he 
asked. "She said, 'It certainly does.' " 
</P>
<P>
All callers to The Times asked not to be identified because they feared their 
homes would be burglarized for guns. Some also said they believed they might 
encounter trouble from law enforcement authorities for complaining. 
</P>
<P>
Under the registration procedure, gun owners are told they can obtain 
registration materials at local police and sheriff's offices and must provide a 
thumbprint. The materials plus a $20 check for handling fees then must be sent 
to the Justice Department in Sacramento, which is then supposed to send a 
letter acknowledging receipt of the forms and follow up with a second letter as 
"your proof of assault gun registration." 
</P>
<P>
Drake said it was a daunting task to develop and implement the first-ever 
assault gun registration program and that snafus occurred, particularly at 
large police and sheriff's departments. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, a crate of registration forms was sent to the 
headquarters of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department last Christmas "and 
just sat there until somebody realized, 'Oh, gee, we've got to get these out.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, Drake said, local law enforcement agencies balked at performing 
the extra work and some substations and precinct branches never received the 
forms from their headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Told of the caller complaints, Drake said: "I have great sympathy and regret 
it. We did the best we could do. We were working with 440 police departments 
and 58 sheriff's departments." 
</P>
<P>
Drake said if gun owners cannot obtain materials at local police and sheriff's 
agencies, they can write to the Department of Justice, Automated Firearms 
System, P.O. Box 903417, Sacramento, Calif. 94203-4170 or call (916) 739-2773.

GOVERNOR CALLS SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE SESSION; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: HE HOPES TO PUSH HIS PLAN TO CUT $1 BILLION IN STATE SPENDING. HE ALSO 
CRITICIZES LAWMAKERS FOR WANTING TO DELAY ACTION UNTIL PETE WILSON IS SWORN IN.

<P>
Hoping to force action on his midyear plan to cut $1 billion in state spending, 
lame-duck Gov. George Deukmejian on Wednesday called a special session of the 
Legislature for next week and chided lawmakers for wanting to await the next 
governor before resolving California's budgetary problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the public expects and deserves action now," Deukmejian said in a 
special message to the Legislature. Later, he told reporters, "I am a full-time 
governor, we have a full-time Legislature. . . . The people did not send us 
here simply to delay or duck current problems." 
</P>
<P>
In his message, Deukmejian argued for quick action on his budget plan, pointing 
to worsening economic conditions that fiscal analysts say could lead to a 
deficit in the current year's $55.7-billion budget and produce a shortfall of 
at least $4.3 billion in next year's spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
Majority party Democrats have greeted Deukmejian's plan unenthusiastically, 
saying that they would prefer to deal with California's next governor, Pete 
Wilson, after he is sworn in Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's decision to call a special session reflects, in part, the 
frustrations felt by many lame-duck administrators as their power seems to wane 
and their proposals are taken less seriously. In this case, Deukmejian also 
faces the prospect of leaving California with a huge deficit -- a particularly 
vexing situation for a governor who often bragged about taking the state from 
"IOU to A-OK." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Legislature refuses to act on his request for deep spending cuts, 
by calling the special session Deukmejian could shift some of the blame for the 
deficit to uncooperative Democratic lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators already were scheduled to return to Sacramento next Monday and 
Tuesday to elect new officers and organize the 1991-92 legislative session. The 
special session to be held at the same time will enable lawmakers to take up 
and pass bills immediately. During regular sessions, a 30-day waiting period is 
required before debate on legislation may begin. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition centers mostly on two key parts of the governor's plan: to suspend 
guarantees for public school financing approved by voters as Proposition 98 and 
slash $526 million from school budgets and a recommendation to cut renters 
credits by $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), chairman of the Assembly Ways 
and Means Committee, said Wednesday, "We have a new governor. This guy 
(Deukmejian) chose not to run; he's finished. Let's let the new guy show his 
colors." 
</P>
<P>
One of the problems Deukmejian will face next week is that he has established 
little good will with the Legislature during his eight years as governor. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Wilson made a personal visit to the office of Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) Wednesday -- the kind of courtesy call that 
Deukmejian never made. Wilson requested the talk and he went into the meeting 
unaccompanied by aides just as Deukmejian was announcing his call for a special 
session. In recent weeks, Wilson paid similar visits to Senate Republican 
Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno and Assembly GOP Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting in the Speaker's office, Brown spokesman Michael Reese said 
the lawmaker was delighted by the visit. "It was an appreciated gesture," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Reese said Brown would prefer to deal with Wilson on budget issues. But he 
noted that the Speaker on Wednesday canceled a European vacation so he can be 
in Sacramento if necessary. "He will be here Monday, as planned, and will look 
anew at the proposals," Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) said through a spokesman, 
"We have taken the governor's proposals under advisement." Roberti has 
instructed Senate budget and fiscal committees to conduct hearings on the 
governor's budget proposals, but earlier he indicated that the general feeling 
among Senate Democrats was to wait until January. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian got support from Maddy. "This is a sincere effort on the part of 
Gov. Deukmejian to solve this budget crisis, and the Legislature should 
respond," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson spokesman Bill Livingstone also was encouraging. "The budget looks worse 
and worse," he said. "If the governor and Legislature can contribute to 
resolving the problem, it's in the state's interest." 
</P>
<P>
The governor's call for a special session came as some Capitol budget analysts 
were bracing for more bad news. 
</P>
<P>
Controller Gray Davis today is expected to release a final accounting of the 
1989-90 fiscal year that will show Deukmejian Administration budget officials 
as having overestimated the year-end balance. 
</P>
<P>
And the staff of Legislative Analyst Elizabeth G. Hill reportedly is preparing 
a new budget analysis for the Legislature that suggests that next year's 
shortfall could be much worse than the $4.3-billion gap predicted last week in 
a report by the Commission on State Finance. That report was put together 
before it was known that tax receipts had suffered a sharp $200-million drop in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
During his news conference, Deukmejian acknowledged that the problem could grow 
beyond the projected $4.3-billion shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
Chief of Staff Michael R. Frost said after the governor's news conference, 
"Prudence would say (tax collections are) headed down. We had three months that 
were bad, and then we had October, which was disastrous." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he could not force the Legislature to act. But, he said, 
"they're going to recognize and want to recognize their responsibility in this 
area." Noting that voters this month passed Proposition 140 to limit the terms 
of legislators, the governor said he thought "the Legislature is concerned 
about its image." 
</P>
<P>
But education officials who led the drive to pass Proposition 98 in 1988 urged 
lawmakers to wait until Wilson takes office. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said it is unfair to cut so deeply into 
schools now when the overall budget problem seems much bigger. "Why single out 
schools now for a partial solution when you really don't have an idea of what 
the total problem is yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Foglia, president of the California Teachers Assn., said, "No one is going 
to solve this budgetary shortfall in two or three days with a crisis 
mentality."

INVESTIGATION CLOSED IN CASE OF FROZEN HEAD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors have quietly closed their investigation into the death of Dora 
Kent, the elderly woman whose head was cut off and frozen by a Riverside 
cryonics laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
The Riverside County district attorney's office had hoped to file homicide 
charges in the 1987 death of Kent, whose head was severed at Alcor Life 
Extension Foundation and placed in a tank of liquid nitrogen in hopes that 
science would one day reanimate her with a new body. 
</P>
<P>
But Asst. Dist. Atty. Don Inskeep said the inquiry into the bizarre case, which 
focused nationwide attention on the controversial freezing technique known as 
cryonics, was hampered by a lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"We evaluated all the evidence there was and there simply wasn't enough for us 
to prosecute," Inskeep said Wednesday. "There wasn't a likelihood that more 
would develop, so the case is closed." 
</P>
<P>
At Alcor, research director Mike Darwin called the decision "a wonderful 
Christmas present that is long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
"This was a terrible injustice and it has meant three years of fear and anxiety 
for us," Darwin said, noting that investigators once threatened to thaw out 
seven heads and a body stored at the laboratory. "Any time you are accused of 
grand theft, homicide and other untruths it is damaging to you both personally 
and professionally." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it seems Alcor has not suffered financially. Darwin said the laboratory 
has 16 "patients" -- 10 heads and six bodies -- in so-called cryonic suspension 
today. That is double the number in storage in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Darwin added, another 200 foundation members "have made full legal 
and financial arrangements for suspension" at the time of their death. 
</P>
<P>
The strange saga of Kent's head began in late 1987, when the ailing 83-year-old 
woman was moved from a convalescent home to Alcor by her son, Saul Kent, a 
devotee of cryonics. Alcor officials said that after Kent died a natural death 
Dec. 11, her head was surgically removed. 
</P>
<P>
After Alcor applied for a permit to cremate Kent's headless body, the Riverside 
County coroner's office launched an investigation, noting that the woman was 
not under a doctor's care at the time of her death. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators sought the right to defrost and examine Kent's head, but a 
Superior Court judge ruled that would be an unconstitutional infringement on a 
person's right to choose how to dispose of his or her remains. 
</P>
<P>
Even without examining the head, however, Coroner Raymond Carillo ruled that 
toxicological tests on Kent's body tissues revealed her death was a homicide, 
resulting from a lethal dose of a barbiturate. 
</P>
<P>
Alcor officials conceded that the drug Nembutol was administered, but insisted 
it was used after her death to help preserve brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
They also called Carillo's investigation a "witch hunt" and "vicious smear 
campaign." Carillo, who has come under fire for his handling of several other 
prominent cases over the last several years, lost a reelection bid Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of cryonics believe that future technology will make it possible to 
revive the frozen dead. When only a head is preserved, the expectation is that 
a body will be cloned to match it. 
</P>
<P>
Most medical experts dismiss cryonics as at best a fantasy, and at worst a 
moneymaking scam. 
</P>
<P>
Darwin said Alcor is pursuing a civil lawsuit against Riverside County over the 
arrest of staff members and two raids on its facility.

GERMANY GEARS UP TO HELP FEED SOVIETS; 
</P>
<P>
RELIEF: THE EMERGENCY EFFORT RIDES A GROUNDSWELL OF PUBLIC SUPPORT.

<P>
Amid a groundswell of public support, a major German effort was under way 
Wednesday to send emergency food supplies to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The relief program, involving the German federal and states' governments, more 
than 10 volunteer agencies and a growing number of private businesses, comes in 
response to reports that with the onset of winter in the Soviet Union, serious 
food shortages threaten to cause widespread suffering. 
</P>
<P>
Both Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher went on 
national television Wednesday night to urge their compatriots to take part in 
the assistance program. 
</P>
<P>
"Please help reduce the emergency in the Soviet Union," Kohl told viewers. 
"This is an act of charity and above all a work of good neighborliness." 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Kohl reminded the Germans that it was Soviet leader Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev "who, in the most decisive months, helped the Germans achieve 
their unity." 
</P>
<P>
With no central distribution or collection points, the size of the emergency 
effort is difficult to define, although initial signs are that it is already 
substantial and is likely to grow in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
An official from the Workers Samaritan League, one of the many volunteer 
organizations involved in the effort, reported Wednesday that in Hamburg alone, 
more than 100,000 food packages had been prepared for shipment to Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
"The flood of packages that has come in has completely exceeded our 
predictions," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Actions by German newspapers, magazine publishing houses and television 
stations have in recent days lifted the effort to the level of a national 
crusade, each urging its readers or viewers to join in. 
</P>
<P>
"Winter has come early and everything is short -- bread, butter, meat and 
margarine," a reporter from Second German Television (ZDF) told viewers 
Wednesday. "We'll show you how to give and what will happen to your money. 
We'll show you how you can help build friendship between Germans and Russians." 
</P>
<P>
A plea for help made late last week by the mass-circulation tabloid paper Bild 
Zeitung has already generated an estimated 10,000 packages, according to relief 
officials, while the Munich-based publishing group Burda announced that it 
planned to give the equivalent of $300,000 to a campaign launched with its 
rival weekly Stern magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl on Tuesday dispatched his closest foreign policy adviser, Horst Teltschik, 
to Moscow to coordinate the arrival and distribution of the food aid and to 
work with Soviet authorities to assure that it reaches those most in need. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviets immediately established a coordinating center for the aid 
with representatives from no fewer than 15 government ministries, Teltschik 
emerged from a meeting with Gorbachev on Wednesday confident that the 
distribution could be carried out in a fair and orderly manner. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got the impression from the Soviet side that there is an awareness of 
the problems that need to be resolved," Teltschik said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to German federal government help, several German state governments 
have set aside funds to pay for transporting and distributing food packages, 
valued at up to $60 each. 
</P>
<P>
The extensive assistance effort is filled with historical ironies. 
</P>
<P>
The German branch of the American organization CARE, which may end up 
coordinating much of the current program, was itself founded in the aftermath 
of World War II to send food to Germany and other European countries devastated 
by the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
CARE, which originally stood for Cooperative for American Remittances to 
Europe, later changed that last word to Everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
It is also likely that some of the German food to be shipped eastward might be 
drawn from the huge food stocks stored in Berlin in case the Soviets attempted 
a repeat of the 1948-49 blockade of the city. 
</P>
<P>
According to Berlin city government officials, supplies valued at $450 million 
are still stored in the city -- including 120,000 tons of grain, 33,000 tons of 
dried meat and 10.9 million cans of sardines. 
</P>
<P>
The German relief effort also carries deeper meanings. 
</P>
<P>
Some politicians here have hailed the extent of the response as a symbol of 
reconciliation between Germans and Russians -- who between them lost 30 million 
dead in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, many older Germans also said they see the aid program as a 
chance to help a people in need in much the way they themselves received food 
packages to get through their first postwar winters. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is also more than pure goodwill behind the German emergency aid. 
With the prospect of mass suffering also comes the potential for a flood of 
refugees that could threaten the stability of the entire region. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, Germany has already provided the Soviet Union more than $13 
billion in direct aid, including $220 million in credits for emergency food 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The Germans also have provided Moscow with a $1.9-billion, interest-free loan 
to help meet the cost of maintaining Soviet forces in the former East Germany 
over a fixed four-year withdrawal period. 
</P>
<P>
The 380,000 Soviet troops in Germany will be pulled out in phases to ease the 
impact that returnees will have on Soviet housing and jobs. Reports have said 
that morale is low among the low-paid Soviet troops and that some have taken to 
dealing in black market goods to make ends meet. Moscow has admitted that at 
least 80 soldiers have defected this year in eastern Germany.

FOR SOCIALISTS IN GERMANY, EMPTY STREETS; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: A SERIES OF DISASTERS HAVE SET THE PARTY UP FOR A LIKELY DRUBBING IN 
UNIFIED NATIONAL VOTING.

<P>
With flags flying and loudspeaker blaring, the bright little car trundled 
optimistically into this eastern German farming community -- a one-vehicle 
caravan dispatched to spread the socialist message among those preparing to 
vote in Sunday's national elections. 
</P>
<P>
There was only one problem: the streets were empty. 
</P>
<P>
Stopping only long enough for a few curious residents to peer out their windows 
and see the letters "SPD" -- Social Democratic Party -- on the flags, the car 
spewed forth a brief, indecipherable message followed by a few bars of heavy 
"oom-pah" music, then exited as it came. 
</P>
<P>
Although only a fleeting moment in a long campaign, the incident in many ways 
captured the poorly organized, occasionally farcical effort that has 
characterized the Social Democrats' attempt to wrest power away from Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl's center-right coalition. 
</P>
<P>
This disorganization is part of a wider set of problems plaguing the 
traditional party of Germany's moderate left, turning what by rights should be 
its hour of triumph into an electoral struggle that carries all the earmarks of 
an impending disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Former Social Democrat Chancellor Helmut Schmidt dismayed his party colleagues 
as much by the truth as by the lack of tact in his recent comment to a Dutch 
newspaper that not only would the party lose the first free all-German 
elections in nearly 60 years next Sunday, but it deserved to lose. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the upbeat rhetoric of the party's ill-chosen chancellor candidate, 
Oskar Lafontaine, leading political opinion polls show that with the election 
only days away, the Social Democrats trail Kohl's Christian Democrats by 10 to 
12 percentage points and the combined total of Kohl's coalition parties by as 
much as 22.4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
"No one with such a large lead has ever before been overhauled," said Reichard 
Schneider, an election pollster at the INFAS opinion survey organization in 
Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of contemplating victory, the SPD officials are considering the very 
real prospects of their worst drubbing since the party was revamped into a 
mass-based party in the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Just over a year ago, they exuded confidence. The party was level or ahead of 
Kohl's Christian Democrats in the West German opinion polls, and its leaders 
spoke confidently of a built-in majority among the predominantly northern, 
Protestant -- and traditionally socialist -- regions of eastern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
It was a majority that would likely ensure the party's dominance for decades 
once unification occurred, they believed. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of guaranteeing the Social Democrats power, the unification process 
brought a series of setbacks that, collectively, completely reversed party 
fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
The problems first surfaced a month before the Berlin Wall collapsed in 
November, 1989, when a group of East Germans founded an eastern Social 
Democratic Party in defiance of the Communist authorities still in power there. 
</P>
<P>
Unsure at that point if the East German Communist regime would survive, the 
party's western leadership hesitated for weeks before extending its official 
recognition to the new group. This move poisoned relations between the party's 
eastern and western wings after the subsequent Communist collapse, and it 
remains a sore point, inhibiting meaningful cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
Such hesitation characterized later moves. 
</P>
<P>
Reluctant to forsake years of carefully constructed political contacts with 
East Germany, the West German Social Democrats found themselves both incapable 
of adjusting to the speed of unification and hopelessly out of touch with the 
public mood in the east. 
</P>
<P>
They argued for a slow, deliberate course toward unity when most East Germans 
wanted it immediately. They tried to put off national elections when East 
Germans wanted them soon. They stoked fears about the huge costs of unity when 
the nation wanted most to savor its reunion. 
</P>
<P>
As Kohl sensed the moment and threw himself behind unification, Lafontaine 
seemed to resist events. 
</P>
<P>
The results were disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of winning the East German national elections last March as they 
assumed they would, the Social Democrats won only 21.8% of the vote and were 
crushed by the Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the SPD lost local government elections and in an October vote managed 
to gain power in only one of the five new federal states created from what had 
been East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The dismal showings have only deepened differences within the party. 
</P>
<P>
Serious, sometimes open, clashes over policy and tactics have left Lafontaine 
isolated from the party's mainstream and adopting almost a flip, uncaring 
attitude in the final days of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
An April assassination attempt against him also left Lafontaine noticeably more 
detached from the political debate. 
</P>
<P>
While Lafontaine, despite the party's difficulties, has drawn well in western 
cities nearer his Saarland home, Social Democrats' efforts in eastern Germany 
have been hampered by the sense of futility that characterized the party's 
recent foray into this small village. 
</P>
<P>
On the Magdeburg city square, where 70,000 greeted former Social Democratic 
Chancellor Willy Brandt last December, barely 1,000 turned out for Lafontaine 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
"The collapse of Stalinism should have begun a decade of social democracy," a 
senior party official in Bonn said recently. "Instead, there will be a search 
for scapegoats, for what went wrong and for a new identity."

SECURITY COUNCIL POISED TO PASS USE-OF-FORCE MOTION; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: BAKER MEETS WITH SOVIET AND CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTERS.

<P>
With Secretary of State James A. Baker III lobbying his fellow foreign 
ministers until the last possible moment, the U.N. Security Council is poised 
to pass a historic measure today authorizing the use of force against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who will preside over today's meeting because the United States holds 
the Security Council presidency this month, met Wednesday night with Soviet 
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Cuban Foreign Minister Isidoro O. 
Malmierca. Baker also held a midnight meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen. 
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Baker, Shevardnadze reaffirmed Soviet support for the 
resolution authorizing the use of military force unless Iraq ends its 
occupation of Kuwait by Jan. 15, 1991. But he said Moscow has not given up hope 
that the Persian Gulf crisis can be solved peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
"The resolution permits the use of force, but it does not require it," 
Shevardnadze said. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater agreed that the authorization to 
use force "does not demand action or demand any kind of declaration of war or 
anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said he is prepared for "serious and substantive" discussion with 
Baker on ways to implement the resolution authorizing military action. 
</P>
<P>
China, which voted for 10 previous resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion of 
Kuwait, is expected to abstain this time, although some U.S. diplomats believed 
there was still a chance that Beijing might decide to support the measure. 
</P>
<P>
There was little doubt at the United Nations that the resolution would pass. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Abdul Amir Anbari, spoke as if the vote were a forgone 
conclusion. He was asked if the resolution would change Iraq's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"Only to the extent that it makes us realize that the United States really is 
not interested in solving the problem peacefully as much as it is trying to 
destroy the Iraqi military and industrial base," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba's U.N. ambassador, Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, also conceded the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is quite obvious tomorrow's resolution will be adopted, and my 
impression is they will get the majority of members in the council," he said. 
"We will not support it." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Baker held a private meeting in his Waldorf Astoria hotel suite 
with Malmierca, the first officially acknowledged high-level U.S.-Cuban meeting 
in more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Then-Secretary of State George P. Shultz conferred briefly and informally with 
Malmierca in December, 1988, after the signing of an Angolan peace agreement 
that required the withdrawal of Cuban troops from the African nation. There 
have also been several secret contacts over the years. But this was the first 
formal and publicly announced session since then-Vice President Richard M. 
Nixon met Fidel Castro in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the usual U.N. ambassadors, the higher-ranking foreign ministers 
from 13 nations will be present in the council's chamber for today's vote. Only 
the foreign ministers of Yemen and Ivory Coast are expected to be absent. 
</P>
<P>
The Baghdad government has ignored the 10 previous U.N. resolutions, which have 
authorized enforcement of trade sanctions and demanded the immediate withdrawal 
of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the 15 council members had threatened to try to couple the latest 
Persian Gulf resolution with a vote on a measure designed to strengthen the 
safety of Palestinians in territories under Israel's occupation. However, they 
did not raise the issue Wednesday.

Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze agreed Wednesday to meet Dec. 10-11 in Baker's hometown of Houston 
to prepare the ground for a U.S.-Soviet summit meeting early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said it is possible that he and Baker will be able to settle all 
remaining differences on a treaty reducing U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals 
during their Houston talks, clearing the way for President Bush and Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to meet in Moscow to sign the pact. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether it will be in January or possibly a little later," 
Shevardnadze said of the Moscow summit. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Shevardnadze set the date during a two-hour meeting at the 
headquarters of the Soviet Mission to the United Nations. The men were in New 
York in advance of today's Security Council meeting taking up a measure that 
would authorize the use of force to drive Iraqi occupiers out of Kuwait.

Gary Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov drew for the eighth straight game Wednesday in 
the World Chess Championship. 
</P>
<P>
The two Soviet rivals are now tied at 7 1/2 points after 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's 15th game began similarly to the 13th game on Saturday, with Karpov 
and Kasparov playing a Grunfeld opening with an exchange variation. The 
position was the same after 10 moves as the two previous games, but Karpov 
varied his game when he went to a bishop move, not found in any previous game 
using the Grunfeld opening. 
</P>
<P>
At the 33rd move, Kasparov proposed the draw, which Karpov accepted.

The crowd cheered, Margaret Thatcher raised her hand in a familiar wave and 
then she was gone, out the gates of Buckingham Palace and into history. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, prime minister for more than 11 years, had formally resigned and 
returned her "letters patent" to Queen Elizabeth II and bade the monarch 
farewell in a 45-minute audience Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
She had already made her final appearance as prime minister at the House of 
Commons and said goodby to her staff at 10 Downing St., her office and 
residence, and at Conservative Party headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Wishing her successor well, she declared in an emotional statement on the steps 
of 10 Downing: "It has been a tremendous privilege to serve this country as 
prime minister. Now, it is time for a new chapter to open, and I wish John 
Major all the luck in the world." 
</P>
<P>
And without further ceremony, the Thatcher era ended. 
</P>
<P>
Winning three elections in a row, Thatcher had been prime minister longer than 
any of her predecessors in this century and worked great changes across the 
whole of British society. But last week, Conservative members of Parliament, 
fearing that they would lose the next election under her leadership, forced her 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"Her time had come to an end, and she came to recognize it," Norman Tebbit, one 
of her closest political advisers, commented Tuesday. "It hurt -- there is no 
denying that it hurt her -- but she recognized it and resigned. Now Margaret 
Thatcher is gone, and we have John Major as the leader of our party." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Cabinet members were speaking Tuesday of the "natural renewal of the 
party," but many British political commentators were describing it as a "palace 
coup" to remove an increasingly unpopular prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
But Thatcher, although described by columnists as "bitter" over her ouster, 
held her peace, apparently satisfied that Major, who already had become her 
choice as a successor, was safely installed as the party's leader and prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
The gossip columnist Nigel Dempster reported that Thatcher had told her "inner 
circle" at the beginning of November that she would resign next spring after 
Major, who had been chancellor of the exchequer, had introduced a new, 
election-winning budget, complete with tax cuts and lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher "wished to hand over to Major in the most favorable conditions," 
Dempster reported in what appeared to be an attempt to put the best face on 
what had been a great humiliation for her. 
</P>
<P>
Major, she declared as she left Downing Street, "has the makings of a great 
prime minister, which I am sure he will become in a very short time." 
</P>
<P>
"She has behaved impeccably in a most appalling business," Lord St. John of 
Fawsley, another Thatcher supporter, said with admiration, and a British 
Broadcasting Corp. commentator described her as "playing the role of a tragic 
heroine with absolute aplomb." 
</P>
<P>
Since her resignation last Thursday, Thatcher has acted with such poise, in 
fact, that it seemed -- except for the brief moment Tuesday morning when she 
choked back tears outside Downing Street -- as if she had wanted all this to 
happen and had even orchestrated it. 
</P>
<P>
But Thatcher's tenure had ended so abruptly, so unexpectedly -- there is no 
lame-duck period of transition in British politics -- that her plans for the 
future were far from clear. Although 65, she has no intention of retiring, but 
what she will do after such a long tenure at the top is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"I will be in the House (of Commons) tomorrow," she told reporters gathered 
outside her non-official home in the southern London suburb of Dulwich, 
recalling that she still represents the London constituency of Finchley in 
Parliament. "We have always worked. It is the only thing we know." 
</P>
<P>
At her final appearance as prime minister -- her 698th "question time" in the 
House of Commons -- she had promised that her sharp debate "will continue from 
the back benches as they have from the front." 
</P>
<P>
Former British prime ministers, however, are by political custom entitled to a 
hereditary earldom, and Thatcher has already been proposed by Burke's Peerage, 
the company that keeps track of the British nobility, as the "Countess of 
Grantham," a title that would recall her humble origins as a grocer's daughter 
in the Lincolnshire village of Grantham. 
</P>
<P>
This would entitle her to sit in the House of Lords, the upper chamber of 
Parliament, and provide her with a forum in which she can speak out regularly. 
(Her husband, Denis, would remain "Mr. Thatcher," according to Burke's, but her 
son Mark, a businessman in Texas, would become the Earl of Grantham on her 
death.) 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher advisers, including Tebbit, said she is likely to defer that honor, if 
she does accept it, until the next election rather than cause a by-election in 
which her Finchley seat in Commons might be lost to another party. 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, she has arranged a temporary office at the House of Commons and 
borrowed staff to answer the more than 30,000 letters she has received, 
arriving by the sackful, since she resigned. So many flowers were received, 
more than 1,200 bouquets, that a small fleet of government trucks had to be 
mobilized to distribute them to London hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Her next priority, according to aides, will be to take up the scores of 
invitations for speeches around the world, and she will probably start with a 
trip to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
And later she will probably write her memoirs, which London literary agents say 
could fetch as much as $12 million in royalties. 
</P>
<P>
"First, she wants to re-emerge into the world by overcoming the 'withdrawal 
symptoms' that come when you give up power," her daughter Carol, a free-lance 
journalist, said over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
For the longer term, Thatcher is said to be considering the creation of a 
foundation, much like the one now headed by former President Jimmy Carter, that 
could serve as a base for her as well as a center to propagate Thatcherism, as 
her conservative philosophy of less government, more individual initiative and 
greater self-reliance is now known. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a large world stage for her," Tebbit commented, "and I hope that she 
will remain on it for a very long time. . . . There has never been a former 
prime minister like this one." 
</P>
<P>
There have also been some playful proposals for Thatcher -- president of the 
European Community, succeeding Jacques Delors, whom she has often criticized, 
and even governor of a European central bank, whose creation she opposes. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's salary as an ordinary member of Parliament is the equivalent of 
$52,600, a sharp drop from the $131,700 she received as prime minister, but her 
75-year-old husband, a retired businessman, is a multimillionaire. 
</P>
<P>
The whole transition was summed up symbolically as Thatcher, no longer in the 
prime minister's black Jaguar but in a lesser bulletproof, bomb-proof 
limousine, drove out of Buckingham Palace and headed toward her home in 
Dulwich, a quiet, leafy suburb of stockbrokers, businessmen and professors, 
rather than back to Downing Street. 
</P>
<P>
Purchased four years ago, the new, $800,000, five-bedroom house has never been 
lived in. Rather, Thatcher kept it for just such a moment, recalling how former 
Prime Minister Edward Heath had to hunt for a place to live after he was ousted 
in a 1974 parliamentary election. 
</P>
<P>
All week long, Denis Thatcher, usually wearing an old blue cardigan, had been 
loading the family car, an equally old Ford station wagon, with suitcases and 
boxes and driving them down to Dulwich. On Monday, a big white moving van had 
taken away the rest of the Thatcher belongings -- so many, in fact, that much 
of the family furniture and personal effects were put into storage. 
</P>
<P>
The house is protected by an iron gate and high walls on three sides but is 
open on the fourth to a golf course, where Denis Thatcher hopes to spend much 
of his time. The residence will be guarded by the government's diplomatic 
protection service. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, still regarded as a target for terrorists, will have police 
bodyguards, and the government will provide her with an armored limousine. But 
Denis Thatcher, who had to sell his cherished Rolls-Royce for public relations 
reasons when his wife became prime minister, plans to buy another. 
</P>
<P>
Carol and Mark Thatcher have been helping with the moving, and Carol took on 
the task of stocking the Dulwich house with food. 
</P>
<P>
"I offered because I knew she hasn't been to the supermarket for 12 years," 
Carol recalled. "Then she said, 'Of course I have been to the supermarket -- I 
have opened enough of them.' She'll be all right."

Liberian rebels signed a cease-fire agreement Wednesday, but a West African 
summit ended without a clear-cut political settlement to the country's 11-month 
civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel leader Charles Taylor embraced some of his bitterest enemies after 
accepting an immediate cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was hailed as a breakthrough by leaders at the summit of the 
Economic Community of West African States. 
</P>
<P>
But Taylor at once made it clear that he does not recognize the interim 
government installed in Monrovia, the Liberian capital. 
</P>
<P>
"The document that we signed states very clearly that no group in Liberia is 
recognized as an interim government," he told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
After 11 months of fighting, Taylor and his foes agreed to join other Liberian 
groups in talks on political arrangements before free elections. 
</P>
<P>
Interim President Amos Sawyer, sworn in only one week ago in Monrovia as part 
of a West African community peace plan agreed to in August, appeared the 
biggest loser at the Bamako summit. 
</P>
<P>
A statement issued at the end of the summit referred to a "future interim 
government" -- effectively disowning Sawyer's. 
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire accord was also signed by representatives of the two other 
warring factions -- Prince Johnson's Independent National Patriotic Front of 
Liberia and the Armed Forces of Liberia of former President Samuel K. Doe, who 
was killed by Johnson's men in September. 
</P>
<P>
These two groups are allied to a Nigerian-led West African peacekeeping force 
sent to Liberia in August. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's group underscored the confusion over Liberia's political leadership, 
saying that it supports Sawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, making V-for-victory signs, looked pleased at the outcome of the first 
extraordinary summit in the 15-year history of the West African economic group. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from not recognizing Sawyer, he said he would remain in charge of the 
territory under his control, which he puts at 90% of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Cease-fire details have yet to be worked out.

FAMILY WINS SETTLEMENT OVER FORCED CESAREAN

<P>
The parents of a cancer patient who died shortly after being forced to undergo 
a Cesarean section have ended their three-year battle, winning an unprecedented 
settlement that the ACLU called "an important victory for women's rights." 
</P>
<P>
"All through her short life, Angie wanted to help other people," Nettie Stoner 
said of her daughter, Angela Carder. "Through her last tragedy, little did she 
know that even though she would not be here, she would continue to help 
people." 
</P>
<P>
The settlement Monday between George Washington University Hospital and 
Carder's family includes a monetary award and an agreement by the hospital to 
establish policies protecting pregnant women's rights to determine their 
medical treatment. Both parties agreed not to disclose the size of the award. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not want the dollar amount to overshadow what we think is the more 
significant outcome of the case, which is the policy perspective," said Terry 
Thorton, an attorney working with the ACLU who represented the family. 
</P>
<P>
Carder, 27, a terminal cancer patient at the hospital, died in 1987, two days 
after doctors performed a Cesarean section, ordered by a lower court, in an 
attempt to save the life of her 26-week-old fetus. The baby died less than 
three hours after the operation, which was listed as a contributing factor in 
Carder's death. 
</P>
<P>
Carder's parents, who live in Clarksville, Md., appealed the order, saying that 
their daughter, who was conscious and coherent at the time of the operation, 
did not give informed consent. Further, the family charged that the surgery 
violated Carder's right to bodily integrity. 
</P>
<P>
The District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled in the family's favor, saying: 
"A fetus cannot have rights . . . superior to those of a person who has already 
been born." 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Stoners, the ACLU brought a civil suit and a medical 
malpractice case against the hospital, charging that it had not taken 
sufficient measures to determine Carder's wishes and did not consult the family 
before requesting the court order. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital has agreed to establish policies aimed at precluding court 
intervention in such cases.

RAIN, SNOW, RECORD WARMTH HIT MIDWEST

<P>
Severe and unusual weather struck the Mississippi Valley and the northern 
Midwest on Wednesday with snow, thunderstorms and record high temperatures, 
while the Northwest braced for another storm and more flooding. 
</P>
<P>
Strong thunderstorms continued through the day over northeast Mississippi with 
a large area of rain and scattered thunderstorms over western Tennessee, 
Louisiana, Arkansas, southeast Texas, northern Alabama and the Florida 
Panhandle, weather officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The storms produced strong, gusting winds near Vicksburg and Jackson, Miss., 
and the Warren County sheriff's office reported that trees had been blown down 
in the region. 
</P>
<P>
In Indiana, at least 1,000 people were forced from their homes Wednesday, some 
evacuated by boat, after two days of rain overflowed creeks and ditches, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The heavy rain in northwest Indiana later abated, but the National Weather 
Service issued a flood warning for the Kankakee River through Saturday. Two 
emergency shelters were set up in Lake County for those left homeless by high 
water. 
</P>
<P>
As much as 5 1/2 inches of rain soaked parts of the Chicago metropolitan area 
and more than three inches fell in Peoria, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
A Chicago man drowned when his car became submerged in 10 feet of water beneath 
a viaduct. John Appleton, 62, was found unconscious by divers and was 
pronounced dead at Olympia Fields Osteopathic Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri was recovering from severe storms and tornadoes Tuesday that injured 
30 people and destroyed homes, businesses and vehicles. Gov. John Ashcroft went 
to the O'Fallon area, about 30 miles outside of St. Louis, early Wednesday to 
inspect the damage from winds that gusted to 70 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Chief David House said damage was estimated at $36 million, but he said 
that figure could go higher. 
</P>
<P>
The only serious injury reported was a hunter who was in critical condition 
Wednesday in suburban St. Louis after being found under the debris of a house. 
</P>
<P>
Two tornadoes also were spotted in the state but caused no serious damage, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, records for warm and wet weather were set at the same time snow 
advisories were posted in the upper Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Snow fell through nearly all of northeast Minnesota and northern Wisconsin with 
accumulations of up to seven inches. Freezing rain was falling on the western 
third of upper Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
But just to the south, a record temperature of 68 degrees was set in Detroit, 
topping by five degrees a record set in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Among high temperature records set or tied for the date Wednesday were Akron, 
Ohio, 68; Albany, N.Y., 75; Atlantic City, N.J., 68; Boston, 69; Buffalo, N.Y., 
72; Burlington, Vt., 66; Cleveland, 68; Concord, N.H., 71; Pittsburgh, Pa., 71, 
and Portland, Me., 60. 
</P>
<P>
A record of another sort was set in Grand Rapids, Mich., where this month was 
declared the second wettest November on record. The 2.99 inches of rain that 
fell Tuesday through Wednesday morning also was a record for a 24-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
In another wet region, residents of western Washington state braced for another 
storm that carried the potential for high winds, heavy rain and additional 
flooding. 
</P>
<P>
Southerly winds reaching 40 m.p.h. were expected inland as a cold front moved 
in from the Gulf of Alaska carrying warm, moist air that could lift snow levels 
to 6,000 feet, adding to the threat of already high rivers flooding their 
banks.

NORIEGA TAPES CAN BE BROADCAST, JUDGE RULES; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: CNN HAS AIRED THE ONLY ATTORNEY-CLIENT TALK THAT IS INVOLVED. THE DEFENSE 
DOES NOT OBJECT TO THE DECISION.

A federal judge Wednesday lifted the ban against the broadcast of tape 
recordings of Manuel A. Noriega's jailhouse phone conversations, effectively 
ending a three-week legal battle over the rights of the press versus the right 
to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing seven tapes turned over by Cable News Network, U.S. District 
Judge William M. Hoeveler determined that the only attorney-client conversation 
on the tapes already had been broadcast by CNN, which had aired some of the 
tapes before the judge ordered the network to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"The tapes may be published as CNN wishes to publish them," Hoeveler said 
during a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Rubino, Noriega's chief defense counsel, said he had no objection to the 
lifting of the ban. "The damage is done," he said. "A ban now is like shutting 
the barn door after the horse escapes." 
</P>
<P>
Rubino said he would pursue his motion to dismiss the case on the grounds of 
government misconduct, along with a separate motion asking that the network be 
found in contempt of court for airing more of Noriega's conversations after the 
judge's Nov. 8 ban, and that CNN be fined $300,000 per broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
CNN first broadcast two weeks ago portions of several tape recordings that were 
made by officials of the federal prison south of here where Noriega has been 
held on drug charges since he was seized during the U.S. invasion of Panama 11 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
One of those conversations was between Noriega and a Spanish-speaking secretary 
for Rubino who served as a translator. 
</P>
<P>
After the first broadcast, Rubino asked Hoeveler to issue a ban, and he did. 
CNN appealed that temporary order, and on Nov. 18 the Supreme Court refused to 
lift it. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Korn, an attorney for CNN's parent company, Turner Broadcasting Systems 
Inc., reiterated the network position that prior restraint is never 
appropriate. "It's fizzled," he said of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Smolla, a William and Mary law professor who heads the school's 
Institute of Bill of Rights Law, told the Associated Press that it would have 
been better had the issue returned to the high court for a final resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Supreme Court let the ban stand "casts its shadow, and the 
shadow is negative," he said. "Other lawyers will aggressively pursue these 
sorts of strategies against news organizations. The battle isn't over yet." 
</P>
<P>
CNN founder Ted Turner, who was attending the Western Cable Television 
conference Wednesday in Anaheim, described the ruling as "a positive 
development . . . . It doesn't really resolve the 1st Amendment issue 
completely . . . (but) it's good for us." 
</P>
<P>
CNN President Tom Johnson said the network can now pursue its story on the 
government's taping of the ousted Panamanian leader's conversations. 
</P>
<P>
"CNN's coverage of this possible misconduct was delayed by this judicial prior 
restraint on press freedom," he said. "Despite the unfortunate delay, CNN's 
reporting of government taping of Noriega phone conversations will continue." 
</P>
<P>
The government has acknowledged routine taping of prisoners' phone calls at 
federal prisons. Noriega signed a release acknowledging that his calls were 
being monitored, but the defense said that release does not apply to 
conversations with his attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler on Wednesday ordered the Bureau of Prisons to cease sharing Noriega's 
tapes with other government agencies unless he approves. 
</P>
<P>
The case against Noriega, who is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 28, is plagued 
now by only one "collateral issue," in Hoeveler's words, and that is money. 
Rubino says he has been unpaid for the last 11 months because about $27 million 
stashed by Noriega in overseas bank accounts has been frozen at the request of 
the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Hoeveler ordered the government to try again to make some of that 
money available.

SIEGE AT AIDS HOME FURTHER DIVIDES NEIGHBORHOOD

<P>
With police surrounding the block near 12th Avenue and Venice Boulevard, and 
the reeking smell of tear gas still heavy in the night air, neighbors Jose 
Rivas and Jose Vidal stood on a curb and screamed at one another. 
</P>
<P>
They were screaming about a home for AIDS victims that has operated on their 
block since early last year, dividing the neighborhood between those who want 
the place shut down and those who support the six-bed home and the two dozen 
patients who have lived there. 
</P>
<P>
This was Tuesday night, and Rivas' and Vidal's neighborhood had been hit anew 
by an ugly incident involving one of the home's tenants. For three hours 
Tuesday, Alberto Alvizuri had shot at police officers, who in turn evacuated 
the block and settled in for a siege of tear gas that ended when Alvizuri took 
his life.

"They go crazy," Rivas, 19, said of the AIDS patients. "They walk down the 
street screaming and crying. They talk to themselves. They go down to the 
doughnut shop every morning screaming and crying." 
</P>
<P>
"You're wrong," shot back Vidal, a father of three who lives across from the 
Casa de Nuestra Senora facility. "They are good people. They are our neighbors 
too." 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood rift has festered for months. Petitions were circulated to 
have the facility removed. A second petition was discussed when rumors surfaced 
that a similar facility would open nearby. Some residents who had been tolerant 
of their sick neighbors changed their minds Tuesday after witnessing the gun 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict in the racially mixed Mid-City neighborhood is not unlike others 
that have played out across greater Los Angeles. When an AIDS hospice prepared 
to open in Silver Lake, for instance, an angry resident dispatched a nasty 
letter attacking gays, whose population generally has been hit hardest in this 
country by AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"You guys are like a cancer that just keeps creeping along and rotting 
everything it touches," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
When the Hughes House hospice prepared to open on Ogden Drive in Hollywood two 
years ago, one community leader received 25 phone calls a day from angry 
neighbors concerned about their property values. 
</P>
<P>
More residents complained, city inspectors visited the site three times and 
Inspector R. L. Steinbach concluded that while the facility was "a little 
unusual for the average single-family neighborhood," it did not violate local 
zoning laws. 
</P>
<P>
But residents persisted. They maintained lengthy logs of activity at the 
shelter, jotting down notes every time a new medical supply truck pulled up 
outside or a hearse drove away. The neighbors took their case to the Board of 
Zoning Appeals, but lost when the panel voted to allow the shelter to continue 
to operate. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of hospices for AIDS patients say the facilities provide a less 
institutional and more informal setting than a hospital, along with medical 
care that is less costly. 
</P>
<P>
Christie Cowell, a county AIDS program official, said there are 18 hospices or 
shelter facilities in Los Angeles County. While some cater to terminally ill 
residents, others provide care for specific patients, such as children with 
AIDS or people with AIDS and other problems, such as mental illness or drug 
dependency. 
</P>
<P>
She said the county spends $2 million a year on funding the hospice programs. 
Since 1981, she said, there have been slightly more than 10,000 confirmed AIDS 
cases in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Although she is sympathetic to the concerns of residents who live near an AIDS 
hospice, Cowell said it defies current medical knowledge for people to fear 
that they will become infected. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't get AIDS by living next door to someone who has it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, along 12th Avenue, many residents were complaining Tuesday night 
that AIDS patients use public telephones on the corner, eat at a popular 
doughnut shop around the block and allow children to play in the front yard of 
the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such concerns, Nancy Delgado, a supervisor for the county AIDS Program 
Office, said her agency has never received a formal complaint from neighbors 
against the Casa de Nuestra Senora, which she said began operating under a 
contract with the county about a year and a half ago. She said a staff member 
visited the shelter half an hour before the shooting started and saw no signs 
of impending violence. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was fine," Delgado said. "It was a really well-organized 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of some AIDS hospices said Wednesday that they have been 
welcomed into neighborhoods. Lee Rubio, residential manager for the Padua 
House, an AIDS hospice in Long Beach, said "we've had no form of harassment." 
</P>
<P>
"The way clients come into the house is not a problem and when they expire and 
leave the house, they go out the back door," Rubio said. "The mortuary car 
pulls in the back and nobody sees what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Malone, director of government relations for the AIDS Health Care 
Foundation, which operates a hospice in Elysian Park and an annex in Hollywood, 
said the key to winning neighborhood acceptance is candor. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to let people know you're there, to be up front about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that while the incident Tuesday apparently was an isolated episode of 
violence, the potential for such tragedies has been in the minds of many AIDS 
care providers.

CENTER TEACHES MEDIATION SKILLS TO NON-JUDGES; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: VENTURA COUNTY BELIEVES THAT TIME AND MONEY CAN BE SAVED BY HELPING 
PARTIES SETTLE CIVIL DISPUTES OUT OF COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
While the courts grow busier and lawsuit costs rise, a handful of experts have 
been training about 50 Ventura County lawyers, bureaucrats, business people and 
retirees to become mediators. 
</P>
<P>
The fledgling Ventura Center for Dispute Settlement is teaching the delicate 
dance of diplomacy to non-judges who could save Ventura County's courts time 
and money by helping parties settle civil disputes out of court. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 of the students will use the skills in their jobs, but the other 30 
plan to become volunteer mediators for the Center for Dispute Settlement, said 
Nina Meierding, a private mediator who has been training the students. 
</P>
<P>
Meierding said she and other professional mediators have helped settle cases 
ranging from simple neighborhood disputes to divorces involving $3 million in 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Conflicting parties who want to avoid the cost and time of a traditional 
lawsuit will be able to hire a mediator from the center beginning in January, 
Meierding said. 
</P>
<P>
Fees for the service will be on a sliding scale of $10 to $50 an hour for 
individuals and $50 to $99 an hour for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
If the mediator does help the combatants reach an agreement, it is usually put 
down on paper and becomes a legally binding contract, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In general, filing a lawsuit "is probably the worst way to resolve a dispute," 
said Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White, who heads the county's consumer 
mediation unit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time-consuming and it's very expensive for the public to pay for a system 
that handles small disputes," White said. 
</P>
<P>
White said her mediators resolve 90% of their cases, a rate the civilian 
mediators should be able to match. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, mock-angry shouts punched through the gentle hum of conversation 
in the Oxnard Hilton Hotel as the center's students pretended to be furious 
with each other. 
</P>
<P>
Meierding and the two other instructors, Randy Lowry and Peter Robinson of the 
Pepperdine University School of Law, had divided them into groups of three -- 
each made up of two "civil litigants" and one "mediator." 
</P>
<P>
Tamrah Berger, code-enforcement officer for the city of Port Hueneme, acted the 
part of an enraged musical instrument company supervisor who had fired the 
company's groundskeeper and then was forced to explain the firing to a mediator 
hired by the groundskeeper. 
</P>
<P>
"Insubordination! I'll spell it out for you: I-N-S-U-B-O-R-D-I-N-A-T-I-O-N!" 
Berger said, characterizing the employee's refusal to deliver bank papers when 
the company's messenger quit. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why I should be fired for refusing to do something that's not in 
my job description," said "groundskeeper" Karl Lawson, actually the city of 
Oxnard's community relations officer. 
</P>
<P>
Playing the mediator, Sheryl Getchman took notes and tried to keep the 
negotiations from breaking down. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'm going to keep it all under 'insubordination,' " said Getchman, a 
consumer mediator for the county district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
". . . And loyalty to the company," Berger snapped. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, how about loyalty to the company and eight years at the job and suddenly 
being told to do something that's not in my job description?" Lawson asked. 
</P>
<P>
Then Berger sarcastically mimed playing a violin and Lawson began chuckling, 
unable to sustain his character's frown. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson said he is taking the seminar to help improve his skills at settling 
complaints by Oxnard residents. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara Zoning Supervisor David Dawson said he hopes that the mediation 
skills he learns in this seminar will help him flesh out the facts in zoning 
disputes and identify more easily the problems that each party faces. 
</P>
<P>
The center grew out of an experimental program established in 1978 by the U.S. 
Department of Justice, said Lowry, who is director of the Institute for Dispute 
Resolution at Pepperdine School of Law. Now, about 400 private mediation 
centers are operating around the country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he warned the students that when people disagree, they may decide that the 
only thing they can agree on is that the mediator is their enemy. 
</P>
<P>
"There are extreme cases where you're going to be challenged in the first 10 
seconds" of mediation, Lowry said. He recalled sitting down with two parties, 
one of whom pulled back his coat to reveal a gun and a badge and demanded 
sternly, "Whaddya think you're gonna do for us?" 
</P>
<P>
"I looked right back at him and said, 'I'm not sure if I or anyone else can do 
anything for you,' " Lowry said. They argued for five minutes, but then began 
negotiations and by noon of the next day, "He's the guy who made the trip to 
McDonald's to bring lunch back for us."

DEADLINE EXTENDED FOR PANEL APPLICANTS

<P>
The deadline for submitting applications for the Simi Valley Planning 
Commission has been extended from today to Monday, city officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
To be eligible for appointment to the five-member panel, applicants must be 
residents of Simi Valley and not be employed by the city. 
</P>
<P>
There are four open seats on the commission, one of which became vacant when 
the chairwoman, Judy Mikels, was elected to the City Council on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Formal nominations and public interviews of the nominees by the council are 
scheduled for the council's Monday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Each member of the City Council is responsible for the nomination of one 
planning commissioner. The terms of the commissioners are concurrent with the 
term of the nominating council member. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Gregory Stratton, who was reelected to a third term this month, Mikels 
and another newly elected council member, Sandi Webb, will each be responsible 
for nominating a planning commissioner. Because Mikels was Councilman Bill 
Davis' appointee to the planning panel, he will also have to select a new 
member to sit on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which advises the council on development matters, generally 
meets two Wednesday evenings a month. CARLOS V. LOZANO

<P>
Promising to work to maintain the economic stability of Simi Valley in light of 
recent state and federal budget cuts, Mayor Gregory Stratton took the oath of 
office for the third time during ceremonies at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Stratton, who defeated retired Los Angeles bus driver Alfred J. Wilson in the 
Nov. 6 election, also welcomed new council members Sandi Webb and Judy Mikels 
on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The two were also sworn into office by Municipal Judge John E. Dobroth during a 
brief ceremony attended by about 75 people. 
</P>
<P>
Webb, a local businesswoman, and Mikels, former chairwoman of the Planning 
Commission, beat eight candidates, including incumbent Ann Rock, for two seats 
on the council. Former Councilwoman Vicky Howard, whose term expired this 
month, was elected to the Ventura County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to thank all the people who worked on my campaign and, of course, 
the people of Simi Valley who believed in me," Webb said after being sworn in. 
"I intend to work very hard for them and to be very accessible." 
</P>
<P>
In welcoming Webb and Mikels, Stratton warned the two that they were in for 
long hours and hard work on the council. 
</P>
<P>
"Say goodby to your husbands and loved ones and tell them that you will see 
them again in four years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The council also paid tribute to Rock, who did not attend the ceremony, and 
Howard for her eight years on the council and her recent election to the Board 
of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bill Davis, Howard's neighbor and opponent in the supervisorial 
race, congratulated Howard and said he hoped that they could put their bitter 
campaign rivalry to rest and work together. CARLOS V. LOZANO

SCHOOL BOARD PUTS OFF VOTE ON ITS PAY

<P>
The Moorpark school board Tuesday broached the touchy subject of $200-a-month 
compensation for board members, but concern over the district's budget prompted 
them to put the item on hold until next year's budget discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas G. Duffy was directed to draft board policy regarding compensation and 
to check with comparable districts to see what payment board members receive. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Cynthia Hubbard brought up the subject because board members' work 
has expanded. The Moorpark Unified School District has seven schools, with an 
eighth scheduled to open in September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much business for us, including time off from business and 
family," Hubbard said. "When we just had three schools, there was not as much 
business as now." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Tom Baldwin agreed. "It's been my observation that this position 
has cost me $1,000 a year in phone bills, postage to constituents and time off 
from work. I didn't run for the school board with any idea of getting rich, but 
I don't think I should find myself in a losing situation." 
</P>
<P>
However, Cynthia Coler, the teacher representative to the board, warned members 
about the district's budget. "At our school site, things seem to be getting 
tighter and tighter. My concern would be: How does this fit into the budget?" 
</P>
<P>
The board policy will include the stipulation that any board member who does 
not want compensation can donate the money back to the school district. GERRY

MAN ARRESTED AFTER CRASH KILLS BROTHER

<P>
A 27-year-old Santa Paula man was arrested on suspicion of felony drunk driving 
Tuesday after the car he was driving crashed and his older brother was killed, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Guadalupe Garcia Cantero, 29, of Santa Paula died instantly of head injuries in 
the crash, according to the Ventura County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
He was riding in the back seat of the 1984 Plymouth Colt driven by his brother, 
Robert Garcia Cantero, when the accident occurred about 1 a.m., authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cantero was driving south on California 150 south of Bridge Road at about 85 
m.p.h, California Highway Patrol Officer Jim Utter said. The car missed a curve 
and went off the right side of the road, hitting a parked pickup truck and a 
van, Utter said. The car then skidded and struck a power pole, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cantero was arrested and taken to Santa Paula Memorial Hospital, where he was 
listed in fair condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. Another passenger, 
William Lugo, 29, suffered minor injuries and was treated at the hospital and 
released, the spokeswoman said. CAROL WATSON

REPORTERS NEED NOT TESTIFY, JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge ruled Wednesday that two reporters who interviewed a 
31-year-old man accused of posing as a 17-year-old high school student do not 
have to testify at this time. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kenneth R. Yegan ruled that testimony from 
Times staff writer Santiago O'Donnell and Daily News staff writer James Maielle 
Jr. would "necessitate an undue consumption of time" in the trial of alleged 
con artist David Michael Murray, who is charged with 12 counts of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
In making the ruling, Yegan indicated that the prosecution had already 
presented an abundance of evidence against Murray, 31 -- alias Shi Stone, 17. 
"I think it's just cumulative at this juncture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles R. Roberts Sr. said he wanted the reporters to 
testify about incriminating statements Murray may have made to them. In a March 
article by O'Donnell, Murray is quoted as saying: "Ojai was wide open to me. I 
could have taken the entire town." 
</P>
<P>
Yegan rejected the request but said he may consider allowing the reporters to 
testify at the request of Murray, who is accused of defrauding Ventura County 
business people of money, merchandise, medicine and services between Jan. 8 and 
22. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said Murray spent most of his time posing as the hemophiliac son of an 
Air Force colonel wounded in the Panama invasion. But he also posed as a 
displaced airline traveler, a movie star, a movie producer, a model and a 
cross-country bicyclist while in Ventura County, Roberts said. HUGO MARTIN

PROJECT FOES OPPOSE PARKLAND DONATION

<P>
Ojai residents have scorned a developer's offer to donate a $500,000 chunk of 
land to the city or a nature conservancy, calling it a bribe and a Trojan 
horse. 
</P>
<P>
About 80 people attended a town forum Monday that Anaheim developer Howard M. 
Palmer sponsored to pitch a proposal he has submitted to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, who lost a 10-year battle with the city to build a shopping center next 
to Nordhoff High School, now wants to create a 26-lot subdivision on the 
30-acre parcel, donate about 12 acres of the parcel for a park and wetland 
habitat, and help finance a recreation center, auditorium or child-care center 
at the site. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still knocking my head against the door," Palmer said after the audience 
urged him to drop the plan, although he said it could offset traffic and other 
impacts from the subdivision along California 33. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Greene, president of Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, accused Palmer of 
bribing the community to support the subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
John Christianson of the Besant Meadow Preservation Group called the offer "an 
Ojai Trojan horse." He asked Palmer to "make a real gift" by donating the 
entire 30 acres for open space. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Joe DeVito said the city appreciates Palmer's proposal but will 
have to look closely at the environmental effects before making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Ojai Planning Commission is scheduled to review the plan Dec. 19. THIA BELL

LAGOMARSINO VISITS TROOPS IN MIDEAST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Touring among U.S. troops stationed in Saudi Arabia, Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino 
(R-Ventura) said Wednesday that the United States may be forced into war if 
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein does not remove his occupying force from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino said he hopes for a peaceful solution to the Mideast crisis but 
suggested that the United States cannot abandon its military commitment to 
Saudi Arabia and other nations in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"If the only other choice is to walk away, then I think we should seriously 
consider using military means," Lagomarsino said in a telephone interview from 
Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. "If it is that or say, 'We quit,' I don't think we have 
any choice." 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is touring 
the Middle East this week as part of a 20-member congressional delegation. He 
said the delegation's meetings with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and U.S. 
military leaders have reassured him that U.S. and foreign troops are prepared 
for war in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman also said he was impressed by the high morale among the troops 
he visited in the Saudi desert, particularly those closest to what could turn 
into the front-lines of a war. 
</P>
<P>
"None of them asked me what we are doing here in the Gulf," he said. Some 
troops wanted to know how long they would be in the Persian Gulf region so they 
could make plans at home, he said. "Some of them say we ought to get on with 
it, one way or another." 
</P>
<P>
Although temperatures have dropped to the high 80s, Lagomarsino said he could 
imagine how miserable it was in the summer. A fine dust, with the consistency 
of talcum powder, gets into everything.

Within the rigid infrastructure of the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility 
on Otay Mesa, one rule is inviolable. Breaking it could have grave 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"In prison, everybody has his own space," explains Chaplain Buzz Brewer, 
Donovan's religious director and activity coordinator. "You don't put your 
hands on an inmate. Maybe, if it's your homeboy, you roughhouse. But there's no 
white man putting his hands on a black man or vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, for the past several months at Donovan, hands of different colors have 
clasped those of fellow inmates, then intertwined. Donovan officials look on 
and marvel. 
</P>
<P>
Such anomalies are commonplace to members of the Alternatives to Violence 
Project West, known as AVP, a volunteer project sponsored jointly by the 
Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and the San Diego Peace Resource Center. 
</P>
<P>
The project involves training inmates as well as outside volunteers to conduct 
workshops on nonviolence inside the prison. Two weeks ago, AVP conducted its 
first session, in which prisoners acted as both students and teachers inside 
the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"Without sounding like an absolute Don Quixote, the purpose of the program is 
to bring peace in the world, to reduce violence by doing self-help seminars in 
developing self-knowledge in interpersonal relationships," said Karen Cauble, 
the program's co-director. 
</P>
<P>
Cauble, a social worker who has devoted two years to the project, said it began 
15 years ago in New York state at the request of inmates themselves, who were 
fed up with the lock-step cycle of crime and incarceration. Through a series of 
three-day workshops staffed by community volunteers, groups of 15 to 20 inmates 
are led through exercises and discussions meant to foster self-esteem, a sense 
of community and the peaceful resolution of conflict. The small changes 
reported at Donovan after these weekends register as major metamorphoses in the 
closed arena of the prison. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some pretty heavy sorts in here," Chaplain Brewer said of the first of 
the six workshops he has arranged with AVP so far. "To see them hand in hand, 
racially balanced, all interacting there, was exactly what we are trying to 
promote. This program requires that they touch each other. Afterward, they may 
not go sit down with each other in the mess hall, but at least it makes 
contact." 
</P>
<P>
Although swollen to more than twice its optimum capacity of 2,200 inmates, 
officials say Donovan is no more violent than most prisons. However, during a 
recent workshop, inmates were improvising crisis-deflecting reactions to a 
hypothetical knife attack when gates clanged shut and commands to freeze blared 
over the loudspeakers. A prisoner in the yard had just stabbed a fellow inmate. 
</P>
<P>
According to Cauble, AVP has targeted prisons because they harbor "the 
population we in society have labeled most violent." But the concepts shared 
are not limited to prisoners. The prevalence of fear, power struggles and anger 
in daily life are tackled too -- nonviolently. Cauble says her workshops have 
reached teen-agers who are on probation or considering suicide. "We are giving 
them tools to resolve problems before they end up in prison," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan officials and participants alike seem favorably impressed by AVP, but 
say its actual impact on prisoners is difficult to gauge because formal 
follow-up studies have not been done because of a lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We know who has been through the program, but we are not tracking them," said 
Brewer. "We just get anecdotal things that indicate it's been paid attention 
to. 
</P>
<P>
"The weight yard is divided -- white, black, every group has its own section. 
The second-strongest person on the yard, someone was messing with his weights. 
Everyone backed off, waiting for the ensuing fight that was sure to follow. 
Instead, he went and talked to them, got the weights back and settled the thing 
without a fight. That was immediately following his participation in the 
workshop." 
</P>
<P>
After seeing an AVP flyer requesting help, Bob Duggan, manager of the prison 
work program at Donovan, offered to handle the logistics of chaperoning, 
keeping the keys and getting prisoners to meals during a recent workshop. He 
had heard good things about the program, and wasn't disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was well received by the prisoners. They all participated, no one hung 
back. That's something you can't fake. There were several who said, 'I've just 
told you fellas things about myself that I've never told anyone else.' " 
</P>
<P>
Prisoners receive a "laudatory" or "atta-boy" memo in their central files for 
attending the workshop, according to Brewer. However, merely attending the 
program has little bearing on parole without an accompanying shift in behavior. 
Those involved say inmates seem to appreciate the program on its own merits. 
Prisoners sign up on their own initiative, many giving up paid work hours to 
attend. Nevertheless, first-day participants are wary. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very suspicious at first," said Dave Neptune, an AVP volunteer. 
"Prisoners are amazed that someone would be willing to spend a long weekend 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
An AVP weekend moves in slow stages as the prisoners begin to let down their 
guard, starting off with simple admissions of self-worth -- inmates are asked 
to share their positive qualities with the group -- followed by building trust 
and awareness through cooperative games, and culminating in collaboration 
between men to solve potentially explosive prison conflicts, such as being cut 
off in line for a phone call or shower. 
</P>
<P>
"When you start with a group of men who don't talk to or trust each other, and 
whose macho culture doesn't allow them to show any kind of weakness, and take 
them into the areas of communication, trust and self-esteem, it is just a 
remarkable kind of sequence," said Neptune. 
</P>
<P>
Cauble agrees. "Nobody bails. They become responsible. Our purpose is to 
empower the participants so we end up with a group of leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Cauble, who recently returned from an AVP workshop in an Alaska state prison, 
shared some reactions from inmates there. On an informal comment sheet, a 
prisoner named John wrote: "Some exercises helped me let the inner me out, and 
others helped develop my confidence in others. I can't say enough for the 
program." An inmate named Jack scrawled: "Better understanding oneself first 
will allow respecting others better." 
</P>
<P>
A subversive idea seems to be at work: that the aggression leading to criminal 
behavior can be transformed instead into a different kind of power, a will to 
arrive at solutions in which everyone, not just the mightiest, triumphs. The 
phrase transforming power, a sort of active pacifism, is the key concept of the 
program. Although it sounds visionary, workshop leaders refrain from 
proselytizing, or even from befriending prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
The Quakers' San Diego Monthly Meeting endorses AVP's overriding philosophy of 
pacifism and has adopted a complementary relationship with AVP of 
"representation but not responsibility," according to its recent minutes. Many 
AVP volunteers are Quakers; Brewer said his familiarity with the faith stems 
from his experience in the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
"Quakers have a pretty good reputation in the field of rehabilitation," he 
said. "But, because of their political activism, some of us wondered (when 
approached by Cauble on behalf of the program), 'What are they going to stir up 
here?' I asked them straight up and was convinced they weren't going to use the 
program as a political platform." 
</P>
<P>
"Most people (participating) are not familiar with Quakers or think they're New 
Age," said Cauble, a Quaker. The Religious Society of Friends and prison work 
traditionally have been associated, she said. "In the 1600s, Friends thrown 
into prison returned to help those they left behind. And, in the 1700s, the 
Quakers influenced the idea of the penitentiary as a place to be put aside to 
think. Quakers may be more dedicated because we do believe in service and 
living our beliefs. But we're not evangelical. You don't have to be Quaker to 
participate. The workshop developed out of the Quaker value of respect for all 
people, that there is that of God, the light, in each person." 
</P>
<P>
Although the nonprofit American Friends Service Committee and the San Diego 
Peace Resource Center are generous with their time, adequate funding has not 
yet caught up with AVP-West's reputation for success. With United Way or 
similar funds years down the road, AVP must rely on volunteer help to continue 
its work. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a lot of interest from other prisons at the state level," Neptune 
said. "The prison administration is anxious to increase nonviolence in prison 
settings, but we don't have enough trained volunteers to do that yet." 
</P>
<P>
Even with the emphasis on cooperation, reversing the social machinery of 
belligerence and mistrust cannot be achieved in a weekend or two, AVP 
facilitators realize. But it is a start. 
</P>
<P>
"Many community people who have this dedication to promoting nonviolence 
already will come to training workshops expecting to have pat answers, a 1-2-3 
formula for resolving conflict and a happy ending," Cauble said. "Right now, we 
don't have pat answers. But we can set up the process, and together, using the 
collective intelligence and experience of each person in the group, we can come 
up with more ideas."

<P>
When Mike Saba found himself stranded in Baghdad in early August, he 
characteristically took things into his own hands. 
</P>
<P>
Saba carefully chose a cabdriver who could speak both Arabic and Turkish -- so 
they could make a run for either Jordan or Turkey, in case one route was 
blocked. The precaution proved unnecessary; the taxi reached Jordan in eight 
hours, stopped just once by Iraqi troops. 
</P>
<P>
Cloak-and-dagger missions seem a way of life for Saba, who owns GulfAmerica, a 
consulting firm in Champaign that provides services to small- and medium-sized 
companies doing business in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve years ago, similarly quick action by Saba triggered a major U.S. 
government espionage investigation after he overheard a conversation in a 
swanky Washington hotel coffee shop and turned in a congressional staffer for 
allegedly leaking classified data to the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Saba has thrust himself into another hot spot. 
</P>
<P>
Assisted by a small group of friends, volunteers, two employees and his wife, 
Saba has become the nexus in a growing network of families of American hostages 
held in Iraq and Kuwait since Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2 invasion of the emirate. 
</P>
<P>
In a four-room office suite behind a Wendy's hamburger outlet, Saba has all but 
converted his business into Coming Home, a newly formed nonprofit organization 
that is rapidly winning the devotion of many hostage families. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Saba's aggressive advocacy is generating increasing enmity 
within the Bush Administration, which has sought to downplay the plight of the 
hostages in recent weeks and has discouraged private efforts on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
The White House fears that uncontrolled contacts between family members and 
Iraqi officials could play into the hands of Hussein, who is using the hostages 
as part of an international public relations effort designed to keep the United 
States and its allies at bay. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately upon returning home from Iraq on Aug. 10, Saba incurred the 
Administration's wrath by criticizing the State Department for what he called 
insufficient assistance to Americans stranded in Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, he has further aggravated Administration officials by working 
furiously to help arrange a trip to Baghdad scheduled for next week by a dozen 
hostage relatives -- a visit that defies President Bush's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
Saba's efforts have so alienated State Department officials that their anger, 
one source said, "is spilling over toward the families who are going over" on 
the trip. 
</P>
<P>
But Saba remains undaunted. "Ours is a strictly humanitarian effort," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the hostage relatives agreed. "It's really helping me emotionally," 
said Kim Edwards, 34, a Carson City, Nev., woman whose husband is still in 
Baghdad. She is among about a dozen women who plans to leave for Baghdad on 
Monday to visit their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
To help the relatives, Saba had been calling airlines in search of inexpensive 
group rates and a flexible return schedule, gathering relatives' visa 
applications, consulting with Iraqi Ambassador Mohammed Mashat in Washington 
and, above all, talking daily to the hostage relatives in a mass conference 
call. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not sponsoring the trip," Saba explained. "We're just facilitating it." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Bismarck, N.D., Saba, 49, is the only son of a Lebanese man and a Swiss 
woman who owned a corner grocery store in Bismarck. 
</P>
<P>
After earning a bachelor's degree in education, biology and social studies at 
Minot State University, Saba joined the Peace Corps, serving in Malaysia and 
Thailand. Later, he crossed the United States as its training coordinator for 
programs in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
He earned a master's degree in cross-cultural and comparative education and a 
doctorate in education and international relations, both at the University of 
Illinois. Saba also has worked in educational programs for American Indians in 
Arizona and North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1970s, he moved to Washington, serving as executive director of the 
National Assn. of Arab Americans, a cultural, educational and lobbying 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
It was in Washington, during breakfast at the Madison Hotel on March 9, 1978, 
that Saba overheard an intriguing conversation between Stephen Bryen, then a 
staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Israeli military 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
They were at a table no more than 10 feet away and, Saba said, Bryen was 
allegedly sharing with the Israelis classified Pentagon information regarding 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Alarmed, Saba began intently eavesdropping and taking copious notes. Afterward, 
he reported the incident to Assistant Atty. Gen. Benjamin Civiletti, touching 
off a major investigation. 
</P>
<P>
But Bryen denied any wrongdoing, and the probe ended with no official action. 
Although some Justice Department officials had recommended a grand jury 
investigation, they were overruled by superiors. 
</P>
<P>
Unsatisfied, Saba pressed his own inquiry, ultimately publishing at his own 
expense a book on the incident that he described as "a case study of the 
problems inherent in the current U.S. policy of unquestioning support of 
Israel," which he said could threaten world peace. The book's name: "The 
Armageddon Network." 
</P>
<P>
"Saba has a political interest of his own," said William Quandt, a former 
National Security Council specialist on the Middle East, who met with Saba at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
Saba said he strongly disapproves of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, adding: "Saddam 
Hussein has to back off and be dealt with -- as he is." 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Saba returned to North Dakota and campaigned unsuccessfully for the 
Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate, garnering about 35% of the votes in 
the primary. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Irene, returned to Champaign four years ago and began raising 
a family. He also has two grown children from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Their business, GulfAmerica, arranges for delivery in the Persian Gulf of U.S. 
goods ranging from air-conditioning equipment to soap, pencils, key chains and 
sporting goods. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of its income is generated by a large international trade conference 
that Saba sponsors every other year. The keynote speaker at the most recent 
conference in 1988 was former President Gerald R. Ford. 
</P>
<P>
It was the final preparations for the 1990 conference that took Saba to the 
gulf region in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
Even before he left the United States, the Iraqis were building up troops near 
the Kuwaiti border. Once in neighboring Bahrain, Saba sought assurances from 
the U.S. embassies there and in Baghdad that it was still prudent to visit 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials told him there was "absolutely no reason" not to go to Baghdad, 
Saba said. 
</P>
<P>
But when he ran into Bob Vinton, a business acquaintance, at the Baghdad 
Sheraton Hotel, Vinton's greeting was less than reassuring: "Mike, you've just 
arrived in Indiana Jones country." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Saba had a productive two days in Baghdad. More than 50 American and 
Iraqi businessmen signed up for the 1990 conference, which was scheduled for 
October in Bahrain. 
</P>
<P>
Saba was to have left Baghdad around midday on Aug. 2, but early that morning 
Iraq launched its massive invasion. The airport was closed. 
</P>
<P>
Saba, like hundreds of other Americans in Iraq, was stuck. Many began meeting 
daily at the U.S. Embassy for evening briefings. At the first session Aug. 2, 
those who had not already done so were asked to fill out registration cards. 
The next day, they had to do it all over again; embassy personnel had lost the 
initial batch. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the American community became very dissatisfied with the lack of 
information being provided by the embassy," Saba recalled. "The embassy 
personnel, as individuals, were working very hard. But they seemed to have no 
procedures for dealing with such a crisis situation." 
</P>
<P>
Five days after the invasion, as the safety of Americans in Baghdad seemed 
increasingly precarious, Saba and a friend decided to make a break for it. 
There were reports circulating in Baghdad of Westerners escaping by land to 
Jordan and Turkey. But when Saba asked embassy personnel to verify the reports 
by traveling to the borders, they refused. 
</P>
<P>
In Champaign, meanwhile, Irene Saba was worried about her husband, who "kept 
getting lost in the State Department's computer." 
</P>
<P>
"The most telling example of frustration with (U.S. officials) was the fact 
that on Aug. 8, after I called my wife from Amman to tell her that I was out of 
Iraq, she received a call to update her on my status -- that I was fine and at 
the Sheraton Hotel in Baghdad," Saba said. This occurred after Irene had called 
the State Department's Persian Gulf task force to inform it of her husband's 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
Saba returned home on a Friday and spent virtually the entire weekend 
telephoning the relatives of Americans he had met in Baghdad. "I realized right 
away the necessity to do more than make a few calls and say my responsibility 
was over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, he formed Coming Home. His goal was to create a network among hostage 
families to share information and to advocate that all nations adhere to the 
Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949. The accord provides for certain rights 
regarding the status and treatment of detained nationals, such as visits by the 
International Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
Saba also helped promote passage of a bill by Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) 
making American hostages and their families eligible for federal pay of up to 
$24,000 and for health benefits if they have lost their source of income. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has appeared on any number of television talk shows, and Coming 
Home has received thousands of letters and countless telephone calls. But 
except for some local corporate donations -- communications equipment, extra 
office space and some furniture -- financial support has been meager. 
</P>
<P>
One major exception is U.S. Sprint, which has provided free conference calls to 
the hostage families. At any time, a relative from anywhere in the United 
States can call the toll-free number and talk to whoever else is on the line. 
</P>
<P>
It is during daily, prearranged conference calls that the details of the 
impending visit to Baghdad are being worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Saba said his efforts on behalf of the hostage families have cost $10,000 to 
$15,000, largely in mass mailings of newsletters and other materials, telephone 
expenses before Sprint came along, and staff time. At the same time, Coming 
Home has received financial donations of about $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
Saba has scheduled a Dec. 7 fund-raiser in Champaign in hopes of raising $5,000 
to $10,000. "Otherwise, we may not be able to go on much longer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Local businesses, including a billboard company and radio stations, are 
donating their services to publicize the event. 
</P>
<P>
"My business has been tremendously affected by this," said Saba, whose 
GulfAmerica conferences have generated up to $200 million in business. He is 
trying to reschedule the canceled October meeting, perhaps in Los Angeles in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
As a businessman, he conceded, he has a vested interest in seeing stability 
return to the Persian Gulf -- "no question." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he said, he is committed to assisting the hostage families. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Saba has arranged for a Washington conference called "Responding to 
the Invasion of Kuwait," in hopes of better coordinating the efforts of the 
private organizations seeking to help, such as the American Red Cross and the 
National Organization for Victims Assistance. Most of the hostage relatives who 
plan to go to Iraq will attend the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been very careful from the outset that Coming Home is a purely 
humanitarian effort, with no political agenda," said Francis A. Boyle, a 
University of Illinois international law professor and a Coming Home board 
member. "The State Department, on the other hand, has another agenda: It 
supports the Bush Administration's policies." 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials declined to be drawn into a public debate with Saba. 
"We don't want to come across as being adversarial against any U.S. citizen," 
said one official, asking for anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
He and others, however, noted that the task force has assigned a caseworker to 
each hostage family, with whom the worker stays in regular contact, and that 
the task force has made thousands of calls to hostage families. 
</P>
<P>
But while many hostage families praise the workers for their diligence, they 
complain that the State Department rarely has any useful information to pass 
on. "They mean well," said one hostage relative. "But they're just not as 
helpful as Coming Home has been." 
</P>
<P>
A congressional staffer, who has worked closely with both Saba and senior State 
Department officials, added: "They have slightly different agendas. But it 
doesn't mean either one's not doing good work."

Dianna Broady sounded rather like a department store executive at the gala 
preview party she chaired Tuesday for the five-day Fantasy of Trees benefit at 
Sheraton Harbor Island. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing Christmas since April," she said with a tone of cheerful 
resignation. "In fact, since this is the fourth year for Fantasy of Trees, I 
feel like I've been doing Christmas year-round since 1987." 
</P>
<P>
With Thanksgiving finally in the background, the Christmas season has struck -- 
and with a vengeance that belies the period's gentle tone -- at this most 
eventful celebration of holiday decor sponsored for the benefit of Children's 
Hospital and Health Center by the hospital's immense, countywide auxiliary. 
</P>
<P>
As one might reasonably infer from the benefit's title, the chief feature is a 
collection of Christmas trees. There are 27, most of them decorated according 
to the extravagant fancy of professional designers. The trees are augmented by 
nearly as many wreaths, a collection of gingerbread houses and other seasonal 
decorations. Most items are subject to silent bidding, but some will be offered 
tomorrow at a live auction. The highest bid carries off a tree. Last year, a 
tree that included a diamond tennis bracelet among its ornaments fetched a bid 
of $9,000, which probably made it the costliest decoration in any of the 
county's living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
All of the benefit's myriad happenings -- if truth be told, this is more a 
spectacular than an event -- are being held in the Sheraton's Exhibit Hall, a 
multipurpose, basement space that at other times serves as a parking garage. 
For Fantasy, however, the hotel spread carpeting, and overall event chairwoman 
Barbara Ann Watson and her committee further disguised the hall to suit 
Fantasy's 1990 theme, Winter Wonderland. 
</P>
<P>
For Tuesday's opener, Broady talked Sheraton executive chef Bob Brody into 
inventing a coffee drink called Santa's Fantasy. Amaretto, cherry brandy and 
vanilla ice cream spiked the basic brew, which was stirred with a candy cane 
swizzle, and those who tried it said it had the kick of a reindeer. Santa 
strolled among the 300 guests handing out extra sugar canes to those for whom 
one never is enough. 
</P>
<P>
The preview looked ahead to a flurry of events that continue through Saturday. 
Several are sold out, but tickets still are available for Friday night's 
dinner-dance, which costs $100 per person. 
</P>
<P>
On a more affordable level, anyone who wants to see the trees or shop in the 
auxiliary's holiday boutique may attend open houses today, from 10 a.m.-12:30 
p.m. or 5-8 p.m. Open house tickets are $3 and are available at the door. 
</P>
<P>
Fantasy of Trees concludes Saturday with an 8:30 a.m. breakfast with Santa. It 
includes a puppet show, roving elves and photographs with Old St. Nick and Mrs. 
Claus. Tickets are $15 per person. For information on any of the events, call 
the Children's Hospital Auxiliary at 495-4988. 
</P>
<P>
Watson said that a total of 6,000 people are expected to visit at least one of 
Fantasy's various functions. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get my gray hair from this event, but it's been a challenge," she 
said of the unusually demanding logistics presented by a five-day benefit. 
"They netted $86,000 at last year's Fantasy, and we'll do at least as well. The 
people attending know that they're doing something for the children at 
Children's Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
The miniature forest includes a number of spectacular trees, including one, 
titled Gilded Renaissance, in blazing gold and crimson lit by the dancing 
flames of electric candles. Other notable trees include Mexican Fiesta, so 
bedecked with paper flowers and foil snowflakes that the tree underneath is 
virtually hidden from sight; the elegant Megumi No Ki, (or The Giving Tree), a 
Japanese fantasy that looks like something out of a period Art Deco living room 
on New York's Sutton Place, and Ski Switzerland, a rather simply decorated tree 
donated by Swissair. The kicker to this particular fir is that the purchaser 
also will receive a ski trip to Switzerland that includes business-class air 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Fantasy of Trees committee includes auxiliary president Sunny Golden, Sue 
Stadler, Marsha Bouman, Susan Johnson, Laurie McKeown, Connie Gorman, Grace 
Allen, Jan Baranowski, Meg Sesko, Lois Lucas, Gene Jensen, Sharrie Woods, Lou 
Turner, Judy Cliffton, Trudy Snell, Debbie Dulgar, Darlyn Davenport and Sharon 
Guadagnola. 
</P>
<P>
The season actually will offer several more tree festivals, including the 
immensely popular multievent Christmas Tree Lane, to be given by the Escondido 
Boys and Girls Club at the Rancho Bernardo Inn the weekend of Dec. 7. For those 
already looking past the Christmas holiday, several major events will close the 
month and year. 
</P>
<P>
The Holiday Bowl's annual Poinsettia Ball, given as a prelude to the game (this 
year's contest, between Brigham Young University and Texas A&amp;M, will be 
played Dec. 29 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, will be Friday, Dec. 28, in 
the Marina Ballroom of the San Diego Marriott. This year's theme is Fantasy 
Under the Sea. The black-tie affair will feature magicians, the Bill Green 
Orchestra, a sports-related comedy act performed by ESPN television personality 
Roy Firestone and dancing to Lil' Elmo &amp; The Cosmos. Tickets are $150 and 
$200 per person. For more information, call 283-5808. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to believe that the decade of the 1960s is now so antique that 
it actually can be viewed and celebrated with nostalgia, but some of those who 
survived the era intend to do just that at "The Happening," a New Year's Eve 
gala to be given at the San Diego Museum of Art by the Contemporaries, a young 
professionals' organization formed to support the museum and its exhibits of 
contemporary artists. The event begins at 8 p.m. and offers the option of black 
tie or '60s attire, for those who still own bell bottoms. Period music will be 
played by the band Rockola, and artworks created for the party will be 
auctionned. A paint booth will allow guests to create their own psychedelic 
works, and there will be a buffet dinner, raffle and champagne toast at 
midnight. Tickets are $60 and $75 per person. For more information, call the 
San Diego Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
A New Year's Eve gala will be given by The Whittier Friends, a professionals' 
organization that supports the Whittier Institute for Diabetes and 
Endocrinology of Scripps Memorial Hospitals. Once Upon a Blue Moon, to be given 
at the Sheraton Grande Torrey Pines, will begin at 8 p.m. and will include a 
Big Band, a jazz band, casino games and an hors d'oeuvres buffet. Dress is 
black-tie. For more information, call the Whittier Institute.

THE GANG OF '65; 
</P>
<P>
25 YEARS LATER, QUESTIONS ON TOM WOLFE'S ACCURACY REMAIN. BUT SOME OF HIS PUMP 
HOUSE BOOK HAS PROVED PROPHETIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a smile that slid into an easy laugh, Jackie Haddad Hellingson recalled 
that free-frolicking beach summer of '65 when her gang of bronze-skinned 
teen-agers waged war against The Outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, those were the crazy times when every day seemed to last a year and the 
surf-wompers, sun-lovers and rock 'n' roll kids staked out the Windansea Beach 
in La Jolla like it was their own back yard -- because it was. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, The Enemy drove huge gas-guzzlers with out-of-state plates. They 
were overweight mommy-hubbies who invaded the beach like an army of clammy 
white cadavers, carrying every piece of paraphernalia imaginable -- tanning 
oil, folding chairs, portable grills and chicken sandwiches. And those 
umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
In the confounding months of early Vietnam and the Watts riots, 40 lean and tan 
native Southern California teens decided to draw the line against The Outside 
World. 
</P>
<P>
So they invented The Hood Check. The Hang-Out. And The Stare. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen at a time, they would lollygag on the concrete steps near the old pump 
house, their legs spraddled, setting up a Cadaver Obstacle Course to block 
older people from the beach. When Outsiders went for a swim, the teens would 
eat the lunches right off their beach blankets. 
</P>
<P>
They would stop the big tourist cruisers in the middle of the street for phony 
oil checks. And then walk off laughing, leaving the hood up. 
</P>
<P>
Or they would just fix strangers with a sort of Zombie Stare -- cold enough to 
turn back almost any Outsider. 
</P>
<P>
That's when the gang met The Ice Cream Man. Mr. Outsider Himself. 
</P>
<P>
He wore a doubled-breasted seersucker suit and a white tie looped into this 
incredibly tiny knot. And he wore sneakers, along with this skyscraper top hat 
and walking cane -- at the beach! 
</P>
<P>
He was a New York writer named Tom Wolfe. And he wanted to do a story about The 
Kids. And about this new and youthful social rebellion he saw taking place on 
the shore at Windansea. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us thought he was a geek," Hellingson recalled. "Some people thought 
he was a narc because of the oddball way he dressed. Some of the surfers 
refused to cooperate with him. I mean, back then, nobody had ever heard of Tom 
Wolfe." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years later, both the writer and his story about the kids at 
Windansea Beach have achieved literary stature. "The Pump House Gang," written 
in the pyrotechnic prose of his "new journalism," helped establish Wolfe as one 
of the most prominent social critics of his generation. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Pump House Gang . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Some have responsible jobs and children of their own. Others are in jail. Or in 
drug rehab clinics. Or dead. Still others just disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, a half-dozen members of the old gang discussed how their lives have 
turned since that summer of '65. Some expressed remaining doubts over the scope 
and accuracy of the story that came to represent an entire generation of 
Southern California youth. 
</P>
<P>
And they talked about the new relationships each has forged with the beach, 
their old stomping grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Even as members of the Older Generation, they insist they haven't turned into 
the very Outsiders they once sought to ban from their surfside paradise. 
</P>
<P>
For Tom Wolfe, the Pump House Gang represented something new and different in 
the American culture of the mid-1960s -- a youth society based on beer busts, 
the rolling ocean waves and a segregated beach where being old was definitely 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Amazed at these goings-on, Wolfe produced a two-part article -- "The New Life 
Out There" -- that originally appeared in New York's Sunday Herald Tribune 
Magazine and later as "The Pump House Gang" in a book of his stories. 
</P>
<P>
The way Wolfe saw it, the middle and upper-class kids who hung around the 
salmon-pink La Jolla water system pump house represented the earliest version 
of a rebellious surfer subculture that would grow to enormous proportions in 
the years to come. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a darker side to the story. Wolfe wrote about teen-agers afraid 
to grow old. Like the young couple who decided to commit suicide at the pump 
house steps rather than face, as Wolfe wrote, "the horror age of 25, the horror 
dividing line." 
</P>
<P>
And the author had a prediction for the rest of his Pump House Gang. One day, 
he wrote, they would become prisoners of their own society. They would become a 
graying generation of beach bums. 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty soon," Wolfe concluded, "the California littoral will be littered with 
these guys, stroked out on the beach like beached white whales, and girls, too, 
who can't give up the mystique, Oh Mighty Hulking Sea, who can't conceive of 
living any other life." 
</P>
<P>
When Wolfe's piece was first published, most of the Windansea surfers say they 
felt betrayed by the caricatured figures in the story. Soon afterward, someone 
scrawled a graffiti message on the pump house wall: "Tom Wolfe is a dork." 
</P>
<P>
Even today, some harsh feelings remain. 
</P>
<P>
While they concede that some of their contemporaries have become the graying 
beach bums Wolfe envisioned, those who managed to escape that youthful culture 
don't feel much like beached whales. They're holding down solid jobs and are 
proud of their accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
"Even to this day, I feel used by the way I was portrayed in that story -- Tom 
Wolfe's little social experiment," said 49-year-old Gary Watkins, immortalized 
in the story for his freewheeling overnight sojourn into the midst of the Watts 
riots in a VW van -- a trip he and friends made for kicks. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like he was saying, 'Watch out Gary, you're going to be old one day, 
too.' Well, I'm no beached whale." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Watkins lives in Pacific Beach with his wife and son. And he works at a 
UC San Diego maintenance garage. 
</P>
<P>
"I still go to the beach to body surf and Boogie board," he said. "But the 
place doesn't rule my life. So, you see, you were wrong, Tom Wolfe." 
</P>
<P>
At 13, Vicki Bellardo was the youngest member of Wolfe's Pump House gang. Now 
she teaches Spanish and journalism at Madison High School in Clairemont. And 
she can't forget, either. 
</P>
<P>
For Bellardo, the Pump House Gang story was more fiction than fact. Like other 
pump house gang members, she recalls that Wolfe spent only two or three days 
hanging out with the kids to research his story. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe never accompanied any of them home -- they never would have let him, 
Bellardo said. He just asked lots of questions. Many kids gave him made-up 
answers, she added. The rest, she said, he made up himself. 
</P>
<P>
There was a toga party described in the story. None of the members said they 
could recall it. And there was made-up language such as the teens calling 
tourists "Panthus," a reference to Black Panthers for the black socks and 
sandals they often wore. 
</P>
<P>
"He made us something we weren't," Bellardo said. "He embellished on things to 
make our lives sound almost mythic. We were just a bunch of kids having fun." 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe declined to be interviewed for this story. In an interview following his 
first return to the pump house several years ago, however, the author described 
his preoccupation with the La Jolla beach scene. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that fascinated me was this whole age-segregation thing," he said. 
"California was the first place where I had seen communes of people segregated 
by age. These kids forming their own society, some living in garages away from 
their parents, fascinated me." 
</P>
<P>
Bellardo doesn't recall any teen-agers sleeping in rented garages. In fact, 
most kids -- especially her and her older sister, Liz -- often had to slip out 
of the house to show up at the pump house. 
</P>
<P>
"We had curfews. Our parents would have killed us if they knew we were hanging 
out at that beach," she recalled. "It was that way for a lot of the kids. But 
you wouldn't know it from reading the story. We were supposed to be out 
starting some sort of revolution." 
</P>
<P>
But, after all these years, other Pump House Gang members see the story through 
more tolerant eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Derks, Vicki's older sister, was the pump house teen-ager who 
fascinated Wolfe with her "Liz styles": "hulking rabbit-fur vest and 
black-leather boots over her Levi's, even though it is about 85 out here and 
the sun is plugged in up there like God's own dentist lamp." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Derks had a short career as an actress in New York and Paris, but now 
runs a rural Wisconsin saloon with her husband, and sings in a rock band. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny, but after all these years have made me older and wiser, I 
sometimes stop and think 'Yeah, maybe we did do all those strange things.' And 
I still think it's wild that some famous writer made a big deal out of our 
group. Or else nobody would be even talking about us today. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I look at it, Tom Wolfe put us all on the map." 
</P>
<P>
All around La Jolla these days, you can still see them: T-shirts and bumper 
stickers carrying the logo of the Mac Meda Destruction Co. 
</P>
<P>
Mac Meda was a resilient image in Tom Wolfe's paean to the rebellious kids of 
Windansea Beach. The very first scene of the story describes the kids sitting 
on the pump house steps, jeering Outsiders with an insider's code word. 
</P>
<P>
"Mee-dah," they said in a "real fakey deep voice." As in Mac Meda. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Pump House Gang," Wolfe describes the Mac Meda Destruction Co. as an 
"underground society . . . mainly something to bug people with and organize 
huge beer orgies with." 
</P>
<P>
A quarter-century later, Jack Macpherson still laughs at the little joke 
invented by a couple of surfers nicknamed "Mac" and "Meda" that the press and 
police somehow turned into an entire cult to symbolize the youth rebellion of 
the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Macpherson was part of the older beach crowd that hung around the parking lot 
at Windansea Beach, just down the way from the kids at the pump house. But he 
nonetheless had an effect on their lives, on the myth of the gang. 
</P>
<P>
Mac's roommate, Bob Rakestraw, liked to go to the zoo on weekends and have 
stare-downs with Albert the Gorilla. And he liked to break things -- doors, 
park benches, anything he could get his hands on. But he never used profanity. 
Instead, when angry, he would croak out the word "Meda." So, Rakestraw became 
Meda. 
</P>
<P>
One night, over beers, Mac and Meda came up with the idea for a phony 
destruction company, complete with business cards and T-shirts stenciled with 
red spray paint. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla was a pretty small beach scene back then. Word got around. 
</P>
<P>
Pretty soon, every kid in La Jolla had to have a Mac Meda T-shirt. They adorned 
their cars with Mac Meda bumper stickers showing an expanding nuclear cloud. 
They flashed Mac Meda "Get Out of Jail Free" cards. 
</P>
<P>
For members of the teen-age Pump House Gang, Mac Meda became a code word for 
beer bash -- usually held in isolated canyons east of La Jolla, in the 
then-undeveloped Sorrento Valley and Penasquitos Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Once, scores of La Jolla teen-agers gathered around a rickety barn that had 
been condemned. They built a campfire and drank beer and wine coolers, Liz 
Derks recalled. They listened to tapes of the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Bob 
Dylan, the Dave Clark Five and Jimi Hendrix. 
</P>
<P>
And then they used Jeeps, rocks and sledgehammers to tear down the barn. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the spirit of Mac Meda is carried on by Doug Moranville, a Windansea 
surfer who still prints the T-shirts -- adorned with gorilla mascot Albert 
MacMeda -- in a tiny industrial garage near downtown La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
And the stickers have become a form of 1990s graffiti, placed not only on cars 
and mailboxes and not only throughout La Jolla, but in bars and at bus stops 
throughout the world. Put there by people who remember. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki Bellardo thinks Tom Wolfe should have written an epilogue to his story 
about the California teen rebellion and the kids who "float right through the 
real world, but it can't touch them." 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe's story, Bellardo says, didn't account for the burgeoning drug scene that 
was just then overshadowing the Pump House Gang. "That wasn't a glamorous era," 
she said. "Actually, it was sort of sad." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Wolfe's magazine story appeared in February, 1966, the Pump House 
Gang was attending the funeral of a member felled by a heroin overdose. And 
there would be more. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people died, or they got strung out," Bellardo said. "There were 
suicides. A lot of others ended up in jail." 
</P>
<P>
People like Tom Coman. The 16-year-old who lived in a rented garage in Wolfe's 
story has since spent his life in and out of jail. He has been tried and 
acquitted of murder. He has been convicted of burglary. And, in 1979, he was 
labeled a narcotics addict and sent to the California Rehabilitation Center in 
Norco. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, he was jailed for burglary in Los Angeles. Now, neither his family 
nor friends know where he is. And they don't want to know. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki Bellardo understands the gnashings of some of her old pals who never 
escaped the beach. There just came a time, she said, when you had to break from 
that scene. Or else it broke you. 
</P>
<P>
"If you didn't get out young, you weren't going to get out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki got out. Today, she lives with her infant son in a La Jolla house she 
bought from her parents. She keeps that old pump house rebel style, though. A 
few years ago, she built her own Harley Davidson from the ground up -- and 
still occasionally drives it to her teaching job. 
</P>
<P>
"You had to cut your ties, or you were going to get into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
So, maybe Tom Wolfe was right after all. 
</P>
<P>
"He was pretty sharp," said John K. Weldon, 42, now an aircraft worker near San 
Luis Obispo. "I know some people still living on the beach in La Jolla. They're 
guys in their late 30s, still hanging in the same parking lot, living at home, 
waiting for their mothers and fathers to die. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty sad, but for some people his prediction came true. They're beached 
whales, that's really what they are." 
</P>
<P>
Little Jackie Haddad became a character in Tom Wolfe's vision of the Southern 
California youth rebellion, with a naive high school essay about her first 
surfing experience. 
</P>
<P>
She called it "My Ultimate Journey." And it described how she and a boyfriend 
-- inspired by some classic surfer films -- went down to "the cold, wet, soggy 
sand of Windansea early on a December morning." 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe featured the entire essay in his pump house story, the tale of "two kids, 
a 14-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy, (who) go out to Windansea at dawn, 
cold as hell, and take on 12-foot waves all by themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Jackie Haddad Hellingson is a real estate broker and mother of two, who 
married a surfer named Ken whom she met at the pump house back then. The couple 
and their 17-year-old son live in La Jolla's Muirlands area -- not far from 
Windansea Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Ken, a carpenter, still has the Mac Meda tattoo on his left arm. Jackie still 
has that essay tucked away in a notebook somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
But she gave up surfing long ago. Now she's busy with a career and a family -- 
especially keeping pace with Tyler, her teen-aged son who says he's the new 
generation Pump House Gang. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Jackie still goes to the beach at Windansea. But now it's just to 
think, take evening walks and watch the peaceful winter sunsets. And, 
sometimes, just to remember the freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the simplicity of the beach -- of not having to make decisions," she 
said. "You didn't have to plan, things just came up. As an adult, it's not 
quite the same." 
</P>
<P>
Her home is still a gathering spot for teen-agers. Kids say they can talk to 
her. She isn't bothered by the changes of the youth culture that come in fits 
and starts -- the length of a boy's hair or the way teen-age girls dress. 
</P>
<P>
She's not an Outsider. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent weekday morning, sharing the old pump house steps with a defiant 
sea gull, she silently surveyed the roaring surf. "Wow, good womp today!" she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But she slips now and then. She stops thinking and acting like the young 
hipster of her past and starts acting, well, like a parent. 
</P>
<P>
Such as the other day, when she was talking with Tyler about the limited access 
to a beach near their home. "And, before I caught myself, I was saying that 
something permanent should be done so more people could get to the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Tyler gave his mother The Stare. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh no, not that," he said. "Don't you understand? We want the beach to 
ourselves."

FISCAL PICTURE FOR MUSIC CENTER IS BRIGHTER

<P>
The situation at the Music Center of Los Angeles County is very different from 
OCPAC, in part because it is a very different organization, a complex but 
well-established interlocking of the resident performing companies, the Music 
Center and the Music Center Operating Company. 
</P>
<P>
Economic indicators may be down, but the Music Center -- the public-private 
partnership that serves the resident Music Center companies as an umbrella 
fund-raiser -- is launching a long-range plan that proposes a 15% increase in 
fund raising for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned -- no question -- about the (economic) environment," said 
Esther Wachtell, president of the Music Center. She reports that the demand for 
the services of the resident companies -- the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Center 
Theatre Group, Los Angeles Music Center Opera, the Los Angeles Master Chorale 
and the Joffrey Ballet LA/NY -- and the Music Center Education Division has 
risen 20% in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan very far in advance," Wachtell said. "Over a year ago, we developed a 
strategic plan, which went into effect in July." This plan mandated a goal of 
$17.6 million for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very early -- this is preparation time for us -- but from what we can 
gather, we are right on target," Wachtell said. 
</P>
<P>
From that money comes the budget for the Music Center itself, and large 
contributions to the resident companies, such as $4.4 million to the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic for the 1988-89 season, or the cash infusions to the 
Joffrey Ballet. Although the resident companies receive government support, the 
Music Center funds are entirely from the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
The Music Center also does not book or produce presentations, so it cannot lose 
money at the box office. The resident companies present other performing 
groups, and the Music Center Operating Company books the facilities for the 
times -- basically only a few weeks in the summer -- when the resident 
companies are not using them. 
</P>
<P>
The Operating Company, which is charged with the maintenance of the facilities, 
is supported in part through the county of Los Angeles, but mainly through 
rents that the resident companies pay. 
</P>
<P>
The resident companies naturally find themselves in varying conditions. 
Philharmonic subscriptions are up and the company is moving ahead with 
ambitious plans, as is the Music Center Opera, which recently announced the 
$1-million donors to its Angel fund-raising program. Subscriptions are down 
slightly for the Master Chorale, with a lame duck music director and no 
successor named, and the financial woes of the Joffrey Ballet have been much 
reported 
</P>
<P>
The Center Theatre Group has been buoyed by an infusion of cash from its tenant 
at the Ahmanson Theatre, "The Phantom of the Opera." The rental necessitated 
moving the Ahmanson play series to the Doolittle Theatre in Hollywood, where 
it's reported to be running at a break-even level; the books for the CTG's 
other half, the Mark Taper Forum, have recently shown a slight surplus. JOHN

CENTER HURT BY ECONOMY, GULF CRISIS, DIRECTOR SAYS;

County Performing Arts Center executive director Thomas R. Kendrick blames the 
economy and world events for dismal box-office showings at his hall this summer 
and fall. 
</P>
<P>
But he does acknowledge that several of the programming choices that ended in 
financial failure were chancy undertakings, even under normal circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"The wall came down" on the Australian Ballet in early August, Kendrick said, 
despite the excellent reviews the company had received in New York and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We woke up in the morning and Hussein had invaded Kuwait. (Ticket sales) 
stopped, just about like that. It just didn't move. And then it deepened. 
During the summer we used to go out there and wonder where all the people had 
gone, (if) they really had gone to the beach. And maybe they did, because the 
beach didn't cost money." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the $250,000 loss (called a "subsidy") budgeted to underwrite 
the ballet, the center lost $26,000 in ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later came a co-production with the La Jolla Playhouse of "A Funny 
Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum," which also was well-reviewed. But 
again, there was bad news. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the troop commitments, the beginning of the budget crisis buildup," 
Kendrick recalled. "It all hit in there. That wall that had come down the day 
after the Kuwaiti invasion just stayed there and got worse." 
</P>
<P>
Kendrick said that "Forum's" failure cost $400,000, including the center's 
production investment. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no argument that ("Forum") was being done in the summer, which is 
risky," Kendrick admitted. "There was no subscription, which is risky, and 
there was no star -- it had all those things against it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But, he continued, "the success was so extraordinary in the summer of 1989 that 
it gave us the impetus to go forward in 1990. Remember, we didn't have a 
crystal ball of what the economy would be in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
The New York City Ballet, which sold out in its last appearance at the center, 
sold only 85% of the seats in late September. "I don't consider that any kind 
of triumph," said Kendrick, noting that the subsidy for the New York Ballet was 
even larger than that for the Australian Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
There were still more losses in October when Britain's D'Oyly Carte Opera 
Company performed "Pirates of Penzance" and "The Mikado." Just over half the 
seats were sold, despite good reviews. 
</P>
<P>
The major bright spot, Kendrick said, is that the current Broadway series 
closed out subscriptions at 78% of capacity, with almost no promotion. "It was 
a strong series," Kendrick explained. "It had the element of a sure thing. . . 
. People are buying the sure thing. They are buying what is safe."

EAGLE ROCK PLAN TAKES SHAPE; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE EFFORT WOULD ENCOURAGE PRESERVATION OF HISTORIC BUILDINGS 
ALONG COLORADO BOULEVARD AND OUTLAW MINI-MALLS ALONG MOST OF THE STRIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On April Fool's Day, 1986, Eagle Rock activist Kathleen Aberman climbed atop a 
treasured old Colorado Boulevard commercial building and tried to ward off a 
demolition crew. She was hauled off to jail, the brick storefront was destroyed 
and a mini-mall was erected in its place. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, community leaders have pursued a less dramatic, more time-consuming 
approach to shaping development on Eagle Rock's main commercial street. In 
cooperation with city planners, they've put together a set of strict new 
building rules called the Colorado Boulevard Specific Plan. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which is nearing a critical final review by the Los Angeles City 
Planning Commission, would impose height limits and new parking and landscaping 
requirements. It would also encourage the preservation of historic buildings 
and protect adjoining residential areas. Along most of the strip, it would 
outlaw mini-malls. 
</P>
<P>
For Aberman, the plan is a culmination of the community outcry that gathered 
force after she spent a day behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
"What we learned is, that's not the way to do it," she said. "You have to work 
through the system." 
</P>
<P>
To provide a stronger voice on development issues, Aberman helped organize The 
Eagle Rock Assn., which is represented on the advisory committee that worked on 
the Colorado Boulevard Specific Plan. 
</P>
<P>
When the new development rules are adopted by the City Council, possibly in 
mid-1991, Aberman said: "We will breathe a sigh of relief that we don't have to 
worry whenever we see that something is for sale and wonder what's going to be 
built there." 
</P>
<P>
But one major hurdle remains. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory committee has urged the city to create a design review board whose 
membership would consist of Eagle Rock residents and business leaders. The 
group would make sure Colorado Boulevard building proposals are consistent with 
design guidelines for the area. 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, city planning commissioners approved all other elements of the 
building guide. But the commissioners said they would not establish a design 
review board for the area unless the community comes up with a well-defined 
building style to impose on developers. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Duenas, a Los Angeles city planner, said his department has proposed 
design review guidelines that would encourage Colorado Boulevard developers to 
use a brick building style, prominent during the early 1900s. Other building 
materials may be permitted in some cases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
This design review proposal will be discussed by the Colorado Boulevard 
advisory committee at a public meeting scheduled for 7 p.m. today at Eagle Rock 
City Hall. The Los Angeles Planning Commission will reconsider establishing the 
design review board Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed architectural guidelines, developers would be urged to 
include design elements that were common on old Eagle Rock buildings, such as 
exterior bands or ledges that distinguish between each story. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanmarie Hance-Murphy, a planning aide to Councilman Richard Alatorre, who 
represents Eagle Rock, said city planners initially wanted to limit the design 
review board's authority to a few blocks where the brick architectural style is 
clearly evident. But she said Alatorre believes the review board should have 
jurisdiction over a larger central section of Colorado Boulevard within Eagle 
Rock, and Duenas said his department now supports that change. 
</P>
<P>
The overall development guidelines would affect the commercial area between 
Eagledale Avenue on the west and Eagle Vista Drive on the east. 
</P>
<P>
This stretch is home to an array of businesses, including mini-malls, 
carwashes, offices, inexpensive motels and restaurants, car-repair shops and 
neighborhood retail stores. The boulevard has a mix of older and modern 
buildings, some well-maintained and others in need of repair. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters say the Colorado Boulevard plan will assure orderly construction of 
attractive new businesses if the development boom that has occurred in 
neighboring Glendale and Pasadena spreads to Eagle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed plan, new buildings at the eastern and western ends of the 
strip could be no taller than four stories, or 55 feet. In the central section, 
between Windermere and Floristan avenues, the limit would be two stories, or 30 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
Strict new sign rules would be imposed, prohibiting gaudy outdoor displays. 
Along most of the boulevard, certain types of businesses could no longer be 
built, including auto-repair shops, storage yards, drive-through fast-food 
restaurants, mini-malls and rescue missions. 
</P>
<P>
The central shopping area would be oriented to pedestrians, with landscaping in 
front and parking at the rear of the businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"The character of old Eagle Rock was being destroyed by having parking lots 
facing the streets, instead of the quaint commercial frontages on the 
boulevard," said Jeff Samudio, an architect who represents The Eagle Rock Assn. 
on the advisory panel. "We're trying to encourage developments that would be 
compatible with the older buildings that have already been identified as 
historic structures." 
</P>
<P>
Samudio and other members of the advisory committee urged the city to allow 
angled street parking, wide sidewalks, benches and street medians, similar to 
Glendale's Brand Boulevard. But city traffic officials vetoed that idea, saying 
angled parking would interfere with the traffic flow on Colorado Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagle Rock Chamber of Commerce initially was concerned that rigid new 
building rules might discourage new development. But chamber President Kaye 
Beckham, who also serves on the Colorado Boulevard committee, said the 
organization does not oppose the final plan. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she warned that the primary impact of the new guidelines would be only 
on new development and will not immediately rid the street of unsightly or 
undesirable businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to work with this. But it's not going to happen overnight," said 
Beckham, who owns a home health-care business. "It's going to take a lot of 
time."

GLENMORE CANYON RESIDENTS ASK FOR FIRE CHIEF'S OUSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Saying the Glendale Fire Department sacrificed their neighborhood during a June 
hillside blaze, Glenmore Canyon residents Wednesday urged the City Council to 
oust the city's fire chief and compensate victims for uninsured losses. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter hand-delivered to Glendale City Hall, Rob Sharkey, president of the 
Glenmore Canyon Homeowners Assn., also asked the council to seek an independent 
investigation of the manner in which the fire was fought. The association is 
also seeking a council pledge that the city will provide equal fire protection 
for all hillside homes. 
</P>
<P>
Sharkey said the letter is based on five resolutions adopted recently by the 
board of his association, which represents owners of about 200 houses. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never gone to the City Council with any of these requests," he said. "We 
hope they will be fair-minded and just. Failing to ask, nothing will happen. 
This isn't a wish list. It represents the feelings of the fire victims. People 
just don't feel safe at this point." 
</P>
<P>
In Glenmore Canyon, 14 houses were destroyed and another six were damaged in 
the June 27 fire. Residents have complained that their houses burned while they 
waited two hours for firefighters to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, a coalition of Glendale homeowner associations asked the state's 
fire marshal and attorney general to investigate the way firefighters fought 
the blaze, which damaged or destroyed 64 homes in Glenmore Canyon and two other 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Both state officials rejected the plea, saying it was outside their 
jurisdiction. Sharkey made the same request Oct. 30 to the California Joint 
Senate-Assembly Committee on Police, Fire, Emergency and Disaster Services. But 
committee members urged the association to pursue its grievances through local 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents have questioned whether Glendale officials can conduct an 
impartial review of city firefighting policies, but Sharkey said his 
association agreed to take its concerns to the local governing body. 
</P>
<P>
In the Glendale Fire Department's own analysis, released Oct. 23, fire 
officials acknowledged that Glenmore Canyon was "devoid of firefighting 
resources for approximately two hours into the incident." 
</P>
<P>
But Fire Chief John Montenero defended the strategy, saying it was necessary to 
concentrate firefighting efforts in another neighborhood at the fire's eastern 
edge to keep it from burning into Pasadena. Montenero said this tactic helped 
save more than 700 houses, and he said he would use it again under similar 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Montenero was on vacation and unavailable for comment Wednesday on the 
association's call for his removal. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Larry Zarian said Wednesday: "Overall, I'm satisfied with Chief 
Montenero and his staff and their handling of firefighting in the city. I feel 
the department is run very professionally." 
</P>
<P>
However, he added that "if the question is, 'Are we perfect?' the answer is, 
'No, we're not perfect.' Is there room for improvement? Absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
Zarian said he had not read the association's letter Wednesday morning, but he 
promised to review it with City Manager David Ramsay and other council members. 
He said he may meet with Sharkey and other association members to discuss the 
group's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The letter asserted that "Glenmore Canyon was sacrificed to the June 27th fire 
without just cause" and that the Fire Department's own analysis of the blaze 
was "replete with fallacies, omissions and contradictions." 
</P>
<P>
It also asked the council to seek an independent investigation by the Los 
Angeles County district attorney and the Los Angeles County Grand Jury 
concerning the way the fire was fought. 
</P>
<P>
The letter asked the council to respond within 15 days. 
</P>
<P>
Sharkey said he is sending copies of the resolutions to 10 other Glendale 
homeowner associations, seeking their support.

NEW BOOK IS THE LAST WORD ON UCLA SLANG; 
</P>
<P>
LANGUAGE: A PROFESSOR HAS TRANSLATED THE TERMINOLOGY USED BY JOE AND JOSEPHINE 
BRUINS AT PRETTY PEOPLE UNIVERSITY.

<P>
Not too long ago, linguistics professor Pamela Munro didn't know a "beauhunk" 
from a "goob." 
</P>
<P>
Then she started assigning her students at UCLA to collect slang terms. And 
last fall, after students in her Linguistics 88A seminar had collected and 
compiled an extensive list, they decided they had the makings of a book. 
</P>
<P>
The result, a dictionary called "U.C.L.A. Slang," is a hot item in the 
bookstore at "Pretty People University" (UCLA). Now, even the most uncool 
"remos" (nerds) on campus who may "jones for" (really want) popularity can use 
the dictionary to learn what's hip. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,300 copies have been sold locally. The dictionary has been so well 
received that Harmony Books, which is a part of Random House, has picked it up 
for publication and will release a more comprehensive version under the title 
"Slang U," expected to reach bookstores by early February. 
</P>
<P>
Although excited over the dictionary's success, Munro is taking the hoopla -- 
not to be confused with "brewhaha," which at UCLA means beer -- in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody is interested in slang," she said. "A lot of the expressions 
in the dictionary are funny." 
</P>
<P>
The dictionary is popular not just among the school's "beauhunks" (gorgeous 
men) and "bettys" (gorgeous women), "goobs" and "dweebs" (nerds of any sex), 
and "way fashionable studs." Parents are also getting in on the action. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a number of parents say they bought the dictionary so they could 
understand what their child is saying," Munro said. "Some read it and say they 
can't believe people are saying these things." 
</P>
<P>
A linguistics professor at UCLA since 1974, Munro said she was turned on to the 
richness of slang in 1981 by Connie Eble, a professor at the University of 
North Carolina at Chapel Hill who publishes papers on campus slang each year. 
</P>
<P>
The use of slang is nothing new, Munro noted. One of its functions is to help 
define distinct social groups. 
</P>
<P>
Munro said the ephemeral quality of slang is unpredictable. "Some slang words 
stay around and some don't," she said. "It's really hard to say which ones will 
last." 
</P>
<P>
Although some of the entries in the dictionary are common to campuses across 
the nation, Munro said many are unique to "Joe and Josephine Bruins" (UCLA 
students). 
</P>
<P>
Slang, she said, comes from a variety of sources. Some terms are adaptations of 
existing words, some are compounded or come from standard vocabulary and others 
are words picked up from television and movie characters. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Munro cited a popular word that is not listed in the campus 
dictionary but will be in the Harmony Books version: "Sally," a name given to a 
woman who is compulsive and meticulous. It comes from the movie "When Harry Met 
Sally," Munro said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the study of slang is only a small portion of her work, Munro said it 
has been enlightening. 
</P>
<P>
"If you study any kind of language, you learn a great respect for the human 
brain," she said. "There are clever minds that come up with these slangs, and 
you think, 'How did someone come up with this?' " 
</P>
<P>
No doubt the students at UCLA think it's "no biggie." They come up with slang 
terms "24-7" (all the time, derived from 24 hours a day, seven days a week). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'U.C.L.A. SLANG': A SAMPLER 
</P>
<P>
Here is a sampling of words and expressions found in "U.C.L.A. Slang": 
</P>
<P>
adonis -- extremely nice-looking, breathtaking; used as a noun or adjective. 
</P>
<P>

</P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
filet -- cute girl.

<P>
foof -- superficial person. 
</P>

FAMILIES GET TIPS ON COPING WITH ALZHEIMER'S DURING HOLIDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The elderly Hollywood man was talking about Thanksgiving at a recent workshop 
on helping families cope with Alzheimer's disease during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"The holidays are great," said the man, 80, who takes care of his 
Alzheimer's-afflicted wife of 51 years. Thanksgiving is not only good for the 
person with the disease, he said, "it's also good for the care-giver because it 
gives them a chance to relax with other people." 
</P>
<P>
The man smiled. And then he burst into tears. 
</P>
<P>
The holidays are often hellish for families dealing with Alzheimer's and other 
conditions that produce dementia or loss of cognitive abilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood man, for instance, was uncertain whether he and his spouse would 
be able to join their son in San Diego for Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
His wife has been suffering from a bladder infection recently, and her 
progressive brain disorder is constantly producing new deficits and 
complications. Since she became ill, the woman is anxious whenever she travels. 
Her husband worried that the unfamiliar pounding of the wheels of the train 
would unnerve her. 
</P>
<P>
It is almost too much to bear, especially alone, the man made clear. When you 
have Alzheimer's in the family, he said before his tears drove him from the 
room in embarrassment, "everybody walks away." 
</P>
<P>
At a recent workshop in Century City, the Los Angeles chapter of the 
Alzheimer's Assn. and the Westside Consortium of Senior Services offered 
Alzheimer's care-givers practical advice and the bitter solace of knowing that 
others are suffering too. 
</P>
<P>
"The holidays are often a very joyful time, but they can also be very, very 
difficult," said Lynn Morishita, program director for the Center for Geriatric 
Health at Century City Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The grown-up children of people with Alzheimer's routinely feel cheated, the 
experts said. The children gather around the table, remembering when mom or dad 
successfully stage-managed beloved holiday traditions, and they see only loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Holidays carry a lot of emotional wallop," said Nina Luce, a Santa Monica 
marriage and family counselor who specializes in geriatric issues. "We remember 
how it was and, if we don't get it, we're crushed." 
</P>
<P>
Holidays often precipitate a crisis among siblings, the speakers pointed out. 
Family members who live elsewhere often come home for the holidays only to 
discover that a parent or grandparent is much worse than they had realized from 
long-distance phone calls. Brothers and sisters sometimes blame the sibling who 
does most of the care-giving, who in turn typically feels overburdened. 
</P>
<P>
The experts agreed that a good first step in dealing with Alzheimer's is to 
have a family consultation with a caseworker or someone else with expertise in 
dementia and the medical, emotional and legal problems it creates. The earlier 
the family begins to think about these issues, the better, they said. For 
example, Jewish Family Service, Santa Monica, is a nonprofit agency that 
provides such services to anyone on a sliding fee scale. 
</P>
<P>
The experts also recommended that the family arrange to have the affected 
individual evaluated at a good geriatric health center. Some of the 
deficiencies associated with Alzheimer's are treatable, they said. For example, 
better diet may help a little. "A lot of older people are living on toast and 
tea," Luce pointed out. A complete evaluation will not only reveal what's wrong 
with the affected person, it will also help the family take full advantage of 
those abilities that remain, Morishita said. 
</P>
<P>
Two sisters at the workshop admitted that they dreaded the thought of 
Thanksgiving. They planned to fly to Arizona, where they were to have a turkey 
dinner with their father, then visit their mother, 66, who has been 
institutionalized with Alzheimer's for almost a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real depressing," the younger sister said. "They have all these cards and 
ads on TV, and they just make you feel worse." 
</P>
<P>
Morishita said such sadness is normal. The person with dementia "is here, but 
they are not the person they were." Their loved ones, she said, "are grieving 
all the time." 
</P>
<P>
One reason the holidays are so difficult is that they underscore the role 
reversal that is one of the most painful aspects of dealing with dementia. 
</P>
<P>
As Joyce Brunelle, who does public relations for the Westside consortium, said: 
"Two things that life never prepares us for are parenting and parenting our own 
parent." Unfortunately, she noted, the intense emotion that Alzheimer's 
triggers in a family often complicates the coping process, which involves 
making difficult decisions about everything from where the patient will live to 
who will control his or her money. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be very practical at this stage," Brunelle said. "You have to be 
very dispassionate about it." 
</P>
<P>
The speakers urged care-givers to give themselves a break over the holidays. 
Less is more, the experts said. Don't try to replicate the lavish holidays of 
the past, but pick a few favorite traditions and concentrate on them. 
Simplified holiday activities are also easier on the person with Alzheimer's, 
who is often unsettled by changes in routine and unusual bustle and clutter. 
</P>
<P>
Start to prepare the affected person for the upcoming holiday well in advance 
by marking the calendar, having daily discussions of what the family will do, 
playing holiday music and, when feasible, making holiday foods. 
</P>
<P>
As Thanksgiving gives way to Hanukkah and Christmas, gifts become a problem. 
</P>
<P>
People with dementia often enjoy videotapes of family members, the experts 
said. And Brunelle noted that some people like to give a donation in the name 
of the person with Alzheimer's to a charity that was especially important to 
him or her before life changed forever. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At the Alzheimer's workshop, occupational therapist Laura Caron-Parker offered 
these tips for holiday safety and stress reduction: 
</P>
<P>
* Remember that a Hanukkah menorah and candles on a holiday table are potential 
dangers to the person with Alzheimer's. Put all matches and lighters away after 
using. If you can child-proof your house for the holidays, you can make it safe 
for the person with dementia, Caron-Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
* Use only unbreakable ornaments on the Christmas tree and hang them with 
ribbon, not metal hooks. Remember that such traditional holiday plants as 
poinsettia and mistletoe are poisonous if ingested. 
</P>
<P>
* Avoid blinking holiday lights. They seem to increase the confusion and 
agitation of people with dementia. Shiny, reflective wrapping paper that causes 
visual distortions also seems to have this effect and should be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
* Gifts should be kept out of sight until they are exchanged. Left under the 
tree or elsewhere in the open, they increase visual clutter. The person with 
Alzheimer's may also open gifts that are left out, no matter who they are meant 
for. 
</P>
<P>
* Limit the number of holiday visitors, prepare them for the changes they will 
see in the affected person, and schedule their visits for morning and early 
afternoon, when people with dementia are usually at their best.

JUDGE'S RULING FOR APARTMENTS WILL STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale officials have decided not to appeal a Superior Court ruling that will 
force the city to process three applications to build about 60 apartments and 
condominiums, City Atty. Scott H. Howard said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The city rejected the housing developments after a building moratorium was 
enacted in 1988. Judge Edward M. Ross ruled last month that because the 
moratorium was declared illegal in court, the city had no right to continue to 
turn down the developers. 
</P>
<P>
City officials vowed to appeal, fearing that the judge had opened the door to a 
flood of development proposals based on less restrictive 1988 building rules. 
</P>
<P>
But Howard said Tuesday that there will be no appeal because Ross' ruling 
affects only the three projects listed by the Moratorium Litigation Committee, 
which brought the matter to court. 
</P>
<P>
A second building freeze, adopted legally in 1989, is set to end in December.

POLICE REPORT LITTLE PROGRESS IN SHOOTING DEATHS OF 2 MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police said they have made little progress in investigating the deaths of two 
young men who died in separate gang-related shootings during the Thanksgiving 
weekend in northeast Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
There were no leads in Sunday's shooting death of Richard Pacheco, 18, of Eagle 
Rock, said Detective Lauren Zimmerman of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Northeast Division. 
</P>
<P>
Pacheco and a companion, neither believed to be gang members, were walking in 
the 3100 block of Estara Street in Atwater Village when a car drove up. A 
passenger fired one shot, hitting Pacheco, police said. Witnesses told police 
that a passenger emerged and fired three more shots at Pacheco, who died at 
Glendale Memorial Hospital of head and back wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Police have some leads but no suspects in the death of Edward Hueda, 17, of 
Silver Lake, who was killed Wednesday night at what police called a gang party. 
</P>
<P>
Hueda was standing with a group in the front yard of a house in the 1600 block 
of North Alvarado Street in Echo Park when a man, believed by police to be a 
member of a rival gang, emerged from behind the house and shot at the group 
with a handgun, Zimmerman said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman escaped. Hueda died at Cigna Hospital in Los Angeles of gunshot 
wounds in the head and back. 
</P>
<P>
Veronica Velasco, 17, and Alex Salmones, 17, were treated for minor injuries at 
the same hospital and released.

NHL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
QUEBEC FINDS VICTORY COINCIDES WITH LUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For five weeks the Quebec Nordiques played some horrible hockey. And the few 
times they did play well, their luck was poor. 
</P>
<P>
The Nordiques, after a victory Oct. 20 over Detroit, lost 14 in a row and went 
winless in 17 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
Their luck changed for the better Wednesday night at Hartford. Two fluke goals 
helped Quebec squeeze out a 4-3 victory over the Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
The first two Quebec goals were flukes. Claude Loiselle's centering pass hit 
teammate Jamie Baker's skate and slid between goalie Daryl Reaugh's pads for a 
short-handed goal only 2:37 after the opening faceoff. Later in the period Guy 
Lafleur's centering pass hit teammate Tony McKegney, who had fallen to the ice, 
in the helmet and caromed into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Nordique goaltender Ron Tugnutt stopped 40 shots, and Hartford shots by Randy 
Cunneyworth and Terry Yake hit posts. With a chance to tie, Kevin Dineen, 
trying to guide a shot by Ulf Samuelson, knocked it just over the net. 
</P>
<P>
Tugnutt stopped 16 shots in the last 18 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was about time we had a little luck," Tugnutt said. "Maybe this is what we 
need to turn it around. I hope so." 
</P>
<P>
Washington 6, New York Rangers 3 -- Another long streak came to an end at New 
York. The Rangers (5-0-5) had not lost in their last 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
But rookie Peter Bondra, who had only six goals in his first 22 NHL games, had 
a hat trick to lead the Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
With Bondra's three goals, the Capitals built a 6-1 lead by the middle of the 
third period. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 2, Montreal 1 -- Mikko Makela's eighth goal of the season early in the 
third period at Montreal enabled the struggling Sabres to get a much-needed 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens, who have won only twice in their last six games, heard boos most 
of the night. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 5, New Jersey 5 -- Rick Tocchet scored his second goal of the game 
with 49 seconds left at East Rutherford, N.J., to climax the Flyer rally. 
</P>
<P>
The Devils had a 5-2 lead with less than four minutes remaining, but rookie 
Darren Rumble and Terry Carkner scored to get the Flyers close. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg 2, Calgary 2 -- The Jets spotted the Flames two first-period goals at 
Winnipeg, then battled back to get the tie. 
</P>
<P>
New star Ed Olczyk got the tying goal on a power play in the first minute of 
the last period. DAN HAFNER

VALLEY PUBLISHERS FIND AN INTEREST -- AND FILL IT WITH MAGAZINES; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: THERE ARE PUBLICATIONS ABOUT OPERA, NUTRITION, MUSCLES, MUSIC, 
MOTORCYCLES, RADIO ELECTRONICS, HAIR, CONSTRUCTION, FOOD AND WINES, HOCKEY AND 
UNDERGROUND CABLES. 
</P>

By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES: Reilly is a regular contributor to Valley 
View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley is not widely thought of as a citadel of culture. 
</P>
<P>
But hold on a second. 
</P>
<P>
If one equates literary output with intellectual and artistic endeavor, the 
Valley would seem to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
There may be more magazines published per square inch in these parts than 
anywhere outside of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to get a fix on exactly how much is being published in the county, 
according to Fred Braden, general manager of Valley magazine, because there is 
a great fluctuation due to start-ups and shutdowns, and because many magazines 
are given away or do not request validation from the national Audit Bureau of 
Circulation for their subscription and newsstand numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, almost 120 publications emanate from the corridor that runs from 
Agoura to Glendale and north. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, the term literary is open to interpretation when applied to some of 
the more esoteric publications. 
</P>
<P>
Easyriders, for example, is a less than cultured look at bikes, bikers and 
other macho stuff. The magazine, most likely, will not be the publishing 
vehicle of discovery for the second coming of Proust. 
</P>
<P>
Neither, for that matter, will the glossy Nailpro, which addresses itself to 
those who service people who are very concerned with the condition of their 
fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
The magazines published in this area cover subjects that range from foreign 
cars to managing gift shops. If you want to be a land baron or make more money 
or develop your muscles or learn about walls and ceilings, there's a magazine 
published in the Valley for you. 
</P>
<P>
There are others that tell you about the insider's Hollywood, how to sell a 
song, how to do special effects, how to meditate and how to get a job. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the publications are simply glorified newsletters and special interest 
publications that appeal to a narrow segment of society, but they sometimes 
have an international reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Opera Quarterly is a robust, slick 200-page international publication for aria 
addicts that has a small but devoted 5,000-subscription base and sells another 
3,000 copies on newsstands in North and South America, South Korea, France, 
England, Argentina, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Peru, according to its editor, 
Bruce Burroughs, who works out of his Van Nuys apartment. 
</P>
<P>
If exotic wheels rev your engine, there is British Car, another slick little 
mover that has 65,000 subscribers in the United States and other outposts of 
what was once the British Empire, people wishing to keep up on Rolls-Royce 
classics and those zippy little Mini Coopers. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley has a nationally recognized publication for those with a need to 
stay au courant on nutrition, radio electronics, communications, hair styling, 
construction, food and wines, kidney dialysis and transplantations, the gas 
industry, hockey, Iran, Israel, marketing, or tile and decorative surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
But like other segments of the business community, publishing is adopting a 
bunker mentality for what looks like hard times. And some publications have 
already had them. More than a few periodicals publish, briefly, and then 
perish. 
</P>
<P>
Braden, whose Valley magazine has an audited circulation of 32,000, said there 
is a 90% mortality rate for any new magazine because of undercapitalization. 
Even Valley -- which has been published for 13 years and has the fallback 
financial resources of owner Jane Boeckman's family money -- is gearing up to 
broaden its circulation base in the face of current economic realities. 
</P>
<P>
Muscle and magazine magnate Joe Weider is a good example. The best buddy of 
bodybuilders like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno had a recent failure 
with his Moxie magazine, which was meant to appeal to the blue-collar woman 
interested in fashion as well as fitness. Weider's Woodland Hills-based empire 
is estimated to produce in excess of $350 million annually, according to report 
in the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
Moxie, after less than a year's run, apparently did not draw either enough 
readership or advertising to warrant the continuing publication expense. 
According to a Weider spokesman, the magazine is being retooled. 
</P>
<P>
But one disappointment does not an empire topple, and Weider -- a gruff, 
self-made man -- is rightfully an example to other would-be publishers who have 
a lot to say but little money for saying it. 
</P>
<P>
Weider, born in Canada 67 years ago, started in the publishing business by 
putting together a newsletter for bodybuilders when he was a 17-year-old high 
school dropout. The newsletter, after several evolutions, became Muscle &amp; 
Fitness and, along with Weider's other bodybuilder publication, Flex, has a 
hammerlock on the less well-developed competition. 
</P>
<P>
One food supplement company that was not allowed to advertise in Weider's 
bodybuilding publications -- which look like a catalogue for Weider's own line 
of body enhancing products -- took the master blaster to court, charging that 
his publications are so important in the industry that they have created a 
monopolistic environment. Although the case was dismissed, it did point out the 
importance of Weider in the fitness marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Another Valley publishing success story is in Agoura where the Rouse family is 
gearing up to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Trailer Life magazine, a motor 
home publication that has a 350,000 subscriber base. It is the slick flagship 
of the company, which puts out eight other publications related to mobile 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
Art Rouse, a former advertising executive, bought Trailer Life in 1958. In 
1969, he began acquiring other publications, including MotorHome, RV Business 
and, in a stroke of genius, the Good Sam Club, which now has about 800,000 
RV-owning members that receive a Rouse publication called Highways. 
</P>
<P>
Art Rouse was bought out of the business five years ago by his sons, Richard 
and Denis, who subsequently sold the company to a New York investment firm that 
in turn sold it to Adams Communications. The Rouse sons, however, still manage 
the publications, which now gross about $60 million annually, according to 
Trailer Life's editor, Bill Estes. 
</P>
<P>
Although Weider and Rouse were businessmen who basically cornered the market on 
what was an untapped demographic resource, a lot of Valley publishers got into 
the business as reluctant entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
Madeline Williamson said she started Lifestyle, an ad-driven (as opposed to 
paid circulation) general interest magazine serving Agoura, Hidden Hills and 
Calabasas, because she couldn't get a job. 
</P>
<P>
"I graduated from CSUN in 1985 with a new degree in journalism and found that 
no one wanted to hire a 40-year-old, first-time editor," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson decided to give herself a job and turned her garage into an office 
to produce and distribute a Calabasas neighborhood newsletter. That was the 
height of her publishing ambitions until a local builder offered to help 
finance a more upscale magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"The contractor said he was putting up a major development in the area and 
would more or less subsidize a four-color publication with his advertising," 
Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
All went well until the contractor's homes were sold and the ads disappeared. 
Williamson said she really had to scramble. 
</P>
<P>
"Luckily the communities we serve are affluent and advertisers like the 
demographics. Still we have had to work hard to keep the cash flowing," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson said she is considering a number of offers to infuse capital into 
the operation so that she will have a financial cushion and be able to expand. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Carver and Carol Summer, two other accidental publishers, started their 
Creative Age publishing house, now in Van Nuys, because they were both fired 
from their jobs with a Brentwood trade publishing company in 1972. Instead of 
getting paranoid, they got busy. 
</P>
<P>
They identified a couple of professions they thought could use a trade 
publication, went to work doing a mock-up and arm-twisted a bank into loaning 
them start-up costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of doing just one magazine we did three," Carver said, remembering the 
craziness of the first year. The magazines were Dialysis and Transplantation, 
Emergency Medical Service and Undergrounding, which tells people how to lay 
cables underground. 
</P>
<P>
"We had $20,000 and a lot of nerve," Carver said, "but we really didn't have a 
lot of choice. We were two single mothers with kids to care for and bills to 
pay." 
</P>
<P>
In 18 years, they have started eight magazines and business is good enough that 
they own their own office building and admit to a comfortable living. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes the success so incredible," Carver said, "is that we had never 
heard the term cash flow when we started out. Our accountant was in shock." 
</P>
<P>
He's a lot happier now. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Valley's publications are not going to send the aesthetically 
starved into ecstasy, nor are there any general circulation heavyweights like 
Vanity Fair or People or Esquire emanating from these parts. 
</P>
<P>
But if you want to know "how to" or "what's new" in a particular field, the 
Valley probably prints it. 
</P>
<P>
Or will soon.

CSUN NATURE STUDENTS SURVIVE THE BIG CHILL OF THE WILDERNESS; 
</P>
<P>
PULLING AN ALL-NIGHTER

DOMELAND WILDERNESS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One by one, the students disengage from modern life -- automobile, warmth, real 
food -- and plan their procession into the past. They have come for college 
credits, but this isn't about making the grade. It's about making shelter and 
food, tools and traps, something out of nothing. Their most prized possession 
is their creativity. They hope that it keeps them alive. 
</P>
<P>
The class, Basic Wilderness Survival, is given each semester at Cal State 
Northridge. Two weekends ago, about 30 students and a dozen teaching assistants 
joined instructor Ron Hood for 48 hours in the middle of nowhere, Domeland 
Wilderness, just east of Sequoia National Forest, about 75 miles northwest of 
Mojave. 
</P>
<P>
Here is their story: 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 11 a.m. Nov. 16, the students gather for the two-mile hike to 
their campsites. They are ready, but Hood, 46, a Green Beret in Vietnam, master 
psychologist of the woods, stalls. 
</P>
<P>
"You see some of them are getting real nervous, anxious to get going," Hood 
says. "Listen to their sound level. They're talking fast. In a real survival 
situation, the tension level would be high, and we want them to get as close to 
that as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Hood also wants to put pressure on the students by giving them only a few hours 
of sunlight to make their shelter; haste is a must in the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the final pep talk, which sounds more scary than soothing. 
"There is a possibility Saturday night of snow," he warns, adding evacuation 
may be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
He tells them to avoid camping in caves with Indian markings. "It's possible 
you'll find human body parts here. If you find a skull, leave it. Everyone 
wants one for an ashtray." The class doesn't argue the point. Hood says that 
several years ago, one student found a dead Indian sitting in one of the caves. 
Nobody's ever gone back to check it out. 
</P>
<P>
Hood finishes, and the march begins. The most conscientious search the grounds 
for trash that they might use later for tools or weapons. Others search their 
souls. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always liked the idea of living in the wilderness someday," says Adam 
Kelly, 23, a junior majoring in English. "I guess this weekend I'll find out 
how much." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Weiss, 20, a former engineering major, was lost in the city. "Living in 
the city scares me, but I could live out here for years," he says. "I can think 
straight out here." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Fehte, 25, a business student, was about to flunk out of CSUN two years 
ago until she hooked up with Hood. Her mom flew from New Jersey, about to bring 
her home. "It was do or die for me," she says, "and I decided to take a fun 
class to get my GPA up. I took it, and it changed everything. I'm in an 
accounting firm, and I like my job, but I have to combine business and nature. 
Maybe I'll work in administration at a park." 
</P>
<P>
Hood claims that his class has rescued many unmotivated students who, by 
mastering the environment, learn studying for English or economics isn't as 
overwhelming as they first imagined. "When you confront the impossible, the 
difficult becomes easier," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Hood has taught survival for 17 years, and this will be his last semester as a 
part-time instructor at CSUN. Because of budget cutbacks, the class will be 
taught next year by a full-time teacher. Hood draws on skills he learned in 
Vietnam. When he returned to America, he blew his savings, about $70,000, on a 
three-month binge in Vegas. He didn't find peace until a visit to the Vietnam 
Memorial in Washington in 1987. "Everything bottled up inside me came out," he 
says, "and since then, I've been free." 
</P>
<P>
The students have their own immediate struggles. They cross the south fork of 
the Kern River and immediately look for shelter in the caves and hills that, 
for two days, will be home. The sun, a much-needed ally in the wilderness, will 
set in a few hours, and there is plenty to do. They must build a fire bed, 
which entails putting out a fire and placing dirt and pine needles over it to 
make a bed. 
</P>
<P>
They must also fill their canteens with water, and find anything resembling 
food. If all else fails, they can always pry open their emergency food packs, 
which Hood recommends if they become very sick. But as Stephen Kazakos, 22, 
says, "this would be the one class where you would be honestly cheating 
yourself if you did that. You would never know if you could make it." 
</P>
<P>
The class has a rule against stealing. Hood recalls the time several years ago 
when the teaching assistants suspected that someone was stealing from the 
campsites. They planted a bottle of wine and filled it with urine. The next 
morning, they noticed that the bottle was almost empty. "We got him back," Hood 
says. 
</P>
<P>
But if someone misplaces something, it's up for grabs, and the barter system 
applies. One student lost his Swiss army knife and had to collect extra 
firewood to retrieve it. 
</P>
<P>
The students separate into groups. Kazakos and three friends head far up the 
mountain, find their cave, appropriately shielded from the elements, and divvy 
up chores. Kazakos and Nick Avakian, 19, will make the fire beds, while Eddie 
Khodabakhshian, 18, collects the wood and Kristie Schmidt, 19, the pine 
needles. "When you know people," Kazakos says, "you're not afraid to speak 
out." As Hood explains, the weekend is also about getting along with others. 
</P>
<P>
Some prefer, though, to go solo. Like Tal Ovadia, 23, a student from Israel who 
will enlist next year for a three-year stint in the Israeli army. "I want to 
see if I can make it by myself," he says. "In a group, you don't learn 
everything because you're not doing it all yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Storme Warren has to go solo. Warren, 20, trying to become a full-fledged 
teaching assistant in the class, must first pass the initiation. Equipped with 
only a jacket, blanket and a few tools, he must spend a full 24 hours by 
himself in a remote corner of the camp area and accomplish a series of tasks. 
He is not allowed to communicate with anyone; one word, and he fails. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, he must contend with Hood's elaborate mind games. For each initiation, to 
create as much tension as possible -- the normal survival atmosphere -- Hood 
zeroes in on the camper's weakness. Warren's is his insatiable curiosity. So he 
won't let Warren ask any questions. 
</P>
<P>
Hood and the other teaching assistants escort Warren to his day of exile. 
Walking in single file, not uttering a sound and looking grim, the group 
marches Warren to his temporary home. Upon arriving, Hood tells Warren that he 
must build several traps and demonstrate how he can tell time by the sun and 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
Hood relents for just a minute. "We'll welcome you back with open arms at any 
time," he tells Warren before leaving. "It won't do any of us any good if you 
die out here tonight."(According to Hood, nobody has ever quit in the middle of 
a test, but many have failed. That includes Mike Albrecht, 23, who last year 
was so distraught at failing, he wouldn't attend the traditional Saturday night 
campfire. "I just hid under the cave, I was so embarrassed," Albrecht says. He 
passed last semester.) 
</P>
<P>
They head back to camp to confront other crises. Eileen Marmorek, 26, 
accidentally sits on a cactus, and one of the teaching assistants has to pull 
the pieces out. "You don't care who's looking at your butt when you have that 
stuff sticking in you," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Marmorek is making camp with her fiance, Jay Resnick, 21. The weekend is more 
than just a struggle with nature. "If we can go through this, we'll have no 
trouble with marriage," Marmorek says. 
</P>
<P>
For tonight's dinner, they plan to eat lizard stew. Among other popular foods 
are ephedra and yarrow, plants boiled to make tea. But, as Marmorek says, "you 
get so busy doing other stuff that you're really not that hungry." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone goes to sleep. It is approaching midnight, and the temperature dips 
into the mid-20s. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone sleeps well. It is Saturday morning, and Schmidt is agonizing over 
her failure to make a good fire bed. She failed to shield the fire far enough 
from the wind. She is determined to change that. "Tonight, I'll sleep like a 
queen," she promises. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, students have started on their tasks. Avakian is building a spear. 
Chriz Dally, 20, is making an arrowhead. She is deaf and communicates this 
weekend through an interpreter. Hood has taught many deaf students and says the 
wilderness, with its hidden sounds, can be much more dangerous for them. Not 
for Dally. "I feel safer here than I do in the city," she says, "where there 
are traffic signs and electrical noises." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the day is spent in leisure activities, as survival camp evolves into 
summer camp. "I just want to skip stones all day," Schmidt says, "but I know I 
have work to do." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 4 p.m., Hood and the teaching assistants take off to fetch 
Warren. He looks fine and is ready to prove that he belongs. He shows the traps 
and the shelter he made. He is then escorted to the creek where, dunked into 
freezing water with just his underwear on, he learns the good news. He passed 
the test. 
</P>
<P>
The celebration begins. Bologna sandwiches and peach Schnapps for the 
victorious survivalist. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the longest afternoon of my entire life," an exhausted Warren says. 
"I learned I had more self-confidence than I thought I had. I felt good through 
the whole thing. Failure was never an option." 
</P>
<P>
Warren joins the rest of the group for the Saturday night campfire, where jokes 
and scary stories are exchanged like a tribal ritual. Hood tells of past trips 
when groups encountered unexplained phenomena. Once, in a cave at another site, 
a camper was spooked when his equipment kept going on fire and there was no 
trace of how it started. Hood attributes these stories to the workings of the 
wilderness spirits. 
</P>
<P>
Most students seem unaffected by such talk except, perhaps, for Schmidt. "This 
kind of stuff freaks me out." 
</P>
<P>
Even though it's colder tonight -- the low was 24 degrees -- people sleep 
better. They had learned from their earlier mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so warm here," Schmidt says Sunday morning. "I didn't wake up once." 
</P>
<P>
But as the sun rises, so do the moods of even the most ardent nature lovers. 
They want to go home. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's raid Mojave," says Maria Mendoza, 24. Mojave, a small city about 25 
miles from Lancaster, is a booming metropolis compared to Domeland Wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
They pack their gear, clearing away signs of their stay, trying to measure how 
this experience fits into their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized that I can do it, and I'd like to have a career in the outdoors," 
Kelly says. 
</P>
<P>
Ovadia finds out that he could survive on his own. 
</P>
<P>
Kazakos realizes the value of cooperation. "We all worked together, and you 
need that to survive." 
</P>
<P>
And Marmorek learns a valuable lesson. "We found out that we're right for each 
other," she says. "Everyone said we'd get into a fight, but we didn't. We've 
seen each other at our worst, and we know we still love each other." 
</P>
<P>
But the trip back to reality isn't completely joyous. The survivors know that 
they will leave something behind. 
</P>
<P>
"When you drive and see the 405 and 5," Fehte says, "you're dirty and tired but 
you still want to turn around. You see that smog and a depression sets in. It's 
a real downer." 
</P>
<P>
At 9 a.m., Hood fires three gunshots into the air. It is time to hit the 
two-mile trail on the first step back to the San Fernando Valley and 
civilization. 
</P>
<P>
Things won't seem the same anymore. 
</P>

BARGAINS: BEST FURNITURE DISCOUNTS ARE IN CATALOGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERI COOK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When shopping for home furnishings, one of the best ways to save money and 
energy is the catalogue discounter. You can relax, browse through hundreds of 
catalogues, and come up with a price that is consistently 30% to 40% lower than 
retail. 
</P>
<P>
The best procedure is to shop furniture stores or home furnishings magazines, 
note the manufacturer's name and the model number of the pieces you want, then 
visit a catalogue showroom. Many of these operations will even quote on the 
telephone and save you running all over town using up gas and contributing to 
the traffic snarls. 
</P>
<P>
One of the better catalogue showrooms is Innerhouse, which will quote prices 
over the phone. Generally its figures will be lower than the major furniture 
stores at sale time. Recently, I was checking a Lane cedar chest that retails 
for $599.95. A major furniture discount store had it on sale for $449, but the 
price at Innerhouse was $390. So you don't have to wait for furniture sales if 
you shop the catalogue showrooms and you still get a better price most of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the cataloguers' very low markup is that their overhead is cut way 
down by the fact that they don't maintain costly warehouses. This also allows 
the cataloguer to represent a great many furniture companies. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the manufacturers on the Innerhouse roster are Hooker (a pine 
entertainment center that lists at $1,274 is $897), American Craftsman (a 
five-piece cherry dining set that lists for $2,340 is $1,432), Lea, Nordwyn's, 
Universal, Riverside, Heartwood, Corsican, Dino Marc Anthony, Hippopotamus, 
Chair Factory, Kessler and Stiffel. A porcelain and brass table lamp by Stiffel 
with a three-way switch is $309 instead of $475. 
</P>
<P>
The Innerhouse represents manufacturers of categories other than furniture: 
carpeting, window coverings, wall coverings, and accessories all at the same 
30% to 40% below retail. 
</P>
<P>
Delivery time ranges from three to four weeks depending on the location of the 
manufacturer. You'll save if you pick up the smaller items; an independent 
delivery service is available through Innerhouse and charges 6% of your 
purchase for delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Innerhouse is at 382 N. Allen St. in Pasadena (818) 795-1143, and at 2041 
Pacific Coast Highway in Torrance (213) 539-4002. 
</P>
<P>
Floor samples are sometimes outrageous deals. Negotiate on them. It'll pay off. 
</P>
<P>
It's cashmere sweater time, and for those who have scratched this high-ticket 
item off gift lists as being too costly, head for the annual William Kasper 
Cashmere Sale to be held Dec. 2, 3 and 4 at the Holiday Inn Westwood Plaza 
Hotel, 10740 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Prices will be dazzling, starting at $89 for a two-ply woman's sweater that 
wholesales for $139. This may be the last chance to get quality cashmere that's 
affordable.

FULLERTON MODELS THE SCOPE OF LEONARDO'S GENIUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, Cathy Curtis covers art for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, you thirtysomethings, it's never too late to get smarter. Leonardo da 
Vinci was 30 in 1482 when he began studying arithmetic and advanced geometry. A 
few years later, he began dissecting and drawing cadavers. He had already 
picked up the rudiments of machine design and operation, as a teen-age 
apprentice to hotshot sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio. And somewhere along the 
line he also learned the rudiments of architectural design and nautical 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Jack-of-all-trades and master of a remarkable number of them, Leonardo was a 
big believer in learning by doing -- and seeing. His paintings and his 
scientific and engineering discoveries were rooted in a deep faith in the value 
of experience. 
</P>
<P>
Serving as the royal "painter and engineer" for 17 years in the household of 
powerful Ludovico Sforza, the duke of Milan, Leonardo could rely on a workshop 
of apprentices and students to keep up the painting production. Meanwhile, he 
spent more and more time pondering how things were put together and how they 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
One result was a stream of inventions, from a helicopter designed like an 
aerial screw to a military tank that resembles a metal cape or a primitive 
spaceship. "Leonardo," an exhibit at the Fullerton Museum Center through Jan. 
20, organized by the Assn. of Science and Technology Centers of Washington, 
offers 27 three-dimensional models of some of these startlingly prescient 
inventions. Based on Leonardo's drawings, these modern-day constructions were 
loaned by International Business Machines Corp. Reproductions of some of the 
drawings are also on view. 
</P>
<P>
Leonardo sketched on loose sheets of paper and tiny pads he kept in his belt. 
Later, he would organize these notations by theme and append them to a series 
of notebooks on architecture, mechanics, the human body and the theory of art. 
</P>
<P>
The artist's tiny, crabbed notations in "mirror writing" (readable only when 
held up to a mirror) filled thousands of pages. His quixotic master plan was to 
draw all the objects in the visible world, fully revealing their complexity and 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that his notebook on principles of mechanics is less important 
for its description of specific machines than for its investigation of their 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Equally significant was Leonardo's method of diagramming the machines and 
subordinating explanatory text to the drawing itself. Just as his anatomical 
illustrations laid the groundwork for modern medical illustration, his machine 
illustrations set new standards in precision and comprehension. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the inventions are intriguing in a back-to-the-future way and designed 
with the sense of balance and proportion one might expect from a master artist. 
</P>
<P>
Other Leonardo brainstorms in the show include: a hydraulic screw (operated by 
the movement and force of liquid); a gear-driven contraption resembling an 
automobile jack; an elegant spindle-shaped ship's hull; a rotating bridge; a 
pile driver; a scaling ladder (designed for enemy fortresses); an odometer, and 
forerunners of the anemometer (used to measure wind pressure) and the 
hygrometer, a gauge for humidity. 
</P>
<P>
Leonardo also gets credit for a printing press. True, German printer Johann 
Gutenberg invented the movable type press about 1448, when Leonardo was still a 
twinkle in his mother's eye. But the artist seems to have been the first to 
come up with a major improvement: His version can be operated by just one 
person instead of the team required for the original press. 
</P>
<P>
An invention of the master's that even a non-mechanical mind can grasp and hail 
is a double-tiered bridge, with the lower gangway for vehicles and the upper 
for pedestrians. Leave it to Leonardo to realize that the traffic problem would 
always be with us. 
</P>
<P>
The museum center is also showing "Stolen Smiles: Mona Lisa Kitsch." This 
motley collection of objects (cards, ashtrays, clothing and more!) from the 
collection of Robert Miller and Debra Winters demonstrates how the famous 
painting has been used and abused in our time as a tool of Madison Avenue.

SCHOOL DISTRICTS SUE HONIG FOR FUNDING PARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY MARCANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charging that the state has failed to comply with a state Supreme Court 
decision requiring equal funding to schools, the Capistrano Unified School 
District and eight other districts on Wednesday sued state schools chief Bill 
Honig in an effort to balance funding statewide. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in Orange County Superior Court, charges that the state has 
failed to live up to the 1974 Serrano vs. Priest decision, which held that wide 
funding gaps between school districts was unconstitutional. The decision was 
upheld by the state Supreme Court in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, which charges that the state's formula treats children "in an 
invidious and irrational manner," will be handled by John McDermott, a Los 
Angeles attorney who also handled the first Serrano-Priest case through its 
state Supreme Court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the Capistrano district's headquarters, McDermott said 
some school districts around the state receive up to $1,000 more per student 
than other districts in the same county. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit seeks a ruling that the state's school finance system is 
unconstitutional and a directive to the Legislature "to devise a constitutional 
system of finance" within one year, with periodic progress reports from Honig. 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Cerra, a spokeswoman for the Capistrano district, said the state 
superintendent of public instruction is named defendant in the suit because "he 
is responsible for distribution of (education) funds" in the state. Honig could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Symkowick, general counsel for the state Department of Education, said 
that a similar challenge was struck down in Los Angeles Superior Court in 1983. 
The state Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal in September, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"We're under the same school financing system as we've been under essentially 
for more than 10 years now," Symkowick said. "That system has undergone an 
extensive review . . . . (in the Los Angeles case) the appellate court upheld 
the lower the court finding that the financing system met the test of the equal 
protection clause of the (state) Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
McDermott said that while the Legislature has made "significant strides" in 
bringing the state into compliance with Serrano-Priest, it has failed to fully 
comply with the 1974 ruling of Judge Bernard S. Jefferson, who ordered funding 
disparities between school districts to be reduced to less than $100 per pupil 
by 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson's ruling "was supposed to get the job done, and here we are in 1990 
and the job still isn't done," McDermott said. "There is no mechanism currently 
in place in state law to get rid of those inequalities." 
</P>
<P>
The inequalities can be traced to Proposition 13, McDermott said. According to 
the lawsuit, "before Proposition 13, high-spending districts received a much 
greater portion of their revenue from local property taxes than did 
low-spending districts. Thus, rich districts would have had their budgets 
reduced substantially, far more so than poor districts" after Proposition 13 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
To offset those lost property tax revenues, the Legislature authorized bailout 
funds, or systematic increases based on student attendance. The problem, the 
suit charges, was that instead of equalizing funding, the Legislature simply 
provided school districts with up to 91% of what they had been getting from 
taxes before Proposition 13, thus leaving the disparities between so-called 
"low-wealth" districts and wealthy districts intact. 
</P>
<P>
"By substituting funds for lost property-tax revenue, the Legislature 
re-enacted and re-created the same spending disparities that existed before 
Proposition 13," the lawsuit says. The result, McDermott said, is that a 
district with high property values can get hundreds -- or perhaps thousands -- 
of dollars per student more than a district right next door. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Capistrano Unified received $2,832 per student in fiscal 1990, 
compared with $3,113 per pupil in the neighboring Newport-Mesa Unified School 
District. But McDermott said that because the upscale Newport Beach/Costa Mesa 
area receives so much money from property taxes, it has more money to spend on 
schools -- in fact spending $966 more per student than in Capistrano Unified. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just no reason why the state gives out $3,000 to one school district 
and $2,000 to another," McDermott said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the Legislature had been moving toward closing the gap by giving 
larger cost-of-living adjustments to poorer districts than to richer ones, but 
slowed its efforts after the 1983 Los Angeles case. The Superior Court ruled 
then that the state was largely in compliance with Serrano-Priest if gaps 
between districts were not more than $260 per pupil, or the $100 per pupil 
mandated in the original Serrano-Priest decision adjusted for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
But McDermott argued that the $100 per pupil was meant to apply in current 
dollars in any year, and even if the $260-per-pupil level is upheld, the 
disparities often are even greater. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Capistrano, the districts named as plaintiffs are the Magnolia 
Elementary District in Orange County; New Haven Unified, Alameda County; Delano 
Union Elementary, Kern County; Lucia Mar Unified, San Luis Obispo County; 
Laguna Salada Union Elementary, San Mateo County; Oak Grove Elementary, Santa 
Clara County, and Barstow Unified and Redlands Unified, both of San Bernardino 
County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SCHOOL DISTRICTS' REVENUE PER STUDENT 
</P>
<P>
State revenue per student, from lowest to highest, for Orange County unified 
districts with average daily attendance over 1,500.

EULOGY TO AN ENGAGED COMPOSER

Luigi Nono, who died in May, was one of the most prominent and socially engaged 
composers of the Italian postwar avant-garde scene. Yet when it came time to 
grieve, Nono turned to the simple sounds he heard around him -- the church 
bells of his native Venice -- when he composed ". . . sofferte onde serene . . 
. " for piano and tape in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The work will be played at 8 tonight as part of a program by the Southwest 
Chamber Music Society at Chapman College in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"The title means 'Sorrowful Yet Serene Waves,' " said Jeff von der Schmidt, 
artistic director of the music society. "The piece was composed amid a series 
of deaths in both his family and his wife's family. It became a funeral piece, 
even back in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"The piece is a description of the various bells ringing in different ways 
throughout the city of Venice -- bells coming from different sounds and 
different registers, sometimes very high and sometimes very low. The effect of 
the piece is of one large bell." 
</P>
<P>
The work, which lasts about 15 minutes, was commissioned by pianist Maurizio 
Pollini and dedicated to Pollini and his wife, Marilisa Pollini. 
</P>
<P>
The taped part "elaborates and enlarges" the live piano part, and "the two 
parts are not in opposition, nor are they in counterpoint," von der Schmidt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Cheng will be the live pianist in the program today. "She will be 
playing with Pollini," said von der Schmidt. "He is the taped pianist. It's not 
as if a computer made the sound." 
</P>
<P>
Von der Schmidt described the work as "a very virtuosic piece." 
</P>
<P>
"It's notated on four staves -- sometimes two fingers on one stave and two 
fingers on another," he said. "That's very difficult. For rhythmic clarity, 
it's notated that way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very slow piece. The dynamic range is pretty subdued. From time to 
time, there comes the clanging of the bells, but basically they're in the 
distance. It's very haunting. 
</P>
<P>
"The texture sometimes is very dense. If you hit a lot of bells at once, you 
get a lot of clanging at once. That's where the electronic part keeps the 
ringing going. 
</P>
<P>
"The piano is well-suited to this because a string once struck will vibrate 
until the damper falls on it. He uses both of those sounds against each other 
as if the piano has been turned into the city of Venice." 
</P>
<P>
A member of the Italian Resistance during World War II, Nono envisioned music 
from the point of view of an "engaged" or politically committed artist. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his works reflect his political beliefs. (He joined the Italian 
Communist party and was elected to the Central Committee in 1975.) 
</P>
<P>
For instance, his 1955 work, "Il Canto Sospeso" (the Suspended Chant), sets 
excerpts from the last letters written by European Resistance fighters before 
their execution. His 1960 opera "Intolleranza" (revised a decade later as 
"Intolleranza 1970") is an attack on capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
"The aesthetic of Nono comes from the 12-tone works of Schoenberg," von der 
Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Nono married Schoenberg's daughter, Nuria, in 1955. (She has recently 
moved to Los Angeles to be with her brother and sister-in-law, according to von 
der Schmidt, but is not likely to be at the concert in Orange.) 
</P>
<P>
"Nono developed his thinking through the serial thinking of the '60s, and as 
every composer of the period did, relaxed his tensions and became an extremely 
vibrant political composer. He was a member of the Italian Communist Party and 
was viscously opposed to American involvement in Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
Von der Schmidt has programmed the work as "a fitting tribute" to Nono, who 
died May 5 at the age of 66. 
</P>
<P>
Framing the Nono piece will be two works by Beethoven -- the Sonata for Cello, 
Opus 102, and the Piano Trio, Opus 70, No. 1, the "Ghost." 
</P>
<P>
"We think that Beethoven's aesthetic (in the Cello Sonata), with its first big 
fugue, the first fugue of the late period, is the best preparation for the type 
of concentration needed to listen to Nono," von der Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the 'Ghost' Trio: Of all the trios to do, we thought it might be nice to 
have the 'Ghost' show up. Any musician is saddened by the passing of a musician 
of the stature of Nono. They don't make a lot of them like that. They're not a 
dime-a-dozen people. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first Nono we've ever played, but it won't be the last," von der 
Schmidt added. "The music is wrapped up, as with any Italian composer, with 
something dramatic, which makes it very accessible. All you need to do with 
this work is imagine bells going off in Venice. You'll have quite a good time."

SPECIAL EVENTS; 
</P>
<P>
A TEN-YEAR PRODUCTION TO MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

One of the truly delightful things about "The Glory of Christmas" is that it 
shares a kinship with one of the most endearing Christian holiday traditions: 
the Sunday school Christmas pageant. For many, the annual event brings back 
warm memories of the times they acted in church Nativity scenes as angels or 
wise men. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning its tenth season Friday at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, 
"Glory" will once again tap those memories with a $2-million production 
complete with live animals, high-tech special effects, flying angels and 
original music and choreography. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a beautiful, overwhelming production and there's nothing like it," Jeanne 
Dunn, "Glory" public relations director, said recently. "It gives Christians 
and non-Christians alike a chance to see a beautiful reminder of what Christmas 
is about, in a way that no one else can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Dunn has participated in "The Glory of Christmas" since 1981 and has seen the 
show evolve from its original concept as a West Coast counterpart to Radio City 
Music Hall's annual "Christmas Spectacular" to a fully scripted, original 
musical re-creation of the Nativity story. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dunn, the original "Glory" (produced by Robert Jani) did not deal 
primarily with the Nativity, but placed greater emphasis on the history behind 
the holiday, using live action, narration and multimedia. 
</P>
<P>
The show offered a narrative look at Christmas through the centuries, with 
colorful processions of costumed volunteers and live animals and images of the 
Madonna and child projected across a giant medieval backdrop. There was no live 
dialogue or singing. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982 Dunn's husband, Paul, joined the "Glory" staff to help in revising the 
show's script. Paul Dunn had been working on the debut script of "The Glory of 
Easter," and the Rev. Robert H. Schuller, founder of the Crystal Cathedral, was 
so impressed with the writer's attention to historical and geographical detail 
that he invited him to join the Christmas production. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn completely rewrote the "Glory" script in 1985 drawing heavily from his 
experience as a graduate student of geography and archeology in the Holy Land. 
The new script gave the show a larger sense of authenticity as bits and pieces 
of geographic and historic fact were incorporated into dialogue and sets. 
</P>
<P>
By 1986, Dunn was appointed director of production and through his guidance and 
the help of more than 400 volunteers and performers, "Glory" has evolved into 
its present form. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more noticeable changes Paul Dunn brought to the "The Glory of 
Christmas" was the addition of up to 13 flying angels who flutter in and out of 
scenes on an ingenious harness and cable apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
The special effect has been successfully performed thousands of times over the 
last nine years, but Dorrie Lee Mattson, the first person ever to don the 
angels wings and "Glory's" resident choreographer, has seen more than her share 
of embarrassing moments and surprises during those in-house flights. 
</P>
<P>
"Several times the angels have floated so low over the audience that their 
skirts have brushed the tops of people's heads and it's given them quite a 
start," Mattson explained recently. "I remember one time my skirt knocked this 
guy in the head and he really came out of his seat . . . as if he'd been 
touched by an angel or something!" 
</P>
<P>
In another instance, an angel lost her balance and did a complete somersault in 
midair. "In those circumstances we just tell the angels to continue with their 
choreographed movements and just hope for the best," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bigger dangers, however, await the performers who work the stage. With a 
mini-zoo consisting of three camels, four horses, 20 sheep and goats, a donkey, 
a cow and an ox, the stage gets slippery at times. 
</P>
<P>
"One time one of our male dancers was supposed to catch his partner after doing 
a move called a helicopter lift. But right as he made his move to catch her, he 
slipped in some manure and went skidding out of control. He did manage to catch 
her and, as it turned out, it really looked quite spectacular," Mattson said, 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Debby Smith, who has played Mary nine times and will again this year, 
can tell similar horror stories. 
</P>
<P>
"One year our donkey happened to be pregnant throughout the season and she was 
really temperamental and moody. At times she would just freeze and refuse to 
move. I was doing a scene riding with her, and as we were walking along she 
froze up and totally pooped all over the ramp," Smith recalls. "In a later 
scene we were supposed to cross back over the same spot and as hard as I tried 
to steer him away from the spot, Joseph (Robin Buck) still managed to step 
right in it. He was wearing sandals and he had this stuff going between his 
toes and every place. It was awful." 
</P>
<P>
An attempt in 1988 to use a real baby in the manger scenes yielded a less 
messy, but no less funny, result. According to Smith, the baby was in no mood 
to play the role of the Messiah -- or anyone else for that matter -- and as the 
evening wore on he got more and more fussy. 
</P>
<P>
"During the second half of the show I was supposed to sing this really tender 
lullaby to the baby. You know, 'sleep holy child, so meek and mild' kind of 
stuff. But at that very moment the baby just starts screaming at the top of his 
lungs. Joseph ended up having to take him off stage during the middle of the 
scene and come back out with the doll that we normally use." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of such pratfalls, "The Glory of Christmas" managed to get through the 
lean years between 1980-83 and, according to Jeanne Dunn, the production began 
to turn a profit by its fourth season. Today it's a self-supporting project 
with an average yearly budget of more than $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn estimates that since 1981, well over a million people have seen the show 
and that since 1983 yearly attendance levels have stayed at around 170,000 per 
season. According to Dunn, all profits are reinvested back into the production 
or go toward funding "The Glory of Easter," which generally doesn't do as well 
at the box office because it has less appeal for non-Christians. 
</P>
<P>
"The church considers this a ministry, so all the returns are put back into the 
productions," she explained. "The main purpose, though, is to give people a 
chance to go back 2,000 years and experience the wonder, glory and beauty of 
the birth of Jesus Christ.

The United States on Wednesday warned Americans not to travel to strife-torn 
Bangladesh and said the imposition of a state of emergency will not solve the 
South Asian country's problems. 
</P>
<P>
President Hussain Mohammed Ershad said in a radio and television broadcast 
Tuesday night that he had ordered the emergency, which curbs all civil rights, 
to fight violence ignited by an opposition campaign to force him from power. 
</P>
<P>
Ershad said he is banning all political activities, political meetings, 
processions, strikes and industrial lockouts indefinitely. Civil rights will be 
suspended and the press will be censored. 
</P>
<P>
At least 10 people have been killed and more than 1,000 injured since Oct. 10, 
when the opposition renewed its campaign to force Ershad to quit and hand over 
rpower to an interim government before free elections.

INJURED GIRL DENIES SHE ASKED FRIEND TO LIE ABOUT FIGHT

Testifying in court for the first time since her face was slashed in a brawl 
last August, Amber Jefferson on Wednesday angrily denied that she told a friend 
he could make $1,000 if he told police the attack was racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony that saw her fight to control her emotions, Amber disputed 
testimony given earlier by 17-year-old Matt Stewart, who was with the 
15-year-old Garden Grove girl at a Stanton apartment complex on Aug. 6 -- the 
night she was cut by a shard of glass during a fight between two groups of 
young people. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart had testified Tuesday that Amber had told him he would receive $1,000 
if he claimed the attack was racially inspired. 
</P>
<P>
But in court Wednesday, Amber offered a different picture of what happened. She 
said it was Stewart who brought up the idea of filing a lawsuit during a 
conversation with her mother at the Jefferson home shortly after the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Matt said, 'I got beat up pretty bad, is it possible that I could sue?' " 
Amber said. "My mother said, 'I don't think so.' " 
</P>
<P>
Amber said there were no further conversations between Stewart and any members 
of her family about the possibility of pursuing a lawsuit and that they never 
offered him $1,000 to lie on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even know where he came up with $1,000," Amber testified. "To tell you 
the truth, if I had $1,000, I would be out shopping; I wouldn't give it to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Amber's testimony came in the third day of a preliminary hearing for Kurt David 
Wimberly, 18, who is charged with mayhem for allegedly throwing the glass that 
slashed the left side of her face from her temple to her neck. 
</P>
<P>
Clad in an orange jail jumpsuit and flanked by his attorneys, Wimblerly stared 
intently at Amber during her testimony. She is scheduled to take the stand 
again today. 
</P>
<P>
Amber and her parents -- her mother is white and her father is black -- have 
alleged that the attack was racially motivated. The incident became a rallying 
point for civil rights activists who maintained that it was proof that racism 
is prevalent in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
However, while bringing charges against several people involved in the fight, 
the district attorney's office declined to file hate-crime charges in the case, 
saying the brawl stemmed from a dispute between two girls over Wimberly and was 
not motivated by racial hatred. 
</P>
<P>
Yet on Wednesday, Amber maintained that the attack was racial. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's because of my color," she said when Assistant Dist. Atty. Kathi 
Harper asked her if she knew what had caused the incident that left her face 
disfigured. 
</P>
<P>
Facing television cameras and a packed courtroom, Amber broke down in tears 
several times during her testimony as she recounted the events that led to the 
near-fatal injury that left her hospitalized with a deep gash down her face and 
a broken jaw. 
</P>
<P>
In graphic detail, she described the cut that caused paralysis on one side of 
her face along with a reddish-colored scar. 
</P>
<P>
"I had 10 1/2 hours of surgery. They had to sew each nerve and each gland and 
the muscle back together again," she said. "My mouth was wired shut and they 
had to put metal bars in my face to keep the bones in place." 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning from Harper, the former Santiago High School cheerleader told 
the court that her life has changed dramatically since the attack. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets me really sick when I have muscle spasms," she said. "I throw up a 
lot. It came to the point where I can't even cheer because if I jump up and 
down I get a headache, so I just decided to avoid all that and quit 
cheerleading." 
</P>
<P>
Amber said that she has difficulty remembering the details of the attack itself 
and that she never saw who threw the object that wounded her. 
</P>
<P>
The night she was hurt, she said, she was with four other teen-agers whom she 
had known for a couple of days. They had piled into Stewart's car and gone to 
the Disneyland Hotel for about an hour, then gone to another hotel for a party 
that never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
There, she said, she drank about six ounces of vodka and orange juice that 
someone had mixed together in an orange juice container. After a short while, 
she said, the group headed back to the Stanton apartment complex where Amber 
was spending the weekend with another friend. 
</P>
<P>
Amber said she and some of her friends got out of the car near the Wimberlys' 
house to walk back to her friend's apartment when they came upon a group of 
people, some of whom were armed with bats. 
</P>
<P>
"I got hit in the back of the legs," she said. "I fell to the ground, and when 
I turned my head around, that's when I saw Kurt directly behind me with a bat." 
</P>
<P>
Amber said Stewart carried her back to his car and sat her down in the 
passenger seat, closed the door, then walked around the back of the car to get 
in on the driver's side. A few seconds later, she said, she saw a bat raised 
above Stewart and he said he had been hit. 
</P>
<P>
"I got out of the car to get away. I was trying to get away as fast as I could, 
but my legs were hurting," she said. "I saw something very shiny in Kurt's 
hand. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It was moments later that Amber apparently was hit with the glass shard. Amber 
said she heard one of her friends, Lewis Jones, 19, yelling, "You killed my 
home girl." 
</P>
<P>
Amber said her next memories are of being in the hospital. "All I knew was my 
face was very, very swollen and it was bandaged," she said. "I didn't know it 
was all sewn up until one day when I looked in the mirror."

HEALTH: CASES ARE RUNNING FAR AHEAD OF LAST YEAR'S COUNTY TOTAL. IT CAN CAUSE 
BIRTH DEFECTS IF CONTRACTED DURING PREGNANCY.

An epidemic of rubella -- a mild respiratory illness that can cause birth 
defects if contracted during pregnancy -- has swept Orange County and the state 
this year, and the disease is taking its toll on babies, public health 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, an Orange County baby was born with cataracts after his 
mother contracted rubella during pregnancy, and Los Angeles health officials 
suspect eight babies born there since June have rubella-related birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
The incidence of rubella in Orange County and statewide appears finally to be 
waning, with just six cases reported in all of California in September. But 
public health officials said this was probably a seasonal drop and cases may 
rise again in January. 
</P>
<P>
California health officials have reported 521 cases between Jan. 1 and Oct. 31, 
compared with 160 in all of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Orange County's cases are running more than "five times ahead of last 
year's," said Dr. Hildy Meyers, epidemiologist for the Orange County Health 
Care Agency. Through September, doctors here reported 73 rubella cases compared 
with only 11 last year. 
</P>
<P>
The outbreak has been worst in Stanislaus County, Southern California, the San 
Francisco Bay Area and the Central Valley, said Dr. Loring Dales, chief of the 
immunization unit at the California Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
In these areas, local health officials have battled seven rubella outbreaks in 
jails or prisons, he noted. In April, 28 Orange County jail inmates contracted 
rubella. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned about the epidemic, Dales in October issued a statewide alert to 
pediatricians, asking them to watch for "congenital rubella syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
"We had this upsurge" of rubella cases, particularly from March to June, Dales 
said. "We expect rubella babies in early October." 
</P>
<P>
For children and adults, rubella -- also known as German measles -- is usually 
a mild disease, characterized by painful lymph nodes, a rash that lasts one to 
three days, joint pains and unusual sensitivity to light. 
</P>
<P>
But mothers who contract the disease during pregnancy pass it on to their 
fetuses. The outcome, especially when the mother contracts rubella during the 
first five months of pregnancy, can be grim. Babies may be born with cataracts, 
glaucoma, mental retardation, deafness, heart defects and a high incidence of 
diabetes -- and in some cases, the babies may not survive. 
</P>
<P>
It could be easy to miss the fact that a child with a birth defect was exposed 
to rubella in the womb, Dales noted. 
</P>
<P>
"If a child is born with a moderate hearing loss, you might never think back, 
'Oh, boy, this is from the rash I had in pregnancy,' " Dales said. 
</P>
<P>
Dales also warned that babies born with congenital rubella syndrome "keep 
shedding the virus up to a year, a year and half," so pediatricians need to 
watch for these children and make sure they do not infect others. 
</P>
<P>
State and local health officials say they do not know the cause of this year's 
outbreak. Unlike the statewide measles epidemic, which has hit Latino families 
hard, this outbreak appears to affect nearly all ethnic groups equally, Dales 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted one exception -- fewer cases involve blacks. But he added, "the darker 
your skin, a mild infection, a mild rash is hard to track." 
</P>
<P>
About 70% of the cases involve adults between the age of 20 and 40, and the 
rest are preschoolers, Dales said. 
</P>
<P>
While state health officials are concerned about the rubella outbreak, it still 
pales when compared to the continuing statewide measles epidemic -- a 
longer-lasting, more severe infection that can cause brain damage and death. So 
far, California's measles epidemic has resulted in 12,000 measles cases and 55 
deaths, two in Orange County, Dales said. 
</P>
<P>
RUBELLA EPIDEMIC 
</P>
<P>
California is in the midst of an epidemic of rubella, also known as German 
measles. If contracted during pregnancy, the disease can cause numerous birth 
defects, including mental retardation, diabetes and deafness. The epidemic 
appears to be waning, however. The number of cases reported each month has 
steadily dropped since June.

At 10 years old, Reyna Roa had her first physical examination from a doctor on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Reyna, a fifth-grader at Grant Elementary School, watched carefully as a nurse 
pricked her finger to draw a blood sample. Then she waited patiently with other 
children in the school's music room until a doctor with a stethoscope asked 
each one to breathe deeply, open their mouths and say "ah." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the children cried. Others looked nervous and hesitant about what was 
to come, because, like Reyna, many of the students at the Walnut Street school 
had never been to a doctor before. But Reyna remained unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't afraid because I have seen this on television," said Reyna, who wore 
a hot pink vest and white jeans ensemble. "Except for the chickenpox, I have 
never been sick enough to go to a doctor's, though my mother has." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of being intimidated by the experience, Reyna said after her 
examination that she wants to be a doctor when she grows up. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40 first- and fifth-graders at the Santa Ana school participated in 
the pilot health-screening program to pinpoint basic health problems of 
elementary students in the predominantly low-income area. 
</P>
<P>
District officials estimate that many families in the school's area have no 
insurance and that 80% of the children have never been seen by a physician. 
</P>
<P>
"A sick child isn't going to perform his or her best," said Lucinda Hundley, 
Santa Ana Unified's director of special education and health services. "And 
many times we are not even aware that a child has any particular thing wrong 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics raised more 
than $36,000 to launch the pilot program in conjunction with the Santa Ana 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are striving for is that by starting with these kids at an early age 
we can introduce them and possibly their families to the world of medicine and 
prevent many health conditions from turning into something much more serious," 
said David Lang, pediatrician and chief of infectious diseases at Children's 
Hospital of Orange. Lang said that first-graders were targeted because they had 
just entered the school system and possibly had not had a previous physical 
examination, while fifth-graders were chosen because they are about to enter 
the adolescent stage. 
</P>
<P>
School nurses, volunteer nurses from Children's Hospital of Orange County 
(CHOC) and three pediatricians conducted the 15-minute routine checkups. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors also tested for tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
"We still see a significant amount of TB cases today," said Dr. Paul Qaqundah, 
a Huntington Beach pediatrician. "A few years back there were a number of cases 
in this area so we are very interested in seeing exactly what the results of 
those tests will be."

THEATER-RESTAURANT COMPLEX ADVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID F. BURKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Planning Commission has approved construction of an eight-screen movie 
theater and two restaurants on Beach Boulevard south of Imperial Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Also included in the plan are several retail stores, bringing the total 
development to nearly 140,000 square feet, said John C. Penz of Hughes 
Investments, which is working with Chevron Land Development Co. on the project. 
</P>
<P>
One restaurant will be of the "sit-down" variety, and the other will be a 
3,500-square-foot drive-through restaurant, Penz said. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Joseph Abbate, whose property is opposite the proposed theater, spoke 
against the development. The Coyote Creek flood channel lies between the 
proposed development and Abbate's back yard, Penz said. Abbate's home rests on 
land that is about 30 feet higher than the Chevron property and 160 feet from 
the proposed theater building. 
</P>
<P>
Penz agreed with Abbate's complaint that the roof of the theater would be at 
ground level for the homeowners, but he told the Planning Commission that the 
company intends to build a quality development. Residents will have 10 days to 
appeal the commission's decision. 
</P>
<P>
The development is a scaled-down version of one approved by the commission last 
year, Penz said. The new plan calls for one-third less square footage than the 
one approved in January, 1989. DAVID F. BURKE

O.C. BEACHES VETO PER-PERSON CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a recent recommendation by the state Department of Parks and Recreation 
that state beaches levy a per-person entrance fee, all seven Orange County 
state beaches will avoid such a charge now. 
</P>
<P>
David Pryor, lifeguard supervisor for the Orange Coast District, said it would 
be difficult to collect a fee because many people walk or ride bikes onto the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
Also, many beaches already have parking fees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Coast District operates Bolsa Chica State Beach, Huntington State 
Beach and Crystal Cove State Park. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach, which operates Corona del Mar State Beach, and the Pendleton 
District, which runs San Clemente, San Onofre and Doheny state beaches, also 
said that they will not charge visitors the $2 fee. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Drake, an aquatic specialist with the state Parks and Recreation 
Department in San Francisco, said the Santa Monica Mountains District, which 
operates a number of state beaches in northern Los Angeles, is the only beach 
district in Southern California to implement the new charges so far. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's really happy about it. We would rather not charge at all," Drake 
said. "But this is the real world." 
</P>
<P>
The state Legislature and governor had asked the Parks Department to raise 
about $16 million. In response, the department revamped its fee schedule, 
upping the charge for camping and parking by about 20% and authorizing the 
per-person charges. LAURA MICHAELIS

NEW LAW TARGETS PUBLIC DRINKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has passed an ordinance prohibiting drinking alcohol in 
public, augmenting a state law that has been difficult to enforce, police say. 
</P>
<P>
The new law will be a law-enforcement tool to deter groups from drinking in 
parking lots and near apartment houses by allowing police to arrest such 
people, even if they're not drunk. 
</P>
<P>
Police Capt. John Savage said the state law applies only to those who are 
drunk, "and oftentimes that's too late." 
</P>
<P>
"They're out of control by that time," he said. "You have fights, sometimes 
with severe injuries. It will give us a tool to help us move in before we have 
serious disturbance." 
</P>
<P>
Violation of the ordinance, which goes into effect in December, is a 
misdemeanor.

<P>
County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez presented an $8,500 grant to the North 
Orange County YMCA on Wednesday to help subsidize its child-care center. 
</P>
<P>
Money from the grant will be used to help pay the five day-care attendants who 
work at the center at 1414 S. Brookhurst St. The center provides care for about 
25 children in before- and after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Kaiser, senior program director for North County YMCA, said the grant was 
very much needed. Kaiser said the center primarily serves children from 
single-family homes where money is tight and the mother works.

ARSON BLAZE IN CARBON CANYON PARK CONTROLLED 
</P>

<P>
More than 100 firefighters battled an arson blaze Wednesday that charred 50 
acres of brush in Carbon Canyon Regional Park and threatened a mobile home park 
before being contained. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the fire was started in the afternoon and spread quickly in the 
bone-dry brush. By 9 p.m., however, the fire was 80% contained and firefighters 
expected to have it totally contained in the early morning. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze did not damage any structures or cause injuries, Orange County Fire 
Department Capt. Dan Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at arson," said Mike McCann, Orange County's chief arson 
investigator. "We found a device and other information that would lead us to 
believe that a person using the park caused the fire." 
</P>
<P>
McCann declined to elaborate on the nature of the device. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking to the public for any information about anyone seen walking 
along the horse trails at the (northeast) end of the park at about 5 p.m," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire crews from Orange and Los Angeles counties worked quickly to encircle the 
blaze, which was pushed in a southwest direction toward Carbon Canyon Dam by 
wind gusts up to 25 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, firefighters had to battle chilly temperatures, which dipped to 
the middle and low 40s. "The cold makes it very difficult," Young said. "It's 
very miserable out there on the fire lines." 
</P>
<P>
Firefighting efforts were concentrated north of a mobile home park at Blake 
Tree Drive near the intersection of Rose Drive and Imperial Highway, Young 
said. Back fires were effectively set to neutralize the blaze as it approached 
the structures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A neighborhood of houses with wood-shingle roofs was also a source of some 
concern for fire officials, who sent two strike-force teams into the area to 
prevent wind-blown embers from igniting the homes. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities closed Imperial Highway from Valencia Avenue to Rose Drive to all 
but residential traffic while the fire burned. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fire was contained, Young said that it may be a harbinger of the 
dangers ahead in the winter months. 
</P>
<P>
"Fire season isn't over," he warned. "Building a big fire in your fireplace is 
an excellent way to ignite your roof and your neighbor's roof and the whole 
block." 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials warned that weather conditions today will cause a "red flag" 
warning as temperatures are expected to rise into the mid-80s and humidity 
levels drop to below 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information about the Carbon Canyon fire is requested to call the 
Orange County Fire Department at (714) 744-0455.

malfunctioning mesquite-burning barbecue grill, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were called to the restaurant at 3333 W. Coast Highway about 4:30 
p.m. after a vent to the grill closed and smoke clouded the dining area.

GIONIS PROSECUTOR CITES PHONE RECORDS; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: JURORS HEAR THE OPENING STATEMENT IN THE PHYSICIAN'S TRIAL IN THE 1988 
ASSAULT AGAINST HIS FORMER WIFE, AISSA WAYNE, AND HER BOYFRIEND AT THE TIME.

Standing in front of two long lists of telephone records, a prosecutor 
Wednesday told jurors the documents will help show that it was Dr. Thomas A. 
Gionis who put out the order that resulted in two "lugheads" beating up the 
doctor's ex-wife, Aissa Wayne, and her then-boyfriend two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis had put out the word to a private investigator, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Christopher J. Evans said, that he wanted "to teach his wife a lesson." 
</P>
<P>
Gionis, 37, and Wayne, 34, whose father was John Wayne, were involved in a 
bitter custody battle over their 2-year-old daughter when the attack occurred 
on Oct. 3, 1988, at the Newport Beach estate of Roger W. Luby. Wayne's face was 
smashed into a concrete garage floor several times by one of two assailants, 
who also used a knife to cut Luby's Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis is charged with assault with a deadly weapon and false imprisonment in 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Opening arguments were held Wednesday before Superior Court Judge Theodore E. 
Millard after the three-day selection of jurors and two alternates was 
completed. Evans' opening statements were heard Wednesday, but Gionis' 
attorneys will not lay out their case until next Tuesday. The judge explained 
that he had a conflict with another case until then. 
</P>
<P>
After court Wednesday, Gionis rushed to the end of the 11th floor courthouse 
corridor and hugged his daughter, now 4 years old, who was waiting for him 
there with family and friends. Wayne has custody of the girl, but Gionis has 
court-reviewed visitation rights. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis, a successful orthopedic surgeon who is free on bail, beamed at the 
little girl and held her in his arms as he waited for the elevator. He said 
only that his case was going well so far and that reporters should "listen to 
the evidence. Pay close attention." 
</P>
<P>
Evans reviewed for jurors a chart of nearly 40 telephone calls that took place 
among the four alleged co-conspirators in the case -- Gionis, private 
investigator O. Dan Gal of Century City, and the two assailants, Jerrel 
Hintergardt of Burbank and Jeffrey K. Bouey of Simi Valley -- before and after 
the assault. 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt, 39, who admitted that he used a knife on Luby but denied smashing 
Wayne's face into the concrete, is already serving an eight-year prison 
sentence following his conviction at a separate trial. 
</P>
<P>
Bouey, 38, who also admitted his role, is expected to plea-bargain in exchange 
for his testimony against Hintergardt and Gionis. Gal, 34, has also agreed to 
cooperate with the authorities, but he is awaiting trial and his status as a 
witness in the case remains unclear. He was not called by prosecutors to 
testify against Hintergardt. 
</P>
<P>
Gal had been hired by Gionis several months before the assault to "spy" on 
Wayne, who had temporary custody while a permanent custody hearing was pending, 
prosecutor Evans told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
"The defendant (Gionis) was trying to get custody of his little daughter. That 
was his goal," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
Evans noted that several calls took place between Gal's car phone and Gionis' 
Pomona residence and his car phone about 10 a.m. the day of the attack, shortly 
before the two assailants followed Wayne and Luby, 54, to a fitness center. It 
was after they returned that the two assailants slipped onto the Luby grounds 
when he used a remote control to open the gate and park his car in the garage. 
Evans referred to the two assailants at various times as "lugheads," "thugs" 
and "dummies." 
</P>
<P>
More calls took place between Gal and Gionis immediately after the attack, the 
prosecutor told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis' attorney John D. Barnett has countered that the telephone calls between 
Gal and Gionis do not show what prosecutors want the jurors to believe they 
show. 
</P>
<P>
While Evans repeatedly told jurors that they would hear details of the assault 
and the conspiracy from Bouey, he made no mention whether Gal would testify. He 
said only that he was not presenting all his evidence in his opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis' attorneys spent considerable time in pretrial hearings trying to 
persuade the judge to let them use evidence they believed would attack Gal's 
credibility upon cross-examination if he does testify. 
</P>
<P>
If Gal does not testify, it may be that prosecutors were unwilling to 
plea-bargain with him because of the seriousness of his role in the attack. 
Bouey was considered a secondary figure who only went along with Hintergardt, 
his best friend. Wayne and Luby have both testified that it was Hintergardt who 
led the attack.

SHELTER AIDES ARE SURPRISED BY COLD SNAP

<P>
County shelter officials, surprised by a cold snap that left many homeless 
people shivering on the streets, said Wednesday that they will consider opening 
National Guard armories to the homeless earlier next winter. 
</P>
<P>
This year's armory program is scheduled to begin Saturday and provide shelter 
to about 125 people through March 31, as weather conditions dictate. 
</P>
<P>
Shelter coordinator Dianne M. Edwards said the Dec. 1 starting date was based 
on past weather conditions and the logistics of planning for volunteers, 
transportation, security and other elements of the program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate we have had this cold blitz, but in the past three years 
we've never had a weather situation that necessitated being open before 
December," Edwards said. "I think as part of our planning process for next year 
we will see if we need to change that time frame." 
</P>
<P>
Many private shelters that operate for the homeless reported being at capacity 
because of the cold, although few reported having to turn people away. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had more people showing up than usual, and we're overbooked," said Cindy 
Ochs, director of the Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter in Costa Mesa. "We've 
also been handing out more blankets to low-income residents in the area." 
</P>
<P>
National Guard armories throughout the state were first made available to the 
homeless in 1987, to be opened when weather conditions were forecast as being 
life-threatening or when temperatures were predicted at 40 degrees or below or 
50 degrees with a 50% chance of rain. 
</P>
<P>
Despite some lows that dipped below 40 degrees, shelter officials primarily 
track conditions in Santa Ana and Fullerton, where the county's two National 
Guard armories are located, and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana recorded a low of 42, while Anaheim dipped to just 46. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards noted that under state criteria the county armories would not have been 
able to open anyway, despite colder conditions in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
One idea that may be looked at next year is to enlist churches as shelters on 
cold nights.

ANGELS ARE PURSUING RIGHETTI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Despite their vow to avoid plunging into the free agent market, the Angels 
could become serious suitors for the services of left-handed reliever Dave 
Righetti, who has spent all of his nine-plus major league seasons with the New 
York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the Angels pursue the San Jose native apparently hinges on his desire 
for a five-year contract. The Angels have said in the past they are reluctant 
to sign pitchers for more than three years, a sentiment that has also been 
expressed by the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Righetti's agent, Bill Goodstein, said Wednesday he has had "continuing" talks 
in recent weeks with Angel General Manager Mike Port and senior vice president 
Dan O'Brien, who handles the club's contract negotiations. According to 
Goodstein, the Angels' intentions are earnest. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question they have an abiding interest in Righetti for several 
reasons," Goodstein said by phone from his New York City office. "They know 
Righetti to have had an immensely successful career as a left-handed reliever, 
a position they're interested in filling, and in addition, I know the Angels 
like Righetti because of his conduct and (good) reputation off the field. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard to assess degrees of interest since you have lots of 
conversations with lots of teams. But I would say the Angels clearly have 
reasonable interest. His wife, Kandice, is from Orange County and he's from 
California. We think the Angels have a very good team and will be a contending 
team and that's a factor I know interests David." 
</P>
<P>
However, Righetti and Goodstein's desire for a long-term contract is a 
complicating factor. Goodstein said he would prefer a five-year deal but would 
settle for a "solid" four-year contract, which may still be longer than the 
Angels are willing to offer despite their pressing need for a left-handed 
closer. Righetti's 1990 salary was $1,550,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard he's looking for five years and I don't think we'd be interested in 
doing something like that," O'Brien said. But when asked if he'd change his 
mind should Righetti be willing to accept a shorter contract, O'Brien replied, 
"Anybody can make something interesting . . . The door is ajar." Asked whether 
Righetti was worth pursuing, O'Brien said, "At a very slow and well-informed 
pace." 
</P>
<P>
Righetti, who turned 32 on Wednesday, had 36 saves in 39 opportunities last 
season. His 224 career saves is the most by a left-hander and seventh on the 
all-time list. He is one of only five pitchers in major league history who have 
earned 20 saves in seven consecutive seasons, sharing that distinction with 
Bruce Sutter, Jeff Reardon, Lee Smith and Goose Gossage. He holds the Yankee 
record for games appeared in, with 522 appearances as a starter and reliever. 
</P>
<P>
It's believed the Chicago Cubs, Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox and Minnesota 
Twins have made offers to Righetti. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien also said the Angels are unlikely to acquire Steve Sax from the Yankees 
to fill their need at second base. "I think that's a dead issue because the 
Yankees are going to keep him," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Angels hired former major league outfielder Gene Richards to join the 
coaching staff of their double-A Midland farm club. Richards played eight years 
in the major leagues, seven with the San Diego Padres.

THIS TIME, CHAPMAN WOMEN NEED TEAM EFFORT AGAINST SAN BERNARDINO 
</P>

<P>
After Friday's game with Cal State San Bernardino, the Chapman College women's 
basketball team will have played half of its six games against the Coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers (4-1) will face San Bernardino for the third time in seven days in 
the first round of the Cal State Hayward tournament. Chapman won the first 
meeting last Friday at the Hutton Center, 81-62, but lost, 80-68, the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"Not a good scheduling move on my part, but I'm learning," Chapman Coach 
Lindsay Strothers said. 
</P>
<P>
The re-rematch, Strothers said, will give his team a chance to redeem itself 
after a poor performance at San Bernardino, which will join the Panthers in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. next season. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened there was we didn't play as a team," he said. "We played as 
individuals." 
</P>
<P>
Strothers said he was pleased with the Panthers' effort Tuesday in an 86-71 
victory over Biola. Community college transfer Linda Kirby scored 25 points, 
and Jackie Saunders had 19 points and 18 rebounds. Kirby is averaging 21 points 
a game, and Saunders is averaging 19 points and 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Limping Panthers: Chapman, which lists nine players on its roster, will suit up 
only eight the next three weeks. Junior guard Missy Abraham, who played only in 
the first game, will be out the next three weeks because of an undetermined 
illness. Kim Rieff, a six-foot senior reserve center who scored 19 points in 24 
minutes against Biola, is suffering from a back injury that may limit her from 
playing two days in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Chapman men's team takes to the road for the first time with games Friday 
afternoon at Hayward and Saturday night at UC Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Panther Coach Bob Boyd said he was pleased with the team's play in three 
victories at home. Chapman is off to its best start since winning its first 
five games in 1983-84. 
</P>
<P>
Added depth from transfers has allowed Boyd to give as many as nine players 
significant playing time. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you can really utilize nine people -- we used to say seven -- but I 
think the game has changed," Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Transfers Zlatko Josic (Clemson), Al Jackson (West Valley College) and Chuck 
McGavran (Cal State Northridge) have contributed, and returning starters Rog 
Middleton, Frantz Reyes and Andre Hill are averaging 20, 16 and 16 points a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The Chapman women's volleyball team was eliminated from the NCAA Division II 
playoffs Friday by West Texas State, the No. 1 team in the nation, 15-7, 15-10, 
7-15, 15-7. 
</P>
<P>
All things considered, Chapman Coach Mary Cahill was happy with the Panthers' 
performance in the match played before a crowd of 2,392 in the 2,000-capacity 
Tascosa High School gym in Amarillo. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year (in the playoffs) we went to Riverside and lost three straight and 
we played like we were nervous," Cahill said. "This year we didn't play that 
way. The match lasted about two hours and we stayed with them. They didn't just 
kill us. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great experience for the girls who are returning because that's 
probably the largest crowd they will ever play in front of." 
</P>
<P>
The only Panther player who won't return next season is setter Brooke Schakel, 
who was an all-Southwest Region selection. Returning juniors will be outside 
hitter Debi Waller, who was a second-team All-American selection by the 
volleyball coaches and an all-Southwest selection; middle-hitter Rena Strange, 
who was also all-Southwest pick; and Heather Mead, who was 10th in the nation 
in digs (419). Waller and Strange were also first-team all-CCAA selections. 
</P>
<P>
After losing its first four games, the Christ College Irvine men's basketball 
team defeated Whittier College, 69-60, Tuesday to give Coach Greg Marshall his 
first victory as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
"We were thinking it wasn't going to happen this year," Marshall said, 
jokingly. "I thought it might take a couple of years to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall took the job at Christ College after serving five years as an 
assistant at Westmont. He also was an assistant coach at Idaho State and Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles play Redlands in the first round of the Redlands Tournament at 8 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chris Briones, a catcher at Brea-Olinda High School, has signed a letter of 
intent to play for Chapman. Briones, who batted .370 with 10 doubles last 
season, was a first-team all-Orange League selection and helped the Wildcats to 
the league title. . . . The City of Orange is sponsoring a youth baseball camp, 
featuring Chapman Coach Mike Weathers, Dec. 26-29 at Hart Park. The four-day 
camp costs $99 and will include instruction from Weathers and other college 
coaches and players. For information, call Weathers at 997-6663.

MOORE STILL LETTING HIS FEET DO THE TALKING; 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER: MIDFIELDER LED MISSION VIEJO TO SOUTHERN SECTION TITLE IN 1989. NOW, 
THE REDSHIRT FRESHMAN HELPS UCLA REACH FINAL FOUR.

<P>
Joe-Max Moore, the playmaking midfielder for UCLA's soccer team, is not exactly 
a chatter box. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Moore figures he'd rather let others stick their feet in their mouths -- 
he'll just put his on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Ask him for a bit of self-evaluation, and he evades the question for fear of 
sounding conceited. But if Moore could toss his modesty aside for a minute, 
here are a few things he might want you to know: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He ranks second on the team in goals scored (11) and points (32) behind 
Billy Thompson (18 and 43). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Six of his goals have been game-winners. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He is in a three-way tie for the team lead in assists (10). 
</P>
<P>
 -- He had three assists and a goal in single games twice this year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He is first in minutes played with 2,126. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a veteran, but even more impressive when you consider that Moore is 
a 19-year-old redshirt freshman on a talented team that opens play Saturday 
against North Carolina State in a semifinal of the NCAA soccer final four at 
Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins (17-4) advanced this season as the West Regionals champion by 
defeating San Diego State, 2-1, and Southern Methodist, 2-0. Moore scored the 
winner against San Diego State in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll do well," Moore said. "We have a very good chance of winning. If 
we all come to play, we'll be hard to beat." 
</P>
<P>
Showing up has never been a problem for Moore. And becoming a standout once he 
gets there hasn't been, either. 
</P>
<P>
Moore gained recognition while at Mission Viejo High School, where he had 25 
goals and 14 assists in his senior season, 1988-89. He led the Diablos to the 
Southern Section 3-A title with a 2-1 victory over Santa Barbara, scoring the 
winning goal in overtime. He was an first-team all-section selection and The 
Times' Orange County edition player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Moore had 64 goals and 56 assists at Mission Viejo and Woodbridge, 
where he played in his freshman and sophomore years. 
</P>
<P>
Those kinds of numbers can prompt college recruiters to camp on your front 
lawn. But though UCLA Coach Sigi Schmid never went to those lengths, in Moore 
he landed one of the hottest prospects in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the kind of player who makes things happen on the field," Schmid said. 
"Technically, he's very sound. He's basically two-footed, which a lot of 
players aren't. And he's able to dribble and pass the ball well. He's able to 
control the ball and put the ball where he wants it." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to attend UCLA was fairly clear-cut for Moore. He wanted to remain 
close to home and play for an academically sound school with a successful 
Division I soccer program. He resides in an off-campus apartment with teammates 
Mike Lapper, a former Marina High School defender; Sam George, a former Mater 
Dei midfielder; and Chris Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Once at UCLA, Moore sat out his first year because the Bruins were overloaded 
at midfield and Schmid wanted him to get acclimated to the college environment. 
But Moore cracked Schmid's lineup this season as an offensive midfielder. It's 
a position he apparently can handle well at any level, though it didn't take 
long for Moore to notice the differences between high school and college 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
"Physically, there's more required (of you)," said Moore, an Oklahoma native 
who moved to Orange County in his early teens. "The tempo of the game is 
faster, there's more tackling. There's more skill involved. All the players are 
so good." 
</P>
<P>
But Moore, who at 5 feet 8, 145 pounds might seem somewhat frail for the rigors 
of a perpetual motion sport, has obviously made a smooth adjustment. He has 
heard the doubting comments about his size but dismisses them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's a factor," said Moore, who in January will participate in a 
developmental camp for players hoping to make the 1992 U.S. Olympic team. If he 
makes that team, he would like to take the next step, playing on the host U.S. 
team in the 1994 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely one of my goals as a soccer player," Moore said. "Hopefully 
(the U.S. team) can keep getting better and progressing." 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, Moore hopes UCLA can reach the NCAA championship match on 
Sunday against the winner of the game between top-ranked Evansville and 
Rutgers. The Bruins would be seeking their first national championship since 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a great season," Moore said. "Our goal was to be in the final four 
and we've made it. There's two more games. We need to go all out." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody has to encourage Moore to do that. That's how he gets his messages 
across.

Al Gasparian, women's volleyball coach at Golden West College, said at the 
start of the season that his team should be the favorite in the Orange Empire 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Rustlers rolled to a 12-0 match record, losing only one game. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he is picking his team to end the season by winning the state title. 
Golden West starts state tournament play on Friday in the eight-team final at 
Allan Hancock College in Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to win it," Gasparian said. "The key is that we have to 
play with some poise. We are still really young. We have only two sophomores." 
</P>
<P>
The sophomores are Joli Eberhart and Stacia Allen. Eberhart was the Orange 
Empire Conference player of the year and an all-Southern California pick. Allen 
was an all-conference player. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West (21-3) is the top-ranked team in Southern California but is second 
behind DeAnza (23-0) in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West opens with Sacramento City (17-0) at 8 p.m. in the first round of 
the double-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Sacramento is the only team I know nothing about," Gasparian said. 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round matches: Cabrillo (19-2) plays Cerritos (15-2) and 
Grossmont (17-4) plays College of the Sequoias (11-1) at 6 p.m.; DeAnza plays 
Pasadena City (17-2) in the other 8 p.m. match Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament's championship match is scheduled at 6 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont, the defending state champion, also won the title in 1987. Golden 
West won titles in 1979, '84 and '88. 
</P>
<P>
No team from Northern California has won a title in the state tournament, which 
started in 1977.

Raj Bhathal, an Orange County swimsuit manufacturer and real estate developer, 
has acquired majority ownership of the Orlando franchise in the new World 
League of American Football, league officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bhathal, 49, a Newport Beach resident, announced Wednesday that the team's name 
will be the Orlando Thunder. 
</P>
<P>
"NFL games played abroad have proven that people overseas enjoy the American 
style of football," said Bhathal, who emigrated in 1962 from India to the 
United States. "With Orlando's strong worldwide popularity, this will give us 
an opportunity to enhance the City of Orlando as an international city. 
</P>
<P>
"Owning a team in this league might be better than being in the NFL. I love, 
love football . . . This city was the No. 1 city in the World League's 
marketing. We feel this is an international league and Orlando is an 
international city." 
</P>
<P>
Bhathal, who founded Far Western Bank in Tustin and is a member of the 
Executive Round Table at UC Irvine, announced that Paul Bartelt, 30, owner of 
Pro Sports Management in Orange, will be a minority owner of the franchise and 
handle daily operations. Bartelt's background includes negotiating NFL player 
contracts and commercial advertising agreements. 
</P>
<P>
The league expects to have 10 franchises and begin play March 10. Unlike 
previous unsuccessful attempts by the World Football League and USFL to compete 
with the NFL, the WLAF will be governed and operated by it. The new league has 
a 21-country, $50-million television package. 
</P>
<P>
Bhathal and his wife, Marta, reside in the Big Canyon area of Newport Beach. 
They have a son who attends Corona del Mar High School and a daughter at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"Raj Bhathal brings an impeccable background of business success and community 
involvement to Orlando's World League franchise," said Mike Lynn, league 
president. "As a native of India, he also has a strong appreciation for the 
international dimension of this league and shares our vision of globalizing the 
sport of American football." 
</P>
<P>
The other U.S. franchises will be in Charlotte, N.C.; New York; Montreal; 
Sacramento; San Antonio, and Birmingham, Ala. London, Barcelona and Frankfurt, 
Germany, will be the European entries.

FORMER PARTNER OF NEIL BUSH CHEATING CREDITORS, SUIT SAYS

A court-appointed bankruptcy trustee has charged in a lawsuit that former 
Denver developer Bill Walters hid assets from creditors by transferring 
ownership of six automobiles and more than $6 million worth of real estate to 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Walters, a former business partner of President Bush's son Neil, defaulted on 
about $100 million in loans from Silverado Savings &amp; Loan. Those bad loans 
contributed to the thrift's failure, which it has been estimated will cost 
taxpayers more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
While Walters told Congress earlier this year that he was broke, he has 
continued to live a life of luxury. In recent months, he has resided in a 
$1.9-million Newport Beach home, a $1-million desert retreat in Indian Wells 
and a $250,000 mobile home in Laguna Beach. The properties are held in the name 
of his wife, Jacqueline, or in a trust of which she is the sole beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
But in a lawsuit filed in federal court here, Bankruptcy Trustee R. Neil 
Rodgers claimed that Jacqueline Walters and attorneys running the family trusts 
had "knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed among themselves to devise a 
common scheme and design to hinder, delay and defraud the creditors" of 
Walters. 
</P>
<P>
Walters filed for personal bankruptcy on Nov. 1, saying he had liabilities of 
$279 million. He did not list any assets but told Congress at a hearing earlier 
this year that he had a "negative net worth." 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers is asking federal Bankruptcy Judge John Wilson to seize the three 
Walters properties in Southern California for the benefit of the creditors. 
</P>
<P>
"What is apparent to us is the guy has attempted to make it appear that the 
substantial wealth he has accumulated isn't his," said Ronald Rus, an attorney 
for Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Walters could not be reached for comment Wednesday, and his San Diego attorney, 
Nathan E. Jones, did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers' suit claims that Walters either transferred ownership outright to his 
wife or secretly provided funds for the purchase of four properties in 
Colorado, three homes in California and six cars, including a Rolls-Royce and a 
Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Rodgers claims that Walters gave his wife $250,000 to buy a 
Laguna Beach mobile home and provided $2.1 million to the trustees purchasing 
the Newport Beach estate for the trust of which she is the sole beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
"Said property was transferred by debtor for the sole purpose of deceiving and 
defrauding debtor's creditors," Rodgers claimed in his lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the transfers were made just two days after the couple were married in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
During a brief interview earlier this summer in the Walterses' Newport Beach 
estate -- which features four bedrooms, three baths and a courtyard pool -- 
Jacqueline said the family's assets were hers. "He owns nothing in Orange 
County," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers has sued Jacqueline Walters and the trustees for conspiracy and 
conveyance of fraudulent transfers, claiming that Bill Walters sometimes 
transferred millions of dollars of his own money to her. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to her marriage to debtor, J. Walters was employed by debtor as his 
secretary," Rodgers claimed in the lawsuit. She "does not have and has not had, 
at all relevant times herein, an independent source of income." 
</P>
<P>
Rus said the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is one of Walters' largest 
creditors because of the Silverado defaults. "We think the FDIC is the largest 
creditor of the estate and so this is to the benefit of the taxpayers," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of Silverado has drawn national attention because Neil Bush was a 
director of the institution. Bush is under investigation on conflict of 
interest charges for approving loans to Walters because the two men were 
partners in an oil exploration firm. 
</P>
<P>
Other allegations have arisen against Walters in other proceedings. Earlier 
this month in Los Angeles Superior Court, a Denver attorney said he had reason 
to believe that Walters had deposited about $20 million in 1986 in a bank off 
the English coast. 
</P>
<P>
This disclosure came during a divorce proceeding between John and Elisabeth 
Dick, Denver socialites and acquaintances of the Walterses. Former Colorado 
state Sen. Arch Decker said Elisabeth claimed that her husband, a real estate 
investor, told her that he had arranged the offshore deposit. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Kolodny, John Dick's attorney, said the allegation is ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
"This was all a grandstanding effort on the part of a washed-up senator and 
lawyer trying to get into the newspapers," Kolodny said Wednesday. "This is a 
wild story that either Elisabeth Dick or Arch Decker have made up." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Decker nor Elisabeth Dick could be reach for comment Wednesday.

Dumbo flies again: After being grounded for seven months, a new and improved 
"Dumbo the Flying Elephant" ride has again taken to the air at Disneyland's 
Fantasyland. 
</P>
<P>
The ride was reopened last week after being closed for renovation in April, 
following an accident in which one of its metal arms collapsed and slightly 
injured a 13-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
The incident came a year after a similar one in which a metal bracket holding 
one of the flying Dumbos gave way. That mishap resulted in scrapes and bruises 
to a family of three. 
</P>
<P>
And Dumbo fans will be pleased to know that the ride, which opened in 1955, now 
has 16 elephants, up from 10. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great-looking ride," said Disneyland spokesman John McClintock. The 
renovation "addresses not only the mechanical concerns but makes it more 
convenient."

NO LIE: ISUZU GIVING ITS DEALERS $2 MILLION TO SPEND AT THE MALL

<P>
It's a $2-million spending spree that might render Joe Isuzu speechless. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 of the nation's hottest Isuzu dealers will converge at South Coast 
Plaza Saturday and Sunday for a modern-day version of Supermarket Sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
The dealers will be spending an average of $10,000 -- some as much as $50,000 
-- as part of an incentive program offered by American Isuzu Motors, the 
Japanese auto maker's U.S. marketing arm based in the City of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
And for the dealers, there will be no taking home the leftover cash. They've 
been instructed to spend it -- or lose it. 
</P>
<P>
American Isuzu has offered the program for several years as a way of rewarding 
its top dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Henwood, South Coast Plaza's general manager, said the mall tried to lure 
the Isuzu dealers three years ago but lost out to Trump Plaza in New York. 
Another past destination for the Isuzu dealers was Nieman Marcus' flagship 
store in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Henwood said, South Coast Plaza lured the group with the help of the 
Nordstrom department store chain, which has a store at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to give the impression that their dealers are being taken to the 
finest retail establishments in the U.S.," Henwood said. 
</P>
<P>
An American Isuzu official said no one was immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Henwood said South Coast retailers have been told a $2-million windfall is 
headed their way. Clerks have been told to watch for people wearing Isuzu lapel 
pins and carrying special credit cards. The cards will be issued to each dealer 
and will allow them to charge an amount equal to their incentive payment, plus 
10%, in case they run over their allotment and want to pay out-of-pocket. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Plaza officials plan to roll out the red carpet for the group. The 
mall will host a reception for the 200 dealers and, after their hard day of 
shopping, provide them with free foot massages.

By the turn of the century, television viewers can expect to see many more 
channels and see them more clearly, leaders of the cable television industry 
told the 23rd annual Western Cable Conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a panel discussion kicking off the conference here, four major figures in 
cable and broadcast television agreed that the reason for the expansion was 
competition. But they disagreed about the technological mix that will bring 
this bounty into their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks to me like terrestrial (cable) networks are going to go into a Golden 
Age," said John C. Malone, president of Tele-Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"I see it as an age of the cable industry doing the things that have made it 
great," Malone said, "but (with) greater reliability, higher quality pictures, 
more diversity, greater customer choice. . . . Doing the job so well, in such a 
consumer-friendly fashion that it will continue to gain position as the 
dominant delivery mechanism." 
</P>
<P>
Burton Staniar, chairman of Westinghouse Broadcasting, said "broadcasting is 
going to be more competitive," insisting that cable would not replace 
over-the-air broadcasters such as his company. "I haven't seen a medium yet 
that has replaced another one," he said. "I don't think any of the ones coming 
along are going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner, chairman of Turner Broadcasting System disagreed, predicting a 
bleak future for the commercial broadcasting networks. 
</P>
<P>
He said that when cable reaches 75% of penetration -- it is now around 60% -- 
that will be essentially universal coverage because the 25% of the homes that 
will not be hooked up to cable will be the least demographically desirable: 
core city, the unemployed, the homeless. Turner added that the competition for 
viewers "will make it difficult for all programmers to prosper and survive -- 
both broadcasters and cable programmers." 
</P>
<P>
"Americans have always shown a willingness to want more," said Robert Wussler, 
president of Comsat Video Enterprises, citing the demand for the growth of 
professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us on this panel grew up with three or four or five television station 
channels wherever we came from, and today we have 35 channels," Wussler said. 
"I'm convinced that in the year 2000 we'll have 100 television channels." 
</P>
<P>
Malone surprised some in the audience by saying he had changed his mind about 
the future of direct broadcast satellites (DBS), which some considered a 
serious challenge to the cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of DBS say it will broadcast a whole spectrum of channels directly to 
small, inexpensive satellite receivers. Most in the industry believe that such 
satellites could be profitable by offering 40 to 50 channels of first-run 
movies on a pay-per-view basis, along with live sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
The main target of pay-per-view, the panelists agreed, was the $11-billion home 
video store market, which one panelist called "a pot of gold." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe there will be an explosion in the pay-per-view area," Malone 
predicted, and that "critical mass will be achieved somewhere in the mid-90s." 
</P>
<P>
However, while his company has been involved in several DBS projects, believing 
that "satellite was the right technology," Malone said he now believes that 
technological changes in the past year made it economically feasible to greatly 
expand cable channel capacity through fiber optics instead. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, this new technology will enable cable operators to deliver large 
numbers of pay-per-view movies, high-definition television and other "exotic 
services," Malone said, without having to rely on satellites. 
</P>
<P>
Direct broadcast satellites would still provide a "bridging technology" until 
fiber-optic technology is in place. It could also reach those rural homes which 
will never be connected to cable, now estimated to number 6 million to 8 
million.

PEACE BRINGS ECONOMIC WAR, HUGHES CHAIRMAN SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: MALCOLM R. CURRIE CALLS FOR NATIONAL POLICY TO HELP U.S. CONTRACTORS 
STAY COMPETITIVE WHILE CONVERTING THEIR INDUSTRIES TO NEW WORLD CLIMATE.

Despite growing tensions in the Persian Gulf, the end of the Cold War could 
usher in an era of peace in which most international conflict will be economic, 
the chairman of Hughes Aircraft Co. said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare for that change, the United States must formulate an industrial 
policy to help U.S. defense contractors stay competitive and ease their gradual 
conversion to non-military businesses, said Malcolm R. Currie, Hughes chairman 
and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
"To put it bluntly, I see peace not as the transition from military 
confrontation to tranquility and prosperity, but from military confrontation to 
economic warfare, based largely on technology-related issues," he said. "Peace 
is a competitive struggle for us to win or lose." 
</P>
<P>
Currie's remarks came during the opening day of a two-day conference titled 
"What If Peace?," sponsored by Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine and 
the California Engineering Foundation. The conference's stated purpose is to 
develop strategies for peace. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a temporary boost in business from the U.S. buildup in the Persian 
Gulf, Currie said the defense industry will continue to "downsize and 
consolidate" as Pentagon budgets remain flat or shrink in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense business is hanging out over the edge of a cliff and people will 
start falling off the cliff toward the end of 1992," Currie said in an 
interview after the speech. "We see modest downsizing at Hughes, but I'm 
worried that in the 1992 time-frame production contracts will run out for many 
companies in the industry." 
</P>
<P>
Currie said Hughes, which earlier this year was an unsuccessful bidder for 
Newport Beach-based Ford Aerospace Corp., would consider defense acquisitions 
if they fit with Hughes' current operations. 
</P>
<P>
But he said Hughes would look to replace its current defense contracts with 
non-military business -- for example, the international air-traffic control 
business -- to help limit future layoffs. In June, 1989, Westchester-based 
Hughes announced it would cut more than 6,000 of its 75,000 employees by 
attrition to prepare for Pentagon budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Currie said he personally believes it would be a "tragic mistake" to go to war 
in the Persian Gulf because of the potential loss of life and damage to U.S. 
relations with the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
"If it can be solved some other way, we should do it," Currie said. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Fink, editor-in-chief of Aviation Week and Space Technology, said Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait does not make the issues discussed at the conference 
irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of us seriously thought that with the end of the Cold War we 
would enter a period of total tranquility in the world," he said. "We should 
look at this period as if it were similar to the world after the end of World 
War II."

THE IMAGE JUST HAPPENED, ROCKERS SAY;

BAND: THOUGH CATEGORIZED AS "GLAM-ROCKERS," THE FIVE MEMBERS OF ORANGE COUNTY 
GROUP ONYXX SAY THEIR MUSIC IS MULTIFACETED.

<TEXT>
<P>
They are on equal footing with many of the best aspiring rock bands on the Los 
Angeles music scene and believe that they are ahead of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
They are five teen-agers from Orange County who are excelling in a music world 
dominated by bands that have been around much longer than their 1 1/2-year 
career. 
</P>
<P>
They are Scott Casey, Craig Williams, Abin Achrekar, Adam Glauser and Pat Romo 
-- and their band is Onyxx. 
</P>
<P>
Onyxx's music is "hard and rough-edged with melodic vocals, separating us from 
everyone else," said Casey, the lead singer and a junior at Esperanza High 
School in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Although considered "glam-rockers," "we never classified ourselves as a 
glam-rock group -- other people classified us," Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
While their manager, Candice Scott, said the boys remind her of the band 
Poison, they believe they're more like Van Halen or their fellow L.A. rockers, 
Extreme. Either way, they insist their image isn't calculated. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't plan on the image we have," said Williams, lead guitarist and, like 
all but Casey, a junior at Canyon High School in Anaheim Hills. "Scott is glam, 
his voice is glam, his style is glam . . . and what the singer's image is, is 
what the band's image is." 
</P>
<P>
Added Casey: "A lot of people shoot us down because of the way we look, but we 
seem to do well with the opposite sex and the Hollywood scene." 
</P>
<P>
Though Onyxx has yet to sign a record company contract, they say they are 
close. But they refuse to allow themselves to believe it until it actually 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
"You can never say you have a contract until it's in your hands," Casey said. 
"Every band thinks they are going to get signed, but we have a gimmick: We are 
10 years younger than other bands on the (Sunset) Strip." 
</P>
<P>
Said Williams: "We have a good sense of appeal to the record companies. They 
seem to be looking for New Kids on the Block in metal." 
</P>
<P>
Casey, who along with lifelong friend Williams founded Onyxx, has never had a 
singing lesson and has been writing what he calls "joke songs" since age 6. 
</P>
<P>
"Joke songs are songs we wrote as kids that dealt with subjects that we dealt 
with at that age," Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
At age 13, they put together their first band, Stone Cloth. When Achrekar 
joined the group on bass guitar a year later, they changed their name to 
Devolution. 
</P>
<P>
Their first performance was before an audience of seven friends in a room at 
Williams' house, where their homemade stage was decorated with Christmas 
lights. The next year, Glauser joined the band on drums, and they became Onyxx. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said a science class helped them come up with the group's name. "I saw 
it in a textbook from school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Onyx is a multifaceted stone," their manager, Scott, noted. "And as you can 
see, these guys are each multifaceted." 
</P>
<P>
They first performed professionally at 15, playing in a club in Los Angeles, 
where they have served as both supporting band and headliner. They insist, 
however, that they prefer to open shows because it allows their younger fans to 
see them and then get home before curfew. 
</P>
<P>
They take pride in making their stage show energetic -- "just because we're 
young doesn't mean we can't give 110%," Glauser said -- and they enjoy 
interacting with their audience. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very influential, and I expect them to be role models," said Scott, 
who was introduced to the band when her teen-age daughter, Pamela, brought 
Glauser to their house in Anaheim. "Basically, these are good kids. Kids can 
look at these guys and relate to them because they don't have attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the 453 bands in L.A. and you see Onyxx, you see they're 
different." 
</P>
<P>
The guys agree, saying they are a one-of-a-kind band with a unique sound and 
style. 
</P>
<P>
"We're an original band," Williams said. "We have our own style of music that 
is incomparable to other artists." 
</P>
<P>
They have preferences, however, when it comes to other musicians, with Stryper, 
Eddie Van Halen, Jimi Hendrix and Bon Jovi heading the list. 
</P>
<P>
But Glauser insisted, "We only sound like us." 
</P>
<P>
Without a demo record, Onyxx counts on the strength of its live show. Casey and 
Williams write most of the band's songs, and they perform only original 
material in concert. 
</P>
<P>
"Where our lyrics are concerned," Glauser said, "we're more than just love and 
sex." 
</P>
<P>
The band, which has played in such clubs as the Roxy, Troubadour, Marquee and 
Whiskey, has no current local dates on its calendar but is planning a summer 
tour of Japan and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The guys are looking forward to the future, but haven't forgotten their 
not-so-long-ago past. 
</P>
<P>
Playing one of their earliest gigs at an L.A. club called Rock Around the Clock 
in August, 1989, Casey was sick with the flu and the band floundered. Their 
audience that night, composed of mostly speed-metal fans, heckled them 
mercilessly. 
</P>
<P>
Later that month, Onyxx returned to the same stage and, this time, turned in 
what they believed to be their best performance to date. Afterward, they 
autographed more than 200 of their promotional pictures. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, managing this band and seeing it perform live is like being a mom when 
you have friends over and your baby takes its first step," said Scott, who saw 
Onyxx perform for the first time that night. "It's a natural high for me to see 
them on stage with all the kids yelling for them." 
</P>
<P>
As for education, Achrekar said, "No matter what, I will never quit school. I 
will go to college also. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Said Williams: "The band is the band, school is school. They are two different 
parts of our lives, and we're able to balance them."

COLLEGES RESPONDING TO NEEDS OF VEGETARIAN STUDENTS

Vegetarian students considering colleges have to look at more than just the 
course catalog. 
</P>
<P>
At some schools, they could end up surviving on salad bars and peanut butter, 
while at others, entire dining rooms are devoted to vegetarian food. 
</P>
<P>
"Food service directors are really working hard in meeting each segment of the 
student population's expectations," said Clark Dehaven of the National Assn. of 
College and University Food Service in East Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Vegetarian eating has grown slowly but steadily over the past decade in 
colleges, Dehaven said. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 8 million to 9 million Americans are vegetarians. 
</P>
<P>
The Marriott Corp., which provides food for about 400 colleges, offers at least 
one vegetarian entree at lunch and dinner in addition to salad bars and 
yogurts, spokeswoman Kathy Boyle said. The company had about a dozen vegetarian 
recipes in its menu rotation 15 years ago, and now has about 50, including 
carrot loaf with pea sauce, curried vegetables with beans and sunflower seeds, 
and vegetable quiche, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a matter of taking the time and investing the time in the 
students and developing a program," said Paul Tuennerman, director of dining 
services for Morrison Custom Management, which provides the food at Swarthmore 
College in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
"A year and a half ago, I thought a vegetarian entree was rice with cheese on 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then Tuennerman began meeting with vegetarian students, reading books and 
testing recipes. Now the school serves such dishes as tofu Oriental salad, 
carrot loaf, eggplant con queso, and Moroccan stew with yams, raisins, carrots 
and other vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
There are two vegetarian choices at every meal, one of them vegan, meaning no 
animal products of any kind. Lacto-ovo vegetarians eat no flesh but do eat eggs 
and dairy products. 
</P>
<P>
At Oberlin College's lacto-ovo "veggie dining hall," there also is a vegan 
option for lunches and every other dinner, said dietitian Rebecca Stotter. 
</P>
<P>
"We're finding more students are wanting strict vegan entrees. Health reasons, 
possibly ethical reasons too," Stotter said.

Nancy Ann Van Wie of Laguna Hills, who writes and publishes the "Travels With 
Max" series of travel and activity books for young children, is now publishing 
a children's newsletter to encourage children "to experience and explore the 
rewards of reading." 
</P>
<P>
"Travels With Max -- A Newsletter Just for Kids," introduces children to 
faraway places, different cultures, current events and human interest stories. 
</P>
<P>
Van Wie says the newsletter, which is aimed at children aged 7 through 11, also 
allows them to participate in the actual content of the newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids are encouraged to send in ideas on stories, their favorite books, 
riddles, recipes and information on themselves if they want a pen pal," says 
Van Wie, who has a master's degree in education and is the author and creator 
of the United Airlines Fun Book, "J.P. Jetsetter, King of the Friendly Skies." 
</P>
<P>
The newsletter will be published seven times a year. For further information,

OTHER ARTS GROUPS SEE NO CHANGE IN SALES

<P>
Economic recession has yet to hit other arts organizations in Orange County to 
the degree that the Performing Arts Center claims to have been hit, although 
there have been signs that some people are spending less on tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely saw a pattern evolve after the Middle East crisis began," said 
Erich Vollmer, executive director of the Orange County Philharmonic Society. 
"Tickets stopped being sold. Season subscriptions just stopped, trickled to 
nothing. We were doing very well up to that point." 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit was a concert by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam in 
late September, as the war fever was building, Vollmer said. But since then 
both subscription and individual ticket sales have improved, and the Leningrad 
Philharmonic sold out in early November. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, season subscription sales fell $52,000 short of a $1.1-million goal 
-- "not a dramatic drop-off," Vollmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Fund raising, meanwhile, has not been affected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're right on target on our individual contributors goal, and in fact may 
even exceed it by June 30. And we have been able to attract some significant 
new corporate support." 
</P>
<P>
At the Pacific Symphony, executive director Louis Spisto said, "If I didn't 
read the paper I wouldn't know we had a recession. Thus far, we have not been 
hit one bit." 
</P>
<P>
And although Performing Arts Center President Thomas R. Kendrick blamed box 
office woes there on the summer, which he called "a risk period" for all arts, 
Spisto said that attendance at the symphony's five-concert summer series at the 
Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre was "phenomenal" and unaffected by the economy or 
events in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Spisto said subscriptions to the orchestra's performance appear to be running 
ahead of last year. Single ticket sales are also up, he said, perhaps 
reflecting interest in the symphony's new music director, Carl St. Clair. 
</P>
<P>
Fund raising is running ahead, Spisto said, with only one corporate sponsor -- 
a development company -- not renewing its support. 
</P>
<P>
At the Irvine Barclay Theatre, which opened on the UC Irvine campus in October, 
ticket sales have been quite slow, but director Douglas R. Rankin is hesitant 
to blame the recession, based on "our vast experience of six weeks on the 
stage." It's only recently, he said, that "more people are beginning to know 
we're here." 
</P>
<P>
However, a particularly disastrous run of England's Hull Truck Theatre Co. "did 
put a cautious note in the back of my mind," Rankin said. 
</P>
<P>
With only 750 seats to fill, and financial support from both the city and the 
university, the Barclay is under much less pressure than the Performing Arts 
Center. As a result, it has considerably more flexibility in programming for 
specialized audiences, offering a wider range of performers, including musical 
soloists, modern dance companies and community arts groups. MARK I. PINSKY

THE RAMS TAKE A LOOK AT THE FLIP SIDE; 
</P>
<P>
ELLARD'S INJURY PUT ANDERSON IN THE SPOTLIGHT AGAINST 49ERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ask, and Flipper shall receive, usually 22 yards at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Most weeks, the Rams ask Flipper Anderson to run up and down the field all game 
long, scare any defensive back required to guard him, and then throw his way 
only five or six times. 
</P>
<P>
As long as he catches three or four of those long passes, and as long as his 
complement, Henry Ellard, is there to work the precision-possession routes 
Anderson's sprints open up, the Rams are content to let Anderson be the most 
dangerous 45-catch-a-season receiver in the league. 
</P>
<P>
But then there are games such as last Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers, 
and Anderson gives the Rams reason to wonder what kind of damage he could wreak 
if he caught eight or nine or 12 passes every week. 
</P>
<P>
With Ellard sidelined and Aaron Cox out early, Anderson was the Rams' only 
receiving weapon, not merely a bombardier, catching eight passes for a 
season-high 149 yards. 
</P>
<P>
He caught long passes, medium passes, timing passes, tipped passes and slipped 
passes. Everything the Rams asked for, Anderson gave them. On a day when Jerry 
Rice was almost invisible, Anderson did a nimble impression of the league's 
most dominant wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I go into a game and I get one, two balls thrown at me, and I'm 
expected to make the play," Anderson said. "But when you've got an opportunity 
like Sunday, get 10, 15 balls thrown your way, you get more of an opportunity 
to catch the ball, and it doesn't look as bad if you miss one." 
</P>
<P>
Such is Anderson's lot on the Rams, as long as Ellard is around to catch 75 
passes a season. Anderson gets only a handful of shots to catch the ball, and 
when he gets them, he is expected to change the pulse of the game. 
</P>
<P>
And when he doesn't -- remember the drop of a wide-open bomb from quarterback 
Jim Everett against the New York Giants? -- everybody wonders why. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Anderson has caught 33 passes for 722 yards. His 21.9-yard average 
is by far the highest in the league, more than three yards a reception more 
than his nearest rival, the Raiders' Willie Gault. 
</P>
<P>
Think the Rams don't often imagine what 22-yards-a-catch would mean to their 
offense if Anderson caught twice as many passes? 
</P>
<P>
"He is prepared to expand into a 75-catch-a-year guy," Coach John Robinson 
said. "What is his average for the year? Twenty-one? That's way up there. 
That's higher than Rice's. I think his skills are coming up there to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Before last week, however, Anderson caught 10 passes in the past six games. 
Against the Chicago Bears, he had one catch for 53 yards. Against the Atlanta 
Falcons, he had two catches for 61 yards, and against the New York Giants, he 
had one catch for 30 yards and that celebrated drop. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy like Flip, he's such a big-play guy, and big plays can come or go," 
receivers coach Norval Turner said. "Just like the Giant game. I mean, he 
catches that ball, his average is probably what it was a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so close to going one way or the other when you're a big-play guy that 
you can be playing as well and not getting the numbers, you know what I'm 
saying? It just comes at a certain time. He had a period there in the middle 
where I think he was in a little bit of a slump, and I think he's come out of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
For the player who set the single-game receiving-yards record last year (336 
against the New Orleans Saints) and averaged 26.0 yards a catch, 10 catches in 
six games didn't figure. Ten catches in six games is why Anderson concedes he 
probably won't make the Pro Bowl again this season. 
</P>
<P>
All while the offense struggled. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when the game's over," Robinson said, "you kind of say, 'God, we 
should've gotten him the ball more.' I think for a while there we were looking 
three or four times a game to him deep, and that was about it -- forgetting a 
little bit about the consistency of getting him balls underneath. 
</P>
<P>
"But you get stuck with those kinds of things, you wind up throwing to certain 
people, you start thinking certain ways about people, and that can be a 
limiting thing." 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the Rams also know that Anderson is at his most threatening when 
he isn't being overused. Force the ball to him when he is double-covered, and 
22-yards-a-catch turns into 17-a-pop and a slew of interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, isn't that a bummer?" Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Putting the fear of Flipper into a defense's head is almost effective enough, 
the Rams say, and forcing it to him lessens his impact. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've made, a couple different times in the season, a real concerted 
effort to say, 'Hey, we've got to make sure we throw it up the field to him,' " 
Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
"But what happens is at times this season when our offense hasn't been as 
consistent -- people talking about well, you're not driving the ball, you're 
not keeping the ball, you don't have that consistency -- well, there's a give 
and take. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, it's exciting to see the big plays up the field to him, but your 
percentage is low on that. You take those shots, and when you don't get them, 
it's hard to drive the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"So the best thing with Flip is for us to pick and choose, then give him his 
shots up field." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, for his part, says he doesn't mind letting Ellard assume most of the 
pass-catching burden, since Ellard is so competent at the medium-range 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
His job is to hit the home run, and if that can't happen every game, he can 
learn to live with it. 
</P>
<P>
"Every receiver would like to catch 70, 80 balls a year," Anderson said. "But 
in this offense, Henry, he's the guy who does all that. I'm just the spot 
receiver and get what I can. 
</P>
<P>
"As a personal goal, every receiver would like to get 1,000 yards, and however 
I go about getting that, it doesn't matter whether I do it in 40 catches or 80. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all right with me. I don't mind being Flipper. I don't have to be Jerry 
Rice."

THERE IS NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT FOR STANFORD'S SANDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the anthropology professor explained that the expectation level is the 
primary difference between humans and monkeys, a few students skimmed The 
Stanford Daily. 
</P>
<P>
Others thumbed through the syllabus, making notations for a research paper that 
had just been assigned. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, though, the professor made a declaration that caught the attention of 
Summer Sanders, the lanky blonde in the 15th row of the lecture hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Human beings live in a world that doesn't exist," he said. "A world of worries 
and dreams that have not occurred yet. Monkeys live only in the present, not in 
the past or the future." 
</P>
<P>
For Sanders, there is no better time than the present. If her freshman year at 
Stanford is anything like her freshman year -- which she calls the best year of 
her life -- at Oakmont High in Roseville, Calif., she has it made. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, if she thinks ahead to this weekend's U.S. Open or the World Swimming 
Championships in January or the 1992 Olympic Games, she'll go crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"You only have so much worrying in you," Sanders said. "I hate worrying and 
being nervous for races. I like to talk and laugh." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Sanders can excuse the swimming world for wanting to press fast 
forward. Expectations are high since her triple gold-medal performance in the 
Goodwill Games last July. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders' clocking of 2 minutes 9.46 seconds in the 200-meter butterfly was the 
second-fastest ever by an American and the fastest in the world in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Despite qualifying last in the 200 individual medley, she struck gold again in 
2:14.06, the fastest time by an American since Tracy Caulkins' effort in the 
1984 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
And in the meet's biggest upset, Sanders handed Janet Evans her first defeat 
since 1986, knocking an astonishing 8.68 seconds off her 400 individual medley 
best. Sanders' clocking of 4:39.22 is the fastest in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
Though Sanders is 3.12 seconds shy of Petra Schneider's 1982 world record, 
Stanford Coach Richard Quick believes Sanders eventually will break it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's absolutely no question in my mind," said Quick, who also serves as 
U.S. national team women's coach. "Summer Sanders has the potential in the 400 
individual medley to go under the world record." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Sanders despises that event, a sequence of 100 meters of butterfly, 
backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle that some coaches call the toughest race 
because of the stroke versatility and stamina it demands. "If I never swam 
another 400 IM in my life, I'd probably be the happiest person in the world," 
Sanders said. "It is the hardest thing ever." 
</P>
<P>
Like many medley swimmers, Sanders was an age-group breast-stroker. A pulled 
muscle prevented her from training in the breast-stroke for a few months and 
sparked her interest in and mastery of the butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
"Her butterfly rivals the efficiency of Mary T. Meagher," Quick said of the 
world record-holder in the 100 and 200 butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Sanders' second leg was a weak link. But her club coach, Mike 
Hastings of California Capital Aquatics, developed her into a national-caliber 
backstroker. 
</P>
<P>
The third leg, breaststroke, has always been a strength. 
</P>
<P>
All that remains for Sanders to improve is her freestyle, a segment that most 
medley swimmers don't struggle with because much of their training is in 
freestyle. Although Sanders' freestyle is above average, it doesn't compare to 
her other strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Her ability to stave off Evans, the world record-holder in three distance 
freestyle events, was a breakthrough. "(Rivals) always pass me," Sanders said. 
"I've been passed many times." 
</P>
<P>
The most painful of those occurred at the 1988 U.S. Olympic trials in Austin, 
Tex. Sanders led by a body length with 50 meters left when Mary Wayte and 
Whitney Hedgepeth passed her and became the two representatives the United 
States sent to Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
At Oakmont High, Sanders' classmates staged a rally that cheered her up, 
despite her reluctance to be in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know about the rally," Sanders said, "because if I'd known about it, 
I wouldn't have shown up. I was kind of embarrassed. I started crying up there 
in front of the whole school. I felt (foolish). But it was nice. . . . I was 
real honored." 
</P>
<P>
Although Sanders yearns to be accepted, she wants the option of being 
unconventional. That is what binds her family in their own definition of 
togetherness. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders' parents divorced when she was 7. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea what it was," Sanders said. "All I remember is that my friend's 
parents had just gotten divorced. Her parents were buying her all these toys so 
when my parents told me they were getting divorced I said, 'Yes. Toys! Woo!' I 
had no idea what a divorce was." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders found out soon enough that it meant moving from one parent's home to 
the other every six months. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I would move from one house to another, I seriously probably 
couldn't talk for a day," she said. "I was so sad. I'd sit there and cry for 
about most of the day. You get so used to coming home and there's your dad and 
you do certain things with him, and then you all of a sudden move and your dad 
is not there. And me with my swimming, I didn't see him that much, you know. I 
maybe talked to him a couple times a week. We'd go out to dinner every once in 
a while and go to a movie, but it wasn't the same." 
</P>
<P>
It became more difficult at 15 when her older brother, Trevor, stopped making 
the switch. 
</P>
<P>
"That was kind of a bummer when I had to leave him," Sanders said. "But I like 
going to my mom's so I kept at it." 
</P>
<P>
That has been the key to Sanders' sunny disposition, maintaining warm 
relationships with her father, her mother, her brother and her stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really close to all the parts of my family," Sanders said. "I think I want 
my kids to have the same family I do. God, they're so laid back. You know, it's 
not like you have to do this, otherwise you'll be a bad person. Like, if you 
want to, you can. It is totally up to us. When I think about church, it was up 
to us. My swimming was up to me. " 
</P>
<P>
Summer Sanders, nickname Scum, reveals nothing about swimming on the canvas of 
collegiate personality, her dorm room walls. 
</P>
<P>
They are plastered with Michael Jordan posters and she wears Air Jordans that 
Trevor gave her on graduation day, the ones she slept in that night. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders' roommate didn't even know she was living with a world-class swimmer 
until one of Sanders' swimming friends told her. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders is equally eager to conceal her academic prowess. She makes no mention 
of her U.S. Swimming Academic All-American status. Sanders is intimidated by 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first got here, I was real worried because people were using these huge 
words, and I'm into the simple kind of stuff," she said. "One day my friend Lea 
Loveless and I were walking down the hall when someone said something about 
mendicants. 
</P>
<P>
"I said 'Lea, my vocabulary is not very good, what is mendicants?' and she 
said, 'Oh God, Summer, it is a singing group.' " 
</P>
<P>
It is not something she's going to worry about, however. Sanders tries not to 
look back or forward. 
</P>
<P>
Her faithful watch ever on her wrist, she simply follows her demanding academic 
and athletic schedule, including predawn swims while the rest of the campus 
sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
Her idea of a good time? Whatever is going on right now. 
</P>
<P>
"I could just sit here in my dorm room looking at my pictures," Sanders said. 
"I could listen to music. I could read this Homer book ('The Iliad') . . . oh, 
just kidding."

ANGELS' PURSUIT OF RIGHETTI DEPENDS ON LENGTH OF DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite their preference to avoid the free-agent market, the Angels could 
become a serious suitor for the services of left-handed reliever Dave Righetti, 
who has spent all of his nine-plus major league seasons with the New York 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the Angels pursue the San Jose native apparently hinges on whether he 
insists on a five-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have said they are reluctant to sign pitchers for more than three 
years, a sentiment that also has been expressed by the Dodgers, and might keep 
them from signing Righetti. 
</P>
<P>
Righetti's agent, Bill Goodstein, said Wednesday he has had "continuing" talks 
in recent weeks with Angel General Manager Mike Port and Senior Vice President 
Dan O'Brien, who handles the club's contract negotiations. According to 
Goodstein, the Angels' intentions are earnest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard to assess degrees of interest since you have lots of 
conversations with lots of teams," Goodstein said from New York. "But I would 
say the Angels clearly have reasonable interest. His wife, Kandice, is from 
Orange County, and he's from California. We think the Angels have a very good 
team and will be a contending team, and that's a factor I know interests 
David." 
</P>
<P>
However, the desire for a long-term contract is a complication. Goodstein said 
he would prefer a five-year deal but would settle for a "solid" four-year 
contract. Righetti made $1.55 million in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Righetti was worth pursuing, O'Brien said, "At a very slow and 
well-informed pace." 
</P>
<P>
Righetti, who turned 32 Wednesday, had 36 saves in 39 opportunities last 
season. His 224 career saves is the most by a left-hander and seventh on the 
all-time list.

Jay Schroeder took his normal rotation at quarterback in Wednesday's practice 
and reported that his sprained left knee should not keep him from starting 
Sunday's game against the Broncos at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt in my mind," Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels real good, and I've still got a few more days. When Sunday rolls 
around, I think it will feel real good." 
</P>
<P>
Raider Coach Art Shell said Schroeder probably will start, based on Wednesday's 
practice. But Shell said he would decide Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Shell said earlier there was a chance Steve Beuerlein would be activated for 
the first time this season as security, but that Vince Evans would be the first 
quarterback off the bench.

GIANTS' BANKS ARRESTED AFTER FAMILY DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York Giant linebacker Carl Banks said that a family dispute that led to his 
arrest was a minor problem that was blown out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
Banks was arrested around 10:15 a.m. Tuesday and charged with criminal mischief 
under the Domestic Violence Act, said Watchung, N.J., police Lt. Robert Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Tom Dooley and his crew reportedly were reprimanded by the NFL for 
failing to penalize the Cincinnati Bengals for an illegal substitution Nov. 18 
against the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
Steeler Coach Chuck Noll said the league has been lax in enforcing a rule that 
permits defenses reasonable time to make a substitution when the offense 
changes players. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL's supervisor of officials, Art McNally, said the rules require 
officials to warn the offensive coach for the first violation, then penalize 
the team 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct for every subsequent violation.

SPENCER IN HURRY TO GET BACK INTO PLAYING FORM

Running back Tim Spencer practiced Wednesday with the Chargers for the first 
time since he was released during exhibition season. Spencer was signed Tuesday 
to replace running back Joe Mickles, who was put on injured reserve because of 
a quadriceps injury he sustained in Sunday's loss to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to get in shape real quick, like in about two or three more days," 
said Spencer, who played for the Chargers from 1985-89. "I've been doing some 
things but there's a difference when you're running full speed on your own 
versus trying to run full speed against somebody who's been running full speed 
for 10 weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Henning likes what he sees so far. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks fine for a real estate salesman," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Arthur Cox, who has refused to talk to reporters since his two costly 
fumbles in Sunday's game, broke his silence Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly. 
</P>
<P>
Cox was listed on the Charger injury report with a thigh bruise. Asked if he 
had a minute to talk, he said: "I'm in a rush." 
</P>
<P>
And the injury? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bruise. It's nothing I can't play with this week." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers rushed for a season-high 224 yards in the first meeting with the 
Jets, a 39-3 Charger victory. Henning said that wasn't particularly 
significant. 
</P>
<P>
"The inordinate amount of yardage is the fact that we got ahead in the game and 
we were able to run the ball more," he said. "Our yards per carry are about the 
same in that game as they have been in other games." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver said the Chargers changed the use of their tight 
ends in that game, which helped open up the running attack. 
</P>
<P>
Linebackers Junior Seau (ankle/groin) and Billy Ray Smith (elbow) are listed as 
questionable on the Charger injury report, but Henning expects both to play. 
</P>
<P>
Jet injuries: Linebacker Joe Kelly (knee) is out; guard Mike Haight (toe) is 
doubtful; defensive end Jeff Lageman (arm) is questionable. 
</P>
<P>
The approximate number of tickets distributed for Sunday's game is 44,000, 
according to Jack Teele, assistant to the president. Teele said the game will 
not be a sellout, which means it will not be televised locally. DON PATTERSON

Ram receiver Henry Ellard, who was held out of last week's game with a sore 
right hamstring, is healthy enough to play this Sunday's game at Cleveland, 
Coach John Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson also said that Aaron Cox, who started in Ellard's place Sunday but 
had to leave with a sore hamstring, probably won't be ready for the game 
against the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
Finishing up the sore hamstring news, Robinson said he wasn't sure whether 
starting tight end Damone Johnson could play. Cox and Johnson are listed as 
questionable and Ellard is listed as probable. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams signed linebacker Bruce Klostermann to take the special teams duties 
of linebacker Greg Clark, who was placed on injured reserve after breaking a 
bone in his right leg last Sunday. TIM KAWAKAMI

LOYOLA TO PLAY IN VOLLEYBALL INVITATIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For only the second time, the Loyola Marymount volleyball team will compete in 
postseason play when the Lions open play today in the 20-team Women's 
Invitational Volleyball Championships in Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament took the best teams not chosen for NCAA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola and Cal State Northridge were the only California teams selected. 
</P>
<P>
In Coach Steve Stratos' first season, the Lions (18-15) finished third in the 
West Coast Conference and won their last three matches, all on the road. WCC 
champion Pepperdine and runner-up Gonzaga gained NCAA berths, giving the 
conference three teams in postseason play for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
In the tournament format, teams are broken into four pools, with pool winners 
advancing to Saturday's semifinals. Loyola will open pool play at 11 a.m. 
against Dayton, then meets Memphis State, the top-seeded team in the pool, at 4 
p.m. On Friday the Lions meet Arizona State at 8 a.m. and William and Mary at 1 
p.m. Other top-seeded teams are Houston, Georgia and Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Semifinals are at 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. Saturday, followed by the championship at 
4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
This is the Lions' first postseason appearance since they went to the NCAAs in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
"From the beginning we were told we were supposed to finish seventh or eighth 
(in the WCC) so this is a nice way to end the season," Stratos said. "I'd hoped 
to be really competitive in the conference and shoot for .500 (but) they are 
overachievers. I'm super excited for the girls." ALAN DROOZ.

CSUN LEARNED ABOUT MORE THAN LOSING; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: DESPITE THREE DEFEATS, MATADORS' FIRST DIVISION I MEN'S 
BASKETBALL TRIP WAS MEMORABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THERESA MUNOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The taller Colorado team warmed up in shiny new silver, black and gold suits. 
The ragamuffins from Cal State Northridge wore plain red tops, sans sweat 
pants. 
</P>
<P>
The difference in dress was only the beginning. The Matadors were awe-struck by 
the size of the arenas, the luxury of the locker rooms and the din of the 
crowds on their first Division I trip. 
</P>
<P>
"It is great to go to other schools to see their tradition, their atmosphere 
and their personality," said CSUN assistant coach Wayne Fluker, who played for 
the Matadors from 1983-85 at the Division II level. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys have never played in front of 5,000 or 8,0000 people. That in 
itself is exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Three losses nonwithstanding, it was an exciting and unpredictable trip, from a 
forest fire raging north of Boulder, Colo., to a close encounter with a ram in 
Fort Collins, Colo., to a jet-fuel fire at Denver's Stapleton International 
Airport, to a Las Vegas-style spectacle at New Mexico State complete with 40 
cheerleaders and pompons and a gun-shooting mascot. 
</P>
<P>
After three games in four nights, with losses totaling 107 points, the trip 
refused to end. The Matadors were delayed three hours by the fire and a snow 
storm in Denver that required their plane to be de-iced. 
</P>
<P>
On the court, it started off better. Northridge hit five of its first six 
shots, including three three-point baskets. Junior college transfer Kyle 
Kerlegan made a school record 10 three-point baskets, including three in a 
48-second span. But Colorado answered with an 18-0 run that buried the Matadors 
in a 113-89 loss. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN actually had a chance to win the following night, but each time the 
Matadors crept within striking distance, Colorado State surged further ahead 
with a steal and layup or a three-point basket en route to a 104-79 win. 
</P>
<P>
The final leg of the journey was devastating, a 120-62 loss to New Mexico 
State, ranked 16th nationally by Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
It was a nightmare, but not the worst: In CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy's worst dream 
the Matadors are held scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Cassidy retained his sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
When asked by a Colorado reporter about the Matadors' prospects in conference 
play, Cassidy said: "We'll probably win our conference." 
</P>
<P>
After a pause, Cassidy informed the stunned reporter that the Matadors have no 
conference affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
When asked to expound upon CSUN's chances to get into the Big West Conference, 
Cassidy looked at CSUN guard David Keeter and center Todd Bowser and said: "I 
could go on for 20 minutes but I've got to get these guys to McDonald's." 
</P>
<P>
The press corp laughed, but Cassidy wasn't kidding -- the Golden Arches are 
like a second home to the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy was also a hit with the reporters who cover New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
"Should I stand up or sit down for this firing squad?" Cassidy asked as he 
entered the interview room after CSUN's 58-point loss. 
</P>
<P>
Another source of amusement for the crowds was Bowser, a 6-foot-7, 310-pound 
senior. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State fans hollered for him to pull his Michael Jordan-style pants 
up, Colorado fans remarked that he looks like a 40-year-old, and the Colorado 
State faithful took it to him most. 
</P>
<P>
As Bowser outrebounded all four centers that Colorado State Coach Boyd Grant 
hustled into the game, the crowd grew more and more impatient with its big men. 
Their only recourse was to boo Bowser's futile free-throw attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Each time the hefty Bowser stepped to the line, the Ram-O-Meter, which measures 
crowd noise, nearly rose to the top. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Bowser didn't take it seriously: "Everybody loves to hate me," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowser could not help hearing the crowd, but fortunately he and his teammates 
did not appear to be intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the crowd intimidated them, but distracted them in an amusing 
way," CSUN assistant Tom McCollum said. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado fans started what might become familiar -- a "Go Back to Division II" 
chant. With eight minutes left in the New Mexico State debacle, Aggie fans 
roared: "Warm Up the Bus." 
</P>
<P>
"There's chanting in Division II but it is a lot different to have 7,000 people 
chanting than 700," Fluker said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Fluker, Division I fans are also more sophisticated. "The crowd 
seems to do its homework," he said. "They know the first names of the players. 
As soon as a player walks on the court they say he looks like someone else. Our 
players did a pretty good job of not paying attention." 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors could not help but notice the post-whistle methods of their taller 
and heavier foes. Keith Gibbs stood toe to toe with Tracy Jordan, the Colorado 
State wide body who has two inches and 50 pounds on Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Kilian was shoved by New Mexico State's Michael New, Bowser went to the 
mat -- literally -- with Colorado State's 6-10 center Wagner Manna, and Dave 
Swanson was pushed by the Aggies' Jason Trask and has a black eye to show for 
his encounter with Colorado's 6-10 post, Shaun Vandiver. 
</P>
<P>
"He was nailed, but he walked away," McCollum said. "To me, that was the best 
sign of character on our team." 
</P>
<P>
Another indicator? 
</P>
<P>
As a New Mexico State reporter pointed out, the Matadors never quit, and as 
evidenced by their palm-slapping exchange when they come in and out of games -- 
even when the outcome has been decided -- they are developing a team concept. 
</P>
<P>
"We went to see 'Dances with Wolves' and I saw the same team chemistry that we 
had at CSUN the year we won the conference championship," Fluker said, 
referring to the 1985 California Collegiate Athletic Assn. title. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is hanging together. No one is pointing fingers." 
</P>
<P>
The coaching staff, in fact, is determined to stick to its run-and-gun offense 
and full-court press defense in spite of the losses and the success Colorado 
State and New Mexico State had in slowing the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
"They were ganging up our wings and running up Kyle," McCollum said of the 
Colorado State and New Mexico State players, who had been forewarned about 
Kerlegan. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a fire breaking out. It was a healthy sign that we are potentially 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
With Kerlegan, David Keeter and Swanson, in particular, that is true, but they 
have to get themselves open even when the opposition knows what they want to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
Kerlegan had difficulty adjusting to the defensive pressure and was limited to 
one three-point basket in 12 attempts in the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
"What Kyle has to understand is that the Division I athlete can cover 15 feet 
in a stride," McCollum said. "I don't think Kyle made the adjustment to get 
open." 
</P>
<P>
His teammates will have to adjust too. As the trip wore on and freshmen Martin 
Smith and Andre Chevalier grew more confident, Gibbs was able to move from 
point guard to shooting guard. But he still has not found his shooting touch. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very gifted athlete but he has to learn to pick his spots better," 
McCollum said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, against the Aggies, Gibbs threw a pass away, then blocked the dunk 
attempt by the foe who intercepted his pass. 
</P>
<P>
His leaping ability was further evidenced by the double-pumping dunk he put 
down against Colorado, and he is easily the best passer on the team. Twice, he 
threaded the needle inside with no-look passes. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise among the 10 newcomers is Smith, who is averaging 8.5 
points in a reserve role. In three games, he went from forcing shots against 
Colorado to blocking a shot by the 6-8 New. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the 6-4, 166-pound Smith vowed to hit the weights. Like his 
teammates, his first Division I trip was truly educational.

LIDE ENERGIZES ANTELOPE VALLEY IN TOURNAMENT WIN OVER PALOMAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Skinny as an exclamation point, Antelope Valley College's LeVan Lide plays like 
one too. 
</P>
<P>
A first-round game of the Antelope Valley tournament against winless Palomar 
would have been easy for Antelope Valley to slide through on cruise control, 
but that was not going to happen with Lide at the throttle. 
</P>
<P>
Playing with his own brand of hyperkinetic energy, the 6-foot-1, 150-pound Lide 
had 23 points, nine assists, nine steals and four rebounds to lead Antelope 
Valley to a 99-73 victory Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley Coach Newton Chelette was reluctant to give Lide all of the 
credit for firing up the team but did say: "His aggressive play, somehow it's 
catchy and filters down through the guys on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
With starter Demetrious Phillips on the sidelines because of a sprained right 
ankle, Lide came onto the floor like a shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I was too hyper," Lide said. "Maybe because Demetrious wasn't there. I just 
feel like I have to pick up the scoring slack, pick up defensive slack." 
</P>
<P>
Lide, a mercurial freshman guard out of Las Vegas, combined with fellow guard 
Bryan Wilcox in limiting Palomar's starting guards to four points. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley has not won its own tournament since 1968, and Lide said: 
"You've got to keep the team up. We plan on taking it this year." 
</P>
<P>
After building a surprisingly small 51-37 first-half lead, Antelope Valley 
(4-1) blew the game open with a 17-4 run in the first six minutes of the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Lide combined with Tony Madison on a nine-point Antelope Valley run that 
increased the lead to 82-50 with 10 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
With his team leading, 89-52, with slightly less than eight minutes remaining, 
Chelette cleared the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Several missed layups helped keep Antelope Valley under 100 points. 
</P>
<P>
Madison struggled through a seven-for-23 performance from the field but 
finished with 25 points and five assists. Wilcox, Ennis Wesley, Gerald Haynes 
and Billy Lucas each scored nine points. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley will play Canyons at 7 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Canyons 79, Golden West 70 -- Canyons lost an 18-point second-half lead but 
bounced back to outscore Golden West, 12-3, in the final two minutes and 
preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons (2-2) led, 50-32, after Nick Sanderson hit a three-point basket early 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside 75, Glendale 73 -- A game-ending desperation shot by Glendale's Doug 
Castaneda was off the mark. 
</P>
<P>
Enoch Mack led Glendale (3-3) with 16 points.

DECISION EXPECTED FRIDAY ON RIDER'S ELIGIBILITY APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A decision is expected Friday on basketball standout J. R. Rider's appeal to 
regain his sophomore year of eligibility at Antelope Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
Rider, a 6-foot-5 transfer from Allen County (Kan.) College, was declared 
ineligible for this season early this month when it was determined that he did 
not have the minimum 2.0 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill Conference representatives voted 6 to 1 in Rider's favor and have 
forwarded Rider's appeal to the Southern California Appeals Board of the 
Commission on Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
The three-member appeals board will meet today at El Camino College and is 
scheduled to announce its decision Friday.

Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Tim Bednar, 2nd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 14-10; 2nd in league, 7-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Jodie Kitt (6-foot-3), who averaged 10.5 points and 6.7 
rebounds a game as a sophomore last season, moved to Georgia, but Moorpark has 
benefited from the transfer of two other players. Junior Rob Salone (6-1) 
transferred from Alemany and Marcus James (5-7) moved from Indiana. Salone, a 
junior, played football at Alemany last year but sat out the basketball season. 
"Salone is a good jumper and can post people," Bednar said. "He's a complete 
player, and James has an outside shot." Forward-guard Kim Kira (6-1) and guard 
Ryan Huisenga (5-11) return and forward Lupe Solano (6-1) complete the starting 
five. Bednar plans to employ a full-court zone defense and a spread offense. 
"We will try to pressure people." 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Defending league champion Bishop Diego is the favorite, according to 
Bednar, "But I look at the five guys we have coming off the bench and the five 
basketball players on the court and I think we'll be in the thick of the race." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oak Park 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Nate Sims, 1st season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 8-15; 6th in league, 3-7 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The success of the football team has put hardships on the 
development of the basketball team. Chris Kelly (6-1), Zach Siciliano (6-1) and 
Tarik Smith (6-0) played on the football team, which advanced to the Division 
IX semifinals, and only began practice with the basketball team this week. Dave 
Shaw (5-11) is the lone returnee on a team that features no player taller than 
6-2. Sims calls Damian Delfino (6-0) the best outside shooter, but he said that 
everybody will have to score to make up for the lack of height. "We'll run the 
passing game with strong aggressive motion," Sims said. Joey Ryan (5-10), Eric 
Pryor (5-11) and Mike Chang (5-9) also should play a lot. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "I'd like to say that we should (be either) first or second in 
league," Sims said. "We're going to play a very tough preseason and that should 
help us down the line." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
St. Bonaventure 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Marc Groff, 8th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 9-13; 3rd in league, 4-6 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Youth and inexperience abound on a team that has one senior 
and includes two sophomores and a freshman. Forward Todd Tushla (6-1), the lone 
senior and returning letterman, averaged 7.5 points and 4.5 rebounds in limited 
action last season. Junior Max Romero (6-1) will be the other forward and 
sophomore John McNamara (6-2) will be at center. Juniors Jeff Wright (6-0) and 
Gary Hubbard (6-0) will be at guard. Wright and Tushla are the team's 
three-point shot specialists. Peter Houston (6-0), quarterback for the football 
team, will be given significant playing time off the bench. "We're going to try 
to mix it up and play pressure, full-court man defense," Groff said, "but we're 
going to be controlled and run a set offense." 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: St. Bonaventure has qualified for the playoffs five years in a row and 
Groff believes the team is capable of continuing the streak. "We're a young 
team and virtually inexperienced," he said. "Realistically, we'll be shooting 
for third behind Carpinteria and Bishop Diego."

Santa Clara 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Lou Cvijanovich, 32nd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 28-0; 1st in league, 10-0 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Shon Tarver is gone to UCLA, but Santa Clara should again be 
the class of the league. Two starters on last year's state championship team 
are back, led by junior Chris Cole (6-foot-4), a swingman who plays "all over 
the place," according to Cvijanovich. Also returning is senior forward Anthony 
Maestas (6-2). Cvijanovich has at his disposal a wealth of talented juniors, 
including scheduled starting point guard Art Barone (5-11) and forward Steve 
Amar (6-4). Two other players vying for starting time include junior Isaiah 
Mustafa (6-2) and Evan Swanger (6-2). Yet another junior, post player Pat 
Lampson (6-5) rounds out the rotation for Cvijanovich. Most of the juniors come 
to the varsity from a championship junior-varsity team. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Santa Clara has not lost a league game since 1985 and has won every 
league title since then. On paper, this year does not seem much different. "I 
think it's a helluva league, from what I've seen," Cvijanovich said. But he 
likes the Saints' chances. "As the season progresses, this will be one fine 
ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nordhoff 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Dick Sebek, 16th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 15-9; 2nd in league, 7-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Father will coach son again at the Ojai school, where the 
Rangers' star player is junior Tim Sebek (6-3), a guard-forward who averaged 16 
points and 10 rebounds last year. Sebek was selected All-Ventura County as a 
sophomore. The other returning starter for Nordhoff is junior point guard Kevin 
Cochran (6-0). From there, Sebek will look to new names for starters. Senior 
Craig Bolton (6-0) is a forward who is "real quick and a good athlete", 
according to Sebek. He is also the only senior who will start. From the 
football team comes junior guard Nacho Vega (5-10), who likes to shoot the 
ball. Junior Josh Bridge, a 6-4 transfer from Boston, "fits in real well," 
according to Sebek. Also vying for playing time is freshman Mark Sebek (6-0), 
the coach's son. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Nordhoff was the last team to win a Frontier League title before Santa 
Clara's dominance of the late '80s. Sebek said the teams have had a great 
rivalry and that 1990-91 should be no exception. From rival Cvijanovich: 
"Nordhoff has a real good bunch coming back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Tom Donahue, 1st season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 2-19; 5th in league, 2-8 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Donahue inherits a program filled with winning juniors. 
Leading the way is footballer Joey Ramirez (6-0), a junior guard who can shoot 
well and is a good ballhandler. Joining him in the backcourt is George Aldanese 
(6-1), a left-handed transfer from Santa Barbara who, like Ramirez, is a 
"pretty good shooter." In the middle is 6-8 junior Terry Bell. "He has good 
hands and a nice touch," Donahue said. "His only problem is that he's a little 
slow afoot." Defensive standout Anthony Hernandez (6-2), a senior forward, 
should start. Then, the onslaught of juniors who have won together ever since 
arriving at Santa Paula: forward Charles Hyde (6-3), forward Patrick Villa 
(6-3), point guard Art Marcelo (5-8) and swingman Kevin Crossley (5-11). 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Donahue downplays this year's team, but the league's coaches seem to 
like the Cardinals -- they voted them as preseason favorites to finish second 
to Santa Clara. In truth, they should battle Nordhoff for that honor. Donahue 
likes the idea of turning the program around, citing experience in that vein 
from his coaching days in Pennsylvania. Said Donahue: "I think that's one of my 
fortes in life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fillmore 
</P>
<P>
COACH: John Wilber, 1st season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 11-11; 3rd in Tri-Valley League, 4-6 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Four starters return for Fillmore's jump to the Frontier 
League. Leading the way is returning all-league guard Richard Aguilera (5-10), 
a senior who scored 16.7 points a game last year. He is joined in the backcourt 
by senior Pokey Sanchez (5-10), an outstanding athlete who is the one of the 
team's best defenders. From the football team comes quarterback Art Sosa (5-9), 
a third guard who will push the ball up the court. In the middle there is size 
-- senior center Mike Richardson (6-6) is back after leading the team in 
rebounding last year. Two juniors who will be counted on to contribute are 
forward Rudy Alcantar (6-3), a good jumper who runs the floor and forward Danny 
Ocegueda (6-2), a solid inside player. Also from the football team is 
linebacker-turned-guard Jason Rangel (5-11), who will be counted on to do some 
running off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: In Wilber's first season, he is looking to field a running team. 
"We're going to try to push it up," he said. "We want to take advantage of our 
speed." By Wilber's calculations, Fillmore's first year in the league will be 
marked by a battle with Santa Paula and Nordhoff for second or third place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calabasas 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Bill Bellatty, 1st season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 10-13; 4th in Frontier League, 4-6 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Calabasas will only carry eight players -- a manpower problem 
that also afflicted the football team. But one of the eight is a prize -- 
senior center Greg Waugh (6-8), who is being recruited by small East Coast 
schools and possesses a "nice touch," according to Bellatty. Senior guard Tom 
Hoover (6-3) will shoot the jump shot for the Coyotes and senior point guard 
Jason Young (5-11) will run the three-guard offense. Another senior, 6-foot 
Chuck Sergis, will play the post and will be counted on to help Waugh rebound. 
Joining him in that duty will be senior Nick Carpol (6-0). Junior shooting 
guard Brian Bruskurd (5-11) and point guard Jeff Marin (5-10) will come off the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Calabasas need not worry about the relative strength of its league 
competition entirely: "It's always one of my goals to reach the playoffs," said 
Bellatty, who is returning to the head coaching post after a two-year layoff. 
"And we've reached that already." Bellatty was referring to the new Southern 
Section rule allowing all teams to make the playoffs. But he feels his Coyotes 
have another goal -- to improve on last year's record. "This year we're going 
to pick it up," he said. "We're going to try and run a little bit."

Buckley 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Byrd Milic, 2nd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 11-10; 4th in league, 3-7 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Gone is the team's best player, guard Rod Sailes, who made 
the team at Maryland as a walk-on, according to Milic. Senior Brett Wallette 
(6-foot-1) is expected to fill Sailes' shoes. "He'll play a little point, a 
little forward and probably some at center," Milic said. "He's going to have to 
fill a lot of holes." Wallette averaged 16 points and eight rebounds as a 
junior. Off-guard Andy Biddle (5-10, junior) is the team's best perimeter 
threat. Steve Moon (6-2) was a surprise last season as a freshman and is 
expected to improve. Allen Pouratian (6-1, senior), one of the team's best 
athletes, was a reserve last year at forward and adds experience. Josh Goodley 
(5-10, junior) has the unenviable task of picking up for Sailes at point guard. 
Goodley played on the junior varsity a year ago. Juniors Blayne McMullen (5-11) 
and John May (6-0), also up from the junior varsity, are the team's top 
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Milic said Buckley will have to overachieve. "We averaged 89 points a 
game," he said. "We have to keep running. We have to outhustle and outwork 
other teams, because we're not going to out-height anybody." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campbell Hall 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Joe Jackson, 3rd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 9-14; 6th in league, 1-9 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: The Vikings have a pair of returning starters in Lee Sprague 
(6-2, senior) and Scott Glass (6-6, sophomore). Sprague was an all-league 
selection last season after averaging 15.5 points and five rebounds. Factor in 
highly regarded Alex Lopez, a 6-10 freshman, and Campbell Hall has one of the 
area's tallest front lines. The guard position seems set as well. Austin 
McKellar, a 6-1 sophomore transfer from talent-laden St. Monica High, starts at 
off-guard. C.J. Thompkins, an all-league junior-varsity selection last season 
as a freshman, will run the fast break from his point-guard position. Thompkins 
averaged 22 points and 10 assists a year ago and is a key to the team's title 
hopes. Reserves Sean Wilder (6-4, junior) and Matt Fleming (6-4 senior) each 
lettered last season and provide punch and leadership off the bench. Taylor 
Williams, a 5-10 off-guard, is the team's sixth man. Williams, a junior who 
skipped the past two seasons because of football injuries, did not play 
football this fall and is ready to play, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Expect the Vikings to run the floor more often this season. How that 
will help in the intensely competitive and up-tempo league is uncertain. 
"Playing in the Delphic League, you have to control the tempo," Jackson said. 
"Everybody likes to run and I think we'll be better at that this year." Jackson 
refers to the league as the "Big East," because of its strength from top to 
bottom: League members Faith Baptist and Brentwood advanced to the Southern 
Section 1-A semifinals last season, Crossroads is a perennial postseason threat 
and Bel-Air Prep won the 1-A title in 1989. Jackson said he hopes defenses try 
to key on Lopez inside, which will open the door for Glass, Sprague and 
Thompkins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faith Baptist 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Stuart Mason, 2nd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 21-11; 3rd in league, 7-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Four of five starters return from the Southern Section 1-A 
Division championship team of a year ago, giving the Contenders perhaps their 
strongest team ever. All-Southern Section selection Alex Estrada (5-9) averaged 
19.8 points, 7.4 assists and 3.2 steals last season from his point-guard 
position. Estrada was a Times All-Valley second-team selection. Off-guard 
Darren Wyre (5-10) averaged 11.7 points last season as a sophomore. Forward 
Fernando Garcia (6-3 1/2) averaged 12.8 points and eight rebounds as a junior. 
Peter Rasmussen (6-7), inserted into the starting lineup at center in 
midseason, averaged 13.7 points and 10 rebounds as a sophomore. Laurence 
Kennedy (6-2, senior) was the sixth man last season and fills the remaining 
starting position at forward. James DeCarriere (5-8, sophomore) is the team's 
quickest player and will come off the bench. Reserves probably will play 
sparingly, however. In the Contenders' playoff drive of a season ago, the 
starters did not leave the floor in three consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The Contenders have the talent to offer strong defense of their 1-A 
Division crown. But Mason realizes there was an element of luck involved last 
year. "I'm not saying this out of a false sense of humility," he said. "But 
last year in the playoffs, there were three or four games that could have gone 
either way. I'd like to reach (the championship game) and I'd like to think we 
can. But things need to fall into place again."

Burbank 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Fred Cook, 2nd season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 3-21; 6th in league, 2-8 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Cook believes that the team has prospered from summer league 
-- the Bulldogs went 20-18 -- saying the team is almost two months ahead of 
schedule in relation to last season's team. However, center Tyler Smith 
(6-foot-3) is the only player taller than 6-1. Mike Palaski (5-10), Jon Warner 
(6-0) and Hyung Chun (5-8) are returning starters. Warner will be the primary 
ballhandler and can score from inside and outside. "We're going to spread it 
out and make people come out and guard us," Cook said. "We're all 
interchangeable and everybody can play any position." Burbank might go as deep 
as 10 players in its rotation. Also expected to be part of the rotation are 
Shawn Williams (6-1), Fuzzy Clocki (5-11), David Ranney (5-11), Steve Rutoske 
(6-0), Ken Malous (6-1) and Henry Gandi (5-10). 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "We don't have a power game," Cook said. "We need to force turnovers 
and get help on the boards underneath. Our defense and speed will be the key. 
It'll be an interesting up-tempo game." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Burroughs 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Ira Sollod, 4th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 18-7; 1st in league, 10-0 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Burroughs is the two-time defending Foothill League champion 
but only two players with varsity experience return. Forward Mike Rossiter 
(6-6), who averaged seven points a game, and guard Victor Hernandez (5-11) were 
used sparingly as juniors. Rossiter has developed into one of the team's better 
outside shooters, Sollod said. Chris Suarez (5-7) will join Hernandez in the 
backcourt and Nate Asamere (6-1) and Rick Mulloy (6-5) will fill the remaining 
forward and center positions. Burroughs will emphasize speed to force turnovers 
in an up-tempo game. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Sollod tabs Burroughs, along with Alhambra and Hart, as the favorites 
for the league title. However, the replacement of graduated point guard Marnie 
Calderon, the league MVP last season and a three-year starter, looms as 
Sollod's primary concern. "He ran the show," Sollod said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hart 
</P>
<P>
COACH: Greg Herrick, 4th season 
</P>
<P>
LAST SEASON: 18-8; tied for 2nd in league, 7-3 
</P>
<P>
PLAYERS TO WATCH: Hart made 154 three-point shots last season, but Herrick will 
be emphasizing a different three-point play this season. "We have tremendous 
talent on the front line," Herrick said. "Our focus will be on the inside and 
we will be getting fouled and going to the free-throw line. We're starting a 
new statistical category." Seniors Marty Downen (6-5) and Keith Halcovich (6-5) 
return at forwards with junior Ali Peek (6-4, 230 pounds), the junior varsity 
MVP, at center. As juniors, Downen averaged 12.5 points and 7.5 rebounds and 
Halcovich averaged 8.6 rebounds and 1.4 steals. Senior guards Doug Rich (6-0) 
and Tony Valenzuela (6-2) round out the starting five. Hart averaged more than 
80 points a game last season and Herrick feels that this squad can equal that. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: "Our guards are suspect," Herrick said, "but we have so much talent I 
could play guard and we would still win. Our early schedule is brutal and the 
media will keep us down on their list because of our record, but I think we're 
as good as anyone in the Valley."

BOYS' BASKETBALL: THE LONGHORNS ARE STILL LOOKING FOR A CENTER, HOWEVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The runover of the high school football playoffs always seems to upset the 
early part of the boys' basketball season, and this year is no different. Five 
of the top 10 basketball schools -- Rancho Buena Vista, El Camino, Morse, Chula 
Vista and Kearny -- are still active in the football playoffs as the basketball 
season gets under way this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that a number of key basketball players are football players as well 
illustrates the kind of athletes the county has to offer. There are some 
talented, multi-skilled athletes, though not much height to speak of. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Parker of Rancho Buena Vista is one such player. Parker and a strong 
supporting cast make up The Times' top-ranked preseason team. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor to consider is geographics. The North County has three of the 
top four teams, and the city leagues have five schools represented. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' boys' basketball San Diego Section preseason top 10: 
</P>
<P>
1 RANCHO BUENA VISTA 
</P>
<P>
1990 Record: 15-10 
</P>
<P>
League: Palomar 
</P>
<P>
Coach: John O'Neill 
</P>
<P>
Four starters return and one of them is super-talent Darryl Parker, who was 
being recruited by Georgetown when he signed a national letter of intent with 
UC Santa Barbara. Parker (6-6) can do it all, but the Longhorns lack a true 
center. That doesn't bother O'Neill's outlook on offense, but concerns him 
defensively. Fred Aliipule, who clogged the middle on defense last year, is a 
football player who will spend the winter selecting a university instead of 
playing basketball. Brad Grubaugh (6-4) averaged 19 points last year and is 
joined by junior point guard James VanderVeer (6-0) and Bond Schoeffel (6-4), 
who lacks the flash of his teammates but provides steadiness inside. 
</P>
<P>
2 EL CAMINO 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Record: 23-7 
</P>
<P>
League: Avocado 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Ray Johnson 
</P>
<P>
Starters Shaun Scurry, a 6-5 forward who averaged 14 points per game last 
season, and Jeff Reeves (6-2 guard, 11 points per game), return from last 
year's Division II championship team that lost to Ed O'Bannon and Artesia by 
four points in the Southern California Regional tournament. Also returning is 
5-11 point guard Heath McCoy, who came off the bench to score 14 points against 
Artesia. Johnson said McCoy could become one of the top guards in the county. 
Junior Russell White, a 6-6 center, played sparingly last year, but Johnson 
said he is much improved. Bryant Westbrook, a 6-1 leaper, rounds out the 
starting five. 
</P>
<P>
3 MORSE 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Record: 12-14 
</P>
<P>
League: City Eastern 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Ron Davis 
</P>
<P>
There was nothing spectacular about this team last year, but eight players 
return. The Tigers are experienced and tall. Center/forward Darnell Cherry 
(6-10) started last season and averaged 14.2 points a game. Jamar Lavender, a 
6-5 guard, has started the past two seasons and averaged 12 points and eight 
assists last year. Brothers Gary and Cary Taylor should provide a boost when 
they're finished with football. Morse has a tough schedule, particularly at the 
the beginning. The Tigers open with Crenshaw, the second-ranked team in the 
state, and then play Banning, a highly regarded Los Angeles team. "I'll play 
anybody, anywhere in order to get a good game," Davis said. "I may be the only 
coach in San Diego to go out and try and get the best games. I'm only concerned 
about my record in the end." 
</P>
<P>
4 POWAY 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Record: 18-7 
</P>
<P>
League: Palomar 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Doug Wealch 
</P>
<P>
Key players are back, but the big man on the bench is not. Former coach Neville 
Saner, who won four titles in seven years, resigned after another successful 
season last year. Replaceing Saner is the man he succeeded, Doug Wealch, who 
has a full cupboard, including three returning starters: junior center Kyle 
Milling (6-7), and seniors Bill Rarity (6-3) and Frank Garrett (6-3). Forward 
Matt Fletcher (6-2), last year's three-point specialist, point guard Mark 
Wuchner (5-10), Kirk Hipple (6-5) and five players from a 22-2 junior varsity 
team should make Wealch's transition easier. 
</P>
<P>
5 LINCOLN 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Record: 22-9 
</P>
<P>
League: City Central 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Ron Loneski 
</P>
<P>
Don Ballard, last year's workhorse on the boards, was injured in an auto 
accident and Anthony Miller, a promising transfer from Morse, may be 
unavailable, but Loneski always seems to come up with a strong team with the 
pieces available to him. Berry Randell, a transfer from Crawford, is a rarity 
at Lincoln -- a true basketball player. Loneski always laments the lack of 
basketball players at Lincoln, saying he puts together a team of great athletes 
with few basketball skills. Loneski will be counting on two other transfers, 
Alex Davis and John Akridge, both from Hoover. Lincoln has no returning 
starters. Akridge and Steve Edens are the only seniors. The rest are juniors. 
</P>
<P>
6 UNIVERSITY CITY 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Record: 23-5 
</P>
<P>
League: City Western 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Tom Medigovich 
</P>
<P>
The Centurions will lose a lot of explosiveness and scoring ability with the 
graduation of all-county point guard Anthony Hill as well as Chris Whitehead 
and Jerome Price. But they have 6-5 forward Ray Hooper (19.0) and a talented 
replacement at point in Ian Krebs (6-1). Look for center Elliott Alexander 
(6-5) to blossom. One of University City's strong points last year was depth, 
which should provide a solid starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
7 CHULA VISTA 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Record: 21-8 
</P>
<P>
League: Metro 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Mike Collins 
</P>
<P>
The loss of all-county guard Carnell Penn, who moved to Virginia, will hurt 
Chula Vista, as will graduated starters Derek Chapman, who is playing 
quarterback at Southwestern College, and Trenell Hicks. The Spartans will also 
be without a number of football players for at least a few more days. What is 
Chula Vista doing in the top 10? "We've still got some good talent," Collins 
said. "I like the way we're going to be." Shane Howell, a 6-5 senior, and 
Jermome Green, a 6-2 sophomore, will be counted on most until football players 
Donnie Edwards (6-3), Ken McDuffy (5-9), LaMar Bailey (5-8) and Allan Delos 
Reyes (6-0) are available. 
</P>
<P>
8 KEARNY 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Record: 14-8 
</P>
<P>
League: City Western 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bill Peterson 
</P>
<P>
Some say Kearny had the most talent of any team in the league last year. That's 
saying a lot, considering City Western champion University City reached the 
Division II final. Back are 6-3 forward Darnay Scott, who averaged more than 16 
points and 13 rebounds last year and should be even better, and 6-7 center Mike 
Oviedo. Damion Victor, James Curtis and Derrick Hotchkiss move up from a junior 
varsity squad that lost only one game last season. 
</P>
<P>
9 SAN DIEGO 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Record: 19-5 
</P>
<P>
League: City Central 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Dennis Kane 
</P>
<P>
San Diego will miss the graduated Clark James, but Kane says he will make up 
for the absence by putting several players on the floor who can all score 10 to 
15 points a game. They are 6-5 forward J.R. Greer, a standout as a sophomore, 
who did not play last year; 6-2 guard John McKenna, a 20-point scorer for 
Madison last year; 6-4 forward Mike Watson, who averaged eight points and 10 
rebounds last year as a junior; Marlon Wells, last year's top junior varsity 
player who averaged 18 points; Brian McGowan, a 6-3 transfer from Arizona; 6-2 
guard Marino Bowman, who averaged seven points last season; and Jeff Smith, the 
starting point guard. 
</P>
<P>
10 MT. CARMEL 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 Record: 23-6 
</P>
<P>
League: Palomar 
</P>
<P>
Coach: John Marincovich 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Carmel reached the Division I finals but lost its nucleus, including 
all-county center Shane Knight. Still, two starters return -- point guard Dana 
Pope (6-2), the team's offensive and defensive catalyst, and Ryan Wootton 
(6-4), who showed steady improvement and is the Sundevils' strongest rebounder. 
Bill Landry and Jon Young are also back. Chris Goode (6-5), a transfer from 
Oxnard Channel Islands, and sophomore Scott Schoenwald (6-6) solidify the front 
line. Dan Kirby (6-0) and Andy Shantz (6-3) -- up from the junior varsity with 
Aaron Harmon (6-3) -- and Young are outside scoring threats.

Although they seemed to make a habit in recent years of playing inside the 
Sports Arena come championship time, two of the county's most successful 
programs will have a decidedly different look on the bench in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
The programs are Point Loma and Mt. Carmel high schools. Each won its division 
title last year and has undergone major changes. Coaches Lee Trepanier and 
Peggy Brose are gone. 
</P>
<P>
Trepanier, who has stomach cancer, retired last season after winning the 
Division II title, his sixth section title in seven years. He coached the 
Pointers -- and standout Terri Mann -- to four state championships from 
1984-87. 
</P>
<P>
Brose left Mt. Carmel after winning her second Division I title in three years, 
but her reason for leaving was much more pleasant. She is starting the program 
at Rancho Bernardo High, a new school that doesn't yet have a gym or any 
seniors. But it does have a proven coach. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon Anderson takes over for Trepanier, who still is a presence on the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"He's helping me out a lot," Anderson said. "I'm trying to learn as much as I 
can from him." 
</P>
<P>
There's plenty to learn.

The Times' girls' basketball San Diego Section top 10: 
</P>
<P>
1 MT. CARMEL 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 23-6 
</P>
<P>
League: Palomar 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Tracey Johnson 
</P>
<P>
New coach Tracey Johnson is getting her first chance at a varsity position 
after coaching Mt. Carmel's junior varsity last year. Johnson's burden is 
inheriting a full cupboard and trying to successfully defend the Sundevils' 
Division I title. The key players are back, including Times all-county player 
Vicki de Jesus, who is one of the county's best athletes and averaged 17 points 
per game, and junior center Kris Grazzini (6-2, 10 points, 10 rebounds). Senior 
forward Cyndi Payne (6-0) is the third returning starter. Jennifer Alley (5-9), 
Nicol Nicholas (6-0), Angie Cooper (5-9) and Melissa Durham (5-9) also return 
after contributing to last year's championship team. 
</P>
<P>
2 EL CAJON VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 21-6 
</P>
<P>
League: Grossmont 2-A 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Robert Holm 
</P>
<P>
Leading scorer Debbie Duhany (21 points per game) graduated, but four starters. 
The team has added a transfer who could have a major effect. Back are senior 
guards Julie Woodley (5-4) and Sara Mease (5-4), senior forward Heidi Holm 
(6-0) and her sister, Heather, a 5-11 junior forward. Senior center Tracy 
Wilcox (6-0), a transfer from Paw Paw, Mich, averaged 19 rebounds last year. 
Her aggressive style fit in well with the team in summer league. She is the 
commodity the Braves have lacked. The team also is experienced -- five players 
have been with the varsity for two years. 
</P>
<P>
3 CASTLE PARK 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 19-6 
</P>
<P>
League: Metro 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Chuck Mills 
</P>
<P>
Christina Murguia would be reason enough to rank the Trojans in the top 10. 
Murguia, who signed a national letter of intent with San Diego State earlier 
this month, averaged 29.3 points and 17 rebounds per game last year, leading 
Castle Park to the Division II semifinals. Murguia also was the player of the 
year in the Metro Conference and a Times first team all-county selection. Add 
senior forward Erica Ockert (6-1), junior guard Autumn Bailey -- both returning 
starters -- and sophomore guard Dolores Odom, and the Trojans again have to be 
a Division II favorite. The key loss was point guard Debbie Davis (11.4 points 
per game). 
</P>
<P>
4 SANTANA 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 24-5 
</P>
<P>
League: Grossmont 2-A 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Wade Vickery 
</P>
<P>
Senior point guard Desiree Weimann (5-4) and forward Stephanie Thompson (5-10), 
four-year starters and the nucleus of last year's Division I runner-up team, 
each averaged 18 points per game. Another starter will be junior Erin Pope 
(5-10), up from the junior varsity. Time will be split among the other players, 
senior guard Ana Covarrubias (5-2) and junior guard Dawn Webber (5-2), both 
varsity returnees; 5-8 sophomore forwards Michelle Bass and Teresa Stippey; and 
two guards, sophomore Jenny Yoney (5-4) and freshman Cathy Bass (5-4), 
Michelle's sister. Inexperience might slow the Sultans early this season. 
</P>
<P>
5 POWAY 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 21-5 
</P>
<P>
League: Palomar 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jay Trousdale 
</P>
<P>
Poway, which reached the section semifinals the past two years, returns just 
one starter, 6-0 Allison Brady, who averaged 10 points and six rebounds per 
game. The Titans will be big with sophomore Kristen Carlson (6-4), Kara Berg 
(6-1) and Brady forming a virtual skyline. Returning guard Stephanie Guerena 
should be a factor, but still is recuperating from knee surgery. Guards Jamie 
Shadian, a junior varsity star, and Julie Lunardi have been early surprises. 
Another player to watch is 5-8 senior forward Cynde Gruchala, who played 
varsity as a sophomore but did not participate last year. Gruchala is the 
Titans' best defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
6 FALLBROOK 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 8-18 
</P>
<P>
League: Palomar 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Gerry Port 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Coach Gerry Port said his young team would take its lumps, and he 
was right. Now he gets to see if the Warriors will reap the benefits. They are 
quick and they are experienced, returning eight players, including all five 
starters. Back are Jessica Paris (5-8), Marcia Jeffries (5-6, 9.5 points per 
game), Andrea Strategos (5-10, 7.5 rebounds), Becky Rayburn (5-11, 7.5 
rebounds) and Cherie Jeffries (5-8). Added to the mix is a transfer Michelle 
Henricks (5-7), an all-league guard from Quartz Hill in Lancaster who already 
has emerged as a team leader. 
</P>
<P>
7 GRANITE HILLS 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 12-14 
</P>
<P>
League: Grossmont 3-A 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Len Klingshirn 
</P>
<P>
The addition of point guard Christina Adams, who transfered from Grossmont, 
should give the Eagles a boost. Adams, who recently committed to play at UC 
Irvine next year, led the state last year with a 38.3 scoring average. She also 
set San Diego Section records for most free throws in season (254), most free 
throws in a game (28), most consecutive free throws in a game (28), highest 
career free-throw shooting percentage (71.0), most three-point baskets made in 
a season (100), most three-point baskets in a game (9), and most three-point 
shots attempted in a game (21). You get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
8 POINT LOMA 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 29-4 
</P>
<P>
League: City Eastern 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Shannon Anderson 
</P>
<P>
First-year coach Shannon Anderson's job wasn't made any easier by the 
graduation of Tyeast Brown, Times Player of the Year, who averaged 23.5 points 
and 10.2 rebounds a game. To compensate for this loss, the Division II champion 
Pointers will spread their attack around, taking advantage of the talents of 
forward Jennifer Meeker, guard/forward Stacy Wainwright (12.5 points per game), 
and guard/forward Toi Ethridge, a strong defensive player. Meeker now is 
recovering from a sprained ankle, but is expected back in two or three weeks. 
The Pointers, despite rebuilding, should have plenty of depth and balance. 
</P>
<P>
9 TORREY PINES 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 16-9 
</P>
<P>
League: Palomar 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Ken Baumann 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines has more depth this year than last, but the Falcons lost 6-2 
center Karyn Armstrong (18 points per game, 13 rebounds), a high jumper 
devoting her time to track. Although left without a center and very little 
height, six players who started at one time or another return. Daphne Brownson 
(11 points per game), who has accepted a full scholarship to San Jose State, is 
joined by two other returning seniors, Allison Booth and Allyson Mizoguchi,a 
good defensive player whose shooting touch blossomed over the summer. They, 
along with sophomore three-point shooter Colleen Peck, are from the same mold, 
5-9 guards. 
</P>
<P>
10 MIRA MESA 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 Record: 11-11 
</P>
<P>
League: City Eastern 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Gary Blevins 
</P>
<P>
Forward Tyffanii Evans should be fun to watch. Coach Gary Blevins doesn't think 
there's anyone in the county who has a better vertical leap. A 5-9 forward, 
Evans is a skilled shooter, shot-blocker and, according to Blevins, is "kind of 
like a Point Loma girl." Teaming with Evans is point guard Lani Elegado, a 
three-point shooting specialist who was ineligible much of last season, and 
center Jennifer Miner, a 6-foot sophomore who played on the varsity team as a 
freshman. The players are athletic and compose the best defensive team Blevins 
has had at Mira Mesa.

STUDENTS NOT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT TEAM

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is about noon on Wednesday. Outside the San Diego State library, students 
are wandering back and forth to class, lunch and who-knows-where-else. 
</P>
<P>
How many were planning to wander to Saturday's San Diego State-Miami football 
game at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium? 
</P>
<P>
In an informal, 30-minute poll, seven of 14 people said they were going to the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
A 50% positive response. Way above average. 
</P>
<P>
School officials attribute part of the Aztecs' declining attendance to student 
apathy. The average student attendence at games this season is 2,500. This at a 
school with an enrollment of 34,938 as of last spring's semester. 
</P>
<P>
Miami is ranked third in the nation in the Associated Press poll. The 
Hurricanes are the highest-rated opponent to play the Aztecs in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
We asked three students. All three said yes, they were planning to go. 
</P>
<P>
What was this? Enthusiasm? 
</P>
<P>
Eight consecutive students took care of that. No, no and no, right down the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Clint Lynch, a senior from San Diego, broke the streak. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the games," he said. "I go to all of them." 
</P>
<P>
Clint, our man. What's the deal with the students? Why don't more go to games? 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody gives having other things to do as an excuse," he said. "I think 
there's no attachment to the Aztecs. People are from other parts of California. 
You walk around and see people wearing hats of different teams. There are 
probably as many fans of other colleges as there are SDSU fans." 
</P>
<P>
One man said he wasn't going because he thought the school charged students for 
tickets when the Aztecs played more well-known opponents. Actually, students 
can get one free ticket the week of the game until game day, when it costs them 
$3. One man said he had purchased his ticket five minutes ago. 
</P>
<P>
A few more students said they are going to the game. A few said no. 
</P>
<P>
"No," said Denise Snanoudj, a sophomore from Los Angeles. "There's no school 
spirit. I don't go to any football games. It's not like it is on the East 
Coast." SCOTT MILLER

<P>
And now, a word from our guest analyst for Saturday's San Diego State-Miami 
game: Brigham Young Coach LaVell Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
Who better? BYU defeated then-No. 1 Miami on Sept. 8, 28-21, and SDSU on Sept. 
22, 62-34. The Cougars (10-1) won the Western Athletic Conference and will play 
Texas A&amp;M in the Holiday Bowl Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
So, without further ado . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It surely has the appearance of a high-scoring game," Edwards said Wednesday. 
"I think San Diego State has as good an offense as we've faced all year. 
(Quarterback Dan) McGwire has had an outstanding year, and they have a great 
corps of receivers. 
</P>
<P>
"The key for San Diego State is to move the football and get points on the 
board. But Miami is a very good offensive football team as well." 
</P>
<P>
Will Miami's defense be able to stop SDSU? 
</P>
<P>
"I think the whole key, obviously, is pass protection," Edwards said. "If San 
Diego State can contain Miami's rush, they're going to complete passes and move 
the ball. When we played (Miami), I don't think their (defensive) front was in 
the same category as last year's group." 
</P>
<P>
And now the topper: What about SDSU's maligned defense? What should we expect 
from it? 
</P>
<P>
"A lot depends on how hard they play," Edwards said. "They can't afford to lose 
confidence if something (bad) happens. 
</P>
<P>
"Miami is going to move the football. They do it against everybody. What the 
(SDSU) defense is going to have to do is come up with plays -- interceptions, 
and force punts." 
</P>
<P>
And the winner . . . Edwards didn't have a comment. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU Coach Al Luginbill had a few good words and a few bad ones regarding 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the part of their program I thoroughly respect: I think they play 
games between the lines as well as anybody in college football," Luginbill 
said. "I do not want to be like them (regarding) their antics." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill was referring to Miami's penchant for impromptu dances after plays -- 
particularly by the wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unbelievable," he said. "It's a joke." 
</P>
<P>
Several NFL scouts checked out SDSU's practice Wednesday. One of the NFL's 
representatives was Bill Tobin, vice president of player personnel for the 
Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tobin -- like most scouts -- wouldn't discuss players in detail, he 
had this to say about McGwire: "I sure do like his size. There's no question 
about that. He's well-proportioned." 
</P>
<P>
Tobin planned to view films of McGwire and other SDSU seniors today. He figures 
SDSU is about the 50th school he has visited this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's practice was just the beginning of a long afternoon/night for 
McGwire. After practice, he was interviewed by a crew from ESPN, two local 
television crews and a couple of reporters before joining Luginbill for a trip 
to a Mission Valley restaurant to appear on a radio show. . . . Luginbill said 
he thinks BYU quarterback Ty Detmer should win the Heisman Trophy. "Running 
away," Luginbill said. "It will be embarrassing if anybody else gets it." . . . 
Tight end Ray Rowe -- SDSU's other Rowe -- is having quite a year, having 
caught 16 passes for 243 yards. Last year, SDSU's entire group of tight ends 
caught 16 passes. "That's what we practiced, including the tight end in our 
offense," Rowe said. "It started off pretty good at the beginning of the 
season, slowed down a little in the middle of the season, but it came back. 
It's been better than I figured it was going to be. In (fall camp), we weren't 
getting too many balls in practice. It was like, 'Uh-oh, it's going to be the 
same old stuff again.' " SCOTT MILLER

TRW TO LAY OFF UP TO 300 AT SPACE SECTOR; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: UNTIL NOW, EXPERTS PRESUMED THAT SECRET PROGRAMS WOULD BE LESS 
AFFECTED BY PENTAGON BUDGET CUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TRW said Wednesday that a substantial reduction in funding on some of its 
classified military programs will force it to lay off about 200 to 300 workers 
at its Space &amp; Defense Sector in Redondo Beach, a signal that the 
Pentagon's "black" programs may be under increasing budget pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, many analysts and industry experts had presumed that secret programs 
would be less affected than conventional weapons programs by defense budget 
cuts, since secret programs typically support special military needs or 
intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
But that upbeat assessment is changing. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the tide has shifted and these intelligence and special access 
programs are going to be looked at more closely than they have been in the 
past," said John Pike, director of the space policy project at the Federation 
of American Scientists in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), a member of the Senate Intelligence 
Committee, "has been hollering that we spend too much on satellites," said 
Pike, who estimates that the United States spends about $5 billion annually on 
intelligence satellites. That is more than is spent on tanks, strategic bombers 
or Star Wars. 
</P>
<P>
"The most expensive satellite, a Keyhole, costs about $2 billion, including 
launch costs -- and that's as much as an aircraft carrier," Pike said. "But it 
is a really good satellite." 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed, rather than TRW, produces the Keyhole satellite. 
</P>
<P>
Calabasas-based Lockheed recently consolidated its Sunnyvale operations, which 
does a substantial amount of classified military work. Although the overall 
unit has posted higher sales and profits so far this year, it has had declines 
in "certain space system and defensive missile activities," according to 
Lockheed's third-quarter report. The operation anticipates making some moderate 
job reductions next year, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has 
been a strong champion of satellite programs and fought efforts to cut the 
nation's commitment to them, Pike said. But in a highly charged political 
environment to contain defense spending and with a conflict looming in the 
Middle East, spending on secret programs could be vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Costello, former Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, said in an 
interview that the current Middle East crisis has forced Pentagon officials to 
look closely at expenditures in an effort to increase the direct support of 
U.S. combat forces. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are not going to cut the visible programs like the B-2 bomber, then 
somebody is going to take the (politically) easy route and cut the programs 
nobody can see," Costello, a senior researcher at the Hudson Institute, said. 
"With a constrained budget, it is the logical thing to do, but I think it is 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Costello argues that a conventional arms treaty with the Soviet Union 
will increase rather than reduce the need for strategic reconnaissance systems, 
despite their high cost. "Surveillance activities have to be supported," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland-based TRW said the greatest impact of its layoffs would fall on its 
Space &amp; Technology group, which produces satellites and other advanced 
technology products. The firm said it could give no indication of the type or 
scope of the work being reduced, but that it does not involve any of the firm's 
major unclassified satellite programs, such as the Milstar, Defense Support 
Program or Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System. 
</P>
<P>
Among the firm's classified programs are believed to be a number of electronic 
surveillance and infrared spying satellites, as well as payloads for satellites 
produced by other contractors. 
</P>
<P>
TRW spokeswoman Julie Meier Wright said the company would attempt to find new 
jobs for some of the workers and that the actual layoffs might be somewhat 
smaller than currently estimated. The layoffs will not begin until early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
TRW's Space &amp; Defense Sector has eliminated 1,600 jobs nationally this 
year, including 950 in the Los Angeles area. The firm laid off about 500 of 
those workers; the balance of the jobs were eliminated through attrition. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1987, TRW employed 20,000 workers at its facilities in Redondo 
Beach and San Bernardino. The firm was forced to lay off 1,000 workers in 1987 
when a major secret program was cancelled. It currently employs 15,600 workers 
in the two locations.

Caesars Settlement Is Approved: U.S. District Court in New Jersey approved a 
settlement of lawsuits over Caesars World's $22-per-share offer for the nearly 
2.2 million shares of Caesars New Jersey that the Los Angeles company doesn't 
already own. 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement, Caesars World agreed to pay interest on the offering 
price for shares tendered and to make an additional 25-cent cash payment to 
shareholders whose stock is purchased under the offer, which is set to expire 
Friday. Caesars World also agreed to merge with Caesars New Jersey if it buys 
enough stock to give Caesars World a 90% stake in the New Jersey company. 
Caesars World owns 86.6% of Caesars New Jersey.

NEIL BUSH'S EX-PARTNER HID ASSETS, SUIT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A court-appointed bankruptcy trustee has charged in a lawsuit that former 
Denver developer Bill Walters hid assets from creditors by transferring 
ownership of six automobiles and more than $6 million worth of real estate to 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Walters filed for personal bankruptcy on Nov. 1, saying he had liabilities of 
$279 million. He did not list any assets but told Congress at a hearing earlier 
this year that he had a "negative net worth." 
</P>
<P>
But in a lawsuit filed in federal court in Santa Ana on Friday, bankruptcy 
Trustee R. Neil Rodgers claimed that Jacqueline Walters and attorneys running 
the family trusts had "knowingly and willfully conspired and agreed among 
themselves to devise a common scheme and design to hinder, delay and defraud 
the creditors" of Bill Walters. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Walters, a former business partner of President Bush's son Neil, defaulted 
on about $100 million in loans from Silverado Savings &amp; Loan. Those bad 
loans contributed to the thrift's failure, which is expected to cost taxpayers 
more than $1 billion. 
</P>

While Walters has claimed to be broke, he has continued to live a life of 
luxury. In recent months, he has resided in a $1.9-million Newport Beach home, 
a $1-million desert retreat in Indian Wells and a $250,000 mobile home on 
Laguna Beach. The properties are held in the name of his wife, Jacqueline, or 
in a trust in which she is the sole beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers is asking U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge John Wilson to seize the Southern 
California properties for the benefit of Walters' creditors. 
</P>
<P>
"What is apparent to us is the guy has attempted to make it appear that the 
substantial wealth he has accumulated isn't his," said Ronald Rus, an attorney 
for Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Walters could not be reached for comment Wednesday and his San Diego attorney, 
Nathan E. Jones, did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers' suit claims that Walters either transferred ownership outright to his 
wife or secretly provided funds for the purchase of four properties in 
Colorado, three homes in California and six cars, including a Rolls-Royce and a 
Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Rodgers claims that Walters gave his wife $250,000 to buy a 
Laguna Beach mobile home and provided $2.1 million to the trustees purchasing 
the Newport Beach estate for the trust that lists her as its sole beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
"Said property was transferred by debtor for the sole purpose of deceiving and 
defrauding debtor's creditors," Rodgers claimed in his lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the transfers were made just two days after the couple was married in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
During a brief interview earlier this summer in the couple's Newport Beach home 
-- which features four bedrooms, three baths and a courtyard pool -- Jacqueline 
said the family's assets were hers. "He owns nothing in Orange County," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers has sued Jacqueline Walters and the trustees for conspiracy and 
conveyance of fraudulent transfers, claiming that Bill Walters sometimes 
transferred millions of dollars of his own money to her. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to her marriage to debtor, (Jacqueline) Walters was employed by debtor 
as his secretary," Rodgers claimed in the lawsuit. She "does not have and has 
not had, at all relevant times herein, an independent source of income." 
</P>
<P>
Rus said the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is one of Walters' largest 
creditors because of the Silverado defaults. "We think the FDIC is the largest 
creditor of the estate and so this is to the benefit of the taxpayers," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of Silverado has drawn national attention because Neil Bush was a 
director of the institution. Bush is under investigation on 
conflict-of-interest charges for approving loans to Walters while the two men 
were partners in an oil exploration firm.

FIGHT FOR 'DOLPHIN-SAFE' TUNA FLARES UP AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: GROUPS WILL RENEW PROTESTS AGAINST BUMBLE BEE SEAFOODS. BUT THE 
FIRM SAYS IT DOESN'T BUY FISH CAUGHT IN WAYS THAT HARM THE MAMMALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an angry parting of the ways, several environmental groups that have long 
lobbied for "dolphin-safe" tuna fishing methods plan to renew protests Friday 
against Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The groups claim that Bumble Bee's Thai parent company buys tuna caught in ways 
that harm the marine mammals, contrary to a promise Bumble Bee made last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Bumble Bee is one of three major U.S. tuna packers that announced in April that 
they would switch to buying only tuna caught in dolphin-safe ways. StarKist 
Seafood Co., an affiliate of H. J. Heinz Co., was first to take the pledge and 
was quickly followed by Bumble Bee and Van Kamp Seafood Co.'s Chicken of the 
Sea brand. 
</P>
<P>
The companies' promise extended not only to tuna sold in the United States but 
to international operations as well. Since then, Bumble Bee's cans have been 
labeled "caught with methods 100% safe to dolphins." 
</P>
<P>
But Earth Island Institute, one of the West Coast-based organizations that has 
long campaigned for that switch, says a recent incident capped more than seven 
months of dissatisfaction with Bumble Bee policies. Earth Island says one of 
its members has proof that Bumble Bee's parent company, Unicord Corp., last 
month accepted a shipment of tuna at a port in Thailand that was not 
dolphin-safe. 
</P>
<P>
Bumble Bee executives strongly deny the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Earth Island is a well-intentioned group. But they are making 
statements that are irresponsible, and we take their actions very seriously," 
Mark A. Koob, president and chief operating officer of Bumble Bee, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Other environmental groups involved in the issue -- including Greenpeace and 
the Dolphin Coalition, a Washington-based umbrella group -- said they would 
take no position until they examine Earth Island's evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Earth Island has complained that Bumble Bee, unlike StarKist and Chicken of the 
Sea, refused to immediately end existing contracts with three boats using 
dolphin-endangering catch methods. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a bad start," said David Phillips, executive director of Earth 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
The group also objects to Unicord's admitted practice of buying fish that have 
been caught using small, coastal drift nets. Other environmental groups have 
not yet agreed that this is a dolphin-endangering fishing method and will 
discuss the issue at a Dec. 12 meeting of the Dolphin Coalition, in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Use of nets 1.5 miles in length or less is currently allowed both in United 
Nations marine-resource law and the tuna-can labeling law that was signed by 
President Bush on Wednesday, with strong support from environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"StarKist and Chicken of the Sea have policies of not buying from drift nets, 
period," Phillips noted. 
</P>
<P>
But what seems to have pushed Earth Island to protest -- along with members of 
Friends of Animals, the Sea Shepherd Society and the Dolphin Connection -- is a 
report by Brenda Killian, associate Dolphin Project director at Earth Island. 
</P>
<P>
Killian, inspecting tuna canners in Thailand last month, said she was told by 
officials of Unicord that they had just accepted tuna from a boat named the 
Maya. Killian repoted that other buyers at the port had rejected the catch 
because it was not certified as dolphin-safe. 
</P>
<P>
"She saw a boat called the Maya offloading at a public dock also used by 
Unicord," replied Koob, of Bumble Bee. "The end buyer was Thai Overseas Food 
and Takong Food, Thai companies. Unicord, our parent, has no interest or 
financial support in either of these companies." 
</P>
<P>
"If Phillips has hard and fast evidence that Bumble Bee is cheating, then I 
suggest that the company stop," said Christopher Croft, director of the Dolphin 
Coalition. "That will be what we determine at the Dec. 12th meeting."

USX Chief in No Hurry to Meet Icahn Group: Chairman Charles A. Corry is in no 
hurry to meet with a committee formed by Carl C. Icahn to press the financier's 
case that the company should separate its steel and energy businesses. Two 
professors heading the "USX Shareholders Enhancement Committee" wrote a letter 
to Corry on Nov. 15 requesting that he meet with them to discuss the company's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Corry, in a letter dated Tuesday, requested a detailed agenda of the proposed 
meeting. "I have difficulty understanding the purpose of having a meeting as 
you suggest," Corry said in the letter. "It is difficult to imagine that the 
views and demands of your committee would be any different than those of Mr. 
Icahn." Icahn is USX's largest shareholder with a 13.3% stake.

ARCO UPS STAKE IN STATE'S LARGEST OIL FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Atlantic Richfield Co. will buy a major interest in California's largest oil 
field from Oryx Energy Co. of Dallas for a total of $642 million in cash and 
assumed debt, the companies said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The sale boosts Los Angeles-based Arco's oil production in the state by 60% and 
gives Arco rights to a field with an estimated 140 million barrels of proven 
oil reserves. 
</P>
<P>
It also essentially completes Oryx's plan to sell non-strategic assets in order 
to reduce about $1 billion in debt from the purchase in September of all shares 
of its common stock held by Oryx's founding family. 
</P>
<P>
"Net proceeds from this transaction and previously announced sales amount to 
nearly $700 million," said Oryx Chairman Robert P. Hauptfuhrer in a statement. 
"These funds, coupled with our substantial cash flow from operations, will 
allow us to reach our billion-dollar debt reduction target much sooner than 
planned." 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the deal, which was effective Nov. 1, Arco Oil &amp; Gas Co. 
assumes $54 million in Oryx debt, and pays $588 million in cash for all of 
Oryx's oil properties in the Midway-Sunset oil field in Kern County. The 
interests had constituted Oryx's largest operating U.S. field. 
</P>
<P>
The deal will make Arco, which already has extensive operations in the field, 
its largest producer of oil and boost Arco's gross state oil production to 
79,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
The Oryx interests include 1,270 wells, with gross oil production of more than 
29,000 barrels a day, as well as an interest in a cogeneration plant that 
produces electricity and steam for use in enhanced oil recovery operations. 
</P>
<P>
"This purchase makes good sense for Arco, given that it's a field where we have 
other production with good infrastructure," said Arco spokesman Albert 
Greenstein. "It's a good fit." 
</P>
<P>
The sale was in keeping with Oryx's plans to sell off domestic oil operations 
and change the company's balance of operations to emphasize U.S. natural gas 
production and overseas oil production, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The deal will also result in a net gain of $71 million for Oryx and reduce by 
$545 million Oryx's $968-million debt from its purchase in September of 18 
million shares of stock from Glenmede Trust, which represents the Pew family of 
Philadelphia, founders of Oryx's predecessor, Sun Co. At the time of the stock 
purchase, Oryx vowed to eliminate the debt within a year. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Oryx sold several properties to four companies, including Geodyne 
Resources Inc., for $95 million. The sales included two offshore platforms and 
five non-producing offshore blocks that went to Unocal Corp., said Oryx 
spokesman Tom Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
The month before, Oryx sold $109 million in properties to Union Pacific 
Resources Co. Together, the sales reduced Oryx's debt by $142 million. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Arco's stock closed up 50 cents at $127.875 a share in trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange. Oryx's stock closed down $1 at $43.25 a share on 
the NYSE.

Rumors that major Japanese property developer Shuwa Corp. is in financial 
difficulties shook the Tokyo stock market on Wednesday, reinforcing fears of a 
spate property-related business failures. 
</P>
<P>
"The go-go days for property developers are over for the time being," said Mark 
Brown, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities (Japan). "It's going to get 
worse before it gets better." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of ill-defined problems at Shuwa -- a private company that owns 53 
buildings in Tokyo and 35 buildings overseas -- were a major factor in the 
Tokyo stock market's 569-point fall on Wednesday, a fall of 2.4%, brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
Shuwa has been one of the most aggressive Japanese buyers in the U.S. real 
estate market. It owns the massive Arco Plaza complex and the Southern 
California Gas Co. Building in downtown Los Angeles. The firm also owns 
properties in Century City, Orange County and other parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
In Mid-town New York, Shuwa owns the former ABC Television skyscraper and 
Mellon Financial Center. 
</P>
<P>
The brokers said Shuwa had been an aggressive market player and had used up a 
great deal of money buying stakes in six Japanese retail firms. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Shuwa were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Shuwa rumors have surfaced several times this year, but industry analysts 
said it was only one of many property firms being squeezed by higher interest 
rates and falling real estate prices. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Kyowa, a builder heavily involved in real estate and golf course 
development, filed an application with Tokyo District Court to work out a plan 
to settle about $1.17 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of companies having financial difficulties, it's just beginning," 
said Daniel Nielsen, industry analyst at SBCI Securities (Asia). 
</P>
<P>
Kyowa is one of many firms that jumped into property when Japanese land prices 
started soaring in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
But a combination of declines in land prices and higher mortgage rates are 
starting to choke real estate firms. New Ministry of Finance guidelines on real 
estate lending have been key in the change from boom to bust. 
</P>
<P>
Property firms have gone searching for funds -- first to banks, then to 
non-bank lending institutions, to the overseas branches of Japanese banks and 
to foreign banks, analysts said. "Right now they're basically running out of 
oxygen," Nielsen said. 
</P>
<P>
The number of real estate firms that went bankrupt up to October this year was 
225, compared to 262 in all of 1989, according to Teikoku Data Bank, a private 
credit firm. 
</P>
<P>
Accurate land price figures are notoriously hard to come by, but analysts say 
contract rates for condominiums are a good indicator of the state of the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo in October, only 60.1% of the units put on the market were sold, 
according to the private Real Estate Economy Institute Co. 
</P>
<P>
It said the figure had fallen steadily since June and was now near the 
five-year low of 58.3% in January, 1986, compared to a record high 98% in June, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Small- and medium-sized property companies appear to be facing the worst 
crunch, but there is concern that some of the major companies may be drawn in. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said focus was shifting to the many property firms that have listed on 
Tokyo's over-the-counter market in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Companies with a major bank backing may be able to survive, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are expectations of a steady stream, but no panic wave, of 
bankruptcies," Nielsen said. "The property market is in for a long haul."

HELIONETICS CLOSES GOVERNMENT-SUSPENDED XCELL UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Helionetics Inc., the computer and military products company, has shut down an 
Anaheim subsidiary that was suspended from doing business with the federal 
government earlier this year, according to a company filing with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Xcell Circuit Technology, the Helionetics subsidiary formerly known as 
Calprotech, was suspended indefinitely from doing business with the government 
because it had tried to sell flawed printed circuit boards to Defense 
Electronics Supply Center in Akron, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Helionetics said in the SEC filing that it believed the suspension was an 
error, but it said its appeals to lift the suspension failed. Helionetics 
officials did not return calls for comment on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Logistics Agency, which monitors defense contracts for the 
government, also suspended former Calprotech President David Ross and six other 
former employees from doing business with the government in May. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Ross was sentenced in federal court in Los Angeles to three years in 
prison for falsifying safety tests on parts installed in military equipment, 
including the MX missile. He was also fined $25,000, and Calprotech was fined 
$1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Calprotech changed its name to Xcell in June, 1988, after charges surfaced 
about the flawed circuit boards. Helionetics acquired Xcell for an undisclosed 
price in June, 1989, only three months after Bernard B. Katz purchased 
Helionetics in bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
According to a statement filed with the SEC, Helionetics closed down Xcell on 
Nov. 6 and took a charge of $803,000 related to disposing of the operation. For 
the third quarter ended Sept. 30, the Xcell unit reported a loss of $372,000 on 
revenue of $168,000, compared to a loss of $174,000 on revenue of $410,000 a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
For the quarter, Helionetics reported a net loss of $1.6 million on revenue of 
$2.2 million, contrasted with net income of $250,000 on revenue of $5.4 
million. The company attributed the revenue decline to delays in product 
shipments and higher product costs due to lower volume. 
</P>
<P>
Helionetics also reported a shortage of working capital because a major 
customer in Brazil, Marketta International Corp., has delayed a $2.7-million 
payment for Helionetics' services. The company said there is no assurance it 
will receive the payment from Marketta. 
</P>
<P>
The company also revealed in its SEC filing that at least four lawsuits seeking 
more than $2 million from the company have been filed against the company. They 
do not include a suit filed recently by a shareholder of Definicon alleging 
that Helionetics undervalued Definicon International Corp. when it acquired the 
maker of upgrade kits that convert personal computers into workstations. The 
suit seeks $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Helionetics said it is attempting to settle the suits but there is no assurance 
it will resolve them favorably.

JUDGE ASKS LAWYERS TO TOTAL FRAUD LOSSES IN MILKEN CASE 
</P>

<P>
A federal judge Wednesday asked lawyers for the government and Michael Milken 
to calculate the total amount of fraud in Milken's crimes to help authorities 
determine how much prison time he must serve. 
</P>
<P>
Federal parole officials need an estimate to recommend when Milken will be 
eligible for parole, and the number could affect the length of incarceration by 
more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood last week sentenced the former Drexel Burnham 
Lambert Inc. financier to 10 years in prison for six felony counts related to 
illegal securities trading. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing in Manhattan federal court Wednesday, Wood said that because of 
the nature of Milken's crimes it was not easy to calculate losses to victims. 
She said the parole commission "never had anything like this in mind." 
</P>
<P>
While the parole commission makes its own calculation on such losses, Wood said 
she wants to present officials with a number agreeable to both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Under parole guidelines, a first offender such as Milken would face a minimum 
prison term of 24 months to 36 months if victims' losses ranged from $200,000 
to $1 million. If the fraud exceeds $1 million, Milken's recommended prison 
term before parole would equal 40 months to 52 months. But the parole 
commission is not bound by the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Milken attorney Arthur L. Liman said at the hearing that he believed the amount 
would not exceed $1 million. Wood scheduled a Dec. 6 hearing on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
As part of his plea deal, Milken agreed to pay $200 million in criminal fines 
and penalties and place $400 million into a fund to compensate investors hurt 
by his crimes. But that figure does not constitute an estimate of losses. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's lawyers have 10 days from the date the sentence judgment was entered 
formally in U.S. District Court to appeal the 10-year term. Court officials 
said the sentence judgment was to occur Wednesday, after Wood allocated $1.5 
million as a criminal fine and the remainder of the $200 million as a penalty, 
completing details of the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Liman declined to comment on a published report Wednesday that he planned to 
appeal the sentence.

WITH U.S. SALES SLUMPING, TOY MAKERS LOOK ABROAD

With an uncertain Christmas season under way, toy company executives said 
Wednesday that they are looking for more business opportunities overseas to 
offset the sluggish U.S. retail market. 
</P>
<P>
"The outlook in international markets is brighter," John W. Amerman, chief 
executive of El Segundo-based Mattel Inc., said at a toy industry conference 
sponsored by the investment firm Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Executives generally agreed that their industry will feel pressure from the 
sagging U.S. economy during the holiday season although strong products should 
continue to sell well. Toy sales have slipped along with sales of other 
merchandise as consumers, uncertain about the economy and the Middle East, 
curtailed their spending in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a mixed question," said Alan Hassenfeld, chief executive of Hasbro 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
While Pawtucket, R.I.-based Hasbro expects a healthy performance from its 
Cabbage Patch dolls and Milton Bradley board games, "it might not be a buoyant 
Christmas season," Hassenfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the U.S. toy industry has seen slow growth in recent years, rising 
from a $12.4-billion market in 1986 to $13.4 billion last year, according to 
estimates from the Toy Manufacturers of America, a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the figure is expected to climb to $14 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Those totals do not include video games, which were hot-selling items during 
the 1980s. Nintendo of America Inc. projects that the company and its licensees 
will sell about $4 billion worth of video game products this year. 
</P>
<P>
But even Nintendo, which dominates the U.S. video game market, expects to see a 
drop in sales of its hardware systems this year. The company does project 
strong growth in its software game cartridges. 
</P>
<P>
"Rumors of our demise continue to be premature," Peter T. Main, vice president 
of marketing for Nintendo, said in prepared remarks at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Main said that as the market for his company's products matures, "software will 
continue to be the critical ingredient." 
</P>
<P>
Hassenfeld said a maturing video game market is a positive sign for makers of 
board games, such as Milton Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Another encouraging trend is the growth in international sales, he said. 
Hasbro, which does about one-third of its business abroad, expects 
international sales to increase by more than 30% this year.

SUIT CLAIMS BIAS IN BUILDING MORATORIUM; 
</P>

HOUSING: ACTIVISTS SUE LONG BEACH, IN PART TO RESTRAIN COUNCILMAN WALLACE 
EDGERTON FOR REMARKS LINKING POOR PEOPLE WITH CRIME.

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Housing activists have filed a lawsuit against the city claiming that a recent 
moratorium on development in the waterfront district discriminates against the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Action Assn. claims in a suit filed Monday in Los Angeles 
Superior Court that the moratorium is illegal because it runs counter to the 
city's own policy document, the General Plan, which calls for the development 
of high-density housing along the city's major thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
"The city wants to separate Long Beach into bastions of the upper-middle-class 
and gate the poor into ghettos," said Carla Biersdorff, a plaintiff in the 
suit. Biersdorff, a telephone repair worker who earns $35,000 a year, said the 
only place in Long Beach where she could afford to buy a home recently was 
North Long Beach. "If I can barely afford affordable housing, who can?" she 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium under attack was passed Aug. 28 and bans construction of 
buildings over 25 feet high (two stories) along major arteries in the city's 
2nd Council District, including Broadway, 4th, 7th and 10th streets. 
</P>
<P>
The General Plan developed a year ago calls for the city to concentrate 
multistory housing along such thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
But increasing numbers of residents and a few councilmen, most notably 2nd 
District Councilman Wallace Edgerton, say that mostly poor people have moved 
into such developments, resulting in crime and congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Edgerton said his constituents would be enraged if the lawsuit succeeds in 
lifting the freeze on development in their neighborhoods. "You can't continue 
to jam in a lot of poverty people and people who are on government subsidies. 
They are overburdening our police and school systems and increasing crime 
dramatically," Edgerton said. "Working people will move out and the property 
values of this city will be destroyed if we let Long Beach become the capital 
of poverty." 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs said they sued the city in part because of such remarks, fearing 
they are evidence of a citywide backlash against the poor. Poor planning, not 
poor people, are responsible for the city's crime and social problems, they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to let anybody get by with using the poor for a scapegoat. The 
poor didn't make city policy," said Dennis Rockway, a lawyer with Legal Aid who 
helped write the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Rockway said, one of the association's objectives is to muzzle 
Edgerton, who at meetings of the City Council has repeatedly attacked "poverty 
people" for the city's crime. "He's trying to create apartheid right here in 
Long Beach," Rockway said. "He's appealing to the bigotry in people." 
</P>
<P>
Edgerton said: "I will keep speaking out. All I'm trying to do is reflect what 
our community wants. I have taught politics for years. I donate to the poor. 
The point is, when you continue to lower the economic status of your city and 
put more and more welfare and poverty people in your city, and do more and more 
to attract the homeless, you will damage the economic viability of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Local officials are squeezed in a political vise by pressure from anti-growth 
residents and in this instance an unusual alliance between housing advocates 
and developers. In fact, several officials said this week that they had been 
braced for a legal challenge to the moratorium, but from other quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised. I had been told a developer was going to sue the city," 
Planning Director Robert Paternoster said when informed of the recent lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Other city officials said they did not wish to comment in detail on the lawsuit 
until they had a chance to read it. 
</P>
<P>
Paternoster said, however, that city policy is constantly being updated. It is 
true that the city can not pass laws that contradict its own General Plan, he 
said. But "the moratorium is not a permanent land-use decision. It is putting 
things on hold while you decide something. It is perfectly reasonable to have a 
moratorium while you restudy the General Plan," Paternoster said. 
</P>
<P>
After approving the moratorium in August, the City Council asked the Planning 
Commission to reconsider that part of the General Plan providing for the 
development of high-density housing along the city's major roads. The 
commission is still studying the matter. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent joint meeting between the City Council and the Planning 
Commission, Tony Tortorice, a planning commissioner, argued with Edgerton over 
these issues. Tortorice said he almost welcomes the lawsuit. It will force the 
city to confront what he calls a "strong political current to exclude poor 
people from Long Beach," he said. That current, Tortorice said, has recently 
led to several moratoriums like the one in the 2nd District on construction of 
the kinds of buildings poor people live in. 
</P>
<P>
"Adopting moratoriums has become our de facto way of making policy," he said. 
"Land use has become a hammer and now everything looks like a nail. If this 
procedure can't be examined politically, maybe we'll have to examine it in the 
courts."

HOMELESS AGAIN AFTER FIRE GUTS A HOMEY HOTEL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The holiday season at the Mayfair Hotel started with a bountiful Thanksgiving 
feast, but now the low-income residents are facing a bleak Christmas in the 
aftermath of a fire that left them homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The downtown Pomona hotel -- the only one in the area that accepts emergency 
housing vouchers from the county -- has been closed indefinitely after a fire 
in the hotel basement Friday night sent residents fleeing into the street. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, more than 30 residents of the 60-room hotel have been unable to 
find another affordable place to stay and have been sleeping every night in an 
emergency shelter set up by the Pomona Valley Chapter of the American Red 
Cross. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what we're going to do," said Rose Johnson, who had moved into 
the hotel a few weeks ago with her husband, Kermith, and 10-year-old daughter 
Shadona. "The whole thing is, we need a place to live. Without a place to live, 
you can't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
Kermith, 38, an appliance technician who has been unable to find steady 
employment, said he thought things were looking up when he moved into the 
Mayfair with his wife and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
At $100 a week, the room was affordable, he said, and the atmosphere was 
friendly. Sylvia Hernandez, who managed the hotel and lived there with her six 
children, cooked a Thanksgiving feast that included six turkeys and invited 
everyone to dinner in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said: "I enjoyed this Thanksgiving more than I enjoyed any Thanksgiving 
in the last five or six years." 
</P>
<P>
But about 11:45 the next night, hotel employees saw smoke curling up from the 
basement, called the Fire Department and ran through the halls, pounding on 
doors. Everyone managed to get out safely. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Ed Uehling said the fire, which caused an estimated $400,000 damage, 
apparently started because of an electrical malfunction and spread from the 
basement to a restaurant on the first floor. In the hotel, which occupies the 
second through fifth floors, firefighters knocked in doors, ceilings and walls 
while battling the blaze, and there was extensive smoke damage. 
</P>
<P>
Uehling said he hopes to repair and reopen the hotel, but is waiting for the 
city to assess the structure and tell him what he is legally permitted to do. 
</P>
<P>
The building also housed a cocktail lounge, dentist's office and barbershop, 
all closed because of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
The Mayfair was "state of the art" when it opened, Uehling said, but that was 
in 1915. The building was constructed by a former Pomona postmaster, Walter 
Moore Avis, and opened as the Avis Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel declined over the years, but was remodeled at least twice and was 
providing low-cost housing for the working poor and those on government 
assistance. About half the rooms, Uehling said, were occupied by residents 
placed there by a county program to help the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Hernandez, director of the Pomona office of the county Public Social 
Services Department, said the Mayfair was the only hotel in the Pomona area 
participating in the county voucher program, which provides shelter, a week at 
a time, for homeless persons while they try to obtain permanent residences and 
seek other assistance or jobs. The Mayfair rented rooms to the county for $16 a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said that since there is no other hotel available in the Pomona area, 
residents who were living at the Mayfair at county expense will be offered 
rooms at hotels in downtown Los Angeles that have rates of $13.50 and $14 a 
night. "We'll also provide transportation there," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
But, Hernandez conceded, that may not be an attractive offer for those who have 
ties to the Pomona area. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kirven, Red Cross disaster chairman, said many of those displaced by the 
fire are trying to find nearby accommodations on their own. A number of them 
have jobs, but not many can afford the first and last month's rent needed to 
move into even the cheapest apartments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross opened an emergency shelter at the Pomona Valley YMCA on the 
night of the fire. The next day, the shelter was moved to the gymnasium at the 
Pomona First Baptist Church to take advantage of kitchen facilities. The Red 
Cross has been providing breakfast and dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Kirven said the Red Cross intends to keep the shelter open until residents find 
other accommodations, and is trying to provide additional assistance with the 
initial rent to help people get re-established. But, he said, the expense is 
draining the Pomona Valley chapter's budget for disaster services, and money 
donations are being solicited. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Gonzalez, 29, a cosmetology student, said she and a roommate had been at 
the Mayfair for four months, ever since they lost $1,500 to a man they say 
posed as the owner of a rental house in Fontana. They moved into the house and 
then were evicted by the real owner, they said, leaving them without the money 
to rent an apartment. So they came to the Mayfair. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said they found residents of the Mayfair eager to help each other. 
"You'd walk up the stairs, and neighbors' doors would be open. You'd talk to 
each other. It was like a family." 
</P>
<P>
Judi Jones, a retired teacher who had lived at the Mayfair for five years, said 
she always kept a pot of chili in her room to feed anyone in need of a meal. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a very bad back and emphysema," she said, "and six or seven people 
would go to the market for me. They all helped me, but I helped them too. . . . 
It just breaks my heart to lose my home. I just don't know what I'm going to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Bobby (Bean) Hardin, 43, said, "It's kind of like breaking up with the family. 
We're not related, but we're related in friendship." 
</P>
<P>
Ten-year-old Shadona Johnson said she is grateful for the emergency help her 
family has received but she's worried about the future. "I want to thank all 
the Red Crosses," she said. "They did good for us when we was down. They fed 
us. They put a roof over our heads. (But) the biggest Christmas present I could 
have right now is a home." 
</P>
<P>
HOW TO HELP The Pomona Valley Chapter of the American Red Cross is soliciting 
financial donations to help replenish its disaster services fund, which has 
been depleted by its assistance to residents displaced by the Mayfair Hotel 
fire. The chapter's address is 675 N. Park Ave., Pomona 91766. The phone number 
is (714) 622-1348.

SETTLEMENT IN COUNCILMAN'S SUIT APPROVED; 
</P>
<P>
IRWINDALE: THE CITY WILL PAY LEGAL COSTS IN THE PACT, BUT IT IS AGREED THAT 
PATRICIO MIRANDA DID NOT KNOWINGLY VIOLATE LAWS IN A PROPERTY LEASE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 18 months of fractious dispute and nearly $400,000 in legal bills, the 
City Council has approved an out-of-court settlement of a conflict-of-interest 
lawsuit that has dogged longtime Councilman Patricio Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement states that Miranda did not knowingly violate 
conflict-of-interest laws when he leased property to Irwindale Associates, a 
development company. The company, operating under the name Hopkins Development, 
had several projects pending before Miranda and the rest of the city's 
Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the suit, which was filed by resident and longtime Miranda 
critic Brenda Marin, Miranda denied knowing the two companies were the same. 
"If there's anything I know, it's that I didn't know," he said after the 
settlement was approved Nov. 21 by a vote of 3 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement, the city will pay for Marin's legal costs, which totaled 
$76,964. Marin also agreed to drop the suit against Miranda, who in turn 
dropped a cross-complaint he filed against former city redevelopment consultant 
Fred Lyte, charging that Lyte had conspired to conceal the Hopkins connection 
from him. 
</P>
<P>
However, in acknowledgment that the lease was in technical violation of state 
conflict-of-interest laws, Miranda will donate $2,500 to the city's scholarship 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
Lyte also will contribute $2,500 to the fund. "I had two choices: One was to go 
along with the settlement, or I could spend another $100,000 fighting this 
lawsuit," he said, denying any wrongdoing. "It was not an admission of anything 
-- it's just a practical matter." 
</P>
<P>
Marin told the council that she had opted to settle because she was "trying to 
act in the best interests of the city." A trial could drag on for years, she 
said, but with the agreement, "I'm getting what I wanted. He's admitting that 
he did something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, with its large price tag, comes at a time when the council is 
trying to cut the city's legal costs, which have surpassed the million-dollar 
mark within the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Charles Martin, who said the case cost about $400,000 in legal fees, 
was unable to provide details of specific payments to private attorneys who 
represented Miranda at city expense.

HOSPITAL BEGINS RECYCLING OF NON-INFECTIOUS WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Memorial Medical Center of Long Beach began a hospital-wide recycling program 
Wednesday with the planting of a sycamore tree in the center's front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials say the program will make the 998-bed hospital the biggest 
medical recycler on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital sends 36 tons of non-infectious waste to landfills each week. 
Hospital officials hope they can cut this figure by one-fourth and recycle 9 
tons a week. 
</P>
<P>
Employees are being asked to toss copy and computer paper and cardboard into 
recycling containers near computers, and plastic foam products, glass and 
aluminum into separate barrels placed in cafeterias. The hospital by law must 
continue to haul all infectious waste to landfills.

BOB HOPE LATE FOR EVENT ON SHIP BUT TIMELY WITH JOKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Hope was 90 minutes late for mess aboard the Peleliu but still found time 
to joke with his Navy honor guard. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thrilled just to find this place," the comedian said Tuesday night after 
finally boarding the amphibious assault ship for a dinner saluting his 50 years 
of volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
Hope and his wife, Dolores, were caught in a traffic jam and then could not 
immediately find the ship when they arrived at the Long Beach Naval Station 
</P>
<P>
"You're my honor platoon, huh? Let's go into Long Beach and find the hot spots, 
guys," the 87-year-old entertainer said. 
</P>
<P>
Hope received the National Volunteer Center's George W. Romney Citizen 
Volunteer Award for his many years of entertaining U.S. troops abroad. The 
award is named after the former Michigan governor. The center coordinates 
services by 800,000 volunteers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, Hope entertained Leathernecks of the 1st Marine Division 
before the battle for the island of Peleliu.

The City Council on Monday unanimously approved a three-year contract with 
Community Transit Services Inc. to continue its shuttle service to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The service began in April, 1988, transporting riders from Eastland Center mall 
and Restaurant Row to Fashion Plaza and the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the route was adjusted to include the Queen of the Valley Hospital 
area. It increased ridership from 4,500 to 7,000 monthly. 
</P>
<P>
Total cost of the new contract is $1,169,562, which will come from Proposition 
A funds, the half-cent sales tax earmarked for local transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The new contract takes effect in July, but the old one expires in April. In 
order to continue uninterrupted shuttle service, the council voted to 
appropriate $100,000 to fund the service in the interim.

SUBDIVISION APPEAL DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Time finally ran out Tuesday for a proposed subdivision on Edwards Avenue south 
of Garvey Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council upheld the Planning Commission's May 21 ruling against the 
eight-home project, despite testimony from neighbors. The neighbors said the 
project would bring improvements to an area plagued by drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Fun S. Psang had appealed the Planning Commission ruling and proposed 
widening Edwards Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
In rejecting the proposal last May, the commission said Edwards, a short 
private road, was unsuitable for a project of that density. City Planning 
Director Harold Johanson said Tuesday that although Psang's changes improved 
the project, additional study of the proposal was needed.

BEST BET

<TEXT>
<P>
It may still be too early to decorate your own Christmas tree, but you can plug 
into a large dose of holiday spirit this weekend if you head to Altadena and 
help string electric lights on the 105-year-old deodar trees that line 
Christmas Tree Lane. 
</P>
<P>
The mile-long section of Santa Rosa Avenue has been known as Christmas Tree 
Lane since the early 1920s, when Pasadena department store owner F. C. Nash 
first lit the more than 100 evergreens lining the residential street. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-foot strings of lights are hauled up into the 90-foot trees by a pulley 
system and each tree has its own electrical power box, said Bill Caulfield, who 
has lived on Santa Rosa for 34 years and is a past president of the Christmas 
Tree Lane Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers spend about six Saturdays working the pulleys, placing the light 
strings and putting in the colored bulbs that illuminate the towering trees for 
two weeks during the Christmas season, Caulfield said. "It used to be that the 
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers would send 75 or 100 men out on a Saturday 
and they'd get the whole job done in 
</P>
<P>
one day," Caulfield said, "but those days are gone." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the project could not be completed without hundreds of volunteers. It is 
financed by the nonprofit association with an annual budget of about $1,500, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates have been made that more than 100,000 carloads of people drive 
through the lane each year to marvel at the towering deodars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
So, if you want to stock up on some goodwill and holiday cheer, go up to Santa 
Rosa between Woodbury Road and Altadena Drive on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 2:30 
p.m. to get in on the decorating fun. 
</P>
<P>
The trees, which this year have been designated a California Historic Landmark 
and placed on the National Register of Historic Places, will be lighted in a 
ceremony on Dec. 14 at 6 p.m. and will be lit through New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers should look for the yellow flag on Santa Rosa, where the work will 
be going on. Adults and older children, junior high school age and up, are 
welcome. Lunch will be served. KAREN E. KLEIN

REPAIRS FOR DEAD OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials are going ahead with plans to make about $3,000 in repairs to a 
home although the owner is dead. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council Tuesday voted 3 to 0 to solicit bids for the work on Helen 
Wetherbee's home because she had complied with all the other requirements of 
the city's "Handyman Program." 
</P>
<P>
Wetherbee died a week ago, a program official told the council. "They wanted to 
just be sure this thing got fixed once and for all," City Manager Frank Tripepi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The repairs include repairing a patio roof and relocating a rain gutter, 
Tripepi said. 
</P>
<P>
Wetherbee applied about six weeks ago for assistance from the program, which 
uses community block grant funds to provide home improvements for senior 
citizens and handicapped residents who are financially or physically unable to 
make the repairs.

MORATORIUM EXTENDED UNTIL ZONING CODE IS REVISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A moratorium limiting high-density developments such as multiunit apartments 
has been extended in Bell Gardens until the City Council takes action on a 
controversial plan to rezone the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted to extend the moratorium for about 10 months to ensure that 
developers do not build homes, apartments and businesses in areas of town where 
future rezoning will prohibit such construction. 
</P>
<P>
The council initially passed the moratorium in October after being deluged with 
plans from developers who feared that the zoning changes would be adopted and 
their plans scrapped. Last month, despite protests from residents and business 
people, the Planning Commission gave its unanimous approval to the revised 
zoning code. The plan now must go before the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
If adopted by the council, about 3,000 properties would be rezoned in an 
attempt to reduce density in the city and establish uniform commercial, 
residential and industrial districts. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents protested extension of the moratorium, describing the council's 
move as a stall tactic. They urged the council to make a decision immediately 
on the zoning change, and have warned that they plan to seek a referendum to 
overturn any sweeping zoning changes approved by the council. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't think that by dragging this out, you can wait us out," said Bell Gardens 
resident Stanley Wantuch. 
</P>
<P>
The council is expected to vote on the proposed zoning code early next year.

HOME BUILDING RULES TO CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

MONTEREY PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council, dominated by three new members sympathetic to development, on 
Monday rejected a proposal to block construction of oversized homes and 
signaled it would favor a less stringent measure. 
</P>
<P>
Three new council members who voted to reject the so-called "mansionization" 
ordinance -- Fred Balderrama, Samuel Kiang, and Marie T. Purvis -- said it was 
too restrictive and unfairly punished property owners trying to build 
decent-sized homes. 
</P>
<P>
They said, however, they are willing to pass a scaled-down version of the law 
that would restrict the floor area of houses only in projects of four houses or 
fewer. 
</P>
<P>
The new version waives floor area requirements for large, new projects -- 
including the controversial Monterey Views development. During the past few 
months, council members have clashed over application of the proposed law to 
Monterey Views, 86 single-family homes proposed to be built on the city's 
largest chunk of vacant land. 
</P>
<P>
"People have a right to build on their property," Purvis said before asking 
City Atty. Anthony Canzoneri to scale down the ordinance. The action, hailed by 
developers who attended the council meeting, marks a departure from previous 
years, when councils controlled by slow-growth activists took drastic measures 
to curb development in the city -- including building moratoriums and stricter 
rules governing commercial areas. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Judy Chu and Councilwoman Betty Couch voted in favor of the original 
ordinance Monday. After it failed to pass, however, they agreed to support the 
more lenient version. 
</P>
<P>
Couch -- a slow-growth advocate who has voted in the minority on development 
issues since the new council took office in April -- said Monterey Park no 
longer is on the cutting edge of controlling development in the San Gabriel 
Valley. Other cities -- including Alhambra, Arcadia and San Gabriel -- already 
have strict laws to curb construction of bulky, oversized homes. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a leader before, and other cities followed," Couch said. "It's not 
that way anymore. Now (the new council members) want to make everybody happy." 
</P>
<P>
The revised ordinance, to be considered at the council's next meeting on Dec. 
10, would: 
</P>
<P>
* Limit the amount of ground a house can cover. Houses on lots of less than 
6,000 square feet can cover 50% of the lot; houses on lots between 6,000 and 
10,000 square feet can cover 40% of the lot or 3,000 square feet, whichever is 
greater; houses on lots greater than 10,000 square feet can only cover 35% of 
the lot or 4,000 square feet, whichever is greater 
</P>
<P>
* Require three-car garages for all new houses of more than 3,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
* Ban external staircases to cut down on illegal rental units in single family 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
The original ordinance, which was rejected Monday, would have applied to all 
new construction. It also would have tightened city rules requiring that new 
construction not encroach on front lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed revision, there would be no added front lawn requirements. 
The parking requirements and outside staircase ban would apply to all new 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several residents said any restrictions on large homes are unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"You call them monster homes," David Pedroza said. "Really, all they are is 
big, beautiful homes. What are we? Jealous because someone's building a 
beautiful home in our neighborhood?"

MOTIVE UNCERTAIN IN MAIL SCAM TRACED TO POSTAL BOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman living in the Los Angeles area is the prime suspect in a postal scam in 
which fraudulent change-of-address forms were used to divert mail from three 
states to a Hawaiian Gardens post office box. 
</P>
<P>
The motive behind the fraud is not known since no one has tried to pick up the 
mail in order to cash checks or use credit card numbers, said Donald Obritsch 
of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The woman has not been arrested and inspectors declined to release her hame. If 
an arrest is made, the suspect could face fines and up to 10 years in prison 
for making false statements on a postal form and for obstructing mail delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Chnge-of-address forms, all with the names of different people on them, were 
sent to post offices in Montana, Idaho and Hawaii. The case cane to light when 
the postal patrons whose names were used on the forms complained to their local 
postal officials that they were not receiving their mail.

The Cal State Long Beach men's basketball team, which has yet to exhibit any of 
its preseason promise, will play No. 2-ranked Arizona at 3 p.m. Saturday in 
Tucson's McKale Center. 
</P>
<P>
The game will be broadcast by KORG (1190).

Long Beach is shooting only 39% from the field and has made 50 turnovers. 
Sophomore guard Lucious Harris is leading the 49ers with an average of 28

4 AREA TEAMS MAKE SEMIFINAL PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four Southeast/Long Beach area high school teams are still alive in the CIF 
Southern Section football playoffs, including Whittier Christian and Valley 
Christian, which face each other in a Division IX semifinal game at 7:30 p.m. 
Friday at Whittier College. 
</P>
<P>
Undefeated Whittier Christian (11-0) won its first two playoff games, 52-6 
against San Jacinto and 61-28 over Desert, after averaging 37 points a game 
during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
But it is doubtful if the Heralds, coached by Phil Bravo, will be overconfident 
-- they had to come from a 28-7 halftime deficit to beat Valley Christian, 
33-28, in October. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Wunderley's Valley Christian Crusaders of Cerritos are 6-5 and coming off 
a 24-6 victory over Bishop last week. 
</P>
<P>
In Division I, Paramount (12-0) will play El Toro (11-1) at 7:30 p.m. Saturday 
at Mission Viejo High School. The game will be a rematch of last year's 
Division III title game, which was won by Paramount, 26-20. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the running of Leon Neal, the Paramount Pirates have a potent passing 
attack, led by quarterback Steve Lopez, who has thrown for 1,492 yards and 22 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, who beat Muir, 35-13, last week, have won 20 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
In Division III, St. Paul (7-3-2) plays 10-2 Hawthorne at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at 
Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul of Santa Fe Springs, coached by Miguel Olmedo, has won six games in a 
row, including a 42-7 victory over Beverly Hills in the second round last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Swordsmen are led by defensive lineman Tim Norton, the lineman of the year 
in the Mission League, and tight end Ryan Granillo, who is averaging 13 yards a 
pass reception and is also a good blocker.

THE VALLEY'S BIG THREE EXPECT TO HOLD COURT AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOLS: TRADITIONAL POWERS MUIR, GLENDORA AND PASADENA AGAIN FAVORED TO 
BE DOMINANT FORCES IN 1990-91 BASKETBALL SEASON.

<P>
Muir, Glendora and Pasadena highs, three traditional boys basketball powers in 
the San Gabriel Valley, are preseason favorites to again dominate play when the 
season gets under way this week. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora has enjoyed the most success of the three teams over the past two 
seasons, reaching the CIF 4-AA Division final the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But Muir, with an experienced lineup returning, may have a slight edge over 
Glendora and Pasadena at the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Other schools that fall among the valley's top echelon include Pomona, West 
Covina, Diamond Bar, Bishop Amat, Ganesha, Alhambra and Nogales. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at the top 10: 
</P>
<P>
1. Muir (Pacific League; 4-AA) -- There's a good reason why first-year Coach 
Rocky Moore is eager for the season to start. This team has the potential to be 
one of the best ever for the tradition-rich Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a very exciting team to be around," Moore said. "On paper, I think 
we can compete with anybody." 
</P>
<P>
With four NCAA Division I prospects on the team, the Mustangs should be one of 
the most talented teams in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The top player for Muir, which was 15-11 last season and reached the second 
round of the 4-AA playoffs, may be the youngest: sophomore point guard Jacque 
Vaughn. A starter as a freshman, Vaughn made his biggest impression last summer 
when he finished in the top 15 at the prestigious Superstars Camp at UC Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Vaughn, the other major-college prospects in Muir's starting 
lineup are 6-foot-6 senior forwards Erid Scott and Darren Greene and 6-4 senior 
guard Philip Turner. Two other standouts for the Mustangs are forwards Reuben 
Jones, a 6-3 senior, and Donald McIntire, a 6-4 junior. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of confidence in our kids and I can see the confidence growing 
within our kids," he said. "I think that's going to make a difference as the 
season gets going." 
</P>
<P>
2. Glendora (Baseline League; 4-AA) -- The Tartans lost five starters from a 
team that went 28-6 and won the 4-AA championship -- the school's first 
division title -- last season, but there is little cause for alarm. 
</P>
<P>
Not with the surplus of talented underclassmen on the squad. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a completely different team," Coach Mike LeDuc said. "We probably have 
more talent this year, but we're so young. This is the youngest team I've ever 
coached and I've coached 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the team's top 11 players are underclassmen. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most talented is 6-1 freshman point guard Cameron Murray, whose 
older brother Tracy established numerous CIF scoring records with the Tartans 
and starts at UCLA. "He's very good right now but I think he's going to become 
a lot better," LeDuc said. 
</P>
<P>
The only senior in Glendora's starting lineup is expected to be 6-5 center Jay 
Zuhlke. The other starters are expected to be 6-5 junior Tracey Thompson at 
forward and 5-10 junior Scott Jacobsen at guard and 6-1 sophomore guard Adam 
Jacobsen, a cousin of Scott who made 85 three-point baskets and averaged 10 
points last season. 
</P>
<P>
3. Pasadena (Pacific League; 5-A) -- Throughout much of the 1980s, the once 
mighty Bulldog basketball program had to struggle simply to keep its record 
above .500. 
</P>
<P>
But in the past two seasons, the winning tradition appears to be resurfacing. 
The Bulldogs have won 47 of 56 games during that span and reached the 5-A 
semifinals both seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the graduation of All-Division I players Todd Lewis and Don Mitchell 
from last season's 23-6 squad, the Bulldogs seem to be in good position for 
another excellent season. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we weren't favored (in our league) at the start of the season and 
this year we're not favored again," Coach Bill Duwe said. "But last year's team 
matured fast and we were ready when league rolled around in January. If we grow 
up and mature, we're hoping we can jell again by January." 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs will have outstanding quickness led by returning starters Raymond 
Maberry, a 5-10 guard, and Kenric Marshall, a 6-3 forward. Maberry averaged 14 
points last season. Other top players for Pasadena include 6-3 guard Lydell 
Hill, 5-10 guard Byron King, 5-10 guard Greg Sumpter and 6-3 sophomore forward 
Treyvone Towns. 
</P>
<P>
4. Pomona (Montview League; 3-AA) -- The Red Devils displayed flashes of 
brilliance in winning their second consecutive Montview League title last 
season on their way to a 20-7 record. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach Ed Taylor is hoping for a better end result than last season, when 
the Red Devils were eliminated in the second round of the 3-AA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"They have the potential of being a great team and going a lot farther than 
they did last year," he said. "They just have to keep working at it." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to improve the team's chances, Taylor has arranged a more 
difficult nonleague schedule and focused more on defense in practice. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona already has ample experience, quickness and offensive capability with 
the return of eight lettermen, including two-time All-Division III guard Johnny 
McWilliams. The 6-6 senior averaged 23.5 points, 13.5 rebounds and 6.2 assists 
last season and is regarded as one of the top college prospects in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Devils also return 5-10 guard John Smith, 6-foot guard Anthony Jones, 
6-1 1/2 forward Darius McJimpson, 6-3 forward Ed Comeaux and 6-3 forward 
Dedrique Taylor, the coach's son. Another returning player is 6-1 guard Tony 
Campbell, an outstanding three-point shooter and a receiver on the football 
team. 
</P>
<P>
5. West Covina (Sierra League; 5-A) -- After winning the Sierra League title 
last season and finishing second the season before, Coach Ed Coyle said the 
program is starting to develop the pride that only success can bring. 
</P>
<P>
"Our program is showing a lot of pride," Coyle said. "It's gotten to the point 
that our players expect to be right there." 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs lost all-valley players Clyde Jordan and Sherrod Belton from their 
team that went 19-7 and made the playoffs last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost some pretty good players but I think we're going to be pretty good 
again," Coyle said. "I'm very pleased with what I've seen so far. This is the 
best chemistry they've had here. They really work hard and they want to repeat 
as Sierra League champions." 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs will not have as much size as they did last season and return only 
one starter, 6-4 senior guard Mark Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
But Coyle is pleased with what he has seen from the younger players, including 
5-10 sophomore point guard Jameel Mahmud, 6-2 junior guard James Parker and 
junior forwards Humberto Ceballos and Steve McHenry, both of whom are 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
6. Diamond Bar (Sierra League; 5-A) -- The prospects are very good for the 
Brahmas this season. 
</P>
<P>
They have four starters returning from a squad that went 15-11 and reached the 
5-A playoffs last season. They will add three sophomores from an outstanding 
junior varsity team, but Coach Bill Murray doesn't want to get too carried away 
about the team's chances. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice group we have back but we still have to find the right fifth and 
sixth people," he said. "On paper, we look pretty good but we have to see how 
we can perform on the court." 
</P>
<P>
The Brahmas will revolve around their four returning senior starters, 6-3 
forward Damian Hyams, 6-4 forward Oliver Chamberlain, 5-10 guard Tre Wheat and 
5-11 guard Chad Matz. Hyams was the team's leading scorer last season and 
Chamberlain, nephew of Wilt Chamberlain, was second. 
</P>
<P>
The newcomer in the starting five is expected to be 6-6 sophomore Keith Van 
Horn. Two other sophomores who will see considerable playing time are 6-5 
forward Olin Chamberlain and 6-4 forward Damon Hendrick. Chamberlain is 
Oliver's brother and Hendrick's brother Brian is a former Brahma who plays for 
UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
7. Bishop Amat (Angelus League; 4-AA) -- With no seniors among the top nine 
players, this is easily Coach Alex Acosta's youngest team ever at Bishop Amat. 
</P>
<P>
By it could also wind up as one of his best teams. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat is expected to be led by guard Jelani Gardner, a 6-3 freshman who 
starred on the same youth team with Glendora's Cameron Murray. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best freshman I've ever had," Acosta said. "I don't think there could 
be five better freshmen in the state than this kid." 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers, who finished 17-11 and advanced to the 4-AA quarterfinals, are 
expected to alternate between 6-4 junior Karim Webb, 6-2 junior Randy Edwards, 
5-10 junior Rashid Strode and Gardner in the backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Amat's front line will include 6-4 junior Scott Fields and 6-5 Brandon 
Lee at forward and 6-8 David Ng at center. Fields, an outstanding athlete, is 
also one of the top running backs in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we have a pretty good rotation among our top seven players," Acosta 
said. "The key will be our inexperience but I think by January we'll be all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
8. Ganesha (Hacienda League; 4-A) -- First-year Coach Mel Sims sees a lot of 
similarities between this season and his first with the Muir High girls' team 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
It was a young Muir team that went on to reach the 4-AA finals in 1988-89 and 
finished second in the state Division II final last season. 
</P>
<P>
With only two seniors on a 17-player roster and a team that finished 13-11 and 
reached the playoffs last season, Sims sees the same potential for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really excited about their potential and capabilities," he said. "I 
personally feel like I've walked into a gold mine. As soon as I get a few 
wrinkles with the team worked out, we're going to be very successful." 
</P>
<P>
Senior center Damon Boykin, who is 6-8, averaged 17 points and seven rebounds 
last season. Senior point guard Anthony Ferguson, who is 5-11, averaged 15 
points and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
The best of the junior class include 6-foot forward Carl Amones, 6-3 forward 
Gerald Wright and 6-1 forward Damien Helms and 5-10 guard Ronnie Randle. Helms 
averaged 12 points last season and Wright eight. 
</P>
<P>
9. Alhambra (Foothill League; 5-AA) -- Jim Wetmore has grown accustomed to 
having one of the shortest teams in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Moors didn't have a starter taller than 6-1 last season and the lineup this 
season isn't much taller. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that we're going to play against taller guys and we just take it as a 
fact of life," Wetmore said. "So we just try to play as a team -- five guys as 
one. If we do that I know we'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
The coach's strategy worked to perfection last season when the Moors finished 
20-6 and reached the second round of the 5-AA playoffs behind 5-8 guard Hung 
Duong, who averaged 25.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
Duong has graduated, but Wetmore thinks the Moors still have the potential for 
another outstanding season. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we were pretty one dimensional," he said. "Hopefully we can spread 
it around a little more this time." 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra's hopes will probably center around returning guards Bryan Lui, a 5-11 
senior, and Hon Trieu, a 5-9 junior who averaged 15 points last season. The 
Moors also figure to start 5-11 seniors Tim Yarnell and Sean Yoshimoto at 
forward and 6-2 senior Stuart Patterson at center. 
</P>
<P>
10. Nogales (Sierra League; 5-AA) -- It was business as usual last season for 
the Nobles, who finished 21-6 after losing in the first round of the 5-AA 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Nogales has a new coach in Bob Withers, who takes over from Steve Ludlam. But 
it will not come as a major surprise if the Nobles win at least 20 games and 
make the playoffs this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Nobles will rely largely on lettermen such as center Tally Christopher and 
guards Caine Wilson, Trevin Owens and Adam Contreras. Wilson averaged 14 points 
and Christopher 10.8 last season.

THE BUTCHER: GOOD WURST IS THE BEST OF MEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If you have read this column with any regularity throughout the years, you are 
aware that I am something of a "nut" for sausage. 
</P>
<P>
To my taste, a good wurst is the best of meats. My wife and I had dinner not 
long ago at Campton Place, the lovely little hotel on Stockton Street in San 
Francisco that the talented young chef Bradley Ogden made famous. Ogden is no 
longer at Campton Place; but fortunately for those of us who live in Marin 
County, he moved to Marin and opened his own place -- the Lark Creek Inn in 
Larkspur. Campton Place was lucky to have Jan Birnbaum, another young and 
talented chef, there to take over when Ogden left. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did he work with Ogden for some time, Birnbaum spent four years with 
Paul Prudhomme in New Orleans before heading off to New York to take over as 
chef at the Quilted Giraffe. He then stopped off for a spell to cook at the 
Rattlesnake Club in Denver before moving on to San Francisco. Campton Place is 
fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
One night after dinner, Birnbaum joined us for coffee. In almost no time, after 
"How's Brad doing?" and "Have you heard from Paul?" the conversation turned to 
sausage -- Birnbaum is a sausage "nut" too. "I've got a couple new ones that I 
think you'll like. I'll fax you the recipes." He did, and I did, and I think 
you will like them also.

IRAQ SCOFFS AT U.S. PUSH TO USE FORCE

<P>
The United States conducted last-minute lobbying today as the U.N. Security 
Council prepared to authorize a military strike to liberate Kuwait if Iraq 
refuses to withdraw by Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Passage would mark only the second time in the 45-year history of the United 
Nations that the council has authorized the use of force to counter aggression. 
The first time was in 1950, during the Korean conflict. 
</P>
<P>
In an extraordinary meeting of 13 foreign ministers, the council was to hand 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein an ultimatum to vacate the tiny oil-rich 
emirate, which his troops invaded Aug. 2, or risk military conflict with 
U.S.-led forces. Only the ministers of Yemen and the Ivory Coast did not 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the 12th council resolution condemning the Iraqi aggression, and 
would strengthen President Bush's hand with Congress and the American people in 
calling for offensive action against Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
At least 12 of the 15 council members appeared to be solidly behind the U.S. 
initiative, with a possible abstention by China and abstentions or negative 
votes by Cuba and Yemen. The United States and its allies continued working 
toward the measure's passage today. 
</P>
<P>
Nine affirmative votes were required. Any of the five permanent council members 
can veto the measure. Three -- the United States, the Soviet Union and Britain 
-- sponsored the brief resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution gives Hussein "one final opportunity, as a pause of goodwill," 
to retreat. 
</P>
<P>
He has refused to leave and has defied all previous resolutions condemning the 
occupation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein responded defiantly to the developments at the United Nations. He 
declared he was not afraid of fighting the United States, which he said had 
been overly influenced by "Rambo" movies. 
</P>
<P>
"The Americans are still influenced by 'Rambo' movies but this is not a 'Rambo' 
movie. This is something different," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not underestimate American military power, but we scorn their evil 
intentions," he said in remarks carried by official Baghdad radio.

3 SAN FERNANDO RESIDENTS DIE IN UNRELATED KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police this morning were attempting to identify killers in the 
unrelated deaths of three San Fernando residents, including a Van Nuys man who, 
after being shot outside a supermarket, drove himself 2 1/2 miles to a hospital 
before dying. 
</P>
<P>
There were no suspects in any of the slayings and the exact motive for each 
attack was not known, detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
Clarage R. Kingsmore, 61, of Van Nuys died at 12:15 a.m. today at Valley 
Presbyterian Hospital of a gunshot wound to his upper body, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Kingsmore, a manager at a Bendix Corp. office in Sylmar for 32 years, drove 
himself to the hospital about 9 p.m. Wednesday and told members of the staff 
that he had been shot outside the Hughes Market at 14440 Burbank Blvd., 
Detective James Vojtecky said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was coming out of the store. He had a nice car; it could have been an 
attempted robbery," Vojtecky said. "But we don't know the motive." 
</P>
<P>
Police were also looking for a suspect in the fatal shooting of a 36-year-old 
Sun Valley man about 5 p.m. Wednesday at the Los Amigos Bar at 11500 San 
Fernando Road in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill detectives were also looking for the killer of John Pedraza, 34, of 
San Fernando, who died Wednesday, three days after he was stabbed repeatedly 
during a confrontation outside a Mission Hills nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
Pedraza, a young grandfather who worked at the General Motors plant in Van 
Nuys, was found stabbed at 2 a.m. Sunday in the parking lot outside the LGT 
Vegas Club at 11000 Sepulveda Blvd., Lt. Bernard D. Conine said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have no suspects in the case, Conine said.

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today pronounced himself and other Communists 
"guilty before the working class" and promised immediate steps to improve food 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet president will get substantial help from Germany in that effort. 
More than 40 years after Moscow tried to starve West Berlin into submission, 
Germany said today it will help ward off hunger in the Soviet Union by donating 
huge food reserves built up because of the infamous blockade. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said he had concluded agreements for the republics of Estonia, 
Kazakhstan and the Ukraine to send dairy products to Moscow and Leningrad, 
where milk is hard to find in stores. Food shortages have caused a public 
outcry. 
</P>
<P>
He also said powdered milk will be taken out of storage and distributed to the 
people. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's top foreign policy adviser, Horst Teltschik, 
said Germany will give the Soviets the so-called Berlin reserves, replenished 
over the years in case of another blockade. 
</P>
<P>
Those reserves include, among other items, 66,000 tons of rye, 26,000 tons of 
canned meat and 7,500 tons of butter. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin officials, who urged Bonn to donate the food, estimated that it could 
feed 10 million Soviets for one month. 
</P>
<P>
A huge U.S.-led airlift broke the 1948-49 Soviet blockade, aimed at driving the 
Western powers out of Berlin.

A daily airlift of supplies and tens of thousands of food packages sent by 
CARE, the international relief organization, will also aid the crippled 
Communist nation as part of a large-scale assistance program. 
</P>
<P>
Germans are worried, however, that their donations could wind up in the Soviet 
Union's growing black market. "We are supervising things ourselves," said Klaus 
Noeldner, head of the German branch of CARE. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, in a wide-ranging, hourlong speech before a conference of the Moscow 
City Communist Party organization, also reiterated his determination to hold 
the Soviet Union together. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on a podium with an 8-foot-tall bust of Lenin, Gorbachev told the 
nearly 1,000 conference delegates that he realized the country's food and 
ethnic problems were intensifying and he urged the party to keep the common man 
in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"We are guilty before the working class, I think, all of us, and me 
personally," the 59-year-old president and Communist Party general secretary 
told the audience. 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet government spokesman said today Gorbachev will go to the troubled 
southwestern republic of Moldova (the former Moldavia) on Friday in an effort 
to calm ethnic tensions that have split the republic and led to violent 
clashes. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev will go to the Moldovan capital of Kishinev for a 24-hour visit and 
is also considering a visit to the Russian-speaking city of Tiraspol, Gorbachev 
spokesman Sergei Grigoriev said. 
</P>
<P>
Russians and Ukrainians in the Dniester region of eastern Moldova and 
Turkic-speaking Gagauzis in the south declared separate autonomous regions 
earlier this year because of fears that minority rights will be trampled under 
Moldovan nationalism and the majority's desire to unite with Romania.

President Bush, endorsing the first major revision of immigration law in 25 
years, today approved a substantially higher limit on the number of immigrants 
allowed into the United States each year. 
</P>
<P>
"Immigration is not just a link to America's past. It is also a bridge to 
America's future," he said as he signed a bill adding 400,000 to the maximum 
number of immigrants for the next three years. The new upper limit is 2.1 
million persons. 
</P>
<P>
The measure allows 48,000 visas a year to be issued individuals from Italy, 
Poland, Ireland and other countries virtually shut out of U.S. immigration in 
the past 20 years.

A hibachi being used indoors was blamed today for carbon monoxide deaths of a 
man and his small son and hospitalization of his wife and 2-week-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were called to the family's home at 718 N. Figueroa St. about 8:30 
p.m. Wednesday after relatives broke into the residence and found Nghip Tan 
Nguyen, 39, and his 4-year-old son, Jollivet, dead on a bed in the living room, 
Sgt. Roger Scharf said. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen's wife, Canh, and 2-week-old daughter were found alive, lying on another 
bed, he said. They were in stable condition at Garden Grove Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"A small hibachi barbecue was found in the kitchen, and death is thought to be 
the result of carbon monoxide poisoning," Scharf said. 
</P>
<P>
Police had not determined whether the family was using the hibachi for heat or 
cooking, he said.

The arson-sparked brush fire that charred 80 acres of Carbon Canyon Regional 
Park last night was fully contained this morning, but firefighters were being 
kept on alert as Santa Ana winds began to kick up. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still hot spots that we can't walk away from," Orange County Fire 
Department Capt. Dan Young said this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze, which was started by an incendiary device, burned mostly grassland, 
missing a grove of 130 California redwoods in the park and coming to within a 
quarter of a mile of homes. No one was injured, and no property was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Young said a plea for help in locating the arsonist seems to be working, with 
fire and police investigators receiving numerous tips this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been getting lots of calls," Young said. "We've got several leads, and 
they are good leads."

Gunfire crackled through Dhaka, the Bangladesh capital, today as police battled 
protesters demanding the ouster of President Hussain Mohammed Ershad and an end 
to a state of emergency, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders said 50 people were killed and more than 1,000 others 
wounded Wednesday when demonstrators swarmed into the streets in defiance of 
curfews in Dhaka and four other cities. 
</P>
<P>
The casualties were reported in written statements circulated in Dhaka that 
reached India through unofficial channels. Some previous opposition claims have 
been exaggerated, and the latest figures could not be verified. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in New Delhi said they had reports of four dead and 15 
wounded in the Bangladesh capital during clashes with paramilitary forces 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The curfews were imposed Tuesday night as part of a state of emergency Ershad 
declared to try to quash the growing movement against him. The decree also 
suspended civil rights and imposed press censorship after six weeks of 
often-violent protests. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the demonstrations continued today, but they had no word of 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Hensena, a businessman based in Hong Kong, said he heard gunfire when he 
left his Dhaka hotel for the airport today. 
</P>
<P>
"It was 'bam-bam-bam-bam!' and then it was quiet again. It was shotgun, rifle 
fire. I heard a lot of people shouting," Hensena said as he arrived in Bangkok, 
Thailand. He did not give his nationality.

A newspaper reported today that police uncovered a plot to kill President Bush 
during his visit here next week, but government officials said the report was 
unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no confirmation of supposed plans to assassinate President Bush," 
Interior Minister Julio Mera Figueroa said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy refused to comment on the report by the sensationalist daily 
tabloid, Diario Popular. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested a Bolivian on suspicion of membership in a terrorist group. But 
the judge in charge of the case, Alberto Duran, said, "There is no evidence of 
a plan against the life of Mr. Bush." 
</P>
<P>
The Bolivian was identified as Carlos Anibal Monzon Novena, 41. 
</P>
<P>
Diario Popular claimed that Monzon Novena was the leader of a group called the 
Union of Revolutionary Workers that planned to attack Bush during his 22-hour 
visit in Argentina on Dec. 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that Monzon Novena was imprisoned from 1977 to 1983 during 
the military dictatorship for alleged guerrilla activities and that his group 
is a spinoff from the Revolutionary Army of the People that tried to overthrow 
Argentina's governments.

A New York publishing firm is negotiating to buy Field Publications, the 
company that publishes Weekly Reader, a news magazine read by more than 10 
million schoolchildren each week. 
</P>
<P>
Field Corp., the Chicago-based parent of the Middletown-based publishing arm, 
is in the final stages of negotiations with K-III Holdings Inc., Field 
executives said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Field has been looking for a buyer for its Middletown subsidiary since summer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not final, but hopefully it will be final soon," said Bruce Seide, 
president of Field Publications. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations also involve Funk &amp; Wagnalls Inc., Field's encyclopedia 
affiliate in Ramsey, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
K-III Holdings, the company negotiating for the purchase, was formed in 1989 by 
former executives from the publisher Macmillan Inc. and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts 
&amp; Co., a New York-based leveraged-buyout giant that owns RJR Nabisco Inc., 
Stop &amp; Shop and Duracell. 
</P>
<P>
The family of Marshall Field IV, which owns Field Corp., decided to consider 
selling Field Publications to raise cash and not because of the subsidiary's 
performance, Seide said.

McDonnell Douglas today delivered its first $100-million MD-11 tri-jet,

billion in new revenue during the next five years.

Hood, speaking at a morning ceremony turning over the jetliner to Finnair, said 
development costs of the plane totaled more than $700 million and that 
estimated total costs so far have reached $2.8 billion.

The company, he said, has 174 firm orders for the MD-11, each with a price tag

Warning! Check carefully before throwing out that wrapping paper. The dollar

</P>
<P>
Maus &amp; Hoffman clothing stores in southern Florida have been wrapping 
holiday gifts in uncut sheets of 32 genuine $1 bills for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
And co-owner William Maus Jr. has grown accustomed to a familiar lament. 
</P>
<P>
He said many a gift recipient complains: "O my God, I didn't know it was real!" 
And that's usually after Christmas, he added, which means it's been ripped open 
or thrown away." 
</P>
<P>
Some people ignore or simply don't believe the store's "WARNING" sticker 
attached to each package wrapped with the dollar bills. 
</P>
<P>
The store sells the sheets for $55 -- $23 over face value -- and only to 
customers who make a purchase. 
</P>
<P>
But the sheets are familiar holiday fare at stores throughout the nation, said 
Leah Akbar, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Bureau visitors can buy the sheets in presses of 32, 16 and four $1 bills. 
They're also available by mail and sell for $47, $28 and $10.25, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Akbar said the price includes handling and shipping and that any profit goes 
toward paying workers at the bureau gift center in Washington. Delivery takes 
eight to 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The address for mail-order bills is Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Public 
Sales, Room 602-11A, Washington, D.C. 20228.

Doug Baldwin, Gibson's Seattle-based attorney, said Wednesday that the Twins 
were among four teams with whom Gibson was considering signing. He hinted that 
the Twins have courted the Dodgers outfielder more intensely than the other 
three: the Milwaukee Brewers, Kansas City Royals and Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota General Manager Andy MacPhail said the offer now on the table is 
loaded with incentives that protect the club in the event Gibson's chronic leg 
problems would not allow him to play two full seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Under a deal MacPhail called a "Twins special," Gibson's salary would increase 
each time his games played and at-bats reached certain levels. If Gibson is 
able to play two full seasons, he would earn the entire $5 million. If he 
cannot play at all, he would still be paid in the seven figures, though 
MacPhail said the guaranteed portion of the contract was "lower than most might 
think." 
</P>
<P>
A severely pulled tendon in Gibson's left hamstring limited him to half a 
season in 1990. He hit .260 with eight home runs and 35 RBI. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, 33, told Baldwin he's interested in playing for the Twins because of 
his fondness for the Twin Cities and the Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations also are under way with free-agent reliever Dave Righetti, 32. 
Righetti, a left-hander who has spent his entire career with the New York 
Yankees, has been courted by the Angels and Dodgers, among other teams. 
</P>
<P>
Righetti's agent, Bill Goodstein, said as many as 10 teams are interested in 
his client, but he stressed talks with MacPhail have been lengthy, cordial and 
productive. 
</P>
<P>
While MacPhail did not preclude the possibility of signing both Gibson and 
Righetti, he said, "We're much further down the road with Gibson than with 
Righetti or anyone else."

SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WILL SPLIT INTO 2 DIVISIONS, PRESIDENTS DECIDE

<P>
The presidents of the 12 Southeastern Conference schools have voted to divide 
the SEC into two divisions, with each team playing eight league football games 
a year, the SEC announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The presidents also approved on Wednesday, during a telephone conference call, 
a plan for a 16-game men's basketball schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The division of the conference was made possible when Arkansas and South 
Carolina agreed to become new members earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC office said Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, South Carolina, Tennessee and 
Vanderbilt will be in one division. Alabama, Arkansas, Auburn, Louisiana State, 
Mississippi and Mississippi State will be in the other. 
</P>
<P>
The football schedule, expected to be in place for the 1992 season, when South 
Carolina and Arkansas officially join the league, will feature a championship 
game between the divisional winners. 
</P>
<P>
Under a 5-2-1 format, each SEC team will play all five teams in its own 
division and two permanent opponents in the other division each season, then 
will rotate among the four other schools, playing one per season. 
</P>
<P>
The two permanent opponents of each school are: Florida -- Auburn and LSU; 
Georgia -- Ole Miss and Auburn; Kentucky -- LSU and Mississippi State; South 
Carolina -- Mississippi State and Arkansas; Tennessee -- Arkansas and Alabama; 
Vanderbilt -- Alabama and Ole Miss; Alabama -- Tennessee and Vanderbilt; 
Arkansas -- South Carolina and Tennessee; Auburn -- Georgia and Florida; LSU -- 
Florida and Kentucky; Ole Miss -- Vanderbilt and Georgia, and Mississippi State 
-- Kentucky and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Constitution, quoting an unidentified source close to the 
presidents, said presidents voted 10 to 2 for the alignment. The SEC declined 
to reveal the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, every SEC member will play every other member at least twice 
during an eight-year period. The order of non-divisional rotating opponents 
will be determined later.

UNLV ALLOWED TO DEFEND ITS TITLE; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: UNIVERSITY AGREES TO FORFEIT LIVE TV APPEARANCES NEXT SEASON AND TO 
SIT OUT NCAA TOURNAMENT IN SPRING OF 1992.

<P>
UNLV will be allowed to defend its national basketball title after all. 
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented reversal, the NCAA said today that the top-ranked Rebels 
can play in this spring's tournament if they agree to one of two conditions. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV readily agreed to forfeit live television appearances during the 1991-92 
season and to sit out the NCAA tournament in the spring of '92. 
</P>
<P>
The other alternative would have been for Coach Jerry Tarkanian to sit out this 
year's tournament and for the school to skip the '92 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
If not for the NCAA's change of heart, UNLV would have become the second 
national basketball champion to be barred from defending its title. The first 
was Kansas, which won the 1988 NCAA title but had to bypass the '89 tournament 
because of recruiting violations. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels, who returned four starters from the team that captured UNLV's first 
national championship last year, were told in July they could not defend their 
title as a result of the 1977 case between UNLV and the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
That year, the NCAA ordered the university to suspend Tarkanian for two years 
because of violations in the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian, however, won a court injunction prohibiting the university from 
suspending him. The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which did not overturn 
the injunction but said the NCAA has the power to discipline its members. 
</P>
<P>
This case is separate from another investigation into UNLV's recruitment of 
Lloyd Daniels, which is pending. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA's announcement in June that the Rebels could not defend their title 
triggered protests from UNLV officials and fans, many of whom noted that the 
current players were only children when the original infractions were said to 
have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV requested another meeting with the committee and in July offered four 
alternative penalties. 
</P>
<P>
In their decision announced today, the committee members rejected outright all 
four alternatives the school presented at their meeting in Chicago. They were: 
</P>
<P>
That UNLV would be banned from the 1992 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
That Tarkanian be suspended from coaching in the 1992 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
That Tarkanian be suspended from coaching in the 1991 tournament as well as 
forfeit his contractual right to a share of UNLV's tournament proceeds; that he 
be suspended from all recruiting for one year; that the basketball program be 
limited to 15 official visits for recruits for 1991-92, and that the program 
undergo supervised monitoring each six months for two years. 
</P>
<P>
That scholarship limits be reduced from 15 to 13 for 1991-92; that official 
visits be reduced from 18 to nine for 1991-92; that no off-campus recruiting be 
permitted by any member of the basketball staff for one year while the Rebels 
make no network television appearances for 1991-92.

LEAVING NHL WAS JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: FRED ARTHUR FAILED TO LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS AS A FIRST-ROUND PICK IN 
1980. NOW HE'S A MEDIC AND ENJOYS PLAYING AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF JACOBS, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a celebrated first-round pick in 1980, he never did fulfill his role as the 
Hartford Whalers' savior. 
</P>
<P>
But as a doctor, Fred Arthur is helping save lives. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur has found happiness in medicine and satisfaction at the Victoria 
Hospital emergency room in London, Ontario. It is a career fulfillment he 
couldn't find in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people coming in from all over western Ontario from auto accidents, 
heart attacks, sports injuries, suicide attempts," he said. "You sit there 
having coffee with your feet up and then all hell breaks loose. An ambulance is 
coming with lights and sirens. In two minutes, we'll be in a major 
resuscitation room with a person who could have injuries to every part of his 
body. It's challenging, exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than accept a demotion to the minors, Arthur announced his retirement 
from the Philadelphia Flyers on Oct. 25, 1982. He was 21. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years later, there are a thousand questions to ask this man who was 
drafted eighth in the world in 1980 and this year became a medical doctor. But 
then again there is only one question: Did you do the right thing? 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely," said Arthur, who is married and the father of a 9-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
After a bitter taste of hockey in Hartford, Arthur was traded to Philadelphia 
in 1981. He played well the first half of the 1981-82 season for the Flyers 
before slipping in the second half. That summer he heard the beat of another 
drummer and marched out of the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
"I showed I could play in Philly. I killed all the penalties," Arthur said. 
"Wayne Gretzky was on the ice. 'Get out there, Fred.' That's a pretty big ego 
trip. But once I showed I had that level of skill, a lot of the motivation was 
gone . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I went back home and played video games for two months. My brother still tells 
a story about how I played one game for nine hours without blinking. Then I 
started to come together. I went to McGill University (in Montreal) for premed. 
It was a scary experience. I would stay up to 1 a.m. reading about the orbits 
of electrons. I'd wake up the next morning and it wasn't there. My brain was 
out of shape." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the little comparisons, some of the ironies, still filter through 
Arthur's mind. He looks at the team picture of the 1981-82 Flyers and sees how 
few remain in the NHL today. He realizes if he were playing he would be 
considered aging. But as a doctor he's a kid. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of times each week, he and his fellow doctors skate. They even play in 
periodic tournaments. When he works five nights in a row, Arthur says he can be 
brutal. Other nights, it all flows. 
</P>
<P>
"The circle is almost complete," he said. "It started as fun, carried me a long 
way, I learned a lot, gave me experience. Now it's fun again."

The taller, rangy Filipino dominated the 12-round bout from start to finish, 
knocking down and bloodying the Thai, but failed to put him away. The judges

2 HORSES, 2 DIFFERENT ROUTES TO A REMATCH; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACE: TOOTER SCOOTER BASKED IN FLORIDA SUN WHILE DIE LAUGHING WORKED OUT 
UP NORTH.

<P>
Tooter Scooter and Die Laughing have taken different paths to their rematch 
Friday in the Breeders Crown. 
</P>
<P>
When the two colts last met, Tooter Scooter tailed Die Laughing from start to 
finish in a stakes pace at the Red Mile in Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
While Tooter Scooter has been basking in the warmth of South Florida since that 
loss in October, Die Laughing has been put through a rigorous prep program in 
the cooler North. The different schedules could weigh in Tooter Scooter's 
favor, Joe Holloway, the colt's trainer, said. 
</P>
<P>
"My horse has been down here lying on the beach and sending out post cards," 
Holloway said. "Die Laughing has been up North running in four or five tough 
races." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Die Laughing has been made the 9-5 morning-line favorite to win 
the $605,870 Colt and Gelding Pace, one of four Breeders Crown races Friday 
night at Pompano Harness Track. The card for 2-year-olds is the last of 12 
Breeders Crown events for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Artsplace, who has won 10 of 14 starts this year, was made the second choice at 
5-2. Tooter Scooter is the track handicapper's 6-1 third pick. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the track handicapper is about right," Holloway said. 
</P>
<P>
Die Laughing, after all, has earned more than $1.1 million while winning eight 
of 11 starts this year. He won the Presidential at Maryland's Rosecroft in 
early November and was second by half a length to Artsplace in the Nov. 17 
Governors Cup at New Jersey's Garden State Park. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Tooter Scooter has earned just $388,000 while winning six of 16 
starts. But he has finished no worse than second in any of his last eight 
starts, including a victory in the Kentucky Pace Derby at Louisville Downs in 
September.

ARTS: ABT DANCERS ARE HANDED A DEADLINE FOR SETTLING ON A NEW CONTRACT. THE

The American Ballet Theatre's board voted unanimously Wednesday to disband the 
company if there is no satisfactory labor agreement with dancers by the time 
rehearsals are to begin next week, board Chairman Charles Dyson confirmed 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson said the company, long the nation's prime showcase of classical ballet, 
is $4 million in debt. He also said that financial problems were not the only 
reasons for the decision. "It's partly (money). That's the only thing I want to 
talk about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As to whether the company will survive, Dyson said: "I don't know whether it 
can or not." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Leibowitz, attorney for the dancers, said he took the threat to disband 
the company "very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Leibowitz said the dancers were offered a three-year package that would freeze 
their pay the first year. It would also cut per diem expenses and take back a 
hard-won concession: private rooms for dancers when they travel. "That's more 
than a money issue. That's a quality of life issue for a company that lives on 
the road," Leibowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
He would not give details of the dancers' counteroffer. "It's really not 
appropriate to go through specifics," he said. As to whether a pay freeze might 
be accepted, he said: "It depends on the package. I'm not saying that anything 
is impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Leibowitz blamed the board for the company's financial bind. "The real issue is 
not whether there is money in the bank," he said. "The issue is what kind of 
commitment is the board prepared to make to raise money, as they ought to have 
been raising money all this time. They have not gone out and done a 
fund-raising job." The board has treated the ballet company "like a mom-and-pop 
store," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson said the board has been "seeking a fair contract." He complained that the 
dancers did not respond to a contract offer made several months ago. "I don't 
know what they have in mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The dancers' contract expired Oct. 31. They are due to begin rehearsals for a 
new season Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Leibowitz said that a counteroffer was made, but discussions broke off three 
weeks ago. The two sides were to meet today to discuss the board's action of 
Wednesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Hermann, director of the company, acknowledged that the board's 
authorizing its executive committee to disband the company, was 
"extraordinarily drastic," but said "it may not be as important as it may 
sound. . . . The board was trying to empower the executive committee to make a 
decision." She noted that the board also authorized the executive committee to 
ratify a contract. 
</P>
<P>
"We very much intend to settle," she said. She said she could not identify any 
single issue as a sticking point in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
She said in authorizing the action by the executive committee, the board was 
attempting to "streamline" the process and that the full board does not plan to 
meet on this issue again. "We're in a limbo state," she said. "We had to 
determine where the power lies." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether she thought the company would disband, she said, "Oh, no! I would 
hope not." 
</P>
<P>
Another source close to the board said the action Wednesday had been 
anticipated because of the failure of fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"The fund-raising just didn't meet any of the goals of last year. It's a choice 
of restricting the company in its artistic achievements or cutting back costs. 
No one wants to restrict the artistic achievements," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Hermann said that the amount of money raised last year was "in excess of what 
had been expected." She said the board raised about $7 million last year, 
nearly $1 million over its goal. Still, she said, that was not enough to deal 
with the accumulated debt. 
</P>
<P>
Dyson said money is coming to the strapped ballet company "in dribs and drabs. 
If you know some white knight who has $4 million or $5 million, have him call 
me."

LIZ SMITH: DELTA BURKE'S ABSENCE FROM SHOW MAY BE A WARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
CONSPICUOUS by her absence this week on "Designing Women" was Delta Burke. Her 
character -- Suzanne Sugarbaker -- was talked about but never seen during the 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
What does this mean? Probably nothing, but Delta may well remember the fate 
that befell Suzanne Somers some seasons ago when she became embroiled in a 
dispute with her producers on "Three's Company." They held Somers to her 
contract but reduced her role to less than nothing. Her career never quite 
regained its luster after that. 
</P>
<P>
Delta told Barbara Walters that she is "willing to risk her reputation and 
career" once again, in an enormous public forum, to trash her producers, Linda 
Bloodworth-Thomason and Harry Thomason. 
</P>
<P>
She said, amid tears, that she wanted to put it all behind her, but . . . well, 
going on TV and accusing people you work with of "betraying you" is not a 
constructive first step to burying the past. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not getting on Delta's case. I was the first to champion her at the height 
of what she considered to be her "weight problem" when the tabloids were filled 
with stories that she was losing her job and husband etc. I pointed out that 
her character had become even funnier and had lost no sex appeal because of her 
added curves. 
</P>
<P>
Dixie Carter told me that Delta's weight gain had not mattered to the show 
"because her face is so gorgeous. And, anyway, she's so talented." Linda 
Bloodworth-Thomason also told me that they had never minded about Delta's 
growing plump; it was Delta who minded. 
</P>
<P>
I missed Delta the other night on "DW." I just hope I don't continue to miss 
her. (People who score in TV always think that the grass will be greener when 
they are out of their hit show. It doesn't usually work that way!) 
</P>
<P>
CONSIDER THIS! The distinguished law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton 
&amp; Garrison with the Iran-Contra legal star Arthur Liman heading the defense 
are said to have earned anywhere from $60 million to $100 million in fees from 
defending Michael Milken. At one point, it is known they were bringing in $2.5 
million a month. 
</P>
<P>
For this defense, Milken received 10 years in jail, a $600-million fine, and 
500 hours of community service when he gets out of jail someday. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Milken would have done better with Legal Aid.

It's been a few weeks since Tennessee Ernie Ford was elected to the Country 
Music Hall of Fame, but he says he still hasn't come out of the clouds.

<P>
"I've got the gear down, but I'm not quite on the ground," Ford said.

"It was totally a surprise because I had some pretty stiff competition. 
Needless to say, I'm thrilled."

Ford received the prestigious award during the Country Music Assn.'s Awards

with the people, the way they reacted, the way they stood up that night."

<P>
"The nicest thing that people say to me now wherever I go is 'I feel like I 
know you.' That's before they say anything about the show or about my singing. 
'I feel like I know you.' "

More than 200,000 audiocassettes valued at more than $1 million were on their 
way Wednesday to Saudi Arabia aboard a Tennessee Air National Guard cargo 
plane, a gift from Nashville's music industry to American troops. 
</P>
<P>
Every major country and Christian label donated thousands of cassettes in a 
project dubbed Operation Desert Song. 
</P>
<P>
Included were 50,000 cassettes donated by country music's current hot new 
singer, Garth Brooks, who was on hand for the cargo loading. 
</P>
<P>
"What can I say about how much we owe these people who are risking their lives 
for us?" Brooks said. "This is little enough, and I only wish we could do more 
to help them." 
</P>
<P>
Including religious music was no easy feat. "There had been considerable 
difficulty on that score," Amy Grant, a top gospel singer said recently, "but 
they finally got it cleared through the military."
