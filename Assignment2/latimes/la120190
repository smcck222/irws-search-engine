It's the stuff of air flight nightmares: An intruder appears in the aisle. Only 
on this L.A.-bound flight the intruder is a 30-inch python. 
</P>
<P>
"The passengers were quite surprised," admitted Continental spokesman Richard 
Danforth. 
</P>
<P>
The serpent had been smuggled aboard in the coat of an unidentified woman in 
Houston. It escaped -- in full view of many of the 100 passengers -- when she 
decided to switch it to her carry-on bag, where she had a pillow. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, attendants scooped up the snake and parked it in the restroom. 
</P>
<P>
The owner was questioned by airport police and released. 
</P>
<P>
She was allowed to keep the snake, but was not given credit for its frequent 
flier mileage.

One of the most curious customs of Caltrans is setting out signs at freeway 
off-ramps that announce when those particular exits are going to be closed. 
Does the agency think motorists zooming along at 50-plus m.p.h. are able to 
digest that information? Or are interested drivers supposed to slam to a halt 
and take notes? 
</P>
<P>
What Caltrans should do is reintroduce the old Burma Shave-type messages, which 
typically consisted of a jingle spread out over four signs. 
</P>
<P>
May we suggest something bright and cheerful, such as: 
</P>

 Cyndi Mitchell of Westchester recently posted 500 signs on street light and 
phone poles, offering a $500 reward for information on the whereabouts of her 
three lost dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Now the city is growling at her. She's been threatened with a $1,000 fine for 
violating an ordinance banning signs on public property. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, whose dogs are still missing, was stunned. "I didn't know it was a 
crime," she said. "The way it was handled was terribly insensitive." 
</P>
<P>
She has begun removing the signs while the city mulls over whether to fine her. 
</P>
<P>
James Washington, the city's chief street-use inspector, said no exceptions to 
the law are allowed. "We basically call signs a type of pollution," he said. "A 
sign is a sign is a sign." 
</P>

When the ornate Bunker Hill Steps were unveiled across the street from the 
Central Library, some downtown boosters said they felt as though they were 
walking on the fabled Spanish Steps of Rome.

Or, perhaps, the floor of any bank. The Old World charm of the stairway has 
been bolstered by some New World equipment: Surveillance cameras designed to

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN VIDEOTAPING OF 
CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A convicted child molester pleaded not guilty Friday to charges that he paid 
children to perform in lewd videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
John Edward Teichrow, 42, faces trial Dec. 20 on five misdemeanor charges 
unrelated to his previous conviction. 
</P>
<P>
He is serving a six-year sentence in a state prison in Chino for molesting 
children in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Teichrow was transported from the prison to appear in Los Angeles for Friday's 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles charges were filed Oct. 30 in connection with the alleged 
videotaping of a 9-year-old boy and a 9-year-old girl at an unidentified 
preschool. Authorities are searching for about 100 other children featured in 
three dozen videotapes found during a search of Teichrow's camper truck, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He is charged with one count each of possession of child pornography, child 
molestation and loitering near a school, and two counts of committing immoral 
acts in the presence of a child.

AUTRY SELLS THE LAST ACRES OF MELODY MOVIE RANCH; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA CLARITA: A FILM PRODUCTION COMPANY WILL RESTORE THE PROPERTY WHERE SUCH 
WESTERN CLASSICS AS 'HIGH NOON' AND 'STAGECOACH' WERE MADE. 
</P>

Singing cowboy legend Gene Autry on Friday sold the last 10 acres of his Melody 
Ranch movie set in Santa Clarita -- scene of countless shoot-outs in which the 
bad guys lost to Western stars from John Wayne and Randolph Scott to Roy Rogers 
and Gary Cooper -- to a film production company that has promised to restore 
and preserve it. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agent Steve Weston, who handled the sale, said the ranch sold for 
$975,000, the asking price. 
</P>
<P>
Over more than four decades as a Monogram Studios lot and under Autry, it 
appeared in TV series such as "Gunsmoke," Saturday afternoon serials for the 
kiddie market, and classic films such as "High Noon." 
</P>
<P>
Autry kept it for some years as a home for his horse, Champion, and decided to 
sell when the horse died this year and was buried there. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to find a buyer who would preserve it," Weston said. "There's a lot 
of history there." He said the company that bought the property asked not to be 
identified until escrow closes in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Autry, now 83 and owner of the California Angels baseball team and KMPC radio, 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
His secretary said he has been recuperating at his Studio City house from eye 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
But Weston said Autry and his wife, Jackie, are pleased that the ranch will be 
preserved as a movie location. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita officials said they are happy that the few Western sets and 
buildings that remain on the ranch in the Placerita Canyon area will not be 
bulldozed and replaced by houses. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have hated to have seen a housing development called something like 
Melody Acres or Autry Acres there," said Jerry Reynolds of the Santa Clarita 
Valley Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't many of the old movie towns around anymore. I doubt if there will 
ever be any more singing cowboys." 
</P>
<P>
Autry made the first of his 93 feature films on what was then a 110-acre ranch 
in the 1930s when it belonged to Monogram Studios. 
</P>
<P>
He bought the property in 1952 after Monogram folded and renamed the site -- 
then called Rancho Placerito -- Melody Ranch after a ranch he supposedly lived 
on in his films and radio show. 
</P>
<P>
The cowboy star installed a miniature railroad to crisscross the many Western 
sets and buildings already on the property and continued to make his movies 
there. Among them were "Rancho Grande," "Melody Ranch," "Apache Country" and 
"On Top of Old Smokey," which also produced a million-selling record for Autry. 
</P>
<P>
Other cowboy stars also made films at Melody Ranch -- Rogers, Cooper, Wayne, 
William Boyd as Hopalong Cassidy and Clayton Moore as the Lone Ranger. 
</P>
<P>
Most, like Autry, played modest and virtuous good guys who wore white hats, 
fought for law and order and almost never kissed the heroine. 
</P>
<P>
"The movies 'High Noon' and 'Stagecoach' were made there," Reynolds said. 
"Almost any old Western movie you might rent was filmed here." 
</P>
<P>
Many early television series, including Autry's and "Gunsmoke," also were 
filmed at Melody Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"Joel McCrea made pictures out there, and Randolph Scott used it -- John Wayne, 
and I guess just about everybody else sooner or later," Autry said in a 1988 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
He said at that time that he had been about to open the ranch to the public in 
1962 when a spectacular fire swept through the canyon and destroyed $1 million 
worth of movie sets, including 54 buildings and movie streets, along with 
countless items from Autry's collection of Western artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
Original stagecoaches, antique guns, Indian relics, Autry's film wardrobe and 
17,500 recordings were destroyed in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
What memorabilia was saved has been moved to the Gene Autry Western Heritage 
Museum in Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
The fire ended Autry's dream of turning Melody Ranch into a tourist attraction 
and his interest in it waned. Over the years, he sold off all but the last 10 
acres to developers. 
</P>
<P>
Weston said that Autry kept the last bit of the property for Champion III, the 
third of his movie horses. After the horse died earlier this year at age 42, 
the Autrys decided to put the ranch up for sale. Champion III was buried on the 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
What remains of the ranch is not situated in the wide, open spaces of its 
heyday. It lies in a neighborhood of upscale homes, some in the $1-million 
range. A visitor standing in the horseshoe-shaped arch that frames the ranch's 
entrance looks directly into a neighbor's front yard.

PAIR WHO POSED AS CAR BUYERS CONVICTED IN OWNER'S KILLING; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: SEPARATE JURIES RETURN GUILTY VERDICTS IN THE FIRST-DEGREE MURDER CASES 
THAT BEGAN WITH A NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENT FOR A USED DATSUN SPORTS CAR IN NORTH 
HOLLYWOOD.

<P>
Two men were convicted Friday of fatally shooting a North Hollywood man and 
stealing a $2,000 car he advertised for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Two separate juries who heard the case in the same San Fernando Superior Court 
found Kent Derek Parrish, 22, of West Los Angeles and Ronald Lewis Fort, 21, of 
Culver City guilty of first-degree murder and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Ronald Davis, 19, was shot Sept. 17, 1989, when he tried to prevent 
Fort and Parrish from stealing his red 1973 Datsun 240-Z. 
</P>
<P>
The men had posed as prospective car buyers and committed the crimes after 
taking the vehicle for a test drive. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish, who fired the gun, faces a maximum sentence of 28 years to life, said 
his attorney, Kenneth P. Lezin. 
</P>
<P>
Fort, his accomplice, faces a maximum of 26 years to life, Lezin said. 
</P>
<P>
The juries took less than a day to convict the two men, who were arrested about 
three weeks after the crime during a routine traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
They had repainted the car and replaced its vehicle identification number, but 
patrol officers determined it was Davis' after checking a secondary 
identification number. 
</P>
<P>
Publicity about the killing generated public concern because newspaper 
advertisements are a common method of selling used cars. 
</P>
<P>
Police advised auto sellers to have a friend or relative meet strangers, for 
identification purposes, before going on a test drive. 
</P>
<P>
Police advised sellers to avoid being outnumbered by potential buyers, to write 
down the license plate number of the vehicle potential buyers arrive in, and to 
follow a timed route on test drives so that someone at home would know if they 
were late returning.

MILKEN'S SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a sad connection between the fall of Milken and the legal profession. 
He either failed to obtain proper legal advice or refused to heed such advice 
before and during his commission of felonies. 
</P>
<P>
With an army of lawyers at his side during the design, planning and execution 
of his deals, one would think that one or two brave counselors would have 
risked losing a client or rise above the "billable time" complex to warn Milken 
that money is no excuse to ignore the law. Perhaps his brother Lowell was or 
should have been such a counselor. 
</P>
<P>
As to being lenient because of charitable work, the law should not distinguish 
between white- and blue-collar crime. The ordinary criminal may be just as 
charitable to his family and friends as the man who has too much money to keep 
it all.

MILKEN'S SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Milken is lucky he lives in the United States. In three to six years, he will 
go home a free man and a millionaire as well. 
</P>
<P>
Even if much of his billion-dollar empire is liquidated by legal expenses, 
fines and operating costs, a few million remaining in 1993 or even 1996 would 
still ensure a reasonable and comfortable lifestyle as compared with working 
people making $35,000 or even $50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
His 10-year sentence is hardly a deterrent. History has shown that no matter 
what punishment is extracted by the law, it does not deter similar crimes in 
the future. Crimes are motivated by greed, anger, revenge and other compelling 
factors. Even if he were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of 
parole, some other junk-bond clone would emerge to do as he had done -- or even 
worse.

MILKEN'S SENTENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
Judge Wood's sentence for Milken appears to be more of government vengeance 
than justice. Her reasoning that he needs to be made of an example of is quite 
unfair in view of more serious crimes that are going unpunished. Why not apply 
and enforce the same standards of the law against all politicians in this 
country who accept campaign contributions and then influence legislation to 
benefit their donors? Does anyone come to mind?

BUSH VISITS U.S. TROOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With reference to your editorial "Are Hostage Families Right to Go to Iraq?" 
(Nov. 19), Hussein's "hostage-taking policy" may be "cruel," but who can deny 
that it is far less cruel than the death and destruction that would result from 
a U.S.-led attack? 
</P>
<P>
To point out that Hussein's invitation -- why "ghoulish"? -- to hostage 
families was made for its propaganda value is to state the blatantly obvious. 
</P>
<P>
But so what? Estimates of casualties in the event of war only mentioned 
Americans, as though the presumably far larger Iraqi casualties were not a 
consideration. Sort of reminiscent of Vietnam where life was "cheap." 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, I would do exactly what Hussein is doing -- doing his 
best to deter attack and thus to keep the peace. And I suspect that Bush, were 
he in Hussein's shoes, would do the same. 
</P>
<P>
My sentiments also extend to Iraq's announcement that it will release all 
hostages starting Christmas Day (Nov. 19). If this constitutes "cynical 
manipulation," so be it. Although release of the thousands of hostages would 
remove "a possible justification for an American-led attack," it might just 
have the opposite effect -- removing a crucial factor which deters an 
American-led attack. In any event, you can't fault Hussein for believing that 
such might be the case.

When we get past the cliches of gunboat diplomacy and the hypocritical bloody 
shirt-waving, what we find is the old story of the sons of the poor being 
ordered to put their lives on the line for the portfolios and privileges of the 
sons of the rich. If ours were a draftee army, would it be there? A great

"Soldiers Face Extended Tours of Duty" (Part A, Nov. 23) is news that's sure to 
boost the spirits of our GIs in the Persian Gulf and their families back home, 
especially as the holidays approach. 
</P>
<P>
But now with our voluntary military having to face the reality of their 
involuntary servitude, the question is, now who's holding hostages and playing 
them as wild cards in this deadly Mideast poker game? 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, when young people in the armed forces are ordered by old men to 
go kill or be killed for the freedom of others, they leave their own freedom 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
Many of them probably missed this hitch in the fine print of their contract at 
the recruiting office. Blinded by the lure of escaping from their various 
socioeconomic cages, they naively sold their souls to a rich uncle named Sam in 
a Faustian quid pro quo deal. Now their payment is due.

I have been reading for months now all the comments regarding our presence in 
the gulf and why we are there. 
</P>
<P>
There is a great paucity of opinions that reflect the memory of the beginnings 
of the Second World War. 
</P>
<P>
If we had taken a firm stand at the beginning of Hitler's rampage across 
Europe, we might have saved millions of lives (Jews and others) and billions in 
military costs and destruction. We are at that exact point now with Saddam 
Hussein and Iraq. Appeasement didn't work then and it won't work now. 
</P>
<P>
It is everyone's responsibility, including the United States. It is not just a 
question of oil and greed. This man Hussein must be stopped now. Not to do so 
now is risking a mass worldwide conflagration and destruction that will exceed 
that of World War II. I am not a great fan of President Bush, but I think he is 
is on the right path in this situation.

BUSH VISITS U.S. TROOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is this President and his policies for real? Stupid me, I thought our commander 
in chief went to Saudi Arabia Thanksgiving Day to cheer up our troops. Now we 
find that (Nov. 21) Bush's appearance before handpicked troops against a 
custom-painted backdrop -- the whole scenario choreographed by former Las Vegas 
advertising exec Sig Rogich no less -- was designed for only one purpose: To 
pick up Bush's sagging image and to make him look good for the TV cameras. All 
the while, the grunts who stand to die as soon as the shooting starts are 
carefully shunted aside.

BUSH VISITS U.S. TROOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Krauthammer's pungent column "Why Go After Hussein? It's as Easy as 
A-B-C" (Column Right, Commentary, Nov. 26) is the most incisive and 
perspicacious argument yet for why Hussein must be harshly dealt with and 
removed from Kuwait, even if it means an all-out attack by military forces. It 
is fervently hoped that President Bush and his advisers read this extremely 
important article.

The picture on the front page of your Thanksgiving edition showing President 
Bush laughing with Saudi King Fahd was obscene. To see Bush laughing with the 
oil king of Saudi Arabia, when he has ordered thousands of young Americans to 
die in the desert, as he prepares to unleash a horrifying war that may include 
chemical and nuclear bombs, is disgusting. Shame!

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TUXEDO-CLAD GUNMEN ROB ENCINO BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three gunmen dressed in tuxedos robbed an Encino bank Friday afternoon and one 
accidentally shot himself in the hand while grabbing a bag of cash from a 
frightened teller, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
A security device in the money bag may have exploded as the men fled, staining 
their clothes and skin red, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers, armed with handguns, entered the Independence Bank branch in the 
15000 block of Ventura Boulevard at 3:35 p.m., Sgt. Jim Grayson said. "One of 
the tellers froze and panicked," Grayson said, and the robber "yelled 
profanities, demanding that she give him the money." 
</P>
<P>
As he reached behind the counter for a money bag, he accidentally shot himself 
in the hand, Grayson said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers, described as black, ages 25 to 35, fled in a waiting vehicle. 
Police would not say how much money was taken.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SLIPS OFF CLIFF, FALLS 150 FEET TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Calabasas man slipped off a cliff near Topanga Canyon Road and fell 150 feet 
to his death, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
John Emerson Woodson, 45, and his wife, Linda, were driving north on the 
winding road about two miles north of Pacific Coast Highway at 5:30 p.m. 
Thursday when Woodson told his wife to pull to the side, Deputy Britta Rodela 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He told his wife he had go to the bathroom," Rodela said. "When he didn't 
return 10 minutes later she looked for him and didn't find him." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Woodson drove to a nearby fire station and a search was begun. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Mountain Rescue Team found 
Woodson's body at the bottom of the cliff. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide detectives classified the death as accidental, Rodela said.

MORNING BRIEFING: THEIR ALTERNATIVE PLAN INCLUDES PI IN THE FACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After Georgia Tech had clinched the Atlantic Coast Conference football title 
with a victory over Wake Forest, Atlanta Journal columnist Terence Moore razzed 
the Yellow Jackets. 
</P>
<P>
Moore chided them as poor representatives of such a prestigious academic 
institution. Why, he wondered, couldn't they come up with a game-ending 
celebration more imaginative than "this Gatorade thing?" 
</P>
<P>
But Tech offensive lineman Joe Siffri argued: "This wasn't just any old dumping 
of the Gatorade on the coach's head. We've got several engineering majors on 
the team, so we did some calculations before we proceeded. We figured out the 
exact velocity of the wind, for instance. We were able to douse our coaches at 
the appropriate angle to provide the maximum amount of coldness for our 
victims."

Trivia time: Who was the first junior to win the Heisman Trophy? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talk about defense: For 50 years, Norah and Muriel Mason have lived in a 
two-bedroom house adjacent to the 40,000-seat stadium that is home to the 
Liverpool soccer team, which has won 18 league titles and has four victories in 
the European Champions Cup. 
</P>
<P>
In the 12 years since the team bought the street adjoining the stadium in hopes 
of expanding the facility, the women have turned down 15 offers of alternative 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
During that period, the team has demolished the street, and the Mason sisters' 
house now sits in the middle of the stadium parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the team took the matter to Liverpool County Court. Wednesday, the 
sisters agreed to move out by the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No ordinary yawner: All the NFL's British friends will be taking naps Monday so 
they can stay awake when Tuesday Morning Football presents the New York Giants 
and the San Francisco 49ers at 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
It will be "Monday Night Football's" debut in England, and Channel 4 spokesman 
Steve Pinder said: "The genuine fans are going to stay up for it." 
</P>
<P>
Pinder said he thought some fans would watch the beginning and tape the rest, 
but he was enthusiastic about the pre-showdown mood: "It will be like 
Liverpool-Arsenal in the English Soccer League. I think that's the feeling 
people have for this game." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spicy Fry: Coach Hayden Fry of Rose Bowl-bound Iowa has a lot to be proud of 
this season, but he was absolutely gloating recently over his big victory 
against Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
SI's Douglas S. Looney, preparing for Iowa's game against Illinois, planned a 
trip to Iowa City. Fry told Jim Ecker of the Cedar Rapids Gazette: 
</P>
<P>
"I had the thrill of telling Sports Illustrated, 'Don't come in, because you're 
not going to get any interviews.' I've been waiting a long time to do that." 
</P>
<P>

Trivia answer: Halfback Doc Blanchard of Army, in 1945. 
</P>
<P>

Quotebook: George Allen, Cal State Long Beach football coach, writing in Sports 
Illustrated that players hadn't changed since he began coaching in 1948: "About 
the only difference I noticed was that when I read my Long Beach players part 
of a speech by Theodore Roosevelt, most of them didn't know who Roosevelt was. 
So later, when I referred to Churchill, I said, 'Winston Churchill, who was the 
prime minister of Great Britain. . . . ' " TED BROCK

In a recent story, John Shaw stated that "management would take some major 
actions" if the Rams' record does not improve. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of fueling speculation regarding the future of John Robinson, Shaw's 
statement gave me hope that Georgia Frontiere will finally sell the team. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Georgia can buy a chain of beauty shops with the profits she makes from 
the sale of the Rams. We'll never have another Super Bowl team until we have a 
Super Bowl-type owner and management.

After suffering through another USC loss to an overrated Notre Dame team, I 
have come to the belief that Larry Smith is a Big Ten coach masquerading as a 
Pac-10 coach. 
</P>
<P>
I question a game plan that does not attack the most vulnerable part of a 
defense. The weakest link of the Irish defense is the secondary. So what 
happens? Not one deep pass. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Smith should realize that the lack of a deep passing game will prevent 
the Trojans from winning any national championship.

NORTH CAROLINA UPSET BY SOUTH CAROLINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was guaranteed that a Carolina team would win at the Tournament of Champions 
Friday night at Charlotte, N.C., but most people figured that the winning team 
would be wearing North Carolina blue, not South Carolina red. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Glover scored on a layup with eight seconds left and South Carolina 
celebrated the one-night renewal of arivalry with a 76-74 upset of No. 4 North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
George Lynch's follow shot with 1:54 left gave the Tar Heels (2-1) a 72-68 
lead. Joe Rhett made the first of two free throws with 1:07 left, but when he 
missed the second, the Gamecocks (3-1) got the rebound and Barry Manning made a 
three-point basket with 49 seconds left to make the score 72-72. 
</P>
<P>
The Tar Heels' Hubert Davis made two free throws with 35 seconds left to break 
the tie, but North Carolina committed turnovers on successive possessions. 
Chris Leso's layup with 23 seconds to play made the score 74-74 before Glover 
made the winning shot. 
</P>
<P>
The game was the first between the rivals since the Tar Heels beat the 
Gamecocks, 92-69, in the 1972 NCAA tournament East Regional finals. They hadn't 
met in the regular season since South Carolina withdrew from the Atlantic Coast 
Conference in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
No. 19 Southern Mississippi 84, No. 6 Alabama 82 -- Clarence Weatherspoon made 
a jump shot with 34 seconds left to give the Golden Eagles the upset victory at 
Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Weatherspoon, who scored 15 points and had 15 rebounds, made the decisive 
basket after James Robinson made a jumper for Alabama with 1:01 left to cut the 
margin to 82-81. 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans 60, No. 16 Virginia 55 -- A three-point basket by Dwight Myvette 
started a 9-0 run that gave the Privateers a 55-45 lead with 3:32 left and they 
made five of six free throws in the final 1:02 to win at Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans outrebounded the Cavaliers, 44-22. The Privateers also blocked 
eight shots as the Cavaliers made only 17 of 53 field goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
John Crotty led Virginia with 25 points. Tank Collins, a junior from Pomona 
High, scored 16 points for New Orleans. Myvette, from Crenshaw High, had 10 
points. 
</P>
<P>
No. 17 Georgia 70, Armstrong State 54 -- The Bulldogs (4-0) shot only 46.3%, 
but it was enough to handle the Pirates at Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
Litterial Green's two free throws with 59 seconds left gave Georgia its biggest 
lead, 70-52. 
</P>
<P>
No. 20 Louisiana State 101, No. 22 Texas 87 -- Despite sitting out 9:43 of the 
second half because of foul trouble, center Shaquille O'Neal had 26 points, 18 
rebounds and five blocked shots to lead the Tigers at Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal had 16 points and 17 rebounds at halftime, then picked up his third and 
fourth personal fouls on two quick charging calls. Joey Wright had 30 points 
for the Longhorns. 
</P>
<P>
No. 21 St. John's 66, Niagara 49 -- Poor shooting in the first half (five for 
28) combined with eight steals by the Redmen helped put the Purple Eagles out 
of the game early at Niagara Falls, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
St. John's got the game's first six points off Niagara turnovers. Malik Sealy 
scored 10 of the Redmen's next 17 points as the lead grew to 27-8 with 4:03 
left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
REGIONAL HIGHLIGHTS / TOURNAMENTS 
</P>
<P>
George Washington 81, Stanford 70 -- The Cardinal pulled to within two points 
of the Colonials at 64-62 with 7:24 left on two free throws by Adam Keefe, but 
Alvin Pearsall made a jump shot and Dirkk Surles made three consecutive baskets 
and two free throws for George Washington in the first round of the Apple 
Invitational at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Surles, a sophomore guard, scored 29 points to lead the Colonials. Keefe scored 
28 points. 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH 
</P>
<P>
Florida 85, Florida State 68 -- Lon Kruger got his first victory as Florida's 
coach after two close losses to South Florida and Texas, and the Gators won 
their first game in six years at Tallahassee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Livingston Chatman scored 17 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama Birmingham 71, Auburn 65 -- The Blazers used a 23-6 run midway through 
the second half to take control at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
One of Andy Kennedy's five three-point baskets put the Blazers (3-0) ahead for 
good at 45-44 with 10:40 to play. Kennedy then scored 13 of his 27 points 
during the run.

BRADLEY SLIPS PAST LOYOLA, 99-97; 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE TOURNAMENT: LIONS DROP TO 1-3 AFTER WASTING A 12-POINT LEAD IN THE FIRST 
HALF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Forward Andy Bastock made a high-arching shot in the lane with five seconds to 
play Friday night, giving Bradley a 99-97 victory over Loyola Marymount in the 
opening game of the Freedom Bowl Classic at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped Loyola to 1-3 and put the Lions in tonight's consolation game 
at 6. Bradley improved to 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
The depleted Lions, who were missing two starters and a key reserve because of 
injuries controlled the game early and took a 12-point lead. But Bradley turned 
cut that to 59-56 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley tried a zone defense in the second half, successfully closing down 
Loyola's outside game, and took a 16-point lead midway through the half. But 
Loyola then scored eight consecutive points in the next 1:11, and eventually 
took a 91-90 lead on Terrell Lowery's layup off a steal with 3:59 to play. 
Lowery led Loyola with 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
The lead changed hands five more times before Loyola's Brian McCloskey made one 
of two free throws with 48 seconds left. Bradley held the ball and called a 
timeout with 12 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
"When they called the timeout it was lucky for us," Loyola Coach Jay Hillock 
said. "We got a hand on the (inbounds) ball. Close, close." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, trying to run a play for Curtis Stuckey, who had 33 points, lost 
control of the inbounds pass. But in the scramble, Bradley center Xanthus 
Houston came up with the ball and passed to Bastock. Bastock dribbled into the 
lane and scored the last of his 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
"When I shot it I was concerned about getting blocked so I put a lot of arc on 
it," Bastock said. "It felt good when I let it go and it felt great when I saw 
it go through." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hillock: "We played better than in Maui (in a tournament), but we had some 
lapses. We're still hurting ourselves in phases of the game. . . . We're not 
playing as well in the second half."

STANFORD RALLIES, BEATS LONG BEACH WOMEN, 79-72 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach was playing its second consecutive game against a top-10 
opponent, the defending NCAA champion -- one that had already lost its opener, 
badly. 
</P>
<P>
So it was no surprise that probability caught up with the 49ers at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford came back from a 10-point first-half deficit to win its first game of 
the season, 79-72. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal had lost by 15 points last week to No. 6 Tennessee and the 49ers 
had upset No. 7 Texas, 80-74. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I think this game was won in practice this week," Stanford Coach 
Tara VanDerveer said. "We were embarrassed last week in Tennessee. I saw a 
different commitment from everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Said Long Beach Coach Joan Bonvicini: "I was disappointed in our turnovers, 
which I think doubled in the second half (the 49ers had 13 in each half). We 
outrebounded them, 67-35 -- that's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
So thought the screaming crowd of 1,749, who watched as the Cardinal, sparked 
by the inside play of forward Julie Zeilstra, tied the game, 43-43, with 16:33 
remaining after trailing, 41-36, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford came back by applying more pressure in the second half, thus 
effectively shutting down the 49er fast break, which VanDerveer calls "the best 
in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore guard Molly Goodenbour -- who scored a career-high 14 points -- made 
the first of three key three-point baskets with 13:46 to go, and the Cardinal 
led the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Zeilstra led all scorers with 22 points. Center Val Whiting had 17 points and 
nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach was led by guard Trise Jackson with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Penny Moore had 16 rebounds and Kari Parriott had 14.

Lisa Leslie, despite foul trouble that kept her on the bench for about half the 
game, scored 16 points and grabbed eight rebounds as the Trojans beat Old 
Dominion, 72-61, in the first round of the Roger White Invitational basketball 
tournament Friday at Northwestern University at Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second half, we stuck to our game plan," said Coach Marianne Stanley, 
who had a particular reason to make a good impression. 
</P>
<P>
She came to the Trojans (2-0) after coaching at Old Dominion. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a good game plan in wanting to keep the ball away from Lisa. She 
didn't really get into her game with quick fouls." 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Story had 18 points and four assists for the No. 24-ranked Trojans.

USC plays 14th-ranked Northwestern, a 74-52 winner over Syracuse, in tonight's

FACES . . . : PICARDO RELIES ON 'WONDER YEARS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIBBY SLATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a time when 85% of Screen Actors Guild members are unemployed, Robert 
Picardo at least has something better than a day job to fall back on. ABC this 
week put "China Beach" on hiatus -- that's networkese for "all but canceled" -- 
so Picardo's Vietnam Army surgeon Dick Richard is now on semi-permanent 
R&amp;R. 
</P>
<P>
But Picardo is still working in prime time as gym coach Ed Cutlip on "The 
Wonder Years." And this summer he racked up credits in two hit films, providing 
the voice and likeness for the robotic cab driver in "Total Recall" and 
appearing in the flesh in "Gremlins 2: The New Batch." 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for someone who initially aspired to be a doctor -- until Leonard 
Bernstein, whom Picardo met while appearing in a Yale student production of the 
composer's "Mass," provided some influential career counseling. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd always done acting strictly for fun," Picardo, 36, says. "Bernstein 
encouraged me to go into performing, which gave me the courage to give up my 
pre-med career." He went on to leading Broadway roles in "Gemini" and 
"Tribute," television work including a recurring role on "Alice," and 
appearances in such films as "The Howling" and "Innerspace." 
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia native's current TV bonanza came about when Coach Cutlip, a 
guest shot he did before being cast in "China Beach," proved popular enough to 
become a recurring role, an opportunity he accepted with the blessings of 
"China Beach's" executive producers. 
</P>
<P>
Having sometimes gone from the set of the sweetly nostalgic "Wonder Years" to 
the intensely dramatic "China Beach" in the same day, the actor says that the 
hardest aspect of switching roles is that "it taxes your listening. The coach 
doesn't listen to anyone, whereas on 'China Beach,' the camera often focuses 
not on who's talking, but on who's hearing." 
</P>
<P>
"The season before last, I was simultaneously shooting a 'Wonder Years' episode 
where I was hit on the head by a basketball, (for which he was Emmy-nominated) 
and the heaviest 'China Beach' episode, where my character's wife sent him 
notice she's divorcing him. I'd work on the 'China Beach' script in a little 
room, spilling my guts, and then have to go walking around with 12-year-olds 
bouncing basketballs off my head. I was struck by the absurdity of it."LIBBY

DISPUTE OVER TBS ABORTION PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Rick Du Brow's Nov. 10 column about the protest against Turner Broadcasting 
System's Dec. 7 documentary, "Abortion Denied: Shattering Young Women's Lives": 
</P>
<P>
The tirade by Nellie Gray of the March for Life and Rep. Robert Dornan against 
Ted Turner's TBS channel station for not having a panel discussion after the 
program is typical of the moral and intellectual dishonesty of the 
fundamentalist/far-right movement. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that Turner is guilty of being one-sided, they conveniently overlook 
how one-sided their own beloved Trinity Broadcasting Network is. 
</P>
<P>
TBN broadcasts 24-hour-a-day, mind-numbing propaganda that exhorts viewers to 
wage Christian warfare against society. It offers virtually no balance. 
</P>
<P>
There is no "other side" for these "bozos," as Turner aptly referred to them. 
Ted, bozos is too kind a characterization.

KID BEAT: 'HOLIDAY IN OZ' A TREAT IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's Sherwood Forest and the Land of Oz as you've never seen them. Where Friar 
Tuck sings "I've Got Plenty of Mutton" and Prince John calls a booing audience, 
" 'orrible looking peasants." Where Dorothy sings the theme song from "Annie" 
and takes offense when asked to oil the Tin Man -- "I beg your pardon, we 
haven't even been properly introduced." 
</P>
<P>
"Holiday in Oz" at the Pasadena Playhouse is a little bit naughty, hugely wacky 
and a howl of an evening for preschoolers, grandparents and everyone in 
between. It could be the perfect antidote to a surfeit of seasonal sweetness. 
</P>
<P>
Performed by two exceedingly talented comic actors -- Steve Cassling and B.J. 
Turner of the Hampstead Players, the show is done in the style of traditional 
English pantos, a sort of madcap, fairy tale vaudeville with lots of 
cross-dressing. This is its third holiday season at the Playhouse, but this 
time it's made a happy transition from the small Balcony Theatre to the 
mainstage. 
</P>
<P>
In a fairy-tale picture book setting (by Peggy Ebright), Turner and Cassling 
romp through two classics of literature, playing all the parts, male and 
female. 
</P>
<P>
The audience gets into the act in a big way. Onstage volunteers -- shy but 
willing little boys and girls and a few game adults -- play the tornado, scary 
animals, outlaws and magic poppies. The rest of the audience is encouraged to 
clap, yell, cheer and "woof" for Toto, boo, hiss and generally undermine the 
bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
Turner wrote, directed and designed the costumes, and is unforgettable as 
vamping King John, gluttonous Friar Tuck, and pig-tailed Dorothy, who looks as 
if she'd be at home smoking a cigar and reading the Racing Form. He also 
rollicks through the roles of Sheriff and the Wicked Witch "of West Hollywood" 
and makes an eye-popping Mrs. Santa Claus. (Santa appears as himself.) 
</P>
<P>
Handsome Cassling, blissfully plays against type as Glinda the Good in pink 
tutu and blond wig, as Robin Hood singing a hot rendition of "Rockin' Robin," 
and as Prince John's rappin' Fool. He shines as the Tin Man, the Scarecrow, the 
Cowardly Lion and the Wizard. 
</P>
<P>
Music director Marc Fitch, with percussionist Robert Beck, deserves equal 
applause for his cleverly conceived show tune medleys and musical punctuation. 
Ditto for Kevin Mahan's warm and cool lighting design. 
</P>
<P>
It's a long show for the youngest -- over two hours -- but most at opening 
night seemed eager to stay the distance. As zany as events become, Cassling and 
Turner remain in control, treat their small audience volunteers with 
affectionate reassurance and inject just the right amount of sentiment to wrap 
things up. 
</P>
<P>
 At 39 S. El Molino Ave. through Dec. 30, Wednesday-Sunday and Dec. 4 at 7:30

SANDERLING'S MAHLER WITH L.A. PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Mahler's works have become standard repertory through the last generation, 
they have become oddly homogenized. The composer's character as the eternal 
angry young man has been exaggerated, while his music has been increasingly 
reduced to hyper-romantic stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
Trust Kurt Sanderling, the Los Angeles Philharmonic's grand old man of the 
central European tradition, to right things. Seldom has Mahler the man sounded 
saner and his music more radical than in Sanderling's Ninth Symphony, as 
presented Thursday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderling's approach, at least for the first three movements, was to banish 
conventional integration. Let the instrumental colors clash rather than blend. 
Let the transitions jerk violently, and leave the contrapuntal thickets 
unpruned. 
</P>
<P>
The results restored the uncompromising originality of the music in purely 
sonic terms. This was high-risk Mahler, flirting with discontinuity and aural 
overload at almost every turn. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the interpretive effect remained emotionally centered -- earthy, vibrantly 
physical and filled with positive energy. Gone for the most part was the 
embittered mockery and metaphysical Angst many conductors find omnipresent 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Sanderling's Ninth was knowing, satirical and often exultant. Outraged 
at times, to be sure, and shadowed with the certainty of mortality, but never 
defeatist. 
</P>
<P>
The finale became an impassioned hymn, richly layered with subtexts but 
ultimately poised in finality rather than swoony or shattered. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderling elicited playing of impressionistic vividness from the Philharmonic. 
The inventiveness of Mahler's scoring is a commentary commonplace, but not 
often made so apparent in performance. 
</P>
<P>
This was not Mahler for apologists, and the orchestra presented it with raucous 
conviction, sometimes strident and mistuned but never inhibited. For three 
movements the strings were almost totally buried except in sectional solos, but 
emerged in ripe, tensile glory in the Adagio. 
</P>
<P>
Mahler could -- probably should -- have stood alone. Sanderling, though, 
attached a quirky prefix in the form of Haydn's Symphony No. 39. 
</P>
<P>
Contrast was clearly the aim here. But although Sanderling sharply downsized 
the band and included a seldom audible harpsichord, this was not Haydn for the 
period purist. 
</P>
<P>
Basically a sectional concerto for the first violins, this retro Baroque 
symphony was given unexceptional direction, and not surprisingly proved 
soft-grained and largely monochromatic in execution. 
</P>
<P>
This program, the final one of Sanderling's current three-week engagement, has 
its last performance Sunday afternoon. JOHN HENKEN

BROWN LEADS L.A. CHAMBER ORCHESTRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD S. GINELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Into her fourth season at the helm of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, Iona 
Brown seems to be staying on her original programming course, concentrating her 
attention mainly on the 18th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Wednesday's program at Ambassador Auditorium was to have included a 
peek into our century with Tippett's "Fantasia on a Theme of Corelli" and a 
Stephen Hartke string orchestra version of a J. S. Bach fugue. Instead, good 
old unvarnished Bach in the form of two well-traveled violin concertos was 
substituted. So much for enterprise this time. 
</P>
<P>
At first, some mild storm signals went up in the Vivaldi Concerto Grosso Opus 
3, No. 11. Though the its straight-ahead performance had an adequate degree of 
rhythmic bounce, the orchestra sounded tentative, with some surprisingly ragged 
entrances, and Brown was sometimes a bit out of tune in her solos from the 
first violin chair. 
</P>
<P>
Soloing in front of the group in the Bach Violin Concerto No. 2 in E, Brown did 
not actually hit her stride until the second movement, where the tuning 
problems fell away and her tone took on a more full-bodied texture. The 
orchestra, however, continued to sound as if it were merely going through the 
motions. 
</P>
<P>
While Nathaniel Rosen hasn't quite become the cello superstar that many 
predicted when he won the 1978 Tchaikovsky Competition, he certainly has grown 
as a musician since those publicity-mad days. In the Boccherini Cello Concerto 
in B-Flat -- using the Friedrich Grutzmacher arrangement -- he generated 
probing intensity, some rough-hewn ferocity of tone and a wider dynamic range 
in general than one remembered, despite some early unsteadiness. 
</P>
<P>
Fully alert in the Boccherini, the orchestra could now provide a focused, 
lively accompaniment for Brown and concertmaster Ralph Morrison in the 
concluding Bach Concerto for Two Violins. Here the two soloists offered some 
contrasts in temperament -- Brown more forthright and ever-so-slightly Romantic 
in approach; Morrison more reticent, with an attractively limpid tone. RICHARD

According to the artistic director of the society, Jeff von der Schmidt, the 
piece -- for piano and prepared tape -- invokes church bells ringing throughout 
Venice. The live piano part typically exploits a single range at a time, 
occasionally two very separate sections of the keyboard, while tape and piano 
mingle as expansions of one another. 
</P>
<P>
In the capable hands of pianist Gloria Cheng, accompanied by a tape of Pollini, 
". . . sorrowful yet serene waves . . ." emerged as a series of clusters slowly 
evolving in nervous rhythms. Cheng's minute exploration of the sonic and 
rhythmic possibilities of her instrument demanded and received an attentive 
hush for its full 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven's Sonata for piano and cello, Opus 102, No. 2, and his "Ghost" Trio 
flanked the contemporary work. Both gave ample opportunity to their 
protagonists -- violinist Peter Marsh, cellist Richard Treat and pianist Cheng 
-- to wring out every drop of Angst appropriate to this program. 
</P>
<P>
The trio, in particular, thrived amidst a larger-than-life conception marked by 
pristine rhythmic precision and lean, pointed tone. Opening movements of each 
opus commanded an exciting sense of competition. 
</P>
<P>
Ensemble members paid rapt attention to one another, indulging in relentlessly 
intense soul-searching for the Largo of the trio, charging forward through 
dynamically shaped phrases propelled by emphatic accents in the Presto. 
</P>
<P>
Only in the Adagio of the cello sonata did ensemble seem less than flawless. 
Here, much of the repartee between the duo passed unnoticed, though, 
individually, the players remained involved and absorbing. SUSAN BLISS

The Rev. Robert W. Edgar, who served as a congressman for 12 years, will be 
formally installed Tuesday as the new president of the School of Theology at 
Claremont. Rather than a retreat into a seminary ivory tower, however, Edgar 
has indicated his continuing interest in political and moral issues. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Edgar advised officials at the National Council of Churches meeting 
in Portland, Ore., on strategies to obtain more influence with the White House 
and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the liberal reputation of the National Council, Edgar said in an 
interview that he thought it was "a pretty bold action" for the ecumenical body 
in Portland to adopt unanimously a resolution urging the Bush Administration to 
reduce substantially the troops in Saudi Arabia and to launch negotiations to 
embrace all Middle East problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The council could have just as easily been timid, given the decline of the 
mainline churches in the 1980s and the resurgence of conservative churches," 
Edgar said. "This is a signal that mainline churches should speak up on issues 
of concern when they feel so moved." 
</P>
<P>
Edgar began his duties at the United Methodist-run school in July, succeeding 
Richard W. Cain, who retired. Edgar had served Methodist pastorates before 
being elected to Congress from the Philadelphia area in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
He chose Rep. William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), the House majority whip and a 
Baptist clergyman, as keynote speaker for his 10:30 a.m. inauguration service 
on the lawn in front of the seminary's Kresge Chapel. Edgar and Gray were among 
half a dozen clergy serving in the House or the Senate during the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The inaugural events at the Claremont campus stretch over three days, starting 
at 6:30 p.m. Monday with an Advent festival of carols at the Kresge Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday following the inaugural ceremony, public lectures will be given 
during the lunch hour and a panel discussion on the future of theological 
education will be held at 4 p.m. in the Mudd Theater. The final event is a 
chapel service at 11:45 a.m. Wednesday, featuring retired United Methodist 
Bishop James K. Mathews. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CONVENTION 
</P>
<P>
Episcopal Bishop Frederick H. Borsch of Los Angeles will give his 
state-of-the-diocese address during today's 8:30 a.m. Eucharist at the 
diocese's annual convention in the Riverside Convention Center. This is the 
first time in its 95-year history that the diocese, which embraces 148 parishes 
in six counties, has convened in Riverside. Delegates to the two-day 
convention, which is scheduled to close at 5 p.m. today, will vote on a 
proposed $3.3-million program budget for 1991 and consider several resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INTERFAITH 
</P>
<P>
Steps taken in California to introduce more teaching about religious history in 
public schools will be discussed by a tri-faith panel at 7:30 p.m. Monday at 
Temple Beth Am in Los Angeles under the sponsorship of the Jewish Federation 
Council's Community Relations Committee. Panelists will be Shabbir Mansuri of 
the Islamic Center of Southern California, Pastor Peter Pettit of Hope Lutheran 
Church and Rabbi Joel Rembaum of Temple Beth Am. 
</P>
<P>
A "trialogue" on Jewish, Christian and Islamic beliefs will be conducted at 7 
p.m. Wednesday at the Islamic Society of Orange County building in Garden 
Grove. The speakers are Rabbi David Gordis, vice president of the University of 
Judaism; the Rev. George Grose of Long Beach First Presbyterian Church and Imam 
Muzammil Siddiqi, director of the host society. JOHN DART

BARKLEY EJECTED IN 76ERS' LOSS TO PISTONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The elbow was thrown at Detroit's Dennis Rodman. No one questions that, and the 
effort was enough to get Charles Barkley of the Philadelphia 76ers ejected from 
Friday night's game at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
But what did it hit? There was 7:32 to play when referee Darrel Garretson 
tossed Barkley out of a game that was tied, 77-77. Rodman made two free throws 
on the play, and the Pistons went on to win their 10th in a row, 96-94. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't really connect," Rodman said of Barkley's elbow. "If it did, it 
barely hit me. But, everyone knows the rule." 
</P>
<P>
Barkley, who had 22 points and seven rebounds, was upset with Garretson. 
</P>
<P>
"Watch the tape and see for yourself so you can laugh," Barkley said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodman was guarding Barkley when Barkley threw the elbow, apparently to ward 
him off. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Barkley scored 17 points and the 76ers built a 56-41 lead. 
</P>
<P>
As late as the last two minutes of the third quarter, the 76ers still led, 
71-56. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Dumars and the Piston defense led the charge back into the game. Dumars had 
16 of his 24 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons won it when both Bill Laimbeer and Vinnie Johnson made one out of 
two free throws in the closing seconds. In between the missed free throws, 
Philadelphia's Hersey Hawkins missed a 17-footer. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 123, Washington 95 -- At Boston, Larry Bird became the 15th player to 
score 20,000 points, and the Celtics streaked to their eighth consecutive 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics are 12-2 and 8-0 since Coach Chris Ford put 6-foot-5 Kevin Gamble 
in the lineup at small forward and shifted Bird to the power spot. 
</P>
<P>
Bird, only the fifth player to get 20,000 points and 5,000 assists, had 21 
points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jerry West, Oscar Robertson and John Havlicek also had 
20,000 points and 5,000 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 101, Atlanta 93 -- Brad Daugherty had 30 points at Atlanta and the 
Cavaliers handed the Hawks their ninth loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks fell apart in the third quarter, scoring only 11 points after leading 
throughout the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland took the lead for good, 76-74, on a 16-foot jump shot by Larry Nance 
with 15 minutes left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 124, Indiana 95 -- Michael Jordan made 10 of his 11 shots in the first 
quarter to score 20 of his 37 points and help the Bulls build a 41-24 lead on 
the way to their fourth victory in a row. Wednesday he was seven for seven in 
the first quarter and the Bulls routed Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 119, Orlando 113 -- Chris Mullin had 28 points, and Mitch Richmond 
scored nine points in the fourth quarter at Orlando as the Warriors handed the 
Magic their sixth loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond's turnaround jump shot broke a 109-109 tie and gave the Warriors the 
lead for good with two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 103, New York 97 -- Alvin Robertson had a triple-double at Milwaukee 
and the Bucks handed the Knicks their fifth loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson had 17 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks held Patrick Ewing to 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 96, Minnesota 79 -- Jeff Malone scored 14 of his 19 points in the third 
quarter at Salt Lake City to help the Jazz break open the game. It was the 
fifth victory in a row for Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Although he made only six of 17 field goal attempts, Utah's Karl Malone had 13 
rebounds. DAN HAFNER

Loreto Garza and Vinny Pazienza, two junior-welterweights who aspire to fight 
super-lightweight champion Julio Cesar Chavez, will meet in a small-scale 
pay-per-view boxing show at Arco Arena tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Garza and Pazienza figure to attract about 8,000 tonight, which would figure as 
California's -- and Sacramento's -- second-largest boxing gate this year. On 
Sept. 22, Garza stablemate Tony Lopez drew a state-record gate of $601,000 and 
a crowd of 15,000-plus when he beat Jorge Paez at Arco Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Garza, who won the championship from Argentine Juan Coggi (who is on tonight's 
undercard) in Paris Aug. 17, is 27-1 with 23 knockouts. He hasn't lost since 
1983. Pazienza has a 33-4 record with 23 knockouts. EARL GUSTKEY

UC IRVINE KEEPS THE VOLUME HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They call this the Freedom Bowl Classic, and now you know why: Players are free 
to fire at will. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine didn't shoot well in its first-round game against Idaho State Friday 
night, but the Anteaters compensated for not shooting well by shooting often in 
a 96-82 victory at the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine will play Bradley for the tournament title tonight at 8. Loyola 
Marymount, which lost to Bradley, will play Idaho State in the consolation 
game. 
</P>
<P>
After shooting 38% in the first half and being tied at 42-42, Irvine pulled 
together in the second half and pulled away in the final five minutes, partly 
with the help of its defense. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine has devoted an extraordinary amount of practice time to shooting. To 
Coach Bill Mulligan's consternation, the results have been poor. The Anteaters 
averaged 102 points in their first three games, but they did it while making 
only 41% of their shots. 
</P>
<P>
The only reason they have been able to reach 100 points shooting at that rate 
is because they are averaging 86 shots, and 37 of them on the average are 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not shooting well," Mulligan said. "That's really hurting us." 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Butler, who scored 23 points, left with five minutes to play and Irvine 
leading, 78-72.

STOCKS SOAR ON HOPES FOR PEACE; DOW GAINS 40.84; 
</P>
<P>
WALL STREET: BLUE CHIPS HAVE RISEN 194.55 POINTS SINCE HITTING THEIR LOW FOR 
THE YEAR ON OCT. 11.

<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index jumped 40.84 points to 2,559.65 on Friday as the 
stock market read hope into President Bush's remarks that a peaceful settlement 
of the Persian Gulf crisis may still be possible. 
</P>
<P>
The market, which has traced a wobbly advance since Oct. 11, apparently took 
particular comfort from Bush's offer to send Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III to Baghdad and his invitation to Iraq's foreign minister to visit 
Washington, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow was up more than 50 points in mid-afternoon, tripping off restrictions 
on computer-directed program trading at the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the first real progress toward peace," said Chris Pedersen, director 
of trading at 21st Securities in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Also feeding the advance was a sharp drop in oil prices. In New York trading, 
the price of a barrel of the benchmark light sweet crude for January delivery 
fell $4.06 a barrel to $28.85. 
</P>
<P>
Traders noted that the decline pushed oil prices below the psychologically 
important $30-a-barrel mark. The bond market also rallied, lifting the price of 
the 30-year Treasury bond up more than $10 per $1,000 of face value. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a relatively heavy 192.35 million 
shares, compared to Thursday's 140.92 million. The Standard &amp; Poor's 
500-stock index climbed 5.80 points, or 1.83%, to 322.22. 
</P>
<P>
The move means that the Dow has risen about 194.55 points, or about 8%, since 
hitting its low for the year of 2,365.10 on Oct. 11. The Dow had fallen nearly 
635 points, or about 21%, from its all-time high of 2,999.75 to its Oct. 11 
low. 
</P>
<P>
In early trading Friday, stock prices drifted lower as investors read gloom 
into the resolution passed Thursday by the United Nations Security Council. The 
resolution, adopted by a 12-2 vote, authorizes the United States and its allies 
to expel the Iraqis from Kuwait by force after Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
But the markets read Bush's remarks at a mid-morning press conference as a sign 
that "he's willing to talk, and before now he really hasn't been," said Howard 
Berl, a trader at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Some investors also seemed to read hope for lower interest rates in Bush's 
remarks that the economy was "at best in a serious slowdown." 
</P>
<P>
Some technical analysts -- who try to predict the market's movements from a 
study of its internal dynamics -- argued that the Dow had crossed an important 
resistance point during the day. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Peroni, director of technical analysis at Janney Montgomery Scott in 
Philadelphia, said he believes that the bear market is now over and predicted 
that the Dow will trade between 2,530 and 2,665 over the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Others were less optimistic. Twenty First Securities' Pedersen said he believes 
that the market will remain strong in December, as investors try to snap up 
bargains, but will weaken early next year as the economy remains weak. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't expect it to come back too much until some of our basic industries 
start strengthening," Pedersen said. 
</P>
<P>
Among other indexes, the New York Stock Exchange composite index added 2.92 
points, or 1.72%, to 176.06. The NASDAQ composite index of over-the-counter 
stocks gained 3.31 points, or 0.9%, to 359.06. 
</P>
<P>
Market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
Among actively traded Big Board issues, General Electric jumped 1 5/8 to 54 
3/4, Philip Morris was up 5/8 at 48 5/8, Pepsi was up 5/8 at 25 5/8 and General 
Motors was down 1/2 at 36 1/2. Motorola tumbled 3 3/8 at 50 1/2; analysts had 
lowered their earnings estimate for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Oil stocks rose, and the airline sector got a strong boost from lower crude 
prices. AMR was up 3 at 47 1/4, Delta was up 2 3/4 at 56 3/4 and UAL was up 3 
5/8 at 97 1/2. Pharmaceutical issues also advanced, with Abbott Labs up 1 3/8 
at 43 5/8, Pfizer up 3 at 80 3/4 and Eli Lilly up 3/4 at 73 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks lost ground but closed well above their lows for the day, with 
the Nikkei index off 257.97 points at 22,454.63. In London, the Financial Times 
100-share index gained 13.8 points to end the session at 2,149.4. In Frankfurt, 
Germany, the 30-share DAX index climbed 22.31 points to 1,441.23.

LEADING INDICATORS FALL FOR 4TH MONTH, SIGNALING RECESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By OSWALD JOHNSTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government's chief barometer of future economic activity fell in October 
for the fourth straight month, the Commerce Department reported Friday, 
foretelling a recession that most economists believe has already started. 
</P>
<P>
The 1.2% plunge in the index of leading economic indicators came as Federal 
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan repeated his assertion that the economy 
is still not in a recession but he conceded that "it may get there." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts generally agree that three consecutive dips in the index mean that a 
recession is on the way, and the October drop followed declines of 0.8% and 
1.2% in September and August. In addition, the index for July was revised to a 
slight decline of 0.1% from the previously reported no change. 
</P>
<P>
Although President Bush and top Administration officials continue to avoid 
referring to the current slump as anything other than a "slowdown" or a 
"downturn," most economists now believe that a recession started last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"The leading indicators seem to be lagging a bit," said David Wyss, an analyst 
with DRI/McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm. "It's telling us 
recession is coming, when we've been in one for three months now." 
</P>
<P>
"The indicators failed to give us a signal ahead of time but rather at the same 
time we were falling into recession," added Bruce Steinberg, an economist with 
Merrill Lynch in New York. "This index doesn't tell us anything we don't know 
these days." 
</P>
<P>
One problem with the indicators as a forecasting tool is that virtually all of 
the 11 components chosen by the Bureau of Economic Analysis are reported 
individually as they are compiled and are extensively monitored by economic 
forecasters. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, economists did not need Friday's report to determine that the 
average workweek declined in October while unemployment compensation claims 
rose. Likewise, it was widely known that industrial commodity prices are 
falling, building permits have plunged, consumer confidence has crumbled, the 
stock market has fallen and the Federal Reserve has kept money fairly tight and 
interest rates fairly high. Yet all these are key components of the leading 
indicators. 
</P>
<P>
Government analysts noted that 8 of the 11 indicators included in the index 
were negative: consumer confidence, unemployment claims, the workweek, building 
permits, money supply, stocks, "sensitive materials prices" and vendor 
deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
Allen R. Sinai, an economist with Boston Co., said he now views the leading 
indicators as more of a ratification of current trends than a reliable guide to 
economic performance a quarter or two down the road. 
</P>
<P>
"Four down months in a row in the LEI is pretty definitive (of a recession), 
along with everything else we know about the economy," Sinai said. 
</P>
<P>
"This time around, the index is sinking at the same time that the economy is 
sinking," Sinai said. "In the old days, this would signal recession through the 
second quarter next year and perhaps into the third. But because of the changes 
in the structure of the economy, this report won't take it out that far." 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the index has fallen in six of 10 months -- another strong 
signal that a recession already has arrived. Even President Bush, speaking to 
reporters Friday, cited the damage inflicted on the economy by the Persian Gulf 
crisis. "Our economy," he said, ". . . is at best in a serious slowdown. And if 
uncertainty remains in the energy markets, the slowdown will get worse." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan made a similar point, speaking 
of "a meaningful downturn," while avoiding use of the word recession. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a business audience Thursday in Minneapolis, Greenspan elaborated 
slightly. "The overall economy is declining," the Fed chief said. "It has not 
yet reached a point where it is definable as a recession. It may get there."

All three U.S.-based auto makers appeared headed into the red for the fourth 
quarter as Ford Motor Co. reported Friday that it has slashed car and truck 
production for the second month in a row. 
</P>
<P>
On the heels of a major cutback by General Motors Corp., No. 2 Ford said it is 
carving 135,000 cars and trucks out of its North American factory schedules for 
the rest of the year. Atop a 31,000-vehicle cutback the month before, that adds 
up to a 17% cut from Ford's original production schedule for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Like GM, Ford said it was responding to a sharp falloff in dealer orders for 
new cars and trucks, the result of a steep decline in consumer confidence since 
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, GM trimmed 111,000 vehicles from its fourth-quarter schedule -- on 
top of a 182,000-vehicle cutback a few weeks earlier. For GM, that constituted 
a 19% cut from the initial quarterly production schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The cutbacks, which will shut down much of the domestic auto industry this 
month and temporarily lay off tens of thousands of workers, sent investment 
analysts back to the drawing board to further reduce financial forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
GM's loss for the quarter was put at up to $600 million, Ford was projected to 
lose more than $460 million, and Chrysler Corp., seen as hurting the least for 
the moment, would lose more than $15 million, according to various analysts. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Big Three auto companies fell into the red in the same 
quarter was in July-September, 1981, at the depth of the industry's most severe 
economic trauma since the Great Depression. In that quarter, they lost a 
combined $943 million. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph S. Phillippi, analyst at Shearson Lehman Bros. in New York, was cutting 
his earnings projections for the second time in 10 days. He said the production 
cuts have cleared away any doubts about the downturn facing the auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
Industry observers now agree that the seemingly healthy retail sales that have 
continued into November were inflated by sales to fleet customers and that 
underlying consumer demand has been weaker than total sales figures suggest. 
</P>
<P>
Ford officials say they are reacting to a decline in orders from dealers, who 
have noted a falloff in customer traffic and are anticipating a collapse in 
sales to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The dealers, meanwhile, are having trouble getting financing from nervous 
lenders to buy the vehicles in the first place, said Phillippi. "The banks are 
really squeezing the dealers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The pressure seemed to be having its effects in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler announced Friday that as of January, it will no longer report its car 
and truck sales every 10 days, which has been the industry practice for 
decades. Chrysler said it will report its sales monthly and has sounded out 
Ford and GM about taking the same action. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler described it as part of ongoing cost-cutting and said the 10-day 
reports are meaningless anyway. But the U.S. companies have been miffed about 
statistical peculiarities in the 10-day sales reports that make it look as if 
Japanese companies are doing better than they are. 
</P>
<P>
With Japanese production at plants in the United States still in its early 
stages, the Japanese companies are able to regularly report 50% and 100% sales 
gains by breaking out those vehicles from the sales of their cars produced 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
This masks the fact that their sales of imported cars, which still represent 
the bulk of sales by Japanese auto companies, are declining, Big Three 
officials complain. Reported just once a month, the decline in sales of 
imported vehicles tends to receive little press attention. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy has reached the highest levels. Bennett Bidwell, the vice 
chairman of Chrysler Motors, notified GM Chairman Robert C. Stempel and Ford 
Chairman Harold O. Poling by letter in early November of Chrysler's departure 
from tradition. 
</P>
<P>
A GM spokeswoman said the company is reviewing its own sales-reporting 
procedures, though not necessarily in response to Chrysler's action. Ford sales 
analyst Joel Pitcoff said his company has "no plans to emulate Chrysler at this 
time."

National Dairy Board Sued: A biotechnology watchdog charged in a lawsuit that 
the National Dairy Board is illegally promoting a growth hormone being used 
experimentally in cows to increase milk production. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Washington-based Foundation on Economic Trends, 
has used a variety of legal maneuvers to try to block the use of bovine growth 
hormone on the grounds that it is unsafe. He also petitioned the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration to "immediately halt any promotion of this product by FDA 
officials and to immediately rescind the use of this product in the marketplace 
until it is approved." Neither the FDA nor the dairy board had a comment.

REFORM OF FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS ESSENTIAL, BRADY CONTENDS

Top officials from both the Bush Administration and Wall Street declared Friday 
that major surgery is needed to treat the ills of the nation's banking and 
financial system. 
</P>
<P>
And they stepped up their calls for action by Congress to deal with financial 
problems they say go beyond the current slump in the economy and the savings 
and loan crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"The legal and regulatory structure of our financial system is outmoded, 
burdensome and inefficient," said Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, 
addressing the annual convention of the Securities Industry Assn., Wall 
Street's main trade group. "Fundamental reforms are needed." 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is not whether we should reform the financial system," asserted 
Richard C. Breeden, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. "The 
question is how." 
</P>
<P>
"We need to have a financial summit," said Gedale Horowitz, senior executive 
director of Salomon Bros. Inc., who took over Friday as chairman of the SIA for 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
Their statements came a day after President Bush indicated his support for a 
drive to rewrite the rules under which American banks, investment firms and 
other financial businesses operate. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury is working on a detailed proposal, due out in January, for changes 
in the financial laws. Bush said Thursday that he would take a "leadership 
role" in bringing the matter before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Among the prime subjects being examined is reform of the federal deposit 
insurance system, which has been cited by many observers as a key factor in the 
S&amp;L crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Brady also spoke Friday of giving close scrutiny to decades-old rules that set 
barriers between banks and brokerage firms, and that restrict interstate 
activities by banks. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects for early action on any of these ideas by Congress remain hazy, 
especially given the apparent onset of a recession and uncertainties raised by 
the showdown in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
But proponents of prompt action on financial reform say economic woes and 
competition from financial institutions based in other countries, among other 
things, are only likely to worsen the situation as time passes. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't bring about this change in 1991, then when?" Horowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day we read about layoffs in securities firms, another troubled bank, a 
higher estimate of the cost of the savings and loan bailout. Every day without 
financial systems reform costs American taxpayers more money."

Texas Thrift With Drexel Link Seized: Southmark Corp. said its San Jacinto 
Savings &amp; Loan Assn. subsidiary has been placed in conservatorship by the 
Office of Thrift Supervision. 
</P>

The Resolution Trust Corp. has been appointed conservator of the Houston-based 
thrift and has taken control of the institution's operations. San Jacinto fell 
short of federal capital requirements. The S&amp;L once was one of Michael 
Milken's best junk bond customers. With $3.25 billion in assets, the 
Houston-based S&amp;L was the largest troubled S&amp;L in Texas operating

ATKINS GIVEN PROBATION FOR ASHLAND SCAM

Orin E. Atkins, the former chairman of Ashland Oil Inc., was sentenced Friday 
to probation and community service for trying to sell confidential company 
documents to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Charles S. Haight of Manhattan said that although he felt 
Atkins had committed a serious crime, he decided prison time was not warranted 
because Atkins cooperated with prosecutors and agreed to pay restitution to 
Ashland. 
</P>
<P>
The restitution settlement, announced in court by Ashland attorney John C. 
Elam, calls for Atkins to forgo more than $2 million in consulting fees and 
pension benefits and repay $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Haight sentenced Atkins to two years' probation and 600 hours of community 
service. The judge imposed no additional fine, citing Atkins' diminished 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
Atkins, 66, of North Palm Beach, Fla., pleaded guilty in September, 1989, to 
conspiracy and wire fraud and agreed to cooperate with the government. 
</P>
<P>
He had faced a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Atkins admitted that after he resigned as chairman in 1981 but remained as a 
paid Ashland consultant, he obtained confidential documents involving the 
company's decision not to pay the National Iranian Oil Co. for $283 million in 
crude oil purchased in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it withheld payment because of a trade ban on Iran that the 
United States imposed following the taking of American hostages at the U.S. 
Embassy in Tehran in November, 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Atkins and others involved in the scheme offered to sell the documents to the 
Iranian company for use in a possible lawsuit against Ashland over its 
non-payment. 
</P>
<P>
The documents were offered at various times for $20 million or a 25% 
contingency fee. 
</P>
<P>
While the Iranians never bought the documents, they later sued Ashland and last 
year obtained a $325-million settlement, which with interest was worth more 
than $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the court before sentencing, Atkins described the 
embarrassment and anguish his acts caused his family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no excuses for my actions other than I think anger or some resentment 
obviously short-circuited my brain," Atkins said.

BOND PRICES SURGE ON PRESIDENT'S BID FOR MIDEAST PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bond prices soared Friday on sharply lower oil prices and a new drive by 
President Bush to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 1 1/16 point, or $10.63 per $1,000 
in face amount. Its yield plunged to 8.39% from 8.49% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
It was the long bond's biggest one-day gain in more than a month and brought 
interest rates to their lowest level since before Iraq invaded Kuwait. On Aug. 
1, the day before the invasion, the yield closed at 8.35%. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices shot up immediately after Bush's 11 a.m. announcement that he was 
sending Secretary of State James A. Baker III to Baghdad in a last-ditch 
overture to persuade Iraq to pull out of occupied Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Prices dropped back slightly as some traders decided to take quick profits but 
resumed the upward trend as oil prices also responded to Bush's remarks. Crude 
oil tumbled $4.06 cents a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold also 
fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Traders read the plunge in oil prices as an anti-inflationary sign that would 
make the Federal Reserve more likely to move to ease interest rates. Lower 
interest rates generally increase the value of government securities such as 
bonds. Inflation erodes the value of Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
Another sign that seemed to support a Fed move was the fourth straight monthly 
fall in the government's chief economic forecasting gauge, another sign of a 
recession that many economists believe already is under way. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 7.50%, down from 7.563% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal 
bonds closed at 91 1/2, up 5/32 point from late Thursday. The average yield to 
maturity was 7.47%, down from 7.48%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY: Dollar Declines on Bush's Remarks 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell against most major currencies following the President's 
announcement that he was sending Secretary of State Baker to Baghdad and 
inviting the Iraqi foreign minister to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the dollar soared ahead of passage of a U.N. resolution calling 
for use of force against Iraq if Baghdad did not withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 
15. 
</P>
<P>
Investors traditionally have turned to the U.S. currency as a "safe haven" in 
uncertain or politically tense times. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems less likely that we're headed toward war than yesterday (Thursday)," 
said Walter Simon at Julius Baer &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar bought 1.5020 German marks late in New York, off from 1.5040 late 
Thursday. It also fell against the Japanese yen, to 132.50 from 133.25 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The British pound edged down to $1.9430 in New York from $1.9435 late Thursday.

DE TREAUX; ACTRESS SHARED 'E.T' TITLE ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tamara De Treaux, 31-inch tall actress who shared the role of "E.T." in the 
famous Stephen Spielberg movie, has died. She was 31. 
</P>
<P>
Miss De Treaux died Wednesday at Medical Center of North Hollywood of 
respiratory problems and heart failure, her long-time friend, Ken Maley, said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Starting out in small theaters in San Francisco, Miss De Treaux joined the 
backup singing group called The Medflies in 1980. The group performed in San 
Francisco's Boarding House and Los Angeles' Comedy Store and Roxie. 
</P>
<P>
Spotted by Spielbeg's staff at the Roxie, she was hired to perform as the 
extraterrestrial creature after the original actor was injured. Although 
Spielberg had urged silence about who was or was not inside the special effects 
of E.T., Miss De Treaux publicly stated that she had played the lovable ugly 
little character in scenes that required movement, while a mechanical E.T. was 
used in closeups. 
</P>
<P>
Miss De Treaux also starred in the film "Ghoulies" as the character Greedigut, 
and "Rockula" as the character Bat Dork. She had recently completed work in 
"Love in Venice" due for release this month, and in "The Linguine Incident." 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by her mother, Barbara Detro, and a brother and a sister. 
</P>
<P>
Services are scheduled Tuesday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in North Hollywood.

NORTH COUNTY LANDFILL CRITICS URGE SUPERVISORS TO RECONSIDER REJECTED SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opponents of three proposed trash landfill sites in North County are mounting 
an eleventh-hour campaign intended to show that a better site was overlooked by 
the county staff. 
</P>
<P>
The critics say they have commissioned an independent engineering report 
showing that a site just north of Escondido would work far better as a landfill 
because it is much bigger than the ones being considered in Fallbrook, Pala and 
Warner Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The study will show that the Merriam Mountain site -- actually two sites, one 
north of Deer Springs Road and the other along the west side of Interstate 15 
-- can handle as much garbage as the Fallbrook and Pala sites combined, 
according to Jack Wireman, a member of the Fallbrook Community Planning Group. 
</P>
<P>
He and others say they hope the results of the study, by a Riverside County 
engineering firm, will be delivered to county supervisors Monday. On Tuesday, 
the board is scheduled to decide which of the current landfill-site candidates 
should be adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never too late to prevent an environmental disaster from happening, and 
to prevent the staff from stampeding the supervisors into a bad decision," 
Wireman said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the county's Department of Public Works say they already know the 
sites that make up Merriam Mountain have a tremendous garbage capacity, but 
that they were rejected from consideration as landfills because of reasons 
other than trash capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Giving critics a breath of hope was a request by Supervisor Brian Bilbray two 
weeks ago to have the staff give him more information on the Merriam Mountain 
site because of constant references to it by the critics of the other three 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
Those critics say the county vastly underestimated the garbage capacity of the 
Merriam Mountain site. 
</P>
<P>
The larger of the two sites is directly across the freeway from the Lawrence 
Welk Resort and its Champagne Village mobile home park, where nearly 1,000 
people live. Residents of the park complain that they would not only look 
directly into the bowels of the garbage dump, but would smell it and be 
inundated by its dirt, since they live directly downwind. 
</P>
<P>
The second site is just to the south of the Welk site and just north of the 
Golden Door spa on Deer Springs Road. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Door, the Lawrence Welk Resort and the mobile home park, as well as 
other homeowners in the region, already have hired a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like we're fighting a phantom because the Merriam Mountain site is not 
an official proposal," said Ray York, representing Welk, the Golden Door and 
area homeowners. "It's hard for us to realistically and factually present 
arguments opposed to something that is not even officially proposed yet. Yet, 
(the other landfill critics) keep hammering away at the benefits of these 
(Merriam Mountain) sites." 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary study commissioned by the county indicated that the site opposite 
the Lawrence Welk Resort had a capacity of about 20 million cubic yards, and 
that the site to the south could handle about 23 million cubic yards. 
</P>
<P>
Since the county's original screening process called for sites with capacities 
of at least 30 million cubic yards, those two sites were considered too small. 
</P>
<P>
A follow-up study by a different county consultant, however, found the Welk 
site capable of handling 92 million cubic yards of garbage, and the site closer 
to the Golden Door being able to handle 76 million cubic yards. 
</P>
<P>
The difference was a result of the second study identifying a higher ridge line 
in which to contain the trash, dramatically increasing the landfill's capacity. 
</P>
<P>
The private engineering study will essentially confirm the second county study, 
Wireman said. 
</P>
<P>
But Kathy Lehtola of the county public works department said that, even if 
those figures are correct, the site doesn't deserve to be under consideration 
because of other shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
The Merriam Mountain site was rejected because of access problems and the 
proximity of neighbors and, in the case of the Welk site, the lack of earth to 
cover the trash as it is dumped, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents say the site is no more likely to bother nearby residents than 
are the ones in Fallbrook and Pala, and that among its benefits are its 
proximity to the communities that generate most of the garbage, its location 
alongside the freeway, and that it doesn't jeopardize ground water, a possible 
problem at the other sites.

MEXICANS BLOCK BORDER SHOOTING PROBE, POLICE SAY; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: CALEXICO POLICE CHIEF ASSAILS MEXICANS FOR NOT ALLOWING AN 
INTERVIEW WITH A YOUTH WOUNDED BY BORDER PATROL. MEXICAN OFFICIALS SAY THE BOY 
ISN'T WELL ENOUGH. 
</P>

<P>
The increasingly bitter binational controversy over the U.S. Border Patrol 
shooting of a 15-year-old Mexican boy intensified Friday when the police chief 
in Calexico accused Mexican lawmen of refusing to allow U.S. authorities to 
interview the victim and otherwise thwarting the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials immediately denied the charges, contending that they were 
willing to cooperate with U.S. police, but that doctors were forbidding a 
police interview because of the youth's slow recovery from bullet wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Calexico police disclosed that the Border Patrol agent who fired the 
shot alleges that he pulled the trigger as the youth, perched atop the border 
fence, had his arm cocked preparing to throw a rock at the agent during a rock 
barrage. That contradicts the version outlined by the youth and by Mexican 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Eduardo Garcia Zamores, who has been recuperating in a Mexicali 
hospital since the shooting, has denied ever having a rock or threatening the 
agent, according to Marco E. Lopez, the San Diego attorney who is representing 
the youth in a $9-million civil negligence claim filed this week against the 
Border Patrol. Four witnesses to the shooting, which occurred Nov. 18, have 
denied that the boy had a rock, according to Marco Antonio Tovar, the Mexican 
consul in Calexico. 
</P>
<P>
The case has spawned outrage on both sides of the border, igniting huge 
protests in the Mexican border city of Mexicali that resulted Wednesday in a 
nine-hour shutdown of the busy international port and a halt to the flow of 
commerce and travelers. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Calexico, an Imperial County town of about 20,000 residents across 
the border from Mexicali, have voiced increasing concern about the incident's 
effect on binational commerce -- the city's lifeline -- and about the lack of 
details from the Border Patrol and Calexico police. City police are charged 
with investigating the incident, but the FBI has also begun a preliminary 
inquiry to determine if the youth's civil rights were violated. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican Embassy in Washington has requested of the U.S. State Department 
that the case be resolved as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the youth's attorney has asked the Mexican government to seek the 
extradition of the agent to face criminal charges in Mexico, which both Mexican 
and U.S. authorities acknowledge is improbable. Mexican officials say they will 
await the outcome of U.S. inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol officials and Calexico police have refused to identify the agent, 
who has been reassigned to light duties pending the outcome of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Against that charged backdrop, Calexico Police Chief Leslie Ginn called a news 
conference Friday and lambasted his Mexican colleagues, contending that Mexican 
police had denied his investigators access to the youth and had withheld other 
vital evidence -- including the 9-millimeter bullet that injured the youth, the 
teen-ager's clothing and various police and ambulance reports. Calexico police 
have also been denied access to witnesses, Ginn said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all turning their backs on us," Ginn said of Mexican police. "Right 
now, we're stopped in our investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Tovar, the Mexican consul in Calexico, said the boy's condition had prevented a 
police interview. Mexican authorities are willing to cooperate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are confident of the system of justice in the United States," Tovar said. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Ginn said the agent involved in the shooting provided the following 
account: 
</P>
<P>
Working alone, the agent was trying to detain a suspected illegal alien who was 
climbing the border fence. Garcia, the Mexicali youth who was shot, was 
positioned atop the 10-foot-high fence, facing the U.S. side, apparently 
watching as the agent tried to grab the other suspect. At the time, the agent 
told police, rocks were being thrown onto the U.S. side. The agent told police 
he fired in self-defense as Garcia was primed to hurl a rock at him. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Ginn, a 29-year veteran of the San Diego Police Department before taking 
over as chief in Calexico 5 1/2 years ago, said his department is not hesitant 
to pursue such a sensitive case. "If they want justice," Ginn said of his 
Mexican colleagues, "all they have to do is turn this over to us." 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Ginn noted, Calexico police investigated charges that Border 
Patrol agent Robert M. Ferrick had abducted a Mexican teen-ager and terrorized 
him for two days. The agent eventually pleaded guilty to a kidnaping charge and 
was sentenced to a six-month jail term. 
</P>
<P>
In the more recent case, the agent's contention that he fired his pistol as the 
youth was about to fling a rock was similar to a number of other controversial 
Border Patrol shootings in recent years, particularly the shooting in April, 
1985 of Humberto Carrillo Estrada, a 12-year-old Tijuana youth who was shot 
through the fence as he stood in Mexican territory. 
</P>
<P>
In that celebrated case, which also generated extensive cross-border protests, 
the agent, Edward D. Cole, also contended that he fired as the youth was about 
to throw a rock onto the U.S. side. The youth, who also survived, denied the 
charge. Several federal and state investigations found that the shooting was a 
justified act of self defense from a barrage of rocks. 
</P>
<P>
However, a U.S. district judge in San Diego later ruled that the Border 
Patrol's version of events was "incredible," and the judge awarded the youth 
more than $500,000 in civil damages. Carrillo was also represented by Lopez.

SELECTION FOR WASTE BOARD JOB PROTESTED; 
</P>
<P>
APPOINTMENTS: ENVIRONMENTALISTS URGE STATE SENATE TO BLOCK GOV. DEUKMEJIAN'S 
CHOICE OF FORMER COUNCILWOMAN NAN DRAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of the Sierra Club and other environmental groups are urging 
the state Senate Rules Committee to reject the appointment of former Ventura 
City Councilwoman Nan Drake to a position on the state's Integrated Solid Waste 
Management Board. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the groups say that Drake, who was defeated in her bid for council 
reelection in 1989, is unqualified to fill the $90,000-a-year job because she 
has never served as an official of a nonprofit environmental group, as required 
under board bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
"Nan Drake is a fine person and is familiar with sanitation issues," said Mark 
Murray, the policy director for Californians Against Waste. "But she does not 
have an impressive record on the environmental issues . . . and she does not 
meet the criteria for serving on the board. We can't turn the other cheek." 
</P>
<P>
Drake could not be reached for comment Friday. A spokesman for Gov. George 
Deukmejian said the governor is standing by his appointment and is urging the 
Senate committee to confirm Drake's position when it meets on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The governor appointed Drake to the board Oct. 17 after the state Senate failed 
to confirm John E. Gallagher of Orange because environmentalists said he also 
did not meet the criteria. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Anita MacKenzie said the governor believes that Drake's involvement 
in Ventura's recycling program as well as other local sanitation committees 
would make her a valuable member of the board, which oversees the state Waste 
Management Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going forward with the process," MacKenzie said. 
</P>
<P>
But Murray and Gordan Hart, the Sierra Club's California recycling lobbyist, 
said the appointment is a "slap in the face" of environmentalists and the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't understand what the governor is doing," Hart said. "His animosity 
seems to stretch so far that he can't bring himself to appoint someone who 
meets the criteria. This is a grossly irresponsible act by the governor." 
</P>
<P>
But Ventura City Manager John Baker on Friday defended Drake's appointment. 
Although she might not be an environmentalist, she would do a fine job on the 
board, Baker said. He said that without Drake's dedication, Ventura would not 
have the comprehensive recycling program it has today. She served on the 
Ventura City Council from 1985 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Given her background and her intensity, she would do a good job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Ventura County environmentalists say while they respect Drake for 
her recycling efforts, that does not mean she should be appointed to the board. 
</P>
<P>
"That slot is supposed to be filled by an environmentalist," said Cynthia 
Leake, member of the Los Padres chapter of the Sierra Club. "Nan never was an 
environmentalist and she never will be. She is just not the right person for 
the job." 
</P>
<P>
Other groups that have come out in opposition to Drake's appointment include: 
The League of Women Voters, the California League of Conservation Voters, the 
Environmental Council of Sacramento and the Environmental Coalition of Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping Deukmejian will give Pete Wilson a shot at appointing someone to 
the board," said Neil Moyer, the president of the Environmental Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
The state board was recently established under a comprehensive recycling bill 
sponsored by Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto). It includes six full-time 
positions -- four appointed by the governor and one by each house of the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The bill specifies that one of the governor's appointments be a representative 
of the trash-hauling industry and that another "has served as an elected or 
appointed official of a nonprofit environmental protection organization whose 
principal purpose is to promote recycling and the protection of air and water 
quality."

COOPER TO RETIRE AFTER 20 YEARS ON MUNICIPAL BENCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Presiding Municipal Judge Lee E. Cooper Jr. announced Friday that he will 
retire Jan. 7, ending 20 years of service on the Ventura County bench. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, 58, of Ojai said he will remain on assignment to the court, handling 
trials until a successor is appointed, and then will move with his wife, Jean, 
to their other residence in Mammoth Lakes, Mono County. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said although he is ready to retire from the judge's post to which he 
was reelected three times, he might keep his hand in the law. 
</P>
<P>
"I may be sitting on assignment, I may be doing rent-a-judging or I may 
re-enter the practice of law" as a private attorney, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
News of his departure struck a sad note and raised fond memories with his 
colleagues, who said Cooper's leadership of the court and his 30 years' 
expertise as a lawyer and judge will be missed. 
</P>
<P>
"I have known Lee Cooper for nearly 30 years as an able lawyer and judge," 
Presiding Superior Court Judge Edwin M. Osborne said. "He is widely recognized 
for his ability to settle cases. Under his leadership as presiding judge, all 
the judges of the Municipal Court have been extremely cooperative in joint 
efforts with the Superior Court when we have faced problems because of the 
recurrent shortage of judges." 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Municipal Judge John J. Hunter said, "Lee Cooper has been one of our 
most dynamic and resourceful judges over the last 20 years. We will definitely 
miss his expertise and experience." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Ronald Reagan appointed Cooper Jan. 4, 1971, from private practice as a 
law firm partner of Sen. Robert J. Lagomarsino. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many judges who have worked almost entirely in the legal world, Cooper 
drew his early professional experiences from a rich variety of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Born Dec. 17, 1931, in Los Angeles, he worked as a service station attendant, 
dishwasher, cook, machine shop helper, sheet metal worker, real estate salesman 
and library clerk. He also researched case material and appeared on the ABC-TV 
programs "Traffic Court" and "Day in Court." 
</P>
<P>
After earning a bachelor's degree in accounting at the UCLA School of Business 
Administration, Cooper studied law at the university's School of Law, receiving 
his doctorate in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper passed the bar and joined the district attorney's office as a prosecutor 
in 1961. He joined Lagomarsino's firm in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said he has always tried to maintain a "judicious, fair, organized, 
professional" atmosphere in his courtroom. But he also observed that the rising 
caseload has made the Ventura County court a busier, if less intimate, place. 
</P>
<P>
"When I moved to Ventura County in 1960 there were about 130 attorneys in the 
county. I know there are now in excess of 1,000," Cooper said. "We try to do 
justice in each individual case that comes along. That's the most any human 
being can do, but I think the perception by the public in particularly the 
high-volume courtrooms may be different . . . because you may not be able to 
give them the time to say whatever they want to say."

HARRIS ATTORNEYS MAKE NEW BID TO HALT EXECUTION; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: COUNSEL FOR CONVICTED KILLER CLAIMS EVIDENCE THAT JAILHOUSE INFORMANT 
WAS IMPROPERLY COACHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for Robert Alton Harris, in another try to save the convicted killer 
from the gas chamber, said Friday that they have new evidence backing their 
claim that authorities improperly recruited and coached a jailhouse informant 
to testify falsely at Harris' 1979 trial. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers asked the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to order a hearing at 
which they would attempt to prove that the informant acted as a "police agent," 
and had been planted in Harris' cell to elicit statements to show that Harris 
murdered his two teen-age victims to prevent them from testifying against him 
for robbery. 
</P>
<P>
The informant, Joey Dee Abshire, said in an affidavit signed Nov. 7 that 
investigators -- not Harris -- provided him with details of the crime. Abshire 
also disputed testimony by a San Diego sheriff's sergeant who said he overheard 
Harris tell Abshire he killed the boys because he "couldn't have no punks 
running around that could do that (identify him), so I wasted them." 
</P>
<P>
But, although challenging the sergeant's version of the conversation, Abshire 
said in the affidavit -- just as he said at the trial -- that Harris "told me 
the boys were killed to prevent them from identifying him." 
</P>
<P>
The testimony by Abshire and the sergeant were key elements in showing the 
killings were premeditated and deliberate -- rather than impulsive -- and thus 
made Harris eligible for first-degree murder and the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. Jay M. Bloom said the new allegations had just been 
received, and were being studied. "It does seem that this is a claim that could 
have been raised much earlier in a case that's 12 years old," Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 37, is seeking a retrial in the murders of John Mayeski and Michael 
Baker, both 16, in San Diego in 1978. If he loses in his current round of 
appeals, he could become the first person to be executed in California since 
restoration of the death penalty in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The condemned man's legal team -- attorneys Charles M. Sevilla, Michael J. 
McCabe and Michael Laurence -- had contended earlier that Harris had been 
victimized by Abshire's role as police agent. But last August a federal appeals 
panel rejected the claim, citing a lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
In their new motion, Harris' lawyers said that, after extensive investigation, 
they had finally located Abshire and another jailhouse witness. Their new 
testimony revealed Abshire's previous statements were "false in several 
material respects," they said. Harris, they said, was the victim of a 
"carefully orchestrated maneuver" by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys said that, contrary to prosecution claims, investigators had 
recruited Abshire, told him the specific information they needed from Harris, 
supplied details of the case, coached him on how to testify, then told him to 
"conceal his role as a state agent." 
</P>
<P>
Such conduct by officials would violate a defendant's constitutional rights and 
invalidate any resulting evidence. If a hearing is held, and the state is found 
to have acted illegally, Harris could win a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
Abshire, whose current whereabouts were not divulged, said in the Nov. 7 
affidavit that, when he first encountered Harris in jail Abshire considered him 
a "nut case." Abshire said he complained to a bailiff that the inmate was 
"talking about killing kids," and was taken to an office where authorities told 
him about the case and recruited him to inform on Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Abshire said that, after being placed in a cell with Harris, the accused killer 
"did not seem mentally balanced or rational," and that, without the information 
he received from police, "it would have been very difficult for me to get 
Harris to say much about it." 
</P>
<P>
The informant also said that, contrary to the sergeant's testimony, Harris did 
not refer to the victims as "punk" or say he had "wasted them." 
</P>
<P>
Abshire said that, before the trial he met with investigators at least three 
times "to rehearse my testimony." He said he had been "coached" to say he had 
not had any discussion with authorities over what punishment he should receive 
for jail escape and theft, the charges he faced in California. In fact, Abshire 
said, he had told investigators he wanted to dispose of the charges with a 
16-month prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The informant said further that he had been coached to say a deputy was outside 
the cell where he spoke with Harris, and to say no one had asked him to 
question Harris about the case. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate affidavit dated Nov. 15, Sonny Arthur Wisdom said he was in the 
jail nearby and was surprised to hear Abshire "persisting in asking 
incriminating questions" while Harris "did very little talking." Wisdom said 
Harris did not refer to the boys as "punks" and "did not volunteer anything" 
incriminating.

'INCOMPLETE' FOR CSSM ON ETHNIC ENROLLMENT; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE: AFTER FIRST YEAR, THE FLEDGLING UNIVERSITY IN SAN MARCOS SCORES POORLY 
COMPARED WITH OTHER COLLEGES IN ATTRACTING MINORITY STUDENTS. SCHOOL OFFICIALS 
SAY THEY NEED MORE TIME AND SUPPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The first line of Cal State San Marcos' mission statement emphasizes the 
education of a "diverse population," but in its first year of operation, the 
university finds itself falling short. 
</P>
<P>
The ethnic-minority enrollment at the new university of 428 students this 
semester is at 13%, contrasted with 34% for the Cal State system as a whole and 
25% at San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
"These are definitely not numbers we can live with, not in a community that has 
a strong ethnic-minority population," said Ernest Zomalt, dean of students. 
</P>
<P>
"It was reported in the last month or so that, from Los Angeles south, the 
Anglo community is no longer a numerical majority, and if that is our service 
region, then we should ensure that our population reflects the composition of 
that region," Zomalt said. "That's a difficult job to do." 
</P>
<P>
Still, university officials have few concrete plans for meeting that goal until 
they begin accepting freshmen in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Zomalt said, there will be a greater opportunity to attract an 
ethnically diverse student population because there will a larger pool from 
which to draw them. Proportionately few ethnic minority students transfer from 
two-year to four-year colleges, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Until we have freshman, we are only going to make marginal progress towards 
the goal (of ethnic diversity)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The campus also is stymied by a shortage of money, its incomplete academic 
program and small staff. But specialists in college recruitment agree that, 
even with the best of plans and money, recruiting minority students is a tough 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State San Marcos' lone recruiter, Bridget Bailey-Meier, said that "other 
than one-on-one outreach," no specific programs exist to attract 
ethnic-minority students to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Bailey-Meier said, she has received little guidance from the Cal 
State system for recruiting ethnic-minority transfer students. 
</P>
<P>
"The difficult part is that these outreach programs are sometimes tied to 
certain disciplines and, until we get all (of our disciplines) up and running, 
we can't really tie into them," Bailey-Meier said. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Johnston, assistant director of student outreach at UCSD, said that Cal 
State San Marcos officials cannot be blamed for the school's slow start toward 
ethnic diversity. 
</P>
<P>
"I would suspect that they don't have much of an outreach program at this 
point, and it takes a while to get all the contacts set up and get their 
outreach program going in a way that's going to be effective. They are probably 
just getting into that process," said Johnston, who used to work at San Diego 
State. 
</P>
<P>
Money, or the lack of it, will play a major role in how soon Cal State San 
Marcos can develop a diverse student population, Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
"Their ability to draw students is going to be related to their ability to get 
information out to prospective students," he said. That will be a hard task 
without money for publications and staff for student advisers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if there were extensive programs to attract ethnic-minority transfer 
students, the university doesn't have the staff to implement them, Bailey-Meier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The state's dismal fiscal condition prevents the university from hiring more 
recruiters, Zomalt said. 
</P>
<P>
But, even if the university could attract more ethnic-minority students now, 
Bailey-Meier said, it lacks the services such as tutorials, enrichment programs 
and cultural programs to help keep them. 
</P>
<P>
At least some ethnic-minority students think that support services can wait 
until 1995 when freshmen arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a limited budget, and I don't think they'll really need minority 
services until 1995 when they recruit freshman," said Derjen Su, a 22-year-old 
Asian-American senior majoring in business management. 
</P>
<P>
He is not the only one who thinks support services can wait while other aspects 
of the university are enhanced. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are just trying to find out where you fit in this system before 
you have a MEChA or BSU," said one Latino student, referring to the two 
ethnic-minority clubs. "Also, there are older students here, and we have lives 
other than school." 
</P>
<P>
The average age of a Cal State San Marcos student is 30, and nearly a third of 
the students are over 35. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the right programs, services and staff, recruiting ethnic-minority 
students would be a tough job, Bailey-Meier said, partly because many don't 
seek out colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
"Minority students know the counseling center at their school is there . . ., 
but for whatever reason, we (minorities) don't utilize those services in the 
same numbers that our white counterparts do," said Bailey-Meier, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the students at the university, which only accepts juniors and seniors, 
are transfers from the two local community colleges, Palomar and Miracosta, 
where ethnic-minority enrollment is 26% and 23%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
But a study conducted by San Diego State University of Southwestern Community 
College confirmed Zomalt's assertion that proportionately few minority students 
tend to transfer. 
</P>
<P>
The study showed that ethnic-minority students were half as likely to plan a 
transfer to a four-year college as other students, said George Hutchinson, 
director of student outreach services at SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
Hutchinson said their studies have shown that the two largest barriers to 
attracting ethnic-minority transfer students are money and a lack of 
understanding by students of the importance of a college degree. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of work to do in terms of briefing people, because in some way 
we are not putting out the word as to what degrees could lead to what careers," 
said Hutchinson. A majority of the students in one class Hutchinson visited at 
Southwestern Community College thought an engineer dealt with trains. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State San Marcos also has begun recruiting for its 1995 freshman class, 
distributing information to local seventh- and eighth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to talk to them about why college at all, how do you go about picking 
a college, and just get them thinking about college," Bailey-Meier said. "A lot 
of minority students may not know what it takes to become college eligible, and 
we've got to start early with them."

STUDENTS WHO WENT SAY THEIR LIVES WERE CHANGED FOREVER

<P>
They went to China looking for adventure, for someplace exotic, for a cheap 
semester away from home. They got their money's worth, and more. 
</P>
<P>
Amid tumultuous student demonstrations, loves were kindled and lives were 
changed in ways the American students never expected. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 28 students studying in Xian during that spring semester in 1989, two 
married their Chinese instructors and helped them emigrate to the United 
States; several continued their travels, including one who went to the Soviet 
Union to experience another style of communism; and even some of those who came 
home immediately were drawn back to China months later. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about China. Not a day," 
said Rose Brown, 25, of Tarzana, a CSUN graduate working in public relations. 
"When I came back, it made me so angry that . . . we live in this country where 
people take freedom for granted. There, people are willing to die for those 
freedoms." 
</P>
<P>
John Charles, who followed events from his office at CSUN, said the returned 
students were the most dramatically changed of any he had seen in his six years 
as international and exchange student adviser. "It's so different from anything 
. . .," Charles said. "It was just such a unique experience." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the students said they underwent deep changes in their outlooks, which 
they attributed largely to the pro-democracy protests and the moments of 
intense emotion and understanding that the events stirred. 
</P>
<P>
The students talk animatedly about their gradual discovery that the 
demonstrations had begun in Beijing and in the town where they were staying, 
Xian: cancellation of the 11 p.m. English-language news on television, the 
sound of bottles breaking in dormitory rooms, indicating Chinese students were 
mourning the death of their beloved leader, Hu Yao Bang, posters going up 
around school criticizing Chinese leaders and, later, copies of photographs of 
a dead woman student shot through the head. 
</P>
<P>
The excitement and electricity was the perfect backdrop to romance, said those 
who fell in love that semester. 
</P>
<P>
Brown went with her boyfriend of four years, Chris Bush. The two graduated in 
June, were married in August and will enter the Peace Corps next year, partly 
because of what they witnessed in China. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great being together and experiencing it," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Ng, 26, of Los Angeles, an ethnic Chinese who came to the United States 
from Vietnam in 1978, met a woman from the Soviet Union at a foreign student 
party in Xian. On Dec. 8, after months of paperwork and telephone negotiations, 
Marianna Lisvoskaya is scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles as Ng's fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
After the CSUN semester, Ng traveled throughout China, then spent a month with 
Lisvoskaya's family in Uzbekistan. He returned to Los Angeles last January. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the experiences Ng had during his travels, one of the most vivid is the 
evening he and Lisvoskaya went looking for a Muslim student demonstration in 
Xian, despite bans on foreign student involvement in protests. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'If I follow the protest, you have to leave because your embassy will 
pull you out of China immediately for something like that,' " Ng said. "She 
turned around and said, 'No, if there's a protest, I'll go with you. . . . 
There is no way I want you to go alone.' It was a really courageous decision." 
</P>
<P>
The students, especially those who stayed on through at least part of the 
summer, said they became far more politically aware in the aftermath of the 
student protests, when their Chinese friends became more fearful and less 
forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to that, I was of the attitude a bit that a country's political 
philosophy is their own and other people don't have a right to interfere," said 
Bob Hermann, 44, a graduate student at Cal State Long Beach who cross-enrolled 
in the CSUN program. 
</P>
<P>
Hermann, a retired Burbank firefighter, was one of two students who married 
Chinese instructors. Hermann said his wife, Cong Xiao-Ping, was the first 
teacher of foreign students to go out on strike in support of the pro-democracy 
protests, which delayed until February her application to leave the country 
after their marriage there. 
</P>
<P>
Now Hermann, who lives in Buena Park, is thinking about returning to China to 
teach, as he did while he waited for Xiao-Ping's application to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
"I was only mentally and financially prepared to be gone for five months. I 
missed my mother and my dog," Hermann said. "But I wasn't back here a month 
before I was ready to go back there." 
</P>
<P>
Like Hermann, most of the students contacted said they find themselves angered 
even today by things that seem to leave most of their friends unmoved, such as 
President Bush's refusal to withdraw China's favored-nation status with the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I went, I was totally unpolitically exposed," said Jeannie Chott, 25, 
of Van Nuys. "But after the massacre, when the Chinese government would not 
apologize . . . when they said there was no tragedy, I was so furious." 
</P>
<P>
Despite orders from Chinese university officials not to take part in the 
demonstrations, several said they were swept up by the cause. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Guevara, 21, is Latino but said he blended in when he donned a blue Mao 
jacket and marched with a Chinese friend. "He would translate for me when I 
didn't understand," Guevara said. "The students were always voicing their 
opinions on things that they wanted: To be able to choose their own major . . . 
the freedom to date before their senior year . . . little things that we take 
for granted."

STUDENTS TO GET FREE TRIPS TO MOUNTAINS

About 7,000 underprivileged Oxnard students will get a free trip through the 
Santa Monica Mountains during the next year thanks to an $80,000 grant from the 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
A pilot program designed to encourage students to care about the environment 
will be kicked off next Wednesday, when the first busload of about 70 
second-graders from Kamala School is scheduled to visit Sycamore Canyon 
Campgrounds in Point Mugu State Park. 
</P>
<P>
Students will be greeted by Ventura County Supervisor John K. Flynn, Oxnard 
City Councilman Manuel Lopez and officials from the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
During the first year, students from second, fourth, sixth and eighth grades 
will visit the mountains and go on two-hour hikes led by naturalists. 
</P>
<P>
The one-year pilot program is part of the Mountains Conservancy Education and 
Recreation Program, which has been busing poor inner-city youths from Los 
Angeles schools for hikes in the mountains since April. The Oxnard students are 
the first Ventura County students to participate in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Students from Oxnard were chosen because "they may live close to the 
campgrounds, but they're not in the habit of visiting the mountains," said Hugh 
Maher, an outreach coordinator for the conservancy. Many of the students cannot 
afford the $6 fee charged at state parks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We also give them information on how to get back to the parks," he said. 
Naturalists will also teach the children about the fauna and flora of the 
mountains through games. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in January, bilingual naturalists will accompany the students to help 
interpret for Spanish-speaking students, Maher said. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy officials are seeking to extend the life of the one-year program 
through financing from the County Board of Supervisors, Maher said. PSYCHE

COUNTY OFFERS FREE MEASLES VACCINATION FOR PRESCHOOLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA MONROE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Preschoolers can receive their first or second doses of measles vaccine free 
over the next three weeks as the San Diego County Health Services Department 
tries to prevent an epidemic from extending into another year. 
</P>
<P>
The immunizations will be conducted at school sites all over the county, from 
Carlsbad and Fallbrook to Spring Valley and Imperial Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 960 measles cases, including three deaths, have been reported in San 
Diego County this year. From 1983 to 1988, the number of cases was as low as 
three and as high as 47. A steep rise began last year. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are particularly eager to reach infants and toddlers in the Latino 
community, because the epidemic has disproportionately affected them and their 
brothers and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sun Belt, an influx of poor, unvaccinated immigrants is generally blamed 
for the increase in measles cases, but federal and state cutbacks in 
free-immunization programs have also contributed to the epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, San Diego County clinics will provide second doses of the 
vaccine to 5-year-olds. The added dose is now recommended for all children 
before they enter kindergarten, because, in a few cases, the vaccine fails to 
work the first time around. 
</P>
<P>
Parents who cannot take their children to a special clinic can call the 
county's measles information phone lines for other regular clinic times. The 
numbers are 236-2512 in San Diego and 940-1164 in North County. 
</P>
<P>
Immunization clinics will be held in:

LEGAL FLAWS CITED IN MURDER PROSECUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing procedural problems, a Ventura County Superior Court judge tentatively 
decided Friday to dismiss the murder case against David Wayne Sconce, a 
Pasadena crematory operator who was accused of poisoning a rival mortician with 
oleander. 
</P>
<P>
However, prosecutors have said that if the case is dismissed, they will refile 
the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Frederick A. Jones said there were flaws in the arrangement that allowed 
two Los Angeles County prosecutors to be special deputy district attorneys in 
Ventura County in the 1985 death of Timothy Waters. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said he will review attorneys' arguments further before finalizing his 
decision next week. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Attys. Harvey Giss and James Rogan were overseen by the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office and not the Ventura County office as 
they should have been by law, Jones said in his tentative ruling. 
</P>
<P>
If Jones finalizes his decision, prosecutors would have to repeat much of the 
lengthy, complex process required to bring Sconce to trial in Superior Court, 
including Municipal Court arraignment, preliminary hearing and Superior Court 
arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have alleged that Sconce, 34, spiked Waters' drink with a fatal 
dose of oleander at a Ventura County restaurant to stop him from spreading word 
about health code violations at the Sconce family's Lamb Funeral Home in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
If the case is dismissed, Giss has said he will see that the charges are 
refiled against Sconce and that the proper procedures are followed so he can 
prosecute the case. MACK REED

Nearly 100 people gathered in Ventura on Thursday night to launch an 
organization opposed to war in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Coalition for Peace in the Persian Gulf planned a 
demonstration for the Ventura Holiday Street Festival on Sunday, organizers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were overwhelmed at the response at the meeting," said local attorney 
Margot Davis. "We had young students, older people, Vietnam vets, church 
people, doctors, women's organizations, environmental groups." 
</P>
<P>
She said parents of soldiers now in Saudi Arabia expressed fears that their 
children might come home in body bags. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition wants people to call or write letters and postcards to President 
Bush and their congressmen, telling them to bring the troops home, allow the 
sanctions time to work and reduce American dependence on oil, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations and concerts such as those held in the 1960s and '70s to protest 
the Vietnam War, are being planned, Davis said.

Protesters plan to gather at noon Sunday on the steps of the main Ventura Post

SIX STEERS SHOT AND KILLED AFTER ESCAPE FROM MEATPACKING PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six steers that escaped from a National City meatpacking house were shot and 
killed by slaughterhouse employees Friday while trapped in a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The animals escaped from the Cuyamaca Meat Co. in the 2500 block of Cleveland 
Avenue at 9:15 a.m. and wandered two blocks before being herded into a fenced 
parking lot, said Bill Grove, manager of the slaughterhouse. 
</P>
<P>
After catching up with the cattle, employees shot and killed five of the six 
animals before officials from animal control arrived and shot and killed the 
last one, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"When (cattle) get out, and when they get excited, and people start chasing 
them and yelling at them, it makes them a little wild," Grove said. "We could 
have taken the same animals and herded them back, but, with the cars and people 
on the street, it could have been dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses complained that the shooting of the cattle took about an hour and a 
half and was cruel. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still upset about it," said Valerie King, an employee of Motivational 
Systems, where the cattle were fenced in. "They killed them slowly. They didn't 
use enough power, and it took a long time for the cows to die." 
</P>
<P>
"It was really cruel," King said. "There was one that refused to die, and it 
walked around with a bullet between his eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Landes, operations manager at Motivational Systems, said nobody asked for 
permission to fire into the parking lot and that "there didn't appear to be 
much concern for safety." 
</P>
<P>
Landes said employees of his firm were working in the building behind the 
cattle while the animals were being shot. No bullets penetrated the building 
walls, Landes said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the incident did not violate any codes on the firing of weapons in 
public, and that the case is closed. 
</P>
<P>
Grove said the animals escaped while being inspected by an officer of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture through a gate that had not been properly secured.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-month-old Vista boy was bludgeoned to death and his 34-year-old adoptive 
mother arrested, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Cherie M. Adams, 34, of the 900 block of Lupine Hills in Vista, was arrested 
Thursday night at her home in the death of her adoptive son, Bryan Preston 
Adams, who died Tuesday morning at Tri-City Medical Center, said Sgt. Manny 
Castillo of the sheriff's homicide division. 
</P>
<P>
Adams was held at the County Jail in Vista on a murder charge and one count of 
felony child abuse, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Adams called the Vista Fire Department at 6:58 a.m. Tuesday, saying that she 
had found her son lying unconscious on the floor in his bedroom when she went 
to wake him for breakfast, Castillo said. Sheriff's deputies arrived soon after 
to assist the firefighters, and, after CPR was performed, the child was taken 
to Tri-City where he was pronounced dead at 7:46 a.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
A coroner's autopsy Wednesday revealed that the toddler had died of internal 
and external injuries caused by blunt force, Castillo said. Further 
investigation by sheriff's homicide and child abuse divisions led to the 
mother's arrest, he said. 
</P>

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ENCINITAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A teacher at San Dieguito High School pleaded guilty Friday to two misdemeanor 
counts of molesting two 17-year-old female students. 
</P>
<P>
George Dewey Warner III, 34, of Encinitas, could receive a year in County Jail 
when he is sentenced Jan. 15 by San Diego Municipal Judge Charles Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
However, in an unusual move, Warner agreed to start his sentence Tuesday, even 
though he could have remained free on his $33,000 bail bond over the Christmas 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Warner was charged Oct. 9 with three felony molestation counts plus two 
misdemeanor charges involving four girls. Deputy Dist. Atty. John Williams 
amended the charges Friday to include only one felony count, which was dropped, 
and the two misdemeanors, which he said reflected the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Warner will lose his teaching credential. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said the molestations occurred outside the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Warner was a social studies teacher at the Encinitas school for five years, but 
was placed on a leave of absence without pay after the investigation began in 
September.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chula Vista Mayor-elect Gayle McCandliss said Friday that she will take the 
oath of office Tuesday night despite suffering from a liver illness that has 
forced her to undergo chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
McCandliss, who formerly served as a councilwoman, said she went public with 
her illness to dispel "a lot of questions and suppositions about my health." 
</P>
<P>
She said a cancerous tumor was removed from her colon July 31, and cells from 
the tumor had traveled to the liver. 
</P>
<P>
However, McCandliss denied rumors that she is suffering from cancer of the 
liver. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not liver cancer," she said. "I (am) feeling well. My liver functions 
are normal. I am feeling good. . . . The cells traveled to a secondary site, 
that's all." 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that the last few months have been a "difficult battle," but 
expressed optimism that she will be able to handle all mayoral duties. 
</P>
<P>
McCandliss will replace Mayor Greg Cox, who is stepping down after nine years 
as Chula Vista's first full-time mayor.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;

<P>
PARDON MY COMPUTER MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Common sense dictates that anyone using electronic mail be aware that computer 
messages could be read by third parties. To keep communication truly private, 
use the telephone, or better yet, say it in person. 
</P>
<P>
But Costa Mesa City Manager Allan L. Roeder and Police Chief David L. Snowden 
are justified in being concerned that computer messages exchanged on a variety 
of personal and professional subjects were made public. To their embarrassment, 
they found that a former city police lieutenant tapped their electronic mail 
and shared it with a city councilman, and that apparently included some 
off-color and sexist jokes -- inappropriate in any medium. 
</P>
<P>
Snowden subsequently asked the district attorney's office to determine if the 
actions of Lt. John A. Regan were legal. Deputy Dist. Atty. Wallace J. Wade 
concluded that Regan's responsibilities for the department made the issue 
sufficiently murky that he didn't think there were grounds for prosecution. 
Regan claimed he was monitoring Snowden's messages to see if he was misusing 
city property. 
</P>
<P>
Several members of the City Council, however, are upset at the invasion of 
computer privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The council will meet Monday to discuss the incident. It also will consider 
making the tapping of computer lines illegal. One councilman said he was 
concerned, for example, that disclosure of his exchanges with the city attorney 
on sensitive legal matters might harm the city's position in lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa is not alone in struggling with information privacy. Federal 
legislation extends constitutional guarantees against unreasonable search and 
seizure to those who use computers or cellular phones. But abuses are common. 
Also, many issues remain unclear, such as whether employees using a 
company-owned computer system can expect privacy. Companies or governmental 
agencies have a right to expect their computer systems to be used only for 
business. The best policy is to assure privacy to all.

DIVISION VI: KENNY OVERBY RUSHES FOR 156 YARDS AND SCORES TWICE IN LANCERS' 
23-10 VICTORY.

Senior running back Kenny Overby rushed for 156 yards on 20 carries and scored 
two touchdowns to lead Sunny Hills High School to a 23-10 victory over Valencia 
in a Division VI playoff semifinal Friday at Fullerton High School. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers (10-3) advanced to the divisional championship game against the 
winner of tonight's Tustin-Rancho Alamitos matchup. 
</P>
<P>
Overby's touchdown runs covered six and 66 yards and pretty much sealed the 
fate of a Valencia team that seemed overmatched from the start. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers scored on their first possession on a 25-yard field goal by Matt 
Young with 2 minutes 46 seconds remaining in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills had penetrated to the Valencia nine before it had to settle for the 
three points. 
</P>
<P>
But in the second quarter, Overby shifted into high gear. His first touchdown 
came at the end of a nine-play, 80-yard drive with 7:30 left in the second 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia (11-2) answered with a 21-yard field goal by Dave Greer on a drive 
that would have resulted in a touchdown had it not been for two exceptional 
plays by Sunny Hills defenders. 
</P>
<P>
On a second-and-goal from the Lancer nine, Valencia running back Willie Barnes 
was stopped for no gain by Sunny Hills defensive back David Wilde. On the next 
play, Sunny Hills defensive back Stephen Choe tipped a pass intended for 
running back Korey Alexander in the left corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Overby then dashed for 66 yards on Sunny Hills' first play on the ensuing 
possession to give the Lancers a 16-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia cut the margin when junior running back Ryan Roskelly went in from the 
one with 4:51 to play in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
The play was set up by a 48-yard run by Roskelly along the right sideline to 
the Sunny Hills one-yard line, where he was pushed out of bounds by defensive 
back Mike Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, who split time between running back and the defensive unit, capped 
the Sunny Hills scoring with an eight-yard touchdown run with 2:04 left in the 
third quarter. Sullivan also had a 21-yard run in the drive. He finished with 
89 yards on 15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia was led by Roskelly, who gained 128 yards on 16 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively for Sunny Hills, linebackers Shannon Nipp and Brian Gluhak each 
intercepted a pass by Valencia quarterback Marc O'Brien, who completed only 10 
of 25 passes for 101 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Was Sunny Hills Coach Tim Devaney happy with the victory? 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to the CIF finals. How can you not be happy," he said. "Our 
defense just had another outstanding game. It makes you feel like you've 
accomplished something when you beat Valencia."

ROSS CAN'T STOP TO ENJOY TECH'S CLIMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sitting behind his desk in his office at Georgia Tech, Bobby Ross does not look 
like a football hero. He looks like an overworked, aging 53-year-old, who has 
not gotten much rest in a very long time. 
</P>
<P>
On the brink of Georgia Tech's first undefeated season since 1952, when the 
Yellow Jackets finished No. 1 in the final United Press International poll, 
Ross is a reluctant hero. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a hard place to coach," Ross says slowly. "All these nice things have 
been happening here and I haven't been able to enjoy it one bit. The first two 
years were pure agony. I considered quitting after my first year. This job 
started out being a tough job and it hasn't stopped. The only thing that has 
made it a little easier to take is that we've started winning." 
</P>
<P>
He is surrounded by memorabilia and photos of his family. But on the wall 
behind him is a framed photograph of the six All-Americans on that 1952 
national championship team coached by Bobby Dodd. Soon, he might have to add 
another photo. 
</P>
<P>
Ross will take his No. 2-ranked Yellow Jackets between the hedges at Georgia 
Saturday, and if Georgia Tech emerges the victor, it also remains the only 
undefeated NCAA Division I-A football team in the country, headed to the Citrus 
Bowl against Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
"People around here have always talked about three coaching legends," said 
athletic director Homer Rice. "They talk about John Heisman, Bill Alexander and 
Bobby Dodd. And now they're talking about Bobby Ross as the fourth." 
</P>
<P>
While everyone around him is praising him as the mastermind, Ross describes 
himself as only "a spoke in a wheel." He says he confronted problems at Tech he 
never faced at Maryland, where he coached the Terps for five years and compiled 
a 39-19-1 record before coming here in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He says the two keys to turning the Georgia Tech program around were to cut 
down on player attrition and to establish stability within the program, from 
head coach on down. 
</P>
<P>
"In four or five years at Maryland, I lost only four or five players," Ross 
says. "My first year here, I lost 12 of 27 recruits." 
</P>
<P>
That was in 1987, when Ross inherited Bill Curry's recruits. The next year, 
1988, which was Ross's first recruiting year, he lost two of 13. In 1989, it 
was two of 26. This year it again was two of 26. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at the bottom line," he says. "Over three years we lost two years of 
recruiting classes. The big thing we've learned is that you have to recruit 
youngsters who will stay and who are committed to hard work. There is no way 
around the 15 hours of calculus this university requires." 
</P>
<P>
On the stability side, Ross has lost only two assistant coaches in the last 
four years. He said it was a matter of finding coaches with a good work ethic 
and then getting the university to agree to pay them enough to keep them. 
</P>
<P>
"It is keeping the players and keeping the coaches," he says. "I don't know 
what impact I've had on that. ... It's like the weight program. We've got the 
best facility in the country and it has done more to inspire our kids to commit 
to a weight program than I have." 
</P>
<P>
But Ross is the architect. His players attend a mandatory team breakfast daily, 
so the coaches can keep tabs on who is up and going to class. He has added two 
full-time academic counselors. There are also mandatory study periods. 
</P>
<P>
Once a week, on Friday mornings before each home game, Ross holds another 
breakfast. It is "Breakfast with Bobby," a 7 a.m. buffet open to alumni and 
fans. For an hour, Ross takes questions and talks football. An average of 100 
people attend those breakfasts, which Ross initiated because he felt fans would 
be less likely to criticize if they knew exactly what was going on. He does a 6 
a.m. radio call-in show every day for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
Tech alumni have not had much to criticize lately. 
</P>
<P>
Kim King, quarterback of the 1966 team that Dodd coached to the Orange Bowl, 
does the color on Tech radio broadcasts. He and a number of other Tech alums 
meet to watch football practice once a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I go because I need to know what they're doing and to get a feel for the game 
I'm about to broadcast," he says. "But every week when we meet there, we know 
there is another reason we all show up. Business in Atlanta is so depressed 
right now, we say a great way to feel good about yourself is to be around 
Tech." 
</P>
<P>
After Bobby Dodd resigned at the end of the 1966 season, Tech had little to 
feel good about. It went through four coaches -- Bud Carson, Bill Fulcher, 
Pepper Rodgers and Curry -- and lost more than half its games, going 104-111-7 
before Ross arrived on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Tech had started a string of Atlantic Coast Conference losses in 1986 under 
Curry and saw it grow to 16 straight under Ross. The Jackets did not beat a 
Division I-A team in 18 attempts. In Ross' first year, the team won only two 
games, both against I-AA opponents. In 1988, it won three times, finally 
beating a I-A team, South Carolina. Last season, though, Ross' team started to 
click. 
</P>
<P>
It started with a come-from-behind victory Oct. 7, 1989. The Jackets rallied 
for a 28-24, last-second decision over Maryland. It was a win that ended the 
ACC futility streak. Tech has gone 16-1-1 since that victory. 
</P>
<P>
You would think Ross would be gleeful. Instead, he is thoughtful. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know right now, if it (the winning) is worth it," he says. "It has 
been such a hard time. I remember at Maryland, after a win, I'd go home and put 
the tape of the game on, and it would be so enjoyable, so good, to sit there 
with my family and watch it. I haven't done that since I've been here. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Alice (Ross' wife) suggested I watch the last quarter of the Virginia 
game the other night. She said I might enjoy it. So I watched it, but it didn't 
make me feel anything. I send most of the tapes to my son in Japan. I'm not 
even interested in saving them." 
</P>
<P>
When Georgia Tech upset then No. 1-ranked Virginia in Charlottesville, 41-38, 
Yellow Jackets supporters called it the "best win since Coach Dodd's days." The 
praise only brings a shrug from Ross. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure Bill Curry and Pepper Rodgers had nice wins, too," he says. "People 
forget." 
</P>
<P>
However, he is delighted his players have been able to experience the emotion 
that goes with the school's first ACC football title. It is a reward, not only 
for the players he recruited, but also for the few who stayed around and 
adjusted after the departure of Curry. 
</P>
<P>
"I was one of the players that openly debated everything Coach Ross did when he 
came here," says fifth-year senior guard Joe Siffri, who was recruited by 
Curry. "I didn't like Coach Ross at all. I kept trying to make him do things 
the way Coach Curry did them. But Coach Ross wouldn't bend." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Siffri found himself bending. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to do things just good enough to get them done," Siffri says. "Now I 
work harder, to do them the right way and get the most out of them. I think you 
get that from Coach Ross in a subliminal way. We've all seen Coach Ross 
persevere through the hard times. I've seen him cry. I can't tell you how much 
respect I have for him."

MALL BEATS PHEBUS WHEN IT COUNTS, WINS TITLE

<P>
For two years, Anne Mall of Dana Hills had been playing high school tennis in 
the shadows of Keri Phebus of Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday at the Lindborg Racquet Club, Mall finally got a taste of life in the 
sunny side. 
</P>
<P>
Mall upset Phebus, 6-3, 7-5, in a semifinal and later defeated Nicole Hummel of 
San Marino, 6-2, 3-6, 7-5, to win the Southern Section girls' tennis individual 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my confidence level was up," Mall said. "I knew I could win if I 
played smart." 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills had a chance for a sweep, but its doubles team of Heather Bolton and 
Anna Zaricki lost, 6-1, 6-2, in the finals to Rolling Hills' Stephanie 
Landsdorf and Amber Basica. 
</P>
<P>
For Mall, it was redemption time. It was her first victory over Phebus, the 
two-time defending champion who won their two nonleague sets this year, 6-2, 
6-4. Phebus, top-ranked nationally in the girls' 18s, entered the match with a 
28-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
Mall, a junior who will skip high school tennis next season to concentrate on 
U.S. Tennis Assn. play, actually had a tougher time against Hummel. 
</P>
<P>
She fell behind, 2-0, in the opening set but broke Hummel's serve in the fifth 
and seventh games for a 6-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Mall aggravated a pulled groin muscle she sustained in the 
quarterfinals on Thursday, limiting her mobility and contributing to her 
second-set loss. She had the thigh taped between the second and third sets and 
was able to rebound, though it wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
Hummel tried to make Mall run by sending shots down both sidelines, but Mall 
was able to return many of them for winners. Mall clinched the match by 
breaking Hummel's serve in the final game without giving up a point. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurt a lot," Mall said. "I kind of let her back in when I got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Mall never gave Phebus much of an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
She jumped to a 5-1 lead in the opening set with aggressive play, and after a 
quasi-comeback attempt by Phebus, Mall nailed the set, 6-3. Phebus attempted to 
get aggressive herself but was never able to sustain momentum. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just playing not to lose instead of playing to win. You can't win when 
you play like that," said Phebus, who also will pass up her last year of high 
school eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
The doubles match was no contest from the start. The Dana Hills team could not 
get its serves in and was easy pickings for the Rolling Hills pair, which had 
breezed through tournament.

Nearly 2,000 fans packed Tustin High School's gymnasium Friday night to see 
Tustin, The Times' second-ranked basketball team, rout rival Foothill, 88-48. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in 14 years there has been such a blowout in this 
game," Foothill coach Jim Reames said. 
</P>
<P>
"We played an excellent Tustin team that is probably the best since Roger 
Middleton was there." 
</P>
<P>
Tustin used pressure defense to force 14 Foothill turnovers in the first half 
and opened the game with a 15-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill never recovered from a 27-8 first quarter deficit, and the Knights 
trailed, 62-27, at the end of three quarters. David Beilstein led Tustin with 
24 points, including 20 in the first half along with four three-pointers.

A cup of coffee at the Cafe Granada costs a buck even, sales tax included. 
</P>
<P>
During Friday night's City Section 4-A Division quarterfinal, the folks at the 
snack bar were doing a brisk business doling out the java, and not merely 
because there was a November nip in the air. 
</P>
<P>
More likely, the customers in line needed a jolt of caffeine, for without it 
the game might have put most of them to sleep by the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the record-setting performance of running back Brett Washington, Granada 
Hills hammered Taft, 34-6, at Granada Hills. Granada Hills (10-1) will play 
Carson, a 54-0 winner over El Camino Real, in the semifinals next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
On his first carry of the night, Washington scooted 58 yards for a touchdown, 
breaking three Highlander records in the process. Washington broke Khalid Ali's 
single-season mark for rushing touchdowns (18) and touchdowns in a season (20), 
as well as Ali's career rushing mark of 1,370 yards, all set in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, who finished with 237 yards in just 13 carries and scored three 
rushing touchdowns against the Toreadors, now has 21 rushing touchdowns and 23 
overall this season, as well as 1,554 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth time in Washington's three seasons on the Highlander varsity, 
Taft Coach Tom Stevenson was left to admire the 6-foot, 225-pound fullback's 
handiwork. Stevenson announced after the game that he was not returning as 
coach next season. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I never see you again," Stevenson told Washington with a pat on the 
back and a smile moments after the game. 
</P>
<P>
And it all started with Washington's first carry. Granada Hills led, 34-0, by 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Washington started the landslide with his 58-yard run with 8 minutes 43 seconds 
left in the first quarter on the Highlanders' second play. Taft (7-4) then 
fumbled the ensuing kickoff, with Kyron Motton recovering at the Toreador 30. 
Five plays later, quarterback Bryan Martin (nine of 14 passes for 154 yards and 
a touchdown) scored on a two-yard keeper. 
</P>
<P>
Taft made the Highlanders work, relatively speaking, for their next score. 
Granada Hills moved 51 yards in seven plays with Washington scoring on a 
pitch-out from 14 yards for a 20-0 lead. Yet Washington's Valley forge had only 
begun. 
</P>
<P>
After Martin connected with Earl Andrews on a quick-slant pattern for a 74-yard 
score and a 27-0 lead, Taft moved to the Highlander 14. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jesse Menchaca, making his first appearance in two months, fumbled 
the snap, however, and Highlander linebacker Curt Hulshizer recovered at the 
16. 
</P>
<P>
Washington then took a pitch around left end and raced untouched for an 84-yard 
touchdown and a 34-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills amassed 325 yards in the first half and 418 overall.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FORMER BURROUGHS QUARTERBACK JEFF BARRETT LEFT RENO AND 
REVERSED HIS LUCK AT SANTA MONICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The prodigal son has turned into one prodigious son of a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Barrett, a prodigy at Burroughs High who spent an unfulfilling freshman 
year at the University of Nevada Reno, has led Santa Monica City College to an 
8-2 record and a berth in the Western State bowl game opposite Moorpark at 
Moorpark College. Game time is 7:30 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way he has done a Kilroy job on the school record book -- his name 
pops up everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett, a 5-foot-11, 185-pound sophomore, has set six school career records 
and five single-season marks. He has 165 completions in 266 attempts and has 
set school records for consecutive 200-plus-yard games (10), passing yards in a 
season (2,648) and touchdown passes in a season (26). He led state quarterbacks 
in passing efficiency with a 168.1 rating, ranked fourth in total offense and 
tied for third in touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
His high school career was similarly remarkable. With 6,083 career passing 
yards, he ranks behind only Todd Marinovich, Pat Haden, Bret Johnson and Dan 
McGwire on the all-time Southern Section yardage list. 
</P>
<P>
Yet when Marinovich and Johnson headed off to USC and UCLA, Barrett, who was in 
the same year in school, decided to try his luck at Nevada Reno. And, like many 
people who go to Reno, he lost. 
</P>
<P>
In football, he redshirted. As a native Southern Californian, he was out of his 
environment off the field. The "Biggest Little City in the World" seemed like 
just a little city to Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I went through a culture shock," Barrett said. "I wasn't used to 
seeing guys wearing cowboy boots all the time and having gun racks in their 
truck." 
</P>
<P>
Barrett tried to make the best of a bad situation. Sneaking into casinos -- 
"there's no way we looked 21," Barrett said -- Barrett and his roommate learned 
that if the dealer knocked twice on the table it was time to outrun house 
security. 
</P>
<P>
During one snowstorm, Barrett and his roommate went to a grocery store at 4 
a.m., bought a sled and proceeded to careen around the middle of campus in the 
dark. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to make ourselves be happy, have fun," Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, though, Barrett realized he would have to fold his hand. The summer 
after his freshman year he called the school to say he would not return. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I got off that phone, my whole body was shaking," Barrett said. "It felt 
like this huge weight was lifted off my back, and I could start my life over 
again." 
</P>
<P>
After considering Valley and Glendale, Barrett followed the lead of Todd Deeds, 
a Reno teammate Barrett described as "my security blanket." Deeds had gone to 
Santa Monica and he steered Barrett in the same direction. 
</P>
<P>
It took Barrett a while to thaw from his time in Reno. He watched tapes of his 
high school games in an attempt to regain his confidence and "prove to myself 
that I could play quarterback again." He alternated quarters last season with 
Ernie Soto but still managed to throw for 1,510 yards. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Barrett was named Western State Conference offensive player of the 
week three times and was chosen WSC Southern Division offensive player of the 
year as well as an honorable mention All-American. 
</P>
<P>
"He's our bread and butter," wide receiver Jason Lucky said. "He's our offense. 
Without him we wouldn't be anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
It has been a year of living dangerously for Barrett. He has been sacked 15 
times, but the number is deceptive because his release allows him to unload the 
ball a wink before he can be tackled. 
</P>
<P>
He has never missed a game because of injury, but late in the season Barrett 
went to his backup and told him to get ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was getting too worn out," Barrett said. He had slacked off in his 
weight training, and a team can be a heavy burden to carry. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett persevered and finished the season cum laude. 
</P>
<P>
An Ivy League aspirant, he already has his Associate of Arts degree. He reads 
pass defenses like other people read comic strips. He describes himself as not 
the most physically talented "but a little smarter than most." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica coaching staff places an enormous amount of responsibility on 
Barrett; he is able to call an audible for virtually every play the team runs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not apparent when you're watching the game, but he gets you out of a lot 
of bad plays," Santa Monica co-Coach Owen Hahn said. "We have a very nice 
audible system, which can be as complex as the guy running it. He plays the 
whole piano, all 88 keys." 
</P>
<P>
Barrett left the Moorpark defense feeling like a player piano after Moorpark 
eked out a 44-38 victory two months ago. He threw for a career-high 376 yards, 
completing 19 of 35 passes for four touchdowns. The game, which had seven lead 
changes, turned into a series of can-you-top-this gambits between Barrett and 
Moorpark tailback Freddie Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's basic pass defense is the cover-three, a zone designed to give 
ground grudgingly through short gains. Barrett, however, turned Moorpark's 
cover-three into more of a duck and cover. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we won the game," Barrett said. "Of course, I hope they play 
cover-three. . . . There's a lot things I didn't do in that game which I'll 
probably do this game." 
</P>
<P>
The game will be his last for Santa Monica but probably not his last as a 
college quarterback. Barrett hopes to go back east, and the University of 
Pennsylvania is showing interest. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett is ready to go. He and his wife of five months, Kim, plan to be at his 
new school by January. 
</P>
<P>
This time when he goes it may not be for good, but it should be better.

Second-seeded Cal State Northridge overcame a shaky start Friday night and 
advanced to the semifinals of the Women's Invitational Volleyball Championships 
with a 6-15, 15-5, 15-12, 15-7 victory over seventh-seeded Iowa at the 
University of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors, 28-8 overall and 4-0 in pool play, will face another pool 
champion, Georgia (29-13, 3-1), this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The other semifinal pits Houston (22-15, 4-0) against Memphis State (30-8, 
3-1). The winners will meet tonight for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Northridge swept Eastern Kentucky, 15-5, 15-8, 15-2, in 
just 52 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Kathleen Dixon led Northridge against Iowa with 18 kills, 12 digs and 
seven block solos. The Matadors also received outstanding performances from 
Patty Fitzsimmons (12 kills and 22 digs), Nancy Nicholls (10 kills) and 
Marianne Dixon (eight kills, 13 digs and four solo blocks). 
</P>
<P>
"Kathleen and Marianne were phenomenal again," Matador Coach Walt Ker said. 
"Nancy and Patty were terrific on the outside for us as well. Having that kind 
of play . . . against a top NCAA Division I program was the key to us winning." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding Eastern Kentucky (24-21), Ker said: "I was happy to see (Northridge) 
come out and perform well and beat a team that we were clearly better than." 
Ker feared his team might be caught looking ahead to the Iowa match. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors had four players with similar kill totals. Nancy Nichols led the 
way with seven, and Kathleen Dixon, Marianne Dixon and Jill Trehearne each had 
six.

MORE IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR UCI;

<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: ANTEATERS SHOOT OFTEN ENOUGH TO MAKE UP FOR LACK OF 
ACCURACY IN 96-82 VICTORY OVER IDAHO STATE IN FREEDOM BOWL CLASSIC.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They call this the Freedom Bowl Classic, and now it's obvious why: No shot is 
denied its liberty, no matter how humble. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine didn't shoot well in its first-round game against Idaho State Friday. 
Truth be told, this team hasn't shot well yet this season. But the Anteaters 
have a trick. They shoot so often, they make up for it, this time in a 96-82 
victory over Idaho State in front of 2,368 in the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (2-2) plays Bradley (1-1) for the tournament title tonight at 8. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount (1-3), which lost to Bradley, plays Idaho State (1-2) in the 
consolation game at 6. 
</P>
<P>
It's strange but true that in a tournament that includes Loyola, Irvine and 
Bradley, no team scored 100 points Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters went to Alaska for the Great Alaska Shootout last weekend and 
they took with them a new meaning to the term Lower 48. To the Anteaters, it 
sounds like a disappointing first-half score. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't reach that level by halftime Friday, and they didn't reach their 
102-point average. After shooting 38% in the first half, Irvine was tied with 
Idaho State, 42-42. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Butler, the Anteaters' senior center, was at his best for a good part of 
the game. He had 14 points in the first half and scored the Anteaters' first 
nine in the second half -- including two on a ferocious alley-oop dunk. 
</P>
<P>
There are basically two things that have kept Butler from being the player 
people expected him to be. One was weight. He has trimmed to 240 pounds from a 
high of 290 two years ago, and it was conspicuous by its absence Friday. Four 
times, he rejected Idaho State shots, and about as many times, he dunked his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
But the other hindrance to Butler's progress has been foul trouble, and it got 
him again Friday. He picked up his third and fourth in quick succession with 
about 13 minutes left in the game and he fouled out with 4:53 remaining after 
scoring 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, Irvine didn't pull away until then. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine was ahead, 78-72. The rest of the way, the team's only other senior, 
Jeff Herdman, took over. 
</P>
<P>
Of Herdman's 20 points, 12 came after Butler left, including two 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters pulled together and shot 53% in the second half, finishing at 
46%, their best mark of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The other damage -- perhaps most crucial -- was done from the free-throw line, 
where Irvine outscored Idaho State, 28-8. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, what the Anteaters lacked in accuracy they made up for in bulk. 
They attempted 43 free throws, and made 28 (65%). 
</P>
<P>
Idaho State made eight of 12. 
</P>
<P>
If it is strange that Irvine is shooting poorly, it is because Irvine has 
devoted an extraordinary amount of practice time to shooting. 
</P>
<P>
To Coach Bill Mulligan's consternation, the results have been poor. The 
Anteaters averaged 102 points in their first three games, but they did it while 
making only 41% of their shots. 
</P>
<P>
The only reason they have been able to reach 100 points shooting at that rate 
is because they are averaging an astounding 86 shots a game, and 37 of them on 
the average are from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not shooting well," Mulligan said. "That's really hurting us." 
</P>
<P>
There have been other problems -- turnovers, for instance -- and too few 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine turned the ball over 19 times Friday, neither its worst performance or 
its best. They had 12 assists, which equals their season high. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, their second victory came in the seventh game of the season, and 
their third did not come until the 23rd. 
</P>
<P>
The teams they have beaten this season both had poor seasons last year. One was 
Texas Tech, which had a 19-game losing streak when it met Irvine.

Poly 33, Manual Arts 0 -- Jonathan Campbell rushed for 183 yards and a 
touchdown in 28 carries to lead the Parrots to victory in a 3-A quarterfinal. 
It was the first time this season that Manual Arts had been shut out. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Lance Garcia completed just four of 11 passes for 59 yards and one 
touchdown but ran six times for 51 yards and two touchdowns, scoring on runs of 
7 and 24 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Poly (9-3) scored twice in the first quarter on a five-yard pass from Garcia to 
Marlin McKinney and on a seven-yard run by Garcia. Jermaine Pledger scored on 
an eight-yard run to give Poly an 18-0 halftime lead. 
</P>

The deepest drive for Manual Arts (7-5) ended at the Poly 33-yard line in the

LUCERO UNBEATEN IN WINNING FALL CYCLE EVENT

<P>
Speedway motorcyclist Steve Lucero of Riverside was perfect Friday night and 
won the Coors Fall Classic in front of 3,962 fans at the Orange County 
Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Lucero won three heat races, a semifinal race and then went wire-to-wire in the 
main event to score 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Lucero had the pole position in the main event and easily defeated Brad Oxley 
of San Clemente and Mike Faria of Colton in the four-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
Lucero, the national champion in 1988, said the off-season victory was a sign 
of things to come in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be getting it done in '91," Lucero said. "I thought the new rule that 
disqualified riders going into the starting tapes helped me. I know how to 
start like that, and I thought the new rule created more consistent gating." 
</P>
<P>
Faria, who won the 1990 national championship at Costa Mesa last month, 
finished tied for third with Bobby Schwartz with 16 points. Oxley was second 
with 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
Faria started off on the wrong foot, crashing in his first heat on the back 
straightaway while leading the race. He recovered to win his next two heats and 
then won a semifinal to advance to the main. 
</P>
<P>
Oxley was consistent throughout the program, winning two heats, a semifinal and 
then finishing second in the main event. 
</P>
<P>
Overseas rider Ronnie Correy won the most exciting heat race of the night, 
holding off Sam Ermolenko to win his first heat. Predictably, four local riders 
advanced to the main event where Lucero earned the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I had good heat races," Lucero said. "I beat Gary Hicks, Ronnie Correy and 
Lance King to get to the semifinal and then outgated everybody to get to the 
final."

DAVIS LEADS BANNING RUSH PAST KENNEDY

<TEXT>
<P>
Tailback Travis Davis scored two touchdowns to lead Banning High to a 20-10 
victory over Kennedy in a City Section 4-A Division quarterfinal football 
playoff game Friday night at Gardena High. 
</P>
<P>
Davis ran for 114 yards in 20 carries for the Pilots (8-3). 
</P>
<P>
Davis also had a 98-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the third quarter 
and intercepted two passes on defense. 
</P>
<P>
Davis got off to a slow start, gaining only eight yards in his first five 
attempts. But his sixth carry went for 24 yards and a touchdown in the first 
quarter, giving Banning the lead for good at 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's top rusher, Ontiwaun Carter, was held to 24 yards in 11 carries, 
although Carter did have 52 yards on three receptions. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (7-5) recorded a first down on its first play from scrimmage as 
quarterback John McMullen threw to Carter for a 22-yard gain, taking the ball 
to the Banning 20-yard line and setting up Keith West's 31-yard field goal. But 
the Cougars didn't get their next first down until the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Pilots held a 14-3 lead at halftime. Their second touchdown came on a 
two-yard run by fullback Ken McKinley with nine minutes one second left in the 
second quarter and was followed by quarterback Anthony Nicholson's two-point 
conversion run. DAVE RAATZ

In 1976, Luigi Nono wrote a funereal work prompted by a series of deaths that 
had swept his family and that of his friend, pianist Maurizio Pollini. Thursday 
night, at Salmon Recital Hall on the campus of Chapman College, the Southwest 
Chamber Music Society offered ". . . sofferte onde serene . . ." as a tribute 
to its composer, who died last May. 
</P>
<P>
According to the artistic director of the society, Jeff von der Schmidt, the 
piece -- for piano and prepared tape -- invokes church bells ringing throughout 
Venice. The live piano part typically exploits a single range at a time, 
occasionally two very separate sections of the keyboard, while tape and piano 
mingle as expansions of one another. 
</P>
<P>
In the capable hands of pianist Gloria Cheng, accompanied by a tape of Pollini, 
". . . sorrowful yet serene waves . . ." emerged as a series of clusters slowly 
evolving in nervous rhythms. Cheng's minute exploration of the sonic and 
rhythmic possibilities of her instrument demanded and received an attentive 
hush for its full 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven's Sonata for piano and cello, Opus 102, No. 2, and his "Ghost" Trio 
flanked the contemporary work. Both gave ample opportunity to their 
protagonists -- violinist Peter Marsh, cellist Richard Treat and pianist Cheng 
-- to wring out every drop of Angst appropriate to this commemorative program. 
</P>
<P>
The trio, in particular, thrived amidst a larger-than-life conception marked by 
pristine rhythmic precision and lean, pointed tone. Opening movements of each 
opus commanded an exciting sense of competition, contrasted by brief, achingly 
lyric interludes. 
</P>
<P>
Ensemble members paid rapt attention to one another, indulging in relentlessly 
intense soul-searching for the Largo of the trio, charging forward through 
dynamically shaped phrases propelled by emphatic accents in the Presto. 
</P>
<P>
Only in the Adagio of the cello sonata did ensemble seem less than flawless. 
Here, much of the repartee between the duo passed unnoticed, though, 
individually, the players remained involved and absorbing. Still, Cheng and 
Treat closed the sonata with a powerful and intelligently illuminating Allegro 
fugato that built briskly to inevitable climaxes.

BRANFORD MARSALIS IMPROVISES AT CENTER;

<P>
THE SAXOPHONIST'S RESPONSIVE QUARTET GAVE FRESH TREATMENTS TO A NUMBER OF 
FAMILIAR TUNES.

Branford Marsalis can't leave well enough alone. 
</P>
<P>
The saxophonist's appearance Thursday at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center opened with a version of "Cheek to Cheek" that would have made Irving 
Berlin's lips pucker. Marsalis twisted the familiar theme in ways that made it 
almost unrecognizable, rushing the melody here, falling behind there, and 
sometimes ignoring it completely. 
</P>
<P>
Even tunes previously recorded by the quartet -- which includes pianist Kenny 
Kirkland, bassist Robert Hurst and drummer Jeff (Tain) Watts -- were given 
fresh rhythmic and thematic treatments. Keith Jarrett's "Rose Petals," heard on 
Marsalis' recent recording "Crazy People Music," became a lush, sultry ballad 
shaded by Watts' gentle mallet work. Marsalis' own "Mr. Steepee," the kind of 
up-tempo workout John Coltrane might have penned for himself, had the 
saxophonist stringing together rollicking tenor lines with barely a pause. 
Kirkland added spunky, block-chord accompaniment before laying out to let the 
saxophonist and Watts battle it out as a duo. 
</P>
<P>
Like Sonny Rollins, Marsalis is adept at making meaningful statements without 
leaving the middle register of his instrument. He packed tenor solos with 
flowing lines while seldom resorting to the high-end wailing that so many 
saxophonists use to express emotion. Though apparently plagued by a squeaky 
reed in the early going, Marsalis' tone was warm, ripe and rich with breath. 
His soprano sound still owes something to Wayne Shorter, but his inventive 
excursions showed he's definitely his own man. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their leader's almost athletic ability, Watts and Kirkland proved to be 
the evening's most satisfying improvisationists. The drummer coaxed 
almost-melodic passages from his modest kit, matching storms of bass and 
tom-tom rolls with delicate snare and cymbal play. Kirkland's more considered 
approach mixed blistering runs with sweeping block-chord statements and moments 
of sweet melodic beauty. It was Kirkland's lyrical approach that put romance in 
"Cheek to Cheek." 
</P>
<P>
Hurt by a mix that left his tone a bit muddied, bassist Hurst took the 
spotlight on Marsalis' bluesy "Housed From Edward" (renamed here to honor 
Watts' and Kirkland's mothers, who were in the audience), setting a deliberate 
pace that he spiked with deep-seated plucks and gut-bucket snap. The tune's 
minimalist qualities made the quartet's responsiveness especially apparent, 
with Kirkland answering Marsalis' one-liners with tidbits of Thelonious Monk 
and, at one point, the theme from "The Twilight Zone." Despite the group's 
relaxed, practically playful stage presence, their ensemble play was tighter 
than Scrooge at Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
One surprise was the inclusion of "Cold Duck," an R&amp;B-influenced number 
that Les McCann and Eddie Harris recorded some 20 years ago (and one that 
Marsalis' purist brother Wynton would probably never touch). The danceable, 
rhythmic romp, anchored by Marsalis' deep, repetitive tenor theme and 
Kirkland's soulful chording, brought an enthusiastic ovation from the crowd of 
2,564 in paid attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Calls from the audience for Bill Lee's "Mo' Better Blues" were met with laughs 
from the band and an explanation that it was done only for the recent Spike Lee 
movie. "We don't know it no mo'," Marsalis joked. "We played it, they paid us 
and we left." 
</P>
<P>
Marsalis' quartet was also scheduled to appear Friday at UCLA's Royce Hall and 
will perform Sunday at the Wadsworth Theatre.

WIMPY BURGER KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howard Rosenberg's Nov. 14 column, "Burger King Bows to TV Watchdogs," 
regarding the boycott of the chain by a bunch of fundamentalist zealots, raised 
my gorge to unprecedented levels. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, Jerry Falwell's gang did a similar number on 7-Eleven's 
parents, the Southland Corp., with similar results. . . . The wimps in the head 
office caved in to a vocal minority hellbent on controlling every aspect of our 
lives from our bedrooms (especially our bedrooms) to our books, our 
entertainment and even our concepts of God and personal values. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditional family values" is the buzz phrase. They include the literal 
interpretation of the Bible, the embracing of "Creation Science," homophobia, 
censorship of music, drama and literature, an absolute banning of abortion and 
the submission of self to the dogma of the man currently in the pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, these "values" are fine, providing they are kept within the four 
walls of their homes and their tax-exempt temples. 
</P>
<P>
But I, for one, do not accept these precepts, and I'm outraged at the power 
wielded by these practitioners of an aberrant religion. 
</P>
<P>
Burger King and 7-Eleven should be boycotted . . . by everyone who understands 
corporate cowardice and the real agenda of the fundamentalist zealot.

NOT ALL POETRY READINGS CREATED EQUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's always gratifying to see media coverage on the live poetry phenomenon, and 
each story helps inform readers and gives support to the region's poets. 
</P>
<P>
Because poets do get so little attention, however, it's all the more important 
that the journalist not misrepresent any details. 
</P>
<P>
In Rose Apodaca's recent article ("Readings, Writings and Libations," Nov. 15, 
OC LIVE!), I suspect she proposed an article about Performance Poetry, then 
felt obliged to slip pegs of various sizes through a single hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Stand Up Poetry, for instance, has never been synonymous with Performance 
Poetry. Charles Webb took pains to explain this in his introduction to the 
"Stand Up" anthology and in his conversation with Apodaca. 
</P>
<P>
This bold, insurgent movement, sparked by formally trained poets who broke from 
the beaten path, is starting to be recognized by many in other parts of the 
country as one of the most distinctive, unignorable events happening in poetry 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it's important not to cloud and confuse the issue on the home front. 
</P>
<P>
One more small point: The Los Angeles Poetry Festival did not take place 
because of the popularity of Performance Poetry, but because of the popularity 
of many kinds of poetry being written in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, the simple act of reading a poem aloud before an audience does not 
necessarily identify one as a Performance poet, or Stand Up poet.

LINDSAY MOVED TO L.A. HOSPITAL BUT NEW OUSTER EFFORT IS LAUNCHED; 
</P>
<P>
CITY COUNCIL: TRANSFER THWARTS RULE ON RESIDENCY. LATEST PROPOSAL WOULD ASK 
VOTERS TO AMEND CITY CHARTER TO PERMIT REMOVAL FROM OFFICE ON GROUNDS OF 
PHYSICAL INCAPACITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ailing Councilman Gilbert Lindsay was moved by ambulance to a Hollywood 
hospital Friday afternoon, just hours after his colleagues on the Los Angeles 
City Council saluted his 90th birthday and launched a new plan that could 
remove him from office. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay's move to Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center from 
Daniel Freeman Hospital in Inglewood, where he has spent the last three months, 
thwarted an earlier effort contemplated by the council to remove him from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Under a provision of the City Charter, a council member can be removed if he is 
away from the city for 60 days or more without council consent. Because the 
council stopped excusing Lindsay's absences on Nov. 1, he was in jeopardy of 
losing the seat he has held for 27 years as early as Jan 1. 
</P>
<P>
Council members appeared chagrined Friday that their attempted maneuver may 
have played a part in the decision by Lindsay's stepson to transfer the 
councilman. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it's not because of this fear that . . . somehow the council is going 
to do something as drastic as removing him from office," Ferraro said. "I 
certainly wouldn't want it on my conscience that by moving him we caused him 
more serious medical problems." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Nate Holden said many of Lindsay's constituents viewed the attempt 
to remove Lindsay as a "dirty trick," and said, "I'm glad to know that he's 
coming back to the city where he can be excused and stop the (60-day) clock." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, both Ferraro and Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores filed motions 
Friday seeking a Charter amendment that would permit removal of elected 
officials who become incapacitated for 60 days or longer. Such an ouster is not 
permitted under the current City Charter and no other means exists to remove 
Lindsay from office, Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro asked that the legislation be drawn up in time to place it on the April 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay has been partially paralyzed and unable to speak since he suffered a 
stroke Sept. 2 and was rushed to Daniel Freeman Hospital. His condition has 
remained relatively unchanged and colleagues and aides who have visited him say 
it is unclear whether he understands what is going on around him. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay stared off into the sunny, cloudless sky shortly after noon Friday as 
he was strapped to a stretcher and whisked into an ambulance that stood by to 
transport him from Daniel Freeman Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Someone called the councilman's name, but he did not respond. Hospital 
officials kept photographers and cameramen at bay. 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived at Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center about 
40 minutes later, a monitor strapped to his chest, he appeared alert, if 
somewhat bewildered. 
</P>
<P>
The councilman was taken directly to his room and was "resting well," said Bob 
Steward, a hospital spokesman. "We have been happy to be of service to him and 
his family for years," Steward said. "Our concern is just to provide the 
councilman with the normal level of concern and care." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said Lindsay's physician expects him to have a speedier 
recovery at Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian, where he is familiar with 
the medical staff. Lindsay's wife Theresa died there of a brain hemorrhage in 
1984 and he himself has been treated there several times, including an episode 
in 1988 when he suffered a mild stroke. 
</P>
<P>
"The family has a very favorable disposition toward this hospital," said 
Steward. "There are numerous staff members who have cared for him and his 
family. There are people here who have known him for years. I think that will 
be a great help to him." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the commotion of the transfer, Ferraro canceled plans to visit 
Lindsay Friday afternoon, when he intended to present him with a 4-foot-tall 
birthday card signed by hundreds of city employees as well as a piece of the 
whipped cream birthday cake that was served in the council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro said he intends to begin officially excusing Lindsay from meetings 
again, but the gesture has little effect because the elder councilman is within 
city limits and can no longer be expelled from the council. 
</P>
<P>
The Charter amendment motions were sent to the council's Rules and Elections 
Committee Friday and quick action is expected. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro met with community leaders Thursday in Lindsay's largely black 9th 
District to discuss the situation, he said. "They said they are very concerned 
about Gil Lindsay," he said. "They didn't like what we were doing. They didn't 
understand it." 
</P>
<P>
Removing Lindsay was only an option, Ferraro said, adding that the council 
might well have decided not to act on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"There's obviously a shift in sentiment" on the council, said Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, who 
attended the session with Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
He said that while he and others are unhappy about the district's lack of 
representation during Lindsay's illness, they have yet to reach a consensus on 
what action should be taken. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Darrell Dawsey also contributed to this story.

EX-AGENT CONFESSES TO TELLING DEA A LIE; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: WITNESS SAYS HE FABRICATED STORY ABOUT A GOLD-SMUGGLING SCHEME A FEW 
DAYS AFTER HE HAD AGREED TO TELL THE GOVERNMENT THE TRUTH ABOUT ALLEGED CRIME 
SPREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RONALD L. SOBLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Less than a week after he agreed with the government to tell the truth about 
the Drug Enforcement Administration's worst scandal, former agent John Jackson 
admitted Friday that he lied to a DEA investigator about a fellow agent's 
gold-smuggling scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, a crucial government witness in the DEA corruption trial, also told a 
federal court jury that his former associate, Darnell Garcia, was able to 
smuggle gold for years past U.S. Customs at Los Angeles International Airport 
because Garcia had a key to a security door. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second day of Jackson's testimony after his dramatic description 
Thursday of a crime spree in which he, Garcia and another DEA agent stole 
narcotics and drug cash and deposited millions of dollars in illicit profits in 
secret Swiss bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions from Assistant U.S. Atty. Joyce Karlin, Jackson told a 
story of three agents who brazenly stole seized narcotics and money and made 
quick fortunes selling cocaine and heroin to drug dealers with nicknames such 
as "Corvette Man" and "Rambo." 
</P>
<P>
During the spree, which lasted from 1983 until the three were indicted in 1988, 
Jackson said, he even prepared seized narcotics for street sales at his desk in 
the DEA's downtown Los Angeles headquarters. Most importantly for the 
government, Jackson implicated the lone defendant, Darnell Garcia, 43, of 
Rancho Palos Verdes in a number of drug-related crimes ranging from breaking 
into stash houses to harboring drug fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Karlin completed her questioning, and Garcia's defense attorney, 
Mark E. Overland, began cross-examining Jackson in an effort to compromise his 
credibility. It was the second week of the trial in the courtroom of U.S. 
District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia is charged with drug trafficking, money laundering and conveying DEA 
intelligence information to a fugitive drug dealer. He was indicted two years 
ago along with Jackson, 41, of Claremont, and former DEA agent Wayne 
Countryman, 47, of Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and Countryman pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges last August 
and entered into agreements with the government to testify against Garcia in 
exchange for reduced prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions aimed at undermining his testimony, Jackson recounted his 
lie to a DEA agent, Bradley Reed, Aug. 13. The defense emphasized the date 
because it was just five days after Jackson had agreed to cooperate with the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Jackson said, Garcia handed a bag full of cash to the owner of an 
Italian-based jewelry firm for whom Garcia worked as a gold smuggler. 
</P>
<P>
"Was that the truth?" Overland asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No," replied Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson suggested that he lied to support Garcia's story that he earned his 
fortune smuggling jewelry, a crime for which he is not currently charged, 
rather than through drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
"You were trying to help Mr. Garcia when you lied to Mr. Reed?" Overland 
queried. 
</P>
<P>
"That is correct," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson also appeared to contradict what he said a day earlier when he recalled 
first discussing narcotics trafficking with convicted Brooklyn drug dealer 
Mahlon Steward. Steward, 60, has testified that he was a drug dealer for 
Jackson and Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Jackson told Karlin that he "discussed the possibility of selling 
drugs" with Steward in 1981, when he first met him while working as an 
undercover agent. But on Friday, responding to Overland, he said the drug talks 
did not begin until two years later. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent contradiction was viewed as important by the defense in 
demonstrating that Jackson's testimony is unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson told jurors that, beginning in 1983 and lasting for about four years, 
he aided Garcia in smuggling gold jewelry past U.S. Customs inspectors on 
behalf of an Italian-based firm, Oro Aurora, which had an outlet in Los 
Angeles' downtown jewelry district. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, Jackson said, would arrive from Italy at LAX's Bradley International 
Terminal carrying "very heavy" leather shoulder bags containing gold chains. To 
avoid paying duty at the terminal's U.S. Customs station, Jackson said he would 
meet Garcia at a security door -- locked to the public -- to which Garcia had a 
key. 
</P>
<P>
This allowed Garcia to avoided Customs inspectors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know how he came into possession of such a key?" Hatter asked Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not," Jackson replied.

RUTH WASHINGTON DIES; WAS SENTINEL PUBLISHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ruth Washington, publisher of the Los Angeles Sentinel, once the second-largest 
black newspaper in the United States, died Friday of cancer. She was 76. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Washington, who 16 years ago succeeded her husband as publisher, died in 
the Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital Chalet after a long hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we were aware that Mrs. Washington was gravely ill, her death has 
still left us all in the state of shock and grief," Sentinel Chief Executive 
Officer Kenneth Thomas said. "Indeed, the news of her passing has sent shock 
waves throughout the entire black community of Los Angeles and the newspaper 
industry as well." 
</P>
<P>
The Sentinel, which has slipped in recent years to a circulation of about 
25,000 from its peak of 56,000 in the 1960s, was founded in 1933 by civil 
rights activist Leon Washington, who married Mrs. Washington in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
She was given some control over the paper when he suffered a stroke in 1948, 
later served as business manager when he returned to the helm and was named 
publisher after her husband died in 1974 of another stroke. 
</P>
<P>
"I always say that the Sentinel is like a family," Mrs. Washington told The 
Times in 1981. "By that I mean it belongs to us and it belongs to the people, 
just like a child belongs to a family. That's what makes it such a beautiful 
paper." 
</P>
<P>
While assisting her husband, and in her role as publisher, Mrs. Washington 
became the matriarch of black society in Los Angeles. She made sure the paper 
was a place where blacks could turn for steady coverage of community-oriented 
programs, fund-raisers and social events, even as blacks continued to move from 
the inner city and integration reduced circulation. 
</P>
<P>
"Her whole existence is that L.A. Sentinel. That is her life's work," Sentinel 
executive Thomas told The Times several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Ethel Bradley, wife of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, and legislator 
Maxine Waters, Mrs. Washington was a co-founder of the Black Women's Forum. She 
also was a major fund-raiser for the 28th Street/Crenshaw YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
At the newspaper's East 43rd Street plant, more than 1,000 honorary plaques and 
certificates were displayed and stacked in her office, presented to the paper 
for its longstanding advocacy of civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to do exactly for the community what Mr. Washington would have 
wanted us to do," Mrs. Washington said. "That's what keeps us going." 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1960s, Mrs. Washington attempted to ease the youth-gang problems in 
South-Central Los Angeles by meeting with gang members and inviting them to 
express their views in the Sentinel. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Washington tenaciously retained control of the newspaper despite a bitter 
13-year probate court battle by her husband's sister and illegitimate son -- 
his only child -- to wrest it from her. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband's will had bequeathed to her 80% of the newspaper's stock, leaving 
20% to his sister, Juanita Goodman, and son, Lynn Washington. The two attempted 
to oust Mrs. Washington as administrator of her husband's estate, charging, 
among other things, that her stewardship had hurt the price of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, struggling with mounting debts for the weekly paper, Mrs. Washington 
placed her longtime attorney, Thomas, in control. He agreed to pay the debts 
and keep the paper afloat. As part of the deal, she received a lifetime 
contract as publisher and some income from real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Washington's sister and son were unhappy with the arrangement. They wanted 
the paper sold. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ronald E. Swearinger resolved the 
dispute, ruling that Mrs. Washington had rightfully inherited the paper and 
could legally do with it as she wished. The paper remained under Thomas' 
control as chief executive officer -- with her as publisher. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Salina, Kan., she was trained in business and operated a 
photography studio before joining her husband at the Sentinel. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Washington is survived by one sister, Bernadette Plummer of Portland, 
Ore., three nieces and four nephews. 
</P>
<P>
The Sentinel will present a tribute to Mrs. Washington at 11 a.m. today in the 
Century Plaza Hotel, during its previously planned annual holiday bazaar.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN ARRESTED AS FUGITIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Japanese businessman who fled his homeland after being convicted of election 
fraud was in custody Friday after his arrest by federal marshals. 
</P>
<P>
Masami Aizawa, 49, was being held in the federal Metro Detention Center after 
failing to post $25,000 bail set by U.S. Magistrate John Kronenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. John Potter had urged that no bail be set. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies found Aizawa at a Gardena hotel and arrested him Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Aizawa was convicted in Japan of paying about $1 million in bribes to buy votes 
while campaigning for a seat in the Japanese Diet in 1976 and 1979, the U.S. 
Marshals Service said. He was sentenced to 14 months in prison but fled the 
country in 1989 before being incarcerated. 
</P>
<P>
Aizawa controls the Seattle-based AKC Corp., a commercial boating firm. Deputy 
U.S. Marshal Brian Salt said Aizawa apparently had frequented Hawaii, Seattle 
and different locations in the Los Angeles area before his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Kronenberg said Aizawa faced the equivalent of a misdemeanor sentence.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'FALCON CREST' ACTOR HURT IN SCUFFLE AT 
THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Lorenzo Lamas, who portrayed Lance Cumson on television's "Falcon Crest" 
series, tried to break up a fight at a Universal City movie theater between two 
cousins who turned on him, punching him in the face, the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Lamas, 32, of Los Angeles, sustained a small cut on his forehead in the scuffle 
that broke out Thursday in a theater at the Cineplex Odeon, said Deputy Rich 
Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
James Stewart, 21, of Meriden, Conn., and Robert Halliday, 23, of Mt. Laurel, 
N.J., were issued citations for misdemeanor battery and released without bail, 
Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known why they were fighting. "They are cousins and they said it was 
a family matter." Lt. Don Swift said. Stewart and Halliday apparently did not 
know who Lamas was. 
</P>
<P>
Lamas is the son of the late actor Fernando Lamas and actress Arlene Dahl.

HIGH TIDE MAY NOT LIVE UP TO ITS IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The job of forecasting ocean tides has its ups and downs. 
</P>
<P>
The lows come when experts have to issue urgent calls for sandbagging to keep 
coastal homes from washing away and emergency evacuation orders to save 
beachfront residents' lives. 
</P>
<P>
The highs come on days such as Friday, when experts predicted that an 
especially high tide will hit Southland beaches on Sunday but cause little or 
no damage between Santa Barbara and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The highest tide in 17 years is expected to be produced by an unusual lineup of 
the Earth, moon and sun. Additionally, the moon's orbit will place it 17,223 
miles closer to the Earth on Sunday than it usually is -- which is 238,855 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the tide along Los Angeles-area beaches will measure 7.3 feet -- 
compared with the normal five feet. 
</P>
<P>
Because the weather will be too calm to kick up waves, coastline damage is 
expected to be light. 
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence that the gravitational pull from the moon and sun will 
have any effect on seismic waves, scientists said, debunking a widely 
circulated prediction that the heavenly bodies will trigger a major earthquake 
Sunday or Monday on the New Madrid Fault in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a good day for beachcombing. I'll be on the beach, you can be sure 
of that," said Fergus J. Wood, a geophysicist from San Diego County who has 
spent more than 30 years studying tides. 
</P>
<P>
"The moon has only been this close to the Earth 30 times in the past 300 years. 
It's a very interesting natural phenomenon. As long as there is no wind." 
</P>
<P>
There should not be much of that, according to Steve Burback, a meteorologist 
for WeatherData Inc., which provides weather forecasts to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday will be a "little gusty," Burback said, but that will diminsh Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists calculate that a 7.3-foot high tide will occur on Los Angeles-area 
beaches at 8:08 a.m. Sunday. A low tide of -1.66 feet will occur at 3:32 p.m. A 
slightly lower high tide is predicted for 8:55 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Beachfront merchants in Redondo Beach were preparing for the worst Friday. 
Heaps of sandbags were at the ready outside the doorways of harbor fish markets 
and restaurants. Some were hoping rising seawater would send a tide of business 
their way. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, lifeguards have taken normal winter precautions of moving 
their towers to the back of the beach and bulldozing sand berms to slow down 
erosion from winter storms, said Lt. Mickey Gallagher, a Los Angeles County 
lifeguard.

Wayne Shumaker, chief of the safety and sanitation division of the county's 
Beaches and Harbors Department, said 10- to 14-foot-high berms have been built 
at such beaches as Dockweiler, Venice, Hermosa, Malibu and Torrance.

Although some beachfront residents of Ventura County were sandbagging their 
homes Friday, others were planning to fill buckets with Pismo clams during 
Sunday's low tide at local beaches. 
</P>
<P>
This year's mild weather has left abundant sand to support the unusually high 
number of Pismo clams on Ventura County beaches, said Capt. Roger Reese, chief 
enforcement officer with the California Department of Fish and Game.

U.S. GETS 2-0 LEAD IN SINGLES; 
</P>
<P>
DAVIS CUP: AGASSI RALLIES FOR A FIVE-SET VICTORY AND CHANG SWEEPS THE SECOND 
MATCH.

<P>
So, Michael Chang, this Davis Cup thing, is it over? Is it all downhill from 
here? 
</P>
<P>
"Downhill -- I thought you said Down Under," Chang joked. 
</P>
<P>
That is the approximate location of Australia's Davis Cup hopes, which appear 
to be buried beneath the crushed red clay court of the Suncoast Dome, where 
17,994 watched Chang and Andre Agassi propel the United States to a 2-0 lead 
over the Aussies. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't easy for Agassi, who labored 3 hours 36 minutes before slipping past 
Richard Fromberg, 4-6, 6-2, 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, and then made the surprising 
announcement that he nearly pulled out on Wednesday because of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
But now all that stands between the United States and its first Davis Cup title 
in eight years is one victory in the last three matches, which could happen 
today when the doubles are played. 
</P>
<P>
So is it over? No, said U.S. Captain Tom Gorman, who admitted with a straight 
face: "We feel very, very good about it." 
</P>
<P>
No team has won the Davis Cup after losing the first two matches since 
Australia in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
The current Aussie reaction? 
</P>
<P>
"We got the job in front of us," Captain Neale Fraser said. 
</P>
<P>
The job became tougher Friday night after the two crushing defeats, 
administered first by Agassi and then Chang. But while Chang's 6-2, 7-6 (7-4), 
6-0 victory over Darren Cahill was a picture of simplicity, Agassi experienced 
an unexpected rash of problems in his match against Fromberg because of flu. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could go back in time, Aaron (Krickstein) would be playing right now," 
Agassi said. Krickstein is an alternate on the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
Gorman, who said he alerted Krickstein last weekend to standby, said it was 
obvious to him that Agassi was not up to strength against Fromberg. 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed a big difference in him," Gorman said. "I'm right on the court, so I 
can see it in his face." 
</P>
<P>
The flu couldn't knock out Agassi, but Fromberg managed to come pretty close. 
Fromberg, who has curly hair and a dead straight serve, rifled 15 aces past 
Agassi. At one point, the Aussie led, two sets to one, and felt downright cocky 
about his Davis Cup debut. 
</P>
<P>
"I was feeling pretty confident I was going to win," Fromberg said. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? To hear Agassi tell it, it sounded as if he came off his deathbed 
to play. Agassi said he didn't eat Sunday, Monday or Tuesday, but he informed 
Gorman on Wednesday that he would be able to play after all. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi blamed his bout with flu, not Fromberg, for a less-than-spectacular 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I was losing it more than he was winning it," Agassi said. 
"There's no question the virus has taken a toll on me. I was tired. I was much 
weaker than I thought I would be." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Agassi said he never saw a doctor during his illness and neither did 
he take any medication, although he expects to be fine for his match Sunday 
against Cahill. 
</P>
<P>
Cahill, who was swept in 2 hours 11 minutes, did not seem to take Agassi's 
illness seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"Did he look sick to you?" Cahill asked. "I don't listen to what he says." 
</P>
<P>
However, Gorman does, and he hinted that Agassi would not play Sunday if the 
United States has already clinched the Davis Cup. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, this did not seem likely. Agassi had won only one of six other 
five-set matches and was teetering on the edge of another as Fromberg 
dispatched a convoy of big serves at him, the balls bouncing off the backstops 
behind the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
With the United States down a set after the third set, there was a 15-minute 
break and once play was resumed, Fromberg found his momentum had chilled. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my first Davis Cup match and my first break, and when I came back out I 
was a little bit cold," Fromberg said. "I felt the first game was really 
crucial." 
</P>
<P>
Agassi broke Fromberg in the first game of the fourth set, closed it out in a 
hurry, then power-stroked his way to a 5-2 lead in the fifth set. Agassi became 
more aggressive in the final set, in which he accounted for 24 of his 75 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
But serving for the match, Agassi failed to win a point. When Fromberg held at 
love, Agassi served again for the match at 5-4. This time, he ended it, but not 
before Fromberg forced a third match point. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi had blown the first one when he went for too big of a shot and slugged a 
forehand wide. He missed the second when he hesitated and came in halfheartedly 
behind his second serve with Fromberg returning the ball at Agassi's feet. 
</P>
<P>
The third match point he didn't let get away. Agassi blasted a forehand past 
Fromberg, who seemed rooted at the baseline, then raised his arms in 
celebration and was soon running off the court with his index fingers in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
It was a relieved if somewhat blanched Agassi that entered the interview room. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I took him lightly, but I anticipated being in a little more 
control than that," Agassi said. "Coming into the match, I anticipated me 
winning it a lot easier than that." 
</P>
<P>
Such is the elevation of Agassi's confidence that he expects to win easily even 
if he was so sick he nearly withdrew two days before. Fromberg, for one, wasn't 
swallowing Agassi story of a three-day fast. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bit of rubbish, really," Fromberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Australians Pat Cash and John Fitzgerald will have the edge in Davis Cup 
experience in today's doubles match against Americans Rick Leach and Jim Pugh. 
</P>
<P>
Cash and Fitzgerald are 6-2 in Davis Cup matches starting in 1985. Leach and 
Pugh are undefeated in three matches, all in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good chance to prove ourselves," Leach said. "We know it'll be a 
tough match."

DIFFERENT IS O'NEAL'S 1ST NAME; 
</P>
<P>
CHARGERS: ATTENTION MAKES LESLIE O'NEAL GO. HE GETS HIS SHARE OF IT.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years ago this week Leslie O'Neal was on his back in the Hoosier Dome, 
clutching the wreckage of what had been a healthy knee. 
</P>
<P>
He was playing in the first quarter of his 13th professional football game, and 
as difficult as it was supposed to be for a rookie, Leslie O'Neal already had 
compiled 12 1/2 career sacks. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago this week there was greatness in the making. Now there's a what 
might have been had he not been hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows what Ted Williams would have been had he not been called back to the 
service?" asked Ron Lynn, Chargers defensive coordinator. "Down the road, this 
Leslie O'Neal thing might be, 'Gee, just think how good he might have been' as 
they go ahead and induct him into the Hall of Fame." 
</P>
<P>
It would be foolhardy, of course, to suggest that Leslie O'Neal wanted to be 
hurt, wanted to undergo seven surgical procedures and 22 months of 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
But disaster, and its accompanying comeback against all odds, becomes O'Neal. 
It adds to his identity. Makes him different, and different is what Leslie 
O'Neal is all about. 
</P>
<P>
He wears $195 fire-engine red shoes -- to the locker room. "They get attention, 
and they match the outfit," he said, and although he said it's not calculated, 
he could probably go all season long and never wear the same clothes to work 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium for his first regular-season game 
in a $60,000 maroon Mercedes. "It's not maroon," he said, "It's Cabernet." 
</P>
<P>
He likes it when teammate Burt Grossman makes fun of him for carrying a Louis 
Vuitton briefcase "with nothing in it . . . except maybe his own football 
cards." Said O'Neal, "When he says stuff like that, he gets me in the public 
eye." 
</P>
<P>
He pays Lloyd's of London $15,000 a year for a $1 million insurance policy 
against a career-ending injury, and how many NFL linebackers receive a weekly 
manicure? 
</P>
<P>
"He's been different from the day he first got here; he wouldn't sign his 
contract until he shook hands with the owner," Lynn said. "And then he made a 
controversial decision to have surgery on the knee with a different doctor. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never met someone in this game who takes his own course to the extent he 
does, but then I've only been in this game about 25 years. Ask Lee Williams 
about him. When O'Neal went to the Pro Bowl, he wanted to coach the defense 
because they weren't doing it right." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal was selected to play in his first Pro Bowl last year as a backup, and 
while standing on the sideline, demanded the attention of all-star performers 
Howie Long, Bruce Smith and Michael Dean Perry. 
</P>
<P>
"He took Gatorade cups and designed a defense to stop the NFC from being 
effective. Right on the sideline," defensive tackle Williams said. "I see this, 
and I'm thinking, 'O'Neal can't be doing this.' But he is, and so I was trying 
to tell Bruce, Howie and the guys what type of individual Leslie is, because 
you know Leslie . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, he set up an offense on this table with green cups, and then uses red 
cups as the defense to counter what they're doing. Howie's there watching, and 
so is Bruce, and I was amazed. I'm not sure Bud Carson and the rest of his 
staff agreed, but you know what? In a matter of 30 seconds, he convinced us it 
would work." 
</P>
<P>
The O'Neal way. As he will tell you -- the only way. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes back to college," O'Neal explained. "It's my second year at Oklahoma 
State and we're getting ready to play Nebraska, and this is when they are 
loaded with great players. 
</P>
<P>
"So the coaches go and get this guy out of the student body that weighes about 
310 pounds and they tell me I got to pound on this guy to get me ready for 
Nebraska. I figure that makes no sense, and I say so. And I won't do it, so the 
coach, George Walstad, gets mad at me. 
</P>
<P>
"He makes me run the stairs up to the top of the stadium, but as I'm running, 
I'm telling myself I'm right about this. I weigh 214 pounds and I'm going to 
get killed if I do it their way, so when I get to the top of the stadium, I 
just sit down. 
</P>
<P>
"I sat up there the whole practice, pads and everything. When I came down they 
couldn't really do anything to me because I was a starter and I was out there 
making plays. 
</P>
<P>
"We get in the game and it's nationally televised, and I think I had 21 
tackles, three sacks and a couple of fumble recoveries. From that point on, I 
decided if I can get people to just leave me alone and let me do it my own way, 
I'll be better off. Just let me be in my own world." 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt Leslie O'Neal is in his own world. It's a world where he 
makes all the tackles, gets all the sacks, has all the answers and speaks only 
of himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He's aloof, but I think he likes it that way," linebacker Gary Plummer said. 
"He considers himself a notch above everyone, but it's not an arrogance where 
it's going to tick you off. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it means a great deal to him being recognized, the All-Pro status. It 
even comes to a point if a guy gets a sack, he's ticked off because it wasn't 
him. He wants to make every play on every down. I think he thinks he's capable 
of doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he is. He has started 42 professional football games and has 36 sacks. He 
is the team's No. 2 tackler behind Plummer this season, just as he finished a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't come across a more complete player in my life," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams has been elected to play in the Pro Bowl the past two seasons. He has 
piled up more sacks in the past five years than any AFC player. He's considered 
to be one of the team's finest athletes, if not the finest. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were to be realistic, considering what he's accomplished to this point 
and what I had accomplished in as many games, he would be the more effective 
player," Williams said. "Not to take anything away from myself, but in my 
estimation, he will be the better player. 
</P>
<P>
"Had he not had that setback (knee injury) he would be the guy all others would 
be measured by. I'm talking L.T. (Lawrence Taylor), Reggie White, he would have 
been in that class of player. And I'm not sure that he isn't at this point. 
We're talking greatness here." 
</P>
<P>
The power of performance. It allows Leslie O'Neal to be different, to be 
outspoken. To get away with it. 
</P>
<P>
"I can say whatever I want as long as I'm making plays," he said. "I know a lot 
of guys down in the locker room don't like me. Some people take my so-called 
arrogance the wrong way, but that's the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the bottom line with what we're trying to do in this organization is 
to not really have people stand out," he said. "They don't want stars, but it's 
going to happen because the good players are going to separate themselves from 
the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the attention. The attention brings a lot of prestige. It measures how 
successful you are, and it brings you more money." 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing phony or premeditated in his pitch for the spotlight. It is 
who he is, and what he does to let people know who he is. 
</P>
<P>
"He's determined to be successful," Williams said. "He likes it. He gets a rush 
out of it. He wants to be the guy everybody talks about, and I think that's 
what will make him so good. Don't get me wrong, the team is important to him, 
but he also thrives on the individual accolades that come with being a great 
player." 
</P>
<P>
The quest for success, however, makes O'Neal a target. There are whispers that 
he is too outspoken, too big for his own shoulder pads. 
</P>
<P>
"I know. I heard so much negative stuff about me because I chose not to come 
over here during the off-season," O'Neal said. "I wasn't signed, and I figured 
if they really wanted me to be part of this team, I would have been signed long 
before that happened. So I went golfing. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to be upset with me and don't like me personally, they can send 
me somewhere else, and then I'll go somewhere else and make the plays," he 
said. "And that will make them look bad, so they won't do that." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago an outspoken O'Neal was incensed. His team had been defeated 
27-10 by Kansas City, but it was not so much the loss, he said, but the way the 
team lost. 
</P>
<P>
Although cautioned by several teammates to keep his peace, O'Neal could not. He 
didn't think the coaches were making the proper adjustments, using the right 
people, and said so. 
</P>
<P>
"They said, 'We hear you, and now leave us alone?' " O'Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, it's the same plays that killed us against Pittsburgh. The Raiders ran it 
and got us, Seattle did it, and we're going to see those couple of plays the 
rest of the year. They're going to run the inside trap, run like a read play 
with boot action off it, dump the ball off to the tight end and he's going to 
run a quick arrow, and they're going to run the jab." 
</P>
<P>
The coaches hear this stuff and offer a knowing smile. They go to work every 
day with the understanding that they will receive unsolicited insight from 
Leslie O'Neal. Sometimes they listen. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really knowledgeable about the front part of the game," Lynn said. "In 
his mind, he pretty much has everything that goes on in the world figured out." 
</P>
<P>
If there has been a more precocious rookie defensive end to play this game, he 
would have been well-known as the first rookie player-coach. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times in meeting rooms when he drives me nuts," defensive line coach 
Gunther Cunningham said. "But then he looks at you, and says, 'Don't worry, 
I'll make the plays.' And it's like I say, 'You better.' 
</P>
<P>
"You know, players respect good players. He feels as long as he plays well, his 
outspoken manner will be forgiven and forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
It's not rabble rousing. And there is nothing negative about the attitude or 
the delivery. It's just that Leslie O'Neal will not go quietly into the huddle. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a pain in the butt," O'Neal said. "But I'm in a position to speak out. Why 
would Billy Ray Smith take a chance of blowing the reputation he has here. I 
mean here's a guy sitting on top of the world. More than likely, when he 
retires he'll have Larry Sacknoff's spot (at Channel 10), so why would he take 
a chance of jumping on the coaches? 
</P>
<P>
"No one else can really say anything around here. You got so many young guys 
and they don't want to blow an opportunity, and then you got the older players 
who don't want to make a fuss in their last couple of years," he said. "A lot 
of guys can't live on the edge like I can." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of guys never have lived, never will live as O'Neal had to live during 
those 22 months of rehabilitation. His injury was the worst of injuries, and it 
happened because a teammate jumped offsides. It happened because another 
teammate failed to make the proper defensive call. 
</P>
<P>
When it happened, O'Neal chose to have his knee surgically repaired by the U.S. 
Ski Team physician, Dr. Richard Steadman. He had bypassed the organization. 
"There were some people here who thought I was doing it to screw the 
organization," O'Neal said. "I mean after you've been threatened to be cut or 
have your pay reduced, you think about where you stand. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time I thought like I might rather go somewhere else. I had rookie 
videotape to show how I could play, and I was only making $200,000, so other 
teams could have a guy who wasn't a rookie. Other teams were interested, and I 
was interested." 
</P>
<P>
That was a little more than two years ago. And to watch O'Neal drag his leg 
behind at the time, was to understand how the Chargers felt. They had been told 
by a rookie that he was going elsewhere for medical treatment, and now more 
than a year later, he still wasn't playing. Might never play again. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing him hobble around here for a year and looking at that knee, I didn't 
think he'd come back," Plummer said. "I just didn't think it was 
physiologically possible." 
</P>
<P>
When he tried to test his knee in hand-to-hand combat with an overweight and 
overmatched James FitzPatrick it was no contest -- FitzPatrick reigned 
triumphant. 
</P>
<P>
"It was as low as I could get," O'Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
So low, that when given videotape of his practice session with FitzPatrick, he 
threw it at Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
"He just threw it at me, and I saw on his face that he was wavering: 'Am I 
going to make it back?' " Cunningham recalled. "We sat in there for three hours 
and watched the Raider film from his rookie year, and from that day on, it got 
better. He could see he still had it; it was just a matter of getting stronger, 
getting back to the mental part of it all." 
</P>
<P>
He's back, all right. He no longer is the defensive lineman he was as a rookie, 
but as an outside linebacker, he spends almost all of his time on the defensive 
line. 
</P>
<P>
"It's his anticipation," Plummer said. "He has the ability to know what they're 
going to do before they do it, and that sure makes it easier to play." 
</P>
<P>
When his peers watch him work, "It's vintage videotape," Williams said. "It may 
be his determination. It doesn't appear his moves are any more different than 
anyone else, but for whatever reason, he's more successful." 
</P>
<P>
Had he not been hurt . . . "I think about it," O'Neal said. "But the thing is, 
if I hadn't been hurt, we would have drafted someone else besides Burt 
Grossman, and the team would have progressed more. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason they drafted Burt was because they didn't know if I could come 
back. But now they've ended up with an abundance of players at the same 
position, and someone ultimately has to be out of position, and that's Lee 
Williams. He's the best defensive lineman we have, and people don't understand 
the sacrifice he's making." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal does, and nothing against Grossman, it's business. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what would have been had I not gotten hurt," O'Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
His knee is fine now, he said; no pain, no swelling, so no ice. The doomsayers 
said he wouldn't be back, wouldn't be the same player, but he did it his way. 
Always his way. 
</P>
<P>
"Growing up, I heard stories from my dad about how independent he was, and I've 
always wanted to be that way," he said. "Let me know what my job is, let me 
figure out a way to do it, and leave me alone. I'll get it done." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal does not participate in the team's weightlifting program. He does not 
follow the team's off-season conditioning plan. He does what he pleases. 
</P>
<P>
"He sneaks around to lift weights," Cunningham said. "I think he works a lot 
harder than people think. He likes to have that aura about him: I just do it." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever he's doing, it works. And for all his eccentricities, there is still 
the undeniable payoff in tackles and sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"He's different," said Grossman, a man who knows whereof he speaks.

They're a couple of gunslingers, the triggermen in two shoot-em-up offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Gunslinger East meets Gunslinger West. The man in Miami traveling white 
meets a man in San Diego State home black. It's the show within the Show. 
</P>
<P>
And as No. 3 Miami takes on the Aztecs at 1 p.m. in a nationally televised game 
in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, this may be a performance San Diego fans will 
remember for a long time: Craig Erickson, Miami's mobile quarterback, and Dan 
McGwire, SDSU's long, tall quarterback. A couple of kids scorching the NCAA 
statistical charts from opposite ends of the country. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches will tell you the game will not be decided by the quarterbacks 
alone. True. If the Aztecs are to score more than 30 points for the ninth 
consecutive game, McGwire will need protection. And Erickson's effectiveness 
will depend in part on whether the Aztec defense makes any big plays. 
</P>
<P>
But these two quarterbacks will play a part -- almost surely a large part -- in 
this afternoon's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
CRAIG ON DAN: "I think San Diego State has had a . . . successful season, and 
directly responsible for that is their play at quarterback. Dan has done an 
outstanding job for them. I think it will be a shootout, to say the least." 
</P>
<P>
DAN ON CRAIG: "I won't answer questions about the quarterback matchup. I don't 
look at it that way. I won't even watch his offense when it's on the field. 
I'll be on the phones, and talking with my receivers. . . . There's no pressure 
on me this game. People say it's Miami and national television, and you have to 
perform well. I've performed well the last two seasons. Just because it's 
Miami, I'm not going to play any different." 
</P>
<P>
In the not-too-distant future, these guys will be playing on Sundays rather 
than Saturdays. That's why NFL scouts have visited both schools with regularity 
this year, and that's why no fewer than 14 of them have been credentialed for 
this afternoon's game. 
</P>
<P>
"The obvious thing is the mobility of Erickson as opposed to (McGwire)," said 
Bill Tobin, vice-president/player personnel for the Chicago Bears. "But McGwire 
has the size and a stronger arm." 
</P>
<P>
Tobin visited a couple of SDSU practices earlier this week, but has since 
returned to Chicago and will watch this afternoon's game on television. Like 
most NFL men responsible for personnel, he didn't want to say too much. He 
wouldn't, for example, talk about where the two will be drafted. But he 
stressed that he likes them both. 
</P>
<P>
"When I said Erickson has more mobility, I don't want that as a negative on 
(McGwire)," he said. "One is faster but not nearly as big. The tradeoff is size 
for quickness." 
</P>
<P>
Said Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard: "The size gives McGwire a couple 
of advantages, but Erickson is a good runner who avoids the rush. . . . There's 
something a little deceiving, also (about size). When you're that big, you 
don't really look as quick as someone 6-1 or 6-2." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire, 6-foot-8 and 240 pounds, is the tallest Division I quarterback in NCAA 
history. Erickson is 6-2, 196. McGwire is third in the nation in pass 
efficiency (152.4) and fourth in total offense (334.5 yards per game.) Erickson 
is fourth in pass efficiency (147.1) and fifth in total offense (308 yards per 
game). 
</P>
<P>
Both set school records for total offense this season. McGwire was responsible 
for 528 yards of total offense Nov. 17 at New Mexico; Erickson had 472 at Cal 
Sept. 15. McGwire has completed 60% of his passes this season; Erickson 58.8%. 
</P>
<P>
"They're both good quarterbacks," Tobin said. "Both are accurate, both can 
throw the ball and have good production. Their stats bear it out." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire has thrown 25 touchdown passes and only six interceptions; Erickson has 
thrown 20 and 6. Both have improved dramatically from a year ago, when McGwire 
threw 16 touchdown passes and 19 interceptions, and Erickson had 24 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire, in fact, is currently on pace to set the NCAA record for lowest 
percentage of pass interceptions in a season. Only six of his 396 attempts have 
been intercepted -- 1.52%. The record, 1.65%, was set by Brigham Young's Jim 
McMahon in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a matchup of possibly the two finest professional quarterback 
prospects in the country," agent Leigh Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg currently represents 18 NFL quarterbacks, including Jeff George and 
Troy Aikman, the last two No. 1 picks in the draft, and Andre Ware, last year's 
Heisman Trophy winner. 
</P>
<P>
Some people think McGwire's size is an advantage;, others are wary, as no NFL 
quarterback has ever been that tall. 
</P>
<P>
"If (McGwire) were 6-4, he would clearly be the No. 1 pick in the country," 
Steinberg said. "And he may well be at 6-8." 
</P>
<P>
Said Joel Buchsbaum, associate editor of Pro Football Weekly: "I think the 
general public thinks of Erickson as being better than (Vinny) Testaverde. . . 
. a can't miss guy. McGwire is the unknown. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I think, if anything, McGwire is the first rounder and Erickson is the guy who 
could fall." 
</P>
<P>
Buchsbaum is a highly respected draft analyst, and here are some excerpts from 
his notes: 
</P>
<P>
JOEL ON DAN: "The guy has gotten so much better over the last year. Hasn't had 
a bad game (this year) yet. Very consistent arm motion. Can throw all of the 
passes. Very, very strong arm. Pure passer. Can stretch the field both 
horizontally and vertically. Has learned to look off receivers. Dramatic 
improvement in timing and touch from his junior year." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand: "Not real quick arm motion. Average release quickness. Going 
to have to be strictly a pocket guy -- you'll have to build your offense around 
him. The thing he hasn't improved much is his drop-back -- he still glides and 
bounces when he goes back. Not as accurate deep as I thought." 
</P>
<P>
JOEL ON CRAIG: "Top competitor, loves challenges. Good football instincts; 
smarts. Quick delivery; can zip the ball. Throws well off back foot, doesn't 
fluster easily. Can 'touch' ball between defenders. Poised." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand: "Doesn't have great size, speed or arm strength. Goes 
through stretches where he is erratic. Throws too many balls off his back foot. 
Needs to set his feet more. A little inconsistent with delivery." 
</P>
<P>
Both quarterbacks work out of similar offenses. Miami and SDSU each run a 
one-back set and attempt to spread the defense all over the field, thus 
creating more open space. Miami doesn't run as many two- and three-tight-end 
schemes as SDSU, but its execution is similar. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Dan could go into their offense and run it extremely well, and Craig 
could come in ours and run it extremely well," SDSU Coach Al Luginbill said. 
"There wouldn't be a lot of drop-off." 
</P>
<P>
Erickson, from West Palm Beach, Fla., has learned the Miami system over the 
course of four years. He was an apprentice on the bench during his first two 
years before earning the starting job last year. Like Bernie Kosar and Steve 
Walsh before him, he led Miami to a national championship in his first year as 
its quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire, from Claremont, Calif., had to take a crash course in quarterbacking 
the Aztecs. He transferred to SDSU in 1988 after two seasons at Iowa. He became 
unhappy with the Hawkeyes when he was benched after starting two games his 
sophomore season. McGwire redshirted in 1988 and became the Aztec quarterback 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Miami Coach Dennis Erickson on McGwire: "He sees things so much better (than 
last year). He gets rid of the football quicker -- knows where he's going with 
it sooner." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill on Craig Erickson: "He's a streak player. He will play extremely 
well, and then he won't. We need to have him stay down in that funk level." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Luginbill added: "I think they're very similar. Look at Erickson's 
touchdown-to-interception ratio. The important thing with a quarterback is: Is 
he getting the football into the end zone? Both of those young men have done 
that." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest difference today might be the Miami defense. Sure, SDSU is 
averaging 43 points and 535 yards a game, but Miami has the best defense, by 
far, that SDSU will have seen this season. 
</P>
<P>
"(McGwire) may have a tough time against Miami," Buchsbaum said. "They are mean 
and they will go after his knees. They are not choirboys." 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State will attempt to accomplish four things this afternoon: 1. 
Establish a running game to open the passing game; 2. Continue to throw the 
ball well; 3. Get a few big plays from the defense, such as an interception, 
fumble recovery or sack; 4. Slow Miami down early -- the Hurricanes have scored 
first in all 10 of their games. . . . SDSU Coach Al Luginbill and Miami Coach 
Dennis Erickson both agreed their defenses would not be able to completely stop 
their opponents. "They're as good an offensive team as there is in the 
country," Erickson said. "You're not going to stop an offense like that." . . . 
Streaks: Miami has won 53 consecutive games against unranked teams. SDSU is 6-0 
at home this year. . . . The highest-ranked opponent SDSU has ever defeated was 
No. 12 Iowa State in 1981, 52-31. 
</P>
<P>
According to the NCAA, Miami has faced the nation's seventh most difficult 
schedule this season and SDSU has the 41st most difficult schedule. . . . Big 
game: San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium officials granted SDSU's request to have 
the end zones painted red and black today. Normally, the end zones are painted 
blue and gold -- Chargers' colors. Steve Shushan, assistant stadium manager, 
said he couldn't remember the last time they painted the field in SDSU colors, 
but said it has been "at least four or five years. It's such a big game we said 
we wouldn't mind doing it." The end zones will be re-painted blue and gold in 
time for Sunday's Chargers-New York Jets game.

GIBSON REPORTEDLY JOINS ROYALS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: FREE AGENT EXPECTED TO SIGN A TWO-YEAR CONTRACT WORTH $3.3 MILLION 
TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Kirk Gibson, who led the Dodgers to the 1988 World Championship with the most 
dramatic home run in Los Angeles history, will quietly end his three-year 
association with the team today by signing a two-year, $3.3-million contract 
with the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report in today's Kansas City Star, Gibson will join the Royals 
as an outfielder and designated hitter, with the announcement being made in a 
news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Baldwin, Gibson's agent, did not deny the report late Friday. "I can just 
have no comment," Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, 33, spent a stormy three seasons with the Dodgers after being signed as 
a free agent on Feb. 1, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
His departure was a foregone conclusion after he asked to be traded during the 
middle of last season. 
</P>
<P>
Because of frustrations over not being traded or moved from center field where 
he was unfamiliar, Gibson later engaged in a shouting match with Fred Claire, 
Dodger vice president. After Gibson declared free agency in October, the 
Dodgers made no attempt to sign him. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson's tenure with the Dodgers was highlighted by his first season, when he 
had 25 home runs and 76 runs batted in and was named the National League's most 
valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
The season both began and ended in typically stormy Gibson fashion. 
</P>
<P>
In his first appearance in a game for the Dodgers in spring training, he ran 
off the field in anger after teammate Jesse Orosco played a practical joke by 
placing eye black in his cap. Many Dodgers felt that incident set the tone for 
the successful season. 
</P>
<P>
Then in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series against Oakland, Gibson ended his 
season by cementing his place in baseball history. He hobbled to home plate on 
a bad left leg with two out in the ninth inning and hit a two-run homer off 
Dennis Eckersley to give the Dodgers a 5-4 victory that led to a stunning 
four-games-to-one Series win. 
</P>
<P>
He spent much of that year playing in pain because of hamstring and knee 
problems, injuries that quickly caught up with him. After 1988, he had a total 
of 17 homers and 66 RBIs in his final two seasons with Los Angeles. His .213 
batting average in 1989 was the lowest by a returning MVP since Dodger pitcher 
Sandy Koufax in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
After undergoing knee surgery on Aug. 29, 1989, Gibson did not return last 
season until June 2. After hitting .337 in July to lead the start of the 
Dodgers' late-season surge, he slumped in September, batting .159 with no 
homers and four RBIs in the season's final full month. 
</P>
<P>
"If he goes, it will be sad, really," teammate Orel Hershiser said earlier 
Friday when discussing the likelihood of Gibson's departure. "Gibby was one of 
the main parts that turned this organization around." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser agreed, though, that Gibson's injuries hurt not just his playing 
time, but his ability to be the leader that he was in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are hurt, it is hard to lead a team," Hershiser said. "It is hard to 
go out there and be energetic and think about leading everyone when you have to 
be worried about yourself."

A member of the New Mexico Athletic Commission said he was unaware that 
super-flyweight champion Johnny Tapia had to take a drug test after a title 
fight in Albuquerque. Tapia, 23, tested positive for cocaine Nov. 14, nearly 
three weeks after he retained his U.S. Boxing Assn. title Oct. 26 against 
Santiago Caballero of Venezuela, New Mexico authorities said. The test was 
taken after Max Abeyta, events coordinator and chief deputy inspector for the 
New Mexico Athletic Commission, discovered during a routine check about a week 
after the fight that neither fighter had been tested.

HERSHISER STILL CAUTIOUS AFTER THROWING; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: HE TAKES STEP FORWARD IN WORKOUT BUT SAYS HE WON'T PRESSURE HIMSELF TO 
PITCH BY OPENING DAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The faces plastered against windows of the Dodgers' executive offices were 
smiling. On the field below, after catching another hard throw from this town's 
most watched right arm, Chris Gwynn was wincing. 
</P>
<P>
"Dang," Gwynn said. "His pitches feel pretty good to me." 
</P>
<P>
But Orel Hershiser was not fooled. After taking another strong step in the 
rehabilitation of his reconstructed right shoulder Friday, Hershiser issued an 
equally strong warning. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not consider it a setback if I am not ready to pitch opening day," he 
said after 90 long tosses with teammate Gwynn at Dodger Stadium. "My ultimate 
goal is to pitch again, I don't care if it's not until the All-Star break or 
until the last day of next season." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser said that his short-term goal is to be ready for the Dodgers' opener 
April 9 in Atlanta but that it is no more than a goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to put that goal out there and say, 'If I don't get it, the 
surgery didn't work,' " he said. "Sure, if I was ready by the start of the 
season, that would be a great script, wouldn't it? But I have no idea if the 
surgery is going to go by that script." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser added that, although his recovery continues to proceed nicely, he 
hopes Dodger management will not consider him a member of the rotation when 
carrying out its winter game plan. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a reflection on my rehabilitation, but I think it would be great 
if the Dodgers would not plan on me being here," he said. "That way, when I am 
healthy, we will have all these extra cards to play. That way, we will get even 
stronger. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the cliche of cliches that you can never have enough pitching. But 
really, I would like to see us get more pitching." 
</P>
<P>
Beginning today at the annual winter meetings, Dodger Vice President Fred 
Claire will be following Hershiser's advice. Expect the Dodgers to make bids 
for remaining free-agent starters Zane Smith and Kevin Gross, then listen to 
offers of starting pitchers for outfielder Kal Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back at Dodger Stadium, Hershiser will continue to work with team 
therapist Pat Screnar three days a week, nearly three hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
As if the rehabilitation weren't difficult enough, they are essentially doing 
it blindfolded. Because Hershiser's shoulder operation involved a landmark 
procedure, there are no case histories they can follow. 
</P>
<P>
"Orel being the first pitcher at this level to have that procedure, we're 
basically going through uncharted waters," Screnar said. "Everything is going 
extremely well to this point, but we can't predict opening day, it is just too 
far away." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser began throwing Wednesday for the first time since the end of the 
season. He hopes to be throwing off a mound by the middle of December. 
</P>
<P>
Then, at the Dodgers' mid-January workouts, he hopes to reach the first real 
milestone of his comeback: facing live hitters in batting practice for the 
first time since the surgery on April 27. 
</P>
<P>
If he is to have any chance of making the opening-day roster as a starter, he 
should be throwing batting practice by the start of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
"If I want to break camp with the team, I've got to be able to get my 
competitive legs against other teams during spring training . . . it can't just 
start happening during the season," Hershiser said. 
</P>
<P>
While Hershiser threw several balls very hard Friday, he wonders if or when he 
can throw every ball hard. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I might have thrown 10 balls in the mid-80s (m.p.h.) today," he said. 
"But the question is, can I throw 90 of those pitches with just a three-five 
minute break between 12 of them. And can I do it 35 days a summer? 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't know. Nobody knows."

Coach Art Shell confirmed Friday that Jay Schroeder will start at quarterback 
Sunday at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who sprained his left knee in last week's 27-24 loss to the Kansas 
City Chiefs, said he is ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
Shell said he would wait until today to decide whether to activate quarterback 
Steve Beuerlein for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Broncos have lost four consecutive games, their longest losing 
streak since 1972 and the longest losing streak by a Dan Reeves-coached team, 
quarterback John Elway said Denver isn't giving up. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not quitting yet," Elway said. "We're going to hang in there and keep 
going. That's all we can say." CHRIS BAKER

FUTURE NOT AN ISSUE FOR BROWNS' COACH

<TEXT>
<P>
Interim Coach Jim Shofner, who will lead the Browns against the Rams in 
Cleveland Sunday, said he hasn't really concerned himself with whether he will 
be back next season. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't even thought otherwise, really," Shofner said. 
</P>
<P>
"You start doing the job, you just assume you're going to do it from now on, 
and that's the way I'm thinking. And how it'll work out, I don't know. But no 
one has said 'This is your job' by any means." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Bernie Kosar, who worked closely with Shofner when Shofner was 
former coach Bud Carson's offensive coordinator, made it clear where he stands. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the players are looking for some stability and respect Jim Shofner," 
Kosar said. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Coach John Robinson said there is no reason to fear the chilly weather in 
Cleveland Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Supposed to be in the 40s," Robinson said. "I think when it's bad is when it 
gets down to the 20s. Thirties are not bad. Forties aren't bad. I don't think 
we anticipate problems there with the weather." TIM KAWAKAMI

KEARNY'S SCOTT RUNS PAST RAMONA, 35-22

<P>
Ramona High Coach Mel Galli saids his team would not have a chance of beating 
Kearny if Friday's game turned into a track meet. 
</P>
<P>
Galli couldn't have been more prophetic if he had been Carl Sagan. The track 
meet began slowly with a couple of 20-yard sprints by Kearny's Darnay Scott. 
And just as Ramona grew close at 14-7 in the second quarter, Scott lengthened 
his stride and said goodbye to the Ramona secondary and hello to the 2-A San 
Diego Section finals. 
</P>
<P>
Kearny won 35-22 Friday before 300 fans at Mira Mesa High, but it really wasn't 
that close. Kearny (11-1-1), which lost to Lincoln and Marcus Allen 34-6 in its 
last appearance in the section finals 13 years ago, will play either El Camino 
or La Jolla next Saturday (8 p.m. at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium). 
</P>
<P>
Ramona's huge offensive line actually held up its end of the bargain, allowing 
halfback Sarn Salmon to rush for 143 yards. But the Bulldogs' defensive 
secondary was no match for Scott and his buddies. 
</P>
<P>
Kearny quarterback Sam Page riddled the Ramona secondary for 280 yards on nine 
completions in 13 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
With San Diego State Coach Al Luginbill watching on the sidelines, Scott caught 
four Page passes for 144 yards. But his biggest catch came one play after he 
stopped a second-quarter Ramona drive with his 10th interception of the season. 
</P>
<P>
With Scott split wide right, Page lofted the ball his way. Although he had to 
come back for the ball and two Ramona defenders at the Kearny 40, Scott was 
fast enough to outrun everyone for the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw it was open," Scott said. "I just had to split their two backs. Once I 
caught it, I knew I could get by them becasue I run kind of fast." 
</P>
<P>
Galli said Scott's 85-yard touchdown was the clincher. 
</P>
<P>
"Darnay made the big play," Galli said. "That was the ball game. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we started letting them throw the bombs, it was over. We just got 
out-talented in the secondary."

It didn't take long for Lincoln High to rebuild a program decimated by 
graduation after last season. 
</P>
<P>
In its first game, the Hornets, whom Coach Ron Loneski says must win with speed 
because it has no height, screamed to a 101-55 victory over Granite Hills in a 
Norsemen-Warhawk opening-round game.

MAYER LEADS SOARING GULLS OVER ALBANY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sparked by red-hot defenseman Derek Mayer, the Gulls defeated the Albany 
Choppers, 4-2, Friday in the final of three-consecutive International Hockey 
League games against the Choppers. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls, who had split two games with the Albany earlier in the week, 
overcame a one-goal deficit in the second period to get their fourth victory on 
a six-game road trip that concludes tonight at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls (13-10-2) remained in second place in the IHL Western Division while 
the Choppers (7-15-3) kept their spot at the bottom of the Eastern Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls scored two goals in 56 seconds in the second period, with Mayer 
scoring the first and assisting on the second. Mayer tied the game, 2-2, when 
he took a faceoff from Mike Sullivan at the left point and sent a rising 
40-foot shot over the left shoulder of Chopper goalie Rick Knickle. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer then led a 2-1 break before feeding Taylor Hall with a short crossing 
pass. Hall scored to give the Gulls the lead at the 8:23 mark of the period. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer now has scored a point in nine consecutive games. He has 14 points in 
that span, five goals and nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
"He played another great game," Gulls Coach Mike O'Connell said of Mayer. 
"Since he came to us from the (Detroit) Red Wings (last month) he's given us 
everything we could possibly want." 
</P>
<P>
Darren Lowe scored first to give the Gulls a 1-0 lead 2:20 into the game. 
Albany countered with goals by Scott Shaunessy and Yves Heroux later in the 
period. Bob Jones capped the scoring for the Gulls with his fifth goal of the 
season late in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Goalie Alain Chevrier stopped 40 of a season-high 42 shots as the Gulls 
improved to 4-1 on the road trip.

LA JOLLA HOPES ITS LUCKY SIGNS POINT TO VICTORY

<P>
It seems like every time La Jolla High's football team has taken the field this 
season the players have looked around for a sign, something unusual to reassure 
them that they're old coach still is with them. 
</P>
<P>
In a game Oct. 19 against Kearny, the Vikings, heavy underdogs, found their 
fans petting and feeding a crow in the stands at Mesa College. But La Jolla 
knew the crow meant something and tied the Komets, 7-7, to earn a share of the 
City Western League championship that night. 
</P>
<P>
In their playoff opener against Lincoln two weeks ago, the Vikings looked into 
the sky and could see only one star. The players believed the star, like the 
crow, signified that Gene Edwards -- the former La Jolla coach who died last 
summer shortly after his retirement -- still was with them. 
</P>
<P>
With the clock running out, the team marched 87 yards in 53 seconds to score 
the go-ahead touchdown then sealed a 14-13 come-from-behind victory when John 
Zuanich made a diving interception at La Jolla's five-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
When the Vikings dedicated the 1990 season in Edwards' memory, they expected to 
improve on their 3-6-1 finish in 1989. But no one thought they would be 10-1-1 
and facing defending champion El Camino (8-4) in a San Diego Section 2-A 
playoff semifinal game at 7:30 p.m. today at Torrey Pines High. 
</P>
<P>
"No one ever thought we'd be this far," said third-year La Jolla running back 
Nick Alford, who couldn't explain his team's dramatic turnaround. "I don't 
know. It just seems no one ever quits. We keep seeing little signs that Coach 
Edwards is still there." 
</P>
<P>
Like before a game at Clairemont, where they walked into the locker room and 
found No. 29 written on a chalkboard. The Vikings, who wear No. 29 on their 
helmets for the number of years Edwards served as head coach, crushed 
Clairemont, 45-2. 
</P>
<P>
Alford, a senior, has carred for 1,253 yards on 217 carries and scored 14 
touchdowns this season, sharing the spotlight with junior E.J. Watson (87-845, 
17 touchdowns). Last week, Alford had a 30-carry, 153-yard, two-touchdown 
performance in La Jolla's second-round 34-7 victory over West Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings have looked bad at times. First-year Coach Dick Huddleston said 
they tended to play to the level of their competition, which has not always 
been strong. But La Jolla is looking more and more like a team of destiny. 
</P>
<P>
In a crucial City Western League game late in the season, the Vikings pulled 
out a 24-23 victory over USDHS with 10 seconds left, despite being outgained 
346-152. Eric Zadeyan, who has had trouble at times kicking extra points, 
booted a 42-yard field goal to win it. Zadeyan's improbable kick came after 
quarterback Brian Hidalgo was intercepted on fourth down, but USDHS was flagged 
for roughing the passer. 
</P>
<P>
"There was certainly a little bit of luck," said Huddleston, whose team is plus 
20 in the turnover department. "It seems like every time we get an opportunity, 
we capitalize on it." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight the Vikings face El Camino, which overcame an 0-3 start and has won 
seven of its last eight games, including playoff victories over University City 
(36-10) and Escondido (17-16). 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats appear to have an edge in experience, but La Jolla seems propelled 
by a mystical force -- maybe a 12th man. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, exactly," Alford said. "We all have a minute of silence before each game 
to dedicate it to (Edwards). Everybody thinks about it."

DISCREDITED MILLI VANILLI STILL ON 1990 GRAMMY BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
And the winner of the 1990 Grammy is . . . Milli Vanilli? 
</P>
<P>
That Grammy nightmare could become reality -- sort of -- when the music 
industry awards are handed out in New York on Feb. 20. Though the lip-sync duo 
was stripped of it's best new artist Grammy from last year, Milli Vanilli 
appears in four categories on the first-round ballot that went out this week to 
the 6,000 voting members of the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; 
Sciences. The duo is listed for album of the year, record of the year, pop 
performance by group or duo and song of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The ballots, which will be used to select actual nominees for the 1990 Grammy 
awards, were printed and readied for mailing before the lip-syncing story 
broke. 
</P>
<P>
Academy president Michael Greene said Friday that votes in the first three 
categories would not be counted. 
</P>
<P>
"The same factors that rendered them ineligible for the award last year renders 
them ineligible this year," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
But Milli Vanilli's "Blame It on the Rain" is making it into the song of the 
year category. Though the song category honors the writers -- in this case pop 
songsmith Dianne Warren -- and not the performers, it could be a huge 
embarrassment to the academy to even tangentially honor former Milli frontmen 
Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan. 
</P>
<P>
But Greene said that as far as he knows there is no reason to remove the 
group's work from the song category, though the matter will be decided 
officially at a meeting of the academy's awards and nominations committee on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Greene said that no letter will be sent to Grammy voters to make them aware of 
the ineligibility but that a reminder of it might be included in regular

"We appreciate the mention on the ballot," Heyn said, after speaking to Pilatus 
and Morvan, who are trying to launch a singing career of their own. "And we 
hope that Robby and Fabrice will win a real Grammy in the future in order to 
give back to the fans what they deserve."

OIL PLUMMETS ON NEWS OF BUSH OVERTURE TO IRAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's offer to initiate diplomatic contact with Iraq fueled optimism 
on world markets Friday, prompting oil prices to plummet more than $4 a barrel 
in the second-largest one-day drop on record. 
</P>
<P>
For a day, thoughts of a recession were overshadowed by hopes for world peace 
as Wall Street stocks pushed strongly higher and bond prices rose as well. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil for January delivery dropped $4.06 a barrel to settle at $28.85 a 
barrel, the lowest level in six weeks, as traders on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange saw Bush's remarks heightening the prospects for peace. 
</P>
<P>
"Prices went through support levels like Rommel through Africa," said Daniel 
Uslander, a trader and partner with Hilltop Trading Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The one-day fall was surpassed only by a $5.41-a-barrel drop on Oct. 22, when 
traders reacted in part to reports that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had 
dreamed that the Prophet Mohammed told him his missiles were pointing in the 
wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic fall in oil prices spurred a strong reaction on Wall Street, where 
the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks soared 40.84 points to close at 
2,559.65. 
</P>
<P>
The stock and oil markets were apparently undeterred by sobering economic news 
out of Washington on Friday, as the Commerce Department reported that the Index 
of Leading Indicators, a broad measure of the nation's economic health, fell 
1.2% in October. It was a further indication that the economy was heading into 
a recession. It was the fourth monthly decline. 
</P>
<P>
Shaking off recession fears, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose $10.62 
per $1,000 face amount. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the dollar fell against world currencies. It dropped to 1.4965 
German marks in New York late Friday from 1.5040 marks the day before. It was 
down to 132.55 Japanese yen from Thursday's price of 133.15 yen. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, gold prices, which often rise on bad news and fall when the 
headlines are upbeat, dropped $5.60 Friday to $383.30 an ounce in New York. 
</P>
<P>
On the Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for delivery in later months joined the 
fall, with most declines limited by exchange rules to $1.50 a barrel. Oil 
prices are now well below the record high of $41.15 reached on Oct. 11, during 
a period of high war fears. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of unleaded gasoline and home heating oil were also down strongly. 
Unleaded gasoline for December delivery closed off 5.79 cents a gallon at 77.58 
cents. Heating oil for December delivery was down 7.65 cents a gallon at 85.87 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
The plunge in crude prices came as President Bush made an opening statement at 
a nationally televised news conference in which he offered to send Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III to Iraq and said he would welcome a visit to 
Washington by Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication whether the proposals would be accepted, and Bush made 
it clear that the meetings were intended not to negotiate, but to inform 
Hussein of the United States' position. 
</P>
<P>
Still, "a lot of people took that as a peace overture," said Kenneth Nugent, an 
energy futures and options broker at Paine Webber Inc. in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, prices that had been slipping around the previous 
psychological barrier of $32 a barrel fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
"We came off about $1.50 in a matter of about 10 minutes," said Thomas 
Blakeslee, an analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J. "As 
soon as the news broke that Baker was going to Baghdad, it broke through the 
floor." 
</P>
<P>
Trading was heavy as prices crashed through various support levels. The effect 
was heightened by technical factors and computer selling. 
</P>
<P>
"We compressed about four or five days of work into about 10 minutes," said 
Uslander. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Bush's speech, oil prices had been languishing after Thursday's 
news that the United Nations had adopted a resolution authorizing the use of 
force and setting a Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to pull out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"As President Bush was saying himself, the U.N. resolution was seen more as a 
step toward peace than toward war," said Tom Bentz, director of trading at 
United Energy Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Since it now seems unlikely that war will break out before Jan. 15, the 
deadline gave traders a reason to strip out some of the "war premium" that has 
been built into oil prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously the fear of hostilities and disruptions in supply that keeps 
prices high," said Randall Rothenberg, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the end of trading, oil prices again fell sharply, hitting a low 
for the day of $28.70 a barrel before recovering slightly at the close. 
</P>
<P>
"This break indicates that we will move back to the fundamentals (of supply and 
demand) as there is no immediate concern for war" in the next few weeks, 
Blakeslee said. Those fundamentals show an adequate supply of oil and falling 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
For the immediate future, traders said they see the oil market testing the 
$28-a-barrel level, and perhaps even falling as low as $25 a barrel before 
rising again -- unless, of course, there is some other unexpected news. 
</P>
<P>
"The month of December should be an interesting roller-coaster," Blakeslee 
said.

MAN CONVICTED AFTER DAUGHTER RECALLS MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
REDWOOD CITY, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A retired firefighter was convicted on Friday of murder after his daughter 
testified that she witnessed the killing of her girlfriend 21 years ago but had 
repressed it until after she became a parent. 
</P>
<P>
Eileen Franklin-Lipsker, now 30, told a bizarre and shocking tale in the San 
Mateo County Courthouse of how as a girl of 8, she watched in horror as her 
father, George Franklin, crashed a rock into the skull of Susan Nason, her best 
childhood friend in September, 1969. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons that she could not explain, she forgot what she witnessed, and only 
began recollecting the murder one afternoon in early 1989, as she looked after 
her own young daughter in her Canoga Park home. 
</P>
<P>
When the jury foreman read the verdict of guilty of first-degree murder, 
Franklin-Lipsker, who was sitting in the front row of the courtroom, turned and 
embraced Margaret Nason, the mother of the victim. Both women wept. 
</P>
<P>
"There can't be a true victory for me because it is my father," 
Franklin-Lipsker said after she composed herself. "I'm relieved it's over. I 
know I did the right thing to come forward." 
</P>
<P>
"It does lay it to rest, 21 years later," Nason said. She and her husband, Don, 
had attended virtually all of the 3 1/2-week trial. The Nasons live in the same 
suburban Foster City home as they did when Susan, the younger of their two 
daughters, was abducted on Sept. 22, 1969. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be there. I wanted to hear the conclusion to what happened to my 
daughter," Margaret Nason said. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors left the courthouse without speaking about the case. They reached the 
verdict after a day and a half of deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
"They saw through the smoke and did their job," said Bob Morse, a district 
attorney's inspector who investigated the case. "They're heroes." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin, 51, a burly, craggy-faced and silver-haired man, showed no emotion 
when the verdict was read. Superior Court Judge Thomas Smith set Jan. 29 for 
sentencing. Frankin faces a penalty of life in prison with the possibility of 
parole. The capital punishment law in effect at the time of the crime was later 
ruled unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, Douglas Horngrad, did not comment. But his face fell into his hands 
when the verdict was read. He had spent long hours cross-examining the 
often-combative Franklin-Lipsker in an effort to point up voids and 
inconsistencies in her memory. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that the verdict will stand," said San Mateo County Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Elaine Tipton, who prosecuted the difficult case. 
</P>
<P>
She attributed the verdict to the "compelling nature of the evidence" that 
corroborated Franklin-Lipsker's testimony, including the crushed ring that 
Susan Nason had been wearing at the time of her murder and that the San Mateo 
County Sheriff's Department kept for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin-Lipsker had testified that she was riding in her father's van when he 
picked up her schoolmate Susan from the street near their homes. They drove to 
an isolated spot on the road to the coast west of Foster City. There, her 
father molested Nason on a mattress in the back of the van, then took a rock 
and smashed her skull. When she tried to go to her friend, her father stopped 
her and threatened to kill her if she ever told what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
As they drove home that evening, she testified, she told her father that they 
should not leave "Susie" because she would become cold and frightened. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin, who retired on disability from the San Mateo Fire Department in 1981, 
had been living in the Sacramento suburb of Carmichael and dabbling in real 
estate when he was arrested Nov. 28, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the Franklin family revealed that they had suspected him of 
committing the crime. A sister even called authorities a few years ago. But 
there was nothing to connect him to the murder until the eyewitness, 
Franklin-Lipsker, came forward. As it was, her memory often was hazy and 
shifting. She testified that details continued to come back even as the trial 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin-Lipsker, who recently moved to Switzerland, acknowledged that she sold 
her "life rights" in lucrative book and film deals. In addition to a book based 
on her authorized version of the story, another author plans to write a book 
about the strange case. 
</P>
<P>
The murder of Susan Nason was the first ever investigated by the Foster City 
Police Department. The city had been created only a few years earlier when a 
developer began building on what had been a dairy farm and mud flats on San 
Francisco Bay, between San Francisco and San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
With its motto, "Growing Beautifully," low-priced houses and promises of safe 
streets, the so-called instant suburb quickly drew many young families in the 
mid-1960s. Among the first to move in were the Nasons and the Franklins. They 
lived only a few doors apart. 
</P>
<P>
George and Leah Franklin had married in 1957 and had five children by 1963. 
Eileen, the middle child, and Susan Nason had just started the third grade in 
September, 1969, at Foster City Elementary School a short walk away. 
</P>
<P>
Nason disappeared at roughly the same time as one of California's most 
sensational murders -- that of actress Sharon Tate by Charles Manson and his 
followers. But in the San Mateo Times, the disappearance of Susan Nason was the 
headline news, and remained so until after her body was found on Dec. 2, 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Tipton, trying to explain how Franklin evaded capture for so long, said the 
"mind set" of investigators at the time was that child molesters are strangers. 
In fact, she noted, most child molesters and killers know their victims. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Hensel, who had been the lead detective on the case in 1969, retired from 
police work nearly 20 years ago, but said in an interview after Franklin's 
arrest that he often thought about the crime. For years after he left police 
work, he would write to the state Department of Justice with any ideas he had 
for investigators to follow. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time a kid is snatched, I always think of Susan," he said. And he often 
thought, "What could I have missed?" 
</P>
<P>
Hensel was a firefighter before he went into police work, and said he wonders 
whether he would have suspected fellow firefighter Franklin, if for some reason 
his name had come up. "Firefighters save people," he said. They're "heroes" 
trained to save lives, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Hensel said, he should have interviewed each child who lived in 
the neighborhood separately. Perhaps that would have given young Franklin the 
courage to reveal what she knew. "I think the girl would have broke down," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will go to sleep now," Hensel said. ". . . There will be rest."

BUSH DIALOGUE OFFER TO IRAQ A SHREWD GAMBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's decision to propose a high-level dialogue with Iraq, a 
stunning reversal of his previous position, is intended both as a last chance 
for peace and a necessary prelude to war. 
</P>
<P>
As much as an overture to Saddam Hussein, Administration officials said, the 
gesture is meant to persuade a restive Congress and public opinion in the 
United States and the rest of the world that Bush will make every reasonable 
effort to avoid conflict. If it also persuades Hussein to get out of Kuwait, 
these officials add, so much the better. 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be very little confidence within the Administration that 
face-to-face talks will have much effect on Hussein's oft-repeated 
determination to hold onto Kuwait. Nevertheless, Bush announced that he had 
invited Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz to visit Washington and said that he 
is ready to send Secretary of State James A. Baker III to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not all that hopeful . . . that we'll get big results out of all of this," 
Bush told a news conference. "It's going the extra mile; it's taking the extra 
step. But I can't tell you that I think we're going to have great success on 
all of this." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's skepticism is understandable. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
recently summoned Aziz to Moscow for a stern lecture and a pointed demand that 
Iraq end the occupation. Aziz refused to budge. Earlier in the crisis, U.N. 
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar was rebuffed on a peace mission to 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Bush made it clear that he is not willing to compromise on his 
refusal to permit Iraq to gain anything from its invasion. If he maintains that 
position, his message to Iraq will be no carrot, all stick. That sort of 
negotiating stance is seldom successful, especially in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
So why send Baker now? 
</P>
<P>
Bush said Hussein may not yet realize that the United States and its allies are 
serious in their determination to end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait -- by 
force if necessary. He said face-to-face meetings might persuade the Iraqi 
strongman. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not felt that he got the message," Bush said. "I hope this will do it." 
</P>
<P>
But a far more important reason is to show the world that the United States and 
its allies are not rushing to war without exhausting other avenues that might 
lead to peace. That, the President is known to believe, is necessary to avoid 
the sort of divisive debate -- both in this country and in the rest of the 
world -- that would diminish the credibility of the threat to use force. 
Officials said the Administration, clearly wounded by respected military 
experts' testimony in Congress this week that force is not necessary now, must 
defuse that debate if it hopes to fight successfully in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
In voting to authorize a military offensive if Iraq does not withdraw from 
Kuwait by Jan. 15, members of the U.N. Security Council made it clear that they 
expect the next 45 days to bring an extensive diplomatic effort to resolve the 
crisis without warfare. But there were few suggestions offered on how to go 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's dramatic announcement was intended to get the United States out in front 
of that process. 
</P>
<P>
At his news conference, Bush said: "I am convinced that these two direct 
meetings . . . will guarantee to all the people of the world, certainly to the 
American people, that Saddam Hussein (does) not misunderstand" the realities of 
the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Iraq has not responded to Bush's new offer. However, the Baghdad regime 
has been demanding for months that the United States engage in a dialogue with 
it. For Iraq to refuse to talk now would require the same sort of 180-degree 
turn that Bush engaged in when he decided to propose the direct talks. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as early this week, Administration officials were insisting that 
the United States would never send a high-level official to Baghdad because it 
would imply that they were willing to negotiate key demands. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's tactical reversal was a closely held secret until the President was 
ready to reveal it. Even after the announcement, officials were reluctant to 
talk about the process that led up to it. However, the decision apparently was 
made earlier this week, just before the Security Council debate on the use of 
force and as congressional criticism about the U.S. troop buildup was mounting. 
</P>
<P>
"This was Baker and Bush at their best," said William B. Quandt, a National 
Security Council expert on the Middle East during the Jimmy Carter 
Administration. "They don't advertise their punches. They catch everyone by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a brilliant stroke, to defuse a mounting political problem the 
President had here at home," Quandt said. "Whether it will be a brilliant 
diplomatic stroke, I can't tell you. But this crescendo of criticism will be 
put on hold. He has stemmed the tide of what was beginning to be a major 
erosion of the domestic consensus."

Objectivity is paramount, the scientist was saying. At least, that's what she 
had been taught. Speak to the moral implications of your work and you risk 
leaving the impression that you are no longer neutral. 
</P>
<P>
But then there is the notion of a Good German, she went on. They knew what was 
happening but kept silent -- either out of fear of the consequences of speaking 
out, or out of misguided patriotism. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't want to be a Good German," the scientist concluded simply. "So 
either you turn your back on the research and you work in something else, or 
you have to at some point say, 'This is wrong.' " 
</P>
<P>
Christiane Hale is in many ways an outsider -- a Northerner repotted in the 
soil of the Deep South, an erstwhile expatriate, part epidemiologist, part 
historian, part social psychologist, an academic researcher with an undisguised 
point of view. 
</P>
<P>
That geography, physical and psychic, defines her professional perspective. She 
has observed the U.S. public health system from abroad, and tracked patterns of 
disease and death among blacks and whites through the prism of American social 
history. 
</P>
<P>
All of which has brought Hale to a chilling and controversial hypothesis in the 
attempt to unravel one of the more troubling puzzles in public health -- why it 
is that black babies born in the United States are twice as likely as whites to 
die by age 1. 
</P>
<P>
The racial gap, Hale and some others believe, cannot entirely be traced to 
racial differences in income and social class. Even middle-class black women, 
it seems, are twice as likely as whites to give birth to dangerously 
underweight babies. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they have begun to suspect that long-term poverty may have exacted a 
deep, physical toll -- subtle but significant damage to the reproductive health 
of black women, which they believe can be passed from one generation to the 
next. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely how that might occur is unclear. But Hale and others suspect that 
women whose growth was stunted in childhood or in the womb as a result of 
poverty may suffer internal organ damage that years later can place their own 
babies at risk. 
</P>
<P>
That theory, still unproven, is one of several that have surfaced recently as 
researchers have explored the racial difference in infant death, a key reason 
why the overall U.S. infant death rate is among the worst in the industrialized 
world. 
</P>
<P>
If proven, Hale believes the idea of an intergenerational health effect of 
poverty could serve as a powerful indictment of the treatment of blacks in the 
United States -- evidence that the effects of racism extend beyond 
psychological scars to long-term physiological damage. 
</P>
<P>
Other scientists are cautious about the theory. 
</P>
<P>
Some believe the racial gap in infant death can be traced entirely to social 
and economic factors. If some of the difference appears unaccounted for, they 
say it is because they have not yet identified certain subtle, social 
variables. 
</P>
<P>
Just because a white woman and a black woman have college degrees does not mean 
they have the same socioeconomic status, researchers note. A middle-class black 
woman may have grown up poor and may get worse health care than her white 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"The racial disparity seems to imply biological variation," said Dr. Woodie 
Kessel of the National Institutes of Health. "But it's not clear to me that it 
really isn't a reflection of other things that are more difficult to measure." 
</P>
<P>
Other researchers fear the notion of biological factors in infant death could 
be taken as a racist one. Even if those biological differences came from social 
rather than genetic roots, they fear the idea might seem to imply inferiority. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, some worry that the concept could be willfully misconstrued to 
justify neglecting health and social welfare programs. If the racial gap in 
infant death is biological, people might argue, why invest tax revenue in 
trying to remedy social causes? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, biological factors may be relatively insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite possible (that such factors exist)," said Dr. Paul Wise, an 
assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. "The question to 
me is not so much do they exist but their relevance. How important are they?" 
</P>
<P>
Hale, for one, intends to find out. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning on the campus of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, a 
chill wind sent bundled-up students scudding along the sidewalks. Inside the 
overheated building that houses the School of Public Health, secretaries 
battled static cling. 
</P>
<P>
Hale bustled into her office in a bomber jacket and long skirt. She wore 
running shoes to cushion her heel bones, broken two months earlier when the 
48-year-old, tenured professor of epidemiology fell off her garage roof while 
trying to break into her locked house. 
</P>
<P>
A small, bumblebee of a woman with reddish-brown hair and a laugh that bubbles 
upward in arpeggios, Hale speaks in the kind of mellifluous, modulated voice 
that might be heard doing commentary on National Public Radio. 
</P>
<P>
To understand black infant death, she was saying that one must understand two 
aspects of the black experience: First, the peculiar intensity of poverty among 
black Americans; second, the region where blacks traditionally lived. 
</P>
<P>
No group of poor whites, except perhaps in Appalachia, experienced comparable 
poverty and social isolation, Hale contended. And until the middle of this 
century, most blacks lived in a handful of Southern states with little or no 
commitment to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons we haven't done much about (infant mortality), I believe, 
is that it is seen as a problem of the poor," she said. "As a society, we have 
never been able to decide whether the poor are also deserving. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I see it as very consistent in a country that includes among its founding 
fathers the Puritans. One of their fundamental beliefs was that if God loves 
you, you aren't poor; and if you're poor, you have done something wrong in the 
eyes of God." 
</P>
<P>
The theory that Hale and others are exploring is just one of several being 
offered to help explain the racial disparity in infant death. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the racial gap is clearly traceable to income and class. Black mothers 
have less money and less schooling than whites. Income and education influence 
diet, behavior and access to health care -- which, in turn, can determine one's 
risk of having a baby die. 
</P>
<P>
But some researchers like Hale believe something else may be at work. For even 
when they take income and class into account, they still find differences in 
the average birth weights of black and white infants, and in the rates at which 
they die. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, they are looking for other possible factors. 
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and at several 
black colleges are investigating whether subtle differences in the experiences 
of middle-class blacks and whites might help account for differences in birth 
weight and infant death. 
</P>
<P>
One factor being considered is psychological stress. Stress has been linked, 
directly or indirectly, to problems in childbearing. Some researchers suspect 
that black women experience more stress than whites -- from financial and 
domestic pressures, perhaps from racism. 
</P>
<P>
They are also looking at degrees of social support among the middle-class 
blacks and whites they are studying, and at differences in income and financial 
stability between black and white women ostensibly of the same social class. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, they are examining how blacks and whites use the health care system. 
Some of the researchers suspect that middle-class blacks may turn to a doctor 
less readily than do whites, who have grown up with good access to affordable 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just money," said Bruce Wade, a Spelman College sociologist working 
on the study. "It's the way social class impacts people's attitudes -- how 
likely you are to go to a doctor, how you treat a person once a pregnancy 
occurs. 
</P>
<P>
"The effects of social class are sometimes very devastating, and it's sometimes 
things that we're not readily aware of. The idea that once a group is educated 
and brought into higher socioeconomic status, all the problems will be resolved 
-- that may not be the case." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, black and white women of seemingly similar income and education 
may in fact experience life quite differently, since social class reflects not 
only money and schooling but family history, attitudes and expectations. 
</P>
<P>
The new hypotheses are disturbing not only for what they suggest about 
long-term harm done by discrimination. They also call into question 
conventional wisdom about what it might take to eliminate the racial gap in 
infant death. 
</P>
<P>
While most researchers stress unequivocally the importance of prenatal care, 
they say even universal access to care cannot alone close the gap. It will take 
much more -- for example, a concerted attack on poverty -- to erase the effects 
of decades of deprivation, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"The gap between ethnic groups is going to be reduced or eliminated by 
addressing the issues of poverty and how poverty affects child health," said 
Dr. Irvin Emanuel, a professor of epidemiology and pediatrics at the University 
of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"If we want healthy babies, we have to have healthy children who grow up to be 
healthy adults who will have healthy babies. . . . We have to take care of our 
people. And in my view, it will take more than just one generation." 
</P>
<P>
The racial gap in infant mortality in the United States is not new. It has 
existed as long as statistics have been kept. While the black and white rates 
declined steadily over much of this century, the gap between them persisted and 
even gradually widened. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, a black baby born in 1987, the latest year for which national 
statistics exist, had less chance of surviving to age 1 than a white baby born 
in 1970 -- well before the spread of new technology made it possible to keep 
many premature babies alive. 
</P>
<P>
Now some experts fear the black-white gap will grow even wider in the 1990s. 
They cite the spread of illegal drug use among inner-city black women and the 
disproportionately high rate at which black babies are born infected with the 
AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
As Hale tells it, she became interested in infant death in the mid-1960s while 
working in the health care system of Labrador, Canada. It was there that she 
recognized the infant mortality rate for what it was -- a telling measure of a 
society's well-being. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to the United States in 1967, she moved to Montgomery, Ala., and 
began accumulating degrees in history, epidemiology, social psychology and 
demography. During the next 10 years, she waded into statistics, an 
epidemiologist's stock in trade. 
</P>
<P>
Assigned to calculate so-called standard mortality ratios for an introductory 
epidemiology course, Hale chose to compare white and black rates of infant 
death. What she found, she recalls, were two radically different sets of 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The white numbers were low, the black numbers were high. Yet Hale found it was 
common practice in epidemiology to blur the difference between the races by 
reporting one overall average rate of infant death. 
</P>
<P>
"It's two different rates and it's bad science to pool them," Hale said 
recently. "So let's just own up to the fact that the infant mortality rate in 
this country among blacks is slightly better than that of Central and South 
American countries." 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, some researchers began to suspect that income and class 
might not explain the entire racial gap, a discovery that Hale believes was 
made possible in part by the evolution of the epidemiologist's tools. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the federal government began linking birth and death 
certificates in cases of infant death. Infant death researchers could now 
estimate parents' socioeconomic status using information, such as education 
level, recorded on birth certificates. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, statisticians developed a method of analyzing data that made 
it possible to control for socioeconomic factors. Controlling for education and 
income, researchers still found that black babies were still more likely than 
whites to die. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, federal researchers studying babies born in 1980 found that 
blacks at every education level were more likely to have underweight babies. 
Even among college-educated black women, the rate was twice as high as that of 
comparable whites. 
</P>
<P>
When researchers then looked for factors that might explain that difference -- 
the mother's marital status, medical care, age, place of residence -- they 
could not fully explain the difference in the size of black and white college 
women's babies. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, they compared the pregnancies of college-educated blacks to those of 
high-school educated whites. According to Carol J.R. Hogue, of the CDC's 
division of reproductive health, the black women were 60% more likely than the 
whites to have an infant die. 
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, meanwhile, Emanuel, who is considered an expert on birth defects, 
was approaching the issue from a different angle. He had been exploring the 
relationship between a woman's stature and her ability to bear a healthy child. 
</P>
<P>
Emanuel found that smaller women are more likely to have underweight babies. 
From studies throughout the world, it seemed women born underweight were more 
likely to give birth to an underweight child. 
</P>
<P>
Emanuel came to suspect that women whose own growth was stunted in the womb or 
in childhood -- perhaps by poor nutrition, bad maternal health or inadequate 
care -- suffered long-term damage to their reproductive health that could echo 
into the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . If the overall size of a baby is compromised," Emanuel said, "then it's 
not hard to imagine that growth and development of internal organs become 
compromised." 
</P>
<P>
Hale and Emanuel began running into each other at scientific meetings in the 
early 1980s. Emanuel explained his findings to Hale, she recalls. She describes 
the discovery as "just like a big light coming on. . . . It just made so much 
sense to me." 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, they published a paper on the subject, fusing Hale's historical and 
Emanuel's biological perspectives. The question they posed was: What in the 
lives of American black women "is apparently so hazardous to fetal and infant 
health?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer lies in the mother's childhood and in the environment in which her 
pregnancies occur, they suggested. They cited numerous studies linking an 
infant's birth weight to its mother's birth weight and stature, and to her 
parents' social class. 
</P>
<P>
"A reasonable interpretation . . . is that a mother's own childhood family 
conditions affect her reproductive outcomes and the effect is greatest among 
families in which few economic resources have to be shared by many people," 
they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
That theory and others like it have been received with interest and caution. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Arthur Kohrman, professor of pediatrics at the University of Chicago and 
director of La Rabida Children's Hospital, believes there is clearly a 
biological factor in the racial differences in birth weight and infant death. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps in some women the uterus is unusually sensitive to the early onset of 
labor, he speculated. Perhaps for some biological reason, hormonal or 
neurological, they advance to full-blown labor more easily than other women. 
</P>
<P>
But scientists have been cautious about discussing biological factors, Kohrman 
contended. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want some guy saying, 'Well, if it's all biological, why are we 
putting all this money into these (social and health) programs?' " he said. 
"And in the current political climate, that's not such a far-fetched thing." 
</P>
<P>
More important, said Wise of Harvard, is the question of significance. 
</P>
<P>
While biological factors are possible, their role would probably pale by 
comparison to social and economic factors, he said. It seems more likely that 
certain social factors -- like poverty, education and family dislocation -- are 
echoing from one generation into the next. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you what proportion (of the racial gap) is due to poverty, what 
proportion is due to medical care, what proportion to smoking, or to 
generational effects," said Dr. Woodie Kessel of the National Institute of 
Child Health and Human Development. 
</P>
<P>
"They're sort of mixed in together," he said. "The issue is not to explain the 
difference but to do something about the difference." 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1989, Hale and Emanuel were married. She took a sabbatical and moved to 
Seattle to be with him. There, she worked as a visiting professor and as a 
consultant to the county health department. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Birmingham this fall, Hale mused about what comes next. 
</P>
<P>
To test the intergenerational hypothesis, Hale would like to help set up a 
study tracking the birth weights of black families over generations, to see 
whether those families that have been in the middle class the longest indeed 
have the better birth weights. 
</P>
<P>
It would also be useful to study births and infant death among Appalachian 
whites, she said. There, too, one might find additional evidence for an 
intergenerational effect of poverty on reproductive health, if it exists. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hale and Emanuel have called for research into the biological 
mechanisms by which poverty translates into poor health -- specifically, how 
experiences in the womb and in childhood in one generation "are linked to 
health hazards in the next." 
</P>
<P>
"If you are as conscious as we are of the statistics on childhood poverty, one 
has the impression of a time bomb waiting to go off," she said. "Poverty has 
become a female experience, a child experience. One in four kids live in 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
"What are we going to do? This is the labor force," she wondered, half sad, 
half angry. Then she continued -- unconstrained by academic etiquette: "We have 
screwed up our future labor supply. It's the dumbest thing a country could do."

<P>
Almost 75 years ago, Bolsheviks intent on winning over the rural masses 
promised the long-suffering peasants of Russia they would become masters of the 
land they plowed. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in hopes of feeding a country that appears to be on the brink of hunger, 
the Russian government is promising land to the peasants once again. 
</P>
<P>
It may be just as hard to deliver this time. 
</P>
<P>
Gathered in the Great Kremlin Palace are almost 900 delegates from the 
far-flung provinces of the vast Russian Federation, the Soviet heartland that 
stretches across three-quarters of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Convened for an emergency congress on land reform, the food crisis and rural 
poverty, they began battling over the issue of private land ownership early 
this week and were still at it at week's end, both from the podium and in 
nose-to-nose shouting matches in the corridors. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the congress approved in principle the government's radical plan to 
extensively sell off state land to private owners but then began work on 
amendments considered likely to strip the plan of its most crucial points. 
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, the most popular politician in the country, 
argued passionately for the selloff program as the only hope for Russian 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
"The point of the reform is to make the worker of the land into its master 
instead of a cog in the bureaucracy," he said, referring to the system of state 
and collective farms that dominate Soviet agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Ivan S. Silayev cited statistics showing that every time 
Russia in the past has moved toward private landholding, production shot up, to 
the point that by itself Russia topped America, Canada and Argentina in grain 
exports by 28% before World War I. 
</P>
<P>
Silayev claimed that public opinion polls show 64% of Soviet citizens support 
the Russian government's plan, which would force collective farms to parcel out 
land to those who want to buy it and allow private owners to buy and sell plots 
after a grace period of five years. 
</P>
<P>
For many at the congress, however, particularly die-hard Communists, the idea 
of turning land that belongs to the state -- and thus, theoretically, to the 
people -- into the object of capitalist wheeling and dealing is simply too much 
to stomach. 
</P>
<P>
"The land is not a product of labor -- it is a gift of nature," said Gennady A. 
Sivchenko, a Communist Party official from the Altai region of Siberia. 
"Therefore, buying and selling it is impermissible." 
</P>
<P>
Sivchenko also argued that collective farms are more efficient than piecemeal 
efforts and complained that it would be foolish to give land to farmers who 
lack the equipment to till it. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't work the land with your hands and a shovel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Sarayev of the Ulyanovsk region on the Volga River warned that selling 
land would put it in the hands of black marketeers and speculators, rather than 
honest farmers too poor to afford it. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, himself raised in farm country, also 
spoke out this week against private land ownership. In general, he has found 
the question so difficult that in September he proposed a nationwide referendum 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
No preparations have been made for such a plebiscite, however, and the Russian 
leadership, committed to more radical economic reforms than Gorbachev's 
national government, cannot wait. 
</P>
<P>
"Our country has reached the point when the food problem can obscure everything 
else," Yeltsin said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, debate this week indicated such a deep division among Russian deputies 
that the plan is sure to be watered down, perhaps to allow owners to bequeath 
their land but not to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
Even if private ownership were introduced now, deputies said, it would be a 
long while before it had any effect on empty Soviet store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
But if the Russian congress backs away from private land ownership, as the 
national legislature did earlier this year, "we'll still be using ration cards 
15 years from now," lawmaker Yuri Litvinov predicted.

GULF WATCH: DAY 121; 
</P>
<P>
A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
President Bush offered to send Secretary of State James A. Baker III to Baghdad 
to meet with Saddam Hussein and invited Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz to 
Washington to discuss a possible peaceful solution to the gulf crisis. But the 
President said he would not engage in discussions that would result in anything 
less than Iraq's complete withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
If Iraq does not pull out of Kuwait by the Jan. 15 deadline set by the U.N. 
Security Council, the United States is prepared to use military force and is 
confident it has "enough power to get the job done," the President said. He 
rejected suggestions that any action be delayed for months to give sanctions 
more time to work. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate response from Baghdad, but Iraq's ambassador to France, 
Abdul Razzack Hashimi, called the President's announcement "a very important 
step toward peace." Meanwhile, a statement by Iraq's Revolutionary Command 
Council called the U.N. ultimatum "illegal, null and void" and accused 
Washington of buying the votes of other nations. 
</P>
<P>
Embassy Front: 
</P>
<P>
Easing a four-month siege of the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait, Iraqi officials have 
delivered fruit, vegetables and cigarettes to diplomatic personnel inside the 
mission, President Bush disclosed. The action appeared to be either a public 
relations gesture or to signal Iraq's desire to keep the embassy standoff from 
prompting a military confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
Sens. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) and John Glenn (D-Ohio) accused the Bush 
Administration of overstating the short-term threat posed by any Iraqi nuclear 
weapons program. The President, however, said he is "not going to err on the 
side of underestimation."

CONGRESS WELCOMES BUSH'S OFFER TO IRAQ; 
</P>
<P>
REACTION: LAWMAKERS SAY THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL MATCHES THEIR MOOD AND THAT OF 
THE COUNTRY.

<P>
Members of Congress welcomed President Bush's efforts Friday to open high-level 
talks with Iraq as a sign that he is heeding the mood, both in Congress and the 
country at large, that the United States should not rush to war in the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Their enthusiasm was tempered, however, by concern that pressure to go to war 
will increase if the talks fail. And several key Democrats said Bush cannot 
make a convincing case for the use of force until economic sanctions have been 
given ample time -- at least a year -- to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Before we commit our military forces, we need to have the commitment of the 
nation," said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.). "I 
welcome this change in the Administration's policy . . . but it doesn't change 
my evaluation. . . . War should be the last resort after all other options have 
failed." 
</P>
<P>
Bush told a news conference that he has no plans to summon lawmakers back into 
a special session to debate the gulf crisis this month. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to see Congress pass a resolution enthusiastically endorsing what the 
United Nations has done," Bush said, referring to Thursday's vote by the U.N. 
Security Council authorizing use of force if Iraq has not agreed to withdraw 
from Kuwait by Jan. 15, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
But noting that he wants to avoid "a hand-wringing operation that would send 
bad signals" to Iraq, Bush said: "What I don't want to do is have it (Congress) 
come back and end up where you have 435 voices in one house and 100 in the 
other saying what not to do." 
</P>
<P>
Although several Republican senators who support the idea of calling a special 
session said they think Bush might change his mind later, other lawmakers said 
after meeting with the President on Friday that the proposal appears to be 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
Expressing the consensus view, Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) said no one is "going 
to vote for any resolution until they see what comes out" of the talks with 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, surprising lawmakers with his overture to Iraq, said he has invited Iraqi 
Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz to meet with him in Washington during the week of 
Dec. 10 and offered to send Secretary of State James A. Baker III to Baghdad 
before Jan. 15 to meet with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush also made it clear that, while he is willing "to go the extra mile for 
peace," the talks could not result in "anything less" than total Iraqi 
withdrawal from Kuwait, restoration of the deposed Kuwaiti government and 
release of all hostages now held by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"I welcome this course correction by the President," said Sen. Alan J. Dixon 
(D-Ill.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which has been 
conducting hearings on the Administration's gulf policies. "I hope it is an 
indication that the President is back to the defensive posture . . . from which 
(he) seems to have strayed in recent weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D- Mass.), another committee member who has been 
sharply critical of Bush's policies, praised the President's decision as a sign 
that the Administration finally recognizes that "neither Congress nor the 
country is ready to go to war in the Persian Gulf." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy cautioned, however, that the talks should not be used as a pretext for 
going to war in the event they fail. "Going the true extra mile means giving 
sanctions adequate time to work. The Jan. 15 fuse for war is still lit," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, a number of lawmakers and congressional aides expressed concern that 
Bush's offer to open a dialogue with Iraq might be designed as much to sway 
members of Congress as to influence Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
That belief was clearly reflected in a meeting of several key Republican 
senators shortly after the President's announcement, according to a source 
familiar with the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
"Most everybody said they thought this was a great idea because it would take 
the wind out of the sails of those (Democrats) who are trying to portray the 
President as a war-monger," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, echoing sentiments expressed by other senior Democrats, agreed that 
Bush's announcement will "add to his credibility" on Capitol Hill, where 
support for the President has been eroding since his announcement last month 
that he was doubling the initial deployment of more than 200,000 troops to the 
Persian Gulf.

COLLEGE ACTIVISTS FORM NATIONAL PEACE GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Student activists here are coordinating a nationwide effort to deliver a united 
collegiate message to George Bush and his policy-makers: no Persian Gulf war. 
</P>
<P>
Student groups have been forming across the country to protest the U.S. 
military buildup in the gulf, but students at three Washington universities 
decided that the peace movement needs a national network. 
</P>
<P>
The newly formed pacifist group, Aegis Justice, hopes eventually to bring 
together as many as 700 university organizations. The group already has the 
support of at least 200 university organizations nationwide, 23-year-old Dwayne 
Voegeli said. The group was founded by Voegeli, a senior at George Washington 
University majoring in international politics, and about 200 other students 
from Georgetown, George Washington and American universities a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Aegis Justice is organizing "teach-ins" on campuses nationwide next week and a 
student march in the capital in late January. 
</P>
<P>
Extensive national student coalitions already exist, but the Aegis Justice 
network wants to connect them and let the groups exchange ideas and lend 
support in protesting the U.S. military involvement in the Persian Gulf, 
Voegeli said. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition includes a variety of large and small, radical and conservative 
campuses, including the University of Amherst, the University of Chicago, 
Brandeis College in Massachusetts and UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Although the network is "for peace and not war, however it is done," Voegeli 
said, each student organization has its own agenda as to how the United States 
should peacefully end the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Voegeli said Aegis Justice is hoping to qualify as a nonprofit organization. 
The students now are paying for long-distance calls and faxes themselves, but 
the group has applied for private grants. 
</P>
<P>
Several regional and national student coalitions have also been synchronizing 
campus efforts. 
</P>
<P>
For example, about 50 universities from New York to the West Coast have joined 
the California Student Network Against U.S. Intervention in the Middle East. 
The group has a list of demands and is planning a series of news conferences 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been hundreds, if not thousands, of demonstrations on college 
campuses in the last month," said Rhodney Ward, a UC Berkeley senior who is 
part of a national network of about 100 colleges called the Student Action 
Union. "When we stand together, we are stronger. We can make ourselves stronger 
if we network." 
</P>
<P>
But traditionally radical campuses such as Berkeley are not the only ones 
getting involved in the peace movement. 
</P>
<P>
At the normally tranquil University of Montana in Missoula, student protests 
against the war are making the campus "a hotbed," said J. V. Bennett, a senior 
who helped form the Student Coalition for Social Responsibility a few weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Montana's coalition brings together 16 historically feuding 
groups on the campus -- fraternities and environmentalists, abortion advocates 
and opponents, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
The first Aegis Justice national newspaper will be published in February from 
the small, conservative campus of Rider College in Lawrenceville, N.J.

POST-UNITY APATHY GRIPS GERMAN VOTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
On the surface, it is a cozy tableau: The spicy fragrance of hot mulled wine 
warming a frosty evening as families thread their way through the annual 
Christmas market, stopping to buy hand-dipped candles or to treat their 
children to pony rides. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Meckelberg, an earnest high-school teacher campaigning for Parliament, 
patrols the crowd, trying to hand out pamphlets and miniature flags. 
</P>
<P>
"Get lost!" someone mutters as the candidate passes by. 
</P>
<P>
The sentiment is hardly unique to this gritty industrial valley as Germans 
prepare to vote Sunday as a united nation for the first time since Adolf Hitler 
came to power in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
In Gelsenkirchen, at least, the mood seems more "Bah, humbug" than "Ho, ho, 
ho." 
</P>
<P>
Even the politicians are having a hard time getting excited about what by all 
rights should be a significant election. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid people won't even rouse themselves to go vote this time," said 
Joachim Posz, the district's incumbent Parliament member and a Social Democrat. 
The liberal party traditionally carries an enthusiastic majority here in the 
Ruhr Valley of western Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"People are just drained emotionally," Posz explained. "We've lived through so 
much in this past year, with the Berlin Wall opening and reunification." 
</P>
<P>
His Christian Democratic challenger agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe outsiders see this as a time for jubilation across Germany again," said 
Meckelberg, "but that's not how the Germans themselves see it." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the prospect of choosing someone to lead united Germany into a new 
European era seems anti-climatic. The campaign, too, has been passionless, with 
no polarizing issues to separate the main parties, as East-West rivalries and 
disarmament did in the past. Opinion polls for months have forecast an 
overwhelming victory for Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his center-right Christian 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"An election battle without a fight," summed up the liberal Munich daily 
newspaper Sueddeutsche. 
</P>
<P>
"All other issues -- ecology, unemployment, social services -- were put on the 
back burner throughout this yearlong happening," said Gelsenkirchen City 
Manager Klaus Bussfeld. "Unification, emotionally, was like having Christmas, 
New Year's Eve and your birthday all come on the same day." 
</P>
<P>
Campaign managers made a few gimmicky attempts to recapture the drama. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Social Democrats consider one of the high points of their 
campaign here the day they made a replica of the Brandenburg Gate out of 
bedsheets. 
</P>
<P>
The party urged passers-by to stroll through the wash 'n' wear gate on 
Unification Day in October to vicariously share the thrill of Berliners whose 
once-divided city is now reconnected at the famous gate. 
</P>
<P>
This coal-and-steel town of about 300,000 people shares many of the problems 
that bedevil the five new states that once made up East Germany: unemployment, 
a severe housing shortage, environmental damage. 
</P>
<P>
And as inhabitants here watch billions of marks pour into the east in an effort 
to bring it up to western German standards, cynicism, apathy and a growing 
bitterness appear to have replaced the euphoria and optimism of Nov. 9, 1989, 
the day the Wall opened. 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't they send some of that help our way, do something to finance us, 
too?" demanded Wilhelm Katt, who works for a large foundry. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you hear about the railroad workers over there (in the east) going on 
strike for wages equal to ours?" he asked. "That's a provocation. They only pay 
a fraction what we do in rent, and they don't produce as much. Why should they 
earn the same?" 
</P>
<P>
Siegfried Dulog, a trade unionist, also complained of high expectations by the 
former East Germans. 
</P>
<P>
"In all fairness, everybody pays for unification, easterners as well as 
westerners," Dulog said. "But the problem is that we spent the past 50 years 
building our country up and now they want everything overnight. They expect too 
much too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"The mood here is no good." 
</P>
<P>
Monika Kandelbinder, 26, is similarly disgruntled and sees little point in 
going to the voting booth on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"What's it matter, anyway?" she asked from the booth where she sells her 
mother-in-law's ceramic crafts at the Christmas market. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been out of work for six years now," Kandelbinder added, "and I doubt the 
election is going to change that. 
</P>
<P>
"It hardly matters who governs us now. Their promises are the same, and so are 
their lies," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"All anybody cares about is how much unification is going to cost and who has 
to bear the cost," Kandelbinder said. "Well, it's going to be the same as it 
always is, I can tell you now. The money will go right into the pockets of the 
big shots and, as usual, the little guy will be the one paying for it all."

The new U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, Ryan Crocker, presented his credentials to 
President Elias Hrawi after reopening the U.S. Embassy, which was evacuated 15 
months ago during fierce fighting. The decision to send in Crocker, 51, despite 
the still tenuous security situation reflects U.S. support for Hrawi's 
government, which is trying to end 15 years of civil war.

A new constitution ending 15 years of Marxist rule and laying the groundwork 
for Mozambique's first multi-party elections took effect, hours after President 
Joaquim Chissano urged right-wing guerrillas to join the political mainstream. 
The constitution abolishes the one-party rule established by the Mozambique 
Liberation Front when it took power at the end of Portuguese rule in 1975. 
Chissano appealed earlier to the Mozambique National Resistance to put down its 
weapons.

The space shuttle Columbia headed into the final hours of the fifth countdown 
for an astronomy mission that has been on hold for half a year because of 
hydrogen leaks.

<P>
It is scheduled to blast off just after midnight Sunday at Cape Canaveral, 
Fla., with seven astronauts and an astronomical observatory. It will orbit 218 
miles above Earth for 10 days. The crew has been trying to reach space since 
late May, when the shuttle was grounded by the leaks.

A congressman said that FBI agents had warned him his name was on a list found 
at the home of the man charged with killing militant Rabbi Meir Kahane. Rep. 
Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.) said FBI officials also told him it could mean he was 
a possible target of terrorists.

The existence of the list of five New York leaders was reported in New York

The school board in the nation's capital fired Supt. Andrew Jenkins, citing his 
handling of the troubled school system. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted to place Jenkins on 30 days administrative leave with pay and 
terminate his contract on Dec. 30. Vice Supt. William Brown was named acting 
superintendent. The superintendent narrowly escaped firing in July, when the 
board decided to keep him on until his contract expired at the end of this 
school year. The school system has been plagued by one of the highest dropout 
rates in the nation, a declining enrollment and a shortage of funds.

INMATES TO GET $150 AND UP IF DENIED A BED

Jailed crime suspects who don't get beds within 24 hours must be paid $150, and 
$100 every 12 hours after that until beds are provided, a federal judge ruled 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Prisoners in the city's overcrowded jails are subjected to "days on end in 
holding pens without beds or proper bathroom facilities, to real and 
substantial harm," U.S. District Judge Morris Lasker wrote in his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore appropriate that inmates detained in violation of the order be 
compensated." 
</P>
<P>
Corrections officials were confident that the ruling would not prove expensive. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't be incurring costs as long as we're in compliance, and we intend to 
be in compliance," Corrections Department spokesman Vito Turso said. "That is 
the answer to this problem." 
</P>
<P>
Lasker has issued rulings on overcrowded jails for 15 years, but this was the 
first time he ordered the city to pay prisoners for bad conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"The imposition of these sanctions is done in the hope that such sums will 
never have to be paid because the department will be in compliance," Lasker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
City jails were filled to 103% capacity this week with 20,794 prisoners. All 
but one inmate got a bed within 24 hours, Turso said. 
</P>
<P>
Turso said if the plan was in effect the first two weeks of November, 250 
inmates could have collected. An average of 1,300 new inmates enter city jails 
each day.

MILLIE SENT 475 MILES TO BE SPAYED

Millie the presidential spaniel made a brief and secret visit to a veterinarian 
to be spayed, it was reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Millie, troubled by false pregnancies, was sent from the White House to the 
clinic of a Columbia veterinarian for the surgery about two weeks ago, 
television station WIS-TV said. 
</P>
<P>
The White House did not want to put Millie's difficulties in the media 
spotlight, so her Army veterinarian drove about 475 miles to Dr. Randy 
Basinger's clinic, the station reported. 
</P>
<P>
The English springer spaniel reportedly was kept overnight and driven back to 
Washington the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Basinger declined to be interviewed by the station and said the White House had 
asked him not to talk about Millie, the mother of one litter of puppies. 
</P>
<P>
Anna Perez, a White House spokeswoman, told the station, "She was spayed. This 
is a private matter . . . and a family matter. They don't want to talk about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The White House said Millie was not spayed at taxpayer expense, the station 
said.

INFORMANT WAS COACHED, HARRIS ATTORNEYS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
MURDER CASE: LAWYERS FOR THE CONVICTED KILLER CLAIM AUTHORITIES RECRUITED 
INMATE, WHO GAVE KEY TESTIMONY AT TRIAL. THE MANEUVER IS THE LATEST BID TO SAVE 
CLIENT FROM THE GAS CHAMBER.

<P>
Attorneys for Robert Alton Harris, in another try to save the convicted killer 
from the gas chamber, said Friday they have new evidence backing their claim 
that authorities improperly recruited and coached a jailhouse informant to 
testify falsely at Harris' 1979 trial. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers asked the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to order a hearing 
where they could prove the informant acted as a "police agent" and had been 
planted in Harris' cell to elicit statements to show Harris murdered his two 
teen-age victims to prevent them from testifying against him for robbery. 
</P>
<P>
The informant, Joey Dee Abshire, said in an affidavit signed Nov. 7 that 
investigators -- not Harris -- provided him with details of the crime. Abshire 
also disputed testimony by a San Diego sheriff's sergeant who said he overheard 
Harris tell Abshire he killed the boys because he "couldn't have no punks 
running around that could do that (identify him) so I wasted them." 
</P>
<P>
But while challenging the sergeant's version of the conversation, Abshire said 
in the affidavit -- just as he said at the trial -- that Harris "told me the 
boys were killed to prevent them from identifying him." 
</P>
<P>
The testimony by Abshire and the sergeant were key elements in showing the 
killings were premeditated and deliberate -- rather than impulsive -- and thus 
made Harris eligible for first-degree murder and the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. Jay M. Bloom said the new allegations had just been 
received and were being studied. "It does seem that this is a claim that could 
have been raised much earlier in a case that's 12 years old," Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, 37, is seeking a retrial in the murders of John Mayeski and Michael 
Baker, both 16, in San Diego in 1978. If he loses in his current round of 
appeals, he could become the first person to be executed in California since 
restoration of the death penalty in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The condemned man's legal team -- attorneys Charles M. Sevilla, Michael J. 
McCabe and Michael Laurence -- had contended earlier that Harris had been 
victimized by Abshire's role as police agent. But last August a federal appeals 
panel rejected the claim, citing a lack of sufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
In their new motion, Harris' lawyers said that after extensive investigation 
they had finally located Abshire and another jailhouse witness. Their new 
testimony revealed Abshire's previous statements were "false in several 
material respects," they said. Harris, they said, was the victim of a 
"carefully orchestrated maneuver" by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys said that contrary to prosecution claims, investigators had 
recruited Abshire, advised him of the specific information they needed from 
Harris, supplied details of the case, coached him on how to testify and then 
told him to "conceal his role as a state agent." 
</P>
<P>
Such conduct by officials would violate a defendant's constitutional rights and 
invalidate any resulting evidence. If a hearing is held and the state is found 
to have acted illegally, Harris could win a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
Abshire, whose current whereabouts were not divulged, said in the Nov. 7 
affidavit that when he first encountered Harris in jail Abshire considered him 
as a "nut case." Abshire said he complained to a bailiff that the inmate was 
"talking about killing kids" and subsequently was taken to an office where 
authorities told him about the case and recruited him to inform on Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Abshire said that after being placed in a cell with Harris, the accused killer 
"did not seem mentally balanced or rational," and that without the information 
he received from police, "it would have been very difficult for me to get 
Harris to say much about it." 
</P>
<P>
The informant also said that contrary to the sergeant's testimony, Harris did 
not refer to the victims as "punk" or say he had "wasted them." 
</P>
<P>
Abshire said that before the trial he met with investigators at least three 
times "to rehearse my testimony." He said he had been "coached" to say he had 
not had any discussion with authorities over what punishment he should receive 
for jail escape and theft, the charges he faced in California. In fact, Abshire 
said, he had told investigators he wanted to dispose of the charges with a 
16-month prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The informant said further he had been coached to say a deputy was outside the 
cell where he spoke with Harris and to say no one had asked him to question 
Harris about the case. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate affidavit dated Nov. 15, Sonny Arthur Wisdom said he had been in 
the jail nearby and had been surprised to hear Abshire "persisting in asking 
incriminating questions" while Harris "did very little talking." Wisdom said 
Harris did not refer to the boys as "punks" and "did not volunteer anything" 
incriminating.

POLICE CLEARED OF WRONGDOING IN YOUTH'S DEATH AT CONCERT 
</P>

<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office on Friday cleared Inglewood 
police of any wrongdoing in the death of an Orange County teen-ager who was 
forcibly arrested last Dec. 10 outside a Grateful Dead concert at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
District attorney investigators said the officer who had used a carotid 
chokehold to subdue Patrick Shanahan, 19, of Fountain Valley did not commit 
criminal homicide. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy said Shanahan died of "compression of the neck during restraint." 
The report also found a high level of LSD in his blood and bruises over his 
body. 
</P>
<P>
After subduing Shanahan with the chokehold, officers tied his ankles with a 
nylon rope, handcuffed him and carried him to a police car, investigators said. 
There, police discovered he had stopped breathing and brought him to nearby 
Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
William Shanahan, Patrick's father, said he is "very disappointed" by the 
report. "There is a lot of conflict between the police version and the witness 
version of what happened," William Shanahan said. 
</P>
<P>
The family has filed a wrongful death suit against the city. 
</P>
<P>
Police discounted reports from numerous witnesses who said they saw officers 
beating Shanahan with their nightsticks. 
</P>
<P>
Police acknowledged using force against the UC Santa Barbara student but they 
said it was necessary to defend themselves and to subdue the youth. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's report agreed, saying officers "had a legal right and 
duty" to arrest Shanahan and "the use by a single officer of a carotid hold" to 
help subdue Shanahan did not amount to a criminal homicide. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the situation, Inglewood police spokesman Sgt. Harold Moret said: 
"You've got several hundred people on hallucinogenic drugs . . . four or five 
incidents happening at one time . . . officers were using whatever force was 
necessary . . . (with) guys that were blasted out of their minds on 
hallucinogenic drugs."

<P>
Actor Burt Lancaster, star of more than 60 movies and winner of an Oscar for 
his portrayal of evangelist "Elmer Gantry," was hospitalized here Friday after 
he became ill while visiting a friend. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster, 77, was taken to Los Alamitos Medical Center by Orange County 
paramedics Friday afternoon. The call to paramedics indicated Lancaster had 
suffered a heart attack, but the initial assessment by paramedics at the scene 
was that he had suffered a stroke. Hospital officials would not release any 
details of Lancaster's condition. 
</P>
<P>
The actor's agent, Ben Benjamin, said Lancaster was admitted to the hospital's 
emergency room and that doctors there "will submit him to a series of tests." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know any more, we really don't," said Benjamin, who has worked for 
Lancaster for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
At a 5 p.m. press conference, hospital officials declined to give any details 
about Lancaster's condition. 
</P>
<P>
"Any evaluation would be premature," said Mary Ann Kopernic, director of 
nursing. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics were called to the John Douglas French Center for Alzheimer's 
Disease, about one block from the hospital, at 11:48 a.m., where Lancaster 
reportedly was visiting a friend. He arrived at the hospital by noon. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stephen Reed, medical director of the Alzheimer's disease center, while not 
confirming that Lancaster had been there, said he had conferred with the 
actor's family, who asked that he not release any information. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster's physician, Gary Sugarman, arrived at the hospital in the late 
afternoon, but also refused comment. "I really can't say anything about his 
health," he said. 
</P>
<P>
News media were ordered out of the hospital and three Los Alamitos Police 
Department officers were called in to escort journalists into the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster, who celebrated his birthday Nov. 2, won his Academy Award in 1960 
for "Elmer Gantry" and five years earlier shared an Oscar as co-producer of 
"Marty," which won Best Picture honors. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster had undergone multiple coronary artery bypass surgery Aug. 26, 1983, 
at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he filmed "Little Treasure" six months after the surgery and 
continued working steadily in films and television, Lancaster was denied the 
title role in "The Old Gringo" in 1988 because of his heart condition. Columbia 
decided that insurance on him would be too expensive and hired Gregory Peck 
instead. Lancaster filed a still-pending lawsuit.

DISPUTE GROWS OVER SHOOTING BY BORDER PATROLMAN

A controversy surrounding the U.S. Border Patrol shooting of a 15-year-old 
Mexican boy intensified Friday, when the police in Calexico accused Mexican 
lawmen of refusing them access to the boy and otherwise thwarting their 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Friday, Calexico Police Chief Leslie Ginn also charged 
that Mexican police withheld other vital evidence -- including the 9-millimeter 
bullet that injured the youth, the teenager's clothing and various police and 
ambulance reports. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican authorities denied the charges and explained that the youth's slow 
recovery had prompted doctors to forbid a police interview. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Calexico police said the Border Patrol agent who shot the boy on 
Nov. 18 did so when the youth, perched atop the border fence, prepared to throw 
a rock at the agent. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Eduardo Garcia Zamores, who is recuperating in a Mexicali hospital, 
denied he had a rock or made threats against the agent, according to Marco E. 
Lopez, the San Diego attorney who is representing the youth in a $9-million 
civil negligence claim filed this week against the Border Patrol. Four 
witnesses have supported his version. 
</P>
<P>
The Border Patrol has declined to discuss the case or identify the agent. 
</P>
<P>
The case has ignited protests at the Mexicali-Calexico border, one of which 
resulted Wednesday in a nine-hour shutdown of the international port and a halt 
of the flow of commerce and travelers. 
</P>
<P>
The agent has been reassigned to other duties pending the outcome of the case.

Realtor Steve Weston, who handled the sale, said the ranch sold for $975,000. 
</P>
<P>
Over more than four decades, the ranch appeared in "Gunsmoke" and other Western 
TV series, as well as Saturday afternoon serials and such classics as "High 
Noon." 
</P>
<P>
Autry kept it for some years as a home for his horse Champion. He decided to 
sell after the horse died this year and was buried at the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to find a buyer who would preserve it," Weston said. He said the 
company that bought the property asked not to be identified until escrow closes 
in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Autry, now 83 and owner of the California Angels baseball team and KMPC radio, 
could not be reached for comment. His secretary said he has been recuperating 
from eye surgery at his Studio City home. 
</P>
<P>
But Weston said Autry and his wife, Jackie, are pleased that the ranch will be 
preserved. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita officials said they are happy that the few Western sets and 
buildings that remain on the ranch in the Placerita Canyon area will not be 
bulldozed and replaced by houses. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have hated to have seen a housing development called something like 
Melody Acres or Autry Acres there," said Jerry Reynolds of the Santa Clarita 
Valley Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
Autry made the first of his 93 feature films on the then 110-acre ranch in the 
1930s when it belonged to Monogram Studios. He bought the property in 1952 
after Monogram folded. 
</P>
<P>
The cowboy star installed a miniature railroad to crisscross the many Western 
sets and buildings already on the property and continued to make his movies 
there. Among them were "Rancho Grande," "Melody Ranch," "Apache Country" and 
"On Top of Old Smokey," which produced a million-selling record for Autry. 
</P>
<P>
Other cowboy stars also made films at Melody Ranch -- Rogers, Cooper, Wayne, 
William Boyd as Hopalong Cassidy, and Clayton Moore as the Lone Ranger. Most, 
like Autry, played modest and virtuous good guys who wore white hats, fought 
for law and order and almost never kissed the heroine. 
</P>
<P>
"Joel McCrea made pictures out there, and Randolph Scott used it, John Wayne, 
and I guess just about everybody else sooner or later," Autry said in a 1988 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
He said then that he planned to open the ranch to the public in 1962, when a 
spectacular fire destroyed $1 million worth of movie sets, including 54 
buildings, and countless items from Autry's collection of Western artifacts -- 
stagecoaches, guns, Indian relics, Autry's film wardrobe and 17,500 recordings. 
</P>
<P>
The fire ended Autry's dream of turning the ranch into a tourist attraction and 
he sold off all but the last 10 acres to developers. Weston said Autry kept 
that for Champion III, the third of his movie horses. 
</P>
<P>
What remains of the ranch is not in the wide-open spaces of its heyday. It is 
now surrounded by upscale homes, some in the $1-million range.

<P>
Actor Burt Lancaster, star of more than 60 movies and winner of an Oscar for 
his portrayal of an evangelist in "Elmer Gantry," was hospitalized here Friday 
after he became ill while visiting a friend. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster, 77, was taken to Los Alamitos Medical Center by Orange County 
paramedics Friday afternoon. The call to paramedics indicated that Lancaster 
had suffered a heart attack, but the initial assessment by paramedics at the 
scene was that he had suffered a stroke. Hospital officials would not release 
any details of Lancaster's condition, but said he was resting comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
"He's stable," Lancaster's personal physician, Gary Sugarman, said as he left 
the hospital about 6:45 p.m. The doctor declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The actor's agent, Ben Benjamin, said Lancaster was admitted to the hospital's 
emergency room and that doctors there "will submit him to a series of tests." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know any more, we really don't," said Benjamin, who has worked for 
Lancaster for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
At a 10:15 p.m. press conference, hospital officials said they were not 
releasing details on Lancaster's illness at the request of his family. They 
also declined to comment on reports that the actor has suffered a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ann Kopernick, director of nursing, said Lancaster was admitted at 12:13 
p.m. "after visiting friends in the area." 
</P>
<P>
"He was taken to emergency and is undergoing continuing medical evaluation. The 
medical center is respecting the wishes of the Lancaster family and will update 
his condition when we receive permission from the family to do so." 
</P>
<P>
Kopernick said Lancaster was resting comfortably and some family members were 
with him. She said she did not know how long Lancaster would be in the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics were called to the John Douglas French Center for Alzheimer's 
Disease, about one block from the hospital, at 11:48 a.m., where Lancaster 
reportedly was visiting a friend. Dr. Stephen Reed, medical director of the 
Alzheimer's disease center, while not confirming that Lancaster had been there, 
said he had conferred with the actor's family, who asked that he not release 
any information. 
</P>
<P>
News media personnel were ordered out of the hospital, and three Los Alamitos 
Police Department officers were called in to escort journalists into the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster, who celebrated his birthday Nov. 2, won his Academy Award in 1960 
for "Elmer Gantry" and five years earlier shared an Oscar as co-producer of 
"Marty," which won Best Picture honors. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster is also well known for starring roles in "Birdman of Alcatraz," 
"Judgment at Nuremberg," "Atlantic City," "From Here to Eternity" and "Come 
Back Little Sheba." 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster, a onetime circus acrobat, began his acting career with roles that 
showcased his athletic prowess, such as the swashbuckler "The Flame and the 
Arrow" and "Trapeze." 
</P>
<P>
More recently, his films have included "Field of Dreams," "Local Hero" and 
"Rocket Gibraltar." He reportedly was released from the film "The Old Gringo" 
in 1988 because of his frail health. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Lancaster married television production coordinator Susan 
Scherer, 48. It is his third marriage. He has five grown children.

O.C. DELEGATION IN MIDDLE OF GOP LEADERSHIP BRAWL; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: CONSERVATIVE DISSENTERS LEAD FIGHT TO DUMP RIVERSIDE'S LEWIS OVER TAX 
ISSUE. BUT HE MIGHT HIT BACK.

<P>
Several conservative Orange County congressmen have plunged headlong into a 
high-stakes political battle that could change the shape of the House 
Republican leadership as well as their own standing in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The leadership fight, which will begin in earnest Monday, is attributable in 
part to a deep schism between the White House and GOP conservatives over tax 
hikes contained in the recently enacted deficit-reduction plan. 
</P>
<P>
But the looming showdown also reflects a growing restiveness among Republican 
congressmen from California with the tight rein that House leaders have kept on 
key assignments within the state delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Angered by GOP leadership arm-twisting on behalf of White House-sanctioned tax 
increases, two Orange County lawmakers are among those leading the fight to 
remove Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) from his post as chairman of the House 
Republican Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Reps. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) and Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) 
argue that Lewis not only bucked the will of most GOP members by supporting the 
budget package, he also sought to stifle dissent on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach), whose district 
includes northwestern Orange County, said he too would oppose Lewis for the top 
conference post. But in an interview Friday, Rohrabacher said he was 
reconsidering his position. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis is the third-highest-ranking Republican in the House, behind Minority 
Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.), who is widely expected to retire in two 
years, and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who also is seeking Lewis' 
ouster as conference chairman. Gingrich and Lewis are considered top contenders 
for Michel's job. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), who represents southern Orange 
County, is challenging Lewis on another front. Although he wants Lewis to keep 
his job as conference chairman, Packard is campaigning to replace the San 
Bernardino County lawmaker as California's representative on the powerful party 
panel that makes GOP congressional committee assignments. 
</P>
<P>
Packard argues that Lewis and Rep. William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield) for too 
long have tied up too many key leadership posts within the California 
Republican delegation, including Lewis' post as the state's representative on 
the Republican Committee on Committees. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's fifth congressman, Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), is 
backing Lewis for the post of conference chairman and is still weighing how he 
will vote for the Committee on Committees post. 
</P>
<P>
If the effort to unseat Lewis from either position fails, the county delegation 
could earn the lasting enmity of Lewis, a powerful member of the House 
Appropriations Committee who played a key role in securing federal funds to 
begin construction of the Santa Ana River flood-control project. 
</P>
<P>
However, if Lewis is ousted as conference chairman or if Packard wins the seat 
on the Committee on Committees, the eventual rewards for Orange County could be 
significant. 
</P>
<P>
In moving to oust Lewis as conference chairman, Dannemeyer and Dornan have 
allied themselves with Gingrich, who led the revolt against the White 
House-backed budget package in the House in October. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich is backing the candidacy of Rep. Carl D. Pursell (R-Mich.), who 
publicly opposed the budget package and admonished White House Chief of Staff 
John Sununu for attempting to browbeat Republican lawmakers into accepting the 
tax increases it contained. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer said he was less upset by Lewis' support for the tax package than by 
what he described as Lewis' efforts to tilt the debate among House Republicans 
toward the White House position. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, someone in leadership . . . has to have an even hand in giving the 
different factions an opportunity to speak their mind, and on that point I 
think Jerry Lewis is faulted," Dannemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
When he complained, Dannemeyer said, "Lewis' offhand comment was, 'If you don't 
like what I'm doing, you can replace me as conference chairman.' And so we are 
seeking to accommodate the gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
Early last week, Rohrabacher said he would oppose Lewis, explaining, "There's 
widespread dissatisfaction with Jerry among conservatives." On Friday, however, 
Rohrabacher said he was rethinking his position. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still just as upset about (Lewis') budget position," Rohrabacher said. 
"But I think I owe it to Jerry and myself to take a close look at all the 
issues that are being considered, and not just one vote." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis defended his role in the budget debate. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to have a role in the process," he said, "you've got to be 
able to deal with the majority as well. I did not get elected simply to be a 
bomb thrower or to take on the majority at every turn, regardless. 
Obstructionism does not lead to the best public policy." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "The combative approach, the confrontation for the sake of 
confrontation, is a major factor for our dropping from 191 (House members) for 
Republicans to 167" since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer acknowledged that failure to oust Lewis after taking a public stand 
against him is a risky proposition that could come back to haunt Orange County 
lawmakers. "That's always a possibility," he said, "but I do not choose to live 
my political life on the premise of fear." 
</P>
<P>
Cox said he opposes the move to oust Lewis as conference chairman because it 
would be counterproductive. "It would be truly shooting ourselves in the foot," 
he said, to remove a Californian as head of the conference and replace him with 
a representative from Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very much in the interests of California to have a Californian at the 
head of the conference," Cox said. He also noted that Pursell, whose district 
includes Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan, is far less conservative 
than Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"I like Carl Pursell," Cox said. "But objectively, Carl's challenge to Jerry 
has to be viewed as a challenge from the left, and I don't think that is in the 
interest of the delegation." 
</P>
<P>
But geography and ideology appear to pale beside the issue of taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing on the conservative agenda right now is the tax increase," 
said Duane M. Higgins, director of congressional relations for the Heritage 
Foundation, a conservative think tank. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives "saw with fear when the Democrats started using the anti-tax 
issue across the country to defeat Republicans," Higgins said. "These 
(conservative) Republicans are saying, "Our issue is gone. What do we do?". . . 
The tax issue is the one thing they can't stand to see taken away." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Pursell's stands on other issues apparently are of far less 
importance to many conservatives than his staunch opposition to the White House 
position on the budget package. 
</P>
<P>
The five Orange County congressmen, and other conservatives, are scheduled to 
meet Sunday evening in Dannemeyer's Capitol Hill office to plot a strategy that 
may include offering their own slate for offices to be filled by the state GOP 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer would not comment directly on the meeting. "Let's just say that I 
think there are jobs within the delegation that should be shared with other 
members, and I think there will be nominees for those slots."

IT'S NO MORE COUNCIL FIGHTS FOR ANAHEIM'S KAYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Leaving her post as Anaheim's first and only city councilwoman for the last 16 
years is a lot easier for Miriam Kaywood than she had imagined. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the stacks and stacks of literature, staff reports and the three local 
daily newspapers that she reportedly spent 90 hours each week plowing through, 
preparing for the weekly council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't believe I could do that," she said about tossing the volumes of 
paperwork cluttering her council office into recycle bins. 
</P>
<P>
Also gone are bitter public disputes with Mayor Fred Hunter and Councilman 
William D. Ehrle, her rivals on the council over the past couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter has a new council majority -- which includes Ehrle and Councilman Bob 
Simpson -- and Kaywood said she would rather leave the rancorous City Hall 
battles to her longtime political ally, Councilman Irv Pickler. It was Pickler, 
ironically, who survived citywide balloting on Nov. 6 by finishing 146 votes 
ahead of Kaywood. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be total frustration," said Kaywood, 67. "I would much rather not be 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson replaced Kaywood, which leaves only men on the council, as it was until 
1974 when Kaywood first won a seat. No other women have served on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Though Kaywood was never considered by her colleagues to be a great champion of 
feminist values, the absence of a woman's voice on the council is likely to be 
felt, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I never considered myself a spokesperson for women," Kaywood said, although 
members of the Planning Commission often said she filled that role. 
</P>
<P>
"They always used to say, 'This is the women's voice,' and I would say, 'Well, 
why then, why does it take six men?' " 
</P>
<P>
Kaywood is proud of her fight to keep council salaries at a minimum, an issue 
that has resurfaced since the election with a plan to triple members' pay. 
</P>
<P>
She worked to prevent the proliferation of freeway billboards, and helped 
ensure residents' rights to public hearings on proposed developments in their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Although she doesn't see herself as an unofficial watchdog, Kaywood recently 
watched the first meeting of the new council on television. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just worried that they're not reading the agendas and they're making bad 
decisions," she said. As an example, she pointed to a drawn-out discussion that 
the council held about pinning rebuttal arguments to a ballot initiative on 
mobile home rent control. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 2 not to include a rebuttal. 
</P>
<P>
"There could be the biggest misstatement on that ballot and the ordinance would 
go to the voters," Kaywood said. "How could they tie their hands behind their 
backs like that? And if they didn't know or understand what they did, (that's) 
even worse." 
</P>
<P>
Her former colleagues had mixed comments about Kaywood's departure. Most agreed 
that she will continue to have an effect on the city. 
</P>
<P>
"She will not retire," said Simpson, whom Kaywood did not support when he was 
seeking the city manager's job in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"She will indeed be around. . . . Even though we didn't always agree, we needed 
a loyal opposition," Ehrle said of Kaywood. 
</P>
<P>
Pickler, her longtime friend on the council, said that Kaywood made the city "a 
better place." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the citizens have got the best end of the deal," Pickler added. 
</P>
<P>
Kaywood, a widow, has few plans. She said she probably won't join any city 
boards or commissions but hasn't completely ruled out the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
"The friends I have made through my council work have been a blessing for 
life," she said. "I don't want to think about or do anything yet but relax and 
enjoy my new baby granddaughter."

FIRE RATING HIKE MAY CUT INSURANCE COSTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
About 7,000 companies in Fullerton could have their fire insurance rates cut by 
up to 20% because the city's insurance rating has improved. 
</P>
<P>
The ranking by Insurance Services Office, an advisory agency formed by the 
insurance companies to evaluate a community's firefighting capabilities, is 
based on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being lowest. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's rating has improved from Class 4 to Class 2. 
</P>
<P>
During the evaluation, which took place in August, insurance graders examined 
everything from Fire Department staffing and equipment to the community's water 
system, including hydrant locations and capacity, Fire Chief Ron Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 29 cities in Orange County, only Anaheim and Santa Ana are ranked Class 
1. Nine other county cities are ranked Class 2. Coleman said the majority of 
cities in the nation are Class 4. 
</P>
<P>
Because Fullerton scored 85 points out of a possible 100, Coleman said the 
agency has given the city a month to decide whether it wants to attempt a Class 
1 rating, which could reduce insurance rates further. If the city does not wish 
to upgrade, it would have to wait 10 years for the next evaluation. ERIK

HOMEOWNERS SETTLE SUIT AGAINST BUILDER 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of condominium owners who claimed they were the victims of shoddy 
workmanship have reached a $7.5-million settlement with the developer, the 
plaintiffs' attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for a cash payment from Quail Ridge Associates to the Quail 
Ridge Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Quail Ridge Associates is a joint venture between Newport Beach-based 
builder/developer Konwiser Corp. and the National Life Insurance Co. of 
Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1977, the 144-unit Quail Ridge complex is located at Associated Road 
and Rolling Hills Drive in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1985 lawsuit against the developer, the homeowners alleged major 
construction defects, including corrosive soils, inadequate foundations, 
inadequate compaction of soil, expansive soils, plumbing defects and defective 
balconies. During the litigation, the homeowners contended that at least $12 
million would be needed to repair the condo complex. But Quail Ridge Associates 
argued that repairs could be made for $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
"To my knowledge, this is one of the largest up-front cash settlements in 
Orange County's history," said Wes Davis, the plaintiffs' attorney. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the settlement, retired Judge Jerrold S. Oliver of Judicial 
Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. ruled that the homeowners can move 
ahead with plans to sue the insurance companies that represented Konwiser Corp. 
for an additional $5.5 million, Davis said. The companies to be listed in that 
suit include Maryland Casualty Co., Commercial Union Insurance Cos., Argonaut 
Insurance Cos. and Mission American.

KWIZ radio, which had until today to solve interference problems caused by its 
antenna, has successfully addressed the complaints of residents and will 
continue to broadcast from a hillside in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the City Council ordered the station to deal with the complaints or 
risk losing the conditional use permit that allowed it to broadcast from the 
western slope of Crawford Hills. 
</P>
<P>
KWIZ, operated by Liberman Broadcasting, has broadcast adult contemporary music 
for years through the television sets, tape decks and telephones of area 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
The station spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars to resolve 
problems at 73 homes, according to station officials. The company hired 
engineers and other personnel to make more than 100 house calls to community 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Grindle, one of the residents who helped bring the problem to the 
council's attention, congratulated KWIZ for "taking the bull by the horns" and 
addressing the complaints. MARY HELEN BERG

According to the latest assessment, the value of property in the state of 
California has reached almost $1.6 trillion, and 10% of it is in Orange County. 
The county's $158.5 billion worth of property has increased 11.6% during the 
last year, in line with the statewide change but somewhat less than the 
five-county urban Southern California area. Here's how Orange County stacks up 
against its four neighbors:

<P>
CONTROVERSIES ASIDE, CITY IS ONE YEAR OLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Laguna Niguel is celebrating its first year of cityhood today, and listening to 
residents of this hilly community is like hearing the parents of a colicky 
child. Sure, it's been tough -- certainly not what they expected -- but they 
don't want to give the baby back. 
</P>
<P>
And they're not about to say bad things about this new town on its birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Even people who fought incorporation, or who were cool to the idea, said they 
have warmed up to their toddling city, which has suffered growing pains in 12 
tumultuous months. 
</P>
<P>
While residents complained that divisive issues such as ridgeline protection 
have splintered the community, others insisted that the city is more united as 
a result of the shared, arduous journey. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, said Dennis Head, who fought cityhood until the last minute, when you 
pay property taxes of $9,000 a year for a "starter mansion," you're likely to 
go to bat for your city, once you get one. 
</P>
<P>
"We just pay dearly for this," Head said. "And all we're asking for is the 
'Leave It to Beaver' tranquility we all grew up watching on TV. And I think we 
can have it in Laguna Niguel." 
</P>
<P>
The word "tranquility," however, is not likely to come from the lips of most 
officials in Laguna Niguel, where controversies abound. 
</P>
<P>
A grand jury investigation is continuing regarding a land transaction that 
occurred before incorporation. In the transaction, the public's right to 96 
acres of open space was relinquished to a developer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all five council members are targeted for recall because of 
positions they have taken on a ridgeline-protection initiative. And property 
owners have said the city could be sued to the brink of bankruptcy if the 
initiative becomes law and they are prohibited from building on their land. 
</P>
<P>
The city also suffered a blow this year when it lost a court battle with Dana 
Point over a pricey parcel known as Monarch Beach, which would have given 
landlocked Laguna Niguel a pathway to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel has had controversies that some established cities don't 
experience until they are more than five years old, City Clerk Juanita Zarilla 
said. "As far as handling it," she added, "I think everybody's really pulling 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Patricia Bates said a local government that is immediately responsive to 
residents' concerns is in place and an "exceedingly competent staff" has been 
hired. 
</P>
<P>
Achievements some residents point to are the creation of a gang-suppression 
team and a program to educate children about community safety and drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see changes in all levels of service," added Joe Davis, police chief and 
longtime resident. "We've almost doubled the number of cops on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me the things like street repairing and repainting are occurring," 
he added. "I see better long-range planning -- more responsiveness (to) 
inquiries.' 
</P>
<P>
Some residents say it is worth the disruptions of the first year to bring local 
control to their community. "Whether people like the ultimate decisions or not, 
I think what we have gained are decision makers who do listen to us," said 
cityhood proponent Cindy O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Meehan, who was undecided about incorporation a year ago, said she has 
been won over. "I wasn't sure of it when we first decided to go ahead with it, 
and I'm real happy now that we did," Meehan said. "Of course, it saddens me, 
too, with all the turmoil we've gone through in the past year." 
</P>
<P>
While some admit projects have been stalled while city officials grapple with 
unexpected problems, others say Laguna Niguel may be tougher because of 
withstanding its first-year tribulations. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us came down here with a little bit of a dream, and I don't think 
we're losing it,' Head said. "You tend to grow as a result of some pain. We 
tend to appreciate our prosperity as a result of the struggle. And I think 
there's a wonderful sense of community here." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal, whose life was once "consumed" with the fight for cityhood, said it was 
worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We may be off to a rocky beginning," she said, 'but I still think we have a 
bright future."LESLIE EARNEST

<P>
The 1990 Times Orange County Holiday Parade begins today at 10:30 a.m. in 
downtown Santa Ana. This year's theme is "Learning -- Celebrate Life's 
Adventure," with nationally known teacher Jaime Escalante as grand marshal. 
</P>
<P>
Escalante's achievements in an East Los Angeles high school were portrayed in 
the 1988 movie, "Stand and Deliver." 
</P>
<P>
Attractions include celebrities, floral floats, high school marching bands, 
equestrian units and giant balloons of Mighty Mouse, Popeye and Olive Oyl, 
Raggedy Ann and Heathcliff the Cat. 
</P>

CLAUS, CLAWS AND PAWS FOR GOOD CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With their masters in tow, "Beary" Qualls, "Spiker" Tassie and "Clyde" Hubbard 
were among those who spent much of Friday morning panting and squirming but, 
for the most part, waiting patiently in the Santa Claus line at Laguna Hills 
Mall. 
</P>
<P>
In Clyde's case, "tow" is most appropriate, considering he is a 92-pound basset 
hound who has a tug much bigger than his bite. 
</P>
<P>
"He's kind of strong-willed," said Frank Hubbard of Orange, who had his hands 
full keeping himself from being dragged across the mall's tile floor. "But he's 
very friendly." 
</P>
<P>
The line of dogs and cats and their owners wrapped around Santa's house in the 
center of the mall on the opening day of the "Santa Claws and Paws" event, a 
chance for the humans to get pictures of their animals on Santa's lap. Or 
between Santa's legs, as in the case of two Great Danes owned by the Hainline 
family of Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from "Santa Claws and Paws" go to the San Clemente Animal Shelter. 
Last year, during its first run in Laguna Hills, the popular event featuring 
local veterinarians posing as Santa had pets and owners lined up out the mall 
door and raised about $6,000 for the shelter, said Arlene Eisenstadt, a mall 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an award-winner," said Eisenstadt. "Lots of malls are copying it now 
because it won (an award) which is the Oscar or Emmy of shopping centers." 
</P>
<P>
"Beary" Qualls, a 4-year-old chowchow from El Toro, wouldn't know an Oscar from 
a pet rock, but he definitely knew he enjoyed the biscuit tossed his way after 
posing happily on Santa's lap. His master, Jan Qualls, said Beary's photo is on 
its way to the Middle East to her husband, a Marine pilot. 
</P>
<P>
No such faraway destination is in the works for the photograph of "Abigail" 
Barbour, whose proud owners are Maggie and Bob Barbour of Laguna Niguel. But 
the 3-year-old dog has lofty pretensions nonetheless, being that her pedigree 
is that of a King Charles cavalier spaniel, the preferred pet of England's King 
Charles II. 
</P>
<P>
Abigail stood in line among all those mutts, mixed breeds and hounds and 
finished up wagging her tail. "She's real lovable and cuddly," Maggie Barbour 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was "Spiker" Tassie, a 5-year-old orange-colored cat who was resting 
calmly with his master, DeAnna Tassie of Laguna Beach, and her grandfather, 
Bill Tassie of Costa Mesa. After fighting off coyotes and winning friends all 
over the neighborhood, DeAnna Tassie said, Spiker could handle the commotion of 
a mall full of excited dogs and cats. 
</P>
<P>
"He's from Laguna," she said. "He's very mellow." 
</P>
<P>
All in all, the two-hour event went off without a hitch, although a maintenance 
man with a rag and a can of cleaner was kept very busy. But there were no 
tussles or fights; not even a snarl was heard in the house. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest commotion may have occurred when Clyde, the heavy basset hound, 
climbed up in Santa's lap. 
</P>
<P>
Santa, actually Dr. Paul Schneider of Capistrano Beach, spent the entire two 
hours handling the four-legged creatures as only a veterinarian could. 
</P>
<P>
"The big ones are the tough ones," Schneider said with a good-hearted smile. 
"But all things considered, it went pretty well. Anything can happen in an 
environment like this." 
</P>
<P>
The pet photographs cost $6 each, but a $1 discount is given to people who 
donate a new or nearly new book to help build a library for Human Options, a 
counseling group that operates a shelter for abused women and children in 
Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Claws and Paws" continues today from 8 to 10 a.m. and from 7 to 9 p.m. 
and Sunday from 8 to 10 a.m. and from 6 to 8 p.m. LEN HALL

From the day the football season began, Capistrano Valley High School wide 
receiver Dave Poltl has been chasing the Orange County career record for 
receptions. He needed 80 to pass the 169 caught by Rick Parma (Kennedy, 
1973-75). 
</P>
<P>
Well, No. 80 finally came Friday night. With 6 minutes 8 seconds left in the 
game between the Cougars and Mission Viejo, Poltl caught a 15-yard pass in the 
flat to surpass Parma. 
</P>
<P>
But No. 81 -- for a 72-yard touchdown -- was even more important. It gave the 
Cougars a two-touchdown lead and helped advance them to the Southern Section 
Division II title game. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley held on to defeat Mission Viejo, 26-24, with much of credit 
belonging to Poltl, who now has 173 career receptions. 
</P>
<P>
For the game, he had six catches for 142 yards and one touchdown. As it has 
been for the past three seasons, many of his catches came in clutch situations. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no better receiver in the county than Dave," Capistrano Valley Coach 
Eric Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars avenged a 28-13 loss to the Diablos on Oct. 26. In that game, Poltl 
had seven receptions for 126 yards but did not score. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half Friday, it looked like he might again be kept out of the end 
zone. The Cougars relied on their running game, so Poltl had only two 
receptions for 20 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The second gave him the record. 
</P>
<P>
"The record has been one of my goals this season, but winning the championship 
is the bigger goal," said Poltl, who has 84 catches for 1,312 yards. "I was 
glad to get the record out of the way early so I could concentrate on the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not Poltl's concentration improved in the second half, his 
productivity certainly did. 
</P>
<P>
On the first play after halftime, Tony Solliday audibilized and hit Poltl on 
the fly. Poltl outran everyone for the 72-yard score. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw that they didn't have a free safety back there," Solliday said. "You 
can't cover Dave one-on-one." 
</P>
<P>
The Diablos learned their lesson. For the rest of the game, Poltl was shadowed 
by at least two defenders. On one play, he was followed by four -- two 
defensive backs and two linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
But the extra attention didn't slow Poltl. He went on to catch four passes for 
122 yards in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Poltl made two key receptions during a third-quarter drive that ended in a 
37-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
On fourth and three, Poltl made a six-yard reception. On third-and-four, he 
made another six-yard catch. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the coach that I wanted the ball," Poltl said. "I knew I could make the 
plays. I wanted this victory." 
</P>
<P>
He got it, and, the record, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I glad that's over," he said.

Coach John Reardon and his staff at Rio Mesa High School in Oxnard have a trip 
planned for today. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches will drive 140 miles to Mission Viejo to watch what Reardon calls 
"the elite football program in the CIF." 
</P>
<P>
That would be Paramount, which has the longest winning streak in the Southern 
Section (20 victories) and will meet host El Toro in the semifinals of the 
Division II playoffs at Mission Viejo High. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount, the pride of the San Gabriel Valley, has won 38 of 40 games and 
produced some of the top athletes in the section in each of the past three 
years. The team is worth the drive, Reardon says. 
</P>
<P>
"People tend to take teams like Paramount for granted," he said. "We watched 
them on film and then played them in the first round (27-7 loss), and I was 
impressed, but not overly impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, we watched them last week against Muir, and I said to myself, 'This is a 
great team with great team speed.' They have so many gifted athletes and are so 
well coached. It took a second look before I realized just how good they really 
are." 
</P>
<P>
Paramount (12-0), which moved up to Division II this year, is a two-time 
Division III champion. The Pirates beat Los Alamitos, 30-20, in the 1988 title 
game and El Toro, 26-20, last year behind the play of quarterback Jack Manu. 
</P>
<P>
Manu is playing at Riverside College, but Steve Lopez has more than filled his 
shoes at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, a 6-foot-2, 190-pound senior, has passed for 1,492 yards and 22 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"Manu was such an impact player," El Toro Coach Bob Johnson said. "I really 
thought they would have trouble replacing him, but Lopez throws a better ball 
and runs every bit as well as Manu did." 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's running game features tailback Leon Neal and fullback Demondre 
White. Neal has rushed for 1,480 yards in 153 carries for a 9.7 average. White 
has 807 yards in 103 carries for a 7.8 average. 
</P>
<P>
"Neal is the best running back I've seen in 20 years of coaching," Reardon 
said. "He has the uncanny ability to stop on a dime and then accelerate so 
quickly that a defense can't possibly react. White is a tough kid with pure 
speed. It's a great combination." 
</P>
<P>
But El Toro (11-1) has contained running backs all season. Only freshman George 
Keiaho of Buena has managed to top the 100-yard mark, getting 146 in a 40-12 El 
Toro victory in the opening round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount and El Toro met in the second round of the 1986 playoffs, and El Toro 
won, 28-8. Johnson said he could foresee that Coach Ken Sutch was building one 
of the section's elite programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Year in and year out, they have superior athletes," he said. "They don't do 
anything fancy. They beat you at the fundamentals." 
</P>
<P>
Reardon sees tonight's game as a matchup between Paramount's secondary and the 
passing of El Toro quarterback Rob Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has completed 196 of 281 pass attempts for 2,596 yards and 28 
touchdowns. He has thrown only six interceptions. Paramount's secondary has 17 
interceptions. "We watched El Toro play Buena, and I felt El Toro was playing 
at a different level," Reardon said. "Then, we watched Paramount against Muir 
and felt the same way. These are two outstanding teams, but Paramount is 
probably playing the best football in the CIF at this time."

DIVISION VI: RANCHO ALAMITOS FOOTBALL GAVE LEONARD SIMS PROSPECTS FOR A BRIGHT 
FUTURE. THE VAQUEROS GOT A TOP LINEMAN IN RETURN.

<P>
Growing up in Crow Village, a part of town where it's not rare to hear gunshots 
during the night, Leonard Sims faced certain environmental hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Although he never joined the gang in his neighborhood, Sims wasn't one to back 
down when challenged, and that happened quite often. There was a time Sims 
would fight at the drop of a word. But not anymore. These days, Sims limits his 
fights to the football field -- where he can hit people without getting in 
trouble -- and he says that's the reason he has overcome his past troubles, 
stayed at Rancho Alamitos High School and has a chance to play college 
football. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally woke up and said this ain't for me," Sims said. "I probably wouldn't 
be in school right now if it weren't for football. I probably would have been 
kicked out or something." 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos (10-2) plays Tustin (12-0) in the Southern Section Division VI 
semifinals at 7:30 tonight at Garden Grove High. The Vaqueros hadn't qualified 
for the playoffs since 1982. Now they are a game away from playing for the 
championship, thanks in large part to Sims, a senior who anchors both the 
offensive and defensive lines. 
</P>
<P>
On offense, Sims, a two-time first-team All-Garden Grove League selection, is 
the aggressive leader of a powerful ground game. Sims likes to take the active 
role of a pulling blocker, preferring to get a running start before hitting 
defenders more than the more-passive pass-blocking. 
</P>
<P>
The past two seasons, Sims has been part of a line that blocked for Orange 
County's leading rusher. Last season, Dana Riddle led the state in the regular 
season with 2,082 yards in 381 carries. This year, Ulysses Trammell has gained 
1,965 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Sims is serious about football. Rancho Alamitos Coach Mark Miller said few on 
the team play as hard in games or practice. 
</P>
<P>
"He gets upset with the other kids if they don't show the same determination," 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Moore, the all-league tight end who blocks next to Sims, said Sims quietly 
seethes when he thinks teammates aren't trying hard enough. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like the leader of the linemen," Moore said. "If we need a lift in the 
game, he'll come over to all of the linemen and hit them in the head." 
</P>
<P>
As important as he is to the offensive line, Sims might be a better defensive 
player. Because of his size -- 6 feet 2, 220 pounds -- he will likely play 
defense in college. And it's on defense that he can let his instincts take 
over, initiating on every play the contact he craves. 
</P>
<P>
Sims' aggressive nature contributed to his off-the-field problems when he was 
younger. Rancho Alamitos quarterback Chris Singletary remembers trying to keep 
Sims from fighting during their freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
Sims was then ineligible for football because he didn't have a 2.0 grade-point 
average in his last semester of junior high school. Singletary and Sims lifted 
weights, hung out together and talked of playing on the same football team. 
</P>
<P>
Singletary said fights would often break out at basketball games they attended, 
but Sims stayed out of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Earlier this year, he said if it wasn't for me, he's probably be on the street 
dead somewhere," Singletary said. 
</P>
<P>
Sims said football kept him out of trouble. His father, Leonard Sims Sr., 
received a football scholarship to USC after starring at running back and 
linebacker at Santiago High in the mid-1960s; he was one of the Trojans' top 
prospects in 1966 before a serious knee injury ended his career. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Jr. dreams of doing more. He has passing grades but hasn't taken enough 
college preparatory classes to meet the NCAA Proposition 48 requirements and 
therefore will likely have to play for a community college to earn a 
scholarship at a four-year school. 
</P>
<P>
"I think football has kept him on the straight-and-narrow and out of trouble," 
said Sally Valencia, Sims' mother. "He just loves football so much that he 
won't do anything that would jeopardize it." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said Sims has matured quite a bit. 
</P>
<P>
"He's grown up a lot since he's been here," he said. "I'm afraid his past makes 
him sound like a bad kid. He's really a good kid. It's not that checkered a 
past." 
</P>
<P>
There never was any doubt Sims was an outstanding player. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore, he played on the junior varsity until one week when he and his 
teammates were moved to varsity because the opponent didn't have a JV team. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos was leading, 6-0, in the fourth quarter when the Vaquero punter 
fumbled a snap, and Bolsa Grande recovered. A starting defensive lineman had to 
come out because of an injury, and Miller put Sims in. 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Grande ran three plays in Sims' direction and didn't score, but the 
regular lineman recovered and reentered for fourth down. "Then they ran right 
over our senior for a touchdown after Leonard stuffed them three times," Miller 
said, grimacing at the memory of the 7-6 loss. "So that's when I thought the 
guy might be a pretty good player."

11 Innocent Plea in Alleged Fraud Scheme: Eleven people, including two Orange 
County residents, pleaded not guilty in Seattle federal court Friday in 
connection with an alleged $25-million fraud against the nation's banks and 
thrifts operated out of a San Clemente office building. The scheme's alleged 
mastermind -- Capistrano Beach resident Douglas P. Blankenship -- is in the 
process of being extradited to Seattle and is expected to be arraigned next 
week. The case is being prosecuted in Washington state because the scheme's 
largest victim -- Puget Sound National Bank -- is headquartered there.

Sanshin Electronics Corp., a Costa Mesa subsidiary of a Japanese electronics 
company, is hoping to expand its operations in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
It also plans to build an assembly and manufacturing plant in Southern 
California to make electronic components for wide screen televisions and other 
home appliances by 1993, said Asao Kanamori, Sanshin's executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Sanshin, which is 10% owned by NEC, expects to acquire between three to five 
distributors in the next three years, he said. The parent, Sanshin Electronics 
Co. Ltd. of Tokyo, expects to spend at least $8 million to make those 
acquisitions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kanamori said the company is looking for distributors in the South, Midwest and 
Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
Sanshin is hiring engineers and sales managers in preparation for its expansion 
in the U.S. market.

At Chelsea Passage, an eager saleswoman shows a somewhat wary customer how to 
set a table using the store's avant-garde housewares. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe in conformity," she says, encouraging the young woman to mix 
and match different colored place mats. 
</P>
<P>
"You're making an assumption. Not everyone is creative," the woman says with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"We think they are," insists the clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Chelsea Passage, the gift area in Barneys New York in South Coast 
Plaza, assumes that every customer has a creative bent. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to think everybody's an artist," says Phyllis Pressman, vice president 
and general merchandise manager of Chelsea Passage in Manhattan and wife of 
Fred Pressman, president of Barneys New York. She developed the concept for 
Chelsea Passage 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd go out looking for a special gift for someone and find there was nothing 
out there but a sea of wooden salad bowls," Pressman says. 
</P>
<P>
At the new store, there's nary a wooden salad bowl in sight. Chelsea Passage 
carries unusual merchandise -- hip housewares that could just as well belong in 
an art gallery as a kitchen or dining room. 
</P>
<P>
Pressman finds tableware, glassware, linens, stationery and baby gift items 
made mostly by European artisans to put in her stores. 
</P>
<P>
She purposefully avoids "dull, ho-ho-hum table settings," she says. 
</P>
<P>
There are fun bowls and pitchers painted with polka dots and colorful shoes by 
Jane Willingale, black-and-white checkered glass bowls by Penelope Wurr, floral 
teapots with ceramic roses adorning their handles by Mary Rose Young, tall, 
wavy candleholders made of colorful resin by a group of French artists called 
En Attendant les Barbares, and linen place mats and napkins with hand-painted 
borders that resemble Monet's waterlilies by Carole Becker. 
</P>
<P>
Pressman searches all over Europe to find one-of-a-kind, hand-crafted items 
that one can playfully mix and match. 
</P>
<P>
"We think of them as future collectibles," she says. If any goods achieve wide 
distribution, she drops them from the inventory. 
</P>
<P>
By keeping on the cutting edge of table settings, Chelsea Passage attracts 
those tired of the same china, crystal and silverware offered in department 
stores. Here inventive customers can pick and choose from different patterns 
and never get bored. 
</P>
<P>
"We give you the paints and canvas and you paint the picture. You could set a 
table a hundred different ways instead of just one," Pressman says. 
</P>
<P>
A store rule is that there are no rules. Place settings don't have to match, 
the linens and china need not be uniform, and objects can have multiple uses. 
Thus, a small heart-shaped dish can serve as an ashtray, a coaster, an hors 
d'oeuvres plate, a butter dish -- anything one can imagine. 
</P>
<P>
"We try not to push sameness. We encourage people to mix and match, to 
experiment with different colors and textures," says Cecil Widdifield, manager 
of Chelsea Passage in Costa Mesa. "It's eclectic, functional and fun." 
</P>
<P>
He leads one to a set of tumblers for the bar that come in a rainbow of colors. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people would buy six blue glasses. I try to get them to buy them in six 
different colors," Widdifield says. "The same goes for place mats. It makes it 
more fun." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the store, he sets two tables to illustrate the merchandise's many uses. 
At one table, glass service plates with platinum borders are mixed with black 
china plates with a 16-sided sunburst shape and glass bowls adorned with black 
hieroglyphics. A set of geometric-shaped utensils sits by each plate. 
</P>
<P>
"This is fun -- really fun," says a dark-haired woman, admiring the setup. 
</P>
<P>
At another table, yellow heart-shaped hors d'oeuvre plates rest atop green 
entree plates with scalloped edges and colorful Laure Jape "Pimente" service 
plates festooned with red chili peppers. 
</P>
<P>
One need not reinvent the napkin to liven up the dinner table. 
</P>
<P>
"You can add one touch of whimsy, one funny little thing," and have a creative 
table setting, Widdifield says. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the pricey clothes at Barneys, many housewares at Chelsea Passage are 
inexpensive, starting with the glass stir sticks with colored spirals that make 
them look like sticks of candy for $5 apiece, or the hand-painted linen 
napkins, some suitable for framing or turning into pillow covers, for $35. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Chelsea Passage is not exactly Pier 1 Imports. A single hand-carved 
candleholder of resin costs $275, and assorted crystal vases and candleholders 
also sell for several hundred dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa store is one of three 2,000-square-foot Chelsea Passage stores 
opening this fall, and it is the first such shop in California. Other Chelsea 
Passage stores are found in Barneys New York in Manhasset, N.Y., Dallas and the 
flagship store in Manhattan.

GTE HAS A BRIGHT IDEA FOR FLOOR TILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who goes to school at USC gets buried hip deep in Trojan football lore 
almost from the moment the letter of acceptance arrives. By the first class 
meeting, freshmen Troj will have been whipped into a frenzy of collegiate zeal 
by tales of O.J. Simpson, Lynn Swann, Pat Haden, Mike Garrett, Anthony Davis 
and the cosmic 55-24 comeback against Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
And it's a cinch that they'll also have marveled at the legend of Mike Battle, 
Tim Rossovich and the light bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
Battle and Rossovich were athletes of the kamikaze variety. They played for USC 
in the 1960s and palled around together in much the same way bighorn sheep do. 
According to the legend, they constantly challenged each other to strange, 
ill-advised and often painful feats of physical daring. 
</P>
<P>
Supposedly, one of these involved eating light bulbs. They would sit across a 
table from one another, snatch up a couple of Sylvanias and chow down. It was 
generally acknowledged that they didn't eat the entire bulb, but left the metal 
screw part and most of the filament on the plate. 
</P>
<P>
It made for a fantastic yarn. Nevertheless, with a story like that circulating 
through the league, opposing players tended to look at the pair with awe, 
suspicion and fear. 
</P>
<P>
All this isn't meant to scare the people at GTE, but if either Battle or 
Rossovich shows up one day at GTE's tile plant in Wellsboro, Pa., looking 
hungry, they might want to consider shutting the place down and taking the rest 
of the week off. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, tile. GTE does indeed make telephones and lots of the things that go with 
them, but they also make light bulbs. Side by side in Wellsboro are the GTE 
Glass Products plant and the relatively new GTE Engineered Ceramics plant. 
Between the two runs a conveyor belt that carries tons and tons of stuff that 
Battle and Rossovich may at one time have considered to be an excellent source 
of dietary fiber. 
</P>
<P>
In short, GTE is making ceramic household tile from surplus light bulb glass. 
</P>
<P>
This new sideline for the phone folks got started when the light bulb people 
started looking for a way to use glass left over from the bulb-making process. 
Only 30% of the highly refined glass manufactured at the plant is actually made 
into bulbs, said GTE marketing manager Frank Pellegrino. Of the remaining 70%, 
most is remelted and used again. But about a fourth of that remainder was 
carted away as waste. 
</P>
<P>
The engineers started casting around for a way to use the waste glass. And now, 
after about four years of research and development, they've come up with a 
brand of tile they call Prominence. It's composed of 61% light bulb glass; the 
remaining 39% is made up of three types of clay. 
</P>
<P>
At first, this sounded a bit like building a bicycle out of cement. It might 
work, but. . . . 
</P>
<P>
After all, you walk on tile. You set heavy pots down on it. If you get excited, 
you jump up and down on it. Tile made from glass sounded -- to me, anyway -- 
brittle and slippery, something you could only walk on in Air Jordans and had 
to clean with a Zamboni ice machine. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, said Pellegrino. On the Mohs' scale of hardness, the new tile is 
comparable to conventional clay tile, he said. And, he added, it has a 
coefficient of friction (Mr. Science talk for how slippery it is) of .70. Tile 
is considered slip-resistant, he said, at .50. 
</P>
<P>
The real advantage, however, is the purity of the material, Pellegrino said. 
With conventional clay tile, "you're dealing with an impure material. If you 
order, for instance, an azure blue, you can receive six or seven different 
shades sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
The new tile, however, has "sizing and shade variations that are much smaller 
in any degree than are available in the industry today," Pellegrino said. 
</P>
<P>
This means that every tile in the box is exactly the same size and color. The 
stuff is also highly resistant to scratching and staining. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Prominence tile is available in 11 monochrome colors, with the sorts 
of glorious names that are usual for decorative materials. Among them: sterling 
(light gray), lilac, rose, peach, pistachio and jasper (a robin's egg blue). 
GTE also has just come out with what Pellegrino called three new "bold" 
monochromes: teal, cobalt and burgundy. And next year, he said, the company is 
scheduled to introduce six polychrome varieties (a blend of colors) and nine 
new colors, for a total of nearly 30 varieties of tile. 
</P>
<P>
Latco Products (the Los Angeles Tile Company) has exclusive distribution rights 
for the tile in California and Nevada. Latco's Orange County showroom is in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
This may or may not be good news for Battle and Rossovich, depending on whether 
the bizarre stories about them during their USC days are true. 
</P>
<P>
I've lost track of them, but I believe that unless they've become bloodthirsty 
mercenaries in some fetid jungle somewhere, they're probably fine gentlemen of 
reasonably mature years with families and mortgages, who go to PTA meetings and 
fret about the kids' braces and wouldn't dream of ripping a hole in Latco's 
showroom wall on the night of the full moon and making a meal of a few crates 
of pistachio floor tile. 
</P>
<P>
Nah. Once you get used to it, there's nothing like plain vanilla light bulbs 
with just a dash of filament.

ASK THE HANDYMAN: GEL GLOSS MAY CLEAN STAINS ON FIBERGLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: Is there any way to clean a stain in a fiberglass bathroom basin? 
</P>
<P>
M.D., 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos 
</P>
<P>
A: "You can try a product called Gel Gloss that is designed for cleaning marble 
and fiberglass, although it really depends on the stain," says John Johnstone 
of Niagara Plumbing in Garden Grove. "If that doesn't do it, you might try a 
little acetone, but first try it out in an inconspicuous area because it may 
bleach the fiberglass. 
</P>
<P>
"To prevent stains, you can use Gel Glass because it also acts as a sealant. 
And on faucets and fixtures, get some automobile carnuba paste wax and rub it 
in. The water will just bead and roll off instead of collecting and leaving 
spots." 
</P>
<P>
Q: The aluminum sliding doors and windows in our 20-year-old home are drafty 
because some of the "fuzzy gasket" strips are worn out. Can they be repaired or 
replaced? 
</P>
<P>
P.A., 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
A: "What you have to do is remove the sliding panel and replace the strip," 
says Brian Greenlee of Openings in Anaheim. "The trick is often getting the 
panel out of the track. Prise it up and pull it out. You can find the strips at 
hardware or window supply stores, and in a pinch, they can be glued on. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, that doesn't always solve the problem of a draft. Sometimes, if 
the door or window is warped, cold air gets in where the glass meets the frame. 
Replacing the striping may help, but if there's still a problem with drafts, 
the window may need to be replaced or fixed." 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have a large mirror attached to the wall by an adhesive around the area 
above our fireplace. The morning after we had built a fire, we found a large 
crack in the mirror. Before installing a new one, I want to know if the heat 
from the fireplace could have caused the crack. 
</P>
<P>
S.T., 
</P>
<P>
La Palma 
</P>
<P>
A: "I've worked with mirrors a long time and I've never known one above a 
fireplace to crack because of the heat," says Don Lane of Grove Glass in Garden 
Grove. "Usually cracks occur because of the way they're installed. They may be 
too tight against the wall as the house settles, or the wall may not be true. 
There are a number of things that can cause it, but the fireplace is pretty 
well insulated and it shouldn't be putting out enough heat to crack the 
mirror." 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm interested in added security for my sliding glass doors. My neighbor 
once installed pieces of metal that run the length of the doors that she called 
"Charlie bars." Are these still being made? 
</P>
<P>
C.H., 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
A: "I haven't seen those around in a while," says Mike Campos of Anaheim Glass. 
"They worked on the same principle as putting a broomstick at the bottom of the 
track. If you're interested in more security, there are locks available that 
attach to the sliding door and push a pin into the frame to keep the door from 
sliding or from being pulled off its track. 
</P>
<P>
"Or, instead of buying a lock, you can just drill a hole in the frame and the 
door and insert a screw. You'll be getting the same security at a cheaper 
price." 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have an outside wooden deck that's been painted with Old Quaker 6005DB 
Acrystain. I'd like to know if there's some type of varnish or shellac I can 
apply to make it really "hoseworthy." I'm thinking of a boat deck finish. 
</P>
<P>
N.Z., 
</P>
<P>
El Toro 
</P>
<P>
A: "Your best bet is using Marine Spar-Tek Varnish," says Jim Hawkins of 
Hawkins Paint in Anaheim. "It's made specifically for boats, but in this type 
of application it's also very durable and it has ultraviolet screening agents 
that protect the wood. You might want to thin the first coat down with paint 
thinner or mineral spirits before applying, and that will help it work as a 
sealer. After it dries fully, follow with a coat of solid varnish."

TIPS FOR BEATING STUBBORN BATHROOM, KITCHEN STAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stubborn stains can be beaten without a constant scrub-brush struggle. Kitchen 
and Bath Ideas magazine suggests putting these tips to work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ceramic Tile 
</P>
<P>
To remove stains, coat the tiles with a thick paste of scouring powder and 
water. Let the paste stand for five to 10 minutes, scrub with a stiff-bristle 
brush or nylon scrubbing pad, rinse well and wipe dry. To facilitate the 
process, use scouring powder with a bleaching agent and hot water. 
</P>
<P>
If stains remain, apply undiluted bleach. Let stand for at least five minutes, 
rinse well and dry. Once the tiles are clean and dry, protect the grout with an 
acrylic sealer or lemon-oil furniture polish. 
</P>
<P>
To clean hard-water residues, use a commercial tile cleaner or a homemade 
solution of water and vinegar in equal parts. Test any cleaning solution in an 
unobtrusive place first. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plastic Curtains 
</P>
<P>
Don't throw away soiled plastic shower or window curtains. Toss them in the 
washing machine instead. Use regular agitation and spin cycles, warm water (100 
degrees), your regular laundry detergent and chlorine bleach. 
</P>
<P>
To keep the plastic pliant, use warm water in the rinse cycle. The curtains can 
be tumble-dried on the no-heat cycle. To reduce abrasion, add dry towels to the 
load and allow to tumble for five to 10 minutes before hanging. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fiberglass Tub-Shower 
</P>
<P>
Use a non-abrasive or mildly abrasive scouring powder or a diluted liquid 
all-purpose cleaner. Check the label to determine if the product is safe for 
fiberglass or plastic laminates. 
</P>
<P>
For soap residues, apply a full-strength liquid cleaner or scouring powder with 
a sponge, and allow the product to stand for a minute before gently rubbing. 
Dry after rinsing. 
</P>
<P>
Vinegar or a lime-removing product will help dissolve hard-water deposits. 
</P>
<P>
The simplest way to avoid heavy-duty cleaning is to wipe the surfaces with a 
towel after each use. This prevents soap and hard-water deposits.

HOW TO CARE FOR YOUR LIVING CHRISTMAS TREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Janice L. Jones 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jan Groot, owner of El Modeno Gardens in Irvine, one of the largest suppliers 
of living Christmas trees in California, suggests giving your tree a thorough 
watering before bringing it indoors. "After you bring it inside, put it in a 
saucer. From then on, you can keep the soil moist with ice cubes," he said. 
"They'll melt slow and water won't gush out onto the carpet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INDOOR UPKEEP 
</P>
<P>
Place the tree as near a window as possible, never in a dark corner. 
</P>
<P>
Keep the temperature as cool as possible. Don't put the tree near a fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
Don't flock or spray anything on a living Christmas tree since this can kill 
it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PLANTING INSTRUCTIONS 
</P>
<P>
Water the tree thoroughly and remove it from the pot. If it doesn't slide out 
easily, tilt the tree onto its side, and tap the bottom of the pot to dislodge 
it. Straight-sided pots may have to be cut off. 
</P>
<P>
Potted trees may have become bound, with roots circling around the root ball in 
the sides and bottom of the pot. These roots must be straightened out before 
planting. Pull them loose by hand, or make several inch-deep cuts around the 
root ball with a trowel or hatchet. 
</P>
<P>
Dig a hole slightly larger and deeper than the plant's root ball. Backfill the 
hole with enough soil to allow the root ball to sit two inches higher than the 
surrounding soil. Fill up the hole, but don't place any soil on top of the root 
ball. Construct a basin around the tree with the rim right at the edge of the 
root ball. Fill the basin several times with water, allowing it to soak in 
between waterings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WATERING 
</P>
<P>
Correct watering is the key to a healthy tree. Frequency depends on soil type 
and weather. Dig down about a foot to determine how wet the soil is near the 
tree's roots. Most problems are a result of over-watering, since pines, once 
established, are quite drought-hardy. For the first six weeks, water once or 
twice a week. Gradually lengthen the interval during the tree's first year 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PRUNING 
</P>
<P>
To keep the tree compact and bushy; cut back the main top leader if it grows 
over 12 to 15 inches without producing a new whorl of branches. Side branches 
may also be cut back 3 to 4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CONTAINER GROWING 
</P>
<P>
Most trees can be grown for a couple of years in a large container, but Italian 
stone pines are most suitable, because of their slow growth rate. A lightweight 
mix of 50% redwood compost mixed with native soil will provide good drainage. 
Don't use large amounts of peat moss or organic soil amendments. 
</P>
<P>
Over-watering is the most frequent cause of unhealthy container-grown plants. 
If the soil is dry 2 to 3 inches from the top, the area around the roots is 
probably dry enough to receive more water. Water according to need, not by a 
set schedule. Slow-release fertilizer every two to three months will help. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE TO DONATE YOUR LIVING CHRISTMAS TREE 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Department of Harbors, Beaches and Parks accepts donated 
trees. Tim Miller, who manages the county's 17 regional parks, suggests 
purchasing an Aleppo pine, an Italian stone pine, a Canary Island pine, a 
Monterey pine or a coastal redwood if you plan to donate your tree after 
Christmas. "There's a grove of Monterey pines in Carbon Canyon that are 
leftovers from a living Christmas tree farm located there in the '70s. Now 
they're 60 to 70 feet tall," he said. Information: (714) 567-6204. 
</P>
<P>
Various cities in Orange County accept a limited number of trees for planting 
in city-owned parks. Contact the city's parks and recreation department, before 
you purchase your tree, for information on which trees are needed. Janice L.

<P>
THAT'S A HOUSE OF A DIFFERENT COLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The color of a home makes a first and lasting impression. For people who have 
been playing it safe the last few years by painting the exterior of the house 
white or beige, now may be the time to consider splashing on a little color. 
</P>
<P>
Color works its magic by altering proportions, calling attention to details, 
helping a house to blend with surroundings and masking flaws. Best of all, it 
can give the house a fresh new look without seriously denting the family 
budget. An average-size house costs about $2,000 to paint. 
</P>
<P>
Color considerations: Homeowners should start by thinking about what kinds of 
colors make them feel the most comfortable. Cool sea colors, warm earth tones 
and restrained neutrals are very different options. Each choice would result in 
a different image -- from a conservative facade to a bold expression. Family 
taste should be considered before making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Then, consider how color can help achieve particular results: 
</P>
<P>
* Perk up a boxy house with colorful trim around windows and doors, along the 
eaves and on the porch. 
</P>
<P>
* Unify the look of a home with subtle paint colors in the same color family. 
</P>
<P>
* Emphasize architectural detailing with a contrasting color. 
</P>
<P>
* Tie together a sprawling house by using a strong trim color all round. 
</P>
<P>
* Turn a boxy house into an eye-catcher with distinct colors that accent peaks 
and details. 
</P>
<P>
* Paint bold and bright colors on a large house, and highlight its 
architectural features with white or a neutral. 
</P>
<P>
* Use a color surprise to wake up a traditional paint treatment, such as a 
bright red door on a white house. 
</P>
<P>
* Recapture the past with historic colors popular when the house was built. 
</P>
<P>
* Camouflage out-of-proportion or unsightly details by painting them the same 
color as the house. 
</P>
<P>
* Tie the home's elements together by taking into account roof and brick colors 
that can't be changed.

BLUE CORN: A FOOD FAD LASTING FOR CENTURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL ARONSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christopher Columbus took maize -- corn -- back to Spain from America in 1493 
and American Indians showed early settlers how to grow it. 
</P>
<P>
Corn was important to early Central and South American civilizations for many 
years before Europeans arrived, according to Professor Ray Rothenberger, 
horticulturist at the University of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
"The oldest known corn remains were discovered in Mexico and were about 7,000 
years old," he related. "The corn cob was enclosed in a husklike casing, which 
meant man had a hand in its growth and survival." 
</P>
<P>
There are hundreds of corn varieties in four major categories: sweet corn, 
popcorn, dent or field corn, and the decorative multicolored flint or Indian 
corn. 
</P>
<P>
"There are corns not in these four categories," says Rothenberger. "These 
include dwarf corn with tiny ears, and broom corn with long, feathery sprays of 
seed heads. Seeds from broom corn can be used for bird food, and the wiry heads 
can be made into brooms or fall decorations." 
</P>
<P>
He relates that Indian corn has the hardest kernels of any corn. "They become 
almost impossible to grind by hand when they dry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Indian corn colors range from mahogany to red, yellow-orange and deep blue. 
Combinations of colors often occur on one ear and these are popular as 
decorations. Lately, miniature corn suitable for small arrangements has been 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blue Corn 
</P>
<P>
Blue corn occurs naturally. In 1540, the Spanish explorer Coronado found Pueblo 
Indians planting it. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional blue corn tortilla is the mainstay of the blue corn market. 
Processors have introduced such new products as blue corn chips, muffins, 
pancake mixes and corn flakes. One expert notes that blue corn grain has a 
coarser, sweeter and nuttier taste than other types of corn. 
</P>
<P>
Arrowhead Mills, in Hereford, Tex., has been processing blue corn for five 
years. Its president, Boyd Foster, said: "At first, we thought blue corn would 
be a fad, but it has done quite well and we think it is here to stay. Blue corn 
makes up 8% to 10% of our sales revenue each year." 
</P>
<P>
Foster, whose firm processes about 1 million pounds of blue corn annually, said 
its biggest-selling product is pancake mix. "Blue corn products sell well 
because of the unique color and distinctive flavor. We sell products all over 
the U.S., but the Los Angeles area is our biggest market." 
</P>
<P>
Farmers like to grow blue corn, Foster related, because it is non-hybrid, which 
means that they can carry over seed from one year to the next without having to 
buy more. 
</P>
<P>
Blue corn is often grown organically. It is best adapted to deep, well-drained, 
sandy loam soils with plenty of organic matter. Plant it as you do other corn.

THE GARDEN / FARM SUPPLY MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Garden and farm supply stores did $25 million in business during 1990's first 
quarter, making Orange County the second largest county market in the state for 
such transactions. Los Angeles County, the largest market, recorded about twice 
as much in sales, a 2% increase from the same period in 1989. Orange County's 
total increased 6%. 
</P>
<P>
Although Orange County and it's four neighbors are heavily urbanized, they 
represent five of the top 10 garden/farm supply markets in the state. And 
one-third (35%) of 1990's first quarter business statewide was transacted in 
the five-county area. Here's how Orange and the other counties compare:

SALES AND OUTLETS 
</P>
<P>
Farm and garden supplies are a $100 million business in Orange County and 
growing rapidly. In fact, in the five years between 1985 and 1989, the most 
recent year for which information is available, sales at these stores increased 
51% -- and 26% of that was during the last two years. At the same time, there 
has been a 12% increase in the numbers of stores, bringing the 1989 total to 
176. Here's how both sales and number of outlets grew during the 1985-89 
five-year period:

AVERAGE SALES 
</P>
<P>
Average sales at the county's garden/farm supply stores has been growing as 
well, topping $616,000 per store in 1989, the most recent year for which 
information is available. In 1989, however, the average sales rate of increase 
dropped to 4.9% above the 1988 figure -- down from 11.8% between 1987 and 1988. 
During the two years before, increases of around 7% were recorded. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the increased sales and average sales, the place of garden supply 
stores in the greater county economy hasn't changed dramatically though it has 
grown. In 1985, sales equaled 0.55% of the county's entire retail trade. That 
figure grew steadily, reaching 0.63% in 1988 and then leveling off at 0.62% 
last year.

<P>
Here's the five year trend in average sales at each of the county's stores:
