JAMES FLANIGAN: U.S. AUTO MAKERS APPROACH A CROSSROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The truth about the present, confusing time for the U.S. and world economies is 
that we're at a great divide between past and future, a period of enormous 
promise but also challenge. 
</P>
<P>
And just as it was 75 years ago, the car industry once again is at the center 
of great trends. Despite talk of plant closings and a car surplus in the world, 
the automobile is still a growth industry, with technological impact still to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
The potential market is huge. About 80% of the cars produced each year are sold 
in countries with 20% of the world's population -- which means that roughly 80% 
of the world's people are potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
And in this decade, impressive numbers of those automotive "wannabes" are going 
to get their wish. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico could go very quickly from 600,000 cars a year to 1 million, and on from 
there to become a globally significant producer and consumer of automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
What used to be East Germany may triple car sales to 750,000 a year in this 
decade, says Hans-Jorg Hungerland, president of Volkswagen of America. And 
beyond Germany, says Hungerland, "if Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union came 
up to only half the 500-cars-per-1,000-people ratio of the United States or 
West Germany, it would add 23 million cars to current world production of 36 
million, plus 14 million trucks." 
</P>
<P>
The promise is great. 
</P>
<P>
So are the challenges. At the very least, a massive increase in automobile use 
in an environment-conscious world will demand a change in fuels to reduce 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
More than that, most of the world's automobile companies face a critical 
struggle to adapt because an improved way of manufacturing cars is changing the 
rules, as much as Henry Ford changed them with the assembly line 77 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The new system is called "lean" production by the authors of "The Machine That 
Changed the World," a remarkable book that has come out of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology's five-year, $5-million study on the future of the 
automobile. 
</P>
<P>
Authors James P. Womack, Daniel T. Jones and Daniel Roos relate how one man, 
Taiichi Ohno, production chief of Toyota, looked at the assembly line some 40 
years ago and saw a better way. 
</P>
<P>
To improve quality, Ohno allowed assembly workers to stop the line to correct 
defects immediately, rather than reworking errors in the completed vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
He organized workers in teams, gave them responsibility for quality checks and 
production improvements -- and then cut out ranks of supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Ohno eliminated inventories of back-up parts and devised ways to change models 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Some of what the book relates is familiar to Americans, who have been hearing 
sermons on Japanese competitiveness for more than a decade now. 
</P>
<P>
But there is nothing necessarily Japanese about lean production -- one of the 
most successful plants practicing it is in Hermosillo, Mexico, and is owned by 
Ford. The lean production idea is powerful, the nation that adopts it becomes 
so. 
</P>
<P>
Ohno's production system has cut car assembly time in half -- to 16 hours from 
31 -- and lifted Toyota to third place among the world's car manufacturers, 
after Ford and General Motors. And adaptations of lean production have helped 
Japanese industry rise to prominence -- just as Ford's mass production ideas 
powered the United States to industrial leadership before 1920. 
</P>
<P>
In Ford's case, his use of interchangeable parts and auto assembly broken down 
to single repetitive tasks reduced costs 88% from traditional craft assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The implications go beyond industry. "How we make things dictates not only how 
we work, but what we buy, how we think and how we live," write the authors of 
"Machine." Mass production made cars affordable for the masses. Ford raised 
wages to $5 a day in 1914 and said he was creating customers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, lean production makes cars even more affordable and has ensured 
employment for Japanese workers, whose pay is now higher than that of U.S. auto 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
But adaptation to a new system is neither easy nor assured. Managers and 
workers in Britain resisted mass production, and British industry lost out. 
With the coming of lean production the message again is adapt or die. 
</P>
<P>
Conventional wisdom sees a global surplus of 8 million cars today, but the 
authors of "Machine" disagree. There is "a vast glut of uncompetitive mass 
production capacity," they write, "and that is threatened by a shortage of 
competitive lean production capacity." 
</P>
<P>
That's why Toyota can confidently announce an expansion to double production at 
its Georgetown, Ky., plant, as it did last week, while General Motors talks of 
even more cutbacks. Still, GM's Saturn project is a start at shifting 
completely to lean production, and the giant company "under its new chairman, 
Robert Stempel, is making a serious effort to reform," says analyst Joseph 
Phillippi of the Lehman Bros. investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
To date, Ford has adapted to lean production faster than GM or Chrysler, and 
all have been quicker to do so than their counterparts in Europe, where it 
still takes 36 labor hours to assemble a car, compared to 25 in the United 
States and 16 in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
What's the problem? One is that lean production eliminates the boss's job. 
Today at Toyota "there are seven layers of management between the worker on the 
line and Chairman Eiji Toyoda's office," says an auto expert. "At GM there are 
still 17 layers." 
</P>
<P>
Also, some resist lean production because it wasn't invented here. But neither 
was the radio. Accepting a better idea and adapting to a changing world is not 
a sign of weakness, but failing to do so spells decline. At a great divide, we 
can stay behind or cross over confidently.

CREATING FUN GAMES CAN BE SERIOUS WORK; 
</P>
<P>
RETAIL: THOSE IN THE COMPETITIVE CONTEST OF SELLING ADULT PLAY THINGS ARE 
RELYING ON BUDGET-CONSCIOUS CONSUMERS TO MAKE THEIR PRODUCTS SUCCESSFUL. 
</P>

<P>
Creating a game that is fun to play is serious business for Brian Hersch. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an underlying presumption that since game playing is frivolous, then 
game making is frivolous," said Hersch, the creator of such adult board games 
as "Outburst" and "Taboo." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's frivolous at all. I damn well better (take it seriously) or 
I won't be successful. It's my business." 
</P>
<P>
This no-nonsense approach has made Hersch one of the rare winners in the 
competitive contest to create a hot-selling adult board game. Six years after 
Trivial Pursuit mania swept the nation and unleashed a flood of adult board 
games, the category is now stagnant, leaving board game makers hard at work to 
come up with the next hit that will end up on thousands of holiday gift lists 
year after year. Many industry players also see the current economic slump as a 
way of boosting sales. 
</P>
<P>
"There hasn't been anything hot and sexy for adults since Pictionary," said 
Larry Carlat, editor of Toy &amp; Hobby World, a New York-based trade magazine, 
referring to the 5 1/2-year-old game based on charades. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure the category is going great guns," said Carlat. "The stuff with 
board games is that there is only one really hot and sexy one that drives the 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Most entries in the adult board game category have not even come close to 
reaching the 100,000 sales mark, which qualifies them as successes and help 
ensure a spot on crowded store shelves. Even those who have created a hit game 
have trouble matching their success with a new and different item. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing," said game maker Robert Angel, who has not 
come up with a successful new game since creating Pictionary, which has sold 20 
million sets in various versions -- including Bible Pictionary. "We know we 
have gotten lucky." 
</P>
<P>
The adult board game category had long been a backwater of the toy industry, 
and was dominated by strategy games such as Othello and Risk. But 
question-and-answer games such as Trivial Pursuit -- which has sold more than 
40 million sets in its different versions -- were less intimidating and 
appealed to a broader group, with a minimum amount of strategy and a heavy 
reliance on common knowledge and popular culture. Shipments of adult board 
games totaled $158 million in 1989, according to the Toy Manufacturers of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
With strategic games, "you are into the game itself, into winning," said Chris 
Hixson, a veteran game player who was browsing through the Glendale outlet of 
the Game Keeper, which stocks more than 30 adult board games. "But with Trivial 
Pursuit and Pictionary, you are into having fun with people and enjoying 
yourself." 
</P>
<P>
"The game becomes the vehicle for (social) interaction -- it's no longer the 
focal point," said Phil Orbanes, a toy and game industry consultant and former 
chief of research and development at Parker Bros. "These new games do not put 
too much of an emphasis on the feat of winning. It's more on the experience" of 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
Trivial Pursuit "was a very important step forward for the board game," said 
David Leibowitz, a toy industry analyst at American Securities in New York. 
But, "if we eliminate Trivial Pursuit from the discussion, you will discover 
that there has not been an overwhelming increase" in adult board game sales. 
</P>
<P>
The games also exploit the common experiences and knowledge of the nation's 
baby boom generation, which grew up with a plethora of toys. "They were the 
most coddled generation in history when it came to. . .play things," said 
Orbanes. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Hersch, the Century City-based real estate developer turned board game 
maker, says that television game shows have also played a role in addicting 
baby boomers such as himself to board games. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing games was just part of life," said Hersch, who grew up playing Risk 
and Clue and watching "To Tell The Truth" on television. 
</P>
<P>
Hersch's biggest hit -- Outburst, a free-association word game that has sold 3 
million copies -- weaves in all the traits that have made for successful board 
games. In Outburst, competing players, for example, are given a minute to come 
up with as many responses to such statements as "Commands You Give a Dog" 
listed on playing cards. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes in everybody's common knowledge," said Hersch. "This is not an 
intellectual experience, playing a game. We know this isn't brain surgery." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, games linked to technical or obscure subjects -- such as high finance 
in Trump the Game -- turn most players off. These games "were too heavily 
involved with what appeared to be high-level finance," said Orbanes. "That's 
too intimidating to most people." 
</P>
<P>
Rules are a crucial concern to board game designers since adult players of 
today have little patience. "I have to have you understand the game in three 
minutes," said Hersch. "I can kill the game if the rules are too complicated. 
It's critically important to keep a steady pace, an enlivened pace. If you have 
to keep going back to the rules, people say 'who needs this?' " 
</P>
<P>
Game boards and score-keeping devices, which are not essential to playing many 
of the games, help define the limits of the game and lend it a competitive 
zeal. "You don't have to have a board to play," said Hersch. "But a lot of 
people won't play unless its competitive." 
</P>
<P>
With skimpy advertising budgets, board game makers rely heavily on word of 
mouth to boost sales. "If you get the game to play well, then they you have the 
start of word-of-mouth," said Bob Reiss, a New Jersey-based businessman who 
created a trivia game based on TV Guide magazine and is now working on a 
project with a love-and-marriage theme. "If it doesn't play well, they don't 
come back. You get one chance." 
</P>
<P>
Despite a weakening economy, adult board games might appeal to a growing number 
of budget-conscious consumers, despite price tags of $30 and up. "Some people 
will have to give up their vacation or going to the theater," said Reiss. 
"People who are watching their money will want to play games" instead. 
</P>
<P>
Many game players would agree. Davern Kroncke, a Pictionary and Trivial Pursuit 
fan from Santa Rosa, Calif., says she invites friends to dinner at her house 
and then plays games after her children go to bed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a time for us to get together, to laugh, unwind and have a lot of fun," 
said Kroncke, a 39-year-old dental hygienist. And "it's economical," she said.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: EUROPEAN ECONOMIES HAVE SEVERED TIES TO AMERICA'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. GORDON, DAVID M. GORDON is professor of economics at the New School 
for Social Research in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am spending this academic year in Europe and shall be devoting my next 
several columns to reports and impressions of economic developments among 
European countries. 
</P>
<P>
My initial and most striking impression, after only a month here, is that 
European economies are rapidly losing interest in economic developments in the 
United States. It used to be that when America sneezed, Europe felt itself 
catching pneumonia. Now, with the U.S. economy suffering from bronchitis or 
something even worse, Europe seems to be telling us to take two aspirin and 
drink plenty of liquids. 
</P>
<P>
These impressions have been sharpened for me by the stark difference between 
two conferences, four years apart, I've attended about the European economy. 
</P>
<P>
The first took place in Bonn in the spring of 1986. At that time, many 
Europeans spoke admiringly of the U.S. "jobs miracle" -- a sentiment richly 
represented at the Bonn conference. High unemployment rates were plaguing many 
key European economies while employment had been growing with what seemed like 
stunning success in the United States. Many at that conference were wondering 
whether the U.S. model, variously described by such terms as "Reaganomics" or 
"flexible labor markets," could be usefully applied to help overcome what they 
often called "Euro-sclerosis." 
</P>
<P>
The second conference took place in Venice early last month. Its theme was "The 
Economics of a New Europe." Participants focused on problems and prospects in 
both Western and Eastern Europe (including the Soviet Union). Italian Foreign 
Minister Gianni de Michelis closed the discussion with an interesting review of 
the challenges facing the European political economy in transition. 
</P>
<P>
At this conference, in sharp contrast with 1986, virtually no one made even 
passing reference to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
It is true many assumed that some kind of "free market model" would be pursued, 
in various unpredictable ways, in many of the Eastern European economies over 
the next decade and that U.S. economists and financial consultants were playing 
an important role in helping shape that jolting institutional transformation. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, no one seemed to be impressed with either the 
prospects for or the actual institutional examples represented by the U.S. 
economy. Europe represented an increasingly potent economic force in its own 
right. Many seemed to feel European economies would and could forge their own 
distinctive ways of adjusting to and maneuvering within an increasingly 
integrated European Common Market, with complete integration anticipated in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
How would the U.S. economy fare during the 1990s? It seemed as if the 
conference participants couldn't care less. 
</P>
<P>
To what should we attribute what appears to be a dramatic inversion of European 
perspective on the U.S. economy within such a short space of time? 
</P>
<P>
There are two sides to the Atlantic and therefore, at least superficially, two 
sides to a provisional answer to that question. 
</P>
<P>
On the American continent, U.S. economic achievements in late fall, 1990, 
obviously look much less impressive than they did in spring, 1986. Not only has 
the U.S. economy stumbled into a recession of unknown proportions, but it has 
become increasingly clear to many here that economic growth during the long 
U.S. expansion from 1983 to 1990 was purchased at huge costs to future 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. corporations and consumers have run up massive amounts of debt that will 
weigh heavily on their prospects during the 1990s and beyond. And the United 
States has become the largest debtor country in the world -- hanging 
desperately, against all odds, on the willingness of the Japanese and Europeans 
to continue providing prodigious infusions of capital. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy is no longer either a hegemony or a bellwether. 
</P>
<P>
On the European side of the Atlantic, by contrast, three developments strike me 
at first blush as most important to helping explain the Europeans' turning 
their shoulder on the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
First, many Europeans are surprised and, ultimately, delighted at the rather 
sudden acceleration of movement toward European economic integration over the 
past four years. Their recent success at steering through the treacherous 
straits of economic nationalism seems to have produced a feeling both of 
continental pride and of lustful anticipation of the challenging economic 
opportunities that lie ahead. (At the same time, however, they do not 
unrealistically ignore the immense problems of fitting their national economies 
comfortably and effectively into a more integrated European framework.) 
</P>
<P>
Second, the stunning developments in Eastern Europe have obviously turned heads 
in that direction. Europeans seem to feel a deep commitment to helping Central 
and Eastern European countries through their current and impending problems. 
They also drool at the possibility of vast new economic opportunities in those 
economies during and after the transition. 
</P>
<P>
They also recognize that Eastern Europe (including what is now the eastern part 
of a unified Germany) will require huge capital investments -- which will 
(hardly incidentally) place rival claims on much of the money that has been 
recently feeding capital accounts in the United States. Inevitably, as well, 
the apparent end of the Cold War dramatically reduces Europeans' feeling of 
political and military dependence on the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The third provides perhaps the most important piece of the explanation. I get 
the impression that the combination of the first two developments has convinced 
many in Europe that they can and must build on their own institutional history 
and institutional imagination to chart their future economic course. Many no 
longer seem to feel the need to emulate models from outside Europe. They feel 
that they have their economic future in their own hands. And they seem to feel 
confident of their own capacity to take advantage of future economic 
opportunities without outside interference or help. 
</P>
<P>
In this regard, I was struck by a comment that Spanish President Felipe 
Gonzalez made in a recent interview in the prestigious French newspaper Le 
Monde. He was speaking of both the promise provided by an increasingly united 
Europe and of the likelihood that European countries could and would fashion an 
institutional design based on their own history and ingenuity. 
</P>
<P>
"Among existing institutions," he noted, "it's the European Economic Community 
that has achieved the greatest progress. It has been able to refine itself, to 
consolidate its unity even while enlarging itself. It exercises a powerful 
attraction to all of its neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
"When one speaks of the new European architecture," he continued, "I think of 
all these old (European) palaces from the 15th, 16th or 17th centuries. They 
have been enlarged and restored several times, often substantially. 
Nonetheless, the harmony of the whole has been preserved. And they remain 
habitable. Europe is likely to resemble them."

WASHINGTON;

<P>
EFFORT TO HALT PIRACY OF INDUSTRIAL DESIGNS REVS UP AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE COLLINS, CATHERINE COLLINS is a Washington writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The possibility of legislation prohibiting the pirating of industrial designs 
has sparked a hot debate between automobile manufacturers and the independent 
parts and service industry even before Congress kicks the new session into 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Industrial Design Anti-Piracy Act, which has been stalled for 
several years in Congress, would impose a 10-year design copyright on nearly 
every design that is original and distinctive. It is intended to bridge the gap 
between the artistic nature of current copyright law and the functional nature 
of patent protection. 
</P>
<P>
The bill's powerful co-sponsors, House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt 
(D-Mo.) and House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) have said they are 
not sure when they will reintroduce the measure. But both have expressed a 
continuing interest in it. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time that the United States act to stem the losses in export sales and 
jobs that result from inadequate intellectual property protection and product 
counterfeiting by our trading partners," Michel said. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers say they support the legislation because it would protect their 
long-term investment in the development and design of specific parts and 
protect consumers by guaranteeing high-quality and safe parts. Auto 
manufacturers say that they are interested only in exterior parts made from 
sheet metal, such as hoods, fenders and doors. 
</P>
<P>
"Current law does not adequately protect the auto makers' investment," said 
Kenneth W. Myers, parts and service marketing manager at Ford Motor Co. 
"Copyright law focuses on objects that are purely artistic, while the patent 
law system focuses on the mechanical aspects of an object. Neither adequately 
protects industrial designs." 
</P>
<P>
Pure bunk, say the "aftermarket" service and parts people. They contend that, 
because it is getting more difficult for manufacturers to make a profit from 
the sale of cars, they are trying to legislate a sure portion of the 
$135-billion parts and service aftermarket. 
</P>
<P>
This side of the debate is also concerned that the bill is vague enough to 
cover interior parts, too. 
</P>
<P>
"The Automotive Parts &amp; Accessories Assn. is extremely concerned that the 
broad scope of design protection legislation being considered will provide the 
new car manufacturers with a 10-year, government-protected monopoly over the 
production and distribution of a wide array of replacement and add-on parts for 
vehicles," said Julian C. Morris, the group's president. "The anti-piracy 
premise of this bill is little more than an attempt by the car companies to 
grab the market share they have lost through the years in a competitive 
market." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Project 2000, a long-range, strategic planning effort by the National 
Automobile Dealers Assn. has recommended to dealers nationwide that they pursue 
the service and parts aftermarkets because of declining profits from new-car 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
"Our problem is that we have the same size pie but more players," said Allan 
Wilbur, NADA's executive director of public affairs. "In the next few years, 
the areas for greater emphasis should be on service, parts and, when possible, 
the finance and insurance business." 
</P>
<P>
Added Wilbur: "Small-town dealers already know this. If they don't give good 
service, they don't survive. But 80% of the cars sold nationwide are sold by 
only 20% of the dealers." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the debate was initiated by the insurance industry when it began 
encouraging the use of less expensive parts rather than those made by the 
original manufacturers. The aftermarket proponents still wrap themselves in the 
consumer side of the issue, saying affordability, convenience and competition 
are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
But the manufacturers respond that safety, quality and fairness are on their 
side. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hard for American manufacturers to compete with the inexpensive, 
imitation parts made abroad," said Anne Carlson of the Motor Vehicle 
Manufacturers Assn. "Many of these companies are using ungalvanized steel that 
rusts prematurely and they are making copies of a copy, so that they don't fit 
properly. At the same time, they have lower labor costs and few of the 
environmental laws that we have to work with here." 
</P>
<P>
All parts, regardless of where they are manufactured, have to live up to the 
same standards, countered Linda Hoffman, vice president of government affairs 
for the parts and accessories organization. "They say they're talking about 
design, but invariably it has something to do with getting the advantage over 
their competition in the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FDIC Plan Would Have Banks Purchase Stock 
</P>
<P>
Late this month or early next, the Bush Administration will propose measures to 
strengthen the deposit insurance fund for the nation's banks and remove 
Depression-era restrictions on banking activities. In doing so, it will signal 
the official start of a lengthy and important debate in Congress over the 
future of banking. 
</P>
<P>
In a time-honored Washington tradition, the Administration has floated one of 
its ideas as a trial balloon, and reaction has been predictably divided. 
</P>
<P>
Leaked last week was word of a proposal to bolster the ailing Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. fund by requiring banks to buy preferred stock from the agency. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the FDIC quickly confirmed the report as accurate and pointed 
out that it was one of several ideas being discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Banks would have to buy the stock in proportion to their deposits, the same way 
they pay for FDIC insurance. Officials have discussed mandating stock purchases 
ranging from 50 cents per $100 of deposits to $1 per $100. The plan would raise 
$14 billion to $28 billion for the insurance fund. 
</P>
<P>
As a sweetener for the banks, they would receive market-rate interest on the 
stock and could count it as part of the capital they are required to have on 
hand to meet federal standards. But that hasn't removed all the bad taste. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., banking consultant, was quick to blast the 
concept as a thinly disguised tax that would damage healthy banks. 
</P>
<P>
"In effect, the safe drivers of the banking world are paying higher and higher 
deposit insurance premiums because the regulatory process has done a miserable 
job of catching banking's drunken drivers," said Ely. 
</P>
<P>
But the banking industry was not so fast to condemn the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that banks are necessarily going to oppose this," said Joe Belew, 
president of the Consumer Bankers Assn., which represents the nation's smaller 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
"They are terribly worried about any move toward a premium increase because 
profitability is hurting so much in the industry. They are equally concerned 
about that there not be a taxpayer bailout. This plan has some attractive 
aspects." 
</P>
<P>
But Belew and others see the proposal as only the first in a series of measures 
and issues that will dominate the banking agenda in Congress in the coming 
session.

USE PRIVATE INSURANCE TO PROTECT DEPOSITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SPRAYREGEN, RICHARD SPRAYREGEN is a partner at Kenneth Leventhal 
&amp; Co., a Los Angeles-based accounting firm.

<TEXT>
<P>
As a financial crisis spreads from U.S. savings and loans to commercial banks, 
extraordinary measures must be taken to stop the hemorrhage of funds from the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s insurance fund. Nevertheless, federal 
regulators continue to look at only one solution to shore up the fund: raise 
the premiums paid by institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, such a solution could make the problem worse. A 62% increase in 
bank premiums -- announced by the FDIC for next year -- could further 
jeopardize the survival of many institutions, adding fuel to a cycle of 
commercial bank failures. 
</P>
<P>
What is required is a fundamentally new approach that focuses attention on the 
asset side of a bank's balance sheet by using private insurance on individual 
loans in bank portfolios. Such a plan would shift the risk of insuring bank 
deposits -- at least in part -- from taxpayers to the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the government, insurance companies are structured to assess risk and 
provide insurance services at a profit. In the process, the costs of insuring 
individual loans ultimately would be passed on to borrowers, where the 
responsibility most properly belongs. 
</P>
<P>
Under current government policy, banks are required to insure deposits by 
paying premiums to the FDIC's insurance fund. Those premiums are calculated on 
a flat rate determined solely by the size of the institution. The fund has 
deteriorated rapidly, just at a time when its exposure to significant new 
losses is higher than ever. At the end of last year, the ratio of the insurance 
fund's reserves to deposits had fallen to the lowest point in its history -- 
0.7%. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect for the fund achieving the minimum reserve ratio of 1.25% by 1995 
under new federal rules "is not good," says Charles A. Bowsher, U.S. 
comptroller general. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators have considered instituting a risk-based premium rate for commercial 
banks, depending on the type of loans they make. Insurance premiums under this 
plan would be calculated by a variety of factors, including the type and risk 
of loans made by the institutions. Banks with portfolios in predominantly 
low-risk categories would pay lower premiums than institutions with higher-risk 
portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
A shift to a risk-based system makes sense. It is more consistent with the ways 
insurance premiums are typically priced in policies ranging from autos to 
health. But still, taxpayers ultimately would carry the burden of replenishing 
the fund to cover bank failures. 
</P>
<P>
Private insurance of individual loans represents an important departure from 
existing regulatory policy. Under this practice, bankers would solicit 
insurance policies similar to private mortgage insurance, or PMI, for 
individual loans. Insurance companies would evaluate the risk on a loan-by-loan 
basis and determine when they would provide coverage. Banks, in turn, would pay 
reduced premiums to the FDIC, depending on how much of their loan portfolios 
are reinsured by private carriers. 
</P>
<P>
This approach would "lay off" a portion of the risk on private insurance 
companies and yield a number of benefits. The first source of repayment of a 
loan would be the borrowers, while the second would be the insurance company. 
That would help defray the number of claims against the FDIC deposit fund. 
Private insurers, in turn, would transfer the cost of insurance to borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
Is this approach politically and economically viable? A number of objections 
could be raised. 
</P>
<P>
First, it could be argued that the plan would discriminate against some 
borrowers. Only borrowers with high qualifications capable of meeting insurance 
criteria would be able to obtain financing. This differs significantly from the 
current system, which is indiscriminate in relation to borrowers and operates 
on a "blind pool" insurance basis. 
</P>
<P>
Second, bankers may object that the plan could give insurance companies too 
much influence in bank loan underwriting criteria. This plan, however, would 
force banks to re-examine their loan underwriting policies to meet the 
requirements of insurance companies -- ultimately benefiting institutions and 
reducing their losses. Standard &amp; Poor's underwriting criteria, now used in 
commercial real estate lending, might be modified for use by banks. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies would need to establish some type of loss experience model 
in developing a premium schedule that was realistic and viable. This would 
involve research and maintenance of a loan-loss database and model. Both would 
be easy to develop. Federal and state agencies maintain comprehensive 
statistics on actual losses incurred by every financial institution in the 
country. This data would provide a solid foundation for establishing criteria 
to assess loan risk. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, insurance companies are better positioned to take on the risk of 
insuring loans. For these companies, insurance of commercial banks would 
represent only one line of business, with risk dispersed nationally. An 
insurance company that insures against the collectibility of a loan would be 
able to quantify risk on a loan-by-loan basis. This makes more sense than 
quantifying risk based on the overall operations of a financial institution, 
which is the current practice. 
</P>
<P>
In the event that private insurers were unwilling or unable to provide loan 
coverage, the federal government could offer coverage through an insurance 
company it established to provide these policies. This too would represent a 
better approach to managing risk in loan portfolios than simply changing the 
FDIC insurance premium schedule to rebuild the fund, or asking Congress to 
approve an emergency appropriation. 
</P>
<P>
By private insuring of individual loans, the basis for managing risk would be 
more fairly assessed, in the process protecting the FDIC's insurance fund from 
further erosions and banks against greater threat of failures.

As a consumer who is very concerned about the protection of our planet, why in 
the hell should I even consider respecting this product? 
</P>
<P>
* It makes hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
Styrene, polystyrene's main ingredient, was ranked as the fifth-worst hazardous 
waste producer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
* It destroys the ozone layer. CFCs and "newer" foaming agents used in 
polystyrene production cause ozone depletion and smog. 
</P>
<P>
* It poisons our health. Styrene is a public health hazard; it is toxic. 
Studies show that styrene leaches into foods, especially hot liquids. Think 
before you drink your hot coffee out of a Styrofoam cup this morning. 
</P>
<P>
* It kills wildlife. Sea birds in particular mistake polystyrene for food and 
die as a result of ulcers, suffocation and malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
* It is not biodegradable. Polystyrene lasts for hundreds of years. 
</P>
<P>
How about a little respect for our children and their children, who will have 
to endure the environmental mess left behind if we, the American consumers, 
continue to be duped and deceived by big industry.

WE ALL SHARE THE BLAME FOR DECEITFUL ADVERTISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bruce Horovitz' column, "Faked Volvo Spot Drives Another Nail Into Ad 
Industry's Credibility (Nov. 13)," focuses on the industry's gross deceit. But 
is it so gross that we notice? Apparently not. 
</P>
<P>
Most viewers would cynically agree that ads hoodwink the public and only be 
vaguely aghast that Volvo, Colgate, Campbell Soup Co., Pepsico and a multitude 
of other upstanding firms outright fudged their figures and their film. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that we are in a system of commerce that has institutionalized 
deceit. Both parties -- the public and the advertisers -- know that success is 
simply a question of who does the best job of lying, of dressing their puffery 
up in a form that we are willing to accept, if not as truth, at least as 
representative. Do we know that every price tag that reads $1.99 or $99.99 or 
$1,999.99 is a deception? Of course we do, and yet we accept it. 
</P>
<P>
It shouldn't surprise a jaded public that the recent elections were expositions 
in obfuscation, omission and fear-mongering mind-mangling. At some point we 
simply turn off our mental receivers, shake our heads in disbelief and go back 
to complaining about taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is so inbred that even otherwise honest advertisers (is that an 
oxymoron?) can't consider swinging back in the direction of truth for fear of 
losing market share. 
</P>
<P>
So while Horovitz and the rest of us address the itchy scaly rash, the disease 
quietly circulates below the surface, rendering us shallow, distracted and 
powerless. To quote Pogo, "We have seen the enemy, and he is us!"

Thank you for Michael Parrish's article, "Polystyrene Foam Just Wants a Little 
Respect From Environmentalists" (Nov. 11). 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure your article on the other side of the issue will have a great impact 
on the public's perception of the "styrene problem." 
</P>
<P>
Our industry is working hard to improve the unfair image projected by some 
environmental groups by reducing processing emissions, improved recycling 
centers and promotion of the benefits of plastics use. We are improving the 
American standard of living.

SEXISM IN SPORTS TRIPS UP GIRLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One is tempted to dismiss the two fathers' behavior, in requesting a gender 
check on the outstanding member of the Lewisville Blaze soccer team, as an 
aberrant, though crass, example of machismo insecurity ("Kicking Up a Storm," 
Nov. 8). 
</P>
<P>
However, I believe the article raises two important issues. 
</P>
<P>
Sexist attitudes do have an effect on girls' participation in sports. The 
exceptional athlete may ignore them, but as Carole Oglesby, department chair of 
physical education at Temple University, points out, "Barbs may drive away the 
average performer who will miss the joys and lessons of competition." 
</P>
<P>
Second, I have observed at youth soccer games in the last 10 years children 
being reduced to tears, not by events on the field, but by their parents 
berating them for failing to play hard enough.

DO ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS EAT MEAT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems to me there are more pressing needs in our society for the anti-fur 
people to pursue than passing out leaflets at theater openings and black-tie 
galas ("Drive Is Mounted to Make Furs Extinct," Nov. 20). 
</P>
<P>
Do they also protest leather jackets, shoes, handbags and belts? How many of 
them abstain from eating meat? Why don't they also pass out cards in 
restaurants that read, "Eating meat promotes the idea that it is acceptable to 
kill an animal to appease the appetite. Please don't eat meat." It would appear 
this zealous group is so intent upon foisting their beliefs upon others that 
they even slip their cards into fur wearers' pockets . . . "discreetly," of 
course.

KUDOS TO DUO OF DEVOTED SOCIAL WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few weeks ago, in response to President George Bush's "read my hips" remark, 
a local news commentator said, "Sometimes I think I'm watching theater of the 
absurd." The Nov. 16 View section evoked a similar response in me. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath the story about Kwasi Geiggar and Mal Neely's determined, compassionate 
struggle to help troubled teen-agers was a story about $250-$14,000 holiday 
dresses ("All Aglitter for the Holidays"). 
</P>
<P>
Who can unashamedly buy a $8,200 "French peach silk chiffon gown" when Geiggar 
and Neely are understaffed, some children won't have holiday meals, American 
soldiers won't have holidays at home, and recession knocks? 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, why do American women have to make themselves look like presents to 
be valued in our society? 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, wake up. Trade your holiday clothing funds for a donation to 
Geiggar and Neely's Camp Returnee program and you'll have an easier time 
looking in the mirror, even without your holiday duds.

<TEXT>
<P>
The article about Kwasi Geiggar ("The Last Hope," Nov. 16) was uplifting. 
</P>
<P>
Few people would make such an effort for the education of ghetto children. 
Geiggar is no faceless bureaucrat of a social worker. He is a dedicated 
professional working under trying and discouraging conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Other social workers devote themselves to trying but worthy causes, too. Why 
was Geiggar identified in the headline as a counselor? Why were we not told 
until the bottom of column 14 -- in a 15-column article -- that he is a social 
worker? Geiggar deserves to have his occupation identified in the headline.

A FUTILE SEARCH FOR LOW PROFILE

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Although the hidden homeless try to keep a low profile, they have attracted the 
attention of people who work with the homeless as well as police and city 
officials in more affluent areas. 
</P>
<P>
Officers in Santa Monica and Beverly Hills said they are aware these people 
live in their neighborhoods. They "drive their cars around in the daytime (and) 
we see them parked on streets at night," said a Santa Monica police sergeant 
who asked not to be identified. "We don't usually bother them as long as we 
have no complaints and they are not doing anything illegal." He said that 
residents sometimes call about suspicious cars parked outside their houses. 
Officers are sent to tell the car's occupant that a city law restricts 
overnight parking. 
</P>
<P>
Michele Merrill, Beverly Hills cultural services manager, says she is "shocked 
to see the number of homeless who daily use the library as their shelter." 
Merrill, whose office is in the city's new public library, says the homeless 
"use the (bathroom) facilities for whatever hygiene they need. I've seen them 
washing themselves and their clothing in the sink, brushing their teeth there, 
etc. Most don't look very well-groomed, but some really look good. . . . until 
you look down and see they're carrying their life in a shopping bag." 
</P>
<P>
These women are not just found on the Westside. Margaret Stone, volunteer 
coordinator for the North Hollywood Interfaith Food Pantry, said she has run 
across several of them. 
</P>
<P>
One is "the wife of a minister," Stone said. "She has an MA degree and all 
sorts of credentials. But she became homeless when her husband ran off with 
someone else and left her destitute. She had the house, but she couldn't keep 
up the payments and wound up living in her car. We have lots of hidden homeless 
families as well." 
</P>
<P>
Many are middle-class, out of work and living in cars. "They have been laid off 
from their jobs, and the only work they can get is so low-paying that they 
can't live on it." BETTIJANE LEVINE

ERMA BOMBECK: CHRISTMAS BY THE BOOK? HARDLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year, someone gave me Martha Stewart's Christmas book for holiday 
entertaining. That's about as cruel as someone offering to set up a deck chair 
for me on the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
We're talking about a woman who decorates a tree with homemade gingerbread 
cookies brushed with softly beaten egg whites and then painted with gold leaf. 
One year, I hung six fake birds on a tree outside my window. It rained, and 
they looked like their intestines were unraveling. 
</P>
<P>
As I leafed through the book recently, I must say it was seductive. It made 
everything seem so warm and fuzzy and possible. Maybe -- just maybe -- if I 
started early enough, I could pull off a Martha Stewart Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
I figure I'll start by making my own potpourri by gathering together 
tellicherry peppercorns, orrisroot powder, bayberry bark, senna pods, lemon 
verbena and rose hips. I could do that if I had any idea of what I just said. 
</P>
<P>
What the heck: I'll buy a bag at Hallmark and spend the time making homemade 
delicacies. I just have to figure out how many jars I need for onion chutney 
and how far ahead to make the crackers for the soups. I don't believe I said 
that. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if I really want to knock the socks off guests, I'll forgo 
the homemade wreaths and concentrate on the gingerbread mansion on Page 109. 
Yes! Let's see, all Martha lists for that is a recipe for gingerbread (piece of 
cake), another recipe for icing and an architectural drawing course! Give me a 
break, Martha. 
</P>
<P>
Who among us has not dreamed of making our own wrapping paper? Let's see, for 
that I assemble lots of plain brown paper, metallic paint, brushes, surgical 
gloves and a degree in fine arts. 
</P>
<P>
I leaf to the cooking section to see if perhaps there is something different to 
dazzle my holiday guests besides the traditional turkey and ham. There it is, 
all right: cassoulet. Cassoulet lists 22 ingredients, including such staples as 
six 5-pound ducks, two cups of fresh duck fat, 16 pounds of Great Northern 
beans and six pounds of garlic sausage. It serves 100 (I had only 63 at my 
wedding) and takes three days to process. The oven is your problem. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so maybe I won't have a Martha Stewart Christmas, but at least the pictures 
got me in the mood. I saw the book the other day at a bookstore. When no one 
was looking, I moved it from the "Entertaining" shelf to a table stacked with 
fiction.

NORMAN LEAR REINVENTED THE SITCOM IN THE '70S, BUT IS CBS OR THE TV AUDIENCE 
READY FOR A COMEDY SERIES WITH A SPIRITUAL SIDE?

Norman's back. 
</P>
<P>
These past few months, at places like Sunset-Gower Studios in Hollywood, 
Burbank and the valet-parking line of the Beverly-Wilshire Hotel -- where actor 
Robert Loggia, star of Norman Lear's newest TV series, was retrieving his car 
-- the phrase has assumed the tone of mantra: Norman's back. 
</P>
<P>
 Lear is said to be thriving, he's smiling a different smile, he's revved up 
again. He's put on a vanilla porkpie hat like the one he wore when he fashioned 
gruff, bigoted Archie Bunker and his good wife Edith out of a British series, 
made them part of America's family, and changed the face of television 
situation comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Producer, writer, director, political maven, media mogul -- a man of many and 
sometimes contradictory parts -- Lear has come full circle, returning to what 
he knows best, making an ambitious sitcom and veering off, he maintains, on yet 
another uncharted path. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicle is "Sunday Dinner," a six-episode series for CBS that he hopes will 
provoke reflection as well as laughter -- reflection about the spiritualism 
that he sees lacking at America's core just now. 
</P>
<P>
Another family series with several generations living under the same roof, 
"Sunday Dinner" could just as easily be called "All in the Family." Yet it's as 
different as the 1990s are from the 1970s. So much has happened since then -- 
to the country, to the TV industry and its audience and to Lear himself. 
Perhaps nowhere is this better reflected than in the fact that despite Lear's 
phenomenal track record, CBS has ordered only six episodes of "Sunday Dinner" 
thus far and has yet to announce air dates for them. 
</P>
<P>
It's been nearly 20 years since CBS introduced, on Jan. 12, 1971, "All in the 
Family," a sitcom Lear developed that dealt with racism, rape, sexism, 
impotence and all those unsayable racial and ethnic epithets, a series that 
begat "The Jeffersons" and "Maude," which begat "Good Times," making Lear king 
of a multimillion-dollar media empire that ultimately embraced publishing, 
broadcast stations, theaters as well as TV and motion picture production. (Not 
that he was a one-man band. He had partners, and teams of writers, producers 
and directors, but, as "All in the Family" writer Bernie West put it, he was 
"the general saying, 'C'mon fellas, we can take this hill . . . and we could.' 
") 
</P>
<P>
And it's been 10 years since Lear founded People for the American Way. He had 
left TV in 1978, saying he wanted to "flex other creative muscles," perhaps a 
satirical movie about televangelists to be called "Religion." Instead, after 
watching Fundamentalist preachers such as Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and 
Jimmy Swaggart, he became deeply concerned "at the way they were mixing 
politics and religion," and wrote a 60-second ad saying this was "not the 
American way." Out of that grew the liberal, anti-Religious Right organization 
that battled censorship and later helped defeat Supreme Court nominee Robert 
Bork. 
</P>
<P>
Now he has another concern to address, and so it's back to television -- 
putting not only his reputation on the line (an earlier "return," in 1984, 
ended quickly with an unsold pilot for NBC and a six-episode series for ABC, 
"a.k.a. Pablo") but also, in a very real sense, his own story. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunday Dinner" centers around 56-year-old widower Ben Benedict (Loggia, who 
played the title role in "Mancuso, FBI"), who has a printing business and three 
grown children, and his fiancee, TT Fagori (Teri Hatcher), 30, an environmental 
attorney. They are not that unlike Norman Lear, 68, and his wife Lyn Davis 
Lear, 43. "I obviously took from my life," Lear says. He has three grown 
daughters from two former marriages -- the eldest of whom is also 43 -- and a 
strapping blond two-year-old, Benjamin Davis Lear. Lyn Lear, whom he married 
three years ago following his divorce from Frances Lear, holds a doctorate in 
psychology; her dissertation compared "self-actualization" results between 
Unitarian and Fundamentalist church members in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the "Sunday Dinner" subtext, says Lear, is "the profound issues -- 
God, religion, various beliefs, the inner life, the need for it, the lack of 
need for it, ultimately meaning: What the . . . is it all about? Where do we go 
from here? How does humankind survive?" 
</P>
<P>
On a September afternoon, Lear strides into the studio whistling. His forehead 
is a chart of lines but his eyes are bright blue, his body is taut -- he works 
out daily with a former Marine personal trainer -- and he exudes energy. "When 
people ask me in a line how would I describe the series," he says, "it's a 
spiritual bull entering a 1990s, neurotic, chaotic, human china shop." 
</P>
<P>
The spiritual bull, he says, is the younger woman who talks to God. Sometimes 
she refers to God as He/She/Someone, but when it's personal, as in a longish 
monologue on a fire escape, she talks to the Chief. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to get 360-degrees of attitude" about religion, Lear explains. 
"The older daughter (Vicky, 32) is a microbiologist, possibly an atheist. Her 
12-year-old daughter (Rachel) thinks so. She's certainly agnostic . . . (and) 
holds the thinking of a good deal of science. Her sister (Diana, 30), a 
designer, has been groping. She's been through a lot of New Age things, fads 
and diets. The son (Kenneth, 26) is a product of the Reagan years, and he's got 
a god -- materialism. Money. 
</P>
<P>
"The aunt (Martha) is a strict Bible-believing Christian woman. Amusing, 
interesting but very straight in the way she reads Scripture. (Ben) was raised 
the same way but turned in another direction. He became too upset as he studied 
history with 
</P>
<P>
the amount of wars started for religious reasons. With the Crusades and the 
Holocaust. Too many people behaved too badly in God's name. And so he holds it 
at a distance." 
</P>
<P>
As has Lear, who is Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
On "Sunday Dinner" there's talk of "cosmic piety," of an "immense 
intelligence," of "the natural world (being) the largest sacred community to 
which we all belong." 
</P>
<P>
The genesis of "Sunday Dinner" was a project called "Good Evening He Lied," 
which he bought from a treatment prepared by ex-anchorwoman Marcia Brandwynne 
after she was fired by KNXT, now KCBS, in 1982. "I wanted to savage TV news 
before 'Broadcast News' or any of that stuff," Lear notes. He also wanted the 
female lead to have "some grounding in faith." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, with People for the American Way, he began meeting 
"theologians, pastors, ministers. . . . I started off reflexively writing off 
anybody that called himself a born-again Christian. I'm a Jew. I always had a 
keen nose for anti-Semitism as a kid growing up and in the Army, but also a 
very strong feeling about the country and the First Amendment and the 
Constitution, which were my protectors as a member of a minority." 
</P>
<P>
But he soon realized that "born-again followers were missing something. . . . 
And it touched off something in me, which has always been in me, which is my 
own spiritual bent. Which I would identify largely as love. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Lear says he "worked like hell trying to write" the female lead, even had 
theological friends prepare monographs, but eventually returned the title to 
Brandwynne. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Lyn Davis. "Along the way the last person I sought to do a monograph was 
somebody I met who was close in age to the (character) I was writing (about). 
But she was working on her doctoral dissertation and couldn't do the thing. 
And," he says contentedly, "we fell in love." 
</P>
<P>
They had met in 1984, Lear says, when a mutual friend had brought her on a 
blind date to the house for a dinner party. It was during a period when he and 
Frances had separated and then "came back together, and that lasted for about a 
month. . . . The evening was spent largely talking about People for the 
American Way and her dissertation. 
</P>
<P>
"We had lunch a couple of weeks later. . . ," he adds, "and over time fell in 
love. (The) marriage was over." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he says, "the desire deepened in me to find a way to do a show in 
which the inner life was discussed. . . . And then I read a book, 'Dream of the 
Earth' by Thomas Berry, a 76-year-old Passionist Father . . . about the 
marriage of religion (to) feelings that were fanned by the environmental 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
"And (then) I said, 'I know my lady ('Sunday Dinner's' TT character),' " he 
adds, clapping his hands. "I know what she feels, what she thinks . . . and I 
bought the rights to it, so I could quote liberally. . . . This is a major 
figure in religion who (said), 'Norman, sometimes I think we should take the 
Bible and the Koran and the Talmud, put those holy symbols aside until we 
remember what we find sacred in that tree, in that butterfly and in each 
other.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lyn, whose "spiritual essence" as well as "purity and sunniness" is like the 
character TT's, helped in his quest, Lear says. "When she came into my life, 
there was at the center of my life for the first time somebody who could 
nurture this." 
</P>
<P>
It is early November. Piles of boxes await the movers at Lear's Brentwood 
house, which Henry Fonda once owned and where Lear has lived since 1972. To his 
table have come countless senators and presidential candidates for private 
dinner parties and fund-raisers. And here, in the fall of 1988, Democratic 
nominee Michael Dukakis met studio executives and stars. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting down to talk in his library, Lear turns on his tape recorder, 
apparently for his own record. For a man who prides himself on "moments of 
hilarity," the conversation is weighty. He's tackling bringing the spiritual to 
TV because of "this aching cavity in people's chests. My God, look at what we 
had. What have you got if the whole country is out for itself and everybody you 
know is only thinking of himself?" 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he adds, "the dominant influence in our culture is business, 
where once it was the church, and those morals and that morality had a big 
influence on American families. . . . If we're talking about the saving of the 
planet or that last war as the result of nuclear, or what the Iraquis threaten 
us with, with chemicals and terrorists anywhere and everywhere . . . the next 
leap forward had better be a leap inward. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Yet Lear knows that for "Sunday Dinner" to succeed, he can't depend on 
spiritual "subtext" alone. "If these people aren't entertaining, if the stories 
aren't funny or touching or serious and interesting, then subtext doesn't 
matter at all. Ain't nobody going to hear it." 
</P>
<P>
While Lear takes a call from PBS' Bill Moyers, Lyn Lear shows the couple's art: 
the David Hockney "Sprinklers" in the screening room, the Robert Graham 
sculptures and the colored-glass De Wain Valentine columns, the Richard 
Diebenkorn, Sam Francis and Jim Dine in the gallery; the pre-Columbian art on 
the Giacometti table in the living room, the Jasper Johns over the fireplace. 
"We bought a huge Rauschenberg for the screening room in our new house," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Jim Dine sits a puppy pen. Lyn Lear breeds Maltese dogs as a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
Their new 12,300-square-foot home is off Mandeville Canyon on a nearly 10-acre 
site, which Lear says is costing $15 million to buy and remodel. The property 
will have a facility for 30 cars built cantilevered under a tennis court that 
is being built on a hilltop. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Brentwood house is for sale, along with a New York apartment. 
Lear also owns a 150-plus acre vacation retreat outside Bennington, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the library, Lear notes that "Sunday Dinner" wasn't easy to prepare. 
Two years ago he underwent a radical prostatechtomy. A friend said that he also 
suffered a case of writer's block. Lear dismisses that. He always has "a 
difficult time getting started on something fresh, which people really close to 
me, who love me, say, 'Give yourself a break; it's the incubation period,' and 
I'm the one who beats on myself," he says, punching his left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no ability to draw on past successes to sustain me: 'Now wait a second, 
Norman, you've worried this way before, you've done it before, and people liked 
it before. Therefore why are you going crazy again?' This is what I mean by not 
being able to go with the Tao. . . , " he says, referring to the ancient 
Chinese philosopher Lao-tzu's "Tao Te Ching," or Book of the Way. He picks up a 
thin-volumed translation of the "Tao" by Stephen Mitchell, a Berkeley scholar 
and translator. Lear also has Mitchell's rendition on tape. When he can't 
sleep, he listens. 
</P>
<P>
CBS initially had wanted "Sunday Dinner" to debut in September. "To get six 
shows ready, I would have had to do it all in eight or 10 weeks. And I just 
don't work that way," Lear says. 
</P>
<P>
Then his return to TV was to have been in October with a five-times-a-week 
late-night series consisting of two 15-minute stories, "Jody Gordon and the 
News" and "The Storyteller." But he pulled out. "I think he got so involved 
with 'Sunday Dinner' that none of him was going to be in 'Jody Gordon,' " CBS 
Entertainment President Jeff Sagansky suggested recently. "I don't think he 
wanted that to be . . . his return." 
</P>
<P>
In large measure Lear is at a crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
Even as he went into production with "Sunday Dinner" this summer, substantial 
business losses, particularly in publishing, forced Lear to begin dismantling 
parts of ACT III Communications, his privately owned multi-media conglomerate. 
He blames "too many acquisitions in a bad market," again in publishing, but 
concedes: "Listen, the buck stops with me; I certainly was apprised. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
In September, ACT III Publishing folded two magazines, Television Engineering 
and Corporate Video Decisions. In October it sold Marketing &amp; Media 
Decisions magazine to Affiliated Publications for an undisclosed amount. Last 
month it suspended publication of The Marketer, a monthly magazine aimed at 
marketing executives. The company still owns other magazines, including 
Channels, a trade magazine for the TV industry, though Lear notes: "If we can 
sell the others, we'll sell them." 
</P>
<P>
A score of employees were axed; he says that more may go. Retrenchment has in 
turn bred an undercurrent of resentment. As severance, employees basically 
received two weeks per year of service. "That's what the company policy was," 
says Lear. 
</P>
<P>
"The hypocrisy is there," said one former ACT III executive. "Lear's speeches 
stressing the dangers of bottom-line thinking and personal greed measured 
against his own creeping materialism; promoting ethics in business through the 
creation of the Business Enterprise Trust while at the same time providing 
barest severance to employees. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, with $1.3 million and a blue-chip board, Lear helped found Business 
Enterprise Trust to identify acts of courage, integrity and social vision in 
business. Now in the context of the trade publications he folded, he says: "We 
know how we can hunker down and stay lean and mean." 
</P>
<P>
"It's fine to cut back, but I think you could treat people reasonably," said 
another ex-executive. "Something closer to the industry standard would have 
been three to six months (severance pay)." 
</P>
<P>
"That's ridiculous," scoffs Lear. "There's no industry (standard). Who gave you 
all that?" 
</P>
<P>
ACT III is also pulling back in broadcasting. The company has eight Fox 
affiliates; it had been expected to own 12, but Lear says he won't acquire any 
more. And he's cutting movie production. 
</P>
<P>
As its troubles began, ACT III Communications, according to a key inside 
source, had about $500 million in assets, gross revenues of $200 million, an 
annual cash flow of about $60 million and was several hundred million in debt. 
Lear, who doesn't disclose the numbers, doesn't like the word debt. "Has the 
company got investors to whom are owed money? Certainly . . ." 
</P>
<P>
According to Lear, the business picture isn't all bleak. While "publishing has 
just been a national disaster, and my company and my investment in it has been 
suffering like everything else," Lear adds that "happily we also have a theater 
business and our theaters are doing very well. Our theaters are kind of choice 
little groups. . . . And broadcasting, we were lucky enough or smart enough to 
build small Fox affiliates at a time when the Fox logo had begun to mean 
something. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Movies I didn't have a lot of luck either," and he pauses: "Well I did have 
some . . . Just got a check this week on 'Princess Bride' . . . We're going to 
make two films this year, and there may be another. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
ACT III was named for that phase in his business life. He and Bud Yorkin had 
started Tandem Productions in 1959, making such films as "Come Blow Your Horn," 
"Start the Revolution Without Me" and "Divorce American Style" before moving to 
television with "All in the Family" and "Sanford &amp; Son." In 1974, Lear 
started T.A.T. Communications, the acronym for the Yiddish phrase Tochis Affen 
Tisch, or put your butt on the table, which produced "One Day at a Time," "Mary 
Hartman, Mary Hartman" and other shows. "Norman felt that he really wanted to 
be, as he put it, the sole creative captain of his ship," noted then partner A. 
Jerrold Perenchio, who handled the business side. That became the independent 
TV powerhouse Embassy Communications, which he and Perenchio sold to Coca-Cola 
in 1985 for $485 million. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Lear was listed by Forbes magazine as one of the 400 richest people in 
the United States, with an estimated net worth of $225 million -- only to be 
deleted in 1987 following his $112-million divorce settlement from his second 
wife, Frances, with whom he had a 29-year-marriage and two daughters. She since 
has become founder and editor-in-chief of the women's magazine Lear's. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, ACT III Communications and Columbia Pictures Television formed a 
joint venture, with Lear having "total creative and business autonomy" while 
Columbia retains all domestic and foreign distribution rights to ACT III 
Television's programming. 
</P>
<P>
Lear has a three-show deal with CBS. In addition to "Sunday Dinner," a pilot on 
a second series called "Balls!" set in New York in the 1890s, is scheduled for 
production in January. Several more are in varying stages of development. 
</P>
<P>
Lear indicates that he would like to build a new Tandem or T.A.T, but he 
insists that "Sunday Dinner" isn't simply a vehicle to start down that road. 
"No. Anymore than it was to address teachers," he says, referring to a speech 
he gave last July to the National Education Assn. in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
"Schools cannot avoid the teaching about the core values that bind our society 
together" -- including religion, Lear had told the educators. Such instruction 
must "not trample on the sensibilities of minority faiths," he added. "But even 
granting there is a risk, the greater danger would be to forfeit all discussion 
in the schools of the inner needs of humankind. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Now this, Norman Lear wouldn't have said 10 years ago, would he? "He wasn't 
wise enough or smart enough -- or whatever comes with growth and age," Lear 
replies. 
</P>
<P>
Lear is a man of many connections -- in entertainment, in media, in politics, 
in business. Organizations that he helped found have expanded those connections 
-- and enhanced his power base. 
</P>
<P>
The Business Trust board includes chairman James E. Burke, former board 
chairman of Johnson &amp; Johnson and Warren E. Buffett, chairman and CEO of 
Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and at $3.3 billion the second richest man in the 
nation. Last year Norman and Lyn Lear helped found the Environmental Media 
Assn., whose purpose is to place environmentally correct messages into movies 
and on TV. On Nov. 18 in New York, People for the American Way gave Lear its 
"Spirit of Liberty" award; dinner co-chairs included Michael Eisner, Michael 
Ovitz, Marvin Davis, Barry Diller, Steven J. Ross, Robert Redford, Howard 
Stringer, Katharine Graham. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians recognize Lear's reach. If you're an officeholder or running for 
office, notes John Emerson, chief deputy Los Angeles city attorney, who had 
been deputy campaign manager for Gary Hart, "you want the word of mouth on you 
to be good . . . there aren't a lot of people in the liberal wing of the 
Democratic party who can be comfortable with the chairmen of Fortune 500 
companies." 
</P>
<P>
Lear grew up in modest circumstances in both Connecticut and Brooklyn. His 
sister recalls him as a "card, a cutup" at Hartford's Weaver High. But in 1940 
-- the year he sold both Franklin Roosevelt and Wendell Willkie pennants and 
buttons -- he also won first prize in the American Legion Oratorical Contest 
for New England. His subject was the Constitution and what it meant to him 
personally. He won a full scholarship to Emerson College but went only a year. 
He enlisted in the Army Air Force and flew 56 missions in World War II as a 
radioman. 
</P>
<P>
He came to California more than 40 years ago to write, with his first wife and 
year-old daughter. Five weeks ago, he went over to CBS to participate in a 
tribute for Bill Paley and ran into Danny Thomas, his first big-name employer. 
</P>
<P>
Lear almost personifies Hollywood longevity, spanning generations. Carl Reiner 
got to know Lear in the early 1950s when they were neighbors on New York's Fire 
Island. His son, Rob, used to play jacks with Lear's eldest daughter. In the 
'70s, Rob Reiner became Mike Stivic, Archie Bunker's "Meathead" son-in-law, and 
in the 1980s Lear was producing Reiner's movies: first "This is Spinal Tap" and 
"The Sure Thing" at Embassy, and later "Princess Bride" and "Stand By Me" at 
ACT III. 
</P>
<P>
At a People for the American Way dinner here Oct. 29, Lear, as emcee, 
introduced Carrie Fisher as "a high-bred hybrid," referring to parents Debbie 
Reynolds, and Eddie Fisher. Reynolds starred in Lear's "Divorce American 
Style," and Fisher dedicated his book, "Eddie: My Life, My Loves," published in 
1981, "To Lyn (Davis), who arrived just in time." He also wrote that "in Lyn, I 
have found a kind of love that was new to me. . . . She is the most complete 
woman I have ever known: deeply spiritual yet practical. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
On the first "Sunday Dinner" script -- the only one of the six on which Lear 
takes a writing credit -- the executive who was heading ACT III Television 
wrote on the cover: "A love letter to Lyn Lear." 
</P>
<P>
As one writer noted, Lear was all over the series "like white on rice." Another 
writer said, "whenever TT's in a scene, you know he wrote it." About that Lear 
laughs. 
</P>
<P>
So much in the series is traceable to Lear. In one scene, TT pinches the skin 
of Benedict's hand to show the difference between younger skin and older skin. 
Lyn Lear affectionately does the same thing at the corner of her husband's eye 
after he frets that photographs will show his lines. 
</P>
<P>
As in the series, it was after he and Lyn came back from a trip to Africa that 
Lear told his daughters about their relationship. "I did like Ben Benedict -- 
moving too fast. Insisting that they ought to be able to get together and find 
each other and love each other more quickly than life allows. Ben is doing 
that. I did that. I just felt that these are all wonderful people, they are all 
going to love each other. I was trying . . . to control it." 
</P>
<P>
"My daughters love their mother very deeply," Lear explains. "(And) Frances was 
very much alive. But a daughter isn't eager to meet the woman that has replaced 
her mother. It would be unreal if one were to assume that they would find that" 
-- he laughs -- "enjoyable. But they love me. I have great daughters, terrific 
daughters. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
All three live in New York. Ellen Lear, who is divorced, is a sex therapist. 
Kate Lear, 32, who is married to a physician, is head of development for ACT 
III in New York, and was occasionally on the set. Maggie Lear, 31, who is 
single, has, her father says, "a special gift for working with emotionally 
troubled kids, and she just went back to NYU to pick up her (masters in social 
work) and then her Ph.D." 
</P>
<P>
"They're crazy about Benjamin," he adds. "And their mother is in the best place 
she's ever been. Emotionally. Physically. She's done for herself what I never 
could have done for her. She gave herself everything she needed." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about her magazine, he replies, "I like Lear's. It's a good book." 
</P>
<P>
Did it bother him, the use of their name? 
</P>
<P>
"Nah," he shrugs. "Everybody thought it would. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
He is a man of surprising contrasts: 
</P>
<P>
A First Amendment champion who tries, sometimes none too subtlely, to control 
stories and the timing of stories written about him. He grants certain access 
to his set but resists sitting down with him for a one-on-one session. "Her pen 
is moving again," a publicist tells Lear as a reporter takes notes and a 
photographer shoots pictures of him working inside the "Sunday Dinner" studio 
booth. Yet when Lear does talk, he provides lunch and hours of frank 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
He's discussing Tao philosophy. "As human beings, we are inclined to put 
ourselves in the way of the natural flow. We worry about things we cannot 
control . . . like what are you going to write about me? I cannot control that. 
What do I worry about it for?" 
</P>
<P>
That night he phones and asks whether quotes can be read back to him. 
</P>
<P>
He is a civil libertarian who advocates the separation of church and state and 
yet says: "Why is no President or officeholder sounding like (Vaclav) Havel (on 
spirituality)? Why aren't we making these sounds? Gorbachev is making them. . . 
. It's obvious the culture is screaming for it." 
</P>
<P>
Is Lear an executive who, as producer Patricia Palmer says, always has an "open 
door -- you can stick your head in, have a chit-chat, you don't have to go 
through layers, levels of people?" Or is he, as someone formerly in his TV 
department saw him, "very much like Ronald Reagan; he has insulated himself 
beautifully. . . . "? 
</P>
<P>
Is he the man who welcomes suggestions from virtually anyone on his set, a man 
whom actors genuinely respect because he both supports them and pushes them 
into doing their best work, a man who energizes even at midnight, and whom 
writers such as Wayne Lemon, son of a Texas Baptist minister, find they can 
challenge when it comes to altering precious words in a script? Or does he 
court a sycophantic chorus? 
</P>
<P>
As for the new house, he dismisses any notion that the cost may have caused him 
problems with the business, as has been whispered. "It's common sense," Lear 
answers. "How could a company this size depend on the difference between $15 
million for a house and -- given the property and everything else, nobody would 
imagine it could be much less. Tens of millions (in losses) in publishing, and 
somebody is talking about a guy who is over on a house?" 
</P>
<P>
An environmentalist, he sees no conflict in how much space he is alotting for 
cars at the new house, though he shrinks from calling the 30-car facility, 
which he will use for political and social events, a garage. "This is the way 
America lives," says Lear. 
</P>
<P>
In his speeches, Lear constantly decries material matters -- any conflict here? 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing in anything I say that would suggest a portion of my hard-won 
(earnings) can't be used to pleasure myself, my family. You don't build things 
or cause things to happen without other people feeding themselves also. . . . 
(It) isn't on somebody's finger or going in a vault as some art does, and lots 
of jewels. It's going to make work for a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
Which sounds something like the classic trickle-down Republican argument. 
</P>
<P>
He is talking about why he chose Robert Loggia, aside from talent, to play Ben 
Benedict on "Sunday Dinner." 
</P>
<P>
"I see in Ben Benedict a strong, controlling, vulnerable man, anxious to be the 
master of his destiny and everybody else's around him, all with good intent. . 
. . Loggia has this in his face, in his manner." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds like Lear? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I would describe me that way. . . . " He stops: "Now if Lyn 
were sitting here, she might have laughed quietly."

<P>
While films like "Home Alone" and "Dances With Wolves" are making headlines for 
big box office, "Blue Planet" -- the environmentally themed IMAX space film -- 
has quietly become the hottest ticket ever at the California Museum of Science 
and Industry's IMAX Theater. 
</P>
<P>
In its first three days, it racked up more than $16,500 in ticket sales -- a 
house record. 
</P>
<P>
In its second week -- over the Thanksgiving holidays -- it earned $30,666. 
There's now talk of extending the film beyond its February play date. 
</P>
<P>
Filmed from space, the 42-minute "Blue Planet" gives moviegoers' an 
astronauts'-eye-view of Mother Earth -- something only 200 astronauts had 
experienced before the film's showing. 
</P>
<P>
Presented by the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum and 
the Lockheed Corp. in cooperation with NASA, it's currently at a dozen IMAX 
theaters. (IMAX movies boast a frame 10 times the size of conventional 
35-millimeter films and are shown on huge screens.) Locally, the film runs six 
times daily, with tickets priced from $3.50-$5.50. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Evan Nossoff estimates that the museum has shown 18-20 IMAX films 
since its theater opened in the summer of 1984. None has taken off like "Blue 
Planet" which, Nossoff says, got both good reviews and coverage in the 
environmental press. Pat H. Broeske

OUTTAKES: KID 'N PLAY GROW UP

<P>
New Line Cinema also has "House Party II" in pre-production, aiming for a late 
winter start, and this time out, those two teen-age cut-ups -- the rap duo Kid 
'n Play -- have to grow up. 
</P>
<P>
The sequel "will be a bigger film in every way," says Janet Grillo, New Line's 
executive on the "under $5-million" production. 
</P>
<P>
"The themes will be more mature, but it will still be an entertaining caper 
comedy." 
</P>
<P>
Kid, the central character, will leave his black neighborhood and head for 
college, where he will encounter "a whole new world" -- including new styles of 
racism. His father -- played by the late Robin Harris in "I" -- will have died, 
and Kid will "take on issues of manhood" as he tries to fulfill his father's 
hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Actor-comic-playwright Rusty Cundieff wrote the script for the sequel; video 
and stage director Paris Barclay will direct. (Both are black.) The original 
film's creators, brothers Reginald and Warrington Hudlin, have moved on to a 
three-picture deal at Columbia but will serve as executive producers on the 
sequel. 
</P>
<P>
"House Party," shot for $2.5 million, grossed about $26 million in North 
America earlier this year. Although New Line hoped to reach a white audience 
with the picture, Grillo says ticket buyers were "almost exclusively inner-city 
black teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
With its collegiate backdrop, she feels, "II" may have "more crossover 
potential." John M. Wilson

OUTTAKES: MARILYN AS A MOM: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John M. Wilson

<TEXT>
<P>
The Role She Lost 
</P>
<P>
When Fox Broadcasting Co. airs its one-hour special, "Marilyn: Something's Got 
to Give," on Dec. 13 at 9 p.m., we'll see Marilyn Monroe the closest she ever 
came to the motherhood she so desperately wanted. 
</P>
<P>
The Fox documentary chronicles the final months in the life and career of the 
doomed star, with never-before-seen footage from the last film she worked on -- 
"Something's Got to Give." Twentieth Century Fox fired her from the film just 
after her 36th birthday, June 1, 1962. She committed suicide about two months 
later. 
</P>
<P>
The comedy, in which Monroe had her first screen role as a mother, was never 
completed. In real life, Monroe had undergone abortions and suffered 
miscarriages and was known to be nearly obsessed about having children, 
according to some Hollywood historians. 
</P>
<P>
Alexandra Heilweil and Robert Christopher Morley played Monroe's two young 
children for about eight weeks until the studio pulled the plug, reportedly 
because Monroe missed so many work days. 
</P>
<P>
So intent were the Fox Broadcasting producers on interviewing the two for the 
documentary that they placed ads in several newspapers and later hired a 
private investigator to track them down. 
</P>
<P>
Heilweil, 5 at the time "Something" was in its troubled production, is now 33. 
A physicist, she's currently "between jobs," working as a waitress in Florida. 
"I really don't remember much (about the filming)," she says. "It was a long 
time ago." 
</P>
<P>
Morley (now legally Christopher Robert Morley) was 8 during the shoot. Now 37, 
he's a Wall Street bond trader. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that I remember most about her is that she was very 
personable," Morley says of Monroe. "You can sense as a little kid who really 
cares about you and who could care less. I distinctly remember that she was 
very warm, that she would spend time talking to you as another human being, as 
opposed to some of the other actors (Dean Martin, Cyd Charisse and Wally Cox 
co-starred). At least as a kid, it felt pretty genuine. 
</P>
<P>
"She was very sensitive. I remember my scenes with her a lot more than with the 
others, which were very mechanical." 
</P>
<P>
Fox Broadcasting's Henry Schipper, who wrote, narrated and co-produced the 
special with Ken Turner, says that outtakes from the ill-fated production -- 
which later was made as "Move Over, Darling" -- show a maternal Monroe both 
on-camera and off. 
</P>
<P>
After one take, he notes, the camera captured her "rolling around with the two 
kids, tickling them, laughing, really enjoying them. The emotions on her face 
as she looks at them are marvelous . . . in the outtakes, you get a profile of 
Marilyn Monroe as a real person." 
</P>
<P>
Morley, of course, was too young at the time to know if Monroe felt emotional 
reverberations from real life in her scripted role as a mother. But, in 
retrospect, he senses the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . The only photo I have from that time is a very small picture of Marilyn 
hugging the two kids," Morley said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Monroe, the work of Morley and Heilweil in "Something's Got to Give" was 
also final. Neither performed again. John M. Wilson

ON THE RECORD: IT'S THE SEASON FOR 'APPALACHIAN SPRING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recording industry, which seldom fails to respect composers' major 
anniversaries, particularly those slighted in the concert hall, has been 
sparing indeed in its recognition of the 90th birthday of Aaron Copland, 
arguably the most important musician this country has produced. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, CBS started issuing on CD its splendid collection of 
composer-conducted performances of the 1970s, with the object of completing the 
re-release project in time for Copland's 90th birthday last month. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing of the sort has happened. Among the missing are the "Organ" Symphony 
and "Short" Symphony, the excerpts from "The Tender Land" (a more vital 
realization of this problematic work that the overly respectful complete 
recording recently released by Virgin Classics), the Piano Concerto and 
"Vitebsk," the latter two with the composer as keyboard soloist, and many other 
compositions vital to a rounded picture of their composer. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies have not proven hotbeds of activity either, with much 
duplication of available works or, simply, lack of interest. 
</P>
<P>
"Appalachian Spring" remains the recorded favorite, but these days in the 
original chamber version for 13 players, created for Martha Graham in 1944, 
rather than the composer's later concert suite for full orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Three new chamber versions are on the market, but only one deserves the label 
"complete original version." It comes to us from a fine ensemble called the 
Atlantic Sinfonietta, which, according to the printed insert, "divides its 
activities chiefly between New York City and Massachusetts" (Koch 7019). 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Schenck conducts this lively, dancey and lyrical account of the 
still-rarely heard complete score, which presents material not included in the 
orchestral version -- six minutes of darkly dramatic music, adding an element 
of danger to what can at times sound just a bit too sweetly disingenuous. 
</P>
<P>
The Koch CD, recorded with appropriate intimacy and warmth, contains another 
"original, complete": the work its composer, Samuel Barber, called "Medea" and 
wrote for Martha Graham's ballet "Cave of the Heart." In this case, neither of 
the composer's two subsequent full-orchestra versions has made much more 
headway in the repertory than the small-ensemble original. 
</P>
<P>
One searches in vain here for the composer's characteristic, endearing lyrical 
goo. "Medea" is terse, arid stuff, with strong suggestions of Stravinsky's 
late-'30s and '40s neoclassicism. The juxtaposition with the contemporaneous, 
similarly scored "Appalachian Spring" makes sense, but it is also unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based St. Luke's Chamber Orchestra is not on its best behavior 
under Dennis Russell Davies' direction in a scrappy, perhaps hastily prepared 
chamber "Appalachian Spring" shorn of the aforementioned "dark" passages. 
</P>
<P>
The two other works included in this Copland program (Musicmasters 7055) are 
worthwhile rarities, well-executed by members of the St. Luke's orchestra: the 
poignant, under-appreciated 1961 Nonet for Strings and the Two Pieces for 
String Quartet, elegant souvenirs of the composer's membership in the 1920s 
Paris workshop of Nadia Boulanger. 
</P>
<P>
"Appalachian Spring" also figures in a Copland program by conductor William 
Boughton and his English Symphony Orchestra (Nimbus 5246). The edition employed 
(and rather stiffly played) is an unsatisfactory compromise, with strings added 
to the chamber scoring and the usual cuts enforced, giving us the best of 
neither world. 
</P>
<P>
The program further includes "Quiet City," its solos too brashly played and 
loudly recorded; a charmless reading of the Four Dance Episodes from "Rodeo," 
and a Nonet that sounds sleepy beside Musicmasters' intense account. 
</P>
<P>
A charming curiosity is the composer's idiomatic arrangement for solo piano of 
the usual "Rodeo" episodes, part of a CD devoted to Copland's keyboard music 
(Nimbus 5267). The pianist is Alan Marks, who may be remembered as an Affiliate 
Artist at the Los Angeles Music Center more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Marks brings a big technique and plenty of rhythmic kick to the dances, 
sensitive coloration to the rare and attractive "Four Piano Blues" (published 
in 1949 but with elements dating back to the '20s) and the requisite dexterity 
and frowning authority to the knuckle-busting Piano Variations of 1930. 
</P>
<P>
The value of Marks' transcriptions of Copland's "Old American Songs," however, 
eludes this listener. Voiceless and textless, the songs' pungent charm 
evaporates, leaving us with a set of slender parlor pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Copland completed his tremendous Third Symphony in 1946 but only during the 
past decade has it been programmed with anything resembling frequency. Its 
belated popularity has much to do with the passionate advocacy of the late 
Leonard Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
While the lush, grandly rhetorical Bernstein/New York Philharmonic recording 
(Deutsche Grammophon 419170) is one no Copland fan is likely to be without, the 
Symphony lends itself to a variety of approaches, such as the more stark and 
orderly alternative offered by Leonard Slatkin and his splendid St. Louis 
Symphony (RCA Victor 60149). 
</P>
<P>
The coupling is the tough, compelling and seldom-heard "Music for a Great City" 
(New York), which Copland derived from his score for the 1961 film "Something 
Wild." Slatkin and the orchestra capture the work's ferocious rhythmic drive to 
perfection and RCA's recording, in both works, combines optimal clarity with 
roof-raising power.

CRUSADERS' SAMPLE TACKLES TOUGH THEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, Zan Stewart is a Times free-lance jazz writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keyboardist/composer Joe Sample has long believed that music speaks louder than 
words. 
</P>
<P>
So when Sample wanted to write a theme album about the demise of the black 
community in this country, he put hands to keys rather than pen to paper. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an issue I wanted to address, rather than talk about," Sample says of 
"Ashes to Ashes," his new Warner Bros. album. "Music is the greatest of our 
languages. Spoken language often needs translation, but not music." 
</P>
<P>
A founding member of the Crusaders, Sample has recorded such well-received solo 
albums as "Rainbow Seeker" and "Spellbound" and has played cameos with artists 
ranging from Joni Mitchell to Al Jarreau. But can instrumental music deal with 
a subject as broad as the one he's chosen? 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt that words just come and go fast," the 51-year-old says, a 
gentle expression on his face that matches his soft, somewhat sandpapery voice. 
"We've heard the preaching of this leader and that one, the 'War on Drugs' and 
'Just Say No,' but I don't think anyone listens to that kind of thing. Music, I 
think, has a far-reaching ability to touch the conscience of man." 
</P>
<P>
"Ashes to Ashes" was released a little more than a month ago and is being 
played steadily on the radio. (Sample plays the Celebrity Theater in Anaheim, 
Saturday, the Raymond Theatre in Pasadena, next Sunday, the Ventura Theatre in 
Ventura, Dec. 13, and the Hop in Riverside, Dec. 15.) 
</P>
<P>
The topic of decline in the black community had been on Sample's mind for a 
number of years. "It would come up as I'd remember growing up in Houston under 
the segregation system and going to a rough, rough school (Phillis Wheatley 
High School, named after the American Negro poet)," he says, his face somber 
and sad at the memory. 
</P>
<P>
"It was rough place," he goes on, smoking a cigarette. "Forty percent of my 
friends from then are either in jail or they're dead. Then, more recently, my 
nephew, my sister's son, was a victim of a drive-by shooting in Houston. He was 
shot four times but not killed." 
</P>
<P>
All during the writing of "Ashes to Ashes," which took place from the summer of 
1989 to this past May, one question kept arising for Sample: "What are the 
descendants of the American slave doing today? 
</P>
<P>
"The answer is they are destroying themselves," he says in tender tones that 
give his remark added impact. 
</P>
<P>
"And the truth is, no one is going to save us, no one is going to save this 
country; we have to save ourselves," he goes on. "It has to come from within. 
So when I see people pulling together, saying they want their neighborhoods 
back, to me that means people are determined to do something about this 
crisis." 
</P>
<P>
As bad as Sample says things may be for blacks, he was determined to make his 
theme up -- not down -- beat. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to write a horror story, either, so the thrust of my concept is 
hope and promise," he says. "People have to learn how to love again." 
</P>
<P>
The album is typical of Sample's contemporary jazz/R&amp;B/pop style, with 
tunes like "The Road Less Traveled," "Born in Trouble" and "Phoenix" bearing 
brief, catchy melodies enhanced by use of space, and solid rhythmic 
underpinings from bass, drums and added instruments. As the tunes are set up 
with few harmonic complexities, another Sample trademark, the music on "Ashes 
to Ashes" serves equally well as foreground or background listening. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping the tunes on a project like "Ashes to Ashes" fresh and different from 
those on past solo efforts is no simple task, Sample says. 
</P>
<P>
"If I sit down and think about what I'm doing, then I'll write music that's 
similar to what I've done before. It'll be a Joe Sample cliche, and I've got 
those," he says smiling and smoking his cigarette. "But if I just go with the 
wonderful moments where things are coming through me, if I am ready and 
fine-tuned, I will know how to communicate to myself what I'm feeling 
musically." 
</P>
<P>
Sample began his professional career as a teen-ager in Houston and was soon a 
part of a band with trombonist Wayne Henderson, tenor saxophonist Wilton Felder 
and drummer Stix Hooper that was known variously as the Swingsters and the 
Modern Jazz Sextet. "Then when we moved to Los Angeles in 1958, we became 'The 
Nighthawks,' a dance band," Sample recalls. Soon thereafter the band changed 
its name to the Jazz Crusaders and achieved fame with its particularly punchy 
brand of hard bop tinged with soul. 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, the band changed its name to the Crusaders and embarked on a more 
contemporary style that contained healthy chunks of R&amp;B and blues. In the 
ensuing years, both Henderson and Hooper have left the aggregation, and though 
Felder and Sample are mostly solo artists these days, they still occasionally 
appear under the group's banner. 
</P>
<P>
Sample has come through a tough six-year fight with Epstein-Barr Syndrome -- "I 
felt like I had the flu every day for six years," he says -- and some severe 
financial problems. A bad investment cost him more than $300,000 and he had to 
pay a healthy sum to buy Hooper's share of the Crusaders. 
</P>
<P>
"I see this as a time of great personal growth," he says. "I see myself as a 
product of the Afro-American experience in the mid-to-late 20th Century and I 
feel now, with the release of 'Ashes to Ashes,' that I have only started."

"There are a lot of things that have become sort of myths with the Cocteau 
Twins," said Simon Raymonde, one third of the myth-provoking band. Among the 
misconceptions he cited: "We don't like doing gigs, we don't like doing 
interviews, we're miserable, we're mysterious. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He was talking about the London-based trio's image as reclusive aesthetes who 
concoct ethereal sounds behind veils of secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
But Raymonde says it's not so. 
</P>
<P>
"Our problem, I guess, is that we don't hide what's going on," said the London 
native recently, sitting with his band-mates Robin Guthrie and Elizabeth Fraser 
in a West Hollywood Hotel. "If it's a bad interview, we don'tpretend to be 
really nice. . . . If we do a gig and Liz gets upset or breaks down or 
something, then it's a disaster and we're a moody bunch of (jerks). It's only 
because we're not actors." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the people behind the mystique are an agreeable Englishman and a 
sweet, down-to-earth Scottish couple with a year-old baby. 
</P>
<P>
Agreeable and sweet, but not especially eager to unravel their musical 
tapestry. "Essentially we don't have anything to say at all about our music," 
group leader Guthrie summarized. "It's meant to be listened to." 
</P>
<P>
The Cocteau Twins are getting listened to. Eight years after embarking on the 
British independent-music scene, they're on the big-league Capitol Records in 
the United States. Their first tour in five years, in conjunction with the new 
"Heaven or Las Vegas" album, will include dates at the Wiltern Theatre on 
Thursday and Friday, and another at the Hollywood Palladium on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Guthrie and Raymonde layer the lush, shimmering textures and animate them with 
a gentle pulse, but it's Fraser's singing that really inspires the worship 
among the group's unusually devoted fans. Her strings of syllables -- often 
unidentifiable as words -- convey a radiant joy as they defy interpretation, 
which of course challenges listeners to read great meaning into them. 
</P>
<P>
"People tend to put too much focus on the lyrics," Fraser protested. "It's not 
the be-all and end-all of our songs." 
</P>
<P>
Added Guthrie, "The lyrics tend to fascinate people, but for me, when I listen 
to a record I don't always latch on to the lyrics. I listen to the whole thing 
and it may be five or six days before I even realize what the song's about."

RECORD RACK: *** VAN MORRISON "ENLIGHTENMENT" MERCURY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It takes Morrison's most intense singing in years, and a return to his bedrock 
of vintage soul and R&amp;B, to rescue many of the songs here. The record is 
full of spontaneous interjections and exhortations, and the long fade-outs have 
an immediacy and life that's rare on mainstream records these days. 
</P>
<P>
"Enlightenment's" intriguing subtext is its focus on roots. The lyrics are 
often couched as reminiscences, the R&amp;B sound recalls Morrison's formative 
days, and he even quotes some of his own early lyrics: "Baby please don't go" 
(from his days with the group Them), and "down by the viaducts of my dream" 
from his classic solo debut, "Astral Weeks." 
</P>
<P>
But the main text comes up short. The spiritual soulster's reverie on a serene 
paradise, his latest visit to Celtic heaven, his surrender to a higher force, 
his love songs . . . all are over-familiar or underdeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
The great exception is "In the Days Before Rock 'n' Roll," a prime piece of 
Morrison bravado and eccentricity. Irish poet Paul Durcan barks an unschooled, 
strangely cadenced narration (at one point he even come in a bar early, in the 
spirit of the Kingsmen's famous muff in "Louie Louie"), and Morrison captures a 
fullness of emotion in his detailed remembrance of his youth. 
</P>
<P>
If you turn the volume way up after it ends, you can hear Durcan say, "You 
certainly got a lot of beautiful things in there, Van." He got that right.

** 1/2 Mary-Chapin Carpenter, "Shooting Straight in the Dark," Columbia. 
Carpenter's third album harks back a bit to the lengthy, finely detailed 
character studies of her debut while retaining the greater pop accessibility 
that made her second such a leap forward, commercially and artistically. 
</P>
<P>
Too often she limits herself to straight reportage in her missives from the 
battlefields of love and life; you wish she'd delve more into analysis and 
commentary. But at least you always get the sense there's a lively, probing 
mind at work. Carpenter is interviewed on Page 67. RANDY LEWIS

ON THE TOWN: The Ringling Sisters (whose delightful "60-Watt Reality" album is 
just out) are holding their fifth annual Holiday Fund-Raiser for Needy Children 
Dec. 11 at the Roxy. Performers will include local faves Mary's Danish, the 
Havalinas, Steve Wynn, Henry Rollins, the Brothers Figaro and the Sisters 
themselves, with all proceeds going to an area orphanage. . . . Chris Poland 
(Megadeth's original guitarist) will be at the Whisky Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But we're wondering -- is he promoting his new Enigma album, "Return to 
Metalopolis," or is he holding a showcase for A&amp;R scouts interested in 
signing him if Enigma folds this month? . . . And a group of local actors and 
musicians (all contributors to the recent "Hollyword" compilation) will pay 
tribute to John Hammond, the late A&amp;R exec extraordinaire, this Friday in 
"12x12," a night of music and spoken-word performances at the Highland Grounds. 
(Dec. 15 would've been Hammond's 80th birthday.) All proceeds from the show, 
which features 12 artists, including Linda Albertano, Harry E. Northup, Louie 
Lista and Danny (Shredder) Weizmann, will go to the John Hammond Fund at the 
Smithsonian Institution, which is preparing a concert series celebrating 
American roots music.

AND FINALLY: It's just been one embarrassment after another for NARAS, the 
industry organization whose voters gave the Best New Artist Grammy of 1989 to 
Milli Vanilli, pop's now- disgraced lip-syncing cover boys. The latest? NARAS's 
1990 Grammy eligibility ballot, which went in the mail Tuesday to NARAS voters 
around the country, still lists Milli Vanilli as candidates for Album of the 
Year, Record of the Year, Best Pop Performance by a Group or Duo and Song of 
the Year. 
</P>
<P>
The ballots may have been printed before the MV scandal. But NARAS execs made 
room for a cover letter noting that several categories listed inside had been 
omitted -- why couldn't they have reminded voters that MV were no longer 
eligible for another award? As one longtime NARAS member put it: "Geez, what a 
foul-up! Just when you thought we couldn't look any worse. You'd think we'd 
want to bend over backwards to fix this and put it behind us." . . . And nope 
-- that's not a Donald Trump impersonator with Precious Metal. The fading 
financial wiz is now a video star, courtesy of the all-gal heavy-metal band, 
who cast him as "Mr. Big Stuff," the (dare we say) villain of their current 
single.

POP EYE: MADONNA VIDEO WILL STEAM UP STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They don't call her the Material Girl for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Just hours after learning that MTV had refused to air her new "Justify My Love" 
video, Madonna and her record label, Warner Bros. Records, were following the 
classic marketing maxim: If you have a lemon, make lemonade. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than submit the steamy clip to other TV outlets, the Madonna/Warners 
team has decided to take advantage of the budding controversy by selling the 
video. Warners/Reprise Video will release the "Justify My Love" clip Dec. 18, 
making it the first video single ever marketed as a home video. A Warners 
spokesman said that the label will probably price it at $9.98. 
</P>
<P>
Industry cynics, who have seen Madonna cleverly court controversy in the past, 
wonder if the shrewd pop seductress had planned to sell her clip all along, 
hoping that sales would be fueled by media coverage of the MTV ban. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, says Warners publicity chief Bob Merlis."The plan to sell the clip only 
came about after we learned MTV wouldn't program the video." Speaking through a 
Warners spokeswoman, Madonna would only say: "This is my interpretation of my 
song. I think it's a very romantic video and I felt I was exercising my freedom 
of speech and expression." 
</P>
<P>
The flap came at a particularly awkward time for MTV, which had planned to 
debut the new clip during its much-ballyhooed Madonna-thon this weekend. 
Officially, all MTV would say was: "We respect Madonna's work and think she 
makes great videos. But this one is not for us." 
</P>
<P>
MTV execs said that the clip was rejected by its standards committee, which 
previews all new videos -- and customarily requests artists to edit or trim 
objectionable scenes. However the committee apparently found the Madonna clip 
so provocative that no amount of editing would make it acceptable. "This 
decision went all the way to the top," said one staffer. "There was no way we 
could even edit this. I can't believe Madonna ever thought we could air it." 
</P>
<P>
What are we missing? Since Warners wouldn't send us the clip, Pop Eye talked to 
several insiders who had seen the video, which was directed by video wiz 
Jean-Baptiste Mondino (who did Madonna's "Open Your Heart" clip) and co-stars 
Tony Ward, Madonna's current paramour. 
</P>
<P>
The clip begins with a trench-coated Madonna entering a hotel hallway, carrying 
a suitcase. As she begins to writhe along with the song's rhythms, she is 
joined by her boyfriend, who begins smooching with her. They quickly retire to 
a nearby bedroom, where they make love (he's shirtless, she's clad only in a 
bra and panties) amid a series of racy fantasy scenes. After considerable 
footage featuring various erotic poses and apparent sex, the clip ends with 
Madonna, giggling with pleasure, fleeing the hotel, suitcase in hand. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very sexually ambiguous video," one observer said. "You see women you 
think are men, women with painted-on mustaches. You see Madonna making love 
with her boyfriend and then kissing another woman, while he watches them. There 
are orgy-type fantasy scenes, where you see people in S&amp;M-style clothing 
and a woman in suspenders with her breasts exposed. Some people will probably 
say it's really wild. I just got the feeling Madonna had been watching too many 
Zalman King movies." 
</P>
<P>
Will the video sell? "Madonna fans tend to want everything -- they'll 
definitely pay $10 for the new video, especially if it's controversial," said 
Tower Video store manager Jay Smith. "Right now she's very hot. We had about 
200 copies of her video collection and went right through the whole initial 
shipment."

THE WAY TO ACHIEVE REAL DEPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Sean Mitchell's Nov. 25 article, "Misery" director Rob Reiner says, "You 
can't know real depression until you've had great wealth." 
</P>
<P>
Did he try that line on the parking valet mentioned in the story, who might be 
relieved to know he's never been really depressed? 
</P>
<P>
May I suggest that Reiner get in his Mercedes or Porsche, drive down to 
South-Central Los Angeles, find a woman whose 6-year-old child has just been 
killed in a drive-by shooting and tell her how she's not experiencing "real, 
abject depression" because she isn't rich yet. He might just learn what the 
title of his new movie really means.

THE PERFORMANCE ART OF JOHN FLECK: WORDS FROM THE ARTIST AND ONE OF HIS 
CRITICS; 
</P>
<P>
BELOW IS A LETTER FROM PERFORMANCE ARTIST AND ACTOR JOHN FLECK, THE SUBJECT OF 
A NOV. 18 ARTICLE BY JAN BRESLAUER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the quotes from critic-director Charles Marowitz in Breslauer's 
article, I am curious whether Marowitz actually saw "Blessed Are All the Little 
Fishes." My work deals with being human. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps what has caused trouble for some is that I see sexuality, and its many 
variances, as part of this experience. 
</P>
<P>
I know the work I've done has reached a wide audience, because I discuss 
religious issues, masculine/feminine behavior, dysfunctional families, 
addiction, environmental issues, politics, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Marowitz is incorrect in his assumption that my performance is "circumscribed 
within gay experience." Marowitz has chosen to fixate on the word gay, 
mentioning it six times. I find it queer that the monologue he refers to never 
once uses the word. 
</P>
<P>
I am fed up with this labeling of my work. Marowitz is labeling rather than 
being aware of his own emotional reactions to difficult material. (This is the 
kind of logic that perpetuates stereotypes -- and, for that matter, fuels the 
NEA controversy.) 
</P>
<P>
The rise in fundamentalist thought points to people searching for simple 
answers. I don't propose to give them. Marowitz does the disservice of limiting 
my audience by his inability to deal with complex issues.

THE HUGHES VISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christopher Knight's Nov. 18 criticisms of Robert Hughes for his observations 
on TV's negative impact on mass culture are unfair ("The Bard of Art's 
Decline"). 
</P>
<P>
Hughes does not contend that television cannot serve as a conduit for great 
art; simply that in most cases it does not. 
</P>
<P>
That is because we do not as a culture demand that it does. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who thinks that mass culture has not been seriously degraded in the last 
30 years must have actually enjoyed the recent political campaigns conducted on 
the TV sets of America. Every day we see the results of a culture that values 
promotion over talent, marketing over inspiration, image over content. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, we all are enmeshed in this murky web, Hughes included. But he is the only 
art critic with the vision and values to cut through the murk.

Re Daniel Cerone's Nov. 18 article about film adaptations of Stephen King's 
writings: Why is it when a great novel is made into a mediocre movie the author 
is ultimately blamed?

If you loved "Christine" or "It" you cannot assume that the screen versions 
will be equivalent experiences. It is the filmmakers' responsibility to produce 
a meritorious adaptation.

PRIVATE LIVES: THE ART OF THE DEAL; 
</P>

NO ONE WANTS TO BE A SUCKER WHEN IT COMES TO BARGAINING 
</P>

<P>
HOW MANY WORDS do you want to read today -- 200, 300? This column is supposed 
to be 850 words. But let's make a deal. 
</P>
<P>
Don't want to bargain? Neither do I. Yet, lately it seems as if the world has 
become a big bazaar. Maybe it's the recession, but price tags everywhere have 
come unglued. On Main Street in Santa Monica, where I sometimes shop, it used 
to be that I'd pick up an item for a closer look and a supercilious clerk would 
say, "$500," and I'd put it down. Now as soon as something catches my eye, the 
supercilious clerk chirps, "I can give it to you a little cheaper." 
</P>
<P>
Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against lower prices. I just don't like to 
haggle. Once a price starts fluctuating, I know I can't win. Someone -- anyone! 
-- is bound to get a better deal. And what fun is buying something for $300 
that used to be $500 when tomorrow it's going to be $160? 
</P>
<P>
Lots of fun for some people. "I like to bargain better than I like sex," says 
my sister-in-law, Robbie. "When I get a good deal, it makes my whole week." 
What's a good deal? "A 75%-off sale -- that's a bargain. Ten cents on the 
dollar -- that's a bargain. Of course, then I say, 'I love it, but can you do a 
little better on the price?' " 
</P>
<P>
I wouldn't have the nerve. I'm never sure when dickering is appropriate. It 
used to be something you did only on vacation. If I go to a picturesque stall 
in a foreign land and an older woman sitting behind a pile of straw hats 
demands 2,000 pesos or won or some other oversized currency that has a guy with 
a mustache on it, then I know I'm supposed to say, "1,500." But now people 
dicker everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I was behind this woman in the checkout line at the supermarket," my 
grandmother says, "and the cashier tells her, 'That will be $168.42.' And this 
woman says, 'I'll give you $100.' " She was up to $125 when Grandma left the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, sometimes you have to bargain just to stay even, like when you're 
trying to get any five rooms of carpet cleaned for the coupon price of $24.95 
while an abusive representative keeps warning you that the steam cleaning is 
absolutely useless without the color brighteners, Teflon coating and 
preconditioning (none of which are included). 
</P>
<P>
"There's always an angle," my brother, Bobby, says. "That's the root of all 
bargains -- the unknown. Like I bought a $400 suit for $225. I thought I got a 
great price, and then they clobbered me on alterations. Such a deal. Nobody 
could have walked out with that suit unless he was 6-11 and didn't want 
finished bottoms." 
</P>
<P>
And to think I called my brother for some bargaining tips. I wanted a wall 
built in my yard and had been taking bids. My lowest bidder, a contractor from 
Tonga, the Friendly Islands, measured and said his price was $1,000, "but for 
you, $950." I didn't know what to say. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell him you'll give him $500," Bobby advised. "If you want a good price, 
you've got to be ridiculous." I couldn't be that ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
My husband agreed that I had to negotiate. "I don't think they have a word for 
fixed prices in the Friendly Islands," Duke said. "Tell him $800, and he'll 
settle for $850." And he did. But why couldn't he just ask for that? "Because 
then he thinks people will feel cheated if they don't get it for $700," Duke 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody wants to feel like a sucker. And I suppose that a lot of folks would 
look at my nice new wall and fret that they could have gotten it for less. Not 
me. I have this principle about bargaining called the Mexican Blouse Theory. It 
goes like this: You're at a booth in Tijuana. You see an embroidered peasant 
blouse that costs $25. You rant and rave for 45 minutes until the senora agrees 
to part with it for $3. But ask yourself: Do you really want a $3 blouse? 
</P>
<P>
"Do I really want another brass Aztec calendar?" says my friend Doug. "No, but 
if I can get it for $5, what the heck?" He sees bargaining as a competitive 
sport at which he excels. "It has all the advantages of exercise. Your heart 
gets pumping. You raise your voice. You pace, you pound, you wag fingers." 
</P>
<P>
That is not my idea of a pleasant shopping experience. And neither is this: 
"You must be willing to walk away," Doug says. "It's the basic rule of 
bargaining. If you can walk away, you can't lose." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, my husband and I were in Hong Kong, home of the adjustable price 
tag. I fell in love with an adorable pair of shoes. I was ready to buy them, 
but then Duke, who likes bargaining in a foreign country because it's one of 
the few social interactions possible when you know only 20 words of the 
language, decided to get me a better price. I watched in horror as he and the 
salesman bickered over $30 HK. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's go," Duke said, leading me away from my beautiful shoes. "It's an act," 
he whispered. Luckily for him, the salesman ran after us and met our price. 
</P>
<P>
Then the most incredible thing happened. I'd be happy to tell you about it. 
</P>
<P>
Just make me an offer.

PUZZLE PRAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a long overdue expression of appreciation for your Puzzler page and 
those wonderful puzzlers, Barry Tunick and Sylvia Bursztyn. 
</P>
<P>
Their feel for language, their clever humor, their avoidance of a dull, 
lumbering vocabulary of crossword-dictionary words and the precision of their 
definitions are superb. 
</P>
<P>
During a period of exile deep in the heart of a large Southwestern city, which 
shall be nameless (I believe it was named after a long-running TV series), I 
was unable to find puzzles even approaching the caliber of T &amp; B's little 
gems, just one more reason for falling prostrate and kissing the ground on my 
return to Los Angeles Times country. 
</P>
<P>
Please don't ever let them go.

THE REAL INDIANA JONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As interesting and informative as was Weisman's article on Arthur Demarest's 
excavations of the Mayan civilization, one could wish for less hyperbole. 
</P>
<P>
We may have underestimated the glories of native American peoples, but let us 
not now be guilty of this kind of exaggeration: "Their monumental architecture, 
as well as their painting, astronomy, mathematics and literature, humbled the 
achievements of their contemporaries in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
While it is true that most of us are unaware of how impressive were the Mayan 
accomplishments in these areas, the statement is patently false in all areas 
except possibly astronomy. There is nothing among the Mayan ruins to indicate 
an architecture that equaled the accomplishments of Imperial Rome. Nor do the 
remains of Mayan paintings equal the combined accomplishments of Egypt, Greece, 
Rome and the Byzantine world as we know them. As for literature, get serious! I 
trust this wild hypothesizing originates with your author and not with 
professor Demarest.

HARRY SHEARER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Harry Shearer's "Bright Lights, Little City" (Sept. 30): Yes, we in 
Los Angeles do miss out on "the opportunity to socialize with people (we) 
didn't invite" -- that is precisely the point. Not only does the tangible mass 
of walls and gates separate us from the street. Consider, for example, the 
restoration of our wonderful historic neighborhoods to period splendor (an 
effort admittedly of great cultural value and an economic upper to boot). But 
the result is a '90s version of the Native American tragedy -- L.A.'s 
ethno-poor are relentlessly forced down and eastward by the tide of private 
dollars until finally their presence in their own neighborhoods prompts 
murmurings of "dangerous outsiders." 
</P>
<P>
Stalking Los Angeles on this "revivified" urban curb does often seem 
uncontrived; Shearer's perception of Melrose Avenue as an organically grown 
hangout proves just how real an eclectic Disneyland can be. It is these 
gentrified areas that evolve into "our best gathering places" and sate our 
hankering for -- what did he call it? -- planned spontaneity. Not only do our 
trendoids now have somewhere to go, but we go there too, and bump into them, 
feigning the white-hot urban encounter. After all, these are strangers. Doesn't 
that count? 
</P>
<P>
Nope, sorry -- it's Memorex, altered in the packaging. A city experience is by 
nature utterly unmanageable, and there is no chance that one can imagine one 
belongs. Me, I need to gnaw the foods of the urban reservation when I eat at 
the human cafeteria. I need to hear language I can't understand, whether it's 
English or not; I need to be jostled by poverty, see it waving its arms and 
legs; I need to walk with a threat approaching; I need to be made 
uncomfortable. Yes, it's sometimes tragic; but it's the best fun I have, and it 
is never, thank God, decadent. In the Real L.A., I have uncovered this curious 
and liberating phenomenon -- there are no "dangerous outsiders." 
</P>
<P>
We're out here, Harry. There's a city out here, and some of us know where it 
is.

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: MISSED MANNERS; 
</P>
<P>
AN AUTHOR DECRIES THE RUDE, CRUDE AND UNETHICAL CONDUCT OF THE ME GENERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WE OFTEN HEAR these days that our youth are a generation without ethics. They 
are called The Me Generation, or The Gimme Generation, and are said to care 
only for consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent report, "The Ethics of American Youth," the Josephson Institute for 
the Advancement of Ethics concluded that "today's 18-30 generation is less 
anchored in bedrock ethical values than any other." 
</P>
<P>
It calls them "IDIs" -- since their implicit assumption is, "I deserve it." It 
warns that IDIs are "more selfish and materialistic than their predecessors and 
demonstrate a greater willingness to abandon traditional ethical restraints in 
the pursuit of success or comfort. IDIs cheat and lie more easily than their 
predecessors, and they are more apt to engage in violent and other socially 
detrimental irresponsible conduct." 
</P>
<P>
It warns that as this group gains authority and power, its effect could be 
catastrophic. "Whether they serve as bus drivers, building inspectors, airline 
mechanics, bankers, surgeons or politicians, their ethical shortcomings will 
certainly cause significant harm . . . . It is inevitable that we will have a 
decade of scandals and tragedies caused by unscrupulous me-first conduct." 
</P>
<P>
Though Josephson finds this generation worse than any of its predecessors, I 
suspect that the younger generation has always given its elders cause for 
alarm. 
</P>
<P>
In the Fourth Century, the Roman emperor Julian deplored the youth of his time, 
who mocked the original Cynics by wearing beards and begging. "But where the 
original Cynics despised wealth, sought virtue, questioned all things in order 
to find what was true," he wrote, "these imitators mock all things, including 
the true, using the mask of philosophy to disguise license and 
irresponsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Phyllis Poper of Long Beach has sent me a leaflet called "The 
Boy and His Job," by Dr. Frank Crane, which recently was given to her by her 
96-year-old father. It had been given to him when he started on his first job. 
</P>
<P>
It is full of the homilies by which the heroes of Horatio Alger Jr. made their 
way up in the world, from office boy to chairman of the board. 
</P>
<P>
"If you work for a railroad," it says, "act as if whatever causes loss to the 
railroad causes loss to you. Be as careful of the property as if you owned it. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are a clerk in a store, get the thought in your mind that it is your 
store, and be as anxious as the proprietor to keep things neat, to attract 
customers, and to avoid losses. 
</P>
<P>
"When you work for a man, you do not work for wages. If your eye is only on 
your pay, you are a second-class worker. You will certainly slight your work, 
and your employer will get rid of you as soon as he can . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Crane was not unaware that some employers could be selfish brutes. 
</P>
<P>
"If your employer is an unjust and selfish person, and takes advantage of you, 
overworks you, does not appreciate what you do, complains and never says an 
encouraging word, right there is where you are to show the stuff you are made 
of. Stick to your principle. Don't be like him. Keep on doing the best you can 
for him. When you cannot stand it any longer -- quit. But never take a man's 
money and slight his work." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Crane insisted on devotion to the American work ethic: "If you are to sweep 
the store, make it as tidy as a particular women's parlor. If you are to tie 
bundles, learn to make them look as though they had been done up by machinery. 
Nobody wants a boy who is habitually negligent, slip-shod and careless in his 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Crane also emphasized what we would now call old-fashioned manners: 
"Whenever you meet a woman you know, take off your hat, whether it is the boss' 
wife or a washwoman. Whenever a woman enters the room where you are, get up 
from your chair, whether it is a typewriting girl or a princess . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Of course today there are no such things as typewriting girls, and women 
themselves discourage chivalry, so young men are not likely to rise from their 
chairs even when a princess enters a room. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Crane insisted on punctuality: "Be punctual. Be just a little better than 
punctual . . . . Start always sooner than is necessary, and allow time for 
mishaps." 
</P>
<P>
I imagine that Andrew Carnegie followed some such code as Dr. Crane's when he 
started out as a telegraph messenger, back in the 19th Century. And of course 
he became one of the nation's richest industrialists and philanthropists, 
building and endowing hundreds of public libraries. 
</P>
<P>
As a young man I was given to many of Dr. Crane's precepts, and to this day I 
am almost always on time, and I rise from my chair when a woman enters the room 
-- even if she's only a typewriting girl.

</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARGY ROCHLIN, Margy Rochlin is a contributing editor of this magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELEN GURLEY BROWN is talking about Judith Krantz, who used to write for 
Cosmopolitan magazine and who also is a close friend. In her famous urgent 
whisper, Brown says, "There are people who say to Judy, 'Why don't you write 
something good? Something literary? Something you can be proud of?' Well, I'd 
like to put a bullet through those people's heads." 
</P>
<P>
Brown stops, carefully weighing the savageness of her statement. "No," she 
reconsiders. "First I'd like to pull out their fingernails, one by one, then 
put a bullet through their heads. Because they're just" -- she searches for the 
right invective -- "pretentious jerks." 
</P>
<P>
LEAVE IT TO her friends to come up with fantasies of violent retribution. 
Judith Krantz prefers to be nice. Nice, as in ignoring the greasy lake that 
forms on her plate when the waiter at Le Dome spills San Pellegrino water onto 
her veal-and-chicken boudin. Nice, as in accepting what people think about 
blockbuster novels: that anyone can write one given a string of lunch breaks 
and low enough standards. 
</P>
<P>
So when she's quizzed about loftier aspirations -- which "happens so often that 
I don't even get insulted" -- Krantz smiles and replies, "I write the best 
books that I know how. I can't write any better than this." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, privately, the Wellesley graduate tosses her hands into the air and 
laughs. "You know, people think that because I had a good education, I'm not 
writing on the level that I should. They think I'm harboring some slim little 
intellectual volume, that I am really Isaac Bashevis Singer in disguise." 
</P>
<P>
Back in her Bel-Air home, 62-year-old Krantz looks around her office. It's a 
padded cell, really. The walls are soundproof, cushioned and upholstered in a 
leaf-green-and-orange floral fabric that sinks in at the poke of a fingertip. 
This is the room where, when she is composing one of her 500-plus-page sagas 
full of ka-boom! sex and frenzied consumerism, she spends six and a half hours 
a day, five days a week, with the exception of Wednesday afternoons. (For the 
past 19 years, she's dedicated part of one day every week to getting her beige 
pouf done at Aida Grey in Beverly Hills.) She works in an old silk blouse and 
sweat pants, 
</P>
<P>
wearing layers of sweaters that she'll shed throughout the day -- when things 
are going well, Krantz's body temperature sizzles. For nine solid months, the 
only other breaks in her workday come when she nibbles on her spartan lunch of 
iced tea and a chicken salad sandwich, or speaks with her blond assistant, 
Edwina Lloyd, or accepts phone calls from her husband, television producer 
Steve Krantz. 
</P>
<P>
Krantz gives the tiniest of sighs and contemplates her brand-new red tennis 
shoes, so small they should be bronzed. "What all this indicates to me is that 
people think what I'm writing is fun, that they really don't understand how 
hard 'fun' is to write," she says, her voice rising slightly. "It's hard to 
entertain people and make a story move just like that." 
</P>
<P>
She knows that her critics have no idea what it takes, how much preparation is 
required before she taps out a single sentence on her Macintosh Plus computer. 
They don't care about how much interviewing and research go into building the 
novels' heavily populated worlds. If few of Krantz's theatrically romantic 
figures could exist in real life, she nonetheless tries to construct for them 
an accurate reality. Inside the cabinets of her wood worktable, she's stored 
stacks of brown spiral binders, the end result of investigations so thorough 
that she'll end up using "only 1% of the information" she's collected. Just as 
in the days when she was a journalist, she'll call up experts out of the blue 
and pick their brains or set off on a fact-finding mission in her 
chauffeur-driven limousine. When Red Appleton, a 40ish-but-still-beautiful 
fashion model, goes to Louis Vuitton at South Coast Plaza to check out an 
18-karat-gold Gae Aulenti fountain pen for Mike Kilkullen, her 
60ish-but-still-virile fiance, Krantz herself has visited the place and priced 
the thing. 
</P>
<P>
Red and Mike are central characters in "Dazzle," Krantz's just-published book, 
which, if all things go as anticipated, will rise dreamily to the top of the 
bestseller lists. That's what "Scruples," "Princess Daisy," "Mistral's 
Daughter" and "I'll Take Manhattan" did in 1978, 1980, 1983 and 1986, 
respectively. Only one Krantz book in 12 years -- "Till We Meet Again," in 1988 
-- stuck at No. 2. All told, 60 million copies of her books (paperback and 
hardcover) have sold worldwide, in 30 languages. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Krantz has displayed a knack for ensuring such sales. Perhaps 
this is because, as she is fond of saying, she is "an advertising man's 
daughter." She has extremely strict ideas regarding the promotion and marketing 
of her books. In fact, says Crown Publishing Group executive vice president 
Michelle Sidrane: "We consider her a partner in that process." 
</P>
<P>
Krantz knows her readers' turn-offs and turn-ons. When it comes time to approve 
the dust-jacket copy, Krantz will rewrite it herself if it doesn't suit her. 
She altered the "Dazzle" blurb, for example, so that it focused on the leading 
lady, Jazz Kilkullen: "a captivating, compelling, complex creature who could 
only exist in the 1990s . . . an electric hussy" who "is potent, determined and 
fierce as she fights for those she loves." Even the retouching of Krantz's 
publicity photographs falls within her domain: She makes sure that not too many 
age lines are airbrushed out because "that way, you look real but not plastic." 
</P>
<P>
These extra-credit activities perhaps inspired "The Packaging of Judith 
Krantz," which appeared in the New York Times Magazine in 1980. It was this 
article, Krantz contends, that helped establish her reputation as nothing more 
than a cleverly hyped commodity: "Publishing's answer to, I don't know . . . 
Debbie Reynolds or something." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the lengthy treatise covered Krantz's participation in the marketing of 
her novels. The rest fastidiously documented the effect that her 
record-breaking $3,208,875 fee for the paperback rights to "Princess Daisy" had 
within the publishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most incendiary quotations in the New York Times piece came from 
Roger W. Straus Jr., president of the prestigious publishing house Farrar, 
Straus &amp; Giroux, who called Krantz's giant paycheck "bad for publishers and 
bad for writers; bad for the whole publishing environment." 
</P>
<P>
Straus was one of many who were critical of Krantz and her windfall. "It was 
unbelievable," says Krantz. "People acted as if I had actually put a gun to 
someone's head, like Bonnie and Clyde, and said, 'Your money or your life.' " 
So vitriolic was the response that she began to theorize about the other forces 
that might have caused such a reaction. "Maybe," went one hypothesis, "the idea 
of a woman making that much money was too outrageous." Or was it her subject 
matter? "I had written about the fashion industry," Krantz postulated, "and 
even though it is one of the biggest industries in the United States, everyone 
takes it for granted." Two years passed before she stopped feeling guilty about 
her landmark deal, stopped feeling as if she'd been "run over by a truck." 
</P>
<P>
In Krantz's tales, one is always assured of both a happy ending and villains 
who, in coming to appreciate the heroine's finer qualities, apologize for the 
wickedness of their words and deeds. A decade later, Roger Straus, in his own 
way, almost follows this character arc. Almost. Krantz's writing, he concludes, 
"may be crap, which from a literary standpoint it certainly is," but now he 
feels she has evolved into a supportive component of the publishing industry. 
"Somebody who walks in to buy a Judith Krantz," he explains, "might stumble 
across a good book that they might buy for their aging uncle or for their 
bright son." 
</P>
<P>
But when Krantz is asked to envision a chance encounter with Straus, her script 
includes long-awaited, if subtle, revenge. "I would be really nice to him," she 
says, clapping her hands together merrily. "I would be so warm and friendly 
that it'd make him worry that he'd been so mean to me." 
</P>
<P>
ON A HOT AFTERNOON in July, the only thing troubling Krantz is finishing the 
final corrections on the "Dazzle" galleys. The proofs bear her spidery red-ink 
notations, evidence of Krantz's ability to pick up on typos and grammatical 
errors as well as anything that is not perfectly Krantzian. "Look here," she 
says, pointing to a line. "They wanted to lower-case 'traffic school,' but I 
insisted on capital letters. I told them, 'You don't lowercase anything so 
horrendous.' " 
</P>
<P>
And this is just one of the editorial battles in which, as she says, she will 
always be "an absolute guaranteed winner." Before Krantz, Crown Publishers Inc. 
was a house almost totally bereft of authors who appealed to the female 
demographic. Small wonder that Crown now places a certain trust in Krantz's 
intuition about her own writing. 
</P>
<P>
Krantz's story proposals have shrunk from 40 pages to a brief two-sheet 
outline, no longer than an interoffice memo. And because she prefers that only 
her assistant and her husband view her works-in-progress, her weighty opuses 
arrive (usually before schedule, usually on a Friday) at her current 
co-publishers, Crown and Bantam Books, "as a happy surprise," says Betty 
Prashker, Krantz's Crown editor since 1981. And because "Judy is a self-editor 
and very much a perfectionist," her books appear in print almost exactly as she 
first submits them. 
</P>
<P>
This arrangement may be unusual, but it is hardly risky. In whatever way 
Krantz's latest manuscript might diverge from its predecessors, there is always 
the great certainty that the reader will find the kind of post-feminist, 
have-it-all heroine who has intense career ambitions, a shopping disorder, an 
unquenchable libido and a rather convoluted existence. In the ripe world of 
Jazz Kilkullen, the top celebrity photographer of "Dazzle," for example, there 
are two sinister half sisters, three dashing suitors and the potential for her 
to single-handedly save a portion of the Orange County coastline from Hong Kong 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
Krantz's style is characterized by its remarkable specificity. Krantz isn't one 
to accept any conventional notions about what does or does not warrant physical 
description. To picture Jazz's movie-star boyfriend, Sam Butler, for example, 
one is first alerted to the fact that he can't "disguise the absolute 
masculinity of his features, the strong, square jaw, the straight nose, the 
thick, almost flaxen blond hair, the resolute blue-beyond-blue eyes, the wide, 
determined mouth, all arranged in a way that would have left a crowd of 
Victorian maidens in a mass swoon. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
And then there is her flair for soft-core aerobisex. When Krantz's characters 
make love, the action seems to downshift into slow-motion. "If you're going to 
write a good erotic scene," Krantz says, "you have to go into details. I don't 
believe in thunder and lightning and fireworks exploding. I think people what 
to know what's happening." 
</P>
<P>
So when Jazz kisses Sam, for example, she doesn't just pucker up. She brings 
"her mouth down on him like a gift, gently, tenderly, with a steadily 
increasing pressure until she couldn't wait any longer to learn his mouth with 
the firm tip of her tongue." 
</P>
<P>
Few literary critics have taken to Krantz's rococo writing style. In "Till We 
Meet Again," "there is not an insight, a clever line, a hint of humor, a neat 
turn of phrase, a felicitous description," one of Krantz's typical notices 
goes. Not surprisingly, Krantz doesn't read her reviews ("What you don't know 
can't hurt you") and thinks that critics review her books unfairly. "They don't 
judge them for what they are -- a weekend read, entertainment," she says. Then 
she makes a joke: "My books are sent to that Japanese woman at the New York 
Times whose name I can never pronounce." Michiko Kakutani? "Right. Can you 
imagine? That's like sending an animal to the slaughterhouse." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the critical mudwash has hardly affected her book sales. She's not beyond 
invoking the rallying cry of the commercial novelist: "My fans don't care about 
reviews." But there is a more ironic explanation, too. British critic Clive 
James once wrote that Krantz has "the opposite of pictorial talent. The more 
details she piles on, the less clear things become." But crisp, lucid turns of 
phrase aren't what a trashy-book junkie is after. "We live in a culture where 
lots of women feel very empty," says feminist Madonne Minor, author of 
"Insatiable Appetites," which considers the phenomena of American bestsellers. 
"They feel that they haven't been nurtured, that they haven't been fed. And 
what they love is talk of material culture. They love talk of shopping sprees. 
They love detail. Repetitive romance novel reading is what fills up those empty 
fantasy spaces." 
</P>
<P>
A POLTERGEISThas taken up residence in Krantz's brown plastic beeper, the one 
she keeps by her plate to summon the maid. Sometimes she presses the button and 
nothing happens. On other occasions, it goes off by itself, calling upon the 
maid to serve no one in particular. Happily, on this afternoon, there is 
mechanical triumph: Krantz aims the device toward the kitchen and out comes the 
maid with lunch, a large china platter of cold-roasted chicken, slim green 
asparagus and a delicate white-rice salad. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to see how studiously Krantz choreographs a life full of elegance. 
Everything seems precisely thought out. Even her country garden, planted just 
outside her wide dining-room windows, is one that she collaborated on with 
landscape architect James Yoch to give the illusion of being in Provence. The 
occasional soaring golf ball, followed by enraged cursing, is, of course, a 
little out of place. But there is only so much choreography can do: Her 
two-story mansion sits directly behind the 17th hole of the links at the 
Bel-Air Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
The style in which Krantz lives, of course, is a lot like the style her 
characters at least aspire to. Footed crystal schnapps glasses and topiary are 
the mise en scene of Krantz's oeuvre. One can't help but wonder about her 
behavior as well. Take her female characters' frequent habit of tearing apart 
their closets for the outfit that will have a precise effect upon a particular 
person. How could one not speculate about how much time Krantz put into 
selecting her clothing today, in achieving that just-so jauntiness conveyed by 
her blue Chanel blazer, blue-and-white striped blouse and loosely knotted red 
dotted-swiss necktie? 
</P>
<P>
And given her early childhood, it's impossible not to understand why the 
poor-little-rich-girl theme is so common in her work. She was born in Manhattan 
on Jan. 9, 1928, on Christmas break during her mother's senior year in college. 
After having emigrated from Lithuania to the United States at the age of 4, 
Mary Brager spent her teen-age years working at a chocolate factory to support 
her family. It wasn't until after she married that she found time for education 
and, finally, a profession as a civil-rights lawyer. By then, she and her 
husband, Jack Tarcher, owner of a booming advertising agency, had taken up 
residence in a vast apartment on Central Park West, staffed by five servants, 
including a laundress. 
</P>
<P>
So wedded were her parents to their careers and to the night-life demands of 
their liberal political activism that perhaps in another era the Tarchers would 
have forgone a family. Instead, they relinquished much of the responsibility 
for their children's upbringing -- Krantz's sister, Mimi Brien, is a financial 
adviser, and her brother, Jeremy Tarcher, is a publisher -- to a succession of 
nannies and to their independent older daughter, Judith. "Judy would help me 
with my homework. She gave me tips for how to look best," Brien says. "She 
would intercede between me and my mother. It was less sisters. To me, Judy was 
Mommy." 
</P>
<P>
Their parents' legacy, according to Krantz, consists of a love of the written 
word, bestowed upon her by her self-educated father, and a fierce work ethic, 
the product of her mother's fears that her daughters would turn into "spoiled 
Marjorie Morningstar types." 
</P>
<P>
As a student at the exclusive Birch Wathen School in Manhattan, Krantz was the 
brightest, the scrawniest and the first to raise her hand. And, after skipping 
two grades, she would always be the youngest. Her classmates could have exiled 
her for any of those reasons, but she sealed her fate by being "the biggest, 
most impossible teacher's pet." 
</P>
<P>
"I was horrendously unpopular," she says. "I was always left out of the other 
girls' cabals. I was not invited to all the birthday parties. I was never part 
of the in group." Her mother, solely interested in her daughter's triumphs, 
never noticed that mention of friends was absent from little Judith's stories 
about school. 
</P>
<P>
Few things get an audience behind a character quicker than the struggle of 
personal transformation; Krantz frequently deploys this time-tested plot 
device, devoting long passages to her heroines' attempts to better themselves 
through low-calorie diets and sheer force of will. She attempted a similar 
transformation in high school, resolving to change her social status by taking 
summer jobs to pay for extra clothes. "I thought if I had the right kind of 
argyle sweater, the right kind of plaid skirt, that would make them like me. 
Nothing worked." Finally, her own metamorphosis, less a matter of will than 
circumstance, occurred just before her 17th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Upon entering Wellesley College in 1944, Krantz found herself surrounded by 
equally sharp students who were unaware that she should be treated as an 
outcast. At Wellesley, she was "Torchy." The suggestive nickname was a 
derivation of her maiden name, and maybe had something to do with her dorm 
record: 13 dates with 13 different boys on 13 consecutive nights. "I had every 
football weekend already spoken for up and down the 
Princeton-Harvard-Yale-Dartmouth circuit," she says, in the manner of one who 
still finds great reassurance in this achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after graduation, she found herself on the outside again. On a family 
vacation in Europe, her parents consented to leave her in France, in the care 
of a Parisian family, on the condition that she return home fluent in French. 
This time, if she felt apart from things, she had the language barrier to 
blame. But when she finally began to translate the household post-dinner table 
talk, Krantz discovered that the gossip was almost exclusively about sex. When 
she tried to join in, her landlady silenced her with a laugh. "They'd say, 'You 
have no right to an opinion; you're a virgin.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in her life that Krantz found the idea of chastity 
unsophisticated. One can envision the 5-foot-2-inch American in Paris absorbing 
all this frank talk of seduction and technique. Before leaving France, she saw 
to it that she obtained the experience necessary to be included in the coffee 
klatch. 
</P>
<P>
When she describes her return to Manhattan, it's easy to imagine Krantz as the 
madcap '50s bachelorette, throwing wild but inexpensive cocktail parties, 
making ends meet on her salary as an accessories editor at Good Housekeeping. 
But all that ended when former high school classmate Barbara Walters -- then 
producer of a public affairs show for the local NBC-TV station -- introduced 
her to the rangy, good-looking head of programming, Steve Krantz. "I fell in 
love with him the minute I saw him," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone questioning the Krantzes' closeness -- the pair married in 1954 -- has 
only to watch them in action. After almost four decades of marriage, deeply 
tanned Steve Krantz can shuffle into a room and his wife will clasp both his 
hands in hers then send him an air kiss and a positively kittenish love-look. 
In other words, the Krantzes still carry on flirtatiously: 
</P>
<P>
SHE: I was just saying that there wasn't any man in the world who could have 
tempted me out of the comfortable tradition of virginity . . . until I met you. 
(Pause.) And if you believe that, you'll believe anything. 
</P>
<P>
HE: I think Bruno Hauptmann could have tempted you out of your virginity. 
</P>
<P>
This is where the real-life story seems to diverge from the plot. It is not 
uncommon for people to find it difficult to connect her books' explicit 
passages with the reality of the diminutive and happily married Judith Krantz. 
"It's always been, 'Gee, you look so small and helpless. You look like a lady. 
Where did this sexual imagination come from? " says Krantz with an exasperated 
look. "And I don't see what my height or my having two kids or my being married 
for 36 years has to do with it. It's there." 
</P>
<P>
KRANTZ IS IN HER SPACIOUS master bathroom while a makeup artist in black 
leggings and a leopard-print shirt glues individual false eyelashes onto her 
eyelids. With an old Harry Langdon publicity shot as reference, Krantz bubbles 
over with exacting instructions about what it takes to make her camera-ready. 
Despite an occasional flash of self-consciousness, Krantz loves controlling her 
own press encounters. When the photographer peeks his head in the door, she 
directs him to a wall of five framed book jackets, where the words JUDITH 
KRANTZ grow larger and larger chronologically, until the titles start to seem 
like a vague afterthought. "It's like my 'Pilgrim's Progress,' " she says, then 
suggests he snap her photograph there. And though she comes across as 
unguarded, it occasionally appears that she is anything but. She ended one long 
interview with a review of her own performance: "I think I came off . . . very 
open." 
</P>
<P>
If Krantz has always fixated on the most microscopic of matters, it is because 
she believed that "the sale of every copy" hinges on her input. It was she who 
insisted, for example, that Francesco Scavullo take a $14,000 back-jacket 
photograph for "Scruples" because "I thought women should be able to turn the 
book over and see that Scavullo took the picture, that I really knew what (was 
glamorous)." The author remembers finding herself in the back room of a 
bookstore forlornly surrounded by towering stacks of books by Sidney Sheldon 
and Colleen McCullough. "Then, I thought to myself, 'Well, I'm here and they're 
not.' I knew that the store couldn't return the copies if they were signed," 
she says. "So I took off my shoes and signed all 350 copies of 'Scruples.' " 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, she would discover an even more effective promotional tool -- 
the television miniseries. A three-part, six-hour CBS version of "Scruples" was 
the second-highest-rated miniseries of 1980 ("Guyana: the Jim Jones Story," 
based on the Jonestown Massacre, held the top spot, but, as Krantz jokes, 
"that's only because it was four hours long and everybody was waiting to see 
them drink the Kool-Aid"). Like clockwork, about 24 months after each book was 
published, it has shown up as a TV extravaganza. In fact, the small-screen 
dramas have been so perfect an arena for Krantz's overblown characters and 
plots that they have become an integral part of the book sales process. They 
show up on television, which resuscitates the paperback, back on the stands 
with a new tie-in cover. 
</P>
<P>
The miniseries form also allows Krantz and her husband a chance to work 
together. Steve Krantz, who has developed such TV series as "Hazel" and 
produced feature films, among them "Fritz the Cat," served as producer on four 
televised translations of his wife's work (he was otherwise employed during 
"Scruples"). That Steve Krantz takes pride in this partnership's impeccable 
track record is clear. When asked, he will provide a list detailing not just 
titles and airdates but a precise breakdown of rating and share percentages. 
"Judith," he adds, "is the only author who has had all of her novels 
dramatized." 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of Krantz's bathroom is a chaise longue where she has deposited 
her publisher's missive outlining the upcoming promotional plans for "Dazzle" 
-- consumer contests, a billboard on Sunset Boulevard, an attempt to "dazzle" 
members of the trade and key reviewers (even Michiko Kakutani) -- with bound 
galleys wrapped in "dazzling" paper. Later, according to Wendy Klemick, Crown's 
former vice president of marketing, promotions and advertising will place 
back-lit "Dazzle" mini-billboards in malls throughout the country, assuring "65 
million gross impressions." 
</P>
<P>
Krantz no longer has to crisscross the globe to flack her latest novel. Now 
technology has rendered the exhausting book tours unnecessary; here in Los 
Angeles, she'll beam off 45 different interviews via satellite. 
</P>
<P>
On television and radio, she's always been a natural. She comes off much as she 
does in real life -- energetic, quick-witted, self-deprecating. Nice. But this 
public persona is not entirely without calculation. "What I've learned is that 
it's a better idea to smile than not. When you're smiling, you don't seem 
disturbed by what the person's asking you. When people watch television, they 
react to about 80% of what they see and 20% of what they hear. So if you smile, 
you will be perceived as a fairly agreeable person." If one brings up such 
self-promotional savvy one time too often, though, a genuine look of misery 
crosses her face. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm probably a little oversensitive," Krantz admits. She pauses for a moment. 
"No one ever bothers to ask me, 'What is the work that goes into your writing?' 
" she says finally. "All they want to know about is the promotion. Like 'How do 
you manipulate people into reading your books?' Well, you don't manipulate 
people; you let them know. If people were a bit more thoughtful, they'd realize 
that you cannot gain a faithful, steady, growing audience unless you have a 
book worth reading." 
</P>
<P>
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT Krantz has such a firm handle on the duties of both subject 
and profiler because she spent 27 years in journalism. Her articles appeared in 
magazines such as McCall's, Ladies Home Journal and Good Housekeeping, where 
she was on staff. But the editorial experience that truly seemed to prep her 
for success in her second career was her nine years with Cosmopolitan. 
</P>
<P>
By then, she was married with two sons, Nick, now 33, and Tony, now 30, and 
living in Los Angeles, where her husband's career had brought the family. And 
if her financial security allowed her to keep a luxuriously slow pace for a 
free-lancer -- filing four to six stories a year -- she had significantly more 
occupational focus than many of the Beverly Hills lunch ladies she associated 
with. 
</P>
<P>
To understand Krantz's writing style, you need only listen to her speak. This 
way, you can hear her comic timing and the real warmth she puts behind 
"magnificent" and "fabulous," those indicators of her perennially optimistic 
outlook. In print, it was this same chattiness, this breathless point of view, 
that made Krantz so well-suited for Cosmo. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Gurley Brown found Krantz "a simply magic writer. I can't think of 
anything wrong with Judy except she is, jeez, an almost nonstop talker." Her 
gift of gab must have come in handy during those labor-intensive pieces -- from 
"The Myth of the Multiple Orgasm" to "Anatomy of a Compulsive" -- that required 
interviewing scores of sources. Although she would question them on a specific 
issue, Krantz also must have been taking note of their personal tastes, their 
private daydreams. These women, not coincidentally, would become her target 
audience later. 
</P>
<P>
When Krantz was 48, she decided to drag her Smith-Corona portable into the 
guest bedroom to take her first crack at fiction writing. "I'd been harassed 
for 15 years by my husband to write fiction. And Steve finally made me feel so 
-- I guess the word is defensive -- about it that I decided that I would try to 
write a novel to show him that I couldn't write a novel. Halfway through the 
first chapter, it felt like I was flying without wings." 
</P>
<P>
The "Scruples" manuscript sold quickly, for $50,000, to Crown, and Cosmopolitan 
printed a bonus excerpt, one that Brown admits to selecting because "it was 
romantic and wildly sexy" and described the miracle-come-true of every Cosmo 
girl: "to be stranded on a beach with a multibillionaire and have a sexual 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
It took only four months for "Scruples" to leap to the top of the New York 
Times bestseller list. But it didn't dawn on Krantz until her second novel, 
"Princess Daisy," that she had abandoned journalism for good. "I'm much happier 
now, too," she says. "There is literally nothing that can compare to finding 
the work that you were meant to do." Fiction writing brings Krantz so much 
pleasure, in fact, that she can conjure up a fresh concept for each subsequent 
novel as she is putting the finishing touches on her preceding one. "I don't 
sit around and think about it," she says. "Usually a new idea just floats into 
my mind." 
</P>
<P>
KRANTZ IS sitting in her office, knees girlishly pulled toward her chest. "I 
think my real theme is that I'm creating the daughters I never had," she says, 
looking dwarfed by the pink plaid overstuffed chair she is resting in. She is 
recalling how on a recent Wednesday afternoon trip to the hairdresser, she had 
a $40-a-session clairvoyant give her a reading. Krantz had her hair in curlers 
and was wearing a beauty-shop smock, so the woman "had really no way of knowing 
anything about me." 
</P>
<P>
The psychic came forth with many accuracies, including the fact that Krantz is 
a perfectionist and that all of her tension is expressed "right here," says 
Krantz, tapping her stomach. So when the psychic asked if she had a fully grown 
daughter, Krantz began to add up the female characters she had written who were 
in their late 20s. By the time she tallied up 18 of them, she concluded that 
"the internal theme of all my books is the creation of fully grown women for my 
own satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
That's about all Krantz cares to reveal about her sure-fire formula. Leave it 
to the book critics to analyze the repetitive threads in her work, to make fun 
of her plots and the cartoony names like Spider and Bunny and Fernanda. In 
breaking down her approach, they somehow obliterate the fact that she still 
works hard, considers every novel a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"People keep saying to me, 'Why are you going to write another book? You don't 
need the money.' " she says. "It's not about money. I need to throw myself into 
that situation where I grow and change because I am writing something new, 
trying to create different characters who've never existed before." 
</P>
<P>
The hour is getting late. Krantz walks with her guest past her 10 silver-framed 
New York Times bestseller lists clustered on a table, past a shelf containing 
leather-bound copies of her books. Just before she walks out the office door, 
she pauses at a small, mounted note. In the faintest, wobbliest script 
possible, it says: Do not disturb unless absolutely necessary. The note was 
written during her first tentative attempts at "Scruples." She keeps it as a 
souvenir of how far she has come. "It looks so timid, so unsure," she says, 
clucking over the penmanship. "If I had to do it now, believe me, it would say, 
Stay out." 
</P>
<P>
A week later, Krantz is talking into the telephone, coming up with another 
theory about her fiction. "One thing about writing a book," she says, "is that 
everything is under your control. You can't be unpopular with your characters 
because you are their God. You decide if they live or die. You decide if they 
get married or don't. You decide if they are attractive or not attractive. And 
it would be an oversimplification to say that this is my vindication for my 
years of being unpopular. But it certainly helps a little."

<P>
MILAGROS -- SMALL ornaments in human and animal shapes -- were often left in 
Catholic churches in Latin America for the village priest's blessing. Hopeful 
petitioners would hang a charm in the shape of the part of the body that needed 
healing (a silver leg, perhaps, for an arthritis sufferer, or a small cherub to 
banish infertility) and pray for a miracle (milagro). 
</P>
<P>
Although the church no longer condones the practice, artisans have discovered 
that the tiny talismans make interesting additions to hand-crafted jewelry and 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Venice jewelry shop Tantau Smith sells antique silver lockets hung with 
milagros ($95 to $125), as well as silver frames that swing with the miniature 
charms and house portraits of Mexican surrealist painter Frida Khalo ($95). 
</P>
<P>
New Yorker Sara Penn integrates the use of milagros with the indigenous fabrics 
she collects on her world travels. Her latest offerings, by Knobkerry, combine 
two of fashion's current favorites: velvet and ethnic prints. The patchwork 
bolero-style vests ($285) are brilliant mosaics of jewel-colored panne velvet 
and native fabrics such as South African mud cloth, Central American 
tapestries, mirrored Indian cottons and royal kente cloth from Ghana, many of 
which are stitched with milagros, tiny mirrors and Native American fetish dolls 
in turquoise and horn. Penn's envelope-style purses with theme motifs -- the 
sequined-palm-trees representative is embroidered with "Save the Earth"sell for 
$225 and are heavy with milagros. All are available at Laise Adzer.

EXPECTANT FATHERS who feel neglected during mom's pregnancy can get equal time 
with the Labor Coach Kit. This playful attache case full of goodies designed to 
help fathers become more involved in the labor and delivery process is the 
brainchild of Elise and Dimitri Vazelakis. 
</P>
<P>
When the couple began childbirth classes in preparation for the arrival of 
their first child, Dimitri excitedly went shopping for such items as a 
stopwatch to time contractions and a paper bag to prevent hyperventilation. 
"But when we found there was nothing on the market that had everything in one 
place to help dads," Elise says, "we developed the Labor Coach Kit and decided 
to market it for soon-to-be fathers." 
</P>
<P>
Baby Alexander arrived last March, and the Labor Coach Kit (about $35) shortly 
thereafter. According to Elise, all the items in the kit -- a baseball cap, 
stopwatch, therapy ball, sports bottle, telephone lineup chart to list 
essential phone numbers, earplugs, time-of-delivery pool card for fans, and 
flash cards containing helpful coaching tips for each stage of labor -- revolve 
around a sports theme "because we felt like we were in training for the main 
event," Elise says. In addition, there are assorted informational "score 
cards." 
</P>
<P>
"Some items are functional," she says, "but a lot are for fun. We want new 
parents to find some humor in the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Coach Kit is available by mail order: P.O. Box 67308, Los Angeles 
90067, or by telephoning (213) 550-8299. It is also sold at all Babyland 
locations.

CLIMBING L.A.

FORGET TRAFFIC jams and parking hassles. In the charming guide, "Stairway Walks 
in Los Angeles," authors Adah Bakalinsky and Larry Gordon share their 
enthusiasm for walking by exploring the heart of Los Angeles: its 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The book ($8.95) reports on 18 L.A. walks, each about two to 2 1/2 hours -- 
covering landscape from the ocean to downtown and beyond -- and includes 
illustrations, maps and a bit of the history of the community of the trek. The 
rating system is based on pieces of fruit needed to replace energy: a 
two-orange walk is a moderate walk; longer, tougher trips, up to four oranges 
and, sometimes, cantaloupes, tangelos, raisins and walnuts. 
</P>
<P>
The downtown walk descends the new Bunker Hill steps, with a miniature river of 
bubbling water gushing down its center and shops and cafes on the terrace. The 
tour continues through the lobby and ground floor of the Biltmore, perhaps a 
stop for a spot of tea? In Franklin Heights, there's the nine-acre estate, 
Villa Giuseppi, to explore. And for those whose idea of exercise is a climb 
into a favorite armchair, the book makes for delightful reading for the voyeur 
hiker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stairway Walks in Los Angeles," is available through Wilderness Press, (800) 
443-7227; and at major book and sporting-goods stores throughout the area.PAT

IF YOU LOVE the outdoorsy flavor of meats and fish smoked slowly over hickory 
or mesquite but aren't crazy about getting out the smoker for small quantities 
of food, consider the Stovetop Smoker Cooker. It allows you to prepare just 
enough for one meal -- in very little time and without the bother of constantly 
running outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
It consists of a heavy stainless-steel pan that looks like a cake pan, a drip 
tray, a cooking rack and a lid. You simply place the chips in the pan, then add 
the chicken breasts, fish, even vegetables atop the food rack, and cover. Any 
fat drips into the tray below, and the food steams healthfully in its own 
juices, while the wood chips impart a smoky flavor. 
</P>

Gelson's markets.ROBIN TUCKER

APPROVAL FOR COLLEGE PLAN SEEN; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE COUNTY PLANNING COMMISSION APPEARS LIKELY TO LET A BAPTIST 
BIBLE COLLEGE SELL LAND FOR A HOUSING PROJECT.

<P>
The Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission appears ready to support a 
Christian college's plan to rebuild its campus in San Dimas and sell much of 
its land to a developer for construction of 114 homes. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's four members indicated at a public hearing Thursday that they 
will not heed the calls of neighboring residents to reduce the scope of a joint 
venture by Pacific Coast Baptist Bible College and Century American Corp. 
</P>
<P>
While the commissioners did not explicitly say how they will vote when the 
matter returns to them Dec. 13, all four asked the college to return with only 
one concession -- granting 9.5 acres of land for the county to add to the 
adjoining Walnut Creek wilderness area. 
</P>
<P>
The college had already promised to dedicate 70 acres of open space next to the 
campus and proposed housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
The Regional Planning Commission has discretion over the project because the 
college's 150-acre campus is part of an island of unincorporated county 
territory, although surrounded on all sides by the city of San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's recommendation will be forwarded to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Construction plans call for a new Bible college campus on about 20 acres that 
would replace the run-down buildings currently at the same location. Another 53 
acres would be sold to Century American for construction of luxury homes, with 
the college's remaining property granted to the county for open space. 
</P>
<P>
The college plans to sell the land to the home builder to pay for construction 
of the new campus. 
</P>
<P>
The plan presented to the Regional Planning Commission last week was 
essentially the same as the one neighbors protested at a hearing in late 
September. The developer made one change -- reducing grading for an entry road 
at the north end of the campus so that 75 fewer oak trees would be uprooted. 
The original plan proposed removing 361 oaks, compared to 286 in the revision. 
</P>
<P>
Several San Dimas residents told the commission Thursday that the new campus 
and houses would destroy a wooded canyon area that is home to a variety of 
wildlife. They asked the commission to recommend a reduction in the number of 
homes or in the size of the campus, which will have a maximum enrollment of 500 
students. 
</P>
<P>
One neighbor suggested that Century American be allowed to build just 75 homes. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners received support from Jack L. Bath, a biology professor from Cal 
Poly Pomona, who said county planners were guilty of "biological negligence" 
because an environmental impact report did not consider potential damage to a 
number of animals, including two bird species -- the burrowing owl and the 
black-tailed gnatcatcher. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the environmental report also did not assess the extent of "road 
kill" -- the number of mammals that would be run over by the increased traffic 
in Walnut Creek canyon. Nor was the impact of grading and removal of some 
native plants on animals measured, Bath said. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Cottle, a Century American executive, said the company has made an 
extensive assessment of environmental impacts of construction and that the 
dedication of nearly 80 acres of open space will be a significant contribution 
to the ecology of the area. 
</P>
<P>
He said the developer has already compromised, reducing earlier plans to build 
as many as 182 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Besides dedication of additional open space, Commissioner Clinton C. Ternstrom 
said he will ask for assurances that sporting events, concerts and other 
activities at the college will not disturb neighboring homeowners.

SHOP'S ONE-ARMED BANDITS ARE FOR SALE, NOT PLAY

<P>
People often walk into John Lewis' shop and get this lightning-struck look on 
their faces. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a woman come in, hand me a bill and say, 'Give me $5 worth of nickels,' 
" Lewis said. "I said, 'It doesn't work that way.' " 
</P>
<P>
The way it works is that those gleaming chrome- and nickel-plated machines with 
the little windows displaying fruits and bells are antique slot machines. The 
Robert Du Rose Coin Slot Machines store on San Gabriel Boulevard in Pasadena 
isn't a gambling parlor. It's a retail establishment. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they start to shaking all over," Lewis said with a look of long- 
</P>
<P>
suffering indulgence. "They just want to rush in and get that money in the 
bank." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who bought the store from its namesake seven years ago, has been 
repairing and selling old slot machines for 14 years now, ever since he bought 
one at a garage sale in Glendale. His shop is unique in the San Gabriel Valley, 
according to an official of the Automatic Coin Machine Collectors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
An admitted tinkerer, Lewis has rebuilt cars, repaired locks and salvaged 
antique guns. "It's a gift," he said modestly. But the old slot machines, with 
their elaborate clocklike inner workings, got him hooked. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who invented them were geniuses," said Lewis, 55, a bulky man with 
a bushy mustache whose open-necked work shirt shows a glimpse of an old tattoo 
on his chest. "One guy would take another guy's idea, then go off on his own 
tangent. I just try to figure out how the machines work, but those guys 
invented them." 
</P>
<P>
The slot machine, originated by Gustav Schultze and Charles Fey around the time 
Edison was making his light bulb and Bell his telephone, is usually a compact, 
armor-plated box with a handle like a car's stick shift, whirling reels and an 
opening that can disgorge torrents of coins. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis has a collection of several dozen in his showroom on San Gabriel 
Boulevard, one or two of them dating back to the last century. There are old "3 
Jack" machines, which direct tossed pennies through a field of pins to possible 
payoffs in little pockets at the bottom. There are spinning wheel devices, 
push-pin Bingo games and a wooden Indian with a torso consisting of a golden 
one-armed bandit. 
</P>
<P>
There are more, in various stages of disarray, in his workroom in the back. 
</P>
<P>
"The principle of the machine is to give the pretext that, if you play it, 
you'll get money back," Lewis said. "You do, of course. But a percentage goes 
right back to the house." 
</P>
<P>
Back when there were slot machines in every saloon or speakeasy, companies such 
as Bally Manufacturing, F.W. Mills and Watling Manufacturing were putting out 
thousands of variations on the theme. The Ballyhoo, the Mills Silent Gooseneck, 
the Watling Checkerboard and dozens more were as much a part of masculine 
American recreational life in the early 20th Century as were spittoons and 
cigar smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to offer a machine that was eye-catching and full of seductive 
promise, Lewis said. "Each one tried to outdo the other." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, gambling machines have always lingered just beyond the edge of 
respectability. Politicians and prosecutors have made reputations with 
anti-slot campaigns, and much of Lewis' merchandise arrives at his shop with 
dents from sledgehammer blows inflicted by reformers and their deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of this stuff is salvageable," Lewis said, poking through a box of 
broken metal parts. "A lot of stuff comes out of the dumps. You can sandblast 
it and paint it back up." 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, attitudes are a little more tolerant. Organizations such as the 
Automatic Coin Machine Collectors Assn. are lobbying for changes in laws 
concerning slot machines, and their members are Lewis' customers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the organization's 50 or so members have machines in their basements or 
recreation rooms, said Tom Hopkins, a board member. 
</P>
<P>
"It's becoming more and more popular," he said. "We run a fun fair once a year, 
where people come through and sell a lot of machines. It's an interesting hobby 
but not real cheap. For a decent machine, the average price can run between 
$1,500 and $3,000." 
</P>
<P>
It's legal in California to own slot machines, provided that they're not used 
for gambling and that they were made before 1956, according to a spokeswoman 
for the Los Angeles County district attorney. There are lobbying efforts afoot 
to liberalize the law, said Hopkins, a retired cookware distributor from 
Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
But 11 states still prohibit the possession of slot machines, and laws in other 
states vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-born Lewis is, by trade, a construction plumber. But he was 
attracted to mechanical things from childhood. "I built hot rods, stuff like 
that," he said. "I had a '48 Ford with a supercharged '55 Buick engine, with a 
racing clutch that could burn rubber for a quarter of a mile if it had to." 
</P>
<P>
People often come into his shop to ask him to fix their pinball machines and 
jukeboxes, Lewis said. He declines: "It's a whole different trade." 
</P>
<P>
Others come in wanting to know how to beat the slots in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
There were beatable machines in the old days, Lewis concedes. "You could glue a 
string or a wire to your coin so it wouldn't drop," he said. "Or you could 
drill holes in the sides of the machines and wire the wheels. But nowadays, the 
machines (in Nevada) are armor-plated." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' advice to those who would beat the slots nowadays: "Don't play."

COUNTY LETS ECOLOGICAL HERITAGE ERODE; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: A 1980 PROMISE TO PROTECT 61 UNSPOILED AREAS FROM DEVELOPMENT 
HASN'T BEEN KEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With its coastal, desert, and alpine landscapes, Los Angeles County has a 
natural diversity almost unequaled in the world. In recognition of this, and 
under pressure from the courts, officials a decade ago created a network of 
"Significant Ecological Areas" to save remnants of that rich natural heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Ranging from austere desert buttes and ancient oak savannahs to deep canyons, 
coastal dunes and wetlands, the areas were selected for their value as habitat 
and migration corridors for wildlife, or as strongholds for threatened plants, 
animals and birds. 
</P>
<P>
The 61 SEAs were mostly privately owned, but the county's 1980 General Plan 
made it official policy to protect them from incompatible development and to 
try to acquire those most threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the SEAs have suffered from obscurity and neglect, an investigation 
by The Times has found. SEAs have been nibbled by development, and, with other 
open space dwindling, are under enormous pressure from big housing and 
commercial projects, proposed roads and even garbage dumps. 
</P>
<P>
One area alone -- the Palo Comado SEA in Agoura -- is targeted by four 
residential and commercial projects. A proposed project of 1,900 homes and a 
golf course would cover 300 acres of an SEA in Valencia. And at the edge of the 
Ballona Creek SEA near Marina del Rey, a proposed city-within-a-city called 
Playa Vista is envisioned with 11,750 housing units and parking for 25,000 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the SEAs are struggling to survive," said Tim Thomas, a biologist and 
member of a county advisory committee on the SEAs. "We're . . . getting a wave 
of requests to develop in SEAs, to use SEAs to . . . put trash in and to put 
houses on, and these things are all incompatible with the intent of the 
designation of the SEAs." 
</P>
<P>
But Dave Vannatta, an aide to County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, said that the 
SEAs have been reasonably protected and that development within them "has been 
compatible with the resource." 
</P>
<P>
Don Knabe, an aide to Supervisor Deane Dana, said the supervisors rely on 
county planning staff for advice on land-use matters, adding that that he was 
not aware of any controversy concerning the SEAs. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County is not solely in charge of the SEAs' fate. Some are within 
municipal boundaries, where county land-use regulations do not apply. 
</P>
<P>
Still, had the county made the SEAs a priority, development conflicts would 
have been reduced. But management of the SEAs has been a serious failure, 
interviews and public records show. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
* The county did not fulfill the commitment made a decade ago to "actively 
search for funding mechanisms at all governmental levels" to purchase SEAs. The 
proposed county parks bond issue that failed at the polls Nov. 6 would have 
provided the first funds to purchase SEAs. 
</P>
<P>
* County planning officials have not monitored development in SEAs and don't 
know which areas are intact or degraded. Without such basic data, informed 
decisions on new development plans in SEAs are impossible. Yet county 
supervisors have turned down requests for funds to study the status of the 
SEAs. 
</P>
<P>
* The county itself is a threat to SEAs. For example, county transportation 
plans call for eventual extension of Thousand Oaks Boulevard through the Palo 
Comado SEA in Agoura, an expanse of grassy hills and stately oaks that supports 
deer, bobcats, coyotes, and golden eagles. The county also has declared three 
canyons in SEAs in the Santa Susana and Santa Monica mountains to be suitable 
sites for future trash dumps. 
</P>
<P>
"If we take a so-what attitude towards the SEAs, we're taking a so-what 
attitude toward the . . . ecosystems of the rest of the world, and the 
ecosystems are what support our lives," said Dick Friesen, a biologist and 
consultant who chairs the Significant Ecological Area Technical Advisory 
Committee, or SEATAC, a panel of biologists that advises the county on 
development in SEAs. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can't retain the SEAs in Los Angeles County, where there's a big 
population base and a big economic base to do it," it will be impossible to do 
in poorer parts of the world, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even when portions of SEAs have been preserved, it has required big concessions 
to developers. Consider two recent agreements that have been hailed as 
environmental triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, Los Angeles airport officials agreed to preserve 200 acres of the 
El Segundo Dunes SEA west of Los Angeles International Airport, while 
developing a golf course on 100 other acres. 
</P>
<P>
In the other case, environmentalists and developers settled years of litigation 
over the Ballona Creek SEA, which includes one of Southern California's last 
surviving tidal wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
The developers agreed to preserve and help restore about 270 acres of the 
wetlands. In return, environmentalists agreed not to fight plans for the huge 
Playa Vista development overlooking the preserve, which is to include 11,750 
apartment and condominium units, 2,400 hotel rooms and 5.7 million square feet 
of office and retail space. 
</P>
<P>
Other SEAs are also threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Above Granada Hills, Browning-Ferris Industries is trying to expand its 
Sunshine Canyon landfill into more than 500 acres of the Santa Susana Mountains 
SEA, a move that would wipe out thousands of trees and redraw the SEA map to 
delete that portion. 
</P>
<P>
Another plan calls for development of two golf courses on more than 600 acres 
of the Tonner Canyon SEA near Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
West of Lancaster, the proposed California Springs development -- 5,700 acres 
and 21,000 homes -- would encroach on the Joshua Tree Woodland and the Fairmont 
and Antelope Buttes SEAs. 
</P>
<P>
Piecemeal development has pecked away at the Kentucky Springs SEA south of 
Palmdale, a swath of rugged foothills where a distinct subspecies of Great 
Basin sage grows in unusual abundance. The northern part of that SEA has been 
damaged by houses and four-wheel-drive traffic, according to Asenath Rasmussen, 
a biochemist and research consultant who recently visited the area. 
</P>
<P>
The northern part, she said, has been "altered so dramatically that it's not a 
continuously functioning community anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Like the agreement on the Ballona wetlands, the SEA network grew out of a 
citizens lawsuit. In 1975, a group calling itself the Coalition for Los Angeles 
Planning in the Public Interest won a lawsuit against the county over 
deficiencies in the county's General Plan, including lack of adequate 
open-space protection. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the county had to rewrite the General Plan and improve its 
open-space policies. The SEAs were designated by consultants whose report 
called for preserving the SEAs in "as near a pristine condition as possible." 
</P>
<P>
A few uses -- such as passive recreation and nature study -- should be allowed, 
but "residential, agricultural, industrial and commercial developments" would 
damage native vegetation and "are clearly incompatible," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Saving SEAs "would inevitably require acquisition of areas by Los Angeles 
County," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The General Plan diluted these conclusions in substance and tone. It did not 
rule out residential development in SEAs, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the plan declared it county policy "to preserve the county's significant 
ecological resources and habitat areas in as viable and natural condition as 
possible." And an accompanying document pledged that the county would seek 
funds to buy SEAs. 
</P>
<P>
But the timing could not have been worse for a costly new environmental 
program. In 1978, the tax-slashing Proposition 13 cut deeply into county 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the year the General Plan was adopted, 1980, was also the year Mike 
Antonovich and Deane Dana joined incumbent Pete Schabarum on the Board of 
Supervisors, forming a conservative, pro-development majority that receives 
substantial campaign contributions from development interests. 
</P>
<P>
A 1980s building boom coincided with a steady erosion of county planning staff, 
making it more difficult to study the impact of development on open space. The 
county Department of Regional Planning saw its staff dwindle from 212 employees 
in 1980 to about 150 today, department figures show. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the supervisors did not create a fund to buy SEAs. Two other agencies 
-- the National Park Service and Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy -- did buy 
some tracts in the Santa Monica Mountains that included SEAs. But critics, 
including some members of Congress, said the supervisors at times were more 
hindrance than help. 
</P>
<P>
By "upzoning" land in scenic areas -- allowing developers to build more homes 
than previous zoning provided -- the supervisors made acquisition more 
expensive and difficult for other agencies, the critics said. 
</P>
<P>
"The county should be condemned . . . not because they haven't come up with the 
money themselves, but because they haven't cooperated with" park agencies that 
had funds, said Carlyle W. Hall Jr., the Los Angeles attorney who filed the 
1973 suit that voided the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Teresa, a wildlife biologist with the California Department of Fish and 
Game and formerly its Los Angeles wildlife unit manager, said high-ranking Fish 
and Game officials have essentially written off Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude is that, within L.A. County, . . . development was inevitable, 
you weren't going to save anything anyway," so Fish and Game "would rather 
spend their . . . very limited resources elsewhere," Teresa said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a board of supervisors that's philosophically opposed to restricting 
the use of private property, and I think they're philosophically opposed to the 
public ownership of land," said David Brown, an associate professor of history 
at Valley College and chairman of the Sierra Club's Santa Monica Mountains task 
force. 
</P>
<P>
But Vannatta, the Antonovich aide, said that the county faces critical unmet 
needs and that purchasing SEAs "cannot and does not have that kind of 
priority." Besides, the idea is to protect the SEAs, not own them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike's interest is in protecting the resource," Vannatta said of his boss. 
"We've been able to protect these lands without taking them off the tax rolls." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edelman said he was concerned the county had not made the SEAs "a 
high enough priority." 
</P>
<P>
An Edelman aide noted that the SEAs have not been a big issue for local 
environmental groups. "You've got a lot of commitments to honor, and the ones 
you pay most attention to are the ones where people hold your feet to the 
fire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As the first line of defense for the SEAs, the county created SEATAC, the panel 
of biologists that reviews projects in the SEAs. 
</P>
<P>
SEATAC reviews building plans for their effect on native vegetation and 
wildlife, and typically recommends a few changes to reduce damage, such as 
clustering of homes. On rare occasions, SEATAC advises that that a project be 
rejected as overly destructive. Such a recommendation by SEATAC figured earlier 
this year in the rejection of the huge Malibu Terrace development in the Palo 
Comado SEA, a project now being redesigned. 
</P>
<P>
But some county planners, and SEATAC members themselves, see serious flaws in 
the system. As SEATAC member Frank Hovore put it, "the process still allows for 
the slow deterioration of the SEAs." 
</P>
<P>
For example, many SEA encroachments never come to SEATAC's attention. 
Subdivisions need county approval, but landowners build single-family homes and 
horse corrals or graze cattle in SEAs without SEATAC's knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, SEATAC members said, it appears that landowners have graded or 
grazed their property before coming before the panel so they can argue that 
there are no rare plants to protect. 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, SEATAC recommendations are almost impossible to enforce, such 
as requirements to minimize destruction of natural vegetation that must be 
cleared near homes under fire safety rules. 
</P>
<P>
SEATAC members also lack detailed information on the condition of SEAs -- data 
vital to making sound decisions about the cumulative effects of development. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't give a progress report of how much development has occured in the 
area, how much of the SEA has been lost to development since designation of the 
SEA," SEATAC member Tim Thomas said. It's a "constraint on our ability to 
perform." 
</P>
<P>
For about three years, SEATAC members have pushed for a study of the status of 
SEAs -- including field surveys and aerial photographs to assess damage and 
determine which SEAs should be expanded or reduced. 
</P>
<P>
But two separate budget requests for between $300,000 and $350,000 have been 
rejected. Rather than renew the request this year, planning officials instead 
decided to earmark $40,000 in operating funds to launch the SEA study. But the 
work has not begun, partly due to the problem of deciding what can be done with 
so little money. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of this whole problem," said Ted Elias, a planning department 
administrator, the $40,000 "is just a very, very minimal start." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SIGNIFICANT ECOLOGICAL AREAS 
</P>
<P>
61 areas* were designated in the county's 1980 General Plan. To be protected 
were rare landscapes, wildlife migration corridors, habitats for insects, 
plants, birds, and mammals.

MALIBU OFFICIAL CRITICIZED OVER FUND-RAISING EFFORT; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: COUNCILMAN-ELECT LARRY WAN'S SLOW-GROWTH STANCE IS QUESTIONED AFTER 
$500-A-PLATE BREAKFAST BRINGS IN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM DEVELOPERS.

<TEXT>
<P>
A fund-raiser for Malibu City Councilman-elect Larry Wan that collected $9,000 
from about 20 supporters, including several real estate developers, has fueled 
a new round of bickering among Malibu's slow-growth oriented leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Wan's colleagues on the five-member council have criticized his 
accepting money from developers, and they contend that a $500-a-plate breakfast 
held at a Malibu-area restaurant last month has tarnished his credentials as a 
slow-growth advocate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the breakfast) was a slap in the face to the vast majority of voters, 
who elected us to protect Malibu from development interests," Councilwoman 
Carolyn Van Horn said. "It makes you wonder just who he intends to represent." 
</P>
<P>
She and Mayor-elect Walt Keller, who also criticized the event, often have been 
at odds with Wan and the two other members of the council. Keller and Van Horn 
formerly co-chaired the Malibu Committee for Incorporation, a slow-growth 
group. Wan and the others have strong ties to the Malibu Township Council, 
another slow-growth group. 
</P>
<P>
Wan dismissed the criticism as a "hullabaloo about nothing" and said the 
fund-raiser was intended "as an opportunity for me to reach out to different 
segments of the community." 
</P>
<P>
"My views on growth issues and as a protector of the environment are 
well-known," he said. "I've never deviated from them and never intend to." 
</P>
<P>
Wan was the second-highest vote-getter, behind Keller, among those elected to 
the council last June, when Malibu voters overwhelmingly approved cityhood. 
Although elected, the council members cannot take office until Malibu becomes a 
city. Los Angeles County officials have delayed cityhood until at least March 
in a bid to start work on a controversial sewer system there before the Malibu 
City Council can block it. 
</P>
<P>
Wan spent $33,700 during his campaign, including $24,000 of his own funds. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Wan said that "contrary to what many people 
believe," the fund-raiser, held Nov. 5 at an oceanfront restaurant near Malibu, 
was not intended to recoup his personal campaign expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"I never intended it (the event) to retire my campaign debt and don't intend to 
use the money for that purpose," he said, adding that the proceeds "will be put 
into a separate account for use in supporting future environmental initiatives 
and other environmental causes." 
</P>
<P>
However, interviews with some who attended, as well as invitations to the 
event, suggest a different purpose. 
</P>
<P>
After mentioning that a $500 contribution was expected, a letter sent to 
invitees added, "We hope at this time to retire a large part of his (Wan's) 
debt." The invitations were prepared by Geary Steffen, Wan's campaign 
treasurer. A copy was obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Wan said that he had not seen the letter and was not aware of its contents. 
</P>
<P>
Keller called the fund-raiser "an example of big city politics" and accused Wan 
of changing his story about the way the funds were to be used to defuse 
criticism of the event. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice of him to double-cross all the developers who paid to have breakfast 
with him, but I don't believe they went there to give funds to the 
environment," Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
Wan, however, defended the decision to invite developers to the event. "I've 
learned that the best way to eliminate an opponent is to make him your ally," 
he said. "They may call it big city politics, but I call it petty politics on 
the part of those who would get upset over a measly $9,000." 
</P>
<P>
Among those who attended were Lyn Konheim and John Perenchio, executives with 
Malibu Bay Co., one of Malibu's largest landowners; Paul Flowers, a development 
consultant with ties to Supervisor Deane Dana, who represented Malibu until the 
recent court-ordered redistricting; at least two representatives of the Adamson 
Cos., which wants to build a luxury hotel near Pepperdine University, and 
several real estate brokers and others with development interests. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who contributed but who did not attend were Joseph T. Edmiston, 
executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, and developer Roy 
Crummer, who built the Malibu Colony Plaza shopping center, according to a 
source who helped organize the event. 
</P>
<P>
The event was put together by Wan supporter Susan McCabe, a former coastal 
commissioner who is now with Rose &amp; Kindel, a Los Angeles consulting firm. 
The firm often represents developers before the Coastal Commission, and it 
currently represents Los Angeles County in its bid to win the state panel's 
approval to speed construction of the sewer.

McCabe labeled criticism of the fund-raiser as unjustified and said she offered 
to help Wan retire his campaign debt "because I know and have a lot of respect 
for Larry Wan as a man of integrity, even though he often opposes projects that 
I support." 
</P>
<P>
Wan, the former head of the Township Council, and his wife, Sara, who is 
currently the group's vice president, have been among those at the forefront of 
opposition to the county's sewer plans. 
</P>
<P>
At its meetings, which are held twice a month, the council has so often voted 3 
to 2 -- with Wan, Mike Caggiano and Missy Zeitsoff in the majority -- that the 
outcome on many matters has become predictable.

CITY PARTLY FUNDS ROADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city will pay half the cost of building roadway and storm drains along the 
final two unfinished portions of Meadowpass Road between Lemon Avenue and Amar 
Road, the City Council decided Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Developers of two housing tracts that encompass the remaining links of the 
1.1-mile stretch of Meadowpass Road will be responsible for the other half of 
the public improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The council set an upper limit of $480,000 on the city's contribution. 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimate the total cost of the street and storm drain 
construction will be $800,000. In approving the development agreement, the 
council nullified an earlier stipulation that the developers dedicate one lot 
to the city for an equestrian park. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Brown, attorney for developers Taleb Sabouni, Robert Salamoni and Adnan 
Jouma, had threatened to sue if that condition were not removed. The agreement 
still must be approved by the developer.

"Why are you sitting on the roof of the garage?" the Formidable Companion 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Trying to keep the alligators at an arm's length," we said. 
</P>
<P>
She fixed us with a stare. Some explanation was clearly in order. 
</P>
<P>
"Haven't you looked around, lately?" we said. "The world is going to 
h-e-double-hockey-sticks in a handbasket." 
</P>
<P>
"Always has, always will be," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She was going to have to do better than that. We told her about Mr. Turner, our 
next-door neighbor, sicking his pet on us that very morning. That was the last 
straw. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's a cat," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Not just a cat," we said. "A 17-pound irate tabby." 
</P>
<P>
"Come down now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
We told her to send up our easy chair. We were going to be here for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"Give us one good reason to come down," we said. "Just one." It was growing 
cold, but we still had a desire to be wooed in some way. 
</P>
<P>
Because, she said, some part of us is still a child who would enjoy the Oakland 
Ballet performing "The Nutcracker" at Smothers Theatre at Pepperdine University 
in Malibu. Showtimes are 2 and 7 p.m. today, and admission is $22. For 
information call (213) 456-4522. 
</P>
<P>
Because, she said, when the world seems that serious a couple of 
nyuk-nyuk-nyuks are in order, and the Three Stooges will be honored at a 60th 
anniversary celebration at the Improv, 8162 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood, at 7 
p.m. Wednesday. Admission is free. For information call (213) 659-6400. 
</P>
<P>
And because we wouldn't be up on the roof of the garage if we didn't care, and 
Caring for Babies with AIDS will hold its fourth annual fund-raising walk at 
Santa Monica Boulevard and Palm Drive in Beverly Hills, today at 8 a.m. A $15 
donation is asked. For information call (213) 931-9828. 
</P>
<P>
She had us. And so we came down for all those reasons, and the most important 
one. Her. R.D.

BKK RISK STUDY TO BE AIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Department of Health Services will hold a public meeting Thursday to 
discuss studies of cancer and other risks for residents near the BKK Corp. 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The studies said cancer rates near the 583-acre landfill are about the same as 
in Los Angeles County overall. However, people living near the landfill face a 
slightly higher risk of cancer than the U.S. average -- two additional cases 
per 100,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting will start at 7:30 p.m. at the West Covina Library meeting room, 
1601 West Covina Parkway.

FEE FOR FALSE FIRE ALARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hoping to reduce a spate of false fire and burglar alarms, the city will begin 
charging residents and businesses $50 if their alarm is accidentally activated 
more than three times in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty, approved by the City Council last week, will take effect Jan. 6. 
The Department of Public Safety reported that in a 12-month period that ended 
in May, 98% of the city's 2,947 alarm-generated emergencies were false calls. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance also limits the duration of an alarm to 15 minutes and prohibits 
alarm systems that sound like emergency vehicle sirens or civil defense 
warnings.

MENORAH LIGHTING IS WELCOME RESPITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to the "Menorah Display OK is Outrageous" letter from Douglas E. 
Mirell of the American Jewish Congress (Westside, Nov. 18): I would like to see 
Mr. Mirell write a letter protesting the lighting of the National Christmas 
Tree or the Easter Egg Hunt at the White House. Until that happens, the 
credibility of Mr. Mirell and his organization on the menorah issue will remain 
close to zero. 
</P>
<P>
I invite Mr. Mirell to come this year and observe the lighting of this menorah 
he so objects to. He will be surprised to discover that a large portion of the 
attendees are, like me, totally secular Jews who find this a heartwarming event 
and a welcome respite from the public Christmas bombardment that we otherwise 
are exposed to at this time of year.

'BOOTLEG' HOUSING STORY DRAWS FIRE, CLAIMS OF 'BIAS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a resident of Altadena for the past 13 years, I have been silent until now 
in voicing my strong objection to the changes which have taken place on 
Woodbury Street in recent years. I find the trend toward increased population 
density and "multiple use" property in the area disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
I believe we have been victimized by non-enforcement of zoning codes and those 
who are exploiting this situation for monetary gain. 
</P>
<P>
Conversion of garages for rental property, use of residential property for 
business purposes, for schools, preschools, or communes is inappropriate for a 
single-family neighborhood. I use the term "family" in its well-known, 
traditional sense. 
</P>
<P>
The attendant increase in traffic, strain on public services, noise, 
accumulation of trash of all descriptions, parking of vehicles (many of which 
are inoperative) on front lawns and uses of property for other than 
single-family residences provide ample evidence of blatant disregard for zoning 
codes and the wishes of neighbors in the surrounding area. In addition, many of 
the structures may be in violation of fire and safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
The concerned citizens in this matter wish to protect and enhance the quality 
of our neighborhood. We loved Altadena. That's why we moved here in the first 
place. In addition, we wish to protect our property values. The rising tide of 
squalor and blight on Woodbury must be stopped and turned back. We ask all 
relevant regulatory agencies to assist us in this matter.

In the article by (staff writer) Vicki Torres, a 4-month-old baby is the 
central focus of two pictures with the article.

Is this baby responsible for the bootleg housing, illegal structures and 
businesses and blight on Woodbury Road? 
</P>
<P>
The article was slanted and the pictures did not focus on the real issues at 
hand.

'BOOTLEG' HOUSING STORY DRAWS FIRE, CLAIMS OF 'BIAS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am disappointed in The Times' article, "County to Rule on 'Bootleg' Housing 
Gripe" (Nov. 8). Sympathy seems to be with the law abusers rather than with the 
victims of the abuse. 
</P>
<P>
This is evidenced by the tone of the article, as well as by the two 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "gripe" against Altadena bootleggers Guillermo Villareal and his 
wife, Margaret, is the legitimate complaint of citizens who genuinely care 
about their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens who are willing to invest themselves, their time, money, and energy -- 
not to mention their reputations -- to battle infractions of legal codes and 
regulations should be affirmed, not labeled pests. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "gripe" is not an issue of the "haves" versus the "have nots." 
Rather, it is the complaint of hard-working citizens who live in a community 
where bootlegging practices are depriving them of their rights and diminishing 
the quality of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, why doesn't The Times give equal photographic coverage to the real 
victims of bootlegging and lax county zoning enforcement? (They have babies, 
too.)

COLLEGE NEWS: SCHOOL OF MUSIC GETS $760,000 IN DONATIONS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Azusa Pacific University has received two substantial gifts that will bolster 
financial aid and assist the music school at the interdenominational Christian 
school. 
</P>
<P>
The estate of John Newhouse of Arcadia has donated $333,357 to underwrite 
student scholarships. Nancy Loncaric of Long Beach has given $175,000 to the 
School of Music. Total contributions announced at the school's annual 
fund-raising dinner totaled $760,000. 
</P>
<P>
Additional good news for the Azusa school is that enrollment is up 7.7%, to 
3,159 students, over this time last year. This increase comes at a time when 
other area schools are having to adjust to enrollment declines, said Ron 
D'Avis, media-relations coordinator.

COLLEGE NEWS: $450,000 GRANT GIVEN TO HELP RECRUIT FACULTY

</HEADLINE>

<P>
The James Irvine Foundation of San Francisco has awarded $450,000 to Pomona 
College to establish a fund to help recruit and retain science faculty, the 
school announced recently. 
</P>
<P>
The grant will be used to help pay for laboratory costs for new faculty 
members, and will also fund ongoing research at the Claremont institution. 
</P>
<P>
"The competition among top research universities in California for the 
brightest candidates is fierce," Pomona College President David Alexander said. 
"This competition is especially acute in the sciences, where employment offers 
can include laboratory start-up and research funds which often reach levels 
that few, if any, undergraduate institutions can match."

HEARING SET ON 2 PLANS TO IMPROVE HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A public hearing on two plans dealing with the revitalization of Hollywood 
Boulevard and Hollywood's chronic traffic problems is scheduled Thursday before 
the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency's Board of Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing will start at 11 a.m. in the fourth-floor boardroom at CRA 
headquarters, 354 S. Spring St. in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Hollywood Boulevard District Urban Design Plan and Hollywood 
Transportation Plan will become key elements in the $922-million redevelopment 
of the city's blighted movie capital, CRA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Following the CRA hearing, the urban-design draft will be submitted to the city 
Planning Commission and City Council for review and comments before CRA 
commissioners consider its adoption. 
</P>
<P>
The transportation plan, which is expected to provide the basis for a 
transportation ordinance, also will be reviewed at City Hall, submitted to the 
CRA board for its final approval and then sent to the City Council to be 
written into law. 
</P>
<P>
Following a public review and revision process, both plans are expected to be 
ready for adoption in 1991, CRA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Major components of the draft transportation plan include roadway improvements, 
proposals to improve traffic management and protect neighborhoods from 
increased traffic intrusion, expanded and improved public transit, reduction of 
adverse impacts from the proposed Metro Rail subway construction, and added 
parking. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed urban-design plan makes recommendations to enhance and preserve 
the architectural and functional character of the landmark boulevard. One goal 
is to encourage pedestrian use. It emphasizes residential and mixed-use 
development and contains incentives aimed at rehabilitating and reusing 
buildings of historical or architectural significance, according to the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of both plans are available for review at several locations in Hollywood 
and at CRA offices in downtown Los Angeles. A list of locations can be obtained 
by calling the CRA Hollywood site office at (213) 461-1066, or visiting the 
office at 6255 Sunset Blvd., Suite 711.

MOUNTED VOLUNTEERS PATROL ARROYO SECO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL BEN-ALI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every lawman needs a partner, and Don Zimmerman's is a 17-year-old buckskin 
quarter horse named Skeeter. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman, 78, is a member of the Pasadena Volunteer Equestrian Unit, an unpaid 
and unarmed group of riders selected by the Pasadena Police Department to 
patrol on horseback through isolated stretches of the Arroyo Seco that are 
difficult or impossible to patrol by car. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically they're reserve police, but non-sworn, who can write citations and 
are trained with Mace," said Lt. Gregg Henderson of the Pasadena Police 
Department, who, with now-retired Lt. Wesley Rice, was instrumental in getting 
police reserve status for the unit in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In the Arroyo Seco, the unit's 16 members give warnings and citations to people 
with unleashed dogs, mountain bikers on the horse and hiking trails, and 
transients living outside the authorized camping areas. Police have caught 
drunken and disorderly visitors and even flashers after the riders radioed in 
their descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
The unit's presence alone serves to discourage activities such as 
spray-painting graffiti on rocks and trees, said Patrick Phillips, 32, a 
three-year member who patrols areas in the northern Arroyo Seco such as Oak 
Grove Park and Devil's Gate Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our main objective is to sort of police, not so much with guns and 
clubs but with eyes and ears," Phillips said. "We're out there to create a 
presence and to try to deter any activities that would make the arroyo 
undesirable." 
</P>
<P>
Members are issued a hat, shirt, belt and saddle blanket bearing the 
blue-and-gold emblems of the Pasadena Police Department, but receive no other 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Each equestrian patrols the Arroyo Seco an average of 30 hours a month during 
spring and summer, when public use of the arroyo peaks. 
</P>
<P>
The unit seeks recruits who are at least 21 years old, know how to ride and 
have access to a horse, although some unit members will share their mounts, 
said Lt. Betsy Bour, the unit's highest-ranking volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants should call the administrative section of the Pasadena Police 
Department. They must complete an interview and submit to a thorough background 
check. 
</P>
<P>
Horses must also prove that they are qualified for the work. "Some horses just 
don't do well on the trail at all," Bour said. "Some horses have done only ring 
work, and out on the trail every blowing branch scares them." 
</P>

Human members of the unit say the patrols give them a lot of satisfaction.

"I enjoy riding with the group. It's good exercise," said Zimmerman, a retired 
tool-and-die maker from San Gabriel. "And you feel like you're providing a 
service to the community, (and) at the same time enjoying it. . . . Most of the 
people are glad to see us coming. They appreciate us being there."

After gangs, drugs and alcohol became a way of life, David Mendenhall decided 
it was time to make a change. 
</P>
<P>
The road to sobriety has not been an easy one, but with determination 
Mendenhall has been clean and sober for the past year and a half. In honor of 
his turnaround, the Culver City Council presented him with a commendation and 
proclaimed Nov. 26 David Mendenhall Day. 
</P>
<P>
Mendenhall, 19, who lives in Culver City, said the biggest lesson he's learned 
is the importance of time and how to work with it even when times are hard. "I 
want to set a good example," he said. "I want to be someone who has made a 
difference in the community." He also attributes the turnaround to his 
involvement with the American Youth Awards program. Since 1973, the program has 
honored and awarded youths who have made positive impressions and achievements 
in society. At Saturday night's 1990 American Youth Awards ceremony at the 
Culver City Auditorium, Mendenhall was the recipient of the organization's 
highest award, the Founder's Award, given to a youth with a negative past who 
has turned his life around. 
</P>
<P>
He also wrote and produced a play for the evening. "I took my own life 
experiences and put it into a play, which will hopefully inspire other kids to 
make better lives for themselves," he said. "Every kid has a chance and they 
just have to take it."

The West Los Angeles/Brentwood Rotary Club presented Alvin Mills with the Paul 
Harris Medal for outstanding community service. 
</P>
<P>
In 1952, Mills founded the Brentwood-Westwood Symphony and has been conducting 
it for 38 years. 
</P>
<P>
He was recently honored at the Rotary Club's annual Maurice Buerge Community 
Recognition Luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Simon has been selected as the 1990 Man of the Year by the Los Angeles 
Men's ORT Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Simon will receive the award at the 11th Annual Chanukah Brunch on Dec. 9 at 
the Bel Age Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica resident Dr. Eugene Nebeker has been selected as the 1990 
California Conservation Farmer of the Year by the National Endowment for Soil 
and Water Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
The award is given in each of the 50 states in recognition of good soil and 
water resources management, as well as for prevention of air and water 
pollution from agriculture and for assisting others in learning how to protect 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Nebeker, a graduate of Stanford University and Caltech, has a ranch in 
Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Rappaport, a senior at Beverly Hills High School, has been recognized for 
outstanding performance in writing by the National Council of Teachers in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of more than 800 national winners of a 1990 Achievement Award in 
Writing from the Council.

PANEL OFTEN DOWN FOR COUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's hard to get a quorum for meetings of the Significant Ecological Areas 
Technical Advisory Committee, also known as SEATAC. Keeping a quorum is harder 
still, because members sometimes must excuse themselves to avoid conflicts of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
The obscure panel's seven members advise planning officials on development 
projects in the county's 61 Significant Ecological Areas and recommend design 
features to reduce environmental damage. 
</P>
<P>
SEATAC recommendations are based partly on biota reports submitted by 
consultants hired by developers. But in many cases, SEATAC members, four of 
whom are full- or part-time environmental consultants, must disqualify 
themselves because they have financial ties to the consulting firms submitting 
the reports. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the conflicts involve a single SEATAC member: the panel's current 
chairman, Dick Friesen. 
</P>
<P>
Friesen, a biologist, works for Michael Brandman Associates, a large 
environmental consulting firm based in Santa Ana that is retained on some of 
the biggest projects planned for Significant Ecological Areas. 
</P>
<P>
So many developers hire Brandman that Friesen must excuse himself at least once 
at almost every meeting. He was particularly silent at a June, 1989, meeting 
when six projects were discussed, four involving Brandman. 
</P>
<P>
Friesen is highly regarded by fellow panel members and county planning staff 
who serve as liaisons to SEATAC. 
</P>
<P>
SEATAC members are unpaid volunteers and there is no line forming to replace 
them, said Pamela Holt, a section head with the county Department of Regional 
Planning. Friesen's situation "is something that . . . we're monitoring 
closely," Holt said. Planners would "like to keep him a member as long as it 
isn't a problem," 
</P>
<P>
SEATAC member Gary Wallace, a botanist with the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Natural History, called Friesen a "crackerjack person" and said conflicts have 
"never been a problem at all." 
</P>
<P>
A dissenting view, however, was expressed by Carlyle W. Hall Jr., a Los Angeles 
attorney who has sued the county several times in land-use disputes. He 
described the Friesen situation as unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the guy tries to do a good job, but it's a very obvious conflict," 
Hall said. Even when Friesen disqualifies himself, as chairman he has "some 
impact on the overall process implicitly, if not explicitly," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said it is also possible that some developers retain Brandman "because 
they know that the Brandman guy is chairman" of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't help that perception, if that perception is there, but I don't think 
that's why people hire us," Friesen said. He said it is Brandman's size and 
prominence that ensures it a steady stream of clients. 
</P>
<P>
Friesen said Brandman's clients do not get favorable treatment. "I think SEATAC 
is harder on us than they are on anybody else. . . . They expect more from us," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
On this point, the evidence is inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
During the past year, SEATAC drafted memos to county planners recommending 
rejection of two projects of Brandman clients that it regarded as highly 
destructive of ecological areas: a big housing and golf course project in the 
Valley Oaks Savannah area in Valencia and a residential tract in the Palo 
Comado area in Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a report prepared by Friesen on the impact of a project on 
an endangered species of ground squirrel in the Lovejoy Butte area in the 
Antelope Valley helped a developer win approval for a small subdivision there. 
Friesen recommended that the project be approved with the condition that the 
developer do a further study on the ground squirrel before getting a grading 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
Friesen disqualified himself, SEATAC accepted his recommendation, and the 
project was approved last May.

LANCASTER: LOWER-PRICED HOUSING ORIGINALLY BROUGHT EXPLOSIVE GROWTH TO THIS 
ANTELOPE VALLEY CITY, DOUBLING ITS POPULATION.

When he was a teen-ager, Larry Lake's family moved to Lancaster. Forty-five 
years later, he still lives there. Lake, semi-retired, and his wife, Joan, 
raised four children in the community on their 300-acre farm. 
</P>
<P>
Lake stayed in Lancaster because of the climate and the people. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the climate in Lancaster is better year-round than in most parts of 
the country," he said. "I enjoy the touch of four seasons we experience. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't beat the people here. Many of them relocated to the area from 
the Midwest and brought their conservative Midwestern values with them. It's a 
friendly hard-working type of community." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakes built their three-bedroom, three-bath home in 1959 for $30,000. The 
house is on the parcel that he used to operate as an alfalfa farm before he 
sold it. Lake currently oversees the operation of the farm for the new owners 
and their crop -- onions. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster, located in the high desert about 56 miles northeast of Los Angeles, 
is one of the two major cities in the Antelope Valley. The other is Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale is the first Antelope Valley community encountered when traveling 
north from Los Angeles on California 14 (the Antelope Valley Freeway). 
Lancaster is eight miles farther north. 
</P>
<P>
Both cities experienced a phenomenal rate of growth in the past 10 years. 
Lancaster had the third largest growth rate of Los Angeles County cities (98%), 
behind only Palmdale (432%) and Walnut (132%). 
</P>
<P>
While Palmdale is the older of the two cities, Lancaster's population is now 
larger, almost doubling from 48,027 residents in 1980 to 95,101 residents in 
the preliminary 1990 census figures. Palmdale's population rose from 12,297 
residents in 1980 to 65,357 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The recent population explosion in Lancaster may be primarily attributed to the 
affordability of housing in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"In mid-August, the median price for a new attached home was $102,251, and the 
median price for a new detached home was $139,971," Dirk Kittridge said. 
Kittridge is a market analyst for the Meyers Group, an Encino real estate 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
There are many housing options in Lancaster. As of August, there were 54 new 
developments on the market, Kittridge said. Among the major developers are West 
Venture, Hillside Residential, the Larwin Co. and Cambridge Development. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some good deals to be had in Lancaster -- more amenities at a lower 
price," Kittridge said. 
</P>
<P>
The resale market in Lancaster also offers affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Average resale is running around $110,000 to $120,000," said Jim DeBruyn, 
owner of Re/Max Antelope Valley realtors. "The price range for a single-family 
home is running from about $90,000 to $400,000 plus. 
</P>
<P>
"At the low end you're going to get a two- or three-bedroom, one- or two-bath 
home with an average of 1,000 or 1,100 square feet. Someone at the high end is 
going to get a custom home, anywhere from three to six bedrooms, two or more 
bathrooms and 2,500-plus square feet." 
</P>
<P>
Apartment are available as well, with small studio units starting at $345 and 
two-bedroom, two-bath townhouses with two-car attached garages starting at 
$655. 
</P>
<P>
Affordability was the main reason the Wes Clay family moved to Lancaster from 
Brea. "I could buy a new home here for less than what I sold my 33-year-old 
Orange County home for," Clay said. 
</P>
<P>
Clay, his wife, Kathleen, and their three children moved into their new house 
in September. They purchased a 2,050 square foot home with four bedrooms, three 
baths and a two-car garage for $160,000. 
</P>
<P>
Like one-third of his neighbors, Clay is a commuter. As a sales representative 
for the Square D Co., an electrical manufacturer, he travels to the San 
Fernando Valley, downtown Los Angeles and once a week to City of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
While driving more than 100 miles a day might deter some prospective residents 
from the area, the commute doesn't bother Clay. 
</P>
<P>
"Lancaster is part of my territory, I was driving out here twice a week 
anyway," he said. "I like the atmosphere here -- it's friendly and outgoing. I 
like the clean air, larger sized yards, and the neighbors are great. What more 
could you ask for?" 
</P>
<P>
The first inhabitants of the Antelope Valley were Piute Indians; they shared 
the land with herds of antelope that once roamed the foothills. Lt. Pedro Gages 
was believed to be the first white man to cross the valley in pursuit of 
deserters from the Spanish navy in 1772. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1860s, as the Southern Pacific Railroad completed its line through the 
valley, the first settlers arrived. The railroad gave the area's farmers an 
opportunity to ship produce quickly and economically. 
</P>
<P>
In 1884, M. L. Wickes, a Los Angeles real estate entrepreneur, founded the 
community of Lancaster, naming the settlement for his Pennsylvania birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
The 1930s brought the Army Air Corps to Muroc Dry Lake, which eventually became 
Edwards Air Force Base. The nearby Air Force base, with the later addition of 
the Air Force Test Center, became a major influence in Lancaster's economy, 
employing more than 14,000 civilians and military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Increased government defense spending changed the character of Lancaster and 
the Antelope Valley in the 1950s as the area became a major center for aircraft 
manufacturing and related activities. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop opened its Palmdale plant in 1952, while Lockheed, Rockwell 
International and the Douglas Division of McDonnell Douglas established plants 
in the Antelope Valley in the late '60s and early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
The growth of the aerospace industry there resulted in rapid residential growth 
for Lancaster. Census figures show a 19% growth rate in Lancaster between 1960 
and 1970, and a 55% growth rate between 1970 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The growth ended agriculture's days as the dominant land use in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"Alfalfa farming used to be a major crop in Lancaster, but water became too 
costly to support it," Lake said. "Less farming means more dust, so it has 
become a little more uncomfortable out here." 
</P>
<P>
Added resident Lynn Harrison: 
</P>
<P>
"From a physical standpoint, the worst thing about the area is living with all 
the dust. The wind has always been a problem out here, and with all the 
development and construction it (the dust) has gotten worse." 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, a contract consultant, has lived in Lancaster since 1969. She 
recently retired from the City Council after serving eight years, including two 
terms as mayor of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Her family moved to the Antelope Valley in 1955 and she decided to stay because 
"I grew up here, my roots are in the community," she said. "I especially like 
the atmosphere here, it's so different from metropolitan Los Angeles. I think 
it's a great place to raise a family." 
</P>
<P>
Harrison lives with her two sons in a two-story home she purchased in 1974 for 
$41,000. The house has three bedrooms, three baths and a two-car garage. 
</P>
<P>
The former mayor is concerned about the changes in the community. "The 
community is in a state of dramatic change," she said. "We're starting to feel 
urban ills -- crime, drugs, gangs and smog." 
</P>
<P>
The crime rate in Lancaster is normal for a growing community, according to 
deputy Michael Grimes of the Antelope Valley station of the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department. "There are more crimes reported, but that's only because 
of the population growth," he said. "Statistically, the crime rate hasn't 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Gangs are a reality, just as they are anywhere else in Southern California. We 
have five people working full time on gang detail to nip it in the bud." 
</P>
<P>
Harrison is confident that Lancaster residents can solve their problems. "This 
is a strong-minded community," she said. "(The people) are active -- they won't 
turn away from the problems -- they'll band together to fight them." 
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth in Lancaster is regarded as a mixed blessing by some 
residents, among them Tony Maglothin, 35, the manager of a Dal Tile warehouse 
and showroom in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
"The tremendous growth has been good for business," Maglothin said. "It makes 
us (Lancaster) more self-sufficient, but we may become overgrown." 
</P>
<P>
Maglothin moved to the community from the San Fernando Valley four years ago to 
open the tile store. Last June, after being a renter, he purchased his first 
home in Lancaster. It is a three-bedroom, one-bath house with a three-car 
garage; he paid $110,000 for it. 
</P>
<P>
He likes the area because of its small-town atmosphere. "It's quieter, 
friendlier, and there's no smog," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse and Bettye Davis moved to Lancaster in 1981 when he retired from the Air 
Force. They purchased a four-bedroom, two-bath home with a two-car garage for 
$108,000. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, 57, and his wife, 53, came to the area because he had accepted a job 
with Northrop. He is a parts manager and commutes to Gardena, a drive that 
takes him over an hour each way. Bettye Davis, a supervisor in management and 
procedures, travels north to Edwards Air Force Base and also teaches dance 
classes at Studio 81 in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
They don't like a lot of the changes they've seen in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many people now, too many houses," Jesse Davis said. "People 
don't know you any more, even the clerks don't know you by name." 
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere you look, they are putting up houses," added Bettye Davis. "Seems 
like they've allowed building on every corner." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have enough traffic lights," said Jesse Davis. "Even at 4:10 a.m. 
when I go to work, I am waiting in traffic."

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: HOMEOWNER HAS ONGOING BATTLE WITH DISTANT LOAN SERVICING 
FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Robert J. Bruss is a San Francisco-area lawyer, author and 
real estate broker 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Our home mortgage is less than 2 years old, but it has been sold 
three times. We now have to make loan payments to a loan servicer in a small 
Texas town I've never heard of and where the Pony Express apparently delivers 
the mail once a week. This company claims our escrow impound account was 
under-funded by $454, which we were asked to pay in a lump sum. 
</P>
<P>
When we refused, the lender agreed we can spread out the extra payments over 12 
months. But for the last two months we have been assessed late charges even 
though I mail our mortgage payment on the first day of the month. The loan 
company says our payment is due by the first, even though there is a 15-day 
grace period. What can we do about these mortgage problems? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Your situation is not uncommon. The sale of home mortgage servicing is 
a multibillion dollar unregulated business. Abuse by loan servicers is 
shocking, yet Congress refuses to step in. To make matters worse, some loan 
servicers do not have toll free phone numbers and require borrowers to write 
all complaints, which often go unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
It sounds like your loan servicer is playing the "late payment scam" on you by 
claiming your payments are not received until after the 15-day grace period 
expires. Yes, it is true your loan payment is "due" on the first day of the 
month, but most lenders give a 10- or 15-day grace period. As long as your 
payment is received within the grace period, the lender cannot give an adverse 
credit rating on you. Some of the biggest loan servicers plan this late payment 
scam. The only way to protect yourself is to get a proof of mailing receipt at 
the post office or send your payments via certified mail with a return receipt 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
As for the escrow impound account rip-off, that is another tactic some loan 
servicers use to increase balances in borrower impound accounts for property 
taxes and insurance. The best you can do is double check the loan servicer's 
estimates of required payments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What Is the 'Catch' on a Lease Option? 
</P>
<P>
Q: In the school district where we want to buy a home, there is an oversupply 
of new and resale homes. The ads of several realty agents and builders say 
"lease option." One agent advertises "rent to own, all rent applies toward 
purchase price." It sounds too good to be true. What is the catch? 
</P>
<P>
A: A lease with option to purchase can be a very good deal for both home buyer 
and seller. But the buyer should watch out for an inflated option price which 
is above the fair market value for the home. Be sure to check comparable sales 
prices to be certain the option price is not too high. 
</P>
<P>
Although you will not receive any income tax deductions until you purchase the 
home, the 100% rent credit toward the purchase price is a major benefit that 
more than offsets the lack of tax deductions. For further details, please 
consult your tax adviser or attorney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retiree Appreciates 2nd Mortgage Income 
</P>
<P>
Q: I started reading your columns years ago when I used to live near 
Washington, D.C. You said it is smart to buy real estate when you are young and 
when you are old sell it on installment sales and carry back mortgages for 
retirement income. 
</P>
<P>
That is what I did about five years ago. Every month the payments come in like 
clockwork. But a few months ago one of my buyers was going to pay off my loan. 
I had to talk fast, but I persuaded her not to pay me off. Where else could I 
earn such high interest? 
</P>
<P>
A: I greatly appreciate your sharing that success story. When I sell property I 
love to carry back a first or second mortgage for the income. Once in a while, 
if the buyer doesn't make the payments, I have to foreclose and either get paid 
off at the foreclosure sale or get the property back to sell for a second 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
I can't understand why more property sellers don't help finance their buyer's 
purchases. Sorry, I don't know any place else you can earn as high interest as 
you can by financing a real estate sale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Praise for Eager New Real Estate Agent 
</P>
<P>
Q: A young real estate agent had been "farming" our neighborhood for several 
months, so we decided to give him the listing. I think it was his only listing, 
so he really worked hard. 
</P>
<P>
He got lots of other agents to tour our home, even served them fancy food. 
Every week his company ran nice ads for his Sunday open houses. And he 
delivered flyers to our neighbors about our home being for sale. It turned out 
one of the neighbors had a friend who wanted to move to our neighborhood, so we 
sold our home to her. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of my letter is to let you know sometimes the new agents work 
harder than the old-timers. I know you advocate listing with experienced agents 
who have good references, but don't you think it pays to give the new kid a 
try? 
</P>
<P>
A: Of course. Occasionally, I get irate letters from new real estate agents who 
criticize me for recommending home sellers interview at least three local real 
estate agents before selecting the best one. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that interview process involves phoning each agent's client references 
to ask, "Were you in any way unhappy with your agent and would you list with 
the same agent again?" I still think that is the best way to select an agent. 
But, of course, there are exceptions to every rule. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Carpenter Can't Get Construction Loan 
</P>
<P>
Q: For the last 12 years I have been a union carpenter. My wife and I bought a 
nice lot where we want to build our new home. We have about $25,000 cash, but 
we need a construction loan to finance our house until we can get a permanent 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
We have contacted at least 20 lenders about construction loans. None will loan 
to us because I am not a licensed contractor and I want to do all the 
sub-contracting without hiring a general contractor. Any ideas how I can get a 
construction loan? 
</P>
<P>
A: Look at your situation from the lender's viewpoint. You may be a great 
carpenter, but the lender is worried that you will run into trouble on the 
construction project which you can't handle. The possibilities are endless. 
</P>
<P>
As a remodeler of older homes who hires licensed general contractors, I know 
even the experts with many years of experience often run into unexpected 
problems. Fortunately, they are always able to solve them (usually with more 
money!). 
</P>
<P>
But lenders are reluctant to loan to non-licensed do-it-yourself home builders. 
I suggest you hire a general contractor to supervise your home building, so you 
can get a construction loan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prospective Seller Seeks Market Forecast 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have owned our home many years and are thinking of selling, perhaps early 
in 1991. Is there any rule of thumb as to how much home prices are expected to 
appreciate in the next 12 months? Our home has been our best investment, so we 
are wondering if we should sell or if you expect home prices to go up 
substantially next year? 
</P>
<P>
A: I have no idea how much home prices might appreciate in the next year. If 
you find a person who knows for sure, please let me know. Nationally, home 
prices have appreciated about 5% annually in recent years. But that includes 
appreciation of 20% to 30% annually in some areas, as well as major declines in 
states such as Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
In the current buyer's market which prevails in most of the nation, home prices 
are stagnant or rising only slightly. If you have a good reason to sell next 
spring, that should be a good time to sell. But if you have no compelling 
reason to sell, then you might be better off keeping your home. Sorry, I can't 
be of more help, but real estate is a very local industry, so it is difficult 
to give specific answers to a general question. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beware the Seller Who Offers No-Down Loan 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am 26 and anxious to earn real estate profits. At a property management 
class I met an elderly gentleman who owns several downtown apartment buildings 
which are very management intense. His tenants are retirees, welfare 
recipients, drunks and even a few prostitutes. The gentleman offered to sell me 
one of his buildings for nothing down (he knows I don't have any money) and 
says he will carry back a second mortgage for his equity at 5% interest. The 
building will break even if I can keep the vacancy rate below 10%. Do you think 
this is a good or bad deal? 
</P>
<P>
A: Please be careful. That "nothing down" offer might be too good to be true. 
If you decide to go ahead, be sure there is no personal recourse on the second 
mortgage. I presume the existing first mortgage has no due-on-sale clause. If 
it does, forget the sale because it could be very dangerous to buy subject to a 
first mortgage with a legally-enforceable due-on-sale clause. Consult a real 
estate attorney for more details.

CELEBRITY BATHROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading "Hot Property" over the last few months we have a question. 
</P>
<P>
Why is it these (so-called) celebrities always seem to buy homes that have more 
bathrooms than bedrooms? Is it possible these wealthy celebrities all have 
bladder problems? 
</P>
<P>
In these days when there are so many people sleeping in the streets, it seems 
obscene and disgusting for anyone to own such huge homes. These people could 
try to help others more and spend less on their ridiculously huge homes.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week: 
</P>
<P>
* Allow fuchsias to rest from now until February when you would prune them 
back. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't rush on lifting dahlias. Foliage should be allowed to ripen off and 
turn yellow, or the bulbs will be robbed of energy for next year's growth. 
</P>
<P>
* Sweet alyssum can be sown from seed over bulb beds; they'll bloom with the 
bulbs next spring. 
</P>
<P>
* Cool-season perennial vegetables can be planted now -- artichokes, asparagus 
and rhubarb.

HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: RULES PERMIT LOWER LOAD FACTOR FOR ATTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Three years ago, I acquired an English-style, 1 1/2-story all-brick, 
all-plaster house, 50 years old and in excellent condition. There is a full 
attic with a catwalk in the center. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to finish the attic, but it only has 2-by-6-inch ceiling joists, 
16 inches on center. I am told the joists have to be at least 2-by-8 inches, 16 
inches on center, before rooms can be added. 
</P>
<P>
First, why were houses like this built, and what's the remedy? Can I do most of 
the work myself? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: In house design, the size of the floor joists depends on the distance 
between the joist supports (span), the on-center distance between the joists 
(usually 16 inches on center), the species of wood the joists are made of and 
the loading applied to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
In residential structures, the floor loading is usually designed for a live 
load of 40 pounds per square foot, with attic floors designed for loading of 20 
pounds per square foot. A live load is the load that is imposed solely by 
occupancy (persons, furnishings and appliances). 
</P>
<P>
The attic's design load is less than the load for habitable rooms because the 
attic is normally not used for storing heavy appliances or furniture. Hence, 
ceiling joists are often smaller than the floor joists below. 
</P>
<P>
In determining joist size for a given span, architects use tables that consider 
bending stress, deflection and stiffness (in order to minimize the springiness 
in the floor). Your floor joists are sufficient for a 40-pound-per-square-foot 
floor, providing their unsupported span does not exceed 9 feet, 6 inches 
(approximately). 
</P>
<P>
To finish the attic properly, you would first need a building permit. Your 
local municipal building department will probably require you to have plans 
drawn by a registered architect or approved by a licensed professional 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difference Between De-Icing Materials 
</P>
<P>
Q: With a large variety of walkway de-icers on the market, could you tell me 
the major differences between them, and which would be the safest for concrete? 
</P>
<P>
A: According to the Portland Cement Assn., the safest de-icers for concrete are 
also the most common: sodium chloride (rock salt) and calcium chloride. Both of 
these de-icers rust metal, and sodium chloride damages vegetation while calcium 
chloride does not. 
</P>
<P>
The association recommends against using on concrete those de-icers that 
contain ammonium nitrate or ammonium sulfates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paints Product Lasts Longer on Aluminum 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a home with finished aluminum soffits, fascias, gutters and window 
trim. I would like to paint these a different color. Is this possible? And, if 
so, will I be repainting every four years and lose out on the benefits of 
aluminum trim? 
</P>
<P>
A: Not to worry. PPG Industries has a latex paint specifically formulated for 
repainting prefinished aluminum siding and trim. It's called Metal Siding 
Refinish, and comes in a variety of colors to match current popular siding 
colors. If the surface is prepared correctly and the paint properly applied, it 
will last for about 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brown Spots on Deck Will Not Wash Away 
</P>
<P>
Q: Dark brown spots are appearing in areas of my concrete deck. They don't wash 
away with soap and water. What causes these spots? 
</P>
<P>
A: The type of discoloration you describe occurs when tricalcium 
alumino-ferride -- the agent that gives portland cement its gray color -- has 
not reacted thoroughly with the other chemicals in concrete. To remove the dark 
spots, try pouring on undiluted household vinegar. If that doesn't work, try a 
solution of one part muratic acid to 30 parts water. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dirty Streaks Mar Siding of House 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have been unable to find anything that will clean the accumulation of 
dirt and other particles on our aluminum siding. It seems the siding is clean 
from about 4 to 5 feet down from the eaves. Above that, the siding seems to 
have a rough or granular surface that will not wash off with a sponge and 
laundry detergent. What is the best way to handle this problem? 
</P>
<P>
A: Stubborn soils start at the bottom and work up. This keeps hard-to-remove 
dirty streaks from running down the wall below the dirty under-eave area. After 
cleaning and washing, it's important that the siding be thoroughly flushed with 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Special siding cleaners, available at your local hardware store can help. 
Mildew, which appears as black spots, usually shows up in areas isolated from 
rainfall. Try using a solution of one-quart Clorox, one-half cup of 
non-abrasive detergent and two-thirds cup of trisodium phosphate. Rinse the 
area with your garden hose after washing it.

TUCSON: TWO WAYS; 
</P>
<P>
AT TWO ARIZONA RESORTS, WOULD-BE WRANGLERS AND POOLSIDE SYBARITES CAN PLAY IN 
BOTH THE OLD AND NEW WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HULSE, TIMES TRAVEL COLUMNIST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TUCSON, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dust off the Bentley, Oliver. Polish the Rolls. Fire up the Mercedes. And while 
you're at it, saddle up the Mustang. 
</P>
<P>
It's roundup time in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed it is the season when Easterners jet west to escape the cold and 
Westerners gather in Arizona in search of serenity. And although old Tucson is 
no more -- when in heaven's name did the cow town become a city? -- the earlier 
peacefulness still exists, although one must search it out, beyond the bright 
lights and into the haunting silence of the desert itself. 
</P>
<P>
In this pursuit, one faces decisions: Join the Bentley crowd at a luxury 
resort? Or boot up and ride off into the sunset with the Levi Strauss gang? The 
only concern with the latter is that the options have been critically reduced. 
</P>
<P>
No longer does Tucson claim the title of "Dude Ranch Capital of the West," as 
was the case in the '50s and '60s when would-be Hopalong Cassidys gathered at 
35 guest ranches, this during a period when Tucson folded at sunset -- save for 
a few grungy saloons. Afterward, tract homes, huge office buildings and chic 
resorts began choking off the ranches until today only three major ranches 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
While drawn to the sybaritic pleasures of the new West recently, I found myself 
mourning the lost harmony of the old West. Confronted with a choice (old or 
new), I decided to compare Westin's palatial La Paloma resort with Tucson's 
premier guest ranch, Tanque Verde, a peaceful plot where dawns arrive with the 
silence of a falling leaf and night skies are misty with stars. 
</P>
<P>
Before shifting to old Tucson, I checked in at La Paloma, which is near the 
foothills of the Santa Catalina Mountains. One of Tucson's newest resorts, the 
$100-million hotel is wrapped around a swimming pool, with lush gardens that 
give the impression that an oasis of exquisite beauty had evolved quite 
naturally from the Sonoran Desert. 
</P>
<P>
One drifts off to sleep listening to the shrill cry of distant coyotes as well 
as the moan of the wind and a chorus of crickets just outside the window. La 
Paloma is a low-rise resort whose adobe-colored walls blend with the land, 
which is in startling contrast to the green of fairways. Last evening, clouds 
boiled on the horizon, ignited by the setting sun. Later it rained, so that by 
morning the atmosphere was flawless, pure and clear to the horizon and, it 
would seem, to the the very brink of eternity itself. 
</P>
<P>
Today a bobcat skittered ahead of me as I strolled at dusk across a golf green. 
In its path a couple of coyotes sprinted down the fairway, disappearing in a 
mesquite-lined gully, while in another corner of this verdant oasis a family of 
cottontails nibbled on the grass, much to the annoyance of the greenskeepers. 
</P>
<P>
This is not unusual, this sighting of wildlife at La Paloma. Earlier, an 
acquaintance came eyeball-to-eyeball with another bobcat on another fairway, 
which is evidence that the wilderness and wildlife remain, even at a luxury 
resort rising dead center out of wide-open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Westin's La Paloma is a village-like setting, its 28 adobe units containing 487 
rooms, five restaurants and three bars. There are jogging trails and a dozen 
tennis courts, four that are clay. Mariachis entertain at poolside and romantic 
melodies spill forth from a piano bar with cathedral windows that frame both 
desert and mountains. 
</P>
<P>
To make room for the construction of La Paloma, thousands of saguaro cacti were 
transplanted out to the desert along with prickly pear and other growth native 
to the Sonoran Desert: the spindly ocotillo, barrel cactus and dozens of 
mesquite trees, which in turn are surrounded by brittlebush, desert marigolds 
and Arizona poppies. 
</P>
<P>
In such a setting, guests hike nature trails and hitch rides on golf carts, 
photographing this flora and fauna that appears barely 25 minutes from the 
skyscrapers of downtown Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
At La Paloma, as well as the Loews Ventana and Sheraton's El Conquistador, a 
battalion of concierges order up limousines for trips to the old Western towns 
of Tombstone and Bisbee, as well as tours by hot-air balloon above the desert. 
</P>
<P>
La Paloma claims the distinction of being Arizona's only resort to employ 
forecaddies, which is to say young men and women who scamper ahead of players 
to shag wayward balls and perform other services intended to speed one's game. 
At La Paloma, chef Neil McLaren, formerly of the Arizona Biltmore and later the 
Century Plaza in Los Angeles, turns out a variety of delights ranging from eggs 
on a corn tortilla with tomato salsa and sour cream to New Zealand green lip 
mussels; shrimp with cilantro and tequila; scallops with caramelized shallots 
and baby corn; pork medallions with corn cakes, and poached salmon in apple 
cider. McLaren receives raves for his gulf snapper with black bean salsa, his 
grilled petrale sole in tarragon butter and duck breast with blackberry sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Enough. 
</P>
<P>
After having been smitten by the good life at La Paloma, it was time to move on 
to Bob Cote's Tanque Verde Guest Ranch. The road leading to its entrance is 
lined with miles of mesquite, and dust devils spin on the horizon. Of the 
surviving ranches, Tanque Verde is locked in a time warp -- a former stop on 
the Butterfield Coach Line and a one-time cattle ranch with more than a million 
acres of wilderness abutting its fences: the Sahuaro National Monument and 
Coronado Forest, which is its salvation from developers. 
</P>
<P>
At this family-oriented ranch, guests return annually -- both from the United 
States and overseas. Paul McCartney became so infatuated with Tanque Verde that 
he built a home nearby; the late Christina Onassis spent days soul-searching 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Passing through the gate, I could feel the stress peel away. I was led to a 
casita on the 640-acre spread, a place that's disturbed only by the occasional 
cry of a coyote, where deer graze at one's door and owls peer from the skeletal 
arms of desert trees. 
</P>
<P>
In the lounge, guests gather in front of a crackling wood fire, while in the 
distance, across miles of darkness, the lights of Tucson wink back -- as they 
do at La Paloma. The room hums with conversation. Languages blend. 
Shizue-Kobayashi of Japan, who is on her fifth visit to Tanque Verde, tells in 
broken English how the West has woven its spell. A couple from Sweden -- 
Kenneth and Ingrid Lindstrom -- confide how they've discovered an elusive 
contentment on this, their fourth visit. Others from Denmark, England and 
Switzerland join in conversation 
</P>
<P>
A photographer from Minnesota, who has been coming to Tanque Verde since she 
was a child, has vacationed here 43 times; some guests are descended from 
second and third generations of vacationers. One couple from Chicago spends 
three months each winter thawing out at Tanque Verde. 
</P>
<P>
Tanque Verde satisfies a mental image most vacationers, especially those from 
other countries, have of the West; they see it as a carbon copy of a Hollywood 
Western. 
</P>
<P>
Sheri Sandmann, a court reporter from Akron, Ohio, visited Tanque Verde for the 
first time last spring. Home only two weeks, she booked a second trip, this 
time with her parents. The peacefulness of Tanque Verde, she says, was like a 
drug. "I was attracted by the scenery and the quiet -- the wildlife that came 
daily to my door." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago artist Tamara Morrison is making mental images of these scenes that she 
intends to transfer to canvas. 
</P>
<P>
While the casitas are rustic outside, inside they offer the comfort of resort 
life. Proprietor Bob Cote decided early on that after a day on the trail, even 
his most macho guest longs for a hot shower and a comfortable bed. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are exceptions. On a recent pack trip, a group of 140 Frenchmen 
chose to sleep under the stars following a nonstop flight from Paris to Tucson. 
Besides riding, guests at Tanque Verde play tennis and paddle about in indoor 
and outdoor swimming pools while others boil away saddle aches in a sauna and a 
Jacuzzi. 
</P>
<P>
Open year-round, Tanque Verde attracts foreign guests even during the heat of 
summer. Germans in particular are hooked by the Western way of life, telling 
how back home they pitch tents and tepees in the Black Forest in preparation 
for their Arizona adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Equally enthusiastic are the Italians, who take to the trails like John Wayne 
bearing down on a pack of cattle rustlers. Cote describes the Italians as both 
loud and lovable, and tells how they take over the microphone during a cookout 
quicker than a fast-draw artist performing in a celluloid shoot-out. 
</P>
<P>
Tanque Verde appears like a page from a Western novel. An Arizona treasure -- 
it gets a rave in Thomas Cook's "Three Hundred Best Hotels in the World" -- the 
ranch welcomed its first guest in the '30s. Since then, Cote has installed 
wood-burning fireplaces and forced air heating to check the morning chill at 
2,800 feet. He also installed a chef who turns out a noontime buffet featuring 
hot entrees, 15 salads, marvelous soups and a shameful dessert table created 
expressly for chocoholics. 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect rustic, family-style dining here. In a departure from the norm at 
other ranches, guests at Tanque Verde choose from a dinner menu featuring three 
entrees that change daily, seven days a week. Recent menus listed roast 
duckling a l'orange with a Grand Marnier sauce, roast prime rib, leg of lamb, 
New Zealand white fish, chicken Kiev, scallops in garlic butter and a broiled 
fillet of salmon in a bearnaise sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Diners take their meals at individual tables. Candlelight. Flowers. Romance. 
It's the Tanque Verde touch. 
</P>
<P>
Besides cookouts, riding and shopping sprees into Tucson, guests help band 
birds to track migration patterns and join ex-Los Angeles zoo keeper Jerry 
Brewer on hikes into the mountains and across the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Brewer puts on weekly shows featuring live rattlesnakes and poisonous insects. 
A gung-ho man of the soil, Brewer had a supporting role in "Raiders of the Lost 
Ark." Later, he says, he lost a role in an English flick when studio moguls 
failed to pick up the air fare for 400 snakes that were to join him in London. 
</P>
<P>
Just the other day, Brewer sat for 20 minutes cradling a four-foot rattler in 
his arms. Later he watched amused as a pet tarantula crawled up his arm. 
</P>
<P>
That's fine, Brewer, but I've got a date with a new Stephen King novel, which 
is about as near danger as I intend to get. Play with your snakes and insects. 
I'll be by the swimming pool.

<P>
Ever think of spending Christmas at a hotel? It may not sound particularly 
festive, nor does it conjure up warm and cozy thoughts, pleasant memories or 
romantic notions of the holiday spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, you may be surprised to learn that many Americans do indeed celebrate the 
Christmas holidays in hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Why? First, the price is right. With few exceptions, hotel occupancy between 
now and the middle of January is very low. This fact, coupled with a glut of 
hotel rooms in many cities from recent construction and a downturn in domestic 
travel, has created some great deals, many of which go beyond just a discounted 
room rate. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, it's a slow time for business travel," says W. Andrews Kirmse, 
vice president and general manager of the Nikko Hotel in San Francisco, "so 
we're trying to lure the leisure traveler and his or her family during 
December. It's a trend and a major emphasis for us." 
</P>
<P>
In Dallas, the Loews Anatole Hotel has a special holiday rate of $78 per night, 
single or double occupancy, through Dec. 30. In San Francisco, room rates at 
the upscale Huntington Hotel have been dropped to $195 for a suite. And the 
Stouffer Stanford Court is offering a special holiday season package with a 
$149 room rate now through Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
At the Checkers Hotel in Los Angeles, room rates start as low as $125 per night 
between Dec. 14 and 28. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for a real bargain? Between now and Feb. 25, Omni hotels are offering 
special weekend discount deals -- rooms from $59 to $99. And that's per room, 
not per person (the deal covers up to two adults and two children under 17). In 
addition, checkout can be extended to 5 p.m. on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best new hotel deal comes from Marriott, which just announced a $49 
Holiday Room Rate available between Dec. 13 and Jan. 6. Only two restrictions: 
Reservations must be made two weeks in advance, and most Marriotts will not be 
offering the rate on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Many hotels offer special room rates that also include Christmas shopping 
deals, transportation to stores, even free gift wrapping. 
</P>
<P>
The Stanford Court's $149 deal includes gift wrapping as well as transportation 
to downtown shopping in the hotel's Rolls-Royce limousine. Guests who stay two 
consecutive nights will receive a $25 gift certificate from Gump's. 
</P>
<P>
Similar discounted room/shopping programs are offered in San Francisco by the 
Four Seasons Clift, the Mandarin Oriental and by Campton Place. 
</P>
<P>
In New York City, the Parc 51 has discounted rooms to $195 per night on any 
weekend between now and Dec. 17 (and any night Dec. 17-30), and the hotel 
provides a free wrapping service between now and Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
The Westin Crown Center hotel in Kansas City has a great holiday package rate. 
From now until Dec. 30, guests can get a "Shopper's Holiday" room for $69 per 
night. Indeed, the hotel is surrounded by more than 60 shops and restaurants in 
the Crown Center. 
</P>
<P>
At some luxury hotels, almost all of the rooms are full during Christmas. 
Normally, finding a significant discount is next to impossible at the Regent 
Beverly Wilshire. During this Christmas season, however, the hotel has dropped 
its regular $255-a-night rate to $215. Not a tremendous discount, yet the hotel 
is booked to near capacity this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Staying at a hotel during Christmas is not exactly first on most people's 
lists," admits Beverly Wilshire spokesperson Georgiana Francisco. "But you'd be 
surprised how many locals elect to come here and stay for a few days during the 
holidays." 
</P>
<P>
Family tradition is a large part of the holiday activities offered by The Drake 
hotel in Chicago. Yuletide festivities take on a Dickens theme at the 
70-year-old hotel. Drake's holiday package is priced at $145 per night, double 
or single occupancy, and is available now until Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Guests will be treated to two weeks of Christmas entertainment in the hotel's 
Palm Court, including holiday choirs, madrigal singers, handbell choirs, 
carolers and a special puppet-show performance of the holiday classic "Hansel 
and Gretel." 
</P>
<P>
In Tucson, the Loews Ventana Canyon Resort celebrates the holidays 
Southwestern-style with a posada on Dec. 16. The hotel has also initiated a 
comprehensive children's holiday program for kids between the ages of 5 and 10 
that starts Dec. 26 and continues through Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
At Lake George, N.Y., the Omni Sagamore Hotel also features a children's 
program, which includes arts and crafts, sleigh rides and a nature scavenger 
hunt. The program runs Dec. 15-28. Rates begin at $85 per person, double 
occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
In Kansas City, for $20 more than its "Shopper's" package, the Westin also 
offers a special children's program, where parents can shop and the kids are 
supervised with an itinerary that includes a visit to the Hallmark card 
company, followed by Christmas cookie decorating, ornament-making and, of 
course, a visit to Santa. 
</P>
<P>
Other hotels offer special Christmas tours. The Ritz-Carlton in Boston is 
conducting reservations-only tours of its Victorian decorations, which are 
located in public areas as well as special suites. Guests entering the lobby 
are greeted by a six-foot Nutcracker King. Each of the hotel's restaurants will 
re-create one of the acts of the Nutcracker; check out the "battle of the toy 
soldiers" in the hotel cafe. And there will be daily appearances by carolers. 
</P>
<P>
But don't look for shopping deals and free gift wrapping at the Ritz-Carlton in 
Boston. "We tried it and it didn't work," says spokesperson Patricia Cutler. 
"People generally like to have their gifts wrapped by the stores where they 
bought them. We've learned that if people shop at Filene's, they want their 
packages wrapped there." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the great deals are in the United States. Despite a weakening dollar 
and higher fuel prices (or, perhaps because of it), a number of foreign 
airlines and hotels are also offering great holiday packages. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most important, there are the hotels that have embraced the truest 
sense of the Christmas spirit. The Middlebury Inn in Middlebury, Vt., has an 
annual teddy bear raffle. All the proceeds from the raffle go to a Christmas 
charity for underprivileged children. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Hotel in San Francisco is donating $15 from each guest's room 
rate -- in the guest's name -- to the Youth Advocate Charities. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing embodies the holiday spirit more than the "Room at the Inn" service 
offered by most Doubletree and some Compri hotels. Under the program, free 
accommodations are provided to individuals and families who are traveling out 
of town during the holiday season to visit hospitalized loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
"Room at the Inn" was an idea that started at the Doubletree Hotel in Seattle 
in 1982. Since then, it has expanded to include more than 32 Doubletree and 
Compri hotels. Each hotel has set aside a number of rooms to be used for the 
program between now and New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Doubletree gave away more than 1,500 rooms for this cause.

TOURISTS KNOW BALI AS A HOLIDAY DESTINATION, BUT FOR BALINESE THEIR ISLAND IS 
SIMPLY HEAVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN KESSLER, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
UBUD, Indonesia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The offering to the gods, made of vibrantly colored rice and shaped like a 
giant bird, soared more than 10 feet high. Scores of other offerings, built 
with pungent flowers, pork, vegetables, palm leaves, coconut, rice and colored 
fabrics, were scattered throughout the temple compound. 
</P>
<P>
Smoke from incense and Indonesian clove cigarettes drifted through the air as 
hundreds of the faithful, who had marched for several miles, poured through the 
temple gates -- 8-year-old girls in yellow silk and golden headdresses, boys 
banging drums and gongs, elegant young men in white and old women balancing 
stacks of gifts for their deities atop their heads. 
</P>
<P>
It was just another day on the island of Bali, the "Island of the Gods." 
</P>
<P>
Each year, more than 500,000 tourists visit this small island, which is among 
the premier tourist destinations in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the onslaught, the 3 million Balinese on the island have managed to 
preserve their culture and religion: Heaven, the Balinese believe, is exactly 
like Bali. 
</P>
<P>
My wife, Cindy, and I have spent several weeks in Bali during two trips to 
Indonesia. Every day some aspect of Balinese life has held us spellbound -- 
whether it was a temple ceremony, rice fields that carpet the landscape, a 
painting by an unrecognized talent, a dish of spicy food or just the beauty of 
the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, Bali isn't terribly expensive. Most of the major hotels do not 
cost more than $100 a day, while many budget accommodations are less than $10 a 
day for a couple. 
</P>
<P>
Food is especially cheap: You would be splurging if you spent more than $15 for 
two at dinner. 
</P>
<P>
But Bali is not a pristine, unspoiled paradise, and without a little planning 
and foresight it may be disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
Bali is, after all, in the middle of a hot, Third World country. This 
invariably means that the infrastructure is crumbling, the capital city, 
Denpasar, is a mess and the narrow roads are constantly clogged with belching 
trucks and screaming motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the worst mistake would be to stay at Kuta Beach, the main destination 
listed in guidebooks. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, Kuta was a small village known for its brilliant sunsets. Now it is 
a tourist slum, crammed with hotels, hustlers (of both sexes) and the worst 
kind of honky-tonk shops. By now it should be considered an Australian colony, 
since Australian budget tourists have turned it into their version of Fort 
Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, start your trip at Sanur Beach, less than 10 miles away from Kuta and 
a different world. Sanur is quiet, elegant and relatively unspoiled. 
</P>
<P>
At the far end of the beach, someone built a 10-story hotel, but the Balinese 
quickly realized their mistake and passed a law prohibiting any hotels taller 
than a palm tree. Though hotels now line the beach, most are hidden in the 
palms. 
</P>
<P>
Ours, La Taverna, was a group of bungalows set in a wild garden, the rooms 
furnished with Balinese antiques. The bamboo dining area opened onto the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Sanur on average is more expensive than Kuta, but budget travelers have the 
option of Candi Dasa, a new beach area on the southeastern coast. (Nusa Dua, 
another high-class beach area, mostly serves international conferences.) 
</P>
<P>
Although Bali has some beautiful beaches (a relaxing way to recover from jet 
lag), they should not be the main reason to visit the island. 
</P>
<P>
The Balinese, in fact, ignore the beaches, which they believe are inhabited by 
bad spirits. They turn their attention to the center of the island, with its 
massive ravines, rice fields and volcanoes, where the good spirits are said to 
reside. It is also where you will find the real Bali. 
</P>
<P>
The Balinese are deeply religious, and their form of Hinduism is unique. They 
believe in a universal God but worship different manifestations. They believe 
in both good spirits, who are worshiped, and evil spirits, who must be 
placated. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever you walk you will see simple offerings to the gods strewn on the 
sidewalks -- even in front of the tackiest tourist shops. The offerings usually 
consist of a banana leaf, rice, spices and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
The Balinese believe that as soon as the offering touches the ground, the gods 
consume its essence, so no one much cares what happens to the offering after 
that. Usually, it becomes the next meal of the neighborhood dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every day of the Balinese calendar provides an excuse for a temple 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
With a little luck, you will see a ground-touching ceremony (babies aren't 
allowed to touch the ground for their first six months because they are 
believed to still belong to the gods), a tooth-filing ceremony (a rite of 
adulthood in which teeth are filed to make them less animal-like) or a 
spectacular cremation ceremony (a village will often cremate their dead all at 
once, putting off funerals for months). 
</P>
<P>
Another special event is the Balinese New Year, usually celebrated in April. 
</P>
<P>
One day, massive, noisy festivals are held to drive away the evil spirits; the 
next day, the entire island stays inside and people avoid speaking, hoping to 
trick the spirits into thinking the island has been abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
Balinese dance, among the most beautiful in the world, is an integral part of 
the religious experience. Some of the more famous Balinese temple dances are 
performed regularly for tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Although these dances are often professional and are worth seeing, they lack 
the religious fervor of the dances performed during actual ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
The Barong dance, an allegory of good and evil, with terrific costumes, is 
performed every morning in Batubulan, a village whose residents specialize in 
stone carving. 
</P>
<P>
The Kecak dance, in which tales from Hindu epics are accompanied by a chanting 
chorus of more than a 100 men, is held every evening throughout the island. 
</P>
<P>
Many restaurants offer the Legong -- graceful dances performed by girls and 
young women -- with dinner. (One of the best is held Saturday nights at the 
Tandjung Sari hotel in Sanur.) All of the dances, with the exception of the 
Kecak, are accompanied by the haunting sounds of the gamelan. 
</P>
<P>
The best base for exploring the real Bali is Ubud, a cool village about 45 
minutes from beach areas. Ubud is the cultural heart of Bali, the center of the 
vast Balinese artistic community. 
</P>
<P>
With a car, virtually every major monument is an easy day-trip away. Lakes 
Batur and Bratan, two lovely bodies of water set in the cratered tops of 
volcanoes that tower over the island, are both about 25 miles from Ubud. 
</P>
<P>
And without transportation, beautiful walks can be taken in any direction. Just 
head out of town. The walk to Pejeng, through rice fields and gorges, is 
especially soothing. 
</P>
<P>
Ubud itself has become overrun with small hotels and is not especially 
attractive. But the outlying villages, such as Campuan and Kedewatan, are still 
relatively unspoiled. 
</P>
<P>
You can spend days here looking at Balinese arts, which range from wood 
carvings and paintings to jewelry and batik. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the villages surrounding Ubud seems to specialize in a particular 
craft. Mas, for instance, is the home of the wood carvers and Celuk the center 
for silver jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Though many people leave Bali toting packages home, the most lasting artistry 
of the people is their special way of life. It lingers in your mind long after 
you have left.

BALI, INDONESIA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Getting there: Garuda Indonesia flies from Los Angeles to Indonesia, making two 
stops, one in Honolulu and the other in Biak, Indonesia, before arriving in 
Jakarta. Cost is $2,146 round trip. Continental also flies to Indonesia from 
Los Angeles, stopping in Honolulu and Guam before continuing on to Denpasar, 
Bali. Cost is $1,177 to $1,711 round trip. 
</P>
<P>
Where to stay: In Sanur, La Taverna (telephone 361-88497) is one of Bali's 
loveliest hotels, with rooms set in a beautiful garden that opens onto a beach. 
The 40 rooms cost $78 to $93 a day. The elegant Tandjung Sari (telephone 
361-88441) is the favorite of jetsetters. The 25 rooms are bigger than those at 
La Taverna and cost more, $135-$175 a day. 
</P>
<P>
In the Ubud area, the Kupu Kupu Barong in Kedewatan (telephone 361-95079) has a 
spectacular location overlooking a ravine, but the prices are high by Balinese 
standards, $195-$225 a day. A more practical choice would be the Ananda 
Cottages in Campuan at $40 a day (telephone 361-26414). 
</P>
<P>
Where to eat: Try the marinated sate (meat barbecued over coconut husks), 
gadogado (steamed vegetables smothered with spicy peanut sauce), nasi goreng 
(fried rice with egg and meats), black rice pudding and bean rice wine. The 
Tandjung Sari is the best restaurant in Sanur; reserve ahead for its Saturday 
night rijstafel (Indonesian buffet) and legong dance ($25 per person). The Kupu 
Kupu Barong is Ubud's top eating spot, though the more centrally located Lotus 
Cafe and Murni's Warung are also good choices. 
</P>
<P>
When to go: Bali is centrally located in the Indonesian archipeligo. It has two 
seasons, dry (May to October) and wet, and temperatures are about 80 degrees 
year-round. 
</P>

CHRISTMAS BERRY SEASON ON GRIFFITH PARK TRAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trails of Griffith Park offer nice winter outings, particularly when the 
rich green crown of the toyon bush is aglow with a mass of red berries. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when most members of the chaparral community have donned their gray 
apparel, the toyon -- also known variously as Christmas berry or California 
holly -- is the most festive of flora. 
</P>
<P>
It's believed that masses of this California native shrub growing on the hills 
above Hollywood gave the community its name. The toyon bushes growing along the 
trails to Griffith Park's higher peaks -- Mt. Bell and Mt. Hollywood -- frame 
fine city views, and can be quite photogenic on clear days. 
</P>
<P>
To the Native Americans who once roamed these hills, the sweet toyon berries, 
boiled or toasted, were a treat. Spanish Californians crushed them into a 
drink. 
</P>
<P>
To some modern-day conservationists, toyon has an unhappier meaning. For years, 
to their horror, the city of Los Angeles dumped garbage in Toyon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
It all began at the turn of the century, when eccentric oilman Col. Griffith J. 
Griffith gave 3,000 acres of his ostrich farm to Los Angeles on the condition 
that it remain forever a park. 
</P>
<P>
Heirs of Griffith took the city to court in 1950, when Los Angeles proposed 
dumping in Toyon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The city responded by saying no violation of public trust was taking place 
because the city was actually "improving the park," since once the dirt settled 
and hazardous methane gas was burned off, the mountains of garbage would be 
contoured into picnic grounds and softball fields. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Toyon is no longer a canyon, but a mountain of earth-covered trash 
awaiting landscaping. You can see it on a loop trip through the center of the 
park. Fortunately, this loop hike is much more than a dumpsite-seeing tour. 
</P>
<P>
Amir's Garden, a tranquil retreat just half a mile from the trail head, is one 
lovely spot en route. Iranian immigrant Amir Dialameh planted the two-acre 
oasis that now bears his name. It's a great place for a picnic or to escape the 
busy city below. 
</P>
<P>
Another hike highlight is 1,582-foot Mt. Bell, just a bit smaller than 
1,625-foot Mt. Hollywood, highest peak in Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Bell, located in almost the exact geographic center of the park, offers 
good views of Hollywood, the Hollywood Hills and the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, the loop around Mt. Bell is a typical Griffith Park hike: You'll 
get some views that please and some that won't; you'll enjoy the good trails 
and be annoyed at the lack of trail signs. 
</P>
<P>
Keep alert on this hike; there are lots of trail junctions and changes of 
direction. Consider picking up a trail map at the Ranger Station in the park 
center, on Griffith Park Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to the trail head: Griffith Park, with its central location, is 
accessible by numerous freeways and surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
From the valley side of the park, take the Ventura Freeway (134) and exit on 
Forest Lawn Drive in Burbank. Follow it into the park, turn right on Griffith 
Park Drive and continue to the Mineral Wells Picnic Area. 
</P>
<P>
From the south side of the park on Los Feliz Boulevard, turn north on Griffith 
Park Drive and follow it just past the Harding Golf Course clubhouse and 
driving range to the Mineral Wells Picnic Area. 
</P>
<P>
Park in the picnic area and look for a three-way trail junction and the extreme 
lower end of the picnic ground, close to where the road splits to go around the 
picnic area. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: At the unsigned junction of three bridle trails, you'll see that both 
the trail on your left and the one on your right (Mineral Wells Trail) parallel 
Griffith Park Drive. The trail on your left (heading southeast) will be your 
return route. 
</P>
<P>
Join the middle trail and ascend moderately to steeply half a mile to Amir's 
Garden. You'll leave behind some of the din of the Ventura and Golden State 
freeways and find an eclectic collection of pine and pepper trees, asparagus 
fern and spider plant, as well as a host of succulents. There are even some 
plants perched atop posts. 
</P>
<P>
After catching your breath, leave behind Amir's and climb again for another 
half a mile to a junction near water tank 112. To your right, you'll spot all 
that remains of Toyon Canyon. Then bear left at the junction onto Mt. Hollywood 
Trail and continue your ascent. 
</P>
<P>
The trail crosses paved Vista Del Valle Drive and soon comes to another 
junction. A right (west) turn will take you around Mt. Bell. 
</P>
<P>
In a hundred yards or so, you'll spot a number of "goat trails" that enable the 
agile hiker to scramble up to the top of Mt. Bell. Great views of the Hollywood 
sign and the San Fernando Valley are the hiker's clear-day reward. 
</P>
<P>
To complete the loop, bear left at the above-mentioned junction, then soon make 
another left onto Eckert Trail, which leads back down to Vista Del Valle Drive. 
Walk down the paved drive a hundred yards or so and rejoin the dirt trail on 
your left. 
</P>
<P>
You'll begin a long, looping descent. Below are the park's golf courses and the 
Los Angeles Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
The trail passes by the site of the old zoo, now a picnic area, then parallels 
Griffith Park Drive a final mile and returns you to the Mineral Wells Picnic 
Area and the trail head.

CRUISE VIEWS: HOW SHIPS SCORE IN SANITATION RATING SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Hunt believes he is a lot safer eating on board a cruise ship than in a 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The Miami-based Hunt, who is chief of the vessel sanitation program for the 
U.S. Public Health Service, is head of a six-man team that inspects and grades 
the kitchens, water systems and food storage areas of cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
"I've inspected a lot of land-based restaurants over the years," said Hunt, who 
began his career as a restaurant inspector in Salt Lake City. "If I would 
compare our worst ship to any land-based restaurant, our ships are better." 
</P>
<P>
The findings of Hunt's team are published in a mailing popularly called "the 
green sheet," which is sent to travel agents, newspapers, magazines and 
cruise-industry personnel every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
What they are checking on cruise ships, according to Hunt, is first and most 
important the safety of the water supply; second, how long food is held at 
certain temperatures that could be unsafe, such as on decks and at midnight 
buffets. 
</P>
<P>
"If the ship's staff throws the food out there and it sits at room temperature 
for three or four hours, there's going to be a disaster," Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt, who took over the ship inspection post in February, 1989, has helped 
initiate a new scoring system to replace the one that rated vessels only 
"satisfactory" or "unsatisfactory," depending on whether they received more or 
less than 86 points on a scale of 100. 
</P>
<P>
Now the actual numerical grades are published. Hunt thinks the change makes 
cruise lines much more sensitive to their scores than they were under the 
previous system. 
</P>
<P>
"An 84 and a 30 are both failing, but in different degrees," he said. As for 
those that pass: "It's no longer sufficient for them to get an 86. They want a 
90-plus." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time ever, two ships have scored 100 on 1990 inspections -- 
Carnival Cruise Lines' Fantasy on its inspection of April 30, coming up from an 
initial failing grade of 78, and Windstar Cruises' Wind Spirit on its Aug. 27 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
The Wind Spirit's earlier ratings were 94 and 88, both passing. On a subsequent 
inspection Aug. 24, Fantasy slipped back to an 88. 
</P>
<P>
The ratio of passing and failing has changed dramatically since the numerical 
system and a new, easier-to-understand manual were introduced. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hunt's emphasis on education and his new series of training 
classes to teach kitchen supervisors and chefs about food handling and water 
treatment -- in effect telling them not only what the Public Health Service 
wants but why it wants it -- have made a discernable improvement in ship 
sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
On the Oct. 28, 1988, report, 43 ships passed and 36 failed. A year later, 64 
passed and 24 failed. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent report -- Oct. 26, 1990 -- shows that 83 passed and 18 failed. 
(The total number on each report vary, depending on how many ships are in 
service and how many have been inspected.) 
</P>
<P>
Hunt and his team performed 200 ship inspections in 1989 and will do about 255 
by the end of 1990. In 1988, under the old system, about 130 ships were 
inspected. 
</P>
<P>
The current failing ships and their scores, from low to high, are: 
</P>
<P>
Vistamar, 30; Odysseus, 50; Berlin, 56; Pride of Mississippi, 57; Vasco de Gama 
(not in service at the present time), 58; Pegasus, 62; Polaris, 66; Society 
Explorer, 66; Ocean Spirit (not in service), 68; Fair Princess, 76; Crystal 
Harmony, 77; Cunard Countess, 78; Daphne, 78; New Shoreham II, 80; Seabourn 
Pride, 80; Britanis, 82; EugenioCosta, 83, and Scandinavian Sun, 83. 
</P>
<P>
The highest scorers on the current green sheet are: 
</P>
<P>
Wind Spirit, 100; Royal Viking Star, 99; Americana, 98; Amerikanis, 97; Crown 
Odyssey, 97; Royal Viking Sky, 97; Starship Oceanic, 97; Holiday, 96; Song of 
America, 96; Vistafjord, 96; Sagafjord, 95; Sea Goddess I, 95; Azure Seas, 94; 
Seabourn Spirit, 94, and Seaward 94. 
</P>
<P>
The foreign-flag ships now understand what the Public Health Service wants, 
according to Hunt. "That's the key, since we're judging them consistently each 
time. We want each inspector to come in with the same criteria." 
</P>
<P>
One story from earlier days, perhaps true, Hunt said, is about an inspector who 
came aboard a ship and demanded that the ice machine be moved across the room 
from one spot to another, which the bewildered staff did. On the next 
inspection a year or so later, another inspector took one look at the ice 
machine and ordered it moved back to where it had been originally. 
</P>
<P>
"So we've put out a good manual," Hunt said. "When the inspectors go on board, 
we not only tell them this is wrong, but why it's wrong." Hunt believes 
education is one of the most important aspects of his job. 
</P>
<P>
The ships that Hunt inspects carry 13 passengers or more and have an 
international itinerary. This includes excursion-type ships with one-day 
sailings outside U.S. waters so passengers can gamble -- vessels such as the 
Viking Princess and the SeaEscape ships that sail from Florida. 
</P>
<P>
It does not, however, include U.S. flag ships that do not leave U.S. waters, 
such as the Delta Queen and Mississippi Queen paddle-wheelers, which sail the 
Mississippi River, and American Hawaii's two cruise ships that sail entirely 
within Hawaii. Inspections of these ships are the responsibility of the states 
they sail in and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt and his team also do construction inspections on new vessels in the 
shipyards, financed by the yards and cruise companies "because they really want 
to know so they can take care of any problems at the yard before the ship sails 
for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
Periodic health inspections on ships are paid for by the cruise lines as well. 
</P>
<P>
The Centers for Disease Control inspects ships only in U.S. ports, such as 
Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Port Canaveral, Key West, New York City, St. Thomas, 
San Juan, New Orleans, Galveston, San Diego, Los Angeles and several ports in 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt was recently in Guam for the first time, making a construction inspection 
follow-up on Salen Lindblad's new Frontier Spirit before its maiden voyage. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally I wouldn't come to Guam," Hunt said, "but the vessel will not be 
inspected in the United States prior to its first dry dock, and they wanted to 
be able to make any necessary changes then before their first grade score." 
</P>
<P>
The cruise lines have been completely cooperative, Hunt said, despite the fact 
that the Public Health Service has no legislative authority to implement 
sanctions against foreign-flag vessels. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just making recommendations," Hunt said. "I can't keep a ship from 
sailing." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he emphasized, cruise lines are all too aware of the 
publicity that major outbreaks of food- or water-borne illnesses on a cruise 
ship would get, especially if 300 to 400 people got sick. 
</P>
<P>
"Cruise lines want their passengers to have a good experience and to come back 
again," Hunt said, "so they pay attention to their scores." 
</P>
<P>
Potential passengers should understand that a failing grade does not mean a 
diarrheal outbreak is impending, nor does a passing score mean a traveler can 
suspend normal precautions with impunity. The grades only indicate the 
condition of the vessel on the date of inspection. 
</P>
<P>
Detailed inspection reports on individual vessels will be sent free on request.

BARGAIN CORNER: MOZART CELEBRATION HIGHLIGHTS AUSTRIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK ADLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Travelers heading for Austria in 1991 will have several money-saving 
transportation options to consider as the country celebrates the 200th 
anniversary of Mozart's death with numerous special performances and events. 
</P>
<P>
In Vienna, you can save money on the public transport system, which includes 
trams, buses and subway, by purchasing a 24-hour rover ticket for about $3.25. 
A 72-hour rover ticket is about $8.50. 
</P>
<P>
Also available is an eight-day "strip" ticket for about $18 that can be used by 
more than one person . You just punch the same number of strips in the ticket 
as there are users. There is also a four-day strip ticket for about $4.75, or a 
package of five individual tickets for $5.75. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets purchased singly cost $1.75 each. 
</P>
<P>
Children under 7 years travel free on Vienna's public transport system. 
</P>
<P>
The Austrian city transit passes take effect with the first use, not from the 
time of purchase. The passes can only be purchased in each individual city. 
</P>
<P>
Salzburg, birthplace of Mozart, has a 24-hour pass for about $4 that offers 
unlimited travel on bus and trolley lines and to the funicular to Hohensalzburg 
Fortress. 
</P>
<P>
Innsbruck has a one-day pass good on street cars and bus lines that costs about 
$4.50. If you stay in Innsbruck for three consecutive nights or longer, you 
automatically are eligible to become a member of Club Innsbruck at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
Membership covers free daily bus service to the city's five skiing/hiking 
areas, admission to various events scheduled by the club and discounts on 
admission to museums, golf courses, tennis courts and the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Your hotel should be able to provide the Club Innsbruck membership card, which 
also offers discounts on panorama flights over the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
If you plan to travel by rail, look into the "Rabbit Card" offered by the 
Austrian Railway Network. You can choose any four days out of a 10-day period 
for unlimited rail travel, with the card also good for boat trips on Lake St. 
Wolfgang and travel on narrow-gauge trains throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Half-price discounts are also available through the card on all scheduled boat 
service on the Danube River within Austria, and on Lake Constance boat trips. 
</P>
<P>
The card, which must be purchased in Europe, costs about $120 for first-class 
travel, $83 for second-class. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, contact the Austrian National Tourist Office, 11601 
Wilshire Blvd., Suite 2480, Los Angeles 90025, (213) 477-3332. JACK ADLER

<P>
AIRLINES' LOST-LUGGAGE RULES DIFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC FRIEDHEIM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: When an airline lost my baggage, it would not compensate me because I 
hadn't filed a claim within a week. Is this legal? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Each airline has a different statute of limitations. Some may give you 
three months, others demand notice of loss on the spot. Always keep copies of 
paperwork and names of those you contacted at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Q: We're planning a vacation with our trailer this winter. Will there be any 
gas limits for such vehicles? 
</P>
<P>
A: Energy officials in Washington say no such controls are presently being 
contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How late in the year are cruises run on the Baltic? 
</P>
<P>
A: Cruise service usually discontinues in the winter, although ferries operate 
year-round. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do you get a job as a courier carrying documents to different countries? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Although this is largely a government function, some private companies do 
engage people to transport confidential material. Check local courier services 
for information. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are there air excursions that fly over the North Pole? 
</P>
<P>
A: A check of current Alaska and Northern Canada tour offerings show no such 
flights. However, there's always the possibility that a local air service may 
undertake such flights. Check your travel agent for such information. 
</P>
<P>
Q: With the big interest in Eastern Europe, will there be local cruises 
available along inland waterways? 
</P>
<P>
A: Operators are looking for a large expansion in European river cruising, not 
only in Eastern Europe but on the more popular Rhine and Danube rivers. Check 
travel agents for 1991 schedules and itineraries. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Someone has opened a travel agency in his home and is selling air and cruise 
tickets obtained from other agents at no increase in prices. Is this possible? 
</P>
<P>
A: Anybody can open a travel shop, but airlines won't issue tickets or pay 
commissions to agents not accredited by the Airlines Reporting Corp. (ARC) or 
the International Airlines Travel Network. Accredited agencies sometimes will 
handle reservations and ticketing for such outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
Q: We're planning a trip to Australia visiting Sydney, Melbourne, Ayers Rock 
and the Gold Coast. Are there air discounts available? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Both Australian Airlines and Ansett offer discounts and low-priced air 
passes for visitors to Australia with savings up to 40% over normal fares. 
Regional airline East/West also offers discounts. With deregulation of the 
airlines set for later this year, look for more special promotional fares. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Must airlines notify passengers if there is a change in departure time of an 
international flight? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, but most airlines try to notify passengers' travel agents if they 
change published schedules. However, it would be best for you to check with the 
airline a day or two prior to departure.

TRAVEL VIDEOS: RAILROAD TAPE IS GOOD TRAINING FOR EUROPE TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Europe by Train" (produced for Eurail by Taylored Video Services, 30 minutes, 
1989). 
</P>
<P>
The video extols the advantages of traveling the 100,000-mile European rail 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being loaded with cliches -- "a time machine to the next chapter on 
your itinerary," a "journey through living post cards" and "railroad travel is 
an invitation to discovery" -- it nevertheless is a well-produced source of 
information for those considering Europe by train. 
</P>
<P>
The video explains the different types of Eurailpasses -- Flexipass, Youthpass 
and Senior -- and offers information on luggage and how to travel light, as 
well as tips on how to best use the rail system. 
</P>
<P>
Some advantages of using a Eurailpass are the bus, ferry and steamer 
connections, the comparative value of rail passes over other means of 
transportion, the train punctuality and the fact that train travel is 
frequently faster than flying because stations are conveniently located in the 
heart of cities. 
</P>
<P>
The tape comes with a map that shows the countries in which the Eurailpass can 
be used, informs viewers how to read the train schedules and offers information 
on how to make restaurant and sleeper reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Shown are interiors of railroad stations (along with shops, luggage carts and 
porters), some of the railroad cars and brief scenes of the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Available from Taylored Video Services. Write P.O. Box 220513, Charlotte, N.C. 
28222, or call (704) 366-0404. Price: $22.95. 
</P>
<P>
"Portrait of England, Treasure Houses and Gardens" (Tapestry Video, 1989, 55 
minutes). 
</P>
<P>
Producer Dan Moss provides a "tapestry" of England set to the music of jazz 
trumpeter Wynton Marsalis. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither the scenes nor the music are identified, the film is a 
pleasant viewing and listening experience. 
</P>
<P>
For viewers who need more specific information, a printed program is included 
with a map of England, showing places reviewed in the film. 
</P>
<P>
The program also lists the film's musical numbers, which come from the CBS 
Records Masterworks album that features Marsalis in solo performances. There 
are also several solos by soprano Edita Gruberova. 
</P>
<P>
Although the video will be of minimal help to trip planners, to Anglophiles and 
those who appreciate Baroque music it is an interesting contrast to the usual 
travelogue. 
</P>
<P>
There are no tips or travel recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available through video stores or by phone: (800) 445-3800, Operator 
880. Price: $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
"The Great World Cruise of the QE2" (International Travel Films, 1989, 85 
minutes). 
</P>
<P>
Visiting 24 ports on an 80-day around-the-world cruise is no mean feat. Neither 
is condensing it into an 85-minute video, but Doug Jones does an admirable job. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers will learn more about the ship than most passengers do. For example, 
information is offered on how much fuel and food the ship uses, and a 
behind-the-scenes tour goes from the engine room to the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers are shown in the pool, shops, theaters, restaurants, night clubs and 
casino. 
</P>
<P>
The film begins when the ship picks up passengers in New York City and Port 
Everglades, Fla. Then it sails to the Caribbean islands of Martinique and 
Barbados, and later to Brazil for tours of historic Salvador and the beaches of 
Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
After crossing the Atlantic to the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Town in South 
Africa, the ship stops at the island of Mauritius and afterward at Sri Lanka 
for tours of Colombo and the ancient capital of Kandy. 
</P>
<P>
In India, the ship docks at Madras, where a trip includes the Taj Mahal. Kuala 
Lumpur, Singapore and Bangkok are next on the itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
At the halfway mark on the cruise, there's a five-day visit to Hong Kong, where 
viewers can sample the shops and night life while the ship is refueled, cleaned 
and resupplied. 
</P>
<P>
The next part of the journey includes South Korea, for trips to Pusan and 
Kyongju, and Japan, for tours of Tokyo and its night life, a ferryboat ride to 
Izu Gardens for a traditional tea ceremony, a side trip to the religious center 
at the town of Kamakura and a brief stop at Yokohama before sailing across the 
Pacific Ocean to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Three rituals are performed on this lengthy journey: a "cross-the-line" 
ceremony on going over the Equator on the way to Brazil, a white elephant sale, 
during which passengers trade unwanted souvenirs purchased on their trip, and a 
tug-of-war between passenger teams as the ship crosses the international date 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the ship sails to Honolulu for some of the popular tourist sights, 
then continues on to Los Angeles, where the video shows scenes of Hollywood and 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the cruise includes a stop in Acapulco, a journey down the Central 
American coast and a trip through the Panama Canal and the Caribbean, with 
stops at Cartagena and Curacao before heading back to Port Everglades and New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' video was filmed for viewing in theaters and was not cut or edited for 
video presentation. The film quality is excellent and the narration is 
informative and entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from International Travel Films, P.O. Box 39402, Los 
Angeles 90039, (213) 663-4334. Price: $29.95.

AMERICAN, NOT REFUGEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I take exception to the headline on Kenneth Turan's article, "Where America 
Came From -- A Newly Restored Ellis Island Reminds Visitors That We Are All 
Refugees," Nov. 18. 
</P>
<P>
America didn't "come from" Ellis Island. It was already discovered, founded, 
created and built by the time of Eastern and Southern European immigration. 
Colonists are not refugees, but allowed the later "refugees" to come to our 
nation as cheap, docile labor for the industrial giants of the times. I am not 
a refugee, but an American. This is my land that my forebears helped build.

this accomplished, the negotiations should now move cautiously in fixing a

"In the gulf crisis, the U.S.A. has the initiative to choose between war and 
peace. This is not only because the U.S.A. has the strongest military strength 
in the world, and has placed the largest number of troops in the gulf, but also 
because the U.S.A. claims that it has to shoulder the duty as a 'policeman of 
the world.' 
</P>
<P>
However, since numerous uncertain factors exist, it is, in fact, not completely 
up to the U.S.A. to choose between war and peace. First, the main objective of 
the U.S. troops in the gulf is to pose a strategic threat, exert a military 
pressure, try to force Iraq out of Kuwait and overcome Saddam's regime.

IN THE POLITICAL THEATRICS OF THATCHER'S JAZZY LONDON; 
</P>
<P>
BRITAIN: BRITAIN WAS FAR DIFFERENT WHEN THATCHER TOOK OFFICE IN 1979, THE 
CURRENT FLASH AND DAZZLE OF LONDON TYPIFY HOW SHE REVVED UP THE SOCIETY.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is, as Margaret Thatcher said ruefully the day she decided to resign as 
Britain's prime minister, a funny old world. Less than a week later, there she 
was, looking pleased as punch, all smiles, saying she was "thrilled" with the 
result of the election for leader of Britain's Conservative Party -- who 
automatically became Britain's new prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Well she might be. Thatcher watchers have known since 1987 that John Major, who 
now moves into 10 Downing St., has long been her anointed heir. When all is 
said and done, the last few remarkable weeks in Britain add up to this: 
Thatcher has handed over the baton of leadership to exactly the person she 
always wanted to succeed her, but has done so a couple of years earlier than 
she would have wished. There are worse ways to go. 
</P>
<P>
Why was she so keen on Major? Principally, because he comes from a similar 
background to hers: the respectable lower-middle class, though in his case not 
from the provinces but from London -- in Britain, an important distinction. He 
is a self-made man of the kind she likes best: He left school at 16, and worked 
on construction sites before he became a clerk in the City of London. He has 
the same kind of commitment to market economics she has, and the same kind of 
belief that hard work and determination never hurt anybody. He is friendly and 
approachable: The British would say there is no "side" to him. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, he is a bit of an enigma. He is said to have a fine political 
nose, but I can exclusively reveal to readers of The Times that last year I won 
10 off him by betting that two Cabinet ministers would not survive a government 
reshuffle. He was adamant they would. They didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Major is thought to be less opposed to European integration than Thatcher was, 
but if he is, he is keeping his true feelings to himself. Just last week, he 
dismissed a single European currency as an economic folly -- not what they 
think in Brussels at all. When foreign secretary for three months, in 1989, he 
looked -- to the uncharitable -- out of his depth, and -- to the kindly -- a 
man still mastering his brief. Those close to him say that he is a man of 
deeply felt convictions; but they have not been made obvious to the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
Not that much of this mattered last week. The real story of Major's elevation 
to the premiership is what it says about modern Britain, and how it has emerged 
from its most amazing decade of the century. Consider the performance of 
Douglas Hurd, one of the two defeated candidates. An excellent foreign 
secretary, a man with a fine record in government, intelligent and cultured, he 
spent the campaign trying to live down that he had gone to Eton and Trinity 
College, Cambridge. This, remember, was an election for the leader of the 
Conservative Party; repeat, the Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Hurd nor Michael Heseltine, the other contender, could match Major's 
"classlessness." (He went to a local high school, hated it and never attended 
university.) Hugo Young, Thatcher's biographer, put his finger on the pulse, as 
usual, when he said the election's central question was: "Who would you rather 
drink a pint with?" When conviviality in a bar counts for more in high British 
politics than attendance at Eton, you know something wonderful has happened. 
</P>
<P>
This was Thatcher's doing. Though a bundle of contradictions -- she married a 
wealthy man and awarded hereditary peerages -- she is, at heart, a meritocrat. 
She had spent years being patronized for her sex; in her last interview as 
prime minister she said, "If a woman is strong, she is strident. If a man is 
strong, gosh, he's a good guy." 
</P>
<P>
Those memories meant that she could not endorse any form of preferment -- such 
as birth, or schooling -- that did not turn on individual accomplishment. She 
left behind a society that was more meritocratic than the one she found in 
1979. It is far from perfect -- if it had been, the men in gray suits who took 
such delight in stabbing a jumped-up woman in the back would have stayed their 
hand. But, ye gods, it is a better place in which to be clever and able than it 
was. Perhaps, the most touching epitaph to Thatcher came from Julie Burchill, a 
rebellious young punk-rock journalist in 1979, and now best-selling author 11 
years later. Our Julie, when asked for her reaction to the prime minister's 
resignation, said the Thatcher years "made me bloody rich. I feel like 
someone's banged me over the head with a hammer." 
</P>
<P>
Now there was the authentic voice of 1980s London. The 1980s, for the capital, 
were a golden age, a time when anything was possible -- something like the 
1920s must have been in New York. London, under Thatcher, became jagged, edgy, 
entrepreneurial, international, sleazy, rich and fun. Its drink of choice was 
champagne; its hot businesses were music, media and fashion. 
</P>
<P>
I thought it was wonderful. And back here for three days for the first time in 
a year, I felt how marvelous a backdrop to the drama London provided. It is 
precisely because London is not just a government town that it provides 
unexpected seasoning to political dishes. Everyone was talking about the race, 
everyone glued to the television, devouring newspapers. In the trendy Groucho 
Club, black-clad women ad-executives smoked and drank bubbly, turning the 
leadership options this way and that. When the result was announced, a porter 
at my tube stop rushed to chalk it on a blackboard; the late editions of the 
papers were snatched from news-sellers hands. 
</P>
<P>
The contrast with Washington's narcolepsy could not have been more clear. Just 
think: This whole business was started a few weeks ago by Sir Geoffrey Howe's 
resignation speech to the House of Commons. Can you imagine any speech, by any 
member of Congress, having such a devastating effect? Can you imagine 
Washington men appearing unprompted, unrehearsed, unadvised, in front of the 
cameras as often as our three lads did? Can you imagine Washingtonians using 
bubbly to lubricate a political argument, when most don't know which end of a 
champagne bottle goes "pop"? 
</P>
<P>
There are those who say we British spend far too much time on partisan 
politics, far too much time in our clubby, unexportable political institutions 
like the House of Commons, far too little time being serious about such worthy 
matters as a European currency. All true. But -- oh my! -- for those who love 
politics, the intrigue, the theater, the lies and cheating, the sheer vulgar 
thrill of it all, the old town was the place to be last week.

HUBRIS IS THE SIN OF ANGELS -- IT'S NOT A FEDERAL CRIME; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: IGNORE THE HYSTERIA -- MICHAEL MILKEN'S JUNK BONDS ARE NOT BEHIND THE 
S&amp;L CRISIS, THE LEVEL OF CORPORATE DEBT AND ALL OTHER FISCAL EVILS. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Milken's 10-year prison sentence can best be understood in two parts -- 
as possibly a two-year sentence for the felonies he was actually convicted of, 
and an eight-year sentence for a new federal offense called "being a symbol of 
greed." 
</P>
<P>
Milken's official crimes were, basically, falsifying records to accommodate 
punters such as Ivan F. Boesky, who were cheating their own clients and the 
government. Milken apparently didn't benefit personally from his offenses, but 
they are still depressingly sleazy, and punishment was clearly called for. But 
by any previous standard, including all the other "insider trading" cases, 
Milken's sentence is wildly disproportionate to his crimes, many times more 
severe than those meted out to people literally bringing home suitcases full of 
money from their illicit activities. 
</P>
<P>
Milken inspired as much envy and enmity as awe and admiration. He was the 
symbol of the go-go '80s, the "junk-bond" king, the financier of the company 
takeover revolution, the man who made $500 million a year terrorizing the 
old-boy network in the executive suites and "white shoe" investment banks. Now, 
with his junk-bond empire tottering, recession looming and U.S. financial 
institutions in serious trouble, Federal Judge Kimba M. Wood apparently decided 
she couldn't ignore the drumbeats for a heavy sentence -- confirming the old 
adage that judges read newspapers. It is as if all the regrets for the excesses 
of the '80s can somehow be exorcised by heaping the blame on Milken's head. 
</P>
<P>
America is now either in a recession or slipping into one. The recession might 
be short and mild, but some economists fear it may be quite bad. Shaky 
conditions in American lending institutions -- savings and loans, banks and 
insurance companies -- could cause a credit crunch that would push a weakening 
economy over the edge into a deep depression. Financial institutions are shaky 
because they lent too much and not too wisely. Since unwise credit extension is 
practically synonymous with junk bonds, Milken stands guilty of wrecking the 
economy -- Q.E.D. 
</P>
<P>
It is helpful, as always, to look at the data. And, devil-theorists and 
drumbeaters notwithstanding, the case against junk bonds is far from proved. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, junk bonds have almost nothing to do with the S&amp;L crisis. 
Savings and loans got into trouble by investing in real estate -- the business 
they know best. Nationwide, only about 1% of S&amp;L assets are invested in 
junk bonds. Of the 3,000-odd S&amp;Ls in the country, only about 160 ever owned 
any junk bonds at all. Just 11 savings and loans, including a couple of the 
noisiest failures, owned 70% of all the junk bonds owned by the industry, and 
that was a total of only about $9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The asset problems of the commercial banking system, again, have almost nothing 
to do with junk bonds. Commercial banks plunged into the real-estate market 
themselves about 1985, just as real-estate returns were dropping because of 
overbuilding. In the last several years, about 70% of all commercial loans made 
by banks have been for real estate. With office vacancy rates nationwide 
hovering around 20%, and retail space grossly overbuilt, commercial real-estate 
delinquencies are soaring. Banks are responding by curtailing lending to all 
their customers, including sound businesses. That is a worrisome development, 
but it has nothing to do with Milken or junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
But what about American businesses? Aren't they bogged down with debt because 
of junk bonds? The answer is, not really. Total corporate debt service is about 
20% of cash flows, up from 16% in 1980. Corporate debt dropped sharply in the 
1970s, when interest rates shot into the double digits -- it was just too 
expensive to borrow. The total effect of the "debt mania" of the 1980s has been 
to bring corporate debt ratios back to about the level that prevailed in the 
mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
More important, research at Morgan Stanley shows that almost all debt growth 
for several years has been in so-called non-cyclical industries -- like 
services and food and tobacco manufacturing -- industries whose cash flows are 
relatively stable during recessions. Cyclical industries, like heavy 
manufacturing, have been steadily reducing their debt and have relatively low 
debt-to-cash-flow ratios. Some companies, of course, such as Robert Campeau's 
department stores, have stumbled badly from taking on too much debt, and others 
will fail in the future, but it is simply not true that corporate America as a 
whole is wildly overleveraged. 
</P>
<P>
Were junk bonds a rip-off of investors? Again, not really. Over the long term, 
junk bonds have underperformed stocks by a couple of percentage points. Total 
returns, including all defaults, have been about the same as for higher-grade 
bonds. Returns, that is, are considerably lower than Milken and his legions of 
loyalists hoped, but not out of line with those of other financial instruments. 
The boring point is that, overall, the markets did a respectable job in pricing 
junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, only a small percentage of junk bonds -- probably well under 15% -- 
were used to finance hostile takeovers. The vast majority were issued simply to 
finance corporate growth. Company treasurers chose junk bonds, not because of 
any magical spells weaved by Milken, but simply because they offered the 
best-priced credit in town. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the benefits of junk bonds have been real. At the beginning 
of the 1980s, the stock market was grossly underpriced -- the Dow-Jones average 
had not moved for almost 15 years. Banks generally refused to make long-term 
loans to businesses, and the bond market was open only to a chosen few. That 
was the credit gap that Milken filled with his junk bonds -- and it was 
Milken's "junk" that put companies like MCI Communications Corp. and Turner 
Broadcasting System Inc. on the path to growth. 
</P>
<P>
The early waves of hostile takeovers, in addition, were a necessary corrective 
to slothful and pampered big-company executives. The chairman of Unocal Corp., 
typically, had a grand piano in his corporate jet. Takeovers and the threat of 
takeovers pared corporate staffs, scrapped the palatial offices and tied 
executive compensation more closely to performance. 
</P>
<P>
A good idea became gross excess by 1986, as legions of pin-striped 
business-school graduates armed with personal computers turned corporate 
finance into a high-stakes casino. Milken, by all accounts, played the casino 
with both arrogance and abandon. Such market excesses have a way of flaming out 
on their own, and this one did: bringing down lots of overpaid yuppies, Milken, 
his employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and, at least temporarily, the junk 
bond empire he created. 
</P>
<P>
The late excesses of the junk bond market are a conventional story of hubris 
bringing down the mighty. But hubris has never, until now, been a federal 
crime.

CONGRESS MUST TAKE A HARD LOOK AT IRAQ'S CHARGES AGAINST KUWAIT; 
</P>
<P>
GEOPOLITICS: BEFORE THE U.S. EXERCISES THE 'WAR OPTION,' WE MUST ASSESS THE 
REGIONAL BELIEF THAT HUSSEIN WAS RESPONDING TO PROVOCATIVE KUWAITI POLICIES.

<TEXT>
<P>
As Congress considers the wisdom of going to war with Iraq, it must try to 
assess a number of psychological or attitudinal factors that will dominate the 
costs and risks: Saddam Hussein's intentions; the convictions of potential 
rivals; the morale of Iraqi soldiers and civilians; the willingness of peoples 
in the American-led alliance to sacrifice for restoration of Kuwait's Sabah 
dynasty, and the prospects for postwar radicalization and alienation of the 
Arab masses from their own governments and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Those assessments will not be easy, but they will certainly be wrong if they 
assume that the rest of the world, especially the Middle East, shares the Bush 
Admnistration's hasty and simplistic conclusion that there is no reason to 
investigate the circumstances surrounding Iraq's invasion because Hussein is 
"Hitler Revisited." 
</P>
<P>
Let it be clear at the outset of this analysis that I consider Hussein a brutal 
tyrant whose annexation of Kuwait must be undone. Moreover, there can be no 
second guessing of the President's decision to deploy adequate air and naval 
forces -- with the necessary ground protection -- to defend Saudi Arabia, or of 
its superb organization of unprecedented economic sanctions to force Iraqi 
withdrawal. Nonetheless, Congress should, before endorsing the so-called "war 
option," establish the relevant facts to assess the breadth and depth of 
regional belief that Hussein was responding -- albeit with inexcusable 
brutality -- to provocative Kuwaiti oil and financial policies that he had 
expressly labelled "economic warfare" in a May 30, 1990, address to the Arab 
summit conference. 
</P>
<P>
Financial assistance. Although the Iraq-Iran War represented a tremendous drain 
on Iraq's financial resources, it provided huge incremental oil revenues to 
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dahbi and Qatar during the early years when Iraq's 
prewar exports of 3 million barrels per day dropped to a mere trickle with 
Iranian destruction of its port and Syrian closure of its pipelines. In order 
to meet the requirements of its oil-short customers, Iraq arranged for those 
other gulf exporters to increase their production and thereby reap a huge 
windfall. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that the Iraqi army was the only barrier to Iranian hegemony and 
Shiite fundamentalism, Kuwait and the others states were more than willing to 
expend a portion of their unexpected windfall on financing Hussein's war 
effort. Lest OPEC complain that they were exceeding their quotas, Iraq's 
financiers called their additional production "war relief" and argued that it 
should be counted against Baghdad's unfulfilled quota. 
</P>
<P>
When the war ended in 1988, Kuwaiti government accounts showed that about $22 
billion had been booked as its share of the collective Arab war effort. 
Although such bookkeeping incurred no interest or principal payments, it 
nonetheless added uncertainty to Iraq's credit worthiness at a time when new 
international credits were required for rebuilding. Therefore, Iraq sought 
formal removal of all such amounts from the books of the assisting states. 
Saudi Arabia agreed, but Kuwait refused, its foreign minister, Sheik Sabah al 
Ahmed al Sabah, later suggesting that "we thought it would be a help to them in 
rescheduling their debts with Western banks." 
</P>
<P>
American taxpayers had better hope that the Kuwaitis and Saudis do not extend 
similar "help" to Washington when the current crisis is over. The circumstances 
are, after all, precisely the same: The Arab exporters have used a portion of 
their windfall oil revenues to finance a common defense effort, although this 
time the defending soldiers are American, rather than Iraqi. 
</P>
<P>
The Rumaila Field. While there is little support outside Iraq and its Arab 
allies for Baghdad's so-called historic claim to Kuwait, there is widespread 
uncertainty as to the precise location of the common border. In fact, the 
United States has never recognized a legally binding border because no 
officially ratified delineation agreement has been deposited with the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the failure of Iraq and Kuwait to agree on a precise land 
boundary, the Arab League established in 1962 a so-called "Military Patrol 
Line" straddled by a sort of buffer zone, which was to be free of provocative 
activities and permanent presences. There was little reason to encroach on that 
area until Iraqi delineation of its enormous Rumaila Field indicated that it 
almost certainly extended for a short distance across the Military Patrol Line. 
</P>
<P>
When Kuwaiti drilling rigs moved into the area in the 1970s, Iraqi troops 
crossed the Military Patrol Line and forced Kuwaiti withdrawal. That standoff 
prevailed until the early 1980s, when Kuwait moved back in to drill about a 
dozen wells while Iraq was locked in battle with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Oil could not have been the reason for risking retaliation. The 12,000 barrels 
per day that the Kuwaitis eventually produced represented about one-half of 1% 
of the country's total capacity and could have been easily replaced by a 
minuscule twist of the valves in other Kuwaiti fields where OPEC quotas left 
almost 1 million barrels per day of surplus capacity. It is far more likely 
that Kuwait was motivated by a desire to establish "facts on the ground" in 
connection with its border claim, or to set up negotiating room. 
</P>
<P>
Although Iraq valued its professed loss at $2.4 billion, it is more likely that 
Baghdad was incensed by tiny Kuwait's "lack of respect." In that case, the 
Sabahs certainly acted recklessly if, as reported, they responded to Hussein's 
May 30 warning by ordering a drilling rig to move closer to the Military Patrol 
Line than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
Claimed share of OPEC oil revenues. At the end of the Iraq-Iran War in August, 
1988, Kuwait's 1 million barrels per day production quota represented a 6% 
share of OPEC's total production ceiling and presumed revenues -- not bad for a 
country with only 750,000 citizens that already enjoyed the organization's 
highest per-capita income and only budget surplus, thanks to huge income from 
investments made during the extortionate days of the 1970s. Nonetheless, in 
March, 1989, Kuwait demanded a 50% increase in its previously agreed quota. 
</P>
<P>
When OPEC met in June, 1989, all 12 of the other member states voted to reject 
the Kuwaiti demand. 
</P>
<P>
Following his colleagues' rejection, Sheik Ali al Khalifa al Sabah, then oil 
minister, announced that Kuwait would no longer be bound by any quota and 
doubled production to 2 million barrels per day. 
</P>
<P>
By June, 1990, such massive noncompliance by Kuwait, and the United Arab 
Emirates, had caused oil prices to collapse below $14 per barrel, so Saudi 
Arabia summoned the two mavericks to a June 10 meeting, where Kuwait again 
solemnly pledged to reduce its output even though similar pledges had 
previously proved hollow. 
</P>
<P>
Price objectives. Despite the disapproval of the United States and other oil 
importers, OPEC generally seeks to act like a rational monopolist, manipulating 
its total output so as to maximize current revenues without triggering a 
price-induced contraction in oil's future share of growing world energy demand. 
That is a difficult tightrope to walk, but Saudi Arabia and Kuwait persuaded 
their more bullish OPEC colleagues in March, 1986, that the appropriate price 
was $18 per barrel. 
</P>
<P>
It is impossible to say that the $18 target set in March, 1986, produced 
optimum revenue, but the ensuing growth in oil demand certainly demonstrated 
that it was not too high. Having established a price that would not trigger the 
feared backlash, rational monopolists could be expected to defend its 
purchasing power against erosion from inflation and the devaluation of the 
dollar that is used to settle oil account. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that the collapse of the dollar pointed to a 1990 price of about 
$25 as the equivalent of $18 in 1986, Hussein proposed some adjustment in a 
Feb. 17, 1990, letter to the Emir of Kuwait. He appeared to have the support of 
Saudi King Fahd, who noted in the spring of last year that oil prices would 
reach $26 per barrel by year end, if all countries honored their quotas. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait not only ignored Hussein's reasoned proposal but let it be known that it 
intended to block any increase in the nominal $18 price through the early 
1990s. Although the many proponents of higher oil prices eventually obtained 
Kuwaiti agreement to a $21 barrel compromise price at a July 25 OPEC meeting, 
target prices would mean nothing if Kuwait and the UAE continued to flood the 
market. We will never know whether Kuwait really intended to change its ways, 
because Iraq invaded a week later. 
</P>
<P>
Motive. Before dismissing Hussein's conclusion that such obviously provocative 
policies were motivated by a Sabah conspiracy to weaken Iraq and lure the 
United States into a gulf alliance, Congress should investigate several 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
* Kuwait's formal assertion of a maverick oil policy at the end of March, 1989, 
coincided precisely with the signature by King Fahd and Saddam Hussein of a 
nonaggression pact between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. When Hussein turned down a 
Kuwaiti request for a similar nonaggression pact, the Sabahs needed no further 
reminder of Iraq's so-called historic claim to Kuwait and had to wonder what 
Saudi Arabia would do if Iraq invaded. The Sabahs may have decided that "the 
best defense is a good offense." 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 31, Iraq released what it claimed was a captured Kuwaiti intelligence 
document reporting on a week of meetings held with American officials, 
including CIA Director William Webster, during mid-November last year. The 
document reads, "We agreed with the American side that it was important to take 
advantage of the deteriorating economic structure in Iraq in order to put 
pressure on that country's government to delineate our common border." The CIA 
acknowledged that Webster had received a "routine courtesy call" from senior 
Kuwaiti officials on the indicated date but insisted that nothing about 
Kuwait's relations with Iraq had been discussed "at that meeting." Assuming 
Webster's careful denial to be true, was a proposal for economic pressure 
raised by Kuwaiti officials at meetings with other American officials? If so, 
was it not evidence of Kuwaiti intentions, regardless of whether Washington 
agreed? 
</P>
<P>
These are admittedly sensitive issues, but Congress should not hesitate to ask 
the right questions -- even though we might not like the answers. We are owed 
such an investigation, before we send Americans to die in the cause of 
resisting 'unprovoked aggression'.

WILSON'S SENATE REPLACEMENT IS LIKELY TO BE A SHORT-TIMER; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: VOTERS HAVE NOT FAVORED APPOINTED CANDIDATES. WHOEVER GETS THE JOB 
FACES CONSTANT CAMPAIGNING IN ORDER TO WIN A FULL SIX-YEAR TERM.

<P>
Contrary to popular wisdom, Gov.-elect Pete Wilson won't be doing any big favor 
for the person he appoints to take his seat in the U.S. Senate. The man or 
woman may get the short end of the stick, for the appointee stands only a 4 in 
10 chance of winning election in his or her own right, the record shows. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Senate Historical Office, 33 senators have been appointed 
nationwide since 1960. Seven served as caretakers, choosing not to run in the 
following election. Of the 26 who ran, only 11 won -- a success rate of just 
above 40%. 
</P>
<P>
The last Senate appointee from California was Pierre Salinger, now chief 
foreign correspondent for ABC in Europe. Salinger beat Alan Cranston in the 
June, 1964, Democratic primary, but then before the general election he 
accepted an appointment by former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown to succeed Sen. 
Clair Engle, who died that summer. Salinger still lost the general election to 
Republican song-and-dance man George Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
The person who succeeds Wilson must stand for office at the next general 
election -- by state law designed to ensure that no Senate appointee serve too 
long without voter approval. That puts the next vote just around the corner, in 
1992; Wilson's term expires in 1994, when there would be an election for a full 
six-year term. So whoever takes the job now, and wanting to continue, faces a 
constant four-year campaign and the burden of raising as much as $40 million to 
win two Senate elections in four years. Imagine the plunge in popularity any 
politician would take after that. 
</P>
<P>
So why are so many preening for Wilson's approval? If they really wanted to 
serve in the Senate representing this relatively nonpartisan state, it would be 
more logical to seek the seat of retiring Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston in 
1992. A much better deal: Raise a campaign war chest of $20 million and have 
six years of job security. The political and mental-health risks involved in 
accepting Wilson's two-year seat, compared with running for Cranston's six-year 
post, should cause concerns about the judgment of whoever says "yes" to the 
governor-elect. 
</P>
<P>
After a Florida Thanksgiving and a few days in Washington to tie up loose ends 
in his Senate office, Wilson returned Tuesday to Sacramento with the Senate 
seat topping his agenda. He wants it decided by mid-December so he can get on 
with the real headache of managing the multibillion-dollar deficit left him by 
a fellow Republican, Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
And about that Deukmejian rumor: He will not be Wilson's choice for the Senate. 
Deukmejian refused to seek a third term because, after 28 years in public 
office, he wanted to practice law and more comfortably support his wife, 
Gloria. 
</P>
<P>
But a dozen or so Republicans are waiting for Wilson to pop the question. Women 
are high on the governor-elect's list. It would be a first, a visionary gesture 
and a counter to Democrat Dianne Feinstein's possible Senate candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
There are no back-room king- or queen-making deals being cut, as was the case 
when Ronald Reagan's "kitchen cabinet" took it upon itself to decide Republican 
nominees. 
</P>
<P>
Only three people know who is really under consideration, as opposed to the 
fictitious "short list" floated to pay respect to party conservatives and 
loyalists. They are Wilson and his wife, Gayle, of course, along with Bob 
White, the man who has served as Wilson's chief of staff, confidant and alter 
ego since his San Diego mayoral days. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth L. Khachigian, a strategist for every GOP President since Richard M. 
Nixon, and a Wilson transition-team member, said, "Those who don't know aren't 
talking, and those who do know aren't." 
</P>
<P>
So far the smart money has been on Carla Hills, the U.S. Trade Ambassador and 
former head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development under President 
Gerald R. Ford. She's a Republican moderate, currently immersed in the 
negotiations over the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
Hills is personally close to Wilson and politically in sync with him. That 
means, says a source close to Hills, that she is a fiscal conservative and a 
social moderate. 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising ability is major consideration, and Hills can boast a wide 
spectrum of prominent California friends, from industrialist David Packard to 
Democrat Tom Bradley, who once attempted to name her to the Los Angeles Police 
Commission. An interesting twist: Hills was a Feinstein classmate at Stanford. 
The down side is that she's never been tested on the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
One would obviously look to recent candidates to run for the GOP nomination for 
the Senate. The 1986 state nominee, Ed Zschau, has taken himself out. The 
runner-up, TV commentator Bruce Herschensohn, is a staunch conservative and 
abortion foe. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the California congressional delegation. Rep. Bill Thomas of 
Bakersfield is a liberal, continually taunted by conservatives at state GOP 
conventions. Reps. David Dreier of La Verne and Jerry Lewis of Highland are 
highly regarded within the party. Dreier is a proven fund-raiser with $1.6 
million in the bank; but Lewis is a close Wilson friend. 
</P>
<P>
Hills and Lewis, in that order, rank highest among those familiar with Wilson's 
thinking before he ordered a gag rule on the process. Lewis may have an 
advantage, in Wilson's view, because he is already an elected official -- and 
does have a highly recognizable name. 
</P>
<P>
The most intriguing name to surface so far is that of Condoleezza Rice. The 
National Security Council's director of Soviet affairs, she is the 
highest-ranking black woman in the Bush Administration. Rice, a tenured 
associate professor of political science at Stanford, was recommended to Wilson 
last Monday by State Sen. Becky Morgan (R-Los Altos Hills), as Morgan removed 
herself from the list of potential appointees. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Supervisor Gaddi Vasquez is another possible, since Wilson would 
like to name a minority. But Vasquez was given a platform at the 1988 
Republican National Convention and backed away from running this year. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back on his experience, Salinger, the last Senate appointee from 
California, said recently, "I should not have accepted. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had at that time put out a statement that I very much appreciated what 
Gov. Brown had done -- but it was not my decision, but the decision of the 
people of California to decide . . . I think I would have won the election," he 
said in a KABC-TV interview from London. 
</P>
<P>
Salinger warned Wilson: "Appoint somebody who would like to have an interim 
term as senator until 1992. If it's somebody who wants to extend their 
senatorial career, history proves in the United States that the chances of that 
person being reelected are very, very difficult . . . people do not like the 
idea of voting for someone who's been appointed." 
</P>
<P>
Republicans grouse that if Wilson did make an interim appointment, he would rob 
the GOP of an incumbent's fund-raising advantage. The only prospective 
candidate amenable to such a short-term slot appears to be Herschensohn. 
</P>
<P>
"That's OK with me," he said in a conversation with me. "Two years would be 
just fine and the idea of not campaigning would be a gift." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes there is a strategic reason for interim appointment. The Kennedys 
used one to save John F. Kennedy's Senate seat in 1960 for brother Edward, who, 
at age 28, was two years short of the legal age to run. Elected President, 
J.F.K. asked that former classmate Benjamin Smith be named to his seat. Edward 
M. Kennedy turned 30 in 1962, and Smith bowed out. 
</P>
<P>
A short-termer would allow Wilson's pick to be a full-time senator, while 
another Republican raised money to run for the full term. This idea doesn't 
currently appeal to Wilson. So he is left with deciding who can jump through 
these unprecedented series of political hoops over the next four years. The 
current joke is that Wilson could make his choice based on "the red-eye 
survival test" -- put those under serious consideration on continuous, 
nightlong transcontinental flights and see who survives.

GUN ENTHUSIASTS HELP SISTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Gun Enthusiasts Stage Benefit Shooting Event" (Metro, Nov. 24): 
</P>
<P>
In a society of guns, there are good intentions and then there are better 
intentions. A good effort was made by the members of Gun Owners REACT Committee 
(a group of assault-weapon enthusiasts) who donated half of the event's 
proceeds to the daughters of a pregnant Long Beach woman who was fatally shot 
in yet another round of gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
One of the members even brought the sisters to the "clay pigeon" event to show 
that guns could be used for sport and not for killing. 
</P>
<P>
But 5-year-old Sasha Graves' tearful reaction to the pellet rifle indicates 
that there is a better course of action: stricter gun control laws. At the risk 
of cramping the style of recreational gun users, I ask: How long are we going 
to tolerate the murder of innocent people by guns? Criminal access to firearms 
is far too easy. As long as we tolerate such violence, and sanction it with 
lenient gun control laws, we are the real "clay pigeons."

How disgusting it was to read of what those gun enthusiasts were doing to that

I couldn't believe how insensitive they were to the trauma that girl 
experienced over the shooting of her mother. 
</P>
<P>
If those gun users want to do that girl a favor, they should make a bonfire of 
their instruments of mayhem, and tell her how sorry they were that guns were 
ever invented. At least they should be made to read your front-page story in 
the same edition on how frequent violence is having a traumatic impact on many 
Los Angeles County children ("When Learning to Walk Means Learning to Duck").

THATCHER'S RESIGNATION

It certainly wasn't Thatcherism that pulled Britain up by its bootstraps (front 
page, Nov. 23) but oil found off the coast of Scotland, which became a godsend 
for the ailing British economy and other maladies, and which made Britain an 
oil exporting country. 
</P>

Furthermore, now that the Iron Lady is gone and no longer a stumbling block

THE-WAITING-FOR-GODOT APPROACH TO ASBESTOS; 
</P>
<P>
BUT A WISE JUDGE OFFERS A WAY OUT OF THE LITIGATION JUNGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was nearly 20 years ago that asbestos workers filed the first lawsuits 
against the Johns Manville Corp. for injuries resulting from their exposure to 
asbestos fibers. In that time, Manville has resolved about 22,000 personal 
injury claims. But 130,000 are still pending, and no one can predict how many 
more will still be filed. 
</P>
<P>
Many asbestos victims -- perhaps 12,000 -- have died before they were able to 
receive compensation for the cancer and respiratory illnesses caused by 
Manville's asbestos products. Many others, who suffer from major 
asbestos-caused disabilities and who have lost income and incurred enormous 
medical debts, have been waiting years for their money. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the lawyers nor the court experts in this litigation, however, have had 
to endure the same agonizing wait for their compensation. This inequity -- 
along with questionable filings by plaintiffs' lawyers, deliberate stalling by 
defendants, excessive billing by their attorneys and long-delayed payments to 
victims -- has plagued this litigation since its beginning. The Manville Corp. 
was one of the worst offenders, but by no means the only one. 
</P>
<P>
More than eight years have passed since Manville filed for bankruptcy 
protection from the flood of lawsuits filed against it. Now, more than two 
years have elapsed since the corporation emerged from bankruptcy proceedings to 
begin compensating the tens of thousands of asbestos victims whose claims were 
then pending. 
</P>
<P>
Manville's 1988 bankruptcy reorganization, creating the Manville Personal 
Injury Settlement Trust, was intended to solve many of the problems inherent in 
asbestos litigation. But it failed miserably. Thousands of new claims, far more 
than expected, continued to be filed; the money available to pay those claims 
proved to be grossly inadequate, and all sides maintained their litigious 
posture, causing legal fees to drain as much as two-thirds of the trust's 
funds. As a result, the Manville mess has worsened since 1988 rather than 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, New York Federal District Judge Jack B. Weinstein declared that he 
was fed up with the "wasteful, inefficient war over asbestos" and ordered the 
parties to restructure the Manville Trust so it will pay victims "when they 
need it . . . not 10 or 20 years hence." 
</P>
<P>
The judge recently announced an agreement on restructuring. While there is 
precious little in this shameful chapter about which the civil justice system 
can be proud, the agreement does offer some hope that injured individuals will 
now see some of the money due them during their lifetimes. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement breaks new ground in several respects. The sickest workers will 
now receive their money before those who are not as ill. Plaintiffs' attorneys 
have accepted a cap on their contingency fees. The restructuring agreement also 
pumps more money into the trust to pay claims. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement is solid and innovative, as well as long overdue. We urge that 
the anticipated appeals be decided quickly and that money finally be paid to 
those who have had to wait so long. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Weinstein indicated that he views the Manville agreement as a model for 
other asbestos defendants. In so doing, he joins a growing list of jurists, 
including U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who are 
rightly calling for a fairer, more efficient and more comprehensive approach to 
paying asbestos claims. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, asbestos litigation is far from over. Manville is only one of some 20 
defendants; the recent agreement applies only to claims against Manville. 
</P>
<P>
But we can hope that the important Manville agreement will provide the impetus 
to finally end this two-decade-long legal war of attrition -- a war that has 
for too long been fought over the dead bodies of asbestos workers.

BUSH TAKES THE TOUGH PATH AND SUCCEEDS; 
</P>
<P>
BUT HOW MUCH EFFORT THE SECURITY COUNCIL WILL PUT INTO A MILITARY EFFORT IS 
UNCERTAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANE KIRKPATRICK, Jeane Kirkpatrick writes a syndicated column in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Bush is not only trying to turn back Saddam Hussein's aggression. Like 
Woodrow Wilson and Harry Truman, Bush is deeply, self-consciously engaged in 
trying to create a system of global security. 
</P>
<P>
"The civilized world is now in the process of fashioning the rules that will 
govern the new world order beginning to emerge in the aftermath of the Cold 
War," he wrote in Newsweek magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's dream is global. When he says "we" he means "the civilized world." When 
he says "our" he means "the world community." When he says "we must turn back 
Saddam Hussein," he means all "would-be Saddam Husseins." 
</P>
<P>
His goal is nothing less than a world community based on law. "When we succeed 
. . . we will have demonstrated that aggression will not be tolerated. We will 
have invigorated a United Nations that contributes as its founders dreamed. We 
will have established principles for acceptable international conduct and the 
means to enforce them." 
</P>
<P>
These broader objectives explain why Bush did not choose a "Libyan solution" to 
turn back Hussein, why he has so often turned to the United Nations and so 
emphasized U.N. support for U.S. actions. 
</P>
<P>
They explain why Bush decided to seek an explicit, specific authorization for 
the use of force from the U.N. Security Council, even though the United States 
and its allies could easily and perhaps more expeditiously have acted under 
Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. That article provides: "Nothing in the present 
charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective 
self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations, 
until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain 
international peace and security." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has also sought to strengthen the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that, in the process of dealing with Saddam Hussein and 
establishing new principles of international conduct, Bush is also 
demonstrating the many obstacles to an effective global system of collective 
security. 
</P>
<P>
Even in this "singular moment" in history, with the Cold War divisions that 
paralyzed the United Nations overcome and the blocs partially neutralized, it 
remains difficult to deal with a clear-cut case of aggression. The process of 
consultation and consensus has proved cumbersome, time-consuming and, in a 
fundamental sense, irrational. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council is hardly an ideal arena through which to seek 
peace in a conflict between two gulf states. The composition of that body is a 
major obstacle. Grant the dubious proposition that the five permanent members 
-- the United States, Britain, France, China and the Soviet Union -- and Canada 
are involved in all problems by virtue of their broad involvement in the world. 
Grant that Yemen has a large stake as a neighbor in the region. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves Colombia, Ethiopia, Finland, Malaysia, the Ivory Coast, Cuba, 
Romania and Zaire. Collectively, they have the power to decide the outcome even 
though they have no special knowledge of the countries or the regions and no 
special stake in that outcome. Since they will risk neither lives nor money in 
this conflict, they are good examples of representation without taxation. 
</P>
<P>
Article 51 is a more reasonable basis for acting than a procedure in which 
those prepared to resist an aggressor must seek permission from those who are 
not. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, no one knows how stable the Security Council consensus 
supporting military action will prove, nor how much effort the council will 
make to manage the conflict once it is under way -- although it is clear that 
the council lacks the unity, will and dispatch needed for decisive action. We 
know only that the process of producing global consensus is complex, laborious, 
expensive and reasonably effective. 
</P>
<P>
Mobilizing this diverse body has already required weeks of shuttling around the 
globe by Bush and Baker, untold hours of negotiation and God knows how many 
quiet commitments to Security Council members. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Washington, the clamor among Democrats reminds the Administration 
that world consensus is not enough. George Bush needs Congress as well. 
</P>
<P>
And before those consultations are done, Bush may feel closer to Yemen and 
Zaire than to Sam Nunn and Christopher Dodd.

CHANGING BEHAVIOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE WHITEHORSE of the Vista Community Clinic in San Diego County heads 
up communitywide programs aimed at improving health habits. She spoke about the 
special difficulties of getting through to the Latino community. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everyone wants to be healthy, but sometimes other needs come first. When we 
talk about cardio-vascular risk reduction, we're talking about getting people 
to change behaviors now, so that they don't get heart disease 20 years from 
now. 
</P>
<P>
That's real difficult for any ethnic group to deal with, but I think with the 
Latino belief, which tends to be more fatalistic -- that many of these things 
related to health are in God's hands, for instance -- it becomes more difficult 
to grasp the idea (of preventive measures) and to become active in taking 
control of their own health. 
</P>
<P>
But what we've found is that once people become educated, that turns around and 
they become very active and involved. 
</P>
<P>
We have an 18-member coalition of Latino leaders. Some are physicians, but we 
also have people who are just interested citizens. They're taking over a lot of 
the activities, and that's one of the goals -- to get people to realize that 
they do have something to do with their own health.

<P>
SOW THE FERTILE GROUND OF THE EAST;

THE SKILLS, RESOURCES AND MARKETS EXIST FOR A ROBUST TURNAROUND IN THE EAST, IF

<TEXT>
<P>
As the unification of Germany progresses, the economic transformation of the 
old East is proving more complex than the early enthusiasts imagined. The 
industrial conglomerates, or kombinates, are particularly resistant to being 
turned around in the Western mold; indeed, many are unsalvageable, since they 
are committed by design to self-sufficiency, even at the price of efficiency. 
As we now can see, it is questionable whether Germany needs another steel plant 
east of Berlin, or a car designed and built entirely in the former eastern 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
It would be tragic, however, if the skills of the workers employed in those 
sectors were no longer utilized. Attractive options exist, such as the 
production of automotive parts and components, whether under German, European, 
American or Japanese management. It is not car plants in the traditional sense 
(which often are nothing more than assembly facilities) but the manufacturing 
of parts and components that overwhelmingly accounts for the output of the 
entire industry. 
</P>
<P>
We also need to put more stock in the strong suits of the already 
well-established economy. Small- and medium-sized companies may be a far better 
indicator of economic progress. They are a key ingredient of West Germany's 
economic success and many of them export on a global scale. In the East German 
case, they provide an important source of new employment: Middle-of-the-road 
estimates predict the creation of 1.5 million jobs from this source alone over 
the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
What about the services sector? What about our own experiences in the banking 
field? Deutsche Bank made a half-billion-dollar investment in about 150 bank 
branches in East Germany on July 1 and expects to reach the break-even point 
around the turn of the year. Even in the absence of an acceptable level of 
telecommunications and data-processing facilities, we have opened as many as 
6,000 to 7,000 accounts a day. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, skeptics are quick to cite a number of insurmountable problems. 
Accordingly, many misperceptions linger. 
</P>
<P>
One comment often made is that the economy remains in trouble because banks 
cannot make loans in the absence of meaningful balance sheets, or at least a 
solid business plan. In fact, the situation is much like the early to mid-1950s 
when banks could also not go "by the book." Under such circumstances, one 
simply has to develop an eye for the entrepreneurial talents of the loan 
applicant sitting across the table to determine whether he or she can actually 
carry a loan of 50,000 deutschemarks to buy two cabs, or considerably more to 
set up a small trucking company. 
</P>
<P>
Another oft-cited issue is employee motivation. East Germans are supposedly 
reacting with indifference to the changed circumstances in the work place. In 
our business, however, we have found a very high degree of motivation among our 
8,500 new employees, although most of them are former employees of the once 
sleepy state bank. Younger people especially are very willing to adapt to the 
free market. And virtually everybody responds favorably to the end of uniform 
pay. With pay based on performance rather than mere presence, there is a reason 
to work hard. 
</P>
<P>
The salaries and wages we pay to our employees in the former East German 
territory average 50% of those in West Germany. Since the cost of living in the 
former has actually declined since the introduction of the deutschemark, that 
pay level is quite attractive. This should be good news to those who consider 
investing in Germany but worry about its high labor costs. The availability of 
locations for industrial sites and the skills of the work force also weigh in 
favorably. In addition, anybody willing to invest there can count on various 
tax incentives from Brussels or Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
Other observers worry about the excessive costs of such a venture -- which in 
light of the long-term benefits should more appropriately be termed an 
investment. While the outlays for a new infrastructure are certainly very 
large, they also need to be kept in proper perspective. East Germany, unlike 
all other East European countries, had little public debt. Therefore, even if 
one assumes the "real price tag" of German economic unification to reach a 
volume of 250 billion deutschemarks over the next three years, the country's 
level of per-capita indebtedness would not rise above what it is today. So the 
message for the capital markets is this: While there may be more debt in 
absolute terms, the structure of public finance in Germany is going to stay the 
same. And there will be 16 million more taxpayers to meet that bill. 
</P>
<P>
But the former East Germany needs more than money. Perhaps no task before us is 
more important than the transfer of know-how. For example, East Germany does 
not have a viable system of tax collection. Rather than officials from the 
finance ministry, what is truly needed are managers of local tax offices who 
have the experience to get basic day-to-day operations up and running. Advice 
has to be offered not so much from the top down but from the bottom up. 
</P>
<P>
I know of a number of owners of carpenter shops or small construction companies 
who are engaged in joint venture in the East or render advice informally on 
issues such as where to buy materials, at what prices, and on which terms. In a 
place where marketing and purchasing skills are completely underdeveloped, 
their expertise falls on fertile ground. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, one has to be very much aware of a delicate psychological balance in 
this effort of turning things around. Here again, we Germans face a challenge. 
We will have to watch the fine line that lies between offering advice and 
teaching with the proverbial index finger raised up high.

A 39-year-old police sergeant assigned to security during the monthlong 
enthronement ceremonies for Emperor Akihito has died from overwork, police say. 
</P>
<P>
The officer, Haruo Okada of Tokyo, died of acute heart failure after collapsing 
at home last week, a city police official said. 
</P>
<P>
The official said Okada had taken only two days off from Oct. 27 to Nov. 25 
because of the huge security operation for Akihito's enthronement ceremonies, 
which began early in November. Okada worked 26-hour shifts, followed by 20 
hours off, until his death.

KUWAIT CHILDREN IN EXILE SKETCH MIXTURE OF HOPE AND ANGER, SNAKES, TANKS, 
PLANES

<TEXT>
<P>
American warplanes and tanks pound Iraq's armed forces as the world kicks Iraq 
out of Kuwait. Or, an Iraqi snake strangles the Persian Gulf emirate. 
</P>
<P>
Such images -- drawn or colored by Kuwaiti children -- display a curious 
mixture of anger at Iraqi President Saddam Hussein with an almost naive hope 
that their country will be freed soon. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti youth aged 4 to 18 composed the drawings in exile in the last few 
months in the Geneva area, where hundreds of families have stayed or fled to 
after the Iraqi invasion in August. 
</P>
<P>
Their imaginative artwork was displayed in an exhibition in London and Geneva 
in November, and the organizers plan to take it to Vienna, Paris and other 
cities in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
"He's no good," Nora, 4, said of the Iraqi leader. "He killed Kuwaitis. He 
burned houses in Kuwait. He destroyed cars. He exhausted the petrol." 
</P>
<P>
But she added hopefully: "Kuwait will be returned." 
</P>
<P>
Nora had drawn a simple picture of a Kuwaiti child giving flowers to the emir 
of Kuwait and to President Bush -- on whom many of the children seem to pin 
their hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Other drawings portrayed a strong arm of the United Nations plucking Saddam off 
the world, or a man with a globe as a head booting an Iraqi soldier out. 
</P>
<P>
One picture has small, white-robed Kuwaitis tying up a giant Saddam, swastika 
on his officer's cap, and staking him to the ground while raising Kuwaiti flags 
once again -- reflecting the small but growing Kuwaiti army training to fight 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. Navy did help escort Kuwaiti oil out of the Gulf during the 
latter part of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, most Gulf Arabs seemed embarrassed by 
their friendship with Washington -- until Iraq took over Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The children in this exhibition made clear, however, that they are friends of 
any who came to their aid. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven-year-old May depicted children of France, Italy, Germany, the United 
States, Japan, Turkey and Egypt offering their help and sympathy to a crying 
Kuwaiti girl. 
</P>
<P>
For every sign of hope, however, there was one of sadness or hatred. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very angry. Saddam is like a snake. He's a crazy man. He took my country," 
said 12-year-old Shoroq, standing in front of her graphic depiction of a snake 
squeezing the life out of the map of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Another depicted a dog biting the hand -- in the national Kuwaiti colors of 
red, green, black and white -- that fed it. Kuwait had provided billions of 
dollars to help Iraq in its war with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi jets drop bombs while Iraqi soldiers fire on a flaming house in the 
imagination of 6-year-old Sheikha. Inside the house, tears fall from the cheeks 
of two tiny children waving flags. 
</P>
<P>
Saddam is depicted variously as a blood-dripping, fanged Dracula, as a lazy man 
on a settee watching his Kuwait in a bird cage, or as a shark or vacuum cleaner 
swallowing up all Kuwait's goods. 
</P>
<P>
One rear view portrays an Iraqi soldier showing "friendship" with his arm 
around the shoulder of a white-robed Kuwaiti. Behind the Iraqi's back he holds 
a sharp dagger. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the bloody pictures are by the kids who were in Kuwait at the time of 
the invasion. Those who were outside the country used their imagination based 
on what they heard," said banker Mahmood, one of the organizers. 
</P>
<P>
Like others at the Geneva exhibition, he asked that his family name not be 
revealed for fear of Iraqi reprisals against his relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Our children are not enjoying their childhood. They don't play. They sit and 
talk about how they can play a trick on Saddam, or how to kill him," said 
Mahmood, himself a father. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the organizers, 21-year-old Kuwait University student Huda, 
explained the feeling most of the Kuwaiti exile community seemed to feel toward 
fighting to drive out Saddam, a sentiment that the children have taken on and 
understood. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want war. But if he refuses to get out of Kuwait, this is the only 
solution. He refuses every peaceful solution."

KUWAITI RECRUITS TRADE IN BMWS FOR BAYONETS AS THEY TRAIN TO SEIZE BACK EMIRATE 
</P>

DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first thing you notice is the new cars. Dozens of them are parked neatly on 
either side of the desert track, relics of a time when the choice between 
Mercedes and BMW still seemed important to their owners. 
</P>
<P>
Now those owners are lined up on the hardpan field, breathing dust while a 
large man with a Castro beard leads them in judo maneuvers. They roar, and 
thrust their left fists forward in unison. They roar again, and attack the air 
with their right. 
</P>
<P>
In their sweat pants and fake designer T-shirts these recruits are not a sight 
to strike fear into an Iraqi soldier's heart. But the purpose of this Kuwaiti 
army training camp is perhaps more political than military -- an attempt to 
show that Kuwait's once-pampered princes will do more to get their country back 
than just pay costs for U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the cars, one enthusiastic 25-year-old recruit rolled his eyes. 
"Everybody asks that question," Ahmed Dhafeeri said. "If I drive a nice car, if 
I wear nice clothing, that doesn't mean I don't love my country." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, but what kind of car does he drive? 
</P>
<P>
He laughed, and for a moment became a carefree graduate student again. "A 
Mercedes," he said, "but I left something better behind in Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
What might that be? "The land," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the parking lot on its outskirts, the camp where Dhafeeri spent a 
month of training looks like a military relic of World War I. It is a square of 
hard-packed desert sand, perhaps 300 yards on a side, hemmed in by rows of 
white military tents. About 600 Kuwaiti youths trained there recently for the 
civil guard, or militia. 
</P>
<P>
In their 30-day term they learned military drill, some hand-to-hand combat and 
basic weapon skills such as field-stripping a rifle. 
</P>
<P>
On one particular day, the field was busy. In the foreground, a group of 
uniformed recruits engaged in what appeared to be bayonet training. The 
exercise included stabbing at the ground with their muzzles, a move a European 
TV crew found particularly engrossing and filmed at length. A second uniformed 
group sat patiently on the ground, watching an instructor quickly strip and 
clean a submachine gun. 
</P>
<P>
The third group was still practicing martial arts. Their instructor, a burly 
man in camouflage fatigues, said he is a sergeant in the regular Kuwaiti army. 
He said he is proud of his charges. 
</P>
<P>
"They have guts," Sgt. Qubail Rashidi said through an interpreter. "They are 
anxious to go and fight." 
</P>
<P>
But would they be ready to face trained Iraqi fighting forces, with tanks and 
artillery? 
</P>
<P>
"They are children," Rashidi said contemptuously of the Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the trainees are quite so sanguine. Dhafeeri conceded that as a 
fighting force this still-ragged civil guard isn't as good as the 
battle-hardened Iraqis. But the Iraqis, he said, wouldn't be as motivated as a 
Kuwaiti force fighting to get back its country. "We fight for a goal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dhafeeri, who was studying criminology at Marshall University in West Virginia, 
said about 40% of the recruits here are, or were, students like himself. 
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 Kuwaiti soldiers escaped the invading Iraqis. One thousand are now 
on the front lines, said Col. Faleh, former head of Kuwait's military academy 
and an infantry veteran of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. 
</P>
<P>
Asked obliquely if this force might get in the way instead of helping in a 
fight, Faleh appears indignant. "They should help free their country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, a trainee sidled up to a visiting reporter and shyly asked him if he's 
an American. Hussein Mutari said his family is now living in Louisiana with his 
brother, an engineer. "They said, 'Come with us.' I said no." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he has any message for his family, he looked at the ground. Then he 
leaned forward, and almost in a whisper said, "Tell them I'm OK."

COTTAGES HOUSE ELDERLY CLOSE TO FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dilemma: Your grandparents can't keep up their big house and they don't want to 
move to a retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
Solution: A portable, factory-built cottage for your back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Developer J. Robert Gillette calls the cottages America's answer to Australia's 
"granny flats." 
</P>
<P>
A cottage, which can be hooked up to household utilities, sells for about 
$50,000 or can be rented at $600 to $700 a month. Then an elderly relative can 
live nearby without crowding the family. 
</P>
<P>
Gillette wants the first cottages to be built on the grounds of senior citizen 
complexes. Cottage occupants will have more privacy and pay less than residents 
of the complex itself, but still have easy access to social gatherings, meals 
and services such as laundry. 
</P>
<P>
Trial programs in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Texas and California have shown 
that what the American Assn. of Retired Persons calls the Elder Cottage Housing 
Opportunity can work. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very cozy," Pauline Wessner, 85, said in an interview at the ECHO cottage 
she has occupied for two years near Belvedere, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Wessner's grandson thought of her when the county Office on Aging announced an 
ECHO trial program. He had bought the house where she lived for nearly 40 
years, and she had moved to an apartment. She said: "It was too much work for 
me to mow the grass and everything else." 
</P>
<P>
"I live right next door to my grandson now, about 45 feet from his house," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The county bought the cottage and leases it to her for at rent that is based on 
her Social Security income. She has a bedroom, a bathroom, a parlor and a fully 
equipped kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps 100 of the little houses have been set up nationwide, said Leah Dobkin 
of the AARP in Washington. The AARP has published outlines for developers and 
local governments about zoning, parking and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
It's better than backing a trailer in, Dobkin said. "These are specially 
designed for the elderly, and they meet all housing codes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gillette's cottage plans show ramps for people who don't want to climb stairs, 
wide doors, bathtub rails and kitchen sinks without the usual cabinets 
underneath that keep wheelchair users at arm's length. 
</P>
<P>
Gillette said he'll erect four cottages at the American House Dearborn Heights, 
Mich., complex by spring. 
</P>
<P>
That the cottages are detached is a key for people such as Wessner, who want to 
live near their families but not in the same house. 
</P>
<P>
"That wouldn't go," Wessner said. "They have two teen-agers who like loud 
music. Grandma's a little too old for that now." 
</P>
<P>
"My grandson stops in every morning with the newspaper for me. They invite me 
over, which I appreciate. I go over there on Sunday for coffee and a bun." 
</P>
<P>
On holidays, she said, "We eat together. Unless I'm invited somewhere else."

MEXICO REFORMS MEAN LITTLE TO POOR IN GARBAGE DUMP

<TEXT>
<P>
Eight-year-old Pancho lives and works amid the flies, roaches and rats that 
feed on the vast open-air garbage dump in this dusty town on the outskirts of 
Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
He has never been to school and says he cannot remember the last time he left 
the garbage dump for a glimpse of what he refers to as "the clean world" 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
Like his parents and thousands of other children across Mexico City, Pancho is 
a pepenador, or scavenger. He wades through tons of garbage every day to search 
for recyclable goods and anything else of value. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to go to school because I can help my mother when I stay home," 
says Pancho, whose only toys, a broken plastic truck and a one-armed Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtle, were found in the dump. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have to work so we can have enough to eat," Pancho added, a shy grin 
forming on his dirt-caked face. 
</P>
<P>
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has been given high marks for his efforts 
to open up the economy and make Mexico a more attractive place for foreign 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
The reform-minded Salinas has also launched a high-profile "Solidarity Program" 
aimed at easing the plight of the poor in a nation where half the population 
lives in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
But Solidarity and the economic recovery Mexico has experienced over the last 
two years have yet to reach places like the Atizapan dump. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to get out of here. But where are my family and I supposed to go?" 
said Pancho's father, Enrique Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, 48, said he was a construction worker and electrician. But he said he 
was unable to find work outside of the dump and garbage is now all that stands 
between his family and starvation. 
</P>
<P>
"We eat what rich people throw away," he said bitterly, pointing to a sack full 
of rotting potatoes on the dirt floor of his one-room shack. 
</P>
<P>
The copper wire, tin cans, cardboard, iron and even bones that Garcia, his wife 
and Pancho sell to recycling companies provide them with an income of up to 
about $30 a week. Some weeks are better than others, however, and the work is 
nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia and other residents of Atizapan recall with resentment how officials of 
Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party visited the dump to urge 
people to vote for the PRI in local elections recently. 
</P>
<P>
"They came to ask for votes but they didn't offer anything in return," Garcia 
said. "The government doesn't help us. It doesn't do anything for people like 
us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is, you don't see much of the government around here," said Raul 
Martinez Esquivel, a 19-year-old who said he had been living in the dump with 
his nine brothers and sisters since he was 4. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard work and you have to put your back into it or you don't make enough 
to eat," Martinez said. "You get used to it, though," he added. "It's a job, 
after all, and since I never studied, what else can I do?" 
</P>
<P>
The Atizapan dump, which is home to more than 100 families, is one of four 
open-air garbage pits in the Mexico City area. Its residents say they fear the 
government may soon shut it down, however, to cut down on Mexico City's chronic 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The dump caught fire earlier this year, causing it to belch out dense plumes of 
toxic smoke for several days. 
</P>
<P>
"The government doesn't help us. They don't even want to leave the dump here so 
we can keep working. Where are we going to go if they close it down?" asked one 
woman resident. 
</P>
<P>
"Life is hard," she said. "But if they shut this down it will be even harder 
and some of us might even die of hunger."

Nearly a year after the U.S. military invasion that toppled strongman Manuel 
Noriega, only 37% of Panamanians believe the invasion brought more benefits 
than problems, according to a poll published Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The poll, in the daily La Prensa, also showed that only 43% are in favor of the 
U.S. military presence in their country. About 10,000 U.S. troops are stationed 
in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
A separate poll conducted in January had shown 89% were in favor of the Dec. 
20, 1989, U.S. invasion that ousted Noriega, now in a Miami prison awaiting 
trial on drug and racketeering charges.

Barry Alpert is learning that the gift of gab can be as critical to his medical 
practice as his skill with a scalpel. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors say that poor communication with patients is a leading cause of missed 
diagnoses. Lawyers say that the problem is cited in many malpractice lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of malpractice cases go away simply because they like the doctor," said 
Pittsburgh attorney Edwin H. Beachler III. 
</P>
<P>
Alpert, a cardiologist at West Penn Hospital in Pittsburgh, said he can't 
evaluate his own communications skills. But he said patients have come to him 
after having difficulty dealing with other doctors. 
</P>
<P>
He said he suspects that some of his own former patients may have the same 
complaint about him. 
</P>
<P>
Alpert is not alone. Roughly 80% of 300 doctors surveyed nationwide by the 
pharmaceutical division of Miles Inc. regard effective communication with 
patients as "extremely important." Only one-third said they communicate "very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of physicians are exceptionally sensitive about their relationships with 
their patients," Alpert said. They don't want to be told how to conduct their 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to improve his abilities, Alpert took part in a seminar offered by 
Miles at West Penn earlier this year. The four-hour program has been presented 
this year at two dozen hospitals, medical schools and health maintenance 
organizations around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Vaughn Keller, who led the Pittsburgh session, told doctors part of the problem 
stems from differences in background. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians are trained to rely on a rigorous decision-making process in making 
a diagnosis, Keller said. Patients, on the other hand, rarely get right to the 
point with physicians, said J. Gregory Carroll, a corporate training specialist 
at Miles, a West Haven, Conn., company. 
</P>
<P>
"A patient may start by telling a story about lower back pain and may be 
warming up to something they're not ready to talk about," Carroll said. "The 
patient may wait till the end of the interview, when he has his hand on the 
door knob, to say, 'Oh, by the way, doctor, should I be worried about this 
swelling . . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
Doctors need to be able to recognize when a patient is hedging and should try 
to draw out relevant "pieces of the clinical puzzle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just an educational gap. It's really two different world views," 
Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
Terminology can be a problem, too. 
</P>
<P>
Keller urged seminar participants to encourage their patients to be more open 
about medical problems and said doctors should give specific instructions for 
medication, exercise, therapy and other treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The extra effort Keller and Carroll prescribe can have benefits for doctors. 
Several attorneys said better relations can reduce a physician's chance of 
being sued for malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors who don't get sued are the ones who take the time to explain, 
'this could happen or this could happen' and give their patients what we call 
informed consent," said Beachler. 
</P>
<P>
"Without exaggeration, in half if not three-quarters of these cases, one of the 
complaints these people have is they don't like the way they were treated." 
</P>
<P>
A typical patient's hospital stay might involve seeing four or five doctors. 
"Sometimes, you feel like you're on a conveyor belt," said Pittsburgh attorney 
John C. Conti, who represents physicians. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, many medical schools added courses designed to teach 
students how to conduct efficient discussions with patients. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those things that people used to say, 'Well, you pick it up," said 
Dr. Stanley K. Dorst, who teaches a required course, introduction to patient 
care, at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Dorst disagrees that communication is "part of the art of medicine" and can't 
be taught. "It's a skill and you need to practice it."

ATOMIC BOMB'S CRADLE NOT ROCKED BY WORRIES ON POLLUTION, RADIATION

OAK RIDGE, Tenn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If ever there was a company town, this was it. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Ridge didn't grow up around the company. The company built it from scratch, 
filled it with employees, paid them well and told them to keep their mouths 
shut if they loved their country. 
</P>
<P>
The company is the government of the United States. The Oak Ridge plant built 
the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, to hasten the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
There have long been lingering concerns that the bomb makers put into motion a 
slow death for residents of the hills outside Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the government has admitted spilling, leaking, burying, 
pouring, burning and losing millions of tons of hazardous and radioactive 
materials in and around the 55-square-mile federal reservation. 
</P>
<P>
But the Department of Energy says that the days of environmental indifference 
are over, and most of the people who live and work here apparently believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"Questions about the environment or our personal safety never enter my mind," 
said Garrett Asher, a real estate broker in Oak Ridge. "I don't think that's 
because we've always lived here. I think it's because we realize any problems 
they have are on the reservation and not within the city of Oak Ridge." 
</P>
<P>
Not all citizens think the plants are benign. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's awful if it's as bad as we read in the papers, but you have to 
keep in mind that, through the years, it was worse that people were ignorant of 
it," says Mary Lou Gross, who has lived in Oak Ridge since 1946 and used to 
work at the bomb plant. She now is personnel administrator for EG &amp; G 
Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
"During all the years we were doing weapons I thought they were a deterrent, 
and I still think so, but we need to give more thought to the pollution. We're 
at the mercy of the government in this, and I feel sure they're just telling us 
what they want us to know." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Hibbitts, the Energy Department's deputy assistant manager for 
environment, safety and quality at Oak Ridge, said environmental concerns have 
moved steadily upward in the agency's priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"We're smarter than we were," he said. "The people who were here 40 and 50 
years ago did the best they could with the knowledge that was available to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
There was no settlement of significance in the valleys 30 miles northwest of 
Knoxville until the government decided in 1942 that this would be a nice, 
secluded place to build atomic bombs. 
</P>
<P>
Three plants were built for the Manhattan Project. They were known as X-10, the 
second nuclear reactor on the planet; K-25, a huge facility designed to 
increase the fissionable isotope of uranium, and Y-12, a second big plant that 
used a different technology to the same purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Secrecy was paramount. During the war, few of the employees knew that they were 
making the most destructive weapons the world had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
The legacy of secrecy remains today. Critics say it is a veil behind which the 
Energy Department hides environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an absolute, institutional bias within DOE to downplay the potential 
problems of radioactive material," said Steven Smith, a veterinary student at 
the University of Tennessee and father of two who heads the Oak Ridge 
Environmental Peace Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"They are constantly on the defensive. I'm not sure I want DOE people, who have 
a vested interest in seeing this industry flourish, evaluating for me what is 
an acceptable risk." 
</P>
<P>
The X-10 plant evolved over the years into the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 
Y-12 remains in operation as a nuclear weapons factory; K-25 was shut down in 
1985 because it was too expensive to operate. 
</P>
<P>
In the 48 years since the plants were built, the town of Oak Ridge has 
flourished. 
</P>
<P>
The populace of about 30,000 is one of the best-educated and best-paid in the 
state. The plants employ about 17,000 people and indirectly support numerous 
satellite businesses in the region. 
</P>
<P>
But there is more than a paycheck. There is a sense here of being part of a 
great national mission, even if it is making bombs. 
</P>
<P>
"The people here are willing to accept an additional risk because they feel the 
benefit of what was done here far outweighs the resulting costs," Hibbitts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Ridge Mayor Roy Pruett, who works at the Y-12 plant, said: "I think the 
farther away from Oak Ridge you get, the more you hear about the pollution. We 
know where it is. We've characterized it and it is no threat to us." 
</P>
<P>
People outside Oak Ridge don't understand or appreciate what goes on behind the 
plant gates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a community in the world where radiation is understood, it is this 
one. I know exactly how much radiation I'm exposed to every day. Do you?" 
Pruett asked. 
</P>
<P>
An Environmental Quality Advisory Board keeps the city government informed. The 
chairman is Jerry Kuhaida, a project manager with the federal government's 
prime contractor in Oak Ridge, Martin Marietta Energy Systems. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived in places that were a heck of a lot worse, because of the 
unknowns," Kuhaida said. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, you know, generally, what you've been exposed to. I think there is an 
effort on the part of these facilities to keep some control over those 
discharges." 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department claims to have spent more than $1 billion to clean up the 
area in the last 10 years. There was a time when radioactive and hazardous 
waste was just buried in shallow trenches. The cleanup effort involves digging 
up that waste and packaging it in more stable containers. The agency also has 
drained settling ponds and paved them over. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is satisfied with the cleanup effort. 
</P>
<P>
Lawsuits have been filed over mercury contamination of the watershed. Creeks 
near the plants are posted "no fishing or swimming." 
</P>
<P>
Environmental scientists are measuring hazardous materials in the bottom of a 
lake downstream. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics on the work force from the 1940s on show no substantial rise in 
mortality, said Donna L. Cragle, deputy program leader for the Center of 
Epidemiologic Research at Oak Ridge Associated Universities. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say it's not any worse than any other place," she said. "There are 
mortality studies related to many industries and, generally, these workers look 
like most of those. There aren't any of the real strong mortality relationships 
you see with some of the others." 
</P>
<P>
She said there has never been a thorough study of the plants' public-health 
impact on the general population around the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Hibbitts called living in Oak Ridge a matter of "adjusting to a perception of 
risk." 
</P>
<P>
"The sorts of things we talk about, as far as the risk of working or living 
here, are very small compared to the risks I live with on a daily basis," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of radiation exposure I get from working here is a very tiny part 
of the radiation exposure I get just for being a human being. If I want to 
manage my risk in terms of exposure, I don't move from Oak Ridge. I ventilate 
my house to get rid of the radon." 
</P>
<P>
Some critics of the plants are opposed to nuclear weapons on principle. They 
stage a protest demonstration here every Aug. 6, the anniversary of the 
Hiroshima bombing, and usually manage to get arrested for trespassing on 
government property. 
</P>
<P>
The Peace Alliance headed by Smith is the most visible critic of the Energy 
Department's management. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we pardon the past, they're still experimenting, putting citizens at 
risk because they've got such a mess they don't know what to do with it," Smith 
said. "They have tremendous problems out there. I'm not trying to just 
criticize, because I know they've got some good people out there doing their 
best, but it's time for this entire country to reassess its nuclear policy." 
</P>
<P>
He said the question that should be asked is whether the plants "have been 
protecting us or poisoning us." 
</P>
<P>
"We're just shifting the burden to the next generation, and I can't go along 
with that," he said. "The fact that they're still producing nuclear weapons is 
not acceptable. The greatest threat to me and my children is the pollution, not 
some other country's nuclear weapons." 
</P>
<P>
Smith suggested that another mighty national effort may be the only way to 
reverse the legacy of the earlier one: "We need a Manhattan Project II to clean 
it up." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that his group, with a core of about 50 people and a mailing list of 
3,000, encounters some enmity in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"But we've found there is a lot of support out there for what we're doing. I 
think there would be more, except for the economics. . . . We're constantly 
being forced to choose between short-term economic well being and long-term 
environmental well-being and, to me, that is blackmail." 
</P>
<P>
Hibbitts disagreed. He said that people here are not shrinking violets and 
would, if convinced that their lives were endangered, raise as much of a 
protest as necessary to change the situation. 
</P>
<P>
The latest environmental flap to ensue from the government reservation is the 
pollution of Watts Bar Lake, just downstream on the Clinch River. 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department held two public hearings this summer to explain the 
problem and what is being done, which is mainly studying the nature and extent 
of the pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Energy officials said that most of the pollution is buried in the 
deepest and most stable sediments of the lake, and is therefore safely out of 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Humphreys is mayor of Kingston, a small town on Watts Bar just southwest of 
Oak Ridge. He attended the first hearing, he said, and "felt some assurance 
after that. I think they're doing more than people realize to monitor that 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Humphreys said that residents are concerned, but added: "We've run every kind 
of test in the world and, according to those, we have nothing to be alarmed 
about." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Humphreys said, people probably will find little to worry about. 
Certainly not enough to call down the economic force that may be putting bread 
on their tables. 
</P>
<P>
"Oak Ridge is the livelihood for a big percentage of Kingston. That makes a 
difference in the way they think."

ORPHAN TRAINS TRANSPORTED SOME TO NEW LIVES, OTHERS INTO A NIGHTMARE OF ABUSE

<TEXT>
<P>
Time hasn't faded 77-year-old Harold Williams' memory of leaving New York City 
along with other orphans on a train taking them to new homes in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember standing on the platform and then going into the train and sitting 
down with my teddy bear in my lap," he said. "I recall looking out the window 
and seeing all the people and the buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Many orphaned or abandoned children benefited from the Orphan Train Movement, 
which lasted from 1854 to 1929. Others merely had their suffering relocated. 
</P>
<P>
Their tales, good and bad, were told at an Orphan Train reunion attended by 
about two dozen people who took part in the unusual social experiment that sent 
more than 100,000 children to foster homes far from the big city. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1929, me and my twin brother were put on the last orphan train out to 
Kansas," said Alan Bankston, 64, of Dayton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"We wound up with adoptive parents," he said. "They gave us everything we 
needed, except love. And love is what we needed the most." 
</P>
<P>
Bankston wept during part of his talk. He said although he and his wife had six 
children, they took in two foster children "because I knew how important it was 
to have someone love you." 
</P>
<P>
The Orphan Train came at a time when New York City was inundated by European 
immigrants who crowded tenements on the Lower East Side. Poverty and disease 
were rampant. Many children were orphaned or left to fend for themselves on the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Smith, 72, of Trenton, N.J., was only 49 days old when a well-dressed 
woman left him in a wicker basket in Gimbel's department store. When he was 4 
years old, he boarded a train for a new life on an Iowa farm. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he was lucky to be taken in by a loving family, but he admitted that 
the mystery of the woman who left him behind haunted him. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I sort of put it aside," he said. "I decided it was a door I wasn't meant 
to open. I don't feel bad about my mother. I assume she was in circumstances 
beyond her control." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, of Magalia, Calif., said he is still angry at his mother. "I was a 
cute little baby, only 16 days old," he said. "How could she dump me?" 
</P>
<P>
He said he spent most of his childhood with "an old lady who was a tyrant and 
her five daughters." 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared to death of her," Williams said. "If I became sick, I got beaten. 
She had this theory that if you got sick, you'd done something bad." 
</P>
<P>
Williams left that home at 17, after years of being "abused mentally, 
physically and sexually." 
</P>
<P>
He became a homeless alcoholic but pulled his life together with the help of a 
job at a dairy plant. He later became plant manager and got married. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-one-year-old Winifred Williams, no relation, of Temple Hills, Md., 
looked at her husband, Lawrence, while she spoke to the group. 
</P>
<P>
"To be an orphan means to survive," she said. "You don't have a parent or a 
mother to love you. You tell yourself you will survive until you find someone 
who will love you.

AS LAKE DRIES UP, THE REMAINS OF SUBMERGED TOWN APPEAR

An old bridge has risen and foundations are peeking up from the water as the 
town of Monticello -- destroyed and flooded more than 30 years ago -- reemerges 
from a drought-shrunken lake. 
</P>
<P>
With each dry day, receding Lake Berryessa reveals more remains of the town, 
once a thriving farming community before the government claimed it for a dam 
and reservoir in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"There was almost nothing left when they got through," remembered Harold 
Moskowitz, 64. "They paid us off, gave buildings away, tore some down and 
burned some. What they couldn't burn they buried." 
</P>
<P>
Now hundreds of tourists and former town residents are trekking to the lake, 
about 50 miles northeast of San Francisco, to glimpse the past and remember the 
town's century of life. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are coming back because they are still distressed and remember 
being uprooted," said Ronnie McGuinnis, a maintenance worker for the U.S. 
Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the lake and recreational area. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 people lived in the valley around the turn of the century but the 
population dwindled to about 125 by the 1950s when water was getting scarce as 
Northern California grew. The federal government formed a plan with Solano 
County to dam Putah River to create a reservoir in the valley, which sits 
mostly in adjacent Napa County. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-foot-long, 304-foot-high Monticello Dam created a reservoir that 
supplies Solano County. 
</P>
<P>
Berryessa normally is three miles across at its widest point and 26 miles long, 
but is about one-third that size after losing 60% of its water. Last week, the 
lake surface fell to 377 feet above sea level -- nearly one dozen feet lower 
than during the drought of 1976-77 and 63 feet below normal. 
</P>
<P>
"If it doesn't rain, this lake could dry up in a few years, then you'll really 
get to see the whole town," said Jim Peterson, maintenance foreman for the 
reclamation bureau.

COPENHAGEN BATTLES BICYCLE THEFTS BY OFFERING 5,000 BIKES FOR FREE USE AROUND 
CITY 
</P>

<P>
Officials in the Danish capital believe they have found a way to stop bicycle 
thefts -- let people use them for free. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in May, 5,000 bicycles carrying advertising from sponsors will be 
placed in 900 bike racks throughout Copenhagen. 
</P>
<P>
They'll be available for use by anyone who needs them, tourists, shoppers, 
businessmen late for an appointment or commuters who have missed the bus. 
</P>
<P>
"You take a bike, drive around as long as you want it and put it back in a 
special-built rack. No charge," explained Ole Wessung, a 30-year-old 
chiropractor and an originator of the Bycykel (City Bike) project. 
</P>
<P>
"I had enough of getting my bicycles stolen. Five of them have disappeared 
within three months," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, 101,288 bicycles were reported stolen in 1989 in Denmark, 
a loss of $1.74 million. 
</P>
<P>
Wessung and publisher Morten Sadolin, 30, spent two years developing the 
project, and hope to make money by selling the advertising space on the 
bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
The Copenhagen City Council -- interested in reducing air pollution, traffic 
congestion and bike thefts -- has given permission for placement of the bicycle 
racks on almost every other street corner. 
</P>
<P>
A similar plan was proposed for Amsterdam in the 1970s but never caught on in 
the Dutch city. However, a similar free-bike plan is operating successfully at 
the Hoge Veluwe national park in the Netherlands. In the closed-off area, 
visitors can pick up a bike for free and drop it off anywhere else on the 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Eight companies have put up the first $1.7 million to get the Copenhagen 
project going. 
</P>
<P>
"They sign a three-year contract and during that period bicycles with their 
brands and colors will be seen in the streets," said Wessung. 
</P>
<P>
The clumsy-looking bicycles have big, flat central tubes where sponsors' 
advertisements will be placed. But the ungraceful appearance also has another 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"They are easily recognizable and were designed so no one would steal them," 
said Wessung. "Everyone can see it's a Bycykel. If you are spotted 200 
kilometers (125 miles) away from Copenhagen, you're either a good rider or a 
thief." 
</P>
<P>
Would-be thieves are discouraged from stealing the bike for refitting because 
standard saddles, wheels and other parts do not fit the Bycykel, which means 
"city bike" in Danish. 
</P>
<P>
Wessung said the bikes are easily maneuverable, but are not multispeed. 
</P>
<P>
They can be obtained in the way travelers get luggage carts at international 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
Users insert a coin worth $3.50 in a slot on the bike, and are then able to 
unlock it from the stand. A coin of the same value is returned when the bike is 
relocked into another rack. 
</P>
<P>
Wessung and Sadolin plan to test their Bycykel next year in Paris and Rome, 
where authorities are trying to discourage use of cars in the city centers. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope businessmen, tourists and everyone will borrow our bicycles to get 
around in Copenhagen. People are screaming about pollution and the Copenhagen 
municipality wants a car-free city," Wessung said.

DANA POINT'S DEVELOPMENT PLANS FEARED BY OLD-TIMERS;

CITY POLITICS: OFFICIALS HAVE TARGETED FOUR AREAS: THE CAPISTRANO BEACH 'BOWL,'

DANA POINT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A warm morning sun was shining into the living room of her apartment on 
downtown Del Prado Avenue, but Louise Cole was not feeling rosy. 
</P>
<P>
These were supposed to be the golden years for the 76-year-old widow, but her 
recent knee surgery and the thought that she may be uprooted from her home of 
22 years had her feeling cold and uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm terrified," Cole said. "I'm hearing that they may take my home and my 
livelihood away from me." 
</P>
<P>
Cole is one of a growing number of residents and business owners in this 
coastal city who fear the consequences of the city's ambitious plans for 
redeveloping the old downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
Although officials are uncertain how the face of the city will change, they 
have targeted four parts of town for possible redevelopment: the Capistrano 
Beach "bowl" area (a mixture of small homes and family-run businesses below 
Interstate 5 near Doheny State Park), the so-called couplet area (a reference 
to the split of Coast Highway into two one-way streets where Louise Cole 
lives), a crowded mix of apartments and homes called the Lantern District, and 
the bluffs area overlooking Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"There are all kinds of ideas floating around now," said City Councilman 
Michael Eggers. "Some people are talking about a pedestrian mall in the couplet 
area. Some have suggested taking the couplet out and redoing Coast Highway. 
What we're doing is putting all the ideas out on the table and taking a look at 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Longtime residents complain that it is the uncertainty that causes them fear, 
and they worry that redevelopment gives the city power over their lives, homes 
and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives three people, a city council majority, the power over all that we 
have established here for so many years," said a downtown business owner who 
asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
The feelings are the same in the Capistrano Beach bowl. At Lucy's El Patio Cafe 
on Doheny Park Road, owner Jack Saunderson is plain mad. 
</P>
<P>
He does not like the idea that his family's 40-year-old business may be forced 
to move. 
</P>
<P>
"My place, it's home to me and my family," said Saunderson, 34, whose mother, 
Lucy, opened the restaurant in 1951 and still works there at age 75. "And now 
the city has the power to tell us we have to leave? We were here when all this 
was orange groves, way before the freeway went through." 
</P>
<P>
City officials readily admit that there are changes in store for certain parts 
of the six-square-mile town. Although Dana Point is a historic community that 
dates to the 1880s, it is a young city, incorporated in January, 1989. It is in 
the process of writing its first general plan, often called the blueprint of a 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, the city has established the City Council as directors of a 
35-year, $241.5-million community redevelopment agency that gives them the 
power to enforce that general plan. 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment, officials say, is necessary if the city is to grow and thrive. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager William O. Talley said all the redevelopment agency will do is 
help finance what the general plan dictates. That plan is being concocted with 
the help of city residents through a series of community meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"The general plan will reflect what the people want and that will direct the 
redevelopment effort," Talley said. "The community has to demand what we do; 
this is not something the city is doing on its own." 
</P>
<P>
Some people in town are not sure the process has been that simple or 
democratic. Many, such as Cole and Saunderson, contend they were never told of 
any community meetings where they could voice their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't even heard about any meetings until one of my neighbors told me my 
restaurant was in the middle of a redevelopment area and I may be out of here," 
Saunderson said. "I took a survey that day of my customers and no one had 
received any letters from the city informing them of any meetings." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Karen Lloreda, who lives in Capistrano Beach, says she has 
urged her neighbors to take part in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"It is still early and nothing has been finalized yet," said Lloreda, a 
first-year councilwoman who was elected through the support of many of the 
Capistrano Beach residents and business owners. "But people here need to get 
involved. There will be some changes made." 
</P>
<P>
At Serra Lumber in Capistrano Beach, adjacent to the railroad tracks, manager 
Russ Primrose does not like to hear talk of change. His business relies on a 
railroad spur that juts off the main line into his yard for deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
"Our business depends on the railroad, as do other businesses in the area," 
Primrose said. "That's where we get 90% of our lumber. There's nowhere else 
between Fullerton and Oceanside that we could relocate." 
</P>
<P>
Talley admits that some people in these areas could be uprooted if their homes 
or businesses do not conform to the new land uses established in the general 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things this city has to face is what is best for the long term, for 
the next 20 or 30 years," he said. "But this is based on reason and logic. We 
don't pick on people; that would be crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Cole, who owns a one-block section of Del Prado that her late husband bought 
for her retirement, may be one of those forced out. Her spotless apartment, 
which is part of a building she owns, sits in a downtown area that is being 
eyed as a commercial center. 
</P>
<P>
"The thought of moving scares me to death," she said. "I moved here because 
this is where (she and her late husband) wanted to live out our years. I don't 
think this is fair."

SMITHCLIFFS PROJECT ILL CONCEIVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' coverage of Gary Brinderson's controversial plan to build 26 luxury 
homes on North Laguna's Smithcliffs property has focused on the environmental 
damage to a prime monarch butterfly habitat. But this ill-conceived project 
will create a host of serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
Brinderson avoided the tough planning and environmental review process required 
by Laguna Beach. Instead, he insisted that the project be reviewed only by the 
county, using weaker standards that are understandably preferred by developers. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Brinderson's strategy paid off when a majority of county planning 
commissioners approved his project. The commission majority agreed with 
Brinderson on every key point, ignoring these problems: 
</P>
<P>
* There is no meaningful public coastal access, as required by law. The plan 
calls for a locked, gated, guarded compound. 
</P>
<P>
* Trees will be removed during massive grading operations, including a grove of 
pines that harbor thousands of monarch butterflies during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
* Potentially dangerous traffic will be created on Coast Highway, where 
injuries and congestion are already notorious. 
</P>
<P>
* A narrow public access strip, new street and parking bays are located against 
the shallow back yards of residents. 
</P>
<P>
Brinderson's Smithcliffs development is poorly conceived, has arrogantly 
bypassed the review process by Laguna Beach, and is an insult to all county 
residents who deserve better planning, environmental protection and access to 
our public beaches.

OVERCROWDING IN COUNTY JAILS IS NOT AN EASILY RESOLVED ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the last few days, I have read with interest your articles on inmate 
overcrowding within the Orange County jail system. 
</P>
<P>
The reporting correctly describes the dire need for additional jail facilities 
to house the ever-increasing number of inmates. 
</P>
<P>
I agree the need is real and expanded facilities must be built. However, what 
is very disturbing to me is that your reporting serves to incite rather than 
help resolve a critical urban problem in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone has to assume a responsibility based on facts and knowledge of the 
problem and that includes the County Board of Supervisors, the media and the 
residents of Orange County. We need the media's participation to give the 
public the full and accurate scope of information on this issue. This is not 
being done. 
</P>
<P>
I take exception to the implied criticisms of the Board of Supervisors and, 
contrary to the tone of the articles, this board does recognize the need for 
additional jail beds and has worked aggressively to acquire them. 
</P>
<P>
I believe your newspaper and its readers realize, however, that one cannot 
simply say, "There's a big canyon; let's build a new jail in it." The issues 
that surround acquisition, construction and operation are complex, and often 
years of court challenges and public opposition must be overcome before a new 
jail becomes a reality. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest problems faced by the Board of Supervisors (and all state, 
federal and local governments responsible for correctional facilities) is NIMBY 
(the "Not In My Back Yard") syndrome. It seems that everybody in Orange County 
recognizes the need but will support only jail facilities that are built far 
away from where they may live or work. That's a pretty tall order for an urban 
county. 
</P>
<P>
By a majority vote, this board has designated a remote jail site at Gypsum 
Canyon and has had preliminary facility designs already completed. However, as 
soon as the environmental impact report was certified, its adequacy was 
immediately challenged in court by local jurisdictions who wanted a jail 
anywhere except their "back yard." 
</P>
<P>
Other obstacles exist that add to the difficulties inherent in building new 
jails. In Orange County, the enormous cost involved in first constructing and 
then operating a new facility creates a grave financial burden that this board 
is working diligently to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
General obligation bonds can be issued (with voter approval) to finance the 
acquisition and construction of jail facilities, but they cannot be used for 
personnel and operating costs. With an estimated price tag of more than $100 
million annually, ongoing operational costs will result in a significant 
negative impact to the county's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that your articles will work in a way that you had not expected -- that 
is, to provide the beginning of a public consensus to get a new, larger jail 
facility built and operating as quickly as possible. This can happen only if 
the public is willing to put aside NIMBY and work toward a common goal.

ANOTHER SIDE TO SCHOOL STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing about your article on Oak Ridge Private School ("Noisy New 
Neighbor Shows Up on Block," Nov. 21). More exactly, I am writing about the 
duty inherent in the exercise of privilege. 
</P>
<P>
I would have hoped that the reporters, as professional journalists, would have 
taken the time to investigate the entire story rather than only one side. The 
obvious slant with which this story was written leads me to believe that the 
reporters were either sloppy in their research attempts or that they 
intentionally misrepresented facts. Neither makes sense. Neither is acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
The guarantee of freedom of speech and expression is a treasure that we all 
enjoy, and few invoke its guarantees more vociferously than the press. But at 
what cost do you, as professionals, eschew the spirit of the law for the 
letter? 
</P>
<P>
No one cares more about safety precautions being met at the school than do the 
parents of the children. Never was there any questioning of the need for fire 
doors, as the article insinuated. Oak Ridge has been held to, and has met, 
safety standards that are higher than those for public schools in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The Constitution's guarantee of freedom of speech is something that my child, 
as a student at Oak Ridge Private School, will learn about. He will also learn 
about fairness and truth and that, inherent in any privilege, is the 
responsibility to exercise these freedoms with integrity and honor.

ANOTHER SIDE TO SCHOOL STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm an eighth-grade student at Oak Ridge Private School. I thought the story 
you wrote about the school and its neighbors was unfair and inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, what's this about the shrill of whistles at 7:45 a.m. calling 
children to class? No class starts before 8:30. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, you said yourself that the whistles aren't used anymore, so why bring 
it up at all? 
</P>
<P>
Another thing is the residential block situation. The neighbors block may be 
residential, but the school faces Grand Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
How could there be "constant" noise from the playground? The kids have to be in 
class sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
The alley behind the school is public. It's probably busy for a while in the 
morning and in the afternoon when kids are being dropped off and picked up, but 
that isn't all day. 
</P>
<P>
Weren't City Council meetings held before the school moved in to discuss Oak 
Ridge's role in the community? 
</P>
<P>
Why didn't you print how much (resident Frances) Anderson paid for her house 
and how much she wants to sell it for as long as you saw fit to print how much 
the Burrys paid for the Toastmaster's building? And what does the cost of 
tuition have to do with anything? 
</P>
<P>
I'd just like to add that the Burrys are considerate, caring people, and I 
think your story neglected the school's position.

HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS DISPLAY THEIR ANTI-GULF WAR SENTIMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read the article on high school students protesting our nation's efforts in 
the Middle East with great disappointment ("High Schoolers Demonstrate Anti-War 
Sentiments," Nov. 22). 
</P>
<P>
As a retired secondary school teacher, I can remember the pride expressed by my 
history students for their country's stands for justice and democracy. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that this present generation no longer possesses this quality. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, no sane, reasonably adjusted person is in favor of war, but there 
are worse things. 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't the quality of life count for anything anymore? Or is it simply the 
quantity that matters, regardless of its meaning or quality? 
</P>
<P>
These students should be exposed to historically proven long-term results of 
appeasing and rewarding military dictators. The consequences are far worse, in 
terms of human degradation and loss of life, than following our President's 
present course could ever be. 
</P>
<P>
This is true, even if this course results in a short-term war, if this war 
destroys Saddam's ability to be an even greater threat to the whole world in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
Have their teachers failed them? Or is this simply an indication of a whole 
generation that no longer sees quality, pride, reputation, justice and 
meaningful existence as important?

COUNTY ISN'T COPING WITH DIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County is not doing a good job of handling diversity in its 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is the coverage given to minorities often slants toward bad 
elements. The positive contributions that minorities like the De Silvas 
("Vandals Leave Signs of Race Hatred," Nov. 20) bring are overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard for warped, bigoted minds to grasp the idea that the minority come 
in all glorious colors. They are the law-abiding, true Americans. The superior 
attitudes often rampant in the county brings the criminal element crawling out 
like vermin.

NEW ALLIANCES CAN HELP SAVE CALIFORNIA'S GREAT NATURAL ASSETS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE IRVINE CO. AND THE NATURE CONSERVANCY 
MAY SEEM STRANGE BUT IT OFFERS HOPE OF PRESERVING THE FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SALLY W. SMITH, Sally W. Smith is director of communications for the 
California Nature Conservancy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the California Nature Conservancy and the Irvine Co. recently announced a 
new partnership, reaction from the community was quite favorable, but at the 
same time a few eyebrows were raised. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists working with a large-scale community developer? The 
combination strikes some as incongruous, even contradictory. 
</P>
<P>
But while many conservationists and developers have historically found 
themselves at odds with one another, this new partnership has more to do with 
the future than with the past. The future requires that we discard old 
assumptions and discover new approaches if we are to be successful in our work, 
be it community planning, land management or environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
You've heard the song before, but it bears repeating: We are losing our natural 
world at an alarming rate. The disappearing tropical rain forests of the Amazon 
or Malay peninsula are much discussed, but California, too, is in crisis: 98% 
of our state's river forests are gone; 99% of our native grasslands and our 
valley oak woodlands have been wiped out; 95% of our wetlands have disappeared, 
and with them the plants and animals that have contributed inestimably to 
California's reputation as the Golden State, a treasure trove of life and 
abundance. 
</P>
<P>
If humans were forced to live in 2% of their normal habitat, we'd all be living 
in closets. It doesn't take imagination to understand that this loss of nature 
cannot be sustained without immeasurable harm to our economic life and personal 
sense of well-being. 
</P>
<P>
While it is readily agreed that change is a fundamental rule of nature, and 
that extinction is part of that process, it is also true that the current rate 
of extinction is anywhere from 40 to 400 times the rate of species extinction 
during the time of the dinosaurs. The hands of the evolutionary clock are 
spinning wildly primarily because of human activity. More of our native plants 
and animals have become endangered in the last 200 years than in the last 10 
millennia. 
</P>
<P>
As the problems we face become more complex, the solutions fewer and less 
obvious, we need to involve alliances, teamwork and imaginative effort to 
effect the changes so desperately needed for the health of our state's 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
The Nature Conservancy has been doing just that. For 40 years, we've been 
protecting habitat for endangered wildlife and natural communities, and we've 
employed innovative strategies to do it. In the Coachella Valley, for example, 
the California Nature Conservancy worked with developers and environmentalists 
to pioneer a mitigation/habitat protection plan that is now being used as a 
national model to allow human and wildlife habitats to coexist. This 
willingness to explore new approaches has resulted in remarkable success: to 
date we have helped to protect more than 15 million acres globally, 5 million 
nationally, and over half a million of the most ecologically sensitive acres 
here in California. 
</P>
<P>
We also know that saving pieces of fragmented habitat is not enough. Large 
animals such as deer and pronghorn antelope need rangeland. Highways bisecting 
wildlife corridors result in animal isolation, injury and death. Preserving a 
particular parcel does not necessarily guarantee sufficient water to maintain 
healthy animal populations; or that the water that is available will be free of 
pesticides, siltation or fertilizer runoff. 
</P>
<P>
So increasingly, saving land for plants and animals requires thinking big, and 
taking a look at the larger picture. And thinking big, taking action on so 
large a scale, requires collaboration of many key players. 
</P>
<P>
The Nature Conservancy's approach has always been one of negotiation and 
cooperation, and as a result we've had the opportunity to work with an 
extraordinarily diverse group of people and organizations. Nationwide, we have 
cooperative agreements with the Bureau of Land Management and the Department of 
Defense, and in California, the U.S. Forest Service. These three partners 
control a whopping 42% of the land in our state, and almost 60% of the 
biodiversity. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in recent memory, a new California governor will have had 
significant experience with these federal agencies and so has the opportunity 
to forge unprecedented federal-state partnerships in favor of wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California has one of the richest and most varied array of species in 
the continental United States. With 64,000 acres in Orange County, the Irvine 
Co. is uniquely positioned to protect that natural heritage, and our 
partnership represents a commitment to do it wisely. When they approached us 
earlier this year to ask if we would consider developing a natural 
resource/public access management plan for their lands slated for eventual 
public ownership, the California Nature Conservancy understood the opportunity 
the Irvine Co. was presenting to us. The parcels of their land we inventoried 
are large, contiguous tracts of prime wildlife habitat, an increasingly rare 
commodity in burgeoning Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Irvine Co. was offering evidence of something the Nature 
Conservancy has been saying for a long time: What's good for the environment is 
ultimately good for business communities and society. Development of 
sustainable land-use policies and protection of wildlife benefit everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligent planning of communities involves not only the creation of 
sensitively designed buildings, but also protection for those special places we 
turn to for beauty, peace and a sense of balance. California can no longer 
afford the polarization of "either/or." If we work together we can have "all of 
the above." At the Nature Conservancy, we think this is not only possible but 
absolutely essential. Happily, the Irvine Co. agrees.

PLANNING FOR UNIVERSITY HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to a Nov. 11 editorial concerning UC Irvine's plans for a 
University House ("UCI Mustn't Forget the Animals' Homes"), I would like to 
emphasize the level of detail that went into the planning for this project and 
outline the approval process involved. 
</P>
<P>
Consulting biologists worked in cooperation with university faculty and staff 
to study and map the site in great detail. 
</P>
<P>
This information was used to develop a site plan which avoids a majority of the 
sensitive habitat and incorporates detailed mitigation measures for restoring 
and monitoring the few areas that would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
After review by a faculty and staff planning committee, the plans will be 
submitted to the University of California Regents for approval. The regents 
will consider the project based on our studies and on the environmental impact 
report prepared for the campus' Long-Range Development Plan. This report, which 
includes a comprehensive study of all biological habitat on campus, adequately 
describes the impact of this project. 
</P>
<P>
We at UCI, the only University of California campus without a University House 
on campus, are committed to protecting the environment. We are also satisfied 
the project will have minimal impact on the area. Preparing yet another 
environmental report would be redundant and would not provide any new 
information.

A DAY IN THE LIFE OF LAWRENCE TAYLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WILLIS, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawrence Taylor might be having an off-year when it comes to sacks, but as the 
major personality of the New York Giants, the nine-time Pro Bowl linebacker has 
never been more popular. Tuesday is the players' usual day off, but like most 
of the Giants, Taylor spends it making personal appearances. He is easily the 
most requested, the most expensive and perhaps the most adored Giant. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor allowed Newsday to spend Nov. 20 with him to get a feel for a day in the 
life of Lawrence Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Noon -- Taylor arrives by limousine for the Executive Sports Network luncheon 
in Livingston, N.J., hosted by Giants' linebacker Gary Reasons. One of the 
organizers calls it a "schmoozefest" with about 150 area business executives, 
who paid high dollars to rub elbows with the Giants. Reasons usually hires 
about four Giants to attend the luncheon, which is preceded by a cocktail hour. 
The players are paid according to their popularity. Some make about $500; 
Taylor's price tag is about $5,000. Also on hand this day are Steve DeOssie, 
Stephen Baker, Mark Ingram and Rodney Hampton. 
</P>
<P>
All the executives gravitate to Taylor during the cocktail hour. Dressed in 
brown sport coat, black shirt and black pants, he smiles for pictures and makes 
small talk, masking what had been a frustrating morning. He had spent most of 
the morning meeting with accountants about a tax problem. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't put him in the proper mood to deal with 150 execs looking to 
schmooze. "I'm pretty good at faking it," Taylor says later. "I've been doing 
it for 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
2 p.m. -- It's time for autographs, the first of about 1,000 he'll sign today. 
Taylor and the other Giants sit at a table, each with a stack of his pictures 
in front of him. The execs line up in single file in front of the players. 
Taylor's line is the longest. He tries to be cordial while signing but knows 
former Giants' defensive end George Martin is waiting outside to drive him to 
his next appearance. After 20 minutes, Taylor is restless and ready to leave, 
but his line isn't getting any shorter. After asking Reasons three different 
times to cut off the line, Taylor gets up from the table, takes two quick 
pictures and leaves. 
</P>
<P>
2:45 p.m. -- Martin is waiting outside, ready to drive Taylor to Connecticut. 
"Where's the limo?" Taylor asks. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going in this," Martin says, pointing to a four-door Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was Taylor's big brother for eight seasons before retiring in 1988. 
Martin was the person Taylor went to in times of trouble. While he was paid 
handsomely for the Reasons function, Taylor is doing a "freebie" for Martin, 
who has helped found an organization called Minority Athletes Network, Inc. 
Their major fundraiser is tonight. Taylor thinks the site is about 90 minutes 
away. The drive lasts 2 1/2 hours. Taylor gives Martin no peace the entire 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
3:30 p.m. -- It's obvious Taylor is uncomfortable riding in the back of the 
small Mercedes . He continues to pester Martin about driving too slow. "Look at 
all that shoulder you have on the right," he tells Martin, who is slowed by 
traffic. "Let me drive." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is Taylor doesn't have a driver's license. Last August, a judge 
took it away from him for 20 days for speeding. He was clocked at 101 mph. 
Taylor hasn't bothered to get the license back. He's still angry that the court 
clerk asked him to sign several dozen pictures just before his hearing. 
Thinking the judge was going to let him off, Taylor obliged. Then the judge 
scolded him and decided not to let him go without penalty just because he was a 
football player. "I just threw the license at him and left," Taylor says. 
</P>
<P>
5:15 p.m. -- Martin heads for the New London shopping mall. As he pulls into 
the back lot, about 50 people recognize Taylor and follow the brown Mercedes. 
They thrust pads, T-shirts and books at him as he climbs out of the car. 
"You'll have to wait until we go inside," he says, then looks to Martin for 
support. 
</P>
<P>
As he enters the back of a sporting goods shop in the mall, Taylor is told 
about 6,000 people have been waiting most of the day just to get his autograph. 
Former Giants Harry Carson, Ron Johnson, Terry Jackson, Beasley Reece and 
Robbie Jones have been signing autographs since 3 p.m. But the crowd has waited 
for Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Before sending the star attraction out in the crowd, the store manager tells an 
employee to call for more security. "I think we're going to have some 
problems," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The autograph station is in front of the sporting goods store in the mall, but 
the crush for Taylor's signature becomes so thick, he thinks of a better plan. 
He decides to have a card table slid along the line so he can go to the 
autograph seekers instead of them coming to him. It's a good solution. The 
crowd, about 1,000 at this point, is controlled but excited. Flash bulbs pop 
everywhere; many scream "LT, LT" to attract his attention. 
</P>
<P>
"When he first came in the league, he was just another player," Carson says 
while watching the scene. "Now people look up to him and idolize him. It never 
really surprises me, the response he gets." 
</P>
<P>
6 p.m -- The crowd tries to form some semblance of a single file while waiting 
for Taylor's signature. At the front of the line, he is working like a machine. 
At Reasons' luncheon, he signed his full name on his picture. Here he signs "L 
Taylor 56." 
</P>
<P>
For the next 45 minutes, Taylor hardly looks up, except to smile for a quick 
picture. "I want to get as many people in as possible," he says later. "When I 
throw the pen down I don't want to pick it up again." 
</P>
<P>
In rapid succession, he signs cups, chairs, pennants, bumper stickers, 
T-shirts, caps, posters, footballs, football cards, his book "LT: Living on the 
Edge" and money, anything from $1 to $10 bills. 
</P>
<P>
One woman sneaks up behind him but doesn't want an autograph. "I just want to 
touch him," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Somebody lays down a Chicago Bears' poster. It's one of the few times Taylor 
stops his perpetual motion. He looks at the poster, turns it over and signs the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
6:55 p.m. -- After signing about 800 autographs at the mall and doing three 
television interviews, Taylor slides into a white limo with Martin and two 
Giant fans in their middle 20s. They were winners of a radio contest that 
allowed them to ride with Taylor to a dinner at the Shennecossett Golf Course 
in nearby Groton, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Mike, one of the radio winners, tells Taylor he thinks the Giants will win the 
Super Bowl this year because his wife went into labor during Super Bowl XXI and 
she's pregnant again this year and due in February. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor questions whether the guy is a football fan at all. "You probably like 
hockey," he challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Mike tells the driver to turn on the light and rolls up his right sleeve. On 
his shoulder is a tattoo of a football helmet with "Giants" inscribed across it 
and "No. 56" at the bottom. Taylor laughs. 
</P>
<P>
7:20 p.m. -- After signing autographs for the radio winners and the chauffeur, 
Taylor arrives at the golf course. About 200 blue-collar Giant fans have paid 
$100 to drink at an open bar and get autographs from former Giants Martin, 
Jackson, Carson, Jones and Johnson. Taylor and defensive end Leonard Marshall 
are the only current players attending. Marshall, who arrives at about 7:40, is 
also making the appearance for free as a favor to Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor is shuttled into the back pro shop, where food awaits the special 
guests. Before eating his chicken parmigiana, he sees a rack of putters and 
begins to test two or three of them. Finally, he sits down to eat across from 
Jones. There is some history here: It was Jones who said during the 1987 
players strike: "You follow LT and you'll burn in hell" when Taylor threatened 
to cross the picket line. Today, all seems to be forgotten as Taylor and Jones 
make small talk. 
</P>
<P>
7:55 p.m. -- Taylor and Marshall enter the drunken crowd to sign autographs. 
While the former Giants mingle, Taylor and Marshall stand in relative safety 
behind a bar and sign whatever is thrust in front of them. Signing autographs 
is something Taylor does with mixed emotions. He doesn't hate doing it. He just 
hates attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them don't even ask for an autograph," he says. "They just say, 'Sign 
this.' Then they get upset if you misspell their names. I'll do some of this 
stuff, but somebody better have some manners." 
</P>
<P>
Later he says, "Sometimes you meet the nicest people and you can also meet the 
biggest (jerks). It's really a no-win situation. The people you sign autographs 
for are going to love you. The ones who don't get an autograph are going to 
call you a (jerk)." 
</P>
<P>
8:50 p.m. -- Marshall auctions off an autographed helmet and his No. 70 jersey, 
with proceeds going to MAN, Inc. He gets $500 for the helmet and $275 for the 
jersey. Taylor yells: "No checks." 
</P>
<P>
8:55 p.m. -- Taylor holds up a helmet he'll autograph for whoever wins the 
bidding. Minutes before, Taylor seems to be on his last legs, weary from the 
day's events and knowing a tough week of practice lies ahead in preparation for 
the Philadelphia Eagles. But as he orchestrates the auction there is a renewed 
energy, like Muhammad Ali in front of a television camera. He starts the 
bidding at $400 and coaxes the pri ce upward. The helmet finally sells for 
$1,200. Taylor head-butts the winner. Then he auctions an autographed No. 56 
jersey. The winning bid: $1,100. 
</P>
<P>
9:15 -- It's time to go home. Taylor and Marshall climb in a blue limousine for 
the ride back to New Jersey. Both players vow not to do this again for free, 
friendship or no friendship. "I don't like it when people start taking 
advantage of me," Taylor says. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to two traffic backups from construction, the ride home takes three 
hours. During the trip Taylor talks about: 
</P>
<P>
 -- His past drug use and his precarious situation of being one positive drug 
test from being banned from the league for one season: "I can't understand why 
(Dexter) Manley let that happen to him (last year)," Taylor says. "I've always 
been the type of guy who had to have the pressure on him. Now the pressure (to 
stay clean) is on." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The NFL Players Association: "What did the strike do for us? Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Giants' 10-0 start: "It's like a roller-coaster. You just don't know 
where it's going to let you off." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coach Bill Parcells: "I'd say he's one of the top three coaches in the 
league to play for. You just have to understand him. All he wants to do is 
win." 
</P>
<P>
12:10 a.m. -- Taylor's car is at Giants Stadium, but he tells the chauffeur to 
drop him off at his Upper Saddle River, N.J., home. After the limo pulls into 
the driveway, Taylor climbs out and tips the driver with a $100 bill. He has to 
report for practice at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"You wake up Wednesday and say, 'Where did my day off go?' Now you're looking 
at another week of work." 
</P>
<P>
Then he shrugs: "I guess that's the price of fame."

BLAZERS LURING MANIACS ALL OVER LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Portland, where cabbies ask, "Where to?" and then, "Have they ever heard of 
the Trail Blazers in (fill in name of your city)?" the Blazermaniacs have a 
real juggernaut on their hands. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers won their first 11 games and are 12-1. 
</P>
<P>
They went four games without ever being behind. 
</P>
<P>
They hit San Antonio with a 49-18 first quarter, making 22 of 25 shots, 
including five three-pointers. Former Utah Jazz coach Frank Layden and stunned 
Spur Coach Larry Brown both called it the best period of basketball they'd ever 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
Said Brown: "They could have beaten the all-decade team." 
</P>
<P>
The Blazers, 19th-best in field goal percentage last season, are running 1-2 
with the Boston Celtics now. Danny Ainge, depressed to a 44% mark in Sacramento 
last season, is winging away at 60% and on his three-pointers is shooting 56%. 
Cliff Robinson, 40% last season while being introduced to the concept of shot 
selection, is at 59%. 
</P>
<P>
"They're an amazing rebounding team," Brown said. "Other than at center, they 
probably have someone who's as good a rebounder at that position as anyone in 
the league." 
</P>
<P>
The Golden State Warriors' Don Nelson is more effusive, saying: "They're one of 
the best put-together teams ever. They did things the right way. I'm proud of 
them. They're the best team we've played. I really like what they've done." 
</P>
<P>
Are the Blazermaniacs happy, or what? 
</P>
<P>
Said a Portland assistant district attorney to a Los Angeles reporter who'd 
called to inquire about a criminal matter: 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to kick your butts this year." 
</P>
<P>
Mosquito in paradise: The Trail Blazers fined Drazen Petrovic $500 for saying 
he'd go home to Yugoslavia if he couldn't play in Portland. They rescinded it 
when he recanted. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, they wouldn't mind if he shipped out. 
</P>
<P>
Petrovic gets $1.3 million to be the twelfth man. If he left, they could 
suspend him and get half his salary back against their cap. 
</P>
<P>
After their loss to the Phoenix Suns, in which Clyde Drexler was ejected and 
Petrovic still couldn't play, mild-mannered Coach Rick Adelman snarled at a 
reporter who asked about it. 
</P>
<P>
Flirting with immortality: In Sacramento, where a rebuilding project begins 
annually, the latest one struggles. 
</P>
<P>
At their present 1-12 rate, the Kings would eclipse the 1972-3 76ers' 9-73 
record as the NBA's worst. The Kings are pointed toward 6-76. 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of this, Coach Dick Motta hyped their home date last week against 
Minnesota on the theory they had to beat someone. 
</P>
<P>
Said Motta: "I told the guys that in my two years here, this is the most 
important game we've played." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings fell, 89-80. Maybe it was too much pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Add Kings: Do you think it made them feel any better to see Pervis Ellison get 
17 points and 14 rebounds for the Washington Bullets last week against the 
Chicago Bulls? 
</P>
<P>
The Kings made the mistake of overrating Ellison -- thanks, Bill Russell -- and 
could prove to have compounded it by giving up on him precipitously. 
</P>
<P>
They got Bob Hansen, Eric Leckner and yet-to-play rookie Anthony Bonner for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
They're baaaack: Every season, everyone writes off Milwaukee. Every season, the 
Bucks jump off to a good start. Every season, no one can explain what's 
happening, other than noting that Del Harris must be a great coach. 
</P>
<P>
However, take a look at the Buck backcourt: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jay Humphries is averaging 15 points a game, shooting 49%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alvin Robertson is averaging 16 points and 5.2 steals, No. 1 in the NBA and 
more than two steals a game ahead of anyone else. He started the week one 
rebound behind team leader Jack Sikma and one assist behind team leader 
Humphries. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ricky Pierce is averaging a team-high 23.1 points as a substitute. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's Wes Unseld calls it "the best guard trio in the league."

NBA Notes

<P>
Versace on a hot tin roof: Indiana Pacers Coach Dick Versace is said to be in 
trouble, but it hasn't slowed his quick-draw delivery. Said Versace: "I love 
the edge. I like to win and I'm going to win. I always win. I'm like a cat you 
drop off the roof upside down and it lands on his feet. I always have and I 
always will." . . . Translation: he thinks Chuck Daly will give him his old 
assistant's job back with the Detroit Pistons. . . . Add Pacers: Rick Smits, 
supposedly primed for a big season after working with Bill Walton last summer, 
is shooting 40%. Versace said Smits is suffering from "cognitive overload."

The leader in the clubhouse in the "worst excuse to hide a player on the 
injured list" competition: Detroit says Mark Hughes has "minor curvature of the 
spine." . . . The Charlotte Hornets are 17-18 in their last 35 games, going 
back to last season. "They may not have a legitimate center," Miami Heat Coach 
Ron Rothstein said, "but not everyone has two power forwards (Armon Gilliam and 
J.R. Reid) like they have. Do they want everything in Year 3?" . . . Rothstein 
is splitting point-guard minutes between last season's find, Sherman Douglas, 
and rookie Bimbo Coles, whom Rothstein rates a better defender. Douglas, a 
soon-to-be restricted free agent, said he doesn't like it. . . . The New York 
Knicks are 2-5 at Madison Square Garden. Last season, they didn't lose their 
fifth game at home until March. 
</P>
<P>
Weekly Paul Westhead update: Attendance is dropping in Denver, ominous because 
his system was supposed to provide diverting entertainment. The Nuggets already 
have had three crowds among their seven lowest all-time. . . . Said Westhead: 
"Hey, I know we're on a tightrope. We can succeed and we can fail. I know 
exactly what leads to tension in the tightrope. In this system, you need the 
entire team to play full-blast every minute of every game." 
</P>
<P>
Weekly Charles Barkley update: The Philadelphia 76ers' forward apologized for 
joking about wife-beating. He was called to NBA headquarters to discuss his 
repeated exchanges with courtside customers around the league, who have learned 
just how candid Barkley can be. . . . Chicago rookie Scott Williams barely made 
the team but is taking minutes from Stacey (Moby) King, who's still heavy and 
having almost as many shots blocked as he makes. . . . Piston Dennis Rodman's 
line of the month: 29 minutes, 13 rebounds, no shots taken from the floor or 
foul line. . . . Good news for you Bad Boys fans: Detroit's 13-2 start is best 
in team history. . . . Red Auerbach, who knows skullduggery when he sees it, on 
all those Atlanta Hawks players slipping on the wet Boston Garden floor in the 
game called with the Celtics ahead, 37-22: "When you're 15 down, it's very easy 
to slip." . . . Denver rookie Terry Mills has an incentive clause for weighing 
240 pounds. Early line: he'll never see a penny of it.

RUN-AND-SHOOT FINDS A PLACE IN THE NFL 
</P>

<P>
Mouse Davis, the short but potent guardian of the run-and-shoot offense, turned 
on his small-screen television Monday night to watch big-time critics rip his 
lifelong beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
On the screen, retired quarterback Ron Jaworski and former New York Giants 
coach Allie Sherman trashed Davis' run-and-shoot offense, saying that it had no 
place in the NFL. Davis, currently the quarterbacks and receivers coach with 
the Detroit Lions, rolled his eyes. He's heard the same complaints too many 
times since installing the run-and-shoot into the Portland State offense in 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
"They were saying that the quarterback gets hit too much," Davis said. "They 
were making such a big deal about it. So I watch Houston play the Buffalo 
Bills. Every time the Bills blitzed, Warren Moon completed a quick pass and 
didn't get touched. Every time the Oilers blitzed, Jim Kelly went down. I 
wondered what they'll dig up next." 
</P>
<P>
Houston's 27-24 victory over the Bills Monday night marked another graduation 
of the unconventional offense the NFL refuses to accept. Moon passed for 300 
yards, his eighth 300-yard game of the season. Halfback Lorenzo White rushed 
for 125 yards. 
</P>
<P>
From high school to the Canadian Football League to upstart pro leagues to NFL 
prime time, the run-and-shoot refuses to die. Davis feels like Dr. Frankenstein 
telling the scientists that his monster is alive. It is alive, but the 
scientists demand more proof. 
</P>
<P>
"They won't want to look at the facts," Davis said. "They just want to bitch 
about something." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday at 1 p.m. in the Kingdome and on Dec. 30 when the Lions pay a visit, the 
Seahawks will watch more of the run-and-shoot than they would care to see. To 
them, the run-and-shoot is scary. They believed in the concept enough to 
install it in their playbook. Now, their task is to try to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's stopped the Oilers yet," Seahawks defensive coordinator Tom Catlin 
said. "I guess our goal is to make them punt one time and not let them get into 
the end zone. Against the Bills, they didn't even have to punt." 
</P>
<P>
Oilers coach Jack Pardee doesn't sugarcoat the run-and-shoot. He doesn't call 
it the spread or the stretch or the red gun. To Pardee, it's the run-and-shoot. 
It's worked for him in the United States Football League, at the University of 
Houston and now with the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been doing this for eight or nine years," Pardee said. "There's a lot of 
criticism going around. It's a good system. As a coach, you find players with 
enough ability to win with it. As a coach I wanted to move the football, but 
I've never been in the situation where I thought we could line up and dominate 
a team." 
</P>
<P>
So when he coached the USFL's Houston Gamblers, he hired Davis to teach his 
team the run-and-shoot. For Davis, it gave him the forum to show pro fans that 
the four-receiver, wide-open format worked on levels higher than high school or 
college or the CFL. 
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, Davis has heard all the complaints and the myths. The 
so-called geniuses first said the concept wasn't sound. Later, they doubted it 
would work. Eventually, a few saw things in the offense that were appealing. 
Now, the majority fear it. 
</P>
<P>
With Moon directing the Oilers' run-and-shoot, the NFL record book will look as 
though it has been riddled by a machine gun. By season's end, Moon should break 
all of Dan Marino's season records for completions, attempts and yardage and 
throw for more 300-yard games than anyone ever imagined. 
</P>
<P>
His four receivers -- dubbed the Fab Four -- already rank among the top nine in 
the AFC and should collect more than 300 passes as a quartet, another NFL 
record. More importantly to Davis and Pardee, the concept is winning games and 
supporters within the NFL establishment. 
</P>
<P>
Each week, the run-and-shoot breaks records and myths. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people who don't want it to work," said Oilers offensive 
coordinator Kevin Gilbride, who's also grown tired of the criticisms. "They 
keep saying the system doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
Folks, it works, and the Oilers are embarrassing defenses and dispelling those 
myths. 
</P>
<P>
Each Sunday, Moon steps to the line of scrimmage feeling like a young lad in a 
candy store carrying a blank check. 
</P>
<P>
"Teams have played so many looks against us, it actually takes a little while 
before you see everything a team wants to do against you," Moon said. It takes 
you a couple series going into each game to see exactly want kind of package a 
team wants to play against you. You pretty much have to adjust on the run." 
</P>
<P>
As Moon adjust his sights, the NFL adjusts its stereotypical criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
Myth 1: The run-and-shoot won't work in NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Pro Football Weekly rates the efficiency of NFL offenses. The Oilers are first. 
The Lions are second. 
</P>
<P>
Look at the Oilers' numbers as an example. They are averaging 379.5 yards and 
23.2 points a game. They've converted 52.5 percent of their third downs. Each 
offensive play averages a 6.1 yards. That's 1.3 yards per play better than the 
Seahawks. The Oilers are also averaging four plays a game more than the 
Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
Myth 2: Because run-and-shoot teams have no tight ends on their rosters, the 
offenses stall once they cross opponents' 20-yard lines. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, despite having inferior quarterbacks and receivers, are converting 
64 percent of their opportunities inside the 20 into touchdowns, one of the 
best ratios in the NFL. That deflates the argument used against the Oilers, who 
have converted only 47.5 percent of their scoring chances into touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had chances to score, but we've had dropped passes and fumbles," 
Gilbride said. "It's not a matter of the scheme being the problem. It's 
execution. The No.1 problem has been the drops. We had two touchdowns dropped 
in a game against the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers dropped 15 passes in an early-season game against the Pittsburgh 
Steelers. At the time, the Oilers were still learning new routes and Moon was 
adjusting to new reads. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any defense stopping us," wide receiver Ernest Givins said. "At 
first, we were wondering if we were in the right area, and wondering if we were 
using the right techniques. Now we are starting to get great continuity and we 
are not seeing that many drops." 
</P>
<P>
Myth 3: There is no run in the run-and-shoot. 
</P>
<P>
Lions halfback Barry Sanders led all NFC rushers with 1,470 yards in 1989, 10 
yards behind Christian Okoye of the Kansas City Chiefs. He leads the NFC with 
844 yards in 1990. When the Bills concentrated their defense on Houston's Fab 
Four, White burned them on draw plays. 
</P>
<P>
Myth 4: The Seahawks junked the run-and-shoot after one half of the Chicago 
Bears game because they didn't think it would work. 
</P>
<P>
Not true. The Seahawks found that they weren't skilled enough or proficient 
enough to use it regularly. Now, they sprinkle in the run-and-shoot as a 
change-up. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always thought it's got a chance," Seahawks offensive coordinator John 
Becker said. "There's some guys who think it's a passing fad and all that. It 
didn't look like a passing fad to me the other night against the Bills. They 
lit it up against a real good football team. 
</P>
<P>
"You spread people out and then you've got the skilled people that they have, 
I'll tell you what, you create some real problems. We've used it really, really 
sparingly. Nobody ever promised how much we were going to us it. I don't think 
it was given what you would consider an awesome look." 
</P>
<P>
With the Oilers, who use it all the time, it looks awesome.

'SHERIFF' AND HIS BRETHREN ARE ON GUARD

By ANDREW BEYER, WASHINGTON POST; (Washington Post racing columnist Andrew 
Beyer has gone off to Australia for three months to sample the sport Down 
Under. 
</P>

SYDNEY, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When an odds-on favorite named Historically lost a race here, horseplayers did 
what their counterparts anywhere in the world would have done: They cursed his 
jockey. 
</P>
<P>
One week earlier, jockey Ron Durden had won a steeplechase aboard Historically 
by leading all the way. Now, in a similar spot in which the horse looked 
unbeatable, Durden put him under wraps and permitted a rival, Snow Gypsy, to 
open a 15-length lead. Historically never had a chance of catching him. 
</P>
<P>
Almost anywhere else in the world, bettors would have harbored dark suspicions 
about that race that would never be resolved. In the United States, stewards 
rarely probe even the most flagrant form reversals, and never question 
run-of-the-mill bad rides that cost a horse a victory. In Australia, however, 
the system works differently. 
</P>
<P>
Moments after Durden dismounted, he was summoned to the stewards' room, which 
is located just a few yards from the jockeys' quarters. Reporters followed him 
to the hearing room, for stewards' inquiries here are open to the press. Durden 
sat at a table facing six officials, but the eyes boring into him were those of 
chief steward John Schreck, a man dubbed by the press as "Sheriff Schreck" for 
his commitment to law and order on the track. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff peered over his spectacles. "We are concerned," he said gravely, 
"with the manner in which you rode your horse." Schreck proceeded to grill 
Durden about every aspect of his ride. He played films of the race, from 
various camera angles, in slow motion and stop-action, quizzing Durden point by 
point. Meanwhile, another official was leafing through computer printouts of 
the betting patterns on the race. 
</P>
<P>
When Schreck finished his interrogation, he decided the jockey had been at 
least partly excused because of trouble his horse had encountered early in the 
race, and his conclusions appeared in the regular "Stewards' Report" that was 
made public the next day: 
</P>
<P>
"When questioned, Durden explained ... that he endeavored to go forward, but 
was inconvenienced by a riderless horse. ... As he was trying to pull the whip 
through into his left hand, it became entangled in the reins and the horse's 
mane. ..." 
</P>
<P>
Losing bettors still might not have been happy, but at least they knew the race 
had been investigated and they had the satisfaction of an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
When I came to Australia to play the horses, I expected the game would include 
a fair amount of dishonesty, because there is so much money to be won here. 
Perpetrators of a slick coup could collect millions by betting with bookmakers 
around the country. So as I started to scrutinize the films of races for 
handicapping purposes, I looked hard for horses who were being restrained, or 
at least were being given lackadaisical rides, by their jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
I have considerable experience and expertise in this department after watching 
so many races in Maryland. But to my surprise, I have scarcely seen a single 
ride in a month's time that I could describe as questionable. The reason is 
that the Australians are almost fanatical in their determination to keep the 
game free from any taint, and their system works because of the way the 
stewards operate. 
</P>
<P>
At least six stewards watch a race, aided by a sophisticated set of nine 
cameras, and they consult immediately afterward to decide if they have any 
questions about any horse's or rider's performance. If so, Schreck said: "We 
take the view that it is better to strike when the iron is hot." 
</P>
<P>
Jockeys and trainers are summoned almost immediately for questioning, with the 
press in attendance. These queries may yield the information that a horse threw 
a shoe during a race or bumped his head on the starting gate or came back 
lame-and all of this will appear in the stewards' report. 
</P>
<P>
But the stewards are looking mostly at jockeys. Schreck said that he puts 
questionable rides into three categories. At one end of the spectrum are simple 
errors of judgment, which usually won't be penalized. At the other end are 
out-and-out cases of larceny and he said: "These days, not much of that goes 
on." But the tough middle ground falls where a jockey doesn't seem to do enough 
to win a race, when he makes "a combination of errors beyond a reasonable 
degree." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, one of Australia's leading jockeys, Jim Cassidy, was aboard a horse 
named Cruising and, Schreck recalled: "He came out of the gate slow. He didn't 
improve during the middle stages. He didn't ride the horse out satisfactorily 
in the straight." This sounded, in short, like the way certain jockeys at 
Laurel ride just about every day. They don't do it here. Cassidy was slapped 
with a one-year suspension. 
</P>
<P>
That's why the jockeys are whipping and driving in the stretch, even when their 
mounts are clearly beaten. "Our system," Schreck said, "has a deterrent 
effect." 
</P>
<P>
So even though bettors here, as everywhere, will denounce jockeys and will be 
slightly paranoid, Australian racing fans have a greater confidence in the 
basic integrity of the sport than their counterparts in most other nations. We 
suspicious souls from the United States would love to see some of our favorite 
jockeys placed on the same continent with Sheriff Shreck.

NOW SEEKS INQUIRY INTO POLICE INVESTIGATIONS;

<P>
CRIME: THE POLICE DEPARTMENT'S FAILURE RATE AND ALLEGED INSENSITIVITY TO 
VICTIMS ARE TARGETED.

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A women's advocacy group this week plans to request investigations of the 
Police Department's failure to solve a high percentage of rape cases and 
allegations that some officers are insensitive to rape victims. 
</P>
<P>
The local chapter of the National Organization for Women plans to ask the new 
Citizen Police Complaint Commission to determine whether the department is 
pursuing rape cases as aggressively as it should. Last year, police failed to 
make arrests in 74% of the cases of reported rapes. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-member commission, which will be receiving public requests for the first 
time when it meets Wednesday, was approved by Long Beach voters last April to 
review reports of police misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
NOW will also ask the commission to recommend ways to improve the department's 
"attitude and treatment of (rape) victims," said Gerrie Schipske, the group's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be an attitude in the department that this is not important 
enough," said Schipske, who accused police of being insensitive to the 
seriousness of the crime. "(There is) the sexist belief held by many police 
that somehow rape is a crime of sexual passion and that the women involved 
asked for it." 
</P>
<P>
Department officials would not comment on Schipske's statements but have said 
repeatedly that the an understaffed Police Department is the main factor in the 
department's poor track record in solving rape cases and other serious crimes. 
Officials at one point ordered mandatory weekend overtime to try to reduce the 
backlog of unsolved cases in the detective bureau, where some complaints have 
sat for months before anyone could get to them. 
</P>
<P>
Schipske, however, questioned whether the understaffing is a valid excuse. "It 
can't be that they're just busy doing other things," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Long Beach police had the worst record of any major city in 
California for solving serious and violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Police solved 65 of the 247 rapes reported in the city last year, a 74% failure 
rate surpassed only by the percentage of unsolved robberies, among serious 
crimes. Police failed to solve 87% of the robberies, 52% of the murders and 41% 
of the assaults. 
</P>
<P>
A study by the California Department of Justice found that Los Angeles police 
failed to solve 51% of the rapes reported to them in 1989, while San Diego 
police failed to solve 52%. Oakland police had a failure rate of 34%, Anaheim 
police 28% and Santa Ana police 19%. 
</P>
<P>
"Rape is a felony, but it has not gotten the attention of the department," 
Schipske said. "Rape is a crime that is committed against women and for it to 
be so neglected, we want it looked into." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Rape Hotline of Long Beach also are expected to ask the commission 
to investigate concerns that disparaging remarks by a few patrol officers have 
discouraged some rape victims from pursuing their complaints. Rape Hotline 
volunteers answer emergency calls and help victims through police interviews, 
doctor examinations and court hearings. 
</P>
<P>
In the past three months, hot line officials referred to the department two 
complaints of officers making offensive remarks to rape victims. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, a female officer called a young woman "a little whore" before 
realizing the woman had been raped, according to Julie Dodge, executive 
director of the Sexual Assault Crisis Agency, which runs the 24-hour hot line. 
In another case, a rape victim withdrew her complaint after becoming upset 
about a police officer's comments. Dodge declined to discuss specific details 
of the incident to ensure the victim's privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Police are investigating both incidents, Deputy Chief Robert Luman said. 
</P>
<P>
Luman insisted, however, that the department generally is doing an excellent 
job dealing with rape victims. 
</P>
<P>
"The hot line takes about 200 calls a month. That's two (complaints) for 600 
contacts, so it doesn't seem like an overwhelming problem. Obviously, we'd like 
it to be zero," Luman said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodge acknowledged that only a few patrol officers may be making insensitive 
remarks but argued that more training should be established. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to blow away some of the myths, such as somehow, the victim did 
something wrong," Dodge said. 
</P>
<P>
She also expressed concern that officers may not be responding as sensitively 
to a rape victim who appears calm after an attack. "She may look as if she's 
OK, but she's not. She's in shock," Dodge said. The rape victim who appears 
calm is not likely to receive as much support as the victim who is emotional, 
Dodge added. 
</P>
<P>
Hot line officials are working with sex-crime investigators to prepare a 
training program for all patrol officers, Dodge said. The program would be a 
refresher course for officers, who receive training in how to conduct sexual 
assault investigations when they first join the force, Luman said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodge has also suggested that detectives from the sex crimes detail, rather 
than patrol officers, be assigned to respond to calls about alleged rapes when 
possible. A Rape Hotline representative also should be requested, and a police 
surgeon, if necessary, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators with the sex crimes detail said department officials had ordered 
them not to comment. 
</P>
<P>
NOW also plans to ask the commission to study whether rape cases involving 
victims who are poor or minorities are being pursued vigorously, Schipske said. 
"Traditionally, if the woman is not a blonde and socially upscale, the rape is 
not considered a rape," Schipske said.

The holiday season is upon us once again, and once again you will have the 
opportunity to watch "It's a Wonderful Life" or "Miracle on 34th Street" almost 
every other day. To break the holiday rut, watch a different kind of Christmas 
story. The Original Theatre Works of Cerritos College will present the Lee Korf 
award-winning comedy "Your Father Owned a Reindeer" on selected dates beginning 
Friday through Dec. 15 in the Burnight Studio Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
New York playwright Richard Holland has written an offbeat story revolving 
around the holiday celebration of the eccentric Scavulo family. The assorted 
cast of characters includes Rebecca Bailey as Carol Scavulo, the oldest Scavulo 
daughter; Charles Gorman as Izzy, Carol's anthropologist husband; Dorothy 
McClane as Martha, matriarch of the Scavulo clan; Fred Lanciloti as Sal, the 
Scavulo patriarch; Susan Alderette as Sharon Scavulo and Jeff Tucker as Brian, 
her lover, a musician and waiter; Cliff Schneider as Doug Scavulo, the 
perpetual salesman; and Alecs Vildosola as Donnie Scavulo, a fashion designer. 
</P>
<P>
The play is set in Izzy and Carol's living room, adorned with various 
archeological and anthropological artifacts that are decorated by Carol with 
traditional Christmas trimmings. Martha lobbies for her first grandchild by 
giving Carol a sexy negligee as a present. Sal celebrates Christmas in his own 
special way, by betting on a horse named Christmas Tree. But personal quirks 
and hard-fought attempts at communication do not dampen the family's 
expectations of a happy holiday. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 plays were submitted nationally for the Lee Korf Playwriting 
Award, and this one by Holland was one of three winners. Holland became a 
professional playwright in 1981. He has served as assistant director for "The 
Chosen," Chaim Potok's $3.5-million off-Broadway musical, co-founded 
Stagewrights, a nonprofit playwrights' theater, and has had finalist entries in 
the O'Neill Competition and the Rosenthal New Play Prize. Holland is currently 
working on a musical adaptation of Mark Twain's "The Prince and the Pauper," 
which is expected to play Broadway in the fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"Your Father Owned a Reindeer" will be presented at 8 p.m. Friday, Saturday,

PEOPLE: 'GOOD NEWS' PUBLISHER IN THE WRIGHT PLACE FOR HONOR 
</P>

George Wright's policy during more than 30 years of publishing the Artesia News 
was to print mostly good news about Artesians. 
</P>
<P>
"We censored the news pretty carefully. I always covered the Sheriff's 
Department to make sure negative stories stayed out of the paper," Wright said. 
The 88-year-old former newspaperman said he once fired an employee who printed 
a story about a murder. "He did it while I was on vacation," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
Wright also rarely missed City Council meetings after moving to Artesia in 
1944. 
</P>
<P>
Now, city officials have decided to name a street in Wright's honor. Wright 
Place is on a cul de sac of tract homes in the southwest corner of the 
community, several blocks from Wright's home on 181st Street. "Wright Place has 
a certain ring to it," the former publisher said. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to honor our old-timers," veteran Councilman Ronald Oliver said. 
"George has been involved with the city for a long time. He has always tried to 
help the community." 
</P>
<P>
Wright, his wife, Lucille, and their daughter Shirley published the newspaper 
until selling it in the late 1970s. Lucille Wright died more than 10 years ago. 
"I'm just sorry Lucille is not here to share it with me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Nebraska, Wright met Lucille at an Omaha newspaper. After they 
married, the couple moved to California in 1934 and worked on numerous Los 
Angeles and Orange county newspapers before purchasing the Artesia News. 
</P>
<P>
Wright sold the paper in the late 1970s, then ran a printing shop for several 
years before retiring to travel throughout the country.

Two Long Beach Unified School District teachers excelled in the Ironman 
Triathlon in Hawaii this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Klaus Barth and Bob Piercy competed in the event that included a 2.4-mile swim, 
112-mile bike race and a 26.2-mile marathon. 
</P>
<P>
Barth, swimming and soccer coach at Wilson High School, finished first in the 
40-to-44 age bracket in 9 hours, 50 minutes, 22 seconds. Piercy, gymnastics and 
soccer coach at Wilson, placed in the middle of his 35-to-39 age group, with a 
time of 11 hours, 37 minutes.

Cerritos resident Roger Adams, 45, is issuing a warning to all players of the 
state lottery: Read the small print! 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Adams purchased a ticket and filed it in a drawer. Months 
later he checked his ticket and found that it contained five of the six winning 
numbers. Then lottery officials told him he had waited five days beyond the 
deadline to claim his winnings. All players must claim their prize money within 
180 days, according to regulations written on the back of the lottery ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Adams lost $2,996.

MOUNTED VOLUNTEERS PATROL ISOLATED ARROYO SECO AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Every lawman needs a partner, and Don Zimmerman's is a 17-year-old buckskin 
quarter horse named Skeeter. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman, 78, is a member of the Pasadena Volunteer Equestrian Unit, an unpaid 
and unarmed group of riders selected by the Pasadena Police Department to 
patrol on horseback through isolated stretches of the Arroyo Seco that are 
difficult or impossible to patrol by car. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically they're reserve police, but non-sworn, who can write citations and 
are trained with Mace," said Lt. Gregg Henderson of the Pasadena Police 
Department, who, with now-retired Lt. Wesley Rice, was instrumental in getting 
police reserve status for the unit in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In the Arroyo Seco, the unit's 16 members give warnings and citations to people 
with unleashed dogs, mountain bikers on the horse and hiking trails, and 
transients living outside the authorized camping areas. Police have caught 
drunken and disorderly visitors and even flashers after the riders radioed in 
their descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
The unit's presence alone serves to discourage activities such as 
spray-painting graffiti on rocks and trees, said Patrick Phillips, 32, a 
three-year member who patrols areas in the northern Arroyo Seco such as Oak 
Grove Park and Devil's Gate Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our main objective is to sort of police, not so much with guns and 
clubs but with eyes and ears," Phillips said. "We're out there to create a 
presence and to try to deter any activities that would make the arroyo 
undesirable." 
</P>
<P>
Members are issued a hat, shirt, belt and saddle blanket bearing the 
blue-and-gold emblems of the Pasadena Police Department, but receive no other 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Each equestrian patrols the Arroyo Seco an average of 30 hours a month during 
spring and summer, when public use of the arroyo peaks. 
</P>
<P>
The unit seeks recruits who are at least 21 years old, know how to ride and 
have access to a horse, although some unit members will share their mounts, 
said Lt. Betsy Bour, the unit's highest-ranking volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants should call the administrative section of the Pasadena Police 
Department. They must complete an interview and submit to a thorough background 
check. 
</P>
<P>
Horses must also prove that they are qualified for the work. "Some horses just 
don't do well on the trail at all," Bour said. "Some horses have done only ring 
work, and out on the trail every blowing branch scares them."

U.S. TROOP CUTS KNOCKED AWRY BY GULF CRISIS 
</P>

The massive Persian Gulf military buildup will make it all but impossible for 
the Pentagon to carry out the first round of personnel cuts mandated by 
Congress as part of a five-year plan to shrink the armed forces by 25%, defense 
officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is ready to inform Congress that the requirements 
of Operation Desert Shield probably will force a delay in this year's personnel 
reductions, sources said. He is expected to seek authorization to defer the 
cuts until later years. 
</P>
<P>
The Persian Gulf deployment is placing the heaviest demands on the U.S. Army, 
which had been expected to cut 40,000 uniformed personnel by the end of 1991 -- 
or half the overall 80,000 reduction approved by Congress for the fiscal year 
that began Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The probable need to delay the 1991 round of reductions -- and the savings they 
would have produced -- is the first concrete evidence that Operation Desert 
Shield will soak up much of the initial "peace dividend" generated by warming 
East-West relations. 
</P>
<P>
Advisers have told Cheney that the gulf deployment, which is expected to reach 
430,000 troops by mid-January, will require the Pentagon to restructure its 
five-year personnel reduction plan and persuade lawmakers to ease their demands 
for this year's reductions. 
</P>
<P>
Defense officials said it became clear in late November that the Pentagon would 
be unable to meet the personnel reductions mandated by Congress as part of an 
effort to reduce future defense spending in response to a declining Soviet 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Cheney approved an Army proposal to halt departures of soldiers 
whose terms of duty had expired and officers who had elected to retire. His 
action will prevent the sidelining of as many as 3,500 Army soldiers each 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The Army recently concluded that even under the most favorable circumstances, 
it could reduce its forces by no more than 20,000 this year. In the worst case 
-- a protracted war or a prolonged stalemate -- the service has told Cheney it 
would be unable to trim its rolls at all. 
</P>
<P>
"A sharp drawdown in strength in the last half or quarter of the year would 
destroy Army readiness," said one Pentagon source. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney had planned to cut the Army's personnel roster to 580,000 in 1996 from 
the current level of 750,000. The cuts would be part of an overall plan to 
eliminate a quarter of America's 2.1 million active-duty armed forces personnel 
over five years. 
</P>
<P>
"The services are very antsy about their ability to meet their end-strength 
reductions," said a senior defense official, who noted that Cheney may ask 
Congress as early as Monday to give the services some leeway in making the 
reductions this year. 
</P>
<P>
Army officials said almost three-quarters of the service's active-duty manpower 
is deployed abroad, in Europe as well as the Middle East, causing more turmoil 
in the ranks than at any time since the Army shifted to voluntary recruitment 
in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Corps, with two-thirds of its troops slated for deployment in the 
Persian Gulf by late January and almost 80% assigned somewhere overseas, also 
has instituted a program to stop the loss of some personnel. 
</P>
<P>
But officials said that even with the added strains, the Marines expect to be 
able to meet their first-year personnel reduction goal of 3,000 by Sept. 30, 
1991, the end of the fiscal year. Under Cheney's plan, the Corps would shrink 
to 175,000 by 1996 from about 200,000 now. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials already have argued that they will be hard-pressed to maintain 
six carrier battle groups, totaling hundreds of U.S. warships, while 
simultaneously retiring ships and sailors as directed by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The personnel reductions are part of overall defense spending cuts proposed by 
Cheney that would trim Pentagon outlays by 10% over the next five years. Those 
plans were devised before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and the resulting 
U.S. military buildup. 
</P>
<P>
The current U.S. deployment of about 240,000 troops is costing the government 
the equivalent of $17 billion a year, and the amount is expected to almost 
double when the recently announced buildup is completed in January.

U.S. INSISTS THERE WILL BE NO NEGOTIATING

Top-level Bush Administration officials, hastening to fend off criticism of the 
President's surprise offer to engage in talks with Iraq, insisted Saturday that 
there will be no negotiations with the government of Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
In separate televised interviews, Vice President Dan Quayle and Deputy National 
Security Adviser Robert M. Gates repeatedly emphasized that Bush's initiative 
is not an attempt to arrange some sort of deal with Hussein's regime. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a negotiation. It is not a change of policy," Quayle said. "It is 
simply to make one last direct appeal to Saddam Hussein to live up to those 
United Nations resolutions. . . . There are going to be talks. There is going 
to be discussion but no negotiations beyond what the United Nations has already 
decided." 
</P>
<P>
The two officials also rejected an Iraqi effort to link any discussion of a 
possible Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait with broader Mideast issues, such as an 
Arab-Israeli peace settlement or the rights of Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Bush offered to send Secretary of State James A. Baker III to 
Baghdad to meet with Hussein within the next few weeks and invited Iraqi 
Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz to meet with him in Washington the week of Dec. 10. 
The President previously had rejected the idea of sending a high-level American 
envoy to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
The comments by Quayle and Gates appear to be aimed, in part, at rebutting 
former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, who termed Bush's offer "a very 
grave step" that could prompt U.S. allies in Europe and the Mideast to open 
their own, separate negotiations with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not been this worried in decades," Kissinger said during an interview 
Friday night on ABC-TV's "Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
"I have the impression that none of our allies were informed of this, much less 
consulted, especially the Arab allies," Kissinger said. "It will now be 
impossible to prevent others from starting their own negotiations with Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe also that, if Saddam Hussein is even halfway skillful, he will 
present us with a number of propositions that will narrow the issue to a point 
where the military option will disappear, and therefore our bargaining position 
will erode." 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few months, several Mideast experts have predicted that Hussein 
might wait until just before the outbreak of war and then announce he would 
pull his troops out of most of Kuwait -- retaining only small but vital 
portions of Kuwaiti territory. Such an action would have the effect of eroding 
the international coalition that favors using force, if necessary, to make Iraq 
withdraw from all of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle maintained in an interview on CNN's "Evans and Novak" program that Baker 
would merely present Hussein directly with the same message that other world 
leaders, including Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, have conveyed to 
Aziz, the Iraqi foreign minister. The message, the vice president indicated, is 
that the United States and its allies will not negotiate until Iraq withdraws 
completely from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, you will have a face-to-face meeting with Saddam Hussein so he can get 
the message directly, and he can see the body language of Secretary Baker, and 
he will see how serious we are," Quayle asserted. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview broadcast by CNN, Gates indicated that one of the Bush 
Administration's major aims is to communicate directly with Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not clear what information gets through to him," Gates said. " . . . 
Those in his entourage are scared to death of him and don't want to tell him 
the bad news." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle and Gates emphasized that the Administration is not willing to address 
the Palestinian issue in the talks, which would be held before the Jan. 15 
deadline contained in a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing use of 
force if Iraq does not withdraw from Kuwait by that date. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, in its first response to Bush's offer, the Iraqi 
Revolutionary Command Council maintained that "Palestine and other occupied 
Arab lands will remain before our eyes and at the forefront of the issues dealt 
with in any dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
But Quayle asserted: "Palestine is not an issue on the table. The issue on the 
table is Saddam Hussein's invasion into Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
After unveiling his new diplomatic overture, Bush spent Saturday at Camp David, 
Md., in a rare session with all of America's top military officials, including 
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not some sort of council of war," Gates said. "There are a couple of new 
chiefs, and it's an opportunity for them to discuss a whole range of issues." 
He suggested that in addition to the Persian Gulf, the military leaders might 
address plans for next year's defense budget.

BUSH PLANS TO SEEK CUTS IN SAFETY NET FOR BANKS; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: OFFICIAL SAYS THAT UNDER THE PROPOSAL NOT ALL INSTITUTIONS WOULD ENJOY 
UNLIMITED DEPOSIT INSURANCE.

The Bush Administration plans to propose radical banking system reforms that 
would give regulators more power to allow big banks to fail without blanket 
government protection for the institutions or their depositors, a senior 
Administration official said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, certain to spark controversy in Congress and banking circles, 
would infuse greater "discipline" into the system by creating uncertainty over 
just which banks would be protected beyond the minimum levels required by the 
government's deposit insurance program, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
If enacted, the Administration plan would mean that some banks would no longer 
automatically receive complete government protection and total depositor 
insurance in the event of their failure. As a result, bank managers would be 
under greater pressure to follow more prudent business practices, said the 
official, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"Providing constructive ambiguity is at the heart of it," the official said. 
"The problem is that now, all of the ambiguity has been drained out of the 
system. We have got to create more uncertainty as to whether regulators will 
intervene." 
</P>
<P>
To instill that uncertainty, the official acknowledged, the government will 
have to let some institutions fail in order to demonstrate that its new policy 
is credible. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, expected to be introduced as part of a legislative package in 
January, would represent a dramatic change in federal banking policy. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Washington has pledged virtually automatic support and blanket 
protection for the nation's major commercial banks. At those institutions, 
federal deposit insurance has been extended well beyond the legal limit of 
$100,000 per account, in part to prevent panics and maintain consumer and 
investor confidence in the integrity of America's financial system. 
</P>
<P>
But that policy, known in the industry as the "too-big-to-fail" doctrine, has 
come under mounting criticism for contributing to a growing crisis in the 
banking system. The doctrine has, in effect, given bankers an incentive to 
engage in risky practices, while remaining secure in the knowledge that the 
government will bail them out if they get into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Administration proposal, at least in theory, size would no longer 
provide protection against failure. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to address 'too big to fail,' otherwise we can't have a real reform 
package," the Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent willingness to abandon the current doctrine comes at a time when 
the economy is sliding into a recession and the health of the banking industry 
appears more at risk than at any time since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Although the commercial banking system is in better shape than the 
scandal-plagued savings and loan industry, many banks have been forced to take 
losses on real estate loans and the government's deposit insurance fund has 
dwindled to a dangerously low level. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the timing of the proposal would seem to pose grave risks for the 
Administration, and might lead to charges that the White House is not living up 
to its responsibility to protect the soundness of the financial system. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to do away with the too-big-to-fail-doctrine represents just one 
component of a sweeping reform package now being prepared by the Treasury 
Department and the White House, following a legislative mandate ordering the 
Administration to propose reforms of the nation's deposit insurance system. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration official indicated that a final deposit insurance proposal 
has not been worked out. Several alternatives are now under study, including a 
plan to limit the number of insured accounts held by any one individual to 
three. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still looking at a bunch of options on deposit insurance, but we want 
to shrink it back to its original purpose, which was protecting small savers, 
letting them sleep at night," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
The overall package, as currently envisioned, would involve much more than a 
simple reform of deposit insurance, with the Administration apparently poised 
to push for a fundamental change in the structure of the commercial banking 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration feels strongly that issues of deposit insurance reform, 
that is, the extent and character of the safety net, are so closely intertwined 
with questions of reform of the industry's structure, that it makes no sense to 
treat them separately," Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said Friday in a 
speech in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
To address those concerns, the Administration plans to propose full interstate 
banking for the first time in the nation's history, in an effort to spur a 
massive consolidation among banks that, the Administration hopes, would winnow 
out the weakest institutions. Administration officials note that the United 
States has far more independent banks than any other country in the world, and 
they contend the system should shrink to become more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
But that plan will almost certainly draw fire from smaller banks, who fear they 
will be swallowed up by the nation's largest institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration also plans to propose an end to the so-called Glass-Steagall 
restrictions, which have prevented commercial banks from engaging in stock 
brokerage operations while prohibiting Wall Street firms from entering the 
banking business. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration plan would allow bank holding companies to set up 
subsidiaries separate from their commercial banking units that could enter the 
securities business, as long as they did so with funds that were not federally 
insured. 
</P>
<P>
While that proposal might increase the risks being faced by banking firms, the 
senior Administration official said that the proposal would provide for 
creation of "fire-walls" designed to prevent financial problems in securities 
trading operations from harming the commercial banking side of the business.

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, warning that his country's defense capabilities 
are under threat, decreed Saturday that rebellious Soviet republics no longer 
can be allowed to challenge Moscow's military policy, particularly by 
interfering with conscription. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's decree came in reaction to attempts by governments in the Soviet 
Union's 15 constituent republics to establish their own armies or to limit the 
military service of their youth to their own territory. 
</P>
<P>
It was his latest step in a concerted effort to appease the 4-million-member 
armed forces, which have complained ever more vocally in recent months that 
they are losing public respect and that the government tolerates far too much 
from upstart local leaders. 
</P>
<P>
But in another move certain to anger the military, leaders of the three Baltic 
republics, meeting Saturday in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, formally 
urged Soviet "occupation forces" to withdraw from their territory and said 
civilians will protest their presence as long as they remain. 
</P>
<P>
"We also urge the officers of the Soviet Union never to raise their weapons 
against our peaceful citizens," said the resolution, signed by the presidents 
of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltic leaders were responding in part to a decree Gorbachev issued Tuesday 
authorizing soldiers to use force if attacked. Arms depots have been repeatedly 
raided by militants seeking arms in the southern Soviet republics of Armenia, 
Azerbaijan and Georgia, and protesters in the Baltics have attempted several 
blockades of military areas. 
</P>
<P>
The trigger for Saturday's decree, however, appeared to be the decision last 
month by the Parliament of the Ukraine that the republic's soldiers would serve 
only within the republic. The Ukraine provides nearly 20% of Soviet soldiers, 
including a large proportion of noncommissioned officers, 
</P>
<P>
"All this has a negative effect on the formation of the personnel of the Soviet 
armed forces," Gorbachev's decree said. "It threatens vitally important issues 
of the Soviet state's defense capability." 
</P>
<P>
The turnout for the draft this year has been miserable, according to recent 
reports, with only small proportions of draftees showing up in Armenia, the 
western Ukraine, the Baltics and other areas where nationalist sentiment runs 
high. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, in a newspaper interview published Saturday, 
complained particularly about the Baltic governments. He said they encourage 
their youths not to serve and are "seeking open confrontation with the troops 
of the Baltic military region." 
</P>
<P>
The Parliament of Latvia voted Nov. 14 to cut off services to the army bases in 
the republic to encourage the troops to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"Winter is beginning, and they threaten us: 'We'll cut off the light, heat and 
water,' " Yazov told Komsomolskaya Pravda, the youth newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said he is even more concerned, however, about republic 
laws on territorial armies and the formation of local, technically illegal 
militias. 
</P>
<P>
"They gather the kids in some kind of bands, without any discipline, without 
any order," he said. "They try to get weapons, by stealing, robbing or attacks 
on warehouses. Is this how armies are formed? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm most concerned that young people are becoming the hostages of ambitious 
politicians who don't realize what will come tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Armed militias in Armenia submitted to a new, nationalist government this year 
only after an armed standoff and prolonged negotiations. Moldova, a small 
republic in the southwest splintered by ethnic unrest, has similar renegade 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
The popular governments of the Russian Federation, the Ukraine, Byelorussia and 
the Baltic republics all claim the right to their own armies or at least home 
service for their youths. 
</P>
<P>
Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the radical new president of Georgia, announced last week 
that his republic should have not only its own army but its own Black Sea 
fleet. 
</P>
<P>
To stop such demands, Gorbachev's decree invalidated all republic laws that 
contradict the Soviet constitution, which allocates defense functions to the 
central government.

Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, sister of first Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru 
and the first woman president of the United Nations General Assembly, died 
Saturday after a long illness, United News of India said. She was 90. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Pandit died in Dehra Dun, a town in the Himalayan foothills where she had 
lived for the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Pandit's political and diplomatic career spanned four decades. 
</P>
<P>
She led India's first delegations to the United Nations and was elected 
president of the General Assembly in 1953. She also served as India's 
ambassador to the United States, England, the Soviet Union and Spain. She was a 
member of Parliament for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the aristocratic family that governed India for 37 of its 43 years 
of independence, Mrs. Pandit, like her brother, was educated at home. 
</P>
<P>
She played an active role in India's struggle for independence and was 
imprisoned several times by the British colonial government. 
</P>
<P>
Although close to her brother, she became a staunch critic of his daughter, 
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, when Mrs. Gandhi's rule became increasingly 
authoritarian in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, Mrs. Pandit backed a coalition of opposition parties that ousted Mrs. 
Gandhi from power for two years. 
</P>
<P>
After Mrs. Gandhi's assassination in 1984, Mrs. Pandit renewed family ties with 
her niece's son, Rajiv Gandhi, who served as prime minister from 1984 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
A lover of nature, literature and a human rights activist, Mrs. Pandit 
possessed a sharp wit. When she was president of the General Assembly, a 
reporter once inquired about the color of her sari, the traditional attire of 
Indian women. 
</P>
<P>
She shot back: "Did you ask my predecessor the color of his tie?" 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by her daughter, novelist Nayantara Sahgal. Mrs. Pandit's 
husband, attorney Ranjit Pandit, died in 1944.

<P>
Author Harry M. Caudill, whose book "Night Comes to the Cumberlands" helped 
inspire President Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty, shot himself to death 
Thursday in view of the mountains he loved so fiercely. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
Caudill shot himself in the head, said Edison Banks Jr., the assistant 
commonwealth's attorney of Letcher County. 
</P>
<P>
Caudill was pronounced dead about 3 1/2 hours later at Whitesburg Appalachian 
Regional Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"He did it in typical Harry style," said Banks, a former student of Caudill's. 
"He was looking at the mountains and shot himself once in the temple area." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Gish, a friend of Caudill's, said the writer had Parkinson's disease. "It 
was the result of a long struggle with poor health," said Gish, who publishes 
The Mountain Eagle newspaper in Whitesburg with her husband, Tom. 
</P>
<P>
A retired lawyer and state legislator, Caudill taught Appalachian history for 
eight years at the University of Kentucky until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Caudill is best known for his 1963 book, "Night Comes to the Cumberlands," an 
expose of poverty in Appalachia. 
</P>
<P>
The book so vividly described Appalachia's problems that it brought the region 
into the national spotlight. President Johnson subsequently backed an array of 
social programs designed to develop the region and improve living standards for 
its people. 
</P>
<P>
Caudill vividly described environmental problems caused by strip mining, 
criticized absentee landowners and preached to improve the region's schools. He 
was widely admired for taking courageous stands against injustice despite huge 
obstacles and a hostile political climate. 
</P>
<P>
By last spring, Caudill had written 10 books, 80 essays and editorials and 
about 50 magazine articles protesting injustices faced by Appalachian 
residents.

Two people died in a fire that ravaged a board-and-care home early Saturday, 
according to fire officials. A woman who suffered smoke inhalation died at a 
nearby hospital and a man was killed when the second-floor ceiling collapsed in 
the fire, Assistant Fire Chief Don Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
The Alameda County coroner's office did not immediately release the names of 
the victims pending notification of relatives. All of the other residents of 
Dillard's House of Care in East Oakland were taken to a nearby hospital, three 
for treatment for smoke inhalation and 13 for treatment for exposure, Matthews 
said. Firefighters responded to the blaze about 3 a.m. It took 26 firefighters 
30 minutes to control the fire, which caused an estimated $50,000 in damage. 
"The second floor was a mass of flames coming out the windows," Matthews said. 
Board-and-care centers house alcoholics, drug addicts, mentally ill and elderly 
people.

A cloud-seeding flight over Yosemite National Park has upset officials and 
environmentalists who say it threatens the natural ecosystem and climate of the 
area. Last Sunday's flight by Fresno-based Atmospherics Inc. was performed 
under a contract with the Turlock and Modesto irrigation districts. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said they are attempting to increase runoff by 2% to 7%. 
However, Yosemite Supt. Michael Finley said the cloud seeding must be stopped 
because it dispenses certain chemicals, including silver iodide. The chemicals 
are supposed to collect moisture to form snow or larger drops of moisture. 
Finley said the chemicals could accumulate in the park and damage the 
ecosystem. "The National Park Service has a policy opposing attempts at weather 
alteration systemwide," Finley said. Before the program began, water officials 
hired a San Francisco firm to conduct an environmental review of cloud seeding 
in the area. Finley said the report failed to address the effect the weather 
modification system may have on the ecosystem. Experts disagree on the impact 
of silver iodide. One Park Service researcher said silver iodide may not have 
any measurable impact, but was still an intrusion of unknown dimensions into a 
natural ecosystem.

TWO CITIES' PLANS TO REDEVELOP HIGHWAY 101 MAY MEAN THE DEATH OF THE ROADWAY'S 
CHARM, CRITICS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every now and then, when the hustle-bustle freeway life throws a roadblock 
across his mental health, Greg Jorgenson hops inside his turquoise 1951 Ford 
Ranch Wagon and takes a little detour along Highway 101, pretending things were 
like they used to be. 
</P>
<P>
He grips the big steering wheel with both hands, and lets his shoulder-length 
hair flap in the gentle coastal breeze as he glides past scenic stretches of 
white-capped ocean waves lapping the rugged North County coastline -- views 
framed like pretty postcards through his driver's window. 
</P>
<P>
And he smiles as he passes all the funky, anything-goes roadside attractions -- 
the taco shops, screaming billboards, Art Deco road signs, mom-and-pop 
transmission joints, and riff-raff motels reincarnated from some spooky old 
Hitchcock thriller. 
</P>
<P>
It's a drive that takes him back in time -- reflecting an era of 
black-and-white TV and "Burma Shave" signs, when hamburger stands featured 
smiling car hops, and where full-service gas stations were the rule, not the 
dated exception. 
</P>
<P>
Like the long-gone cross-country travelers who once got their kicks on Route 
66, Greg Jorgenson has his fun on Highway 101. 
</P>
<P>
"For a lot of people like myself, Highway 101 is the only road to drive," says 
the 35-year-old Oceanside writer and coastal gadfly. "It's the West Coast 
symbol of the open road, the epitome of freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Jorgenson began writing a weekly column about Highway 101 for a 
North County newspaper, attempting to capture the essence of "that mystical 
stretch of earth built from asphalt and the dreams of those in search of the 
ultimate cruise." 
</P>
<P>
But Jorgenson sees danger signs ahead for his beloved old highway. 
</P>
<P>
This year, two North County cities -- Encinitas and Solana Beach -- have begun 
long-term redevelopment projects in an attempt to shape the future use of their 
stretches of Highway 101. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the road's decaying infrastructure and haphazard commercial character, 
officials say the coast highway needs a guiding hand to lead it into the next 
century and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Both cities have created redevelopment agencies and hired outside consulting 
firms to draw up plans. Meanwhile, citizen's advisory groups have begun mulling 
over futuristic visions of what Highway 101 might look like in, say, 2025. 
</P>
<P>
So what's in store for 101? There are shortcomings on specifics, but no lack of 
bureaucratic esoterica. One Solana Beach goal, for instance, intends to 
"remedy, remove, and prevent physical blight and economic obsolescence," 
whatever that might foretell. 
</P>
<P>
They are also talking about such concepts as architectural standards, adequate 
parking and pedestrian access. 
</P>
<P>
So, the future of the California coast's most colorful icons is in the hands of 
bureaucrats, residents and business people. And there's no little apprehension 
of what kind of conformity they may try to legislate on the old highway. 
</P>
<P>
But roadside redevelopment, officials insist, does not necessarily mean the 
wholesale replacement of time tested mom-and-pop shops with new anonymous 
mini-malls, and 1,000-room chain hotels. 
</P>
<P>
"Redevelopment is not a tool for changing the character of Highway 101," said 
Solana Beach City Manager Michael Huse. "If anything, it's a tool to retain 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Like other native San Diegans of his generation, the 43-year-old Huse has vivid 
memories of leisurely drives his family once took along Highway 101 to Los 
Angeles or Tijuana. For him, this is not just another city project, it's 
dealing with a part of his own past. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, that highway really became the Route 66 of the California 
coast," the La Mesa native recalled. "My parents are from Missouri, and we used 
to go back during the summer and drive the real Route 66, past the curio shops, 
motels and unique old gas stations. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever we drove Highway 101, I'd get the same feeling. There's no doubt 
about it, it's an image a lot of us would like to see preserved. When I'm 81, I 
still want to be able to go over to Roberto's taco stand on Highway 101 for 
three rolled tacos." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Omsted agrees. When the Encinitas city councilwoman looks into her crystal 
ball, she sees only good changes coming, for example, for the cypress 
tree-canopied stretch of the highway winding through Leucadia. 
</P>
<P>
"I love that road just the way it is," she said. "If you want modern 1990s 
California glitz, go inland to El Camino Real. But if you want an old-time 
flavor -- the taco stands and auto repair places -- you go to Highway 101. 
</P>
<P>
"Modern malls have their purpose. But there are times when the spirit needs the 
nourishment and individuality of a drive along 101. We want the atmosphere to 
be funky. Is there such a thing as expensive funky?" 
</P>
<P>
But Jorgenson and many Highway 101 business owners in both cities have their 
doubts. When city planners get together, they say, the result will be something 
less than the eclectic mix of muffler shops and flea markets the highway 
supports today. 
</P>
<P>
They fear the down-to-earth aesthetics of the old road -- and what it has 
represented of California's motoring past -- will be lost forever, and that 
conformity will wash across the old Tarmac highway. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially in Leucadia, part of the road's charm is its Okie Depression 
architecture, funkified by the hippies during the 1960s," Jorgenson said. 
</P>
<P>
Along the milelong Leucadia stretch, for example, there exists a mental health 
clinic, a Tarot card reader, acupuncturist and flower shop run by a woman known 
as The Plant Lady. 
</P>
<P>
There's a vintage clothing store with a roadside mannequin with a 33-rpm record 
for a hat and musical notes for a brassiere, leaning against a pink Cadillac 
with two flat tires. There's a psychic book store and doughnut shop, along with 
several used-car dealerships and taco stands -- few of which could exist in a 
modern mall, Jorgenson said. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't program that out-of-step look, that funky mix, into a city's 
plans, saying 'We're going to be funky,' " Jorgenson said. "It's got to come 
about naturally." 
</P>
<P>
Since it was built in the 1930s, covering the old El Camino Real trail used by 
19th-Century Catholic missionaries, the four-lane Highway 101 has been more 
than just a road for the locals who traversed it. 
</P>
<P>
For years, before all the freeway-building frenzy of the 1950s, Highway 101 was 
the only link for a whole string of coastal cities between Los Angeles and San 
Diego, locals say. 
</P>
<P>
It was the lifeline of the North County beachside communities, serving both as 
stop-and-go neighborhood strip and invitation to the open road -- an interstate 
highway having a 1,644-mile romance with the coast, running from the Mexican 
border to the tip of northwest Washington. 
</P>
<P>
For Jorgenson, who writes his column for the weekly Beach News under the 
pseudonym Les Burden Jr., part of the allure of Highway 101 was the fact that 
you could drive a few miles up the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Or, if you were in the mood, you could go all the way -- and drive clear to 
Canada and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
"And all along the way, there were all these wonderfully tacky old full-service 
businesses," Jorgenson said. "Most of them are gone now. But if you get into an 
old car like this and squint your eyes a little bit, you can imagine things 
like they used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Cosmo Sciacca is a retired California Highway Patrol motorcycle cop who once 
patrolled Highway 101 from Del Mar to Carlsbad during the early 1960s. He 
remembers the road like he would an old beer-drinking buddy. 
</P>
<P>
He recalls sipping countless cups of coffee with the long-distance truckers at 
Ruthies coffee shop in what is now Solana Beach. The truckers used to line 
their rigs along the highway like some big wall of rubber and metal. 
</P>
<P>
And the boys needed a rest. Because those were the days when the drive from Los 
Angeles to San Diego took an entire afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Sciacca remembers the dozens of Los Angeles-area drivers he would ticket week 
after week as they sped down Highway 101 toward Tijuana for the weekend, racing 
to place bets at the horse track there. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd say, 'Hurry it up with the ticket, will ya? They're going to close the 
betting window on me,' " the 63-year-old Sciacca recalled. 
</P>
<P>
And he remembers the tragic scenes of bloody car crashes along the stretch 
through Leucadia, where weary Los Angeles-bound motorists -- tuckered out from 
a weekend of partying south of the border -- would fall asleep at the wheel and 
ram head-on into the big roadside cypress and eucalyptus trees. 
</P>
<P>
Bill (Willie) Strickland started patroling Highway 101 on a CHP motorcycle in 
1936, when he used to hide behind billboards to "stop 'em, pinch 'em and let 
'em go." Now 84 and long-retired, he can still recall all those funky Highway 
101 road signs. 
</P>
<P>
Once, Strickland even became part of that coastal roadside theater -- the CHP 
put his picture on a big old billboard advising driver caution: "Don't Take 
Chances in Traffic," it read. 
</P>
<P>
Most days, though, Sciacca and Strickland used to love to ride their 
motorcycles through traffic along 101, watching, as Strickland recalled, "the 
Marines go one way, the sailors the other." 
</P>
<P>
But, when Interstate 5 opened in the late 1960s, the job changed. The cars 
traveled too fast there. Suddenly, the fun was gone. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, fewer and fewer cars traversed the old coastal route. Caltrans 
officials in San Diego County took down the venerable Highway 101 shields that 
were once posted along the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
That's when 101 became a retired road -- a blue highway. 
</P>
<P>
"We handed over the upkeep to the local communities," said Caltrans spokesman 
Jim Larson. "They took care of it. And, if they wanted to rename it, they went 
right ahead. It was their baby." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, in some North County communities, Highway 101 developed more 
aliases than a bad-check artist. It became known as the Pacific Coast Highway, 
the coastal corridor, San Diego 21 or Old Highway 101. 
</P>
<P>
In Del Mar, it became Camino del Mar. In downtown Encinitas, it was now 1st 
Street. In Carlsbad, it became Carlsbad Boulevard. And Hill Street in 
Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
Some communities like Solana Beach, however, have decided to keep things the 
way they always were -- they have continued calling their stretch of the old 
road Highway 101. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little sad to see the name change from community to community," said 
Solana Beach city manager Huse. "It's still the same stretch of road, yet it 
has different names. It would be nice to get back to the old name up and down 
the entire coast." 
</P>
<P>
The highway's name isn't the only thing that has changed in recent years. When 
I-5 opened, most of the businesses moved inland with the traffic. So did the 
population, which began to expand to more inland communities, bringing with it 
the locally oriented commerce. 
</P>
<P>
What was left, in the opinion of some residents, was an eyesore. Seedy looking 
used-car lots, including one with hanging pinatas and a huge banner that 
advertises "Financiamos," as a come-on to its largely Latino clientele. 
</P>
<P>
There are liquor stores, run-down motels that cater to lowbrow, long-term 
tenants. And all those taco shops, seemingly one on every corner. 
</P>
<P>
"Those nasty old motels with all those long-term tenants, I'd like to see them 
gone," said Kirsten Cline, who owns a bed and breakfast hotel overlooking 
Highway 101 in Leucadia. "A few of the billboards could go. And those taco 
shops, we could definitely eliminate a few of them."

<P>
Cline is a member of one of two committees in Encinitas that are meeting to 
hammer out a future vision for Highway 101. Similar meetings are being held in 
Solana Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Once a plan has been formulated -- in both cities, as early as next summer -- 
public hearings will be held to gain final community approval for the 
respective redevelopment areas. 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, Cline and her committee counterparts are weighing the merits 
of an improved sewer system along 101 in Leucadia; how to develop more 
pedestrian access and get people to keep their businesses tidy. 
</P>
<P>
There's also talk of a plan for color coordination for businesses as well as 
architectural standards. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of the colors people chose for their places seem pretty outlandish," 
Cline said. "And some of the businesses just attract the wrong type of crowd -- 
so that you're almost afraid to go out at night. We're going to have to deal 
with those kinds of issues." 
</P>
<P>
Committee member Morgan Mallory agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mess," he said of the strip of 101 near his Leucadia frame shop. 
"Nobody wants another La Jolla or Laguna Beach here. But the ambience of this 
old road is being diluted by all the trash, the used cars, and the homeless. 
That's what we're going to try and change." 
</P>
<P>
Both Mallory and Cline say they would like to see the Leucadia stretch of 101 
become an art colony that would attract locals and outsiders alike for the art 
stores and antique shops. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as people have pride of ownership, that's all we ask," Cline said. 
"It's just sinful to see it so dirty. It's like Tijuana-ville in some spots." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Thompson has an answer for that one. He and his wife, Yvonne, run the 
Royal Motor Inn in Leucadia, right next store to a spanking new Ocean Inn. 
Thompson says his place has just as much right to see 2025 as the new guy. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because we're a little old motel doesn't mean we house riffraff here. It 
doesn't mean we run a whorehouse," he said. "But that's what they want you to 
think." 
</P>
<P>
But, whatever happens during redevelopment, Cline says, neither she nor the 
other committee members plan to dictate what types of roadside businesses will 
grace Highway 101. The economy will take care of that -- whoever can survive, 
will, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Garrett, Leucadia's Plant Lady, says she knows better. 
</P>
<P>
"They should leave this road just like it is, they shouldn't change it one 
bit," said the Leucadia florist whose Plant Lady shop has become famous over 
the past 14 years, both her colorful character and flower arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure places are a little dirty, a little run-down. But that's the way people 
like them. That's what this road is all about. Even if I apologize for the 
dirt, people say, 'That's OK. It's like a country atmosphere here. We wouldn't 
have it any other way.' " 
</P>
<P>
Garrett insists that, once redevelopment begins, rents on businesses like hers 
will undoubtedly be raised. "Then we won't exist anymore," said the 
69-year-old, who began her business in 1976 selling flowers from a Volkswagen 
van parked along Highway 101 in Leucadia. 
</P>
<P>
"Businesses will come that can afford the high rent. And that's what they want 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Down the road at the Leucadian bar, Andy Kentera isn't ready to throw in the 
towel to redevelopment. Kentera opened his ocean-motif bar in 1954, and since 
then has kept the status quo there. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, the Leucadian is so dark it takes the eyes a full minute to become 
accustomed to the wan light. "It's not too dark in here," the bartender says. 
"It's too light outside." 
</P>
<P>
The problems along Highway 101, Kentera says, can surely be blamed on 
out-of-town owners who don't care "if there are 10 wetbacks to a room in their 
motels." 
</P>
<P>
The bar owner says he's run a tight ship all these years. And no City Council 
is going to make him walk the redevelopment plank before his time. "I'm 
sticking around until they throw me out," he said of the Council, whose members 
sit on the board of the redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here longer than the whole lot of them anyway." 
</P>
<P>
For now, images of Highway 101 -- and its roadside theater -- continue to find 
their way into the popular culture. This month, a band named after the 
venerable highway will tour Southern California. And a new book, "U.S. 101 -- A 
Highway Adventure" was published this fall. 
</P>
<P>
That's the way Greg Jorgenson likes it. These days, he's on the road, dreaming 
up new 101 column ideas -- like the best taco shops, trailer parks, the stories 
behind the weird empty lots and even weirder people. 
</P>
<P>
"Highway 101 is my beat," he said. "And that's the way I like it."

NEW SCHOOL BOARD CHIEF AIMS TO DISMANTLE COLOR BARRIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shirley Weber still vividly remembers the group discussion on her dormitory 
floor at UCLA when a fellow undergraduate said she didn't want any blacks 
living in her neighborhood because they would depress property values. 
</P>
<P>
"They had to hold me back from going after that girl," recalled Weber, a San 
Diego State University professor of Afro-American studies. 
</P>
<P>
Weber has come a long way in learning how to deal with such incidents, 
forsaking the emotion of a direct response to work instead within political and 
public-pressure parameters, most prominently since December, 1988, as a trustee 
of the San Diego Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
But Weber's maturation from a UCLA undergraduate to a well-known community 
leader has in no way diminished her burning intensity to tear away at barriers 
and attitudes she sees holding back the progress of African-Americans and other 
nonwhites. 
</P>
<P>
Next week Weber, 42, assumes the president's role in the nation's 
eighth-largest urban school system, a 122,000-student district now more than 
61% nonwhite. Her agenda to boost minority achievement -- and to deal with 
teachers and principals unable or unwilling to share that determination -- will 
assume center stage among numerous school renewal efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"She's impeccably honest, she's strong and demanding, and, although she sure 
always doesn't make you comfortable, she sure does make you think," said Kay 
Davis, the outgoing school board president. 
</P>
<P>
"She says things that people often don't want to hear, like the fact we are not 
succeeding with enough kids," said Hugh Boyle, president of the San Diego 
Teachers Assn., "that we still have to prove we can take kids from different 
backgrounds, despite economics or parent problems or whatever, and move them 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
In her first two years on the board, Weber wasted little time trying to put the 
district's collective feet to the fire regarding minority student achievement. 
Although her predecessor, community educator Dorothy Smith, was no less 
committed to improving the schools for blacks, Smith's courtly manner pales in 
comparison to Weber's often strident rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
"Dorothy Smith could chew you out, and you might not realize it for a day or 
two," one central office administrator said privately. "When Shirley chews you 
out, you know it immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Weber has pushed district administrators to come up with new ways of trying to 
improve the sorry performance of many black and Latino students. One newly 
adopted policy requires any school whose ethnic minority students test below 
state averages to close the gap by half within two years or face 
as-yet-unspecified consequences. 
</P>
<P>
A powerful and articulate public speaker, Weber continually pushes board 
members as well to see school actions from the viewpoint of minority students 
and parents, who she believes still too often suffer a lack of reward and 
motivation under the educational system. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be good for the school board and the district to have her as 
president, because she does her homework regarding children's education, and 
she is a strong advocate for academic quality," said Tom Day, president of 
SDSU. Day and Weber have not seen eye-to-eye on many affirmative-action issues 
at the university, with Weber publicly berating the institution for not having 
the will to move faster in hiring more minority professors. 
</P>
<P>
"She's one tough mama -- she's tough, not just on me, but on administrators, on 
teachers, on students, on parents -- she doesn't pull punches with anyone," Day 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Weber makes no apologies for her role in symbolizing the demands and 
frustrations of the school district's nonwhite constituents. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a mission to raise the issues that others are not raising," Weber said 
during a series of interviews. "We must demand that black and brown kids learn 
better. I'm not always sure the board or district believes it in (their) 
hearts, but rather believes it because it's the right thing (politically) to 
believe." 
</P>
<P>
In the same vein, Weber neither considers her mission a burden, nor recoils 
from being perceived by some teachers and principals as having a "black" 
agenda. She receives calls not only from residents in her Southeast San Diego 
district, but from black parents across the city who feel uncomfortable talking 
with their own district trustee because they are white. 
</P>
<P>
"There is racism in this society that I bear for being an African-American," 
Weber said. "The reality is that I am black, that I'll always be seen as 
different, and that my remarks and assertiveness will always be amplified 
because of that." 
</P>
<P>
Whether speaking to parents at Gompers Secondary School or to a church group or 
teachers, Weber oftens describes her philosophy with reference to her 
upbringing in a Watts housing project and the racial antagonism encountered as 
she worked her way through UCLA for her doctorate in speech communications. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I tell my (college) students that they will have to be even better 
prepared than whites, that they will have to be very, very good, because often 
they will be seen as representing more than just themselves. . . . Yes, that 
may be unfair, but that's the real world." 
</P>
<P>
She uses church and community forums as "bully pulpits" to persuade parents and 
grandparents to set aside a quiet space for study for children, to forsake the 
"boom box and gold chains for books and conversation," to demand "more than the 
average from our children." 
</P>
<P>
Weber's unwillingness to modify her philosophy in order to gain political 
advantage has won her admiration in the African-American community, the 
district's personnel chief said. 
</P>
<P>
"Shirley is one of those persons who has managed to attain middle-class black 
status and still retain strong links to the black community," said George 
Russell, himself black. "That hasn't been true for a lot of black middle-class 
people, and the black community feels that and appreciates Shirley's continued 
strong connections to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Her views are not always shared universally by them, but they are always 
well-respected." 
</P>
<P>
Weber made no apologies earlier this fall when she pulled her son from the 
gifted program at Encanto Elementary and placed him in a private school in 
Southeast San Diego that focuses on the self-esteem of black children. Despite 
criticism that her move would be seen as hypocritical, Weber said she had to do 
what was best for her son, and that it would not affect her resolve to develop 
more African-American cultural offerings in the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
"And I don't apologize for my family having worked to have the (financial) 
resources to be able to have done it," Weber said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Weber wears her hair in a large Afro as a symbol of her heritage. She also 
spends much of her non-classroom time at SDSU advising black students on 
everything from research papers to child care centers to job possibilities to 
family matters. 
</P>
<P>
Her office is plastered with honors, ranging from the 1982 Outstanding San 
Diego State University Faculty Award to a plaque from the Figueroa Church of 
Christ in Los Angeles -- a testimony to her religious upbringing and strong 
faith -- as well as posters of Malcolm X, Angela Davis and the 1960s African 
nationalist Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally among African-American educators, there's been a real concern 
that taking a strong advocacy role for African-American students would be 
perceived as pro-black and anti-white," said Russell, the personnel chief, 
"when in fact it can be both pro-African-American and pro-all students." 
</P>
<P>
Weber acknowledges that more than a few teachers and principals fear her 
because of her outspokenness. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I am very pro-African-American kid, and I don't say every time, 'But I 
love white kids,' because no one else on the board makes excuses for not 
advocating for minority kids," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It amazes me how super-super-sensitive some people are when you make any 
comments about change in the district. You get hordes of people suddenly 
defensive, saying, 'But I'm doing a good job.' I'm not saying you do it to be 
vicious, but rather to engage in some self-criticism." 
</P>
<P>
Weber said she receives a lot of letters -- many anonymous -- from district 
teachers who tell her "to come teach in their class for a week, and see that 
these minority children are social misfits or whatever, that they can't learn. 
</P>
<P>
"It really bothers me because this district has a lot of good teachers, yet 
everyone becomes so defensive when we talk about our taking more responsibility 
for what happens to kids in school." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Weber knows the reality of having to win at least two other votes on the 
board, in addition to her own, for anything she wants to accomplish, and then 
wait to see the policy wend its way through the system. 
</P>
<P>
She would like to see the board stick by its equity and gap-achievement goals 
and hold teachers accountable for their success or failure, to perhaps give 
teachers in predominantly nonwhite schools smaller class sizes, and to remove 
additional principals from those same schools -- beyond the several already 
changed during the past year -- and replace them with hard-chargers more 
willing to tackle the minority achievement problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that, before you maybe shut down schools that fail, which is drastic 
but maybe will become necessary, you have to have equal conditions in the 
classroom," she said. "So, if it is tougher to teach kids in Southeast who come 
to school less well-prepared than, say in La Jolla, then maybe give them 
smaller classes" to compensate. 
</P>
<P>
Russell fears, however, that Weber's assertiveness will make it more difficult 
for her to carry out her ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"She's made some inroads with the top leadership of the teachers union," he 
said, "but I think the folks in the trenches have yet to come around and accept 
what Shirley and the board are trying to push. 
</P>
<P>
"We've already had that experience (of resistance) from some in regard to the 
African-American males project," in which special black teachers work with 
black males -- who nationwide do poorly overall in public schools -- to boost 
their self-esteem, improve study skills and present aspects of African-American 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
"Shirley has the delicate role both to be seen as board president for the whole 
district and to continue to be an advocate for African-Americans." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego schools Supt. Tom Payzant sees Weber as able to handle the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she can balance the pressures of her own program with those of the 
whole system, especially when the responsibility for doing more for children of 
color increasingly and legitimately falls to all five trustees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"And, while Shirley is direct, and sometimes brusque, she is open to good 
argument and can tell a story on herself. . . . She doesn't always take herself 
so seriously." 
</P>

Photo, MUCH TO SAY: Articulate, outspoken, blunt -- Shirley Weber has cut an 
influential path during her first two years on the San Diego city schools 
board. Now, her role as board president will give her greater visibility for 
her goal of pushing improved achievement for black and Latino students. ;

'BRODERICK'S LANDING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dare we be encouraged? Is it wise to embrace the knowledge that San Diego's 
legal profession can boast at least one attorney who questions Dan Broderick's 
duality, and the San Diego County Bar Assn.'s fund drive in Broderick's honor? 
("San Diego at Large," Nov. 28) 
</P>
<P>
Dan Broderick's "honor" prompts heated debate. 
</P>
<P>
His very own writing declared a driven obsession for professional and material 
success. His lust for power and greed clearly left his family on hold. 
</P>
<P>
Please allow me to praise Joseph E. Driscoll for his lone and resonant voice. 
Do his feelings and thinking truly stand apart from our legal community? Has he 
no associates in his court?

IRONIC AND TRAGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I cannot imagine what it would be like to have no home to return to, no 
familiar place to lay my head at night, no friendly voice to ask in the 
morning, "Did you sleep well?" Nor can I imagine what it would be like to be 
discharged from a hospital stay and not be able to say, "I am going home." 
</P>
<P>
There are six persons with AIDS who are living in the Fraternity House in 
Oceanside because they have no other place to go. They receive loving care and 
attention around the clock. In the past three years, more than 100 people with 
this disease-without-a-cure have been cared for there; 70 of them have died. 
The numbers are not huge, but they represent seriously sick human beings who 
require comfort and care. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, they do not always find compassion. 
</P>
<P>
Places like Fraternity House must exist until the day comes when health 
insurance will cover all costs and education will wipe out both homophobia and 
the multitude of myths about the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Tragically, Fraternity House has just been informed that an anticipated $10,000 
grant from Wells Fargo Bank will not be available. Fraternity House receives no 
public money. The size of the grant is infinitesimal when one compares it to 
the millions wasted in Sacramento and Washington. But to six patients, those 
dollars represent three daily meals, regular medication, competent nursing 
care, clean linen, heat and the rest of the comforts that most of us take for 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult for me to understand how we spend so much money in this country 
for so many causes without any apparent attempt at prioritizing. I cannot 
resist noting that, printed on the back of the story about the grant loss, 
there is an article titled "Wanted: Private Jet for Five Finicky Passengers," 
(Nov. 20). 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Zoo seeks "$50,000 to charter a jet to fly five gorillas from 
Cincinnati and Philadelphia" to San Diego. Moving gorillas across the country 
must certainly pose a problem. As a Diamond Club member of the Zoological 
Society of San Diego, I know how important those animals are to the zoo and to 
the public. The irony, nevertheless, remains.

In response to "Ex-Navy Trainer Attacks U.S. Use of Sea Animals" (Nov. 13): 
</P>
<P>
I find David Reames' position that he is "concerned about human beings" quite 
ironic. 
</P>
<P>
Reames argues that the use of marine mammals endangers the lives of human 
soldiers because of the animals' unreliability and, therefore, the mammals 
should not be used in military combat. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, what about the endangered lives of the marine mammals? 
</P>
<P>
The sea animals are trained to please the trainer and are unaware of the 
potentially destructive task they are performing, and could easily make a 
mistake and not realize the seriousness of their actions. As one protester's 
placard stated, "How can dolphins know friends from foe?" 
</P>
<P>
Man should fight his own battles and leave the innocent creatures out of it!

REFLECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. Jeanette Avent, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santee resident Karen Smaniotto, 28, thinks she has one of the best jobs in the 
world. Much like a pioneer doctor, Smaniotto, a home health-care nurse, travels 
to patients' homes, dispensing health care with a dose of genuine concern. She 
was interviewed by Times staff writer G. Jeanette Avent and photographed by 
David McNew. 
</P>
<P>
In Pennsylvania, I worked on a medical surgery floor for about 2 1/2 years. I 
wanted to get into home health even while I was at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital environment was becoming stressful for me. The amount of 
responsibility and accountability for a hospital nurse is enormous. Veteran 
nurses will tell you nurses are doing a lot more than they used to do. We'd 
have as many as six patients, and they'd all be ringing their service bells at 
once. It's just an incredible amount of work to be doing. 
</P>
<P>
I was looking for career options. I had a friend in home health nursing, and 
she was always telling me about it. 
</P>
<P>
It took a while because of seniority. Other people with more job experience got 
the job before me. I've been working for Scripps Memorial more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals are releasing patients to home care because their problems can be 
handled at home, people want to be at home and they generally do better at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
I consider this job very easy to deal with, but the medical knowledge required 
runs the gamut. My work is a lot of teaching and patient education. I teach 
patients about their medicines and when to take them, about their disease 
process and what they're dealing with, and safety in the home. 
</P>
<P>
With newly diagnosed diabetics, I have to teach them from scratch how to care 
for themselves. I also draw blood, care for wounds, and, in one case, I was 
able to get a portable chest X-ray taken in the home. 
</P>
<P>
When I get admissions from the hospital, I go out to the patients' home, 
evaluate them and set up the frequency and plan of care. For example, we 
arrange to see a patient two to four times a week for four weeks and then one 
to three times for five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Each visit, I spend anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour with them, and 
sometimes longer. The majority of my patients have Medicare, which pays 100% 
for our services for a nine-week period. 
</P>
<P>
I average about five people a day. In a typical day, I'll have a patient with a 
bypass graft in her leg. I'm instructing her in wound care. I'm also seening a 
lady with emphysema and diabetes, and I'm seeing a lady who had a repair of a 
herniated disc. She's more of a physical therapy patient. I've been teaching 
her pain management. She's learning when to take her medication before the pain 
becomes so severe in order to nip the pain in the bud, and I'm teaching her 
distraction techniques. Turn music on, turn the TV on so the mind won't be so 
focused on the discomfort so much. 
</P>
<P>
We do have home-care pediatric nurses for children, but the majority of my 
patients are older. They're all pretty much in their upper 60s and 70s. They 
get really close to me. At first when I go see them, they say, "I don't want to 
be bothered, I'm fine." Then over time, we build a therapeutic relationship, 
and then at the end they don't want us to go. 
</P>
<P>
In the hospital setting, I had a few patients where I was able to be their 
primary nurse because of a long hospital stay. We'd have that bond and we were 
both sad when they'd leave, but nothing like in home health nursing. 
</P>
<P>
Some cases are terminal. I just discharged a really neat 82-year-old lady dying 
of colon cancer. She was incredible. I used to just want to cry because of the 
way she was about her death and dying and her acceptance of it. She would talk 
abut it, joke about it. She'd be sitting in the room with her nephew and niece 
and her nurse's aide, and she'd have us all chuckling. She was a very classy 
older lady who just had the funniest sense of humor. She was sitting there 
weak, pale, sick and dying, yet she was entertaining us. She was an incredible, 
high-spirited positive lady. I went in taking vital signs and seeing about her 
nutrition, but there wasn't anything really skilled I could do. So I made a 
referral to hospice through our social worker, and they took over the case. 
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of depressed patients too. I have a patient right now who's 
been in and out of the hospital with chronic heart failure. We're approaching 
the holiday, and her husband just died a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Those with emphysema and chronic heart failure and patients in and out of the 
hospital a lot, those are the ones most depressed. I just try to allow them to 
ventilate their feelings and try to find their positive coping mechanism and 
get them involved in things they used to be involved with. They feel a lot 
better just by being able to get things off their chest. 
</P>
<P>
But I'm not bothered by it. I do think about my patients, but I don't usually 
take their problems home with me. In between patients when I'm driving, I 
process my feelings and concern and work through it. 
</P>
<P>
It's a great nursing job. Anybody who's burnt out at the hospital, instead of 
leaving the profession, I'd say go to home health unless they're interested in 
something else. 
</P>
<P>
There's not a lot of stress with this job. Yet we're assessing and monitoring 
patients. We're in touch with the doctor as necessary. Say a patient's feet are 
starting to swell and they need an increase in diuretic medication, we call 
their doctor. If their blood pressure is up and they need more medication, we 
get that arranged. 
</P>
<P>
We update doctors on their patients, and how they're doing, and hopefully we 
can keep people out of the hospital. The doctors rely on the nurses in the 
field.

3 SHOT IN FRACAS AFTER TRAFFIC ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Navy seamen were shot during a melee that erupted after a man backed his 
car into another car at a Church's Fried Chicken restaurant in the 3100 block 
of Main Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Cathcart, 22, was shot twice in the head and remained in serious 
condition Saturday at UC San Diego Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
Another Navy man, Arnold Coston, 21, was treated at UC San Diego Medical Center 
for a gunshot wound in the groin and released Friday afternoon, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The third victim, Kendall Gault, 22, drove himself to Balboa Naval Hospital 
after the shooting and was treated for a gunshot wound in the leg, said Lt. 
George Saldamando of the police gang unit. Before he was released from the 
hospital, San Diego police arrested Gault for his alleged part in the shooting, 
Saldamando said. 
</P>
<P>
The Naval Intelligence Service arrested Robert Johnston, 21, and Derick 
Robinson, 18, at the 32nd Street Naval base Friday in connection with the 
incident. The NIS is working with the gang unit because of the number of 
sailors involved in the shooting, Saldamando said. 
</P>
<P>
The police gang unit was called in to investigate because it was first believed 
that the shooting was gang related, Saldamando said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting began about 9:30 p.m. in the parking lot of Church's Fried 
Chicken, Saldamando said. About half an hour earlier, a man in the 
drive-through line backed up and hit the car behind him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The occupants of the rear car, all sailors, reportedly got out and began 
yelling at the man. One seaman punched the man in the mouth, Saldamando said. A 
group of bystanders, also Navy personnel, then intervened, telling the sailors 
to leave the man alone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The first group of sailors got back into their car, saying they would return, 
said Saldamando. The man who had originally backed into their car drove off. 
Police are looking for him for questioning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The first group of sailors later returned to the restaurant, and a fight broke 
out, Saldamando said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston reportedly produced a gun, but fell to the ground during the scuffle, 
Saldamando said. Gault then retrieved the pistol, firing several rounds into 
the crowd, Saldamando said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who also had a gun, fired twice into the crowd, Saldamando said. When 
police arrived, they retrieved two shotguns with folding stocks and two 
9-millimeter handguns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston was booked into County Jail downtown on suspicion of assault with a 
deadly weapon. Robinson was booked on suspicion of shooting at an occupied car, 
and Gault was booked on suspicion of two counts of assault with a deadly 
weapon, Saldamando said. 
</P>
<P>
The gang unit on Friday was still interviewing more than 20 people who 
witnessed the shooting, he said.

RESIGNING FEDERAL JUDGE IRVING TO HELP FORMER LAW PARTNER'S SAN DIEGO FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving, who is resigning from the San Diego 
federal bench Jan. 1 over frustration with rigid sentencing guidelines, 
announced Friday that he will become affiliated with his former law partner's 
San Diego law firm. 
</P>
<P>
Irving, 55, considered one of San Diego's finest trial lawyers before his 
appointment to the federal bench in 1982, said he does not, however, plan to 
return to the practice of law. He said he wants to help lawyers settle complex 
civil lawsuits already in the court system, and to mediate disputes before they 
blossom into suits. 
</P>
<P>
Since announcing Sept. 26 that he will be the first judge in the nation to 
leave the bench because of the guidelines, Irving, who also earned a reputation 
as one of the most able federal judges in California, has been wooed by law 
firms from around the state. 
</P>
<P>
But he said Friday that he simply felt most comfortable with his former 
partner, Douglas M. Butz, whose San Diego firm -- Butz, Lucas, Dunn &amp; 
Enright -- specializes in the defense of civil lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like going home," Irving said in an interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he said, "I felt I'd be a lot more comfortable over there, in that 
setting, that my comfort level will be much higher. I want to feel my way, to 
see what I want to do. I know I want to mediate (disputes), but, beyond that, I 
want to see what I want to do. This way there's no pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Butz, who practiced law with Irving for several years before Irving took the 
bench, said Irving will not be a partner in the law firm but will be associated 
with it, with the title "of counsel." Irving will not be contributing earnings 
to the firm, Butz said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many reasons to want to be associated with someone like (Irving) 
that have nothing to do with economics," Butz said. "He has been extremely 
influential in my development as a lawyer and as a person, and I owe him so 
much. It's just wonderful to have him come back." 
</P>
<P>
From 1963 until 1982, Irving ran a private practice in San Diego, specializing 
in legal and medical malpractice defense. Butz joined him in 1974, and they 
worked together for eight years, until President Reagan appointed Irving to the 
federal bench. 
</P>
<P>
Irving, however, said in September that he was giving up a federal judge's 
lifetime tenure because he considers the sentencing guidelines unfair, 
especially the mandatory lengthy sentences the rules impose on first-time drug 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
The rules, which took effect in November, 1987, use a point system -- based 
mainly on the severity of the crime -- to determine sentencing. Neither a 
criminal's background, role in the crime, past record, nor remorse can be used 
to reduce the sentence below the minimum guideline. 
</P>
<P>
Based upon the idea that prison is designed to punish, not rehabilitate, the 
guidelines sharply reduce a judge's discretion in sentencing convicted 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Irving's impending departure already has made a significant impact at the San 
Diego federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Besieged by drug cases, many stemming from arrests at the U.S.-Mexico border, 
the court already had been short one full-time judge for several months before 
Irving's Sept. 26 announcement. Upon the notice of his resignation, he 
immediately stopped taking new civil or criminal cases, so five full-time 
judges have been doing the work of seven. 
</P>
<P>
During his eight years on the bench, Irving has drawn a significant number of 
high-profile cases. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, he presided over the trial last summer of Richard T. Silberman, 
a one-time governor's aide and wealthy San Diego financier who was convicted of 
one felony count and later pleaded guilty to another in connection with a 
money-laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego native, Irving went to college and law school at the University of 
Southern California. He is a graduate of Point Loma High School.

EL CAMINO DEFEATS ORANGE COAST, 23-20 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Camino scored two touchdowns in the last seven minutes for a 23-20 victory 
over Orange Coast in the Orange County Bowl at LeBard Stadium Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast's Mike Wade missed a 36-yard field goal with 54 seconds left in 
the game that could have tied the score. The loss was a heartbreaker for the 
fourth-ranked Pirates (8-3), who had not made a bowl appearance since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino (9-2) will lay claim to the state championship after No. 2 Taft upset 
No. 1 Bakersfield, 34-30, in the Potato Bowl at Bakersfield on Saturday. The 
third-ranked Warriors beat Taft early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino started slowly after a three-week layoff. The Warriors gained only 64 
yards in the first quarter and quarterback Rod Harvey threw two interceptions 
in the first 10 minutes of the game. He finished with 17 completions in 26 
attempts for 200 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Anthony Daigle was named player of the game after rushing for 163 
yards in 23 carries and scoring a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey's second interception was a costly one. He threw it right in the hands 
of Orange Coast defensive back Terrence Branley, who returned the ball six 
yards to the El Camino one-yard line. Pirate quarterback Greg Angelovic scored 
the touchdown on a one-yard run with 3:47 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Perez kicked a 40-yard field goal to cut the Pirates' lead to 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
Daigle set up El Camino's first touchdown with a 52-yard run. Fullback Tony 
DaCosta scored four plays later on a three-yard run. That gave El Camino a 10-7 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast regained the lead with 1:24 left in the third quarter when 
Angelovic connected with tight end Derek Whidden for a seven-yard touchdown 
pass. That gave the Pirates a 13-10 lead after they missed the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors made two costly turnovers in the fourth quarter. First Daigle 
fumbled at the Orange Coast one-yard line, then Anthony Cole fumbled a punt 
which the Pirates recovered at the El Camino 35. Angelovic threw a 35-yard 
touchdown pass to Whidden on the first play for a 20-10 Orange Coast lead with 
9:07 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino rallied with a 69-yard drive that was capped by Harvey's 10-yard 
touchdown pass to Bryan Reeves. That cut the Pirates' lead to 20-16 after a 
two-point conversion attempt failed. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors scored the winning touchdown with 2:29 left. Reeves' 23-yard run 
from the El Camino 46 set up Daigle's one-yard touchdown run.

THE SHORT STORIES OF JACK LONDON; THE AUTHORIZED EDITION WITH DEFINITIVE 
TEXTSSELECTED BY EARLE LABOR, ROBERT C. LEITZ III, I. MILO SHEPARD (MACMILLAN: 
$35; 832 PP.); 
</P>
<P>
THE CALL OF THE WILD BY JACK LONDON INTRODUCTION BY E. L. DOCTOROW (THE LIBRARY 
OF AMERICA: $8.50, PAPER; 102 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Roper, Roper's most recent novel is Mexico Days (Grove Weidenfeld); a 
book about a French woman mountain-climber. In Caverns of Blue Ice, is due out 
next spring from Sierra Club/Little, Brown. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack London used to like to eat raw-meat sandwiches, and he sometimes fancied 
himself a "blood beast" rampaging through life, point man for the fittest and 
whitest race around. 
</P>
<P>
Those and other popular intellectual currents of the 19th Century all found 
their way to Jack; our literature's most astonishing autodidact, he truly 
contained multitudes, and one finds reflected in his stories every tendency and 
big idea, each clever scheme and heavy lumbering system. He was a Marxist, a 
democratic socialist, a Darwinian, a Spencerian, even a Nietschean; toward the 
end of his life, we find him avidly studying the recently translated works of 
Jung, whose notion of a collective unconscious Jack had anticipated in several 
stories. A fanatic reader from an early age, London could swallow whole 
libraries at a single gulp. As he claimed later in life, "I always could read 
and write, and have no recollection antedating such a condition." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe for this reason, his best work reads like the products of a lonely, 
word-crazed boy of about 12, who, unaccountably, finds himself possessed of the 
verbal resources of an authentic narrative genius. 
</P>
<P>
Stories such as "Love of Life," in which a lost miner starves to death inch by 
inch, or "In a Far Country," another tale of starvation and madness, or the 
famous "To Build a Fire," the most widely published short story in world 
literature, are inexpressibly lurid, almost unbearably raw and powerful. The 
12-year-old boy in London is the same one in you, or in me, who liked to see 
how the bad guy got it in the end, the precise look on his face as the spear 
point tore into his guts, the way he staggered those final bloody steps. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that there is an obsession, an unhealthy fascination, with 
the gory and the awful. On the contrary, one comes away from the best of 
London's stories feeling peaceful and cleansed, subdued and transfigured. The 
best of the best, such as "The Law of Life," "Moon-Face" and (a personal 
favorite) "All Gold Canyon," which tells the story of a whiskery, Gabby 
Hayes-type placer miner, succeed in the classic manner, through strict economy 
of means, intensity of feeling, and absolute fidelity to the tale-telling 
contract. Not a word or a sensation is wasted, yet the whole world seems 
implicated in the brief ramble across the narrowed field. 
</P>
<P>
As a native son of California, Jack was well positioned to partake of the 
Klondike gold rush. He hurried north, did his best to get rich, lost 
everything, and got decently rich in the end anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska in winter made him as a writer: The Klondike was where the "cold of 
space smote the unprotected tip of the planet, and he, being on that 
unprotected tip, received the full force of the blow." He awoke: He assumed, in 
the clarity of the frozen moment, the mantle of his full powers. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Call of the Wild," Alaska functions as testing ground, as pitiless 
destroyer, as geographic and meteorological answer to everything sappy and 
sentimental in man (and dog). There is a gleeful embrace of the very conditions 
of dire peril, of the stark terms of the contract between sentient being and 
indifferent universe. Again, only a 12-year-old, only the part of one's 
consciousness that remains eternally young, can get solidly behind this idea of 
life as harsh and thrilling "test," as opportunity to regress, to become "The 
Dominant Primordial Beast" (title of Chapter III). Buck, the dog-hero of "Call 
of the Wild," does manage to regress, entirely and remorselessly, and this 
devolution is his glory, as well as our great joy as readers. 
</P>
<P>
Like Robert Louis Stevenson, whom he resembles in other respects (narrative 
energy, verbal color, love of the lurid, the bizarre), London seems to have 
"stumbled" onto a tale with profound mythic echoes, just as Stevenson merely 
"stumbled" on the mythic, multileveled "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde." But certain 
authors put themselves in the path of such happy, classic accidents, and 
London, like Stevenson, was a writer of extreme sensitivity, alert to spiritual 
and emotional vibrations as well as to the promptings of his unconscious. All 
his life he was troubled by horrifying, astonishing dreams, and while he often 
seems a tub-thumping materialist, concerned only with the workings of cold, 
inexorable law, the rest of existence seeps willy-nilly into the background of 
his stories, filling the shadows with uncanny shapes. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Red One," a story he wrote when he was already dying, he had this to 
say about Bassett, a scientist captured by Solomon Islands head-hunters: "But 
(his) relapses grew more frequent, his brief convalescences less and less 
vigorous . . . until he came to know, beyond the last promptings of the 
optimism inherent in so tremendous a constitution . . . that he would never 
live to cross the grasslands. 
</P>
<P>
"Ngurn (the tribal shaman) made pilgrimage personally and gathered the smoke 
materials for the curing of Bassett's head, and to him made proud announcement 
and exhibition of the artistic perfectness of his intention when Bassett should 
be dead." 
</P>
<P>
And in "The Water Baby," written only three weeks before his death (of uremic 
poisoning, hastened by self-administered doses of morphine, atropine and 
arsenic-based patent medicines): "As I grow old I seek less for the truth from 
without me, and find more of the truth from within me. . . . Dreams go deep, 
all the way down, maybe to before the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps his true spirit, his identity as Peerless Poet of the Frozen North, 
can be sensed in this passage from "To the Man on the Trail," to which no 
self-respecting boy of 12 could help but respond: "Standing six foot two or 
three, with proportionate breadth of shoulders . . . he seemed, of a verity, 
the Frost King, just stepped in out of the night. Clasped outside his Mackinaw 
jacket, a beaded belt held two large Colt's revolvers and a hunting-knife, 
while he carried, in addition to the inevitable dogwhip, a smokeless rifle of 
the largest bore and latest pattern." 
</P>
<P>
Inevitable dogwhip, indeed. May he roam forever in the Klondike of our hearts, 
he of the numberless stories, the fierce embrace of all of harsh existence. 
Give his stories to your sons and daughters, and for strong pleasure, read him 
again yourself.

PASTURES OF PLENTY; A SELF-PORTRAIT BY WOODY GUTHRIE, EDITED BY DAVE MARSH AND 
HAROLD LEVENTHAL (HARPER COLLINS: $29.95; 288 PP., ILLUSTRATED) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Grover Lewis, Lewis, a Santa Monica-based journalist, was born in Texas in 
the period of the Dust Bowl storms of the 1930s. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a time when even the most generous spirits among us have begun to grumble 
aloud about having "homeless fatigue," it's a great pleasure to heft this 
handsome, substantial and valuable book. 
</P>
<P>
Doubtless, "Pastures of Plenty" will hold small appeal for yuppies, 
anti-semantic deconstructionists or other elements of the post-modernist mob -- 
not to mention political reactionaries who probably will always regard Woody 
Guthrie as a "red" enemy. But anyone broadly interested in American music or 
radical politics or recent U.S. life and history will welcome Guthrie's 
hitherto-uncollected writings with open mind and arms. 
</P>
<P>
The collection -- assembled by Guthrie's longtime manager Harold Leventhal and 
rock writer Dave Marsh -- comprises stories, poems, songs, letters, diary 
entries, essays, drawings and photographs, most of which never have been 
published. The selections range from the text of the first song Guthrie ever 
wrote ("Old Gray Team Horses," ca. 1936) to his last coherent notes before 
succumbing to the mind-destroying hereditary disease, Huntington's chorea, 
which claimed his life in 1967 after 13 years of horror and misery in a 
succession of East Coast public hospitals. As detailed in Joe Klein's fine and 
compassionate biography of a decade ago, Guthrie's career as a radical 
singer-songwriter and literary man spanned fewer than 20 years -- from the 
mid-1930s to the early 1950s. He was a mere 37 when his health broke and he 
lost the ability to create. 
</P>
<P>
Guthrie sprang from the raw frontier of Oklahoma and somehow survived the 
harrowing disintegration of his family after his mother was stricken with the 
same disease that would eventually claim him. Drifting to California during the 
Depression as part of the Okie diaspora of the Dust Bowl years, he sang 
"hillbilly" songs in the Jimmie Rodgers-Carter Family vein on Los Angeles radio 
station KFVD until he began to comprehend the plight of his fellow Okies in 
Southern California's migrant labor camps and strike-embattled fruit orchards. 
In a sketch written in 1947, he recalls: 
</P>
<P>
"I sung songs for the cotton pickers and cotton strikers, and for migratory 
workers, packers, canning-house workers, fruit pickers, and all sorts of other 
country and city workers. I wrote a daily article for the People's Daily World, 
called 'Woody Says.' I always read the radical papers over my program and took 
sides with the workers all I knew how. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I hated the false-front decay and rot of California's fascistic oil and gas 
deals, the ptomaine poison and brass knucks in the jails and prisons, the 
dumped oranges and peaches and grapes rotting and runing down into little 
streams of creosote-poisoned juices. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the hundreds of thousands of stranded, broke, hungry, idle, miserable 
people that lined the highways all out through the leaves and underbrush. I 
heard these people sing in their jungle camps and in their Federal Work Camps 
and sang songs I made up for them. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"I ain't a writer," Guthrie claimed with characteristic underdog modesty in 
1941. "I'm just a little one-cylinder guitar picker." In the same vein, he 
signed many of his letters, "True as the average." But the father of the 
American folk-music movement never wrote un-truer words. From young manhood 
onward, Guthrie showed every sign of being a special, one-of-a-kind person with 
talent bursting out in every direction. 
</P>
<P>
Among his 1,000-plus songs, the "Dust Bowl Ballads" of 1940, plus the later 
Grand Coulee Dam song series, along with the achingly mournful postwar ballad 
"Deportees (Plane Crash at Los Gatos)," assure him immortality in our national 
song bag. "This Land Is Your Land" -- by now as ubiquitous as Frank Capra's 
film "It's a Wonderful Life" at yuletide -- has been seriously urged as a 
second, or new, national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
As a "self-portrait," "Pastures of Plenty" sets forth a less romanticized 
version of Guthrie's 1943 autobiographical novel, "Bound for Glory," as well as 
offering accounts of his World War II and postwar experiences. The collection, 
it seems to me, serves two important purposes. First, it confirms the 
raspy-voiced little Oklahoman as a powerful literary figure whose best writing 
doesn't need analysis, just praise. What an author like James Agee, say, 
achieved from the point of view of a middle-class, radicalized intellectual of 
the Popular Front period, Guthrie accomplished as a largely self-schooled -- 
and authentically broke and sometimes homeless -- member of the working class. 
</P>
<P>
The book's second achievement is that it shows persuasively that Guthrie was a 
patriot and a fairly solid citizen as opposed to a "subversive" hobgoblin. 
True, Guthrie's life was far from tidy, and he certainly performed at "red" 
functions and wrote for "un-American" publications -- but he also served as a 
seaman on three ships that were sunk by Nazi torpedoes during the European war. 
</P>
<P>
In philosophic outlook, Guthrie was more a Wobbly unionist than a Communist -- 
anti-fat cat to the teeth, without any dialectical trimmings. Just as he rose 
above his raising in matters of race, he hated injustice in all its myriad 
varieties. 
</P>
<P>
My hunch is that he never joined the American Communist Party, probably much to 
the Party's relief. Who, after all, would have "disciplined" such a wild hair? 
As Guthrie wrote in a letter to Alan Lomax: "I don't care what they call me. I 
ain't a member of any earthly organization. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In our morally shabby age, when even the term "liberal" has been blackened by 
the right-wing fat cats of our ruling class, it occurs to me that perhaps we 
need a little more grit in our diet. "Pastures of Plenty" offers up a homely 
but filling bill-of-fare of firebrand dissent, and re-acquaints us with one of 
the most glorious and uniquely American voices of the century. 
</P>
<P>
However brief and thwarted his life, Woody Guthrie believed in a goal -- a 
dream, an ideal -- outside himself. Would to the heavens that today's homeless 
had such a champion.

STRIPPING THE MASK FROM UNCLE HO; 
</P>
<P>
CRUEL APRIL BY OLIVIER TODD (W. W. NORTON: $24.95; 451 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By William Shawcross, Shawcross is a journalist who has covered Southeast Asia 
for various American and British publications. His latest books are Dubcek 
(Simon &amp; Schuster) and The Shah's Last Ride (Simon &amp; Schuster). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The capture of a city can cast a shadow over an epoch. The sack of Corinth, the 
fall of Rome, the taking of Berlin -- all marked ends of eras or empires. But 
to French journalist Olivier Todd, America's retreat from Saigon looks very 
different from the "moral triumph" he observed in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
In this important and provocative book -- a racy, episodic account of Saigon's 
fall -- Todd admits that he may have fallen victim to "the totalitarian 
temptation" during the war. "I had at any rate (campaigned) to establish a 
regime in Saigon that I condemned in Prague or Budapest. . . . We did not think 
of Uncle Ho as the Holy Ghost, but Thieu was Lucifer. We were dreaming, you 
see, of 'socialism with a human face' in southern Asia." 
</P>
<P>
For Todd, the mask slipped on a visit in 1973 to the communist zone of South 
Vietnam. The Provisional Revolutionary Government (PRG), which he had seen as 
"a movement of national liberation," as communist propaganda portrayed it, 
turned out to be "the secular and ideological arm of the communist government 
in Hanoi." 
</P>
<P>
Todd points out that personal chronicles, never pure or incorrupt, are bound to 
be selective, for "events are not altogether reducible to words." But he makes 
a fine selection of documents, diaries, interviews, letters, broadcasts, 
dispatches -- even classified ads -- to re-create the atmosphere in Vietnam and 
Washington as North Vietnamese tanks rushed toward Saigon in early 1975. His 
evocation of the cruel and impoverished purity of the North -- its "monolithic 
will, demented obstinacy" -- is compelling, especially set against the chaotic 
uncertainties of the South. 
</P>
<P>
Todd is unsympathetic toward President Gerald Ford, who, he writes, kept a cool 
distance from the melee: "When Ford speaks, on television and after banquets, 
it feels as if music is blurring his remarks, a medley of religious hymns and 
department-store elevator music." Ford's advisers anxiously insulate him from 
the collapse of Vietnam and try instead to taint Henry Kissinger with the stain 
of failure. Kissinger, in turn, tries to shift the blame from himself to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
To Kissinger, indeed, Todd is kinder. He suggests that it was Kissinger more 
than anyone else who argued to the end that the South Vietnamese should not be 
denied the arms with which to defend themselves. Of course, there were those, 
including perceptive CIA analyst Frank Snepp, who believed that the South 
Vietnamese army had quite enough ammunition but had lost the will to use it to 
defend the country. 
</P>
<P>
The concern of the South Vietnamese about the northerner's brutality was 
palpable nevertheless. Describing the chaotic rout of the South Vietnamese 
troops in the Central Highlands and the awful flight of the refugees who 
followed them, Todd asks: "Why are they fleeing? They're afraid. They dread 
socialist discipline." And socialist murder, too. In 1968, the Communists had 
briefly taken the old imperial capital, Hue, and when they were driven out, the 
Americans and South Vietnamese had found "charnel houses" where people had been 
murdered by the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
The Saigon regime had made no provision for refugees; there was mayhem as 
soldiers and civilians fled the advance of northern infantry and tanks, which 
appeared invincible. 
</P>
<P>
When Thieu was compelled by his allies to sign the Paris Peace Agreement, 
Richard Nixon had written him reassuring letters in which he promised the 
toughest response to any North Vietnamese violations. Thieu had taken this 
literally and expected the return of the B-52s in the event of any real threat. 
Now, however, he had to be content with much milder letters from Ford, 
bemoaning the fact that the North Vietnamese had clearly abrogated the 
agreement by force, but not promising to do anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
After the Central Highlands, the Communists rolled the map of South Vietnam all 
the way down to Saigon. No one dared to speculate on what their final 
intentions were; everyone hoped that they would still negotiate a compromise 
and allow a coalition, or at least a staged and dignified American withdrawal. 
Right until the end, some hoped that there could still be an independent, or 
even an autonmous, federated South Vietnam, ruled by the PRG. 
</P>
<P>
The North's inexorable march on Saigon led to the panicked and humiliating 
flight of Americans and some Vietnamese from the U.S. Embassy. Then, as silence 
fell in the months ahead, came the brutal (and ultimately ineffectual) attempt 
to impose communism on the South. Gone was all pretense at reconciliation with 
a separate southern entity. In its place came cruel and incompetent domination 
by Hanoi. Within three years, there were gulags all over South Vietnam; the 
boat people came flooding out to sea, and they never stopped. Still, today, 
poor Vietnamese from both north and south prefer to languish in awful camps in 
Southeast Asia rather than return to the greater awfulness of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Todd blames us writers for not paying enough attention to the crimes of the 
north. "In the west, they glorified the communist war effort. They played down 
communist massacres, especially those in Hue in 1968, or tortures or executions 
in the villages." 
</P>
<P>
Todd despairs of Western intellectuals: "They said the Republic of South 
Vietnam was a dictatorship." In the south there was a press, a parliament, a 
judicial system, all imperfect but infinitely superior to anything in the 
north. There was no national uprising in the south as the north came in; it was 
toward Saigon, not away from it, that the refugees fled. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, Todd is too gloomy. Writing before the fall of East European 
communism in 1989, he observes that "recent history, especially in unified 
Vietnam, proves that no communist regime ceases being communist, or 
democratizes itself, except by temporary fits and starts, with or without 
glasnost." Now that communism is everywhere dead or dying, however, China and 
its erstwhile enemy Vietnam are moving into an uneasy embrace to afford mutual 
support to their ramshackle systems. 
</P>
<P>
Todd says that a revisionist history of the war in Vietnam is essential to 
dispel the disinformation of that time. He makes the point that South 
Vietnamese resistance was not useless. "Without it, a number of countries in 
Southeast Asia, among them Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, would not have had 
time to develop economically and to reduce the chances of a communist 
takeover." 
</P>
<P>
That may well be true, but the cost for all Indochina has been utterly 
appalling. While the rest of Southeast Asia has prospered, Vietnam, Cambodia 
and Laos have been sunk for the last 16 years in poverty, mass murder and 
totalitarian despair. Communism has been an unmitigated disaster without any 
redeeming feature. 
</P>
<P>
Todd's hope is that "Cruel April" will lead people to question their own 
attitudes to the Vietnam War. "Who can flatter himself that his conscience is 
perfectly clear? . . . There were anti-Americans everywhere. . . . European 
democrats forgot about Vietnamese democrats. There were no fascists in South 
Vietnam. Did the West think any deeper than European cliches about the Saigon 
regime, a semi-democracy?" 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, but not enough. Todd's challenge is important. Many of us who wrote 
about Indochina during the war failed to extend to Hanoi and its allies the 
same rigorous criticism we imposed on Saigon. It is shaming.

BEGINNING THE WORLD AGAIN by Roberta Silman (Viking: $19.95; 416 pp.). Imagine 
the secret, cloistered world of scientists and their families in Los Alamos, 
New Mexico, working to create the first atomic bomb as World War II rages in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
This is the territory Roberta Stilman attempts to penetrate through the 
fictional eyes of Lily Fialka, one of the women on "the Hill." Although there 
are appearances by historical personalities including Robert Oppenheimer, 
Enrico Fermi, even Churchill and Roosevelt, Silman's true focus is on the wives 
of the scientists and their day-to-day lives in this tense, close-knit 
community. The writing has the intimacy of a diary and can be quite moving. But 
with so many accounts of the Manhattan Project written by the real physicists 
who participated -- and who lived to regret their contributions -- one doubts 
the relevance of these imagined characters, their ambivalent struggles, love 
affairs and reconciliations. Sonia Pilcer

IRON JOHN: A Book About Men by Robert Bly (Addison-Wesley: $18.95; 237 pp.). 
Less tough and introverted, more sensitive and thoughtful than their 
counterparts from the '50s and '60s, young men today would seem to have 
everything going for them. 
</P>
<P>
But while moderating encounter groups across the country, poet Robert Bly saw 
many break down into tears "within five minutes." In this sharp and sympathetic 
study of social identity, Bly traces the roots of that grief to a father-son 
rift that began when the Industrial Revolution placed sons in compulsory 
schools, leading them to view dad only through the critical eyes of their 
female teachers. As an alternative to the tarnished images of manhood that 
continue to pervade the culture (e.g., the CIA agent of the '60s or the TV dad 
of the '80s who "never knows what cold medicine to take"), Bly offers the model 
of the Wild Man. Unfortunately, while this "Zen priest . . . (who) resonates to 
hills, clouds and ocean" has inspired "gatherings" in woodsy locales from coast 
to coast, here he appears to be little more than a New Age superman, an image 
too idealized to help men make the difficult decision between trusting their 
primitive instincts and reining them in with the civilized mind. Alex Raksin

DON JUAN IN THE VILLAGE by Jane DeLynn (Pantheon Books: $18.95; 240 pp.). In 
her last novel, "Real Estate," Jane DeLynn turned 1980s avarice and ambition 
into grand buffo. 
</P>
<P>
Now this most acute and dry-eyed chronicler of urban psychic waste offers "Don 
Juan in the Village," a devastating portrait of sexual conundrum, told in 13 
stories about a gay female writer. Pickups are the litmus test of her 
attractiveness and the antidote to her loneliness. She frequents local watering 
holes, exotic clubs in Ibiza, Morocco and Padova; on good nights, the scenes 
move to someone's bed. DeLynn gives us graphic descriptions of women's bars, 
the etiquette, the desperate couplings after last call, and the often 
humiliating sex. The voice is aggressive first-person, full of urgency and 
self-derision, and unflinchingly honest. One wants to turn away and join the 
"normals," as the narrator calls the straight, coupled world. But we are drawn 
by her driving need for human connection. I was reminded of the Yeats line: 
"The tragedy of sexual intercourse is the perpetual virginity of the soul." 
"Don Juan" fascinates as it repels, and finally, it is terribly moving. Sonia 
Pilcer

TUTURANI: A Political Journey in the Pacific Islands by Scott L. Malcolmson 
(Simon &amp; Schuster: $19.95; 267 pp.). "I had the feeling of facing too many 
symbols at once, too many histories that could never be made to add up." 
</P>
<P>
Village Voice editor Scott Malcolmson wears his confusion as a badge of pride, 
a sign that he is on to "a new way of travel writing, of foreign journalism, of 
anthropology," having avoided the arrogant, white-male way of thinking that has 
colonized people in the Pacific much as it has simplistically categorized them 
on paper. But his incomprehension may just as well be a sign that he is hopping 
too quickly among these nine island territories and semi-sovereign states to 
get a handle on their politics or culture. Significant events often are 
mentioned only in passing (as when the president of Palau commits suicide in 
the middle of one narrative) and explanations, when offered, are overly 
cautious: The islands "are gradually being destabilized by experience." 
Malcolmson is gifted with a rare ability to make exotic settings seem 
immediate, but his reluctance to probe the social and political roots of his 
islanders' frustrations ironically leads him to support the very colonial power 
structures he initially deplores. Alex Raksin

<P>
THE HOUSE OF BARRYMORE BY MARGOT PETERS (KNOPF: $29.95; 640 PP., ILLUSTRATED) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sheila Benson, Benson is The Times' film critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the very last days of her life, Ethel Barrymore, at 79, was weak but still 
receiving visits from old friends in her bedroom, banked with pink carnations. 
One, distressed at her frailty and not sure she was even listening, made 
conversation: " 'And you know,' he concluded, 'Bette Davis and Gary Merrill are 
touring in "The World of Carl Sandburg," reading his poetry.' The famous blue 
Barrymore eyes flew open. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Thanks for the warning,' she whispered." 
</P>
<P>
Quintessential Ethel. That's the woman so prodigiously revealed by Margot 
Peters in "The House of Barrymore," a masterful, pungent, essential evocation 
of the last comets of a great theatrical line. This is biography with the grip 
of a Le Carre novel; the most transporting saga and the most horrifying 
cautionary tale. 
</P>
<P>
Mingling the lines of theater legends, the Drews and the Barrymores -- Lionel, 
Ethel and John -- possessed wit, the highest standards of taste and an 
insider's view of the theater that was unsentimental and unsparing. Theater, 
silents, talkies, vaudeville, tent shows: You gave them your best. There's a 
vivid anecdote here of Stella Adler glimpsing a tall, straight figure at 
midnight in Pennsylvania Station: Ethel Barrymore in her 60s, returning from an 
out-of-town performance, lugging her suitcases, all alone. 
</P>
<P>
Acting aside, the Barrymores seemed, in one degree or another, to have all the 
talents -- for painting, sketching, composing, and wickedly memorable 
conversation. Together, they also had all the appetites -- for morphine, 
cocaine, alcohol, sex and the spotlight. Of the only film they made together, 
the overwrought "Rasputin and the Empress," Peters documents a fiendishly 
difficult trio: "Jack on drink, Lionel on drugs, Ethel on her high horse." 
</P>
<P>
All three were touched by the family curse, a susceptibility to alcohol and 
drug addiction which claimed 11 of their clan from John Drew Sr. to Diana 
Barrymore. They responded to it with an iron will, or no will at all. Ethel, at 
60, finally faced her alcoholism and stopped drinking, abruptly and forever. 
Lionel's use of morphine had most likely begun in 1925, to ease arthritic pain 
aggravated by a venereal disease that "responded to treatment." He could never 
stop. Jack's drinking dulled not one of his fears, nor did it diminish his 
self-hatred. When Peters closes her almost unbearable account of his last years 
by reporting that "the long suicide of Jack Barrymore was at last 
accomplished," the reader's relief is as profound as his. 
</P>
<P>
Peters is candid about these flaws, not sensationalistic; she simply documents 
them with the same eloquence she uses to illuminate the Barrymore magnetism 
onstage. She's persuasive in suggesting that Lionel, Ethel's "unlucky one," may 
have been the better actor of the brothers, although what came indecently 
easily to Jack was a torture to Lionel. It was Lionel who disappeared uncannily 
into a character; for all his intelligence and passion, Jack remained Jack. 
Lionel's real genius onstage is one of the book's revelations, certainly to 
movie audiences. He made more than 200 films, and in the process disinterest 
replaced fervor, reducing Lionel's acting -- with few startling exceptions -- 
to a collection of rumbling, crusty mannerisms. 
</P>
<P>
Jack, the artist, the lover, who built aeries and "Alchemist's Corners" to live 
in, was the trio's lecherous Little Prince. Indecently handsome, his Promethean 
self-indulgences came from deeply rooted self-hatred. The spectacle of Jack 
burning out his talent is the book's central tragedy; the wonder is that he 
lasted as long as he did. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was Ethel, passionately interested in music, books, painting, 
politics, boxing, people. Ethel, the darling of society, who was, in truth, a 
working girl with two good dresses, one black, one white, when she conquered 
London, and not incidentally young Winston Churchill; Ethel, lured by her 
proximity to society into a disastrous marriage to a millionaire's vacuous son. 
Called an "opalescent dream" at 16, she had found her style at 20 and reigned 
majestically as "First Lady of the American Theater" her life long. She would 
rather have been First Actress, but "Mrs. Patrick Campbell said that the 
greatest actresses have to have a bit of the gutter in them. Ethel never dipped 
a toe." 
</P>
<P>
Scrappy and remote with each other, at polar opposites politically, the 
Barrymores shared one thing in their reviews: the constant complaint that, 
Shakespeare aside, the First Family was too often abroad in inferior vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
If they'd conspired from childhood to thwart biographers -- and they very 
nearly did -- Lionel, Ethel and Jack hardly could have done a better job of it. 
As Peters notes, Barrymore history is tangled, distorted, falsified and just 
plain missing. Peters notes it; she doesn't whine about it, and she's able to 
untangle everything but the facts about the death of the older of Lionel's two 
daughters. Both girls died young, but not to pinpoint where or even when Mary 
died clearly rankles the scrupulous Peters. 
</P>
<P>
Lionel came by his reticence honestly. Their maternal grandmother Mummum 
(accent on the second mum), the steelly actress-manager Mrs. John Drew, was the 
most profound influence on the three, and her rule was that one's deepest 
feelings were never to be disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Mummum's nature denied her grandchildren warmth, approval and love and mortally 
wounded their ability to give it themselves. Firstborn Lionel, shy and 
self-deprecating, was secretive to the point of pathology. Ethel, so full of 
emotion onstage, seemed to have tragically little offstage: Her three children 
loved but feared her; she had a thousand friends but no intimates. Mercurial 
Jack, who so feared his own beautiful, feminine side, lived in snarling combat 
with each of his three wives and destructively neglectful of his daughter, 
Diana. 
</P>
<P>
To ride herd on three billowing Barrymore personalities at once requires the 
talents of Sherlock Holmes, Sigmund Freud and Mary Poppins. Or Margot Peters. 
Even as it chronicles waste and loss, her book shares the qualities of the 
noblest Barrymore: It has heart, wit, dedication and verve.

<P>
It seemed like such a good idea, Franklin Dennis thought at the time. The time 
was June, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis, a publicist for small publishing houses -- including Academy Chicago -- 
and a major fan of the late John Cheever, would gather up Cheever's uncollected 
stories, stories that had appeared in the New Yorker, Mademoiselle, Collier's 
and other magazines but had never been published in book form. 
</P>
<P>
Little did Dennis suspect that his brainstorm would turn into a lawsuit -- and 
that 3 1/2 years later, the lawsuit would make its way to the Illinois Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis, owner of a company here called Book Pro-Motions, had been an admirer of 
Cheever for about 20 years, "ever since I read the words 'the healing sound of 
rain' in the story 'Artemia, the Honest Well Digger.' " 
</P>
<P>
For a time, the Cheever family also thought Dennis' plan was a lovely idea. 
Mary W. Cheever, executor of her late husband's estate, accepted Dennis' 
proposal to have Academy Chicago, a small literary publisher, publish "The 
Uncollected Stories of John Cheever." Mary Cheever would be listed as author; 
Dennis as editor. They would split the $1500 advance -- an average figure, it 
turns out, by the standards of many small publishing houses. 
</P>
<P>
At Academy Chicago, co-owners Anita and Jordan Miller were ecstatic. By the end 
of 1987, Dennis and the Millers had uncovered 68 uncollected stories by 
Cheever. Dennis sent a list of the titles to Ben Cheever, the writer's oldest

<P>
Two weeks into the new year, Ben Cheever invited Dennis to meet him and his 
literary agent, Andrew Wylie, for a drink at the Algonquin Hotel. Wylie will 
not discuss the matter, but Dennis says Wylie urged Academy Chicago to bow out 
and announced he could get a six-figure advance for the Cheever project from 
almost any publisher in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Soon thereafter, Academy Chicago was contacted by Martin Garbus, a prominent 
New York attorney who handles many literary matters, and in this case, was 
representing Mrs. Cheever. Garbus was contending that Dennis had misrepresented 
himself to Mrs. Cheever, and that because "basically the original contract was 
fraudulent," the agreement was void. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Garbus said Dennis had never told Mrs. Cheever that he worked 
for Academy Chicago, from which he obtains a $400-per-month retainer as New 
York-based publicist. In a letter to the Millers, Garbus wrote, "Mr. Dennis and 
Academy are totally incapable of performing, and, indeed, have not performed 
their obligations pursuant to any such agreement." 
</P>
<P>
A legal seesaw has ensued, with the Cheever family suing the Millers in a New 
York court, and the Millers suing the Cheevers in Illinois. The New York judge 
ruled in favor the Cheevers, and temporarily stopped publication of the book 
pending the outcome of the contract dispute trial in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, Judge Roger Kiley found no fraud, but did maintain that Dennis had 
not told the Cheevers that Academy Chicago intended to publish all of Cheever's 
uncollected stories. He ordered Mrs. Cheever to deliver "no less" than 10 to 15 
stories, what he called the size of a "stereotypical" Cheever book. Later, he 
added a requirement of 140 pages, and granted Mrs. Cheever's request to publish 
the bulk of the stories elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"For us consumers of high-quality literary works," Kiley wrote, "we ask you 
both to step aside of your deeply felt differences and think of us and do the 
work." 
</P>
<P>
The Cheevers and the Millers fought over widths of margins, numbers of words, 
headnotes, introductions and spacing between lines. The Millers took their case 
to an Illinois appellate court, which issued a split decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Millers have spent about $325,000 in legal fees to date; the Cheevers 
considerably more. 
</P>
<P>
"We almost went bankrupt, because we were in the Cheever business and not in 
the publishing business," Anita Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The Millers had a less-than-10% chance of having their case accepted by the 
Illinois Supreme Court. They filed anyway. The case was accepted, and is 
expected to be heard this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome, damage has been done to both sides -- and probably to the 
Cheever story project, in whatever form, as well. Anita Miller calls this "a 
ridiculous case." In an interview with Chicago magazine, Ben Cheever called the 
prolonged literary contretemps "tragic, tragic in the sense that war is 
tragic." 
</P>
<P>
Martin Garbus, the Cheevers' lawyer, said the case should have been settled. 
"We tried," Garbus said. "The other side will tell you they tried." 
</P>
<P>
Anita Miller said that Academy Chicago has stuck with the case "because we're 
too stubborn to back off." Besides, she added, "If we gave up, it would almost 
have been an admission that we did something wrong. And we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Franklin Dennis said he feels battered. "I certainly wish that 
this had not taken this very unfortunate and almost tragic course," Dennis 
said. "It's really very sad, the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Franklin said, "I'm very pleased that I thought of the idea" of 
collecting Cheever's stories. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still a very good idea, in the abstract." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as Cheever's stories Ping-Pong from court to court, his personal 
journals have found a home at Harvard University's Houghton Library. Cheever 
first raised the possibility of housing his papers at Harvard when he visited 
the school to accept an honorary degree in 1978. Not long afterward, however, 
Cheever decided to sell the 30 volumes of typed, single-spaced pages containing 
detailed musings from throughout his adult life. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Dennis, curator of manuscripts in the Harvard College Library, explained 
that Cheever's papers contained "his responses to the landscape and the 
weather, interspersed with reflections on his inner life and his relationships 
with his wife and children and friends." Dennis said Cheever's journals also 
revealed his feelings about "sexual, family and other very personal matters." 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between Cheever and Harvard stopped with the author's death in 
1982. Six years later, Cheever's daughter Susan contacted the school to confirm 
Harvard's interest in the papers. Last spring, Mary Cheever accepted Harvard's 
offer of $10,000, drawn from an endowment established by a bequest from the 
poet Amy Lowell. The bulk of the journals will remain sealed until July, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis said the journals are likely to have an effect on other diarists. "Many 
people, reading Cheever's journals, will be discouraged from writing any more 
in their own journals," he said. "It's beautiful stuff."

<TEXT>
<P>
In Russia, history is politics. Today, as Russians struggle out of the Soviet 
period to the next stage in their history, each step demands judgments about 
(to rephrase Lenin) "What is to be undone?" Slavophile nationalists like 
Solzhenitsyn urge a return to Russia's pre-revolutionary historical course; 
Westernizers of the Sakharov school want to see her become a "normal" European 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Yet before they can move along either road, Walter Laqueur reminds us, Russians 
must exorcise the ghost of Stalin. Was Stalinism an inevitable consequence of 
Marxism? Of Lenin's elitist and authoritarian Bolshevism? Of the decision to 
force a Marxist revolution in Europe's most backward country rather than, as 
Marx had foreseen, in Germany or England? Of Russia's authoritarian, 
anti-democratic political culture? Or was Stalinism a historical accident, a 
factor of Stalin's own warped personality? But then how could one unbalanced 
individual redirect the history of a huge nation single-handedly? Were the 
Russians as a nation that gullible? Why was Stalin so genuinely popular? What 
does his legacy say about Russian political culture? 
</P>
<P>
Stalin thought he was leading a backward country to a glorious future; he now 
stands accused as the cause of all that holds Russia back. His ruthless forced 
collectivization destroyed the peasantry, and with it Soviet agriculture -- 
perhaps for good, at least for a long time to come. His frantic five-year plans 
left a rust-belt legacy of inefficient, antiquated industry which pollutes the 
"new cities" built from scratch by enthusiastic young Communists, poisoning the 
lives of the very grandchildren for whom they sacrificed so willingly. 
</P>
<P>
Stalin's "command-administrative system" and his institutionalized paranoia 
left Russian society without either the private initiative or the mutual trust 
needed to revitalize its economy and civil life. It was Stalin, as Commissar of 
Nationalities, who planted the seeds of today's ethnic strife through his 
centralizing/Russifying policies. And his purges cut down the flower of a 
generation, promoting young nonentities like Brezhnev, who prolonged Russia's 
stagnation by 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Those important new books by senior Sovietologists reevaluate Stalin in the 
light of newly available information. Robert C. Tucker's "Stalin in Power" is 
the second part of a projected three-volume psychobiography of the tyrant. 
"Stalin as a Revolutionary" (1974) traced his rise through 1929, when he 
defeated his Politburo rivals and concentrated power in his own hands. Volume 
two carries the story through the first five-year plan and forced 
collectivization, the murder of Kirov and the intensifying purges, and the 
growing rapprochement with Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker writes psychobiography with tact and common sense, never letting Freud 
get out of hand, while his narrative holds the reader in grim fascination. He 
diagnoses Stalin's mania as czarist rather than Oedipal. According to Stalin's 
internalized "hero script," he would equal Lenin's achievement by engineering a 
"second October," the building of socialism through rapid collectivization and 
industrialization. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, as Tucker meticulously demonstrates, Stalin's second revolution was 
a betrayal of Lenin's. It took its inspiration from the czarist tradition of 
autocratic, centralized state-building which began with Ivan The Terrible's 
great-grandfather, Grand Prince Ivan III of Moscovy. "It was a return to a 
state-sponsored revolution from above, aimed primarily at making Russia a 
mighty military-industrial power able to fend for itself in an unfriendly 
international setting and to expand its borders as opportunity allowed." 
</P>
<P>
Stalinism was "a blend of Bolshevik revolutionism with the Great Russian 
chauvinism that Lenin correctly perceived in him in 1922" -- a Russian 
chauvinism that was, of course, ironic in one who was not Russian at all and 
who, to the end of his life, spoke with a distinct Georgian accent. 
</P>
<P>
Stalin was neither the first nor the last colonial to overcompensate. His 
primary models were the two most autocratic "tsar-reformers" in Russian 
history. Though others have pointed out the importance for Stalin of Peter the 
Great and Ivan the Terrible (obvious to anyone who has seen Eisenstein's 
celebrated film), Tucker draws the parallels deftly. Peter provided Stalin's 
model for forced industrialization. In Ivan's destruction of the powerful boyar 
families and promotion from below for loyalty and talent, Stalin found a model 
for his own purge terror. Tucker notes that he even referred to his Politburo 
rivals with the archaic term "grandees" (velmozhi). Against Bolshevik 
tradition, but in line with Ivan's, he sought to eradicate not only his 
"enemies" but their entire family line as well. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker dubs the purges "the greatest murder mystery of the 20th Century." At 
their center lay a tragic irony: There was in fact a great anti-party 
conspiracy in the Kremlin, headed by none other than Stalin himself. Why the 
mania to extract confessions from his victims, not only those who starred in 
public show trials, but those who perished anonymously in NKVD cellars? 
"Stalin's vision of the double-dealers as active agents of a terrorist 
anti-party conspiracy derived from his own deep-seated subconscious tendency to 
project upon his enemies whatever was unacceptable, discordant in the idealized 
Stalin, in his own life and conduct, and punish them for it." Psychological 
repression translated to political repression. 
</P>
<P>
The costliest tragedy for Russia itself was Stalin's supreme miscalculation 
about Hitler. His script foresaw a long war in Europe between the Western 
democracies and the Axis powers. Russia would move in to broaden her influence 
and territory when both sides were exhausted. Tucker links Stalin's 
annihilation of his Old Bolshevik rivals, many of whom were Jewish, with both 
his Russian nationalism and his desire to placate Hitler. The man who saw 
imaginary domestic enemies everywhere was unable to believe the real danger 
from without. More afraid of an internal coup d'etat than of imminent German 
attack, he undermined all his earlier efforts by destroying the Red Army's 
officer corps in the 1937 purge, leaving the country nearly defenseless. 
</P>
<P>
Laqueur points out that military defeat forced the Germans to confront "the 
Hitler question" and put it behind them. It was Russia's tragedy that despite 
Stalin's bungling leadership, which caused huge, largely unnecessary loss of 
life, his countrymen won the war, thanking Stalin for their victory. The 
confrontation with the man and his legacy was postponed for more than a 
generation. Khrushchev's de-Stalinization was incomplete; the full truth about 
Stalin and his times began to flood the Soviet press only in 1988, 35 years 
after his death. 
</P>
<P>
"Stalin: The Glasnost Revelations" surveys this new information and the 
domestic debates about it. Glasnost has profoundly altered the work of 
Sovietologists: No longer reduced to sifting reams of repetitive drivel for 
clues, they now find themselves with too much of interest to read. Somehow, 
Laqueur has managed the task, and done so with high intelligence and a keen 
nose for sniffing out the significant in unlikely places. Though nothing 
revealed here substantially alters what has long been known, or hypothesized, 
in the West, there are intriguing new details that corroborate, amplify or 
illustrate the familiar story. 
</P>
<P>
Though these two books bring the reader closer to some answers, Stalin will 
retain his enigmatic fascination for many years, for he seems to have broken 
all of history's rules about psychologically unbalanced leaders. Tucker sums it 
up: "In this devastating and unspeakably tragic instance, the leader managed, 
at ghastly cost, to impose his skewed view of himself and the world, his belief 
system, upon his society. Not he but the country came to grief."Joseph Stalin 
in November, 1917.

'BROMIDES' FOR BLACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your review of Shelby Steele's "The Content of Our Character" (Sept. 30) was a 
disservice to your readers. You allow the author -- a specialist in fiction -- 
to be reviewed by another specialist in fiction (Charles Johnson), though the 
book itself concerns the black condition -- a complex question of economics, 
politics, history, psychology and other profoundly non-fictional matter. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not surprisingly, neither the review nor the book come to grips with 
the weighty issues but opt for bumper-sticker bromides. Other reviewers were 
more perceptive: A black feminist law professor dismantled Steele's tissue of 
distortions in a few brief paragraphs. Prof. Martin Kilson of Harvard made the 
point that Steele ignores the simple fact that farmers, defense contractors, 
students et al dip liberally into government coffers, while African-Americans 
are advised to go it alone; the former receive "subsidies," while blacks are 
scorned for receiving "welfare" (though poor whites have the most to lose if 
such programs are gutted); all of these funds are transfer payments from the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of Steele in certain circles raises important questions, 
particularly on the matter of class in the black community. You should 
seriously consider broadening the list of your acceptable reviewers, especially 
on African-American affairs; otherwise you run the risk of seriously 
misinforming your audience.

THE AGE OF MAGNIFICENCE: Memoirs of the Court of Louis XIV of the Duc de 
Saint-Simon Edited and translated by Ted Morgan (Paragon: $12.95). A key source 
for historians of the 17th Century and an influential work of literature, the 
"Memoirs" of Saint-Simon remain eminently readable. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1675, Louis de Rouvroy was only the second Duc de Saint-Simon, and his 
status as a relative parvenu made him ferociously protective of the privileges 
of his rank. Although he was one of the few courtiers shrewd enough to realize 
that the fantasy world of ceremony and etiquette Louis XIV had created at 
Versailles (where the privilege of holding the king's candlestick at bedtime 
was a coveted honor) was designed to emasculate the nobility politically, 
Saint-Simon was unable to resist its glittering appeal. This realization, 
coupled with his inability to reach the inner circle of royal favor, embittered 
him, and his gossipy reminiscences are often slanderous Ted Morgan's vivid 
translation captures the unique mixture of vitriol and elegance that 
characterizes the author's style. CHARLES SOLOMON

If you are a writer -- or, for that matter, a reader -- nothing is closer to 
you than the letters of the alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
Hence the title of this charming little volume. Each and every letter of our 
alphabet is given a tidy two pages. One shows earlier versions of the letter in 
languages like Greek, Etruscan and Phoenician. The other offers fun facts to 
know and tell, such as the nugget that O has not changed since the beginning of 
the alphabet, while U is our newest letter, not coming into general use until 
the 1600s. Bet you didn't know that. Kenneth Turan

TALES FROM MAGARITAVILLE By Jimmy Buffett (Fawcett: $9.95). Like his songs, 
Jimmy Buffett's short stories are lightweight, diverting and often funny. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the better stories are set in Heat Wave, a small town on Snake Bite 
Key. The pleasantly eccentric inhabitants of the fictional islet include Aurora 
and Bora Alice Porter, the twin sisters who run the local coffee shop, and 
writer/football coach Romeo Fleming, who keeps the eponymous iguana in "Off to 
See the Lizard." The wistful romances in "Take Another Road" and "Boomerang 
Love" suggest rum-soaked Tom Robbins stories, although Buffet lacks his flair 
for baroque traffic jams of adjectives. The weakest tales in the collection are 
the first-person narratives involving a singer-songwriter who bears a 
suspicious resemblance to Jimmy Buffet. The author's otherwise unpretentious 
style falters in these self-indulgent ego trips, and the stories sink into a 
morass of gurgling cutesiness. A good book to read on the plane en route to 
some sunny vacation spot -- in search of that missing salt shaker. CHARLES

THE BIG BOOK OF HELL By Matt Groening (Pantheon: $15.95). Before Bart Simpson 
became as ubiquitous as Snoopy, Matt Groening dispensed his irreverent humor in 
the weekly comic strip "Life in Hell," which he continues to draw. 
</P>
<P>
This anthology surveys the 10-year history of the strip, beginning with the 
first appearances of Binky, the alienated rabbit; Sheba, his girlfriend, and 
Bongo, his one-eared illegitimate son. Groening uses this unlikely cast to 
satirize contemporary American culture, from the pretensions of the performance 
art/poetry scene to the excesses of Reagan-era politics. (Bongo asks his 
father, "If you vote Republican, does that make an accomplice to their 
crimes?") In recent years, Akbar and Jeff, the identical entrepreneurs in 
fezzes, have taken over the strip, and their topsy-turvy gay love affair has 
become has become the crazed mirror of contemporary relationships. Charles

MONTREAL AIRPORT HEIST NETS $13.7 MILLION

Armed thieves ambushed a private plane as it taxied down a runway Saturday and 
fled with about $13.7 million in gold ingots and other valuables in one of 
Canada's largest robberies, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The pre-dawn heist at Dorval Airport outside Montreal was carried out by at 
least four men, including one armed with an assault rifle. 
</P>
<P>
They used a garbage truck to smash through a fence, then drove off with the 
loot in stolen vans, police said. The vans and the weapon were later found 
about 3 1/2 miles from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
The twin-engined jet plane, owned by Sky Services Inc. of Montreal, had been 
chartered by Brink's Canada Ltd. and was returning from a regular overnight run 
from New York via Ottawa and Toronto. It landed shortly before 4 a.m. local 
time and ran straight into the ambush. 
</P>
<P>
A masked thief carrying the rifle stayed on the ground while three others went 
inside the plane, Police Lt. Andrew Theodosis said. 
</P>
<P>
"They told the three people aboard -- a Brink's guard, the pilot and the 
co-pilot -- to keep looking straight ahead, not to turn back. Then they started 
unloading the cargo area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said no one was injured and no shots fired.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a major changing of the guard at the Vatican, Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, a 
patient and polyglot prelate who became one of the world's most traveled 
diplomats, retired Saturday as secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II immediately named another Italian, Archbishop Angelo Sodano, 
who had been Casaroli's deputy, as his successor, thereby assuring continuity 
of Vatican foreign policy and preserving geopolitical balance in the Curia. 
</P>
<P>
A Spanish cardinal and a French cardinal had been mentioned as candidates for 
secretary of state, the senior post in the Vatican hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
Casaroli, 76, is hailed at the Vatican as architect of the low-profile but 
relentless policy of backstage maneuvering that kept the Roman Catholic Church 
alive in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union during the anti-religion period at 
the height of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
A tailor's son from Piacenza near Milan who was told as a young priest that his 
supposedly delicate health would not allow him to travel abroad, Casaroli 
nevertheless enjoyed a distinguished career as a diplomat, traveling widely 
through the Communist capitals of Eastern Europe in the 1960s as envoy of Pope 
Paul VI.

For the last 11 years, Casaroli, a short, bespectacled man with an elfin grin, 
has been John Paul's chief of staff and spry fellow traveler on trips around 
the world. By tradition, the papal secretary of state is always a diplomat. But 
he is also, in effect, the prime minister of the Vatican directly under the 
Pope and administers the church in the interregnum between popes. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, Casaroli was instrumental in getting strong articles on human rights 
and religious freedom included in the Helsinki Accords eventually accepted by 
the Soviet Union and its East Bloc allies. Last month in Paris, again 
representing the Vatican, Casaroli was the only one of the 35 original Helsinki 
signatories to initial the follow-up document that wrote a formal end to the 
Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1979, by then already a Curia insider, Casaroli became John Paul's 
choice as secretary of state, seven months after his own election. Last year, 
Casaroli submitted his resignation at the mandatory retirement age of 75. The 
Pope asked him to stay on. 
</P>
<P>
In the astonishing interim, Catholicism has mushroomed in one Eastern European 
country after another in the wake of communism's collapse. Casaroli, who spent 
years intriguing to keep churches open and priests out of jail behind the Iron 
Curtain, was on hand to welcome Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev when he 
came to call on a Polish Pope. 
</P>
<P>
Sodano, the new secretary of state, is a 63-year-old native of the Piedmont 
region near Turin in northern Italy. He returned to the Vatican in 1988 to 
become director of foreign affairs in the secretariat of state after a long 
career in Europe and Latin America, climaxed by nearly a decade as papal nuncio 
in Chile, where the church became an outspoken opponent of dictator Augusto 
Pinochet.

ENGLISH CHANNEL: BRITISH AND FRENCH WORKERS KNOCK OUT A PASSAGE BIG ENOUGH TO 
WALK THROUGH, LINKING THE TWO SIDES OF THE 'CHUNNEL.'

<P>
Cheers erupted Saturday on both sides of the English Channel when British and 
French workers digging the Channel Tunnel finally met after knocking out a 
passage large enough to walk through and shake hands. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, for the first time, men can cross the channel underground," French 
President Francois Mitterrand said. "What a brilliant sign of the vitality of 
our two countries." 
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came in a 6-foot-tall service tunnel that will be used to 
maintain two rail tunnels still being bored. It marked a symbolic milestone in 
Europe's biggest engineering project. 
</P>
<P>
Using jackhammers, Graham Fagg, 42, of Dover, England, and Philippe Cozette, 
37, of Calais, France, knocked out the last foot of chalk to link up the 
British and French sides of the tunnel -- which has been dubbed a "chunnel." 
</P>
<P>
The smiling pair then clasped hands, embraced and exchanged their national 
flags. Workers in overalls looked on and applauded. 
</P>
<P>
"God save the queen!" cried French workers, uncorking Champagne bottles. 
</P>
<P>
"Vive la France!" came the reply from the British side. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's handshake came three years to the day after tunneling began at 
Sangatte, near Calais, and in Folkestone, England. 
</P>
<P>
The $16.7-billion Channel Tunnel will make it possible to travel from Paris to 
London by high-speed train in 3 1/2 hours when it opens in June, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The train trip through just the tunnel is expected to take 35 minutes, compared 
with 90 minutes to cross the channel by ferry. 
</P>
<P>
Fares for the undersea crossing have not been set. But experts say the charges 
may be at least double the 1986 projections of $46 per person in a car and $19 
per train passenger. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnelers have spent the last month drilling through the last 100 yards of 
chalk with giant American-built boring machines, trying to align the two 
halves. 
</P>
<P>
The British tunnelers actually linked up with the French on Oct. 29, when 
workers drilled a 2-inch hole through the chalk in a service tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
The connection ended Britain's island separation from continental Europe for 
the first time since the last Ice Age about 8,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Fagg and Cozette were chosen by draw from among the 3,000 workers to represent 
their countries in Saturday's meeting. After widening the passage from the size 
of a peephole to a window, they laid down their tools and shook hands. 
</P>
<P>
"Bonjour," boomed Fagg. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello," Cozette said, chuckling. 
</P>
<P>
Michel Delebarre and Malcolm Rifkind, the French and British transportation 
ministers, rode in small service trains down the maintenance tunnel to witness 
the handshake. 
</P>
<P>
Fagg and Rifkind rode on to Sangatte, while Cozette and Delebarre headed for 
Folkestone to join in celebrations that lasted into the night. 
</P>
<P>
Nine workers have been killed during the project. The cost has climbed from an 
initial estimate of $9.4 billion to $16.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel is viewed positively in France, where it is expected to revive 
economically depressed northern areas. But Britain has shown worry over the 
loss of its historic moat from the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
Many Britons fear drug traffickers or terrorists will invade their island via 
the tunnel.

FOR DESPERATE HOSTAGE RELATIVES, VISITING IRAQ HAS BECOME MATTER OF LIFE OR 
DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
CAPTIVES: DEFYING WASHINGTON, 14 WILL LEAVE FOR BAGHDAD IN HOPES OF GAINING THE 
RELEASE OF THEIR LOVED ONES.

<P>
During his 16 years as a Des Moines police officer, Tom Van Baale has put his 
life on the line for strangers many times. On Monday, he is taking a risk for a 
loved one: He is leaving for Iraq in hope of persuading President Saddam 
Hussein to release his father-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
Dawn Bazner, of Palm Desert, Calif., also is keenly aware of the perils of 
entering a potential war zone where her husband is being held hostage. "But if 
I don't go, and some of the women come back with their husbands, I don't know 
if I can live with the consequences of that decision," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The two are part of a delegation of 14 relatives of American hostages in Iraq 
who are accepting Hussein's invitation to visit their loved ones over the 
holidays. A second contingent of 30 relatives is poised to depart Dec. 19. 
Several dozen others may go later. 
</P>
<P>
For the family members, the visit is a life-or-death mission. "If I don't go, I 
may never see my husband again," Bazner says. 
</P>
<P>
Heart-rending as they may be, such ventures pose a serious problem for the Bush 
Administration. It regards the hostage family visits as counter to the national 
interest, yet it is reluctant to be too critical for fear that the issue could 
backfire on the White House. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration repeatedly has said that travel to Baghdad can be dangerous 
and that family members who go are being manipulated by Hussein, whose 
occasional releases of hostages are seen as blatant attempts to divide the 
international alliance against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official declined to comment on Monday's trip, 
saying, "We don't want to come across as being adversarial against any U.S. 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
But as more and more relatives prepare to ignore stated U.S. policy in an 
effort to save their loved ones, their increasing visibility could well make 
them a force to be reckoned with as the public debate escalates over President 
Bush's Persian Gulf policies. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not real happy with our government -- they're not doing anything to get 
our people out," says Willie Carr, 47, a Richland Hills, Tex., woman who was 
taken captive with her husband, Gary, when they were in northern Kuwait, where 
he was working on an oil rig. 
</P>
<P>
Like many foreign women and children in Iraq, Carr eventually was allowed to 
leave, but her husband is still a hostage of Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"The State Department should be glad we're getting some of them out," fumes one 
hostage's wife who asks that she not be identified. "It's just less for them to 
have to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
For many of the relatives, the decision to defy their own government was not 
made lightly. "Initially, my reaction was no, I would not go," says Bazner, 37. 
"But emissaries from most other countries have gone and have gotten people out. 
And I'd like to have my husband home and be with our children again. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I genuinely believe that going is the right thing to do," she says. "My 
husband's fully aware that his own government is not going to negotiate, and he 
accepts that as par for the course. And so if that means I have to go to 
Baghdad as my own peace emissary, then I will." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, not all the hostages have concurred with their relatives' decisions 
to go to Baghdad. "My husband is not too happy about my going," says one woman 
who asked that her name not be printed. "He's scared to death. They (the 
Iraqis) are so unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
At first, the woman went along with her husband's wishes, but eventually she 
decided to go to Baghdad despite his reservations. "This has been a very 
traumatic experience," she says. "It feels like you're grieving, but yet 
there's no death. You don't know quite how to act." 
</P>
<P>
For all the flurry about how many hostages Iraq has released during the last 
few weeks, hundreds of foreigners -- including more than 100 Americans -- are 
still being held as so-called human shields at strategic sites. Hussein says he 
is holding them to discourage attack by U.S.-led forces. As many as 2,000 more 
foreigners are believed to be trapped in Iraq and Kuwait, forbidden to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Bazner, 36, is being held at a military site. Like many other hostages, 
he has been allowed to call home with increasing frequency -- in his case to 
Palm Desert, where his parents have a house where his wife and children have 
been staying. 
</P>
<P>
The Bazners' own home is in Kuala Lumpur, where he is a restaurant executive. 
They and their two children were taken hostage Aug. 2, the day that Iraq 
invaded Kuwait, when the jetliner they were on stopped to refuel in Kuwait. She 
and the children left in a refugee airlift in September. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Barbara Smiley is more optimistic than worried. "I feel really 
positive about this trip," she says. "Good things have been happening, and we 
all hope more good things will happen when we get there." 
</P>
<P>
Edward Smiley, 42, arrived in Kuwait to begin a yearlong job as a database 
administrator just three days before the invasion. Since he was taken hostage, 
he has called his wife half a dozen times. 
</P>
<P>
"Edward is looking forward to my going very much," Barbara Smiley says. "He 
seems to be very positive. He said, 'I'm not gonna get my hopes up too much.' 
But he's been given these little hints that, because we are going, perhaps 
something may happen." 
</P>
<P>
At Thanksgiving Day dinner, the extended Smiley family saw Edward Smiley on 
television. "He looked thin and grayer -- and he's got a beard," his wife says. 
The worry and uncertainty of the last four months "have been like an empty hole 
in my stomach." 
</P>
<P>
As with nearly all the hostage families, the financial hardships brought on by 
the crisis are becoming increasingly pressing. 
</P>
<P>
But Smiley has been more fortunate than some others. The Kuwaiti government 
sent her husband's monthly paycheck, and their bank here in the United States 
has put a three-month hold on their mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Barbara Smiley still has had to buy health and car insurance, pay real 
estate taxes and, above all, huge monthly telephone bills. "On top of that," 
she points out, "this trip doesn't come cheap." 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has said it will furnish the hostages' relatives with room 
and board in Baghdad and will provide free, round-trip air transportation 
between Amman, Jordan, and Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the relatives -- who live in such diverse places as California, Florida, 
Idaho and Texas -- have to pay their own way to Jordan and back. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing has really had an impact on our savings," says Van Baale, who is a 
police sergeant. Earlier in the fall, Van Baale traveled to Washington to 
present a petition to the Iraqi Embassy calling for the release of his 
father-in-law -- to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a real financial burden," he says. 
</P>
<P>
As she prepared late last week to travel from Texas to New York, Willie Carr 
also was optimistic: "They said if we come in peace, not bearing arms, we will 
not leave empty-handed," she said. "And I believe them. I'm reading into that 
what I want to." 
</P>
<P>
And Barbara Smiley is unrepentant, saying, "If propaganda is what Saddam is 
getting out of it, fine -- if that's what it takes."

Iraq's ruling Revolutionary Command Council accepted President Bush's offer to 
send Secretary of State James A. Baker III to Baghdad for talks with Saddam 
Hussein. But the council insisted on linking any resolution of the crisis to 
Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories.

<P>
The United States and Saudi Arabia are preparing to initiate covert 
psychological warfare against Iraq if war breaks out in the gulf, according to 
U.S. military sources. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan will send 10,000 more soldiers to Saudi Arabia, adding to a current 
deployment estimated at 2,000, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. airman was killed in a vehicle accident at an air base in Saudi Arabia,

deployment began.

This nation's military will take the first losses among the multinational 
forces opposing Iraq if war breaks out, the Saudi joint commanding general said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that if our friends are here to shed their blood for us, the least 
we can do is to put my forces right in front," Prince Khalid ibn Sultan, a 
nephew of King Fahd, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"And if there is any bloodshed, I can assure you Saudis will take it before 
their friends." 
</P>
<P>
The prince, who shares authority over the multinational force in Saudi Arabia 
with the U.S. commander, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, declined to speculate on 
whether Washington's offer to talk to Iraq represents a "last chance" to avoid 
war. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Prince Khalid told several hundred Saudi marines and seamen at a 
Persian Gulf naval base that the United Nations had given Saddam Hussein a 
chance to leave Kuwait without war. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope this problem will be solved with peaceful means, using our brains," he 
said. "We hope President Saddam (Hussein) will come to his senses -- we don't 
want to go to war," said the prince, who received his military education in 
Britain and the United States.

versus a knight and pawn, with experts giving Karpov reasonable chances to hold 
a draw. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-game match is currently tied at 7 1/2 to 7 1/2, with one win and 
thirteen draws to each player.

State legislative staff members are facing a not-so-merry Christmas because of 
massive job layoffs or reduced salaries threatening to hit their ranks after 
voter approval of Proposition 140. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Claus is going to be pretty scarce around our house this year," said one 
lawmaker's aide, who is updating his resume and looking for prospective new 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
Besides limiting the terms of elected state officials, one of the measure's 
provisions seeks to slash lawmakers' operating budgets -- which means cutting 
staffs by almost 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Just who among the Capitol's 3,200 legislative employees must go or take a 
salary cut is up in the air. The deadline is seven months away and a legal 
challenge to Proposition 140 is expected to be filed early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Legislative staffers are gossiping in Capitol corridors and coffee shops about 
plans that they hope will save their jobs -- even at the expense of others. 
Those who work for lesser-known legislators and small committees argue that 
they should be spared and that cuts should fall on the larger staffs of 
legislative leaders and major committees. 
</P>
<P>
Many agree that some longtime friendships are going to be ruined in the battle 
for survival. "Things could get real nasty before it's over," said one staffer, 
who declined to be identified.

calls for the Assembly-Senate's $219-million operating budget to be slashed by 
up to 48%, to $114 million. 
</P>
<P>
While vulnerable staffers wait to see where the ax will fall, rumors are flying 
and -- although they are largely unsubstantiated -- the concern that they are 
causing is real. 
</P>
<P>
One unconfirmed report is that Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los 
Angeles) feels that the 80-member Assembly should take a bigger staff "hit" 
than his 40-member upper house. This has caused a rumored rift with Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) -- all of which is officially denied. 
</P>
<P>
On the brighter side for staffers, scuttlebutt has it that Gov.-elect Pete 
Wilson, who endorsed Proposition 140's term limits, may be willing to make a 
"peace offering" to the Legislature and save jobs by assuming some of the 
required cuts within his office's operating budget -- again officially denied. 
</P>
<P>
Already a casualty of Proposition 140 is the proposed construction of a 
multimillion-dollar legislative office building across the street from the 
state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
The real anxiety rests with the many assistants, consultants, secretaries, bill 
researchers and district office personnel who are employed by lawmakers. Many 
remember that they donated money and time to the anti-140 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people definitely are upset over the passage of the initiative," said Bob 
Forsythe, press secretary to Roberti. "A number of them are putting together 
their resumes and seeking work in other places. And there are lots of rumors 
going around that range from the logical to fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
For now, the Senate is assuming that a large number of upper house staffers are 
going to lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are probably going to have to reduce the number of Senate employees by a 
substantial amount," said Cliff Berg, executive officer of the Rules Committee. 
"I would say about 35% to 50%, somewhere in that neighborhood. . . . We also 
have sent a memo to individual senators asking them for their ideas." 
</P>
<P>
The memo says that the Rules Committee hopes to implement a plan to meet 
Proposition 140 requirements by early February. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly is taking a more conservative approach. The day after the November 
election, Speaker Brown told lower house employees: "Don't worry until after 
the holidays. Go ahead and try to have a good Thanksgiving and Christmas. We've 
got 'til July. Everything will be done to mitigate any personal hardships on 
individuals." 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Brown also asked Bob Connelly, executive officer of the Assembly Rules 
Committee, to explore alternatives to satisfying the requirements of 
Proposition 140. 
</P>
<P>
Connelly is looking into proposals such as moving some legislative employees 
into protected Civil Service status, a "golden handshake" early retirement 
program, a four-day workweek, a 20% across-the-board pay cut, a freeze on 
replacing workers who leave legislative service and canceling some state leases 
for office space. 
</P>
<P>
"We also could lay off a lot of people," he said, "but that is a last resort. 
We will look at all other options first before layoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Staffers who work for majority Democrats are more optimistic than those who 
work for minority Republicans. If it comes down to members of the Legislature 
having to decide who stays and who goes, Democrats will be calling most of the 
shots on key committees. Democrats outnumber Republicans 48 to 32 in the 
Assembly and 25 to 13 in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Another idea being circulated envisions Speaker Brown pressuring lobbyists to 
create jobs on their staffs for top legislative aides -- who would continue 
working for the Speaker. Connelly called this a "ridiculous" idea because it 
would be a flagrant violation of state law. 
</P>
<P>
A third plan would shift the sergeants-at-arms -- whose duties include running 
personal errands for lawmakers -- to the jurisdiction of the General Services 
Administration, the state's housekeeping agency. Connelly said this would not 
save any money because the GSA would charge the Legislature for providing the 
sergeants. 
</P>
<P>
Connelly noted that next year the Legislature must deal with a new 
Administration, an expected $4 billion budget shortfall and reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a recipe for extreme stress if there ever was one," he said.

DRIVERS GET THEIR 2 CENTS IN AS NICKEL-A-GALLON TAX HIKE TAKES EFFECT; 
</P>
<P>
LEVIES: SOME MOTORISTS FILLED THEIR TANKS BEFORE THE PRICES WENT UP AT 
MIDNIGHT, BUT OTHERS WERE CAUGHT UNPREPARED. 
</P>

Some were angry, some resigned. But whether they liked it or not, all the 
motorists queued up at service stations across Southern California on Saturday 
began paying the new federal excise tax, which added 5 cents to every gallon of 
gas sold. 
</P>
<P>
"The government already takes out so much in taxes," said Tiffany Lee, 22, a 
model, who filled her Hyundai Sonata at an Arco Station in Los Angeles' 
Koreatown. "It doesn't seem fair that they're going after more tax money. This 
much more we have to pay? With the economy so slow, it makes you think there's 
something wrong with George Bush." 
</P>
<P>
The new tax brings the national average of unleaded regular gas at self-service 
stations to $1.41 a gallon, according to the American Automobile Assn. 
</P>
<P>
While pumping unleaded gas priced at $1.45 per gallon, a 33-year-old municipal 
bond trader from Pasadena also lamented the uneasy state of the nation's 
economy, saying that her husband had just been laid off. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an investment banker, and his future job prospects look pretty (bad) 
right now," said the woman, who asked not to be identified. To augment the 
household income, she had to go back to work last week at a downtown brokerage 
firm after several months off. 
</P>
<P>
The price hike will squeeze her family's single income all the more, the woman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy with the tax, but what else can the government do?" she asked. 
"With the budget deficit so high, you can cut back, cut back, cut back, only so 
much. It's ridiculous to think you can balance it without raising taxes." 
</P>
<P>
The tax is estimated to generate $5 billion a year, half of which will go 
toward road and public transportation improvements. Half will be used to 
whittle down the nation's $250-billion budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Many Ventura County motorists were not fazed by the tax hike, saying that 
they've learned to live with the steeper gasoline prices. Several people 
filling their tanks at a Shell station in mid-town Ventura said they could 
envision gas prices going to $2 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll just keep driving," said Nigel Thornell, 46, a medical lab specialist 
from Santa Barbara. "There isn't much choice." 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Gamua, manager of Seaward Mobil in Ventura, said people initially were 
annoyed by a nickel-a-gallon state tax increase in August and since have 
accepted the escalating costs. 
</P>
<P>
Still, motorists lined up Friday night at Argett Chevron in Ventura to fill up 
their tanks before the price hike took effect at midnight, said Josh Nudd, a 
station attendant. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, "Some people were kind of upset and wished they'd come in last 
night," Nudd said. 
</P>
<P>
Pedra Salcedo, a housekeeper in Santa Ana who commutes every day from jobs in 
Newport Beach and Corona del Mar, said she fills up her small pickup twice a 
week, spending from $20 to $25. 
</P>
<P>
"One day it's $10; another day it takes $12," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In Chatsworth, Kim Oswald, 28, said she went to five gas stations looking for 
the lowest price before stopping at an Arco station. The price for regular 
leaded gas: $1.27. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us are barely making it as it is," Oswald said as she filled up a 
well-worn Pontiac Bonneville. 
</P>
<P>
More than the extra 5 cents per gallon, motorists seemed to be dismayed at 
having no say over Congress' action to increase taxes in its budget agreement. 
Some were upset that President Bush has not been held accountable to his 
campaign promises of no new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything he promised he was going to do, he hasn't followed through on," 
said the Pasadena bond broker. "I'm not happy with him at all. And I'm a 
Republican." 
</P>

PRIVATE SERVICES SET FOR COUSINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A private funeral for author Norman Cousins was to be held at his Beverly Hills 
home today, and a second funeral was planned early this week in New Jersey, 
where Cousins will be buried in the family plot in Union Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins, the medical guru, diplomat and editor whose recovery from arthritis 
helped change the way doctors look at illness and emotions, died Friday of a 
heart attack at age 75. 
</P>
<P>
He was stricken at a Westwood hotel where he had gone to meet a pianist friend. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. L.J. West, professor and past director of psychiatry and biobehavioral 
sciences at UCLA, where Cousins taught at the School of Medicine, said this 
week's services will be closed to the public. 
</P>
<P>
However, West said he was planning a memorial service to be held at UCLA within 
the next couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
After a career as an editor of the Saturday Review for more than 30 years and 
emissary to three presidents, Cousins had found a new calling with the 
publication in 1979 of "Anatomy of an Illness as Perceived by the Patient." The 
bestseller detailed his recovery from a life-threatening form of arthritis 
through a self-prescribed regimen of positive thinking and Vitamin C.

JET FIGHTER CRASHES; PILOT SAFELY EJECTS

<P>
An Air Force F-16 fighter jet crashed and burst into flames Saturday morning 
less than 20 yards from the main taxiway at Palmdale Airport, sending civilian 
aerospace workers scrambling for cover. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, Capt. Craig Fisher, ejected just before the aircraft hit the ground, 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher, a flight instructor at Luke Air Force Base in Phoenix, Ariz., was in 
good condition, according to Lt. Col. Scott C. Allen, commander of Air Force 
Plant 42 in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials refused to comment on the cause of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The plane plunged straight down, striking the ground with such force that it 
burrowed in, leaving only a portion of the tail section visible from the 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, workers dismantling the SR-71 Blackbird, a spy plane that is being 
retired, ran for cover when they saw the plane coming down, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
No one at the airport was injured. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like the blink of an eye and it was over," said one witness, who asked 
not to be identified. "Flames were shooting 200 feet into the air." 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Smart of Quartz Hill, a Rockwell flight electrician who was working in a 
nearby hangar, said he heard a couple of explosions and ran outside. He said he 
looked up and saw the canopy coming off, the pilot parachuting down and the 
plane in a dive. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw this big fireball," Smart said. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said the plane, which is based at Luke, is valued at about $35 million. 
It was on a routine, cross-country training flight. The Air Force officer would 
not provide details of the route except to say that the plane's destination was 
Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
An America West flight arriving from Phoenix after the crash was held on the 
runway for an hour because of debris on the taxiway. An outgoing Las Vegas 
flight was delayed for 30 minutes.

TENNESSEE'S VICTORY IS SUGARCOATED; 
</P>
<P>
SEC: VOLUNTEERS BEAT VANDERBILT, 49-20, FOR THEIR SECOND CONSECUTIVE CONFERENCE 
TITLE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Tennessee won the Southeastern Conference championship and a trip to the Sugar 
Bowl with a 49-20 victory over Vanderbilt Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The 12th-ranked Volunteers, 8-2-2 overall and 5-1-1 in the SEC, overcame a 
17-14 halftime deficit and earned a New Year's Day date with Virginia in New 
Orleans. Florida has a 6-1 SEC record but is not eligible for the conference 
title or Sugar Bowl because of NCAA sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee's victory wasn't easy. Vanderbilt (1-10, 1-6) trailed only 21-20 late 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tougher than I imagined," Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors said. "The 
wishbone presents many difficulties. It runs the clock and shortens the game." 
</P>
<P>
When Tennessee had the ball, it was a matter of giving Tony Thompson running 
room. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson carried 31 times for 236 yards, scoring on runs of nine, 12, 11 and 13 
yards in winning the SEC rushing title, finishing with 1,261 yards in 219 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
"It couldn't be more appropriate for this team to have Tony Thompson as its 
captain. He's a champion, a winner," said Majors, who guided the Volunteers to 
back-to-back SEC championships for the first time since the 1938-40 Tennessee 
team won three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt's loss may have been the last appearance on the sideline for Coach 
Watson Brown, who has lost 25 of his last 27 games and is 4-29 against SEC 
opposition in his five years. 
</P>
<P>
"You're asking the wrong people about that," Brown said when asked about his 
job security. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Hoolahan, Vanderbilt athletic director, said he had discussed the 
situation with Brown Friday and that a decision on next season will be reached 
"in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
The Nashville Banner and several local television stations have reported that 
Brown will be fired next week. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said his team did its best Saturday and for most of the season but came 
up against a Tennessee team that appears to be peaking. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best they've played since I've played them," Brown said. "We've 
only played half a game (against Tennessee) each year. We'll have to see if 
Tennessee will play half a game one year, and knock them off." 
</P>
<P>
The Volunteers didn't take the lead until Thompson scored on a 12-yard run with 
11:24 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt then drove to the Volunteer 19 before settling for a 36-yard field 
goal by Jeff Owen that cut the deficit to 21-20 with 5:19 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson then carried on seven of eight plays during a 52-yard scoring drive 
that gave Tennessee a 28-20 lead. He skirted left end for 11 yards, avoiding 
six potential tacklers along the way, for his third touchdown of the game. 
</P>
<P>
On Vanderbilt's next possession, Corey Harris fumbled and Tennessee's Darryl 
Hardy recovered. Five plays later, Andy Kelly passed 20 yards to Carl Pickens 
in the end zone for a 35-20 lead.

Amp Lee rushed for 147 yards and scored three touchdowns and Casey Weldon 
passed for 325 yards and two scores as No. 8 Florida State blitzed No. 6 
Florida, 45-30, Saturday night at Tallahassee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Dawsey scored on a 76-yard touchdown pass play in the opening minute 
and set up another score with a 71-yard reception in the fourth quarter. Dawsey 
caught four passes for 172 yards and finished the season with 65 catches and 
999 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Lee scored on runs of 16 and two yards and caught an eight-yard touchdown pass 
from Weldon, giving the sophomore running back 18 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Seminoles finished the season 9-2 with five consecutive wins heading into 
the Blockbuster Bowl against Penn State on Dec. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State jumped to a 10-0 lead two minutes into the game on its way to a 
fourth consecutive victory over the Gators, who finished the season 9-2 under 
first-year Coach Steve Spurrier. They are ineligible for postseason play 
because of NCAA sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech 40, Georgia 23 -- Shawn Jones passed for four touchdowns to lead 
the second-ranked Yellow Jackets (10-0-1) at Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
Jones also accounted for two two-point conversions as Tech extended its 
unbeaten streak to 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech, the only unbeaten team in Division I-A, carries a five-game 
winning streak into a Jan. 1 Citrus Bowl meeting with No. 19 Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a sophomore, completed 12 passes in a row during one stretch and 15 of 
20 in the game for 225 yards as the Yellow Jackets overcame an early 9-0 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama 16, Auburn 7 -- The Crimson Tide gained a berth in the Fiesta Bowl and 
sent Auburn to the Peach Bowl with this victory at Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Jones scored on a one-yard run and Philip Doyle kicked three field goals 
for the Tide. Doyle, with 78 field goals, is the Southeastern Conference's 
all-time leader. 
</P>
<P>
The victory capped a remarkable turnaround for Alabama (7-4, 5-2), which 
started the season with three consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama defeated Auburn for the first time in five years to earn its 31st bowl 
trip in the past 32 years. The Fiesta will be Alabama's 43rd bowl appearance, 
the most by any team. The Tide will face Louisville (9-1-1). 
</P>
<P>
Auburn, making its 24th bowl trip, will play Indiana (6-4-1) in the Peach Bowl 
on Dec. 29.

AZTECS' BID CUT SHORT BY MIAMI; 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO STATE: TURNOVERS, MISSED FIELD GOALS PROVE COSTLY AS NO. 3 HURRICANES 
ESCAPE, 30-28.

<P>
The seconds ticked away from the San Diego State football season Saturday in 
the dusk at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium with the Aztecs trailing No. 3 Miami, 
30-28, and desperately trying to come back. 
</P>
<P>
They had the ball on their six-yard line with nine seconds to play and no 
timeouts. Dan McGwire completed a short pass to Patrick Rowe and he was tackled 
at the 10. After nearly four hours of big plays, the Aztecs ran out of them. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot of fun out there," Aztec defensive back Robert Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
Two mistakes by the Aztecs were particularly costly. With the score 10-10 and 
5:43 left in the first half, Miami's Darrin Smith intercepted a pass by McGwire 
at the Aztec 26. Five plays later, Steve McGuire scored from the five, and 
Miami took a 17-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with 4:42 left in the third quarter and Miami ahead 27-20, McGwire 
fumbled a snap and Miami's Anthony Hamlet recovered. A minute later, Carlos 
Huerta kicked a 22-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Two Aztec mistakes, 10 points for Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"Turnovers are the key in any big ballgame," Aztec Coach Al Luginbill said. 
"You can't just turn the ball over two times inside the 30 against a good 
football team." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Aztecs stayed in the game. But trailing 30-20 in the fourth quarter, 
Aztec kicker Andy Trakas missed three field goals within an 8:25 span. They 
came from 38, 47 and 54 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
Even worse, the Aztecs used two timeouts to set up for field goal attempts. The 
first came when Tony Nichols, an offensive tackle, wasn't on the field in time. 
Luginbill took the blame for the second, but wouldn't specify. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs pulled to within 30-26 on a 13-yard touchdown pass from McGwire to 
Dennis Arey, and they got the two-point conversion when McGwire, wrapped up by 
a defender, switched the ball to his left hand and shoveled a pass to tight end 
Jim Hanawalt. 
</P>
<P>
A brawl started when Miami's Shane Curry hit McGwire after Hanawalt was already 
in the end zone. Aztec offensive tackle Nick Subis jumped on Curry, and the 
benches emptied. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire completed 32 of 53 passes for 323 yards and two touchdowns. Miami's 
Craig Erickson completed 17 of 39 passes for 284 yards and two touchdowns.

Nevada a 42-35 victory over Furman Saturday in the longest NCAA Division I-AA 
playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada (12-1) plays Big Sky foe Boise State next Saturday in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
In each overtime, teams are given the ball on the opponents' 25-yard lines. 
Neither scored on its first possession Saturday and both scored on the second 
before Whalen's touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada had forced the overtime when Chris Vargas hit Ross Ortega on a 13-yard 
touchdown pass and Joe King with a two-point conversion with 16 seconds left in 
the fourth quarter.

UC IRVINE BEATS BRADLEY, 94-85, IMPROVES TO 3-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Complain, if you will, that UC Irvine's shooting guard can hardly make a shot, 
and that its point guard has few assists. 
</P>
<P>
The complaints are being hushed for the moment at Irvine, where, despite such 
oddities, the Anteaters won their own Freedom Bowl Classic Saturday by 
defeating Bradley, 94-85, in the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
With that, the Anteaters have a two-game winning streak for the first time 
since February of 1989. And with a 3-2 record, they are above .500 for the 
first time since March of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine was 5-23 last season, the worst in school history. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters trailed, 36-33, at halftime but went ahead early in the second 
half. They couldn't pull away, however, until the final eight minutes, on the 
passing of Dylan Rigdon, the shooting guard, and the shooting of Gerald 
McDonald, the point guard. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald had 21 points, leading all scorers except Bradley's Curtis Stuckey, 
who had 29. 
</P>
<P>
One continuing source of bewilderment to Irvine is the shooting of Rigdon, who 
as a freshman last year averaged 17 points over the final nine games. 
</P>
<P>
After four games this season, Rigdon was averaging only 9.5 points. Stunningly, 
he had only eight field goals and was shooting 26% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
He is the player Irvine would most like to see shoot. But as he has struggled 
-- and against the backdrop of Coach Bill Mulligan's cries of "Shoot! Shoot!" 
-- Rigdon has led the team in a most unlikely category: assists. 
</P>
<P>
He entered the game against Bradley with 17, averaging four a game. By 
contrast, the Anteaters' point guard, McDonald, entered the game with only nine 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
Rigdon did not have a field goal in the first 35 minutes, but the first, when 
it came, was big one -- a three-pointer that gave Irvine a nine-point lead with 
four minutes left.

DEPAUL DEFENSE STALLS PEPPERDINE, 85-64 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pepperdine started out like a house on fire Saturday evening, but DePaul 
quickly brought out the hoses. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves (3-1) were unable to sustain an early lead and were beaten by DePaul, 
85-64, before 3,104 at Firestone Fieldhouse in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine used balanced scoring to build a 16-10 lead in the first six 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But the Waves, harried by a swarming DePaul defense, began missing shots -- 
including a couple of dunks -- and throwing the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Demons (3-0) capitalized on the mistakes and came back to take a 38-31 
lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
David Booth scored eight of his 21 points in the first five minutes of the 
second half, spurring DePaul to a 60-39 advantage with 12:31 left. 
</P>
<P>
Geoff Lear responded with eight of his team-high 18 points in the next five 
minutes, igniting a 15-4 run by Pepperdine, and the Waves narrowed the gap to 
64-54 with 6:48 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But Pepperdine had lost its spark, and DePaul outscored the Waves, 21-10, the 
rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said that his team "got a little greedy" after 
leading early. "We couldn't sustain it against a team more experienced than we 
are." 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said he didn't think his team was intimidated by DePaul early in the 
game, "but over a period of time we were." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Howard led DePaul with 24 points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Lear had a game-high 10 rebounds to go with his 18 points, but the Waves were 
out-rebounded, 40-34. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine's Doug Christie scored 11 points on four-of-14 shooting, and 
teammate Rex Manu added 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves shot only 38.5% from the field (25 for 65), and DePaul shot 50.9% (28 
for 55). On free throws, Pepperdine shot a poor 52.4% (11 for 21), and DePaul 
shot 87.1% (27 for 31).

LOYOLA WINS BEHIND 48 BY LOWERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Loyola Marymount found the winning combination Saturday, getting 48 points from 
Terrell Lowery and pushing the pace to beat Idaho State, 114-110, in the 
consolation game of the Freedom Bowl Classic at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery's point total set a tournament and Bren Center record, but the Lions got 
big plays from several players down the stretch to improve to 2-3 after Idaho 
State (1-3) erased a 13-point second-half deficit and took a two-point lead 
with 4:27 to play. 
</P>
<P>
With the Bengals leading, 106-104, Lowery answered with his seventh three-point 
basket. The lead seesawed until Christian Scott converted a tough inside shot 
and added a free throw to give the Lions the lead for good at 112-110 with 2:07 
left. 
</P>
<P>
In the final minute Loyola milked the clock and Brian McCloskey, who had 16 
points, put the game away by hitting a jump shot with 35 seconds to play. Scott 
blocked the Bengals' last two shot attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Kreps led Idaho State with 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
With the seventh-best scoring total in school history -- and his second game of 
40 or more in the last three games -- Lowery hit all 15 free throws and has 
made his last 32. The Lions hit 29 of 35 free throws to 20 of 23 for Idaho 
State. Lowery had 31 points by halftime, when the Lions led, 61-50. 
</P>
<P>
"What a struggle," a relieved Lion Coach Jay Hillock said. "I'm proud of 'em 
'cause they could've cracked and didn't. Our valleys weren't as deep or as 
long."

AILING WARD LEADS TITANS PAST BUTLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Agee Ward, bruised thigh and all, gave Cal State Fullerton a shot in the arm 
Saturday night, scoring 25 points and grabbing 12 rebounds to lead the Titans 
to a 79-76 victory over Butler before 1,201 in Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Ward, a 6-foot-5 junior who started the Titans' season opener against Lamar, 
has come off the bench the last two games since being injured. 
</P>
<P>
Ward gave Fullerton 23 strong minutes, converting four offensive rebounds into 
baskets and scoring 16 of his points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Center Aaron Wilhite added 12 points and forward Ron Caldwell had 10 to 
complement an inside game that carried the Titans on a night their outside game 
went cold. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton guard Joe Small made his first shot early in the game but finished 
three for 16, including one of six from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
"No player is going to have a good game every night -- that's why it's a team 
game," Titan Coach John Sneed said. "Someone else has to step in, like Agee." 
</P>
<P>
It seemed as if no Titan was a threat in the final six minutes, when Fullerton 
blew an 11-point lead. The Bulldogs scored 11 consecutive points, nine by 
forward Darin Archbold, to make the score 72-72 with 2:45 left. Archbold 
finished with 31 points. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton caved in against Butler's full-court press, turning the ball over 
three times during Butler's run. Wilhite finally broke the spell with two free 
throws at the 2:10 mark, and Small made a jumper and two free throws to keep 
Fullerton ahead in the final 1:28. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Bowen blocked Jermaine Guice's three-pointer as the game ended to secure 
the victory.

St. Paul 31, Hawthorne 0 -- St. Paul fullback Anthony Morales scored two

<P>
The Swordsmen will take an unbeaten streak of nine games into the championship.

<P>
St. Paul held Hawthorne (10-3) to two first downs, both on penalties, and three

Antelope Valley Coach Brent Carder summed up Brett Salisbury in one sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"He's everything everybody said he was," Carder said. 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury, the nation's leading community college passer, played only the first 
half before leaving with a sprained ankle, but threw for 379 yards and four 
touchdowns to lead Palomar to a 28-24 victory over Antelope Valley Saturday in 
the Hall of Fame Bowl at Balboa Stadium in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury, who transferred to Palomar from Brigham Young because Ty Detmer was 
the Cougars' starting quarterback, passed for 3,328 yards and 33 touchdowns and 
set a national junior college record with 273 completions, completed 15 of his 
24 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark 69, Santa Monica 34 -- Winless in three previous bowl appearances, the 
Raiders made up for years of frustration by routing the Corsairs in the Western 
State Bowl at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's Freddie Bradley rushed for 183 yards in 23 carries and scored on 
runs of four, 34 and eight yards. For the season, he rushed for 2,129 yards and 
scored 32 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale 23, Citrus 16 -- The Vaqueros took a run at the state's top-ranked 
defense. Literally. Keeping the ball on the ground for 58 of its 70 offensive 
plays -- including all nine on the winning drive -- Glendale ground out a 
victory over the Owls in the Southern California Bowl at Citrus. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale gained 437 yards, including 306 rushing. But the last 59 were the most 
important. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale started its winning drive on the Citrus 41 with 6:33 left. Fullback 
Rafik Thorossian keyed the march, carrying four times for 30 yards. Bobby 
Webster capped the drive, going over from the three with 1:11 left. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena 29, Riverside 28 -- Ostell Miles gained 50 of his 164 yards on the 
winning drive, including a one-yard touchdown run with 3:03 left, and James 
Marlborough passed to Wolfe Barber for the two-point conversion as the Lancers 
won the first game of the Orange County Bowl doubleheader at Orange Coast 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside's Jeff McDaniel missed a 32-yard field goal attempt with 27 seconds 
left. The Tigers had taken a 28-21 lead with 5:32 left on a one-yard run on 
fourth down by quarterback Jack Manu. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino 23, Orange Coast 20 -- The Warriors rallied for two touchdowns in the 
final 6 minutes and 52 seconds to win the second game of the doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Daigle, who rushed for a game-high 163 yards, leaped one yard for the 
decisive touchdown with 2:29 left. Bryan Reeves caught a 10-yard touchdown pass 
from Rod Harvey with 6:52 left as El Camino cut the lead to 20-16.

SMITH'S 52 TIE RECORD IN CLIPPER WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DENVER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Clippers got their chance on the NBA's Autobahn Saturday night, 
Charles Smith found himself in a fast-lane race with history as his team 
wrapped up a 137-121 victory over the Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
The third-year forward knew he had 52 points, because the McNichols Arena 
scoreboard keeps running totals for individuals. But he didn't realize that put 
him a point away from breaking the franchise record for scoring in a game. 
</P>
<P>
So when the Clippers got the ball back after a basket by Denver's Chris Jackson 
with 10 seconds left, those on the bench stood and starting shouting for Tom 
Garrick to push the ball upcourt to Smith. Garrick, unsure at first what all 
the commotion was about, got the ball to Smith, who shot a 15-footer along the 
right baseline with three seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what everyone was saying," Smith said after topping his previous 
best of 40, set last season at Indiana. "It was a lot of 'Run, Charles!' I 
looked at the clock and said, 'Hey, the game's over.' I had no idea what 
everyone was yelling at me about." 
</P>
<P>
So when he got the ball? 
</P>
<P>
"I was just shooting it for the hell of it." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until some two minutes later that Smith discovered he had tied the 
mark Bob McAdoo set twice in 1976 as a member of the Buffalo Braves. Ralph 
Lawler, the Clippers' announcer, delivered the news when Smith came out for the 
post-game radio show." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, (expletive)," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
It was off the air. 
</P>
<P>
"Damn," said Smith, who made 17 of 27 shots from the field and 18 of 21 free 
throws. "If somebody had said something . . . oh, man." 
</P>
<P>
But he made the record book, shared entry or not; broke Derek Smith's San 
Diego/Los Angeles Clipper record of 41 set in April of 1985; and made his own 
Wall of Fame. That's a more personal thing, the box scores of record-setting 
games he puts above his desk at home. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime today, after the Clippers return and get ready to play Minnesota at 
the Sports Arena, the Indiana box score from March 3 will come down. There's a 
new pacesetter for Smith's career. 
</P>
<P>
He can post the reviews, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him do everything tonight," said Orlando Woolridge, who led the Nuggets 
with 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
"He's perfected his game," added Denver's Jerome Lane, a teammate of Smith's at 
Pitt. "The fade-away he has really turned it around. In college, it was just 
so-so." 
</P>
<P>
There were few detours in the first half for the Clippers, who were barely 
slowed by Denver's constant full-court press and went into halftime with a 
64-54 lead. That represented their best start of the season and their 
second-highest scoring half, bettered only by the 65 in the final two quarters 
at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Looking to offset the fatigue factor that slows many Nugget opponents in the 
second half, Coach Mike Schuler substituted often in the early going. Six 
Clippers played at least 12 of the first 24 minutes, but none more than Gary 
Grant's 18. Smith went 16, and squeezed 22 points on nine-of-12 shooting during 
the first two quarters out of that. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, having tired by the fourth quarter in a game during which he played 37 
minutes, scored 19 points in the third quarter and 11 in the last. Good enough 
to tie McAdoo. 
</P>
<P>
But there's always next time. 
</P>
<P>
"That opportunity won't come around again," he said, a notion that more than a 
few coaches around the league might disagree with. "Unless we play Denver." 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Joe Wolf, signed as a free agent two weeks before training camp, made his first 
appearance against his former teammates, missing his only shot in nine minutes. 
His other contribution was giving Denver players and coaches his informal 
scouting report on the Clippers, not unlike what Clipper rookie Bo Kimble told 
his teammates about the Paul Westhead style of play. . . . Barry Hecker, the 
Clippers' director of scouting, has been mentioned as a possible replacement 
for Billy McKinney as director of player personnel for the Minnesota 
Timberwolves.

CUBAN DRUG TESTING AN ISSUE FOR PAN-AM GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States might not send athletes to next summer's Pan American Games 
unless the host country, Cuba, arranges for drug testing sanctioned by the 
International Olympic Committee, USOC President Robert Helmick said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
He said that was the message he was instructed to send to the Pan American 
Sports Organization (PASO) and the Cubans after a special meeting of the USOC's 
national governing bodies Saturday in Chicago . 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was called to discuss several concerns expressed by the national 
governing bodies about the participation of U.S. athletes in the Games, which 
are scheduled for Aug. 3-18 in Havana and Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Three former U.S. Olympic athletes who went to Cuba on a fact-finding mission 
last month submitted a positive report Saturday, but Helmick said drug testing 
remains an issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that everything else can be overcome, but we think it's unfair to ask 
our athletes to compete down there without IOC-approved drug testing," Helmick 
said. "We're gravely concerned with that. If it's not resolved, we'll have to 
think very carefully about how that will affect our participation." 
</P>
<P>
The Cubans attempted to obtain sophisticated drug-testing equipment from a U.S. 
company, but the sale was prohibited by the U.S. government's trade embargo 
against Cuba. Even if the Cubans were able to purchase the equipment from 
another source, there is not enough time between now and the Games for a new 
laboratory to receive IOC certification. 
</P>
<P>
There was no IOC-approved laboratory in Caracas, Venezuela, for the 1983 Pan 
American Games, but PASO arranged for Dr. Manfred Donike and his technicians 
from Cologone, West Germany, to operate a portable lab in Caracas during the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if that would work again because the drug-testing process is far 
more technical today," Helmick said. 
</P>
<P>
But he suggested that PASO could arrange to send the samples for testing to 
IOC-approved laboratories in Los Angeles, Indianapolis or Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
"There's got to be a way to solve the problem," he said.

Marlo Johnson of Mesa College, the NAIA's leading rusher, was charged with 
battery for hitting a fan with his helmet after his team's victory in a playoff 
game Saturday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had rushed for 47 yards in 18 carries to help Mesa to a 10-9 victory 
over Central Arkansas. Billy Leach, director of the Department of Public Safety 
at Central Arkansas, said witnesses saw the tailback run from the sideline to a 
nearby track and hit a Central Arkansas fan in the face with his helmet. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Jim Lawson, was taken to a hospital and treated for a broken jaw, 
authorities said.

FRAZIER GETS 6-MONTH BAN FOR WEIGHT INFRACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ricky Frazier, the jockey whose victory aboard Allijeba was erased because of a 
weight discrepancy after a $250,000 race at Bay Meadows on Oct. 14, has been 
suspended for six months, the stewards at the San Mateo track announced 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension, which started Saturday, runs through May 31. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier is currently riding at the Fair Grounds, and stewards at the New 
Orleans track, following racing custom, took the jockey off his mounts there 
Saturday. Racing has an informal reciprocity rule that prohibits jockeys from 
competing anywhere while under suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Fair Grounds sources indicated that Frazier would appeal the suspension to the 
California Horse Racing Board, but the jockey couldn't be reached for comment. 
Six months is considered to be a severe penalty, but the stewards are believed 
to have considered Frazier's previous record, which includes two fines of $100 
each for weight violations. 
</P>
<P>
Allijeba was supposed to carry 126 pounds in the Final Fourteen Stakes at Bay 
Meadows. When Frazier returned to the scales after a nose victory over Tex's 
Zing, the weight was 123 pounds. BILL CHRISTINE

BOXING: REFEREE ENDS JUNIOR-WELTERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHT IN 11TH ROUND BY 
DISQUALIFYING PAZIENZA.

Loreto Garza retained his World Boxing Assn. junior-welterweight championship 
when challenger Vinny Pazienza was disqualified after picking him up and 
throwing him in the 11th round Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Larry Rozadilla of Los Angeles, who had taken two points away from 
Pazienza for fouls earlier in the fight, said later he disqualified Pazienza 
for "dirty fighting." 
</P>
<P>
"I disqualified him for consistently dirty fighting, for disregarding my orders 
over and over. . . . I had to do something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Garza, comfortably ahead on points on most ringside scorecards, opened up a cut 
under Pazienza's right eye in the second round and kept the aggressive Pazienza 
at bay for nearly the entire fight. 
</P>
<P>
Garza was defending the WBA championship he won in Nice, France, in August. 
About 6,500 in Arco Arena saw fight, which was shown on pay-per-view 
television. 
</P>
<P>
Pazienza (29-5), who has lost two of his last three fights and four of his last 
10, looked like he had reached the end of the line. No one in his corner 
protested the disqualification. 
</P>
<P>
Garza (28-1-1), who earned $100,000, can now hope for a high-dollar bout with 
Ray Mancini or perhaps Julio Cesar Chavez. Pazienza's share of the Sacramento 
gate was $50,000, but he will earn another $100,000 from New England pay per 
view revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Pazienza, known as a brawler/puncher, tried to box at long range for the first 
three rounds but couldn't get around Garza's jab. Pazienza went on the attack 
in the fourth round and employed an aggressive, almost wild offense the rest of 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
But his cut opened badly in the sixth round, and the blood was streaming to his 
knees. His right eye also was badly swollen from the fifth round on. 
</P>
<P>
At the finish, the judges had Garza in a runaway. Rodolfo Maldonado of Panama 
had it 100-92, Richard Strange of New Jersey scored it 97-92 and Fritz Werner 
of New Jersey scored 99-89. The Times had Garza ahead, 98-91. 
</P>
<P>
The promoter, Don Chargin, lost one of his prime undercard bouts in the parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
Popular Sacramento junior-lightweight Rowdy Welch was to fight Mauro Gutierrez 
of Tijuana. Gutierrez got to within 100 yards of Arco Arena before suffering a 
broken right wrist in a car crash in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
That left former WBA junior-welterweight champion Juan Coggi of Argentina, from 
whom Garza captured the title. Coggi struggled early before knocking out 
Mexico's Alberto Alcaraz in the seventh round.

The clothing Weiss wears now hangs on the left, a much smaller collection of 
jeans and sweats that he wears to work. It reflects the casualness of the new 
life of Norman and Claire Weiss and the quieter way in which they live it. 
</P>
<P>
Like a growing assortment of Americans, including many urban baby boomers who 
did not want to embrace the future where they were, the Weisses turned their 
backs on a grand lifestyle in New York and Los Angeles that left them anxious 
and empty. 
</P>
<P>
"None of that's important, I have found out," Norman says. "The whole idea is 
to get rid of all that crap and live a simple, unencumbered life." 
</P>
<P>
These are not sentiments of an ascetic, nor are the Weisses thimble-brained 
greenhorns hoping to live off the land. They are, in fact, seven years into 
second careers as the proprietors of a bookshop in the mountain resort town of 
Park City, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The Weisses are representative of a category the U.S. Census does not measure 
but should, given the potentially profound impact of fast growth on undeveloped 
communities. These are people migrating not because of economics or job loss or 
transfer, but because they want to play out their lives differently. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people learn sooner than others," Norman says, suggesting he would not 
have minded if this epiphany had occurred earlier than it did. Norman is 66. 
Claire is 60. 
</P>
<P>
For 35 years, Norman was in the entertainment business, first in New York and 
then in California. As a manager, agent and promoter, Weiss was involved with 
Dinah Shore, Paul Anka, Jerry Lewis, Joel Grey, Bette Midler, Michael Douglas, 
Al Pacino, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra. He signed the Beatles to come to 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Norman was a shepherd whizzing around the country on private planes tending to 
his stars. A record here, a movie there, concerts, personal deals, the 
trouble-shooter and problem-solver. "My feet never touched the ground. I'd get 
picked up in a limo, driven right to the plane, and there'd be another limo on 
the other end." 
</P>
<P>
For this, Norman pulled down $300,000 or so a year and an equivalent amount of 
stress. Even though he hobnobbed with the glitzy, he tired of making the same 
deals with the same people in the same small circle. "It started boring me to 
tears," he says, "and I just didn't want to do it any more." 
</P>
<P>
Norman's fantasy, to own a bookstore, was not shared by Claire, an interior 
designer quite content with fancy cars, friends in entertainment and the 
wherewithal that went with it. 
</P>
<P>
Norman was so unhappy, however, that they decided to invest in a local 
bookstore that Norman could run part-time as he phased out of entertainment. 
When the building in which the store was located was torn down in 1983, they 
had to decide whether he could or should continue to fight Los Angeles' 
cutthroat booksellers with an independent little shop. 
</P>
<P>
"One day I'm reading Publisher's Weekly and there's an ad, a bookstore for sale 
in Park City," Norman says. They had never been there, but Park City was the 
winter getaway friends raved about. Claire reluctantly agreed to go see, but 
made her impulsive husband promise to look but not deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I promised," says Norman, whose gravelly voice and devilish twinkle are 
reminiscent of Lee Marvin, "but I lied." 
</P>
<P>
Norman concedes, however, that Claire hated their new life for several years. 
"We knew nobody up here. All of her friends, all of her family were in L.A. and 
New York. Our kids were back in L.A., so it was very alien to her." 
</P>
<P>
It took a while for Claire to share Norman's vision, but now she does 
wholeheartedly. "Utah was one of those states you fly over," she says. "But, 
you know, we were in a tight little circle and that had a lot to do with it. I 
love living here now." 
</P>
<P>
They bought Dolly's Books Etc., on Main Street between the liquor store and the 
post office. "That's one of the great things," Claire says. "People come to the 
post office and they stop at Dolly's." 
</P>
<P>
In the summer, except for an annual arts festival that recently drew 100,000 
visitors, Park City is a browsing kind of town 30 miles east of Salt Lake City. 
Its main business district is half a mile long and uphill. The permanent 
population is about 5,200 in a county of 17,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the winter, however, greater Park City is one of the nation's premier ski 
resorts. Tens of thousands of skiers pack the area's rental units and the homes 
and condos kept by the well-to-do. 
</P>
<P>
In their first winter, Norman says, it snowed for 53 consecutive days, but 
white is gold in Park City. When Dolly's goes into its winter mode, it is open 
10 to 10, seven days a week, eight employees instead of five. The Weisses work 
harder than ever, and find it exhilarating. 
</P>
<P>
Park City's cachet is remarkable because the city, thrown together after 
soldiers discovered silver in the 1860s, nearly succumbed decades ago after 
silver prices declined. Roughly $400 million came out of the mountains, 
launching such fortunes as the Hearst publishing empire. 
</P>
<P>
Snow now is bigger than silver and Park City commerce last year was worth $163 
million, double five years ago. Like any boom town, growth has caused problems 
and today it pits those who would like things to calm down against those who 
savor the expansion. Newcomers like the Weisses crowd Park City, as do the 
subdivisions all around it. 
</P>
<P>
The Weisses have mixed feelings. Commerce is what keeps registers ringing. Only 
five years ago, when proposed changes in the federal tax laws scared up a local 
recession, 13 stores were empty on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
Dolly's grossed more than $500,000 last year, quite enough to support them and 
their son Gary, 39, who two years ago moved from Los Angeles. A landscape 
architect, Gary and his wife, Shelley, live 25 miles away in the tiny town of 
Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
Gary is struck by how easy it is to get involved. "Here, all you have to do is 
say you want to, and you can do anything. You can materially affect your 
community just by wanting to. It's one of the biggest differences between a 
small place and a big place." 
</P>
<P>
And he is not worried about what might seem to be a town of limited 
opportunity. "As long as the economy stays relatively whole, there are fabulous 
opportunities here. You can do very well. This winter I'm going to work in the 
store and be a ski instructor, and, if I wanted to, I could also have a third 
job. You can't make a lot of money, but you don't need a lot of money to live 
here." 
</P>
<P>
His parents also are involved in ways that surprise them. Norman, for whom 
civic duty used to mean renewing his driver's license, is involved in the local 
art center, chamber of commerce, Main Street Assn. They also helped stage the 
community's first formal Passover seder, in a Catholic church, and attracted 
Jews, Mormons and others. 
</P>
<P>
They now drive four-wheel-drive Subarus, sensible in the snow. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you miss the two Mercedeses?" 
</P>
<P>
"Not in the least," Norman says. 
</P>
<P>
"Then why did you have them?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because I was a fool. All the successful guys in my business had Mercedeses or 
Rolls or BMWs, so you went along with it. The only one that ever really knew 
what I drove was the doorman at the Beverly Hills Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends in L.A., most of them still don't understand what I did or why I 
did it," Norman says. "And yet they all say, 'You're our idol. You did what all 
of us want to do." 
</P>
<P>
While Claire still travels to New York to buy for the store, Norman is content 
in Park City and wants no more of the Big Apple. "I've grown unused to it, and 
I just couldn't deal with it," he says of his last visit five years ago.

BEACH CITIES' SCHOOLS FEEL THE PINCH; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE DESIRE FOR LOCAL CONTROL IS STRONG. BUT REDONDO BEACH, MANHATTAN 
BEACH AND HERMOSA BEACH COULD USE THE COST SAVINGS THAT SOME FORM OF 
CONSOLIDATION WOULD ENTAIL. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Lynne Gonzales sent her oldest boy off to his first day of school in 
Hermosa Beach, there were half a dozen schools in the little city. There was no 
high school -- there never had been -- but there were shop and homemaking 
electives, two aides in every classroom, and even an enthusiastic if sometimes 
off-key school band. 
</P>
<P>
But times changed. In the ensuing 20 years, school budgets shrank drastically. 
Not only Hermosa Beach, but Redondo Beach and Manhattan Beach as well felt the 
pinch, lost children, shut down schools. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Gonzales' youngest hit eighth grade in the mid-1980s, there were 
758 students in a district that two decades before had had 2,141. Shop class, 
home economics and ceramics were gone, as were most of the aides. The music 
program had been scaled back. Five schools had closed, leaving a single campus 
where every child in the city was to be educated, from kindergarten through 
eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
Now Gonzales, a Hermosa Beach school trustee, is seeing enrollment creep 
upward, the result of shifting demographics and the district's solid academic 
reputation. But the gradual rebound has come too late to do much but add 
urgency to the questions facing not only her district, but all the beach city 
schools: 
</P>
<P>
How small is too small? For the sake of efficiency and education, should the 
three beach cities vote to merge their schools? And if so, how? Into one big 
district? Two? And what would be the consequences for students? 
</P>
<P>
The questions are emotionally and politically complicated, particularly in 
Hermosa Beach. Of the three beach cities it is the smallest and least populous, 
with the most to gain -- and the most to lose -- if a merger were to occur. 
</P>
<P>
Politically, the history of the beach city schools can be summed up in two 
words: local control. 
</P>
<P>
There are, and have been for years, four school districts for the three cities. 
Each city has its own elementary and middle schools, and they feed into the 
South Bay Union High School District, which encompasses Redondo Union High 
School in Redondo Beach, Mira Costa High School in Manhattan Beach, plus an 
alternative school and an adult school. 
</P>
<P>
The districts are fairly small and close together, and were urged to 
consolidate by state education officials twice in the mid-1960s and again in 
1972. The push then was part of a statewide strategy to encourage 
cost-effectiveness among hundreds of small districts, said Department of 
Education spokesman William L. Rukeyser. 
</P>
<P>
But the pull to control their own schools was stronger in the beach cities than 
the push from the state, and by the time the state stopped promoting 
unification in the mid-1980s, Redondo Beach, Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach 
still had separate districts. 
</P>
<P>
To outsiders such resistance may be perplexing: The three cities -- whose 
population is mostly white, economically upscale -- seem so similar that, 
elsewhere in Los Angeles County, people regularly get them mixed up. 
</P>
<P>
But to each other, the three cities are as singular and unique as three 
seashells on the shore. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a sense of parochialism, damn near nationalism, really, at the local 
level here. We're feudal," said Lance Widman, a Hermosa Beach activist who 
teaches political science at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
"Hermosa is viewed as the kid that never quite grew up. Redondo is the kid that 
won't stop growing. And Manhattan feels they're above all mere mortals. It's 
kind of a status thing." 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two decades, however, that outlook has grown costly. A state 
Supreme Court decision in the early 1970s took control of school funding away 
from local governments and gave it to the state, which then found itself 
financially strapped with the passage of tax-slashing Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the state doles out money to local school districts based on the number 
of children the district serves, and in the beach cities that meant further 
belt tightening as skyrocketing home prices discouraged young families from 
moving in. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s, mergers were discussed with varying 
degrees of seriousness as a means of cutting the cost of maintaining four 
school systems. But none of the plans got off the ground because one or more of 
the cities always would balk at relinquishing local control. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the issue of consolidation arose again, this time at the behest 
of the financially troubled high school district. In an effort to shore up its 
finances, the high school officials again proposed that the beach city schools 
merge into a single, unified, kindergarten-through-12th-grade system. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the economic advantages of maintaining one district, there are 
educational arguments for unification. Educators say children tend to learn 
best in a school system that runs seamlessly from kindergarten through high 
school, building knowledge, year upon year, without being disrupted by changing 
school philosophies or rules. In the beach cities, however, elementary students 
have one set of books, tests and rules through eighth grade, and a completely 
different one for high school. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to align with the high schools," Gonzales said, "but it's difficult. 
Things that are expected in one district aren't always expected in another. 
(Entering the high school district) is like moving to another state." 
</P>
<P>
But unification is a long and bureaucratic process, and can take years unless 
all the school districts unite behind a single plan. And this time, as before, 
longstanding differences among the cities stood in the way of the high school's 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Beach trustees suggested that instead of one unified district, 
there should be two. They feared only one high school would be needed in a 
consolidated district and that Redondo Union would be the one to get the ax. 
</P>
<P>
The high school district, they proposed, should be dismantled. Redondo Beach 
should take one school and create a K-12 district of its own. And the other 
mainstream high school, Mira Costa in Manhattan Beach, should be the 
centerpiece of the second district, which would encompass the elementary 
schools in the other two cities. 
</P>
<P>
The high school trustees weren't wild about the idea, but they eventually 
agreed to back any plan on which the elementary boards could agree. A 
consultant also recommended the Redondo Beach plan, noting, among other things, 
that Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach have a common approach to curricula and 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
And Manhattan Beach's trustees lined up behind the plan, saying it would offer 
their students a single, K-12 system large enough to allow a broad range of 
programs and economies of scale, but small enough that students and parents 
would not feel intimidated or be lost in a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
But for a host of reasons, the Hermosa Beach board refused to go along with the 
two-district idea. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa board President Mary Lou Weiss contended a single large district would 
streamline costs and "give us more clout in Sacramento." Trustee Joe Mark 
argued that a single district was the only cost-effective way to reorganize in 
the long haul, and that a two-district plan just put off the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
But in the other cities, and even among some parents in Hermosa Beach, the 
decision was viewed as a stall and an attempt to maintain local control. 
Hermosa trustees fear that under a two-system merger, its interests would lose 
out to Manhattan Beach, a bigger city, with more voters, more students and more 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
The two districts have speculated that a merged district would have a 
five-member school board with two representatives from each city and a fifth 
elected at large, but opponents of the joint-district idea fear that Manhattan 
Beach, with its larger electorate, would always dominate the board. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa trustees "know the other districts will never go for total unification. 
This is just a stall," said Redondo Beach board President Bart Swanson. 
</P>
<P>
But Pete Tucker, a Hermosa Beach parent and Little League coach, approved of 
the board's position. "If we go with Manhattan," he said, ". . . they'll 
steamroller right over us." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in the little city, however, agrees with the trustees' push for a 
single beach-city system. There are, after all, some advantages to going 
two-district now. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Redondo Beach elementary schools use different books and a 
different method of evaluation than the elementary schools in the other two 
cities. Under a single district, the books and testing methods would have to be 
made uniform, disrupting the education of grade-schoolers in one or more of the 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Under the two-district plan, the disruption would come only at the high school 
level, at an age when students might be better-equipped to handle it, according 
to Barbara J. Dunsmoor, president of the Manhattan Beach board. 
</P>
<P>
Another advantage of the two-district plan, proponents say, is that of all the 
merger plans, it is the most politically feasible. 
</P>
<P>
"While (the) Hermosa (board) has sat around wondering what people want, the 
lines have been drawn in the sand. They should show a little vision and say, 
'We could build a real strong K-12 system with Manhattan,' " said Carol 
Reznichek, a former Hermosa Beach board member and a parent in the district. 
</P>
<P>
"But what's happening is the opposite. The taxpayers should be incensed, 
because all that money going to administration is dollars away from kids," 
Reznichek added. "Maybe the ballot should say, 'Do you want to pay for four 
school districts, or would you rather have (the trustees) put down their 
politics?' " 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman and ex-Mayor Roger Creighton, who grew up in the Hermosa Beach 
schools, agrees that feelings are mixed in the city, which has operated its own 
schools since 1904. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the people here are so disgusted with the educational system in 
Hermosa Beach that they would vote for any kind of change," Creighton said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's another segment of about the same size that feels unification with 
Manhattan would be the way to go because Mira Costa doesn't have the gang 
problems Redondo Union has, and because the elementary systems (in Hermosa 
Beach and Manhattan Beach) are pretty close. 
</P>
<P>
"And then there's another portion that feels we should salvage our neighborhood 
schools at all cost, no matter how expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Could Hermosa Beach preserve its neighborhood schools? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not -- or at least not for much longer, says school board President 
Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
It is a growing district, its campus is filled to capacity and its limited 
resources are sorely stretched. 
</P>
<P>
As state appropriations have become leaner, Hermosa Beach has suffered along 
with districts throughout the state, Weiss said. Meanwhile, after so many years 
of declining enrollment, the district has recently seen its student body grow 
by about 5% a year, thanks to a local baby boomlet, as well as the district's 
reputation for small class size and innovative teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Other districts have sold or leased vacant school property to shore up their 
budgets, but Hermosa Beach has been limited in what it can do with its defunct 
schools because of a 1986 voter mandate designating such land as open space. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Weiss said, Hermosa Beach has been left in a pinch: Even if the 
district were to reopen an old school to accommodate its growth, it couldn't 
afford the extra teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"When our consultant looked at unification (this year), he said that at our 
current rate of spending, we had five years left," Weiss said. "We tightened 
our belt and managed to balance our budget, but staying within it means cutting 
frills." 
</P>
<P>
Cutting frills, she said, has meant turning more and more often to the 
community and parents for financial help. This year, for example, the 
Parent-Teacher Organization has been asked whether it would be willing to kick 
in some of the $18,000 the district has spent each year to send the sixth-, 
seventh- and eighth-graders on their annual field trips to Wrightwood, Catalina 
Island and Sacramento, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing a trend of being asked to supply more and more of the meat as 
opposed to the icing on the cake," PTO President Cathy McCurdy said. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting frills has also meant piling more and more responsibility onto the 
district's small administrative staff. 
</P>
<P>
School counselor Arlene Howell, for example, not only advises individual 
students and the student council, but is also the district's special projects 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
What that means, she said, is that she not only counsels academically and 
emotionally troubled students and their parents, and monitors others deemed to 
be "at risk," but that she also administers the avalanche of paperwork that 
accompanies all the state-mandated "categorical" programs in the district, 
including substance abuse education, programs for students with limited English 
proficiency and special education programs. 
</P>
<P>
Angela Jones, the school business manager, does "everything from the grunt work 
to federal reports. . . . I am my own secretary and staff," she said, adding 
that she often wonders who would do the payroll if she were ill. 
</P>
<P>
"You could say, well we're a small district and there aren't many kids," Howell 
said. "But at a point, the jobs don't diminish. I'm often here until 6 at 
night, and I'm not the last one to leave." 
</P>
<P>
There's little evidence at the school that resources are stretched thin. The 
classrooms, because of a teachers' contract, are limited to 30 pupils. The 
texts are up-to-date. The playgrounds are ample. The building is sound. The 
children seem cheerful and secure. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we do a great job, but that doesn't mean it's the best we can do for 
our kids," said Supt. Shalee Cunningham, who herself handles at least three 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a K-12 system. We need resources: money, people, programs. We have no 
clout at the state level. The county is squeezing us dry. We can't afford to be 
this small." 
</P>
<P>
Unification, Cunningham says, is "an inevitability." 
</P>
<P>
But that inevitability may be slow to arrive. If the trustees cannot agree, 
then by law, any reorganization plan they hope to put to a referendum must be 
accompanied by petitions bearing the signatures of 25% of the registered voters 
in each of the cities involved. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach trustees have gathered about two-thirds of the 10,000 signatures 
they need to advance the two-district plan. Those who back the plan in 
Manhattan Beach would need about 5,500 signatures in their city. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa Beach trustees would need to gather about 18,500 signatures to advance 
its competing plan for a single system. There is also talk of putting both 
measures on a local ballot at the same time and allowing the voters to choose, 
but state and county education officials say such a preferential ballot -- 
instead of a referendum -- has never been tried and may not be legal. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, each of the trustees is hoping for the consensus that will help 
shore up the beach city schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids are not being exposed to things like art and ceramics and homemaking, 
and they should be, at an early age, when their minds are open," Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know kids could benefit from these things," she added. "I know because we 
had them in the past." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UNIFICATION AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
THE ISSUE 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach each have their own elementary 
school district. When children in the three cities reach ninth grade, they move 
on to the separately run South Bay Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
The high school district, however, has had financial problems, and the single 
K-8 school in Hermosa Beach is overcrowded. All four districts agree 
reorganization is necessary, but they cannot agree on how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
THE OPTIONS 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach and Manhattan Beach favor split unification, in which two K-12 
school systems would be created, one in each of those cities, and the high 
school district would be dismantled. Redondo Beach would take over Redondo 
Union High School; Manhattan Beach would merge with Hermosa Beach and they 
would take over Mira Costa High School, which is in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa Beach wants total unification, in which all four districts would merge 
along the boundaries of the high school district to create one 10,000-student, 
unified district. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Union High School trustees initially wanted total unification, but 
have since agreed to support any plan the elementary boards can agree on. 
</P>
<P>
THE ARGUMENTS 
</P>
<P>
Split Unification 
</P>
<P>
PRO: Split unification would protect local control for at least two of the 
districts while saving money through economies of scale. Manhattan Beach and 
Hermosa Beach already share a common approach to testing and educational 
programs. All students -- but especially those in resource-poor Hermosa Beach 
-- could take advantage of a broader range of electives. 
</P>
<P>
CON: Hermosa Beach is much smaller than Manhattan Beach and could lose some 
political clout on a joint school board. The breakup of the high school 
district would create some disruption of curricula at the high school level. 
Some also argue that split unification would be a stopgap measure on the way to 
inevitable total unification. 
</P>
<P>
Total Unification 
</P>
<P>
PRO: Total unification would allow efficient operation and the broadest 
educational options. A larger district might also mean more influence at the 
state level. 
</P>
<P>
CON: Once again, the larger cities might dominate a joint school board. The new 
district also would have to reconcile differences between Redondo Beach's 
testing and educational philosophy and that of Manhattan Beach and Hermosa 
Beach, creating some disruption in curricula at the grade school level.

QUIET LADY LEFT A LEGACY WORTH MILLIONS TO SAN PEDRO HOSPITAL, YMCA

<P>
As an 18-year-old in the mid-1920s, Jennie Bezich went to work as the first 
employee of a fledgling marine insurance company in a town that had been built 
on the fishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
A top athlete at San Pedro High School, she was not particularly 
business-minded when she arrived at the Van Camp Insurance Co. But the 
president knew about the stock market, and his savvy rubbed off on the firm's 
new secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Bezich began putting what she could into stock. Her investments were blue chip, 
and she held onto them. She also rose with the insurance company during a 
50-year career, becoming secretary-treasurer, vice president and eventually a 
part owner. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, Bezich -- a private woman who never married and was 82 when she 
died of cancer in October, 1989 -- became very wealthy. But it was not the kind 
of wealth that showed. 
</P>
<P>
She dressed nicely but not extravagantly, and lived modestly for many years 
with with an unmarried sister, Mary, in a San Pedro apartment. She wasn't a 
traveler and drove the same car -- albeit a Lincoln Continental -- for 20 
years. The car had only 42,000 miles on the odometer when she died. 
</P>
<P>
Bezich was so low-key about her money, in fact, that even some friends and 
relatives were surprised at how much she had amassed when one of her bequests 
became public in October. 
</P>
<P>
The San Pedro Peninsula Hospital Foundation announced last month that Bezich 
had left the hospital a $1.2-million endowment. While Bezich had decided years 
earlier to leave money to the hospital -- her sister had been sickly, and 
Bezich was impressed with the care her sister had received at the hospital -- 
the amount was "a very pleasant surprise," said Mary L. Gimenez, executive 
director of the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Bezich also left an endowment to the San Pedro Peninsula YMCA, where she was a 
board member for 20 years, and an unrestricted bequest to another institution 
that was not disclosed by her estate. 
</P>
<P>
While the estate did not publicize the amounts, Ken Bezich, a retired San Pedro 
fisherman who was Jennie Bezich's cousin and closest relative, said she left 
more than $2 million to the Y, which was her pet charity. 
</P>
<P>
"She was sort of a humble person," Ken Bezich said. "She didn't make any 
pretenses of her position. . . . Anyone who knew her would never think" that 
she had money. Ken Bezich received the 1969 Lincoln, the only bequest Jennie 
Bezich made to relatives, family members said. 
</P>
<P>
Of her fortune, Ted C. Springfield, a one-time Van Camp insurance president who 
worked with Bezich for nearly 30 years, said: "She never did spend much, but I 
didn't expect it to be that high." 
</P>
<P>
People who knew Bezich over the years say she had three great interests in 
life, rooted in her association with San Pedro and the Van Camp family: the 
insurance business, her investments and San Pedro charities. She was 
particularly fond of the Y, and after her retirement she often visited there to 
chat with the staff over coffee. 
</P>
<P>
She became a West Coast insurance expert and an executive in a male-dominated 
field. "She was a terrific insurance lady and a stickler for details," 
Springfield recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Bezich could be tough in business, and her height -- 5 feet, 10 inches -- 
helped, according to her sister-in-law, M. B. Bezich of San Pedro. "She said 
she was a success in business because she was so tall she could look a man in 
the eye, point a cigarette at him and say, 'You'd better do that.' " 
</P>
<P>
John Swift, executive director of the Y and a friend who helped care for Bezich 
during her illness, said her politics were staunchly Republican. And while 
"women's libber" was never a label she wore, Swift said, "she bought Susan B. 
Anthony dollars and gave them away to kids," always telling the youngsters that 
Anthony was a leader in the fight to get women the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Swift also recalled Bezich's comment on why she remained single: "Well, I guess 
I never married because the fellow I wanted to live with in perpetuity never 
came along." 
</P>
<P>
Bezich was an avid reader who followed current events and the financial world 
the way many people follow soap operas. Recalled Ken Bezich: "She was a hard 
worker and dedicated investor. She got all the financial sections of the paper 
and had three or four papers in front of her all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Bezich is remembered by another cousin, Kenneth M. Bezich, as "very 
intelligent, very businesslike, a nice lady who was very cordial. When I was 
going to school, she was always interested in how I was doing, that I was 
continuing my education." 
</P>
<P>
But there was another side to Bezich, who was variously called demanding, 
exacting, even bossy. "Some described her as tough to work for," Swift said. 
"She had extremely high expectations of performance. But she never asked anyone 
to do anything she wouldn't do herself." 
</P>
<P>
If there were spelling mistakes on Y board minutes, Swift said, she would call 
about them. She also didn't hesitate to telephone presidents of companies in 
which she held stock if she had complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Bezich also kept notes of things she had asked people to do, and if they didn't 
do them, she'd call with a reminder. "Memory is fine, but notes are better" was 
a favorite Bezich remark, Swift said. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1977 interview after her retirement, Bezich recalled advice from her 
father: "He told me just because someone else might not be working hard was no 
reason for me to follow suit. Do the best you can; never mind what others are 
doing." About her own career, she said: "I just went about and did the best I 
could at whatever I had to do." 
</P>
<P>
Swift said he used to ask Bezich if she didn't want to spend some of her money 
on herself. She answered no, he said, explaining that her pleasure came from 
controlling her investments. "She got great joy out of reading the daily stock 
market report to see what she had gained or lost," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, San Pedro is the beneficiary of Bezich's financial success. 
</P>
<P>
"She directed the Y endowment committee for years," Swift said. "The strongest 
case she made was that people should put money into endowments. The principal 
would never be touched. She was adamant about this." 
</P>
<P>
Added Swift: "A lot of people do this before they die, for recognition. She 
didn't. She was a quiet one."

YULE TREE MAGNATE MEANS BUSINESS; 
</P>
<P>
COMPETITION: CRITICS SAY STU MILLER, WHO HAS BUILT AN EVERGREEN EMPIRE, IS A 
GOLIATH TRYING TO SQUASH RIVALS. MILLER SAYS HE JUST DEMANDS FAIR PLAY. 
</P>

<P>
Christmas tree magnate Stu Miller -- who turned a $4,000 savings into one of 
the largest Christmas tree retailing businesses in the state -- didn't build 
his evergreen empire by being a nice guy. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas trees are nothing more than a commodity," said Miller, whose company 
now operates about 50 lots around the state, including eight in the San 
Fernando Valley and 13 elsewhere in Los Angeles. "Nobody has ever applied good 
business practices to the Christmas tree business before." 
</P>
<P>
To help his enterprise take root and grow over the last decade, Miller has sued 
competitors and violated a promise with a Christian organization not to sell on 
their property on Sundays, court records show. People who live near his main 
lot say he has bullied them when they complain about traffic and late-night 
work on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Miller filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Community College 
District to try to stop farmer Joe Cicero from selling trees from his fruit and 
vegetable stand at Pierce College, which is across the street from a Miller and 
Sons lot. 
</P>
<P>
But Miller, 48, an affable man who opened his first lot in Granada Hills as a 
teen-ager in 1961, resents the characterization that he is a Goliath cruelly 
strong-arming tiny competitors. 
</P>
<P>
All he wants, he said, is fair play. And he is willing to go to court to ensure 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to abide by the same fair-business practices that we have to," he 
said, shaking his fist for emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
Miller denies that he deliberately violated his contract with Valley Cathedral, 
a Christian counseling organization whose parking lot he rented to sell trees 
during the 1985 season. 
</P>
<P>
In the contract, Miller agreed not to conduct business on the ministry property 
on Sundays. But for two consecutive Sundays, the lot was open for tree sales. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James Coppedge, Valley Cathedral minister, said in a court affidavit that 
Miller's son admitted he knew the lease prohibited any Sunday sales but said 
his father ordered him to sell anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Cathedral won a temporary restraining order prohibiting further Sunday 
transactions, but by the time it was granted, only one Sunday remained until 
the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
After Christmas, Coppedge asked Miller why he had broken his promise. 
</P>
<P>
"He thought the Lord wanted him to succeed in business, and I got the 
impression that he thought that whatever he had to do to do that, that's what 
his duty was," Coppedge said. "Break a contract if you need to, but sell those 
trees -- that's what his philosophy was." 
</P>
<P>
Miller maintains, however, that he misunderstood the contract and thought the 
prohibition applied only to Sunday mornings. He said he never would have rented 
a lot that forbade all business all day Sundays because 65% of Christmas tree 
sales occur on weekends, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very smart businessman and he understands the court system and 
litigation," William Norland, vice president of academic affairs at Pierce 
College, said of Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce administrators first dealt with Miller in 1985, when he sold Christmas 
trees wholesale to the Pierce College Associated Students Organization. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was, Norland said, Miller sold the trees to the students at close 
to the retail price -- and the stands were sold at the exact retail price -- so 
the campus made only $1,500 to $1,800 in profit. 
</P>
<P>
Miller refused to disclose any information about his finances. However, when 
Cicero sold trees at the site last year, he earned $22,000 in profits. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd never done anything like this before, and we didn't know if it was a good 
price or a bad price," Norland said. "It's hard for me to say he took advantage 
of us. Had we been highly efficient and understood the Christmas tree operation 
better, we probably could have done better." 
</P>
<P>
This year, Norland said, Miller filed a lawsuit against the community college 
district to force school administrators to order Joe Cicero -- who farms 15 
acres of Pierce land -- to stop selling Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
Cicero and the college have developed a mutually beneficial relationship over 
the years, with Cicero providing technical support and equipment for the 
school's agriculture program, Norland said, and tree sales helped him keep his 
little farming operation viable. 
</P>
<P>
But Miller's lawsuit charged that the district should have taken public bids 
for the right to sell trees on the property. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid a protracted legal battle with Miller, the district prohibited Cicero 
from selling trees on the site this year, Norland said. Now, however, the 
college is engaged in a legal battle with Cicero, who began tree sales this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Without Miller's lawsuit, the college would probably have allowed Cicero to 
sell the trees, Norland said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller defended his action against the college district, saying that if the 
college wasn't willing to open the process to a public bid, then it wasn't fair 
for anyone to sell trees there. 
</P>
<P>
Miller made a similar argument to California State University Northridge 
officials in 1985, which Oregon farmer Jack Price said resulted in his eviction 
from the Devonshire Downs fairgrounds on campus, where he and his family had 
been selling trees for six years. 
</P>
<P>
Price, who now peddles his trees on the Woodland Hills Little League field, 
said that after Miller kicked up a fuss, the university kicked him off the land 
but out of courtesy did not allow any other tree sales there. 
</P>
<P>
If Miller had won the right to use the site, Price said, "he would have gotten 
all our customers." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he believes his portrayal by competitors as a mean-spirited 
Christmas Scrooge stems from resentment over his success. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting hard to be successful in this country anymore," he said. "America 
is turning away from people becoming successful. There is a widening gap 
between rich and poor these days, and when you are successful, you are looked 
upon differently." 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, Miller filed a slander suit against Price after 
Price allegedly suggested in a 1981 meeting of Christmas tree growers that 
Miller had bribed a district official in order to obtain a lease on some 
government land in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claimed that Price had slandered him because he was "greatly angered 
by the competition" and "harbored ill-will" toward Miller. The suit, which was 
dismissed by a Van Nuys Superior Court judge in 1988, sought $750,000 in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he does not remember the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I have gotten this far by hard work. We were very small, too, once, and we 
were subjected to the same bidding process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's venture into the Christmas tree business began when he helped out a 
few friends at their father's lot during the 1960 Christmas season. At the end 
of the season, he received $400. 
</P>
<P>
The next year he invested his $4,000 savings in his first lot at Devonshire 
Street and Zelzah Avenue in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1980, Miller never operated more than five lots in a season, and the 
company was just a "mom and pop operation that gave us extra money." He bought 
his trees wholesale in downtown Los Angeles, and most of his income came from 
his work as a carpenter and from his television rental business. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the 1982 season, Miller opened his first three "volume lots" -- lots 
with low prices that did not provide extensive customer services. It proved to 
be a successful formula. This year the company expects to sell half a million 
trees on 50 lots around the state. 
</P>
<P>
Miller also owns nearly 3,000 acres of Oregon Christmas tree farmland. One day, 
he said, he hopes to have 200 "Stu Miller Price-Is-Right" lots in California. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his tree lots, which he expects will move half a million trees 
this season, Miller owns a development company, which is building seven luxury 
houses in Malibu. He also started a production company and owns a chain of 
television rental stores. 
</P>
<P>
Miller admits that in the process of making his tree business thrive, he has 
sometimes done things that others have not liked. 
</P>
<P>
For example, last year, Miller and Sons employees stood near Joe Cicero's tree 
stand at Pierce College and passed out flyers advertising their own lot across 
the street. Miller said he felt that potential customers mistakenly thought 
they were supporting the college by buying a tree there. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who live next to Miller's lot at Parthenia Street and Balboa 
Boulevard complain that employees work there flocking trees very late into the 
night and in the wee hours of the morning. And traffic generated by the lot has 
sometimes made it virtually impossible for them to reach their own houses, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When homeowners have tried to discuss the problems with Miller, however, he 
brushed off their concerns, said one neighbor who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, however, said the homeowners were just unhappy because they oppose any 
tree lot and the commotion it generates near their houses. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an old saying in business: We don't know the total answer for 
success, but we do know the answer for failure -- trying to please everyone," 
he said. "You can't please everyone."

The Banning Residence Museum in Wilmington is re-creating a lavish Victorian 
Christmas today. Things will be just as they might have been a century ago for 
the family and guests of Wilmington founder Phineas Banning. 
</P>
<P>
The event, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., will feature music by costumed carolers, 
bell ringers and a dulcimer player; a storyteller will entertain children, and 
Santa Claus will arrive in a carriage. Aromas of baking will fill the mansion's 
kitchen, and there will be demonstrations of old-fashioned doll making, 
quilting, wreath making and ornamental gardening. 
</P>
<P>
"The visitor will find a 19th-Century house in enthusiastic anticipation of the 
holiday," said Cathy Partridge, coordinator of the fifth annual party being put 
on by 100 museum volunteers. A 12-foot tree with re-created Victorian 
decorations will adorn the living room of the elegant 1864 mansion, and a 
romantic midnight supper will be laid out amid the sumptuous furnishings of the 
master bedroom. A Victorian dollhouse and the sounds of an antique music box 
will provide other authentic touches. Fresh greens and flowers will festoon 
both the home and the carriage barn, where the museum shop will sell glass, 
wood and pewter ornaments, and other gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Admission will be a $5 donation, with children under 12 free. The museum is at 
401 East M St. in Banning Park. GERALD FARIS

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 HELD IN TEEN-AGER'S SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Inglewood teen-ager who was shot in the stomach and head during an argument 
Thursday evening died Friday at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Hawthorne police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Guadalupe Enriquez, 18, was a passenger in a car when he became involved 
in an argument with two youths in another car at Imperial Highway and Truro 
Avenue about 8 p.m., Hawthorne Police Detective Mike Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
As the argument escalated, Lee said, Enriquez got out of the car. He was shot 
twice before his assailants drove away. No one else was injured, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne police later arrested David Perez, 18, of Hawthorne, and Abel Gaeta, 
18, of Inglewood. The two youths were being held at the Hawthorne jail, Lee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the victim nor the two suspects are known gang members, Lee said. The 
shooting "started as a verbal confrontation," Lee said, and "doesn't appear to 
be gang-related at this time."

FIRM TO STUDY FIRE ASSESSMENT COST; 
</P>
<P>
PALOS VERDES ESTATES: COUNCIL'S HIRING OF A CONSULTANT IS A STEP TOWARD 
REPLACING TWO PARCEL TAXES WITH AN ASSESSMENT DISTRICT TO FUND CITY PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palos Verdes Estates council members last week approved a $25,000 contract with 
San Diego-based BSI Consultants Inc., which will determine how much homeowners 
would have to pay for fire services if a special assessment district is formed. 
</P>
<P>
The council's move is aimed at eliminating two parcel taxes that residents now 
pay to help fund emergency services and parks and street improvements. Council 
members have expressed concern that should the taxes ever be voted down by 
residents, the city would find itself strapped for funds. 
</P>
<P>
The two taxes, known as Propositions A and B, are staggered and voted on every 
four years. This fiscal year, the taxes are expected to generate $1.9 million 
in revenue, about one-quarter of the city's budget. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the $1.9 million goes to pay for fire services under a contract with 
Los Angeles County. Although forming an assessment district and letting the 
parcel taxes expire would raise about $50,000 less, the difference could be 
made up by belt-tightening moves, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The notion (behind the assessment district) is that you have some 
predictability and some stability in your funding structure," City Manager 
James Hendrickson said. 
</P>
<P>
Under its contract with the city, BSI will determine precisely how much 
individual property owners would pay to an assessment district. The average 
homeowner would probably pay less than he or she presently pays in parcel 
taxes, Hendrickson said. 
</P>
<P>
However, because assessments would be based on property size, some homeowners 
would pay more than others, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city plans to mail the individual assessments to property owners within the 
next few months, city officials said. A public hearing on the matter will then 
be held in March or April. 
</P>
<P>
If fewer than 5% of the city's property owners file written protests, the 
council could move ahead and form the assessment district. If more than 5% but 
less than 33% protest, the city is required by state law to put the matter 
before voters. If more than 33% protest, the council must abandon the plan.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FLORES SEEKS TO CLOSE SCRAP YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores has asked city zoning officials to 
consider declaring a San Pedro scrap yard a nuisance and eventually move for 
its closure, unless steps are taken to reduce noise, traffic and debris. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Zoning Administrator Bob Janovici, Flores said the action 
against Hiuka America Corp. follows four years of complaints about its 
operations from community residents and business leaders. The 20-acre yard, 
which opened in 1986, is at 2100 N. Gaffey St., just off the Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Flores' action follows months of talks with company officials, who have argued 
that Hiuka has done all it can to reduce noise, traffic and other effects, 
while searching for a more suitable location.

PARKING BAN LIFTED TO HELP SHOP OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials will offer a holiday gift to shop owners on western Ventura 
Boulevard this week by temporarily lifting an afternoon parking ban that shop 
owners said deterred potential customers. 
</P>
<P>
For the last month and a half, parking has been prohibited on the south side of 
Ventura Boulevard between Topanga Canyon Boulevard and De Soto Avenue between 3 
and 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The ban was imposed by Mayor Tom Bradley as part of an effort to improve the 
flow of traffic on the busy thoroughfare during peak commuter hours. 
</P>
<P>
Similar restrictions have been enacted along other stretches of Ventura 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
But Woodland Hills business owners complained that the parking ban has driven 
customers away. In a meeting last month, they appealed to city officials to 
lift the prohibition, at least for the holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
"They were essentially shutting their businesses down at 3 p.m.," said Bob 
Gross, president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization. "The 
restrictions would totally destroy the holiday shopping season." 
</P>
<P>
Area residents said they were also affected by the restrictions because 
frustrated shoppers instead parked along residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, city transportation officials lifted the parking restrictions for 
the month of December in response to community concerns, said Rosalind Wayman, 
a deputy for City Councilman Marvin Braude. 
</P>
<P>
This week, workers from the Department of Transportation will cover the parts 
of the signs that restrict parking in the afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
Wayman said that city officials intend to reinstate the ban in January. Gross 
said that community members hope to persuade city officials to drop the 
afternoon parking restriction for good.

EPA MISSES DEADLINE FOR SEWAGE RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal Environmental Protection Agency missed a congressional deadline 
last week for a decision on whether to require more intensive treatment of 
sewage being pumped into the ocean off the Palos Verdes Peninsula at a rate of 
380 million gallons a day. 
</P>
<P>
Under an amendment to an appropriations bill signed into law last month, 
Congress told the EPA to decide by Nov. 30 whether to exempt the giant Los 
Angeles County Sanitation Districts sewage plant in Carson from tighter 
treatment standards. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was enacted at the request of U.S. Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa 
Monica), who says a federal ruling on the exemption is long overdue. But the 
EPA never promised to meet the deadline, telling The Times last month that it 
was considering the sanitation districts' request for a waiver "as 
expeditiously as we can." 
</P>
<P>
The sanitation districts, which expressed fear last month that the time limit 
would hurt its chances to receive a fair hearing, welcomed news that the EPA 
had not produced a ruling by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think science responds particularly well to deadlines," sanitation 
districts spokesman Joe Haworth said Saturday. "We're grateful that at least 
they're taking their time to make a decision."

PADRES SPORT NEW LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The familiar scent of cigar smoke, which has hovered over the Padre camp the 
past decade, is infiltrating another lobby at major league baseball's annual 
winter meetings. 
</P>
<P>
It's Saturday afternoon, the unofficial opening day of trade season, so where 
else would you expect to find Jack McKeon, the man they call Trader? 
</P>
<P>
For weeks now, McKeon has been jotting players' names on notebook pads, talking 
to scouts and club officials, preparing for the most grandiose week of baseball 
that doesn't include a game. 
</P>
<P>
It's where deals are made that can make or break a team. It's where McKeon once 
made a deal while standing in the checkout line of a hotel. It's where McKeon 
last year picked up outfielder Joe Carter and signed free agents Craig Lefferts 
and Fred Lynn all in the span of 13 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"The funny thing is that I've been sitting around the last few weeks still 
making deals," McKeon said, "but I have nobody to make them for." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since 1949, McKeon is out of professional baseball. He is 
affiliated with no team. He has no job. He has nowhere to go since being fired 
in September as general manager of the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured this is where I belong, anyway," McKeon said. "It'll give me a 
chance to talk baseball again. Maybe I'll be a trade broker, you know, 
consulting for teams. Who knows, maybe even the Padres will be asking for 
advice." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, McKeon's primary purpose, he said, will be to help find jobs for 
several of the 31 front-office personnel who were fired in wake of McKeon's 
dismissal. Also attending the meetings will be Bill Beck, former assistant 
general manager; Tom Romenesko, former director/player personnel; Bill McKeon, 
former scout; and Jack Krol, former minor league manager. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the thing that irritates me most," McKeon said. "These were good 
people who were fired simply because they shook hands with me or said hello to 
me. It was like whoever knew me was axed. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows, maybe it was all a blessing in disguise. In the long run, the 
ownership will find out where the problems are, and I guarantee you, it wasn't 
on the baseball side." 
</P>
<P>
There's a new kid on the Padres' block now, and his name is Joe McIlvaine. 
While McKeon treated the winter meetings as Santa Claus, daring to bring home 
anything and everything, McIlvaine is perceived as the grinch who stole 
Christmas. The disparities between the two general managers are staggering: 
</P>
<P>
 -- McKeon, 60, is the focus of attention at these meetings, telling the world 
what he wants to do, instructing ownership to keep their checkbooks ready; 
McIlvaine, 43, works in quiet, mysterious ways, and is more interested in a 
$20,000 prospect than a $20 million free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 -- McKeon creates illusions of grandeur, providing hope for a championship 
season; McIlvaine promises nothing, vowing only that the Padres will be 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 -- McKeon, if still general manager, undoubtedly would be talking about the 
prospects of signing free agents such as center fielder Willie McGee, pitcher 
Bob Welch and third baseman Terry Pendleton; McIlvaine is talking publicly 
about no one. 
</P>
<P>
 -- McKeon used minor-league players as trade bait, willing to trade any of 
them for a veteran; McIlvaine treasures his farm system and wants the minor 
leagues to be the foundation of the Padre future. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon, 60, wears pullover shirts, casual slacks and smokes cigars; McIlvaine, 
43, wears dark, pin stripe suits and doesn't smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Two different men. Two different personalities. And two vastly different 
philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
How times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
McIlvaine, although still residing in New York until moving out to Del Mar in 
January, can hear the grumblings 3,000 miles away from Padre fans. He's 
recognizes that this is new to them. He realizes that they're accustomed to big 
talk, big plans, and big predictions. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, he's not going to change. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack wants to be the center of attention all of the time," McIlvaine said, 
"that's just not my style. My style is not to be the focal point. The problem 
is that when you reveal your plans, then everybody expects you to do those 
things. I'll try to get things done probably by trying to wear people down." 
</P>
<P>
If McKeon were still in charge, surely, the meetings would be different. But 
then again, McKeon firmly believes that the team he assembled a year ago is 
capable of vying for the National League West division title. McIlvaine 
believes differently. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people have the perception that I'm pooh-poohing the free-agent 
market," McIlvaine said, "but I'm not. I'm talking to agents. It's just anybody 
who is a a Type A or Type B free agent requires us got give up our second-round 
draft choice, and I'm not willing to do that right now. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody signs a (Type) A or B player, he's going to have to make a 
significant impact, and move a team up in the standings. And I'm not willing to 
go into the free-agent market and sign someone to be a role player or an extra 
player. 
</P>
<P>
"I just won't do it." 
</P>
<P>
McIlvaine instead has limited his free-agent talks with Type C players, whose 
signing would mean no forfeiture of draft picks. Perhaps the player with the 
biggest profile whom has attracted interest from the Padres is first baseman 
Sid Bream, formerly of the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had preliminary discussions with the Padres," said Mike Moye, Bream's 
agent, "and have given them an idea of what Sid's value should be. But the 
Padres might have trouble with the timing, and that's where they're in a bind." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' dilemma is the timing of the new-look free agent period for first 
baseman Jack Clark, which is expected to commence in January. The Padres have 
offered him a one-year, $2.5 million contract to stay, but are unwilling to 
provide him with a two-year deal. Clark finds it unacceptable, and if another 
team provides him with a multi-year contract during the new-look free agent 
period, Clark says he likely will leave. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's a guy who's our first baseman and cleanup hitter," McIlvaine said, "and 
you just don't know what's going to happen. The timing is unfair. The 
free-agency period should have been resolved already. It's tough to go out and 
make other plans. 
</P>
<P>
"I could sign Sid Bream, sure, but with Jack Clark stays with us. Then what are 
we going to do, platoon them, and have two unhappy players? We're going to have 
to wait." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres instead will focus on other pressing issues, such as finding a 
right-handed bullpen stopper to complement Craig Lefferts, coming up with a 
starting shortstop and looking to see what's available at third base. 
</P>
<P>
If unsuccessful, McIlvaine said, a starting pitcher, perhaps Mike Dunne, likely 
will be converted into a reliever; Garry Templeton will remain the starting 
shortstop; and Bip Roberts will be the everyday third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
But even though there certainly are not any right-handed relievers available 
that are going to have fans making a mad rush for the season-ticket window, 
there are some intriguing possibilities at shortstop and third base. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop candidates: Shawon Dunston, Chicago Cubs; Gary Sheffield, Milwaukee; 
Jose Uribe, San Francisco; and Omar Vizquel, Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Third-base candidates: Ken Caminiti, Houston; Craig Worthington, Baltimore; 
Brook Jacoby, Cleveland; and Jack Howell, Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"The trouble is there's not a whole lot we have back to offer," McIlvaine said. 
"When I was with the Mets, we had a cavalry of players to trade. I don't have 
that cavalry here." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres have already informed clubs that there are certain players they just 
refuse to deal: right fielder Tony Gwynn, left fielder Joe Carter, catcher 
Benito Santiago, second baseman Roberto Alomar and starting pitchers Andy 
Benes, Bruce Hurst, Ed Whitson and Greg Harris. And unless McIlvaine is 
overwhelmed, Roberts and Lefferts aren't going anywhere, either. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a miracle that awaits? 
</P>
<P>
"You never know what you're going to come up with," McIlvaine said. "I remember 
in the '83 winter meetings, we had Carlos Diaz coming off a career year, and we 
went to talk to the Dodgers. This is when Steve Howe had the drug problem, and 
they badly needed a left-handed reliever. And we really liked Sid Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
"We walked into the Dodgers' suite, and I looked at (Al) Campanis, and said, 
'Al, how about if we trade your Hawaiian for our Hawaiian.' Campanis looked at 
us funny, and then kicked us out. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, 20 minutes later Tommy Lasorda calls us and tells us to come back to the 
room. Tommy apparently convinced Al that he had to have a left-hander, and this 
was the guy he wanted. A couple hours later, it was a done deal." 
</P>
<P>
Diaz's career was over three seasons later; Fernandez since has won 78 games, 
and is considered one of the league's finest left-handed starters. 
</P>
<P>
He'll likely never be called Trader, and a cigar won't be found in his mouth, 
but McIlvaine may be all right. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's a good man for the job," McKeon said. "If anyone was going to 
replace me, I'm glad it's him. You know, it's funny, in hindsight, I never 
should have left the field at the (All-Star) break. I was doing what I thought 
was best for the club, and look where it could have got me. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have been a pretty good team, me and Joe. We would have worked out 
well together. I think we would have gotten a lot of things accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope they let Joe go about his job without interference, or he's going 
to find the same problems I did, believe me."

JETS MAY BE RESPITE FOR WEARY CHARGERS 
</P>

<P>
If one guy from Kansas City and another from Seattle can provoke Chargers tight 
end Arthur Cox into committing a pair of personal fouls, what might 45 guys 
from New York get him to do today? 
</P>
<P>
Cox kicked a defender two weeks ago and spit at another last week in receiving 
two of the 18 penalties assessed against the suddenly down and dirty Chargers 
(5-7). 
</P>
<P>
In addition to losing their cool recently, the Chargers have dropped 
consecutive AFC West Division games to fall out of the playoff race. They are 
coming off a devastating 13-10 overtime loss to the Seahawks, and have had a 
difficult time this week shucking aside the memory of a Sunday night nationally 
televised game gone sour. 
</P>
<P>
"The concern after last week is it was such a disappointment, how do guys come 
back?" General Manager Bobby Beathard said. 
</P>
<P>
Well, they get a break today from the schedule-makers and will play the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Thank heaven for the Jets (4-8). When the Chargers were at their very lowest 
earlier this season following a 36-14 loss to Pittsburgh, they went into Giants 
Stadium and pounded on the Jets, 39-3. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the Chargers' offense, and how it has struggled, and then take note: 
The Chargers have outscored the Jets' offense, 23 touchdowns to 18. Quarterback 
Billy Joe Tolliver has thrown more touchdown passes (12) and been sacked fewer 
times (16) than the Jets' Ken O'Brien (8 TDs, 30 sacks). 
</P>
<P>
Even Arthur Cox will like these guys. The Jets rank 23rd in the NFL on defense, 
while the Chargers stand fifth. On offense, the Jets have scored only one 
touchdown on offense in the last 12 quarters of play. The Jets have lost three 
games in a row and six of their last eight. 
</P>
<P>
"We went back to Pittsburgh when they hadn't scored any touchdowns, and we went 
to Kansas City when they hadn't scored many touchdowns," defensive coordinator 
Ron Lynn said, "and for us to fall into that kind of trap is ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
"They got too many weapons. If wide receiver Al Toon is playing you know that's 
a big-time player, and Rob Moore is living up to everything everybody thought 
he would be coming out of college. 
</P>
<P>
"We have immense respect for running backs Blair Thomas and Freeman McNeil, and 
Johnny Hector certainly isn't getting enough playing time," Lynn said. "Hey, 
it's typical of this league: Who would have given the Rams any chance of 
beating the 49ers last week? I don't think you can go by any previous 
encounter, records or any of that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers scored 37 unanswered points in an Oct. 14th collision with the 
Jets. They gained 412 yards on offense to the Jets' 148, and ran for 224 yards, 
while New York managed but 95 on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
A walk in the park . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We soundly beat Seattle the first time and what happened the next time?" 
safety Vencie Glenn said. "When a team gets humiliated like the Jets did, you 
know they're going to come in with a grudge and something to prove." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Jets were thumped 24-7 by Pittsburgh, and after the game 
first-year coach Bruce Coslet suggested it might be a time for change on 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a lack of confidence in ourselves," Coslet said, after the 
Jets penetrated inside the Steelers' 34-yard line but once. "I don't think 
we're as confident as we were early in the season. We have to get the 
confidence back in our own ability and the execution. I think we're playing a 
little tentative, playing afraid to make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien started for the Jets and was relieved by Tony Eason after completing 9 
of 17 passes for 117 yards with a pair of interceptions. Eason was 1 of 5 for 5 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
After thinking about making a change in starting quarterbacks, Coslet elected 
to stay with O'Brien, who completed 4 of 11 for 56 yards in the Jets' loss to 
the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets came together at the beginning of the week for a team meeting. "I 
didn't feel the same excitement out there," said JoJo Townsell, who called the 
meeting. "It would be nice to end the season strong. I don't want to see a 4-8 
team become a 4-12 team." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, meanwhile, are looking ahead to a bye and then a stretch drive 
that includes road games against the Broncos and the Raiders sandwiched around 
a home game with the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
They are playing the Jets a second time because of having the luxury of playing 
this year's fifth-place schedule. To date, they have compiled a 2-1 record 
against fifth-place teams, and are touchdown favorites to make it 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our guys are going to be fired up," Beathard said. "Each week we find 
out something about this team, and unfortunately this is a way to see how it 
will come back from a disappointing loss like last week's. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is pride; I talked to a couple of players and asked their 
feelings and they had no doubts the team would be really up for this game. I 
hope I'm not reading wrong, but I think we'll bounce back emotionally from last 
week." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have the added incentive of pushing running back Marion Butts over 
the 1,000-yard mark this season. Butts, the NFL's leading rusher in just his 
second season, has 995 yards on 217 carries. In the first game with the Jets, 
he ran for 121 yards on 26 rushes. 
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere is going to be a little bit different than the last couple of 
weeks," safety Martin Bayless said, "but we still got to go out and win. We 
were in the playoff race and had two games just past before our face. But we 
have to stay focused and end on a high note."

TRAKAS' GAME IS TRYING, AND EMOTIONAL, TO BOOT

<P>
The spotlight in Saturday's nationally televised Miami-San Diego State game was 
supposed to be reserved for two of the nation's top gunslingers, Craig Erickson 
and Dan McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson and McGwire didn't disappoint. They combined to throw for 607 yards 
and four touchdown passes in Miami's 30-28 victory at San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But Erickson and McGwire had to step aside for awhile in the fourth quarter -- 
eight minutes and 25 seconds to be exact -- while an unsuspecting 5-8, 
180-pound kicker from Patrick Henry High took center stage. 
</P>
<P>
It was the kind of show Andy Trakas normally would love to have headlined. All 
year he had been kicking his little heart out in obscurity. He had made all 51 
of his extra points and connected on 16 of 21 field goals, including his last 
11 coming into Saturday's game. But most of his 99 points were lost in blowouts 
one way or another. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday started out the same way. Trakas kicked field goals of 25 and 43 yards 
in the first half to extend his streak to 13, but SDSU still trailed 30-20 
heading into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But a funny thing happened in the fourth quarter, Trakas found himself in the 
middle of a football game. 
</P>
<P>
And the coach kept calling his name. His odyssey began with 14:04 left in the 
game with a 38-yarder that went wide right. It continued 2 1/2 minutes later 
with a 47-yarder that barely missed left. And the show mercifully ended with a 
54-yard attempt that had the distance, but was wide left. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Trakas was through, SDSU was still behind, 30-20, with 5:39 left in 
the fourth quarter. The Aztecs rallied to score one more touchdown, but the 
damage had been done. 
</P>
<P>
And nobody felt worse about it than Trakas. 
</P>
<P>
"That stuff happens, but it's kind of sad it happened in a game like this," 
Trakas said. "I let down the seniors. It was a bad learning experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you're on top of the world in this business and other times you're 
where I am. They say bad things come in threes. I guess that was true today." 
</P>
<P>
Trakas said he had a day that he could have never envisioned when he awoke 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a chance to kick five field goals before," he said. "But I was 
a factor today and I just had to be ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
All three misses were painful, but Trakas said only the first one felt like it 
was wide. 
</P>
<P>
"The first one was my fault," he said. "I just didn't get the right footing and 
missed it." 
</P>
<P>
But Trakas said the 47-yarder could have gone either way. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the second one was good," he said. "It was a 50-50 call, but you 
can't sing sad songs now." 
</P>
<P>
The final attempt almost didn't happen. With fourth and 10 on Miami's 36, 
Trakas trotted onto the field, but SDSU Coach Al Luginbill called the last of 
his timeouts, which he could have desperately used in the last minute, and 
Trakas was summoned to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
But after Luginbill thought about it for a minute, Trakas reappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill's thinking on attempting a 54-yarder 10 points down with 5:39 left, 
with a kicker who had a missed his last two field goals: 
</P>
<P>
"We needed points," Luginbill said. "He had just (barely) missed previously. I 
thought the percentages would be with us. He's capable of kicking it." 
</P>
<P>
Trakas thought he was more than capable. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good kicking from 60 yards," he said. "I'd like to thank Coach 
Luginbill for having the faith in me. I'm just sorry I let him down." 
</P>
<P>
But Trakas is only a sophomore and he realizes he will have many more 
opportunities to decide games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad way to end the season, and I feel like I really let the team down," 
he said. 'But I just have to look forward to next year. It's all I can do now." 
</P>

The Gulls never fully recovered from an early deficit and fell 5-4 in the last 
of their six-game road series in an International Hockey League game seen by 
14,999 Saturday night at the Bradley Center. The crowd was the fifth largest in 
the 45-year history of the league. 
</P>
<P>
The Admirals (11-10-2) jumped to a 3-0 lead, paced by Dave Mackey's 
back-to-back goals at 1:22 at 2:48 in the first period. It marked the 20th time 
in 26 games the Gulls have been scored on first. 
</P>
<P>
Mackey's second goal was with Milwaukee playing short handed. It was the first 
of two short-handed goals the Gulls (13-11-2, 4-2 on this road trip) allowed 
for the night. For the season, they have given up five. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls pulled to 3-2 when Bob Jones scored a short handed goal at 4:25 in 
the second, and teammate Clark Donatelli got his 10th goal on the power play at 
9:42, with an assist by Derek Mayer, which extended his scoring streak to 10 
games in a row.

LOW DOWN PAYMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert J. Bruss' comments concerning the advantages of making minimum down 
payment when buying a home ("The Benefits of a Small Down Payment," Nov. 18) 
are not generally correct. 
</P>
<P>
If you have $20,000 and decide to put only $10,000 down on a house, you will be 
poorer unless the remaining $10,000 can be invested at a rate equal to or 
greater than your mortgage rate. 
</P>
<P>
(Both must be compared on an after-tax basis.) 
</P>
<P>
The concept on which this example is based is that of multiple rates of return 
on investment, discussed usually within the first three chapters of most of 
today's university-level principles of finance textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, Bruss' observation is correct that a minimum home down 
payment does reduce the buyer's risk. However, the buyer's reduced risk is the 
banker's increased risk. Increased risk usually demands an increased return. If 
banks are doing business according to sound financial principles, the higher 
risk should demand a higher mortgage rate (or more points). 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, observation would suggest that most banks may not require 
additional premium for additional risk -- to the benefit of a few, and to the 
detriment of many!

LOW DOWN PAYMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It certainly makes no sense to borrow at a rate of 12% to keep cash invested at 
8%. 
</P>
<P>
If this is the case, a maximum down payment is best. If the mortgage rate is 
lower (which is unlikely), go for the minimum amount down. 
</P>
<P>
But if a buyer can qualify for a 10% mortgage with a higher down payment; he 
would be crazy to pay 12% with a minimum down in order to keep his 8% 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
In Bruss's illustration, the $5,000 profit is correctly calculated as the 
difference between total purchase price (investment) and market value. This 
profit will remain the same dollar amount regardless of the amount of cash paid 
down.

CLAY HOUSE BUILDER IN HARMONY WITH EARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks so much for "Feat of Clay" (by Barbara Moran, Nov. 11) about Joseph 
(Diliberti) and his fired clay home. His uncomplicated way of living and 
ecological awareness is one hopeful vision of the future that does not include 
the doom and gloom projected by many who are witnessing the transforming of our 
techno-society. 
</P>
<P>
Although his life choices will not appeal to everyone, certainly his evident 
ease of spirit, peace and contentment (though by no means complacency) can be 
envied by many. Comfort, as Joseph demonstrates so well, is something quite 
outside Holiday Inn-type conveniences. Living in harmony with nature is a 
process we should look forward to rediscovering. 
</P>
<P>
Our society's widespread feelings of isolation, fear, frustration and malaise 
may find a balm in Joseph's idea of self-sustaining, self-affirming 
communities. And if we can do all this and not have to meet mortgage payments 
too, what more can we ask?

CAR GOING WRONG WAY ON FREEWAY KILLS MAN; 
</P>
<P>
TRAFFIC: IRVINE CIVIL ENGINEER DIES AND HIS WIFE IS INJURED IN COLLISION ON 
INTERSTATE 405 NEAR BRISTOL STREET. THE WRONG-WAY DRIVER ALSO IS HOSPITALIZED.

An Irvine man was killed and two other people critically injured in a fiery 
two-car collision triggered by a confused motorist who drove for miles on the 
wrong side of the San Diego Freeway, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
The 4:20 a.m. accident, which CHP officials believe to be alcohol-related, 
closed all but one lane of the northbound freeway at the Bristol Street 
off-ramp for three hours Saturday, while traffic investigators sorted through 
the wreckage, CHP spokeswoman Linda Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
Sang In Ahn, 50, a civil engineer, was pronounced dead at UCI Medical Center in 
Orange after he was airlifted to the hospital's trauma center, Burrus said. His 
wife, Ook-Ja Ahn, 47, was listed in extremely critical condition at the same 
hospital with fractures and facial injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car heading in the wrong direction was identified as Faith L. 
Robinson, 23, of Huntington Beach, who was taken to Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana for treatment. She was listed in critical condition with 
multiple fractures, including a broken nose and wrist, and other injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"She lost her left eye, and her face was pretty mashed," Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson listed her occupation as bartender in 1989 voter registration records. 
</P>
<P>
Burrus said CHP dispatchers began receiving reports of a motorist driving a 
dark car the wrong way on the northbound lanes of the freeway as far north as 
Westminster. By the time CHP officers were positioned to stop the driver, later 
identified as Robinson, the car had passed the Santa Ana riverbed and Fairview 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
But before units could reach Robinson's dark-blue, 1983 Buick Regal, it slammed 
head-on into Ahn's maroon, 1985 Cadillac Sedan de Ville, Burrus said. Robinson 
was the lone occupant in her car. 
</P>
<P>
"We were only a minute away from catching (Robinson)," Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
The impact was so severe that the Buick exploded in flames, Burrus said. A 
passing motorist jumped out of his car and put the flames out with a fire 
extinguisher before. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, a Toyota pickup truck was unable to stop and struck both mangled 
cars, splitting them apart. The driver of the pickup truck, Corey J. Bailey, 
16, of Huntington Beach, was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
CHP investigators had initially been unable to determine who had been driving 
the wrong way, since witnesses only had sketchy descriptions of the car, Burrus 
said. And by the time officers arrived, the cars were so damaged that it was 
not clear which had been going the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
Burrus said that although the investigation is ongoing, it is believed to be 
alcohol-related. She did not elaborate.

SMALL GROUP SITS AS JURY ON WOULD-BE JUDGES; 
</P>
<P>
APPOINTMENTS: A LITTLE-KNOWN INFORMAL PANEL HAS QUIETLY HELPED THE GOVERNOR 
PICK 11 OF THE 27 JURISTS IN THE COUNTY COURTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past eight years, a small group of influential Ventura County 
Republicans has played a pivotal role in the selection of every new judge in 
the Superior and Municipal courts. 
</P>
<P>
Working out of the public eye, this little-known group of judicial advisers has 
helped pick almost half the judges now serving in the Ventura County courts -- 
its recommendations almost always accepted by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The most influential of the advisers -- according to several sources -- is 
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, who has helped secure judicial appointments 
for nine assistant prosecutors out of the 11 judgeships that have opened up 
since Deukmejian's election in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Bradbury's input, three of the county's top Republican Party 
stalwarts serve as an informal judicial screening panel for Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
They are Paul Leavens of Ventura, former county campaign chairman for 
Deukmejian; Gwen Tillemans of Oxnard, county Republican chairwoman; and 
Katherine H. Haley of Ojai, a major Republican fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
The four have helped give a conservative and prosecution-oriented shape to the 
county's bench for years to come, but whether they will enjoy a similar 
advisory role in the administration of Republican Gov.-elect Pete Wilson 
remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Leavens, Tillemans and Haley say that, in the informal structure of the county 
panel's makeup, they see themselves as a separate panel of political advisers 
to the governor that usually checks with Bradbury before making judicial 
recommendations to Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Leavens is among those who candidly admit that Bradbury is probably the most 
influential of Deukmejian's local advisers, an opinion shared by many in the 
legal community. 
</P>
<P>
"The district attorney in Ventura County, as I recall, is a very influential 
person," said Charles Vogel, president of the California Bar Assn. "I think 
that he's not shy about expressing his views and I think that he will endeavor 
to influence the composition of the court, since it's important to him." 
</P>
<P>
"It is not sufficient for Kay Haley to say, 'Gee, I'd like you to make Chuck 
Campbell a judge now,' " said Wendy Lascher, president of the Ventura County 
Bar Assn., referring to Municipal Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how the governor gets the ideas for choosing who to nominate, and if it 
comes down to one or the other it makes a difference," Lascher added. "I 
suspect Mike Bradbury has had more influence than the rest of those people put 
together." 
</P>
<P>
And Leavens conceded: 
</P>
<P>
"I would never send a recommendation to the governor without checking with 
Mike. He's probably the most influential one of all. He's in and out of the 
courts. He knows who they are." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury downplays his role in picking the county's judges, insisting that the 
governor's office consults the local district attorney on judicial openings in 
every county in California. 
</P>
<P>
That statement is supported by Terry Flanigan, the governor's appointment 
secretary, but disputed by a spokeswoman for Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner in Los 
Angeles, a Democrat, who said Deukmejian never consults Reiner or any other 
Democratic head prosecutors around the state. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm treated no differently than any other district attorney in the state . . . 
the governor's office seeks our input and we provide it if we have the 
pertinent information," Bradbury said. "The governor is clearly his own person 
when it comes to judge appointments and he does not simply rubber-stamp the 
recommendations of others." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Bradbury said that all 11 judges appointed by Deukmejian in the 
last eight years were recommended by him during the initial review process, 
including the nine former prosecutors from Bradbury's office. 
</P>
<P>
All the judges are white, nine of the 11 are Republicans and all but one are 
men. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian appointed five out of the 15 sitting Superior Court judges, 
including Robert C. Bradley in 1984 and Barbara A. Lane, Kenneth R. Yegan, 
Frederick A. Jones and Edwin M. Osborne in 1986. All were elevated from 
Municipal Court positions. Osborne, a Democrat, is now presiding Superior Court 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also installed half of the 12 Ventura County Municipal Court judges, 
including Democrat Herbert Curtis III in 1984, John R. Smiley in 1986, Barry B. 
Klopfer in 1987, Charles W. Campbell Jr. and Ken W. Riley in 1988 and Thomas J. 
Hutchins in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Lane and Smiley, the only non-prosecutors, were appointed from private 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury's influence in the judicial selection process, especially the 
elevation of Municipal Court judges to the Superior Court, brought an 
expression of concern from one expert on legal ethics, Dean Gerald F. Uelmen of 
the Santa Clara University School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a conflict that should preclude him from 
serving on the committee, but I think it's a legitimate concern," Uelmen said. 
"The danger would be that a judge would be more reluctant to rule against the 
D.A. on an issue that comes before him, for fear that it would jeopardize his 
prospects for advancement." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury retorted: 
</P>
<P>
"Gerry's comment is the typical BS that he throws out on this and every other 
issue where he takes a very pro-defense point of view. I've never had any judge 
try and curry favor with me for any reason." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said he has "a fairly combative relationship" with Ventura County's 
judges who dislike the fact that his policy against plea bargaining forces 12% 
to 15% of cases to trial, compared with 5% to 7% in most other counties. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury vehemently insisted he is "not on any committee" and added that "my 
views do not carry the kind of weight people attribute to me." He said that 
Deukmejian's office also consults with Sheriff John V. Gillespie on some 
appointments. Gillespie was out of town and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Each of Deukmejian's judicial appointees in Ventura County began the selection 
process by calling or being recommended by someone on the informal three-member 
review panel, Leavens said. 
</P>
<P>
Panel members never meet to discuss their work, but they often call each other 
and Bradbury to confer on nominees, said Leavens, whose Ventura-based Leavens 
Ranches company owns more than 1,000 acres of citrus and avocado orchards in 
Ventura and Monterey counties. 
</P>
<P>
Each sends a letter of recommendation to Deukmejian's office only "after 
conversing with people that know these people and learning who is 
well-respected, who has a good reputation and who would not embarrass the 
governor," Leavens said. 
</P>
<P>
Haley, a third-generation Ventura County resident described by some as "Mrs. 
Republican" in Ventura County, said she agrees with Leavens' description of 
their work. 
</P>
<P>
"The gist of it is that when there were people who had contacted us that were 
interested in serving as a judge . . . we investigated whether they were 
qualified people who could do the job. We'd write a letter and send it to the 
governor," Haley said. "He wouldn't always take our suggestion." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said that party loyalties play no role in his recommendations to 
Deukmejian. As for the fact that nearly all of Ventura County's judges are 
Republican, he said: 
</P>
<P>
"I have a hunch it's because people that go into law enforcement organizations, 
for example, prosecutors, tend to be Republican. But we've got our share of 
Democrats in the office." 
</P>
<P>
Although the three review panel members do not automatically reject Democrats, 
Leavens and Tillemans said they screen the legal records, family background and 
political views of potential nominees to make sure that they will hew to 
Republican philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
"Through the years, we've had so many judges that were very lenient in so many 
ways . . . so we look for the good Republican principles," Tillemans said. 
Asked to outline the principles that are reflected in nominees' legal briefs 
and judicial rulings, she said, "It's more government by the people than 
government for the people." 
</P>
<P>
However, the three said that they do not delve into nominees' personal lives. 
</P>
<P>
"The kind of people we were talking to were all law-abiding citizens that were 
well-known in the legal community. Besides, isn't that against the law anyway?" 
Haley said. "I never had anybody talk to us that had murdered anybody or threw 
his wife downstairs." 
</P>
<P>
And Leavens said they do not concern themselves with the nominees' drinking 
habits or marital fidelity. "I think those things you wouldn't have to ask 
about. You'd hear about them from other sources. Anybody that wants to go up is 
essentially pretty clean." 
</P>
<P>
The process of settling on a recommendation can take four to six months, said 
Tillemans, who when not working for her party promotes housing developments for 
the Dolphin Group, a Los Angeles-based lobbying and public relations firm with 
strong Republican political connections. 
</P>
<P>
"We go over their resumes and we recommend the ones who we think are suitable 
and then the governor's appointment secretary looks over them and it goes to 
Deukmejian," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But before Deukmejian makes any appointment, each nominee is reviewed by the 
state Judicial Nominees Evaluation Commission, a panel of 20 lawyers and six 
lay people, which does extensive background checks. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called Jenny Commission also reviews a seven-page questionnaire in which 
each nominee lists experience on the bench and at the bar, outlines political 
affiliations and personal history, and answers the question, "Why do you want 
to be a judge?" 
</P>
<P>
Once that process ends, the commission rates each nominee as extremely well 
qualified, well qualified, qualified or "not ready for appointment at this 
time," Flanigan said. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the commission's recommendations and letters on the nominees 
from local bar associations, the governor picks the nominee he feels is best 
suited for the slot, Flanigan said. 
</P>
<P>
But this process could change in January -- after what is sure to be a flurry 
of appointments by the outgoing Deukmejian -- when Sen. Pete Wilson becomes 
governor, legal experts and Wilson associates agree. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has relied on an eight-member merit selection committee to make initial 
recommendations for federal judge appointments in the Central District of 
California. The panel included U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Cynthia 
Holcomb Hall, U.S. District Judge William D. Keller and California Supreme 
Court Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, who also served while a federal district judge. 
</P>
<P>
Although critics on the federal bench challenged the propriety of letting 
federal judges help name their colleagues when the Wilson committee's makeup 
was first revealed in 1986, the panel has continued to advise Wilson on federal 
judicial nominees. Federal judges are appointed by the President upon the 
recommendation of legislators. 
</P>
<P>
And if Wilson's taste in federal judges is any guide, his appointments to the 
state bench will differ to some degree from Deukmejian's, said Vogel, the state 
bar association chief. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears he is impressed with people who have good academic records," Vogel 
said of Wilson. "If you look at his federal appointments, many of them were 
high achievers in college or law school." 
</P>
<P>
Vogel continued, "Deukmejian was the attorney general, he did work with 
prosecutors, he did work with government lawyers. He was pretty proud of them 
and felt somewhat in line with them and felt their expertise in government 
would fit them well in the bench." 
</P>
<P>
However, Wilson's method of weeding out unwanted nominees probably will change 
for state appointees because state law requires nominees to be reviewed by the 
Jenny Commission, said John G. Davies, a San Diego lawyer who served as 
Wilson's judicial selection adviser. 
</P>
<P>
"Deukmejian and all the other governors in my lifetime have had local screening 
committees. I have no idea what Pete's intentions are on that," Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have over 4,000 judicial applications on file for Deukmejian," Flanigan 
said. He predicted the lame-duck governor will fill many of the judicial 
vacancies before leaving office. "I think he'll look at it as his greatest 
legacy." 
</P>
<P>
The retirement last week of Presiding Municipal Judge Lee E. Cooper Jr. 
virtually guarantees that Deukmejian's local advisers will have further impact 
on the bench before Wilson takes office. 
</P>
<P>
The Jenny Commission already has pumped nominees through the pipeline and 
readied them for the governor's final approval, and the local advisers have 
made their recommendations for new openings, Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my sense that Deukmejian will fill every opening that he has available 
before he leaves office because the judiciary was a very important issue for 
him," Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
Once Wilson takes office, he will find the California justice system far larger 
and more of a challenge -- with 1,500 judgeships -- than the federal system he 
is accustomed to, said Flanigan, the governor's appointment secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Flanigan, who has been asked to keep his job through the first year of Wilson's 
term, said that relying on a fixed group of people for input "would not be 
reasonable," even though "there are lawyers and non-lawyers who we may talk to 
in the Deukmejian or future Wilson administration." The ideal situation, he 
said, "is to talk to as broad a group as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Flanigan said the work of local advisers such as Bradbury, Leavens, Tillemans 
and Haley is vital to selecting the nominees that his office sends to the Jenny 
Commission -- that is, the nominees who have a shot at being appointed by the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
"Wilson will follow the same road as Deukmejian in appointing conservative 
judges," Tillemans predicted, "and we're on that governor's council now." 
</P>
<P>
Leavens' wife, Carolyn Leavens, who was chairwoman of Wilson's campaign in 
Ventura County, said she made a recommendation on one of Deukmejian's judicial 
appointees -- a duty she would gladly repeat for Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury, who actively campaigned for Wilson this year, said he is uncertain 
what his role will be in helping the new governor select future Ventura County 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
But he added, "I would hope that Sen. Wilson would continue to seek the input 
of local public officials."

Local judges -- An article Sunday incorrectly reported that all of the 11 local

EXPERTS URGE GANG WATCH IN AFFLUENT AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the affluent, pastoral neighborhoods of Ventura County, gang members "tag" 
or display their hand signs, sport turf colors and speak the language of the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
The Houston Hoods in Thousand Oaks and Westlake, the Moorpark Party Boys and 
the Ventura Skinhead Dogs are known well by experts who study gang behavior or 
work in law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
But the people who live in those communities often deny that such groups exist 
outside the inner cities of Los Angeles, experts said at a seminar in Thousand 
Oaks on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"These gangs are coming up," Milton (Robbie) Robinson, a deputy probation 
officer for Los Angeles County, told about 40 people at Charter Hospital of 
Thousand Oaks. "It's prime area. It's virgin territory. It's easy to 
intimidate." 
</P>
<P>
The daylong seminar was sponsored by Soroptimist International of the Conejo to 
educate teachers, therapists, parents and community members to the warning 
signs of gang behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Families with money are not immune to losing their children to the gang 
culture, Robinson said, because wealthy teen-agers also crave attention, 
respect and excitement. And gang members from Los Angeles can easily prey on 
those people to expand their turf or drug business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson urged his audience to learn the culture to be able to fight it. "We 
should become our own gang," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Washington, D.C., and a probation officer on gang detail for 10 
years, Robinson said he speaks the language of the streets to better understand 
the teen-agers he works with. 
</P>
<P>
"When you confront them and talk the same language as they do, they respect 
you," he said. He pointed out the warning signals of a person's dress, such as 
sagging pants, baseball hats, hair nets and white T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you know what you're fighting with then you can be better equipped," he 
said. "It is based on turf and belonging. . . . This is the family for these 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the seminar, audience members signed up with Crime Stoppers of 
Thousand Oaks or "Youth at Risk," a program in which volunteers take gang 
members camping. 
</P>
<P>
The Conejo Valley and the county need to head off the problem before it grows 
larger, rather than just waiting for drive-by shootings, said Tom Kratochvil, a 
probation officer at a juvenile detention center in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
Some audience members criticized the low turnout at the conference. "We're too 
apathetic," said Pat Yendes, who sits on the board of Crime Stoppers in 
Thousand Oaks. "We're assuming we can leave our doors unlocked." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just apathy," said Bobby Knapp, athletic coordinator for Westlake 
High School. "They really don't believe" that gangs exist in this county. An 
employee at the school for eight years, Knapp said she has seen new students 
enter the Thousand Oaks school as gang members and almost immediately earn the 
respect and admiration of their peers. 
</P>
<P>
"Intimidation is really easy out here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
George-Anne Pollack, who owns an interior decorating business in Thousand Oaks, 
said she used to teach in rough areas of Philadelphia but never encountered the 
violence that she associates now with gang members in her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I look back on the students I had then. They were babes compared to what we 
have here in an upper-middle-class community," she said. "I don't think we take 
it seriously enough here." 
</P>
<P>
Pollack said many in the community dismiss the teen-agers as "wanna-bes," 
students just mimicking gang members. 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson said, "When they say 'wanna-bes,' they're saying 'There's no 
damage here.' "

LIGHTS OUT: FOR 35 YEARS, RESIDENTS ON TELOMA DRIVE HAVE MADE THEIR BLOCK THE 
MOST BRIGHTLY DECORATED IN THE COUNTY. BUT THE MAN WHO BUILT THE STREET REFUSES 
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ANNUAL TRADITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The man who literally built the street that has become the county's most 
brightly decorated neighborhood block during the Christmas season is the only 
resident on his block who refuses to decorate his house. 
</P>
<P>
But 81-year-old Al Faoro insists he is not the Grinch of Ventura's Candy Cane 
Lane. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to put some lights out when they first started," Faoro says. "Then I 
just decided I didn't want to do it anymore. Now, of course, I'm 81 and I have 
arthritis. It's just too much for me." 
</P>
<P>
While some of Faoro's neighbors on Ventura's Teloma Drive say they're puzzled 
at his refusal to participate in what for many of them has become the premier 
neighborhood event of the year, they insist they have no ill feelings toward 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Long ago, the neighbors say, it became clear that Faoro and his wife, Jean, 
were not going to take part in what one resident calls "a two-week-long block 
party." At this time of year, the residents of Candy Cane Lane are really too 
busy to worry about one holdout on their block. 
</P>
<P>
Featuring giant candy canes, outsized Christmas cards, Santa's sleighs and 
Nativity scenes, the Candy Cane Lane light show will begin next Sunday and 
conclude on Christmas night. For two weeks, the lights will blaze on Teloma 
Drive from 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the 35th time the residents of the comfortably middle-class street 
just east of Ventura College have entertained long lines of visitors from as 
far as 100 miles away. The event, which was first staged in 1955, has been 
canceled only once, in 1973, when the lights were turned off because of the 
energy crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, nearly four decades ago Faoro, who lives at 166 Teloma, was the 
prime developer of the block between Telegraph and Loma Vista roads that has 
become a living Christmas card during the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
Faoro, a retired Shell Oil Co. engineer who took up home building as a 
sideline, says he has nothing personal against the neighborhood project. It 
simply isn't for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Let the others do it if they want to," he said. "It's perfectly all right with 
me." 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the Faoros did not attend a recent meeting of residents at the house 
of Candy Cane Lane residents Bob and Carol Cole to plan and assign duties for 
this year's show. 
</P>
<P>
"They're always invited, but I can't recall that they've ever attended," said 
Carol Cole, who has lived on Teloma for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of her neighbors, Cole says she doesn't resent the Faoros for not 
taking part. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no hostility toward them at all. Whatever anybody feels like doing is 
OK with the rest of us. A few years ago, several people didn't decorate because 
they were ill. We all understood. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, one year the vote was 50-50 as to whether we'd have Candy Cane Lane 
at all. But then we decided to go ahead with it, and everybody pitched in." 
</P>
<P>
Cole said that besides the Faoros, another resident of the street, a widow, 
does not feel up to decorating, so Glenn Gooss of 57 Teloma usually decorates 
her house for her. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't pressure anybody," said Gooss, who was among Candy Cane Lane's 
original organizers. "A project like this involves some expense and work, and 
it makes you stick pretty close to home during the holidays, but we feel it's 
worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Another of Candy Cane Lane's residents, Ruby Montgomery, who lives next door to 
the Faoros at 174 Teloma, described Faoro as "a very easygoing, delightful man" 
and joined her neighbors in saying she sees nothing wrong with his refusal to 
decorate his house. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Montgomery, whose husband died early last year, has some reservations 
of her own about being part of the neighborhood effort this year. 
</P>
<P>
Last Christmas, Montgomery decorated her house with the help of her son, who 
also lives in Ventura. But this year, she says that she, too, may leave her 
house dark. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the other people won't resent it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The age of many of Candy Cane Lane's residents is a growing factor in 
determining whether more holiday lights will be dimmed on the street in future 
years. In fact, most of the original residents who still live on the street are 
now in their 70s or 80s. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get as old as I am, it's a burden," said Marion E. Smith, 78, of 126 
Teloma. "Still, I'm going to put the manger scene and the big cross on my front 
lawn as usual." 
</P>
<P>
The 28 houses on Candy Cane Lane don't change hands often, but when they do, 
Smith and his wife, Virginia, are among those who are glad to see younger 
people move in. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Jeff and Lisa Schmoll, both 30, bought their home at 84 Teloma in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Candy Cane Lane was one of the main reasons we moved here," said Jeff Schmoll, 
a Texaco Inc. engineer. "My wife and I have come down this street and enjoyed 
all the lights for years. Now we're a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Al Faoro says he enjoys the lights as much as anybody -- those put up by the 
newer residents as well as the old-timers on the street. 
</P>
<P>
But when he talks about Teloma he obviously prefers to recall the time when he 
helped bring the street into existence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the one who thought of the name, you know -- it combines Telegraph and 
Loma Vista," he said. "And one reason it's so nice here is because I gave the 
houses wide lots -- they're 70 feet wide." 
</P>
<P>
Even though he doesn't light up his house for Christmas, Faoro notes, he did 
help decorate the neighborhood in another way. 
</P>
<P>
"This area used to be a lemon grove, you know. I made a point of leaving lemon 
trees in the back yard of every house I built."

LAGOMARSINO SEES HOPE IN MIDDLE EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER PUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bloodless resolution of the Middle East crisis could herald a new stage of 
international cooperation and global peace, Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino 
(R-Ventura) said Saturday after returning from a five-day trip to the area. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino, traveling as a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, met with top Israeli government officials Thursday and Friday 
following earlier visits with U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia and with Egyptian 
President Hosni Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Arab leaders "believe there is a much better chance after this is 
reconciled to reach full agreement on the Middle East," Lagomarsino said 
Saturday in a telephone interview from Washington D.C. "A lot of them privately 
talk about what can happen later." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet support for the Jan. 15 deadline for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to 
withdraw his troops from Kuwait also shows unprecedented unity, Lagomarsino 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Soviets did not agree to go along with the U.N. resolutions, I doubt we 
would be able to put that kind of force in the field there and move our tanks 
out of Europe," Lagomarsino said. "Hussein probably would have gotten away with 
this two years ago, at least for the short term." 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino said Israeli officials stressed that recent events proved them 
right about Saddam Hussein. The Israeli government sought to contain Hussein 
when it acted as a middleman in the arms-for-hostages swap with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
"They've known for a long time that he's no good and is one of their most 
severe enemies," Lagomarsino said. "They were willing to help the Iranians 
fight this guy because they felt he was a bigger threat than anything." 
</P>
<P>
A trip by Secretary of State James M. Baker III to Baghdad may offer the 
greatest chance yet for a resolution of the international standoff, Lagomarsino 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"For Hussein to face a very high-ranking U.S. government official and be told 
we're not kidding would have to register with him," said Lagomarsino, adding 
that President Bush should call for a vote of Congress on whether its members 
support the Jan. 15 deadline. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER

DISC JOCKEY RISES HIGH TO HELP POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Reynolds went out of his way to encourage people to bring donations of 
canned food for the county's poor -- way out of his way. 
</P>
<P>
The disc jockey lived 35 feet above ground at the Poinsettia Plaza parking lot 
in Ventura for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Being up here grabs people's attention and hopefully reminds them to 
contribute a few cans to Ventura County Food Share," Reynolds said earlier this 
week from his 6-by-8-foot box attached to scaffolding. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the few breaks he took to go to the bathroom, Reynolds stayed inside 
his box 24 hours a day, often amusing himself by waving to passing cars and 
yelling for them to bring in canned food. 
</P>
<P>
But there hadn't been that many respondents. 
</P>
<P>
The response was slower in getting under way this year than last, he said. The 
plight of the homeless and hungry were big social concerns last year, he said, 
but this year the recession and problems in the Persian Gulf have taken over 
the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"I did this last year and the cans were just rolling in," he said. "We ended up 
with about 18,000." This year the effort yielded about 22,714, said one of 
Reynolds' co-workers at KCAQ-FM. Reynolds climbed down from his perch at noon 
Friday. MAJA RADEVICH

GAS: SOME DRIVERS FILLED UP BEFORE NICKEL TAX INCREASE TOOK EFFECT. OTHERS ARE 
CAUGHT UNAWARES. ALMOST ALL ASK, WHAT CAN YOU DO?

<P>
Enough, already! 
</P>
<P>
That was the sentiment expressed by customers at some Orange County service 
stations as they were greeted Saturday morning by the federal government's 
nickel-a-gallon tax increase at the fuel pump. 
</P>
<P>
"I spend a lot of money on gas," said Pedra Salcedo of Santa Ana, who commutes 
every day from housecleaning jobs in Newport Beach. "Now, I'm just going to 
have to work more." 
</P>
<P>
Salcedo, making a fuel stop at the Arco station on Fairview Street and Edinger 
Avenue, said she spends between $20 and $25 each week filling up her small 
pickup. The self-serve price for unleaded was $1.33. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible. We have to work so hard anyway. What can I say? One day it's 
$10 (to fill up) and another day it takes $12." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the station, Julie Wong said business was booming Friday night as 
customers rushed to top off their tanks and beat the increase. Even with 
Saturday's higher prices, Wong said business Saturday remained steady. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody knew about the increase" Friday night, Wong said. "But sales 
have been good today. Maybe it's because it's the day after payday for some 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Just up the street at an Exxon station, there was more customer exasperation as 
Raul Saldivar plunked down $10 to pump just less than 8 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just too much!" the 28-year-old Saldivar said of the $1.35-a-gallon 
price. "I don't know why this has to happen. I hope, somehow, things will get 
better." 
</P>
<P>
At the Mobil station on La Palma Boulevard in Anaheim, an attendant said 
customers are not appeased when informed that the higher prices are the result 
of a tax increase, not an oil price hike. 
</P>
<P>
"They complain a lot," said the attendant, who gave his name only as Ivan. 
"They say it's much too expensive now. The government raised the price and not 
the company, but they are very, very crazy about it." 
</P>
<P>
Prices for customers who paid cash ranged from $1.35 a gallon for regular 
leaded gasoline to $1.37 for unleaded and $1.55 for super unleaded, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere throughout Southern California, motorists' reaction to the new 
federal excise tax ranged from anger to resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"The government already takes out so much in taxes," said Tiffany Lee, 22, a 
model, who filled her Hyundai Sonata at an Arco station in Los Angeles' 
Koreatown. "It doesn't seem fair that they're going after more tax money. This 
much more we have to pay? With the economy so slow, it makes you think there's 
something wrong with George Bush."

The new tax brings the national average of unleaded regular gas at self-service 
stations to $1.41 a gallon, according to the American Automobile Assn. 
</P>
<P>
While pumping unleaded gas priced at $1.45 per gallon, a 33-year-old municipal 
bond trader from Pasadena also lamented the uneasy state of the nation's 
economy, saying that her husband had just been laid off. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an investment banker, and his future job prospects look pretty (bad) 
right now," said the woman, who asked not to be identified. To augment the 
household income, she had to go back to work last week at a downtown brokerage 
firm after several months off. 
</P>
<P>
The price hike will squeeze her family's single income all the more, the woman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy with the tax, but what else can the government do?" she asked. 
"With the budget deficit so high, you can cut back, cut back, cut back only so 
much. It's ridiculous to think you can balance it without raising taxes." 
</P>
<P>
The tax is estimated to generate $5 billion a year, half of which will go 
toward road and public transportation improvements. The other half will be used 
to whittle down the nation's $250-billion budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
In Chatsworth, Kim Oswald, 28, said she went to five gas stations looking for 
the lowest price before stopping at an Arco station. The price for regular 
leaded gas: $1.27. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us are barely making it as it is," Oswald said as she filled up a 
well-worn Pontiac Bonneville. 
</P>
<P>
Many Ventura County motorists were not fazed by the tax hike, saying that 
they've learned to live with the steeper gasoline prices. Several people 
filling their tanks at a Shell station in mid-town Ventura said they could 
envision gas prices going to $2 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll just keep driving," said Nigel Thornell, 46, a medical lab specialist 
from Santa Barbara. "There isn't much choice." 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Gamua, manager of Seaward Mobil in Ventura, said people initially were 
annoyed by a nickel-a-gallon state tax increase in August and since have 
accepted the escalating costs during the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Still, motorists lined up Friday night at Argett Chevron in Ventura to fill up 
their tanks before the price hike took effect at midnight, said Josh Nudd, a 
station attendant. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, "Some people were kind of upset and wished they'd come in last 
night," Nudd said. 
</P>
<P>
More than the extra 5 cents per gallon, motorists seemed to be dismayed at 
having no say over Congress' action to increase taxes in its budget agreement. 
Some were upset that President Bush has not been held accountable to his 
campaign promises of no new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything he promised he was going to do, he hasn't followed through on," 
said the Pasadena bond broker. "I'm not happy with him at all. And I'm a 
Republican."

Paramount High School, looking like the best football team in the Southern 
Section, advanced to its third championship game in the past three years with a 
19-8 victory over El Toro Saturday night at Mission Viejo High. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's semifinal victory over El Toro extended its winning streak to 21 
games over two seasons and moved the Pirates (13-0) in the Division II 
championship game next Saturday against Capistrano Valley (11-2). 
</P>
<P>
The game will be a rematch of last year's Division III semifinal that Paramount 
won, 26-25, in overtime. The site of the game will be announced at the Southern 
Section office today. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro's defense shut down the Pirates' running game, but quarterback Steve 
Lopez threw two touchdown passes to wide receiver Carl Henderson. Paramount 
tailback Leon Neal, who averages 9.7 yards per carry, gained only 54 yards in 
18 carries and teammate Demondre White added 58 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
But Neal found a way to hurt El Toro, intercepting quarterback Rob Johnson's 
pass at the El Toro 31 and returning for a touchdown with 28 seconds remaining 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave up what we didn't want to give up: two long bombs," El Toro Coach Bob 
Johnson said. "I thought our run defense did a great job containing Neal, but 
those two touchdown passes killed us." 
</P>
<P>
El Toro (11-2) had the momentum in the second half after opening the third 
quarter with its only scoring drive of night. Johnson completed a 50-yard pass 
to wide receiver Wade Jackson for a touchdown. On the ensuing conversion, 
fullback Jason Rojas caught a shovel pass from Darren Doalson to give the 
Chargers an 8-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro appeared to be heading for another touchdown after defensive tackle 
Jeremy Hogue striped Lopez of the ball at Paramount's 42 and ran 12 yards to 
give the Chargers a first down at Paramount's 30-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
But two dropped passes ended the threat and Paramount regained control and the 
lead, 13-8, when Lopez threw a 37-yard touchdown pass to Henderson with 6:27 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"We were fortunate to get some big plays," Paramount Coach Ken Sutch said. 
"They came up and got some momentum going by throwing the ball while we stood 
and watched. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't run the ball against them, so we had to pop those two (touchdown) 
plays." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson completed 13 of 24 pass attempts for 185 yards and a touchdown. He 
finished the season with 2,781 yards passing and 29 touchdowns. But three 
critical dropped passes against Paramount denied El Toro the chance to play in 
a title game for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, those dropped passes really hurt," Johnson said. "I thought we might 
have been able to score two more touchdowns in the second half if we could have 
caught the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's defense, led by linebacker Sam Santana and tackle Mark Manu, held 
El Toro to 27 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Santana set up the only score of the first half by intercepting Johnson's pass 
intended for tight end David Canfield at El Toro's 30-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Henderson beat El Toro defender Jason Bailey at the 11-yard 
line and then scored on a 31-yard touchdown pass from Lopez. Alfonso Bigelow's 
kick gave Paramount a 7-0 lead with 19 seconds remaining.

MIKE PENNER: IN UNLV RULING, NCAA RIGHTS A WRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One other multiple-choice list the NCAA had to ponder before doling out the 
punishment that ended a 13-year Shark hunt: 
</P>
<P>
 Potential Results From An Outright Ban Of Nevada Las Vegas From The 1991 NCAA 
Basketball Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 a) One more joy-filled ride through this country's legal system, meaning a 
14th year of glorious litigation, followed by a 15th, and maybe a 16th while 
UNLV, in the interim, obtains a court order to keep its Rebels 
postseason-ready. 
</P>
<P>
 b) A 30-0 UNLV team with nowhere to go, an NCAA tournament played to determine 
who's No. 2 and a 1991 championship trophy sent back to the shop for asterisk 
enhancement. 
</P>
<P>
 c) The Poulan/Weedeater/USF&amp;G/Bally's War de Trump, a renegade "real 
national championship" game between outlaw UNLV and the NCAA winner, with Don 
King promoting, Ted Turner broadcasting and the Mirage Hotel hosting. In the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
For the NCAA, it was name your nightmare. One way or another, whichever way the 
NCAA turned, there was going to be a mess. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the NCAA was the original polluter, dumping the toxic waste four 
months ago with its ludicrous ruling to penalize UNLV now for alleged crimes 
committed when Larry Johnson and Stacey Augmon were in the third grade. So Tark 
got to them, then, too? Ply them with a a couple of Schwinns? A few trips to 
Tastee-Freeze? 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA couldn't get Jerry Tarkanian in 1977, couldn't get him through the 
entire Carter and Reagan administrations, but when it saw a crack in the 
judicial door this summer, it went for the hammer, turning a blind eye to the 
ethical and procedural obstacles that should have shut it down within seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Ethical: The UNLV players of 1990-91 should not have to pay for the sins of 
'77. Neither should the UNLV players of 1991-92, but that's the deal UNLV cut 
and that's the deal it now must live with. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen years is a long time -- long enough for entire athletic and academic 
administrative staffs at UNLV to turn over. From 1977 to 1990, the only salient 
constant was the coach and if the NCAA still felt the need to tag someone, it 
should have been The Bald One and no one else. 
</P>
<P>
Procedural: Thirteen years is also long enough to render pages of NCAA 
regulations obsolete. This is why Tarkanian remains outside NCAA cross hairs, 
at least on this set of charges. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1985, the NCAA could not directly sanction a head coach for rules 
violations; only the school could sanction the coach. UNLV made such an attempt 
in 1977, but Tarkanian sought, and won, an injunction from the District Court 
in Las Vegas prohibiting the university from taking action against him. 
</P>
<P>
The injunction still stands and so does Tarkanian, immune from any suspension 
and/or fine because 1977 guidelines continue to govern this case. 
</P>
<P>
Tark's in-court team is even better than his on-court team. 
</P>
<P>
With the coach untouchable, the NCAA went after the players. Mistake No. 1. The 
intent of the NCAA infractions committee, supposedly, is to make the punishment 
fit the crime, but this time, the NCAA didn't come close. The NCAA was benching 
its defending champion, but more than that, it was benching one of the best 
college basketball teams ever assembled. 
</P>
<P>
As underclassmen in 1989-90, Johnson, Augmon, Greg Anthony and Anderson Hunt 
went 35-5 and made a mockery of the 1990 NCAA final. In 1990-91, they were 
going to be better. Johnson and Augmon were back as All-American bookends at 
forward. Anthony and Hunt were back to energize the backcourt. The only vacancy 
was at center -- and there, Tark had redshirt George Ackles coming back and 
seven-foot JC transfer Elmore Spencer coming in. 
</P>
<P>
Think hard about this UNLV team and it's hard not to think about UCLA. Fact: 
UCLA is the last team to win back-to-back national basketball championships. 
Not so idle thought: UNLV is the first team to have a better-than-legitimate 
shot to match that feat. The best team since the Walton Bruins? It isn't out of 
the question. 
</P>
<P>
Paying players, slipping players free airline tickets, pressuring players into 
lying to NCAA investigators -- none of this is good for college basketball. But 
barring UNLV from the next championship tournament -- you can place that under 
the same heading. 
</P>
<P>
Unless it is proved that this group was illegally assembled or compensated, it 
deserves its chance at history. On this much, the NCAA and UNLV finally agreed 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA didn't cave in. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA didn't back down. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA didn't turn yellow. 
</P>
<P>
What the NCAA did do was right a wrong before it became too late and find a 
solution that wasn't perfect but might have been the best available. Given the 
conditions -- "unprecedented" in the understated words of the infractions 
committee chairman -- it was the correct call. 
</P>
<P>
You can accuse Tark of pulling another fast one, if any maneuver requiring 13 
years can be considered fast. You can accuse Tark of selling out UNLV's future 
-- a future that might or might not include Tark -- for the golden moment at 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
If you do, you'll probably be interested in the Lloyd Daniels charges, due to 
hit UNLV within the month. Post-1985 regulations apply to this one.

NORTHRIDGE FINDS A TEAM IT CAN HANDLE, 109-90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Following three lopsided road losses, Cal State Northridge gained its first 
victory in its inaugural Division I basketball season, 109-90, over Northern 
Arizona Saturday night at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Seven Matadors scored in double figures, led by Todd Bowser with 17 points and 
David Keeter with 16. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge ran off 15 consecutive points to open the game, including a steal 
and dunk by Keith Gibbs, a steal and layup by Andre Chevalier, two three-point 
baskets by Kyle Kerlegan and a three-pointer by Keeter. 
</P>
<P>
The Lumberjacks (0-3) couldn't handle the Matadors' full-court zone press, 
which forced seven turnovers in the first six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Northern Arizona ended the drought on a basket by Steve Williams, but 
Northridge pushed the lead to 20-2.

ON THE PREP PATH: MCKENZIE DOES WHAT IT TAKES FOR SUNNY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It can't be that easy being Sunny Hills quarterback Hakeim McKenzie. Then 
again, maybe it's not that tough. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on how you look at it, McKenzie is either a pass-hungry quarterback 
trapped on a treadmill (run, run, run), or a dream of a team player happy to 
sacrifice personal glory even if it means handing off for eternity. 
</P>
<P>
His role is often somewhere between "stand back, quarterback," and "run when 
you can, man." 
</P>
<P>
But duty is in the eye of the beholder. 
</P>
<P>
While McKenzie does pass occasionally -- he averaged 12 attempts per game, 
completing 43%, during the regular season -- his foremost calling is to slip 
the ball to one of the Lancers' very capable running backs, Kenny Overby and 
Mike Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
That same ol' song -- run right, run left, run over, run under -- played again 
Friday night when Sunny Hills defeated Valencia, 23-10, in a Division VI 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
The tune was sweet for Lancer fans as Sunny Hills ran its way into this 
Friday's division final against Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
But for McKenzie -- his friends call him Jamal -- how did a 
two-for-seven-for-56-yards passing performance play on his ego? Just fine, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, it doesn't matter," he said. "Whatever it takes for the team to win, 
that's fine by me." 
</P>
<P>
Usually, a player has to practice that line for years before it sounds as 
sincere as it does coming from McKenzie. But this senior quarterback speaks 
from the heart. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, for a quarterback about to lead a team into a Southern Section final, 
McKenzie is a modest young man -- though he'd never admit it. His teammates say 
he has a calming effect on the team, but he can rev up the Lancers when need 
be. 
</P>
<P>
"He can go anywhere from 1 to 10 on the intensity scale," Overby said. 
</P>
<P>
But Overby said there are times when he wishes McKenzie would be more selfish. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very capable, a real threat on the run," Overby said. "But our offense is 
just set up in a way that it doesn't always give Jamal that many opportunities 
. . . to rise to the occasion." 
</P>
<P>
So, many times, he creates his own. 
</P>
<P>
Against Valencia, McKenzie twice called an audible for a keeper, powering 17 
yards up the sideline on each. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the game, he handed off to Marlon Womack, who fumbled. While players 
from both teams dove for the ball, McKenzie waited for it to bounce, snatched 
it as he would a basketball and gained seven yards. 
</P>
<P>
Against La Habra, McKenzie picked up a fumble at his team's one-yard line and 
ran 99 yards to the end zone. The play was called back because of a clipping 
penalty. Against Esperanza, a 70-yard run was called back on a holding call. 
</P>
<P>
And while his passing stats aren't stellar -- he had 663 yards, five touchdowns 
and five interceptions during regular season -- many of his best pass plays 
also have been called back because of penalties or other mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, a 40-yard pass into the end zone bounced off receiver Steve Choe's face 
mask and was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills Coach Tim Devaney said the 6-foot-2, 200-pound McKenzie has yet to 
tap his potential. Last year, McKenzie got even fewer opportunities to throw 
because Sunny Hills had three standout backs -- Sullivan, Overby and Brian 
Pizula -- to lead them. 
</P>
<P>
"He's improved 100% since last year," Devaney said. "He's got an arm that can 
throw six miles and he can jump out of the gym. West Virginia likes developing 
quarterbacks, and they're really interested in him." 
</P>
<P>
Then why isn't Devaney using his quarterback more? 
</P>
<P>
"For the last three years we've utilized the run," Devaney said. "Sometimes 
coaches get so entrenched in one thing (they don't want to change what's 
working)." 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie says he just wants to improve his 2.9 grade-point average -- he's 
sitting out the basketball season to hit the books, he said -- and hopes to 
attract a football scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, at the moment, the Division VI title is foremost in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I just do what I do, and do my best. If it works out, great," he said. "I'm 
not saying I wouldn't like to make my mark, but if the team wins, that's what 
matters."

GLENDALE RUNS CITRUS DEFENSE INTO GROUND, 23-16 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale College took a run at the state's top-ranked defense Saturday. 
Literally. Keeping the ball on the ground for 58 of their 70 offensive plays -- 
including all nine on the winning drive -- the Vaqueros ground out a 23-16 
victory over Citrus College in the Southern California Bowl at Citrus on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale gained 437 yards against the Fighting Owls (227 yards allowed per 
game), including 306 on the ground. But the last 59 were the most important. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (9-2) started its decisive drive on the Citrus 41 with 6 minutes 23 
seconds to play. Fullback Rafik Thorossian keyed the march, carrying four times 
for 30 yards. Bobby Webster capped the drive, going over from the three with 
1:11 left. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't much to it," said Thorossian, a redshirt freshman who gained 70 
yards in 12 carries. "The offensive line just did a great job opening some 
holes for us. All Bobby and I had to do was run through them." 
</P>
<P>
Webster, a freshman who rushed for a school-record 1,360 yards during the 
regular season, finished with 150 yards in 30 carries Saturday, and sophomore 
fullback Wes Bender added 87 yards in 12 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Thorossian, whose 20-yard touchdown run narrowed Glendale's deficit to 10-7 
midway through the second quarter, rumbled 12 yards to the Citrus three-yard 
line to set up Webster's game-winning score. 
</P>
<P>
But even then, Glendale wasn't safe until Frank Solchaga's fourth-down pass 
fell incomplete with 16 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Solchaga (14 of 27 for 199 yards, one interception) completed three consecutive 
passes to give the Owls (8-3) a first down at the Glendale 28 with 39 seconds 
remaining. But he was sacked twice and threw two incomplete passes on the next 
four plays. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams entered the game riding eight-game winning streaks. Glendale, the 
Western State Conference Northern Division champion, gave up 284 yards to 
Foothill Conference champion Citrus but only 92 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 13-10, early in the third quarter, Glendale tied the score on a 
23-yard field goal by Martin Boskovich with 4:36 left in the quarter, then took 
a 16-13 lead on Boskovich's 47-yard kick with 13:54 left in the game. 
</P>

Ervie Barnes returned the ensuing kickoff 66 yards to the Glendale 30, however, 
and Mike Reyes kicked a 24-yard field goal six plays later to tie the score, 
16-16.

Top-seeded Houston, utilizing a trio of powerful hitters, defeated 
second-seeded Cal State Northridge, 15-4, 15-12, 6-15, 15-6, to win the Women's 
Invitational Volleyball Championship on Saturday night at the University of 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
Houston was led by senior Latisha Charles, who had 25 kills and 22 digs. Karen 
Bell added 25 kills and Ginger Wittofski slammed 13 to help the Cougars win the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge advanced to the championship with a surprisingly easy 15-10, 15-6, 
15-5 sweep of third-seeded Georgia in the semifinals Saturday morning. The 
Matadors needed only 65 minutes to eliminate the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
Houston (24-15) advanced by defeating fourth-seeded Memphis State, 12-15, 
16-14, 15-3, 15-4. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN was unable to get its offense going and had trouble containing the Cougar 
hitters. "Houston was a tremendous team, and they attacked exceptionally well," 
Matador Coach Walt Ker said. "They are as good as any team we've faced all 
year. Bell, Charles and Wittofski were so athletic and explosive that we had 
trouble making the adjustments to block them." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (29-9), which finished a successful first season of NCAA Division I 
competition, was led by all-tournament selections Kathleen and Marianne Dixon, 
who had 21 and 16 kills against the Cougars. Setter Beth Welch ended her 
collegiate career with 63 assists against Houston and was named the 
tournament's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely proud of the year we've had," Ker said. "Everyone did a great 
job for us. . . . I was thinking how nice . . . it was for our seniors to play 
in this tournament. The individual honors were an extra gift that Marianne, 
Kathleen and Beth worked very hard for." 
</P>
<P>
CSUN held Georgia to a .055 hitting percentage. 
</P>
<P>
"We continued to play very focused," Ker said. "From a defensive standpoint, we 
were ready to play from the first point to the last. They didn't get too many 
balls down on us, because our digging was just phenomenal."

MOORPARK BOWLS OVER CORSAIRS IN 69-34 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It might have been a little overkill, but the Moorpark College football team 
averted a shutout by scoring 69 points. 
</P>
<P>
Winless in three previous bowl appearances, Moorpark made up for years of 
postseason frustration with a 69-34 trouncing of Santa Monica in the Western 
State Bowl on Saturday night at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels great," Moorpark Coach Jim Bittner said of the school's first bowl 
win. "I was beginning to think we were never going to get a bowl victory. I was 
beginning to think it wasn't in the cards." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's Jamal Anderson scored on a 59-yard run on the first play of the game 
and that set the tone for the evening. Anderson finished with 135 yards in 10 
carries and had two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Freddie Bradley, playing in his final game for Moorpark (9-2), rushed for 183 
yards in 23 carries and scored on runs of four, 34 and eight yards. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jeff Barrett led Santa Monica (8-3) with 325 passing yards. The 
former Burroughs High standout completed 26 of 45 passes for two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark led, 35-28, at halftime. Two third-quarter Bradley touchdowns -- a 
34-yard run on a delayed draw and an eight-yard burst over the right side -- 
gave Moorpark a 49-28 lead entering the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica mounted a last, muted threat when Johny Mack ran three yards for a 
touchdown to cut the margin to 49-34 with 11 minutes 7 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark answered three plays later with a one-yard Johnel Turner run as the 
Raiders scored 20 points in the last 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark finished with 461 rushing yards and 543 yards in offense. Quarterback 
Del Marine rushed for 51, Turner for 38, Peter Marine for 20, Kris Dutra for 24 
and Terrence Thomas for 22. 
</P>
<P>
The first half was as close as the second half was one-sided. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied at 7-7, Anderson's second touchdown -- a 10-yard bull rush 
over the middle -- put Moorpark back in front. The Raiders added another 
touchdown when John Corcoran smothered a Terry Sigler punt and Randy Spitzer 
covered the loose ball in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica scored on the first play of the second quarter to pull within 
21-14. Barrett threw a swing pass to Jason Lucky who Lucky broke 30 yards down 
the left sideline for the score. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley scored standing up from four yards to put Moorpark ahead, 28-14. 
</P>
<P>
Mack answered with a two-yard run for a Santa Monica touchdown. The teams then 
traded touchdowns before the intermission with Moorpark scoring on an 18-yard 
touchdown pass from Del Marine to Tremmel Hamm and Santa Monica scoring on 
Barrett's 24-yard pass to Napoleon Bank.

Deena Drossin of Agoura High tied the six-year-old Woodward Park course record 
in winning the Kinney West regional cross-country title Saturday in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
The Charger senior clocked 17 minutes 7.8 seconds over the 5,000-meter 
(3.1-mile) circuit, equaling the mark set by Marnie Mason of Klamath Falls High 
(Ore.) in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The top eight finishers in the boys' and girls' races qualified for the 
national championships, to be held in San Diego on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Drossin's Marmonte League rivals finished among the top eight. 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie Rothman of Westlake timed 17:16 in finishing second and Channel 
Islands' junior Veronica Barajas was eighth in 17:47. 
</P>
<P>

(14:49) of Arroyo Grande and James Menon (15:01) of San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge 59, Northeastern 58 -- Julie Arlotto scored on a layup 
with four seconds left after an inbounds pass from Bridgette Ealy at half court 
to give CSUN the consolation championship of the Fresno State tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Ealy, who did not play in the first half because of a strained calf muscle, 
scored 12 points on six-of-seven shooting and had three rebounds and two 
assists in 18 minutes. Arlotto finished with eight points and had six assists. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (2-3), which had fallen behind by five before mounting its 
second-half comeback, shot a sizzling 62% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BOYS' SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks tournament: Sophomore midfielder Ian Leiviska scored five goals

STATE DIVISION I VOLLEYBALL CHAMPIONSHIP;

CORONA DEL MAR GETS JOB DONE IN FOURTH GAME

<P>
It wasn't so much a question that Corona del Mar High School would beat 
Mountain View St. Francis in the State Division I girls' volleyball 
championship game Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The question was when . 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings blew a 6-2 lead in the third game and needed seven match points 
in the fourth for a 15-3, 15-5, 11-15, 15-8 victory at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
"That team just wouldn't go away," Corona del Mar Coach Dale Flickinger said of 
St. Francis. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar (28-1) won its second state title since 1984 and extended its 
winning streak to 26 matches. 
</P>
<P>
Outside hitter Tracy Schriber had 13 kills and was named the tournament's most 
valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Joining her on the all-tournament team were teammates Lara Carlsen (14 kills), 
Stacy Petersen (12 kills) and Prentice Perkins (42 assists). Brita Schwerm came 
off the bench to lead St. Francis (29-2) with 19 kills. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar's hitting percentage of .354 set the State Division I record, 
breaking the previous mark of .350 set last year by Mira Costa. 
</P>
<P>
After winning the first two games, the Sea Kings appeared ready for a sweep, 
leading, 6-2, in the third game. But St. Francis capitalized on eight Corona 
del Mar hitting errors and six kills by Schwerm to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings were better prepared in the fourth game as they raced to a 14-0 
lead. But again St. Francis came back, fighting off six match points and 
cutting the deficit to 14-8. The match ended on the seventh match point, when 
St. Francis committed a hitting error. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsen said the Sea Kings were nervous in the fourth game. "It was so hard to 
do it at the end," she said. "I was dizzy I was so overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
The victory capped a somewhat frustrating season for the Sea Kings. Their 
coach, Charlie Brande, was suspended in August in the wake of a Southern 
Section investigation into his coaching of club-team players with high school 
eligibility remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Brande said Saturday his hearing before the Southern Section had been postponed 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea King players dedicated their victory over Mira Costa in the Southern 
Section 5-A final to Brande. They were thinking of him during Saturday's 
victory, too. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing with Charlie made us stronger," Carlsen said.

<P>
Missy Clements wasn't as worried about La Habra High School winning the State 
Division II girls' volleyball title as she was about surviving the first game. 
</P>
<P>
Clements, who injured her knee in the first game of last year's final and never 
returned, had 14 kills, three blocks and two aces to lead La Habra to a 15-5, 
15-1, 15-5 victory over King City in the championship match Saturday night at 
Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
"We were standing on the in-line after the first game and I told myself, 'Cool, 
you've actually made it to the second game,' " said Clements, a senior middle 
blocker. "This was very exciting for me. It meant a lot." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive title for La Habra (26-0), which extended its 
two-year winning streak to 45 matches. 
</P>
<P>
The victory also gave La Habra its seventh three-game sweep in its past eight 
matches. Bakersfield Highland pushed the Highlanders to four games in the state 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected more toughness from (King City)," Clements said. "I don't know if 
they came out frozen or what." 
</P>
<P>
Clements caused King City several problems in the first game. She had seven 
kills and a block. Zrinka Kristich added four kills and an ace. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra's serving took over in the second game. The Highlanders had six aces, 
including three by Zrinka Kristich. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra had 14 aces in the match, including seven by Zrinka Kristich, who had 
the flu. 
</P>
<P>
"Zrinka got pretty peppy out there after she got those aces," La Habra Coach 
Sandy Blumenthal said. "She had been sick for a few days and missed two days of 
practice. Yesterday was the first day she had played. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this match might have helped her get over her sickness." 
</P>
<P>
King City Coach Debbie Hudson said La Habra's serving surprised her players. 
</P>
<P>
"I anticipated they would be powerful and very accurate," Hudson said, "but 
their serving was really a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the teams La Habra played this year said they weren't that good. I 
said, 'Yeah, right.' " 
</P>
<P>
King City (23-4) led only once, 4-1 in the third game. But La Habra went on a 
14-1 run, sparked by Ana Kristich's five kills. 
</P>
<P>
Clements and Zrinka Kristich were named to the all-tournament team along with 
La Habra setter Lisa Almanza and Ana Kristich, who had 10 kills. Amy McMahon 
had eight kills to lead King City. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a great way for us to end the season," Blumenthal said. "This was the 
fewest amount of errors (10) that we've had all year. 
</P>
<P>
"This team is very special. Not many coaches have the opportunity to coach a 
team like this."

ANTELOPE VALLEY CHRISTIAN WINS 8-MAN TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADAM BENSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Antelope Valley Christian High's 54-26 victory over Visalia Central Village 
Christian on Saturday at Antelope Valley College gave the Lancaster school its 
first Southern Section 8-man Small Schools football title in three years of 
trying. It also was first-year Coach Ted Knapp's 100th win as a high school 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
But there was little question as to which accomplishment was more important to 
Knapp. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't even thought about the 100th win," he said. "I am proud that these 
boys could be a part of that, but I am much more proud to have been a part of 
their championship. The 100th win takes a back seat in a long-stretch limousine 
to winning the (Southern Section) title." 
</P>
<P>
After dashing to a 20-0 lead midway through the second quarter, top-seeded 
Antelope Valley Christian (13-0) maintained at least a two-touchdown lead 
throughout the game. 
</P>
<P>
After a punchless first half in which it could score only once and had only two 
passing yards, second-seeded Central Valley Christian (7-6) twice cut the lead 
to 14 points but could get no closer. 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Craig Cieslik ran for touchdowns of 51 and 66 yards in the second 
half for Antelope Valley Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Both scores came on a reverse, a play that was developed this week by Knapp and 
his staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very excited to run the ball. Most of the time it's just catch, catch, 
catch," said Cieslik, who also caught a touchdown pass in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"The blocking on those plays was great. We knew it could work against their 
defense and I knew I could get the yardage. We made it work."

BLACK, CAMP KILPATRICK WIN, 52-20 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the team is playing its first season of 11-man football, Camp 
Kilpatrick is no longer a secret, and neither are running backs Michael Black 
and Bobby Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
In attendance at Saturday night's Southern Section Division X semifinal playoff 
game were coaches from Montclair Prep, which Camp Kilpatrick will face in the 
final on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the stands were coaches from Dorsey High, the school that figures to 
inherit both Black and Wilson when the two are released from Camp Kilpatrick, a 
county-run school for juvenile offenders. 
</P>
<P>
After viewing Camp Kilpatrick's 52-20 pasting of Mammoth, the Dorsey staff 
walked away quite a bit happier than the folks from Montclair Prep. 
</P>
<P>
Black rushed for a career-high 342 yards in 27 carries and Wilson chipped in 
with 92 yards in four carries to lead the Mustangs (9-3-1). 
</P>
<P>
And there was more disconcerting news for ground-oriented Montclair Prep, the 
division's top-seeded team: Mammoth (10-3) was held to just 61 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been fortunate in the last few weeks to have been fairly successful 
early in the game," first-year Camp Kilpatrick Coach Sean Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
Ditto Black, who earlier in the year rushed for 324 yards in a game. His mark 
Saturday is the highest among Valley-area backs this season. 
</P>
<P>
The first half was a game of can-you-top-this. Black had gained 211 yards by 
halftime and Wilson, a sophomore, already had scored on a one-yard run and an 
80-yard kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
Camp Kilpatrick took a 14-0 lead behind the outside speed of Black, who broke

Mammoth struck back with the home run, however, when Daron Dondero hit receiver

and a 20-6 lead.

St. Paul High fullback Anthony Morales scored two touchdowns and rushed for 53 
yards in seven carries to lead the Swordsmen to a 13-0 win over Hawthorne in a 
Southern Section Division III semifinal football playoff game at Cerritos 
College. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul (8-3-2) will play undefeated Anaheim Esperanza (13-0) for the title 
next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Swordsmen will take a nine-game winning streak into the championship. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul held Hawthorne (10-3) to two first downs (both on penalties) and three 
yards total offense in the first half en route to a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Morrell Ollis, Hawthorne's 1,000-yard rusher, netted minus five yards on three 
first-half carries and finished with four yards on six carries. 
</P>
<P>
After a scoreless first quarter, Morales scored on a one-yard run on the 
initial play of the second quarter to give St. Paul a 7-0 lead. Morales' 
touchdown culminated a 13-play, 59-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
On the Swordsmen's next possession, tailback Carlos Ramos had a three-yard 
touchdown run, which finished off a 12-play, 62-yard drive. For the game, Ramos 
had 98 rushing yards on 19 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul quarterback Albert Borunda threw for 111 yards (without an 
interception) on eight-of-13 passing.

OCC GETS BOOT ON MISSED FIELD GOAL

<P>
Mark Recktenwald sat on one knee, his hand stretched out for at least 20 
seconds after the ball left his hold. He held his position that long in 
disbelief as did his Orange Coast College teammates. 
</P>
<P>
The reason was OCC kicker Mike Wade missed a 36-yard field goal with 54 seconds 
left, and El Camino defeated OCC, 23-20, in the second game of the Orange 
County Bowl doubleheader in front of 5,000 Saturday night at OCC. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena defeated Riverside, 29-28, in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
Although it's traditional to play for a victory instead of a tie in a bowl 
game, OCC Coach Bill Workman explained that fourth and eight was too much to 
ask of his offense. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about it earlier in the drive," Workman said. "The only way we would 
play for the tie is if we had to get five yards or more. . . . It's a chip shot 
though. There are no odds that he misses it. I hate ties, but it would have 
been a heck of a lot better than what happened." 
</P>
<P>
But about 10 minutes before the missed field goal, it looked as if OCC wasn't 
going to need any late-game heroics. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates (8-3) took a 20-10 lead on two second-half touchdown passes from 
quarterback Greg Angelovic to tight end Derek Whiddon. The first, for seven 
yards, came with one minute 24 seconds left in the third quarter. It gave OCC a 
13-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The second came when Angelovic threw a 35-yard scoring pass to Whiddon with 
9:07 left. Whiddon had a game-high nine catches for 128 yards but his 
first-half fumble cost OCC a score. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates had driven 75 yards to the El Camino 18 with 27 seconds left in the 
first half. Angelovic then completed a pass Whiddon, who caught the ball at 
about the three-yard line and turned toward the end zone. But in the process, 
he fumbled into the air and El Camino linebacker Jim Rudberg recovered. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino took a 10-7 lead on a two-yard scoring run by fullback Tony DaCosta 
with 1:51 left in the half. The play capped an 82-yard drive that included a 
52-yard run by Anthony Daigle. 
</P>
<P>
Daigle scored on a one-yard run with 2:29 remaining to give El Camino a 23-20 
lead. Daigle, who was selected player of the game, had 163 yards in 23 carries. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino (9-2) had scored on a 10-yard pass from quarterback Rod Harvey to 
Bryan Reeves with 9:07 left. El Camino attempted the two-point conversion, but 
failed, and trailed, 20-16. 
</P>
<P>
OCC had taken a 7-0 lead on a one-yard keeper by Angelovic with 3:47 left in 
the first quarter. The score was set when OCC defensive back Terrence Branley 
intercepted a pass and returned it 22 yards to the El Camino one. 
</P>
<P>
Angelovic was 16 of 26 for 211 yards and two touchdowns. Running back Adrain 
Steen rushed for 85 yards in 19 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena 29, Riverside 28 -- Ostell Miles gained 50 of his 164 yards on the 
winning drive, including a one-yard touchdown run with 3:03 left, and James 
Marlborough passed to Wolfe Barber for the two-point conversion as the Lancers 
(8-3) won the first game of the doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside (7-4) had a chance to win, but Jeff McDaniel missed a 32-yard field 
goal attempt with 27 seconds left. The Tigers had taken a 28-21 lead with 5:32 
left on a one-yard run on fourth down by quarterback Jack Manu.

LITTLE-KNOWN FHA LOAN PROGRAMS; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCING: IN ADDITION TO THE MORE FAMILIAR 5% DOWN PAYMENT PROGRAM, THE AGENCY 
OFFERS OTHERS THAT SERVE PEOPLE WITH MORE MODEST INCOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Most Americans are familiar with the Federal Housing Administration's loan 
program that lets would-be home buyers purchase a house with a 5% down payment. 
</P>
<P>
But what many people don't realize is that the FHA operates several other loan 
programs that offer attractive financing terms to buyers and homeowners alike. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a bunch of different programs, but a lot of people just don't know 
about them," said Bill Glavin, a spokesman in the FHA's Washington 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Some lenders say many people don't even ask about FHA loans because they figure 
that they make too much money to qualify for a government-backed mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike many programs run by state and local governments, you don't have to 
meet "maximum income" standards to get most types of FHA loans. In fact, you 
could qualify for one of these cut-rate mortgages even if you make more than 
$100,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
More than 80% of the loans that the FHA insures are made through the U.S. 
Housing and Urban Development's "203-b" program. It's the simplest type of FHA 
loan to understand: You make a down payment as small as 5%, you get a 
fixed-interest rate and the mortgage is paid off in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
More than 15 million Americans have bought homes under the 203-b program since 
the FHA was formed in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
But another loan program operated by the FHA -- known as the "245" program -- 
is even more attractive to many borrowers, especially to those of rather modest 
means. 
</P>
<P>
An FHA 245 loan is a graduated-payment mortgage. It starts out with a 
below-market interest rate, and payments gradually rise over the first five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Pasadena-based Countrywide Funding Corp. offers FHA 245 loans with 
an introductory rate of 7 3/4%. The rate eventually rises to 9 3/4%, where it 
stays for the life of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
"The low introductory rate on the 245 loan makes it a lot easier to get than a 
typical mortgage," said Ralph Mozilo, Countrywide's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Mozilo said, a borrower seeking a $100,000 mortgage under the 
well-known 203-b program would have to make about $36,000 a year to qualify for 
a loan at the going rate of 9 1/2%. Monthly payments for principal and interest 
would be $841. 
</P>
<P>
A borrower who instead opted for the little-known 245 program would only have 
to earn about $28,800 a year to qualify because of the loan's 7 3/4% 
introductory rate. Monthly payments would start out at $718, rising gradually 
to $878 five years from now. 
</P>
<P>
"A 245 loan is an especially good loan for younger people who aren't making a 
whole lot of money now, but who expect their earnings to rise steadily over the 
years," Mozilo said. "Their income growth should keep pace with the increases 
in their mortgage." 
</P>
<P>
Since lenders who make FHA 245 loans actually lose money in the early years of 
the mortgage, they typically charge a slightly higher rate when the loan 
"matures" than they do on standard FHA loans. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the rate on Countrywide's 245 loans eventually hits 9 3/4%. You 
would pay 9 1/2% if you took the more popular 203-b loan. 
</P>
<P>
Another drawback to FHA 245 loans is that in the early years of the mortgage, 
the outstanding loan balance actually gets bigger instead of smaller with each 
monthly payment. By giving you such low initial rates, the lender is 
essentially subsidizing your payments in the early years but tacking that 
subsidy on to your outstanding loan balance. 
</P>
<P>
This so-called "negative amortization" shouldn't bother you if you plan on 
staying in the house for several years. It disappears after the interest rate 
reaches 9 3/4%, at which time your loan starts being amortized -- paid off -- 
just like any other mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
But if you must move within a few years of taking out a 245 loan, you might 
actually lose money because the value of your home might not rise as fast as 
the outstanding balance of your mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum amount you can borrow under both the 203-b and 245 programs is 
$124,875. That's enough to get a small condominium in most pricey coastal 
markets, or a single-family home in inland areas. 
</P>
<P>
Other little-known FHA loan programs include: 
</P>
<P>
* "Title I" home-improvement loans. Under this program, current homeowners can 
borrow up to $25,000 to fix their house up. Although rates on these loans are 
typically a bit lower than rates on standard home-improvement loans, they're 
difficult to find and up-front costs are sometimes high. 
</P>
<P>
* The 203-k program. These loans are made to people who "substantially 
rehabilitate" their homes. They, too, carry an interest rate that's lower than 
conventional rates and are geared primarily toward low- or moderate-income 
people who own houses in sore need of repair. 
</P>
<P>
* The 235 loan-program. Available only to the poor, this program provides 
government subsidies to first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Mortgage bankers and mortgage brokers are often the best sources of information 
on FHA loans. Many large banks and savings and loan associations don't make the 
full array of FHA mortgages, in part because they provide similar loans without 
the government's help. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, you can also get more information about the loans from the nearest 
regional office of the Federal Housing Administration. You'll find it under the 
"United States Government" section in the white pages of your local phone book.

UNDERPRIVILEGED YOUTHS FROM SANTA ANA LEARN TO ROW AND KAYAK IN NEWPORT BAY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twelve-year-old Tam Vu likes to spend his afternoons playing with baseball 
cards or goofing off with friends. But recently, Vu and eight other students 
from an economically depressed Santa Ana neighborhood had a chance to spend the 
afternoon in the sun and water of Newport Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the kayaking the best," the animated Vietnamese boy explained. "They 
call me flipper." 
</P>
<P>
His friends and kayaking instructor came up with the name after he dove off the 
long white surf ski-kayak for the fifth or sixth time. 
</P>
<P>
Vu and the other boys and girls in the program are spending several hours a 
week on the water, in kayaks and rowing shells, learning the fundamentals of 
the two sports. The idea, says Newport Aquatics Center executive director Paul 
Prioleau, is to let underprivileged kids in on the joy of water sports and 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"(The center) is here to promote the sports and to provide public access to the 
bay," Prioleau said. "The idea is that it will give them a little taste of what 
else is out there in life. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, they'll go away with a little something that will stick in their 
mind. Life isn't always what their neighborhood looks like," he continued. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Aquatics Center, built in 1987, was partially funded by a grant 
from the Amateur Athletic Foundation for youth sports in Southern California. 
The private facility, located on North Star Beach in Newport Bay, received a 
grant of $115,000 to purchase racing shells and staff a youth swimming program. 
</P>
<P>
The idea started with a Spurgeon Intermediate School math teacher, Marion 
Tarbox. Rowing on Sunday mornings with her sister, she thought that having a 
few of her students participating in something challenging and invigorating 
outdoors would help their self-esteem and maybe "turn a few around." 
</P>
<P>
For a variety of reasons, there are many kids in the school who are considered 
"at risk" for dropping out of school, she said. But getting them to feel better 
about themselves can often turn them on the right track in time to keep them 
interested in school. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some kids who were falling through the cracks. That was my original 
push," Tarbox said. Now there is a waiting list and children ask her every day 
if there is more space. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the kids at our school had never been to the beach . . . on the ride 
home last time they talked about how nice (Newport Beach) was and how pretty. A 
lot of them didn't seem to realize that there was a future for them," she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
And the fact that the lessons are taught by young men and women who have been 
successful in their educational and social goals provides additional role 
models for the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that I was looking for was men who could demonstrate 
maturity without being vulgar or aggressive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Tarbox and fellow teacher Terri Foy, Spurgeon Intermediate is 
located in one of the roughest neighborhoods in Santa Ana. Foy said that fear, 
drugs and crime are a part of everyday life for many of the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
But on the quiet surf of Newport Bay, 34 of them are getting a brief respite. 
Under the tutelage of nationally ranked rowers and kayakers, each child gets 
two afternoons over the course of three weeks, playing in either kayaks or 
single person sculls -- the technical name for the thin, light racing boats 
rowed with two oars. 
</P>
<P>
Esther Andrade, 13, had been in a boat only once before, for a cruise around 
Newport Harbor. But with the help of Dru van Hengel and James Martinez -- both 
of them are training for the 1992 Olympics -- Esther took to the water quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the rowing better than the kayaks," she explained. "With the rowing, 
you don't get as wet. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's pretty. Last time we were here, a big fish jumped out of the water 
right in front of us," Andrade said, giggling about it with her classmate, 
Lorena Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
For Lorena, the kayaking was preferable. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I did it, I lost my voice for the next few days," the 
12-year-old said. "It was because I was screaming and laughing so much."

NORTH HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"People like you are rabble-rousers!" the chairwoman yelled. 
</P>
<P>
"You're breaking the law!" a man in the audience shouted back. 
</P>
<P>
The North Hollywood Project Area Committee -- an elected body responsible for 
guiding redevelopment -- was in uproar. Two members abruptly stalked out, 
shattering the quorum. Activist Scott Halper, who was filming the proceedings, 
approached the dais only to have his camera violently swatted to the floor. His 
videotape ends with a woman's scream. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, it was a dismal evening for democracy -- but not such a startling 
scene among project area committees, or PACs, the obscure citizens panels that 
are reshaping California's troubled urban neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Far from spacious meeting halls and TV news crews, the often-rancorous, unpaid 
committees wield formidable power. They speak for divergent community factions 
at the treacherous vortex of change. Nearly anonymous -- and not to be confused 
with better-known political action committees -- PACs nonetheless hold veto 
rights over redevelopment and oversee every step in its arduous birth. Like few 
other citizens groups, they strongly influence how cities and agencies spend 
hundreds of millions of tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
PACs exist by state mandate wherever redevelopment raises the threat of housing 
condemnation. In California, where more than 600 communities are now being 
overhauled at a cost of $900 million a year, PACs operate in virtually every 
densely populated community. Usually they convene in living rooms and rented 
churches, bringing amateur politics and town-hall theatrics to a daunting task. 
In the Southland, they have been a source of controversy in cities stretching 
from Anaheim to North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The typical redevelopment plan bulges with 100 pages of sweeping guidelines and 
abstruse zoning regulations, sewn together with legal clauses and loopholes and 
augmented by as many as 1,000 pages of environmental reports and demographic 
studies. Each is a blueprint for decades of growth. Each is crafted during 
tedious months, sometimes years, by teams of consultants, civic planners, 
lawyers -- and PAC members. 
</P>
<P>
The players are people such as the corner travel agent, the Neighborhood Watch 
captain, the apartment renter who once took an architecture course. They might 
recommend allowing property condemnation in neighborhoods south of a major 
boulevard but not to the north. Or they might call for shorter buildings in one 
commercial zone and taller ones in another. Their clout, their lust for 
economic opportunity and their deep fear of condemnation create a volatile mix 
of self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
Elected homeowners fret incessantly over the motives of colleagues who 
represent land-hungry developer interests. The PAC plays a Jekyll-and-Hyde role 
as both adviser and watchdog to other government bodies, including 
growth-hungry redevelopment agencies. Both roles are considered vital, but it 
becomes nearly impossible to install a thoroughly neutral panel. 
</P>
<P>
Time and again, PACs have become the focal points of lawsuits, power struggles 
and bitter charges of collusion. More than a few meetings have been punctuated 
by pounding fists and shouting matches. Feuds develop over issues large and 
small -- from the zoning of entire commercial strips to the height of a 
chain-link fence in an alley. 
</P>
<P>
In North Hollywood this year, furor over PAC elections was so intense that one 
vote was canceled moments before it was to take place; in another, convoluted 
rules adopted by the PAC enabled a candidate named Greg Roberts to run 
unopposed in a category reserved for renters -- and still lose. 
</P>
<P>
The seat remains vacant. 
</P>
<P>
"A farce," one activist said angrily. 
</P>
<P>
In Watts, meanwhile, hundreds of protesters with signs marched prior to a 
scheduled PAC election in August, forcing its postponement. Homeowners there, 
fearful of condemnation in a proposed super-project affecting 100,000 
residents, see the creation of a PAC as an inevitable step toward 
redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
That battle goes on, with two PACs now involved -- one appointed, one to be 
created soon in an election. All the while, homeowners are organizing 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
In Hollywood, site of one of the most ambitious redevelopment attempts in 
Southern California, the story has been worse. The ill-fated PAC there was 
officially abolished last year by frustrated Los Angeles City Councilman 
Michael Woo, who termed it a "forum for wacky behavior." More than most, 
perhaps, the Hollywood PAC became a classic example of what -- and how much -- 
can go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Created by a neighborhood election in 1983, the 25-member cadre was the guiding 
force in Los Angeles' second-largest redevelopment area: the 1,100-acre core of 
the movie capital -- home to Mann's Chinese Theater, Hollywood and Vine and 
37,000 residents. The PAC toiled years to help draft the $922-million plan, 
adopted by the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency and the City Council 
in 1986, and then became a review board for individual projects contemplated 
within the community. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, however, turmoil reigned. Neighborhood groups blasted the CRA 
for accepting $150,000 in loans and contributions from the Hollywood Chamber of 
Commerce to start the project, only to turn around and create a committee made 
up of more business seats than resident seats. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, 13 of the 25 posts were held by chamber members who controlled 
every key subcommittee. CRA officials denied any improprieties, saying the 
movie-industry presence justified the additional business seats, but a 
political tug-of-war was touched off that lasted years. 
</P>
<P>
PAC meetings became acrimonious battlegrounds. Leonard Shapiro, publisher of 
the monthly L.A. Observer, tried to address the committee at one public meeting 
and was ordered to shut up or leave. As hotter heads prevailed, Shapiro was 
escorted away by a sergeant-at-arms. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in the audience started to yell," he remembered. "When I left, they 
all jumped up and went out with me . . . 50 to 75 people. So the meeting broke 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners accused the committee majority of voting along with chamber 
President Bill Welsh -- a suspicion that Welsh and other PAC members denied. 
But to make sure, homeowners began demanding roll-call votes -- in alphabetical 
order. "(Welsh) was at the end of the alphabet," activist Brad Berlin recalled 
with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
After several disputed elections and a failed lawsuit against the CRA, zealous 
homeowners finally wrested control of the committee. According to councilman 
Woo, the PAC then became an immovable roadblock, taking fanatical positions and 
waging endless debates over parliamentary procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Woo abolished the committee under a state law allowing PACs to dissolve three 
years after a plan is adopted, and he appointed a less-powerful advisory 
committee to take its place. 
</P>
<P>
The PAC, however, filed a lawsuit arguing that Hollywood's plan is written to 
guarantee the continued existence of the PAC. With a final decision still 
pending, the committee has gone on meeting for well over a year, raising 
issues, blasting proposed projects, taking actions that -- for the moment, at 
least -- go nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
"A headache," Woo concluded, "that won't go away." 
</P>
<P>
Other cities have gone through similar battles. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim killed its entire redevelopment plan in 1987 after thousands of 
residents protested the configuration of the project area -- bordering 
Disneyland -- and the political makeup of the PAC, saying it was illegally 
appointed. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in South El Monte filed suit after the city started two redevelopment 
projects without bothering to establish committees. That suit was settled in 
June and PAC elections are scheduled early next year. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of conflict all over the state," said attorney Christopher A. 
Sutton, a redevelopment specialist who waged legal battles, large and small, 
throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
La Puente, for example, is now bickering over $250 in reimbursements owed to an 
elected PAC secretary for photocopying expenses, Sutton said. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say they short-change her $15," Sutton said. "The amount of bad blood 
and ill will that it's going to buy you is something you can probably count in 
the millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Of further debate there, the attorney added, is a proposal to charge the PAC 25 
cents per page for photocopies made at City Hall -- when the cost to the public 
is a dime. "The PAC wants to go out to Kinkos and do it at 5 cents a page," 
Sutton said. "The city has not said no, but it has not said yes." 
</P>
<P>
In more typical instances, Sutton said, disputes tend to center on the balance 
of power. The state laws that mandated PACs in 1972, and gave them veto powers 
in 1976, calls for them to be independent review committees. But the laws do 
not tell cities and agencies how to create and assist the groups of novice 
planners without exerting undue influence. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the importance of PAC elections, the turnout is often so small that 10 
or 15 votes is enough for victory. Critics usually question whether pro-growth 
agencies have done enough to publicize the vote. 
</P>
<P>
A few cities, such as Pasadena and Long Beach, are considered successful 
examples of how the process should work -- creating model urban communities 
with PACs that function effectively and independently. 
</P>
<P>
Downey failed miserably in its first attempt to start a PAC, appointing one 
that drew angry charges of political cronyism. The PAC and the city's 
redevelopment plan were thrown out by the courts -- and the city started over. 
It advertised widely and summoned residents to a meeting. Downey officials told 
them a PAC was being formed, explained how it should work, and walked out. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a screwball way of doing it," former Community Development Director 
James Cutts remembered. "But some guy in the audience got up, said, 'We can't 
sit here all night,' and ran the election. I've go to say, it worked out pretty 
well."

place horse. 
</P>
<P>
SURELOCK's bets for today are $100 to win on Plenty Of Grace, a $40 exacta, 
Plenty Of Grace to Royal Touch, and a $20 exacta reversing the two in the 
eighth race. 
</P>

A former "China Beach" fan wrote to say (TV Times, Nov. 11) that she is unhappy 
with the changes that have taken place on the series this season. It would have 
been more comfortable to have stayed in China Beach with the characters we have 
come to know and cherish, and to further explore their relationships with one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
The show's constant change in time and place is often disorienting and 
confusing, but imagine what it is like for Vietnam veterans who still 
experience the flashbacks. These scenes allow the viewer to understand the 
emotions that trigger seemingly bizarre behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"China Beach" is never easy to watch. It's heart breaking and gut wrenching. It 
makes you laugh a little and cry a lot, but most important it makes you think 
and care.

I would like to express my disappointment about "China Beach." They have 
changed the format and it's like coming into a book in the middle without 
knowing what went on before. I sure wish the producers would get the show back 
on track before it's too late.

Well, Fox has done it again with another Sunday night comedy that really makes 
me laugh loud for a full half-hour. The new show "Get a Life" is a breath of 
fresh air and outrageous comedy in these days of lame generic sitcoms.

I watched what I thought was the season premiere of "Wiseguy." 
</P>
<P>
What I saw was a slow-moving, grossly mutated version of "Miami Vice." From the 
deaths of Sonny and Father Pete to the McPike/moose face-off in the Volchek 
family crypt, the series had never been dull. Until now. We don't need another 
"Miami Vice." What we need is Ken Wahl as Vincenzo Michael Terranova.

THE GOLDEN AGE ANEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the last four years, baby boomers have relived their childhood via Nick at 
Nite, the quirky cable station that airs reruns of such TV series as "Mr. Ed," 
"My Three Sons" and "The Donna Reed Show." 
</P>
<P>
This Wednesday, Nick at Nite tries something new: an original show. "The Early 
Days" is a pilot for a regular series set during the Golden Age of TV. 
</P>
<P>
The initial episode visits the chaotic debut of "The Sam Arnold Show," a 
mythical variety show within the show. The half-hour comedy also goes 
behind-the-scenes with Sam (Ray Gill), his ex-wife Elise (Janet Zarish) and the 
cast and crew of "The Sam Arnold Show." 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, in black and white and in color, was created and written by Will 
McRobb and Joe Stillman, with "I Love Lucy" writers/creators Bob Carroll and 
Madelyn Davis serving as creative consultants. 
</P>
<P>
"The Early Days" is not a nostalgia sitcom in the vein of "Happy Days" and 
"Laverne &amp; Shirley." 
</P>
<P>
"The interesting thing about the program is that we are trying to capture the 
magic of what we call the Golden Age of Television," said Geoffrey Darby, 
senior vice president, Nickelodeon/Nick at Nite Production. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going back and making a sitcom about the Golden Age of Television. 
We are going back and trying to give people a place where there are good 
stories, well made, that sort of emotionally tug you." 
</P>
<P>
McRobb, the mastermind behind the inventive series promos seen on Nick at Nite, 
added, "We wanted to recapture the feelings that people had back then. People 
used to get dressed up to watch TV and then would sit down and enjoy an evening 
of TV. 
</P>
<P>
"We were kind of hoping not only to recreate the historical details but also 
the attitude toward TV that it is a wonderful thing, a kind of innocent thing. 
Nobody knew how it worked or where it was going to go, but it just felt right. 
I think part of it was an emotional feeling. That took a lot of rewriting." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll and Davis, McRobb said, came aboard after the project's first draft was 
written. "They wrote the first five years of 'Lucy,' so we went to them for 
tips and ideas and they gave us great advice to make it more authentic." 
</P>
<P>
Darby believes "The Early Days" reflects Nick at Nite's concept of a TV Land, 
which is the network's feeling and approach to the vintage programs it airs. 
</P>
<P>
"TV Land is a place that has an emotional hook with our audience," he said. "We 
treat things that are not real life as real. We treat the fact that Mr. Ed can 
dial a telephone and talk as real. We treat those characters (from old sitcoms) 
as if they are alive. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many reruns in our world and a lot of them don't actually belong on 
Nick at Nite. You wouldn't see something on Nick that just came off network 
programming, like 'The Cosby Show,' because there is actually a better show 
that defines TV Land, like 'Father Knows Best.' 
</P>
<P>
"We think the next stage is to create product and TV programs that are truly 
representative of TV Land." 
</P>
<P>
McRobb takes the concept of TV Land very seriously. He has a true love for the 
classic series seen on Nick at Nite. "I grew up watching stuff like 'The Brady 
Bunch' and 'The Partridge Family,' " he said. "I think I feel the way most 
people do about early to mid-'70s TV, that it was schlock that ruined my brain. 
</P>
<P>
"But working at Nick at Nite, I grew up all over again watching 'Donna Reed' 
and 'My Three Sons.' I have a very reverent attitude toward these shows." 
</P>
<P>
"The Early Days" isn't the only new series on the Nick at Nite drawing board. 
This month, Nick will shoot a pilot for a sitcom entitled "Hi, Honey I'm Home." 
</P>
<P>
"This is high concept," Darby said, "this is like a horse that can talk. It's 
about rerun families. When they get canceled on TV, they don't go away. They go 
into the sitcom relocation program and they are placed in modern-day color 
setting. But they are still the characters that existed on the (vintage) TV 
show. 
</P>
<P>
"They are placed there until they get picked up by another channel and put back 
on the air. It's a clash of 1950s values with 1990s values. And that clash 
provides the humor." 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, Honey I'm Home," will air on Nick early next year. Like "The Early Days," 
it too could become a series. 
</P>
<P>
"We will air them in a block and call them 'Nick at Nite New.' " 
</P>
<P>
"The Early Days" airs Wednesday at 9 p.m. and repeats Saturday at 8:30 p.m. on 
Nickelodeon (cable).

Q &amp; A: TWO MEN, ONE STORY, 15 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
ROBERT MACNEIL AND JIM LEHRER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer are a TV news duo that has lasted longer than the 
pairing of Chet Huntley and David Brinkley on NBC in the 1960s. Their 
"MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" on PBS has been praised by critics for its 
even-handed style and its format of focusing on one or two stories in depth 
each night. 
</P>
<P>
MacNeil, 59, a Canadian who had worked for NBC and the British Broadcasting 
Service, and Lehrer, 56, a former Texas newspaperman, began working together as 
co-anchors of PBS' daily coverage of the Watergate hearings. Off camera, each 
has published numerous books, including novels, plays and nonfiction. They also 
received Emmys, Peabodys and the Dupont-Columbia awards for excellence in 
journalism. 
</P>
<P>
This week PBS will broadcast a 90-minute retrospective of the journalists' 15 
years together on the "News-Hour" and its predecessors, "The Robert MacNeil 
Report" and "The MacNeil/Lehrer Report." 
</P>
<P>
Jane Hall interviewed the pair together-MacNeil in New York and Lehrer via 
speaker phone from Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What was your impression of each other when you first worked together during 
the Watergate hearings? Did Lehrer seem like a noisy Texan? 
</P>
<P>
MacNeil: He didn't seem like a cliched Texan. He's a modest man, very engaging. 
Lehrer: When I first met Robin (MacNeil), I was intimidated by him. He'd been 
around the world 15 times, worn out eight or nine trench coats. I'd mostly been 
to Nuevo Laredo. But one of the reasons it worked is that we were in sync on 
journalism. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How would you differentiate yourselves from network news shows? 
</P>
<P>
MacNeil: I think our distance from the network evening shows is greater now 
than when we started. Partly, it's in the demeanor and the feel of what we do, 
and certainly in our intention. 
</P>
<P>
NBC News recently announced with lots of trumpets that they were going to 
devote the whole newscast one evening to the state of the nation because they 
think it's so important. That's 22 minutes, when you subtract the commercials. 
We've been devoting 22 minutes and more to one story every night for 15 years 
because we think it's so important. 
</P>
<P>
I know that when NBC News does it, with all their very talented people and 
their serious journalists, and their good training and everything else, they're 
still going to have to do it with the kind of dash and pace and lots of sorts 
of excitement noise and fast talking, a kind of barely controlled hysteria 
about it. It's the culture of what they do as well as the intention, which is 
so different from what we do. 
</P>
<P>
We are quieter, more thoughtful. I'm not saying that we're God Almighty or that 
we're the right way or anything else-it's just that we are very different in 
what we do and the way we do it. And, I think, as they get more frenetic, as 
their competition increases and their audience shrinks-while we have stuck to 
what we do, which is a reasonably, civil, quiet, thoughtful way of doing it-I 
think the differences between their product and our product get more 
pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Some of the elements of "MacNeil/ Lehrer" have shown up on network news. 
</P>
<P>
MacNeil: One thing I think we can say we did is redirect attention to the value 
of talking heads and to debriefing news sources. What we introduced was letting 
the audience hear directly from the kind of sources that a reporter would go 
and talk to on a story. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think you're ever dull? 
</P>
<P>
MacNeil: We are dull for those people who think we're dull, and they probably 
don't watch or have stopped watching. We are not dull to the people who like 
our product. 
</P>
<P>
Lehrer: Where the networks have got it wrong, in my opinion, is that they think 
that in order to avoid being dull, they have to jazz up the news. If there's 
somebody out there who doesn't care about arms control, then anything you do 
about arms control-I don't care if you can find a way to get bombs coming out 
of your TV set-it's going to bore them. 
</P>
<P>
If you're in the business of doing serious journalism, you do serious 
journalism for those people who want serious journalism-you do not do it for 
those who do not. We have an obligation to make a story as interesting as 
possible. We don't have an obligation to hype it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. A media watchdog group called Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting 
commissioned a study this spring that concluded that the "MacNeil/Lehrer 
NewsHour" has too many white establishment figures on as guests, that your 
program is overly white and overly male. (The group drew similar conclusions 
about "Nightline" in a study last year.) What do you think about the FAIR 
report on your program? 
</P>
<P>
Lehrer: It was extremely unfair. It was incompetently done. It was done from an 
ideological point of view. They attacked us, which they have a perfect right to 
do. The only problem was that they were not honest about (their point of view.) 
</P>
<P>
It's a left-wing organization, and the right-wing went after us at one time. 
Everybody wants the news to fit what their view is, and they want to decide who 
the guests on everybody's television should be-who should represent this 
position, who should represent that position. We didn't let the right do 
that-we're not going to do the left do it. 
</P>
<P>
There are legitimate criticisms to be made about every program in American 
journalism, but it isn't a matter of sitting there with an adding machine and 
looking only at what the color of a person's skin is, and what a person's 
gender is, and not listening to what the people are saying or how they're being 
held accountable. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that a lot of the power in this country is held by white males. For 
instance, in the U.S. Senate, there are 100 members, none of them black. Any 
time we cover what the U.S. Senate is doing, we're not going to have a black 
person on. And there are only two women in the U.S. Senate, so the odds are 
there aren't going to be a lot of women on either (when the show covers the 
activities of the Senate). 
</P>
<P>
MacNeil: They did their arithmetic wrong and in a prejudiced way. They chose 
only certain stories at a certain time, at the beginning of a new 
(presidential) Administration when you would naturally have more of a certain 
kind of people on. 
</P>
<P>
They said, for example, that we didn't put environmentalists on-that is so much 
a distortion of this program's record on the environment over the last 15 years 
that it's extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
I would point out, too, that a new study of print and TV news by a group called 
Women, Men and Media (a University of Southern California group co-chaired by 
feminist Betty Friedan) says that, among TV news programs, we did the best job 
of integrating women into our show. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You had a woman on the program recently who is a military analyst on Iraq. 
Is it harder to find a female military analyst on Iraq than a male one? 
</P>
<P>
MacNeil: There are fewer women in that field than men. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you try to have a broad spectrum of people on the show? 
</P>
<P>
MacNeil: Yes, and we succeed sometimes better than other times. If you asked 
people who book the guests, I think they'd say they're supposed to find women, 
blacks, people who aren't official. ... We're also planning to expand a new 
segment of the show called "Conversations," lengthy pieces where we'll have an 
opportunity to bring on individuals who have provocative views on subjects such 
as the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You are said to be best friends. Given the world of television, do people 
find that hard to believe? 
</P>
<P>
Lehrer: This isn't some friend you see every six weeks-this friendship is 
tested every damn day of the week. As a consequence, it has defined friendship 
for me-what it means, what it requires. 
</P>
<P>
MacNeil: We tell each other things we may not tell our families, and the 
program is only part of what is valuable in the friendship. If the program 
stopped tomorrow, we would still be friends, and we would enrich each other's 
lives because of that. 
</P>
<P>
Lehrer: You know, some people, the first time they get recognized in the 
7-Eleven store, they never get over it. Being on television does things to 
grown-ups-it can turn them into little children very quickly. Robin and I are 
not immune from that. Having somebody there to help you through the 
shark-infested waters of your own ego, as well as shark-infested waters of the 
sharks themselves, is a terrific asset. 
</P>
<P>
MacNeil: We can express our selfish thoughts to each other. And we can talk 
with each other while thinking, think while talking. We don't have to have 
finished, articulate thoughts- that's one of the greatest values of friendship. 
</P>
<P>
Also, we're both interested in all kinds of other things. We found we like to 
talk about the printed word. And we both are introverts in the pure definition 
of that, people who can amuse themselves without a lot of stimulation from the 
environment. We're not loners-we don't avoid people. But one of Jim's favorite 
things is to get into a car and go off through the little towns of Kansas or 
Texas on the backroads, often looking for old bus stations. (Lehrer's father 
worked for a bus line.) I've spent periods of my life where I've gone off on 
very long walks; in England, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
Q. But you're involved in daily news. 
</P>
<P>
MacNeil: What's daily news? I know some people who are consuming news morning, 
noon and night. They're listening to the radio in their car, listening to the 
latest five-minute summary, getting in and turning on the television set to see 
another show, constantly reading the newspaper. That is not me. 
</P>
<P>
News is something we make our living at-and I know I'll find out the daily news 
in a much more compact way here on the job than by constantly consuming news 24 
hours a day. 
</P>

SCHOOLS STRUGGLE TO COPE WITH NEW BABY BOOM;

EDUCATION: OVERCROWDING FORCES PRIVATE, PUBLIC SECTORS TO WORK TOGETHER ON 
INNOVATIVE IDEAS TO SOLVE THE CLASSROOM CRUNCH.

<P>
It's like a flashback to the '50s in some communities: Changing demographics, 
including classrooms brimming with baby boomers' kids, are spurring a school 
construction rush. But unlike a generation ago, when schools mushroomed quickly 
and cheaply, school districts now are forced to be more creative in planning 
and paying for new schools. 
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, "there has been more entrepreneurial spirit in 
design, construction, and financing of schools," says Tony J. Wall, executive 
director of the Council of Educational Facility Planners, an organization based 
in Columbus, Ohio. With school construction stakes so high, he says, "one of 
the keys for new school buildings is they have to provide options." 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, school construction increased nearly 50% between 1982 and 1986, 
according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Much of the new building is happening in 
rapidly expanding exurbs, where new residential housing has created the demand 
for more schools. For example, since 1985, Maryland's Montgomery County school 
district outside of Washington has built 11 schools, and expects to build 21 
more by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
One concept making a comeback in fast-growing communities, where taxpayers are 
feeling the burden of new schools and services, is joint use of school 
facilities. In the '60s, as part of the community-schools movement, a few 
model, joint-use schools dedicated space and shared operating costs with 
community agencies and social services. 
</P>
<P>
A 1986 report from the National Governors Assn. Task Force on School Facilities 
predicted that multiple use of school buildings was the wave of the future. The 
report noted that 40 states have provisions for interagency sharing of schools. 
At least one, Florida, offers special incentives: The state pays up to half the 
cost for schools that will be used by other government agencies, a provision 
that will defray school building costs by $25 million this year, says H.J. 
Schroeer, the state's director of educational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Joint-use is starting to catch on, now that we're building again," says 
William DeJong, president of Planning Advocates, a school facilities consulting 
firm in Columbus. "Cooperation among agencies is becoming the norm." 
</P>
<P>
In Dublin, a suburb of Columbus, and Ohio's fastest-growing school district, 
the Wyandot Elementary School, one of six schools built since 1982, shares a 
park and a pool with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Another re-emerging concept is the prototype school -- a set of generic 
architectural plans that can be duplicated to save time and money. New York 
City is considering several prototype designs for a dozen new schools. In 
Montgomery County, new schools follow a flexible prototype design in which as 
many as 30 modular classrooms radiate out from a permanent building core that 
includes administrative offices, a health suite, a cafeteria, and a gymnasium. 
The prototype is designed so that, if the portable classrooms are moved to a 
new site, "it won't look like you've ripped off pieces of the building," says 
Bill Wilder, director of school facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, school districts plan for three or five years down the road. That's 
changing, however, as more school districts are creating 10- and even 20-year 
plans with the help of computer technology. Using census data and demographic 
information, adjacent districts and schools and city governments are joining 
forces to map out a master plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Virginia Beach City, Va., public schools, growing at a rate of 2,500 
students a year, are working closely with the city's planners on a computer 
model based on land-development projections, rather than school enrollments and 
births. In rapidly growing areas, land-based models promise more accurate 
projections further into the future, says Tom Garrou, planning specialist for 
the school district. "The implications are staggering if you make mistakes," he 
says. "You're talking $25 million for a new high school." 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, most of the long-term planning for schools is happening in cities. 
But "more and more in the suburbs," says Wall. "They aren't allowing the big 
city to control their destiny as much." 
</P>
<P>
Not all experts agree. For the most part, says K.C. Bibb, a school planning 
consultant in Colorado Springs, "in the suburban and rural areas, planning is 
mostly lip service." 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of the problems many districts have recycling empty schools, planners 
are designing schools so they can be used for other purposes. Dublin, Ohio, is 
building schools that can be converted into office buildings, medical centers, 
and nursing homes. Six new schools in the planning or construction stages are 
located near parks, public transportation, and commercial areas. With skylights 
and stone and wood exteriors, they don't look like conventional school 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"They have aesthetic value, and they reflect the character of the 
neighborhood," says Chip Edelsberg, assistant superintendent. The schools have 
not gone without criticism for their attractiveness, but given their capacity 
for becoming tax-paying structures, he says, the community "will appreciate 
them someday." 
</P>
<P>
That day may be a few years off. Public school enrollment nationwide is 
expected to continue increasing, to 41 million by 1992, up from 38.7 million in 
1986. The growth is uneven, with some states, such as those in the Midwest, 
having stable or declining overall enrollments, and others facing serious 
overcrowding, according to "Wolves at the Schoolhouse Door: An Investigation of 
the Condition of Public School Buildings," a report released recently in 
Washington. California, for example, estimates it will need 800 more schools by 
1993. And Florida says it will need 816 new schools within 10 years.

Louis (Shimmy) Boyet Jr. of Poplar Bluff, Mo., has a few more caps than the 
average person -- more than 1,500 in fact, including caps given to him by 
President Bush and Sam Walton -- but he still cannot pick a favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you what they mean to me, because they were given to me by my 
relatives and my friends," Boyet said in a recent telephone interview. "One of 
them is just as important as the other one. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all favorites. I couldn't put one against the other one." 
</P>
<P>
All of the caps in his collection are different, and all were given to him, he 
said. He keeps an alphabetical list of all 411 people who have given him caps. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't bought one of them," he said. "I have caps that were given to me 
from 18 foreign countries. I've even got one from Red China, and that's not 
easy to get hold of." 
</P>
<P>
Boyet got a cap from Walton, chairman of Wal-Mart Stores, when the businessman 
was in Poplar Bluff recently to attend the grand opening of a Wal-Mart 
Supercenter. Poplar Bluff is in southeastern Missouri, about 125 miles south of 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
The cap, emblazoned with the logo of "Wal-Mart Ol' Roy Dog Food," was one of a 
limited edition series, Boyet said. He said the cap presented to him by Walton, 
which was No. 140 out of 500 in the limited edition, brought his total number 
of caps to 1,521. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to him a few minutes and had my picture made with him," said Boyet, 
71, who works as a real estate salesman in Poplar Bluff. 
</P>
<P>
Although he did not get to meet Bush personally, Boyet said he was thrilled to 
receive a cap in the mail from the President. The cap is red, white and blue 
with a large "T" for Bush's home state of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Boyet said he saw an article in the newspaper that said Bush had given a cap to 
a man in Florida. "I cut out the article and mailed it to him, then talked to a 
secretary to his secretary." 
</P>
<P>
Because of his interest, Boyet said, he now notices any cap worn by someone he 
meets. He said he would like to correspond with other cap collectors. 
</P>
<P>
Boyet said he didn't know he was going to become a collector when he started 
saving caps in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"My sister in Alabama sent me a few caps, then my son gave me a few," he said. 
"The first thing I knew, people started sending them to me. 
</P>
<P>
"I took them out of the closet and put them on the wall. Once it got on the 
wall, it grew." 
</P>
<P>
Although most of his collection consists of baseball-style caps with bills, he 
also has a few unusual ones, including the familiar "bobby" hat of a London 
policeman. 
</P>
<P>
Many of his caps are one of a kind, and the entire collection is displayed in 
the basement of his home, which he shares with his 74-year-old wife, Lois, 
Boyet said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wear some, and I've got them all over the walls," he said. "My wife says I'm 
getting too many."
