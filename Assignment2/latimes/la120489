SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: MIDNIGHT SCREENING OF CULT CLASSIC DRAWS SMATTERING OF 
DEPRAVITY BUFFS

<P>
And now for something entirely different. Or: it's gross to you but it's Divine 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
It is just before midnight Saturday and everything is normal. 
</P>
<P>
At Sea World the Christmas lights burn with a hard-edged glow. In the coffee 
shops of Mission Valley, Iranian cabdrivers are talking with young ladies 
dressed in their finest MTV garb. 
</P>
<P>
At an undisclosed location the sheriff and his burglar alarm have been put away 
for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
I am at the Park Theatre where North Park melts into Hillcrest. I am buying a 
$6 ticket to see "Pink Flamingos," the 1972 cult classic of gore, sex and 
excrement done in High Camp style. 
</P>
<P>
I am here to see what sort of San Diegans attend a midnight showing of a movie 
that gives decadence a bad name. 
</P>
<P>
An engaging pair of avant-garde entrepreneurs named Trevor Watson and Thaddeus 
Temple think San Diego is ripe for midnight movies. 
</P>
<P>
They think San Diego has outgrown "Rocky Horror Picture Show" as its only 
midnight movie. They make it their business to know about these things. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, 29, a graphic artist from Nottingham, England, and Temple, 26, a writer 
and graduate of San Diego State, publish "Revolt in Style," a Pacific 
Beach-based magazine devoted to the cutting edge in arts and fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Now they've branched out to midnight movies. The first was "Ziggy Stardust," 
the David Bowie concert film done with a home movie camera. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 16, Watson &amp; Temple will present "Blue Velvet," complete with a 
party where guests are invited to dress like Frank, the depraved Dennis Hopper 
character. In January, it's on to "Sid and Nancy." 
</P>
<P>
The "Pink Flamingos" crowd is bright and chipper, lots of tiny earrings and 
hair dyed jet black: Students, film buffs, depravity buffs, the culturally 
alienated, people stultified by San Diego's early-to-bed image. 
</P>
<P>
An advertising executive is there alone because his date stood him up. A chief 
petty officer from North Island is there because he sometimes sees three and 
four movies a night; he rushed over from Chevy Chase's latest. 
</P>
<P>
A real estate appraiser and his girlfriend, an escrow officer, are there 
because they like Divine, the 300-pound female impersonator who stars in 
"Pink." They dare not share their passion with co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
Rainer Schottlaender, a folk singer and Gene Wilder -- look-alike from East 
Germany, warms up the crowd with original work. "No Sex In Space" and "On the 
Highway to LA" are favorites. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope people know how disgusting this movie really is," mutters Temple. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. Many are "Pink" aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
Yvonne Hunt, 32, a hair stylist: "I look mild-mannered but I like sick stuff." 
</P>
<P>
John Contreras, 18, a Mesa College student: "John Waters (the director) is a 
genius. He's so disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
John Smiley, 19, an office worker: "John Waters hates hippies and so do I. His 
movies are like scream therapy for me." 
</P>
<P>
When it's over at 2 a.m., the audience fills out cards suggesting other 
midnight movies. Among them are Warhol films, silent films from the Soviet 
Union, sci-fi classics and Jane Russell's "The Outlaw." 
</P>
<P>
One guy writes that he'd like to see autopsy films. I avoid eye contact as I 
hurry to my car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Elvis Not Fit to Be King, Students Say 
</P>
<P>
Here and there. 
</P>
<P>
* The student council at UC San Diego rejected a proposed Elvis Week that would 
have included Elvis movies and impersonators. 
</P>
<P>
Objections were raised to Presley's supposed racial views. 
</P>
<P>
* Airlines are careful about their in-flight movies. Times reporter Barry 
Horstman thinks maybe it's time to regulate passengers' reading material, too. 
</P>
<P>
He admits being nervous on a recent trip from Tampa to San Diego. His seatmate 
was reading the novel "Final Flight." 
</P>
<P>
* Social activism 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The planned march Friday night down University Avenue by Neighbors United 
Against Hate Crimes will have a twist. Marchers are encouraged to bring their 
dogs and other pets. 
</P>
<P>
* If you think Aviara is an overly cute name for a massive land development, 
you only know the half of it. 
</P>
<P>
The number for prospective home buyers in the Carlsbad project is 800-TAKEWING.

COUPLE'S FAITH IN COMMUNISM UNSHAKEN DESPITE CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three decades after Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev promised to bury capitalism 
and the West, the people of Eastern Europe have instead all but put the 
tombstone over communism's grave. 
</P>
<P>
The dizzying turn of events in countries such as Czechoslovakia and Hungary, 
where the word communism has been eradicated from the lexicon, has left 
American communists such as Art Edelman and his wife, Esther Auerbach, confused 
and rethinking their beliefs of the past 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
But, while Communist parties are quickly becoming anathema in Eastern Europe, 
Edelman and Auerbach's faith in communism remains unshaken. To them, communism 
is not the anachronism that many critics, including the FBI, say it has become 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Very frankly, this has been a confusing period. This is a new experience," 
said Edelman, 64, a party member since 1947. " . . . When our comrades in the 
United States see what's taking place in Europe, they have questions and 
debates. But they have confidence in socialism." 
</P>
<P>
Edelman and his wife acknowledge some of communism's failures. But they argue 
that capitalism itself has failed in the United States. The widening gap 
between rich and poor, the growing homeless problem, the conservatives' war 
against trade unions and other "inherent contradictions" will eventually steer 
this country to the same reforms that are enveloping Eastern Europe, they say. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview in their comfortable, College Area apartment, Edelman and 
Auerbach spoke candidly about the recent events in Eastern Europe, and how 
those changes have confirmed or clashed with the ideology they were taught or 
believed in for several decades. 
</P>
<P>
Lured by the weather, the couple moved to San Diego last year from New York, 
where they worked at the Communist Party USA's national headquarters. Their 
well-furnished home and quick wit are in stark contrast to the picture of the 
stoic, ascetic agitators that many people may have of communists. While meeting 
with a reporter, the conversation was briefly interrupted by a UPS delivery 
man, who was bringing them Christmas packages from relatives on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the fact that they are communists, Edelman and Auerbach said, they 
are like most American couples. Because of his East Coast roots, Edelman likes 
hockey, follows the Boston Bruins and New York Rangers, and counts Frankie 
Brimsek, a goalie for the Bruins during the 1940s among his heroes. Auerbach, 
who works in an office, said she likes parties, "not necessarily communist," 
and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being jailed for his beliefs, and harassed by the FBI and the defunct 
House Un-American Activities Committee, Edelman said, he has never regretted 
becoming a communist. 
</P>
<P>
Membership in the party subjected him to constant FBI surveillance, Edelman 
said, which led to frequent job dismissals when agents visited his employers. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, he was dragged before the activities committee in 
Pittsburgh, where he lived. On another occasion, he was jailed for eight months 
for "painting peace signs" in New York. The signs, which were painted in public 
places, read "Peace No H-Bombs." Edelman said he viewed those hardships as "the 
price I paid for being a good American." 
</P>
<P>
"Communism has helped me be a good American. . . . It's made me sensitive to 
working people and taught me values that helped me fight against racism," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Auerbach, who was a "red diaper baby," meaning she was the child of communists, 
joined the party in 1962, but her elderly parents have been members most of 
their adult lives. Auerbach, 47, said the move for democracy in Eastern Europe 
was a natural one and part of communism's evolutionary process. But she also 
was surprised by its suddenness. 
</P>
<P>
But does the democratic movement overseas mean communism has been a failure? 
Was communism in fact already failing when Khrushchev issued his threat to the 
West? Do the events in Eastern Europe prove that communists, including Edelman 
and Auerbach, have been wrong for 40 years? 
</P>
<P>
The American couple say the answer to those and similar questions is yes, and 
no. While acknowledging that mistakes were made by communist leaders in the 
past, they said that the errors were understandable and, in some cases, 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman, a retired carpenter and World War II Navy veteran, said communism's 
hard line of the past was prompted by the U.S. policy of containment during the 
Cold War. He credited Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and "Gorbymania" for 
laying the groundwork for democracy in Europe and the world, including the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The movement for peace in the world has been led by Gorbymania," Edelman said. 
"These are the ideas that are moving Europe and the world today. Some leaders, 
communist and non-communist, are unable to grasp these new concepts. . . . The 
cultural exchange (between San Diego and the Soviet Union) proves that people 
in San Diego and the United States want peace and friendship with the Soviets." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of rejecting communism, Auerbach argued that the reform movement in 
communist countries is nothing less than "a continuation of socialism and 
furthering of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
As to arguments that Gorbachev's reforms prove that communism has been a 
failure, he said: 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev says exactly the opposite. He says that the history of the Soviet 
Union is a glorious history, and the history of socialism is a feat 
unparalleled in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Auerbach believes that the United States will eventually end up in the path of 
the current reform movement. 
</P>
<P>
"Capitalism is not serving the needs of the people. . . . My concern is that 
democracy needs to be improved here," she said. "I believe that socialism is 
the way to do this. Socialism, with whatever flaws it has, can do these things 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout their meeting with a reporter, Edelman and Auerbach never talked 
about the proletariat or bourgeoisie, familiar communist buzzwords denoting the 
workers and the capitalists. Their continual promotion of socialism provided 
the only hint of the uncompromising dogma endorsed by the party in the United 
States for more than half a century. 
</P>
<P>
Today, communists endorse and actively support "progressive" candidates when 
party members are not on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't influence the policies and events in Eastern Europe," Edelman said. 
"But we can influence what's happening in the United States. . . . It's 
perfectly logical that we support progressive candidates, even if they aren't 
communists." 
</P>
<P>
Auerbach and Edelman scoffed at the prevailing view of non-communists that U.S. 
communists take their orders from Moscow and are disloyal Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"We view problems in the U.S. from our perspective as Americans," she said. 
"Nobody gives us marching orders. Each country, including the U.S., will travel 
the road to socialism based on its own tradition." 
</P>
<P>
"All communists, no matter where they live, are loyal to their country," said 
Edelman, whose first wife was also a communist. "If any nation -- any nation -- 
were to threaten the U.S., I would defend my country, just like I did in World 
War II." 
</P>
<P>
That the pair ended up as communists is hardly surprising. Edelman's family 
came from the Ukraine. While he was growing up in Queens, New York, his father 
was "an old socialist." Eventually, another brother and sister joined the 
Communist Party. But Edelman himself was a rabid anti-communist while he was in 
the Navy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was young and influenced by the government's campaign against communists. I 
too ridiculed them for being bomb-throwing anarchists. I hated them," Edelman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Auerbach, also a New York native, was an only child, and her communist parents 
live in New Jersey. While she was growing up, her parents made it a policy to 
always live in integrated neighborhoods, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a red-diaper baby. But just because my parents were communists didn't 
automatically make me a communist. . . . I had very little interest in 
communism until 1962, when we were confronted by the Cuban missile crisis and 
the threat of nuclear war," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Auerbach's two sons are party members, but none of Edelman's four children 
joined the party. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry to say they are not communists, but they are not reactionaries, 
either," he said. "Well, they're Democrats."

CREATIONISM AND ATHEISM ENLIVEN RACE; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: TWO SCHOOL BOARD CANDIDATES IN ESCONDIDO ARE AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE 
PHILOSOPHICAL SPECTRUM AND HAVE ADDED CONTROVERSY TO AN OTHERWISE UNREMARKABLE 
RACE.

<P>
Were it not for the presence of a couple of wild cards, Tuesday's balloting to 
fill a seat on the Escondido Union High School District board of trustees might 
be another community election that, at best, would garner yawns among the vast 
majority of voters. 
</P>
<P>
After all, there's only one seat to fill -- and for only 11 months at that, 
thanks to the resignation of a trustee earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper -- in a headline for which it later apologized -- described 
the candidates for the board seat as a "motley field." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the issues have been kicking around for years. Is morale poor among 
teachers and staff, and, if so, how can it be improved? Where should a new high 
school be built -- in northern Escondido or over the hill in Valley Center, 
where 700 or more high school students live? Should the high school district 
unify with the elementary school district, to ultimately reduce overhead and 
improve the continuity of curriculum? 
</P>
<P>
OK, now add some salt and pepper to an otherwise bland campaign. Should 
creationism be taught alongside evolution? 
</P>
<P>
Enter two of the candidates, who, more than the other six, may be in the best 
position to win -- or lose -- votes because of their highly profiled, 
diametrically opposed viewpoints. Voters will have no problem telling them 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
One is the Rev. Billy Falling, 50, a fundamental Christian preacher who five 
years ago founded the Christian Voters League, a political action group that he 
intended to build into a million-strong nationwide organization by 1990. Today 
the group -- which surveys candidates for political office for their moral and 
religious viewpoints, then gives its members a political score card in advance 
of key elections -- has about 1,000 members. This is Falling's first run for 
public office. 
</P>
<P>
The other is Stephen Thorne, 35, director of the San Diego chapter of American 
Atheists. He is perhaps best known for his efforts to denude La Jolla's Mt. 
Soledad of its landmark cross and to force the removal of a Nativity scene from 
Balboa Park's Organ Pavilion. This is Thorne's second try at public office; he 
fared poorly in this year's special election in the 76th Assembly District 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the candidates, Ray Lawrence, 64, credits at least Falling's 
campaign for injecting some interest in the race, even though it might be 
distracting voters from more important local issues. 
</P>
<P>
"He has tremendous nuisance value," Lawrence said. "He irritates people, but he 
gets them to think, and that's good. But that attention is being focused on 
issues that aren't really issues." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence is himself a member of the Christian Voters League, but he says he 
doesn't intend to inject the group's principles into the high school district. 
Rather, the retired high school administrator is campaigning on a theme of 
granting individual schools greater administrative autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
Falling's "objective is to bring a Judeo-Christian ethic into the schoolroom, 
and that's a dilemma," Lawrence said. "Whose morality do you teach?" 
</P>
<P>
Falling is not the only Christian preacher in the race. The other is the Rev. 
Larry Coyle, 55, minister at First Christian Church of Escondido. But Coyle 
says his agenda would be to improve district employee morale, pursue the 
unification of the two districts and focus on drug and dropout problems on the 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Said Coyle of Falling and Thorne: "They both entered the race principally so 
they can have their own personal views aired, and the media is doing that. They 
are polarized around their own issues. They'll have a certain constituency who 
will vote for them, but I don't see them as a threat to the mainstream 
campaigning." 
</P>
<P>
Falling and Thorne would like to believe otherwise, and say their campaigns are 
addressing the very fundamentals of public education. 
</P>
<P>
Falling's campaign is focusing on two basic issues. One is the establishment of 
a 10-member parental advisory group to the board of trustees "so we can return 
the authority of educating our children to the parents." His other goal is to 
see the city of Escondido release redevelopment agency profits that are 
earmarked for the district before it proceeds with plans to build a cultural 
arts complex. 
</P>
<P>
Falling says it's his Christian obligation to inject his sense of morality into 
the schools, and he cites his unsuccessful effort last fall to ban readings 
aloud in class of Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman" after his daughter 
complained about the profanities contained in it. 
</P>
<P>
"The kind of language within the book desensitizes students of moral and 
religious convictions," Falling complained. 
</P>
<P>
He presented a petition signed by 1,300 people to the school board, asking that 
the book not be read, but the trustees said the teacher's decision would stand 
and that Falling's daughter would be allowed to read a different book in the 
school library while Miller's play was read aloud in class. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the arguments to the Supreme Court on the issue of praying in schools 
was that an atheist could go to the library and sit that time out," Falling 
said. "The Supreme Court said that would be discrimination, so we stopped 
prayer in the classroom. Now when it comes to students with religious 
convictions who say they don't want to read a book aloud that uses God's name 
in vain, we send that student to the library. That's real hypocrisy." 
</P>
<P>
Falling said he has not read all of "Death of a Salesman" and that, since the 
play is on the state's list of recommended reading, he doesn't want it banned 
-- simply not read aloud. 
</P>
<P>
"But some books already are censored and we'll continue to censor books in the 
future. We practice it all the time," he said. "The Bible is censored from the 
state reading list." 
</P>
<P>
Falling also insists that creationism should be taught alongside evolution to 
high school students "as one of the explanations for the origin of life. Both 
should be taught, not as a science but as a belief system, a theory, a faith. I 
argue that evolution is a theory and should never be categorized as undisputed 
fact." 
</P>
<P>
On that point, of course, Thorne disagrees -- and it's a disagreement in which 
Falling offers a sort of backhanded compliment to the atheist. 
</P>
<P>
"The two sides are polarized," Falling said. "Unfortunately, I think Steve 
Thorne and I represent the real issues in public education." 
</P>
<P>
His own mission, Falling said, is to inject greater morality into the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a place for evangelism. But Christians should be witnesses to 
Christ wherever they serve. That doesn't mean they try to impose religious 
doctrine in their public leadership, but it does mean they don't compromise 
their moral values and principles in their public leadership." 
</P>
<P>
And that, he said, is why he opposed the reading of "Death of a Salesman." 
"God's name was continually taken in vain. That's in violation of the Ten 
Commandments. We're back to moral absolutes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Thorne said he would prefer that his atheism not surface as an 
issue in the election, but concedes that it has, if for no other reason than 
Falling's constant references to it. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to teach people to teach basic skills better, but we see Falling 
telling people we don't need to teach, we just need to believe," Thorne said. 
"Creationism has its place, but not in a science classroom. Literature, 
perhaps, or philosophy or in a comparative literature course, where you can 
discuss creationism and Christianity all you want." 
</P>
<P>
Thorne said he believes his atheism won't stop Christians from supporting him. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be unfortunate. I'd like to think it won't interfere with people, 
and a very low percentage of people we're calling have a problem with it. More 
of them either don't know I'm an atheist -- I don't call people and say, 'Hi, 
I'm Steve Thorne, an atheist, running for school board' -- or they don't care. 
I want them to think I'm a reasonable guy who's listed in the phone book who 
they can call at home, who is widely read and open-minded to new ideas." 
</P>
<P>
But if you ask Thorne who he believes the top three vote getters will be 
Tuesday, he's willing to name two: himself and Falling. 
</P>
<P>
Another front-runner is acknowledged to be Bill Horn, 46, a Valley Center 
resident who was initially appointed to the school board to fill the vacancy 
last summer. His appointment was criticized by Bill Tomkins, 69, a retired 
salesman, who in turn garnered enough signatures to force a special election to 
fill the vacancy, and who announced his own candidacy for the post when the 
only other announced candidate at the time was Horn. 
</P>
<P>
Horn says he is the only one of the eight candidates -- or of the four sitting 
trustees, for that matter -- who currently has a child in an Escondido high 
school, and therefore argues that he would be the best spokesman for parents in 
the district. Horn is a property manager and avocado grower. 
</P>
<P>
Horn downplays any influence that Thorne and Falling might have on the race. 
"They provide more options, but I think people are more interested in the 
business of the district than the other issues they (Falling and Thorne) are 
raising. The voters are not dumb. They can see through the chaff of some of 
that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Of the eight candidates, only Coyle, Lawrence and Horn had applied for the 
appointment to the vacancy last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining candidates are Harold Polesetsky, 60, an architect and general 
contractor, and Terry Cottrell, 41, a real estate property manager. 
</P>
<P>
The winner will finish the term vacated by Don McArthur, who resigned last 
June, 1 1/2 years short of his term. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the special election, which was sparked by the petition with a 
little more than 1,000 signatures, is estimated at $120,000.

MENTAL HEALTH: OUR COUNTY JAIL HOUSES MORE MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE THAN THE LARGEST 
HOSPITAL. TREATMENT IS ESSENTIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By E. FULLER TORREY, E. Fuller Torrey is a research psychiatrist in Washington 
and author of Nowhere to Go: The Tragic Odyssey of the Homeless Mentally Ill 
(Harper &amp; Row, 1988). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Jail has become the largest unofficial mental hospital 
in the United States. According to professionals who have worked there, 15% of 
the jail's approximately 24,000 prisoners -- 3,600 individuals -- are seriously 
mentally ill with schizophrenia or manic-depressive illness. Those individuals 
total 641 more than are held in America's largest medical facility for the 
mentally ill, Pilgrim State Hospital in New York. The 3,600 mentally ill 
individuals in the Los Angeles County Jail are, in fact, the same number as the 
total held in California's four state hospitals (Napa, Patton, Camarillo and 
Metropolitan). Each day, seven days a week, approximately 1,000 new prisoners 
are booked into the Los Angeles County Jail, of which 150 are seriously 
mentally ill; there is no other psychiatric facility in the world that admits 
150 new patients each day. 
</P>
<P>
The situation in Los Angeles is part of a national trend, one of the 
consequences of having abolished 80% of all state mental hospital beds since 
1955 without adequate follow-up and outpatient care for patients being 
released. 
</P>
<P>
America's jails and public shelters have become the new mental hospitals. 
Several studies in different parts of the country have shown that approximately 
10% of all jail inmates and 30% of all public shelter residents suffer from 
schizophrenia or manic-depressive illness. These are now known to be disorders 
of the brain, like Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
The situation in Los Angeles County is more serious because its public 
mental-health services have for many years been among the worst in California. 
Budget cuts within the last year have decimated outpatient services and pushed 
the system to the point of collapse. Even the nationally recognized Skid Row 
Mental Health Clinic at Sixth and San Pedro streets has lost half of its staff 
within the last year. In October, for the first time, the clinic no longer had 
the staff to run outreach teams to treat homeless mentally ill people living on 
the streets and in the parks; many of these untreated individuals will end up 
in County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Most individuals with serious mental illnesses are not dangerous if they are 
treated; studies have shown that the crime rate for the treated mentally ill is 
lower than that for the general population. If they are not treated, however, 
some individuals with mental illnesses do become violent. They do so because 
they believe that others may be trying to hurt them so they strike first, or 
they may be ordered by "voices" -- auditory hallucinations -- to commit violent 
acts. Or they may simply be so confused that they are unable to act logically. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Dr. Richard Lamb at the University of Southern California followed up 
85 seriously mentally ill persons in Los Angeles County who had been charged 
with crimes. Of this group, 92% had been arrested for felonies (the majority 
for murder, attempted murder, rape, armed robbery and assault with a deadly 
weapon) and 86% had had previous psychiatric hospitalizations. Yet two years 
after their arrests, 64% had been released and, in more than half of the cases, 
there were no plans for follow-up or treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is significantly worse now than it was in 1983. Each day, seven 
days a week, the Los Angeles County Jail releases approximately 150 seriously 
mentally ill individuals who have been charged with crimes. There is nowhere to 
refer them for outpatient care because the county clinics are already full. 
Families are often frightened of them, knowing that these people will 
deteriorate without their necessary medications. 
</P>
<P>
The situation in Los Angeles County is on a collision course with catastrophe. 
Violent episodes are not merely threats or probabilities, they are statistical 
certainties. And the greatest tragedy of all is that such episodes are 
completely preventable.

AMERICA'S WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Instead of feeling smug about the demise of communism and the yearning for 
freedom and democracy in the Eastern Bloc, we might do well to look to the 
state of freedom and democracy in our own country. We've got a wall of our own 
that needs to come down -- the wall between the power class and the ordinary 
citizen. 
</P>
<P>
The HUD scandal, the savings and loan scandal, the defense contractor scandal 
(which has become strangely silent in recent months) demonstrate that the 
government is being run primarily for the benefit of the rich and powerful. 
Contrast these shameful happenings with the denial of abortion to poor women 
who are raped or victims of incest, the lack of health care for the poor, the 
measly rise of the minimum wage, the lack of child care, the wave of 
union-busting, and the picture becomes clear. 
</P>
<P>
We're building more prisons, but for whom? Certainly not for those who buy 
senators and congressmen and help them rip off the public. Not for people like 
Ollie North who tramples on the Constitution, not for defense contractors who 
bilk the public out of billions. Not for former members of the cabinet who made 
phone calls to colleagues to enrich themselves and their friends. For whom, 
then? For a guy who steals a loaf of bread or gets caught with a couple of 
joints in his pocket? 
</P>
<P>
Come on, America. Let's look at our own wall and start chipping!

MEDICARE FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I continue to read of the impending alteration of Medicare reimbursement to 
physicians, I get more and more angry (Part A, Nov. 21). If any other 
profession was as bizarrely regulated as is medicine, the resultant uproar 
would be deafening. I certainly can understand the government's interest in 
protecting the poor and disabled in society, but it seems intent on legislating 
with a bulldozer to affect the billing of all my patients. Of course the 
private insurers, who are the real crooks, will quickly follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
If it were legislated that I take care of patients who are below a certain 
income/asset standard for insurance only, that would be fine -- I already do 
that as often as possible. However, the government has no business insuring an 
older wealthy industrialist or then telling me I cannot charge him what I would 
charge a younger person. 
</P>
<P>
Many would perhaps ask if doctors do not already make too much money, and for 
them to complain is merely indicative of their greed. I don't know how to judge 
how much is too much, but if you compare what a physician earns relative to a 
good attorney or CEO, especially when you consider the 24-hour calls and years 
of schooling, I think medical care in the United States is a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, I may be getting worked up over nothing -- if Congress implements 
the current recommendations with its usual alacrity, I may be retired prior to 
its taking effect. And those guys want a raise!

BUSINESS AFTER MALTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Except for the weather, which was the stormiest to bang at Malta in a decade, 
this was the No Surprise Summit. Yet rarely has the very lack of surprise 
prompted more applause. The world, and certainly both superpowers, wanted a 
summit meeting that had "business as usual" stamped all over it; people wanted 
the two superpower leaders to get to work in a calm businesslike fashion. No 
megaproposals out of left, or even right, field, please. Just make the world a 
better, safer place, thank you very much. And that's precisely what President 
Bush and Soviet President Gorbachev appear to be purposefully striding towards. 
</P>
<P>
Not only can the two leaders do business with each other, there's evidence that 
the business volume is to be increased dramatically. A full-fledged nuclear 
arms control summit is on tap for June. Negotiations to reduce conventional 
forces in Europe will speed up. The extraordinary complexities of an agreement 
to ban chemical weapons will be attacked. This move on chemical warfare 
represents a major and highly commendable concession by Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also promised to help Moscow obtain its longtime goal of observer 
status at GATT (the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs) -- yet another 
switch in Administration policy. It's true that the superpower leaders failed 
to make any progress on the contentious issues of naval arms control and Soviet 
involvement in Central America, but in the now-patented cool-cucumber ah-shucks 
Bush style they low-keyed this whole business as best they could. 
</P>
<P>
The eyeball-to-eyeball chemistry between the leaders was evident in their joint 
press conference -- as if two CEOs were discoursing calmly about the 
possibility of a business upturn. It is devoutly to be wished that this 
superpower chemistry is bankable and that both sides will be able to draw on it 
in the months to come. The rapidly evolving events in Eastern Europe and 
elsewhere continue to astonish. The two leaders apparently agreed not to try to 
micromanage the German situation but to leave it to history, as it were. Lots 
of luck, there. Just yesterday East German leader Egon Krenz and the entire 
Communist party leadership resigned, leaving the fate of that country to an 
interim panel of reformers -- and, one supposes, "history." But history is not 
always efficient, nor does it always produce results that the world is 
comfortable with -- much like the weather in normally pacific Malta.

DEFENSE JOBS

<TEXT>
<P>
It must be apparent by now to everyone that most of the foot-dragging in 
cutting the budget of the military has very little, if anything, to do with our 
defense against the crumbling states of the Eastern Bloc, or China, for that 
matter. It has everything to do with profits (much of it generated by 
overcharges or waste) and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time for the federal government to issue a timetable for conversion 
and assure workers that their skills will be used to build a new, prosperous 
economy based on civilian needs. The political fallout would be minimal if 
people knew that their livelihoods would not be threatened, and indeed, that 
they would be contributing to the betterment of the world and not the wasting 
of our scarce resources for destructive purposes.

U.S.-ARAB RELATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Does Saudi Arabia have a "consistent record of commitment to economic and 
political stability in the Middle East," as Shehab claims? If so, this 
commitment is at the expense and to the detriment of Third World and Western 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
During the economically turbulent 1970s and early 1980s, oil price gouging by 
Saudi Arabia and OPEC plunged the world's economies into crisis. Remember $40 
barrels of oil and the long lines at gasoline stations? 
</P>
<P>
Adding to Saudi Arabia's lack of concern for the U.S. economy is its voting 
record at the United Nations. Saudi Arabia voted with the United States only 8% 
of the time, while voting in agreement with the Soviet Union 100% of the time. 
Thus, politically and economically, Saudi Arabia has, more often than not, 
maintained a record of opposition to U.S. interests. 
</P>
<P>
Shehab's claim that this Saudi "friendship" should be rewarded in the form of 
U.S. tank sales is outrageous and insulting. Saudi Arabia has demonstrated 
again and again its preoccupation with its own self-interest and an 
unwillingness to aid America's interests.

<P>
Now that the people of Czechoslovakia have forced the Communist Party to give 
up its monopoly on power, what does the future hold? 
</P>
<P>
If there were free elections today, the Communist Party would get perhaps 10% 
of the vote. Even great numbers of party members wouldn't vote for the party. 
It is disintegrating as a political force with each passing moment. 
</P>
<P>
But what of socialism generally? As a theory or a model, socialism has 
collapsed completely. What people care about in this country is prosperity, 
democracy and clean air. They care about well-stocked markets and good 
theaters. In short, they are interested in mechanisms that can create these 
conditions, not grand models of society. 
</P>
<P>
People are totally fed up with all the talk about socialism over the past 
decades; they feel antipathy toward it because they link it with repression. 
Socialism in Czechoslovakia can be discussed again in a more sensible way only 
if a new Social Democratic Party is formed along the lines of the Spanish or 
German Social Democrats; if the present Communist Party manages to transform 
itself into a modern party that tries to influence events exclusively by 
political means; and if a new all-European socialist left is formed that would 
give new meaning to this ideology. Only under such circumstances could 
socialists then compete persuasively with liberal and Roman Catholic forces 
here in the same civil way they do elsewhere in Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In making our transition from the past, we have the same aim as the other 
democratic movements that have recently coursed through Eastern Europe: 
dismantling Stalinism in the political and economic system and returning to 
civilization. We all want a restoration of classical attributes, pluralist 
democracy and, above all, a modern market economy. 
</P>
<P>
A modern market system, however, doesn't necessarily mean capitalism. Pure 
capitalism, after all, hasn't been around for that long, even in the West. 
Rather, there are different mixes of state and market. 
</P>
<P>
The basic principles of a market economy are the same everywhere. At issue is 
the final social synthesis of pluralist democracy and the market economy. In a 
market economy, socialist ideals are expressed in the social, not economic, 
policies through redistribution of private profits for health care, child care, 
and so on. We could conceivably end up with a "social synthesis" of the Swedish 
type, or a "liberal synthesis" of the West German type. 
</P>
<P>
In Czechoslovakia, we are particularly eager to avoid the serious problems of 
inflation and unemployment that have hit Poland and, to a lesser degree, 
Hungary. We Czechs are used to full employment and social protection from the 
disruptions of a dynamic market, so we must avoid mass unemployment and too 
great a loss of social security. Our distinct advantage, as a belated entrant 
in the reform era, is that we can learn from the mistakes of others. While we 
obviously cannot reform without hardship, the experiences elsewhere in the East 
show that there must also be results very soon. 
</P>
<P>
The brunt of hardship, I believe, should fall on the state enterprises that 
have been protected for so long: They must now face the economic pressure of 
competition. Surely, that will drive many of them into bankruptcy, but the 
consumer will benefit immediately from the broader selection of goods and the 
more flexible supply of the profitable firms that are able to respond to 
consumer needs and tastes. Pensioners and young families with children, on the 
other hand, should be spared the hardship of structural change, which is why we 
must avoid inflation. 
</P>
<P>
What Czechoslovakia needs is a program to de-bureaucratize the society, 
introduce market forces, stop ecological destruction and resume the effort to 
put a human face on Czech socialism. 
</P>
<P>
The Western European countries weren't ready for what has happened in Hungary, 
Poland, East Germany and Czechoslovakia. They imagined that Eastern Europe 
would stew in its own juices while they formed a common market. For them, "a 
common European house" was more an exalted figure of speech than something to 
be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks all that has changed. Europe is emerging with a unified 
cultural tradition and political perspective. Adding 100 million new people to 
a nearly integrated market of 350 million can make Europe a formidable 
competitor in the world economy to North America and the Pacific Basin. With 
East and West united again, the once unimaginable revival of European 
civilization will be at hand.

IN EARTHQUAKE RUBBLE, A TOWN FINALLY SEES HOW POOR IT IS; 
</P>
<P>
LIVING: WATSONVILLE IS TEMPTED TO PROFIT FROM DISASTER: OUT WITH THE TUMBLEDOWN 
SHACKS, UP WITH SUBURBAN TRACTS AND MALLS. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE NOW-HOMELESS FARM 
WORKERS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn is a columnist for The Nation, from 
which this article is excerpted. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The place I've called home for the past year or so is a motel just off Route 1 
as it heads down the Pacific coast from Santa Cruz to Watsonville. Late on the 
night of the earthquake a friend called me from her home near Carmel, an hour's 
drive south, to tell me what had happened. It was early the next day with me, 
since I was in southern Ireland, having just buried my mother. God was having a 
busy month of it. Aside from Hurricane Hugo and the earthquake, he had found 
time to direct a few cows into the path of a train carrying pilgrims to a 
shrine in County Clare. 
</P>
<P>
It was hard to get news of the earthquake's damage directly from my motel, but 
secondhand reports indicated that it was still standing. When I got back some 
weeks later, the kind Dutch ladies who live next door had cleaned everything 
up. In my kitchen there was a bucket full of broken crockery and the remains of 
Robespierre's head. I had had plaster of Paris bas-reliefs of Robespierre and 
Saint-Just hanging on the wall. At a shock of 7.1 on the Richter scale, 
Robespierre, who believed in the Supreme Being, plunged from the wall. 
Saint-Just, who probably agreed with Fouche that the words "Death is nothing 
but eternal sleep" should be posted at the gates of all French cemeteries, 
dropped too, but stayed in one piece. I could have applied for federal 
emergency funds to buy a couple of teacups and a new Robespierre, but it didn't 
seem worth the trouble. Around the motel, residential and catering to the lower 
end of the income scale, the fear was that the owner would himself use 
disaster-relief to upscale the place and throw everyone into the street. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of days later I went for a walk around Watsonville with my friend 
Frank Bardacke, who's lived there for 17 years. Watsonville, about 18 miles 
from the epicenter in the Santa Cruz Mountains, had been hit the worst. Of 765 
buildings destroyed in Santa Cruz County, 333 were in Watsonville, as were 533 
of the 2,438 buildings countywide suffering major damage. We walked along 
Lincoln Street and at first all seemed well, aside from tumbled chimneys 
announcing the folly of building with brick in California. Then there'd be a 
swath of disaster: boarded-up windows, porches askew, red tags on the front 
doors indicating that the places were done for. 
</P>
<P>
Watsonville is a Third World town, meaning it is cheaply built, and though the 
price of a handful of nails would have meant foundation posts securely 
toenailed in, a lot of the poorer houses had been just resting on their pier 
blocks until the tremors pushed them off. 
</P>
<P>
Prospect, where Frank and his family live, is a nice-looking street, typically 
working-class in a mostly working-class farm town -- single-story wood houses, 
a bit of lawn out front. On Frank's block the earthquake knocked out five 
houses, which had nine Mexican families living in them. By such a count you can 
reckon that Watsonville's population, officially 30,000, is probably almost 
twice that number. Throughout the town, garages behind Victorian houses had 
held families paying $400 a month to sleep among vermin, getting their power 
from the main building, into which more families were crammed. So as the earth 
shook and the shacks fell, some of the working poor upgraded from garage slum 
to emergency quarters under canvas. Even the local newspaper, the 
Register-Pajaronian, felt emboldened to concede that the earthquake, a 
"natural" disaster, had merely highlighted the entirely human disaster of a 
town that, by the laws of motion of late American capitalism, had long ceased 
to provide affordable housing for the people from whose labor the wealth of the 
town derived. When the tremors stopped, people saw that the earthquake had 
posed more strongly than ever the question, what sort of a town is Watsonville 
to be? 
</P>
<P>
Two hours south of San Francisco, Watsonville is at the head of the most 
productive vegetable-growing area in the world. Between May and October, the 
area produces about 80% of the fresh vegetables consumed in the United States. 
But for the past 10 years, as the seasons rolled by, economic pressures have 
been building toward upheaval just as surely as the tectonic plates grinding 
against each other along the fault lines through the Santa Cruz Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, a decade ago, Watsonville faced south down to the fields of 
the Salinas Valley whence came truckloads of vegetables into the frozen-food 
plants. Today, as Frank wrote in the excellent local bilingual monthly El 
Andar, it lives in the shadow of San Jose, one hour north: "Computer production 
has crept over Highway 17 into Scotts Valley, and in the last 10 years housing 
projects have shot up on the north side of town, peopled by folks who come to 
Watsonville to sleep by the Pacific Ocean, leaving low-paid computer assembly 
workers to live in the smog and drink the polluted water of what was once the 
Santa Clara Valley. We now seem to sit not at the head of the Salinas Valley 
but at the foot of the Valley of Silicon." 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural land worth $18,000 an acre is steadily being converted into 
building land worth anywhere from $55,000 to $110,000 an acre. And gleaming in 
the eye of every booster in town is the utopia promised by the powerful 
manipulators of real estate: a bedroom suburb with shopping centers where once 
the spinach grew, the working-class pushed into joblessness or over the Coastal 
Range into rural slums in the Central Valley, or back into Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
In Watsonville, City Manager John Radin toured the streets, civil engineer in 
tow. Radin dreams of a Watsonville renewed in the image of Santa Rosa, a 
metastasizing node on the lymph glands running north from San Francisco. To 
observant citizens, there seemed to be a politically coherent pattern to 
Radin's allocation of red tags. Down would go the International Senior Center 
for poor people, and down would go other venerable obstructions to progress. 
</P>
<P>
But Radin's joy was not unalloyed. This small farm town he's been managing is 
politically sophisticated. Earlier this year the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that 
Watsonville's system of citywide elections was unconstitutional because it 
discriminated against Latinos. Although the vast majority of the population is 
Mexican and Chicano, only one Chicano has sat on the City Council, and he is a 
real estate agent. A court-mandated election on Tuesday promises to give some 
voice to the Mexican and working-class neighborhoods. Many candidates have 
vowed to use that voice to fire City Manager Radin. 
</P>
<P>
But in Watsonville, it is not the official candidates, right or left, who lead 
the way. After the earthquake some homeless workers planted their tents in 
Callaghan Park, right in the center of town. City officials implored the people 
to remove to sanctioned refuge on the edge of town, out of sight and out of 
mind. The homeless stayed put. Here was the political pressure of visible 
deprivation, as opposed to the obscure hell of a garage shack behind a picket 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
I walked through the park with Frank. There was a crowd around someone who had 
come to hand out a load of supplies. Others were standing near the bank of 
public telephones where, for a while after the quake, people could call free to 
Mexico. Frank chatted with a friend who told him that the people were spending 
their days around the tents, but they were sleeping in a house across town. 
"Why?" Frank asked. "It's cold," the man answered matter-of-factly. As did many 
of Watsonville's astute inhabitants, he understood how to use symbolism. Here, 
with the unauthorized tent city, was an opportunity maybe to prize a trailer 
home out of the government, coaxing opportunity from disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Watsonville and the earthquake pose one of the central political questions of 
the late 1980s. The earthquake left somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 people 
homeless. Meanwhile, "executive townhomes" are rising off Pennsylvania Drive at 
a starting price of $176,000 for two bedrooms; this in a town where by official 
count 17% of the residents live in overcrowded conditions and, as we have seen, 
the real figure is probably twice that. 
</P>
<P>
West of Watsonville, along the sea's edge, is Sunset Beach and the condo 
complex of Pajaro Dunes, mostly empty second homes of San Franciscans, 
sometimes rented out for corporate retreats. Between Pajaro Dunes and the town 
stretch artichoke fields worked by people who have nowhere to sleep but their 
cars. Everyone in Watsonville can see the class geography, and the quake has 
brought to the surface the earthly potential of an act of God. 
</P>
<P>
At what point should a town declare eminent domain and seize developments like 
Pennsylvania Drive and Pajaro Dunes to house its people? Saint-Just knew the 
answer.

CAUSE OF CHULA VISTA JAIL BRAWL SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 100 inmates at the County Jail in Chula Vista remained locked down in 
their cells Sunday night as jailers continued to investigate a brawl that sent 
four inmates to the hospital Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The fight erupted about 10 p.m. in a medium-security cellblock, Module 1A, 
after two inmates had a disagreement, according to Sgt. Paul Nevills of the San 
Diego County Sherriff's Department. Soon 25 to 30 inmates joined the fray, he 
said, and, by the time deputies broke up the fight, three inmates had been 
stabbed and one had a broken hand. 
</P>
<P>
The jail, which was designed to hold 192 inmates, housed about 900 over the 
weekend. On Saturday, jailers decided that all inmates would remain locked in 
their cells until the cause of the brawl was determined. By Sunday night, 
however, only Module 1A was locked down. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's back to normal, except for that module," said Sgt. Chris Von 
Olnhausen.

LAKERS TAKE LOSS TO PISTONS OUT ON THE KNICKS, 115-104 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Post-Piston Depression did not hit the Lakers Sunday night. Instead of 
wallowing in the frustration of Friday night's overtime collapse, the Lakers 
took it out on the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers repelled repeated Knick runs for a 115-104 victory before 17,505 at 
the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Had the Lakers not rebounded Sunday night -- and rebounding was only one of the 
reasons for the victory -- the specter of rare back-to-back home losses would 
have really put the Lakers in a funk. 
</P>
<P>
That did not happen, though, thanks in part to the Lakers' 47-39 rebounding 
edge, their double-teaming defensive pressure on Patrick Ewing and strong play 
from four reserves. 
</P>
<P>
En route to regaining the NBA's best record at 12-3, and taking the Pacific 
Division lead back from the Portland Trail Blazers, the Lakers withstood two 
serious second-half rallies by the Knicks (10-6), who ended a trip that 
included four games in five nights. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Magic Johnson's 20 points, which included a three-point basket 
and long jump shot late in the game that buried the Knicks, and James Worthy's 
22, the Lakers received lifts from backup point guard Larry Drew in the fourth 
quarter, reserve centers Vlade Divac and Mark McNamara and Michael Cooper's 
steady play. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers certainly did not stop Ewing, who had two 40-point outbursts earlier 
in the week. Ewing finished with a game-high 29 points, 25 coming in the second 
half when he made nine of 15 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Foul trouble put Ewing on the bench for all but eight minutes in the first 
half, but, in the second half, he did not dominate the game, as the Lakers had 
feared. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing and a third-quarter lull notwithstanding, the Lakers were satisfied with 
the way they bounced back from Friday's loss to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Pat Riley was so worried about possible lingering effects that he gave 
the Lakers the day off on Saturday and did not breath a word about that loss 
before Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"It bothered me," Riley said of the Detroit game. "Not that we lost, but how we 
lost. I know it bothered the players. I didn't want to make any references to 
it, just go on to New York." 
</P>
<P>
Laker players said the Pistons were the farthest things from their minds on 
Sunday. But the day after, Saturday, was another matter. 
</P>
<P>
"That ruined our day off," Mychal Thompson said. "We spent that day brooding 
about it. But if we would've had the Pistons in the back of our minds, the 
Knicks would have walked all over us." 
</P>
<P>
That did not happen, mostly because many of the Lakers' failings in the Piston 
loss did not arise again. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Detroit loss, the Laker bench came through Sunday. Divac scored 11 
first-half points when Thompson got in foul trouble. McNamara scored five 
points in the second half when both Thompson and Divac got in foul trouble. 
Cooper played most of the fourth quarter and was a steadying influence. 
</P>
<P>
And after the Knicks pulled to 89-88 with 9:33 to play, Drew scored six points 
in a 13-5 Laker run that put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
"They (reserves) took the shots they had tonight," Johnson said. "The other 
night, they just looked for James and me for the shots after the ball went to 
the post. Our bench played very well, and they are going to have to." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said: "We got a nice lift off our bench. Mark came in and played well. 
Larry moved the ball in the fourth quarter. And had Vlade not gotten into foul 
trouble, he would have put up some big numbers." 
</P>
<P>
But Riley was not totally happy with the Laker effort. 
</P>
<P>
A major concern was the Lakers' 5:17 third-quarter scoring drought, not as 
severe as Friday night's 8:02 lapse against the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the Lakers' second-half slump began after they had taken an 11-point 
lead with 9:39 to play in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks were able to take a 68-64 lead, helped by eight Laker turnovers in 
12 possessions. The Lakers also missed all 12 of their shots during the slump. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers recovered to regain the lead, 82-79, heading into the fourth 
quarter. It took all the Lakers' effort, however. Johnson finally ended the 
scoring drought with a layup and accompanying free throw. That was followed by 
a dunk by A.C. Green off Thompson's miss, then a Byron Scott layup off a Knick 
miss. 
</P>
<P>
The teams traded leads once more late in the third quarter, before baskets by 
McNamara and Johnson in the last 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing had yet to hit stride during that third-quarter Knicks run, although he 
had 12 points in the quarter. He then scored the Knicks' first nine points in 
1:35 of the fourth quarter, pulling New York to 89-88. 
</P>
<P>
That would be as close as the Knicks would get, despite Ewing. He had 17 of the 
Knicks' 25 fourth-quarter points, but the Lakers spread around their 33 points 
in the period. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good thing (Ewing) got in foul trouble early," Thompson said. "We 
couldn't control him in the second half. He was unstoppable." 
</P>
<P>
The secret to the Lakers' success Sunday night? 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have to show anything tonight," Johnson said. "We're not in the 
playoffs yet. We had to put Detroit in the back of our minds, as we did. If 
not, the Knicks would've beaten us." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Forward Orlando Woolridge, on the injured list after arthroscopic surgery on 
Oct. 17 to remove bone fragments from his right knee, said Sunday he probably 
will be ready to return to action this week. . . . Reserve center Mark 
McNamara, who had been suffering from dizziness recently and passed out in his 
hotel room in Sacramento on Wednesday, said Sunday that results of a 24-hour 
monitoring of his heart showed no abnormality. "They think it was just related 
to the flu I had," McNamara said. "But they told me to watch for any dizziness. 
I felt fine today." McNamara explained his fainting spell on Wednesday: "I had 
been feeling a little light-headed that day, and when I got up to answer the 
door when the maid knocked, I opened it and, I guess, fell backward right in 
front of the maid. I fell straight back. I was lucky I didn't hit my head on 
anything. I do have a big scratch on my arm. I woke up about 10 seconds after I 
passed out. I didn't want to go to the doctor, because I knew they'd do 
something like this to me. But Gary (Vitti, the Laker trainer) made me."

CHARGERS MISFIRE FROM START TO FINISH 
</P>

<P>
The Chargers started a rookie quarterback named Billy Joe Tolliver Sunday. They 
lost to the Jets, 20-17, because he was Billy Joe Terrible. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see any good points in my performance today," Tolliver said after 
completing 24 of 51 passes for 230 yards, throwing two interceptions and 
getting sacked five times. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't all his fault. Chris Bahr could have sent the game into overtime but 
pushed a 37-yard field goal attempt wide right with 10 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
And Tolliver's offensive teammates, an odd assortment of injury-plagued free 
agents and Plan B types were Just Barely Tolerable. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have a great deal of help around Billy Joe," Charger Coach Dan 
Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
All of which was Pretty Much Horrible for a Charger defense that has now held 
11 consecutive opponents to fewer than 21 points. The Chargers have won only 
four of those games. 
</P>
<P>
The defense sacked Jet quarterbacks five times, including two by Pro Bowl 
defensive end Lee Williams. Williams took over the team and AFC lead in sacks 
from Leslie O'Neal. Williams now has 12. 
</P>
<P>
But the loss was the Chargers' third in a row, dropped them to 4-9 and (in case 
anybody was still wondering) mathematically eliminated them from the playoffs. 
The Jets, also 4-9, have won two in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Tolliver's trouble stemmed from inexperience. This was only his second 
NFL start. But he also had problems throwing passes that required touch. 
</P>
<P>
On more than one occasion, many of the 38,954 in attendance -- the Chargers' 
smallest crowd of the year -- booed lustily. "I've been booed before," Tolliver 
said. "Those people paid their money." 
</P>
<P>
The Jets, ranked last in NFL defense after 12 weeks, were smart enough to try 
to confuse Tolliver. And they succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
"They were in some defenses in the first half and early in the second where I 
wasn't sure what was going on," Tolliver said. 
</P>
<P>
"You could tell he hadn't been in game situations," New York cornerback Bobby 
Humphrey said. "You could could play with his mind a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
So, yes, the Charger quarterback, at times, was Billy Joe Gullible. 
</P>
<P>
Several Jet defenders said they kept waiting for Henning to insert veteran Jim 
McMahon, but Henning said he never came close to making such a move. He also 
said Tolliver will "probably" remain his starter next week in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Both Tolliver interceptions cost the Chargers dearly. The first occurred late 
in the first period after Ken O'Brien's underhand pitch to running back Johnny 
Hector on third-and-seven resulted in a nine-yard touchdown pass and a 7-0 New 
York lead. 
</P>
<P>
Hector's score was highlighted by a textbook block on Elvis Patterson by Jet 
right tackle Reggie McElroy and completed a 47-yard, seven-play drive set up by 
JoJo Townsell's 30-yard punt return. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Jamie Holland responded with a 34-yard return on the ensuing kickoff. 
Pass interference on Humphrey moved the Chargers to the New York 20. But two 
plays later, Tolliver threw into double coverage, and cornerback James Hasty 
intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, the Chargers tied the score with five minutes remaining in the half 
on a 40-yard magical mystery tour up the middle by rookie running back Marion 
Butts, who broke at least five tackles on the play. "As good a run as I've seen 
this year," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
"I could smell the end zone," said Butts, who scored seven touchdowns in the 
first six weeks but none in the next five. "It had been a long time." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers took the lead late in the third period on a 39-yarder by Bahr, set 
up by Lester Lyles' interception of a Pat Ryan pass. Ryan had replaced O'Brien, 
who jammed his shoulder in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Lyles' interception was one of three by the Charger defense, which also 
recovered a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets regained the lead on a one-yard touchdown run by Roger Vick. And they 
stretched that margin to 20-10 on a 14-yard rumble by Vick. Pat Leahy missed 
the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
Vick's 76 yards on 16 carries complemented Hector's game-high 106 yards rushing 
on 20 tries. The Jets, ranked 22nd in rushing coming in, totaled 181 yards, the 
most allowed by the Chargers this year. 
</P>
<P>
Vick's second touchdown came after Erik McMillan intercepted an ill-advised 
Tolliver bomb and returned it 40 yards to the Charger 16. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the stupidest plays of the year," Tolliver said. "That's a play any 
high school kid knows not to do. It's a team sport. But when you get down to 
the final analysis, that interception I threw cost us the game." 
</P>
<P>
But thanks to Leahy's miss, the Chargers weren't dead yet. After O'Neal 
recovered a Vick fumble at the Jet 49, Tolliver hurried them upfield. His 
eight-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Miller cut the deficit to 20-17 with 3:25 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
Miller has scored six touchdowns in the past five games and a team-high nine 
this year. He finished Sunday with seven receptions for 70 yards. 
</P>
<P>
After a Jet punt, the Chargers took over on their 44. Six plays later, Bahr 
pushed what would have been the game-tying field goal. He was six of eight from 
between the 30 and 39 before the miss. 
</P>
<P>
"The snap was fine, the hold was fine, Chris told me he just got a little 
behind it," holder David Archer said. "It's like a golf shot that you hit a 
little fat and leave it out to the right." 
</P>
<P>
Leahy, watching from the sidelines, figured Bahr was a cinch to make it because 
Leahy's missed extra point had left the door open. "And I'm sitting there 
thinking 'it's all because of you, you jerk,' " he said. "I was sitting there 
thinking what he (Bahr) must be thinking now." 
</P>
<P>
Or as Billy Joe Tolliver, who hails from Boyd, Tex. and talks as if he just 
walked out of a Dan Jenkins novel, put it: "It just looked like today we were 
snakebit and born to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Charger Coach Dan Henning said he had no problem with the "in-the-grasp" ruling 
late in the third period that negated what would have been a Lee Williams 
touchdown return of an interception. "I heard the whistle," Henning said. "It 
was a correct call." The whistle signified that Les Miller had sacked Jet 
quarterback Pat Ryan for an 11-yard loss before Williams got his hands on the 
ball. . . . Williams' 55 1/2 career sacks are second in Charger history to Gary 
(Big Hands) Johnson who 67. . . . The last time Jet kicker Pat Leahy missed an 
extra point was in Week 14 of 1985 against the Bills. . . . Believe it or not, 
the Chargers have scored 25 touchdowns this year, their opponents 24. . . . The 
Chargers were a miserable four of 19 (21%) on third-down conversions. . . . 
Asked to assess rookie quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver's performance, wide 
receiver Anthony Miller said, "I really don't have any comment on that. I'm not 
a person to judge. I've got to worry about my job." Charger wide receiver Wayne 
Walker, when asked the same question: "I'm not one to assess anybody." Henning 
on the same question: "Roller coaster-like. Billy Joe played poorly in the 
first half and got better at the end." Said running back Marion Butts: "I think 
Billy Joe did a good job with the exception of the interceptions. Lack of 
playing time will hurt anybody."

RAMS' VICTORY IS ROUTINE -- WRESTED LATE IN GAME; 
</P>
<P>
NFL: AFTER SEEING A 14-POINT LEAD SHRINK AND THEN DISAPPEAR, EVERETT RALLIES 
CLUB PAST DALLAS COWBOYS, 35-31.

<P>
It turns out Sunday's game was no sweat for the Rams only because of the field 
temperature, 46 degrees; not the Dallas Cowboys, who didn't roll over after 
all. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, the Cowboys proved that beneath a clinically dead franchise 
beats a strong heart belonging to quarterback Troy Aikman, who managed to fill 
Texas Stadium with a few craved-for glimpses of yesterday and hope for the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
If you're not going to win, it's best to fill the stadium with something. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, as usual, provided the stage, matches and gasoline, blowing a 
two-touchdown, first-quarter lead and ultimately the lead itself before 
rallying for two touchdowns in the final 3:58 to beat Dallas, 35-31. 
</P>
<P>
Merely another day at the office during a season that knows no mercy even in 
lost-cause venues such as Dallas, where the Cowboys spilled and thrilled their 
way to a 13th consecutive home loss. They are 1-12 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
So what was perhaps the decade's worst team doing on the Rams' 17-yard line 
with 12 seconds left and a chance to win? 
</P>
<P>
Enough wrong things to get the Rams out of Texas with a season left to play for 
next Monday night against San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, you knew it was coming. After a 50-minute search for their 
motivation, the Rams had it shoved in their faces when Aikman's 10-yard 
touchdown pass to Bernard Ford put the Cowboys ahead by 10 points with 9:34 to 
play 
</P>
<P>
Ram quarterback Jim Everett responded with scoring passes of 39 and 23 yards to 
Ron Brown and Aaron Cox in a span of two minutes, eight seconds to save the 
Rams again. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Cox's score, with 1:50 left, almost came too early. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'd thought about it, I would have had Aaron stop on the one-yard line (to 
run out the clock)," Rams Coach John Robinson quipped. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' hope remained rooted in a last-minute Dallas collapse; some mental 
breakdowns, perhaps. Show us the stuff of 11-game losers, the Rams asked. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys obliged, mismanaging the clock and the field on their last-minute 
threat after being set-up by James Dixon's 38-yard kickoff return to the Dallas 
45. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman, who already had equalled his season touchdown-pass total with four 
against the Rams, moved his team deftly. Then the 'Pokes' spokes came loose. 
</P>
<P>
At the Ram 32 with 48 seconds left, Dixon called the Cowboys' second timeout. 
He wasn't supposed to. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after a five-yard pass, Aikman fooled referee Johnny Grier when his 
hand-audible at the line of scrimmage was misconstrued as a real time-out 
signal. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Cowboys had second-and-10 at the 17 with 12 seconds left, Robinson 
defending his team's prevent zone to its death. 
</P>
<P>
Time for two passes into the end zone. Aikman called "99 double-up," a play 
designed for receiver Cornell Burbage to split the seam of the defense into the 
end zone. What Burbage heard was "99," a curl pattern underneath. It added up 
to "86" for the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman, shocked to find no receivers in the end zone, threw to Burbage, who was 
tackled at the 13 as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
"We were supposed to put the football in the end zone on that last play," 
Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman was ready to put out an all-points bulletin for Burbage. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked for him and he was gone," Aikman said. "We had two shots at the end 
zone and I was looking for that shot, but he was hookin' up and he was gone, 
and there was nothing we could do." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe next time. The Rams couldn't believe their fortune, and could further 
thank an ill-timed fourth-quarter fumble by Dallas fullback Daryl Johnston and 
the amazing comeback touch of Everett, who's beginning to tread on Joe 
Montana's toes. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston's fumble, recovered by Larry Kelm at the Dallas 44, gave Everett the 
chance. Down by 10 with 4:20 left? No sweat. 
</P>
<P>
Everett ducked his head into huddle and told his teammates to hang loose; the 
game was over. 
</P>
<P>
First he threw five yards to tight end Pete Holohan. Next, he audibled to 
receiver Ron Brown on a deep pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Everett told Brown earlier to keep the play in mind. Now seemed a good time. 
Brown was so open he didn't need his world-class speed to reel-in Everett's 
39-yard scoring pass with 3:58. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say enough about him," Brown said of his quarterback. "He's a leader, 
and he takes full control of the offense. It comes from him." 
</P>
<P>
Brown was eager to make amends for his fumbled kick-off return at the Rams' 
two-yard line earlier in the quarter, setting up the Cowboys' final touchdown; 
the game-clincher, it appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's catch was his lone reception in the game and just his third of the 
season. He was only on the field because Henry Ellard is still out with a 
hamstring strain. 
</P>
<P>
Brown credited offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese, for remembering that he 
still existed. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't accept not practicing or not doing it right," Brown said. "It's 
nothing but the best. But he's cool about it. He won't say anything to you. You 
just won't play." 
</P>
<P>
One more loose end tie up, though. The Rams were still down three after Brown's 
score. They needed the ball back, and received it after a Dallas punt left them 
at their 22 with 3:13 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
For Everett, the drive was simple as 1:23, the time it took him to drive his 
team 78 yards for the winning score. From the Dallas 23, Everett stood over 
center and grabbed his face-mask, a "sight-read" to receiver Cox that the 
safety was up and to change the pattern to a slant over the middle. 
</P>
<P>
With Everett, you've got to believe, Cox says. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim came in the huddle and said there was a lot of time, don't panic," Cox 
said. "Do this and do that. It's just a great feeling. It all goes back to Jim 
Everett. He's always telling us to keep fighting." 
</P>
<P>
Cox's touchdown, a 23-yarder, might have saved the Rams' season. At 9-4, 
there's now still plenty of punch left in next Monday's showdown with the 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
That's five times now that Everett has led his team back from fourth-quarter 
deficits to give his team the lead in the closing minutes. With any help from 
his defense, he would be 5-0 instead of 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an attitude," Everett said of the comebacks. "All last summer, I thought 
about it and thought about it. My first game here, against New England (1986), 
they win on a 'Hail Mary.' I started believing and convinced myself that the 
game's 60 minutes and it ain't over till you hear that gun." 
</P>
<P>
You do what you can, even on the sloppiest days. The Rams turned four Dallas 
turnovers into 28 points; the Cowboys turned three Ram blunders into 17. 
</P>
<P>
Everett, who completed 27 of 37 passes for 341 yards, continues to work solo, 
the Rams' running game having deserted the team weeks ago. Sunday, they managed 
78 total yards on the ground against one of the league's worst defenses. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Greg Bell finished with 22 yards in 15 carries, although Robinson 
wishes to spread the blame equally. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's been Greg," Robinson said. "I just think we're not 
blocking." 
</P>
<P>
Everett's arm and the bicarbonate of soda have been good enough in recent 
weeks, but tackle Irv Pankey said this last-second madness has to got to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not losing any more games, OK?" he said. "You got that? Not like that. 
No way. You know what I'm saying? We're not losing no more like that." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Mike Piel suffered a dislocated left elbow in the first half and 
will be sidelined for at least three weeks. Piel had four sacks since entering 
the starting lineup Oct. 29. "I was so mad I could hardly see straight," Piel 
said of the injury. . . . Kevin Greene and Michael Stewart suffered mild 
concussions Sunday. Greene had one sack, bringing his season total to 14.5. . . 
. Bill Hawkins couldn't believe the roughing-the-passer call against him at the 
end of the first half that moved the Cowboys into range for a 47-yard field 
goal after time had expired. "Thank God it wasn't the difference in the game," 
Hawkins said.

EAGLES AND WIND BLOW AWAY GIANTS, 24-17; 
</P>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA: IT HAS WEATHER ON ITS SIDE WHEN IT COUNTS, WHILE TURNOVERS WORK 
AGAINST NEW YORK.

<TEXT>
<P>
Three years ago, the New York Giants won a coin toss and let a 40-m.p.h. wind 
blow them right into the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia Eagles are now hoping that history repeats itself. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles forced five turnovers Sunday -- four that led to all 24 of their 
points and a fifth that stopped the Giants at the five -- to beat the Giants, 
24-17, and take charge of the NFC East race. 
</P>
<P>
But as it was for the Giants when they beat Washington in the 1986 NFC title 
game, it may have been the coin toss that gave the Eagles the win. It helped 
them jump to a quick 14-0 lead with the wind and also carried a Randall 
Cunningham punt 91 yards after the Giants had tied the score, 17-17. 
</P>
<P>
That led to the final turnover -- a fumble at the Giants' six -- and Keith 
Byars' two-yard touchdown run with 10:50 left for the winning points. 
</P>
<P>
"The wind was the most important factor in the game," Eagle Coach Buddy Ryan 
said. "We made a decision to take the wind to start the game, then we made a 
decision to give it to them in the third quarter so we could have it in the 
fourth." 
</P>
<P>
Giant punter Sean Landeta said: "It was probably the worst wind since that NFC 
championship game. If we would have won the toss, we were going to kick." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, it blew the Eagles into a tie with the Giants in the NFC East at 9-4, 
but gave them the edge in any tiebreaker because they also won the earlier 
meeting, 21-19, in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, they've now beaten the Giants four straight times, in large part 
because they force turnovers -- they entered the game leading the league with 
21 more recoveries than losses. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll win the division unless they screw up," Giant Coach Bill Parcells 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's any difference between us and the Giants, that's it," said safety 
Wes Hopkins, who had one of five sacks on Phil Simms, who fumbled twice and was 
intercepted twice. 
</P>
<P>
It started early -- with the wind of course. 
</P>
<P>
On the third play from scrimmage, Simms was hit on his own 16 by Reggie White 
and fumbled. William Frizzell picked up the ball and took it to the three, 
where he lateraled to Andre Waters, who took it in for the score. 
</P>
<P>
Eight minutes later, Simms threw under pressure, had the ball tipped by Jerome 
Brown into the hands of Clyde Simmons, who ran 60 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Simmons' only other pro touchdown came here last year, when he 
picked up a field goal blocked by Lawrence Tayor of the Giants and took it in 
for the game-winning score in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Simms came back to hit Mark Ingram on a 41-yard touchdown pass play -- into the 
wind -- to cut it to 14-7, but Roger Ruzek hit a 35-yarder into the wind in the 
second quarter to make it 17-7.

NEW YORK: OVERTIME IS AVOIDED WHEN CHARGER PLACEKICKER CHRIS BAHR MISSES FROM 
37 YARDS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Chargers started a rookie quarterback named Billy Joe Tolliver 
Sunday. They lost to the New York Jets, 20-17, because he was Billy Joe 
Terrible. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see any good points in my performance today," Tolliver said after 
completing 24 of 51 passes for 230 yards, throwing two interceptions and 
getting sacked five times. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't all his fault. Kicker Chris Bahr pushed a 37-yard field goal attempt 
wide right with 10 seconds remaining that would have sent the game into 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
And Tolliver's offensive teammates, an odd assortment of injury-plagued free 
agents and Plan B types, were Just Barely Tolerable. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have a great deal of help around Billy Joe," Charger Coach Dan 
Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
All of which was Pretty Much Horrible for a Charger defense that has now held 
11 consecutive opponents to fewer than 21 points. The Chargers have won only 
four of those games. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the Chargers' third in a row and dropped them to 4-9. The Jets, 
also 4-9, have won two in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Tolliver's trouble stemmed from inexperience. This was only his second 
NFL start. But he also had problems throwing passes that required touch. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets, ranked last in NFL defense after 12 weeks, were smart enough to try 
to confuse Tolliver. And they succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
"They were in some defenses in the first half and early in the second where I 
wasn't sure what was going on," Tolliver said. 
</P>
<P>
New York cornerback Bobby Humphrey said: "You could tell he hadn't been in game 
situations. You could play with his mind a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
So, yes, the Chargers' quarterback, at times, was Billy Joe Gullible. Several 
Jet defenders said they kept waiting for Henning to insert veteran Jim McMahon. 
Henning said he never came close to making such a move. Henning also said 
Tolliver will "probably" remain his starter next week in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Both Tolliver interceptions cost the Chargers dearly. The first occurred late 
in the first period after Ken O'Brien's forward pitch to running back Johnny 
Hector resulted in a nine-yard touchdown and a 7-0 Jets' lead. 
</P>
<P>
Hector's score completed a 47-yard, seven-play drive set up by JoJo Townsell's 
30-yard punt return. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Jamie Holland responded with a 34-yard return on the ensuing kickoff. 
Pass interference on Humphrey moved the Chargers to the New York 20. But two 
plays later, Tolliver threw into double coverage, and cornerback James Hasty 
intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, the Chargers tied the score with five minutes remaining in the half 
on a 40-yard run up the middle by rookie running back Marion Butts. Butts broke 
at least five tackles on the play. "As good a run as I've seen this year," 
Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
"I could smell the end zone," said Butts, who scored seven touchdowns in the 
first six weeks but none in the next five. "It had been a long time." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers took the lead late in the third period on a 39-yarder by Bahr, set 
up by Lester Lyles interception of a Pat Ryan pass. Ryan replaced O'Brien, who 
jammed his shoulder in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Lyles' interception was one of three by the Charger defense, which also 
recovered a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets regained the lead on a one-yard touchdown run by Roger Vick. And they 
stretched that margin to 20-10 on a 14-yard rumble by Vick. Pat Leahy missed 
the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
Vick's second touchdown came after Erik McMillan intercepted an ill-advised 
Tolliver bomb and returned it 40 yards to the Charger 16. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the stupidest plays of the year," Tolliver said. "That's a play any 
high school kid knows not to do." 
</P>
<P>
But thanks to Leahy's miss, the Chargers weren't dead. After Leslie O'Neal 
recovered a Vick fumble at the Jet 49, Tolliver hurried them upfield. His 
eight-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Miller cut the New York lead to 20-17 with 
3:25 to play. 
</P>
<P>
And after a Jet punt, the Chargers took over on their 44. Six plays later, 
Bahr, who was six of eight from between the 30 and 39 before his miss, pushed 
what would have been the game-tying field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"The snap was fine, the hold was fine, Chris told me he just got a little 
behind it," said holder David Archer. "It's like a golf shot that you hit a 
little fat and leave it out to the right."

NEW YORK: OVERTIME AVOIDED WHEN CHARGER PLACEKICKER MISFIRES FROM 37 YARDS.

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a season full of disappointment, the New York Jets finally caught a break. 
</P>
<P>
They played the San Diego Chargers Sunday and came away with a 20-17 victory 
when Charger place-kicker Chris Bahr missed a 37-yard field goal that would 
have sent the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured it was a 'gimme.' We got a good break for a change," Jet quarterback 
Pat Ryan said of Bahr's field-goal try, which came with 10 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Bahr, who earlier converted a 39-yard field goal, said he just misfired on the 
second attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was fine but I just didn't hit it good," Bahr said. "I hit behind 
the ball and didn't get it solidly." 
</P>
<P>
Jet Coach Joe Walton suggested penetration by the Jets on the field-goal try 
contributed to Bahr's miss. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been getting good pressure from our field-goal defense all year," Walton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets won their second in a row to improve to 4-9. San Diego also is 4-9. 
</P>
<P>
Jet running back Roger Vick helped to make up for the injury-related loss of 
quarterback Ken O'Brien by running for two fourth-quarter touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Vick's first touchdown, a one-yard run, came with 9:19 left to play and put the 
Jets on top, 14-10. 
</P>
<P>
It followed a seven-play, 47-yard drive led by Ryan, who played the final two 
quarters in place of O'Brien after the Jets starter suffered a jammed shoulder 
when sacked late in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
On the ensuing Chargers' possession, safety Erik McMillan intercepted Billy Joe 
Tolliver's pass and returned it 40 yards to the Chargers 16-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, Vick scored on a 14-yard run to give the Jets a 10-point 
advantage. Pat Leahy's extra point try was wide left. It was his first miss 
after 106 PAT successes dating to Week 14 of the 1985 season. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego pulled to within three points when Tolliver threw an 8-yard touchdown 
pass to Anthony Miller with 3:25 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego forced a Jet punt and got the ball back at its own 44 with two 
minutes remaining. Five pass completions and a run by Darrin Nelson advanced 
the Chargers to the Jets' 19 and Bahr came on for the ill-fated field goal 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Said Tolliver: "Chris is an excellent kicker. But sometimes you do it and 
sometimes you don't. It just seemed today that we were snakebit and we were 
born to lose." 
</P>
<P>
The Jets defense, ranked last in the league entering the game, also was tough 
on Tolliver, a rookie who started ahead of Jim McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver, making only his second appearance of the season after a dismal NFL 
debut five weeks ago, was sacked five times and threw two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"I was mediocre at best," Tolliver said. "In the final analysis, the 
interception (to McMillan) I threw cost us the game and I've got to live with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
He completed 24 of 51 throws for 230 yards. Against Seattle on Oct. 29, 
Tolliver completed only six of 17 throws for 41 yards with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
"(Tolliver) played awful in the first half and he knows it," Charger Coach Dan 
Henning said. "I was getting on him pretty good on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"He was starting to make some progress and at the end he was throwing the ball 
sharply, making good decisions and using the clock well. I just wish we could 
have got it into overtime to get him some more work." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers' defense also registered five sacks and intercepted Jets 
quarterbacks three times, but Jets' running back Johnny Hector gained 106 yards 
on 20 carries while Vick added 76 yards on 16 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Hector's performance marked the first time a Jets back has surpassed 100 yards 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Bahr's 39-yard field goal with 2:07 left in the third period had given San 
Diego a 10-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The kick followed a 10-play, 50-yard drive that began after Chargers defensive 
back Lester Lyles intercepted a pass by Ryan at the San Diego 28. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver converted two third-and-10 plays on the drive, a 13-yard completion to 
Jamie Holland and a 30-yard pass to Miller that advanced the ball to the Jets' 
28. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego failed to make a first down and Bahr then came on for the field goal. 
</P>
<P>
A 40-yard run by rookie Marion Butts with 5:01 remaining in the second quarter 
pulled the Chargers into a halftime tie at 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
The seventh-round draft choice out of Florida State smashed up the middle and 
started breaking tackles, six in all, en route to the score. In the final 
yards, he shook one defender off his back, eluded a second and stepped out of 
the grasp of a third before going into the end zone standing up. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very exciting," said Butts, crediting blocks by tackle Joel Patten and 
tight end Arthur Cox for helping to spring him. 
</P>
<P>
"If you feel it inside, you can almost be invincible," Butts added. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets opened the scoring late in the first period when Hector took a flat 
pass from O'Brien near the line of scrimmage and ran nine yards for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
JoJo Townsell's 30-yard punt return allowed the Jets to begin the drive at the 
Chargers' 47 and O'Brien completed four of his next five passes ending in the 
toss to Hector. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Jets and Chargers had problems moving the ball as each club's defense 
registered four first-half sacks. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien completed nine of 21 throws for 81 yards before being injured. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan finished with three completions in 11 attempts for 36 yards with two 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver was erratic throughout, completing only 10 of 22 passes for 104 yards 
with an interception in the first half.

As Wade Wilson and the Minnesota Vikings ended their offensive suffering, they 
may have also ended the Chicago Bears' five-year reign as rulers of the NFC 
Central. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to dethrone them, as long as we're the ones who replace them on the 
throne," Wilson said. "It wouldn't do us any good to beat the Bears and then 
watch the Packers win the division." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson threw two scoring passes and keyed the Vikings' first long touchdown 
drive in three weeks in leading Minnesota to a 27-16 victory over the Bears 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We went back to our old philosophy of throwing the ball deep," said Wilson, 
who completed 15 of 26 passes for 260 yards. "We came out attacking them with 
our passing game, something we hadn't done in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped Chicago (6-7) two games behind Minnesota and Green Bay. Both 
are 8-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears are below .500 for the first time since the second-to-last week of 
1983, the last season in which they missed the playoffs. The Bears, who have 
lost three straight and are 2-7 after a 4-0 start, last had a losing season in 
1982, when they went 3-6 in Coach Mike Ditka's first year. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last week, when Ditka said the Bears season was over because 
they "stink," the coach has ridden his team hard. 
</P>
<P>
He softened considerably after Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to correct one thing," he said. "I got on these guys a little last 
week. But, I'll tell you, the way they played, good or bad, that's my 
responsibility. They're my guys and I love them and I respect them, and we'll 
keep trying. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted it to happen more than anyone else in this room," he said. "I don't 
think this team will give up. They tried, they hung in there, they made some 
good things happen early." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's lone highlight came 3:28 into the game, when Kevin Butler broke an 
NFL record with his 24th consecutive field goal, a 33-yarder. His next attempt 
was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings, who snapped a two-game losing streak, led 14-3 at halftime. They 
drove 66 yards in seven plays for one score, a one-yard run by Herschel Walker, 
and got their second touchdown on a 46-yard hookup, Wilson to Hassan Jones. It 
was the Vikings' longest pass play of the season and capped a six-play, 73-yard 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings are shooting for their first division title since 1980.

BROWNS SHOOT BLANKS IN BATTLE OF OHIO; 
</P>
<P>
CINCINNATI: IT HANDS CLEVELAND ITS FIRST SHUTOUT AT HOME SINCE 1977.

<P>
The Cincinnati Bengals didn't realize how badly things were going for the 
Cleveland Browns until they saw it in person Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"If you would have told me that we would shut out the Browns, I would have said 
it was impossible," Cincinnati receiver Tim McGee said after catching four 
passes, including one on a 38-yard touchdown pass play, as the Bengals blanked 
Cleveland, 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, McGee hadn't been paying attention to the Browns' offensive problems 
in recent weeks. Their three-game total of 20 points is the lowest for any 
three-game span in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's shutout was Cleveland's first at home since 1977, and it came against 
a Bengal team that hadn't blanked anyone since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense lately has not been playing up to its potential," Cincinnati 
linebacker Reggie Williams said. "This week, we managed to turn it around. We 
got some hits on Bernie Kosar early in the game. When you do that, it can be a 
long day for the quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
Kosar was benched after three quarters, more because of his ineffectiveness 
than his sore right elbow. Kosar, who completed 15 of 30 passes for 130 yards, 
hasn't thrown a touchdown pass in 14 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"It starts with the quarterback, and I want to take responsibility for the 
football team," said Kosar, who bruised his elbow three weeks ago in Seattle. 
"I was disappointed. But I don't play the coach, and that's their decision to 
make. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a couple hits out there and the arm was a little sore, but I don't 
think it was anything of any significance." 
</P>
<P>
Kosar, who was warming his elbow on the sidelines between possessions because 
of the 18-degree temperature and minus-10 wind chill factor, was booed heartily 
by the sellout crowd of 76,236 throughout the third quarter. The stands were 
nearly empty by late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati quarterback Boomer Esiason completed 14 of 32 passes for 197 yards 
with two touchdowns and two interceptions as the Bengals (7-6) put themselves 
back in the AFC Central Division race, one game behind Houston (8-5) and a half 
game behind the Browns (7-5-1). 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the Bengals their first two-game sweep in the annual "battle 
for Ohio" since 1984. Cincinnati beat Cleveland, 21-14, Sept. 25 at Cincinnati.

The Washington Redskins are making a late-season run at the playoffs, while the 
lack of a rushing attack has killed the Phoenix Cardinals' chances. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Riggs and Earnest Byner each had one-yard scoring runs, and rookie 
cornerback A.J. Johnson returned a third-quarter interception 59 yards for his 
first NFL touchdown as Washington beat Phoenix, 29-10, Sunday to keep its 
wild-card playoff hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not out of it by any means," Coach Joe Gibbs said after his Redskins 
improved their record to 7-6, two games behind the NFC East-leading New York 
Giants and Philadelphia Eagles. "There are still three games left. Anything can 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix (5-8) lost its third straight game and second under interim head coach 
Hank Kuhlmann. The Cardinals will have to win their last three games to avoid a 
fifth-straight losing season. 
</P>
<P>
Washington held Phoenix to a season-low 29 yards rushing on 16 carries, their 
fifth game in a row under 100 yards and ninth game this year. The Cardinals 
were held to 263 yards in offense. 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins took a 10-0 lead on Chip Lohmiller's 29-yard field goal with 5:34 
remaining in the first quarter and Byner's one-yard run at 3:31 into the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix tied the game, 10-10, on Al Del Greco's 27-yard field goal with 7:03 
remaining in the second quarter and Earl Ferrell's one-yard touchdown run with 
1:24 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
But Washington took the second-half kickoff and drove 61 yards in 11 plays, 
with Riggs' touchdown putting the Redskins ahead to stay at 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
Redskin quarterback Mark Rypien, who missed the first half's final minute after 
spraining his left knee on a sack, completed 16 of 22 passes for 153 yards. 
Doug Williams replaced Rypien and completed two of five passes for 22 yards and 
threw one interception. 
</P>
<P>
Byner rushed for 86 yards in 20 carries while Riggs had 39 in 12. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix quarterback Gary Hogeboom completed eight passes in 11 attempts for 131 
yards before dislocating the index finger on his throwing hand eight minutes 
before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Tupa took over and was 10 of 18 for 124 yards and two interceptions -- the 
other by Wayne Davis in the Redskin end zone with 1:04 remaining in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Chip Lohmiller kicked a 24-yard field goal with 1:38 left in the game, and Tupa 
was called for intentionally grounding the ball out of the end zone for a 
safety with 53 seconds remaining.

RAMS: BROWN MAKES UP FOR FUMBLE BY CATCHING KEY TOUCHDOWN PASS. COX COMES OFF 
BENCH TO SCORE WINNING TOUCHDOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For three months, Ron Brown and Aaron Cox were little more than names on the 
Rams' depth chart. They ran under Jim Everett's passes in practice, but spent 
their Sundays like most other Ram fans -- watching Henry Ellard and Flipper 
Anderson weaving through opposing secondaries. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, at least, had a handful of catches and one chance to spike the ball -- he 
scored a touchdown against the Giants Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 10 weeks, however, Brown's detractors waited for him to make a 
catch so they could say: "This guy is now making $270,000 per reception." 
</P>
<P>
Then, on Nov. 19 against Phoenix, he made two catches, reducing his 
per-reception salary to a mere $135,000. But Brown, No. 4 on Everett's list of 
favorite wide receivers, wasn't laughing all the way to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can do is keep playing and try to make the most of the few opportunities 
I get," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ellard suffered a strained hamstring before last week's game against New 
Orleans and the focus went to Anderson, who set an NFL record with 336 
receiving yards against the Saints. Cox was back in the starting lineup and 
caught four passes in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, however, was still odd man out. 
</P>
<P>
So, when Luis Zendejas kicked off Sunday after a Dallas touchdown that gave the 
Cowboys a 24-21 lead over the Rams early in the fourth quarter, Brown tried to 
make the most of a rare chance. 
</P>
<P>
The ball bounced in front of him and Brown, who was about two yards deep in the 
end zone, blocked it. It rolled away. He hesitated, then picked it up and took 
off, angling for the left sideline. Then the ball seemed to pop up out of his 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas' Manny Hendrix picked the ball out the air, flopped down on the two-yard 
line, and three plays later, the Cowboys led, 31-21. 
</P>
<P>
"What was I thinking?" Brown said. "I was thinking that this probably would be 
my last game as a Ram. I was so low, I could've sat on a matchbook and dangled 
my feet." 
</P>
<P>
But then Everett took over. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a real leader," Brown said. "He kept telling us we were still going to 
win. And when he says it, you've got to believe him." 
</P>
<P>
Everett and Brown made a lot of believers only 7 1/2 minutes after Brown's 
fumble. They hooked up on a 49-yard touchdown pass play that brought the Rams 
to 31-28 with 3:58 remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never experienced such a high and such a low so close together," Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And, two minutes after that, the Cowboys were down for the count -- for the 
12th time this season -- as Everett completed a 23-yard scoring pass to Cox for 
a 35-31 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, who also scored on an 18-yard pass from Everett in the third quarter, 
finished with five catches for 103 yards. Brown had only the one catch, but 
Everett said it was a "huge" one. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to give both those guys a lot of credit," Everett said. "Losing 
Henry, probably the best receiver in the NFL, is a big blow, but these guys 
were prepared to step in. And, after that fumble, Ron could've been hanging his 
head, but he didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Cox, who lost his starting job to Anderson in training camp while he was 
holding out during contract negotiations, said he has felt vindicated the last 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"This feels really good," he said. "It's letting me know as well as the coaches 
that I can still play the game. With Ellard hurting, Jim's been going to 
different receivers and today was my turn to catch a few." 
</P>
<P>
And Brown had a brief chance to relive memories of 1987, when the former 
Olympic sprinter had 26 catches for 521 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron's had a frustrating year and that fumbled kickoff was the kind of error 
that comes when you want so bad to contribute," Ram Coach John Robinson said. 
"But he overcame it and had a good game." 
</P>
<P>
Had Brown fielded that kickoff cleanly, he could have downed it. But once it 
started rolling over the goal line, he felt like he had to make a run for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't really sure whether I could down it, because I stopped it and then it 
rolled out of the end zone," he said "Then I never really had a handle on it. 
</P>
<P>
"These things happen in this business, but it doesn't look too good on your 
resume." 
</P>
<P>
If you're a Ram these days, you have to believe that all's well that ends well. 
So Brown was joking and Cox was laughing Sunday afternoon. And Ellard, who is 
expected to return for Monday night's game against San Francisco, seemed to be 
enjoying himself as much as the reserves. 
</P>
<P>
"We're showing that we've got the guys, no matter who's out there," Ellard 
said. "They came through with the big plays when we needed them. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter who's out there, we've got the guys to make things happen." 
</P>

PFEIFER'S FALL GIVES LINDQVIST SLALOM TITLE

<P>
Ingemar Stenmark decided against joining the U.S. Pro Tour this winter, but 
Swedish skiers on the circuit are doing well without him. 
</P>
<P>
Niklas Lindqvist, born in Stockholm 25 years ago, won the slalom of the 
America's Opening Cup Sunday and left Alpine Meadows with $7,100. He trailed 
Roland Pfeifer by 0.108 of a second after the first run of the final, but 
Pfeifer, from Austria, fell near the finish of their second run, giving 
Lindqvist the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Mahre of Yakima, Wash., made it to the quarterfinals after going out in 
the round of 16 during Saturday's giant slalom, but the three-time World Cup 
champion crash-landed off the first of two jumps and fell an automatic 1.5 
seconds behind Austrian Werner Herzog after their first run. 
</P>
<P>
His 0.236-second margin over Herzog in the second run left him well short in 
the combined reckoning. 
</P>
<P>
"The heel binding ripped right out of my left ski when I landed," Mahre said. 
"It was weird, something that's never happened to me before." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kelly, a former assistant coach on the U.S. Ski Team now with the firm that 
supplies Mahre with bindings, was dumbfounded afterward. "I didn't mount Phil's 
bindings myself," he said, "and I can't really explain how it happened." 
</P>
<P>
But Kelly did a double-take when he opened a fortune cookie after eating the 
Oriental meal served in the hospitality tent. Said the fortune: 
</P>
<P>
"You will soon be in another line of work." 
</P>
<P>
In the second round, Mahre had won a battle of 1984 Olympic gold medalists when 
he defeated Max Julen. Mahre, who took the slalom at Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, 
edged Julen, the 1984 giant slalom champion, by 0.149 of a second in the first 
run, then breezed into the quarterfinals as Julen fell near the end of their 
second duel. 
</P>
<P>
Lindqvist appeared to be on a collision course to meet fellow Swede Jorgen 
Sundqvist in the semifinals. Last season, the first for both on the tour, 
Sundqvist was the overall champion, and Lindqvist was third, just behind Mahre. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sundqvist fell on his second run in the quarterfinals against Joerg 
Seiler of Switzerland, who went on to give Lindqvist a scare before losing 
their semifinal by a slim combined time differential of 0.009 of a second. 
</P>
<P>
Lindqvist had been eliminated in the second round Saturday as Bernhard Knauss 
of Austria won the giant slalom, but he said Sunday: "I wasn't worried. Today 
was a new day." 
</P>
<P>
And besides, Knauss had to scratch from the slalom because of a partial 
ligament tear in his right knee and a partial separation of his left shoulder 
suffered in a finish-line spill the day before.

Esa Tikkanen and Jari Kurri each scored two goals Sunday night as the Edmonton 
Oilers extended their winning streak to five games and took the Smythe Division 
lead with a 5-3 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs at Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton goaltender Bill Ranford stopped 37 of 40 shots by Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Anderson also scored for the Oilers, who moved one point ahead of the 
idle Calgary Flames. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 4, St. Louis 3 -- Defenseman Grant Ledyard scored his second goal of 
the season midway through the third period and the Sabres downed the Blues, 
4-3, at Buffalo to remain the only NHL team with an unbeaten home record. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres are 12-0-1 in Memorial Auditorium and have won 11 straight games at

</P>
<P>
Boston 2, Philadelphia 1 -- Bob Gould scored with 7:17 left at Philadelphia to 
lift the Bruins to a victory over the Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Poulin scored for the Flyers early in the second period and Boston's Randy 
Burridge tied it five minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 4, Chicago 3 -- Steve Yzerman scored two power-play goals and assisted 
on Gerard Gallant's tie-breaker, becoming the fifth player in Red Wing history 
to reach 600 points, in a victory over the Blackhawks at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks have lost five straight games and have a winless streak of 
0-6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 6, Minnesota 5 -- Trevor Linden scored a power-play goal at 13:14 of 
the third period and the Canucks got past the North Stars at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
Linden scored two goals for Vancouver, which won for the first time in seven 
games. Mike Gartner had three goals for Minnesota, which lost its fifth 
consecutive road game.

ST. JOHN'S REMAINS PERFECT IN ITS OWN TOURNAMENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
St. John's kept up its winning tradition in its own Joe Lapchick Memorial 
tournament and the 20th-ranked Redmen also kept up their string of injuries 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Werdann scored 20 points and had 16 rebounds as St. John's frontline 
starters outscored Wright State's, 52-26, and outrebounded the Raiders, 48-25, 
in Sunday's 76-56 victory in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
St. John's (5-1) has won all 15 editions of the tournament, which honors the 
memory of a former St. John's coach, and is 30-0 in the event. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest concern after the game was the sprained right ankle of starting 
point guard Boo Harvey. He sustained the injury just before coming out of the 
game with the Redmen enjoying a big lead. 
</P>
<P>
St. John's is playing without last season's leading scorer and rebounder, 
Jayson Williams, who has a fractured right foot and will not be back until 
around Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Wright State (2-1), an independent school in just its third season in Division 
I, stayed with the Redmen for the first 10 minutes and held its last lead at 
19-18 with 9:39 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Jason Buchanan started a 25-8 run for the Redmen with two 
three-point shots. Werdann scored six more points in the run and Buchanan had 
four more as the Redmen led, 43-29, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
South Alabama 77, U. San Diego 72 -- Kevin McDaniels made an 18-foot jump shot 
with 24 seconds left and then added four free throws with three seconds left to 
give the Jaguars the win in the third-place game of the Lapchick tournament. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's final points came on a jump shot by Anthony Thomas with 2:05 to 
play and it gave the Toreros (2-3) a 72-66 lead. 
</P>
<P>
South Alabama (2-2) then made three free throws before Marvin Eackles made jump 
shot to pull the Jaguars within one with 1:27 left. San Diego's Wayman 
Strickland missed a jump shot with 44 seconds left before McDaniels gave the 
Jaguars the lead. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina 87, Towson State 70 -- Scott Williams scored 20 points and the 
Tar Heels shot 61% in the first half as the 12th-ranked Tar Heels won easily at 
Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Towson State (2-1) trailed, 78-58, with six minutes left, but went on an 11-2 
run, pulling to 80-66. Guard Kurk Lee scored 11 of his game-high 26 points 
during the run. 
</P>
<P>
But Williams made two free throws and a jump shot with four minutes left and 
the Tar Heels (4-2) coasted the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt 68, Virginia 64 -- Derrick Wilcox made two free throws with two 
seconds left to give the Commodores the win at Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The winning free throws came after Kenny Turner had pulled the Cavaliers even 
at 64-64 with a three-point shot with 1:01 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt's Morgan Wheat stole the Virginia in-bounds pass after Wilcox' free 
throws and was fouled. He made two free throws with no time left.

ZIKARSKY REACHES OUT FOR A WIN 
</P>

<P>
The tallest swimmer in history, 6-foot-10 Bjorn Zikarsky of USC, won the 
100-yard freestyle race Sunday night as the Trojans won the Grand Prix National 
Invitational meet at Belmont Plaza Olympic Pool in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first test against major competition in the United States for 
Zikarsky, who came to USC this year from West Germany. He won the 100-yard 
final in an NCAA qualifying time of 43.98 seconds, just off the pool record and 
personal best of 43.90 he swam in trials earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Zikarsky also anchored the USC relay team, which edged California in the 
400-yard freestyle relay. 
</P>
<P>
"Most swimmers think I have an advantage, and that might be true," Zikarsky 
said. "I should be a foot ahead after I take off, and it's easier for longer 
people to glide. But no one ever says to me, 'You only win because you're that 
tall.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dan Jorgensen of USC, who won the mile freestyle Sunday in 15:01.57, was the 
meet's top man with 123 points, followed by teammates Ray Looze with 115 and 
Dave Wharton with 100. 
</P>
<P>
USC was followed by California, Stanford, Arizona State and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Summers of California was the women's overall winner with 158 points. 
Teammate Katie Welch and Stanford's Karen Kraemer tied for second at 141. Cal 
won the women's team title, ahead of Stanford, Tennessee, UCLA and USC. 
</P>
<P>
Pool records were set by USC's Tara Shriner in the 200-yard breaststroke 
(2:17.42), Terri O'Loughlin of USC in the 200-yard butterfly (2:00.18) and 
Stanford's Barb Metz in the mile freestyle (16:23.93).

TEXAS TEACH (3-1) at SAN DIEGO STATE (2-2), 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State continues a four-game home stretch at the San Diego Sports 
Arena against a familiar team -- this is the third consecutive year the schools 
have met. Each has won at home, SDSU two years ago (72-63) and Texas Tech last 
year (58-43). The teams have a similar makeup in that the Red Raiders have nine 
new players and the Aztecs eight. Texas Tech is coming off a 78-77 loss to host 
Austin Peay in the championship of the Acme Boot tournament Saturday after 
defeating Portland in the opening round, 94-58, for its only victory over an 
NCAA Division I team. SDSU's only victories are against Division II Chaminade 
and UC Riverside. The Aztecs are shooting 45.2% from the field.

SMOLDERING HATREDS IN 'HOWARD BEACH' MOVIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the murder rate in the United States were as large as the percentage of 
television time given murder, there'd be no one alive to watch television. 
</P>
<P>
At least NBC's "Howard Beach: Making the Case for Murder" -- 9 tonight on 
Channels 4, 36 and 39 -- brings something to the table beyond gratuitous 
bloodshed. Speaking with a sort of ugly eloquence, it's a crisp, sober account 
of a headline-making crime case that inflamed racial tensions. 
</P>
<P>
The violence here -- and it is brutal and vicious -- is merely a symptom, the 
hacking smoker's cough telling you that something deep inside is rotting. It's 
also the framework and explosive context for this movie, a visible 
manifestation of the pockets of smoldering hatreds that underlie and burn away 
at America. 
</P>
<P>
The case begins on the night of Dec. 20, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
A car with three black men breaks down in the essentially white community of 
Howard Beach in Queens, N.Y. As in the darkest days of the old South, the 
blacks are confronted, taunted, harassed and chased by a group of white teens. 
Timothy Grimes (Anthony Russell Jr.) escapes. Cedric Sandiford (Joe Morton) is 
severely beaten. Sandiford's stepson, Michael Griffith (Cleodis Ingram), flees 
from his attackers onto the busy Belt Parkway, where he is hit by a car and 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
With this night of terror as a catalyst, Steve Bellow's script proceeds to 
relate the Howard Beach case and its racially tense environment from the 
perspective of Joe Hynes (Daniel J. Travanti), the able New York State special 
prosecutor who triumphs here despite nagging political pressures and being 
haunted by the memory of a previous case that he lost. 
</P>
<P>
The cast is strong. Travanti is especially solid, as is Morton as the 
determined Sandiford, who rebounds from his terrible beating to star in the 
courtroom. And William Daniels is his snide best as shrewdly manipulative 
defense attorney David Slaney. 
</P>
<P>
A slave to its stopwatch, television has a way of abridging experiences and 
skipping over the middle chapters right to the thundering conclusion. Hence, 
rarely do TV portrayals of crime cases portray the tortuous process -- the 
seemingly menial grunt work and the frustrations, false starts and dead ends -- 
of preparing for the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"Howard Beach" is the happy exception. Directed with pace and precision by Dick 
Lowry, these taut scenes of Hynes and his legal team methodically constructing 
a case for the grand jury, and later for trial, are just fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
Where "Howard Beach" falls down in some respects is in the courtroom. The trial 
depiction is suspenseful and punctuated by sharp dramatic twists, but also so 
truncated that chunks of critical testimony appear to have been abandoned to 
the cutting room floor. 
</P>
<P>
Of course trials must be abbreviated for TV, but this goes too far. For 
example, the prosecution team is shocked to learn during the course of the 
trial that one of the surviving victims, Grimes, had 10 times as much cocaine 
in his system as was previously reported. "Slaney will have a field day with 
that," predicts one Hynes associates. "Tell me about it," Hynes agrees glumly. 
</P>
<P>
But the revelation never surfaces in court. Nor does one of the white 
assailants who makes a deal to testify against his comrades. 
</P>
<P>
"Howard Beach" is still an intriguing two hours, however, and just as 
important, a jolting look at the worst of ourselves.

SHAW LEADS SYMPHONY, CHORUS TO A HIGH NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Any equation that includes Robert Shaw, chorus, and orchestra as components is 
likely to balance with musical felicity. The maestro, recently named the San 
Diego Symphony's resident guest conductor, brought his special touch to 
Symphony Hall Friday night, leading the symphony and the San Diego Master 
Chorale in "Gloria" settings by Vivaldi, Beethoven and Poulenc. 
</P>
<P>
The program began equivocally, however, with an understated, overly deliberate 
reading of Vivaldi's familiar "Gloria." Although it was easy to admire the 
Master Chorale's purity of blend, balance, and precise articulation, their 
entrances were unduly timid and they appeared to labor mightily for modest 
musical effect. Shaw had aptly scaled down both orchestra and chorus for this 
Baroque gem, but his interpretive approach was not a wise one for the concert 
hall. In a Baroque cathedral, Shaw's subtle shadings would have been surrounded 
by a halo of bright, flattering acoustics. In Symphony Hall, the cantata merely 
sounded muted. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the mood shifted radically for Poulenc's "Gloria." Shaw has 
frequently acknowledged his admiration for the French composer, and he 
successfully turned his appreciation into a memorable performance of Poulenc's 
final choral composition. Shaw pressed lively but well-controlled tempos, 
relished the work's dramatic surprises, and tastefully underscored the score's 
playful instrumentation. It would be difficult to imagine a more persuasive 
reading of the work. 
</P>
<P>
While both orchestra and chorus responded with sympathetic brio, Virginia 
Sublett took the honors as soprano soloist. Whether floating a shimmering line 
above the chorus or following the composer's angular dives into a soprano's 
treacherous lower range, Sublett retained her luminous timbre and graceful 
line. Best of all, she always communicated the text with conviction and 
complete confidence. While the lavish ornamentation and Baroque fioritura of 
her solos in the Vivaldi "Gloria" fit her voice more idiomatically, she made 
the Poulenc, which she was not originally scheduled to sing, her own. 
</P>
<P>
Excerpting the "Gloria" movement from Beethoven's grandiose "Missa Solemnis" 
may not be orthodox programming, but it did end Friday's choral program with 
gusto. Shaw let out all the stops in a vibrant but tasteful reading. Notable 
were the chorus's swift, spirited fugues -- Master Chorale director Frank 
Almond had prepared his ensemble diligently -- and the orchestra's robust 
accompaniment. The quartet of vocal soloists, soprano Lorna Haywood, mezzo 
Michele Henderson, tenor Jon Hymphrey and bass Eric Edlund, sang with balance, 
fervor and an appropriately bright timbre.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS: STEVE GARVEY IS MAD AS HECK AT LATEST 
CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a year of stoic, matter-of-fact responses to the swirl of embarrassing 
stories about his personal life, Steve Garvey changed his tone last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sick and tired of it, and I'm not going to take it anymore," Garvey told 
his XTRA-AM (690) audience Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Garvey used his morning show to lash out at a recent article in Sports 
Illustrated, which detailed his romantic life, providing a time line of the 
day-to-day intricacies of his overlapping relationships. It painted a picture 
of Garvey as "a divorced husband, an unloved father, an unadmired teammate, a 
sinning Christian, a lying man of honor, a failed businessman, a control freak 
out of control." 
</P>
<P>
According to the article, Garvey owes the government more than $500,000 in back 
taxes and his landlord another $172,000, and, perhaps most damaging, it 
questioned the effectiveness, if not the propriety, of charity fund raising 
handled by the tax-exempt Steve Garvey Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, a week after the article hit the stands, Garvey attacked it in 
an interview with KFMB-TV (Channel 8) and said he would discuss "journalism 
ethics" on his radio show the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, Thursday morning, Garvey attacked the article and its author, Rick 
Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
In an "interview" with his on-air partner, Jimmy (The Saint) Christopher, 
Garvey labeled the story a "blatant injustice" and a "rape of my dignity and 
that of my family." 
</P>
<P>
Garvey said the government had disallowed a few of his tax shelters but that he 
is paying his taxes. He denied that he owed the landlord money, and said Reilly 
"misread" the tax documents. 
</P>
<P>
As he has done with other negative articles, Garvey chose to attack the article 
by attacking the author. He said he agreed to do the article on the presumption 
that it was going to be about how someone "bounces back" from problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Reilly is not a journalist," Garvey said. "He can't write very well. He has to 
use a critiquing style." 
</P>
<P>
In response to references to his children in the article -- it quoted one of 
his daughter's testimony during a court case as saying she didn't want to see 
her father and didn't love him -- Garvey described Reilly as a "man who has 
children, but he isn't a man who understands what a father is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Garvey more than once described Reilly as "malicious" and the story as a 
"blatant attack," but he told Channel 8 the night before that he has no plans 
to pursue any legal recourse. 
</P>
<P>
"We stand by our story," said SI spokesman Roger Jackson. "The story went 
through the same vigorous fact-checking procedures as all Sports Illustrated 
stories." 
</P>
<P>
Garvey, unavailable for comment Friday, has always been more than willing to 
publicly discuss his indiscretions, but he rarely has replied with such venom. 
He spoke in his usual controlled, clipped tone Thursday morning, but he was 
clearly angry. 
</P>
<P>
Before going on the air, he had discussed his response with Noble Broadcasting 
President John Lynch, owner of XTRA. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope he does more of that," Lynch said. "He can't ignore what has happened 
in his life. If he's going to be a credible morning drive personality, he's got 
to take it head-on. I absolutely encourage it." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently Garvey is encouraged. He concluded his on-air statements by saying, 
"We are going to keep watch here on Garvey and Co. for irresponsible 
journalism." 
</P>
<P>
After 10 years with KNSD-TV (Channel 39), reporter Cathy Clark was fired Friday 
night. According to sources at the station, Clark had been out of favor since 
Gillett Communications took over the station more than a year ago, and few were 
surprised by Clark's sudden departure. 
</P>
<P>
News Director Don Shafer, reached late Friday, refused to comment, and Clark 
was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
Clark may not have the baby-doll looks of some TV personalities or the 
sensational style of others, but she was respected for her steady reporting 
style. In an interview three weeks ago, she had expressed her unhappiness. She 
had received few key assignments recently. Most noticeably, she was left off 
the station's team that went to San Francisco to cover the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
In other Channel 39 news, Steve Corman, well-respected producer of "Third 
Thursday," has resigned to take the job of executive producer with the Sports 
Channel in Chicago. Corman spent 20 years working in Chicago before joining 
Channel 39 three years ago. Associate Producer Kurt Snider has been promoted to 
executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
A basic rule of television: Never call your audience stupid. Think it perhaps, 
but never say it. For most, it's not a difficult rule to follow. But Ted 
Leitner is not your average television personality. The Channel 8 sportscaster 
has built his career tweaking nerves, and he was at it again last week. 
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's 5 p.m. newscast, he launched into a diatribe against a 
newspaper in Iowa for editorializing that the University of Colorado was using 
the death of quarterback Sal Aunese as an unfair motivational tool. Leitner, 
clearly appalled, blasted the paper for demeaning the heartfelt emotions of the 
team and the courage of the young athlete from Vista -- a good point. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, though, Leitner went into a rant about the people who called him 
to correct a mistake. It was a newspaper in Nebraska, not a newspaper in Iowa. 
Admittedly, it was not a major error. In fact, it was stupid mistake, the type 
that happens in the business all the time. 
</P>
<P>
But Leitner would not be Leitner if he let it go at that. It seems reasonable 
that people from Iowa would not want to be associated with such a ridiculous 
editorial, but Leitner would have none of it. He railed against the callers, 
calling them "stupid" and suggesting that the callers from Iowa should return 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"Either I missed the point or you missed the point and one of us is dumb -- and 
it's not me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Leitner hasn't said a word about his own station's recent 
advertising campaign, which exploits the emotions surrounding Aunese's death by 
showing footage of his funeral in commercials to promote Channel 8's news 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
Just three weeks after KKLQ-FM (Q106) sent out press releases touting the 
addition of Rusty Humphries to its morning team as a producer and on-air 
talent, Humphries was winging back to Dallas. Apparently Humphries simply 
didn't click with Program Director Garry Wall, who has taken over the morning 
show since the departure earlier this year of Jack Murphy and Terry McKeever. 
</P>
<P>
"I went out there and there really wasn't room for me on the morning show," 
Humphries said Friday from Dallas, where he operates a network that supplies 
comedy programming to radio stations. KKLQ will continue to subscribe to 
Humphries' service. . . . 
</P>
<P>
New owners took over KCBQ on Thursday, and morning personality John Forsythe 
was out of a job by Friday night. The feature spots were also dropped, 
including Union columnist Tom Blair's segment. Scotty Morache already had 
jumped ship, taking the general sales manager position at KIFM (98.1).

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: A RETURN TO THE FORBIDDEN CITY'S GLORY DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From 1938 through 1962, the Forbidden City nightclub was a San Francisco 
landmark, featuring elaborate production numbers and specialty acts. It was 
like many such successful clubs of the era, except for one crucial difference: 
It featured Chinese-American entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
Film maker Arthur Dong, whose impressive "Sewing Woman" and "Lotus" reveal his 
concern for his Chinese heritage, had the inspired idea to do a documentary on 
the club, composed of interviews with many of its alumni, and enriched with a 
treasure trove of archival material -- rare footage shot inside the club, 
vintage recordings of its singers and even clips from the Hollywood films in 
which they appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Dong's "Forbidden City, U.S.A." (at the Nuart Wednesday and Thursday, plus 
additional screenings through Tuesday) is the kind of film that has yet to be 
done on Manhattan's Cotton Club. It brims over with nostalgia for a more 
glamorous and innocent show-business era, yet is a commentary on racial 
stereotyping and on the insidiousness of discrimination. The handsome and 
vigorous array of Forbidden City veterans, now in their 60s and 70s, first of 
all had to persuade their often chagrined families that they were serious about 
entering show business and then had to persuade potential employers that 
Americans of Chinese descent could actually sing and dance. For most all of 
them, the late Charlie Low, the Forbidden City's proprietor, was the man who 
gave them their breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Just as African-Americans had their Sepia Mae Wests and Black Valentinos, the 
Forbidden City offered a Chinese Sophie Tucker (Toy Yat Mar), a Chinese Fred 
Astaire (Paul Wing), a Chinese Frank Sinatra (Larry Ching) and even a Chinese 
Sally Rand (Noel Toy). Clearly, these and other performers interviewed have 
their own vibrant personalities and individual talents, but to varying degrees 
submerged them for professional survival. As Toy Yat Mar observes, "I really 
didn't care too much for the label, but it was commercial, so I stuck with it." 
Old recordings reveal that both she and Ching were uncannily accurate as 
sound-alikes of Tucker and Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
When Forbidden City performers toured, as they did during the club's World War 
II heyday, they admit they were confounded by the rigid segregation they 
encountered in the South and were perplexed as to where they fit in, being 
neither black nor white. In any event, the Forbidden City, which became a 
casualty of the North Beach topless clubs and other social changes, was one of 
the few venues open to Chinese-American entertainers. Charlie Low's alumni see 
themselves as Americans first and foremost, and Dong's delightful 57-minute 
film preserves their place in our show-business heritage. 
</P>
<P>
There will be additional showings of "Forbidden City, U.S.A." at 5:45 p.m. on 
Friday, Monday and Tuesday, with Saturday and Sunday matinees at 12:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Information: (213) 478-6377, (213) 479-5269. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Huckenhill's 65-minute "Determinations," which screens tonight at 8 at 
LACE, is one of the most demanding of Filmforum's presentations. 
</P>
<P>
It is a kind of reverie in protest of the severe sentences accorded the five 
members of the Vancouver Direct Action Anarchists, who set off a series of 
bombings in the early '80s in a protest against nuclear weapons development 
(and also pornographic images of women). The film seems totally random, 
composed of reprocessed images, staged vignettes and nature footage, all of 
which is occasionally punctuated by recitations of the five defendants' 
ponderous court statements. 
</P>
<P>
"Determinations" has been called nothing less than an attempt at "rejuvenating

L.A. Festival Details: While still declaring that they will wait until February 
to confirm any programming decisions, Los Angeles Festival organizers are 
beginning to leak more details about the September, 1990, festival. According 
to new programming director Claire Peeps, the Pacific-themed festival will host 
25 to 30 visiting performing companies, and will include 25 to 40 curated 
events featuring local artists. In addition, about 40 films by at least 30 
local and international film makers will be shown. General Manager Michael 
Vargas said that a total of about 200 international artists from "at least 25 
nations" will perform at the festival, and that all the international artists 
will be housed in an artists' village at UCLA. The organizers said that 
confirming the attendance of the 32-member National Dance Company of Cambodia 
was "the thorniest" of all programming activities. But according to Executive 
Director Judith Luther, who has been negotiating the matter with U.S. diplomats 
(the United States does not recognize the Cambodian government): "I think that 
if civil war does not erupt there again, we will be able to bring the artists 
back. I don't think the (U.S.) government is going to take a hard and fast 
stance against (it)." SHAUNA SNOW

Getty Sells Masterpieces: The J. Paul Getty Museum has sold 14 paintings worth 
a total of $18.9 million at five sales in London in the past two weeks, 
auctioneers said. The Getty works sold by Sotheby's were a mixed lot by 
impressionist and 19th-Century artists. Only one failed to sell: a dreary brown 
landscape by Edgar Degas. The top price was $6.8 million paid by the Japanese 
conglomerate Aksa International for Paul Gauguin's 1889 painting of a Breton 
boy in a landscape. Other notable sales included $3 million for a picture of 
the cliffs at Pourville in Normandy by Claude Monet, $3.6 million for a picture 
of three ballet dancers by Degas and $3.4 million for a standing female nude by 
Pierre Bonnard. The museum has sold paintings before and said it would use the 
proceeds from the latest sales to acquire other works better suited to its 
collection and to public display. SHAUNA SNOW

PIANIST PETER SERKIN PRESENTS EVENING OF PREMIERES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In prospect extremely promising, in practice appallingly disappointing, a 
program devoted entirely to new works for the piano as played by Peter Serkin 
was performed in Royce Hall on Friday night. An audience of decent size 
attended, and stayed through intermission. Those who remained longer were not 
rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
No fewer than 11 West Coast premieres occupied the agenda, a project of 
co-commissioning sponsored by the UCLA Center for the Performing Arts, the 92nd 
Street Y in New York, the Chicago Symphony and the Kennedy Center in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Ten composers -- Peter Lieberson, Oliver Knussen, Bright Sheng, Tobias Picker, 
Christine Berl, Tison Street, Alexander Goehr, Luciano Berio, Leon Kirchner and 
Toru Takemitsu -- were represented. Despite the familiarity of some of their 
names, most of them failed to produce engaging or memorable pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Three of these 11 works that might impress on a second hearing are Lieberson's 
two-minute nocturne, "Breeze of Delight," Berl's lyrical and melodious "Lord of 
the Dance," and Berio's etudette, "Feuerklavier," the only bright spot in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, this program became an exercise in compositional futility, though 
Serkin performed all of it with amazing conviction, and with his usual deep 
concentration and immaculate pianism. 
</P>
<P>
He miscalculated in his insistence on lingering too long at the keyboard at the 
end of every piece, and by choosing as his stage companion and page-turner a 
distracting young woman wearing a leather skirt, but he inspired admiration by 
giving his all to music which seemed to deserve less. DANIEL CARIAGA

STEVE REICH, MUSICIANS AT WADSWORTH THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. H. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were no premieres this time for minimalist master Steve Reich and 
Musicians, who visited Wadsworth Theatre Saturday evening. But the familiar 
program -- three recent works prefaced by an excerpt from the 1971 "Drumming" 
-- generated its own excitement and proved once again the wide expressive range 
of a style often regarded as purely mechanical. 
</P>
<P>
The easy standout on this occasion was "Electric Counterpoint," a rare and 
joyful exercise in almost lyric whimsy. Guitarist David Tanenbaum played with 
eager, caressive elan and pinpoint accuracy, imposing a surprising feeling of 
spontaneity on the prerecorded accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
The Sextet, for four percussionists and two keyboard players, had a curiously 
stiff beginning. It settled into a rapt, limber flow, however, as the clearly 
well-practiced ensemble let the interlocking patterns develop their own set of 
musical checks and balances. 
</P>
<P>
After intermission came "Different Trains," Reich's fusion of autobiography, 
Holocaust remembrance and blatant musical pictorialism. This melodrama of taped 
voices, imitated by a string quartet amid much motoric chugging and wailing 
whistles, is not subtle stuff. But it has the courage of its convictions, both 
musical and psycho-social, and the ad hoc touring quartet brought it off with 
visceral urgency. 
</P>
<P>
Reich took a hand himself in Part I of "Drumming," a declamatory statement of 
rhythmic purpose. He and three other drummers ministered to a row of small 
tuned toms, beating out all the motivic permutations with an almost casual 
concentration. J. H.

CALARTS PLAYERS OPEN AMERICAN CHAMBER SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Friday evening, the New CalArts Twentieth Century Players launched an odd 
little weekend concert series in the odd little off-campus location of the 
Santa Monica Museum of Art. The series promised Masterworks of American Chamber 
Music, with the first installment subtitled Grass Roots. 
</P>
<P>
What we heard was an amiable gathering of neoclassic motley, with the craggy, 
crabby exception of Roger Sessions' Five Pieces for Piano. The 
Copland-Piston-Porter-Harris balance could arguably be taken to represent a 
sort of musical Populism, but masterworks is a rather strong term for the lot. 
</P>
<P>
The ever formidably focused Bryan Pezzone played Sessions' pungent, pointed 
pieces with interpretive vigor and technical assurance. He made the rafters of 
the boomy warehouse structure ring, while indicating interrelationships and 
illuminating structural detail. 
</P>
<P>
From there the concert took a slack turn through Walter Piston's early, 
innocently jazzy Three Pieces for Flute, Clarinet and Bassoon, and Quincy 
Porter's rambling, folk-music reminiscent Duo for Viola and Harp. The fluent 
performances could not ennoble the facile music. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Harris' Concerto for Piano, Clarinet and String Quartet may just be a 
masterwork, albeit a minor and generally ignored one. Soloist Pezzone and 
William Powell and a capable quartet projected its Romantic strengths clearly, 
except in the fugal finale, where the dense, awkwardly voiced textures thwarted 
them. There is power in this four-movement piece, and individuality if not 
originality. 
</P>
<P>
Copland's two Threnodies opened the program, in elegant, austere performances 
headed by flutist Rachel Rudich. JOHN HENKEN

MCGEGAN LEADS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trust conductor Nicholas McGegan to look beyond the usual seasonal lollipops to 
the sort of wild (and often wonderful) Baroque mix he presented with the Los 
Angeles Chamber Orchestra on Saturday at Ambassador Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
The nominal tried and true was represented by the opening selection, Corelli's 
"Christmas" concerto grosso. Crisply executed by the small string ensemble 
under McGegan's bright leadership, it emerged as one of the most polished 
examples of Baroque style -- the use of modern instruments notwithstanding -- 
heard here all year. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the evening's solo work was entrusted to a young American soprano, 
Alicia Purcell, who brought her small, well-tuned, agile instrument to the 
chirpy convolutions of Vivaldi's "Laudate pueri" and to the soaring glee of 
that most Italianate of J. S. Bach's sacred cantatas, "Jauchzet Gott." The 
latter was further enhanced by Mario Guarneri's spirited, note-perfect trumpet 
obbligato. 
</P>
<P>
Diverting miniatures by Manfredini and Biber fleshed out a program that ended, 
as it had begun, with familiar pleasures: Bach's Fifth "Brandenburg" Concerto, 
jauntily projected by a conductor who perceives perhaps better than any other 
the dancing heart of Baroque music. 
</P>
<P>
The Bach concerto also offered opportunity for three chamber stalwarts to shine 
in solo capacities: violinist Ralph Morrison, whose playing proved a model of 
sweet-toned enlightenment throughout the evening; harpsichordist Patricia 
Mabee, and flutist David Shostac. HERBERT GLASS

BUSH AIDE TAKES CAUTIOUS VIEW OF AQUINO'S FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Although the Bush Administration had earlier voiced confidence that Philippine 
President Corazon Aquino would quickly overcome the military rebellion against 
her government, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft on Sunday adopted a 
new, less optimistic stance toward the revolt and Aquino's political future. 
</P>
<P>
During two television interviews, Scowcroft acknowledged that the situation in 
the Philippines is "difficult" and that the rebellion "is going to take a long 
time to clean up." 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft also appeared to be seeking to put some political distance between 
the United States and Aquino, who on Friday asked for American warplanes to 
provide air cover and thus help put down the attempted coup. 
</P>
<P>
"We made it clear to her (Aquino) that we did not want to get into the business 
of killing Filipinos," Scowcroft said on NBC's "Meet the Press." Senior Bush 
Administration officials have told The Times that Aquino originally asked for 
the U.S. planes to bomb rebel-held air bases, fuel dumps and a freighter at 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
Asked on CNN's "Newsmaker Sunday" whether Aquino had hurt herself politically 
by having to ask for American help, Scowcroft replied: "I would think not. I 
would think not. But only time can tell on that." 
</P>
<P>
Experts on U.S.-Philippine relations predict that, having cast its lot firmly 
with Aquino during the early hours of the coup attempt that began last Friday, 
the Bush Administration will continue to support her but will also start to 
press her harder for political changes, once the rebellion is put down. 
</P>
<P>
"I think politically, we're still going to back this (Aquino) government very 
strongly, and we should," said Larry A. Niksch, an Asian scholar at the 
Congressional Research Service. "But I think this will further the likelihood 
that the United States, people at the World Bank, the Japanese, are going to 
insist on real reforms, such as land reform, better delivery of rural services, 
and new policies on foreign investment and trade." 
</P>
<P>
Niksch said he believes that even after the rebellion is over, its effects will 
be felt for a long time. "We're in for a prolonged period of tension in the 
Philippines, several months of coup plots and rumored coup plots. And the 
foreign investors will just sit back and wait." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Kreisberg of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, another 
specialist on Asian affairs, said that the United States seems to be 
reexamining its policies and assumptions about the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
"My impression is that no one in Washington knows where to go from here," 
Kreisberg said. "She (Aquino) is in trouble, and we (the United States) are in 
trouble." Still, he added, "I don't think anybody (in the Bush Administration) 
has got a clear idea of who else they can support." 
</P>
<P>
Aquino's term as president ends in 1992, and she has said repeatedly that she 
does not plan to run for reelection. But some U.S. officials have said they 
believe she might eventually be persuaded to change her mind. 
</P>
<P>
If Aquino should step down, most U.S. officials would prefer to see Defense 
Secretary Fidel V. Ramos succeed her. He has close and longstanding ties to 
American military officials and has often voiced support for a continued U.S. 
military presence in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
But Kreisberg said he believes the current, prolonged rebellion has also 
damaged Ramos' political standing. "What this incident has done is to weaken 
Ramos' candidacy," he said. "Ramos was the guy who was supposed to know what 
the military was going to do and to control the military. I think it was a real 
blow to him." 
</P>
<P>
During the television interview on CNN Sunday, Scowcroft spoke bluntly of the 
deep political cleavages within the Philippine armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Aquino government is doing "reasonably well" against the military 
rebels but added: " . . . One of the problems has been apparently a number of 
military units sort of sitting on the fence to see what happens. But President 
Aquino is confident, and therefore, I think we should be." 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft expressed no strong condemnation of the military rebels. "This is an 
attempted military coup," he said. "And of course, the military have been 
ambivalent about her (Aquino) more than the civilians all along. And I think 
they probably feel that she has not prosecuted the struggle against the New 
People's Army (the Communist insurgency) as assiduously as she might." 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, appearing on CBS' "Face the Nation," 
repeated previous U.S. statements that have condemned the rebels for 
undermining the political system in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have here is a situation where people are trying through bullets and 
bayonets to overthrow a freely elected government," Baker said. "And we defend 
democracy. We defend democracy around the world." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a special inter-agency task force of U.S. officials agreed Sunday to 
speed some new equipment to the Philippine armed forces. The equipment includes 
an unspecified number of light anti-tank weapons and approximately 1,000 pounds 
of medical supplies.

THE MALTA SUMMIT;

<P>
BUSH'S VOYAGE: THE PRESIDENCY STRANDED AT SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

VALLETTA, Malta 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the end, it was a pier-side summit. Only George Bush went to sea, and at the 
height of a fierce gale on a cold and Gothic night, the President of the United 
States became the sea's prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
From around 6 p.m. Saturday until well after dawn Sunday, Bush and his queasy 
brain trust were as helplessly stranded aboard the U.S. cruiser Belknap as 
marooned sailors on a desert island. There was literally no place they could 
go, accounts of one of the most extraordinary nights in the history of the 
modern presidency made plain Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush made light of the experience Sunday, and the White House version of it 
read like an updated "Captains Courageous," but neither account obscured the 
concern of American officials alarmed by the sea's captivity of their commander 
in chief. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, it was decided to move the presidential party to a hotel on 
Malta. Guests were rousted from their rooms to make way, but by then it was too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone can say that the saltwater get-together was anything 
other than an adventure, at least not in the harbor here," Bush said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mikhail S. Gorbachev after Sunday's summit schedule was modified yet again 
by a savage storm from the northeast: "This shows we can adjust to changing 
circumstances very well." 
</P>
<P>
The issue was not Bush's safety aboard the big cruiser anchored in Marsaxlokk 
Bay on Malta's south coast, planners said Sunday after Air Force One had left 
for Brussels, but rather his inability to move if there was need to. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the gale Saturday night, with winds gusting above 45 m.p.h. in 
rough seas, planners had run out of contingencies, they conceded Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The presidential party could see land on three sides from the pitching cruiser. 
They could talk instantly to the ends of the Earth. There was ample backup for 
a ship-to-shore telephone cable snapped by the storm. But there was no way 
anybody could leave the Belknap, and no place the ship could easily go. 
</P>
<P>
"The President had his doctor aboard, and the ship's medical facilities are 
good, but in the case of really serious trauma, I don't know what we'd have 
done," said one planner. 
</P>
<P>
With winds far too high for safe helicopter operations, the best of bad options 
for getting the President off the ship would have been for the Belknap to sail 
around Malta and attempt to enter Grand Harbor on its north side, one planner 
said. That would have required sailing into the teeth of the gale and counting 
on the skill of a Maltese harbor pilot in a nasty following sea. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. John F. Sigler, skipper of the Belknap, described Saturday's gale as the 
worst in-port storm he had seen in 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
On the summit's opening day Saturday, after sleeping aboard the Belknap, Bush 
was to have begun talks with Gorbachev on the Soviet cruiser Slava, anchored 
about 400 yards away. Gorbachev never went to his cruiser at all, remaining 
snug on the docked cruise ship Maxim Gorky. 
</P>
<P>
With seas too rough for him to safely board the Slava, Bush went by admiral's 
barge to the Gorky around 10 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
As the two leaders talked for five hours, the storm worsened. By one account, 
the U.S. Navy advised Bush not to return to the Belknap in rising seas. He 
decided to go. 
</P>
<P>
The accommodation ladder on the Belknap's lee side broke on the barge's first 
attempt to board the President. On the second pass at the ladder, he boarded 
safely. 
</P>
<P>
When an American official told Gorbachev of the broken ladder, he replied with 
some asperity: "Better teach your Navy how to repair." By then, the original 
schedule had been modified to a second round of talks on the Gorky, followed by 
dinner there rather than on the American cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
The sea kept rising. The Navy decided to swap the admiral's barge for a Maltese 
tugboat for the return to the Gorky. A longstanding contingency plan went into 
operation: Nobody wanted to risk a late-night return to the Belknap. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, after dinner Bush and his party would ride -- by limousine -- 
from the Soviet liner to the Holiday Inn on the north side of the island. 
</P>
<P>
Frenzy descended on the third floor of the hotel in a cloud of vacuum cleaners. 
While battalions of housekeepers attacked the third floor, official American 
guests, who had been earlier warned that it might happen, were doubled up in 
other rooms. 
</P>
<P>
No, said the sea. 
</P>
<P>
At 6:45 p.m. Saturday, American officials said, Gorbachev was pacing the Gorky, 
impatiently awaiting Bush's return. 
</P>
<P>
The President wanted to go, but he couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
The White House waited until the last minute, then canceled: no talks, no 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
By 7:30 p.m. Saturday, the President and his retinue, including a seasick 
secretary of state, were settling in for a long night as sea-enforced guests of 
the Belknap. 
</P>
<P>
Ashore, Administration officials fretted. 
</P>
<P>
Aboard, by official accounts, former naval officer Bush was enjoying himself. 
Sliding plates made a presidential dinner with his staff "a little shaky," 
Bush's spokesman said Sunday, but afterward the President wandered fore and aft 
speaking with the Belknap's captain and crew about handling a ship in storm 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"The President is in excellent spirits. He loves the sea," a White House 
communique said Sunday morning. "The President seemed energized by the 
intensity of the storm." 
</P>
<P>
He was the only one. 
</P>

The wind fell Sunday, and seas moderated, but Marsaxlokk Bay was still no place 
for a landlubber. Bush decided to attend church services aboard the Belknap 
instead of on the island. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, the schedule said, would come to the American cruiser for Sunday's 
talks. He didn't even try. Bush offered to make a courtesy call on the Slava. 
The Soviets said no. 
</P>
<P>
An American planner said that Gorbachev, a son of the soil, refused to leave 
the rock-steady, firmly moored Gorky to go to any location on water, on advice 
from an admiral on the Slava, who told him it was unsafe to try. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet delegation notified us this morning that they were unwilling to 
attempt to go to the Slava or to Belknap. Therefore we have agreed to continue 
the meetings on the Gorky," said an American communique, finally and officially 
taking the sea out of a seaborne summit that never was. 
</P>
<P>
When someone asked him why Gorbachev hadn't gone to the Belknap, White House 
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, a Kansan survivor of a stormy night in Malta, never 
missed a beat: "He doesn't share our love for the sea."

COUP CRUSHED, MANILA SAYS AMID FIGHTING

<P>
Philippine troops early today continued to battle pockets of rebel holdouts in 
this capital's financial center, but Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos declared 
that the attempted coup has been crushed. 
</P>
<P>
Manila's international airport, closed for three days because of a the coup 
attempt, reopened today, an airport spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos' assertion of victory Sunday came a day after loyalist soldiers repulsed 
a fierce four-hour assault on military headquarters by mutineers seeking to 
topple President Corazon Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, President Bush said that he is prepared to provide additional 
military assistance if necessary to protect American lives. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth day of the military coup attempt began at dawn, as rebel snipers 
fired volleys of machine-gun fire from skyscrapers in the Makati district, the 
nation's business center. Loyalist troops responded with recoilless rifles and 
heavy machine guns, causing widespread damage. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 200 rebels were holding out in the district's numerous 
condominiums, office buildings, shopping malls and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
An Australian diplomat said early today that the office building that houses 
his nation's embassy had been under attack on Sunday and that now rebel snipers 
were inside and shooting back at Philippine soldiers on the streets below. 
</P>
<P>
Similar skirmishes were reported up and down Ayala Boulevard, the district's 
main thoroughfare. At one point, a Manila radio station broadcast an appeal for 
ambulances, saying many civilians lay wounded along Makati's Pasay Road, but 
this could not be confirmed. Elsewhere, Manila was returning to normal, with 
government and private sector employees reporting for work. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the continued fighting, Sunday's failure by the rebels to capture Camp 
Aguinaldo, the heart of the nation's armed forces, was seen by the government 
as a fatal blow to the coup attempt, the sixth and bloodiest attempt Aquino has 
faced since coming to power in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
At least 56 soldiers have been killed and hundreds more wounded since the 
rebellion began, military officials said. There were also at least 20 civilians 
killed and scores hurt in the cross-fire, making this the bloodiest siege yet 
against the Aquino government. Red Cross and hospital officials put the total 
number of wounded at 500. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost certainly has been terrible," conceded military Chief of Staff Renato 
de Villa. 
</P>
<P>
Yet government officials were flushed with a sense of victory. By midday 
Sunday, more than 600 rebels had surrendered, including Lt. Col. Cesar de la 
Pena, who led the assault on the camp. 
</P>
<P>
"The attempted coup by rebel soldiers has been crushed," Ramos declared at a 
news conference on a bomb-scarred parade ground at Camp Aguinaldo in suburban 
Quezon City. He added that only "mopping-up operations" remain. 
</P>
<P>
Security aides pounced on a soldier before he could explode a grenade at an 
outdoor stage where Ramos and Gen. De Villa were speaking, a military spokesman 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. Oscar Florendo said the suspect was arrested Sunday as he was 
removing a grenade from his pocket. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino, in a national radio and television address, ruled out a cease-fire and 
vowed: "I will fulfill what I said -- no cease-fire. What they started, we will 
finish." 
</P>
<P>
Rejecting suggestions by Cabinet members that she declare a "state of siege" -- 
saying that it would be tantamount to martial law -- she pledged that 
lower-ranking enlisted men who joined the rebellion would not be punished. 
</P>
<P>
The fierce, last-ditch battle at Camp Aguinaldo began just before dawn on 
Sunday with a furious rebel artillery attack, including 105-millimeter 
howitzers and heavy machine-gun fire. Using an armored vehicle, about 200 
rebels broke through the gates of the sprawling camp but were repulsed by a 
heavy counterattack from loyalist troops. After a four-hour battle, sometimes 
hand-to-hand, the rebels were forced to retreat, leading to De La Pena's formal 
surrender. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours later, another rebel leader, Brig. Gen. Marcelo Blando, commander 
of Ft. Magsaysay, surrendered in the city's Greenhills District with about 400 
army soldiers and Scout Rangers, military officials said. The mutiny was led by 
marines and army Scout Rangers, considered the elite of the 160,000-member 
armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
De Villa said that about 400 rebels remained in control of Mactan Air Base in 
Cebu, about 350 miles south of Manila, but that he expected to regain the 
facility by today. Government helicopters dropped leaflets urging the rebels to 
surrender. 
</P>
<P>
Since the fighting began, more than 10,000 people have fled their homes, while 
many shops were closed and garbage piled high in the streets. Schools were 
closed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Philippine airline officials said that the extended closure of the airport was 
not due to a direct threat from the rebels but because two 747 passenger 
planes, which were landing just as the coup was starting, were diverted to the 
Cebu base and have been in rebel hands since then. The government reportedly 
feared that the mutinous soldiers at Cebu would use the jumbo jets to transport 
rebel troops to Manila. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, meanwhile, said that he is prepared to take additional military 
action to defend the Philippine government against mutinous troops if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter, Bush formally notified Congress that, at Aquino's request, he had 
ordered military air support to prevent rebel planes from taking off from two 
air bases seized during the revolt. 
</P>
<P>
"At present, I do not foresee the need for U.S. military action in addition to 
the measures described," Bush said. "I am prepared, however, to take additional 
actions to protect the lives of Americans, should they be threatened, and, if 
requested, to provide further assistance to the government of the Philippines." 
</P>
<P>
The letter, sent to Congress Saturday, was released by the White House on 
Sunday morning in Malta, where Bush was holding two days of talks with Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials also confirmed reports Sunday that Aquino asked 
the United States to bomb and strafe rebel positions to help repel the revolt 
-- a request that was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. jets provided air cover for government troops on Friday and the early 
morning hours of Saturday. A spokesman for Clark Air Base said there were no 
American warplanes in the skies over Manila on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
However, by requesting U.S. assistance at the height of the fighting, Aquino 
appears to have undermined her negotiating position at this month's talks on 
the future of huge American military bases in the Philippines, diplomats and 
press commentators said.

ENTIRE EAST GERMAN LEADERSHIP RESIGNS 
</P>

EAST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The entire East German Communist Party hierarchy, led by head of state Egon 
Krenz, abruptly resigned here Sunday in a stunning new blow to the prestige of 
the party and state. 
</P>
<P>
A 25-person "working committee" of reformist members was named to replace the 
leadership until a party congress begins Dec. 15 to assemble a new leadership 
acceptable to the restive, pro-democracy masses. 
</P>
<P>
The mood of Sunday's special session of the party Central Committee, which 
voted to dissolve itself and the Politburo, was caught by a member of the new 
committee, Heinz Albrecht, who spoke to thousands of demonstrators gathered 
outside the party headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Under a lowering dark sky on a misty Berlin day, Albrecht declared: "It was not 
possible to go one step further with criminals." 
</P>
<P>
And Wolfgang Ullmann, a leader of the opposition group Democracy Now, added: 
"The loss of authority by (the Communist Party) was so rapid and obvious that 
this was the only possible consequence." 
</P>
<P>
During the daylong Central Committee session, ousted leader Erich Honecker, 77, 
was expelled from the Communist Party that he led for 18 years, and members 
learned that three recently fired Politburo members have been arrested on 
corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz, 52, will remain in the ceremonial post of president, or head of state, 
which he inherited from Honecker on Oct. 18. But political analysts here said 
Sunday that there is little likelihood he will lead the Communist nation after 
the December meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Although Krenz immediately threw open the Berlin Wall and pushed through other 
reforms, he could not keep pace with grass-roots demands for swifter change and 
the punishment of corrupt party leaders. 
</P>
<P>
At the congress, a new Politburo, Central Committee and government is expected 
to be selected -- and new national policies laid down. 
</P>
<P>
Reformist Prime Minister Hans Modrow, who took over the new government only 
recently, will remain in a caretaker role, consulting with the new committee 
and handling day-to-day affairs until the Communist Party congress. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee's mass resignation indicated the depth of anger building 
up against senior Communist officials during a series of revelations about 
their high style of living -- when they preached austerity for everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
Gregor Gysi, a prominent lawyer named to the 25-member committee, declared on 
East German radio that the group's first action would be to set up a commission 
to investigate charges of corruption and abuse of power. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the official news agency ADN said former Politburo members Guenter 
Mittag, who headed the economy, and Harry Tisch, who was in charge of labor 
unions, had been jailed for fraud and mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, the foreign exchange negotiator, was thrown out 
of the party and said to be a fugitive from justice outside East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Willi Stoph, ex-Parliament President Horst Sindermann and 
State Security Minister Erich Mielke, who wielded vast power, were also 
expelled from the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Also arrested was Gerhard Mueller, a former party leader in Erfurt and a 
non-voting member of the Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement to cheering party members in the square outside the party 
headquarters in central East Berlin, lawyer Gysi declared: "Comrades, we have 
the say now, not to fritter away public trust once again but rather to decide 
together what will become of our party. 
</P>
<P>
"We should never let this responsibility slip from the hands of the people 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Among the better-known members of the new working committee -- none of whom 
served on the Politburo -- were Markus Wolf, for almost 30 years head of East 
German espionage and a recent reformist, and the popular mayor of Dresden, 
Wolfgang Berghofer. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, Krenz has been trying to keep the leadership afloat with a 
succession of dramatic measures, such as the opening of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 
9. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz himself denied any complicity in corruption and quickly moved from the 
senior Communist officials' enclave in Wandlitz to a more modest home in the 
Pankow district of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
But, despite his and the government's moves toward the political and economic 
reforms demanded by demonstrators, his popularity and credibility dwindled day 
by day -- particularly when East Germans saw pictures of the homes and hunting 
lodges reserved for party bigwigs. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz recently admitted that at least 10% of the members have fled the party, 
which once numbered 2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Parliament voted to take away the monopoly on political power that 
the Communist Party enjoyed since the founding of the East German state in the 
postwar division of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the mass resignations were announced Sunday, hundreds of thousands 
of East Germans joined hands to form a chain across the country, part of a new 
demonstration to keep up the pressure for reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker's expulsion from the party was a pathetic ending for a figure who had 
appeared to be the grand old man of East German communism. 
</P>
<P>
A lifelong party man who spent a dozen years in Nazi jails and who thought he 
was creating a triumphant, socialist state in East Germany, the white-haired, 
distant Honecker appeared to be above corruption. 
</P>
<P>
But recent reports and photographs suggest that he and his Communist 
confederates lived like Nazi chieftains -- fond of deer hunting, good food and 
wine, with television gear able to pick up satellite stations from the West. 
</P>
<P>
While Honecker and the others boasted that their economy was the best in the 
Communist world, it was fast failing, according to experts here, and people 
were realizing that socialism was not working for them. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the people Sunday afternoon, lawyer Gysi declared, "We want to 
set about creating a modern socialist party from below." 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party congress will have to work hard to achieve such goals, for 
as Egon Bahr, a leading member of the West German opposition Social Democrats, 
said Sunday night: "The party has beheaded itself. It is dead. There will have 
to be a completely new party -- perhaps with a new name."

CHRONICLER OF 1906 S.F. QUAKE TURNS ATTENTION TO '89 DISASTER WITHOUT MISSING A 
BEAT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As this city's official archivist, Gladys Hansen feels right at home in a musty 
room on the third floor of the Main Library. It is here where she has spent 
more than two decades of her working life on the study of a few moments in 
time: the 1906 earthquake and fire that devastated San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Her findings appear in the book "Denial of Disaster," which arrives in 
bookstores Thursday. The book contains about 300 never-before-seen historical 
photos and hundreds of stories left by survivors documenting the true extent of 
that earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
But her work does not end there. Now, as a result of the 7.1-magnitude temblor 
that struck Northern California on Oct. 17, the 64-year old researcher has 
begun to gather the material for a possible sequel. Only this time, she's using 
firsthand accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"After the quake, I realized this would be a great opportunity to gather 
materials from people to write their own story while it's still fresh in their 
memory, not 50 years later," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 17, She was engaged in her usual routine of meticulously researching 
books and records -- her full-time job with the city -- when "the building 
started making this awful sound, like rocks grinding," she said. "Then I looked 
up among the bookshelves and noticed this rising cloud of dust. I knew 
immediately what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
Two days after the jolt, Hansen and her staff of five assistants passed out 
flyers on the streets to citizens, asking them to record their personal stories 
and to mail them to the library. The main library building in Civic Center was 
closed to the public after the quake but remains open to Hansen and the rest of 
the staff. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Hansen's group has solicited earthquake stories from nearly 400 men and 
women, and just as many from children from Bay Area schools, who sent in 
letters, poems, photographs and drawings. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been really taken aback on how well-written and exciting these stories 
are," Hansen said. "We've been overwhelmed by the public's reception to share 
their stories." 
</P>
<P>
The letters, particularly from children in kindergarten through high school, 
keep pouring in. 
</P>
<P>
Among them is 6-year-old Albert Hinkle's recollections. He was staying at the 
Noriega Children's Center in the city's Sunset District when the quake hit. "I 
was under the table," he wrote. "I didn't panic. The closet was moving. And 
blocks fell down. The lights went off. The clock was dead." 
</P>
<P>
One file contains crayon drawings by students at Grattan Elementary School. One 
of the pictures, titled "Electricity goes out" by first-grader Andy Nguyen, 
portrays two characters holding candles. First-grader Christopher Alberto drew 
"The phones are dead," a page marked by crisscrossing black lines. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids really have an imagination," said Frank Quinn, Hansen's 74-year-old 
research assistant and a retired registrar of voters. "Their accounts are so 
vivid and innocent. We're really smitten by these because the children are the 
future generation." 
</P>
<P>
The hundreds of letters are neatly filed alphabetically by the writer's last 
name in cardboard boxes and each file is labeled. The labels range from 
"Candlestick Park -- World Series" to "Paraplegic's account of earthquake day." 
The storytellers represent an assortment of ages, professions, backgrounds and 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
"You had two waves going on during the earthquake," Hansen said. "One was the 
wave of tourists fleeing the city, and the other were Bay Area residents either 
on out-of-town business trips or on vacation elsewhere, who came back to the 
city just as fast as the tourists left it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to reach people who were among the tourists who fled as soon as 
possible after the quake hit. Obviously, their reaction to the quake is totally 
different from native San Franciscans." Hansen has already heard from some 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Loretta Anderson of Minneapolis was attending a business convention with her 
husband at the downtown Hilton on Oct. 17 when the building rocked back and 
forth. She wrote, "I'll take good old Minnesota blizzards and yes, tornadoes, 
anytime. At least you have a warning. No one can predict an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Cotton and his wife, Carol, cut a vacation in London short after they 
were telephoned at 6 a.m. (London time) on Wednesday, Oct. 18, by a friend who 
told them that "there's been a terrible earthquake, the Bay Bridge collapsed 
and the Marina's on fire." The Cottons left London on Sunday morning and headed 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"The first surprise was the eeriness of the city," Steve Cotton wrote of their 
arrival back. "Our cab was the only car on the road." 
</P>
<P>
For Koula Meletis of San Francisco, returning home from her job in the downtown 
financial district required hiking because public transportation had stopped 
running. She walked exactly 7.1 miles to get home, she noted, which is the same 
number as the magnitude of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like a war zone the whole way home," Meletis wrote. "There was 
debris and broken glass everywhere. I walked through the darkness and relied on 
the headlights of cars to guide me home. Not bad for a 58-year-old woman." 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, Hansen established the San Francisco Earthquake Research Project as a 
private, volunteer effort to piece together the full story of the 1906 
earthquake. Among the volunteers was her son, Richard, a search-and-rescue 
instructor and photographer. 
</P>
<P>
"Denial of Disaster" is the result of 24 years of work by Hansen. It was 
scheduled to have rolled off the publisher's presses on Oct. 19. The press run 
was delayed for days by Cameron Publishing of San Francisco to allow time to 
insert one page devoted to the 1989 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The book has since raised controversy with its claims that the 1906 earthquake 
deaths were purposely minimized by city officials who wanted the world to know 
that the quake was not so bad, that the resulting fires caused most of the 
havoc. Businesses similarly downplayed earthquake devastation and blamed their 
losses on fires so they could collect on their fire insurance, Hansen's book 
contends. The book also says that photographs of the destruction were 
retouched. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way this one could be denied," Hansen said of the impact of the 
recent quake. "It's all right here," she said in an interview, holding up her 
files. "Hopefully, this last one gave us the opportunity to see what went wrong 
and allowed us the chance to rehearse our response to the next great 
earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
Comparing the letters she has received, Hansen said people's mood changed as 
time went by. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, we received letters from folks who said, 'That's it, I'm 
leaving,' " Hansen said. "But now, no one is saying that. More and more say 
this is where their heart is and they're staying." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen said it is too soon to tell if the materials she is gathering will lead 
to another book. Her priority is to keep collecting resources and eventually 
she wants to preserve the letters on microfiche. She looks forward to next 
month when the archive room and the rest of the library is scheduled to reopen 
to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"People will always want to know what happened," she said. "They want details. 
The stories they've recorded here are what make the event human for future 
generations." 
</P>
<P>
Junior high school student Eugenia Crowley put her thoughts down in a poem she 
submitted for her creative writing class, then mailed to Hansen: 
</P>
<P>
 "Children will listen when the old folks say, 
</P>
<P>
 'I was there when it happened, I remember it well. 
</P>
<P>
 When the earth shook on that fateful day 
</P>
<P>
 And the bridge was damaged that spans the Bay."' 
</P>
<P>
 This will help, says Gladys Hansen, to keep the record straight.

ASILOMAR: A PLACE TO TAKE A MEETING AWAY FROM IT ALL

<P>
Each autumn, art teacher Pat Abraham and a group of her students from Roseville 
Art Center in a Sacramento suburb come here for a week "to get away from it 
all" and devote their energies exclusively to painting. 
</P>
<P>
The setting is the 76-year-old Asilomar Conference Center, a unit of the State 
Park System in a secluded 105-acre pine forest overlooking the Pacific Ocean at 
the tip of Monterey Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a wonderful, peaceful, quiet place. We paint from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
with time out for meals. We paint what's here, tide pools, Monterey pines, 
dunes, the sea," said Abraham, who was at Asilomar with eight students, all 
homemakers and businesswomen. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers come for meetings, as do scientists, politicians, engineers, lawyers, 
doctors, members of all types of organizations, including the International 
Assn. of Oz. 
</P>
<P>
This year, more than 1,500 groups -- some small, such as Pat Abraham's art 
class, some with as many as 850 people -- will have held meetings at Asilomar 
Conference Center. Some groups spend only a day, some several days, some an 
entire week. More than 200,000 group members have stayed here so far in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Groups choosing Asilomar as a meeting place come from as far as Hong Kong, 
Japan, Great Britain, Germany and Australia. The majority -- 65% of the groups 
-- come from California. Religious groups account for 30% to 35%, education and 
government, each 20%, and about 10% are from companies and corporations. 
</P>
<P>
One obvious attraction is the low cost: $38-a-day per person, including three 
excellent meals. Some groups book three years in advance to be sure to get a 
particular time. One religious group has been coming every year for 71 years. 
Repeat business is 85%. 
</P>
<P>
Asilomar has been owned since 1956 by the State Parks and Recreation Department 
and operated ever since by a nonprofit corporation that pours all earnings back 
into new construction, renovation of buildings and park-like grounds. The 
conference center area is dotted with 58 structures. 
</P>
<P>
In one corner of the scenic grounds is the William Penn Mott Jr. Training 
Center, serving as an academy for state park rangers and as an educational 
facility for other parks department employees. 
</P>
<P>
"The mission of Asilomar since its establishment by the YWCA in 1913 and 
continuing to the present is to provide an inexpensive place for people to meet 
and confer," explained Don Elisha, 61, general manager of Asilomar the last 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In its serene, park-like setting, Asilomar offers the visitor a distinctive if 
Spartan experience: comfortable but simple guest rooms; no telephones or 
television in the guest lodges; no room service; no cocktail lounges, and no 
liquor served at meals. 
</P>
<P>
Many guest rooms have fireplaces, as do all the meeting rooms. Conference room 
chairs are designed for comfort, thick padding on seats, raised backs to endure 
long hours in meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"Meetings are held 12 months of the year," Elisha said. "We can sleep as many 
as 1,000 a night in lodges on the grounds. We have 90% year-round occupancy. We 
employ 250 with a payroll of $4 million annually. Our sales run about $10 
million a year." 
</P>
<P>
A third-generation hotelier, Elisha is also president of the 15,000-member 
California Hotel-Motel Assn., the largest association of its kind in America. 
</P>
<P>
Guest rooms are nestled in the pines in two-story rustic lodges, each close to 
meeting rooms. Lodges and meeting rooms have quaint nautical names such as 
Nautilus, Triton, Seascape, Whitecaps, Marlin, Dolphin, Surf and Sand, 
Spindrift. 
</P>
<P>
It was philanthropist Phoebe Apperson Hearst (1842-1919), mother of newspaper 
publisher William Randolph Hearst, who first suggested the conference center. 
She was a patron of the YWCA and donated 30 acres to the YWCA to start Asilomar 
in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
The name Asilomar is a combination of Indian and Spanish and means refuge by 
the sea. 
</P>
<P>
California architect Julia Morgan, the first woman admitted to Ecole des 
Beaux-Arts architectural school in Paris, designed the first three buildings at 
Asilomar. She was the architect of the Herald Examiner building in Los Angeles, 
Hearst Castle, a number of buildings at UC Berkeley, and more than 700 
buildings throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
The Julia Morgan Lodges, constructed of natural stone, redwood walls, exposed 
timbers and massive fireplaces at Asilomar, have been renovated and restored. 
Many of the lodges and meeting rooms are of relative recent construction and of 
contemporary architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Asilomar's 50 acres of white sand dunes on the beach eroded 
badly, due to years of overgrazing, brush-clearing and logging. For the last 
eight years, a concentrated effort has been made to restore the dunes to what 
they were like before man's impact. 
</P>
<P>
The dunes have been replanted with original flora. Two winding boardwalks 
across the dunes provide visitors an opportunity to appreciate the beauty of 
the conference center's beachfront and soak up the atmosphere of a California 
tradition.

<P>
For Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the first payoff from his weekend 
summit with President Bush came when they sat down Sunday afternoon for the 
first joint press conference by U.S. and Soviet leaders in more than four 
decades of such summits. 
</P>
<P>
The message that the televised press conference sent back to viewers in Moscow 
was that Soviet-American relations are on a new basis -- friendlier, more 
cooperative and no longer confrontational. 
</P>
<P>
Significant progress was made, the two leaders said, in defining the issues and 
setting the timetables necessary to conclude a series of arms control treaties, 
including an agreement that will reduce strategic arsenals by as much as 50%. 
</P>
<P>
This was No. 1 on Gorbachev's agenda for the summit, and Soviet officials said 
that Moscow's hopes for the meeting were justified. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the feeling before that we must start moving in our relationship, and 
now we know that the American side shares this," Georgy A. Arbatov, director of 
the Soviet Institute for the Study of the United States and Canada, said here 
Sunday. "From this meeting, we know that we have the basis for moving ahead 
with the United States and going faster. The understandings are there." 
</P>
<P>
The United States, responding to the Soviet Union's serious economic problems, 
had also offered to begin immediate negotiations on a trade agreement, to 
extend the lower tariffs of most-favored-nation trading status to Moscow and to 
support Soviet membership in such key international economic organizations as 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush has signaled an end to U.S. economic warfare against the Soviet Union," 
Arbatov said. "This is important for our economic development and our 
integration into the world economy." 
</P>
<P>
And the two presidents' intense discussions on Eastern Europe, where 
developments continue to race beyond the superpowers' ability to predict, led 
to a broad measure of understanding, Bush and Gorbachev said, on what is now 
Moscow's most sensitive foreign policy worry. 
</P>
<P>
Perestroika, in short, appeared to be paying off in significant ways, and 
although the immediate results were in foreign affairs, they offered some 
much-needed hope for Soviet citizens who feel increasingly trapped in their 
country's deepening economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet public consciousness, better Soviet-American relations translate 
into reduced government spending on defense, more money available for consumer 
goods, less of the privation that people have known for generations, greater 
prospects for foreign trade and high-quality imports, less tension in 
international affairs and more freedom in domestic politics. 
</P>
<P>
"Soviet-American relations have become one of those barometers of well-being 
that people keep track of," Leonid I. Dobrokhotov, a foreign policy specialist 
from the Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee, said. "They know that when 
Soviet-American relations go bad, things can really turn sour for them, and 
they hope that, as relations become better, life will get sweeter -- at least a 
little bit sweeter." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, with Gorbachev at his side, reinforced this message at the press 
conference with praise of the Soviet president and perestroika, or 
restructuring, as Gorbachev's five-year-old program of political and economic 
reforms is known. 
</P>
<P>
"There is enormous support in our country for what Chairman Gorbachev is doing 
inside the Soviet Union," Bush said, describing Soviet-American relations as 
"improving dramatically." "There is enormous respect and support for the way 
that he has advocated peaceful change in Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
And a key Gorbachev foreign policy adviser, recalling British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher's early characterization of Gorbachev, said of Bush, "This is 
a man we can do business with." 
</P>
<P>
The summit, proposed by Bush but long sought by Gorbachev, had become, in the 
short month since it was first announced, an important test of the ability of 
the Soviet leader's foreign policy to bring practical results, not just 
applause from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"In the West, it is often said that Gorbachev tries to substitute foreign 
policy successes for the lack of progress in his reforms at home," a senior 
Soviet commentator said here Sunday, "and there is a kernel of truth in that. 
People do wonder what they themselves get out of these enthusiastic welcomes he 
gets abroad. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is going to eat better tomorrow as a result of these talks with Bush, 
and nobody expects to. What people are looking for are results, something that 
goes beyond the cheers of 'Gorby, Gorby.' In arms reduction, there is a promise 
of that, and in economic cooperation and trade, there is more than just a 
promise of it." 
</P>
<P>
After a hard look at what Bush had laid out in the first and the most important 
round of talks, Gorbachev's top advisers concluded that Soviet-American 
relations are developing very much on track, headed in the direction Moscow had 
hoped for and gathering speed. 
</P>
<P>
"The summit demonstrated that movement has resumed between Moscow and 
Washington," Arbatov said. "We had this long pause at the start of the Bush 
Administration. We accept that this was due more to technical than political 
reasons, but it did leave us uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we know that we will move ahead in all important fields -- arms control, 
economic cooperation, international questions, regional issues, bilateral 
relations." 
</P>
<P>
In arms control, what was most important, Soviet officials said, was the 
agreement to identify key issues and set a timetable for their resolution so 
that a treaty reducing nuclear arsenals is ready in all major aspects by the 
next summit in late June and a multilateral convention reducing conventional 
armed forces in Europe is completed by the end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III is due to travel to Moscow in January for 
talks with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on the first set of issues, 
and one or two other meetings are likely before the June summit. 
</P>
<P>
Although Washington had already declared its desire for an agreement next year 
on reducing conventional forces in Europe, Moscow was pleased by Bush's 
personal commitment to resolve the differences among the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization's 16 members that have slowed progress in negotiations between the 
Atlantic Alliance and the seven countries of the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. acceptance in principle of a European summit meeting, with its 
participation and that of Canada, surprised Soviet officials, though it is 
uncertain whether it would be convened for the signing of the conventional arms 
agreement or later on a broader basis to discuss the Continent's future. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's offer to end production of all chemical weapons in return for matching 
Soviet and Third World concessions also won cautious praise from specialists in 
the Soviet delegation. 
</P>
<P>
"Arms control for us is perhaps the touchstone of the whole Soviet-American 
relationship, and we were pleased not only by what Bush said but by the effort 
he took to address our concerns and priorities," a Soviet foreign policy 
specialist remarked. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, addressing the press conference aboard the Soviet cruise ship Maxim 
Gorky, said there had been "elements of optimism and pessimism" in Moscow's 
pre-summit assessment of the prospects for Soviet-American relations but that 
the elements had been "cautious and restrained." 
</P>
<P>
"Now that the meeting has taken place, and we have summed up the results, 
together with (President Bush), I can tell you that I am optimistic about the 
results and the prospects that are open now," he said.

TARIFF GROUP WILL DEFER SOVIET BID; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: PRESIDENT BUSH SUPPORTS OBSERVER STATUS FOR MOSCOW IN GATT. BUT 
CONSULTATIONS COULD DELAY ACTION.

<P>
The Soviet Union's request for observer status in the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade probably will not be formally considered until some time next 
year, despite President Bush's announcement at the Malta summit of U.S. support 
for the move, international trade officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Geneva-based organization technically could have approved the 
Soviet application at its annual meeting, which begins today, GATT officials 
say the request most likely will go through normal channels, which includes 
several months of consultations with representatives of GATT's 97 member 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
While the process could be speeded up if Bush decides to press more rapidly in 
the wake of this past weekend's summit, both U.S. and GATT officials say the 
issue most likely will be brought up at a meeting of the policy-making GATT 
Council sometime next summer. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, however, the Soviet Union might have to content itself with observer 
status for several years, as is traditional in the case of new applicants. 
Full-fledged membership for Moscow in GATT -- the organization that administers 
world trading rules and tariff structures -- could be as far off as the 
mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
There had been some speculation that the request might be considered at today's 
meeting. The session is expected to be a routine one, and most of the 97 
delegations are considered likely to support the spirit of the superpower 
detente. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the endorsement of the Soviet application by Bush marked a 
reversal of previous U.S. policy on the issue. Washington had insisted before 
that the Soviets were not ready for membership in GATT because their economy 
was not based on market prices -- the economic system on which GATT regulations 
and enforcement efforts are founded. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush apparently changed his mind partly to reward the Soviet Union for the 
efforts of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to ease political and economic 
constraints on East European countries as part of his perestroika plan, under 
which the Soviets are trying to move toward a more market-oriented economic 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also indicated that the United States would support other efforts to 
enable the Soviet Union to participate in the global trade and monetary system. 
This would take place through increased foreign investment by American 
businesses, restoration of most-favored-nation trade status that Moscow lost in 
1974 over the Jewish emigration issue and -- eventually -- possibly even 
membership in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Bush did not specifically mention the IMF and World Bank in his news conference 
Sunday, and the Soviets have not formally sought to join either body. However, 
the President said broadly that he would try to help the Soviet Union "seek 
common ground in these multilateral organizations." 
</P>
<P>
As late as last month, U.S. officials had insisted that Washington was not 
about to flip-flop on the issue of whether to back the Soviet application to 
seek observer status in GATT. However, the Administration appeared to some to 
take a softer tone on eventual GATT membership by Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
What observer status would grant the Kremlin is the ability to attend GATT 
meetings, speak, and consult with GATT officials, but not to have a vote in 
formal decision-making. Officials said Moscow will not be taking part in the 
current Uruguay Round talks on global trade liberalization, which is scheduled 
to formally close at the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Soviet officials already are working on a series of other measures 
designed to normalize their trade relations -- steps that are expected to lead 
to a White House decision in a few weeks to restore trade benefits to the 
Soviet Union that were revoked in 1974 over a dispute involving emigration of 
dissidents. Bush said a U.S. announcement restoring those benefits could come 
as early as the next U.S.-Soviet summit, in June. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a U.S.-Soviet negotiating team agreed to begin exploratory talks on 
drafting a new U.S.-Soviet trade accord, a first step toward restoring 
so-called "most-favored-nation" status. They also announced the start of new 
talks on bilateral tax and investment treaties. 
</P>
<P>
Granting GATT observer status will be easy technically, but unusual. 
Ironically, the number of applications for such status that have been approved 
in recent years has been minimal. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the United States and the European Economic Community served notice 
that they both would oppose any further applications -- partly to pressure from 
some developing countries that were listed as observers to formally join before 
the beginning of the Uruguay Round at Punta del Este later that year. 
</P>
<P>
Observer status traditionally has been seen as a sort of candidacy, in 
preparation for eventual full membership in GATT. China was granted observer 
status in 1986, but its once-steady move toward full membership has been put on 
hold in the wake of the Tian An Men Square bloodshed last summer. 
</P>
<P>
A GATT working group is scheduled to hold another routine meeting next week on 
China's status, but is not likely to make any decisions. At U.S. insistence, 
relations with China have been kept at the technical level, not involving 
Cabinet ministers. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has been actively pressing for observer status in GATT for the 
past 3 1/2 years. Last July, Gorbachev wrote Bush and six other Western leaders 
attending the annual seven-nation economic summit in Paris, asking for their 
help in making Moscow a part of the international economic system. However, he 
received no firm reply. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- GATT -- was 
established by the United Nations in January, 1948, to administer world trading 
rules and tariff structures. Based in Geneva, GATT has 97 members. The 
organization's main thrust has been to promote the expansion of international 
trade by reducing tariffs through multilateral negotiations. Loosely organized, 
GATT meets once a year to review progress and decide on new measures. It also 
holds tariff-negotiating conferences. The eighth conference -- the so-called 
Uruguay Round, which convened in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in 1986 -- is due to 
end this year.

TAIPEI, Taiwan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A delegation of U.S. congressional observers Sunday praised Taiwan for having 
just conducted what the Americans called its most honest election in four 
decades, but they warned against any postelection arrests of opposition 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"Our key judgment was that this year's election was the most free and fair in 
Taiwan's history," the five-member delegation said in a statement released at a 
press conference. "On the other hand . . . we cannot say that, by any objective 
standard, it was fully free and fully fair." 
</P>
<P>
The statement listed uneven access to electronic media, limitations on free 
speech, legal restrictions on former political prisoners, possible election-day 
abuses and Taiwan's lack of a genuinely democratic constitutional structure as 
major areas of concern. 
</P>
<P>
The delegation also declared: "We believe it would be unfortunate if the good 
will, which has been generated through this electoral exercise, were dissipated 
in the days and weeks ahead by the harassment and arrest of candidates who have 
made controversial statements." 
</P>
<P>
In balloting Saturday, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party made 
significant gains against the ruling Nationalist Party. Competing for the first 
time in an election in which organized opposition parties were legal, the 
Democratic Progressive Party established a solid base of grass-roots political 
strength by taking control of the top executive position in six big cities or 
counties, including Taipei county, which surrounds the island's capital. The 
Nationalists won in 14 cities or counties, and an independent candidate took 
one mayor's slot. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Progressive Party, the island's only significant opposition 
party, also won 21 seats in the legislative Yuan. While far less than a 
majority -- the legislature is dominated by Nationalist Party members who did 
not need to face reelection -- this figure nearly doubled the opposition's 
previous strength, and for the first time, gives it enough seats to enjoy the 
legal right to introduce legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The election was marked by the strong impact of decades-long tension between 
the island's native-born majority and those who fled the Chinese mainland in 
1949 with the Nationalist government to escape the Communists. Taiwan's 
political structure is still based on the claim of the Nationalist government 
to represent all of China -- a claim the ruling party uses to avoid truly open 
national elections that might enable an opposition party to take over the 
island's government. 
</P>
<P>
At a jubilant victory rally early Sunday morning, You Ching, an opposition 
legislator who won the office of Chief Executive of the Taipei county 
government, worked an excited working-class crowd, using the Taiwanese dialect, 
which generally is understood only by the approximately 85% of the population 
with ancestral roots in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
You urged about 5,000 singing, clapping supporters to refrain from any violence 
protesting an unexpected delay in releasing official results of the Taipei 
county race, but to continue their rally until authorities formally confirmed 
his victory. The rally ended peacefully shortly after 3 a.m., when You was 
officially named the winner in the most important race of the election. 
</P>
<P>
A similar scene in the city of Tainan developed into a tense standoff outside 
county government headquarters that lasted well into the day Sunday, according 
to reports from that southern city. About 2,000 Democratic Progressive Party 
supporters gathered to protest alleged vote-rigging, which they charged was 
costing their candidate victory. 
</P>
<P>
However, the crowd dispersed early today when the losing candidate, Li 
Tsung-Fan, said that the street protest should end but that the dispute would 
be taken to court. 
</P>
<P>
Tsai Shih-yuan, deputy secretary general of the Democratic Progressive Party, 
said at a Sunday press conference in Taipei that the opposition will challenge 
the results in four races -- Tainan county, Nantou county, Taichung city and 
Hsinchu city. 
</P>
<P>
Tsai also expressed optimism that authorities will not attempt to imprison any 
of a group of Democratic Progressive Party candidates who during the campaign 
openly advocated a formal declaration of Taiwanese independence from China. 
</P>
<P>
While Taiwan functions in most ways like an independent country, the 
Nationalist government in Taipei and the Communist government in Beijing agree 
that the island legitimately is part of China. The two regimes certainly argue 
over which government is the proper ruler of China. 
</P>
<P>
Many leaders of the Democratic Progressive Party would prefer to end this 
situation by declaring a Republic of Taiwan, but under Taiwan's national 
security law, it is illegal to say anything publicly in favor of such actions. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House subcommittee on Pacific 
and Asian affairs, and head of the congressional observer group visiting Taiwan 
for the election, said in a brief interview after Sunday's press conference 
that he and his fellow congressmen are concerned about talk that some 
opposition candidates who publicly took a pro-independence stance might soon be 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Tsai, at the opposition party's press conference, expressed confidence that the 
government will not dare to make such arrests. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe there will be many cases under investigation, but we do not expect 
prosecutions," Tsai said. "I don't think the KMT (Nationalist Party) is that 
stupid."

CZECHOSLOVAKIA: OPPOSITION LEADER VACLAV HAVEL SAYS HE SEEKS TRUTH AND JUSTICE, 
NOT POWER.

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid the sense of freedom that has come to Czechoslovakia during the last two 
weeks, a new political statement has appeared in the form of a flashy red, 
white and blue campaign button. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Czechoslovak national colors, the button carries the name of 
opposition leader Vaclav Havel and the words "Havel for President." 
</P>
<P>
The button reflects the popularity of the most prominent figure in the 
country's opposition movement, but it falls short of reality. 
</P>
<P>
While the 53-year-old Czechoslovak playwright has clearly been the key 
opposition personality, he has always made it plain he wants no part of power. 
</P>
<P>
"I am an amateur, standing in for a professional politician," he told a group 
of reporters after announcing the creation of the opposition group Civic Forum 
that toppled one of the last remaining hard-line Communist regimes in a matter 
of two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"My ambition is to be a playwright again." 
</P>
<P>
His views characterize those of Civic Forum itself -- a group that insists it 
is not a political party, resisted even proposing names for the new government 
(although it eventually relented) and makes no claim on political power. 
</P>
<P>
Quiet, shy and excessively polite by nature, Havel's uncertain personal 
demeanor masks a brutal honesty and a quiet courage that flow as a common 
thread through his writings. 
</P>
<P>
His famous 1975 "Letter To Dr. Gustav Husak," the Communist Party leader at the 
time, stands as one of the most powerful essays even written on the spiritual 
deprivation that lies behind the facade of normalcy in repressive states. 
</P>
<P>
"True enough the country is calm," he wrote to Husak. "Calm as a morgue or a 
grave, would you not say?" 
</P>
<P>
The portrayal of the agents of state repression more as mindless apparatchiks 
than as a cunning force of evil may seem surreal to those in the West, but to 
Czechoslovaks, they are frighteningly accurate. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, Havel explains his opposition in unfettered terms. 
</P>
<P>
"I simply take the side of truth against any lie, of sense against nonsense, 
justice against injustice." 
</P>
<P>
Havel was born into a wealthy Prague family in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
His father and grandfather were highly successful builders, and Havel's present 
fifth-floor apartment -- a product of his father's work -- has a bay window 
with views of both the city's ornate 14th-Century Charles Bridge and the 
towering Prague Castle that dates back to the 9th Century. 
</P>
<P>
While the fruits of his family's entrepreneurial spirit made his early years 
ones of privilege, they also targeted him as a member of the bourgeois enemy 
when the Communists seized power in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
He lost his place in school at 15 and began a long, torturous relationship with 
Czechoslovak communism. 
</P>
<P>
Havel has worked as a laborer, a taxi driver and a stagehand. He has been 
jailed three times -- once for nearly four years -- while his essays and plays 
have been banned from Czechoslovak public consumption for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
He has rarely flinched. 
</P>
<P>
When offered the chance to emigrate to New York in the late 1970s, where one of 
his plays was beginning production, he refused to go. 
</P>
<P>
"I am Czech," he explained to a free-lance journalist earlier this year. "This 
was not my choice, it was my fate. But I accept it, and I try to do something 
for my country because I live here." 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, he helped transmit the drama of the Soviet-led invasion of 
Czechoslovakia on the short-lived Free Czech Radio. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years later later, he co-founded the Czechoslovak human rights movement 
Charter 77, and although blocked by authorities from participating in public 
life, nevertheless became a beacon of hope for those struggling for freedom. 
</P>
<P>
In a tiny opposition of intellectuals, the power and clarity of his ideas stood 
out. 
</P>
<P>
In a country that worships great writers and good theater, Havel excelled in 
both. 
</P>
<P>
Students marching toward Wenceslas Square on the fateful night that their 
demonstration was broken up by riot police shouted "Long live Havel!" as they 
walked. 
</P>
<P>
As they passed the National Theatre, they shouted, "Stage Havel plays!" 
</P>
<P>
In the hours after the student beatings, it was Havel who made the first 
crucial contacts with those who created Civic Forum and persuaded the 
leadership of the small Socialist Party to forsake its long partnership with 
the Communists and join the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
In the days that followed, he remained the central figure in the opposition 
push that eventually toppled the Communist hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
Only on Sunday, with news that the new coalition government contained a 
preponderance of Communists, did Havel face his first criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Reportedly against the objections of many advisers, Havel argued for a halt to 
the demonstrations in the belief the opposition goals were virtually achieved. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly Havel lacks anything akin to the killer instinct of a politician. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his harassment and imprisonment by the Communist authorities, he has 
never called for revenge. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the hard-liners, who had tormented him for years before their fall 
from power in recent days, Havel told the West German weekly Der Spiegel: 
"Personally, I'll be satisfied if these people go on living in the luxurious 
villas they built and just never again meddle in the politics of this country."

HOW WILL IT PLAY IN PRIBRAM? REFORMERS WORRY; 
</P>
<P>
CZECHOSLOVAKIA: THE WINDS OF DEMOCRATIC CHANGE TAKE THEIR TIME GETTING TO THE 
PROVINCES.

PRIBRAM, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The revolution is a little more tense in the Czechoslovak provinces than it is 
in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, for example, the sign posted near the door of a neighborhood Pribram 
restaurant over the weekend. "Attention!" it read. "Civic Forum was recognized 
by the government as an equal partner in conducting all social dialogue. The 
removing of posters and declarations of the Civic Forum is a sabotage of this 
dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that the umbrella opposition group, which is leading the 
campaign for political pluralism and free elections in Czechoslovakia, has an 
outpost here in the wooded countryside about 50 miles outside the capital, 
Prague. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news is that it has enemies that have been tearing down its signs -- 
and worse. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, entrenched opponents of democratic change have been making mischief in 
many provincial towns as Czechoslovakia has gone on the political equivalent of 
fast-forward to join the revolution sweeping Eastern Europe. Their tactics 
range from threats and provocations to cutting off the town power supply when 
representatives of Civic Forum are on television. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum strategists in Prague say they are concerned that the party's 
central leadership, which appears to have accepted the inevitability of change, 
is no longer in control of its own local, district and regional apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
The strategists fear that these lower-level officials, possibly in partnership 
with recently deposed hard-liners from the central party organs, could trigger 
a dangerous backlash that would threaten all that has been gained in just two 
heady weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic analysts agree that the countryside is both more conservative and 
more subject to hard-line manipulation than urban areas, but they believe that 
the Civic Forum strategists may be overstating the danger. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that things are reversible," said one. "I don't think they are. But 
this type of thing could make it messy." 
</P>
<P>
The sense in Pribram is that although the revolution has clearly arrived, 
people are still looking nervously over their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is slower here," said Lenka Salkova, 25, a teacher who lives in 
Pribram and works in the capital. "In Prague, there is enthusiasm, and people 
lived (the political upheaval) right from the beginning. Here, you have to push 
people into it." 
</P>
<P>
Attempted intimidation by old-style Communist Party bosses desperately trying 
to retain their power is only one reason for this situation, and perhaps not 
even the most important. 
</P>
<P>
Pribram's main industry is uranium mining, mostly for export to the Soviet 
Union. And although the mines are rapidly playing out, the miners are among the 
most generously rewarded of Czechoslovakia's proletariat. Surrounding 
cooperative farms are also relatively well-to-do, and as a result, the standard 
of living here is good by East European standards. 
</P>
<P>
Ask an average Pole what is lacking in the stores and he will probably list 
everything from meat to toilet paper. But a Pribram homemaker listed a color 
television, automatic washing machine and a freezer. "I have a beautiful house, 
a car and a weekend place," boasted a retired technician who would not give his 
name. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for political conservatism is that it is a lot more risky to 
stand up and be counted in the provinces. "In a small city, you haven't got the 
anonymity you do in the city," said Bohomil, 51, a Pribram engineer who also 
asked that his last name be omitted for fear of possible repercussions for his 
two children. 
</P>
<P>
"If you stand up, everybody knows who stood up," he added. "So, if there are 
any doubts that it may turn around, people in a small town are more reluctant 
to get involved." Also, noted a Western diplomat, the power of patronage 
"extends very deep in the countryside.' 
</P>
<P>
It all adds up to a greater sense of political caution in the countryside -- a 
sense clearly reflected in a weekend opinion poll distributed by the official 
CTK news agency. It showed that while 58% of the population in Prague supports 
Civic Forum, the figure including the provinces falls to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
The political difference is almost instantly clear in Pribram. Across from the 
party's cavernous marble headquarters building with the imported windows and 
gleaming steel trim are several red-and-white propaganda banners flying from 
apartment buildings and stores. The banners used to be common throughout 
Eastern Europe, but now they are rare in Prague or even Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
There aren't nearly as many opposition notices as one finds in Prague, although 
at Civic Forum's main meeting place, in the town's theater, there was one 
homemade poster urging: "Give us freedom for Christmas!" 
</P>
<P>
The retired technician, who had stopped to read the Civic Forum bulletins, 
conceded that Pribram is more conservative than Prague. But he said it is only 
"a question of time" before the political situation catches up. 
</P>
<P>
"It can't be stopped," he said. "What do people want? Nothing but justice -- 
and that we should be better off than we are. And we want it all to take place 
in calm, without any repression, in a reasonable manner." 
</P>
<P>
A week after police brutally suppressed a student march in Prague -- the Nov. 
17 incident that triggered the rapid political changes -- local party leaders 
were still saying the action was justified, even though the central authorities 
had long since backed down. 
</P>
<P>
Engineer Bohomil and his wife, Bozena, worry about a possible backlash. She 
said their college-age son called her a "reactionary" when she warned that he 
might risk being thrown out of school for his activism. "He said that it was no 
wonder we lost in 1968, if that's how cautious we were," Bozena said in a 
blushing reference to the ill-fated Prague Spring reform movement 21 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him he might see it differently, too, if there were a tank facing him," 
Bohomil added. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, youthful exuberance won out. Their son was among throngs chanting 
"Come out!" as they marched to party headquarters at a protest last week. 
</P>
<P>
When he got back to their apartment that day, Bozena recalled, her son flung 
open the door and shouted gleefully: "Mom! I welcome you to free 
Czechoslovakia!"

EDEN PASTORA RETURNS FOR NICARAGUA VOTE 
</P>

MANAGUA, Nicaragua 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eden Pastora, the revolutionary hero who later took up arms against Nicaragua's 
left-wing Sandinista government, returned home Sunday after eight years of 
exile and condemned the leftist government and the U.S.-backed opposition. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 2,000 welcomed Pastora at a rally outside the National Palace, which 
he had captured with a squad of Sandinista troops in one of the most famous 
exploits of the 1979 war against former dictator Anastasio Somoza. 
</P>
<P>
Pastora, known as "Commander Zero," has returned to campaign for the Social 
Christian Party, a centrist alternative to the two main contenders in next 
February's elections, the Sandinista Front and the National Opposition Union, a 
coalition dominated by the right wing. 
</P>
<P>
The official campaign for the elections opens today. 
</P>
<P>
Pastora, 52, said the Social Christians, with whom he has aligned himself for 
the Feb. 25 elections, are the true followers of Nicaraguan nationalist hero 
Augusto Cesar Sandino. 
</P>
<P>
"We are anti-imperialist with Moscow, and we are anti-imperialist with 
Washington," Pastora told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
He called for creation of a government independent of Soviet and U.S. 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
"I propose a third type of government . . . without the influence of Soviet 
tanks or dollars from the United States," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pastora, who is not a candidate for any office, was one of the most respected 
Sandinista guerrilla commanders. But, two years after the 1979 revolution, he 
fled to Costa Rica and took up arms against his former colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
After he refused to merge his fighters with U.S.-backed Contras operating from 
Honduras in 1984, Pastora was cut off from U.S. funds and eventually gave up 
his armed struggle in 1986.

HEAVY SNOWFALL, COLD PLAGUING MUCH OF NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Up to 18 inches of snow fell Sunday over parts of the Northeast, and cold air 
covered much of the nation east of the Rockies, with highs only in the teens 
from Minnesota to northern New England. 
</P>
<P>
A storm centered off Maine dumped heavy snow over much of the state, and high 
wind in the wake of the storm produced squalls with heavy snow in the Great 
Lakes region. 
</P>
<P>
Southern and central Maine got 6 to 14 inches of snow from late Saturday into 
Sunday, while snow squalls in the lower Great Lakes region buried parts of 
western New York state, with 18 inches in the town of West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 8 inches of snow blanketed Vermont from Saturday into Sunday, and totals 
along the northern and western lake shores of Michigan ranged up to 13 inches. 
In northern Indiana, up to 13 inches fell at Michiana, and up to a foot fell 
along the Lake Erie shore in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Strong, gusty wind accompanied the snow in the Northeast, causing considerable 
blowing and drifting and producing wind-chill readings well below zero. 
</P>
<P>
Overnight temperatures in the teens forced Chicago's homeless to seek the 827 
beds in 17 warming centers. A shelter program spokesman said one or two more 
centers would be opened. 
</P>
<P>
Low temperatures early Sunday dipped into the teens and single digits from the 
northern and central High Plains through the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes to 
northern New England.

AMERICAN ALBUM: BUSINESS IS BUBBLING AGAIN AS LITHIUM-WATER DRINKERS SWEAR BY 
ITS HEALING POWERS.

LITHIA SPRINGS, Ga. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People are once again bringing their hopes, dreams and illnesses to this little 
community, seeking fulfillment and cure in the spring water that long ago was 
medicine and thirst-quencher for Cherokees. 
</P>
<P>
The water, laden with minerals and generations of lore, reputedly can treat 
manic-depression, alcoholism, heart trouble and kidney problems. It also has 
been hailed as an aphrodisiac, leading to its nickname of "love water." 
</P>
<P>
Such claims helped overcome a slightly alkaline taste and created a boom in 
bottled lithium water over a century ago. The only lithium springs in the 
United States spawned a resort, including a golf course and the sumptuous 
Sweetwater Park Hotel, that drew the rich and ill in droves. 
</P>
<P>
Hard times soon hit. The hotel burned down in 1912. The federal Food and Drug 
Administration banned the extravagant advertising claims. Public enthusiasm for 
lithia water began to wane, and by the 1940s bottling ceased. 
</P>
<P>
But business is bubbling again here. In 1983, history aficionado Gleda James, 
along with other investors, bought the springs and resumed bottling. Mineral 
water sales -- now the fastest growing segment in the beverage industry -- were 
taking off and the Lithia Springs Water Co., benefiting from the legacy of 
those legendary claims, took off even faster. The company will double its sales 
to over a million gallons this year. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, James received a purchase order from the Philippines. And a Tokyo 
department store is displaying the water. Closer to home, the water company 
provides its product, gratis, to the Georgia Legislature, thus putting claims 
of the water's soothing powers to a severe test. 
</P>
<P>
The springs now are part of a rustic complex on a 5-acre plot about 20 miles 
west of Atlanta that also contains a small museum detailing the water's 
history, a little herb garden and a huge rock formation with Indian carvings. 
James and her partners also hope to restore the resort. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists and locals alike make their way here -- sometimes to buy the water as 
part of their effort to cure illnesses doctors are having little success 
treating, and sometimes to simply reassure themselves that the springs, like 
their memories, still exist. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Fain, visiting here recently from nearby Powder Springs, Ga., sipped 
some of the water and said: "It tastes like I remember it tasting as a child." 
</P>
<P>
The water, which flows through a rock formation into a 40-foot-deep basin, 
contains potassium, calcium, magnesium and manganese. But its distinctive 
ingredient is lithium, a light metal. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Gen Baugher said the lithium water has improved her kidney 
function and helped relieve her son's manic-depression. The water is not sold 
in California stores, but for years she has had the water shipped by the 
truckload, adding: "It's very valuable to us." 
</P>
<P>
Physicians used to hail lithium water as a healer's delight. A Congress of 
Physicians at Lithia Springs in 1887 produced a report recommending the water 
to treat, among other conditions, kidney stones, jaundice, rheumatism, 
headaches, typhoid fever, indigestion, eczema, dropsy and "diseases of delicate 
women." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors today are likely to recommend it only if you are thirsty. But lithium 
pills are prescribed for depression, and it follows, say some lithium-water 
drinkers, that the water must have some of the same properties. 
</P>
<P>
James and her son Greg, who helps operate the bottling company, are careful not 
to make claims about the water curing illnesses or putting fizz into one's sex 
life. However, they do relate stories that have been told to them by customers 
like Baugher. 
</P>
<P>
James recalled one man who "gets five gallons of water at a time. When he 
bought the first bottles, he said he had heard it was good for the prostate and 
for impotency. He said he was going to give it the acid test. He's been coming 
back for five years now." 
</P>
<P>
Jared Huburt Irwin, a 74-year-old resident of Douglasville, Ga., first drank 
lithium water as a young Army mule driver back in 1934 because it "cooled your 
thirst and gave me energy. While the other boys were drinking whiskey, I drank 
the water." 
</P>
<P>
Now ill with diabetes and bed-ridden after having a leg amputated, Irwin had 
been unable to get any of the water for a while. The other day, friends 
supplied him with some, considerably brightening his outlook. "I'm hoping it'll 
make me better," he told a visitor. "I think it will." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone takes to the water so hopefully. 
</P>
<P>
Yvette Alexander said it reminded her of water with baking soda in it. But she 
smiled when she was reminded of the water's reputed aphrodisiac qualities. 
Preparing to drive with her friend Zack Nauth from Atlanta to Baton Rouge, La., 
Alexander said: "I'll let you know what Zack does on the way home."

Two months after Hurricane Hugo ripped through St. Croix with winds in excess 
of 150 miles an hour, 80% of the island remains without electricity and 
telephones, thousands are living in severely damaged homes under roofs 
fashioned from plastic sheets, and the winter tourist season has been written 
off completely. 
</P>
<P>
But, say many residents, even tougher than rebuilding homes and lives in this 
devastated U.S. territory is rebuilding the island's image as an "American 
paradise." 
</P>
<P>
Hugo not only physically tore apart this 82-square-mile island, it also 
stripped bare its deep-seated social and racial problems. 
</P>
<P>
The storm roared in after dark on Sept. 17, bringing wall-to-wall destruction. 
Trees were uprooted, tin roofs went flying, boats were piled atop each other on 
shore and glass was shattered everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
For the next two days looting was rampant. The storm severed all communications 
with the outside world, and with no lights and little evidence of local law 
enforcement on the streets, an unnerving air of anarchy descended, residents 
say. As newspapers and television spread images of people carting off 
appliances and men armed with shotguns patrolling a shopping center from the 
roof, President Bush ordered 1,100 Army troops to the island. 
</P>
<P>
Order was restored quickly. But the damage, both to the public image of the 
island as a haven for tourists, and to the private image residents had of 
themselves, had been done. 
</P>
<P>
"It just shocked me," said Everett Gumbs, a 63-year-old taxi driver. "My wife 
and I saw four men carrying a refrigerator down the street, and I said: 'What 
is this? Something's wrong.' " 
</P>
<P>
"There was racial tension here prior to Hugo (related to) an expanding gap of 
economic difference," says Jerry Garcia, 26-year-old executive director of the 
St. Croix Chamber of Commerce and a native of the island. "So the good thing 
the hurricane brought about is an awareness. The issue is now being discussed." 
</P>
<P>
The issue of race is a particularly sensitive one on this island, still haunted 
by the grisly murder 17 years ago of eight people at the Fountain Valley Golf 
Course. Five black men were charged with killing the eight, seven of whom were 
white. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hernandez, a conciliation specialist with the U.S. Justice Department's 
Community Relations Service, helped investigate the Fountain Valley case. 
"People here are still traumatized by Fountain Valley. You hear about it all 
the time," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Now Hernandez has been sent back to St. Croix to reactivate a human rights 
commission that has lain dormant for years. "St. Croix is not a powder keg," he 
says. "We're not going to see a riot here. But St. Croix -- like other U.S. 
cities -- needs some sort of mediating organization to deal with tensions." 
</P>
<P>
What's wrong in St. Croix may be no different than what's wrong in many other 
scenic Caribbean islands, where the development of tourism seems to have 
favored off-islanders with money more than the native population. Although 85% 
of the island's 56,000 residents are black, most of the businesses are owned by 
whites and other non-blacks. 
</P>
<P>
David M. Nissman, the U.S. attorney in St. Croix, says that despite the 
multi-ethnic population, "color matters less here than anywhere I've ever 
lived." But, he adds, "internal weaknesses in the Virgin Islands government and 
a school system that is a mess" have put native Crucians at a competitive 
disadvantage for jobs. "And that's a cause of tension," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the storm, that tension bubbled to the surface, Nissman 
says. Although initial reports of attacks on whites by machete-wielding gangs 
were patently untrue, "there was some violent crime, and some racial epithets 
were directed at continentals," as whites are called here, Nissman says. "And 
let's not sweep this under the rug for the sake of tourism." 
</P>
<P>
Tourism is two-thirds of the economy in the Virgin Islands -- St. Thomas, St. 
John and St. Croix -- which became an unincorporated American territory in 1917 
when the United States bought the islands from Denmark for $25 million. Last 
year, almost 2 million tourists visited -- most via one of the many cruise 
ships that stop at St. Thomas -- and spent $676 million. Visitors spent $132.8 
million last year on St. Croix. 
</P>
<P>
Positioned as they are atop the Lesser Antilles chain, just east of Puerto Rico 
and about 1,100 miles southeast of Miami, the islands are on the main line for 
hurricanes that form off the coast of Africa and head west across the open 
Atlantic. But Hugo was the first tropical cyclone to hit the Virgin Islands 
directly in 61 years. Both St. Thomas and St. John suffered considerable 
damage. But St. Croix got plastered. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the island looks like it's waking up from a hangover, still a little 
groggy, but determined to set itself right. The roads are clear, the trees are 
greening with new leaves and debris is being hauled to dump sites by the 
truckload. 
</P>
<P>
But evidence of Hugo's fury is never far from view nor out of mind. An 
island-wide curfew remains in effect from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m., and although the 
Army troops have gone, local police and National Guard forces have been 
bolstered by the arrival of 150 MPs from a Washington, D.C., National Guard 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
After its roof fell in, the island's lone hospital was condemned. Medical care 
is now dispensed by doctors and nurses working in tents set up in the parking 
lot. "We've cut down on elective surgery," administrator Lloyd K. Austin said. 
"We're just doing things that have to be done." 
</P>
<P>
In Fredericksted, the island's second city, the pier that once enabled huge 
cruise ships to tie up and disgorge tourists was blown away, and without 
visitors the town looks depressed. In the mountains that run through the center 
of the island, the once stately mahogany trees are splintered and cracked, as 
though blitzed by a firestorm. Hundreds of houses along the rugged coastline 
remain roofless or collapsed into rubble. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in the major city of Christiansted, amid the noise of hammers, saws and 
portable generators that have replaced the chatter of tourists on the narrow 
streets, there is optimism. Sailboats remain beached on some downtown streets, 
and the harbor is littered with overturned hulls, but there is a lot of hard 
work going on. 
</P>
<P>
About 750 of the island's 1,700 hotel rooms are habitable, and all are filled, 
with off-island construction workers, Red Cross and federal disaster teams, 
insurance adjusters and 450 linemen sent from power companies in six states. 
There are not many tourists here, and no one is expecting them back soon. The 
Virgin Islands government recently spent $600,000 to promote the winter season, 
which begins Dec. 15, and did not even mention St. Croix. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not ready for tourists yet," says Charlie Martin, executive director of 
the St. Croix Hotel Assn. 
</P>
<P>
While food supplies are ample, businesses are reopening daily, and school has 
started up again, coping with the day-to-day routine can be a struggle. "There 
is a lot of stress here," says Jerry M. Kaiser, an expert on stress management 
flown in from Santa Cruz, Calif., to conduct workshops for schoolteachers and 
students. 
</P>
<P>
For many, daily life means filing insurance claims, applying for Small Business 
Administration loans or filling out forms at offices set up by the Red Cross or 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"In 16 years with FEMA, I've never seen a place hit so hard border to border," 
said Steven B. Singer, director of the agency's efforts here. Although only 
five persons were reported killed as a result of Hugo, Singer said most of the 
homes on the island were damaged or destroyed, and more than 95% of the power 
poles were blown down. Most residents will not have full electrical and phone 
service until spring. 
</P>
<P>
Virgin Islands Gov. Alexander Farrelly estimated total damages to the territory 
at $935 million. On St. Croix, Singer says FEMA has passed out $125 million in 
goods and materials, including 4.2 million pounds of food, and more remains to 
be done. "FEMA will have a presence here for two years," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Physical recovery seems certain. Hotels will reopen. Sid Kalmans, the owner of 
the Caravelle Hotel, hired 11 construction workers from the mainland, put them 
up in the 11 of the hotel's 43 rooms that still have roofs and set them to 
work. He plans to welcome guests again by the summer. 
</P>
<P>
But Kalmans knows that island residents have some emotional repair work to do 
as well. For two days after the storm, Kalmans walked the street in front of 
his hotel with a rifle in his hands. The weapon was unloaded, he now admits. 
But seeing shops all around him being looted, he said he was determined to 
protect his property. 
</P>
<P>
By the second day after Hugo's passage, the looters represented a broad cross 
section of St. Croix society, attested to by later arrests. Among those charged 
with grand larceny were former Virgin Islands Sen. Adelbert Bryan, a captain in 
the local police force and an unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate, alleged to 
have stolen a truckload of building material; and Michael Harris, the owner of 
a popular Christiansted cafe, who allegedly stole foodstuffs from a 
competitor's shop to resell in his own. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents are convinced that St. Croix will emerge stronger for the 
tribulations Hugo has posed. Kalmans said he thinks "those few days after the 
storm, when things were crazy, brought people together. We started a community 
watch program to look out for each other."

Hugo ripped through St. Croix with 150 m.p.h. winds, 80% of the island remains 
without electricity and telephones, thousands are living in severely damaged

Even tougher, according to many residents, will be rebuilding the image of this 
devastated U.S. territory, left, as an "American paradise." MIKE CLARY; Map,

The parents of a 2-year-old boy left paralyzed and brain-damaged after tumbling 
into a swimming pool at an unlicensed day-care center in the Orange County 
community of North Tustin have sued the center's owners, the county and the 
state, contending that stricter regulation of the facility could have prevented 
the accident. Christy Kolbet, 40, and Derek Weston, 29, of Santa Ana, seek 
unspecified damages for the accident March 30 at the Cowan Heights home of 
Diane and Orvel Brooks. Jonathan Derek Weston and two other children fell into 
the Brooks' pool when the couple's daughter, Carol, left them unattended. A 
14-month-old boy, Arthur M. Griese, died about 24 hours after Orvel Brooks 
pulled him from the water. Another 2-year-old, Melissa Dianne Polsfoot, 
suffered permanent brain damage.

The 1989 U.S. Chess Championship, a three-week-long tournament of the nation's 
16 best players, ended in a three-way tie Sunday at the Hyatt Regency in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Grandmasters Roman Dzindzichashvili of New York, Yasser Seirawan of Seattle, 
both former champions, and the current U.S. junior champion, 20-year-old Stuart 
Rachels, of Alabama, each scored 9 1/2-5 1/2 to win $5,000 each. They will 
reign as co-champions. 
</P>
<P>
Next at 9-6 was Boris Gulko of Massachusetts. Gulko and the three champions 
will represent the United States in the Interzonals, the next stage in World 
Championship competition. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Benjamin of New York, Nick de Firmian of San Francisco and Anthony Miles 
of Seattle tied at 8 1/2-6 1/2. A playoff match not yet scheduled will 
determine which two advance to the Interzonals. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament was run by the United States Chess Federation and sponsored by 
The Software Toolworks, publisher of the Chessmaster 2000 and Chessmaster 2100 
programs.

BALLOT DRIVE SEEKS 2-TERM LIMIT ON CITY OFFICEHOLDERS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: DISCONTENT WITH GOVERNMENT FORGES GRASS-ROOTS ALLIANCE. EFFORT WOULD 
REQUIRE THE SIGNATURES OF NEARLY 205,000 REGISTERED VOTERS. 
</P>

<P>
From East Los Angeles to the harbor area to the far stretches of the San 
Fernando Valley, residents unhappy with city government are mounting an 
unprecedented campaign to change the cast of characters at Los Angeles City 
Hall by limiting elected officials to two consecutive terms. 
</P>
<P>
The grass-roots group, which began meeting this summer, started circulating 
petitions this weekend for a proposed Charter amendment that would change the 
face of city politics by opening City Hall to scores of newcomers. If 
successful, the petition drive would be the largest in city history, requiring 
the signatures of nearly 205,000 registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
Under the amendment, elected officials, who currently have no limits on their 
terms, could serve two four-year terms in a row, but would be required to sit 
out at least one term before running again for the same office. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, City Atty. James K. Hahn, Controller Rick Tuttle and 12 of 
the 15 City Council members would be blocked from running for reelection if the 
measure were approved by voters. Only Council members Richard Alatorre, Ruth 
Galanter and Nate Holden, who are serving their first full terms, could run 
again without waiting a term. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign, called L.A. City 2-Term Limit, brings together community leaders, 
unsuccessful council candidates and neighborhood activists from a melting pot 
of social and economic groups throughout the city. Organizers say it reflects a 
deeply rooted dissatisfaction with the performance of the city's elected 
officials and a belief that longevity in office breeds apathy and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign includes East Los Angeles residents upset about poor city 
services, Valley and Westside homeowners opposed to rapid growth, Hollywood 
tenants afraid of losing their homes to redevelopment, and hillside 
environmentalists threatened by congestion and urban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
The effort got its start among a handful of residents who met in a small Boyle 
Heights community church in July to thrash out the idea. They were soon joined 
by Hollywood residents, who had also been considering the idea. By September, 
meetings were drawing representatives from every corner of the city. The group 
recently rented an office in Sun Valley as its headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had a lot of cross-pollination," said David Diaz, head of the El 
Sereno Neighborhood Action Committee and an author of the amendment. "For this 
initiative to work, it is going to take networking citywide." 
</P>
<P>
Laura Lake, president of Friends of Westwood and an unsuccessful City Council 
candidate in April, said the campaign reunites a citywide coalition that first 
formed two years ago to defeat plans for a trash-to-energy incineration plant 
in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers say they have the support of more than 50 community organizations -- 
ranging from the League of Conservation Voters to the East Los Angeles Chamber 
of Commerce -- and expect to pick up scores of other endorsements now that the 
petition drive has begun. Fund-raising has been less spirited, with the group 
collecting only "several thousand dollars" toward its $500,000 goal. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in the initiative has been fueled in large part by what many residents 
perceive as the arrogance of city officials, organizers say. Residents complain 
about council members ignoring them during public hearings at City Hall, or 
dismissing their concerns and catering instead to special interests and 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
"People want respect and they are not getting it," said Barbara Blinderman, a 
land-use attorney and president of the residents' group Mulholland Tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
The movement comes at a time when term limits are being considered elsewhere as 
a means of campaign reform. Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp has proposed an 
ethics package that would limit statewide officeholders to eight years and 
members of the Legislature to 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, where a previous two-term initiative failed, residents are 
gathering signatures for another attempt, and groups in Inglewood and Santa 
Monica are also pushing for limits in their cities. The commission set up by 
Bradley to draft a new ethics code in Los Angeles is expected to recommend 
later this month that term limits be studied as part of a comprehensive review 
of the City Charter. 
</P>
<P>
Four-term incumbent Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky predicted the two-term effort 
will fail. "I don't think they have demonstrated the capability to organize a 
citywide initiative drive," said Yaroslavsky, who opposes any term limits. 
</P>
<P>
But Herbert E. Alexander, a USC political science professor who also opposes 
term limits, said publicity about Bradley's ongoing financial problems could 
give the campaign an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"I imagine a lot of people in the wake of the Bradley case will say he has been 
in office too long, he got arrogant in power, and that leads to the kind of 
failures that he exhibited," Alexander said. "I suspect it won't be hard to get 
sufficient signatures to get it on the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
The campaign, which officially began Friday when the group published its 
petition, has been shunned by the political establishment at City Hall. 
Four-term Councilwoman Joy Picus, who has publicly called for term limits in 
the past, said the two-term proposal is too restrictive. Yaroslavsky dismissed 
its organizers as a group of "primarily failed candidates who couldn't win 
elections on their own and are now trying to change the rules." 
</P>
<P>
Lake, who ran against Yaroslavsky in April, said the campaign did not originate 
among former council candidates. "This is coming from the bottom up," Lake 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, now in his fifth consecutive term as mayor, said through a spokesman 
that he would not comment on the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
As a councilman, Bradley made a similar proposal in 1973 that would have 
limited mayors to two terms. His proposal never was enacted, but two years 
later during his first term as mayor, he told the council he had "no intention" 
of serving more than two terms. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the ballot measure is successful, some question whether such limits are 
even legal in California. A court in San Francisco recently ruled that 
general-law cities -- those without charters -- cannot impose term limits, but 
the ability of charter cities such as Los Angeles to restrict terms has never 
been determined by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
The issue could eventually be resolved, if pending legal battles in two 
suburban Los Angeles charter cities wind up in court. A former Redondo Beach 
councilman who was forced to retire this year because of a two-term limit in 
that city says he will challenge the law, and a similar restriction in Cerritos 
is expected to pit two incumbents there who want to seek third terms against a 
citizens' group that says they cannot. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Los Angeles is critical right now," said Robert Nudelman, a 
Hollywood activist and initiative supporter. "The drugs, the gangs, the crime, 
the traffic, the pollution -- we can't wait any longer."

4 CATHOLIC CHURCHES DEFACED IN AIDS PROTEST; 
</P>
<P>
VANDALISM: CALLER SAYS GAY ACTIVISTS WERE ANGERED BY ARCHBISHOP ROGER MAHONY'S 
CONDEMNATION OF THE USE OF CONDOMS TO FIGHT THE DEADLY DISEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gay activists, saying they are angered by Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. 
Mahony's recent condemnation of the use of condoms to fight the spread of AIDS, 
claim they splattered bright red paint on four Los Angeles-area Roman Catholic 
churches early Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the activists -- who said he is part of a newly formed group 
called Greater Religious Responsibility! (GRR!) -- said members of the group 
also pasted posters featuring a full-face photo of Mahony on church doors. 
"Safe sex is a lie and a fraud" was printed above the picture. In larger 
letters, "MURDERER" appeared at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Roman Catholic bishops have come under fire from AIDS activists for 
overwhelmingly approving a major policy statement rejecting the use of condoms 
as a means of fighting the spread of the fatal disease. The statement was 
drafted by a committee that Mahony chaired at last month's National Conference 
of Catholic Bishops in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
In presenting the policy paper to the bishops, Mahony declared that young 
people should avoid "being trapped into the 'safe-sex' myth, which is both a 
lie and a fraud." That paraphrased statement was featured atop the posters. 
</P>
<P>
In a call to The Times on Sunday, a person who described himself as one of the 
activists and who declined to give his name, asserted that in endorsing the 
anti-condom position, the bishops committed "an immoral act." The red paint 
symbolized blood and the tragedy of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 activists were involved in the vandalism, the caller said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will probably be doing more postering around town before Christmas," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony could not be reached for comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The four vandalized churches were: Immaculate Conception Church on West 9th 
Street, part of the headquarters complex of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of 
Los Angeles; St. Basil Church, mid-Wilshire District; St. Ambrose Church, West 
Hollywood; and St. Charles Church, North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Sunday morning services had begun at the churches, much of the red 
paint had been washed off main, side and rectory doors, and several of the 
11-inch by 17-inch black-and-white Mahony posters had been scraped off. 
</P>
<P>
At St. Ambrose, however, the red paint and posters were generally left intact. 
</P>
<P>
"I left it there deliberately this morning," said the church's pastor, Father 
John A. Beattie, "as a reminder that there's still anger and prejudice and 
intolerance" in the world. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview in the church's office, Beattie noted that the vandalism 
took place on the first Sunday of Advent, the beginning of the liturgical year 
when people are looking ahead to a Christmas season of brotherhood and good 
will. 
</P>
<P>
The anonymous GRR! spokesman said that, indeed, the vandalism was timed to 
Advent "to bring more attention to it." 
</P>
<P>
Beattie, who observed that about one-third of the West Hollywood church's 
congregation is gay, said he called attention to the vandalism during his 
sermon Sunday. He said he declared that "we should ask for more understanding, 
more tolerance and more compassion of each other." 
</P>
<P>
The activists, Beattie added, may have misunderstood the message that came out 
of the bishops' conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the whole tone of the (bishops') statement was compassion," he said. 
"I think that wasn't heard, and that's unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
At St. Basil, a priest denounced the vandalism. At the same time, though, he 
declared that Mahony's position was "not realistic" to say that, in effect, 
"you can't even give people information" about the use of condoms in the fight 
against AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The priest, who requested anonymity, pointed to red paint streaking the 
church's rectory and said, "That's not the Catholic teaching." Still, he said, 
many Catholic priests disagree with last month's anti-condom position. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a horrible struggle for us priests who are trying to be pastoral," he 
said.

Bill Stamps got moving when he received a ticket for parking outside his 
Hollywood home six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
He went to court to beat the ticket. Then he went to work to beat the system. 
</P>
<P>
Stamps formed The People for Parking Rights, a group he hopes will someday 
force Los Angeles' army of parking enforcement officers into retreat. 
</P>
<P>
"The system now is a sham," said the semi-retired plumber. "They're just 
extorting money out of citizens. They write parking tickets knowing they won't 
hold up in court. They know you won't take time to fight the ticket -- they 
count on you paying." 
</P>
<P>
That charge is denied by city parking officials, who are the traditional 
targets of motorists angered to find their cars ticketed or towed from streets 
around the city. Officials say they encourage drivers who feel they have been 
wronged to take their cases to court. Those who prefer not to take that step 
are encouraged to promptly pay their fines. 
</P>
<P>
At $13, $23, $28 and $53 a clip, thousands of motorists have done just that 
each day. And as of last week, fees in three of those categories became even 
more costly. Mayor Tom Bradley announced last Friday that bails for meter 
violations have been increased from $13 to $18, red zone violations from $28 to 
$53 and handicap zone offenses from $53 to $103. 
</P>
<P>
About 4.5 million parking violation notices will have been slapped on 
windshields in 1989 by the city's 564 gray-uniformed parking enforcement 
officers, municipal officials estimate. The city will end up collecting about 3 
million of those tickets from motorists, who will have paid about $100 million 
in fines -- bails that are legally forfeited when they opt not to show up in 
court to contest their citations. 
</P>
<P>
Recipients of about 60,000 of this year's tickets will have tried to fight 
their citations in Municipal Court, officials say. Statistics indicate that 
only about 34% of them will be winners. Many win their cases only because the 
roving parking officers who write their citations fail to appear in court to 
testify on the scheduled trial day. When that happens, tickets are 
automatically dismissed and bail money is refunded. 
</P>
<P>
That's what happened to the ticket tucked under the windshield wiper on Bill 
Stamps' 1972 Ford Falcon van one Friday morning last May. 
</P>
<P>
Because of street sweeping, parking is prohibited Thursday mornings on one side 
of Mariposa Avenue and Friday mornings on the other. Stamps said his truck was 
legally parked on the Thursday side when it was ticketed. 
</P>
<P>
Although Stamps said he has often been rankled by parking tickets, his alleged 
street-sweeping violation was particularly irksome. "I wanted to confront the 
people who accused me," he said. "I never had that opportunity. I never got my 
due process." 
</P>
<P>
The result was The People for Parking Rights. The organization has had a modest 
send-off since then. Stamps and his friends have tacked small notices to 
bulletin boards at schools and supermarkets seeking people who feel 
"victimized" by parking tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Those who call are asked to write "paid under protest" on checks sent to the 
city to cover their fines. They are instructed to send photocopies of both the 
check and the ticket to The People for Parking Rights. 
</P>
<P>
So far, about 150 drivers have done just that, Stamps said. The group has about 
30 active members who pay no dues but volunteer their services for typing and 
announcement-posting. When the group gathers 1,000 of the photocopies, Stamps 
said, he plans to approach the Los Angeles City Council to demand parking 
enforcement reforms. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, Stamps said, the fledgling organization wants an end to the 
"stacking" of parking regulation signs that cause confusion by listing 
conflicting restrictions. They also want parking officers to use official time 
stamps on tickets -- particularly those written for parking meter violations. 
Such items, Stamps said, would keep officers from writing violations before 
drivers have a chance to hurry out and feed their meters. 
</P>
<P>
The group is seeking a new system of administrative hearings instead of court 
trials for drivers who want to dispute tickets. And they want the current bail 
requirement dropped, with drivers released on their own recognizance -- without 
paying fines -- while they protest their citations. 
</P>
<P>
Parking officials say all of those demands are either unnecessary or 
unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
Robert R. Yates, the city's parking administrator, who has listened to more 
than his share of grumbling from irate drivers, said he has never heard of The 
People for Parking Rights. He disputed suggestions that parking enforcement 
procedures need to be overhauled. 
</P>
<P>
Yates said the city Department of Transportation already uses administrative 
hearings to referee some parking disputes. He said the city has also set up 
three locations where drivers can be relieved from paying bail by signing a 
form promising to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
According to Yates, no synchronized and non-adjustable portable time stamp 
exists that could be used on current ticket forms. But he said his officers may 
soon test an electronic ticket writer that will print out the time, along with 
other details of alleged infractions, on a computerized citation. 
</P>
<P>
Yates acknowledged that seemingly contradictory parking signs posted on some 
streets can be confusing. But there is no way, he said, to list such things as 
street sweeping times, tow-away warnings or special neighborhood parking 
restrictions on a single sign. 
</P>
<P>
Stamps said that additional parking enforcement changes will be proposed as his 
organization grows. Members predict there will be no shortage of suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles taxi driver Larry Shorts is upset that cabbies receive $53 tickets 
for discharging passengers in a rush hour no-stopping zone in front of the 
downtown Greyhound bus station. He said it is dangerous to make fares walk any 
distance along Skid Row with their luggage. 
</P>
<P>
A similar case, heard last week at the Los Angeles Traffic Court on South Hill 
Street, showed just how far parking enforcement officials and aggrieved 
motorists may have to go before they make peace. 
</P>
<P>
The parking squabble started on the street next to the Hollywood Bowl four 
months ago, ending last Wednesday in a hallway next to the courthouse elevator 
after limousine driver Dayna Campo was found guilty of stopping in a 
no-stopping zone on Highland Avenue by Acting Judge Douglas W. Weitzman. 
</P>
<P>
In court, Campo, a Torrance resident, asserted that she was traveling about 1 
m.p.h. outside a Rod Stewart concert when parking enforcement Officer Jerry 
Dodd improperly ticketed her July 31. Dodd argued that Campo was stopped among 
a cluster of double-parked limos on the street. 
</P>
<P>
After Weitzman assessed a reduced fine of $28 and promised that the rest of 
Campo's $53 bail would be refunded, the two left the courtroom, continuing 
their debate by the elevator. 
</P>
<P>
They both got in the last word as they climbed into separate elevators. 
</P>
<P>
"I was moving," said Campo. "She was stopped," said Dodd.

Americans will smoke fewer cigarettes this year than in any year since 1942, 
according to a projection by an economist at the Agriculture Department, which 
oversees tobacco growing in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Per capita cigarette consumption is expected to fall to 2,936 pieces in 1989 
from 3,096 in 1988, versus 2,585 in 1942, Verner Grise, an economist at the 
department, said at an agricultural outlook conference last week. 
</P>
<P>
"This would be the lowest since 1942 and 32% below the 1963 peak," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Grise predicted that cigarette consumption may fall an average 2% to 3% a year 
over the next several years. He said wholesale price increases for cigarettes, 
prospects for higher taxes, increased smoking restrictions and other 
anti-smoking activities could contribute to further drops in the U.S. rate of 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Grise said smokers have been limited sharply recently because 42 states now 
either prohibit smoking in certain places or segregate smokers and nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
Although cigarette use is declining or stagnant in the United States and in 
Western Europe, Canada and Japan, increased consumption in populous China would 
keep world output up, Grise said. Last year China produced 1.53 trillion 
cigarettes.

Women doctors on medical school faculties often feel held back by the 
responsibilities of raising children, although most are happy with their 
careers, according to a survey. 
</P>
<P>
Women make up 19% of medical school faculties nationwide -- up from 13% two 
decades ago -- although they have been slow to crack the top ranks of the 
academic world. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of 558 of these women, all under age 50, found that nearly two-thirds 
had children. About half of those had delayed starting families until they were 
in their early 30s and had finished medical training. 
</P>
<P>
Although the majority said they were satisfied with their careers and the 
decision to have children, 78% felt that their families had slowed their job 
advancement. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that it is possible for women to combine motherhood with a 
fulfilling career in academic medicine, but it is difficult, and most such 
women believe that motherhood slows the progress of their careers," the 
researchers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by Drs. Wendy Levinson and Susan W. Tolle of Oregon 
Health Sciences University and Charles Lewis of UCLA. The results were 
published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

MIKE DOWNEY: SHANAHAN SEES LIFE FROM BOTH SIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Shanahan's Raiders defeated Mike Shanahan's Denver Broncos, 16-13, in 
overtime Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't head coach of either side anymore. He coordinates Denver's offense, 
that's all. Yet, every man on the Coliseum field had played football for Mike 
Shanahan, in one capacity or the other. To no one on either sideline -- with 
the possible exception of Wayne Gretzky, who stood beside the Raiders -- was 
Shanahan a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he clearly seemed an outsider, certainly must have felt like an 
outsider, definitely was treated like an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
He ducked into an office that once was his. 
</P>
<P>
"Congratulations," he said to the current occupant, Art Shell, shaking his 
hand, then ducking out again. 
</P>
<P>
Didn't stay too long. Didn't want to seem unseemly. This was somebody else's 
place of business now, somebody else's place to digest victories and dissect 
losses. Shanahan didn't want to poke his nose where it no longer belonged. He 
just didn't want to be impolite. Didn't want to be graceless in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Back he went into Denver's dressing room, to change into a coat and tie. He had 
just acted the part of a perfect gentleman; now he looked like one. 
</P>
<P>
When he emerged, familiar faces were waiting. There was Jay Schroeder, the 
starting quarterback for all four of the Raider games Shanahan coached in 1989 
before being fired. There was Alex Gibbs, his old offensive line coach, the one 
he imported from Denver to instruct the Raiders in the art of protecting the 
quarterback. There was Pete Rodriguez, his old special-teams coach. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody else dropped by. That was it. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan understood. He knew that the Raiders were so busy celebrating success, 
so busy discussing it, that they were too distracted to think about dropping 
by. A few had said hello beforehand. More than a few had not. Maybe some felt 
awkward, or maybe some by now could hardly remember his name. Since Shanahan 
watched the game from the press box, there was no chance of contact while the 
game was in progress. 
</P>
<P>
It had to be a weird experience, an emotional experience, watching one's own 
team play one's old team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be lying if I said it wasn't," Shanahan said. "But, life goes on." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders were 1-3 under Shanahan. They are 6-3 for Shell. There is a message 
there somewhere. Either they got off to a false start, or they didn't care to 
play for Shanahan, or they have responded specifically to Shell, or they didn't 
have certain people available when Shanahan was coaching, or Shanahan spent too 
much time using the wrong people. 
</P>
<P>
Something. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders have a 3-1 record, for example, with Steve Beuerlein as starting 
quarterback. Shanahan preferred Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan also phased out the use of the tight end in the Raider passing scheme. 
He phased out Todd Christensen, a semi-legend, in the process. 
</P>
<P>
So, who beat Shanahan's Broncos on Sunday? Tight end Mike Dyal did with a 
67-yard touchdown catch that led to overtime. He did it with leaping catches of 
passes spanning 26 and 15 yards that set up Jeff Jaeger's game-winning field 
goal. These plays weren't total coincidences; this wasn't Dyal-a-Prayer. Shell 
and Beuerlein make use of the tight end's hands; he's not just a blocker. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan swore he always liked Dyal's hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Mike Dyal was a coming player. Everybody knew Mike Dyal was a coming 
player," Shanahan said. "What he did didn't surprise me a bit. Mike Dyal's 
going to be in this league a long time. He's a very unselfish young man who 
helps the running game as much as he does the passing game, and he's only going 
to improve each week he plays." 
</P>
<P>
One had to wonder, then, if all this be true, why the Raiders never went to 
this unselfish young man before. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I don't think there was any question that Mike Dyal could make plays like 
this," Shanahan said. "The only question was when he would." 
</P>
<P>
This is what is known as a diplomatic answer, a non-answer answer, a perfect 
gentleman's answer. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan didn't have the answers. If he'd had, he might still be coaching the 
Raiders on the field instead of helping Denver in the press box. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he and the Broncos have a 10-3 record and a shot at another 
Super Bowl, their third in four seasons. The Raiders are 7-6 and still trying 
to pull themselves out of the hole that he helped dig. 
</P>
<P>
Where either team is headed, Shanahan hasn't a clue. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is, I wish everybody on that team well, everybody in Los Angeles 
well," he said, gracious as ever. "Who knows when we'll meet again?" 
</P>
<P>
He is not the enemy. He's just looked at life from both sides now. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Raiders are Raiders, and Broncos are Broncos. Leaving the stadium, 
Shanahan escorted his two small daughters, who wore Bronco T-shirts. A security 
guard stayed by his side. 
</P>
<P>
Raider fans were lined on each side, with only fences and sawhorses separating 
them from the coach. 
</P>
<P>
And they booed him. They booed him loudly, lustily. They booed Mike Shanahan, 
who never did a single thing to hurt the Los Angeles Raiders, except coach 
them.

PREP TEAM IS LEFT TO ASSESS DAMAGES AFTER REFEREE'S CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A Southern Section Division II football playoff game on Saturday night at Santa 
Barbara High has left Canyon Country Canyon on the short end of a controversial 
call by the officials, the receiving end of a bill for damages to the visiting 
locker room and apparently without recourse to overturn Santa Barbara's 28-27 
overtime victory. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon coaches, claiming that game officials awarded Santa Barbara a "fifth 
down" after time had expired in the Division II semifinal, said that they will 
file a protest with the Southern Section office today. Commissioner Stan 
Thomas, however, said that the victory would not be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
"There is (an appeals) process that can be acknowledged for ineligible 
players," Thomas said. "But there are no appeals to the mechanics of 
officiating. I know that Canyon is very upset -- and probably rightfully so. 
But, unfortunately, it's a dead issue." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas declined to comment on the game's officiating. 
</P>
<P>
With 10 seconds remaining in regulation and Santa Barbara, trailing, 21-14, 
quarterback Poncho Renteria fumbled the snap from center on fourth down at the 
Canyon one-yard line. A late flag was thrown, however, and Canyon was ruled 
offside. 
</P>
<P>
With four seconds to play, officials spotted the ball at the one-foot line. 
Time expired, however, before Santa Barbara could get off a play. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon players celebrated, but the officials, ruling that the clock should have 
remained stopped, awarded Santa Barbara another play. Renteria then passed to 
wide receiver Derek Elbert for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams scored a touchdown in overtime, but the game ended when Canyon 
kicker Chris Wilson missed the point after. 
</P>
<P>
National High School Federation rules state that the clock should be started 
after yardage is assessed on a dead-ball foul. 
</P>
<P>
"If I interpret the rules correctly then the game should have been over," 
Canyon Coach Harry Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon players and coaches left the field in a rage. Afterward, in the Canyon 
locker room, Santa Barbara coaches found two broken doors, a broken trophy 
case, a broken blackboard and a broken drinking fountain. Coach Lito Garcia 
said that a repair bill would be sent to Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Welch said that Canyon would pay for the damage, but added that the situation 
was aggravated by Santa Barbara players and fans, who allegedly followed Canyon 
players into the locker room and challenged them. Canyon players and families, 
Welch said, also were harassed as they boarded their buses.

ENERGY: THE SAN FRANCISCO OIL FIRM'S PERFORMANCE LAGS BEHIND THAT OF NEARLY ALL 
ITS BIG RIVALS, LEAVING ITS STOCK UNDERVALUED AND THE COMPANY VULNERABLE TO A 
TAKEOVER. ANALYSTS ARE WATCHING CHAIRMAN KENNETH DERR'S EFFORTS TO TURN THE 
COMPANY AROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was 1984, the year when much of the world's attention was focused on Olympic 
achievements in Los Angeles. In San Francisco, Kenneth T. Derr faced an 
Olympian task of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Derr -- then president of Chevron Corp.'s domestic unit -- was given the job of 
merging Chevron's immense operations with those of Gulf Oil after his company's 
$13-billion takeover of Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The plain-spoken man, who had made his mark early on as a bright, ambitious 
executive, admits now that he did not know where to begin. "I went home after I 
got the job, and I took a whole yellow pad . . . and said, 'I'm going to write 
down how the hell to go about this,' " he said in an interview last week. "I 
sat there for two hours looking out the window and hadn't written a thing down, 
and I probably went out and played golf." 
</P>
<P>
The uncharacteristic indecision lasted only briefly, however, and in the end, 
Derr rose to the occasion. He and his Gulf counterpart, James Murdy, devised a 
method that relied on advice from 37 employee study teams to restructure the 
two companies into one, methodically eliminating 20,000 jobs and selling off 
about $5.4 billion in assets to cut debt from the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the relative speed and smoothness with which Derr and his team 
accomplished the task won widespread praise. And the merger propelled Derr to 
the top of the company -- first as vice chairman, then last January as the 
company's 10th chairman and chief executive, replacing George Keller. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the 6-foot-3 oilman faces an even stiffer challenge: restoring luster to 
the nation's third-largest oil company, whose financial performance lags behind 
that of nearly all its major competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco-based company's condition has left its stock undervalued and 
the company vulnerable to a takeover or forced restructuring, analysts say. 
Rumors to that effect have spurred heavy trading of Chevron stock in the past 
several weeks, driving the stock to new highs -- although the price is still 
below where it should be, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Derr, normally anything but shy about speaking his mind, will not comment on 
the stock market activity. But in the past year he has taken steps to deal with 
Chevron's underlying problems. He has vowed to improve efficiency, cut costs, 
widen margins and increase the return to shareholders -- including dividends 
and capital gains -- to 15% from 8% through 1993. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, he has decentralized decision making and raised the 
accountability of Chevron business units -- bringing to the traditionally 
bureaucratic corporate culture a new participatory management style, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In a move typical of the company's new aggressiveness, Derr last week ordered 
the creation of a stock repurchase program and an employee stock ownership plan 
-- which creates a solid defense against takeovers with a novel use of a 
Delaware law. Chevron is incorporated in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Company Profile 
</P>
<P>
Can the 53-year-old Derr manage a turnaround? "That's the question mark," said 
Frederick P. Leuffer, a senior oil analyst with the C. J. Lawrence, Morgan 
Grenfell Inc. investment firm in New York and author of a report that strongly 
criticizes Chevron's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Their strategy and goals are very admirable: to take the company from a 
lackluster performer, improve financial results and returns to shareholders, 
and make it one of the best operating concerns," Leuffer said. "That's great, 
but I'm not sure how they're going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Chevron remains impressive in size. With $34.5 billion in assets, it is the 
third-largest oil company in the country after Exxon Corp. and Mobil Oil Corp. 
In terms of reserves and market capitalization (the market price of its stock 
times the number of outstanding shares), it is the sixth-largest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
In some areas, Chevron is unrivaled: It is the nation's largest refiner, 
natural gas producer and wholesale marketer of natural gas liquids. 
</P>
<P>
Its total oil and gas reserves remain strong, although they have declined in 
the past four years, positioning the company for improvement should crude and 
gas prices turn up as hoped in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
And its balance sheet is healthy, with $15.2 billion in equity and only $6.8 
billion in long-term debt at the end of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But by other measures, Chevron is ailing: 
</P>
<P>
* From 1984 to 1988, Chevron's 10.8% average return on equity lagged behind 
those of six major oil companies, according to Leuffer's report. Its 7% average 
return on capital trailed that of five competitors, the report added. 
</P>
<P>
* Of seven major oil companies, Chevron exceeded only Texaco in profitability 
from its refining and marketing operations from 1986 to 1988, according to 
Chevron's own calculations. 
</P>
<P>
* Chevron spent more than any of the other seven oil companies to find and 
produce a barrel of oil in the United States in 1988: $6.18, compared to $5.67 
for the next highest, Mobil, said Ray E. Galvin, head of Chevron's domestic 
exploration and production operations. Worldwide in the past five years, 
Chevron's cost of finding and developing new gas and oil reserves, excluding 
acquisitions, has been among the highest, Leuffer said. 
</P>
<P>
* For the first nine months of 1989, Chevron's net income was $1.1 billion, 
down from $1.6 billion in the 1988 period. Total revenue was $23.9 billion, up 
from $22 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some of Chevron's most valuable domestic oil and gas properties 
remain tantalizingly out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
A sizable oil and gas reserve off Point Arguello in Southern California remains 
unproductive, despite a total $2-billion investment by Chevron and 17 other oil 
companies, as wrangling continues over the best way to transport oil from a new 
terminal near Gaviota to refineries in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The project drains about $500,000 a day in interest alone from the 18 
companies. And because the initial investments were made with the hope that 
crude oil prices would rise by 1990 to about $85 a barrel, compared to about 
$19 now, the project will lose money at least at first, even when production 
starts, Galvin said. 
</P>
<P>
In Alaska, response to the tanker Exxon Valdez oil spill has thwarted efforts 
by Chevron to drill on leases that it holds in the coastal plain of the Arctic 
National Wildlife Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
It is ironic that Derr finds himself at the helm of a troubled Chevron as a 
result of his work with the Gulf merger. Leuffer called the merger ill-timed 
because it came just before the 1986 collapse of world crude oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
Derr disputes that, arguing that the merger has left Chevron with some of its 
most valuable assets. But he and other executives freely admit that much of 
what Chevron is doing is intended to catch up with its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"We perhaps were a little diverted from some activities of improving 
efficiencies in our companies because we were trying to bring them together," 
Derr said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Derr's Style 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Chevron's problems, Derr himself gets high marks from analysts. A 
native of Pennsylvania, Derr graduated from Cornell University with degrees in 
engineering and business and joined Chevron, in part, so that he and his new 
wife could move to California. 
</P>
<P>
At age 34, he was named assistant to then-Chairman Harold J. Haynes, who became 
a mentor. At 36, Derr became the youngest corporate vice president in company 
history in 1972. Seven years later, he was named president of the company's 
domestic operating unit, Chevron U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
To each of his jobs, the 225-pound executive brought a refreshing affability, 
colleagues said. While awaiting the transfer of nearly $2 billion that would 
clinch the sale of Gulf's Canadian unit in 1985, Derr put everyone at ease by 
organizing a penny-pitching game in a Toronto boardroom. 
</P>
<P>
"Ken's a friendly guy," said Murdy, the former Gulf chief financial officer who 
worked with Derr to merge the two companies. "But I wouldn't confuse his 
(appearance) with the get-up-and-go in him. . . . He's a very confident, able 
person." 
</P>
<P>
D. W. (Darry) Callahan, president of Chevron's Warren Petroleum unit, recalled 
that Derr could turn the charm on and off during particularly tense 
negotiations with a Dutch company in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Ken knew when he could push a little further and when it was time to back 
off," said Callahan, who was a staff analyst in the talks at the time. "It was 
like a poker game, where you have to know when to keep on your poker face and 
when to put on the big smile." 
</P>
<P>
During the Gulf merger, Derr showed an ability to delegate by farming out the 
initial analysis to study teams. The resulting reports ended up stacked several 
feet high on every flat space in Derr's office. 
</P>
<P>
But Derr was not afraid to make tough decisions, even if that meant selling off 
assets or eliminating jobs to make the merger work, analysts said. During that 
time, Chevron divested itself of its East Coast refining and marketing 
operations and its European units, while pursuing an aggressive program of 
buying oil and gas assets that culminated in the purchase of Tenneco's oil and 
gas reserves last year for $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
It is that ability to manage assets that could help Chevron now. 
</P>
<P>
"Mainly, what he has to do is decide what to do with a lot of non-performing 
assets," said Rosario (Sal) Ilacqua, an industry analyst with Nikko Securities 
Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5-Year Goals 
</P>
<P>
Chevron U.S.A. plans to spend more than $700 million on 15 projects in the next 
five years to upgrade refineries and improve yields of gasoline over less 
profitable products, said David R. Hoyer, head of Chevron's domestic refining, 
marketing and supply operations. An additional $1 billion is to be spent to 
upgrade the Richmond, Calif., refinery, he added. 
</P>
<P>
On the marketing end, the company plans to spend $1.2 billion to build new 
service stations and modernize old ones, while closing unprofitable locations 
to reduce the total number of company-owned stations to 2,500 from 3,500. 
</P>
<P>
All of which is aimed at improving U.S. earnings by $1 a barrel of refined 
product, Hoyer said, up from the current $1.20 to $1.28 per barrel. 
</P>
<P>
On the exploration and production side, Galvin said Chevron U.S.A. will 
identify and sell off marginal oil and gas properties. Next year, Chevron 
U.S.A. should dispose of $300 million to $400 million in such assets in an 
effort to reduce costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The five-year goal is to raise the domestic exploration and production unit's 
return on capital to 12% or 15% from the current 4%. 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts argue that Chevron's programs do not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
Leuffer suggested that Chevron concentrate on its production side and consider 
selling its five West Coast refineries -- including the ones in El Segundo and 
Richmond -- as well as its network of service stations. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Atlantic Richfield Co., which has carved a niche as a cut-price 
marketer, or Unocal Corp., which has an image for upscale service, Chevron has 
tried to be all things to all people and has lost market share to the others, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
British Petroleum, which has sizable oil production in Alaska but no West Coast 
refining or marketing, would be the logical buyer of such valuable assets. 
</P>
<P>
But Derr dismisses such suggestions with annoyance. "Everyone who's a security 
analyst or writes for a newspaper knows what the hell we ought to sell," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Leuffer's) an idiot if he suggests that," he added. "The West Coast 
is the most profitable refining and marketing asset our company has. . . . 
Sure, BP'd probably give their eye teeth to (buy) it, but it's one of the most 
important single assets this company has." 
</P>
<P>
The attention on Chevron's condition has fueled rumors that an outsider may try 
to force the company to restructure, or might even launch a takeover. Pennzoil 
Co., with cash from its settlement with Texaco Inc. in the battle for Getty Oil 
Co., is the most discussed possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts discount the possibility that tiny Pennzoil could muster the $35 
billion that would probably be needed for such a bid, which would be the 
largest corporate takeover in history. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the employee stock ownership plan and the repurchase program 
announced last week would raise the amount of stock in presumably friendly 
employee hands -- a common defensive tactic. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual twist in Chevron's plan is that it would use stock in the 
relatively small employee ownership plan to supplement the 11% of stock held by 
other employee benefit plans, in effect raising the total held by employees to 
16%, said Joseph R. Blasi, a professor at the institute of management and labor 
relations at Rutgers University in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron could then use stock in all of the plans to meet the requirements of a 
Delaware law that allows holders of 15% of a corporation's stock to block a 
takeover, Blasi said. 
</P>
<P>
"Chevron has clearly discovered something here, to obtain the Delaware defense 
without setting up a huge employee stock ownership plan," Blasi said. "It's 
likely to influence the future takeover defenses of a lot of public companies." 
</P>
<P>
Derr will not talk about any defensive aspects of the plan, arguing that the 
company had been planning the employee stock ownership program for months to 
take advantage of tax benefits. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said with raised eyebrows and a shrug: "If there's some other benefits, 
whatever they might be, well that's OK."

FOOTNOTES: COST CUTTING, JAPANESE-STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Capital Associates Inc., a lessor and remarketer of high-tech equipment, has 
taken a lesson from the Japanese. The company, whose major division is in 
Redondo Beach, has been doing business with the Japanese for years and recently 
entered a joint venture with Central Leasing Co. and Nippon Investment &amp; 
Finance Co. in Tokyo. It saw the price of its stock drop 20% after it posted 
lower-than-expected earnings. 
</P>
<P>
But Chairman Richard Kazan says that instead of taking the usual cost-cutting 
step of layoffs, CAI opted for a long-term perspective. "The Japanese have 
influenced us," he said. "They take a long-term look at everything, and they 
have respect for their employees." 
</P>
<P>
To cut costs, the company asked employees earning more than $50,000 a year to 
contribute a percentage back to the company in return for stock options. That 
move alone has saved CAI 15% of overhead, or $3 million, Kazan said. He added 
that the move is also taking advantage of Wall Street's reaction to the 
company's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
"We've learned a great deal from the Japanese," he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lining Up for 4 1/2-Year Wait 
</P>
<P>
If you're tired of waiting in lines, well, stand in line to file your 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
The typical American will spend about 4 1/2 years of his or her life waiting in 
lines -- with supermarkets and banks as the primary offenders, reports Robert 
Brain Associates, a New York sales production firm. Other key sources of line 
aggravation are post offices, airline counters, department stores and movie 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"We are finding out that 'fast food' and 'express line' are contradictions in 
terms," said Sandleman, who surveyed 1,000 Americans in eight cities. "The 
ultimate solution is to do away with lines," Sandleman said, "but since that 
will never happen, we need to find ways to make time pass more quickly."

Suit Trade-Ins Help Homeless 
</P>
<P>
As the holidays draw near, a downtown discount men's clothier has come up with 
a way to inject some charity into the annual shopping orgy. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Stewart, a retailer in the garment district's Cooper Building, is giving 
customers a $50 discount for each used suit that they bring in and a $30 
discount for each used sport coat. The used clothing will be donated to the Los 
Angeles Mission for the homeless, said Malik Khan, buyer-manager of the store. 
</P>
<P>
The response so far has been "phenomenal," and the store has taken in several 
used brand-name and designer suits, Khan said. "Hopefully, we'll have a very 
well-dressed Skid Row," he added.

Pay-Per-View Firm Seeks to Protect Fight Telecast: The company that is 
distributing the broadcast of the Dec. 7 middleweight championship fight 
between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran filed suit Wednesday in U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles to prevent bars and restaurants from broadcasting 
the fight without having paid the closed-circuit fee. The suit is designed to 
protect the salability of the broadcast, said Philip Deitch, attorney for 
Independent Entertainment Group Inc., a Colorado company that owns the closed

SEC Wins Judgment Against Burbank Company: The Securities and Exchange 
Commission won a judgment against Richard "R. G." Reynolds Enterprises Inc., a 
former Burbank investment advisory firm, accused of violating securities laws 
by taking $4 million from 400 investors. All or nearly all the proceeds from 
Reynolds investment programs went into one bank account controlled by Reynolds 
and was not invested. Acting on a motion by the SEC, U.S. District Judge A. 
Andrew Hauk ruled in Los Angeles that Reynolds had violated securities laws and 
ordered an accounting of the money Reynolds took in. Reynolds' attorney, Jenny 
Scovis, predicted that the decision would be overturned on appeal. (Filed April 
12, 1988., Case No. CV-88-01978 AAH)

The island nation's free-port status provides easy entry for goods, fake or 
legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
"When one illicit operation closes down, another crops up," said Mei Ying, 
regional marketing manager for Elizabeth Arden and Parfumes Lagerfeld. "Even 
more discouraging is the producers are becoming so proficient the smells are 
not far off." 
</P>
<P>
Fed up with imitations taking sales away from such coveted fragrances as Opium, 
Paris and Rive Gauche, Kerlau said the bottles smashed by the pile driver had a 
street value of $250,000 and were destined for the Middle East, Africa and 
other parts of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Investigations are continuing into other counterfeiting syndicates suspected of 
operating out of Singapore, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not take the issue of counterfeiting lightly," Kerlau said. "We are on a 
constant alert to stamp out such illegal activities, which are damaging our 
market reputation and trademark." 
</P>
<P>
Perfumes and cosmetics, which account for 88% of the group's sales, are the 
biggest money earners for Yves Saint Laurent. Kerlau said counterfeiters are 
responsible for a loss of 15% of the annual worldwide turnover, which totals 
$3.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"Ironically, if your brand is not a target for counterfeiters, then it's not a 
success," said Linda Seet, product manager for Hagemeyer Marketing, agent for 
Christian Dior. 
</P>
<P>
While fans of Christian Dior products know they can be obtained only at top 
stores at commanding prices, Seet said the consumer who has longed to purchase 
a fragrance like Poison but is not actually familiar with it is the most 
vulnerable and the most likely to end up with a fake. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest giveaway is the price," Seet said. "If you are browsing around a 
flea market instead of a prestigious establishment and are offered a bargain 
that is 40% to 60% off the normal price, it's a fake." 
</P>
<P>
The job of tracking down the counterfeiters has become the domain of private 
investigators, super sleuths with police backgrounds hired by the legitimate 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"Our worldwide strategy now includes a full-time, in-house private investigator 
to ensure that counterfeiting of our products is kept in check," Kerlau said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigations, however, usually are lengthy affairs, requiring patience and 
the stamina to follow one lead after another. 
</P>
<P>
Lionel Chee, a retired assistant police commissioner who heads Lionel Security 
Systems and Services, acknowledged that perfume cases can be frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
Weighed against the potential for huge profits, Chee blamed the proliferation 
of counterfeiters on "chicken feed" penalties. Under Singapore's trademarks 
law, importation, sales or possession for sale of items with counterfeit 
trademarks is penalized by a $1,000 maximum fine, a jail term of up to a year 
or both.

CHINA TRAVEL SAFE AGAIN, OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A railroad worker who rose to become a high-ranking Chinese tourism official 
hopes to patch his country's tattered image in the wake of the violent 
crackdown on student protesters in Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
"China needs to understand the world and the world needs to understand China," 
said Xi Zhenhuan, deputy general manager of China Swan International Tours of 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Xi, who carries a generous supply of lapel pins of the crossed flags of China 
and the United States, said the Chinese are becoming increasingly aware of the 
power that their country carries. 
</P>
<P>
"A country of more than 1 billion people has to do something for the world," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Travel is a very good way for people to understand one another and develop 
social contacts," said Xi, flashing a broad smile. "I have friends all over the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
Xi has been working to open China up to foreign tourists for more than a 
quarter century, long before the first Americans were allowed behind what was 
then called the Bamboo Curtain. 
</P>
<P>
Xi, 57, came to California to appear at half a dozen seminars organized by an 
American travel wholesaler, World Travel Consultants Inc. of Glendale. Speaking 
through a translator, he assured the audiences of retail travel agents that the 
climate in China has calmed and that foreigners are welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists have been able to do pretty much as they please since "the June 4 
incident," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Xi is China's highest-level travel industry official to be dispatched to the 
United States since students and others demanding democratic reforms were shot 
and killed in Beijing and other cities this past summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that tourists have had any problems since (the crackdown)," Xi 
said.

* Roots: For the first time since his family fled the Nazis in 1933, Sen. Rudy 
Boschwitz (D-Minn.) will return to Germany next spring to look for his East 
Berlin birthplace. Boschwitz, who was 2 years old when his Jewish family left 
Germany, knows the address of his home but doesn't remember the structure. 
"When he was sitting watching television pictures from Berlin and East Germany 
. . . he felt the real urge to go back" for the first time, said press aide Tim 
Droogsma. 
</P>
<P>
* Party time: Kendall Truitt, a gunner's mate involved in the Navy 
investigation of the deadly turret explosion aboard the USS Iowa this year, and 
his wife, Carol, were to be in New York today for Penthouse magazine's party 
for its Pet of the Year, Stephanie Page. Truitt gave Penthouse an exclusive 
interview about the disaster and his friend Clayton Hartwig, who was killed in 
the blast. The Navy blames Hartwig for the disaster. Another guest will be Paul 
Janszen, who blew the whistle on Pete Rose's gambling. 
</P>
<P>
* Critical: Dith Pran, the journalist whose suffering in his native Cambodia 
was portrayed in the movie "The Killing Fields," says the United States is 
condoning a group "worse than Hitler" -- the Khmer Rouge. Americans should not 
believe they will change if returned to power in Cambodia, he told college 
students in Galloway Township, N.J., adding, "The Khmer Rouge (were) worse than 
Hitler because they kill their own people and they destroy their own culture." 
</P>
<P>
* Honored: James K. Batten, chairman of Knight-Ridder Inc., has won the William 
Allen White Foundation Award for Journalistic Merit. The award is given 
annually to the journalist who most closely mirrors White in "service to 
profession and country." Batten, 53, directs an international news operation 
that publishes 29 daily newspapers.

<TEXT>
<P>
Not too long ago, Salevaa Fuauli Atisanoe, a 490-pound Samoan-American from 
Honolulu, seriously considered quitting his dream of making it big, really big, 
in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Atisanoe -- who once summed up his size by saying, "I've been big ever since I 
was small" -- would be a giant in any country. He found his niche on these 
cramped islands seven years ago in the sumo arena, where mammoth men combine 
ferocity with agility in an ancient and ritual-laden sport. 
</P>
<P>
But Atisanoe, 25, known here by his sumo name Konishiki, had to endure brutal 
hazing by his "stable" mates and shrug off occasional hate mail from xenophobic 
fans. After rising quickly through the ranks, he suffered a knee injury and 
entered a slump, losing so many bouts he was in danger of being demoted from 
his cherished status as ozeki, or champion. 
</P>
<P>
But recently, Konishiki overcame years of frustration by winning his first 
professional sumo tournament. He is the second foreigner ever to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The giant wept. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried very hard, very hard, not to cry, but I couldn't help it," Konishiki 
said after his victory Nov. 26 in the southern city of Fukuoka. Before the 
tournament, "I actually thought of retiring. But I made up my mind to make one 
more try." 
</P>
<P>
Konishiki's triumph came 17 years after Jesse Kuhaulua -- another Hawaiian 
native who wrestled as Takamiyama -- stunned the sumo world by winning one of 
the six annual grand tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush sent a message of congratulations to Konishiki, which a U.S. 
Embassy official read -- in passable Japanese -- during a nationally televised 
awards ceremony. Sponsors also showered the American athlete with various 
prizes, including one ton of rice, four tons of beans and about 5,000 eels, a 
delicacy here. 
</P>
<P>
"You join another great son of America, Takamiyama, in becoming only the second 
foreign sumo wrestler to have achieved this pinnacle of success -- the Sumo 
Championship. Please keep up your good work," Bush said in a telegram. "We are 
all proud of you." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Konishiki's claim to the Emperor's Cup, after winning 14 bouts against 
one loss, not only marked a dramatic comeback in his career, but it also 
symbolized the brighter side of U.S.-Japan relations at a time of worsening 
economic friction. 
</P>
<P>
An emotional backlash to aggressive Japanese investment in the United States, 
such as Sony's $4.3-billion acquisition of Columbia Pictures, has recently 
aroused charges that Japan is trying to "buy the soul of America." And U.S. 
officials fault Japan for maintaining closed markets that deny access to 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
That can no longer be said of sumo, arguably the "soul of Japan." 
</P>
<P>
Takamiyama, who retired in 1984 after 20 years in the ring, was the first 
non-Japanese to break into the game. But a sour note greeted his win at the 
Nagoya tournament in 1972, as Japanese fans and sportswriters struggled with 
the seemingly incongruous notion of an alien out-wrestling their own champions. 
</P>
<P>
When former President Richard M. Nixon sent a congratulatory message to 
Takamiyama, the text was read in English, an awkward anomaly that violated the 
inner sanctum of sumo for some purists. 
</P>
<P>
Takamiyama, who later took Japanese citizenship to qualify as a sumo stable 
master, was never promoted above third-ranked sekiwake. 
</P>
<P>
Yet sumo has since internationalized, to a degree. A dozen or so foreign 
wrestlers have attempted to discipline themselves within its rigid traditions 
in recent years -- undergoing arduous training, submitting to communal living 
and gorging themselves on traditional chankonabe stews of fish and vegetables. 
Most have not lasted very long. 
</P>
<P>
Konishiki has endured. Already he has risen higher than Takamiyama or any other 
foreigner in the elaborate hierarchy of sumo, winning enough matches to attain 
the second-highest rank of ozeki in 1987. At that time he boldly declared his 
ambition to fight all the way to the supreme yokozuna (grand champion) rank. 
</P>
<P>
It was Takamiyama who recruited Konishiki, a Hawaiian high school football star 
who planned to study music in college, and brought him to Japan to apprentice 
at a sumo stable in 1982. Konishiki, a natural athlete who is relatively nimble 
for his enormous girth, qualified for the professional grade of sekitori after 
only 2 1/2 years of training. 
</P>
<P>
In an article he wrote last year for the Japanese magazine Bungei Shunju, 
Konishiki recalled the bullying and hardships of his rite of passage into the 
Japanese wrestling cult. An intoxicated senior slapped him awake one night, 
demanding to know why Konishiki had gone to bed before him. Another cruel 
stable mate threw away a bundle of personal letters he had been saving. 
</P>
<P>
"When higher-ranking wrestlers make it tough on the people beneath them, it's 
usually because they see they have promise and want to put them to the test," 
Konishiki wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who can't take the hazing probably doesn't have what it takes to 
succeed in sumo," he said. "That's the reason they've done it this way for 
hundreds of years. . . . I'm a believer in tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Konishiki's first star showing, his 12-3 record in a 1985 tournament, for which 
he was awarded the Outstanding Performance Prize, aroused some of the sumo 
xenophobia that marred Takamiyama's earlier gains. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-1 American said he received poison-pen letters. Later, when he was 
routinely defeating higher-ranked wrestlers, Konishiki got death threats by 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
Bigoted sumo fans mounted "stop Konishiki" campaigns, and during one tournament 
someone nailed a doll bearing his likeness to a tree at a Shinto shrine in 
Kamakura. (Sumo had its origins in the ritual of Shinto, Japan's indigenous 
religion.) 
</P>
<P>
"I entered sumo under the same conditions as a Japanese and received the same 
kind of treatment while I was training," Konishiki recalled in his magazine 
article. 
</P>
<P>
"But I keep hearing people say they don't want a foreigner to win, that I 
shouldn't be promoted to the top rank of yokozuna since I only win by brute 
strength," he wrote. "I feel like saying to them, 'Listen, if you don't want me 
to win or become a grand champion, why did you let me into sumo in the first 
place?' " 
</P>
<P>
Konishiki, whose weight has hovered around 500 pounds since he began competing, 
is easily the heaviest of the 36 wrestlers competing in the top makunouchi 
division. He outweighs Chiyonofuji, 34 -- the comparatively diminutive yokozuna 
who reigns over sumo with his quick moves and wily technique -- by more than 
200 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Konishiki rammed Chiyonofuji, "the wolf," out of the ring Nov. 24, breaking the 
latter's eight-tournament winning streak. The crowd in Fukuoka, for the record, 
cheered for Konishiki as he racked up his wins. 
</P>
<P>
"Sumo is power, that's all. It's two men pushing and flailing at each other in 
a ring," said Ryosei Oki, 58, a Tokyo taxi driver who listened tensely to a 
radio broadcast of Konishiki's tournament-clinching bout as he drove last 
Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody cares that Konishiki is a foreigner," said Oki, whose devotion to sumo 
is eclipsed only by his love for besuboru (baseball). "He's got power. It 
wouldn't matter if he had a face like a devil, so long as he's strong."

HUSBANDS OUTRANKED, BUT NOT OVERWHELMED

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When psychiatrist Dr. Richard Roukema and history teacher Marge Roukema moved 
to the small town of Ridgewood, N.J., 32 years ago, they were known around town 
as "Dr. Roukema and his wife, Marge." 
</P>
<P>
Years later, when she became a local school official, they were referred to as 
"Dr. Roukema and the vice president of the school board, Marge Roukema." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, after she was elected to the U. S. House of Representatives and the 
couple was pictured in newspapers, the caption read, "Congresswoman Marge 
Roukema and her husband, Dr. Roukema." 
</P>
<P>
Soon it became, "Congresswoman Marge Roukema and her husband, Dick." 
</P>
<P>
Today, on the doctor's official congressional passport, he is referred to as 
"spouse of a person." 
</P>
<P>
Not even a name. 
</P>
<P>
"I was gradually being demoted," says this congresswoman's spouse. "My identity 
was really being shattered. My advice to any man in this position is: Be sure 
your identity is intact." 
</P>
<P>
There aren't hordes of men in his position -- just because there still are not 
hordes of women in Congress or other high-level positions in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But for the growing army of political husbands, men whose wives outrank them, 
out-power them and sometimes out-earn them, the key, they say, is to have their 
own lives, their own identities, a lot of self-confidence and a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have a lot of patience, you have to develop skills in the kitchen 
and you've got to enjoy doing the shopping after midnight at the 7-Eleven," 
says Anthony Morella, a Bethesda, Md., lawyer and husband of Rep. Connie 
Morella (R-Md.). "The truth is, you need a sense of security. And I'm very 
secure." 
</P>
<P>
It's a familiar refrain among political husbands, most of whom say they are 
abundantly comfortable in their role as the lesser half. 
</P>
<P>
But they also say they are only comfortable because the kids are grown, their 
own careers are well-established and successful and they have developed solid 
relationships with the microwave. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes, No. 1, being old enough," says Stephen Lowey, a New York lawyer 
married to Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), who was a full-time wife and mother when 
their three now-grown children were young. "I don't know if I could have 
handled it 15 years ago. There were too many pressures in my own career and 
family priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"If a man has achieved a certain measure of success both in career and family 
terms, and is capable of giving and making changes in his personal life, then 
it can work and it can be fun." 
</P>
<P>
Fun indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Lowey, whose wife is a congressional freshman, was invited to join Washington's 
year-old "Denis Thatcher Society," a loosely organized group of men, all 
married to important women. They occasionally meet at clubs to which their 
wives belong. 
</P>
<P>
There are no rules for the group, named after the soft-spoken, back-seat 
husband of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
But to be a member you have to know the password: "Yes, dear." 
</P>
<P>
Members -- including James Schroeder, husband of Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-Colo.) 
and the sort of "dean" of congressional husbands, and founder Charles Horner, 
husband of Constance Horner, undersecretary of the Department of Health and 
Human Services -- recently met their hero when Denis Thatcher was in town to 
address a British group. 
</P>
<P>
When told about the society named for him, the dutiful husband responded with 
appropriate humility and reserve: "Indeed." 
</P>
<P>
Horner, associate director of the U. S. Information Agency, figured that such a 
support group was called for when he noticed the couple's mail was being 
addressed to "Mr. and Mrs. Constance Horner." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Wald, a Washington lawyer married to U. S. Court of Appeals Judge 
Patricia M. Wald, says that the men he has met who do feel subjugated by their 
wives' lofty positions and are self-conscious about the imbalance in their 
relationships often are not from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many women in this town who are successful, and this town is full 
of guys happy to be consorts of these women," Wald said. "I have never for a 
moment felt the slightest envy, or in any way subordinated. I always took 
immense pride in Patricia's successes." 
</P>
<P>
But he says he constantly is asked what it's like to be married to a federal 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always asked if I refer to her as 'Your Honor.' " 
</P>
<P>
His response? "Only in the privacy of the boudoir." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, jokes are to the political husband what fund-raising lunches have been 
to political wives -- a mainstay of life. 
</P>
<P>
When Lowey was late to a Democratic Party dinner in his wife's district last 
spring, he announced at the podium, "Nita wouldn't let me come until I did two 
loads of laundry." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a certain potential for humor," says Lowey, who, like most 
congressional husbands, maintains his career outside Washington, "and I play 
upon that." 
</P>
<P>
And so do others. 
</P>
<P>
At an orientation meeting for freshmen spouses given by the Congressional Wives 
Club this year -- a lunch for about 200-plus women and Stephen Lowey -- club 
members added a shaving kit to his gift tote bag that included perfume and 
makeup. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Morella says one of his "great joys" is going to some political event 
with his wife -- outside Maryland where the congresswoman is little-known -- 
and being mistaken for the public official. 
</P>
<P>
"I dare say most of the time people bee-line to me," says Morella, who received 
the "Spouse of the Year" award from the National Women's Political Caucus this 
year. "I let it go for a few seconds and then I'll call Connie over and say, 
'By the way, I'm not the member of Congress. She is.' She says I'm perverse 
about it. I am." 
</P>
<P>
Washington psychiatrist Dr. John McGrath believes that all this frivolity may 
be a way of "detoxifying" a difficult situation, or "expressing some of the 
men's anger or annoyance." 
</P>
<P>
"If the men were the ones invited to the White House, it wouldn't be all 'fun' 
and 'wonderful.' It would be 'important' or 'prestigious.' It's as if it's 
Disneyland instead of a real power stage." 
</P>
<P>
He adds, "It's an uneasy role, a demanding role for a man to play." 
</P>
<P>
And Roukema, a psychiatrist and political spouse, says that he has seen men 
"react very badly when their wives get into business and become successful, 
especially more successful than the men." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, he says, "I can't help but feel a little envious sometimes of the 
power. Sometimes my job seems insignificant. I have to remind myself it's 
something I chose to do, and by and large, it's been a pretty good choice." 
</P>
<P>
Though few political husbands will point to any real trouble spots, several do 
admit to sacrifices they have had to make, changes in their life style or bouts 
of loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the dog and me," says Lowey, whose wife joins him back home on weekends. 
"And I bought myself a microwave." 
</P>
<P>
"It can be a lonely thing," says William Bentley, 30-year husband of Rep. Helen 
Bentley (R-Md.) and the self-taught cook in the family. 
</P>
<P>
When customers greet Bentley at his Cockeysville, Md., antiques store, they 
always ask about Helen, he says. "Helen? Helen who?" he answers. "That sums it 
up pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Bentley says that he has little interest in politics, prefers not to attend 
political functions and never engages his wife in political discussions. 
</P>
<P>
But a number of husbands say they not only discuss issues with their spouses 
but act as surrogates. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Lowey, who took a leave of absence from his high-paying job to campaign 
for his wife last year, says that he often offers his views on issues. "She 
takes into consideration my views -- and often rejects them." 
</P>
<P>
Says Roukema: "We're constantly talking about issues. She'll sometimes call me 
up on the day of a big vote and say, 'What do you think?' " 
</P>
<P>
He sees that as part of his role as political spouse, a role he has thought a 
lot about. 
</P>
<P>
"To be a political spouse," he says -- with apologies to former Sen. Eugene 
McCarthy, who turned the phrase to describe politicians -- "you have to be 
smart enough to know how to play the game, and dumb enough to think it's 
important."

<P>
It takes three firm raps on the door, but somewhere within the depths of his 
three-story home John Casey begins to stir. Two more knocks and he finally 
appears. His hair is dripping wet, he wears a half-size bathrobe and there is 
shaving cream clinging to one earlobe. 
</P>
<P>
"You're five minutes early," Casey shouts, racing back upstairs. "Or am I five 
minutes late? Maybe you're on time. Don't worry, I'll put coffee on. Do you 
want coffee? I hadn't thought to ask. Coffee. Right. I'll be back. Make 
yourself at home." 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, the man who won the 1989 National Book Award for fiction last 
week appears in his kitchen looking somewhat less disheveled. But a mood of 
breathless disorder persists, much as it has ever since his novel "Spartina" 
beat out four other entries to win the prestigious $10,000 prize. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his good fortune, the author launches into a brilliant but baffling 
anecdote about his Irish-American ancestors. Then he tells another. "Now where 
were we?" he says, suddenly losing his train of thought. "I've forgotten what 
you asked, and I've forgotten what I wanted to say. Where the hell are we?" 
</P>
<P>
Casey, whose aristocratic face and devilish smile look like a cross between Rex 
Harrison and Jack Nicholson, seems flustered by all the attention that has been 
coming his way. It has been 12 years since his last novel appeared, and his 
name has never been at the top of best-seller lists. Until recently, few 
publishing industry insiders thought "Spartina," however highly praised, had a 
chance of winning this year's prize. 
</P>
<P>
But to those who know the 50-year-old author, including some of America's most 
gifted writers, it was no surprise. Paul Theroux called Casey's dark, brooding 
novel about a Rhode Island fisherman "a tremendous achievement," while Ann 
Beattie praised the writer's "tantalizing talent," saying he "deserves to have 
the back of his hand kissed for this novel." 
</P>
<P>
The notoriety of winning the National Book Award might send other authors into 
a heady tailspin. Yet through it all, Casey has retained his wry outlook on 
life -- not to mention his sense of humor. He was in excellent form last week 
at the annual New York hotel banquet where the award was announced. Asked by 
reporters why he thought his book had won, Casey flashed a wicked little grin 
and said, "I guess the judges were in the mood for my book. It's like a date 
when you read a book. Some of them go well, some of them don't go well. So I 
guess I lucked out. I was a good date." 
</P>
<P>
Explaining why he quit a promising law career 25 years ago to become a writer, 
the author borrowed a line from Conrad Aiken. 
</P>
<P>
"The way you choose your life's work is to find something that your father is 
very proud of but that is not the thing he's best at," Casey said. "My father 
practiced law and was a U.S. congressman, and he was a good storyteller . . . 
But not quite as good as me." 
</P>
<P>
Few critics would disagree about Casey's literary gifts. In addition to the 
praise for "Spartina," Casey won enthusiastic reviews for his 1977 novel "An 
American Romance," and for his 1979 novellas, "Testimony and Demeanor." He has 
shown remarkable range, exploring the foibles of New York professionals in his 
shorter works and the world of blue-collar workers in his latest book. 
</P>
<P>
The author, who has been an English instructor at the University of Virginia 
since 1972, lives in a comfortable, rambling home with his wife, Roz, an 
artist, and their 5-year-old daughter, Clare. He has two grown daughters from a 
previous marriage, and his present wife surprised him the night of the awards 
banquet with the news that she is pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, a pretty good year. Yet Casey complains half-seriously that he has 
always labored in the shadow of other family members. His late father, he 
explains, was a powerful Massachusetts congressman who expected him to be a 
lawyer and enter public service, despite his son's lifelong stuttering problem. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, Casey jokes, the notoriety of his award has been overshadowed by 
another relative's prize. This week, he and other family members will travel to 
Stockholm, where his brother-in-law, Harold Varmus, a UC San Francisco 
microbiology professor, will receive the 1989 Nobel Prize for medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"You learn to put this kind of award in perspective," he says, settling into a 
comfortable chair in his study. "It's not like I just did something and got a 
lot of applause, like an opera singer. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been working very hard on a series of novels for nine years, and this is 
just an interval, a brief pause, before the work continues. I've always known 
the value of hard work and discipline." 
</P>
<P>
From his earliest memories, Casey says he was in the orbit of Joseph Casey, a 
brash and charismatic trial lawyer who raised his five children with a firm 
hand. Although he was born in Clinton, Mass., the boy grew up in Washington 
where his father, a New Deal Democrat, served four terms in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish-American patriarch, who retired from politics after an unsuccessful 
campaign for the Senate, practiced law until he was 81. Financially successful, 
he expected young John to follow in his footsteps, and for some 25 years there 
didn't seem to be much question that would happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a shy, tubby kid with a crew cut who ate too many Hershey bars and had a 
stuttering problem. But I also had an Excalibur complex," Casey says, referring 
to the legend of young King Arthur, who as a rite of manhood pulled a magical 
sword out of stone. 
</P>
<P>
"All the kids I knew had fathers who held public office, and I didn't think I 
would become a man until I held public office." 
</P>
<P>
With great affection, Casey describes his father as someone who would burst out 
singing in public, flirt with waitresses and generally do outrageous things. 
One St. Patrick's Day, for example, the old man stunned his family by halting a 
marching band in front of a New York bar, raising his hands as a conductor and 
then leading the musicians up Fifth Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what he did, he simply walked right up to them, took over the band and 
marched away. He left us for an hour and then he returned. We had never seen 
such a thing, but for him it was nothing special." 
</P>
<P>
By the age of 13, Casey says he wanted to be a diplomat, largely because of his 
eccentric uncle Drew Dudley, who worked for the World Bank in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"Uncle Drew knew a lot of wonderfully sophisticated people. When I traveled to 
meet him, he introduced me to Europe, and I thought, well, maybe I can't be 
like my father, but I could be a diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
"My uncle never made a penny in his life, but he always had a set of tails and 
black tie and was a social butterfly. He knew everyone who was charming, 
including theater people." 
</P>
<P>
One person who got to know Dudley was Benjamin C. Bradlee, now executive editor 
of the Washington Post. Casey says that Bradlee, who was his current wife's 
former stepfather, once said of Dudley: "I never knew a more socially adept, 
charming, useless man." 
</P>
<P>
As expected, Casey entered Harvard College, where he dutifully took courses in 
economics, political science and Russian. But he had shown a flair for creative 
writing in high school, and quietly enrolled in a theater course. It was an 
"outlaw activity" to his father, but Casey says he found it exciting. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, however, he rebelled against the regimen of campus life and began cutting 
classes. After his second year, Casey was kicked out of school as a 
"discipline" problem and entered the U.S. Army Reserve from 1959-60. He finally 
graduated in 1962 and enrolled in Harvard Law School. But his legal career 
would be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked part of law school but I was also terrified by it," he says. "They'd 
call on me and I could only argue the side of the case that had the fewest 
consonants in it, because I stuttered. Meanwhile, there were 150 people in the 
room ready to tear you apart verbally. I mean, this was not speech therapy 
class." 
</P>
<P>
All the while, Casey had been experimenting with writing and actually produced 
a novel in his spare time. A turning point came when he sought out Peter 
Taylor, one of America's most respected short story writers, who taught at 
Harvard. Taylor suggested that Casey try his hand at short stories. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged, the young author kept writing. By now it was graduation day, 1964, 
and Casey was troubled about his future. His father objected to a literary 
career, but Taylor strongly urged him to become a writer. 
</P>
<P>
"When he said that to me, I was thrilled," Casey recalls. "It was like someone 
had said for just a minute, here is this beautiful garden. And the idea that I 
could actually live in it seemed unlikely. It still seems unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
Although Casey hedged his bets by passing the Washington bar, he enrolled in 
the University of Iowa's writing school that fall, surviving on a $1,750 yearly 
stipend. His father was furious at first, but later approved after reading some 
his son's short stories. 
</P>
<P>
Like any other writer, Casey had his share of early disappointments. A second 
novel was rejected by a publisher, and the experience devastated him. By now he 
had married his first wife and was desperate for some professional success. 
Then suddenly, in less than a month, he sold short stories to the New Yorker 
and Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"I had made more money in three weeks than I had in the previous year. I was 
suddenly rich on my own, not by anyone's else's standards, but by my own," he 
says. "So I bought an island." 
</P>
<P>
Scraping together loans and what little savings he had, Casey purchased a 
4.2-acre island off Rhode Island, near his in-law's summer home. For the next 
four years, he earned just enough from his writing to get by. 
</P>
<P>
Immersing himself in the local culture, Casey lived and worked alongside 
retired naval chiefs, gentry and dirt-poor fisherman. He learned how to fish 
and feed his family, and became skilled at repairing boats in the local 
dockyards. In his spare time, he developed a passion for competitive rowing, a 
hobby that he enjoys to this day. 
</P>
<P>
These rich experiences would eventually generate a treasure trove of people, 
events, images and language for Casey's bulging notebooks. Years later, they 
became the basis for a trilogy of Rhode Island novels, of which "Spartina" is 
the first installment. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, Peter Taylor invited Casey to help him develop a writing program at 
the University of Virginia, an offer that the struggling author gratefully 
accepted. Meanwhile, he produced new short stories and "An American Romance." 
He later published "Testimony and Demeanor," the title story of which reflected 
his impressions of the legal profession. 
</P>
<P>
Casey was hard at work on a light comedy about life in Charlottesville, Va., 
when tragedy struck in 1979: Breece D'J Pancake, a gifted young writer whose 
career he had been encouraging, committed suicide. On a trip to Ireland, the 
writer learned that his father was dying back in America. Later that year, he 
and his first wife separated. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bad year, I was distraught," says Casey. "As for the comedy I was 
writing, well, I certainly couldn't keep it light." 
</P>
<P>
In the next several years, Casey regrouped and decided to write about his Rhode 
Island experiences. At first, he planned a series of modern fairy tales set in 
the New England state. Then various novellas began to take shape. It was not 
until the mid-1980's that he hit on the idea of casting "Spartina" as a 
free-standing novel to be followed by two others. 
</P>
<P>
The book, which tells the story of fisherman Dick Pierce, reflects Casey's 
fascination with blue collar workers. By working with them, he grew to respect 
their strong character and intelligence, which Casey says is under-valued by 
American society. He also developed a keen knowledge of fishing lore and, like 
a modern-day Melville, used it with great effect throughout "Spartina." 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of friends there who were manual laborers, and their life was 
really tough," he says." They're very smart people who have an enormous amount 
of understanding and history, and yet they're not very articulate. 
</P>
<P>
"The discipline of 'Spartina' to some extent is to make that intelligence 
verbal through metaphors of Dick's craft." 
</P>
<P>
When Pierce first embraces a woman with whom he will have an affair, for 
example, Casey writes, "he felt their weight against each other, as though they 
were small boats at sea rising on the swell, jostling, fendered by their 
flesh." 
</P>
<P>
When he is irked by party chitchat, Pierce describes it as a school of minnows, 
darting back and forth. A woman who is always dissatisfied "was like one of 
those fish who take the hook and just sulk on the bottom -- no runs, no jumps, 
no play." 
</P>
<P>
The word Spartina refers to a tough genus of marsh grass along Narragansett Bay 
that somehow survives in salty water. It becomes a symbol for Pierce, whose 
struggles with infidelity, class rage and a killer hurricane trigger in him 
profound changes by the end of the book. 
</P>
<P>
But it might also refer to Casey, whose belief in himself as a writer has 
stubbornly persisted over the years -- and will now reach a wider audience than 
ever before. 
</P>
<P>
The night he won the National Book Award, Casey was asked if his demons about 
living the "public life" his father expected had finally been exorcised. Was he 
finally freed of that childhood burden? 
</P>
<P>
"No, this is still very private, the writing that I do," he said quietly. "But 
now it seems to be becoming public at last."

'BLUE-COLLAR' SCHOOLS CHIEF CHANGES SANTA ANA IMAGE 
</P>

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rudy Castruita swept into the Santa Ana Unified School District 
superintendent's office a year ago last week with a flurry of activity, egging 
on students with the force of his boisterous personality and assuring parents 
that he would tackle overcrowding and other district problems. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with one school year behind him and a second just under way, the 
self-described "blue-collar superintendent" already can point to some 
noteworthy accomplishments: During his short tenure, Santa Ana has held its 
first peaceful salary negotiations in nearly a decade, pursued an ambitious 
land acquisition and school construction program, and forged strong ties to the 
city and state governments. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a fantastic year, a great experience with great opportunities," the 
personable superintendent said in an interview last week. "We're doing 
something special, and we're going to achieve great things." 
</P>
<P>
Castruita's pitch is so animated that he makes it easy to forget the challenges 
he faces. Already Orange County's largest district, Santa Ana grows 
exponentially, never failing to exceed planners' expectations. When he took 
over last November, Castruita inherited the state's ninth-largest district. 
Today, he presides over the eighth-largest, and it's growing almost every day. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, most of the district's 43,000 students have limited English 
skills, and 36% are immigrants, speaking close to 40 different languages and 
dialects, with Tagalog and Farsi-speaking students rounding out classes of 
youngsters who speak Spanish or Vietnamese. Test scores improved for 
eighth-graders last year, but fell or held steady for third- and sixth-graders, 
tracking state trends. And dropouts continue to confound educators' efforts to 
keep their students in school. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an amazingly difficult district because of its size and fast-changing 
demographics," said Kenneth Hall, president of School Services of California, a 
private educational consulting firm based in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if there's one thing that nearly all local educators agree on, it's that 
Castruita is up to the task of managing the melting pot district. 
</P>
<P>
Raised by his grandparents in El Monte, the 45-year-old superintendent entered 
elementary school not knowing English and became the first member of his family 
to graduate from high school. He went on to college, then earned a doctorate in 
education administration from USC. Castruita served as a teacher and 
administrator in the El Monte Union High School District and as principal of 
Los Alamitos High School before joining the administrative ranks of Santa Ana 
Unified four years ago as assistant superintendent of the secondary division. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Castruita replaced former Supt. Edward S. Krass, who resigned for 
health reasons. Castruita received a three-year contract at $85,000 per year -- 
$15,000 more than Krass was paid. 
</P>
<P>
Castruita's appointment made him only the second Latino superintendent of an 
urban school district in California, and he has offered himself as a role model 
for Santa Ana's predominantly Latino student population, which previously had 
few high-ranking officials of Latino heritage to admire. 
</P>
<P>
By his example and his enthusiasm, Castruita, a man with a firm handshake and 
fiery devotion to education, has taken Santa Ana Unified by storm. 
</P>
<P>
He had hardly been superintendent for a week before he was touring schools, 
shaking students' hands and chatting with them in English and Spanish. Since 
then, he's made it a practice to drop in on at least one school a day. 
</P>
<P>
Castruita also wasted no time in courting public opinion and political leaders, 
meeting with City Council members and other leaders and granting frequent 
interviews in the English and Spanish press. That propelled him into the 
spotlight but at the same time drew attention to changes in his district. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to create self-esteem for our students," he said. "To begin to 
change the image of the Santa Ana Unified School district to one of the finest 
urban school districts in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Joan Bissell, an education expert at UC Irvine, is among the legions of 
observers who sing Castruita's praises. 
</P>
<P>
"He is doing remarkable things," Bissell said, citing improvements in the 
district's computer education, bilingual instruction and other areas. "He is 
making Santa Ana one of the finest school districts in the state, if not the 
nation." 
</P>
<P>
Under Castruita, the district has initiated new bilingual education programs, 
including one that helps bilingual aides pursue college degrees and teaching 
certificates while they work for the district. That program has become a state 
model, and the district has received grants for its bilingual programs as well 
as its high-technology studies. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Santa Ana has updated its science curriculum and organized a peer 
assistance program to combat drug abuse. More than half a dozen new schools 
have opened, and others are in the works. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, Castruita has waged a spirited local campaign to earn teachers greater 
respect and to imbue parents with a sense of responsibility for their 
children's education. While that campaign gets rolling, he also has pursued an 
inside track with Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
He appears frequently at the elbow of Bill Honig, the state's superintendent of 
public instruction, and is one of a select group of educators who will join 
Honig at the state's education summit conference this month. 
</P>
<P>
"The consensus here is that Castruita is a very effective leader, and he's very 
well respected," said William L. Rukeyser, special assistant to Honig. 
</P>
<P>
In a district that is used to hearing the worst about itself, there's nary a 
negative word uttered about Castruita. Teachers seem to love him and school 
board members praise him. Students, too, are stirred. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen it so good here," said Rick Bryan, president of the Santa Ana 
Educators Assn., the union that represents district teachers. "From our 
perspective, Rudy Castruita is one of the best things that's ever happened to 
the Santa Ana Unified School District, or to education, for that matter." 
</P>
<P>
It's a sign of the changed times that Santa Ana's union, which has earned a 
statewide reputation as one of California's hardest bargaining groups, is 
praising a superintendent. For years, the union and the school board fought 
furious wage disputes, usually bogging down for months at a time. 
</P>
<P>
This year's contract was settled early -- and with hardly a trace of rancor. 
</P>
<P>
Which is still not to say that everyone was satisfied. Jim Richards, a school 
board member who lost his reelection bid at the polls Nov. 7, said he believes 
that the contract gave away too much to the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"The community really is not adequately represented," Richards said. "I do not 
think they got the best deal." 
</P>
<P>
Under the three-year contract, Santa Ana teachers are guaranteed raises of 1% 
more than the average of their counterparts in other Orange County unified 
school districts. That will make planning difficult, Richards said, because it 
will be impossible for district officials to know in advance how much they'll 
be paying out in salaries. 
</P>
<P>
But even Richards is impressed by Castruita's inaugural year. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an extremely valuable asset to Santa Ana," Richards said, rattling off 
adjectives like responsible, rewarding and aggressive. Despite his auspicious 
start, Castruita will need all those attributes to turn Santa Ana's fortunes. 
Change in education tends to occur over long periods of time -- Castruita 
compares it to manning the helm of an aircraft carrier. And Santa Ana's 
troubles are myriad. 
</P>
<P>
School Board President Audrey Yamagata-Noji, another outspoken Castruita 
supporter, worries that the superintendent will be tempted to do too much too 
fast. "The one weakness with Rudy Castruita is trying to do it all," she said. 
"A person gets burned out." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to imagine Castruita burned out. The superintendent plans a full 
agenda for the coming year. More new schools, better English instruction, more 
lobbying for money and more parent involvement are all on the superintendent's 
slate. 
</P>
<P>
All of them, he adds, come under the heading of ways to help Santa Ana 
students. Says Castruita: "If you keep the bottom line that you always do 
everything you can for kids, you can't go wrong."

INTERSECTION PLAN IS TURN FOR BETTER, ENGINEER INSISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a bit like trying to build a better mousetrap. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the traffic signal was invented in 1914, many a motorist has cursed 
while waiting at a red light. But try as they may, traffic engineers have been 
hard-pressed to devise a better way to regulate the growing gridlock at 
intersections. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Belisaro Romo. The Mexico City-born transportation engineer, now a 
resident of Orange County, has a newfangled design that he boasts is the 
perfect solution for congested, big-city intersections. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, Romo's idea eliminates the traditional left turn lane, which often 
keeps a grumbling pack of motorists waiting while cars cut quarter-circles 
across an intersection and onto a cross-street. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Romo has left-turning motorists swing across the on-coming lanes -- 
momentarily empty, with traffic from that direction stopped at a red light -- a 
half block before an intersection -- and roll down a special strip of pavement 
on the opposite side of a raised concrete median. When it's time for the main 
wave of cars to rumble ahead, the left-turners are free to do the same, 
unfettered by the need to cross oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
While it all may seem like a blueprint for a pinball game, the design has 
caught the eye of traffic planners in Orange County. They are studying the 
concept with the notion that it might prove a practical addition to the 
county's "super streets" program, an ambitious plan to upgrade bustling 
thoroughfares such as Beach Boulevard and Moulton Parkway in an effort to ease 
congestion and improve traffic capacity. 
</P>
<P>
As planners see it, the most palatable benefit is the elimination of the 
typical four-phase intersection, with signal lights permitting left turns, then 
through traffic, followed by the same sequence on the cross street. With Romo's 
design, only two signal phases would be needed, with through traffic and left 
turners going at the same time on each street. 
</P>
<P>
"It it works, I think we'll build it," said Arya Rohani, special projects 
manager for the Orange County Transportation Commission. "But it's going to be 
a while before we get to that comfort level and can trust it." 
</P>
<P>
Romo has also pushed his idea in Phoenix, San Diego and New York, where 
officials expect to decide in about a month whether they will use the design to 
upgrade an intersection at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Though all the ruminations and calculations have yet to be done, Romo's design 
has some alluring features for traffic engineers. Most notably, his 
intersection could be built faster and cheaper than the ramps and "flyover" 
overpasses that are the most viable alternative, Romo contends. 
</P>
<P>
But some transportation experts remain dubious, questioning just how user 
friendly this new-age intersection will prove. If the average motorist can't 
adapt to Romo's design, they suggest, it could create safety problems that 
don't exist today. 
</P>
<P>
"Theoretically, it works well," said Paul Singer, Anaheim's traffic engineering 
chief. "But public acceptance may be extremely difficult to achieve. It may be 
frightening for some motorists. I really wonder about the confusion that might 
be caused, with drivers having to start their left turn some 300 feet ahead of 
an intersection." 
</P>
<P>
County transportation experts, meanwhile, worry that the design might prove to 
be much more expensive than anticipated because of a need to buy up land to 
expand the right of way for the broad series of lanes Romo's plan requires. 
</P>
<P>
Even those who are bullish on the idea note that it could confound motorists. 
At the very least, they say, a plethora of street signs will be needed to help 
drivers find their way through the turn lanes. And the timing of the various 
signal lights will have to be perfected with pinpoint accuracy to make the 
intersection work well. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Orange County officials have yet to conduct the sort of in-depth 
computer analysis needed to determine if the intersection would prove a success 
or a flop in the real world. Steven Hogan, the county's transportation division 
manager, said he hopes to have some results by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
"If it works, we may give it a shot," Hogan said. "But we want to make sure 
that the gains you see at one intersection aren't taken away at another." 
</P>
<P>
The design's biggest booster, of course, is Romo himself. He hardly minces 
words while promoting the concept, making it sound like the next best thing to 
striped lanes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my best hand," he says of his intersection design. "I'm very proud of 
it. This is the culmination of my career, my life. All I know is here, in this 
simple concept." 
</P>
<P>
The son of a transportation planner in Mexico, Romo studied architecture in his 
homeland before moving to New Zealand for engineering school. He has been a 
transportation consultant for about 20 years, mostly in South America and 
Mexico, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly two years ago, he came north to market his new concepts, which include 
a singular design for a system of freeway overpasses that Romo contends is a 
vast improvement on the cloverleaf. 
</P>
<P>
Romo's main pursuit, however, is to improve the design of city streets, a 
branch of transportation engineering he believes has been neglected. He 
originally devised his new concept in hopes of selling it to the city of Irvine 
for use at the intersection of Jamboree Road and Barranca Parkway, but the city 
never went for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is a little bit afraid to try something new," said Herman Kimmel, 
president of a Newport Beach transportation engineering and a booster of Romo's 
design. "Everyone is just holding back. They don't want to be the first. They 
don't want to be the ones who stick their neck out." 
</P>
<P>
But it may not be long before someone does. Authorities in New York City are 
seriously investigating Romo's concept for use on an intersection at the foot 
of the Brooklyn side of the famous bridge leading to Manhattan, according to 
Joel Friedman, deputy assistant commissioner for traffic operations in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
With more than 15 million square feet of office, residential and commercial 
high-rise space scheduled to be completed in Brooklyn by 1993, city officials 
are eager to find a remedy for traffic problems at the entryway to the Brooklyn 
Bridge, he said. They originally planned to build a $16-million underpass to 
speed traffic, but have since turned their gaze on Romo's concept, which boasts 
a $2-million price tag, as a more cost-effective solution. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first looked at it, I thought it was good but really weird," Friedman 
said. "It's different than anything I've ever seen, but I think it could work. 
. . . New York has never been afraid to take a chance and try something new." 
</P>
<P>
But first the plan must pass tests to determine that it will improve air 
quality in the intersection, a key point since the entryway has been listed as 
a smog-choked "hot spot" by environmental agencies, Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
Romo is confident that his design will be an environmental boon for New York 
and other cities. Cars belch out pollution most when they sit idling in traffic 
or at stop lights, he noted, and his design would keep cars moving. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County transportation authorities agree that it all looks dandy on graph 
paper, but they are withholding judgment until they see more technical 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good idea," said Rohani of the County Transportation Commission staff. 
"I'm glad someone is thinking. The guy has put a lot of work and time into 
this. But we can't make any commitments until we see some more numbers and 
studies done." 
</P>
<P>
THE INTERSECTION OF THE FUTURE? 
</P>
<P>
1) CROSS TRAFFIC: 
</P>
<P>
Cross traffic in a standard pattern. Vehicles making a right turn proceed 
without stopping. 
</P>
<P>
2) U-TURNS: 
</P>
<P>
Vehicles make U-turns as cross traffic is moving. They will be able to turn 
without interfering with the flow of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
3) LEFT TURN POCKET: 
</P>
<P>
Vehicles that have lined up in a turn pocket about half a block from the 
intersection wait for a green light to swing into a special left-turn lane. 
</P>
<P>
4) LEFT-TURN LANE: 
</P>
<P>
While cross traffic is moving, left-turn vehicles continue down the special 
lane toward the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1) CROSS TRAFFIC: 
</P>
<P>
As left-turn traffic approaches the intersection, a signal light bring cross 
traffic to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
2a) THE LEFT TURN: 
</P>
<P>
Signal lights are synchronized so those making left turn get a green light as 
they approach the intersection. They are able to turn left without interfering 
with through traffic. 
</P>
<P>
2b) THROUGH TRAFFIC: 
</P>
<P>
Unimpeded by left-turning motorists, through traffic is able to proceed without 
any delay. In theory, the intersection increases traffic flow and reduces 
vehicle air pollution while costing less to construct. Several cities are 
studying the feasibility of the intersection. 
</P>

Drawing, THE INTERSECTION OF THE FUTURE?; Photo, Gridlock Solution? A proposed 
solution for Orange County's congested intersections has caught the eye of 
traffic planners. The newfangled concept would eliminate the typical four-phase 
intersection and left-turn lane, which often keeps grumbling motorists waiting 
in line. Planners think the concept may be a practical addition to the "super 
streets" program. STEVE TOWNSLEY / Los Angeles Times; Photo, LEFTY:

SAVE OUR PARKS GAINS GROUND IN HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It started in September, when a small group of friends and neighbors got 
together because they were worried about plans to use part of the city's 
Central Park for a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
From that meeting evolved a new political-action group called Save Our Parks. 
And although it's only 3 months old, Save Our Parks already is making big waves 
in Surf City. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Save Our Parks has: 
</P>
<P>
* Launched an initiative drive to forbid the city from selling parkland without 
a vote of the people. 
</P>
<P>
* Rallied opposition against Pierside Village -- a proposed cluster of 
restaurants to be built next to the Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
* Fought the proposed sale of about seven acres of city-owned land adjoining 
Irby Park. 
</P>
<P>
* Appeared regularly at City Council meetings, speaking against any moves to 
change the character of parks or beaches in this burgeoning coastal community 
of 180,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very much impressed with Save Our Parks," said Mayor Pro Tem Peter M. 
Green. "They're reasoned in their approach, and they obviously have done a lot 
of research." 
</P>
<P>
Added Councilwoman Grace Winchell: "I think they're very responsible. Their 
proposed charter amendment (against sale of parkland) is very important, and I 
like it." 
</P>
<P>
On the seven-member Huntington Beach City Council, Green and Winchell are 
usually identified as the slow-growth wing -- and are usually on the losing 
side of 5-2 council votes. But even council members who disagree with Save Our 
Parks are not hostile to it. 
</P>
<P>
"They're well-meaning, and I don't have any problem with them as long as they 
get their facts straight," Councilman Wes Bannister said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Thomas J. Mays said: "I think they (Save Our Parks) conduct themselves in 
a professional way. I think it's good that they're getting out in the community 
and bringing in some public comment on these issues." 
</P>
<P>
Save Our Parks was formed because the City Council majority -- with Green and 
Winchell opposed -- agreed last September on the concept of an 18-hole golf 
course to be built on an undeveloped portion of Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a golfer, but from a business standpoint, the golf course makes 
sense," Bannister said. "The land we're talking about is nothing more than a 
dump, an eyesore -- it's not land with green grass and trees. The city can't 
afford to fix up that land, but here is a way that it could be made attractive 
and at the same time bring in about $1 million a year in income to the city." 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Cook, a 35-year-old manufacturer's representative who is the chairwoman 
of Save Our Parks, disagrees with Bannister's assessment of the Central Park 
land in question. Cook said the undeveloped land at the southwest corner of 
Central Park is beautiful as is. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a place where all the cross-country teams in Orange County love to run," 
Cook said. "It's a place where one resident said she goes just to look at the 
stars. It's a place with a big hill -- about the only undeveloped hill in 
Huntington Beach." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Cook told how Save Our Parks evolved. "I heard about the 
plans for a golf course, and so I went around to some of the neighbors, and we 
had a meeting the night before the council was to meet last September. We just 
decided to have some people show up to speak against the golf course." 
</P>
<P>
Cook noted that the council majority was not swayed and still favored the 
concept of an 18-hole golf course. Save Our Parks became a permanent group 
shortly afterward -- initially working only to defeat the golf course but 
gradually taking on other issues. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only about 10 of us who meet," she said, "but we have more than 100 
people who've volunteered to help. Our membership is concerned about preserving 
parks and beaches. We aren't interested in running for public office." 
</P>
<P>
Save Our Parks' biggest challenge is to get about 22,000 signatures of 
registered voters in Huntington Beach on its initiative petitions to change the 
city charter. The measure, aimed at either the June or November, 1990, ballot, 
would put strict limits on the city's ability to sell or lease parks or 
beaches. The measure also would restrict building on any of these public lands. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal says: "Any sale, lease or other disposition of park or beach land 
would be subject to the prior affirmative vote of a majority of the members of 
the City Council and of the electors voting thereon at an election mandated by 
the measure. Such approval is also required prior to construction of any road, 
golf course, driving range, building larger than 3,000 square feet in floor 
area or of any structure costing more than $100,000 within any city owned or 
operated park or beach." 
</P>
<P>
"We think this would be very democratic," Cook said. "Before the city could 
sell or dispose of any park or beach, there would have to be both a majority 
vote of the people and a majority vote of the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
Winchell and Green tried to get the measure on the June ballot by council 
action -- preventing the need for voter petitions. But the council rejected the 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
"This means we'll have to get people out every week getting the signatures of 
registered voters," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
Winchell, in an interview last week, said: "What Save Our Parks is doing, in 
getting these signatures, is making a survey of Huntington Beach residents, and 
that's good. I think a survey should have been made before the council took any 
action on this golf course." 
</P>
<P>
Winchell said that in previous public opinion surveys, residents have clearly 
expressed a preference for passive, open-space parks. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister, however, said in a separate interview that previous surveys have 
been vaguely worded. He said the results, therefore, are not conclusive. 
</P>
<P>
But Cook is confident that most residents in Huntington Beach want to keep 
parks and beaches from being developed.

GROUP AID EFFORT FILLS 'SANTA'S CLOSET'

<P>
Nancy Pretty pulled a navy blue sweat shirt from its plastic wrapper, carefully 
folded it and placed it atop a dozen others in the overflowing "extra-large" 
pile. 
</P>
<P>
With 12 other multicolored stacks of sweat shirts, sweat shorts, socks and 
blankets, the two tables began to resemble a small store. Or, as Pretty and 
other Assistance League of Fullerton members call it, "Santa's Closet." 
</P>
<P>
Santa's Closet is one of three sections of the Christmas Clearinghouse that 
opened this week behind the Maple Community Center at 244 E. Valencia Drive to 
help the area's needy during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Families with appointments through their schools or community centers now can 
come to the clearinghouse to select items they need. 
</P>
<P>
"For many families, this will be the only Christmas they have," clearinghouse 
coordinator Betty Sharrott said. 
</P>
<P>
The project is sponsored by Fullerton Interfaith Emergency Services, a 
nonprofit group that organized other civic groups to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
Opposite the Assistance League's corner, Caroline Peterson of the Fullerton PTA 
Council peeled the price tag from a pink box containing a Barbie doll. Many of 
the toys collected are new and the others are only slightly used. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the kids to get something that's in really good shape," Peterson said. 
"Sometimes, this is the only item a kid gets and we want it to be fairly new." 
</P>
<P>
The council's toys included stuffed bears and other animals, arranged on the 
backs of two couches. The seats of the couches held a Mrs. Potato Head, a toy 
ukulele and assorted games and children's books collected in drives sponsored 
by about 20 city schools. 
</P>
<P>
"The toys go quickly," she said, "so we'll have to count on (further) donations 
for the next couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Besides clothing, blankets, toys and canned food, the First Presbyterian Church 
of Fullerton's board of deacons donated 270 coupons, each good for $10 worth of 
meat at a local grocery chain, Sharrott said. The coupons will allow the 
families to buy a turkey or ham just before Christmas, rather than having to 
store it at home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the canned food, which filled a wall of shelves at the 
clearinghouse and two metal storage sheds, was donated by the North Orange 
County Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Real-estate agents collect about 30 tons of food throughout the year for 
Fullerton Interfaith Emergency Services, board spokeswoman Debbie Shrider said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a lot of cans," she added. "I know, I had to carry a lot of them." 
</P>
<P>
The interfaith charity provides emergency food supplies and other assistance to 
the area's needy throughout the year. The other groups contribute extra help at 
Christmas time, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Assistance League raised enough money to buy about 800 sweat shirts, 400 
blankets and enough socks for every member of the 270 or so families expected 
to pass through Santa's Closet in the next three weeks, said Dee Stopper, 
assistant chairwoman of the league's Christmas drive. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's wonderful that so many groups can get organized to do all of 
this," Sharrott said. TOM McQUEENEY

RETIREE BRINGS GIFTS, LOVE TO BAJA VILLAGE

<P>
Just before Christmas every year, a convoy of cars with California plates pulls 
into Nasa Zaragoza, Mexico, population 350. Even before the first car door 
opens, a cry rises above the 40 or so rooftops of the village: "They're here!" 
</P>
<P>
The call is repeated again and again, literally echoing off the nearby hills 
until every resident of the Baja California farming community has heard: Nasa 
Zaragoza's personal Santa Claus has arrived, bringing with him cars filled with 
the only toys the children here ever see. 
</P>
<P>
As the children run to wash their faces and pat down their hair, the village 
leaders come out to greet their benefactor, a man who appeared out of nowhere 
one day 22 years ago bearing medical supplies and blankets. 
</P>
<P>
His name is Gerry Kyle, and he comes from a faraway spot in the north called 
Seal Beach. He comes because these people are his family, because they need him 
and, mostly, just because it feels right. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand, these people have nothing. I mean nothing -- not even 
the basics -- blankets, shoes," Kyle said. "They are just barely surviving. 
There's so much tragedy out there." 
</P>
<P>
Kyle, who has traveled extensively, said he can't remember how he happened upon 
the Nasa Zaragozans. But it was their strength and spirit that kept him coming 
back, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much love and happiness there, in spite of all the problems," he 
said. "It makes up for a lot of what they lack." 
</P>
<P>
For example, 14-year-old Carmelita is the oldest of nine children whose mother 
died a few years ago. Every day she rises before dawn to fix tortillas and 
coffee for her brothers and sisters. She cooks, cleans, prods her siblings to 
do their homework and finally puts them all to bed. Two years ago, Kyle's 
daughter told Carmelita she wanted to bring her a special gift. Carmelita 
insisted she didn't need anything, but called her brother Salvador over and 
told him to lift his foot. The soles of his shoes were cardboard. Carmelita 
asked for shoes for her brother. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you know, when Carmelita walked away, we saw her shoes were just the 
same as Salvador's. Just the same -- and she didn't say a word," Kyle said. 
</P>
<P>
Kyle, now retired, and his wife spend about nine months of the year in Mexico. 
They visit Nasa Zaragoza and nearby Guadalupe -- their other adopted town -- 
once a month and work closely with the schools, persuading students to stay in 
as long as they can, helping children pay for their books and uniforms, doing 
what they can to help the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
But the project closest to their hearts is the Christmas trip, a monthslong 
endeavor involving the efforts of Kyle's four children and eight grandchildren, 
and donations from all corners of the Seal Beach community. 
</P>
<P>
"It is so important to us to make sure that every one of those children has a 
toy on Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
The Kyles collect some 3,000 toys from individuals and businesses around the 
community each year -- almost enough to cover their ever-growing list of 
children, now totaling about 3,500. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone interested in donating toys, blankets, shoes, clothes, typewriters or a 
small school bus may call Kyle at 430-5221, or just drop the items off at 128 
8th Street in Seal Beach. The deadline for the Christmas excursion is Dec. 13.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Operation Santa Claus, sponsored by the county Social Services Agency, is now 
under way to benefit the less fortunate in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit program serves children in various foster homes throughout the 
county, including the Orangewood home for abused or neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
The county Fire Department and Sheriff's Department are major supporters of the 
program, and this year the Sheriff's Department is concentrating on collecting 
gifts for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Various Orange County schools also donate money each year that is raised by 
students. And businesses may participate by having "angel trees," from which 
employees select tags and donate gifts for the identified children. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 17, the Los Angeles Rams will hold an Operation Santa Claus Toy Drive 
before their game with the New York Jets. People attending the game will be 
asked to bring a new and unwrapped toy. 
</P>
<P>
Those interested in donating may send checks to Operation Santa Claus, c/o SSA 
Volunteer Services, 14400 E. 1st St., Santa Ana, Calif. 92701 or call (714) 
586-4453.

<TEXT>
<P>
This Christmas, instead of drawing names and buying gifts for colleagues, 15 
employees of the Orange Police Department will pool their money to purchase 
gifts for a few families over the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The 15 administration officers asked the community resource officers to select 
the families and to determine their needs. 
</P>
<P>
The department also plans to buy groceries, a Christmas tree and toys for the 
children.

FRAUDULENT CHARITIES PREY ON CONSUMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If a telephone caller wants a charitable contribution on behalf of the Marine 
Corps or the Salvation Army, the consumer should beware. Neither solicits by 
telephone, and Christmastime seems to bring about an increase in fraudulent 
charity schemes. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station say they have received 
several calls recently from people who were asked to donate to the blind 
through the Marine Reserves. The Marine Reserves collect toys but not cash 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
"People take advantage of the naivete of the public and . . . our good name," 
said Maj. James McClain. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvation Army also has trouble at Christmas. People steal their bells or 
collection kettles and collect for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Maureen Williams, spokeswoman for Childrens Hospital of Orange County, suggests 
that anyone asked to make a charitable donation check out the charity before 
sending money.

HE PLANTS GRAPES, AND AN UNTIMELY RAIN BRINGS HIM A HARVEST OF HUMILITY;

NATURE: THE SCIENTIFIC FARMER FINDS HIS SMUGNESS -- AND HIS RAISINS -- WASHED

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In September, three times a rotting rain fell on my grapes trying to dry into 
raisins. 
</P>
<P>
Three times I cursed the weather as my stomach knotted with pain. Outside, my 
harvest was drowning; inside, my hopes were crushed. 
</P>
<P>
Three times I was taught the lesson: I have a fragile claim on the land. I had 
35,000 trays of withered grapes spread on the ground, waiting for the sun to 
dry them into raisins. With each rain, they swelled with moisture, sand became 
embedded in their wrinkles and the rot spread. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the danger of rain was part of my harvest rite. Raisins are still made by 
the archaic method of laying grapes out in the sun and waiting for them to dry. 
It is one centuries-old farm practice that has escaped change. We may have 
paper trays today instead of wooden ones, but the ritual remains the same. 
</P>
<P>
When the first storm came, I thought of praying, begging and pleading for the 
rain to stop. Another thought occurred: Had I committed an evil act, a sin, and 
was I now being punished? 
</P>
<P>
But a part of me foolishly believed I could control nature. Allied with 
technology, who needed prayers? Science could do anything. If there was 
something wrong with my vines or grapes, I'd just spray something on to fix 
them. 
</P>
<P>
During my youth, I was trained to be a master of my land, to control and 
dominate crops and harvests. Nature somehow became a separate entity, 
unconnected my daily practices. 
</P>
<P>
But the September rains quickly humbled me. I was defenseless, helpless as I 
tossed in bed at night. I listened to the soft sounds of raindrops and pictured 
them falling on my raisins, pictured my raisins becoming miniature oases for 
mold. 
</P>
<P>
I was being taught a harsh lesson: I could control much of nature, but not 
everything. Even though l could add a growth hormone to enlarge a berry, or 
dust a chemical and kill a pest, I was operating in a sea of uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
In taking our distance from nature, we farmers have lost touch with more than 
the elements. We exiled ourselves in our offices and homes. We functioned more 
and more as a business with workweek rhythms. We modeled our operations as an 
industry designed to produce a commodity. All the while we believed our 
insulation from nature was a control of nature. 
</P>
<P>
During the first rain, I paced in the night, stumbling through the stages of 
grief, journeying from denial to anger to depression. 
</P>
<P>
By the second rain I had begun talking out loud, asking for the huge black 
thunderheads to change course, pleading for the wind to blow and the sun to 
reappear. It must have looked crazy, yet in talking to the elements, I was 
beginning to acknowledge the mystery of my profession. 
</P>
<P>
By the third rain I had aged and perhaps grown a bit wiser. I felt older, more 
like the old-time farmers I knew. They seemed to accept rain as part of life. 
They had a wisdom of experience and a tradition of care. The day after it 
rained, they'd be out in their fields, crawling on their knees, sorting out the 
survivors, tray by tray. They valued their produce and the meaning of a life 
intimately tied to their work. 
</P>
<P>
The old-timers had patience and optimism and hope. This, too, was part of the 
nature of farming, the free and life-sustaining emotions of human nature. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say they were free of other human emotions. As the first storm 
clouds approached, I overheard one farmer saving that he hoped it would rain. 
His raisins were rolled and boxed, safely stored in his shed. 
</P>
<P>
His comment reflected how far we had gone. We had even lost our sense of 
community, opting for profits first and survival of the fittest. The rains 
would affect the law of supply and demand, the value of his raisins rising with 
each drop of rain falling. He would be a victorious hunter in the world of 
agribusiness. 
</P>
<P>
Yet farmers are not hunters, we are planters. We are nurturers of nature. And 
we have chosen to live in nature's fragile and transient world. 
</P>
<P>
As I plan next year's work, I will remember this September. I hope that in the 
rain I also was given a measure of the wisdom I saw in my father and uncles and 
neighbors.

U.S.-ARAB RELATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alfred H.M. Shehab, president of the National Assn. of Arab Americans, in an 
Op-Ed Page article ("Keep Up Our End of U.S.-Arab Friendship," Nov. 26), 
attempts to portray Saudi Arabia as a country "sharing an interest in bringing 
peace and stability to the Middle East," and therefore entitled to purchase 315 
of the most advanced American tanks to add to its military arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
Is Saudi Arabia a force for peace in the Middle East? The Saudis have 
participated in every major war (1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973) provoked or 
launched by the Arab powers against Israel. In 1967, Saudi Arabia joined the 
other Arab countries at Khartoum in declaring that it would never recognize, 
negotiate or make peace with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1948, Saudi Arabia has considered itself to be in a state of war against 
Israel and has rejected all attempts to induce it to end this state of war and 
recognize the state of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudis insisted, when they purchased F-15 airplanes from the U.S., that 
they needed these planes for defense against a hostile Iran, but they built 
three airfields to house the planes 1,000 miles from Iran and within a few 
minutes flying time of Israel. There is little doubt that the new tanks will be 
stationed far from Iran and within easy striking distance of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Syria is one of Israel's most intransigent enemies, but it is not generally 
known that a good part of the enormous sums spent by the Syrians for the 
purchase of advanced Soviet military equipment have been supplied by the 
Saudis. Likewise, of all the Arab powers, Saudi Arabia has been the most 
generous contributor to the anti-Israel, terrorist PLO. And, since the outbreak 
of the Arab riots in Judea, Samaria and Gaza, only the Saudis, according to PLO 
Chairman Yasser Arafat, have continued without letup to make the financial 
contributions that fuel the violence and make possible its continuation. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia joins in every effort to expel Israel from the United Nations, and 
Saudi Arabia is one of a few states in the world which prohibits Jews, by law 
(without a U.N. protest), from working or living in the country. Is all the 
forgoing the way to bring peace and stability to the Middle East? Oil reserves 
may be a source of power, but not necessarily of truth.

A TASTE OF SHORTAGES TO COME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Water shortages threaten to squeeze California from all sides in 1990. State 
officials are not yet saying the word drought out loud, but that is a matter of 
semantics. Absent heavy winter storms in both Northern and Southern California, 
the coming year could give the state a sharp taste of a future in which water 
shortages are the norm, not the occasional inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
A wet March prevented 1989 from being a disastrous third consecutive drought 
year in California. A bountiful Thanksgiving Week storm is all that keeps 
California now from slipping into official drought-watch status. As it is, 
State Water Project officials will announce this week that its farmer customers 
can expect to receive only about two-thirds of the irrigation water they seek 
for the coming growing season. This could change, of course, if heavy winter 
storms fill the reservoirs on the Sacramento River system. 
</P>
<P>
But the fact is that most of California is experiencing drought right now. 
Those hoped-for Northern California storms that feed the State Water Project 
will not guarantee the buffer Southern California has enjoyed in past years 
because of pumping capacity problems. Recent dry years in the Rocky Mountains 
and increased water diversions to Arizona may limit, for the first time, the 
Metropolitan Water District's draw on the Colorado River to about 1 million 
acre-feet, down by about 20% from this year. A MWD official commented: "Our 
system is absolutely maxed out." 
</P>
<P>
Growth in the six-county region served by the district is one reason for 
impending shortages. Just five years ago, officials were predicting that they 
would be providing 2.3 million acre-feet of water to their retail water 
districts, serving an estimated 15 million people, by the year 2000. The future 
is now: MWD already has reached that level. 
</P>
<P>
The district is working on a number of innovative projects that will stretch 
its supplies in coming years. But the most effective method of meeting 
immediate shortages is through strict conservation -- voluntary conservation if 
it works; actual water rationing if it does not. Southern California officials 
must begin preparing the people for such a contingency now.

GLAD WEATHER TIDINGS SEND THOUSANDS TO BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of beach-goers, propelled by unseasonably warm weather and heavy 
ocean swells, flocked to the Orange County shore Sunday, taking an early-winter 
reprieve from holiday shopping and busying area lifeguards with a number of 
battered surfers and bicyclists. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of people who took a break from the lines in the stores and 
decided to work on their tan lines instead," said Brent Ranek, a lifeguard at 
Newport Beach, where as many as 10,000 beach-goers staked out places in the 
sand rather than the malls. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach lifeguards made two rescues of swimmers caught in riptides and 
treated some cuts and bruises, Ranek said, but that did little to dampen the 
spirit of a springlike afternoon just a few weeks before winter's official 
debut. 
</P>
<P>
Similar reports came from lifeguards and park officials throughout Orange 
County. Surf of four to six feet -- with some county beaches reporting waves as 
big as eight feet -- made the day ideal for surfers, and though water 
temperatures in the low 60s held down the number of swimmers, sunny skies and 
gentle, warm breezes made the beach a popular afternoon spot. 
</P>
<P>
"There's lots of surfers and sunbathers, many more than we'd usually have this 
time of year," said Gus Avila, a lifeguard at Bolsa Chica State Beach. On a 
normal, early December weekend day, the park would be lucky to draw 1,000 
visitors, Avila added, but Sunday's crowd was estimated at 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Diederich, a seasonal lifeguard at Laguna Beach. Diederich estimated that 
about 8,000 people had ventured to the beach by mid-afternoon, busy for a 
December day but far below the 35,000 to 40,000 who flock to the beach on a hot 
summer weekend afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a busy day for the kind of staff we have out there," said Lt. Steve 
Davidson of the Huntington Beach lifeguard office. "We've had a shoulder 
dislocation and a couple of lacerations." 
</P>
<P>
"It's hit this beach pretty hard," said Lon Graham, a lifeguard at Huntington 
State Beach. "We've been pretty busy, with quite a few surfers losing their 
boards and things like that." Most of the state beach accidents occurred far 
from the break. Bicyclists racked up the biggest collection of battle scars. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington State Beach reported some of the day's biggest waves, with surf 
breaking at six to eight feet.

DEALER SAYS NEW-CAR CUSTOMERS FACE LOTS OF PRICE HIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John O'Dell, Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sales of domestic autos are plummeting, demand for import cars has slumped 
since mid-year and industry pundits say that 1990 holds only more of the same. 
But they also say that the weakened market won't create much in the way of 
bargains for car shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons are a combination of costly government safety requirements, 
paper-thin dealer profit margins and consumer demand for standard features that 
once were expensive options, says John B.T. Campbell III, president and chief 
executive of the Campbell Automotive Group in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot is that auto prices are expected to be up slightly next year and, 
except for the now-ubiquitous manufacturers' rebates and a few fire sales by 
distraught dealers, it won't be a buyer's market out there, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell started his professional life as a certified public accountant after 
graduating from USC with a master's degree in business taxation. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1978, at the ripe old age of 23, his father persuaded him to join the 
auto group, which began in 1965 as a Volkswagen dealership in Buena Park. 
Campbell hired on as controller and became president in 1980. Campbell 
Automotive Group was formed in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The transition from CPA to car dealer -- even at the executive level -- was 
disturbing, he said, because he found he had entered an industry, "where people 
hold onto their wallet when they hear what you do." 
</P>
<P>
 But Campbell is determined to change that image. To help further his goals he 
has done things such as instituting a dress code for sales people and a pay 
system that downplays commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Campbell Automotive Group operates 11 new-car franchises on six lots in 
Orange and Riverside counties. All carry the Campbell name and all are run as 
units of the same business -- part of a deliberate campaign to build an 
identity that transcends the kinds of cars being sold. 
</P>
<P>
 For Campbell is one of a new breed of so-called "super-dealers" who are 
banking on consumers shifting loyalty from car brands to dealerships as the 
differences among autos -- in price, quality and appearance -- disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with staff writer John O'Dell, Campbell shared his views about 
what car dealers and their customers can expect in 1990 -- and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. It's almost Christmas. Is that a good time for car sales? 
</P>
<P>
A. December is the worst month because we're competing with Santa Claus and not 
many people give cars as presents. The best months are usually in the spring. 
But that varies a lot now because an awful lot of sales these days are driven 
by manufacturer rebates. 
</P>
<P>
Q. About those rebates. When we see an ad that says ABC Motor Corp. is rebating 
$1,000 on every XZ-10, it sometimes also says the actual savings may vary 
because of dealer participation. What does all that mean? 
</P>
<P>
A. Dealer participation in a $1,000 rebate means the manufacturer has required 
the dealer to contribute a portion of it. So if the dealer doesn't want to 
participate, then the net savings to the consumer may not be the entire $1,000. 
But only a relatively small percentage of rebates require dealer participation. 
The car makers have been getting away from that. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Rebate programs are a manufacturer's way of boosting poor sales. We've had a 
lot of them in the last half of this year and apparently are going to see more 
in 1990. Just how bad will things get next year? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, 1989 was tough and 1990 will be tough too. But it is not like 1974, 
when we had an industrywide depression. We will hit about 14.5 million car 
sales nationwide this year. That's the fifth- or sixth-best year in history. 
The big problem is that dealer profit margins already are pared to the bone and 
the industry keeps dishing up more and more manufacturers and models, and that 
siphons off customers. Dealers have to keep slicing the same pie into smaller 
and smaller pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How small? 
</P>
<P>
A. There were about 150 various car models five years ago, there are 260 now 
and there will be almost 300 by the end of 1991. We are going to see a thinning 
of the dealer ranks simply because there are not enough buyers to go around 
anymore. And now we're into the same manufacturers having their own marques and 
then selling the same cars to other manufacturers to sell under their names. 
Mitsubishi does it with Chrysler, Suzuki with (General Motors') Geo. I think 
that what that does is blur the manufacturer's image in the marketplace. I 
mean, what is this car? Is it a Mitsubishi or is it a Plymouth? 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why, if things are rough, are we told that there won't be a lot of car 
bargains available? 
</P>
<P>
A. One thing to be recognized is that in the price the consumer pays for a car 
there's a manufacturer's cost, a distribution cost and the dealer cost. I can't 
speak for the others, but dealer margins are paper-thin right now. We have been 
keeping records in our company for 12 or 13 years, and in terms of percentage 
of sales price, dealer margins are at their lowest level. And dealer 
profitability is the lowest in the 25 years the National Automobile Dealers 
Assn. has been keeping records. The average new car dealer now is earning at or 
below 1% on sales, which is a very, very razor-thin margin. I think the margins 
at the dealer level are low as they're going to get. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is that the only reason prices won't fall? 
</P>
<P>
A. No. With all the government regulation and consumer expectations, there's a 
lot more in a car than there used to be. For 1990 we're seeing the largest 
percentage increase in the price of cars that we've seen in this decade. A lot 
of that is because of air bags, passive restraints, new shoulder harnesses in 
the rear seats. . . . A lot of these things are quite expensive. And that is 
tending to push the price of cars up. There's a value there for the consumer. 
But it increases the price. Also, look at what is standard on a car now -- 
what's expected by the consumer -- versus what was standard 10 or 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Q. For instance? 
</P>
<P>
A. Things like fuel injection are almost a standard item in cars today, but 
were only in exotic cars 10 or 15 years ago. And look at the quality of 
materials being used; the horsepower you're getting per liter of engine. There 
have been tremendous improvements. You used to get stripped versions that had 
no carpets. They had vinyl seats. No radios. Now, even the stripped-down 
versions of the cheapest cars have carpeting and a lot of those other things. 
Power equipment, air conditioning, cruise control, sunroofs -- all these kinds 
of things are quite common, and the quality of installation is up dramatically 
from what it was some years ago. So the consumer is demanding more. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is this demand for options an acquired taste? Or is it that dealer margins 
on the add-ons are higher than on the base vehicle so dealers crammed the cars 
full and "helped" the consumer develop a taste for the fully dressed car? 
</P>
<P>
A. That was true some time ago, when dealer margins on add-ons were higher. But 
it's been 15 years or so since the markup on accessories has been significantly 
different from the markup on the car. I don't think that the demand is being 
pushed by dealers, I think it's being driven from the consumer level. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Speaking of markups and accessories, some of the scandals in car dealing 
today have been with the sales and pricing of relatively inexpensive add-ons 
like identification etching systems and extended warranties that wholesale for 
$50 and retail for $1,900. Is there much abuse in this respect? 
</P>
<P>
A. Our industry is like any other: We have bad ones and we have good ones. Is 
there gouging? By all dealers, no. By some dealers, yes. How pervasive is it? 
It goes on. It definitely goes on. One of the things we based our company on is 
the fairness of our pricing. We don't do that (gouging). We have maximum 
pricing so that our sales people cannot get overzealous. We audit all sales and 
we've refunded money to customers before when we charged over our maximum 
pricing. That's what we are doing. And there are other dealers that do that 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The commission system means that the higher the price, the more money the 
sales people make. Are dealerships run on the commission basis because there is 
no other way to structure them? 
</P>
<P>
A. Other dealers have experimented with not paying commissions, and it 
generally hasn't worked well. Among other things, the commission is an 
incentive for the sales force to sell cars so the dealer makes a profit. But we 
are experimenting now with some alternative pay plans. They are very complex 
and I wouldn't want to explain them, for competitive reasons. But basically 
they preserve an element of commission and offer other things to try to develop 
some employee longevity -- turnover is a very big problem in our industry -- 
and also to encourage people to make customer satisfaction a goal. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are you trying to wean the sales person from the idea that he is working for 
himself? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. In terms of the horse-trading that goes on, though, I don't see 
anything that is going to change that, even though I frankly would like to see 
it change. There doesn't seem to be too much on the horizon to change people's 
idea that they are supposed to negotiate the price on a car. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The price of cars seems to get higher and higher. 
</P>
<P>
A. The average is about $14,000 this year and it is going to be in the $15,000s 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Aren't prices getting into the unaffordable range for many people? 
</P>
<P>
A. There are arrangements with no down payments and with smaller down payments, 
and there is a lot more creative financing going on. Then there's leasing of 
course, and there's been a revolution in extended terms. It wasn't that long 
ago that 36 months was the standard car loan. It is almost 60 months now. And 
there are car loans being offered at 84 months, and even a few at 120 months. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does anyone keep a car long enough to pay off a seven- to 10-year loan? 
</P>
<P>
A. It is a problem, and I think we as an industry now are paying for it. 
Obviously, if you have a seven-year car loan and you put very little cash down, 
then you don't have equity in that car until possibly the last year or two. So 
if you go to trade it in after three of four years you might discover than 
instead of getting something for it, you'll have to pay $2,000 to $3,000 cash 
just to get out of it. So you hang on to the old one. That has created some 
slack in sales. 
</P>
<P>
Q. A moment ago you said, "Then there's leasing." What is the benefit there? 
Taxes? 
</P>
<P>
A. Not if it's a personal lease. If it's a business car and you have some 
business deductibility, then whether you lease it or purchase it there can be a 
tax benefit. But the basic benefit is lower payments. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Most leases are the closed-end leases. How do they work? 
</P>
<P>
A. A closed-end lease means that if you keep the car to the very end of the 
leasing period and are within the mileage -- there's usually a mileage 
restriction of 10,000 to 15,000 miles a year -- and there's no damage to the 
car in excess of normal wear and tear, then you can return the vehicle and walk 
away from it. That's what a closed-end lease means. And that is what 99.5% of 
all leases nowadays are. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The car dealer's image has not been a great one over the years, and car 
buyers tended to be brand-loyal rather than dealer-loyal. Is this changing? 
</P>
<P>
A. We think so. As more and more nameplates and makes are available, and as 
they become more and more alike, and as the quality becomes more on a par from 
maker to maker, the dealer will make as much difference to a buyer as the car. 
And so our whole strategy as a company is based upon building and forming 
customer loyalty to the dealer. We think that, as cars become alike, the 
customer will buy what we sell because he'll say, "Gee, this Nissan, this 
Toyota, this Mazda, this Honda, they're all pretty much alike. But that dealer 
really takes care of me." 
</P>
<P>
What we're trying to do is create a positive feeling by operating with honesty 
and integrity and with a long-term view and commitment to generate customer 
satisfaction and enthusiasm and help improve our image. I think that's the only 
way that a company like ours will achieve what we want to achieve. And as we do 
this kind of thing and it works, then other people in the industry will have to 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Some dealers seem to be successful with huge volume on one particular brand. 
You and a few others seem to be going after success by offering a lot of 
different makes on a lot of different lots. Is that just a business preference 
or is there more to it? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think it is a business preference and a business philosophy. The industry 
is going more towards what we discussed earlier, where the image of the 
retailer will be important, and we want to be representing more franchises in 
more locations. We also want to maximize our sales from any given location with 
any given franchise. But you have to ask whether you want to keep this one 
dealership and put all of your resources into building it as big as you can? Or 
do you want to try and network out? 
</P>
<P>
From our standpoint, you can only get so big in one location. Having multiple 
locations and multiple franchises makes us bigger and lets us draw from a 
bigger pool of customers. If you were a single-point little supermarket in the 
1950s and you had decided not to try to expand and become a chain, you wouldn't 
be here today. There aren't many one-store supermarkets left. And that's a 
little bit of the philosophy that we have. I'm not saying that the individual 
car dealerships will go away, but I think there will be fewer and fewer of 
them, over time and that, to be one of the major survivors, we'll need to be a 
large diversified chain with a good public image. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I'm taking this opportunity because not too many of us get to sit down with 
a car dealer and ask him, "What does this mean?" So, what are the basic charges 
that a dealer adds on to the manufacturer's suggested retail, and where does 
your profit margin come from? 
</P>
<P>
A. I can only tell you what our situation is. When we buy a Ford, we pay Ford 
Motor Co. a certain amount. That's the invoice amount. The car comes in with a 
manufacturer's retail price on the sticker. There already is a margin between 
that and our cost, the invoice price. And in our company we have a policy that 
we do not mark cars up over manufacturer's suggested retail price except to add 
equipment at a reasonable price. So we might take the manufacturer's suggested 
retail price and if we add air conditioning or put some kind of special wheels 
on it, we will add that to the sticker at a reasonable retail price. 
</P>
<P>
Q. At the typical dealer, if there is such an animal, what is the major profit 
center? Service, parts, sales or what? 
</P>
<P>
A. There is no such animal as a typical dealer in that sense. Some dealers make 
most of their money on sales, and some on something else. But basically, 
without good new car sales you can't make it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Otherwise why be a dealer? 
</P>
<P>
A. Right. The other areas are profit centers, but if you're not doing a 
reasonable job in new car sales then there is no way anything else can help. On 
the other hand, with the slim margins on new cars in today's market, if you 
don't have a good service and parts business you're not going to make it 
either. 
</P>
<P>
What's happening now is that dealers are having to be more well-rounded. The 
guy out there who used to make money by selling 300 cars a month and ignoring 
service -- those guys are going away rapidly because without people's business 
back there in service they can't make it. So I don't think there is any one you 
could say is where you make it or you don't make it. In today's market you have 
to make a little bit in all places. In new cars, used cars, parts, service and 
body work or else you're not going to be one of the survivors. And to do that, 
you have to have customers who come back.

ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL IS TERRIFIC, EVEN AT HALF SPEED

<P>
While Asleep at the Wheel's grizzled leader Ray Benson might not be the ideal 
model for Father Time, he filled the bill Saturday night, welcoming in Orange 
County's newest music club, the Southampton in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Benson's Western swing outfit has been routinely orbiting through O.C. since 
the early '70s, having played Huntington Beach's now-legendary Golden Bear for 
more than a decade, until the club became redevelopers' grist. 
</P>
<P>
If Asleep at the Wheel similarly outlives the Southampton, it probably will be 
more due to the group's durability (it has weathered more than 60 member 
changes and a 300-day-per-year tour schedule) than to any lack in the club. 
Though the 350-seat facility isn't yet an ideal concert setting, there is much 
to recommend it. 
</P>
<P>
The room was built as a dinner theater. It's excellent sight lines and 
acoustics (the latter aided by a high, domed ceiling) lend themselves equally 
well to amplified concerts. The sole technical drawback Saturday was in the new 
sound system, which seemed to be serving only one side of the room, leaving the 
band's vocals buried on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
Still, while none of the seats were particularly far from the stage, the 
proximity didn't quite equal intimacy. The low, five-sided stage is so large 
that it might leave all but the largest bands feeling stranded on it, and the 
blazing lights splashing down from all angles made it sometimes seem that the 
musicians were part of a showroom display. 
</P>
<P>
That and the room's somewhat stuffy appearance might have applied some 
restraint to the proceedings (the Asleepers didn't oblige the Southampton crowd 
with an encore, as they do at most of their shows) but not enough to keep 
several of the more rambunctious audience members from creating an impromptu 
dance floor in front of the stage. One particularly enthusiastic fellow with a 
Marine haircut even began making an expletive-drenched speech from the stage 
before being shouted down by Benson's suggestion that he purchase a Mr. 
Microphone. 
</P>
<P>
Benson and Co. have been livelier at previous county shows, but even at half 
throttle the seven-piece band is a pure pleasure to hear. Though Western swing 
pioneer Bob Wills probably would have thought twice about lending his car keys 
to this bunch, they do a better job of capturing the spirit and nuance of his 
music than any other current band, except perhaps Merle Haggard's. 
</P>
<P>
Their 18-song set Saturday included Wills' "San Antonio Rose" and "Roly Poly," 
Louis Jordan's jump-blues classics "Ain't Nobody Here but Us Chickens" and 
"Choo Choo Ch' Boogie" and songs ranging from the jazz standard "Jumping at the 
Woodside" to the crazed rockabilly of "Hot Rod Lincoln." And nearly without 
exception, the varied material was spiced with the unique Western-swing blend 
of dance-happy country and jazz styles originated by Wills and his Texas 
Playboys in the '30s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
The non-swing numbers, Benson's solo country blues version of "Prodigal Son" 
and an appropriately ruminative rendition of Wille Nelson's "Blue Eyes Crying 
in the Rain," were no less splendid. Benson's hot jazz guitar runs throughout 
the show were matched by John Ealy's steel guitar and Larry Franklin's fiddle 
work, with the latter especially flying on "Texas Fiddle Man." 
</P>
<P>
Owned by Al and Barbara Hampton, the Southampton is the smaller sister of Santa 
Ana's 500-seat Harlequin Dinner Theatre, which also is getting into the concert 
market. With its name changed to Hampton's, that club will see its name-act 
debut Dec. 14 with a show from Buster Poindexter. Joseph Schenk, talent buyer 
for the venues, said the Hamptons hope to present 15 shows a month in each 
room, featuring rock, jazz and rhythm and blues. 
</P>
<P>
Forthcoming shows at the Southampton include Moe Bandy on Dec. 11 and a New 
Year's Eve show with Jan and Dean. Hampton's will have the Vegas revue Legends 
in Concerts, exhuming Elvis and others, Dec. 18 through 30; a New Year's show 
with Jack Jones, and Blood, Sweat and Tears on Jan. 5 and 6.

Six-year-old Patrick McCollum, one of 500 people who came Saturday to the grand 
opening of the Children's Museum of La Habra's new wing, looked at a mysterious 
mechanical exhibit and asked his dad: 
</P>
<P>
"What's it do?" 
</P>
<P>
Patrick, wearing an orange baseball cap and missing a few teeth, was asking 
about four metal plates and a microamperes meter on display in the new Science 
Station room, which is filled with hands-on displays and experiments for 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch McCollum, Patrick's father, motioned toward two of the plates and said, 
"Put your hands on them." Then he pointed at the meter. "See? You have 
electricity flowing through you." 
</P>
<P>
"Oooh!" said Patrick, pulling his hands away. 
</P>
<P>
The museum has encouraged children to use their hands to learn since it opened 
12 years ago, and now with a new wing that triples its space and a new schedule 
allowing it to be open on Saturdays, there's that much more room and time for 
the children to touch -- and discover. 
</P>
<P>
There are two other rooms in the new wing: a Kids on Stage room, where children 
can try on donated costumes and can work spotlights and play with props; and 
Preschool Playpark, where toddlers can play inside an artificial tree. The wing 
also contains an auditorium for performances and office space. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's older attractions remain, including the Nature Walk exhibit where 
children can pet stuffed wild animals and view a live bee colony through glass. 
</P>
<P>
The new wing is designed in a California mission style to blend in with the 
original museum facility, a 1923 Union Pacific train depot. The wing, new 
equipment, exhibits and operating expenses cost $700,000, raised mostly through 
private contributions and grants. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant director Melissa Banning said the museum expects that its attendance 
will double to 200,000 a year now that there is the room, the staff and, with 
Saturdays, the time to handle more visitors and tours. 
</P>
<P>
"We're more of a learning center than we've ever been," Banning said. "We've 
always wanted to do art programs, craft programs. Now we can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Children's Museum of La Habra is at 301 S. Euclid St. and is open from 10 
a.m. to 4 p.m. every day but Sunday. Admission: $1.50 for ages 2 to 16, $2 for 
adults. Free for children under 2. Information: (213) 905-9793.

Euro-style is the buzzword these days in the fashion and design magazines. 
Copywriters are applying it to anything that looks sleek, glamorous and 
worldly, whether it's a leather jacket or an end table. 
</P>
<P>
"Euro-style" conjures up a continent of wealthy, impossibly sophisticated types 
who've seen it all and, frankly, are rather bored with it. You can imagine them 
murmuring veiled insults to each other in fashionably stark apartments while 
chain smoking and picking idly at cuisine minceur. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, much important contemporary European art tends to come across as 
more secretive, spare, unlovable and coldly theoretical than the American 
variety. But some sophisticated European artists are mining a different vein of 
experience -- the peasant basis of modern-day culture. Artists such as 
Magdalena Abakanowicz and Mario Merz, well-versed in the ins and outs of 
contemporary art, are finding new ways to express such themes as closeness to 
the earth, religious ritual, and the burden of political oppression. 
</P>
<P>
Italo Scanga, whose paintings and sculpture from the past few years are at the 
Art Institute of Southern California through Jan. 2, was born in Italy in 1932 
and immigrated to the United States in 1947. Scanga has taught and exhibited 
widely in this country, and he has been on the faculty at UC San Diego for more 
than a decade, yet his work is still flavored with memories of his native 
region of Calabria -- where popular belief in magic thrived for centuries 
alongside a devout Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
His wooden figures standing on low carts are descendants of the images used in 
church processions at festival time. His use of junk objects and vivid 
patterning, and his deliberate primitivizing of the figure also hark back to 
other times and places untouched by the hard-edged consumer values of America 
in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Scanga's work reflects the curse of late 
20th-Century artists: the awful weight of all the historically important styles 
that have come and gone during the past few centuries. He is a latter-day 
troubadour singing an optimistic song of man and his place in the world as well 
as a painfully self-aware artist whose vision is shaped by the ironies of 
contemporary urban life. 
</P>
<P>
In his "Figure With Plow and Lion," a small metal object is attached with wires 
to a tall stick figure with no feet or hands, and whose body is painted in a 
decorative pattern of bright colors. This stick person stands on a low table 
patterned with animal and human figures along with a real tea kettle and a 
crudely shaped spatter-painted head of a lion. The significance of the 
miniature plow and the lion are not entirely clear, but these items give the 
simple, home-made figure an aura of myth. Perhaps he is the brave spirit of the 
fields, or the emblem of farmers in a town whose civic symbol is the lion. 
(Traditionally, the lion is a symbol of St. Mark, one of the four Evangelists.) 
</P>
<P>
A more polemical tone infuses "Troubled World (Awl)," in which a globe (labeled 
with the word hunger) is balanced on a large rod-shaped tool. The tool (too big 
to be an awl, unless there's an industrial-size variety) rests in turn on an 
upended pitchfork with a splayed wooden handle that looks like a pair of 
miniature legs. This entire balancing act is perched on a tree trunk whose 
chopped-off limbs have been crudely covered with swipes of black paint. 
</P>
<P>
The piece offers a set of symbols for farming, nature, man and the world at 
large, and it calls attention to the precariousness of humankind's 
interconnectedness. 
</P>
<P>
Scanga's work seems less interesting when it gets more arty. In "Red Figure 
With Banjo," he builds up the figure with an array of wooden pieces suggesting 
the way Cubist painters shattered the figure into volleys of arcs and straight 
lines. He echoes generations of modernist art-scavengers by recycling a 
fragment of wooden frame as the figure's arms. 
</P>
<P>
The musical theme harks back to a favorite Cubist subject, and the real banjo 
and guitar in the piece suggest the Cubists' use of bits of real wallpaper or 
newspaper as foils for their painted abstractions. Even the vibrant patterning 
that covers both figure and instruments owes more to Abstract Expressionism and 
Fauvism than to peasant art. Ultimately, however, the piece seems rather cold 
and contrived, lacking the warmth and funky oddity of some of Scanga's homelier 
sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
His loosely brushed paintings are full of glancing references to nature -- 
skies and mountains, birds and trees and gourds -- and also colorful passages 
of dots or speckles. Human beings only rarely wander into this fairy tale 
paradise. 
</P>
<P>
In "Untitled (Woman with Urn)," the peasant woman with a basket on her head is 
a collaged photograph of a painting from another era. In "Untitled (Mandolin 
and Vase with Figure)" the figure is a wispy white painted nude, as 
insubstantial as a ghost. Such images, with their lack of logical space or 
proportion, operate almost like dream memories. The main n problem in work of 
this kind is offering too much cute, folklorish imagery without delivering the 
emotional goods. 
</P>
<P>
Although Scanga does not quite stoop to formula, his combinations of images 
sometimes suggest a dream told so many times that it no longer has its original 
magical power. One wonders whether he has not journeyed -- geographically and 
psychically -- so far from his original themes that they no longer seem 
immediate and compelling. 
</P>
<P>
Next week: a look at Imre Bukta, a Hungarian artist (in "The New Art of 
Hungary" at the Modern Museum of Art, through Feb. 18) who paints his 
countryside with a brilliant mixture of irony and affection. 
</P>
<P>
 Work by Italo Scanga remains through Jan. 2 at the Art Institute of Southern 
California, 2222 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach. Gallery hours are 8 a.m. to 
5 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Fridays and 11 a.m. to 3 
p.m. Saturdays. Admission is free. Information: (714) 497-3309.

KENNEDY CENTER GALA: A FIVE-STAR TRIBUTE FOR LIVING LEGENDS

In the ornate halls of the State Department reception rooms, even the rich and 
famous were in awe as this year's Kennedy Center honorees were feted Saturday 
night with a black-tie tribute attended by the center's board of trustees and 
star-studded guests. 
</P>
<P>
Actress Cicely Tyson worked the room with her camera, asking guests to 
photograph her with this year's honorees: singer Harry Belafonte, actresses 
Claudette Colbert and Mary Martin, ballerina Alexandra Danilova and composer 
William Schuman. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps none was more enraptured than Bernadette Peters, who never seemed more 
than five yards from Martin. 
</P>
<P>
"Mary is so wonderful, so graceful, so full of life," Peters whispered to 
another admirer. After the dinner and formal presentation, when Peters finally 
approached the stage legend, she was tentative and almost withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Peters, and others like her, bore testament to the prestige and honor of the 
Kennedy Center award, now in its 12th year.

"This is not an industry award and it's not how successful you've been," said 
Belafonte, who at 62 is the self-described baby of the honorees. "It's how 
people perceive you as a person. In that sense, it's one of the greatest honors 
I could have received." 
</P>
<P>
The weekend salute also included a White House reception Sunday afternoon with 
Barbara Bush. It was wrapped up late Sunday with the 12th annual Kennedy Center 
Honors extravaganza, to be televised Dec. 29 on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
It was Saturday's intimate board of trustees fete, though, that captured the 
essence of the prestigious award, bestowed for performing arts achievements 
that have made a lasting impact on American culture. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a rare privilege to be graced with such talent," said Deputy Secretary 
of State Lawrence Eagleburger at Saturday night's gala. He cited the honorees 
as "diplomats who bear witness of the United States all over the world and the 
vitality of its culture." 
</P>
<P>
In introducing Colbert, 84, Gregory Peck noted her stylish portrayals in a 
series of movies, including her Academy Award-winning performance in the 1934 
comedy "It Happened One Night," co-starring Clark Gable, who also won an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
"She always seemed fresh, always herself and always the character," said Peck. 
"She was the first Cleopatra (in movies), the first torch singer. She makes us 
laugh with her sophistication." 
</P>
<P>
Delivering the toast to Colbert, television personality Kitty Carlisle Hart 
called her "the best thing France has sent us since the Statue of Liberty." 
</P>
<P>
Danilova, 85, is "the model of a ballerina. Grace, dignity and genius are the 
gifts of Alexandra Danilova," said Peck. Danilova, who began her career in the 
Soviet Union, was later a choreographer for the Metropolitan Opera in New York 
and played a ballet teacher in the 1977 movie "The Turning Point." 
</P>
<P>
Peck described Belafonte as "an actor, a singer, a director, a producer . . . 
truly a Renaissance man. He has labored for the cause of human rights and has 
lived the words he once sang, 'We Are the World.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), offering the toast to Belafonte, said the 
entertainer "has given nobly and unselfishly to the cause of making our country 
a better place and our planet a better world. Many great artists have a 
conscience too, but none greater than his. He has two qualities that describe 
the brilliance of his life: courage and excellence." 
</P>
<P>
In introducing Martin, Peck said: "She was, and is and always will be Peter 
Pan," noting the 1955 Broadway and television role for which Martin is perhaps 
best known. "If we didn't have musicals, we'd have to invent them for her." 
</P>
<P>
Composer Betty Comden, who helped write the songs for "Peter Pan," toasted 
Martin as a "great artist and a great star who has that rarest of qualities -- 
bundles of charm." 
</P>
<P>
Schuman, 79, who served as president of the Juilliard School of Music and won 
the Pulitzer Prize for music in 1943, was hailed by Peck as "a giant of the 
performing arts." 
</P>
<P>
"Composer Aaron Copland once said of Schuman's pieces that only an American 
could have written them," Peck added. "He's set to music the poetry of Walt 
Whitman, done a baseball opera . . . and written madrigals from the Sears &amp; 
Roebuck catalogue." 
</P>
<P>
Past recipients include comedian George Burns, actress Myrna Loy, actors Jimmy 
Stewart and James Cagney, and composers Leonard Bernstein and Aaron Copland.

CZECHS RALLY AGAINST NEW GOVERNMENT;

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 250,000 pro-democracy demonstrators thronged Prague's Wenceslas 
Square today chanting "They must go!" in an angry protest against Communist 
domination of Czechoslovakia's new government. 
</P>
<P>
The jostling crowd howled for the resignation of Communist hard-liners as 
leaders of the Civic Forum opposition movement accused Prime Minister Ladislav 
Adamec of cheating their expectations of a power-sharing Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
A workers' spokesman, Igor Pleskot, said workers should be prepared for a 
general strike next Monday unless Adamec took people supported by Civic Forum 
into the government by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
"We want honorable, expert and undiscredited men," Civic Forum's Jiri Cerny 
told the demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Adamec appointed non-Communist ministers Sunday for the first time since the 
1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia to suppress the "Prague Spring" 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
But the inclusion of 16 Communists in the 21-member team only deepened the 
political crisis that began Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Student Michal Sedlacek accused the Communist Party of ignoring Parliament's 
abolition last week of its monopoly of power after 40 years of unbroken rule. 
</P>
<P>
The new government "does not correspond to the real division of the political 
forces in our society," he said. "We feel disappointed and cheated and that is 
why we will go on striking." 
</P>
<P>
Also today, thousands of tourists from Czechoslovakia freely visited the West 
for the first time in decades after the government lifted most travel 
restrictions. It was one of the major concessions made last week to the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
There were no long lines reported at any border crossings to the West. 
Czechoslovaks still need a visa from most Western countries they wish to visit, 
with only Austria lifting visa requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the mass exodus of East Germans earlier this year, most of the travelers 
from Czechoslovakia were not resettling abroad. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Soviet Union and the four other Warsaw Pact 
nations that invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush a reform movement today 
condemned the action. 
</P>
<P>
The statement came as East Bloc leaders met in Moscow to hear President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev's report on his meeting with President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary, East Germany and Poland 
said the entrance of their troops into Czechoslovakia 21 years ago constituted 
"interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign Czechoslovakia and must be 
condemned."

<P>
A one-time major independent record promoter and one of his business associates 
pleaded innocent in federal court in Los Angeles today to charges stemming from 
a cash and cocaine payola scam. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Isgro, 42, who has promoted records by such artists as Michael Jackson, 
Bruce Springsteen and David Bowie, entered his innocent plea to 51 counts, 
including racketeering, conspiracy to defraud five record companies and making 
undisclosed payola payments to radio stations. Isgro also pleaded innocent to 
conspiracy to distribute cocaine and conspiracy to impede the Internal Revenue 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
Former Isgro business associate Jeffrey Monka, 31, of Agoura Hills, pleaded 
innocent to eight criminal charges. Monka is accused of helping set up a sham 
business to launder money between 1983 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The two men and Raymond Anderson, 49, a former Columbia Records executive 
accused of taking a $70,000 kickback from Isgro, were indicted Thursday.

NO PRE-YULE MCMARTIN VERDICTS, JUDGE ASSURES WORRIED JURORS

<P>
The judge in the marathon McMartin preschool molestation trial responded to the 
worries of deliberating jurors today by agreeing to withhold verdicts until the 
panelists return from Christmas vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Three jurors told Superior Court Judge William Pounders they feared that 
friends, neighbors and co-workers might put pressure on them about their 
decisions if some of the verdicts were to be announced before they leave Dec. 
15 for a two-week recess. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors are considering 65 separate charges against Raymond Buckey, 31, and 
his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, who are accused of molesting children at 
their family owned preschool in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The judge originally planned to announce the verdicts piecemeal, figuring it 
could take months before all of the decisions are submitted. 
</P>
<P>
His plan was motivated by the fact that no verdict is final until it is 
announced in court, and with no alternate jurors remaining, a loss of even one 
of the 12 deliberating jurors before the finale could invalidate the verdicts 
that had been reached.

The Orange County coroner's department today asked for the public's help in 
identifying the body of a woman who was struck and killed while attempting to 
run across the Costa Mesa Freeway last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was struck by more than one vehicle when she attempted to cross the 
southbound lanes north of McFadden Avenue in Tustin about 5:15 p.m. Saturday, 
Deputy Maureen Albrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
Albrecht said the woman is between 40 and 45 years old; 5 feet, 2 inches, and 
122 pounds. She was wearing black wool slacks with gray stripes, a black cotton 
polo shirt and L.A. Gear tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
A check of the woman's fingerprints failed to determine her identity, Albrecht 
said. Anyone with information about a missing person fitting this description 
is asked to call the coroner's office at (714) 647-7400.

S&amp;L CHIEF QUITS UNDER FIRE;

DANNY WALL SAYS HE IS SCAPEGOAT

<P>
M. Danny Wall resigned today as the government's chief regulator of savings and 
loans, saying he was made a "scapegoat to shoulder the blame for the entire 
thrift crisis" and the record bailout of the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. 
</P>
<P>
As he has done before, Wall insisted at a packed news conference and in his 
resignation letter to President Bush that he did nothing wrong and leaves with 
"personal integrity that will stand up to any scrutiny." But he said the fact 
that he was the "primary target" of a congressional investigation would create 
a hardship at the Office of Thrift Supervision, which he directed. 
</P>
<P>
Wall complained about a "steady stream of one-sided information emanating from 
the House Banking Committee hearings concerning my handling of Lincoln Savings 
&amp; Loan." 
</P>
<P>
He specifically cited Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairman of the House 
Banking Committee, whom he accused of resorting to "corruption of the truth and 
abandonment of our historical devotion to fair play and due process in his 
effort to remove me from office," 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said Wall has "done the best thing for himself and the federal 
regulatory system. . . . The savings and loan disaster has been extremely 
costly in terms of dollars and public confidence. It was essential that there 
be new leadership." 
</P>
<P>
For nearly two months, Wall has been the chief target of hearings by the House 
Banking Committee into why federal regulators allowed Lincoln to remain open 
until last April even though examiners had recommended in May, 1987, that it be 
closed. The bailout of the Irvine, Calif., institution is expected to cost 
taxpayers up to $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Wall has maintained there was not enough evidence to seize Lincoln and has 
dismissed allegations that he declined to act because of political pressure 
from five senators who intervened on behalf of Lincoln and Charles H. Keating 
Jr., chairman of Lincoln's parent company, American Continental Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Ethics Committee is reviewing the conduct of the five senators, 
among them Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
"As I testified under oath, neither political influence nor Lincoln's Charles 
Keating affected my decision on Lincoln," Wall said in his resignation letter. 
"Nor for that matter have I ever made decisions for political reasons during my 
tenure as chairman and director." 
</P>
<P>
Keating faces a federal grand jury investigation in Los Angeles and he is the 
target of a $1.1-billion fraud and racketeering suit brought by federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Wall said, "The simplistic efforts to find a scapegoat to shoulder the blame 
for the entire thrift crisis led various critics to join in the hue and cry 
raised by the House Banking Committee chairman for my departure from office." 
</P>
<P>
Wall testified for 10 hours before Gonzalez's committee in late November. 
Following Wall's appearance, Gonzalez said of his testimony, "Somehow it rings 
very hollow to say the huge regulatory bureaucracy could do nothing, did 
nothing, as the institution (Lincoln) went down." 
</P>
<P>
Wall was chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board from July, 1987, until 
last August, when its function as the federal regulator of the savings and loan 
industry was transferred to the new Office of Thrift Supervision.

A Coast Guard cutter ran aground today in 6-foot waves off Michigan in Lake 
Superior, injuring at least three crewmen and causing extensive damage, 
authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
Two helicopters and three cutters helped rescue the 50 crew members who were 
forced to abandon the 180-foot Mesquite, said Petty Officer Frank Jennings, a 
spokesman at the Coast Guard's Great Lakes district office in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Those flown to a hospital included a crew member with a broken arm and one who 
apparently suffered a heart attack, according to Jennings, who said the nature 
of the third injury was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
The World War II-vintage cutter, a buoy tender based in Charlevoix, Mich., hit 
a submerged ledge at 2:30 a.m. about three-fourths of a mile off Keweenaw Point 
near Copper Harbor in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Jennings said.

Modrow, the 61-year-old reformer and former Dresden party chief, led East

Right-wing extremist Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front party won a seat in the 
French Parliament for the first time in a year, winning 61% of the vote in a 
by-election in Dreux, election officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-immigration party also scored 51% of the vote in a regional 
by-election in Salon-de-Provence and 47% in another legislative by-election in 
Marseilles. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said the support for the National Front indicates a growing 
national discontent with immigration policies. 
</P>
<P>
Le Pen, who mustered only 11.4% of the vote in June, 1988, national legislative 
elections, has been at the forefront of a heated debate over whether Muslim 
women should be able to wear head scarves in state-run classrooms. Le Pen 
opposes the wearing of head scarves in public schools, saying it violates 
French culture.

Rebel soldiers positioned in hotels and high-rises fired on government troops 
in the Makati financial district today, refusing to end a 4-day-old mutiny and 
trapping hundreds of people in homes and hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
A rebel spokesman said trapped foreigners will be freed Tuesday but he said 
this does not mean the mutineers are giving up their fight to oust President 
Corazon Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
"We pledged our lives to this cause. We will hold the line to the last drop of 
our blood," said the spokesman, Capt. Alfred Yen. 
</P>
<P>
Two bombs exploded in the city, injuring two people. It was unclear if they 
were related to the coup attempt, which began Friday and has killed at least 70 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Americans and other foreigners were pinned down in homes and hotels 
in the Makati district, where forces loyal to Aquino contained the mutineers to 
22 buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Rebels shot at anyone venturing outside. 
</P>
<P>
"Literally, we're in the middle," said Barbara Julich, a New York businesswoman 
trapped in the Intercontinental Hotel. "(We're) now low on food. There are 
babies in the building, and there is no baby food, and the mothers are 
hysterical. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw a group of nuns trying to walk where the tanks are. They were 
eventually shot at and took cover." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy spokesman Jerry Huchel said about 215 Americans are believed 
trapped in three hotels in the wealthy district. An undetermined number of 
others are believed trapped in luxury apartments. 
</P>
<P>
At least three people were reported slain in Makati today and 15 wounded, 
including one American, by rebel snipers and in fighting between rebel and 
loyalist forces. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, spokesmen for the Makati Medical Center said 10 people were killed. 
</P>

About 400 rebels are still occupying Mactan Air Base in Cebu, 350 miles south

<P>
A federal judge today refused to dismiss the tax evasion indictment and 
conviction of "Hotel Queen" Leona Helmsley after ruling that prosecutors had 
not misused evidence she gave under immunity to an investigating grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling paves the way for Helmsley's sentencing to proceed as scheduled on 
Dec. 12 in New York Federal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley, who was convicted on Aug. 30 of federal income tax evasion, alleged 
the government improperly used testimony that she gave before a state grand 
jury in an unrelated case. 
</P>
<P>
She had been given immunity for testifying against prestigious jewelry 
companies Van Cleef &amp; Arpels and Bulgari, which were charged with violating 
state sales tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to get Helmsley's federal income tax evasion indictment and 
conviction thrown out, her lawyers charged that prosecutors might have violated 
the immunity agreement. A hearing on the matter was held last month. 
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. District Judge John Walker ruled today that the "substance of 
Mrs. Helmsley's immunized testimony is wholly unrelated to that of the federal 
investigation."

West German car maker Volkswagen said today it has proposed forming a joint 
venture with a state-owned East German vehicles producer. 
</P>
<P>
VW said its chairman, Carl Hahn, handed the proposal to the IFA industrial 
group, based in Karl-Marx-Stadt, which makes East Germany's Trabant car, among 
other vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The venture could prepare the way for the joint development, production and 
sales of cars and vans, VW said.

East Germany currently bans Western investment, but East Berlin officials say 
constitutional changes planned for next year will include laws allowing joint

UAL STOCK SOARS ON NEWS OF NEW BUYOUT OFFER FROM BOARD

<P>
UAL Corp. stock rose sharply this morning after a union official said the 
parent of United Airlines will present a new proposal for a buyout of the 
airline company to its flight attendants union on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The company has said that it has a presentation to make to the unions about a 
new buyout. . . . They are going to make that presentation on Wednesday, Dec. 
6," said Pat Friend, outgoing president of UAL's flight attendants union. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no idea what it is," Friend added. 
</P>
<P>
UAL's management has been struggling to put together a new buyout for the 
Chicago-based airline company since a planned $6.75-billion management and 
pilots buyout collapsed in October when the group failed to secure bank 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
Management is under pressure to shape a new buyout because Coniston Partners, a 
New York investment firm, has said it plans to take control of the board and 
push through a new transaction to lift the company's stock price. 
</P>
<P>
Expectations that a revised bid will be forthcoming sent UAL stock sharply 
higher this morning. It surged $5 to $179 a share by noon on the New York Stock 
Exchange, adding to Friday's jump of $12.50. 
</P>
<P>
Condor Partners LP, a holding company controlled by Coniston, said in filings 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it raised its holdings in UAL 
to 11.8% from 9.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street traders said they are encouraged by the news that Coniston had 
purchased more shares. 
</P>
<P>
"Coniston's buying more stock is great," one Wall Street trader said today. 
"They're putting their money where their mouth is." 
</P>
<P>
Flight attendants leader Friend also said her union is scheduled to resume 
labor negotiations with UAL on Wednesday. The union has been working without a 
contract since Nov. 1, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for UAL's pilots union said he was not aware of any meetings 
scheduled between the pilots union and the company. UAL's machinists were not 
immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Coniston last month said it plans to oust UAL's board through a consent 
solicitation, a direct appeal to stockholders that needs a majority vote in 
favor to be carried, and to pursue moves to raise UAL's stock price. 
</P>
<P>
Friend said that while a revised buyout plan may be presented at Wednesday's 
meeting, "We're a long way away from an agreement that would require a vote." 
</P>
<P>
Louis Marckesano, of the Philadelphia brokerage Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., 
said the "odds are pretty good" that UAL is working quickly to wrap up a new 
deal with employees. 
</P>
<P>
The resignations this weekend of two officers of the flight attendants union -- 
Friend and Vice President Carol Holmes -- could also mean a deal is near, 
Marckesano said. 
</P>
<P>
"The flight attendants have not been as cooperative under (Friend and Holmes)," 
Marckesano said in a telephone interview. "This may be a sign that perhaps they 
are easing their stance."

WARNERS PLANS MAJOR FILM ON LECH WALESA

<P>
Lech Walesa, the leader of Poland's Solidarity union, will be the subject of a 
major movie, Warner Bros. announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros. said the Polish electrician, who emerged during the Gdansk 
shipyard strike in 1980 and became a symbol of the move toward democracy in 
Eastern Europe, agreed to the movie deal during his five-day visit to Britain, 
which ended Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A Warner Bros. spokesman refused to disclose the price of rights and other 
details. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa completed negotiations with Warner Bros. Saturday morning, delaying his 
meeting with British Prime Minster Margaret Thatcher, who was waiting at 
Chequers, her official country residence outside London. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Canton, executive vice president for Warner Bros., said in London the 
company was proud and delighted to get the rights for Walesa's story and said 
it was eager to portray some of the changes sweeping eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"In these times of extraordinary social and political change in Eastern Europe, 
we all recognized that it began with Lech Walesa and Solidarity in Poland," 
Canton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros. said it will produce the film with the Los Angeles-based Mount 
Company. Production of the as-yet-untitled movie is planned for 1990 with 
release expected the following year, a Warner Bros. official said. 
</P>
<P>
A charity premiere of the film will benefit Solidarity's Social Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa emerged as leader of the unorganized strikers in Gdansk, who at first 
protested government food price hikes, but under his leadership turned to 
political demands, including the right to free trade unions. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday before leaving for Poland, Walesa said that he would be having fewer 
press conferences in the future. He said the rise of a multi-party political 
system in Poland would make Solidarity more like a Western trade union. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros. called Walesa's role "a unique and inspiring story" that the 
company is excited to tell.

PORTRAIT OF JESSE AS WHITE MAN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jesse Jackson, viewing for the first time the controversial painting that 
depicts him as a blond, blue-eyed white man, said Sunday, "It's not the picture 
that's the insult. It's the reality behind the picture: That's the insult." 
</P>
<P>
The portrait, entitled "How Ya Like Me Now?" by artist David Hammons and part 
of the Washington Project for the Arts "The Blues Aesthetic" exhibition, was 
placed on a street corner Wednesday evening. Just as three white WPA employees 
completed the installation, a group of about 10 black men took a sledgehammer 
to the work, knocking a major portion down. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon, Jackson saw the bottom section of the work, which shows his 
face from eyebrows to chin, when he toured the exhibition. He came, he said, to 
encourage the gallery, encourage artistic expression and put both the portrait 
and the reaction to it "in context." 
</P>
<P>
The "reaction is an extension of the art," he said. "You drop a big rock in the 
water -- the issue is not just the rock. It's also the ripples. This is a big 
rock." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he did not personally find the work insulting "because I 
understand it. My response was interpretation and intent. But I understand 
those that reacted violently. We must appreciate the source of their pain. They 
must not be painted out of the equation."

Pop stars finished a new version of the 1984 hit song "Do They Know It's 
Christmas?" early today to raise money for African famine victims. 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen singers ranging from Australian teen idol Kylie Minogue to 
U.S. veteran Tina Turner worked into the early hours to remake the Band Aid 
song that topped the charts in Christmas, 1984, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
The single is expected to go on sale Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
The original record raised about $10 million for starving Africans and spawned 
other projects including the transatlantic Live Aid rock extravaganza on July 
13, 1985, which brought in more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Millionaire pop-record producer Peter Waterman, who supervised production of 
the new single at his London studios, said he was considering organizing Live 
Aid II next year. 
</P>
<P>
Waterman lined up the pop stars and groups, including Cliff Richard, Chris Rea, 
Bananarama, Bros, Jason Donovan and Tears for Fears, after being approached by 
Irish rock singer Bob Geldof last week. Geldof, who conceived the 1984 single, 
said he is keeping a backstage role. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem (in Africa) is the same, the song is the same, and it's the same 
time of year," Geldof said. "The only thing that has changed is the faces in 
English pop music."

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: FDA'S FOOT-DRAGGING ON ALZHEIMER'S DRUG IS PUZZLING

Question: My dad, who lives with me, has Alzheimer's. He had reached the point 
where he was disoriented most of the time, especially at night. He would wander 
off, and sometimes we'd find him miles from home. But he couldn't find the 
bathroom in the house and talked nonsense most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
I managed to get some THA on the "black market" and since starting on it, he 
has improved so much that we are in shock! He is never disoriented now and his 
sense of humor and joy in family and life are back. It is truly an amazing 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
Papa's doctor is monitoring him for elevated liver enzymes, but no problems 
have come up. I am angry that this medication isn't readily available, and that 
it costs so much the way we have to smuggle it in. When will the FDA allow us 
easier access to this lifeline? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: That is a question we too have asked, but the Food and Drug 
Administration has failed to answer. Although most patients with Alzheimer's 
disease probably won't respond as dramatically to THA as your father has, there 
have been enough reports of improvement to warrant speedier action. 
</P>
<P>
Three years have passed since Dr. William Summers reported his landmark study 
on THA for Alzheimer's patients. Since then millions of people have continued 
to suffer and deteriorate like your father did. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA has a mechanism for allowing access to unapproved medications that seem 
promising for life-threatening conditions like AIDS or cancer. We don't 
understand why the agency has turned a deaf ear to the pleas of Alzheimer's 
victims and their families. 
</P>
<P>
Q. My husband is a pediatrician and washes his hands between every patient. His 
hands get very dry and rough this time of year. Last winter he started using 
Lac-Hydrin lotion at the office, and that helped a lot. 
</P>
<P>
He recently asked me to replenish his supply. To my astonishment, I discovered 
it is available by prescription only. Why is a moisturizer a prescription 
product? 
</P>
<P>
A. Lac-Hydrin is also our favorite lotion for dry, cracked skin. The 
manufacturer has apparently positioned it as prescription only, even though the 
active ingredient (alpha-hydroxy acid) is also available at lower strength in 
over-the-counter products like LactiCare and Aqua Glycolic Lotion.

Princess Anne cut the ceremonial ribbon to open a new cosmetics factory today

</P>
<P>
Security was tight as Queen Elizabeth II's only daughter opened the plant, then 
met management and the factory's staff. Her visit was not announced until she 
arrived in the province for fear the Irish Republican Army would disrupt it. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, Anne became the first member of Britain's Royal Family to visit the 
province after sectarian and political strife erupted in 1969. The IRA is

Bill Cosby and Larry Hagman of "Dallas" are the top television stars of the

"the most successful entertainer in history," and praised runner-up Hagman for 
the "campy finesse" with which he portrays J. R. Ewing. The rest of TV Guide's 
list of 20 top TV personalities of the decade: Oprah Winfrey, Ronald Reagan 
("the first made-for-TV president"), Joan Collins, Ted Koppel, Vanna White, 
David Letterman, Michael J. Fox, Tom Selleck, the California Raisins, Sam 
Donaldson, John Madden, Hulk Hogan, Don Johnson, Dan Rather, Roseanne Barr, 
Morton Downey Jr., ALF and Pee-Wee Herman.. . . . Bugs Bunny, Popeye and Santa 
Claus were on hand, but Mr. Belvedere was a no-show at the Dallas Christmas

AUBURN'S WIN REDUCES FIELD OF CONTENDERS FOR NATIONAL CHAMP TITLE 
</P>

<P>
And then there were four. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn's 30-20 victory over previously unbeaten Alabama dropped the Crimson 
Tide from No. 2 to No. 7 in the rankings and left only four teams in contention 
for college football's national championship: Colorado, Miami, Michigan and 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado remained on top for the second straight week in today's Associated 
Press poll, and Miami rose two spots to second. Michigan remained No. 3 and 
Notre Dame moved up one notch to No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Miami, Michigan and Notre Dame each finished the regular season with one loss; 
Colorado is the only undefeated team in Division I-A. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the New Year's bowl match-ups, those are the only teams with a 
realistic chance to win the national title. Colorado plays Notre Dame in the 
Orange, Alabama meets Miami in the Sugar and Michigan faces 12th-ranked USC in 
the Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado can claim the championship by beating Notre Dame. If Notre Dame wins 
and Miami and Michigan lose, however, the Fighting Irish would almost certainly 
be voted No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Miami, which snapped Notre Dame's 23-game winning streak two weeks ago, needs a 
win over Alabama and a Colorado loss to capture its third national championship 
of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Although Michigan is ranked third, it will be very difficult for the Wolverines 
to finish on top. They need an impressive win over USC, a Miami loss in the 
Sugar Bowl and a close Notre Dame victory in the Orange Bowl to have any 
chance. Even then, the Irish would probably get the nod because they would have 
beaten the No. 1 team and because they defeated Michigan 24-19 at the start of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado received 55 first-place votes and 1,492 of a possible 1,500 points 
from a nationwide panel of sportswriters and broadcasters. Miami got four 
first-place votes and 1,407 points, and Michigan received the other first-place 
vote and 1,374 points. Notre Dame's point total was 1,323. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the Top 10 are Florida State, Nebraska, Alabama, Tennessee, Auburn 
and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State, which has won nine straight since opening the season with two 
losses, moved up one place to fifth after beating Florida 24-17 Saturday. 
Nebraska, which was idle, went from No. 7 to No. 6, Tennessee stayed No. 8 
after defeating Vanderbilt 17-10, Auburn jumped two places to No. 9 after its 
victory over Alabama, and Arkansas fell one spot to No. 10 after a 38-24 win 
over Southern Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois is 11th, followed by USC, Houston, Clemson, Virginia, Texas A&amp;M, 
West Virginia, Penn State, Brigham Young, Duke, Ohio State, Michigan State, 
Hawaii, Pittsburgh and Texas Tech. 
</P>
<P>
Other than Illinois, which dropped one spot, all of those teams held the same 
position as the previous week.

VINCENT EVOKES MEMORY OF GIAMATTI; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: THE NEW COMMISSIONER GREETS OWNERS AND OUTLINES HIS PLANS FOR NEXT 
YEAR.

<P>
Commissioner Fay Vincent, often evoking the memory of Bart Giamatti, outlined 
his ideas for labor negotiations, expansion and player relations today in the 
commissioner's annual winter meetings speech. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent took over as commissioner when Giamatti died in September. He had been 
deputy commissioner for six months. 
</P>
<P>
"I often think of what I have had to enjoy and what Bart has not," Vincent 
said. "He didn't get to his World Series, and he would have loved it. He didn't 
get to make this state-of-the-game address, and I delight in thinking of what 
he might have said." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's most pressing issue is labor negotiations. The agreement with the 
players' association expires on Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
The key issues are salary arbitration, potential changes in free agency and 
revenue sharing. 
</P>
<P>
"Labor negotiations must not become a morality problem, at least not in 
baseball," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a financial issue in which two sides must allocate a scarce resource. 
Nobody wants a work stoppage. Being an optimist, I don't believe there will be 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent also called for a structure that permits a small franchise to compete 
with the larger markets. 
</P>
<P>
A proposed revenue sharing plan would be used for this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal owner Charles Bronfman, whose club lost pitchers Mark Langston, Bryn 
Smith and Pascual Perez to free agency, said his team cannot compete with the 
bigger TV markets. 
</P>
<P>
Just weeks after being named commissioner, Vincent was faced with a major 
crisis when an earthquake hit the Bay Area in the early evening of Oct. 17, 
minutes before Game 3 of the World Series at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent decided to delay the World Series until the area was ready and was 
praised by government officials for his compassion. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a season of high mountains and low valleys," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
The game's lowest point was the ongoing investigation into allegations that 
Cincinnati Manager Pete Rose bet on baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The issue dominated Giamatti's short tenure as commissioner and led to Rose's 
banishment from baseball a week before Giamatti's death. 
</P>
<P>
"Bart's most remembered statement is 'Nobody is bigger than the game,' " 
Vincent said. "I will follow that. 
</P>
<P>
"We must realize that on and off the field, baseball is a game of rules." 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said his plans for the game include an improved drug program, 
expansion, fairness in hiring, and marketing of baseball in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Within 90 days of a labor agreement, the National League will announce a 
definite timetable for the addition of two teams to the National League," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Bart brought me to baseball, and I am simply thrilled to be here," Vincent 
said in concluding his 40-minute speech. "I view the challenges ahead with 
confidence but with some real concern. Baseball is healthy but there is much to 
be done to make it better."
