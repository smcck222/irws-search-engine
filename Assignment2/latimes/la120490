UNCOMMON AMERICAN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Composer Aaron Copland, upon going to France to study, noticed the "Frenchness" 
of the music there. He wondered why, he said later, he heard nothing of the 
Brooklyn streets from whence he came in American classical music. 
</P>
<P>
Copland set out to change that and did so with ferocious success; his music 
worldwide became the quintessence of Great American Music. 
</P>
<P>
The gifted composer created such music by breaking the confines of what most at 
the time considered "serious" music. Serious meant European. But Copland also 
wanted to incorporate some of the exciting new music called jazz coming out of 
the streets of New York, and some of the ragtime rhythms more typically heard 
in the smoky clubs of New Orleans. Copland's compositions rattled the staid 
music Establishment, which considered jazz and untraditional music as low, 
unserious and common. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the majestic horns of "Fanfare for the Common Man" are anything but common. 
The Shaker hymn influence heard in "Appalachian Spring," his ballet for Martha 
Graham, is anything but unserious. And the vitality of the hoedown heard in 
"Billy the Kid" and the Mexican melodies of "El Salon Mexico" are anything but 
low. His fine lesser-known compositions are further testimony to his 
determination not to confine his music to others' boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Copland died this week at age 90. The music he left is an everlasting 
gift, a music that reminds Americans in its very composition of our 
European-ness, our Western-ness, our African-ness, our Latin-ness, our 
common-ness.

U.N. APPROVES MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Deadline Could Speed Up the Timetable" (editorial, Nov. 27): 
</P>
<P>
The hope that the United Nation's resolution, allowing the use of force against 
Iraq, will force Hussein to back down could be futile. Hussein is already boxed 
into a no-win situation. 
</P>
<P>
His only "honorable" way out now is for his enemies to attack, then go down in 
defeat on the field of battle. 
</P>
<P>
We still have another option, time. To allow time for the embargo to rot the 
will and ability of the Iraqi military and people to sustain their position. 
This is really a test of wills between the so-called free world and the 
barbarian, Hussein. Hussein understands this. The question is, do we? 
</P>
<P>
I think many in the military know that pulling "hard time" in the desert is 
better than an "early out" in a body bag. It's too bad that those making our 
decisions aren't faced with the same option.

U.N. APPROVES MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ

<TEXT>
<P>
As reported in The Times, Center for Defense Information's retired Rear Adm. 
Gene R. La Rocque says that the potential for direct military spending on a 
six-month war in the Persian Gulf will be on the order of $80 billion, plus 
tens of thousands of dead and wounded (Part A, Nov. 28). 
</P>
<P>
Why hasn't anyone thought of directing this huge amount of money and effort 
into developing sources of alternative energy so that we can once and for all 
assert our independence from that unpredictable part of the world? 
</P>
<P>
Funds expended for this would be a much better long-term investment in our 
nation's future, while eliminating the personal toll of lost lives and battered 
bodies.

After reading your article, I became ill. When Kenneth Turner said, "My 
religious beliefs are no longer compatible . . . with the Marine Corps . . .," 
I became furious. 
</P>
<P>
It's funny how Turner's beliefs were compatible when the corps was taking care 
of his medical bills, his housing, his opportunities to further his education, 
etc. It appears to me that when the corps benefited Turner, everything was 
compatible, but now that he is asked to do his duty, his beliefs get in the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Having spent five years on active duty in the corps, I am deeply hurt by seeing 
Turner called a Marine. If Turner gets his honorable discharge, it will be a 
slap in the face to all veterans of any service who have done their duty. 
</P>
<P>
P.S. I am still with the Marine Corps Reserve and if called, will do my duty.

COUNSELORS PAY FOR THEMSELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sixty thousand children are expected to skip school today in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. If these youngsters routinely miss classes without 
excuse, an attendance counselor will be assigned to look into the chronic 
absenteeism and get the students back into school. These persistent men and 
women perform a tough and admirable service. But 10 attendance counselors may 
lose their jobs next semester, with a lack of funding again the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting 10 attendance counselors in February will allow the district to avoid 
spending about $300,000 in salaries and benefits. That is money the district 
simply doesn't have in the wake of its recent -- and deep -- budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Individual schools paid for these counselors in past years from federal funds 
earmarked to help poor students or from state funds allocated for integration, 
year-round and special improvement programs. When these discretionary funds 
began to run out, the schools were forced to make tough choices, such as using 
district funds to pay for counselors. Reliance on those scarce funds resulted 
in the district cutting 14 counselors before the start of this school year. 
</P>
<P>
The counselors perform a valuable service. They make home visits, often in very 
tough neighborhoods, and tackle what they find. Sick parents, drug-abusing 
mothers and unemployed fathers are persuaded to send their children to school. 
Immigrant parents are taught that their children can attend public schools 
without charge. Youngsters ashamed of their dirty clothes or lack of a hair cut 
are encouraged to do what they can for themselves and let nothing stop them 
from getting an education. 
</P>
<P>
The district also benefits because the state pays roughly $3,035 per child 
based on average daily enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 counselors who are in jeopardy could get a reprieve. School Supt. Bill 
Anton and some members of the Board of Education, which has the final say on 
the fate of the counselors, are trying to save the positions. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate benefactors should also consider helping out. It surely would be 
cheaper than training undereducated men and women after they are in the labor 
market.

In response to "Marine in Growing Group of Enlisted Objectors," Part A, Nov. 
27: 
</P>
<P>
Why would anyone claim to be a conscientious objector after enlisting in the 
Marine Corp for a six-year period? Don't conscientious objectors search their 
souls before they enlist and accept pay, benefits and training or do they 
accept military life and pray that they are never called to action? I'm proud 
of those who have gone, who are there now, and who may go in the future. Thanks

WHEN THE PILL IS WORSE THAN THE POISON; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENTALISTS WON'T MAKE INROADS ON TOXICS WITHOUT A BELIEVABLE 
ALTERNATIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL MERRILL, Michael Merrill is an assistant professor at the Institute 
of Management and Labor Relations at Rutgers University.

<TEXT>
<P>
The past two decades have been years of apparently phenomenal success for the 
environmental movement. Support for environmental causes has grown rapidly -- 
so rapidly that some enthusiasts have been lulled into believing that they were 
becoming, if they weren't already, a clear majority of the country. After all, 
when even George (Oil Man) Bush, the popularity President, wants to be known as 
an environmentalist, can a majority of the country be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
The rejection of numerous environmental initiatives in the last election 
suggests otherwise. The movement appears to suffer from the "freeze syndrome" 
-- its support is broad but not deep. For years, when push has come to shove on 
the environment, it has proved easier to settle for cosmetic changes rather 
than take any really significant action against polluters. Despite all the 
members and all the money and all the media and all the acts of Congress, the 
environmental movement has failed to achieve its principal goal. Total toxic 
emissions and the concentration of toxic substances in the air, the water and 
on the land, with few exceptions, still continue to increase. 
</P>
<P>
The simple fact is that environmentalism remains overwhelmingly a crusade of 
the well-to-do. According to a recent poll by the Roper Organization, active 
support for environmental initiatives is concentrated in the wealthier and 
most-schooled upper fifth of the population. A little more than half those 
polled were not very concerned about environmental issues, either out of 
conviction or cynicism; and another 26% were inconsistently concerned, 
supporting some environmental causes but not others. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the movement's restricted appeal is not hard to find. 
Initiatives like Proposition 128, "Big Green," in California and the several 
proposals for toxic-use reduction and pollution prevention now pending before 
several state legislatures may strike at the heart of the toxics problem. But 
they also, awkwardly, strike at the heart of the American economy. 
</P>
<P>
A Labor Institute study found that industries in the "toxic economy," which 
either produce or depend on toxic materials, employ 30% of the work force in 
New Jersey, many of whom are among the highest paid and most highly unionized 
production workers in the state. These industries also account for 46% of all 
value added in the manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
The toxic economy plays a similar role in other states. To call for "toxic-use 
reduction" is thus to call for a major transformation in the nature of the 
existing system of production. And to most workers, whether rightly or wrongly, 
it is also to call for the elimination of their jobs. A nontoxic economy might 
create more and better jobs than the current system. But to a highly paid 
worker in the toxic economy, a job in the hand is worth two in the plan. 
Workers prefer the jobs they've got now to the ones they might get later. 
</P>
<P>
It is upon this fact that the environmental movement has been hoisted. Toxic 
industries play such an important part in the U.S. economy, and so many people 
are dependent upon them for their livelihoods, that the environmental movement 
has little or no realistic prospect of significantly reducing the use of toxics 
without offering some believable alternative to the people whose paychecks 
would be directly affected by their proposals. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, the movement ought never again to support specific 
pollution-prevention measures without also insisting on adequately funded 
income guarantees for workers and others who might lose their livelihood as a 
result of any new regulations. The lack of such guarantees was the Achilles' 
heel of "Big Green." This kind of commitment will be difficult to sustain at 
first. It would have required, for example, that environmentalists oppose the 
amended Clean Air Act recently signed by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
But it will pay off in the long run. Working people are the natural allies of 
environmentalists. They know that they are the first to die from exposure to 
hazardous materials on the job. They also know that without a job, they would 
live less well for fewer years. For environmentalism to become a majority 
crusade, it simply must address these economic realities.

PROBLEM: SCARE THE IRAQIS, YOU TERRORIZE THE HOME FOLKS

Saddam Hussein must be confused by the contradictory messages coming from the 
United States. The lead story is the historic U.N. Security Council vote 
authorizing the use of military force if he does not back down before Jan. 15. 
The next news item: Experts testifying before the Senate recommend delaying the 
military option for at least another six months to a year. And now, President 
Bush says he's willing to talk -- but not to compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Is the U.S. threat to use force credible or not? If Hussein considers the 
remarkable U.N. success engineered by President Bush and Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III, he cannot but be impressed that the military option is 
real. When he watches the hearings of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he 
has good reason to doubt that the President has the domestic support needed to 
use force. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's gulf policy is trapped in an almost irreconcilable dilemma. For a threat 
to work it must be credible. That means that the country being threatened must 
be both afraid of what you are going to do and believe that you will actually 
do it. Credible threats are scary threats, by definition. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that scary threats terrify people at home even as they frighten 
the enemy. In a democracy, frightened people quickly get attention. Domestic 
voices, in this case powerful Democrats in Congress, begin to question the 
wisdom of making such a scary threat. Concerned citizens launch protests, 
causing public support to drop. Declining public support erodes the credibility 
of the threat, making it less effective abroad. 
</P>
<P>
There is one way out of this dilemma: Change public opinion and make the public 
more afraid of the enemy than of the threat. This is precisely what the 
Administration has been trying to do lately, with its emphasis on Hussein's 
quest for nuclear weapons and brutal Iraqi war crimes. But unless Hussein helps 
out, doing something provocative and foolish like killing a few hostages or 
initiating a military strike on his own, the President will find it tough 
going. His own experts dispute the likelihood of an early Iraqi nuclear 
capability and public opinion polls indicate that Americans have no stomach for 
being global police; sadly, killing Western hostages might be enough to justify 
the use of force, but killing Kuwaitis is not. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's proposal for a meeting between Baker and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik 
Aziz shows he is capable of a fascinating gamble on the international stage. 
But should that fail, it will be ultimately more telling to watch the President 
play to his toughest audience: the American people.

African-Americans are about 12% of the U.S. population, but they could become 
25% of U.S. casualties in a massive ground conflict with Iraq. This is a bitter 
prospect for those who believe that blacks did more than their fair share of 
the dying in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Even though that belief is mistaken, it has had a powerful effect on public 
attitudes and on military-personnel policy. It caused blacks, along with most 
other Americans, to accept a devil's bargain, the all-volunteer force. 
</P>
<P>
The belief that blacks bore the brunt of battle in Vietnam is not totally 
baseless, however. In 1965 and 1966, blacks were more than 16% of all combat 
deaths and more than 20% of the Army's fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
These figures prompted Martin Luther King Jr. to complain that "we were taking 
the black young men who had been crippled by our society and sending them . . . 
to guarantee liberties in southeast Asia which they had not found in southwest 
Georgia." 
</P>
<P>
King's complaint profoundly affected the body politic, even though many 
leaders, including some prominent civil-rights activists, rebuked him for it. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to correct inequities, the Selective Service System eliminated 
most draft deferments and began conscripting white, middle-class college 
students. This evened out the combat burden so that blacks were roughly 12% of 
U.S. fatalities in Vietnam; but it also turned college campuses into hotbeds of 
anti-war protest. 
</P>
<P>
The all-volunteer force emerged from an unholy alliance of doves and hawks; the 
former opposed the Vietnam War and thus compulsory service, while the latter 
supported the war but avoided battle. Because the all-volunteer force did not 
come into being until 1973, it has not been tested in a major conflict. 
</P>
<P>
For the past decade, African-Americans have constituted around 20% of the 2 
million-plus people on active duty. Their representation varies greatly across 
ranks, services and military occupational specialties. As of mid-1990, blacks 
made up almost 23% of active-duty enlisted personnel but less than 7% of 
commissioned officers. 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of the Vietnam experience, each service now tends to distribute 
combat training roughly in proportion to its own racial composition. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department has not provided detailed information about the makeup 
of units in the Persian Gulf. With more than 200,000 U.S. troops already in 
place and an additional 200,000 scheduled for deployment, however, the force 
probably represents a good cross-section of the total active force. 
</P>
<P>
Statements about battle tactics and body counts are necessarily conjectural. In 
the best-case scenario, Iraq's occupation of Kuwait will be resolved without a 
shot being fired at U.S. forces. In the worst case, the United States and its 
U.N. allies will become involved in a large-scale ground conflict that lasts 
for months and produces thousands of casualties. In the latter scenario, about 
one out of every four U.S. casualties is likely to be black, and about one out 
of every three is likely to be Latino, black, Asian-American or American 
Indian. 
</P>
<P>
Little can be done to alter the composition of the military, at least not 
quickly. Returning to conscription, as some have proposed, would have virtually 
no effect. Draft calls are used to make up for a shortage of volunteers, and in 
recent years the services have seldom run short of volunteers. Under current 
economic conditions, the only sure way to reduce black representation is to 
impose racial quotas. 
</P>
<P>
During the past 15 peacetime years, the all-volunteer force provides benefits 
all around: middle-class youth kept their careers from being sidetracked by 
military service; the poor of all races found opportunities not available in 
civilian society; women proved their mettle in a previously all-male domain; 
the armed forces got good personnel, and political leaders were let off the 
hook, not forced to deal with this nation's enormous social inequities. 
</P>
<P>
If we go to war, however, those benefits will turn into heavy burdens; blacks 
will die in large numbers, legions of Al Sharptons will contrive to turn the 
private grief of their families into public hatred, and the country will suffer 
another season of discontent. 
</P>
<P>
We can alter the terms of our devil's bargain by committing ourselves, as a 
nation, to improving education and employment opportunities for all Americans. 
This is a long-term task, however, requiring greater moral and political 
fortitude than this country's leaders have shown in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, we must deal with the instant case. Those of us who worry 
about a disproportionate combat burden are obliged to exercise special care. 
Expressions of concern must not undermine the morale of our soldiers or give 
false hope to an adversary. No returning black soldier should be made to feel 
that he was a "chump" for having served. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the prospect of a disproportionate combat burden, however 
worrisome, is not sufficient reason to reject what the Bush Administration is 
attempting in the Persian Gulf. As a matter of principle, a policy should not 
be judged solely by the degree to which blacks are involved in its 
execution.Edwin DornROSLIN ARINGTON

AS PADRES WATCH WALLETS, SANTIAGO STUDIES MARKET 
</P>

<P>
The Padres, clutching onto their wallets while swallowing their pride, sat idly 
by Monday watching their counterparts in the National League West strengthen 
themselves with the simple aid of money. 
</P>
<P>
There were the San Francisco Giants signing free-agent center fielder Willie 
McGee to a four-year, $13.25 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
There were the Dodgers immediately counteracting by signing free-agent pitcher 
Kevin Gross to a three-year, $6.4 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
There were even the Atlanta Braves trying to keep pace, signing free-agent 
third baseman Terry Pendleton to a four-year, $10.2 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
And the Padres, you ask, just what did they do to help themselves? 
</P>
<P>
Well, uh, they traded for first baseman/outfielder Oscar Azocar of the New York 
Yankees, and picked up Yankee minor-league pitcher Frank Seminara in the Rule 5 
Draft. 
</P>
<P>
Don't kick yourself for not recognizing the names. Azocar, 25, has spent most 
of the past seven years in the New York Yankees farm system, and was acquired 
for the meager price of a minor-league player to be named later. Seminara, 23, 
pitched for Prince Williams in the Class A Carolina League this past season. 
</P>
<P>
Yep, that's it. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, if the Padres have accomplished anything during the winter meetings, 
they've managed to rid themselves of that burden of being favored to win the 
division this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that will be a problem this year," Padre Manager Greg Riddoch 
said. "You'd have to be crazy to pick us." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who admittedly have voids at third base, shortstop, center field, 
and pitching, never made an offer for McGee. Or Pendleton. Or Gross. Or Darryl 
Strawberry. Or Kirk Gibson. Or. . . 
</P>
<P>
Even with the sudden availability of Giant center fielder Brett Butler, who's 
expected to be declared a new-look free agent this week, the Padres are not 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a nice guy to have around," said Joe McIlvaine, Padre general manager, 
"but I'd rather spend my $15 million some place else. We're just not going to 
spend that kind of money." 
</P>
<P>
But while the Padres are watching their savings fatten in interest-bearing 
accounts, and are slamming their door to any agents with grandeur plans of 
making their clients rich, they might want to pay attention to a certain 
catcher. 
</P>
<P>
His name is Benito Santiago. He has been voted to the past two All-Star games, 
and today, he'll be announced as the winner of his third consecutive Gold Glove 
award along with teammate Tony Gwynn. And if the Padres want to retain his 
services before he escapes on the free-agent market, they better do some 
serious talking. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, Santiago isn't making any threats. There will be no ultimatums. Simply, he 
says, if the Padres don't sign him to a multi-year contract this winter, they 
won't be talking talking to him about another long-term contract until he files 
for free agency after the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
"If they just sign me to a one-year contract this year," Santiago said Monday, 
"that's the last chance they'll get. I'll make them wait until I'm a free 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got the numbers. Look what I've done in my four years. The way I'm going, 
I don't think anyone's going to get the Gold Glove away from me. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year I'm going to do better, and when my free agency comes, oh man." 
</P>
<P>
Santiago, who earned $1.25 million last season, will be eligible for 
free-agency after the 1992 season. The Padres, who took Santiago to an 
arbitration hearing last year, have the same option each of the next two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
'All I know is you don't do to Benny what you did last year," said Scott Boras, 
Santiago's agent, "if you still want him back. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a way to be fair, and a way not to be, and I know what happened last 
year bothered Benny." 
</P>
<P>
Santiago, even though he won his arbitration case when the Padres offered 
$750,000, said that he was upset he had to endure the process. And if he's 
forced to undergo another hearing, he says the Padres will be making a big 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to go through that stuff again," Santiago said. "I want to get it 
settled this time. The best thing would be if they sign me to a multi-year 
contract, but if they don't, well, it's their privilege." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' frugal habits also also figure to cost them the services of first 
baseman Jack Clark, who's expected to be declared a new-look free agent this 
week. The Padres have offered Clark a one-year contract for $2.5 million, and 
have yet to budge. 
</P>
<P>
"If they stay with that position, it would then become a long shot that he'd 
stay," said Tom Reich, Clark's agent. "But I'm not surprised by their posture. 
The Padres have come in with a new ownership group, sweeping management 
changes, and they hired Joe McIlvaine, a top development guy. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why San Diego won't be active in the high-spending market, they want to 
develop." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, while the Padres might be building for the future, they insist they're not 
forsaking this season, and are active in trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres had formal trade discussions with six teams Monday, McIlvaine said, 
and plans to meet with at least four of the teams again, along with the 
Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
* Kansas City Royals: The Padres discussed the possibility of acquiring right 
fielder Danny Tartabull, and also inquired about the availability of 
righthanded reliever Jeff Montgomery and third baseman Kevin Seitzer. 
</P>
<P>
* New York Yankees: They have three available third basemen -- Mike Blowers, 
Randy Velarde and Jim Leyritz. 
</P>
<P>
* Cleveland Indians: Third baseman Brook Jacoby is being shopped. 
</P>
<P>
* Pittsburgh Pirates: They discussed the possibility of swapping third basemen, 
Jeff King for the Padres' Bip Roberts. And because left fielder Barry Bonds was 
the one who brought up the idea of playing for the Padres one day, the Padres 
decided to see if the interest was reciprocal. 
</P>
<P>
* Chicago White Sox: They asked about second baseman/infielder Scott Fletcher, 
but the Padres had nothing of interest for the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
* St. Louis Cardinals: The Padres talked about the availability of propects, 
but again, there seemed to be no match. 
</P>
<P>
* Baltimore Orioles: Shh, keep it a secret, but the Padres would love to have 
Craig Worthington playing third base for them next season, and Oriole Manager 
Frank Robinson raves about Bip Roberts.

CHARGERS ARE SAD JETS HAVE GONE

<P>
How about the New England Patriots? 
</P>
<P>
They're 1-11. That's even worse than the New York Jets, who left San Diego with 
a 4-9 record after the Chargers clubbed them, 38-17, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"If we didn't have the fifth-place schedule, maybe we'd have a chance to play 
New England," Charger Coach Dan Henning said. "But we don't." 
</P>
<P>
So the New York Jets are the next best thing. The Chargers will miss them. 
</P>
<P>
This happened once already this season. The Chargers had lost consecutive games 
to the Houston Oilers and the Pittsburgh Steelers, and then they went East to 
play the Jets on Oct. 14 and won, 39-3. 
</P>
<P>
Losses to the Kansas City Chiefs and the Seattle Seahawks preceded Sunday's 
victory, which kept the Chargers' playoff hopes flickering. The candle will go 
out with one more loss. 
</P>
<P>
Three games remain: the Broncos in Denver, the Chiefs in San Diego and the 
Raiders in Los Angeles. What remains to be seen is whether the Chargers can do 
the same nice things against their remaining opponents as they did against 
their favorite team from New York. 
</P>
<P>
Among the good Sunday was the play of receiver Nate Lewis, who caught four 
passes for 89 yards and scored two touchdowns, and, of course, running back 
Marion Butts, who ran for 159 yards in 26 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Butts also provided a bit of late game excitement when the outcome had been 
decided with his 52-yard run in the fourth quarter. He also gave reporters a 
laugh with his explanation of why he was caught from behind by Jet safety Erik 
McMillan on that run. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a little speed," he said. "McMillan, hey, he's a 4.2 guy." 
</P>
<P>
Butts was told that McMillan actually runs the 40-yard dash in 4.9. 
</P>
<P>
"McMillan?" he said. "Oh, nooooo. No. McMillan is 4.2." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever you say, Marion. Anyway, Butts continues to be the steadiest performer 
on an offense that is still looking for more consistency from its leader, 
quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Tolliver was up and down Sunday, throwing strikes on some occasions 
and missing open receivers on others. 
</P>
<P>
"We think he's coming along," Charger Coach Dan Henning said. "He made plays to 
help us win the game. He made one play that could have cost us dearly, and that 
was waiting too long to throw that ball that was intercepted."

K.C. JONES QUIETLY RETURNS TO BOSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sal Tecce was conducting a tour of the family restaurant the other night when 
he led a visitor into a dining area they call the Street Cafe Room. 
</P>
<P>
"Now this," he said, speaking out the side of his face, "this I don't think 
K.C. will be real excited about. We took the piano out this summer. K.C., he's 
never been here when there wasn't a piano." 
</P>
<P>
The narrow, rectangular room is decked out to resemble a street in Rome. It has 
small tables on raised platforms on either side of the room. The platforms are 
covered in red brick for the look of a sidewalk. Tecce pointed to a spot near 
the center of the room. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where the piano was," he said. "K.C. used to love to sit over there 
after games, have something to eat and sing those songs. He'd sing some 
standards and he'd sing that 'doo-doo-dee-doo' kind of thing like Al Jarreau. 
Cat singing? Scat singing? Whatever, K.C.'s a pretty good singer, pretty damn 
good. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I can get him to sing again even if we don't have the piano no more." 
</P>
<P>
Tecce's Ristorante was opened by Sal's father, Joe, in 1948 on the north side 
of the city, a short distance from the Italian section of town. It's just down 
the street and around the corner from Boston Garden, home of the Celtics since 
they came into the league in the 1946-47 season. 
</P>
<P>
You sit down here with a bowl of pasta and you feel you are in someone's home. 
</P>
<P>
"When he comes by," waitress Annette Fitzgerald said of K.C. Jones, "I know 
exactly what he'll want. He doesn't like garlic much so we make him a special 
dish of shrimp sauteed in lemon and butter with sauteed broccoli on the side. I 
know K.C. Jones, that's what he'll want to eat." 
</P>
<P>
Business is good at Tecce's. Papa started with 10 to 15 tables and he can now 
seat nearly 200. Walls have been knocked out and additional dining rooms added 
as demanded by the ever-increasing clientele. They sell their own sauces and 
memorabilia. A wall near the front door is stacked with merchandise. A small 
sign near the middle says, "Everything on this wall is for sale." 
</P>
<P>
The piano, the centerpiece of the ambience in the Sidewalk Cafe Room, was 
removed in favor of television sets so the diners can watch sports. 
</P>
<P>
As with a lot of other black players who came to Boston, the first day he was 
in town, K.C. Jones went to the home of Hy and Sylvia Horowitz, longtime 
season-ticket holders who helped black players find suitable housing. 
</P>
<P>
Hy Horowitz and a friend would go to sections of Boston where they thought a 
black person might be accepted into a neighborhood. They would inquire about 
rent, then they'd talk to some people who lived there to determine if there 
were any objections. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad loved the Celtics, but he knew about the bigotry around here," said son 
David Horowitz, a close friend of Jones. "He didn't want the players getting 
turned off or getting in trouble by stumbling into the wrong area, so he'd 
scout out places for them." 
</P>
<P>
David Horowitz vividly remembers Jones' first day in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"Like it happened yesterday," he said. "What's there to remember? He came into 
the living room, sat down by the piano, said 'Hello,' then later on when we 
were all through he said 'Goodbye' on the way out. Very quiet. 
</P>
<P>
"I've ridden with him from Boston to New Hampshire in a car where neither of us 
said a word the entire trip. He's a thinker, not a talker." 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, when they talk about K.C. Jones in Boston, his friends mention 
integrity, or dignity. Class. His remaining critics will give him that, but 
they will say he doesn't have the heat in his guts it takes to be a coach. 
</P>
<P>
Too relaxed, too laid back. 
</P>
<P>
It's a popular misconception about K.C. Jones. Arnold "Red" Auerbach 
personified K.C. Jones as a player, and the quote has evolved into a 
description of a whole subsection of player types. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were behind and I put him in," Auerbach said, "when I took him out, we 
were ahead. If we were ahead and I put him in, when I took him out we were 
ahead by more than when I put him in." 
</P>
<P>
Jones the player was like Jones the coach. No flamboyance, he got it done by 
enhancing the play of everyone around him. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't take losses any better than the coaches who smash lockers and throw 
tantrums, he just took them differently. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter was here over Thanksgiving," David Horowitz said, "and after 
dinner we got into a conversation for some reason about the Celtics. She wanted 
to know what this thing was about 'Celtic Pride' and tradition, and I thought 
immediately of K.C. It's a pride in yourself, a pride to do what you know needs 
to be done to make the team as good as it can be. Forget about points and 
rebounds and contracts and all that stuff. Win the game. That's what it's 
about. 
</P>
<P>
"K.C. took losses hard, because he expected to win every time. When he lost a 
game, he thought something was wrong, he didn't feel good. We would have dinner 
planned after a game, and if they lost, there was no discussion, you just went 
straight home. Nobody went out to dinner after losing, are you kidding? 
</P>
<P>
"K.C. was coaching the Bullets when they beat the Celtics in the playoffs, in 
the Garden. We were the last two out of the locker room. We walked out to go to 
Tecce's and there was Charlie Scott and Jo Jo White, leaning on Charlie's 
Mercedes, laughing and joking. K.C. saw that and couldn't believe it. They were 
just beaten at home in the playoffs by a former Celtic and they were happy." 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz, a broker who deals in lumber and building materials, doesn't go to 
games much anymore. Through connections with his father, who attended all but 
11 home games from the time the Garden opened until he died in 1971, David 
Horowitz spent "a good deal of my youth in that building." 
</P>
<P>
He's turned off by the modern athlete, the money, the agents, the personality 
clashes on teams and the players who won't play with minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, David Horowitz will go to his first Celtics game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
K.C. Jones is back in town. 
</P>
<P>
He'll coach against the Celtics again when he brings the Seattle SuperSonics, 
emotionally battered by a triple overtime loss at home Saturday to Portland, 
into the Garden. 
</P>
<P>
This is a tough place to gain coaching recognition, because it's the place 
Auerbach won nine NBA championships, eight of them in a row. Say what you will 
about Yankee Pride or Raiders Mystique, there are few sporting organizations at 
any level that can begin to compare with Celtics tradition in terms of 
long-term dominance in a given sport. 
</P>
<P>
K.C. Jones coached here five seasons after taking the Washington Bullets to the 
playoffs three years in a row. In two of those five Celtics years, he brought 
back championships. 
</P>
<P>
You could walk through the Garden tonight at the Sonics game and ask longtime 
fans about K.C. Jones and they'd tell you while he did a helluva job winning 
two titles, he should have won four. 
</P>
<P>
What's interesting is that of all the ones who have coached the Celtics over 
the years, K.C. Jones has the best winning percentage regular season (308-102, 
.751), and playoffs (65-37, .637), of them all. Better than Bill Fitch, Tom 
Heinsohn, Bill Russell and Auerbach. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight won't be the first time he's coached against the Celtics -- his Bullets 
dethroned defending league champion Boston in the 1975 playoffs. Tonight will 
be the first time he's coached the Sonics against the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
This Sonics team is different. It has no center. If its leading scorer isn't in 
relationship problems, he's in problems related to moving automobile violations 
or excessive drinking or both, problems in bars on the road, or problems 
gaining respect from his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
It is a team with one classic, multi-talented underachieving forward and 
another classic overachieving forward beset by knee operations. It has a 
spectacular outside shooter from Boston College no taller than most high school 
guards, and is a team with an absolute unpolished gem of a point guard nobody 
wants to see turned in the wrong direction by this collection of One Flew Over 
The Cuckoos Nest All-Stars. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries and off-court problems last year kept the Sonics teetering on the 
precipice that separated consistency and chaos. For spurts, they played well 
and with promise, then they'd lose a player for a few weeks to an injury or 
someone would fall in a slump or Dale Ellis would be arrested again. 
</P>
<P>
K.C. Jones came into situations in Washington and Boston where most of the 
talent was in place, and required only focusing. With the Sonics, most of the 
talent is not in place and the focusing will come after they get the picture on 
the right channel. 
</P>
<P>
His system is very simple and is reliant on players working together to develop 
trust and belief in each other. While he's trying to do that, Xavier McDaniel 
and Dale Ellis engaged in a serious fist fight on the street in front of the 
team's office just a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Players came into the season hearing and reading stories everywhere about being 
traded. Instead of settling down and letting the system develop, the Sonics 
have been mostly unable to break their old habits, like junk food addicts 
living on a farm with vegetarians. 
</P>
<P>
This is a team that belongs in the NBA all right, the Neurotic Basketball 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
Getting the Bullets to the playoffs was a coaching challenge. Continuing the 
Celtics reign of success was a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
This though, is the career coaching challenge for K.C. Jones, a spot of calm in 
an ocean of chaos. 
</P>
<P>
This one needs to be revisited. In the 1974-75 playoffs, the K.C. Jones-coached 
Washington Bullets beat defending league champions Boston, then lost four in a 
row to the Golden State Warriors in the championship series. In the closing 
minutes of the second game, the Bullets were down by two points when Jones 
called a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
Jones learned from Auerbach that coaches do their coaching in practice. On game 
nights, it's the players' turn to earn their paychecks. Auerbach would lean 
into a huddle during a timeout and say, "Run the A play." That was it. You 
never saw Red Auerbach with a chalkboard diagramming a play. 
</P>
<P>
Jones was the same way. In that game against the Warriors, Jones and his 
then-assistant Bernie Bickerstaff discussed the play. Jones called a C play, a 
simple play run off a pick and roll, a play they had run hundreds of times 
during the season. 
</P>
<P>
Bickerstaff asked if he should diagram the play, and Jones, thinking it might 
help the players focus, said, "Sure, go ahead." 
</P>
<P>
The next thing viewers saw on national television was Bickerstaff furiously 
diagramming a play in a critical timeout with K.C. Jones standing by silently 
and impassively. Television announcers questioned why an assistant would be 
diagramming a play and why it was necessary to diagram one at all in this 
circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
Jones took an avalanche of criticism after that game. Papers said he was 
unprepared, that he needed Bickerstaff to do his coaching for him and that he 
was unprofessional. 
</P>
<P>
A year later he got them back to the playoffs, but when the Bullets didn't win 
a title. he was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Then came five years with the Celtics, a decision by Jones to resign from 
coaching and take a Boston front office job he later found boring. He came back 
last year to assist Bickerstaff, his former assistant, in Seattle, and now he 
has his own team again, Team Chaos. 
</P>
<P>
The Sonics season isn't 15 games old yet and people, some of them on the team, 
are wondering how this can work with K.C. Jones, the professor of unity, in 
charge of a disorganized, disbelieving cast of characters. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping in mind his placid exterior, they ought to look up his record. If nice 
guys only finish last, K.C. Jones is the exception to the rule, because 
wherever he's been, all he ever did was win.

Charger Coach Dan Henning said he would consider asking nose tackle Joe 
Phillips to come back off injured reserve if the Chargers are still in the 
playoff hunt when they play the Raiders in the season finale. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips has been on injured reserve since he was assaulted in Mission Beach on 
Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips has been working out at the stadium the past several weeks. Henning 
said he hasn't yet received word on when Phillips will be cleared by doctors to 
play football. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie tight end Derrick Walker has been more than adequate as a replacement 
for Joe Caravello, who is out for the rest of the season with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
"You would have no idea . . . that this guy is a rookie," Henning said. "He has 
played the way you would expect a veteran to play at that spot." 
</P>
<P>
Rookie cornerback Donald Frank, who was beaten badly on a 37-yard pass from Ken 
O'Brien to Rob Moore in the fourth quarter of Sunday's victory over the Jets, 
may have to put in some extra time in front of the chalk board this week. 
Henning said Frank should have covered the outside on that pattern, but instead 
went toward the middle of the field where he would have had help from the 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to go back and lay the law down and tell him what the philosophy of 
that particular coverage is," Henning said. DON PATTERSON

COMING AWAKE TO THE MEANING OF SLEEP;

<P>
ASLEEP IN THE FAST LANE: THE IMPACT OF SLEEP ON WORK BY LYDIA DOTTO WILLIAM 
MORROW &amp; CO. $21.95, 352 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In "Asleep in the Fast Lane," Canadian science writer Lydia Dotto lists three 
modern curses that blur the line between night and day. The first, jet lag, had 
me wide awake recently at 4 a.m., so I turned on the lights (the second curse) 
and an all-news radio station in time to hear that Chrysler was about to start 
a 24-hour work schedule (the third curse). 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing experts were warning Chrysler that running a plant around the 
clock might strain the machinery. No sleep experts, however, spoke up for the 
workers whose body clocks could be wrecked by such a schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"Asleep in the Fast Lane" isn't so much about why sleepy people shouldn't 
operate machinery as it is about how we can control that third of our lives we 
spend asleep so that we are alert when we are awake. Dotto opens "Asleep in the 
Fast Lane" dramatically, taking her readers to Toronto's Defence and Civil 
Institute of Environmental Medicine, where she volunteered for an experiment in 
staying awake for 50 hours. Then, with firsthand knowledge of how sleep 
deprivation can wreak physical and psychological havoc, Dotto explores the 
phenomenon of sleep in the context of sleep medicine. 
</P>
<P>
That we dream during REM sleep (so-called because it can be detected by Rapid 
Eye Movement) is no new finding. However, a recently-discovered sleep disorder 
is characterized by a cessation of the normal paralysis that occurs during REM 
sleep, so that the sleeper actually acts out the dream, even to the point of 
homicide. 
</P>
<P>
Dotto tells us about circadian rhythm (a term derived from the Latin circa 
(about) and dies (day), our biological clocks that follow a 24-hour cycle, and 
the subtle rhythms within the cycle that include mini-sleep/wake cycles. She 
verifies what many of us have long suspected, that we work better at certain 
times of day than others. These high and low points correlate with the fact 
that both the Chernobyl and Three-Mile Island accidents occurred around 4 a.m., 
as do a disproportionate number of automobile crashes. 
</P>
<P>
Shift workers, jet pilots who zip through time zones, and astronauts in space 
labs work without regard to the rising and setting of the sun. But the human 
body has not kept up with human ingenuity. There have been instances, Dotto 
tells us, when whole crews in jet airplanes have fallen asleep in the cockpit 
and overflown their destination. 
</P>
<P>
The solution to the hazards of nontraditional work shifts may be to return to 
ancient sleep habits. Many mammals take short naps round the clock. Others, 
like apes, nap after lunch. Can naps make workers more efficient? Apparently 
they can, for some people, and in the proper dosage. But how can we be sure a 
worker is rested and alert? 
</P>
<P>
Dotto describes one solution, a device developed for Transport Canada for 
possible use by air traffic controllers. SQUID (Superconducting Quantum 
Interference Detector) is a helmet-like device with 60 sensors that monitors 
magnetic brain activity and can sound an alert should the worker doze off. This 
could herald a new directive in the workplace: sleep management. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of monitoring someone's brain waves has overtones of Big Brother and 
would probably be a hard sell. But it is not very different from urinalysis for 
drug detection, which is now mandatory in many jobs that put the lives of other 
people at risk. 
</P>
<P>
Dotto's research is far-ranging. She tells us that for a long-distance racing 
sailor, a few minutes sleep at regular intervals spelled success. Are we to 
conclude that catnapping in order to sustain high performance is good for all 
of us? Should we sleep more or less? One researcher she quotes says that "most 
people in industrialized societies suffer from chronic partial sleep 
deprivation." Another says "the average sleeper can reduce his or her sleep by 
about 1 1/2 to 2 hours . . . without suffering." 
</P>
<P>
Whom should we believe? Dotto doesn't say. The wealth of her research is 
diminished by repetition and by her refusal to evaluate often contradictory 
research. But her message is basically a sound one: Since we are developing new 
sleep patterns in a world increasingly removed from the dictates of nature, we 
ought to know what we are doing so we don't fall "Asleep in the Fast Lane."

JETS COLLIDE ON DETROIT RUNWAY; 8 DIE, 22 HURT

<P>
Two Northwest Airlines jets collided on a fog-shrouded runway at Detroit 
Metropolitan Airport Monday as one accelerated for takeoff, igniting a cabin 
fire in one plane that killed eight passengers and injured 22 others. 
</P>
<P>
All of the casualties were aboard a Pittsburgh-bound DC-9, which burst into 
flames after it was clipped by a Boeing 727 accelerating for liftoff on its 
flight to Memphis, Tenn., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers from the DC-9 used emergency chutes or jumped from the wing and took 
refuge on a slush-covered runway infield as flames quickly ravaged the cabin, 
stripping off its roof and blackening the entire upper length of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
The collision, which came just two weeks before the airline industry's peak 
holiday travel season, occured near the site of the second-worst air crash in 
U.S. history. On Aug. 16, 1987, a Northwest MD-80 crashed on takeoff, killing 
154 people on board and two on the ground. A 4-year-old girl was the only 
survivor of that crash. 
</P>
<P>
A Northwest spokesman said that the collision occurred shortly after 1:45 p.m. 
near Concourse A of the airport, in suburban Romulus, about 10 miles west of 
Detroit. The DC-9 was carrying 39 passengers and four crew members, while the 
727 had 146 passengers and a 10-member crew aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Both Northwest officials and federal aviation authorities indicated that pilot 
confusion and thick fog and slush-slickened runways may have played roles in 
the collision. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest officials said that the right wing of the 727, almost airborne as it 
roared down one runway, struck the right fuselage of the DC-9, which had 
clearance to fly to Pittsburgh and was taxiing toward another runway. 
</P>
<P>
The 727's wing sliced through the DC-9 just below cabin level and severed at 
least one of its engines, igniting the fire, Northwest officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fog made visibility difficult," said Northwest spokesman Robert Gibbons. 
The spokesman said that the collision "appeared to have been head-on -- based 
on the right wing striking the right fuselage." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Assn. said that early 
reports from the scene indicated that "the DC-9 pilot became lost on the 
runways." 
</P>
<P>
The controllers' spokesman, Tom Dresden, said that "the (DC-9) pilot gave the 
ground controller erroneous information about his position and turned right 
onto the runway where the 727 was taxiing. The DC-9 pilot discovered at the 
very last moment where he was, and so the ground controller told him to 
immediately get off that runway, but it was too late." 
</P>
<P>
Northwest officials acknowledged that visibility was hampered by the fog -- 
preventing pilots from seeing more than a quarter-mile in front of them, 
according to National Weather Service accounts. A snowstorm had passed through 
the Detroit area earlier in the day, but by midday, precipitation had stopped 
and temperatures rose above the freezing point, leaving the airport draped in 
fog. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne County Executive Edward McNamara said that the weather was "a very 
serious factor" in the collision. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers aboard both planes said they heard a thunderous noise as the two 
planes collided. Joe Izzo, 41, an engineer who was dozing aboard the DC-9 on 
route from South Bend, Ind., to Pittsburgh, thought that the engine had blown 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a thud and I heard a blast," said Izzo, who had been sitting in the 
sixth row of the plane. "I felt shrapnel fly past my head. I looked to my right 
and saw flames and heard people screaming. People panicked and were running for 
the front of the plane." 
</P>
<P>
On his way to the front of the cabin, Izzo said, he saw at least two passengers 
fatally burned by the fast-spreading fire. "I saw people whose fingertips were 
melted off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Izzo said he and several other passengers kicked out the emergency door above 
the left wing. The passengers then began tumbling out onto the pavement. Izzo 
managed the fall without injury. He said he turned back to the plane to help 
others who had injured themselves and were sprawled in the slush. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing further explosions, Izzo and an off-duty stewardess, Kay Bolin, helped 
injured DC-9 passengers get away from the burning wreckage. "We kept hearing 
hissing sounds, so we kept pulling them back farther from the plane," Izzo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On the 727, filled to capacity with passengers, Robert Karp, 60, a marketing 
professor at Jackson State University in Jackson, Miss., heard a noise that 
sounded "like we had a tire blown out." Several seconds later, over the plane's 
loudpeaker, the pilot advised "everybody to stay in their seats. Everything is 
OK." 
</P>
<P>
But a private pilot sitting across the aisle from him, Karp said, looked out 
the window and shouted: "Geez, we hit another plane. Half our left wing is 
gone! Jet fuel is just pouring out!" 
</P>
<P>
Rod Nacker of Sterling Heights, Mich., another passenger aboard the 727, said 
that it appeared that the 727's pilot "didn't even see the other plane. The 
other plane was in a lot worse condition than ours. We were losing a lot of 
aviation fuel. They foamed both planes. We couldn't see out the windows." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their anxiety, passengers waited in the cabin another 15 to 20 minutes, 
Karp said, while emergency vehicles sprayed foam on the fuel. They then exited 
from the rear of the plane, descending on portable steps. 
</P>
<P>
He complimented the crew for keeping the plane under control. "It was very 
calm," Karp said. "I don't think we realized how lucky we were until we got off 
the plane and saw the other aircraft. We saw smoke billowing up and we saw the 
midsection with the top blown off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly an hour after the accident, smoke continued to pour from the DC-9's 
fuselage and from a jagged slit where the roof of the cabin had been. By dusk, 
as the already overcast sky grew dark, emergency workers wheeled in a mammoth 
bank of portable lights to provide illumination for firefighters, 
investigators, paramedics and medical examiners. 
</P>
<P>
The airport was closed for about two hours after the accident. The airport had 
already been closed to inbound traffic when the crash occurred, aviation 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Driving in heavy rain squalls, ambulances ferried at least 22 passengers to 
three hospitals in Detroit and Ann Arbor. Two passengers with severe burns were 
taken to the University of Michigan Medical Center's burn unit at Ann Arbor. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the deaths and injuries appeared to have been caused by fire and toxic 
fumes, authorities said. At least 15 people were taken to Annapolis Hospital in 
Wayne. Three were discharged, one was admitted in critical condition with a 
crushed lung and three others were being treated in the emergency room for 
burns, broken bones, lacerations and bruises, according to hospital officials. 
</P>
<P>
Four other crash victims were taken to Heritage Hospital in neighboring Taylor. 
One patient had lower back pain, another had an ankle injury and a third 
required a partial finger amputation. The condition of the fourth was not 
released. All four were in stable condition, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
National Transportation Safety Board investigators, en route from Washington to 
Detroit, said they will analyze tape recordings of cockpit conversations as 
well as all communications between federal air traffic controllers in the tower 
and planes on the ground and in the air around the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"Planes are not supposed to move on the ground unless air traffic controllers 
say they can," said NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz. "The tower has direct 
control." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were arriving already well-apprised about the danger of 
ground-based collisions. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, the board placed the issue high on its list of "most wanted" 
safety improvements, urging quick steps to prevent such collisions. Aviation's 
worst disaster was just such an accident. Two Boeing 747s, one operated by Pan 
Am and the other by the Dutch airline KLM, collided in fog on a runway at 
Tenerife in the Canary Islands in 1977, killing 581 people. 
</P>
<P>
Flights to Detroit from Los Angeles International Airport were halted briefly 
Monday afternoon until aviation officials determined that they could again 
proceed safely. All Detroit-bound planes were kept on the ground until 12:31 
p.m.

HOUSE GOP VOTE DEALS BLOW TO GINGRICH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a sharp setback for combative Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and 
hard-line conservatives, House Republicans Monday rejected his candidate for 
the No. 3 leadership post and reelected a moderate Californian, Rep. Jerry 
Lewis (R-Highland), after a bitter contest that left deep divisions in GOP 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
The usually affable and soft-spoken Lewis, who defeated Rep. Carl D. Pursell 
(R-Mich.) by a surprisingly large margin of 98 to 64, declared the outcome a 
"disaster" for Gingrich and two of his close allies who tried to oust Lewis as 
chairman of the House Republican Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"Their purpose was not to help Carl Pursell but to dump Jerry Lewis," snapped 
Lewis, who said that Reps. Duncan L. Hunter (R-Coronado) and Vin Weber 
(R-Minn.) were "designated deputies" by Gingrich in the campaign against him. 
</P>
<P>
In another implied rebuff for Gingrich, who earlier this year led the revolt 
against the first budget package endorsed by President Bush, Minority Leader 
Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) expressed deep concern that the 167-member House GOP 
group not become a "battleground" where Republicans snipe at each other or 
attack Bush and his Cabinet members. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' victory indicates that the President will have smoother working 
relations with Congress than he would have otherwise, because Pursell made 
clear that he would carry on a fight against both new taxes and new spending if 
he was victorious. 
</P>
<P>
It also gave Lewis a strong vote of confidence if, as many Republicans expect, 
he opposes Gingrich for the Republican leader's job when Michel, 67, eventually 
steps down from the post he has held for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
But another candidate backed by Gingrich in a hard-fought race -- Rep. Guy 
Vander Jagt (R-Mich.) -- decisively won his campaign for reelection as chairman 
of the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee over Rep. Don 
Sundquist (R-Tenn.) by a vote of 98 to 66. 
</P>
<P>
The House GOP campaign fund-raising organization under Vander Jagt's direction 
was accused by Sundquist of making improper financial arrangements with 
consultants and polling organizations and getting unsatisfactory results. 
Vander Jagt promised to review the complaints and make changes, if warranted. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, who was reelected without opposition to his No. 2 position in the GOP 
hierarchy, insisted that the Lewis-Pursell contest was not a referendum on him 
or his followers. "I am for Jerry Lewis in some elections and against him in 
others," Gingrich said. "The conference voted for the established leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.), a Gingrich deputy whip, acknowledged that the 
anti-Lewis campaign did not suit the mood of most Republicans. "More than 
anything, they want to unify our party, and you never unify with purges," 
Gunderson told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast with the sharp infighting among Republicans, House Democrats 
reelected Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and their other leaders by 
acclamation as they organized for the 102nd Congress that will convene in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats netted a gain of nine seats in the November elections while the 
Republicans suffered a net loss of 10. One independent, Bernard Sanders, 
defeated a GOP representative in Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
In one major change, Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento) was tapped to be the new 
chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in advance of the 
1992 elections. 
</P>
<P>
On the GOP side, Republican leader Michel tried to smooth over the differences 
between the forces backing Gingrich and those who lined up with Lewis in the 
divisive battle. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that his party has 101 fewer members than the opposition, Michel urged 
the Republicans to work with President Bush because he can give them more 
leverage by using his veto power to influence the shape of legislation in the 
Democratic-controlled Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"I must confess to having deep concerns when we spend our time sniping at each 
other, at the President or at members of our Administration," Michel said. "It 
can be a total disaster if we don't recognize that, outnumbered as we are, we 
have to work together to achieve a unity of purpose."

'YOU'RE GOING TO DIE ANYWAY. WHY WORRY?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Annie Robertson turned 85, her life insurance company sent her a check she 
hadn't asked for, cashing out the small policy she had bought to pay for her 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
That was two years ago. But Robertson is still a little miffed about collecting 
before she really needs the money. 
</P>
<P>
You see, Robertson and her good friend Marion Holloman, 83, don't plan on dying 
any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
And they have paid no attention to a widely publicized study asserting that 
human beings shouldn't expect to live healthy, rewarding lives beyond about age 
85. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to see 100, if not more," Holloman says with a smile, echoing a goal 
frequently mentioned by others who have reached the big Eight-Oh. 
</P>
<P>
But Holloman, Robertson and other people in their 80s generally agree with the 
study's contention that later years should be independent, active years. The 
quality of life, they say, is more important than maintaining life at any cost. 
In this they speak from experience, having seen friends or relatives linger in 
hospitals and nursing homes, unable to enjoy even the simplest pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
"She just sits there," a woman named Ann told a senior citizens discussion 
group the other day, referring to a 94-year-old friend in a nursing home. "That 
to me is terrible. . . . I told my doctor, 'If I ever get that way I hope you 
put me to sleep.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ann, a spry woman who asked not to be further identified, struck a nerve, 
drawing nods of agreement from those gathered around the table at the Hollywood 
Senior Citizens Multipurpose Center. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson, whose 83-year-old sister is confined to a nursing home because of a 
stroke, wouldn't want to live that way either. "Close my eyes and let me go," 
she says. "I'm not afraid of death." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a professed fear of dying seems notably absent among people in their 
80s, including Robertson and Holloman, who were interviewed at the George and 
Helen Thomas Senior Citizens Center in the West Adams area. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to die anyway. Why worry about it?" asked Holloman, who spends 
about six hours a day on volunteer activities at the center and elsewhere. "I 
think about living every morning." 
</P>
<P>
Holloman is not an exception. People in their ninth decade apparently believe 
that the best life is a busy life. Very few are health fanatics or food 
faddists but they credit a full schedule with adding meaning to their lives and 
keeping their minds off minor aches and pains. 
</P>
<P>
Some also believe that having long-lived parents is a help. But more often, 
they feel that volunteer work, church groups and other diversions combat both 
loneliness and physical deterioration and extend life span. 
</P>
<P>
"I am pretty lonely," says 82-year-old Howard Barker, whose wife died in 1985. 
Now, Barker, a rare smoker among the elderly, spends three days a week playing 
the piano and helping out at the day-care program for seniors operated by the 
Hollywood center. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives me something to do," he explains. "I have my weekly program now. On 
Monday I do my laundry. Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays I am here and 
Fridays my cleaning woman comes. On Saturdays and Sundays I go out for dinner." 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood resident Sally Marks, an 80-year-old widow, has been doing 
volunteer work with senior citizens since 1969 and now comes to the Hollywood 
center five days a week as a volunteer in the lunch programs.

"I keep very busy," she says. "I travel by bus to come here every day and I 
walk many blocks. My doctor says my activity is as important as the medication 
I take for my heart . . . . I forget myself for a while. It's when you get home 
that you remember things, like your shoulder hurts." 
</P>
<P>
She adds, "I could sit around the house and watch stupid soap operas . . . . I 
think that's the main thing, keep active -- keep active and keep involved." 
</P>
<P>
But not all develop strategies for filling time's void, especially following 
the death of a spouse. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Selnick, 86, who lives in the Mid-Wilshire District, says he often feels 
at loose ends since the death of his wife 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my worst trouble, time on my hands because there's nobody on my arm," 
he says. "Sometimes I can't sleep, I walk the streets at night." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it seems no one reaches their 80s without being marked by personal 
sorrow. Holloman and Robertson say the deaths of their husbands were severe 
emotional blows. 
</P>
<P>
Holloman, whose husband died in 1959, also lost two of her six children, one 
murdered during a robbery and the other dying of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
"There are things in life that you have no control over," she said. " . . . You 
learn to accept it no matter how badly you feel." 
</P>
<P>
Robertson, whose husband died in 1970, says, "It was very tough on me. . . . I 
did get myself together through the help of God." 
</P>
<P>
The two women, who maintain close ties with their children, say that their 
religious faith and family bonds have been mainstays in times of personal 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"I had family support at all times," Holloman says. "Love is what has helped me 
carry through. It really is." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone relies on this combination. Barker's only son lives in 
Anchorage, Alaska, so he doesn't see him or his two grandchildren very 
frequently. 
</P>
<P>
"If they were living anywhere but Alaska, I would go and live there but I don't 
want to live in Alaska," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does he fall back on religion. "I was brought up very religious but I don't 
believe in religion at all anymore," he says. "When you're dead, you're dead." 
</P>
<P>
Besides personal loss, bouts of illness have often scarred their lives. 
However, as long as they're not incapacitated, they learn to cope with the 
inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Marks is blind in her left eye from a combination of glaucoma and 
cataracts. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever shape they are in at 80, many acknowledge that reaching that age seems 
to mark a dividing line. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds old when I have to tell people my age," says Reva Mullins, a 
volunteer at the Hollywood center who turned 80 in July. "I think I'm doing 
great for an old lady. I think I feel like about 60 or 65."

While science strives to achieve the glamorous goal of increasing our life 
span, most researchers studying aging are concerned with a more practical 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Do we really want to live longer? 
</P>
<P>
According to a group of researchers who study the consequences of being old, 
living longer might be of little value unless the extra years are healthy and 
active. 
</P>
<P>
Despite recent gains in life expectancy caused by lower death rates from heart 
problems and other major fatal diseases, many of the nation's elderly are 
troubled by generally nonfatal ailments and disabilities during their final 
years, gerontologists say. These conditions include Alzheimer's disease, 
blindness, deafness, arthritis, osteoporosis, diabetes, hypertension, 
incontinence and physical frailty. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the things that, for the most part, don't kill us. But they make 
life difficult in old age," says medical demographer S. Jay Olshansky of the 
Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. "If you ask people what stops them 
from enjoying life in old age, many are going to say those diseases." 
</P>
<P>
Olshansky is co-author of a recent study published in Science magazine that 
asks if efforts to expand life should continue without equal emphasis on making 
the last years quality years. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have made astounding gains in the past decade in understanding the 
process of aging, giving rise to hopes that they might someday postpone its 
effects through genetic engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Another arm of longevity research concerns eradicating the major killers -- 
such as cancer and heart disease -- to reduce death rates and prolong life. 
Advances in heart disease treatment have already led to gains in life 
expectancy over the past two decades, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
But, Olshansky says: "What I worry about is if we are successful in identifying 
what causes us to age, if we find an anti-aging drug or find a way to 
manipulate genes, then we are faced with the social problem of whether we 
really want to do that. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can extend life expectancy by 10 years or 20 years, we need to be 
assured that the additional years of life are healthy years. If we are adding 
30 years of crippling disease, then I don't think we should do it." 
</P>
<P>
The question is not merely philosophical. Policy-makers are increasingly 
interested in understanding the future impact on health care and Social 
Security as the baby-boom population turns the corner on middle age. 
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that the portion of the population age 65 and older will 
increase from 12% today to 22.9% in 2050. The number of Americans age 85 and 
older will increase from 3 million today to 16 million by the middle of the 
21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has allocated $323 million to the National Institute on Aging in 
Washington for fiscal year 1991 for new research and programs on aging, up 
nearly 30% from 1990 -- the largest percentage increase in funding this year 
among the federal health institutes. 
</P>
<P>
"There hasn't been that much funding for quality-of-life research in the last 
20 years. But that's beginning to happen now," says Dr. Edward L. Schneider, 
dean of USC's Andrus Gerontology Center. "The Medicaid bills, the health care 
bills, are going to drive us up the wall. So maybe we should start investing 
now in the quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
Shifting the emphasis in research from simply lengthening life to increasing 
years of health is the goal of a growing number of researchers. One reason, 
some say, is that we may be close to reaching the cap on how far we can push 
our life span. 
</P>
<P>
In last month's Science article, Olshansky and co-authors Bruce A. Carnes and 
Christine Cassel use statistics to show that even if the major fatal diseases 
were eliminated, life expectancy would not increase by much. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, eliminating all forms of cancer, which cause about one-fifth of 
all deaths in the United States, would increase life expectancy at birth by 
only 3.17 years for females and 3.2 years for males. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, U.S. females born in 1989 can expect to live until age 78.6, while 
males can expect to reach age 71.8. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if our goal is (only) to increase life expectancy, then I don't think 
we're going to be very successful," Olshanksy says. "Even if we go after major 
diseases, we'll only make incremental gains." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he asks, even if cancer and heart disease were eliminated, would the 
elderly enjoy life if encumbered by weakened bones and muscles, dementia and 
hearing loss? 
</P>
<P>
"The question is what are we replacing (death) with?" he says. "It is possible, 
as cancer and heart disease deaths decline, as we make this progress, that we 
may be about to trade longer life for worsening health." 
</P>
<P>
Already, medicine's successful efforts to reduce deaths from heart disease and 
some types of cancer have raised questions about how to live with chronic 
illness, Olshansky says. 
</P>
<P>
"Forty years ago, if you have a heart attack or stroke you wouldn't live very 
long," he says. "But science is rampantly transforming those diseases into 
chronic problems." 
</P>
<P>
Virtually no researchers advocate halting research on extending life span, 
either at the gene-tinkering level or among those working to cure the major 
fatal diseases. But with limited funds available for the study of aging, 
setting priorities for research becomes a sticky issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think money should be taken away from cancer and heart disease," 
Olshansky says. "Those are major contributors to morbidity and mortality. But 
we think it is now time to give equal attention to the other nonfatal 
diseases." 
</P>
<P>
In a 13-year study of elderly people completed in 1981, USC gerontologist 
Eileen M. Crimmins found that her subjects reported a wide range of 
disabilities marring their later years. 
</P>
<P>
"Our conclusion has been that the increase in life expectancy has been in what 
we call 'disabled years of life,' " she says. "The person says they have some 
kind of medical condition that prevents them from leading their normal life. 
But these appear to be conditions that might not be too serious. . . . For the 
most part, it's mild disability." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, because these conditions can hamper one's ability to enjoy life, 
researchers are seeking ways to eliminate them. Crimmins is optimistic that 
this is possible, as the emphasis in health care moves from treating diseases 
to preventing them. 
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown that a good diet, stress reduction, aerobic and 
weight-bearing exercise and companionship can help the elderly stave off 
chronic ailments and remain active and happy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's where much more research is being concentrated: delaying the 
onset of disease," Crimmins says. "We've just arrived at the idea that elderly 
people can be rehabilitated" after injury or surgery. 
</P>
<P>
But in setting priorities for research on aging, society should not attempt to 
determine just what kind of life is worth extending, says Richard Suzman, a 
scientist at the National Institute on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important to realize that, while we all have a sense of what 
quality of life means, ultimately it's a very subjective measure that differs 
across groups and individuals," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Before deciding to fund expensive scientific research, he adds, federal health 
officials must weigh the potential benefits of the research against the costs. 
But, Suzman says that it would be wrong to stop pursuing longer life expectancy 
based on the belief that those extra years would not be worth living because of 
pain, disability or dementia. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that one could make a bad mistake if we adopted some federal 
(standard) that defines quality of life."

BIOLOGISTS CALEB FINCH AND MICHAEL ROSE ARE TACKLING THE ISSUE FROM DIFFERENT 
APPROACHES, BUT BOTH AGREE THAT AGING CAN BE POSTPONED.

Life does not have to end at 85, or 100, or even 120. So says a small but elite 
group of researchers exploring the possibility of increasing our life span. 
</P>
<P>
"Aging is no longer regarded as a monolith; an unmovable frontier," says USC 
biologist Caleb E. Finch. Finch believes in using common good-health practices 
like eating right and exercising to control our environment and exploit the 
"plasticity" of life span. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably, with existing technology, don't have to invent anything new to 
get to the heart of biological aging," he says. "I'm highly optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Rose of UC Irvine suggests the key to longer life lies in evolution and 
is studying a link between delayed reproduction and increased longevity in 
fruit flies. 
</P>
<P>
"We have all the basic science to postpone human aging right now," he says. 
"And I have a plan for doing it." 
</P>
<P>
The two researchers are old friends and colleagues who take very different 
approaches to the problem but reach the same conclusion: 
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy is not capped by some unyielding force. 
</P>
<P>
Their beliefs ignore the traditional consensus among researchers that life 
expectancy is controlled by an inevitable breakdown of body processes. In a 
recent article in Science magazine, scientists suggest that natural 
degeneration caps our life span at about 85 years. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, no one knows how to dramatically increase how long we can live. But in 
recent years, scientists have moved away from believing that aging is the 
result of a single gene that goes awry late in life. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they believe theories that suggest aging is the result of many 
processes, linked to genes and the environment, working to wear down the body. 
These newer theories raise the possibility of intervening to stop the chain of 
events that cause aging. 
</P>
<P>
"It's now a question of whether people want to (pursue) this," Rose says. 
</P>
<P>
Finch and Rose have produced some of the most powerful evidence of the 
potential to extend the life span. And each has a new book that makes a strong 
case for going after the fountain of youth. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, an evolutionary biologist, is the leading proponent of a theory of aging 
based on evolution. 
</P>
<P>
With a youthful face and punk hair, Rose looks as if he would be more at home 
on MTV than on the seventh floor of the UCI Engineering Building. But he has 
turned many skeptics into supporters in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of his book, "Evolutionary Biology of Aging" (1991, Oxford 
University Press), "is to argue that aging can now be regarded as a problem 
that is well on its way toward a scientific solution." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are more interested than ever in the longevity question because of 
recent success by Rose and others with experiments that have shown the life 
span can be extended in lab animals. 
</P>
<P>
In experiments on fruit flies, worms and mice, it's "very easy for us to . . . 
postpone aging so that life span can be doubled or the pattern of deterioration 
with aging can be vastly slower," Rose says. 
</P>
<P>
The experiments focus on finding which genes are important to the aging process 
in order to manipulate them. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, for instance, is studying whether aging can be influenced by manipulating 
the process of natural selection -- the force of nature that favors the young 
(who can reproduce) far more than the old. 
</P>
<P>
Rose says his studies show that the age at which a species reaches maturity -- 
and is able to reproduce -- is linked to the onset of aging. That means that 
the way to keep natural selection working later in life is to postpone 
reproduction until a relatively advanced age. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 15 years, Rose has bred fruit flies at later and later ages -- 
increasing their life span by 80%. He is selecting as parents only older flies 
that can pass on longevity genes. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have delayed reproduction and increased life span in other species, 
and are now trying to understand why the process works. They want to know which 
genes that affect life span are inherited or eliminated by postponing 
reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
For the fruit fly, Rose has shown that at least 100 genes may be involved. 
</P>
<P>
But the research will contribute little to the understanding of human aging, 
Rose says, unless the same experiments can be tried on mammals, such as mice. 
That is where his "plan" for expanding life span comes in. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can use a mouse to postpone aging, than we will begin to find out how to 
do that in man," he says. Ten years of work on mice, he suggests, could 
probably reveal the genes, processes and cell biology involved. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we can try out direct interventions to postpone aging," he says, first on 
mice, then on humans. 
</P>
<P>
Finch also believes that plenty of evidence challenges the assumption that our 
life span has a limit. But he believes that study of common health practices -- 
such as exercising and hormone treatments to reduce the risk of osteoporosis -- 
will contribute significantly to the understanding of aging. 
</P>
<P>
A professor of gerontology, Finch is a tall, thin Northeasterner who likes to 
joke about the way aging has left him balding. But beneath the congeniality is 
the kind of dedicated, no-nonsense scientist who would turn out a 842-page book 
called "Longevity, Senescence, and the Genome," (1991, the University of 
Chicago Press). The title refers to the study of aging and the role of genes in 
that process. 
</P>
<P>
Also an expert on Alzheimer's disease, Finch says the potential to thwart 
disease and disability in old age is the force behind the research to extend 
our life span. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason money is being put into research is in the belief . . . that we'll 
be able to define, treat and prevent many disabilities of aging by medical 
practice," Finch says. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of people living beyond 80 is increasing and this has enormous 
implications for health programs and society in general. We can't not do it." 
</P>
<P>
In his book, Finch has catalogued a lot of examples that show certain species 
have manipulated their environment to live longer. He calls this the 
"plasticity" of life span. 
</P>
<P>
Finch said he sees no biological limits that predict a maximum life span in any 
species. However, he says, manipulating genes can affect how long we can live. 
"It's a matter of programming genes in different sets of ways." 
</P>
<P>
For example, although queen bees and worker bees have the same genetic 
structure, queens live from five to 15 years while workers are lucky to live 
out a year. The difference, Finch says, is in their environment. Workers wear 
out from flying around while queens are pampered. 
</P>
<P>
Some species apparently don't age, Finch says. Scientists are studying a 
species of rock fish that are 100 years old and show no signs of aging, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"Under some circumstances, aging may not occur in the natural world," he says. 
"There are a lot of species of fish and other invertebrates that don't seem to 
have an increased risk of disease or death." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Finch suggests that people who are careful about their diet 
and exercise might live longer and healthier -- and contribute to the 
advancement of science. After all, research showed that rats who receive 
special diets and hormone supplements live longer. 
</P>
<P>
All of this means that such "interventions" can work in humans, Finch says. 
"Enough is now known to believe that (diseases of old age) are . . . not 
inevitable."

AN AWAKENING TO POWER OF PHOTOGRAPHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON PARKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gordon Parks spent the 1930s working a variety of odd jobs that included 
playing piano in a brothel and cleaning up after alcoholics in a Chicago 
flophouse. In the mid-1930s, Parks married a St. Paul woman and took a railroad 
job where he discovered the power of the camera. Here is Part III of a 
five-part excerpt from "Voices in the Mirror," the autobiography of the 
renowned photographer. 
</P>
<P>
I applied for a job as a waiter on the North Coast Limited and got it. It was a 
fine transcontinental train that ran between St. Paul, Chicago and Seattle, 
Wash., which took about four days. 
</P>
<P>
On quieter runs, in between meals, when the wealthy passengers were either 
sleeping or consuming alcohol in the lounge cars, I read every magazine I could 
get my hands on. 
</P>
<P>
In one that had been left behind by a passenger, I found a portfolio of 
photographs that I would never forget. They were migrant workers. Dispossessed, 
beaten by storms, dust and floods, they roamed the highways in caravans of 
battered jalopies and wagons between Oklahoma and California, scrounging for 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the photographers stuck in my mind -- Arthur Rothstein, Russell 
Lee, Carl Mydans, Walker Evans, Ben Shahn, John Vachon, Jack Delano and 
Dorothea Lange. They all worked for the Farm Security Administration, a 
government agency set up by President Roosevelt to aid submarginal farmers. 
</P>
<P>
These stark, tragic images of human beings caught up in the confusion of 
poverty saddened me. I took the magazine home and studied it for weeks. 
Meanwhile, I read John Steinbeck's "In Dubious Battle" and Erskine Caldwell and 
Margaret Bourke-White's "You Have Seen Their Faces." These books stayed in my 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
During layovers in Chicago, I began visiting the Art Institute on Michigan 
Avenue, spending hours in this large, voiceless place, studying paintings of 
Monet, Renoir and Manet. At a Chicago movie house, I watched a newsreel of the 
bombing of the United States gunboat Panay by Japanese fighter planes. 
Courageously the cameraman had stayed at his post, shooting the final belch of 
steam and smoke that rose when the boat sank in the Yangtze River. 
</P>
<P>
When the newsreel ended, a voice boomed over the intercom. "And here he is -- 
the photographer who shot this remarkable footage!" Norman Alley, the 
cameraman, had leaped on the stage to rousing cheers. And I was carried away by 
his bravery and dedication to his job. From that moment I was determined to 
become a photographer. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, I bought my first camera at a pawnshop for $7.50. It was a 
Voightlander Brilliant. Not much of a camera, but a great name to toss around. 
I had bought what was to become my weapon against poverty and racism. 
</P>
<P>
I got a porter's job on the 400, a fast train that ran between Minneapolis and 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The 400 allowed me layovers in Chicago. There, visual imagery multiplied 
tenfold, with skyscrapers, boats plying Lake Michigan, bridges and the 
inner-city canals. But before long I realized that such imagery, although it 
was fine for the family album, was hardly the kind to put steak and potatoes on 
my family's table. A beautiful sunset over the lake was just a beautiful sunset 
-- no more. 
</P>
<P>
Natural instinct had served to aim my sights much higher, and those Farm 
Security photographs with all their power were still pushing my thoughts 
around. Before long I had deserted the waterfronts, skyscrapers and canals for 
Chicago's south side -- the city's sprawling impoverished black belt. And there 
among the squalid, rickety tenements that housed the poor, a new way of seeing 
and feeling opened up to me. 
</P>
<P>
A photograph I made of an ill-dressed black child wandering in a trash-littered 
alley and another of two aged men warming themselves at a bonfire during a 
heavy snowfall pleased me more than any I had made. They convinced me that even 
the cheap camera I had bought was capable of making a serious comment on the 
human condition. 
</P>
<P>
Subconsciously, I was moving toward the documentary field, and Chicago's south 
side was a remarkably pitiful place to start. The worst of it was like bruises 
on the face of humanity. 
</P>
<P>
A collection of photographs I had taken in the impoverished area of the black 
belt came to the attention of the Julius Rosenwald Fund, a cultural foundation 
established by its namesake to aid promising blacks and Southern whites. 
Writers, painters, sculptors and scholars had been recipients of fellowships -- 
but never a photographer. I was considered to be promising, so my work was sent 
to be judged by a jury of Chicago's most esteemed white photographers and, to a 
man, they turned thumbs down. 
</P>
<P>
To allow my application yet another chance, my work was then sent to a jury 
composed of painters and sculptors. While I awaited their decision, time 
crawled ever so slowly. Worry set in. The postman arrived with nothing but 
bills. After three weeks the jury was still out, still feeding my anxiety and 
sleepless nights. The fourth week an envelope, with the fund's masthead, 
appeared in the small pack of mail. I was fearful of opening it; it 
</P>
<P>
seemed to be shaped with rejection. I handed it to Sally, my wife, so that she 
might read the bad news. She tore the envelope open, read its contents and 
smiled weakly. "You are a Julius Rosenwald Fellow." The news was astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
Through the prodding of the fund, I was to serve out my fellowship with the 
Farm Security Administration, with these same photographers whose work had 
beckoned to me when I was a waiter on the North Coast Limited. It was an 
extravagant moment as we began packing, and for the next two years Washington, 
D.C., would be our home. 
</P>
<P>
I arrived there in January of 1942 with scant knowledge of the place, knowing 
only that beneath the gleaming monuments and gravestones lay men who had 
distinguished themselves. What I had learned along the way had little to do 
with this sprawling city where Washington and Lincoln had been empowered. 
</P>
<P>
Sensing this, Roy Stryker, the photographic mentor at FSA, sent me out to get 
acquainted with the rituals of the nation's capital. I went in a hurry and with 
enthusiasm. The big blue sky was without clouds and everything seemed so pure, 
clean and unruffled. It appeared that the entire universe was pleasured in 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
My contentment was short-lived. Within the hour the day began opening up like a 
bad dream; even here in this radiant, high-hearted place, racism was busy with 
its dirty work. Eating houses shooed me to the back door; theaters refused me a 
seat, and the scissoring voices of white clerks at Julius Garfinckel's 
prestigious department store riled me with curtness. Some clothing I hoped to 
buy there went unbought. They just didn't have my size -- no matter what I 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
In a very short time, Washington was showing me its real character. It was a 
hate-drenched city, honoring my ignorance and smugly creating bad memories for 
me. During the afternoon my entire childhood rushed back to greet me, to remind 
me that the racism it poured on me had not called it quits. 
</P>
<P>
I had gone to a restaurant to eat, to a store to buy clothing and to a movie 
theater for enjoyment. And Washington was telling me, in no uncertain terms, 
that I shouldn't have done it. Now I was hurrying back to Roy Stryker's office 
like an angry wind. 
</P>
<P>
When I reached there, he looked at me for a few moments without speaking. He 
didn't have to. The gloom shadowing my face told him everything. "Well," he 
finally asked, "tell me -- how did it go?" 
</P>
<P>
I answered him with a question. "What's to be done about this horrible place? 
I've never been so humiliated in my life. Mississippi couldn't be much worse." 
</P>
<P>
He rubbed his chin, thinking. "As for that city out there, well -- it's been 
here for a long time, full of bigotry and hatred for black people. You brought 
a camera to town with you. If you use it intelligently, you might help turn 
things around. It's a powerful instrument in the right hands." 
</P>
<P>
He paused, thinking things through for me. "Obviously, you ran into some bigots 
out there this afternoon. Well, it's not enough to photograph one of them and 
label his photograph bigot. Bigots have a way of looking like everyone else. 
You have to get at the source of their bigotry. And that's not easy. That's 
what you'll have to work at, and that's why I took you on. 
</P>
<P>
"Read. Read a lot. Talk to the black people who have spent their lives here. 
They might help to give you some direction. Go through these picture files. 
They have a lot to say about what's happening here and other places throughout 
this country. They are an education in themselves. The photographers who 
produced those files learned through understanding what our country's problems 
are. Now they are out there trying to do something about those problems. That's 
what you must do eventually." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually. All well and good -- but I was still burning with a need to hit 
back at the agony of the afternoon. I sat for an hour mulling over his advice 
and the humiliation I had suffered. 
</P>
<P>
It had grown late; the office had emptied and Stryker had left for the day. 
Only a black charwoman remained, but she was mopping the floor in an adjoining 
office. "Talk to other black people who have spent their lives here," he had 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She was black, and I eased into conversation with her. Hardly an hour had gone 
by when we finished, but she had taken me through a lifetime of drudgery and 
despair in that hour. She was turning back to her mopping when I asked, "Would 
you allow me to photograph you?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind." 
</P>
<P>
There was a huge American flag hanging from a standard near the wall. I asked 
her to stand before it, then placed the mop in one hand and the broom in the 
other. "Now think of what you just told me and look straight into this camera." 
Eagerly I began clicking the shutter. It was done and I went home to supper. 
Washington could now have a conversation with her portrait. 
</P>
<P>
Stryker appeared astonished when I laid the enlarged photograph on his desk the 
following afternoon. "My God," he said. "You're going to get us all fired." I 
smiled, but to myself, knowing I had found a little justice in that sea of 
bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
Stryker's advice was sound but not easy to follow. While some black people 
talked freely about racial problems in Washington, some, especially older ones, 
viewed my curiosity with suspicion. Feeling hopelessly ensnared in the city's 
bigoted ways, they looked upon change as an impossibility. Yielding to racism, 
they had given up. 
</P>
<P>
Photographing bigotry was, as Stryker had warned, very difficult. It didn't 
have a repulsive body with a head of horns. Yet it was there like a stone wall, 
revealing itself in a voice, a mannerism or some empirical way. 
</P>
<P>
The evil of its effect, however, was discernible in the black faces of the 
oppressed and their blighted neighborhood lying within the shadows of the 
Capitol. It was in those shadows that the charwoman lived, and I followed her 
through them -- to her dark house, her storefront church; to her small 
happinesses and daily frustrations.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MURDER CONVICTION FOR DRUNK DRIVER UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state appellate court has upheld the murder conviction and 30-year-to-life 
sentence given a drunk driver who killed four people in a head-on crash on the 
Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Edmund Murray, 29, of Lancaster, was convicted by a jury in 1988 of four 
counts of second-degree murder and two counts of felony drunk driving for the 
Dec. 11, 1986, wrong-way crash that killed Suzanne Brown, 37; her son, Jonah, 
7; her father, Jack Rawls, 69, and Dia Rae Rounds, 16, of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
After reportedly drinking about 19 beers the day of the crash, Murray drove his 
pickup truck eastbound on the westbound Ventura Freeway for at least three 
miles before hitting Brown's car in Agoura. Brown's son, Jamaal, riding on a 
bus with his high school basketball team, saw his mother's wrecked Honda Accord 
surrounded by ambulances. 
</P>
<P>
Murray's appeal said that the burden of proof for second-degree murder had not 
been met.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFFICERS LINK SUSPECT TO 13 BANK ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Compton man suspected of committing 13 bank robberies during the last six 
months was arrested Monday after a bank holdup in an unincorporated area near 
Carson, sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Hal Grant said Mark Kenneth Barbee, 26, was arrested after a robber fled 
with $400 from the Bank of America branch at 118 E. Rosecrans Ave. at about 
10:50 a.m. No weapon was used, Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies responding to a silent alarm were flagged down by a man who directed 
them to a nearby recycling center where Barbee was found in a parked car. Grant 
said booking officers discovered that Barbee had two outstanding warrants for 
his arrest, one for desertion from the Navy and the other for bank robbery. He 
is also a suspect in bank robberies in Gardena, Moreno Valley, Compton and Long 
Beach.

MAN GETS 27 YEARS TO LIFE IN THE SLAYING OF HIS WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale man convicted last month of murdering his wife and trying to cover 
up the crime by staging a burglary of their home was sentenced Monday to 27 
years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel J. Montecalvo's face reddened, but he sat motionless as Pasadena 
Superior Court Judge Jack Tso outlined the sentence and told him that the 
evidence that led to his first-degree murder conviction was overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
Montecalvo, 49, was found guilty Nov. 5 of fatally wounding his wife, Carol, in 
1988 despite his claim that a burglar had shot her after being discovered 
ransacking their Burbank home. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Montecalvo, who moved to Glendale after the murder, shot 
himself in the back with a small-caliber pistol to make it seem as though the 
burglar had also attacked him. 
</P>
<P>
Montecalvo, a convicted bank robber, killed his 43-year-old wife to collect on 
her $600,000 insurance policy in order to settle gambling debts, said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Robert Cohen, who prosecuted the case. 
</P>
<P>
At his sentencing Monday, Montecalvo, who has acted as his own attorney 
throughout the trial, denied the allegations and accused Cohen of misleading 
the jurors and the judge. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the Police Department focused on him as the murder suspect after 
he sued the department for negligence, charging that his wife, a Pacific Bell 
supervisor, died of her wounds because the officers did not respond fast enough 
to an emergency call. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a frame-up," said Montecalvo. "Everything (Cohen) has said has been 
unfair. He has lied to the court." 
</P>
<P>
In a nearly hourlong statement before he was sentenced, Montecalvo asked Tso 
for a retrial on the grounds that new evidence had surfaced that would clear 
his name. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way I can grant a retrial is if it can be demonstrated that you have 
not had a fair trial," said Tso. "There is substantial evidence to show you are 
guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt. The evidence has been overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors admitted that most of the evidence against Montecalvo was 
circumstantial. There were no eyewitnesses to the slaying, and a murder weapon 
was never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
The case was so difficult to assemble, prosecutors said, they waited nearly two 
years before charging Montecalvo of murder last March 14. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Penny Schneider, the original prosecutor, sought later to 
have the murder charge dropped, but was overruled by her superiors. She was 
replaced by Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-five witnesses, 163 exhibits and 8,600 pages of investigative reports 
painted Montecalvo as a bar-hopping womanizer and a habitual gambler desperate 
to pay off his gambling debts.

TEACHING ASSISTANTS ALSO CONSIDER STRIKE SYMBOLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They are not the kind of people who normally carry picket signs -- people such 
as Eugenia Sandaval, a 20-year-old college student; Jesus Tinoco, a 35-year-old 
Venezuelan who was a shop clerk in his native country, and Luis Villarreal, a 
former worker in an upholstery factory. Yet, they have embarked on a work 
stoppage with challenging cultural and educational implications. 
</P>
<P>
They are among hundreds of striking Los Angeles Unified School District 
teaching assistants, many of whom see their 6-day-old strike for a union 
contract in starkly personal terms. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the district's 10,000 teaching assistants are first-generation 
Latino immigrants. They tend to interpret the strike -- especially its demand 
for medical insurance and guaranteed minimum hours -- as a symbolic question of 
whether they will improve on the lives of their immigrant parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the struggles my family went through," said Gonzalo Ramirez, 19, a 
teaching assistant at 102nd Street Elementary School in Watts, who picketed in 
front of Manual Arts High School at a strike rally Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez's mother, a Mexican immigrant, works for minimum wage at a restaurant. 
He takes college courses and hopes after graduating to become a high school 
math teacher. The effort to win a labor contract, he said, is "my chance to 
show them that this is the generation that can do something other than work at 
a restaurant." 
</P>

This determination -- expressed last week when 150 teaching assistants noisily 
demonstrated during a school board meeting and then occupied board members' 
chairs after the board fled -- is forcing the district to confront an important 
long-range choice: Should the teaching assistants, who receive no health 
benefits, sick leave or paid holidays, be kept in their current status -- 
treated, in effect, like the average American part-time worker? Or should they 
be upgraded to paraprofessional status because of the classroom work they do 
and because a significant proportion say they want to become teachers? 
</P>
<P>
Because 70% are bilingual Latinas, those with aspirations to become educators 
represent the kind of teachers sorely lacking in the district, which has only 
one certified bilingual instructor for every 400 non-English-speaking students. 
</P>
<P>
"The TAs can be a solution to the entire school problem," said Carlos Barron, a 
bilingual teaching consultant in the district's professional development office 
and a supporter of the strike. "If they (board members) want to solve the 
(bilingual education) problem, they shouldn't throw away an opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
The key issues are demands for a guaranteed minimum workday of four hours, 
health benefits and a "career ladder" that would raise wages by 5% for teaching 
assistants who take a sufficient number of college courses. Wages currently run 
$8 to $10 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The board has resisted the demands, contending they are too expensive. The 
district has so far refused to guarantee hours and is willing only to pay half 
of the health benefits for those who work four hours or more a day. The 
district wants to retain a longstanding -- but not always enforced -- 
requirement that they attend college in their spare time, something the union 
wants to abolish. 
</P>
<P>
The union, Local 99 of the Service Employees International Union, acknowledges 
that its demands would cost the financially troubled district an extra $14 
million over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Local 99, which organized the teaching assistants last year, on Monday 
orchestrated walkouts at 117 schools in South Los Angeles, West Los Angeles and 
the San Pedro-Wilmington area. The union is calling a series of "rolling" 
strikes, in which assistants strike in various areas for three days at a time. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the two sides gave wildly conflicting estimates of strike 
participation on Monday. The district said only 265 assistants were missing; 
the union said 1,200 -- about 80% of the assistants at the 117 schools -- were 
on strike. 
</P>
<P>
Another round of negotiations is scheduled today. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute carries a significance beyond the teaching assistants themselves. 
Organized labor, its national membership rapidly sinking as a percentage of the 
total work force, is relying heavily on organizing categories of workers who 
have rarely joined unions in the past. The assistants -- a part-time, heavily 
female, largely minority work force -- are an example of that kind of worker. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the assistants receive no medical benefits is not unusual among 
part-time workers, defined by federal standards as people who work fewer than 
35 hours a week. Many teaching assistants stay with the job because it pays 
exceptionally well -- nearly twice what the average part-time job in the United 
States pays. 
</P>
<P>
But that was no consolation to those who gathered at Monday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
"I get sick and I don't go to a doctor," said Villarreal, 27, of Downey, who 
was encouraged to quit working in upholstery and become a teaching assistant 
seven years ago by his sister, who also was a teaching assistant. "What I do, I 
use home remedies and hope I get well." 
</P>
<P>
William Ganuza, 24, who came to the United States from El Salvador with his 
parents at age 10, said his family has promised to help support him while he is 
on strike. 
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing to lose; they can fire us now anyway. But we have a lot to 
gain. That's why it wasn't a difficult decision for me to make," he said.

POLICE CASEWORK ON 39TH-DALTON BACKED; 
</P>
<P>
INQUIRY: AN LAPD IN-HOUSE REPORT ORDERED BY MAYOR BRADLEY FINDS NOTHING 
IMPROPER IN THE INVESTIGATION OF FOUR OFFICERS' ACTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles police sergeant did not act improperly in his investigation into 
the activities of four fellow officers who face misdemeanor charges of 
vandalism in connection with the 39th and Dalton case, an in-house Police 
Department inquiry has determined. 
</P>
<P>
The report was ordered by Mayor Tom Bradley following a Times report in which 
Sgt. Robert Kavanaugh said he had been working on behalf of the four officers' 
defense team. Such activity would have constituted an apparent breach of 
policy; police officers are supposed to work only for prosecutors in bringing 
criminal defendants to justice. 
</P>
<P>
The report is scheduled to be discussed today by the Board of Police 
Commissioners and considered for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting Kavanaugh, his immediate police supervisors and defense attorney 
Michael Stone, the report concludes that Kavanaugh was acting in his role as a 
police representative defending officers against administrative cases in the 
39th and Dalton case, and that he never crossed the line and helped prepare the 
criminal defense of the four officers who are being prosecuted for the 1988 
police raid. 
</P>
<P>
Kavanaugh, in his interview with The Times in October, admitted that he worked 
extensively as a criminal defense investigator assisting Stone. He said he 
conducted interviews, stakeouts and other criminal defense work out of Stone's 
office, all with the approval of his department supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never been a secret," he told a reporter. "I got a clear sign from my 
supervisors that it was OK to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The report concluded that Stone was careful not to include Kavanaugh in work on 
the criminal case. The report also said Kavanaugh's superiors never gave him 
approval to help the criminal defense case, and that had he helped the case, 
they would have "taken steps to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
The report added that Kavanaugh felt his interview with The Times was taken out 
of context, and that he was only trying to describe the fine line between a 
police defense representative handling administrative matters, as opposed to a 
criminal defense investigator. 
</P>
<P>
"The appearance of a crossover could exist," the report said. "However, he 
(Kavanaugh) and other defense representatives never knowingly participated in 
such an arrangement because it would be a conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
The initial report on Kavanaugh's activities not only prompted Bradley's 
request for an investigation, but also outraged Christopher Darden, the deputy 
district attorney who is prosecuting the four officers for their roles in 
allegedly helping to destroy property in apartments near 39th Street and Dalton 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Darden said Monday that the police have yet to provide him with copies of all 
of Kavanaugh's work materials in the case, despite pretrial court orders to 
turn the documents over to the prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't got everything we want," he said. "We believe he had interviews 
with certain potential witnesses and there are no documents covering those 
interviewes. It causes me to wonder why a police officer, knowing there is a 
discovery order, won't disclose those interviews to me, the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of conduct suggests to me he is working for an interest other than 
justice. It suggests to me he is working probably for the criminal defense." 
</P>
<P>
Darden added that he is skeptical of the Police Department's findings about 
Kavanaugh's activities. 
</P>
<P>
"They never even interviewed me," he said. "I can't imagine how they can do a 
thorough investigation without conferring with us first." 
</P>
<P>
Kavanaugh could not be reached for comment Monday.

GARY SLIPS A BIT AS RAMS RISE; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: RUNNING BACK REMAINS STARTER, BUT HE HAS COMPETITION, AND FUMBLES 
HAVE NOT HELPED HIS CAUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the darkest moments of this season, one thing that always seemed to shine 
clearly was that Cleveland Gary was and would be the Rams' tailback from here 
to football eternity. 
</P>
<P>
Gary was the man, the workhorse, the next of John Robinson's 1,000-yard 
rushers, and if you doubted that, well, all the Ram coach did was keep giving 
him the ball and all Gary did was break tackles, pile up the numbers and score 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the Rams' season brightens in the glow of two consecutive victories, 
Gary's individual star suddenly has dimmed, thanks to his recent fumbling 
plague and the emergence of a few other tailbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Gary has fumbled nine times this season and lost five of them -- including lost 
drops in each of the last three weeks, one of which Robinson concedes cost the 
Rams the Dallas game -- and a possible three-game winning streak -- last month. 
After fumbling on the second possession of their 38-23 victory over the 
Cleveland Browns last Sunday, Gary spent most of the rest of the game watching 
backup Gaston Green play effectively. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, at his weekly media luncheon, Robinson did not exactly go out of his 
way to defend Gary, even as he was telling of his joy with his team's upswing 
to 5-7. Robinson even suggested that the newest Ram tailback, Marcus Dupree, 
could start playing more. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams will play the New Orleans Saints (5-7) Sunday in a game that for all 
intents will knock the loser out of the wild-card race, but it is not clear 
exactly who the Rams' main rusher will be. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll both play," Robinson said of Gary, who still retains at least his 
starting status, and Green. "I don't have a real ability in my mind to go into 
a game and say I'm going to play this person this much or the second series. 
</P>
<P>
"I will get Gaston in earlier. As you've seen over the last three, four weeks, 
he's come in a game in the first quarter or early in the second. And I will 
continue to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Although Robinson still obviously would like Gary to do most of the work, he 
said that Gary has to learn that consistent fumbling cannot go unpunished. 
</P>
<P>
Gary has gained 651 yards in 169 carries this year after missing training camp 
and the first few weeks of the season with a back injury, and Robinson 
emphasizes that the second-year player simply needs to grow as a runner. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson praised Gary's ability to gain yards the hard way, but gaining yards 
doesn't help if the ball is rolling around under defensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just got to hold the ball tighter," Robinson said. "I've never been a 
coach who said, 'Oh, you fumbled. You're out.' That's bull, I think. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think he's going through a period where he has to become responsible in 
terms of the ball. And I'm not saying he's irresponsible. I just think he's 
learning. He's learning that it's important, that we lose the game when he 
fumbles, he comes out of the game when he fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost a game because he fumbled. You know, he'd be a 1,000-yard rusher right 
now if he'd played the whole season, and if he'd been the ballcarrier (Sunday), 
he'd have had 130, 140 yards." 
</P>
<P>
Give Gary a full training camp, Robinson said, and then those bad habits should 
disappear. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not a very detail-oriented guy . . . but he's really good," Robinson 
said. "He's a long way away from being what he will be. He's going (up) as a 
runner and as a player. He just has got a ways to go." 
</P>
<P>
Green, the Rams' No. 1 pick three seasons ago, gained 57 yards in 13 carries 
Sunday, pushing his season total to 194 yards in 44 carries, a 4.4-yard 
average. Green, who has never been able to establish himself with Robinson, 
seems at least to have caught his eye this time. 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson didn't sound as if he is ready to unleash Green, and for now, it 
appears that Green will continue in a subsidiary role. Green's style of running 
is in direct contrast to Gary's rough-and-tumble-for-four-yards method. Green, 
Robinson said, needs holes to run through, and that has never been Robinson's 
style. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not the same kind of elusive person that (Dave Meggett of the New York 
Giants or Eric Metcalf of the Cleveland Browns) are," Robinson said. "He's a 
speed person. Those people are people that you cannot get a hold of, 
theoretically. . . . He's a good player, but I don't think we want to confuse 
him with those kinds of people. 
</P>
<P>
"Gaston, if you give him room, has excellent speed and excellent acceleration. 
Gaston is a competent player, and by that I don't mean to make that sound like 
blue-collar. By competent, I mean he can do a lot of things. He's not a big 
load on pass-blocking . . . but he's solid and knows what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Dupree, the third and most intriguing name in the tailback mix, has shown 
flashes of his old flair after coming back from a five-year-old knee injury, 
and Robinson doesn't try to hide his excitement. 
</P>
<P>
But with Gary needing the practice time to hone his game, and with Green 
forcing himself into the plan, Dupree may find the practice-field action 
limited simply because of the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's getting pretty close to ready," Robinson said. "He's only been in 
a few plays, but he creates some stuff out there. That was kind of fun to see."

Conservative Bill Parcells got daring at the wrong time Monday night at San 
Francisco. . . . 
</P>
<P>
At least, the New York coach's decisions to go for a touchdown instead of a 
field goal and to call four consecutive passes from the nine-yard line gave 
people something to talk about after an otherwise forgettable game. . . . I 
hadn't seen so many kicks since the World Cup. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how comfortable the Lakers have become with Mike Dunleavy's system will 
be determined tonight when they play Detroit at the Forum, where they have lost 
four consecutive games to the Pistons. . . . 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Al Bianchi's firing of New York Knick Coach Stu Jackson was 
scapegoating at its worst. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Better that Bianchi had made some personnel moves to build a contender around 
Patrick Ewing. And it was Bianchi who let free-agent Bernard King go to 
Washington for nothing when he refused to match the Bullets' offer. . . .

Paul Westhead won't be long for Denver if, as he says, "in this system, you 
need the entire team to play full blast every minute of every game." . . .

Michael Cooper was named most valuable player in the Italian League all-star 
game although he scored only six points. Must have been his defense in the 
South's 182-176 victory. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Milwaukee Bucks should try to make the disgruntled Alvin Robertson happy. 
He's one-third of the best trio of guards in the NBA. . . . 
</P>
<P>
You knew Ray Perkins was on his way out of Tampa Bay the minute Buccaneer owner 
Hugh Culverhouse gave him a vote of confidence. . . .

Nancy Travis deserves an award for her brilliant performance as the field 
hockey player in the play "My Children! My Africa!" . . .

reserved for the Olympics. Promoters of the Sunkist Invitational Jan. 18 at the

Devon White's Angel career wasn't much different than Gary Pettis'. . . .

Sometimes you get what you pay for. Baltimore had the lowest payroll in the 
American League last season. Oakland had the highest in the West Division and 
Boston the highest in the East. . . .

San Francisco could have a battery of Black and Decker -- veteran pitcher Bud

<P>
Former Raider safety Vann McElroy is giving the Seattle Seahawks' secondary the 
toughness it has lacked since the retirement of Kenny Easley. . . .

So much for the science of scouting. Leading running backs Marion Butts of San 
Diego and Johnny Johnson of Phoenix were seventh-round draft picks. . . .

It's hard to believe that the Kansas City Chiefs are the second-highest scoring

Instead of a rematch with Julio Cesar Chavez, Meldrick Taylor will box Aaron 
Davis Jan. 19 at Las Vegas. . . .

<P>
The NCAA soccer championships made the World Cup seem like a scoring orgy. UCLA 
won two games on penalty kicks after failing to score a goal, or allow one, in 
270 minutes of regulation play and overtime. . . . 
</P>
<P>
There's got to be a better way for the NHL to figure out its standings. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' loss to Toronto Saturday at the Forum shouldn't have come as such a 
shock. Los Angeles teams coming off long trips usually don't play well in their 
first home game. . . .

The World Chess Championships need a 24-minute clock.

DUCHESNE SCORES TWICE TO LEAD KINGS OVER SOVIETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't exactly the miracle on ice. 
</P>
<P>
Nor the Miracle on Manchester. 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time, a hockey victory over the Soviet Union, any victory, was a 
moment to savor. 
</P>
<P>
But that was back when the cold war on ice mirrored the Cold War in the halls 
of government. 
</P>
<P>
In the era of glasnost the warming of relations has meant a cooling in the 
heated rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
So the Kings' 5-1 exhibition victory over Khimik Voskresensk Monday night at 
the Forum didn't have the drama it might have had a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Or the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
It was announced as 10,762, although it appeared smaller, for the start of 
Super Series 1990-91, a two-month, 21-game series involving the top three teams 
in the Soviet National League against all the NHL clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Duchesne had two of the Kings' goals. The others were scored by Luc 
Robitaille, Jay Miller and Mikael Lindholm. 
</P>
<P>
Andrei Kvartalnov scored for Khimik. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you have a game like this during the season," Coach Tom Webster said, 
"you are concerned about injuries or anything that might transpire when you 
don't take the game seriously. But I thought tonight was entertaining. It 
helped that we brought some players up and played some of the younger guys." 
</P>
<P>
Biggest cheers of the night came in a shootout between the second and third 
periods. The Soviets won the best-of-five battle of penalty shots, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky scored the Kings' only goal. Robitaille, Tony Granato, Miller and 
Bob Kudelski were all turned away by Soviet goalie Alexei Chervyakov. 
</P>
<P>
Valeri Zelepukin, Dmitri Kvartalnov and Leonid Trukhno scored off the Kings' 
Daniel Berthiaume. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
In previous games against the Soviets, the Kings lost to the Central Red Army, 
5-2, five seasons ago; to Dynamo Riga, 5-2, two seasons ago, and to Khimik, 
6-3, last season. . . . Khimik split its six games on the NHL tour last season. 
</P>
<P>
Neither King defenseman Marty McSorley, who has a bruise in the rib area, nor 
center John McIntyre, who has contusion in the left shoulder, is expected back 
before Saturday. . . . The Kings called up center Mikael Lindholm and right 
wing Kyosti Karjalainen from their Phoenix Roadrunners farm club for the game.

NHL ROUNDUP;

BOURQUE, RECCHI LEAD PENGUINS, WHO FEEL AT HOME ON THE ROAD

<P>
Phil Bourque had his first NHL hat trick and Mark Recchi picked up five assists 
as the Pittsburgh Penguins tied a team record for goals in a road game with a 
9-4 decision over the New York Rangers on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Ranger goalies John Vanbiesbrouck and Mike Richter, who had combined for the 
second-best goals-against average in the NHL (2.69), gave up the nine goals on 
36 shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins were 1-6 in their previous seven games. They had scored nine goals 
in a road game on three previous occasions -- the last time at Minnesota on 
Jan. 12, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh led, 4-1, after one period, despite being outshot 14-12. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 4, Montreal 2 -- Kevin Dineen scored two goals to lead the Whalers in 
their fifth consecutive road victory. 
</P>

TAMPA BAY FIRES PERKINS ON WINNING NOTE;

PRO FOOTBALL: COACH IS DISMISSED AFTER TEAM BEATS ATLANTA TO BREAK A SIX-GAME 
LOSING STREAK.

Ray Perkins, hired to turn the Tampa Bay Buccaneers into the team of the 1990s, 
was fired Monday in his fourth season as coach of the losingest NFL franchise 
of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, Perkins' dismissal came the day after the 5-8 Buccaneers ended the 
six-game losing streak that proved his undoing. 
</P>
<P>
"The change is not because of Ray Perkins. It's strictly that we haven't had a 
winning season in four years. I'm not saying who's at fault," owner Hugh 
Culverhouse said. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Culverhouse said he would not let Perkins quit even if the team 
lost the rest of its games. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday, Culverhouse, who lured Perkins from Alabama with a five-year 
contract worth $800,000 a year, said his 19-41 record since 1987 simply was not 
good enough. Assistant head coach Richard Williamson was named interim coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the pressure continued to build," Culverhouse said. "The more I 
thought about it, even though we had won, I knew there was going to be this 
constant distraction to the team. Is Ray Perkins going to be back next year? 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like with two weeks off we'd have a chance to make this change and have 
something strong come out of it," he said, referring to this week's open date. 
"There's no guarantee that it will, but in my opinion with the two weeks off we 
had a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Perkins, who was unavailable for comment, met with Culverhouse then broke the 
news to the players. 
</P>
<P>
"He took it pretty hard because he's always been a winning coach," Culverhouse 
said. "This is the first time something like this has ever happened to him." 
</P>
<P>
The Buccaneers sputtered offensively during the losing streak, and Perkins' 
relationship with Vinny Testaverde soured when the quarterback was benched for 
two games in favor of Chris Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
Testaverde regained the No. 1 job two weeks ago and passed for a season-high 
351 yards against Atlanta on Sunday, when the losing streak ended with a 23-17 
victory. He said he was surprised by Culverhouse's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very disappointing," Testaverde said. "You go out and win a game and you 
come back and there's bad news." 
</P>
<P>
Perkins also held the title of vice president-football operations and was 
responsible for all personnel moves. He also served as his own offensive 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
The Buccaneers haven't had a winning season since going 5-4 and qualifying for 
the playoffs during the strike-shortened 1982 season.

NEWSWIRE: KNICKS HIRE MACLEOD AFTER FIRING JACKSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Knicks fired Coach Stu Jackson Monday and hired John MacLeod, who 
vowed to take a "realistic approach" toward the struggling team. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks, whose record is 7-8 overall, 3-5 at home, have been criticized for 
lack of discipline and spark. 
</P>
<P>
MacLeod, who coached the Phoenix Suns for 14 seasons and the Dallas Mavericks 
for three, ranks fifth among active NBA coaches with 675 victories. He was 
fired early last season by Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"I will emphasize the positive and stay away from the negative," MacLeod said. 
"But I will not say things are hunky-dory when they are not." 
</P>
<P>
Things were not going well for the Knicks this year under Jackson, who had no 
previous head coaching experience. Their struggles at home only magnified the 
overall problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It just didn't work out as well as we thought," General Manager Al Bianchi 
said. "I'm not going to go into the specifics or step on anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was not available for comment.

GROUP CHECKS EVERETT'S ALLEGED USE OF HOLLYWOOD PARK FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: AUDIT COMMITTEE PROBE IS SPAWNED BY A LETTER FROM HUBBARD. 
SPOKESMAN FOR TRACK'S CEO CHARGES IT IS PART OF 'SMEAR' CAMPAIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The audit committee of Hollywood Park has launched an investigation into 
allegations that Marje Everett, the track's chief executive officer, may have 
used company goods and services for private use. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting Monday, the audit committee delegated the Arthur Anderson Co. to look 
into conduct by Everett that was questioned by R.D. Hubbard in a letter to 
Warren Williamson, secretary-treasurer of the Hollywood Park Operating Co. The 
letter, dated Nov. 15, was later circulated to the operating company's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
Everett was also the subject of a suit Monday filed by Hubbard's attorneys in 
U.S. District Court in Los Angeles against her and five other board members for 
allegedly violating Securities and Exchange Commission rules. 
</P>
<P>
The suit contends that the Everett group, which also includes John Forsythe, 
Merv Griffin, Aaron Spelling, Allen Paulson and Stanley Seiden, made false 
statements about Hubbard and his motives. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard wants the group to publicly declare they were wrong and make new SEC 
filings that reflect the changes. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard, one of the Hollywood Park's principal stockholders, is seeking to oust 
Everett and has initiated a proxy fight that has already cost more than 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, a spokesman for Everett asserted that Hubbard wanted to 
take the company private. Hubbard says he has no plans to do that. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the suit says that statements made saying the track, if sold, 
could be used only for racing were incorrect. Hubbard contends the zoning of 
the track could allow for other types of development, and that a sale could not 
legally be made with those restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"According to the Inglewood Municipal Code, the zoning classification . . . 
does not limit the property to a racing use and expressly allows it to be used 
for, among other things, hotels, motels, restaurants and office buildings," the 
suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Perkins, a spokesman for Everett, said that Hubbard's history shows he 
has taken companies private after buying them. He also reiterated that the 
track, if sold, would only be to someone who would keep it a race track. 
</P>
<P>
While the suit allegations were made public, the allegations of misuse of 
company funds remained in the investigation stage. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been a series of allegations, and in due diligence we're obligated 
to look into them," Williamson said. "They may only be the tip of the iceberg, 
but it's hard to say right now. The accountants are looking into the 
allegations, and it may be 30 to 45 days before they report back to us." 
</P>
<P>
The other members of the audit committee are John Newman and G. Michael 
Finnigan, Hollywood Park's chief financial officer. Newman declined to comment 
on Monday when asked about the audit committee's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In the Hubbard letter to Williamson, it was suggested that Everett may have 
used company funds for renovations to her residences. Everett, who no longer 
maintains a residence at a Beverly Hills hotel, lives in a mansion in Holmby 
Hills that formerly belonged to Art Linkletter and Henry Mancini. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard's letter said that his investigators indicated that there may have been 
"extensive work" done at Everett's home in security and audiovisual areas, and 
that the bills may have been paid by the track rather than Everett. 
</P>
<P>
Everett could not be reached for comment. In New York, one of her spokesmen, 
Harris Diamond, said that the letter was a "standard smear" by Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
"In his letter, he gave no background for the allegations," Diamond said. "I 
think they're exceptionally scurrilous, and Hubbard knows they're a smear. I 
don't want to say it too loudly, but Mrs. Everett has never taken a salary for 
working at Hollywood Park." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Note 
</P>
<P>
The attorney for Pat Valenzuela, the embattled jockey who hopes to ride in the 
$1-million Hollywood Futurity on Sunday, said Monday that he has asked the 
Hollywood Park stewards for a hearing on Wednesday. Valenzuela, who was 
suspended indefinitely by the stewards after calling in sick at Santa Anita on 
Nov. 3, is the regular rider for Best Pal, the winner of the Del Mar Futurity 
and the Norfolk Stakes and possible favorite in the Hollywood Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
In suspending Valenzuela, who has a history of drug problems, the stewards 
referred his case to the California Horse Racing Board, and last Friday the 
board returned the matter to the stewards.

PARISH, CELTICS GIVE SEATTLE 5TH LOSS IN ROW

Robert Parish scored 22 points in a balanced attack Monday night at Boston as 
the Celtics rode a 28-10 third-quarter advantage to a 135-102 victory over 
Seattle, the SuperSonics' fifth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Parish was joined in double figures by seven teammates as the Celtics breezed 
to their ninth victory in 10 games and boosted their record to 13-3. 
</P>
<P>
Boston opened a 13-point lead in the first period and was ahead by as much as 
12 in the second quarter, but Seattle battled back to 58-54 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
With an 11-2 run, Boston went ahead, 69-58, in the third quarter. Then, after 
two Seattle baskets, Boston went on runs of 13-0 and 24-6 to carry a 
comfortable advantage into the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's Xavier McDaniel, among the NBA's leading scorers with a 23.8 average, 
scored only two points. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 135, Washington 101 -- Karl Malone scored 17 of his 38 points in the first 
quarter as the Jazz took a 23-point lead after 12 minutes and coasted at home. 
</P>
<P>
Malone also grabbed 15 rebounds. Jeff Malone, traded from the Bullets to the 
Jazz last summer, scored a season-high 28 points in his first game against 
Washington, which has lost seven in a row against Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz scored the first nine points of the game, and went ahead, 22-2, 5:02 
into the game, with Karl Malone scoring 10 in the run.

CLIPPER NOTES; 
</P>
<P>
HARPER'S RETURN STAYS ON COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A voluntary 80-minute workout that involved only seven teammates hardly 
constitutes a major step in Ron Harper's recovery from knee surgery, but the 
Monday session, his first with the Clippers since his injury, was a milestone 
of sorts as he remains on course for a January return. 
</P>
<P>
That little workout, though, pales in comparison to another he had recently. 
Two weeks ago, unbeknown to team officials, he played in a five-on-five game 
with friends in Dayton, Ohio. That ranks much bigger on the accomplishment 
scale than non-contact passing and shooting drills and going through offensive 
sets at half speed. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it was time to give the knee a test," Harper said of the impromptu game 
in his hometown. "(Doctors) told me once I would be able to try it at some 
point. So I tried it. I liked it, so I tried it again. It felt good." 
</P>
<P>
Such comments make the Clippers feel good, too, knowing that Harper's 
rehabilitation from a career-threatening tear of ligament and cartilage 
suffered Jan. 16 against Charlotte at the Sports Arena has progressed without a 
hitch. 
</P>
<P>
No one is quite sure when he will be able to go 100% in practices, but at least 
he's with the Clippers regularly again. Harper is expected to attend all 
workouts, even if he can't do all the drills. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to give the impression that he will be doing all the activities 
every day," trainer Keith Jones said. "There might be days he does not do 
anything with us. He's with the team, out from Ohio, and will be at every 
practice, but we're not sure right now what he will be doing every day." 
</P>
<P>
Said team physician Tony Daly, who performed the operation along with Dr. John 
Bergfeld of the Cleveland Cavaliers: "He is not quite there yet. He's close to 
shooting the way he wants and doing all the drills, but I think it will be 
about another month before he plays for real." 
</P>
<P>
Harper said he is 65-70% sound now. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Norman, who has missed the past six games because of a sprained left ankle 
suffered when he landed on Jack Haley's foot in a game against New Jersey at 
the Sports Arena last month, also practiced Monday. No decision on his return 
will be made until Wednesday, when the Clippers play host to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels much better today than yesterday," he said. "But mentally, I'm not 
where I need to be. I'm still a little leery (of the ankle). Watching the 
replays, it's a little scary, and you've got to jump all the time in this 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Norman, after initially disagreeing with the decision to put him on the injured 
list, now regards it as a good move. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the best thing that could have happened," he said. "No question. I 
didn't realize the severity of it." 
</P>
<P>
The number crunching from Charles Smith's 52-point game Saturday at Denver, 
which tied the franchise record, continues. 
</P>
<P>
He became the second Clipper to break 50, Freeman Williams having scored 51 
against Phoenix in 1980, when the team was still in San Diego. Derek Smith had 
the old L.A. Clipper record at 41. 
</P>
<P>
Tying Bob McAdoo was the most notable achievement, but there were others: a 
franchise record for free throws made in a half, 14; tying a franchise record 
for free throws attempted in a half, 17; setting an L.A. Clipper record for 
most free throws attempted, 21, and made, 18, in a game. There was also a team 
record for most defensive rebounds in one night, the 47 setting an L.A. Clipper 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
Lost amid all this, though, was that the Clippers as a team played a very good 
game and ended a nine-game road losing streak that dated to last season and had 
little trouble with Denver's full-court press. There was defense, too -- the 
Clippers forced the Nuggets into their first 24-second violation of the season.

DYAL GAMBLE COMES UP SNAKE-EYES

<P>
The Raiders lost a calculated gamble when they used their last free roster move 
to activate tight end Mike Dyal against Denver. It was learned Monday that Dyal 
had re-injured his hamstring and would be out for an extended period. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty serious," Coach Art Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
Shell said Dyal was injured on Bo Jackson's 62-yard scoring run. Until his 
activation Sunday, Dyal had been on injured reserve since Week 2 with a 
hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders haven't decided whether to place Dyal on injured reserve again or 
wait out his injury in the chance he'll be better by the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, the Raiders wasted their last roster move and now cannot activate 
Greg Bell from injured reserve should either Jackson or Marcus Allen be 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders probably will re-sign tight end Rich Bartlewski to replace Dyal. 
</P>
<P>
Nose tackle Bob Golic is apparently OK after injuring his right knee late in 
Sunday's game. Golic said it was an aggravation of an old injury. 
</P>
<P>
"Golic gets banged up quite a bit," Shell said, "but he bounces right back."

SLOW GOING: Few will be surprised by the commuting habits (above) revealed in 
the newest Orange County Annual Survey: Most people drive to work alone, half 
of them on freeways, in virtually identical proportions as in 1982. . . . How 
does this reconcile with the survey's finding of increased concern for the 
environment (A1)? When it comes to commuting, "people don't perceive that they 
have significant alternatives at this point," says pollster Mark Baldassare. 
"It's just not as easy as recycling."

American missionary Stephen Schaeffer said Monday that he and New Zealand 
missionary John Marsh were treated well during their 12 days as hostages of 
Papuan rebels fighting for independence of Indonesian-ruled Irian Jaya. 
Schaeffer said they had not felt threatened by their captors and had kept up 
their spirits by praying daily in the guerrillas' jungle hide-out until their 
release last Friday.

PROFESSOR SAYS PESSIMISTIC TREND MAY BOTTOM OUT 
</P>

Although 44% of residents surveyed think that Orange County will become a worse 
place to live, UC Irvine professor Mark Baldassare believes that a trend of 
pessimism about the future may be bottoming out. 
</P>
<P>
Changes respondents are willing to make in their lifestyles to protect the 
environment -- such as conserving water, recycling and supporting 
transportation alternatives as well as freeway construction -- bespeak a sense 
that people can improve matters, said Baldassare, who released the results of 
the 1990 Orange County Annual Survey on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing the beginning of a new trend in which people are feeling that 
they can do something about the environment," Baldassare said. "And they are 
feeling that perhaps things can be done about traffic and uncontrolled growth." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, those who believe that things are going "badly" in Orange County -- 
25% -- now outnumber those who say things are going "well" -- 22% -- among the 
1,017 adults surveyed in September. The negative rating has increased 12 
percentage points since 1987, while positive attitudes dropped 15 points over 
the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Worries about traffic, the lack of affordable housing and a dramatic decline in 
consumer confidence all play to that pessimism. At the same time, Baldassare 
noted, the survey shows a willingness to support transit alternatives such as 
light rail, as well as building new freeways and new lanes on existing 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to that, survey respondents say they are more often conserving water, 
recycling trash, buying environmentally safe products and limiting driving. 
</P>
<P>
And although local consumer confidence has plummeted in the wake of the Persian 
Gulf crisis and the nation's downward economic spiral, the median income of 
respondents increased 9% over the previous year. More than half of those 
surveyed expressed confidence that it would rise again in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County is doing pretty well economically," Baldassare said. "There are 
obvious pockets which have serious difficulties, and there are people with 
serious worries about the future. For young residents, for example, . . . there 
are great concerns about high housing costs. For older residents, health care 
appears to be a pressing issue. But people in general are doing pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Local government, now armed with gasoline tax funds and the half-cent sales tax 
increase approved with Measure M last month, is poised to make strides in 
curbing traffic congestion and holding down the impact of development. Could 
increased optimism about the future be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
"People are feeling there are things they can do that will make a difference," 
Baldassare said. "And perhaps they are feeling that things aren't as dismal as 
they appeared to be a few years ago."

LEWIS IS OUT, PACKARD IS IN IN GOP VOTE 
</P>

<P>
A conservative cadre rallied by Orange County lawmakers won a hotly contested 
leadership race within California's GOP congressional delegation Monday by 
installing one of its own, Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), and other allies in 
influential posts. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), the California conservatives 
ousted Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) from his only state delegation post hours 
after Lewis won reelection as head of the House Republican party caucus. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was reportedly 11 to 8 to replace Lewis with Packard as California's 
representative to the Republican Committee on Committees, a powerful body that 
assigns GOP lawmakers to congressional panels. All five Orange County 
congressmen supported Packard. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to work my heart out for them," Packard said of his fellow 
Californians. "I don't have any outside agenda. I don't have any ulterior 
motives to be on the Committee on Committees." Packard represents southern 
Orange County and northern San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis had been criticized by some for what they said was a willingness to use 
his power over committee assignments to further his aspirations to party 
leadership positions. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was said to have stunned Lewis, who campaigned hard for the committee 
assignment post up until minutes before the 19 California Republicans began 
casting their ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Lewis and his chief allies, Reps. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego) and 
William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield), one Orange County lawmaker said: "It just 
didn't occur to them that the slaves would rise up. They have always thought of 
us as the Three Stooges." 
</P>
<P>
However, in an interview after the vote, Lewis said: "I have other things to 
do. . . . I did not make an impassioned plea." 
</P>
<P>
Several lawmakers said that Packard's victory appears to have strengthened the 
hand of the Orange County congressional delegation. Not only can Packard be 
expected to give special attention to their requests for committee assignments, 
the sources said, but their ability to put together a coalition powerful enough 
to remove a party leader from his delegation post also will not be forgotten by 
their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
The conservatives who ousted Lewis, who held the committee assignment post for 
eight years, argued that he and Thomas for too long had dominated key 
leadership jobs within the delegation. In voice votes, the Republican 
congressmen also replaced Thomas as their representative to the National 
Republican Congressional Committee and as liaison to the state Republican 
party. 
</P>
<P>
The votes, Dannemeyer said, represent "a recognition that these jobs with real 
responsibility need to be passed around occasionally. . . . It was time for a 
change, and that's what we made." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, conservatives led by House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.) failed by a vote of 98-64 to remove Lewis as chairman of the party 
caucus, formally known as the House Republican Conference. Lewis became a 
conservative target after he angered fellow Republicans this fall by endorsing 
the White House-backed budget plan that included tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer and Reps. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) and Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Long Beach) opposed Lewis in the party caucus race. However, Packard and 
Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) supported him. 
</P>
<P>
Packard and Cox contended that Lewis, despite the budget vote, was more 
conservative than his opponent, Rep. Carl D. Pursell (D-Mich.). In addition, 
Packard and Cox said it would be foolish to replace a Californian heading the 
party caucus with a representative from another state. 
</P>
<P>
After his defeat of Pursell, Lewis lashed out at Gingrich and others in the 
House Republican leadership who had sought to bring him down. 
</P>
<P>
"The election . . . was somewhat of a disaster, not for Carl Pursell, but 
rather for those within the leadership who have chosen to actively work against 
my candidacy," Lewis said. "Their purpose was not to help Carl Pursell but to 
dump Jerry Lewis."

GREEN UNANIMOUSLY VOTED NEW MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter M. Green, an environmentalist and Golden West College professor, on 
Monday was unanimously elected mayor by his fellow council members. 
</P>
<P>
"For me politics is people," Green said in a brief speech after being sworn in. 
"There are many, many good people in this city." 
</P>
<P>
Green said one of his goals in 1991 will be to have a "citizens' congress," 
which he said would allow people in the city to tell the council what they want 
to see done in city government. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a member of the seven-member City Council since his upset victory 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Green won the position of mayor after a spirited, behind-the-scenes battle 
between him and Councilman Jim Silva for that position. Silva was elected mayor 
pro tem by a vote of 6 to 1. Councilwoman Grace Winchell nominated Councilwoman 
Linda Moulton-Patterson for mayor pro tem and cast the only vote for her. The 
mayor pro tem serves as chief executive in the absence of the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Green, who has been mayor pro tem, replaces outgoing Mayor Thomas J. Mays, who 
was elected to the state Assembly. Some had predicted that Green would never be 
chosen mayor because he frequently has irritated developers in the city. He has 
often voted against controversial development proposals, and last January he 
publicly criticized the powerful Huntington Beach Co., the city's largest 
landowner, saying the firm had politically manipulated the city into "a company 
town." 
</P>
<P>
Green, 64, has taught biological sciences and ecology at Golden West, a 
two-year community college in Huntington Beach, for the past 21 years. In a 
recent interview, he said he was urged to run for the City Council in 1984 by 
his colleagues in the environmental group Amigos de Bolsa Chica. 
</P>
<P>
With little money and no previous campaign experience, Green said, he knocked 
on doors and simply asked people to vote for him. 
</P>
<P>
"My election was a big surprise," he said. "It even surprised me." He was 
easily reelected to the City Council in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Minneapolis, Green served three years in the Navy during World War 
II. He received a bachelor's degree in liberal arts from St. Benedict's College 
in Atchinson, Kan., in 1952; a master's degree in zoology from Oklahoma State 
University in 1961 and a doctorate in ecology from Oklahoma State in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
During the late 1960s, Green served as both a teacher and administrator at St. 
Gregory's College in Shawnee, Okla. He moved to Huntington Beach in 1969, when 
he joined the faculty of Golden West College. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Cathy, have two children, Teresa, 19, and Tom, 18. Green said 
his hobbies are playing tennis and working in his garden. 
</P>
<P>
Three new council members were sworn in: Moulton-Patterson, former Councilman 
Jack Kelly and former Police Chief Earle Robitaille. Winchell was sworn in for 
a new four-year term. BILL BILLITER

AFFORDABLE-HOUSING PLAN UP FOR REVIEW

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council and Planning Commission will hold a joint meeting this 
afternoon to consider modifying the city's year-old, affordable-housing plan. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current plan, the city's goal is to require 25% of all new homes be 
affordable to families earning less than the county's median income. 
</P>
<P>
Half of those homes would be for families earning less than half of the 
county's median income, which for a family of four is about $49,100 a year. 
</P>
<P>
But current council members have criticized those affordable-housing goals as 
unworkable or onerous. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the City Council waived the affordability requirement for a mobile 
home park owner who objected to a requirement that one of four planned new 
coach spaces be set aside for a low-income tenant. The council's recent 
approval of a planned 3,700-home development also did not mandate affordable 
units inside the project, as specified by the housing plan. TOM MCQUEENEY

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER BUILDING AGREEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA MICHAELIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city may receive up to $20.6 million toward road and freeway improvements 
from the Irvine Co. in exchange for guaranteeing the company the right to build 
houses and office space under current density limits. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would prevent future councils from scaling back housing, office 
and hotel projects on the 11 properties the Irvine Co. owns in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We want a contract that says, 'You can't change your mind,' " explained Irvine 
Co. Vice Chairman Ray Watson. He added that political change on the council 
level is one of the unknowns that can be avoided under such an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement now being negotiated with the city, the Irvine Co. would be 
guaranteed permission to build 1,000 homes, about 256,000 square feet of office 
space, 50,000 square feet of commercial space, and 68,000 square feet of hotel 
rooms on the 11 sites. 
</P>
<P>
The $20.6 million for street improvements would consist of $8 million in 
developer fees from the Irvine Co. and $12.6 million in an interest-free loan 
from the developer to compensate the city for its advance commitment to the 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
The total amount of money that is needed to improve the city's streets is about 
$65 million, said City Manager Robert L. Wynn. This includes part of the Costa 
Mesa Freeway, MacArthur Boulevard, part of University Drive and other main city 
arteries. The $20.6 million from the Irvine Co. will be supplemented by gas tax 
funds and by money from the county's newly passed transportation tax. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement might also require the company to set aside 112 acres in Newport 
Beach as open space. The open space would be divided among the 11 sites. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the City Council will discuss a schedule for approving the 
agreement. However, officials say they expect it will be more than a year 
before the necessary environmental reports and public hearings can be completed 
for the agreement. LAURA MICHAELIS

RESIDENTS OPPOSING WATER TANK ON RIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents in the Laguna Heights community have begun a petition drive to block 
construction of a 2-million-gallon water tank on one of the city's highest 
ridgelines. 
</P>
<P>
While a water district official said the tank is needed to conserve water and 
keep Laguna Niguel's hillsides green, residents say the ridge, which offers a 
panoramic view of the Capistrano Valley, should be left undisturbed. An 
equestrian trail frequented by joggers and walkers stretches along the hilltop. 
</P>
<P>
"This ridgeline is one of the most beautiful in all of South County, if not all 
of Southern California," said Kathleen Botros, a resident of the Palisades 
development, a neighborhood in Laguna Heights. "This was one of the reasons so 
many of us chose to buy here. This is just a real valuable community resource 
we're talking about losing here." 
</P>
<P>
Residents said the project, which is expected to take a year to complete and 
would require the removal of 25,000 cubic yards of soil, would lower property 
values and generally disrupt their lives while construction is under way. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers have determined during the past year that the hilltop, which rises 
700 feet above sea level, would be "the ideal location" for the reservoir, 
according to a spokesman for the Moulton Niguel Water District, which serves 
Laguna Niguel and surrounding cities. 
</P>
<P>
The concrete tank would be 32 feet deep and 106 feet wide, but would be mostly 
buried, said Carlo Habash, director of engineering for the water district. 
However, a 50-foot wide section would rise above ground 6 feet at the highest 
point, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although several bids have been received on the project, Habash said the tank 
cannot be installed until the water district is granted right-of-way by the 
Laguna Heights Homeowners Assn., which owns the property. But residents say a 
project of such magnitude should not proceed without the blessing of the 
homeowners themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Brizzard, who has carried anti-tank petitions throughout the area, said 
the feedback she received so far indicates the community is opposed to the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten negative responses from everybody I've talked to," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Minh Argabritht said residents are upset that the association did not notify 
them earlier that such a project was in the works. "It took us by surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Heights Homeowners Assn. board member Dave Cathcart said the board was 
approached by the water district about nine months ago but said there was no 
reason to advise homeowners until engineers could decide if the project was 
feasible. The board unanimously supported allowing the water district to 
conduct feasibility tests, Cathcart said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope we could sit down and arrive at a meeting of the minds, so the 
project could be completed with as little inconvenience and frustration as 
possible," Cathcart said. 
</P>
<P>
A 3-million-gallon tank is currently under construction in the nearby Bear 
Brand Ranch area, Habash said. About 15 reservoirs have been built in the area 
since 1974, but this is the first time there has been such a public outcry, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Water district officials will meet with residents on Thursday to explain the 
project, Habash said. At a subsequent association board meeting, the district 
will attempt to gain easement rights, he said. LESLIE EARNEST

The City Council on Monday elected Councilwoman Mary Hornbuckle to serve a 
two-year term as mayor. Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis was elected vice mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Hornbuckle, a schoolteacher who is serving her second council term, was lauded 
by outgoing Mayor Peter F. Buffa as "caring, compassionate and prepared." Other 
council members noted her consensus-building skills. 
</P>
<P>
Those skills will come into play almost immediately as the council considers 
what to do about Councilman Ed Glasgow, who has admitted that he participated 
in the monitoring of private computer messages between Police Chief David L. 
Snowden and City Manager Allan L. Roeder. 
</P>
<P>
The council was scheduled to discuss possible censure of Glasgow in a closed 
session after Monday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
According to an investigation by the Orange County district attorney's office, 
the computer printouts were allegedly made by Costa Mesa Police Lt. John A. 
Regan, who is now retired. 
</P>
<P>
Regan told investigators that he monitored the messages as part of his own 
"investigation" into alleged improprieties by Snowden. Glasgow saw copies of 
the messages over a period of several months and asked the city attorney to 
investigate Snowden. However, neither the city attorney nor the district 
attorney found any evidence of wrongdoing by Snowden. 
</P>
<P>
Snowden asked the district attorney to investigate Regan for the alleged 
illegal interception of his messages, but a four-month inquiry yielded 
insufficient evidence to warrant prosecution, according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Glasgow has stated publicly that he will not resign over the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The council on Monday also seated its newest member, Jay Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey, a pharmaceuticals salesman, won the council seat on his second try. 
He is a fiscal conservative and an advocate of slow growth. 
</P>
<P>
The election of Humphrey, combined with the defeat of staunchly pro-development 
councilman Orville Amburgey, may move the council to take a more critical view 
of development projects.

JUDGE: SPEED-TRAP CASE THREATENS RICO; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: A FINDING OF EXTORTION COULD BANKRUPT HUNTINGTON BEACH AND FORCE THE 
GOVERNMENT TO REPEAL OR MODIFY THE ANTI-RACKETEERING LAW.

<P>
After hearing arguments that the city of Huntington Beach engaged in 
racketeering by allegedly operating a speed trap, a judge said Monday that the 
case could ultimately result in the repeal or revision of federal racketeering 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson said in court that the speed-trap case, 
while unusual, seems to fit under the federal government's controversial 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that operation of a speed trap falls under the RICO law, and that 
Huntington Beach could be rendered bankrupt if it loses the case, could prompt 
reform efforts, Wilson said. He noted that there are many critics who contend 
that the law, which was designed to fight organized crime, has been unwisely 
applied in civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows?" Wilson said. "This (case) may be the straw that breaks the camel's 
back. You may be in an historic position." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson could issue a summary judgment in the case -- a decision without a trial 
-- or direct a jury trial to hear the evidence. Alternatively, the judge might 
order all or part of plaintiff's pleas to be granted, without a trial. Wilson 
said he will issue an order later this week. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed last spring by Ernest J. Franceschi Jr., asks for $60 million 
in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Franceschi, a Seal Beach lawyer, was arrested three times for speeding on a 
stretch of Pacific Coast Highway in Huntington Beach. His suit charges that the 
city was operating an illegal speed trap and that this constitutes extortion -- 
getting money through threats or misuse of authority. 
</P>
<P>
The city denies the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
State law says a speed trap exists whenever a local government uses radar to 
enforce a speed limit below 55 m.p.h. without having made a traffic and 
engineering survey within the past five years. Such traffic surveys 
scientifically determine what the appropriate speed limit should be. 
</P>
<P>
Franceschi has submitted evidence to federal court showing that Huntington 
Beach's traffic and engineering survey has been out of date for about nine 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Deputy City Atty. Robert Sangster argued that there was no 
extortion because cited motorists always had the option of going to court. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson responded, "Why isn't it extortion?. . . The driver is being told, 'We 
got you. We got you on the radar gun.' " Wilson said the arrested drivers in 
such cases do not know the use of radar, without an up-to-date traffic survey, 
is illegal. Thus, said Wilson, many motorists simply forfeit bail and do not go 
to court. 
</P>
<P>
Sangster, in rebuttal, said no arrested motorist actually gives up anything in 
such cases. "There is no transfer of property," Sangster said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge responded: "Oh, yes there is." 
</P>
<P>
Franceschi's suit asks that all persons arrested since 1981 in Huntington 
Beach's alleged speed trap have their records cleared. The suit also estimates 
that the city and municipal courts took in about $20 million during the past 
nine years. RICO allows triple damages, and so the suit asks $60 million to be 
distributed to motorists who have been fined or who gave up bail because of 
alleged speed-trap arrests.

WRONG-WAY DRIVER WANTED ONLY 'TO SLEEP' BEFORE FATAL FREEWAY COLLISION

<P>
Minutes before entering the San Diego Freeway in the wrong direction, Faith 
Robinson reportedly called her boyfriend early Saturday morning to say that she 
would be leaving a friend's house and just wanted "to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
"From what we've been able to piece together, she was just exhausted," said 
Robinson's mother, Jeri Robinson, as she and the family Monday began piecing 
together the moments before Saturday morning's fiery crash that left an Irvine 
man dead and his wife in a coma. 
</P>
<P>
As the Robinson family attempted to recount the events in a cramped waiting 
room at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where their daughter was in critical 
condition, police were also trying to learn what caused the 23-year-old woman 
to continue in the wrong lane of traffic for about 8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol officers, who gave chase but could not catch up with 
the wrong-way Buick Regal, reported that the vehicle weaved between lanes while 
traveling southbound in the northbound freeway lanes before ramming a car 
driven by an Irvine couple near the Bristol Street off-ramp in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Johnson, an officer with the California Highway Patrol, said Robinson has 
been arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. 
Blood-test results were not available Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Killed in the crash was civil engineer Sang In Ahn, 50. His wife, Ook-Ja, 47, 
remained in critical condition Monday night at UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Jeri Robinson said her daughter left home about 10 p.m. Friday and went to the 
home of a friend, identified only as Tracy. The mother said Tracy told her that 
she and Faith talked until 3 a.m. Saturday, adding that Faith may have had one 
or two beers while they were visiting. 
</P>
<P>
When Tracy went to bed, . Robinson said, Faith stayed to talk with Tracy's 
brother until nearly 4 a.m. when she called her boyfriend, Steve Howard, and 
left word on his answering machine that she would soon leave. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 minutes later, Jeri Robinson said, her daughter left another message 
on the boyfriend's recorder, saying: "I'm really leaving. I just want to sleep. 
I'm tired." 
</P>
<P>
At 4:40 a.m., Johnson said, the CHP received a call from a mobile phone user to 
report that a vehicle had entered the San Diego Freeway at Westminster 
Boulevard heading in the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said four patrol cars, two from Santa Ana and two from Westminster, 
were dispatched in the southbound lanes in an attempt to get Robinson's 
attention and get her vehicle out of the path of oncoming traffic.

A Dana Hills High School teacher charged with sexually assaulting a 17-year-old 
female student during a field trip was placed Monday on a compulsory leave 
without pay, a district spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Capistrano Unified School District Board of Trustees, meeting in a 
closed-door session Monday night, placed Michael W. Gaskins on mandatory leave 
pending the outcome of his criminal case, which was filed in Inyo Superior 
Court on Nov. 16, district spokeswoman Jacqueline Cerra said. 
</P>
<P>
Gaskins, 43, had been on administrative leave with pay since Oct. 25, when 
school district officials were first notified that he was the target of an 
investigation by the Inyo County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation stemmed from an Oct. 21 school-sponsored science field trip 
at Serales Lake in Last Chance Canyon in Inyo County. A 17-year-old female 
student alleges that she was sexually assaulted by Gaskins during the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Gaskins has been charged with one felony count of sexual battery and one 
misdemeanor count of annoying a child under 18, according to a criminal 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Gaskins has been a teacher with Capistrano School District for 17 years, Cerra 
said.

A 39-year-old San Clemente lifeguard suffered a severe cut in his left arm 
Monday morning when a boat struck him as he was skin-diving off San Clemente 
State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Edward Brousard underwent emergency surgery at Samaritan Medical 
Center-San Clemente to repair a 10-inch cut that pierced an artery and veins in 
the tricep, said Richard Stone, the hospital's nursing supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Brousard was struck by a 22-foot outboard motor boat driven by Philip Edwards, 
52, of San Clemente, according to the Sheriff's Department. Edwards told 
deputies he was traveling south about 300 feet from shore about 9:45 a.m. when 
he felt a bump that turned out to be Brousard. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards pulled Brousard aboard the boat and took him to lifeguards at San 
Clemente Pier. 
</P>
<P>
Brousard said he heard a boat approaching while diving in about 15 feet of 
water and was hit after he surfaced so he could be seen.

GARY SLIPS A BIT AS RAMS RISE; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: RUNNING BACK REMAINS STARTER, BUT HE HAS COMPETITION, AND FUMBLES 
HAVE NOT HELPED HIS CAUSE.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the darkest moments of this season, one thing that always seemed to shine 
was that Cleveland Gary was and would be the Rams' tailback from here to 
football eternity. 
</P>
<P>
Gary was the man, the workhorse, the next of John Robinson's 1,000-yard 
rushers, and if you doubted that, well, all the Ram coach did was keep giving 
him the ball and all Gary did was break tackles, pile up the numbers and score 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the Rams' season brightens in the glow of two consecutive victories, 
Gary's individual star suddenly has dimmed, thanks to his recent fumbling 
plague and the emergence of a few other tailbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Gary has fumbled nine times this season and lost five of them -- including lost 
drops in each of the last three weeks, one of which Robinson concedes cost the 
Rams the Dallas game -- and a possible three-game winning streak -- last month. 
After fumbling on the second possession of their 38-23 victory over the 
Cleveland Browns last Sunday, Gary spent most of the rest of the game watching 
backup Gaston Green play effectively. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, at his weekly media luncheon, Robinson did not exactly go out of his 
way to defend Gary, even as he was telling of his joy with his team's upswing 
to 5-7. Robinson even suggested that the newest Ram tailback, Marcus Dupree, 
could start playing more. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams will play the New Orleans Saints (5-7) Sunday in a game that for all 
intents will knock the loser out of the wild-card race, but it is not clear 
exactly who the Rams' main rusher will be. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll both play," Robinson said of Gary, who still retains at least his 
starting status, and Green. "I don't have a real ability in my mind to go into 
a game and say I'm going to play this person this much or the second series. 
</P>
<P>
"I will get Gaston in earlier. As you've seen over the last three, four weeks, 
he's come in a game in the first quarter or early in the second. And I will 
continue to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Although Robinson still obviously would like Gary to do most of the work, he 
said that Gary has to learn that consistent fumbling cannot go unpunished. 
</P>
<P>
Gary has gained 651 yards in 169 carries this year after missing training camp 
and the first few weeks of the season with a back injury, and Robinson 
emphasizes that the second-year player simply needs to grow as a runner. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson praised Gary's ability to gain yards the hard way, but gaining yards 
doesn't help if the ball is rolling around under defensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just got to hold the ball tighter," Robinson said. "I've never been a 
coach who said, 'Oh, you fumbled. You're out.' That's bull, I think. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think he's going through a period where he has to become responsible in 
terms of the ball. And I'm not saying he's irresponsible. I just think he's 
learning. He's learning that it's important, that we lose the game when he 
fumbles, he comes out of the game when he fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost a game because he fumbled. You know, he'd be a 1,000-yard rusher right 
now if he'd played the whole season, and if he'd been the ballcarrier (Sunday), 
he'd have had 130, 140 yards." 
</P>
<P>
Green, the Rams' No. 1 pick three seasons ago, gained 57 yards in 13 carries 
Sunday, pushing his season total to 194 yards in 44 carries, a 4.4-yard 
average. Green, who has never been able to establish himself with Robinson, 
seems at least to have caught his eye this time. 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson didn't sound as if he is ready to unleash Green, and for now, it 
appears that Green will continue in a subsidiary role. Green's style of running 
is in direct contrast to Gary's rough-and-tumble-for-four-yards method. Green, 
Robinson said, needs holes to run through, and that has never been Robinson's 
style. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not the same kind of elusive person that (Dave Meggett of the New York 
Giants or Eric Metcalf of the Cleveland Browns) are," Robinson said. "He's a 
speed person. Those people are people that you cannot get a hold of, 
theoretically. . . . He's a good player, but I don't think we want to confuse 
him with those kinds of people." 
</P>
<P>
Dupree, the third and most intriguing name in the tailback mix, has shown 
flashes of his old flair after coming back from a five-year-old knee injury.

<P>
First, there was the off-season announcement that he was being moved to the 
right side of the defensive alignment to improve the Rams' woeful pass rush. 
Then, there was the heralded holdout which ended on the eve of the 
regular-season opener. A 3-7 start glaringly deemed the grand experiment a 
failure and Kevin Greene was moved back to his right outside linebacker 
position. Greene proved Sunday that he was all the way back to his 1989 form 
when he sacked Cleveland Brown quarterback Bernie Kosar three times to bring 
his season total to 10. With four regular-season games left, it's possible for 
the Auburn product to match the 16- 1/2-sack effort he's recorded the last two 
seasons.

PROPOSAL TO RELEAGUE SERVITE, ROSARY DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Southern Section's releaguing committee has rejected Servite and Rosary 
high schools' requests to be placed in the Orange County geographic area with 
public schools for the purpose of being placed in a county athletic league for 
the 1992-94 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the 10-member committee, chaired by principal Michael 
Phillips of Pomona High School, accepted requests by Mater Dei and Santa 
Margarita to move into the Orange County geographic area, opening the door for 
the Catholic schools to play in the same leagues with public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, all private schools in Orange County compete against other private 
schools from Orange County and other counties in what is called the private 
geographic area by the Southern Section. But escalating transportation costs 
have forced administrators to look at alternatives for next season. 
</P>
<P>
Member schools of the Southern Section were asked to submit to the committee 
written requests to be moved to a new geographic area. The committee made its 
decision Thursday at the Southern Section office in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
The schools will have the opportunity to appeal the decision at the Southern 
Section Executive Committee's meeting in January. Athletic administrators at 
Servite and Rosary said they are planning to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision was made based upon the difficulty of scheduling an all-boys or 
all-girls school," said Jim Ryan, Foothill principal, who sat on the committee. 
Servite is a private all-boys school with 650 students, and Rosary is a private 
all-girls school with 575 students. 
</P>
<P>
"The schools applied individually as separate applicants, and although the 
possibility of accepting the schools as one entity was discussed, there wasn't 
enough information supplied to the committee to accept them at this time," Ryan 
said. "It's going to take some time to iron out the kinks." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Vitello, athletic director at Servite, said he was very upset with the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed," Vitello said. "Where do we go to play? The only alternative 
is to remain in the CAA (Catholic Athletic Assn.) and play Bishop Amat, Loyola 
and St. John Bosco. We've been blackballed from Orange County."

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: ANNE MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
School: Dana Hills High School 
</P>
<P>
Sport: Tennis 
</P>
<P>
Position: No. 1 Singles 
</P>
<P>
Class: Junior 
</P>
<P>
Despite aggravating a groin muscle and playing in pain for much of the match, 
Mall defeated Nicole Hummel of San Marino to win the Southern Section 
individual singles championship Friday. Although it took Mall three sets to 
dispatch Hummel, her sweep of Keri Phebus of Corona del Mar in the semifinals 
might be more noteworthy. 
</P>
<P>
Mall had never beaten Phebus, the section's two-time defending champion, in 
either USTA junior competition or in three high school seasons. Mall avenged 
her only two losses of the season. Phebus had beaten Mall twice -- in a 
nonleague match and the semifinals of the Division 4-A team playoffs. Mall, who 
recently won the USTA National Indoor Hardcourt singles championship, is on 
pace to graduate after her junior year. She plans on either concentrating on 
tennis or attending a four-year university on a tennis scholarship next year. 
</P>
<P>
Other top performers: 
</P>
<P>
Missy Clements, who had 14 kills and three blocks to lead La Habra to a 
three-game sweep over King City Saturday as the Highlanders won their second 
consecutive state Division II volleyball championship. 
</P>
<P>
Olivia DiCamilli, who had 39 points and 19 rebounds in Costa Mesa's 65-59 
victory over Huntington Beach in a nonleague basketball game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Murray, who scored four goals in an 8-0 Esperanza soccer victory over El 
Modena Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Schriber, who had 13 kills and was named the tournament's most valuable 
player in leading Corona del Mar to a four-game victory over Mountain View St. 
Francis in the state Division I championship match Saturday.

The Upper Deck trading card company, which is based in Yorba Linda, has signed 
a five-year contract to sponsor the series of baseball old-timers' games 
formerly sponsored by the Equitable. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement, Upper Deck will donate a minimum of $260,000 to the 
Baseball Assistance Team, an organization that helps former major and minor 
league baseball personnel who are in financial need. 
</P>
<P>
Upper Deck has grown from a staff of seven people two years ago to 450 
employees in four buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The "Heroes of Baseball" series, which consists of one game at each of the 26 
major league stadiums, will add events to make the games more attractive to 
young fans, according to Bodow. HELENE ELLIOTT

ANGELS ARE CLOSE TO ANOTHER DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: ORIOLES' OUTFIELDER GALLAGHER MIGHT JOIN CLUB IN EXCHANGE FOR TWO 
MINOR LEAGUE PLAYERS.

Sounding more like a weather forecaster predicting the chances of rain than a 
baseball executive discussing a deal, Angel President Richard Brown said 
there's a 100% chance his club will announce a trade today. 
</P>
<P>
"That's give or take 5%," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources, the Angels will take outfielder Dave Gallagher from 
Baltimore and give the Orioles David Martinez, who was 6-6 with double-A 
Midland last season and is on the Angels' 40-man roster, and Mike Hook, who was 
6-3 with Class-A Quad City and 0-1 with Midland. 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher was acquired Aug. 1 by the Orioles after he was placed on waivers 
last season by the Chicago White Sox. Overall, he hit .254 in 68 games with no 
home runs and seven RBIs in 1990. He is expected to back up Junior Felix, who 
was acquired Sunday from Toronto, in center field. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Mike Port said he could neither confirm nor deny the deal but 
did say the Angels are seeking depth in center. 
</P>
<P>
"Though we expect Junior to play out there, in the event Junior needs to be 
spelled and Max (Venable) is a free agent, we're looking for secondary help," 
Port said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the Angels have nothing in the works that would bring them a 
third baseman, but will continue to seek a middle reliever. They remain 
interested in New York Yankee free-agent reliever Dave Righetti but have not 
gone beyond preliminary discussions. The Yankees reportedly will present a new 
offer to Righetti today. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels lost right-hander Brandy Vann to the Milwaukee Brewers in Monday's 
Rule Five draft of unprotected minor league players, leaving him available 
despite having four openings on their 40-man roster. Vann was a combined 3-5 
with a 3.43 earned-run average and 15 saves for Midland of the Texas League and 
Palm Springs of the California League. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have gone to 40 men on the roster, but we thought we'd be better off 
draft-wise and deal-wise to leave some space," Port said. "We're complimented 
by their interest in somebody developed by our organization, but we still have 
an awful lot of good, young arms left." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have renewed their interest in finding a new spring-training site 
and soon will meet with officials of groups from Arizona and Florida. An offer 
was made by a group from Gilbert, Ariz., but no agreement is near. Brown said 
the Angels are working with the HOK organization, which does stadium 
feasibility studies and construction, to determine their options. They would 
move for the 1993 exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first priority is Arizona, but Arizona would have to give us something 
acceptable physically and financially," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels begin spring training in Mesa, Ariz., and move to Palm Springs for 
the final 10 days. Their facility in Mesa -- for which they pay an annual rent 
of $1 to the city -- has adequate practice facilities but no spectator seating, 
forcing the Angels to play their Arizona exhibition games on the road. They 
have investigated other training sites in recent years but have never found a 
satisfactory location. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, Brown said the Angels would like a deal similar to that enjoyed by the 
New York Mets in Port St. Lucie, Fla. A training complex with six fields was 
built at no cost to the Mets in hopes their presence would generate tourism and 
spending in Port St. Lucie. The Cleveland Indians announced plans to move from 
Tucson to Citrus City, Fla., in 1993 and will play in a tax-financed complex. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jackie Autry, Angel executive vice president and wife of owner 
Gene Autry, the team will be scheduled for more games in Arizona and fewer in 
Palm Springs in 1992. She said the Angels are not considering moving to the 
Indians' Tucson complex. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have responsibilities to baseball and we have to be sure that our 
leaving would not dismantle the Cactus League," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the matter will take priority when the winter meetings conclude. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The players to be named in the trade made Sunday by the Angels and Toronto Blue 
Jays will be identified after today's minor league draft. . . . The Oakland 
Athletics have made an offer to free agent infielder Donnie Hill.

AT&amp;T REACHES OUT TO GRAB A CHUNK OF COMPUTER MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of asking customers to "reach out and touch someone," American 
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is doing some reaching out of its own. 
</P>
<P>
And some grabbing. 
</P>
<P>
Within the last year, AT&amp;T jumped into the financial services business with 
the introduction of a calling-cum-credit card that has already attracted 30 
million customers and become one of the nation's most widely held cards. 
</P>
<P>
In the last six months, the company has doubled promotional spending -- to 
nearly $700 million by some estimates -- to win back long-distance customers 
from upstart competitors MCI and U.S. Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
And Sunday, in its most dramatic move yet, AT&amp;T launched an unsolicited -- 
and apparently unwanted -- $6-billion bid to buy NCR Corp., the nation's 
fifth-largest computer maker, in a bold effort to bolster its still unfulfilled 
attempts to become a computer industry power. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that the AT&amp;T of today is more entrepreneurial," says 
Craig Ellis, a telecommunications analyst at C. J. Lawrence Inc. in New York. 
"The AT&amp;T of even five years ago wouldn't have done this. But today, this 
is a company that is uncertain about its future, and it is doing something 
about it. It's called reaching out and grabbing something." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, nearly seven years after being deregulated, and then ridiculed and 
raided as it fumbled for its bearings, AT&amp;T appears finally to be 
responding to critics who have wondered when the slumbering giant of long 
distance would awaken and start throwing its weight around the high-technology 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It took AT&amp;T a long time to learn that there are people out there who want 
to kill them. They just didn't have the instincts to fight," says William 
Davidson, a USC professor of business management who specializes in 
telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, analysts note that MCI and U.S. Sprint -- until recently -- have had a 
field day at AT&amp;T's expense, winning over long-distance customers and 
bringing AT&amp;T into a costly price war. 
</P>
<P>
But, no more. In recent months, AT&amp;T has started to aggressively fight to 
defend its turf, outspending its competitors' marketing budgets by 10 or more 
times. "They're bludgeoning the market," says Robert B. Morris of Goldman Sachs 
&amp; Co. "It's bound to have an effect." 
</P>
<P>
It is. 
</P>
<P>
MCI recently announced that it will lay off about 1,500 workers nationwide 
because of slumping residential services, and U.S. Sprint has been sputtering 
for several months. But both continue to spend heavily on consumer advertising 
and telemarketing. Morris notes that all together, the Big Three are spending 
more than $2 million a day to promote their services. 
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited evolution of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph from a 
regulated national monopoly with just one business -- long distance -- to a 
hard-charging player in the thick of the hotly competitive data and 
telecommunications industries hasn't come easily. 
</P>
<P>
And it is still far from complete. 
</P>
<P>
But more analysts and observers are convinced that the company is serious about 
making its presence felt, both in its core long-distance business, as well as 
in limited portions of the computer and financial services operations that rely 
on and enhance the long-distance business. 
</P>
<P>
"The company is finally getting its act together," says William Redmond, a 
former AT&amp;T employee and now vice president of the network services 
analysis unit at the Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Still, with annual revenue of about $36 billion and a long-distance market 
share in excess of 60%, AT&amp;T is still careful not to stomp its competitors 
so hard that regulators will increase their hold. In fact, AT&amp;T is still 
trying to persuade the Federal Communications Commission to drop the company's 
designation as the dominant carrier on the theory that competition is so severe 
that it no longer deserves the label and the tighter federal regulation that it 
brings. 
</P>
<P>
But, although the company has been walking a fine line in the long-distance 
business, its attempts to make a mark in the computer industry have not been 
constrained by anything other than the company's own ineptitude, according to 
several analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Despite efforts to start a business from scratch within its organization and 
then forge alliances with such computer hot shots as Sun Microsystems and 
Olivetti, AT&amp;T has failed so far to cash in on that promise. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of companies have invested in private computer network services to get 
what AT&amp;T could have delivered," says Douglas Gold, telecommunications 
research chief at International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
The move on NCR, which supplies an enviable share of the computer and 
networking needs for the financial services and retail industries, is designed 
to remedy all this. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that this is a major strategic move for AT&amp;T," says 
Mark Fowler, former FCC chairman and now a Washington lawyer. "This is a move 
from a 1990s AT&amp;T that fully knows that it has to be in the computer 
business as well as the data transmission business, and that it has to be able 
to integrate the two." 
</P>
<P>
Cynics -- and there are still many who remain unconvinced that AT&amp;T can 
make the transformation -- argue that the company's moves into credit cards and 
computers are defensive maneuvers, designed more to mask sagging long-distance 
operations than provide strategic new business opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the company's share of the long-distance market has dwindled from 
80% at the end of 1984 to about 62% in mid-1990, Ellis of C. J. Lawrence argues 
that the company's latest moves are aimed at maintaining earnings growth, not 
creating structural and strategic alliances. 
</P>
<P>
"AT&amp;T would like you to believe all that, but it's all too linear and 
simple," Ellis says. "And perhaps they are diversifying too far."

First Executive Restructures Debt, Halts Dividends: The Los Angeles-based life 
insurance company, battered by souring investments in junk bonds, said it has 
reached a preliminary agreement to restructure $275 million of its senior debt. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement requires the company to pay its banks and some other creditors 
$30 million in cash and pledge "certain assets" as collateral on new loans that 
will come due in 1996, 1997 and 1998. Some debt will also be canceled in 
exchange for real estate held by First Executive. However, the deal prohibits 
the company from paying about $11 million in quarterly cash dividends on its 
preferred shares.

Avon Pushed to Buy Back Stock: A group of powerful investors increased its 
pressure on the management of Avon Products Inc. to repurchase $500 million of 
its own shares. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the cosmetics company's chairman, James E. Preston, Chartwell 
Associates said the move would "enhance value for all shareholders." John Cox, 
a spokesman for the New York-based firm, said there was nothing new in the 
recommendation. Chartwell, a limited partnership that includes oil heir Gordon 
P. Getty's Family Trust, controls about 20% of Avon's stock.

Visa Imposes Membership Moratorium: Visa U.S.A. said the six-month moratorium 
on allowing new applicants from non-banking companies to issue its credit cards 
was a "prudent measure" while it reviews Visa membership eligibility in 
general. Institutions not eligible to join Visa directly would not be allowed 
to join indirectly by merging or acquiring a member company without the 
approval of Visa's board, the company said.

LOCKHEED TURNS DOWN SIMMONS' TAKEOVER BID; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: THE AEROSPACE FIRM'S NEWLY EXPANDED BOARD SAYS THE FINANCING IN THE 
$1.6-BILLION PLAN WOULD LOAD THE COMPANY WITH TOO MUCH DEBT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A newly expanded Lockheed Corp. board of directors Monday unanimously rejected 
a $1.6-billion takeover offer from Texas investor Harold C. Simmons, concluding 
that the financing arrangements in the buyout plan would burden the company 
with too much debt. 
</P>
<P>
The board action is the latest episode in Simmons' yearlong struggle to gain 
control of the Calabasas-based aerospace firm. Lockheed management defeated 
Simmons in a proxy battle for control of the company's board by getting the 
support of shareholders at the firm's March 29 annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The enlarged board fulfills a promise the company made at that annual meeting 
to provide pension fund managers and other institutional holders of Lockheed 
stock with direct representation on the board. Four new board members, selected 
from a list of nominees proposed by the company's largest institutional 
investors, joined 14 other directors Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons-controlled NL Industries, Lockheed's largest single shareholder with 
19% of the stock, does not have representation on the board. After the Lockheed 
board rejected NL's $40-a-share offer, NL President J. Landis Martin disclosed 
that he asked Lockheed last August to allow NL to place three of its own 
representatives on the board. Lockheed on Monday acknowledged that it rejected 
the request. It said other candidates were more qualified than Martin's 
nominees. 
</P>
<P>
The buyout proposal called for Lockheed to borrow about $800 million to help 
Simmons finance the deal. NL would have provided the other $800 million -- half 
of it from available funds and the other $400 million by selling some NL assets 
and by borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
However, a letter Monday from Lockheed Chairman Daniel Tellep to Martin said 
Lockheed has "serious doubt about the ability to raise funds necessary" to 
complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"In this (economic) environment, we believe that reliance on potential asset 
transactions to finance your proposal is highly risky," Tellep's letter said. 
</P>
<P>
The board also rejected the offer because Lockheed would have had to refinance 
about $1.2 billion of its existing debt under the proposed arrangement, Tellep 
said. Some of the refinancing would have been required because the terms of 
some Lockheed loans call for immediate repayment under any change of corporate 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the rejection during an interview Monday, Martin contended that 
Lockheed could handle the cost of new loans and the refinancing with money that 
now goes to shareholders in the form of dividends. Martin said NL may launch 
another proxy campaign against Lockheed's board. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked them to give us any evidence that the proposal is not feasible," 
Martin said. "They haven't given us evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed stock closed at $30.25 a share, down 37.5 cents in trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The new directors are: Frank Savage, vice president of Equitable Life Assurance 
Society; Carlisle A. H. Trost, a retired admiral and former chief of naval 
operations; Douglas C. Yearley, chairman of Phelps Dodge Corp., a Phoenix-based 
copper producer, and Robert G. Kirby, chairman of Capital Guardian Trust Co., a 
Los Angeles-based investment management firm.

CONSTRUCTION OUTLAYS LIFTED BY PUBLIC SECTOR; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: HOME BUILDING REMAINED WEAK. OTHER REPORTS INDICATED A SLACKENING 
ECONOMY AND FEWER LOANS BEING TAKEN OUT BY CONSUMERS.

Record spending on public projects during October boosted construction for the 
first time since July, the Commerce Department said Monday, but private home 
builders remained in the doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said the public spending surge would be temporary because 
governments at all levels -- federal, state and local -- are too financially 
strapped to continue putting more money into roads, sewers and other 
taxpayer-financed activities. 
</P>
<P>
In all, spending on construction of all types increased to $434.4 billion in 
October from $428.9 billion, the department said. It followed a decline of 2.8% 
in September, no change in August and a slight $200-million increase in July 
over June. 
</P>
<P>
But spending on residential projects -- new homes and apartments -- fell to 
$179.5 billion from $181.2 billion in September and was the lowest since March, 
1986, when spending was $177.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage Assn. -- Fannie 
Mae -- said consumers are so worried about the Middle East crisis that they are 
unwilling to buy new homes. 
</P>
<P>
Obrinsky said the earliest that housing construction is likely to revive is 
during 1991's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is consumer sentiment even more than lower interest rates," Obrinsky 
said. "If the Middle East situation worsens, we'll likely have to set back 
forecasts for recovery." 
</P>
<P>
Nonresidential building activity also weakened in October, to $102 billion from 
$102.8 billion in September and $104.4 billion in August. The category includes 
factories, hotels and office buildings, all of which have suffered because of a 
weaker national economy. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the nation's purchasing managers reported that their index of the 
economy's vigor fell for the fifth straight month to 41.3% in November -- the 
lowest level in eight years -- as new orders plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
The 7.7% rise in public spending during October, to a record $117.8 billion 
from $109.4 billion, is seen as a short-term boost. It surpassed the previous 
record of $115.8 billion set in August, 1989, department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Spending on schools, highways and sewers increased from September levels. 
</P>
<P>
In another industry report, a banking group reported that consumers continued 
to pay their bills in the July-September quarter but were scaling back 
borrowing as the economy headed into what many analysts say is a recession.

DOW ADDS 5.94 ON HOPES FOR PEACE IN GULF

Stocks rose moderately Monday, bolstered by optimism about a peaceful solution 
to the Iraq crisis and by a major takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index, which rose 40.84 points on Friday, added 5.94 
to close at 2,565.59. The Dow's rise was held back by AT&amp;T's loss of 2 to 
30 1/8, on word of its takeover bid for NCR Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in 
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 964 up, 612 down and 444 
unchanged. Most broad-market indexes advanced about 0.5% for the day, with 
over-the-counter stocks registering sharper gains. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume slipped to 177.01 million shares from Friday's 192.35 million. 
</P>
<P>
Overtures of peace in the Persian Gulf, which sent oil prices plunging and 
boosted stocks Friday, continued to provide support on Wall Street on Monday. 
Oil prices were mixed, with the January crude contract on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange rising 30 cents to $29.15 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
During the weekend, Baghdad signaled that it would accept President Bush's 
offer for direct talks. 
</P>
<P>
News that AT&amp;T made an unsolicited stock-swap bid worth $90 a share, or $6 
billion, for NCR helped the overall market. Such large acquisition bids have 
become rare in the past year as financing has dried up. 
</P>
<P>
"The (AT&amp;T) bid indicates there may be a lot more liquidity than many 
think," said Alan Newman, a technical analyst at H. D. Brous &amp; Co. "If 
there's still enough liquidity for deals like this and MCA/Matsushita, that's 
good news." 
</P>
<P>
Last week MCA Inc. agreed to be taken over by Matsushita in a $6.59-billion 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
News of the AT&amp;T bid "underscores the fact that a lot of companies are 
still pretty cheap," argues analyst John Brooks of Davis, Mendel &amp; 
Regenstein. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* NCR rocketed 24 3/4 to 81 1/2 on news of the $90 AT&amp;T bid. The wide price 
spread suggested that Wall Street was wary of the deal. Other tech stocks were 
mostly higher on the news, and on optimism about computer sales despite the 
weak economy. (Story, D2.) AT&amp;T lost 2 to 30 1/8 on worries that it may be 
overpaying for NCR. 
</P>
<P>
* Airline stocks rose on expectations that they might benefit from the decision 
of Continental Airlines to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. AMR, 
parent of American Airlines, rose 1 1/4 to 48 1/2. UAL, parent of United, 
jumped 1 7/8 to 99 3/8. Also, Delta rose 1 3/4 to 58 1/2, Southwest rocketed 1 
3/8 to 18 7/8 and USAir inched up 3/8 to 14 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Some retailing stocks gained after a Goldman Sachs analyst made favorable 
comments. Limited rose 1 1/2 to 17 1/4, Gap added 1 3/8 to 33 and Wal-Mart rose 
3/4 to 30 7/8. Also, Kmart rose 1 3/8 to 28 and Home Depot jumped 2 to 37 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Some home builders' stocks rallied. Kaufman &amp; Broad rose 1 to 8 and 
Centex added 1 1/8 to 24 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
In Germany, share prices rose strongly on the back of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 
election victory and on improved prospects for peace in the Persian Gulf. The 
30-share DAX index ended 21.35 points higher at 1,462.58. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks finished higher after a calm session on London's Stock Exchange. The 
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 13.3 at 2,162.7. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks closed higher but well off their highs after early optimism 
over the Middle East crisis faded. The 225-share Nikkei average ended up 271.36 
points at 22,725.99. At midday today, the Nikkei was off 580.67 at 22,145.32.

CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Momentum Carries Bond Prices Higher 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were up moderately in a lightly traded market energized by 
lingering momentum from Friday's sharp advance. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up 11/32 point, or $3.44 per $1,000 
in face amount. Its yield eased to 8.36% from 8.39% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Credit market participants said it was a day of quiet reflection and profit 
taking for traders who aggressively bought bonds and notes Friday. Bonds 
settled at prices close to early-day highs built on the heated overseas 
activity that followed President Bush's diplomatic initiative to Iraq and the 
subsequent plunge in oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 7.438%, down from 7.50% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Traders' Wariness of Talks Bolsters Dollar 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose against major foreign currencies as the prospect of direct 
talks between Iraq and the United States failed to convince traders that a war 
in the Persian Gulf will be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar bought 1.513 German marks late Monday, compared to 
1.502 Friday. It soared against the Japanese yen to 134.73 from 132.50 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Many traders don't believe that talks between the United States and Iraq will 
head off a war, the risk of which has pushed the dollar higher because of its 
status as a safe haven. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

<P>
High Demand Seen; Soybean Prices Soar 
</P>
<P>
Prices of soybean futures bounded to five-week highs Monday on the Chicago 
Board of Trade in a late rally fueled by signs of tight supplies and prospects 
for stronger export demand. Most grain futures also advanced. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures settled 4.25 to 11.75 cents higher in Chicago, with the 
contract for delivery in January at $6.01 a bushel, the first daily close above 
$6 for a near-term contract since Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat finished 1.50 to 2.50 cents higher, with December at $2.48 a bushel; corn 
was 0.25 cent lower to 2.50 cents higher, with December at $2.30 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
The surge began in the soybean oil pit after a large number of oil delivery 
notices were canceled, indicating that soybean oil supplies for delivery 
against the December contract may be tighter than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Freed, grains analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said soybeans also were 
boosted by reports that Germany is considering selling at least some of its 
excess soybean crushing capacity to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, near-term oil futures gained 30 cents to $29.15 a barrel on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange, following Friday's rout. Gold futures fell sharply on 
New York's Commodity Exchange as the dollar rose. The dollar competes with gold 
for safe-haven money. Gold settled $6.70 to $7.70 lower, with December at 
$376.60 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Silver, however, was 1 cent to 1.6 cents higher, with December at $4.14 an 
ounce.

JUDGE SETS TOUGHER RESTRICTIONS TO MONITOR KEATING

A Superior Court judge Monday ordered indicted Arizona businessman Charles H. 
Keating Jr. to begin a stricter weekly check-in schedule after prosecutors 
complained that the former thrift executive couldn't be found over the 
Thanksgiving Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Lance A. Ito ordered Keating and the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office to choose a specific day and time for weekly check-ins by 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"That way, you don't have to play phone tag with each other," Ito said. 
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old Keating is free on $500,000 bail while he awaits trial on 46 
counts of state securities fraud. He has been required to check in weekly with 
authorities, but previously was not required to adhere to a specific time and 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, the former owner of the defunct Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, was two 
days late over the Thanksgiving Day weekend in contacting prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman said Keating had given prosecutors a 
telephone number and a time to call him on the Friday after Thanksgiving, but 
no one answered when a district attorney's investigator called. 
</P>
<P>
The investigator also called one of Keating's lawyers in Chicago, and the 
lawyer tried reaching Keating. But Keating had changed his unlisted telephone 
number to another unlisted number, and the lawyer didn't get through until 
Sunday. Keating called the investigator on the Sunday after Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's lead lawyer, Stephen C. Neal, called the prosecutor's action a 
"trumped-up issue," but Hodgman said Keating simply wasn't where he said he 
would be. "Mr. Keating's got to play by the same rules as any other defendant," 
Hodgman said. 
</P>
<P>
Keating appeared at the hearing, but Neal would not allow him to respond to 
reporters' questions. 
</P>
<P>
Ito also scheduled a Jan. 11 hearing on defense motions to dismiss 26 counts 
because Keating's lawyers say the counts fail to allege a crime or are vague. 
Those counts are the new and expanded versions of 22 counts that Ito had set 
aside on similar grounds Nov. 9. He allowed prosecutors to amend the 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys also contend that prosecutors can't amend accusations in a 
grand jury indictment without approval from the grand jury. State law allows 
prosecutors to make minor changes in indictments but requires that major 
changes be approved by the same or a new grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 20 counts also are being attacked by the defense on grounds that 
the grand jury returned the indictment without reasonable or probable cause. 
Ito will set a hearing on that issue later. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, who is the former chairman of American Continental Corp., is accused 
with three other former executives of misleading small investors who bought 
some $200 million in the company's bonds at the Southern California branches of

worthless since the company filed for bankruptcy protection in April, 1989.

AMERICA WEST TO OFFER DISCOUNT FARES TO BAY AREA; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: THE PHOENIX-BASED CARRIER WILL GO ALL OUT FOR BUSINESS TRAVELERS WITH 
A $79 TICKET FROM JOHN WAYNE TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

America West Airlines said Monday that it will enter the competition for 
business travelers between Northern and Southern California with fares that 
undercut by more than half the cheapest, unrestricted one-way flight between 
Orange County and San Francisco 
</P>
<P>
Starting Feb. 1, the airline will offer eight daily flights from John Wayne 
Airport at a cost of $79 one-way for last-minute ticket purchases. The cheapest 
unrestricted flight now between Orange County and the Bay Area is $168 one-way. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's a business market and there are opportunities to attract 
businessmen at $79," said Sherril Newton, manager of pricing for Phoenix-based 
America West, a regional carrier known for its discount service. 
</P>
<P>
The company also said it will match the $29, one-way restricted fare -- sold on 
a limited number of seats usually to non-business consumers -- offered by the 
other airlines that fly the route, which are USAir, United Airlines and its 
commuter partner, United Express. 
</P>
<P>
America West also announced a $79 unrestricted and $29 restricted one-way fare 
between Long Beach and San Jose; currently only United Airlines flies that 
route, offering an unrestricted fare one way of $142 and a restricted fare of 
$46. The two daily flights from Long Beach begin Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
America West's announcement could prompt a fare war at John Wayne, which has 
traditionally had some of the highest ticket prices among Southland airports. 
"We think that everybody else is going to match the fare," said Peter 
Otradovec, planning manager for America West. 
</P>
<P>
High fares at John Wayne have been attributed to noise and other restrictions 
that have limited the number of flights and the high percentage of business 
passengers, who are less cost-conscious than other consumers. 
</P>
<P>
America West's decision to offer flights from Orange County to San Francisco 
comes a month after American Airlines dropped five daily round-trip flights on 
the route, saying its airplanes were not full enough to make the trips 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
But Otradovec said the Orange County-San Francisco route should be a profitable 
one for America West in the long run, although it may not be initially with 
fuel prices as high as they are now, 
</P>
<P>
"American is a very high-cost airlines compared to ours," Otradovec said. "We 
have one of the youngest and most fuel-efficient fleets in the industry because 
we're new." 
</P>
<P>
America West has been in business since 1983. The additional flights announced 
by the company Monday will be the first it has started that do not include its 
hub locations of Phoenix or Las Vegas. The airlines now has 12 flights a day 
from Orange County to Phoenix and Las Vegas and is one of two airlines to have 
a frequent flyer club in Orange County, Otradovec said. 
</P>
<P>
Otradovec said America West is using 737-300 planes with a special 
high-performance engine, called a CFM-B2. The engine is designed for a larger 
plane, the 737-400, and lets the smaller plane gain altitude more quickly, he 
said. Thus, the planes are higher when they pass noise monitors just outside of 
John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Fares between the Los Angeles basin and the Bay Area have been falling since 
spring. No-frills Southwest Airlines, based in Dallas, began flying between 
Northern and Southern California in April with a $58 round-trip fare between 
Oakland and Burbank. Before Southwest entered the Burbank-to-Oakland market, 
fares were averaging $186. After the entry, the unrestricted one-way fare 
dropped to $59.

Choosy Investors: Venture capital investment in the United States has fallen 
from a peak of $5 billion in 1987 to about $1.2 billion in 1990, said Thomas E. 
Winter, who heads the Costa Mesa office of the venture capital firm Burr, Egan, 
Deleage &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Given that shrinking pool, the industry is consolidating and venture 
capitalists are being more picky about what kind of firms they invest in, said 
Winter, whose firm specializes in investing in technology firms. 
</P>
<P>
During the past several years, Winter said he has reviewed about 100 Orange 
County firms over several years and closely scrutinized about 25 of them. Of 
those, his firm decided to invest only in two small biotechnology firms. He 
said he looks for firms that concentrate on a specific market segment and are 
No. 1 or No. 2 in their market. 
</P>
<P>
Winter said he isn't looking for investments that would require more than $10 
million in capital or companies that are hoping to attain only a small share of 
a market with "also-ran" products.

GOVERNMENT WILL TRY TO SELL J.M. PETERS CO.; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: WITH THE TAKEOVER OF SAN JACINTO S&amp;L COMES THE BURDEN OF UNLOADING 
THE BUILDER THAT SHRIVELED IN HOUSING MARKET'S DOWNTURN.

<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government last week acquired another piece of flotsam from the 
wreckage of the thrift industry: J.M. Peters Co. Inc., a local home builder 
owned mostly by San Jacinto Savings &amp; Loan Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators seized San Jacinto on Friday, and on Monday the government 
said it would probably try to sell the home builder, which San Jacinto put up 
for sale more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
An official from the federal Resolution Trust Corp. said the agency plans to 
push a sale "more aggressively" than San Jacinto. The RTC, the agency 
responsible for selling off insolvent S&amp;Ls, tries to trim busted thrifts of 
all their subsidiary companies until they hold nothing but their local 
depositors' money before selling them. 
</P>
<P>
J.M. Peters, however, may be a tough sell. Like other local home builders, the 
company has taken a buffeting this year as sales of the expensive new homes it 
builds all but dried up. Peters has hundreds of unsold houses in its inventory 
and recently stopped new construction. 
</P>
<P>
Individual shareholders, who own 13% of the stock, aren't too happy either. The 
stock has plummeted from a high of nearly $13 per share last year, when the 
housing market was still decent. It closed Monday at $1.125 per share in 
American Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
J.M. Peters is one of Southern California's largest home builders, with 
operations from San Diego to Ventura County, and the only local home builder 
that large that's also publicly held. The company, which rode the crest when 
sales swelled in the boom year of 1988, specializes in single-family homes 
costing from $350,000 to $500,000 that are purchased mostly by people trading 
up to a larger home. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the homes being sold these days, however, are relatively inexpensive -- 
for Southern California -- because it's mostly first-time buyers in the market. 
</P>
<P>
But with a motivated seller like the federal government owning most of the 
company, and with the price of its stock down around its ankles, J.M. Peters 
might seem a good buy to someone willing to hold on until the housing market 
improves. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government may ask for as much as $5 a share, said Mark Matheson, a 
Newport Beach analyst. That puts a value on the company of about $70 million 
for the 14 million shares outstanding. However, the government may have to 
settle for considerably less, Matheson says. 
</P>
<P>
"With the stock down around $1 a share, they may be willing to settle for $3 or 
$4 a share to get the company off their hands," he said. At $3 a share, the 
company would bring $42 million. That's about twice what San Jacinto paid for 
the company in 1985. (But that figure doesn't include the percentage of the 
company's earnings paid to Chairman James M. Peters since 1985 as an incentive 
for him to stay on, an amount which has run into the millions of dollars.) 
</P>
<P>
One potential purchaser is Peters, who would like to re-acquire the company, 
according to a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
That seems a possible scenario because, except for management, one 
home-building company is much like another. And the chairman seems to be a big 
part of the company's attraction, since the incentive agreement San Jacinto 
gave Peters to stay on paid him as much as $6.3 million a few years ago, making 
Peters one of the best-compensated executives of a public company in Orange 
County that year. 
</P>
<P>
The company might not be nearly as desirable unless the new owner could work 
out an agreement to keep Peters and his management team at the helm. On the 
other hand it may be easier to buy the company from the RTC than from San 
Jacinto, once a Houston-based high flier that reportedly rejected as too low a 
buyout offer of $12.50 a share, or about $175 million, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peters said Monday that the RTC is reviewing "proposed 
modifications" to Peters' lines of credit with its parent company, San Jacinto. 
Peters owed San Jacinto a whopping $200 million at the end of the last quarter, 
or about half its total debt. 
</P>
<P>
The company said in a statement that it is negotiating with its other lenders 
for "loan modifications" but would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
It also said former San Jacinto Chairman Lawrence Connell resigned from Peters' 
board. There was no explanation, and Connell couldn't be reached. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure of San Jacinto had been expected for some time. It failed to meet 
all three federal tests for sufficient assets after several years of making 
risky real estate loans. 
</P>
<P>
San Jacinto was in turn owned by Southmark Corp., a Dallas real estate firm 
that recently emerged from federal bankruptcy proceedings. Southmark, too, was 
hit by the downturn in the Texas real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
Then, this year, things went sour for J.M. Peters as well. In September it 
reported its first quarterly loss since going public in 1987, a $451,000 
deficit contrasted with a year-earlier profit of $3.5 million.

J. WALTER THOMPSON FIRES 35 IN L.A.

In the bleakest of beginnings to the holiday season, the Los Angeles office of 
the ad agency J. Walter Thompson on Monday handed walking papers to about 35 
employees -- about one-third of its staff. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs, which follow the agency's decision last week to drop the estimated 
$50-million Bally's Health &amp; Tennis Corp. media-buying business, will take 
effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs are across the board, from secretaries to senior vice presidents. 
</P>
<P>
"This is no time for pep rallies," said William M. Lane, executive vice 
president of the agency, whose largest clients include Vons supermarkets and 
Mexicana Airlines. "This is a very tough day. We're seriously sorry for the 
people who have to leave us. And we're seriously committed to the people who 
will remain." 
</P>
<P>
Although hundreds of Los Angeles advertising agency employees have lost their 
jobs during the year-old industry recession, few offices have felt the effects 
as much as JWT. Two years ago, the agency had up to 200 employees in Los 
Angeles. Today, it employs about 80. 
</P>
<P>
"As a responsible business, we had to make the layoffs," said Lane, whose 
agency dropped the health club chain -- which operates locally as Holiday Spa 
-- because financially ailing Bally's refused to revise its payment schedule. 
Earlier this year, the agency lost the estimated $29-million 20th Century Fox 
account, which also resulted in substantial layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Lane, who has been the top executive at JWT Los Angeles for about six months, 
said he determined how many employees would be let go. "I bit the bullet and 
did it," Lane said. "I'll let people editorialize. I suspect I could come out 
of this looking like the bad guy." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the holiday season, however, Lane said, the layoffs were deferred 
until Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising industry executives say it will not be easy for JWT to bounce back. 
"This would be a devastating blow to any agency," said Stephen Hayman, general 
manager of the Los Angeles office of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding Communications. 
"The big issue is morale. They will have to work on building confidence that 
can bring the office back."

MCGAW SIGNS DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

McGaw Inc. announced Monday that it has signed a four-year agreement valued at 
$45 million with Block Medical Inc. of Carlsbad to distribute Block's 
disposable intravenous therapy products to the home-health-care industry. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement comes six weeks after an investor group led by James Sweeney, an 
Irvine health care entrepreneur, completed its acquisition of Irvine-based 
McGaw for $200 million. McGaw, formerly Kendall McGaw Laboratories Inc., is a 
manufacturer of medicated and nutritional fluids and drug-delivery products. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would make McGaw the largest of 13 distributors of Block's line 
of disposable intravenous home systems, said Gregory Sancoff, Block's 
president. In return, Block would have access to McGaw's 220 sales 
representatives nationwide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For McGaw, the agreement is an effort to expand its distribution business and 
take advantage of opportunities that come its way, Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
"While we play an integral role in assisting the home-care industry as a 
supplier, we have no intentions of becoming a home-care provider, so our 
customers will always have access to the most advanced products available," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The home-health-care industry is expected to grow 25% to 30% annually, Sweeney 
said, while hospital care is expected to grow 6%. Home care is becoming an 
increasingly popular alternative to hospital treatment because it is generally 
less traumatic and less costly for patients than hospital care. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, McGaw will distribute Block's Homepump, which consists of 
a tennis ball-sized bag that automatically pumps intravenous fluid to a 
patient. The bag provides much greater mobility for patients, eliminating the 
need for them to remain in one place while receiving intravenous medication. 
</P>
<P>
A McGaw spokeswoman said the company hopes to target an estimated 225,000 
patients who need home intravenous therapy each year, many of them cancer and 
AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
McGaw and Block are also exploring other distributorship agreements with 
companies in Japan, Canada and Eastern Europe.

MARKET FOR WASHINGTON APPLES REVIVING;

AGRICULTURE: GROWERS ANTICIPATE A ROSY YEAR AS SALES INCREASE WHILE THE FRUIT 
SELLS AT HIGHER PRICES THAN PREVIOUSLY.

<P>
After three years of singing the blues, Washington apple growers are taking 
their red and yellow fruit and moving into the black. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 Washington crop -- 70% of the nation's supermarket apples -- is 
heading to market with high prices and less competition from other states. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers can also expect to find smaller-sized apples because of cool growing 
conditions in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Growers were battered the last three seasons by weather damage, the Alar scare 
and wholesale prices below the cost of production. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at a point this season where we can return profitability to orchards for 
the first time in probably three years," said Keith Mathews of the Yakima 
Valley Growers-Shippers, an industry group. 
</P>
<P>
Wholesale prices for Red Delicious apples, the nation's most popular variety, 
are nearly double what they were at this time last year, according to the 
federal-state Market News Service in Yakima. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Delicious and Granny Smith apples are also selling much higher than last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The top grade of Red Delicious is wholesaling for $17 to $18 per 42-pound box, 
compared with $8 to $10 a year ago. Goldens and Granny Smiths bring about the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
Early season sales of the new crop hit record levels, with 5.2 million boxes 
shipped by Sept. 27, compared with 4.3 million by the same date last year. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's share of the fresh-apple market is growing, from 50% to 60% a few 
years ago to about 70% now. 
</P>
<P>
That's because ideal conditions in Eastern Washington for growing red apples 
have gradually pushed growers in other states out of the fresh-apple market, 
Mathews said. Those growers are switching to new varieties or having their 
apples processed into juice or other products. 
</P>
<P>
Also, orchards in states such as California are being ripped out for real 
estate development, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Loss of the chemical Alar after last year's scare has not reduced the quality 
of the crop, Mathews said. 
</P>
<P>
Alar was a growth regulator that kept red apples on the tree longer.

For years, Marie Walsh, a Laguna Hills mother of eight, watched her health 
deteriorate. She was plagued with fatigue, abdominal pains, irregular menstrual 
periods and night sweats. 
</P>
<P>
Then one morning in February of 1984, she awoke and found the front of her 
nightgown damp with a bloody gel. A surgeon found that an implant in her left 
breast had ruptured, spilling silicone gel over the breast cavity. He cleaned 
out as much of the gel as he could and put in a new implant. 
</P>
<P>
But Walsh's problems worsened. 
</P>
<P>
She needed multiple surgeries to replace later implants that hardened 
uncomfortably and to remove silicone-filled tumors. She starting developing a 
variety of debilitating diseases: rheumatoid arthritis that made it painful for 
her to walk; scleroderma that tightened her skin and made her hollow-eyed, and 
chronic lymph, kidney and liver problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disintegrating," she said. "It's just a question of time (as to) what is 
going to go next." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh and her doctor are convinced that silicone gel from the implants has 
migrated through her body and caused chaos in her immune system. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Walsh won an $80,000 settlement against the manufacturer of 
the ruptured breast implant and that publicity has spun her into the center of 
an emerging nationwide network of women who allege that implants pose health 
hazards that are being kept a secret from consumers. 
</P>
<P>
She and other activists are crashing seminars on breast augmentation, courting 
newspaper and television reporters and filing lawsuits to draw attention to 
their plight. 
</P>
<P>
Their fears are considered irrational by manufacturers of breast implants and 
most plastic surgeons, who contend that the devices' benefits -- primarily that 
of boosting a woman's self-esteem -- outweigh the risks. They say there is no 
scientific evidence to prove any link between breast implants and cancer or 
diseases that attack the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Garry Brody, a clinical professor of plastic surgery at the University of 
Southern California and chairman of the society's plastic surgery device 
council, complained that the women in the Command Trust Network are 
discouraging women who would benefit from breast implants by "spreading panic." 
</P>
<P>
Brody said a USC study is following more than 3,000 women in Los Angeles County 
who have had silicone breast implants and discovered so far that they have no 
higher incidence of cancer than the general public. 
</P>
<P>
But breast implants are becoming increasingly controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Safety concerns have prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and its 
Canadian counterpart to call for further investigations and to collect test 
data from manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of breast implants have in their corner a Ralph Nader-founded advocate 
organization, Public Citizen Health Research Group, which has demanded that 
implants be taken off the market and has sued the FDA for access to 
manufacturers' records. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are high. An estimated 2 million U.S. women have had breast 
implants, which are being performed at a rate of about 130,000 a year. About 
85% of breast implants are cosmetic. The rest are performed to reconstruct 
breasts after cancer surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dr. William Shaw, chief of the division of plastic surgery at UCLA Medical 
Center: "It could be a bigger problem waiting to be confirmed or a smaller 
problem with a great deal of hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the controversy are devices that look like sacks made of a 
rubbery silicone skin and filled with silicone gel. 
</P>
<P>
They were designed by two plastic surgeons from Houston looking for an 
alternative to plastic sponge implants, used since the 1930s, which were 
unacceptable because they made the breast very hard and frequently caused 
allergic reactions. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors also were injecting silicone liquid directly into women's breasts, in 
some cases causing severe health problems, but the FDA stopped that practice in 
the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The first silicone-gel devices were implanted in 1963, and they have become 
especially popular in recent years as fashion and films have stressed the 
larger-breasted look. Advertisements in women's magazines and newspapers have 
enticed women with the purported ease of the procedure, which costs $2,000 to 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Silicone gel is used in the implant to give a natural feeling to the breast; 
the sack is designed to prevent the gel from getting into body tissue. 
</P>
<P>
However, it quickly became obvious that the device had problems. Patients 
complained about excessive scar tissue building up around the implant, making 
the breast unnaturally hard and causing pain. This condition occurs in 30% to 
50% of breast-implant patients, many of whom have repeated surgeries to try to 
correct it. 
</P>
<P>
Also, it is generally conceded that implants can hamper efforts to detect 
breast cancer through mammography. 
</P>
<P>
Of far greater dispute is whether silicone gel, some of which leaks out of all 
implants, can damage a woman's health. While the medical community once 
considered silicone "inert" within the body, more recent research indicates 
that that may not be the case. 
</P>
<P>
There is additional concern about a type of silicone implant surrounded by a 
covering of polyurethane foam that is intended to reduce the scarring. 
</P>
<P>
The foam degrades in the body and some studies have shown that under certain 
laboratory conditions, the disintegrating foam emits diamino toluene diamene, a 
known carcinogen in animals. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA is beginning to look closer at these issues and demand more information 
from manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The agency in 1988 determined that breast implants pose "a potential 
unreasonable risk of injury," but it is still drafting the testing requirements 
that manufacturers will have to meet. For now, implants can be sold without 
passing any safety tests specified by the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA acknowledges that even if preliminary tests show breast implants to be 
safe, it may be 10 or 15 years before there is enough data to know for certain 
if implants increase the risk of cancer or immune-system diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her lingering illnesses, Marie Walsh still carries implants in each of 
her breasts. 
</P>
<P>
"Every doctor has told me it won't make a difference" in her health at this 
point whether they are removed or not, she said. But recently, she decided to 
take them out after consulting with a new physician. 
</P>
<P>
"Her problem is induced by the silicone, and if she takes it out, there is at 
least a 50% chance that she will improve," said Dr. Gharoon Panahi, a 
Westminster rheumatologist. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd give anything to have my life back," she said. "I would rather be 
flat-chested and have my health and vitality." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, who has been forced by ill health to quit a career in securities sales 
and go on permanent state disability, is devoting much of her energy to 
organizing a support group in Orange County for women with similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
She is assisted by Marsha Chambers, a Tustin resident who got in touch with 
Walsh after reading a newspaper story about her legal settlement. Chambers 
suffers from hepatitus and other ailments she blames on the breast implants 
that she had removed in June. 
</P>
<P>
Together the women placed a tiny ad in a local Tustin newspaper that attracted 
40 more women who now meet regularly to discuss what to do about their health 
and how to warn others who may be thinking about enlarging their breasts. 
</P>
<P>
They have scoured medical libraries for information about the hazards of breast 
implants and they show up at public seminars on breast augmentation to 
distribute flyers. 
</P>
<P>
Their group, HAD (after "Human Adjuvant Disease" -- the medical term for the 
mosaic of symptoms they share), is linked with a nationwide activist 
organization called Command Trust Network. 
</P>
<P>
Command Trust Network was founded last year by Kathleen Anneken of Covington, 
Ky., and Sybil Goldrich of Beverly Hills, both of whom had a common history of 
breast-implant problems and a desire to reach out to others. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided an organization had to be established to provide the kind of 
information not routinely given in physicians' offices but information that we 
believed was essential for a woman to make a completely informed decision about 
what she was putting in her body," Goldrich said. 
</P>
<P>
She complains that so far, Maryland is the only state in the country that has 
enacted legislation requiring physicians to inform women of the risks of breast 
implants through a standardized brochure. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Arcarese, director of the FDA's office of training and assistance for 
medical devices, said two years ago an FDA advisory panel held hearings and 
determined that "patients are poorly informed." In response to the panel's 
request, he said the FDA has created committees representing consumers, 
physicians and the medical industry to write informational pamphlets that could 
be given to women considering breast enlargement or reconstruction after 
mastectomy. 
</P>
<P>
But as yet, he said, the members of the committees, which include 
representatives of Command Trust Network, have failed to reach a consensus on 
what should be said in the pamphlets, which are in their fifth draft. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a growing number of women with breast-implant problems are suing 
the manufacturers. A small number of trial attorneys are taking on the cases, 
while Public Citizen is acting as an informational clearinghouse for 
plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
Public Citizen estimates that there are at least 200 product-liability lawsuits 
pending against silicone breast-implant manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Denise Dunleavy, a Manhattan lawyer, said, "I have eight cases and I could 
probably take hundreds more if I wanted to. There are so many women out there 
looking for attorneys that it is frightening." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, a federal jury ordered Dow Corning Corp. of Midland, Mich., to pay 
$1.5 million in punitive damages and $211,000 in actual damages to Maria Stern, 
a Nevada woman whose breast implants made by that firm leaked silicone into her 
body after she had a mastectomy. Before the case was heard on appeal, Stern and 
Dow Corning reached an undisclosed settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Bolton, a Redwood City attorney who worked on the Stern case, said he has 
since taken the cases of 10 to 15 other women with breast-implant problems. He 
said in five of those cases, the plaintiffs have received out-of-court payments 
to drop the litigation. So far, none of the cases have gone to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Bolton said that routinely, as part of such settlement agreements, the 
manufacturers insist that the size of the settlement payment and the documents 
that the plaintiffs have gathered to build a case against the manufacturers be 
sealed from the public. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bolton: "The purpose of that is to make it very difficult and financially 
burdensome for any other plaintiff attorney to take on a similar case (because 
it) precludes plaintiff attorneys from sharing information." 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of breast implants contend that litigation is triggered by greedy 
lawyers and a small group of hysterical women who are ill and looking for 
someone to blame. 
</P>
<P>
The American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons recently reported 
the results of a survey of 592 women with breast implants showing that 92.5% 
were satisfied, while 82% said without a doubt that they would choose to have 
the surgery again. 
</P>
<P>
Also, while a study by Dow Corning showed that silicone produces cancerous 
growths in rats, Dow Corning and the FDA agree that this is not the kind of 
cancer to which humans would be susceptible. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Rylee, vice president of Dow Corning Corp., a major manufacturer of 
silicone gel-filled implants, said: "There is too much emotionalism that gets 
into this thing. What we really need is more understanding and true science. I 
think the medical community and manufacturers are doing everything they can to 
identify what can be done to increase our scientific knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
Rylee said that Dow Corning is trying to develop a national epidemiology study 
to determine if there is any link between silicone breast implants and 
immune-system disorders. A major difficulty, he said, is that the diseases in 
question -- lupus, scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis -- have always been 
most prevalent in women between 20 and 55, the same age group most likely to 
get breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
"None of our scientific consultants or internal scientists or physicians have 
yet been able to show there is a causal relationship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The most controversial implants are those covered with polyurethane foam that 
are marketed by Surgitek, a Paso Robles subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 
the New York-based pharmaceutical and consumer-products giant. 
</P>
<P>
Garry L. Carter, vice president-general manager of Surgitek's plastic surgery 
division, said the polyurethane-coated implant "is probably the fastest-growing 
product in the industry," currently representing about 20% of all implant sales 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dr. Richard Caleel, president of the American Academy of Cosmetic 
Surgery, said: "There are a lot of cosmetic surgeons who do not use 
polyurethane-covered implants because they are not sure about what happens to 
the polyurethane." 
</P>
<P>
A study by Chris Batish, a biomaterials scientist and professor at the 
University of Florida, showed that the kind of polyurethane used by Surgitek is 
not favored for medical applications because of its tendency to disintegrate in 
the body. Once that happens, Batish said in a recent interview, "no one is sure 
where it goes." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Batish said he found that in the laboratory, he could break the 
foam into chemical components that included the animal carcinogen TDA. 
</P>
<P>
Surgitek counters that the laboratory conditions used by Batish were much 
harsher than the environment inside the body. The company says studies that 
more closely approximate human biology show that the foam degrades very slowly 
and passes through the body without causing harm. 
</P>
<P>
Surgitek also says its research shows that the amount of TDA produced when the 
foam disintegrates is medically insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government has recently completed its own laboratory test of the 
foam and found no release of TDA, said Irwin Hinberg, acting chief of the 
research and standards division of Canada's Health Protection Branch. 
</P>
<P>
However, while neither the Canadian government nor the FDA believe that there 
is evidence to outlaw polyurethane-coated implants, both are advocating more 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is extrapolating (from laboratory tests). Nobody has tested what 
happens in the body," Hinberg said, adding that studies are under way to 
measure chemicals being produced in women who have had implants. 
</P>
<P>
But a few doctors and scientists believe there is already more than enough 
information about the dangers of breast implants to raise a red flag. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Douglas R. Shanklin, a pathologist at the University of Tennessee, calls 
the silicone implants "an immunological and biological disaster waiting to 
happen." He said that some women with implants "go 5, 10, 15 years with no 
problem and then all hell breaks loose." 
</P>
<P>
Shanklin, who said he has seen silicone in the tissue taken from the thyroid 
glands and spleens of women who have had breast implants, said: "I think they 
should be taken off the market pending resolution of these problems." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the various immune-system diseases that women are reporting can 
be serious. "These are fatal diseases in time," he said. "Lupus destroys the 
kidneys and scleroderma can effect the heart and lungs." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Rensch, an assistant professor in the department of engineering 
mechanics at the University of Nebraska, said that implants are covered with a 
"highly elastic silicon rubber that can quite easily tear." He said he has 
"examined over 500 deflated breast implants" and has been retained by plaintiff 
attorneys in 50 to 60 cases to render opinions regarding manufacturing and 
design defects. 
</P>
<P>
"From all the pain and suffering I have seen, I wouldn't recommend anyone to 
use these devices from anyone or any company," Rensch said. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Shaw said that in the last year, he has seen a dozen women with breast 
implants who also have arthritis and various other immune diseases. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it is difficult to tell who has severe symptoms from the implants 
and who would have had them anyway. The causes of the diseases are a mystery," 
he said. Nonetheless, "you have to admit it looks awfully suspicious. . . . 
This is a subject I think should be looked at. We shouldn't brush these people 
off."

JOSEPH N. BELL: UNIVERSAL STUDIOS FIRE, SALE A SAD END TO GRAND ERA OF DREAM 
FACTORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two recent, related events saddened me deeply and -- even to me -- 
inexplicably. I'm talking about the fire that destroyed much of the back lot at 
Universal Studios and the subsequent sale of that studio to a Japanese 
conglomerate. It was, to me, rather like seeing an aging member of your family 
badly injured and then unfeelingly bartered to a stranger who covets the gold 
fillings in her teeth. 
</P>
<P>
I make no apologies for these sappy feelings. The sadness grows out of one more 
stamp of finality -- maybe the last one -- on the dream factories (I use the 
cliche fondly) that probably had more influence, both good and bad, on my 
upbringing than any other single force. A soul that was forged in movie palaces 
can't be unmoved when the last rococo chandelier comes tumbling down. 
</P>
<P>
The back lot at Universal was the only survivor of the days when movies were 
made on papier-mache sets instead of on location -- and the audience was 
required to add some of its own imagination to the mix, which we did happily. 
</P>
<P>
When I moved to California in 1959, all of the studios still had their back 
lots, and thank God I saw them before they began to turn into real estate 
developments. I saw Tara and the Roman amphitheater and the Paris Opera and the 
streets of "High Noon" and Shirley Temple's plantation and Camelot and the 
courthouse square in Mason City, Iowa, and the "Psycho" house (which was 
destroyed in last week's fire). All of which took some doing. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think any generation of Americans ever dealt with the movies in quite 
the same way as those of us who grew up in the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
We wanted gauze, not reality. We had plenty of reality in the food lines and 
broken families and desperation involved in simple survival. Two men in my 
neighborhood in Ft. Wayne, Ind., took out large insurance policies, then killed 
themselves so their families could eat. My own father had a nervous breakdown 
after frantically trying to save his business and disappeared for several 
weeks; my brother found him in a hospital in Chicago. He had gone to the city 
to seek a loan -- unsuccessfully. 
</P>
<P>
The movies gave us our only release from these stresses, and the nickelodeon 
operators who became the moguls of Hollywood knew this. And so they gave us 
Fred Astaire done up impeccably in white tie and tails dancing on a piano. And 
kindly Judge Hardy dispensing warm advice from his white Victorian house on a 
tree-shaded street in Grassroots, U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
And Cary Grant being wonderfully flip, and Jean Harlow and Marlene Dietrich 
sultry, and William Powell suave, and Clark Gable and Errol Flynn dashing. They 
gave us idyllic families and brave, selfless heroes and heroines and stories in 
which Ruby Keeler was always plucked from the chorus at the last minute and 
turned into an overnight star. And we lapped them up. 
</P>
<P>
I have no idea to what extent they permeated my subconscious and established a 
plateau of unreality that made self-honesty much more difficult for me to come 
by in later years. If that, indeed, is true, it doesn't change my affection for 
these movies one whit. I can still move in my head instantly -- and with great 
joy -- to any one of hundreds of summer afternoons I spent in enormous movie 
palaces where, for a dime, I could be transported for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
This affection was so powerful that I spent an uncommon amount of my adult life 
opening doors to Hollywood. I think that determination was fixed a few weeks 
after I was discharged in San Francisco from the Navy following World War II. I 
had heard that Paramount Studios was offering tours to returning servicemen, 
and so my wife and I drove back to the Midwest via Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
We took a motel a few blocks from Paramount and appeared very early in the 
morning to get on the first tour. I knew that Hope and Crosby were in the midst 
of filming one of their "road" pictures, and that James Stewart and Jean Arthur 
were also filming there at the time, and I had visions as I waited of seeing 
these people. Then we were told that no spouses would be allowed on the tour, 
and -- although my wife insisted I go alone -- I left the studio awash in 
disappointment and anger and determined to come back on my own terms. 
</P>
<P>
That took about 15 years. When I was a well-established magazine writer in 
Chicago, we moved to Orange County, and I began seeking Hollywood assignments. 
Within a few years, I was doing the film reviewing and covering the Hollywood 
beat for the National Observer (the now-defunct weekly published by the Wall 
Street Journal) and was writing entertainment profiles for a lot of 
high-circulation national magazines. Since power in Hollywood is equated 
strictly on what you can deliver, I had virtually unlimited access to both the 
studios and the people who worked there. 
</P>
<P>
It was a heady experience for a while and could have destroyed those early 
feelings about the movies. The people, of course, were inevitably smaller than 
life -- or, at least, smaller than the fantasy life I'd given them. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Astaire, for example, turned out to be an almost total pragmatist, an 
affable, diffident man who seemed to have no conception of the pleasure he'd 
given millions of people like me. I found Judy Garland one day in an alcoholic 
stupor. Julie Andrews cussed with the creativity of a top sergeant. Mary Tyler 
Moore was tense and withdrawn. And I had to learn the hard way not to confuse 
an apparently warm interview with the beginning of a friendship. On two 
separate occasions, I spent a full day with Edward G. Robinson and Charlton 
Heston, then ran into them at previews that evening and they didn't know me. 
</P>
<P>
But all of this was somehow put into a compartment of my head totally apart 
from the one that encased the affectionate companionship of the movies I 
enjoyed when I was growing up. When I had my fill of writing about Hollywood 
and turned to other things, I didn't look over my shoulder very often. Sure, I 
missed the location trips -- many of them abroad -- and the screening parties 
and the ego-life of being on the "A" list. 
</P>
<P>
But the need I had -- if that's what it was -- to experience what I fantasized 
as Hollywood on my own terms was gone. That Hollywood no longer existed, anyway 
-- if it ever had. The studio system had disintegrated, and the industry was 
being taken over by financial conglomerates -- first domestic, then foreign -- 
that didn't know Judge Hardy from Rambo, and couldn't care less. And the movies 
they produced turned appallingly violent -- or appallingly cute -- and were 
aimed primarily at adolescent minds of whatever age. 
</P>
<P>
So an era was gone, and I didn't try to fight these changing rhythms. But that 
hasn't prevented an occasional opening of that compartment of my mind in which 
my own adolescent movies are stored -- and the chance to poke about in them 
fondly. That usually happens at this stage of my life only when something stirs 
these memories -- as the Universal fire did the other day. The cardboard sets 
burned fiercely, leaving only ashes. But the movies I carry in my head -- and 
the feelings I have for them -- are indestructible.

A BRAVE NEW ART WORLD?; 
</P>
<P>
GALLERIES MOUNT ART/LA90, HOPING STABILITY HAS RETURNED TO THE MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The New York art market hit the skids in November auctions, but you might not 
know it by looking at the lineup of participants in ART/LA90, the fifth 
international contemporary art fair at the Los Angeles Convention Center. About 
165 galleries from 20 countries will offer thousands of artworks for sale at 
the annual event, which begins Wednesday night with a benefit preview and is 
open to the public on Thursday through Monday. 
</P>
<P>
There has been some fallout this year, however. The Leo Castelli Gallery of New 
York, the biggest name at last year's fair, will not be here. Castelli had 
planned to participate but he changed his mind after suffering damage in 
October when two vandals slashed paintings in his exhibition at FIAC, an art 
fair in Paris. Other galleries have bowed out because of the ailing economy. 
BlumHelman of New York and Santa Monica, Raab of Berlin and London, Ghislaine 
Hussenot of Paris and Marc Richards of Santa Monica are among familiar faces 
that will not be at ART/LA90. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like the year to take a pass on the fair, considering the economy," 
said Los Angeles dealer Neil Ovsey, who has been a regular since the fair's 
inception but opted out this year. 
</P>
<P>
But many dealers have returned and at least 30 others have plunged in for the 
first time, including the Fred Hoffman Gallery and the Richard Kuhlenschmidt 
Gallery of Santa Monica and the Union of Soviet Artists from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the economy is wonderful. Lots of people are buying art," said Dorothy 
Goldeen of Santa Monica. She will be back "with my usual enthusiasm" for the 
fifth year. 
</P>
<P>
Outlooks for the fair vary sharply from dealer to dealer, but one thing is 
certain: A staggering array of art will be for sale at the Convention Center. 
There will be sculpture from Zimbabwe, paintings from Yugoslavia, sculpture 
from France, prints from Canada, conceptual art from the United States. A 
special feature, "The Belgian Show," will showcase four young Belgian galleries 
including the Galerie des Beaux-Arts of Brussels which represents such major 
European artists as Christian Boltanski and Wolfgang Laib. 
</P>
<P>
Among hopeful vendors, the Linda Cathcart Gallery of Santa Monica will offer an 
uncompromising roster of major pieces by such heavyweights as Robert Longo, 
Cindy Sherman, Louise Bourgeois, Sigmar Polke and Pat Steir. 
</P>
<P>
Fay Gold of Atlanta will show a bold assortment of primitive paintings by 
"outsider" artists whose unschooled visions of human form often substitute 
psychic shock for physical reality. 
</P>
<P>
Having made a hit last year with Attila Richard Lukacs' shockingly realistic, 
life-size paintings of skinheads and other intimidating tough guys, Diane 
Farris of Vancouver will return with more works by Lukacs and other Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors in the market for tried-and-true modernism can see works by Fernand 
Leger at a booth run by the Evelyn Aimis Gallery of Toronto. Bright striped 
paintings by Gene Davis will be available from Charles Cowles' New York 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Print collectors can check out Robert Indiana's "The Hartley Elegies," a 
limited edition of five large (77x53-inch) silk screens that pay tribute to 
Marsden Hartley's "German Officer" paintings, at a booth run by Park Granada 
Editions of Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
Choices for photography buffs include Horace Bristol's 1944 shot of torpedo 
planes, at G. Ray Hawkins' booth, and Bruce of Los Angeles' beefcake pictures 
from the '50s in Jan Kesner's exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
And for ceramics collectors, the Garth Clark Gallery -- on hand for the first 
time -- will offer works by an impressive slate of artists who live in Southern 
California or got their start here. 
</P>
<P>
Will the fair be economically worthwhile for dealers who have paid between 
$12,500 and $37,500 -- plus stiff transportation and staffing costs -- to show 
their wares to a crowd that numbered 30,000 last year? 
</P>
<P>
Only time, turnstiles and receipt books will tell, but fair organizers are 
banking on a perception that "sanity has returned to the market" -- as a fair 
press release announces -- and hoping that collectors are in the mood to 
patronize dealers whose prices never approached the heights of spectacular 
auctions.

Attempting to turn recessionary gloom into a beacon of light for art fairs, 
ART/LA90 director Brian Angel said: "The movement is away from auction houses. 
Large-scale art fairs, such as the one in Los Angeles, are proliferating 
because their welcoming environment is light-years away from the elitism and 
price-hyping at auctions." 
</P>
<P>
The speculative factor that sent art prices into the stratosphere in the '80s 
certainly seems to have vanished, but the general health of the art market is 
subject to debate. Whispered reports of bargains in dealers' back rooms and 
rumors of gallery closures are countered by denials of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
No one disputes the fact that international art fairs have proliferated, 
however. At least 25 fairs boasting top galleries have taken place this year -- 
so many that no dealer can make the rounds while minding the store at home. In 
fact few galleries are represented in more than two or three fairs a year, and 
the competition is fierce. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' fair suffers the disadvantage of distance for East Coast and 
European dealers, and the five-year-old fair hasn't yet measured up to longer 
established enterprises in Basel, Paris and Chicago, aficionados say. Every 
year fair organizers seem to fight an uphill battle as they try to entice top 
out-of-town galleries to participate. 
</P>
<P>
Working to make the Los Angeles fair a distinctive, high-quality event, fair 
organizer Charlie Scheips says he tries to persuade dealers to present 
exhibitions that give an accurate picture of their galleries rather than to 
bring re-sale items in hopes of turning a quick profit. 
</P>
<P>
Another tactic to boost interest in the fair is to center it in a whirlwind of 
activities and to tie it to a socially conscious theme. ART/LA90 will focus on 
environmental protection. A $150-a-ticket dinner tonight at Morton's restaurant 
and a $75-a-ticket fair preview Wednesday night will both benefit the Natural 
Resources Defense Council, whose program combines legal action, scientific 
research and citizen education. Heal the Bay, an organization formed to clean 
up Santa Monica Bay, will benefit from a $30-a-ticket pre-fair brunch and art 
exhibition, sponsored by Kurland/Summers Gallery at the Seventh Street Bistro 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The fair poster -- from a painting by Vernon Fisher depicting a father and son 
cutting into a globe as if it were a pumpkin -- ties into the environmental 
motif, as does a series of programs at the convention center. 
</P>
<P>
Art fairs are complex productions that serve a variety of functions. For local 
dealers, a fair is a chance to promote their galleries to a vast audience. 
Recession or not, "this is our hometown fair. It's a major event," said Mark 
Moore, owner of the Works Gallery.

PACIFICA: THE LISTENER IN THE HEARINGS ROOM; 
</P>
<P>
RADIO: THE NONPROFIT BROADCASTER IS THE ONLY OUTLET TO CARRY THE 'KEATING FIVE' 
PROCEEDINGS FROM BEGINNING TO END. 
</P>

Pacifica Radio's Dennis Bernstein says that when he got into the thick of 
investigating the savings and loan scandal, he was followed through the streets 
of Houston by an unmarked car and received death threats after broadcasting 
reports in San Francisco and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Now the reporter and commentator is on the air daily with the story, as 
Pacifica, a Berkeley-based nonprofit community broadcasting organization that 
owns and operates KPFK 90.7 FM in the Los Angeles area, is broadcasting live, 
gavel-to-gavel coverage of the "Keating Five" Senate Ethics Committee hearings. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Bernstein's critical commentaries reach not only Pacifica's typical 
eclectic audience, but people throughout the political spectrum -- who are 
listening to the hearings on Pacifica because there's nowhere else to hear 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The senators under investigation -- Alan Cranston of California, John Glenn of 
Ohio, Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, and Dennis DeConcini and John McCain of 
Arizona -- are accused of improperly intervening with federal regulators in 
favor of Charles Keating, the owner of failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan and 
other thrifts who contributed heavily to their campaigns. Keating has been 
indicted for fraud in connection with the failure of his thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacifica coverage, which also includes interviews with committee witnesses, 
has attracted participants from staunch Republicans to avowed leftists to its 
call-in segments. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Pacifica) serves a very useful purpose," said William Drummond, 
professor and associate dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at UC 
Berkeley, who specializes in radio. "In the Berkeley area where we have KPFA, I 
run into people all the time who are talking about what they heard on those 
Keating hearings." 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica, which calls itself "free-speech radio" and broadcasts to a network of 
five owned and about 30 participating stations, broadcast the Watergate and CIA 
oversight hearings in the 1970s, and in recent years the Iran-Contra hearings 
and confirmation proceedings for Supreme Court nominees William H. Bork, 
Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 15 stations across the country are pre-empting regular 
programming to carry the hearings, including North Hollywood-based KPFK, WBAI 
in New York, KPFA in Berkeley and KPFT in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people living in a democracy need to know how their government works," 
said Lucia Chappelle, program director for KPFK. "Hopefully, more people will 
go to the ballot box if they can really understand how this think works day to 
day. I really think (running the hearings) sparks more active participation." 
</P>
<P>
Besides C-Span, the not-for-profit cable television service that covers 
Congress, Pacifica is the only outlet to broadcast the hearings from beginning 
to end. 
</P>
<P>
"The only network there on a regular basis is CBS," said anchor Larry Bensky. 
"The rest come depending on who the witness is." 
</P>
<P>
According to Bensky, the coverage has broadened Pacifica's typically narrow 
listener base and might account for increased financial contributions to its 
admittedly shoestring operations. 
</P>
<P>
During the Iran-Contra hearings, for example, listener contributions went up 
$500,000, nearly 25% of its $4.2 million budget. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't always (participate in ratings services like) Arbitron, but because 
we're listener-sponsored, it's easy to tell when the audience increases, 
because revenues go up directly," said David Salnicker, Pacifica executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
The current budget is so low that Bensky, a winner of the George Polk Award who 
lives in Berkeley, must stay with friends and pay all of his own expenses while 
on assignment in Washington. The broadcast booth is a makeshift operation. In 
order for callers to hear the answers given by guests and host to their 
questions, Bensky and others in the booth must hold a microphone up to the 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
During a program last week which involved listener call-ins and several 
prominent guests, the telephone was passed around the room from person to 
person for guest responses. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1949 by Louis Hill, a disenchanted network journalist and poet, 
Pacifica was set up as a pacifist -- hence the name, Pacifica -- alternative to 
commercial radio. "There are a lot of Pacifica veterans who are now part of the 
broadcast establishment," said UC Berkeley's Drummond. 
</P>
<P>
"(Pacifica) is thought of as being free-form and they never have the money to 
do anything, but the content is more in line with what public broadcasting was 
intended to do," Drummond said. "They are much more 'alternative' than National 
Public Radio."

Newman's Own Camp: Paul Newman will provide the initial funding for a British 
summer camp for children with cancer, a charity official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The project would cost up to $15.5 million and Newman will provide a large 
undisclosed cash sum through his gourmet food company, Newman's Own Foods, 
which gives all profits to charity. In the United States, Newman has 
established a similar camp at Ashford, Conn. The camp is called the 
Hole-in-the-Wall Gang, named after a gang of outlaws from "Butch Cassidy and 
the Sundance Kid" in which Newman starred with Robert Redford. CLAUDIA PUIG

ABT Dancers' New Contract: American Ballet Theatre dancers are expected in the 
rehearsal studio today following an agreement reached midnight Friday after an 
intense 10-hour negotiating session. Dancers won a $2 increase per day, but 
will double up in hotel rooms for two foreign tours. For domestic tours -- such 
as the Orange County Performing Arts Center in March -- dancers will get 
individual rooms. CLAUDIA PUIG

DRUMMER WALLY STRYK'S TRIO GAVE A SMOOTH PERFORMANCE TO A CHATTY CROWD AT

<P>
Some people just don't know what they're missing. That was certainly true 
Sunday evening at the Studio Cafe as drummer Wally Stryk's trio, Flight, played 
to a small, chatty, largely inattentive crowd. 
</P>
<P>
What those in attendance chose to ignore was a smooth performance of 
well-chosen standards, done with taste and a bit of flash. Stryk, a Boston 
native who has been in the Southland for two years, performs with Segment, a 
percussive-heavy ensemble that includes marimbas, African percussion and 
Stryk's trap work, in addition to various editions of his own trio. The bassist 
for this engagement, Ken Filiano, has recorded with multireed man Vinny Golia's 
Large Ensemble, trombonist Joey Sellers' Jazz Aggregation and adventurous 
keyboardist Richard Grossman in addition to putting out a pair of his own 
albums. 
</P>
<P>
The ringer among the three was keyboardist Don Preston, who is probably best 
known for his association with the Mothers of Invention. But Preston, a 
Michigan native who honed his chops in Detroit after-hours clubs with the likes 
of Elvin Jones and Yusef Lateef, has solid jazz credentials. He has worked with 
Don Cherry, Michael Mantler, Gil Evans, Carla and Paul Bley, among others, and 
has also contributed to several film scores, including that of "Apocalypse 
Now." Lately, he's been heard in Los Angeles as a member of cornetist Bobby 
Bradford's Mo'tet and, just last week, he presented a program of enticing 
originals at the Catalina Bar &amp; Grill with a trio that counted bassist and 
Orange County resident Art Davis among its members. 
</P>
<P>
Though Stryk had worked with both men at different times, this was the first 
time the three had worked as a unit. Except for brief discussions between 
numbers, that fact was hardly apparent as the trio found common ground during a 
first set that relied mainly on familiar Miles Davis tunes. 
</P>
<P>
They warmed up to the trumpeter's "All Blues," with Filiano, the possessor of a 
full, meaty tone, stating the familiar bass line while Preston added dissonant 
twists to the simple theme. Stryk punched up the pace, working a double-time 
into the bridge that sent Preston scurrying into his solo. Preston swirled 
warmly through Davis' "Solar" while Stryk managed to keep things heated despite 
being crammed into a tight corner of the tiny bandstand. 
</P>
<P>
Preston's best moments came during a duo with Filiano on Miles' near-mystic 
tune "Nardis." Though his own material has him working the keyboard with a 
Cecil Taylor-like intensity, his approach here was more fluid with a lyrical 
right hand sparked by a pushy left. In support, Filiano wasn't content to walk 
or merely track chords, but played off the pianist's story line, emphasizing a 
phrase here, adding embellishment there. His own solo was a warm, melodic 
reworking of the theme that wandered across the full range of his instrument. 
Preston drew the piece to a close with a Middle Eastern-flavored line that 
ended darkly below middle C. 
</P>
<P>
"Django," the paean to the well-known guitarist written by Modern Jazz Quartet 
pianist John Lewis, injected some seriousness into the proceedings, with 
Preston's respectful, classically influenced block-chord introduction moving 
into smoothly drawn lines that Stryk shaded with brushes and mallets. The 
up-tempo blues that followed allowed the drummer to show some swing. 
</P>
<P>
And the crowd's response to this satisfying effort? At the conclusion of each 
tune, as if in answer to a Zen riddle, could be heard the sound of one man 
clapping.

'QUILTERS' IS TOUCHING, FUNNY, BRILLIANT;

THE EXQUISITE, ALL-FEMALE FRONTIER MUSICAL AT MOULTON THEATRE IS THE SHOW TO 
SEE. TERI RALSTON DIRECTS THE PRODUCTION.

"It will come as a great surprise to many that 'Quilters' failed on Broadway," 
Laguna Playhouse executive director Richard Stein writes in his program note 
for the exquisite, all-female frontier musical that opened over the weekend at 
the Moulton Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
I'll take Stein's word for it, but I really am not surprised. If anything, it's 
more surprising that "Quilters" got to Broadway in the first place. "Annie Get 
Your Gun," an Ethel Merman star vehicle meant for out-of-towners, is the sort 
of frontier musical that Broadway historically has favored. "Quilters" is not a 
show for out-of-towners. It has the appeal of the authentic. 
</P>
<P>
In the wrong hands, of course, "Quilters" could easily become quaint and 
languorous. Its episodic vignettes about pioneer times on the prairie, pieced 
together like the show's handmade quilts, have a tendency toward the elegiac. 
But this touching, funny, musically winning production has been directed by 
Teri Ralston and performed by its cast of seven women with a verve and lack of 
nostalgia that give it the unsentimental pulse of life. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever else theatergoers plan to see between now and Dec. 16, when "Quilters" 
is scheduled to close, this is one show they should try not to miss. In fact, 
this latest version of the Molly Newman-Barbara Damashek musical is such an 
unassuming marvel of theatrical brilliance, it is hard to know what or whom to 
praise first. 
</P>
<P>
Shall we begin with the accomplished vocal talent of the wonderfully well-cast 
players -- Laura Pryzgoda, Lisa Picotte, Tricia Griffin, Karen McBride, Carolyn 
Miller, Colleen Dunn and Karen Angela -- or the considerable dramatic gifts 
that enable them to create individual portraits of pioneer women so 
gratifyingly different from each other? 
</P>
<P>
Or shall we begin with the feeling that the piece has captured an immense cycle 
of experience common to most, if not all, women -- pioneering or otherwise? 
"Quilters" deals with everything from menstruation and courtship to childbirth 
and mothering, aborting an unwanted fetus to surviving a beloved husband's 
death, being young and playful to growing old. 
</P>
<P>
The varied pacing of Ralston's direction-cum-choreography is not to be 
overlooked, nor Jacquie Moffett's and Doug Williamson's functional but 
evocative design: a towering windmill, a raised platform and a few 
strategically placed wooden beams -- all set against a quilt-like backdrop and 
bathed in Steven Wolff Craig's flesh-toned lighting. Note, too, the 
understatement of Marthella Randall's plain country costumes and the effective 
use of simple props. 
</P>
<P>
If the ensemble work looks as cohesive as the beautiful quilts that have gotten 
the characters through the good and bad times in their hard lives on the 
prairie, it is not for lack of practice: This cast has performed "Quilters" 
four times before under Ralston's direction. And plans are under way to do so 
again later this season in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Ralston, who appeared with the original cast of "Quilters" at the Denver Center 
Theatre in 1983 and in a production at Los Angeles' Mark Taper Forum in 1985, 
first directed the show with this cast at the Moulton in January, 1987. That 
was followed by an hourlong version in June, 1987, mounted at a national 
competition of the American Assn. of Community Theatres in Norman, Okla., where 
Ralston and company took top honors. 
</P>
<P>
They remounted the full-length show at the Moulton in May, 1988, to raise money 
to travel to Dundalk, Ireland, where "Quilters" competed in the 23rd annual 
International Community Theatre Festival. (The adjudicators awarded "Quilters" 
second prize, while the audience disagreed and voted it the top show.) 
</P>
<P>
Pryzgoda, who clearly has the outstanding voice of the ensemble, offers two of 
the production's musical highlights: a haunting rendition of "The Butterfly," 
which embellishes a particularly affecting tale about an orphan and the death 
of her young mother, and "Quiltin' and Dreamin' " which is part of a droll 
sketch about a plain Jane who catches the eye of the handsomest cowboy in the 
county (played with amusing panache by Dunn). 
</P>
<P>
The brightest of nearly two dozen numbers include the entire ensemble doing 
"Pieces of Lives," "The Windmill Song" (featuring Picotte and Angela), "Every 
Log in My House" and "Cornelia." 
</P>
<P>
Griffin also has a notable solo in "Green, Green, Green," as well as an 
affecting dramatic scene about a husband's death on the railroad. 
</P>
<P>
Miller gives a fine, melancholy reading of an old-maid schoolteacher who can't 
have children, while Picotte provides an essential buoyancy throughout in a 
polished and energetic performance both as a singer and actor. Angela, though 
at times a bit shrill, brings off some of the sharpest moments of comedy as a 
clever scamp. And McBride has an anchoring presence as a pioneer matriarch. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the band lends vivid support not only as musical accompanists but 
also as sound-effects technicians creating the mood of the prairie. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Turnbull plays a variety of instruments from wind to percussion, along 
with Rocio Marron on fiddle, Cynthia Merrill on bass and Bob Hawkins on guitar 
and mandolin.

'BEST HOTEL' A CINEMA VERITE LOOK AT SKID ROW 
</P>

<P>
"The Best Hotel on Skid Row," an "America Undercover" segment airing on HBO at 
9:30 tonight, is a simple, straightforward look at the life led by a few of the 
residents of downtown L.A.'s Madison Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, simple and straightforward is by no means bland -- "Hotel" is an 
engrossing, cinema verite study of an ignored other world, a shadow culture 
within our city limits. 
</P>
<P>
The Madison, an ugly, blocky building on the outside, features small, fairly 
clean rooms for $8.20 a night. The hotel is an oasis for some, a last stop 
before the almost inevitable fall to the streets for others. As poet Charles 
Bukowski -- whose gravelly voice and streetwise air makes him a perfect 
narrator for this slice of grit -- says at one point: "You can have a room for 
a day . . . or a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
Bukowski's narration sets the tone -- and sets up the interviews with the 
tenants, all identified with their name and room number. There's hooker and 
heroin addict Becky, Gary the lonely day laborer, the lovesick John and the 
less-than-thrilled object of his affection, Debbie. We see Becky working the 
street and Gary on a pick-up job as a truck swamper, but mostly we see the 
residents, drifters all, sitting in their rooms, with their 
25-cents-per-15-minutes TVs droning on in the background. 
</P>
<P>
There is little relief beyond the comfort they sometimes give each other; all 
yearn for companionship to ease their pain. 
</P>
<P>
One caveat: "Hotel" is skillfully done but one man's cinema verite can be 
another's shallow voyeurism. "Hotel" feeds off of its subjects at the same time 
it celebrates them. 
</P>

'On Fire': Solid Primer on Surviving One 
</P>
<P>
"On Fire: A Family Guide to Fire Safety," airing at 10:30 tonight on KCET 
Channel 28, finds Henry Johnson, a fire and safety specialist in the Los 
Angeles Fire Department, doing for fires what he did for earthquakes in last 
year's "Surviving the Big One": delivering an entertaining, comprehensive 
primer on how to cope with a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's low-key style is perfect for this type of documentary, which could 
easily become a dry lecture. Although he's more restrained than he was in "Big 
One," writer-narrator-host Johnson delivers a great deal of valuable 
information. (Valuable information in a poor time slot: Why did KCET schedule 
this so late at night?) 
</P>
<P>
And, as he did in "Big One," Johnson repeatedly stresses that the key to 
survival lies in proper preparation. "On Fire" examines coping at three 
different locations: home, work, travel. The show uses fire re-creations to 
make dramatic points. Less-dramatic, but equally necessary, are the home, 
office and hotel walk-throughs -- just when you think you've heard all this 
before, Johnson will mention some fact or tip that rings true for your 
individual situation. 
</P>
<P>
Although choppy at times, "On Fire" is a solid guide to preventing, controlling 
and surviving a fire. It's not a pretty topic but it is a must-see -- and might 
just help you and your family survive a nightmare. MARTIN ZIMMERMAN

RICK DU BROW: JOHN RITTER: A QUIET FORCE IN DEMAND; 
</P>

TELEVISION: BUSY ACTOR STARS AS L. FRANK BAUM IN 'THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ' 
AND IS A WOMANIZING PHOTOJOURNALIST IN FIRST THREE EPISODES OF 'ANYTHING BUT 
LOVE.'

<P>
THE GAMBLER: "He considered himself a failure at 40," said John Ritter. 
</P>
<P>
"He had all these odd jobs and couldn't hold them. And then he gambled 
everything on this one children's book." 
</P>
<P>
The book was "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz." The author was L. Frank Baum. And 
Ritter is starring in his life story Monday in an NBC film co-produced by his 
company. 
</P>
<P>
A quiet force on the Hollywood scene, Ritter will also star in the first three 
episodes of the splendid sitcom "Anything but Love" when ABC brings it back 
early next year. His company co-produces that show, too. 
</P>
<P>
The Baum story, "The Dreamer of Oz," is told in flashback through his widow 
(Annette O'Toole), who encounters a reporter at the 1939 Hollywood premiere of 
the film "The Wizard of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
And though the NBC tale is a drama, there are fantasy sequences that include 
such characters as the Cowardly Lion, the Scarecrow and the Tin Man. 
</P>
<P>
"There's computer animation," Ritter says. "What was thrilling was that we had 
Robert Baum, Frank's grandson, as the technical adviser. And he had so many 
first editions. We tried to be as authentic as we could." 
</P>
<P>
In "Anything but Love," meanwhile, Ritter is a womanizing photojournalist who 
comes between magazine writers Jamie Lee Curtis and Richard Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as they're about to consummate their love relationship," Ritter says, "I 
show up. I make a play for her. I would like to teach her the facts of life as 
I know them." 
</P>
<P>
An ABC spokesman says "Anything but Love" could return quite soon: "It's easy 
to plug in because it's a known quantity." 
</P>
<P>
THINK TANK: The Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences is finally reacting 
to the poor showings of the Emmy Awards on the Fox network. 
</P>
<P>
A blunt announcement from the academy says a committee "was called together 
after low ratings and mixed reviews of the Sept. 16 Emmy telecast on Fox to 
re-think, re-design and review many aspects of the awards and the telecast." 
</P>
<P>
Among the reported ideas is switching the Emmy show away from the tough, 
new-season program competition and airing it in late August. 
</P>
<P>
But that was done in 1988, to avoid competition with the Summer Olympic Games, 
and the Emmys simply got lost in the dog days -- and vacation month -- of 
August. 
</P>
<P>
The hard fact is that the TV academy went into the ratings dumper with the 
Emmys when it accepted Fox's shrewdly concocted high bid for the show, knowing 
full well the young network could not provide as big an audience as ABC, CBS or 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
And with Fox struggling with its new shows this season, there is not much 
likelihood of major audience expansion in the immediate future for that 
network. 
</P>
<P>
While ABC, CBS and NBC are also struggling to retain viewers, their audience 
base is much larger. And the only way the Emmys have a chance to improve their 
ratings substantially is by being back on one of the Big Three. 
</P>
<P>
At this stage, also, Fox no longer needs the Emmys to help establish its 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
The Fox-Emmys deal has gone sour, and what the awards need -- besides a change 
of channels -- is some real showmanship and a glamorous plan to bring back the 
glitter. 
</P>
<P>
Being in the thick of new-season competition is a plus, not a minus, for the 
Emmys. It adds to the excitement. It's the network impact and production that 
count. 
</P>
<P>
NOTEBOOK: Don't forget, that controversial program "Abortion Denied: Shattering 
Young Women's Lives" airs Friday at 7:05 p.m. on superstation TBS. 
</P>
<P>
TOP OF THE LINE: PBS' "Masterpiece Theatre" marks its 20th anniversary in 
January. Has there ever been a greater TV series than this showcase that has 
given us "Upstairs, Downstairs," "I, Claudius" and "The Jewel in the Crown"? 
No, there hasn't. How about a round of applause? And a nod toward host Alistair 
Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
GOING HOME: Those potent ratings show just how smart Christine Lund was in 
returning to her old station, KABC Channel 7. At least three other stations 
were after Lund, who wanted to come out of retirement -- KNBC Channel 4, KCOP 
Channel 13 and KCAL Channel 9 -- but whether by chance or design, she wound up 
where she belonged, with a built-in audience of former viewers. 
</P>
<P>
NEAT GUY: Fox's Sunday lineup has lost its punch without "The Simpsons" -- but 
the network's Chris Elliott is good company in "Get a Life" as a young man who 
refuses to grow up. 
</P>
<P>
GENIUSES: Doesn't everybody who thought that "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" 
would be a smash hit -- NBC, Madison Avenue and yours truly -- look pretty 
foolish now? You bet. It'll never happen. Too bad, because the star, Will 
Smith, really has the goods. 
</P>
<P>
LOSS LEADER: When Thanksgiving dinners wiped out that "Cosby" rerun, it only 
showed the series' value to NBC. The network's ratings collapsed. That "loss" 
could be worth plenty to "The Cosby Show" at negotiating time. 
</P>
<P>
BEING THERE: "You know what makes this country great? You don't have to be 
witty or clever, as long as you can hire someone who is." -- TV anchorman Ted 
Baxter (Ted Knight) on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show."

IT'S PARTY TIME FOR THOSE UNSHAKEN BY QUAKE ALERT 
</P>

FROM THE FAULT LINE, NEW MADRID, Mo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pssst. Heard the latest disaster prediction? 
</P>
<P>
The word is the Mississippi River is going to overflow. That should happen say 
about Wednesday when all the folks along the river who've been stockpiling 
water for the Big Earthquake finally pour it down the drain. 
</P>
<P>
For months a major portion of the Midwest and South, from about Memphis, Tenn., 
to St. Louis and beyond, braced for the Big One. Schools in parts of four 
states declared holidays. Earthquake insurance sellers reaped a fortune. An 
untold number of people packed their valuables and lit out for safer territory. 
</P>
<P>
All because Iben Browning, an eccentric 72-year-old scientist from New Mexico, 
predicted a 50-50 chance that a temblor with a magnitude of 7.0 or higher would 
occur within 48 hours of Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
So far, it hasn't happened. 
</P>
<P>
So you'd think maybe a lot of folks with relieved or sheepish expressions on 
their faces would be crawling out of their basements about now, right? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe. But you'd have to wade through the revelers to find them. 
</P>
<P>
The only reeling and rocking anyone in these parts saw was at the earthquake 
parties thrown throughout the region by the skeptics who stayed behind. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to have a good time with it," said Jack Hailey, a big, bearded 
man in an omnipresent Stetson who threw an all-day party Monday at his tavern 
here in New Madrid, the southeastern Missouri town for which the fault is 
named. "This is the most attention this little town ever had, and probably on 
Wednesday nobody will know where it is." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday was, according to Browning's prediction, the first day of 
high-earthquake probability. At the Faultline, a nightclub in Memphis that has 
a crack painted on its dance floor and another crack that runs the length of a 
wall with fake body parts sticking out, dancers Saturday night enjoyed "the 
last shake before the quake." 
</P>
<P>
Revelers downed Earthquake Shooters -- "guaranteed to shake you up," claimed 
the management. The place was packed. 
</P>
<P>
Even tiny New Madrid (pronounced MAD-rid) took on a carnival atmosphere. 
Ordinarily the town is so dead that children skateboard down the middle of Main 
Street at rush hour without encountering cars. But this weekend policemen were 
out directing traffic as a country and western band played tunes atop the 
levee, and vendors sold T-shirts and barbecue downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Not that there aren't a lot of nervous people still around. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Wolford is one of many who maintains that only God can predict an 
earthquake. But she admits she got scared a few days ago when her cat -- 
animals are supposed to have an inside track on these things -- started acting 
funny. 
</P>
<P>
"She just ran her head into the wall by the hutch," Wolford said. "It was just 
a-running and a-scooting. Then it started jumping up like you see those 
acrobats do, its hair standing up on its back." 
</P>
<P>
The New Madrid Fault, which runs from Marked Tree, Ark., to Cairo, Ill., 
spawned the most powerful series of earthquakes in the nation's history in 1811 
and 1812. Scientists say the strongest of the quakes would've measured over 8 
on the Richter scale if the scale had been invented then. Its effects were felt 
as far north as Canada. Water flowing in the Mississippi River temporarily 
reversed directions. 
</P>
<P>
Although the scientific community was almost unanimous in its repudiation of 
Browning's prediction, geologists and emergency planning officials have taken 
advantage of it to impress upon the public that, whether or not it occurred on 
Dec. 3, the fault is overdue for another big rumble. People who never took the 
warnings seriously before are taking them seriously now. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in September, people were in here just hysterical," said Virginia 
Carlson, director of the New Madrid Historical Museum, which has reading 
material and an exhibit on earthquakes. After officials began holding seminars 
on earthquake preparedness, however, people calmed down and started making 
rational preparations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Elderly people and children seem to be the ones most shaken by the prediction. 
Many of those who left, a number of residents said, were elderly. 
</P>
<P>
"A few old people left," admitted Hailey, trying to play down the concern that 
has clearly dominated the region for months. "Some guys sent their wives and 
children away and they stayed. They said it was for their (family's) safety, 
but I think they wanted to be here to party by themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Robert R. Butterworth, a psychologist from Los Angeles, spent three days in 
town trying to gauge the psychological effects of the earthquake prediction. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rare that you get a situation where people are dealing with trauma before 
it happens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the people he talked to denied that they were concerned about the quake 
prediction and some joked about it, he said. "But when you talk to the kids it 
ceases being funny, because a lot of them are worried . . . . One child said 
she was going to sleep under her bed or under a table. A lot of people are 
sleeping with their clothes on." 
</P>
<P>
Butterworth was critical of Browning for making the prediction, which he called 
"frivolous." 
</P>
<P>
"If I yell 'fire' in a crowded theater and a stampede results, injuring people, 
I can be prosecuted if there wasn't a fire. Why should someone be able to yell 
'earthquake' in a crowded region and be immune to the disruption and anxiety 
that result?" 
</P>
<P>
Butterworth wasn't the only person upset by the commotion. 
</P>
<P>
Christina Smith, like everyone else in the town of 3,200, knows people who have 
left town for the week because of the prediction. "This Mr. Browning, he's got 
people terrified," she said. "That upsets me." 
</P>
<P>
At the winter meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, 
academic and government seismologists, also showed some concern Monday, saying 
they had become weary of trying to debunk the prediction, and adding that if -- 
by a freak of nature -- some quake did occur, the debate would be prolonged. 
</P>
<P>
"I just pray there's no earthquake, because if there is I'll never get anything 
done for months," said Thomas Heaton, seismologist in charge of the U.S. 
Geological Survey office in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the concern in New Madrid, was the large number of reporters that 
have overwhelmed the town. By one account, more than 100 television trucks were 
in the area, and, as 10-year-old Jonathan Hunter said: "If they (the reporters) 
didn't know something, they wouldn't be here." 
</P>
<P>
But for everyone frightened by the cameras, there seemed to be someone else 
drawn to them. Many people took to the streets with video camcorders so they 
could shoot back at the professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Browning himself has remained mostly silent. "He has not been talking to the 
press for five or six weeks," his wife told a reporter who called his home. She 
said he wasn't interested in responding to criticism. "It wouldn't do a bit of 
good," she said.

MIDEAST CRISIS: THE JOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN CALLS SOME OF THEM 'AMATEURS.' THE 
NUMBER OF RESERVISTS WHO CAN BE ORDERED TO DUTY IS RAISED TO 188,000.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff lashed out Monday at "amateurs" and 
former defense officials who have criticized the Bush Administration's Persian 
Gulf policy or suggested that he is keeping deep-seated reservations about it 
in the Pentagon from reaching the President's ears. 
</P>
<P>
"I have religiously conveyed the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 
substance, tone and tint to the President throughout this entire period," Gen. 
Colin L. Powell declared in a bristling statement to the Senate Armed Services 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
He used the "amateurs" label on critics who argue that air strikes alone should 
be employed if force is used against Iraq. "Incremental, may-work options . . . 
are not decisive. They are not success-oriented," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Powell and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney both sought to counter earlier 
damaging testimony from former defense officials and others who said that 
sanctions against Iraq could work and that going to war would be a costly 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The two military leaders argued that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein could ride 
out sanctions, and Cheney testified that "it is far better for us to deal with 
him now." 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, Cheney raised to 188,000 the maximum number of military reservists 
who can be ordered to duty in Operation Desert Shield. The previous limit was 
125,000, and more than 96,000 are already on active duty. 
</P>
<P>
The call-up of additional forces is likely to add to the controversy that first 
erupted on Capitol Hill when President Bush announced Nov. 8 that he was almost 
doubling the initial deployment of 230,000 troops in the Persian Gulf to create 
"an offensive option." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney and Powell both vehemently defended the strategy, arguing that 
international resolve to confront Hussein over his invasion and annexation of 
Kuwait may begin to waiver before he does. 
</P>
<P>
"The overwhelming conclusion I reach in assessing the situation is that we do 
not have an indefinite period of time to wait," Cheney said in testimony before 
the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Pressed by startled senators, who noted that most experts testifying before the 
committee have estimated that it would require between one year and 18 months 
for sanctions to take full effect, Cheney and Powell indicated that it may be 
unwise to wait even that long. 
</P>
<P>
"If Iraq does not have to take military pressure seriously, and is given 12 to 
18 months grace, they can put their army into somewhat of a state of 
hibernation and stretch their sustaining capability," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Cheney said he is less hopeful now than he was in August that an 
economic embargo can bend Iraq to the world's will. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Administration initially underestimated Iraq's ability to 
substantially expand its food production and mobilize its military resources in 
the face of an embargo. The newest estimates suggest that Iraq could probably 
"hunker down" and survive a long economic boycott, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Sanctions will not work, Cheney said he has concluded, because "given the 
nature of the regime, Saddam Hussein's brutality to his own people (and) his 
very tight control of that society . . . he can ride them out." 
</P>
<P>
Sparring with Cheney, Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said 
the Administration seems willing to dismiss the effect of sanctions too 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"If we go to war, we will never know whether they would have worked," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) complained that the Administration seems to be engaged 
in a rebuttal of its own policy of applying sanctions. He accused Cheney of 
taking "a Chicken Little approach to policy, saying the sky is falling and the 
only option we have is to go to war." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's decision to send Secretary of State James A. Baker III to Baghdad has 
been showered with bipartisan praise. But in private, a number of lawmakers and 
congressional aides are voicing concerns that the decision may represent little 
more than a tactic designed to quell criticism on Capitol Hill even as it helps 
to set the stage for eventual military action against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney described the Administration's moves as a "multi-track approach" of 
applying economic pressure through sanctions, military pressure through 
continuing troop deployments and the "exercise of a diplomatic alternative as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
"We are, in fact, exercising every single piece of leverage we can think of, 
internationally and unilaterally, to achieve the desired objective and we're 
moving on several fronts simultaneously," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, a number of key Democrats on Capitol Hill remain deeply skeptical of 
the motive behind Baker's mission. They question what it can accomplish given 
the fact that the White House has emphasized that there will be no negotiations 
-- only an ultimatum -- according to several senior congressional aides. 
</P>
<P>
"What Bush seems to be saying is we're willing to negotiate but our demands are 
non-negotiable. I don't think anybody around here really thinks that is going 
to work," said a congressional source who works for a key Democratic lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
There is growing concern, he added, that if the Baker mission fails to find a 
diplomatic solution, the attempt will compound the pressure to go to war by 
allowing Bush "to say he's gone the extra mile but to no avail." 
</P>
<P>
Laying out the rationale for Bush's decision to beef up the U.S. force in the 
Persian Gulf, Powell told the senators that, to be credible, the offensive 
option must be backed by overwhelming force capable of attacking Iraq from the 
air, sea and ground. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Powell derided as uninformed such officials as former Navy 
Secretary James H. Webb and independent military strategist Edward Luttwak, who 
questioned whether Powell had reflected concerns of his subordinates when 
taking with the President. 
</P>
<P>
The emotional remarks underscored a widening rift between Powell and some 
former Reagan Administration defense chiefs, such as his predecessor as 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs, retired Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., and Webb. 
</P>
<P>
Powell made his comments just two days after the President met with him and the 
chiefs of staff of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps to hear their 
views on Operation Desert Shield. The meeting came after a flurry of complaints 
by some military officials that the services were being left out of the 
planning process. 
</P>
<P>
The grumbling is fed by some in the military services who consider Powell more 
of a political general than one in tune with the troops. 
</P>
<P>
While the service chiefs met with Bush in August at the outset of the Middle 
East crisis, the group did not meet again with him until last Saturday, weeks 
after he had made the decision to augment U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia. In the 
meantime, Powell was the only member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to meet with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday in hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee, former 
Navy Secretary Webb urged committee members to "determine the range of advice 
the President received before implementing the present strategy." 
</P>
<P>
Luttwak, an analyst with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and 
International Studies, told committee members that not all of the chiefs -- 
most notably Gen. Carl E. Vuono, the Army chief of staff -- had been fully 
consulted in advance of the decision to increase U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion that Powell has neglected service concerns drew immediate 
denials from the Army and the Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt fully cut in," said one Marine officer who has worked closely with 
Gen. Alfred M. Gray, the Marine Corps commandant. Gray "has certainly had his 
positions heard," the officer added. 
</P>
<P>
An Army spokesman who represents Vuono said the general is satisfied with his 
input. 
</P>
<P>
Powell said Monday that he had met with all the service chiefs "some 30 times" 
in the last four months and that he has met individually with them daily. 
</P>
<P>
"The political leadership of this nation is enjoying solid, competent military 
advice from myself as well as from the other members of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Powell served during the Reagan Administration as White House national security 
adviser, and was widely considered a moderate in the Reagan White House. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday, Powell showed a more hawkish side, defending the decision to field 
a force "which seizes the initiative and forces the Iraqis to consider the 
consequences of a combined overwhelming air-land-sea campaign against a 
powerful coalition force." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "The question (the Iraqis) will have to consider is, do they move it, 
or do they lose it?" 
</P>
<P>
Powell also made a pitch for reservists during his testimony, saying that their 
participation "has been a significant factor in affording us flexibility and 
balance." 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon did not cite a specific reason for Monday's call-up of additional 
reservists -- an action that brings the President close to his legal limit for 
reservists. No more than 200,000 may be called up unless war or a national 
emergency is declared. 
</P>
<P>
The Army got the largest increase in authorizations for active duty -- from 
80,000 to 115,000. But the Navy got the largest proportional increase: its 
numbers tripled from 10,000 to 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Marines were raised from 15,000 to 23,000. The Air Force and Coast Guard 
reserve limits remain unchanged, at 20,000 and 1,250 respectively.

CRANSTON AIDE'S MEMOS POINT TO KEATING TIES

<P>
A fund-raiser for Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) acknowledged Monday in 
testimony before the Senate Ethics Committee that she wrote three memos in 1987 
and 1988 that appear to link nearly $1 million in contributions from Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr. with actions by the senator on 
Keating's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
The memos, which were made public for the first time, go to the heart of 
allegations being investigated by the Ethics Committee that Cranston acted 
improperly when he accepted huge contributions from Keating and then assisted 
in the S&amp;L owner's battle with federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it was learned that a federal grand jury in Los Angeles is nearing 
completion of an inquiry into Keating's relationship with Cranston and four 
other senators, Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), Donald W. 
Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) and John Glenn (D-Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
But William W. Taylor III, Cranston's attorney, cautioned that the California 
senator has not been notified that he is the target of a criminal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In the two years before the $2-billion collapse of Lincoln in April, 1989, 
Cranston contacted federal regulators on a number of occasions to inquire about 
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's investigation of mismanagement of the Irvine 
thrift, to arrange appointments for Keating or to urge regulators to approve 
the sale of the institution in early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he also solicited $60,000 from Keating for his campaigns, 
$85,000 for the California Democratic Party and $850,000 for voter registration 
groups founded by the senator. 
</P>
<P>
In her memos during that period, Joy Jacobson, the Cranston fund-raiser, kept 
her boss informed of developments involving Keating's battle with federal 
regulators and suggested amounts of money that might be solicited from the 
controversial thrift executive. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 6, 1987, for example, Jacobson wrote to Cranston that Keating would be 
coming to his office in the Capitol a few weeks later. She also noted that M. 
Danny Wall had a few months earlier been appointed as chairman of the bank 
board, replacing Edwin J. Gray, whom Keating viewed as his nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
She added that the appointment of Wall as bank board chairman was "obviously 
good news for Keating," because Wall's views were closer to those of Keating 
than were Gray's. Then, in the next sentence, she bluntly stated: "You should 
ask Keating for $250,000." 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier, closed-door interview with the committee, Jacobson was asked if 
there had been any link between the contributions and Cranston's activities on 
behalf of Keating. She replied: "In retrospect, I think that there was a link 
there. In the context in which I saw these contributions, I did not know all 
the other things that were going on." 
</P>
<P>
But under cross-examination by committee counsel Robert S. Bennett Monday, 
Jacobson insisted that there was no such link in Cranston's mind, even though 
she thought that Keating may have linked them in his mind. Keating has 
indicated that he made contributions to gain influence. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson's memos also disclosed the names of many other wealthy businessmen 
that Cranston apparently asked to contribute to his voter registration groups, 
including Edgar M. Bronfman, Philip Klutznick, Lester Crown and Donald J. 
Trump. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the memos, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), an Ethics Committee 
member and a highly successful fund-raiser himself, commented that fund raising 
had been elevated to "a fine art" by Cranston and Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Cranston's fund raising for voter registration fell far short of 
his goal of $15 million for 1987 and 1988. The largest contribution of $1 
million came from Joan B. Kroc, widow of McDonald's owner Ray Kroc, according 
to sources. 
</P>
<P>
An internal fund-raising document released Monday shows that Cranston received 
$25,000 from fashion designer Liz Claiborne, $20,000 from Disney executive 
Frank G. Wells, $25,000 from television producer Gary David Goldberg and $5,000 
from Disney executive Michael D. Eisner. He apparently sought $250,000 from 
movie producer Ted Field and $100,000 from singer and actress Barbra Streisand 
but received nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about her Sept. 6, 1987, memo advising Cranston to ask for $250,000 from 
Keating when the two men met on Sept. 24, Jacobson said that the intent of her 
memo was to persuade the senator not to ask for $500,000, as he had earlier 
suggested. "I thought it was too much," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Keating complied with the request for $250,000 and later gave another $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
She said that the memo mentioned the appointment of Wall only as an aside. It 
referred to a clipping from the Wall Street Journal about the new bank board 
chairman, which she had attached to the memo. But she acknowledged that she 
thought Keating would be "in a better frame of mind" because of the appointment 
of Wall. 
</P>
<P>
In another memo dated Jan. 2, 1987, to Cranston, Jacobson listed Keating as one 
of five "individuals who have been very helpful to you who have cases or 
legislative matters pending with our office who will rightfully expect some 
kind of resolution." 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning, she said that she was only telling the senator that Keating 
deserved a response to his request for help, although not necessarily a 
positive response. 
</P>
<P>
In her memo dated Jan. 18, 1988, Jacobson reminded Cranston that he had 
promised Keating during a dinner meeting in Los Angeles earlier that month that 
he would arrange a meeting between Wall and Keating. In addition, she reminded 
him to honor Keating's request for him to telephone bank board member Donald 
Hovde. Cranston later made good on both commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson's memo following up on the Los Angeles dinner is important because it 
shows that the two men had discussed both fund raising and the two calls that 
the senator would make on Keating's behalf. Cranston has acknowledged that the 
purpose of the dinner meeting was to discuss Keating's contributions to the 
voter registration effort. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Jacobson said that neither she nor Cranston ever promised 
contributors favors or help in return for money given to the campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Often during her eight years as a fund-raiser, Jacobson, an attractive young 
blond woman, recalled that "male contributors from time to time would say 
half-jokingly: 'What else do I get?' " She said that Cranston, overhearing such 
a remark, would reply: "You get good government." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson said that, in her contacts with Keating's aides, she avoided 
discussing their contributions and assistance by the senator for Lincoln at the 
same time. Such a linkage would be "tacky" and "counterproductive," she said, 
but not necessarily illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who demanded a favor from Cranston in return for a contribution was 
spurned, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I came into contact with people who said: 'I can do a $30,000 fund-raiser, and 
I need you to get that HUD grant,' " she declared. "I just threw those 
(telephone numbers) away. A lot of people out there were not subtle." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Ethics Committee have questioned why Jacobson, as a fund-raiser, 
attended meetings between Cranston, Keating and Keating's aides that focused 
entirely on the problems Lincoln was having with the bank board. Some members 
clearly view this as an implied link between Keating's contributions and 
Cranston's actions on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
But Jacobson explained that she attended these meetings simply to ensure that 
big donors such as Keating would not be left sitting in the office alone if 
Cranston was delayed or if the senator had to go to the Senate floor to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the Los Angeles grand jury is concentrating on the April 2, 
1987, meeting among Sens. Cranston, DeConcini, McCain and Glenn and regulator 
Gray. 
</P>
<P>
Action by the grand jury could come as soon as the end of December, one source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any information that Sen. Cranston is the target of a criminal 
investigation," Taylor said. ". . . We haven't heard 'boo' from the Justice 
Department in months." 
</P>
<P>
DeConcini said that he had provided his financial records to a grand jury more 
than eight months ago. And Thomas Green, lawyer for Riegle, insisted that the 
senator "is not under investigation by the FBI or anyone else."

WILSON WILL KEEP VOSS AS DIRECTOR OF AGRICULTURE;

<P>
Food and Agriculture Director Henry Voss, whose handling of this year's 
Mediterranean fruit fly infestation drew harsh criticism from some Southern 
California residents, was named Monday by Gov.-elect Pete Wilson to continue 
serving as director of the department. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, in an endorsement of the farm policies of the Deukmejian 
Administration, signaled that he will continue supporting the agriculture 
industry on such key issues as Medfly eradication, water allocation and trade 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the governor-elect said he will strip the Department of Food 
and Agriculture of its authority to register pesticides and monitor their use. 
Instead, Wilson will turn that responsibility over to a new California 
Environmental Protection Agency. The agriculture department has drawn fire for 
its dual and sometimes conflicting role of promoting agriculture while 
regulating pesticides that farmers use. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of Voss immediately drew an enthusiastic response from 
agriculture interests. Wilson, who received substantial campaign backing from 
farmers, got a standing ovation when he announced his choice Monday morning 
during a convention of the California Farm Bureau Federation. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be a popular appointment," Wilson observed. Shortly afterward he 
told reporters: "Mr. Voss has my confidence." 
</P>
<P>
The choice was criticized by Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los 
Angeles), who said the nomination will face tough scrutiny in the Senate 
because of Voss' approval of aerial malathion spraying over residential areas 
of Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties to eradicate the Mediterranean 
fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Voss hasn't displayed an excessive degree of sentiment to the problems of 
people who live in cities," Roberti said. "He will be grilled on that matter 
when he comes up for confirmation." 
</P>
<P>
Voss, 57, a San Joaquin Valley farmer, has been Gov. George Deukmejian's 
director of Food and Agriculture since May, 1989. He narrowly won Senate 
confirmation last March. Before his appointment, he served seven years as 
president of the California Farm Bureau Federation. 
</P>
<P>
During his directorship, the department has come under attack from 
environmentalists and farm labor advocates who charge that it is a pawn of the 
industry it is supposed to regulate. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the aerial pesticide spraying, the department has been 
criticized for allowing farmers to continue using hazardous pesticides and for 
its allegedly lax enforcement of laws designed to protect farm workers. One of 
Voss' most controversial decisions was his approval of two pesticides, aldicarb 
and atrazine, despite evidence they are polluting ground water in California. 
</P>
<P>
After Wilson announced his appointment, Voss defended his department's record 
but acknowledged that "the time has come" to remove control of pesticides from 
the Food and Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the department has done a very good job," Voss told reporters. 
"(But) there seems to be an overwhelming feeling that the department has a 
conflict of interest, and for the best interest of agriculture let's remove 
that perception of a conflict." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's reorganization plan calls for the creation of an Environmental 
Protection Agency that would be responsible for all environmental issues now 
handled by a variety of state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're interested in putting under one roof -- under one cabinet officer 
-- are all of the functions that relate to the protection of environmental 
quality," Wilson told reporters. Wilson said that under his plan, the 
Department of Food and Agriculture would focus more heavily on its mission of 
promoting California agriculture here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The department would retain the authority to conduct aerial spraying of 
malathion if it is necessary to wipe out Medfly infestations. It is unclear, 
aides to Wilson said, whether the director would keep some authority over 
pesticides, including the power to ban those that contaminate ground water. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you're going to see much of a difference," Voss said. "I don't 
think things would be done very differently had they been over in another 
agency." 
</P>
<P>
Both Wilson and Voss said they hope to handle Medfly infestations with the 
release of sterile flies. Voss said facilities are now operating that can 
produce 1 billion sterile flies a week -- more than five times the number 
available at the height of this summer's infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said aerial spraying of malathion over urban neighborhoods could again 
become necessary and added: "I'd rather do it than have the federal government 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's appointment of Voss and his willingness to spray malathion prompted 
criticism from Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), whose San Fernando Valley 
district was among the areas treated this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that Wilson will continue Deukmejian's 'spray first, ask questions 
later' policy," Katz said. "It's disappointing that the new governor isn't 
going to show more sensitivity to urban concerns and people who don't like 
being sprayed by pesticides."

ON CALIFORNIA: INDIO'S DATE WITH DESTINY 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
INDIO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let's start with the date shake. By all accounts, the Coachella Valley's most 
famous refreshment was invented by one Russ Nichol, proprietor of the Valerie 
Jean Date Shop. This was back in the '40s and Nichol, in a small stroke of 
genius, decided he would take advantage of two essential facts of life in 
Indio. 
</P>
<P>
First, summers here were very hot. Indio is stuck at the tail end of the 
Coachella Valley just down the road from Thermal, and Thermal didn't get its 
name for nothing. In the '40s, before air conditioning, the heat of an Indio 
summer would drive people a little crazy. They'd do anything for a moment's 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the date market was sluggish. As usual. Ever since the first palm tree 
produced the first commercial date in Indio in the 1920s, no one had figured 
out quite what to do with a fruit that went by names like Deglet Noor, Medjool 
and Halawi. Whatever made the Arabs love dates, Americans hadn't figured it 
out. So one day Nichol took a standard milkshake and mixed in some date 
nuggets. He whirred the whole thing in a blender and tried a sip. It was 
delicious. And cold. Soon the date shake was a phenomenon. It became a sort of 
icon of the desert, the thing you simply had to have when motoring into the 
strange world beyond Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
I tell this story because the invention of the shake remains the first triumph 
in the marketing of dates. And the last. Once the flutter over the shake died 
down, the date business returned to its sleepy ways, stuck in its role as a 
mere curiosity of the desert. The farmers of Indio abandoned their dreams of 
becoming date tycoons. 
</P>
<P>
Until now. In one of the stranger ironies of our time, the date groves are once 
again alive with ambition. Times are flush, and growers talk of world markets 
with the confidence of bankers. And they owe it all to Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what happened: when Hussein invaded Kuwait and brought down the world's 
wrath, there were repercussions beyond the oil markets. The economic embargo 
slapped on Iraq not only shut down the country's sales of crude but also its 
major agricultural export -- dates. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons too complicated to explain here, Iraq more or less owned the world 
export business in dates. They sold to the British, they sold to the Japanese, 
and even here in the United States they sold more dates than did all the 
farmers of the Coachella Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But no more. For the last four months there have been zero exports of dates 
from Iraq. Geopolitics has shut down the date pipeline, and someone will have 
to step in and pick up the slack. The farmers of the Coachella hope it will be 
they. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Stocks thinks it's about time. The dates of the Coachella Valley are 
better than Iraq's imports anyway, she says. Stocks and her sister, Catherine 
Kerby, have run the groves of Covalda Date Co. since their father retired some 
years ago. They both grew up in the groves and say it's always been a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1940s the family went bankrupt trying to fight a big co-op that wanted 
to control dates in the valley. Eventually the co-op dissolved and the family 
rebuilt their business. In recent weeks, Stocks says, they have been getting 
inquiries about dates from "people with strange accents." She figures they are 
Middle Easterners living in America who once bought Iraqi dates. Now these 
people are about to discover, she says, just how good American dates can be. 
</P>
<P>
Down the road there are Ben and Pat Laflin, whose family planted some of the 
first date palms in the valley. Their father came to Coachella Valley after 
contracting malaria in the oil fields of Oklahoma. The desert cured him and he 
grew dates the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Laflin is dubious that dates will turn into the wonder crop of 1990 because 
of the Gulf crisis. She's heard it all before, and has been disappointed 
before. Still, she says, you never know. There's a lot of Japanese, a lot of 
Europeans, and they all need dates. 
</P>
<P>
The date people are conscious, above all, that they have something rare to 
offer the world. Very few places can grow date palms, and the Coachella Valley 
is the only spot in the United States that's managed it successfully. 
</P>
<P>
If only the world will now notice. And care. Outside their roadside stands, the 
signs beckon as always. "Say it with Dates," they urge, or "Remember a Friend 
Today." 
</P>
<P>
And at the bottom of each sign is the other, eternal message. The one the 
farmers hope the world will see. It simply says, "We ship anywhere."

SCIENCE, OZONE LAYER; 
</P>
<P>
CHEMICALS STILL STRATOSPHERIC PROBLEM, EXPERT SAYS 
</P>

<P>
Chemicals that are eating a hole in the Earth's protective ozone layer are 
still being released into the air at record levels despite international 
agreements to phase out their use, a world-renowned University of California 
chemist said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
F. Sherwood Rowland, the UC Irvine scientist who discovered the link between 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and the ozone layer 17 years ago, released the 
results of tests that show emission of the chemicals reached a record high this 
year and are growing. 
</P>
<P>
"The striking thing is that we haven't seen the fall-off yet," Rowland said. 
"We thought by now we'd see a little downturn, but we haven't. The announced 
cutbacks so far haven't shown up in the atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Rowland has predicted that a slight drop might occur next year, but he warned 
that the worst is yet to come for the expanding hole in the ozone shield 
because of the delayed reaction of the chemicals. The hole in the layer -- 
which protects Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation -- is expected to 
continue to expand until at least 2010, even if controls now in place are 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
The world's major industrialized nations agreed in the 1987 Montreal Protocol 
to cut use of CFCs in half by the end of the century. In June, they refined the 
pact by agreeing to cut use by 20% by 1993, and 50% by 1995, eliminating them 
by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Dupont and Allied-Signal, the two largest U.S. producers of the 
chemicals, have said they will stop manufacturing them by then. The chemicals 
are used mainly as industrial cleaning solvents and as cooling agents in 
refrigerators and car air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those announcements, Rowland said, the last five years have been the 
worst in history when it comes to the increase in CFCs entering the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland and his research team have been collecting air samples at remote sites 
over the Pacific Ocean from Alaska to New Zealand since 1978. The most recent 
report, which compares results at more than 60 sites through June, 1990, was 
presented Monday at an annual conference of the American Geophysical Union in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
CFCs release chlorine that moves up in the stratosphere and destroys ozone. The 
resulting increased penetration of ultraviolet radiation can lead to skin 
cancer and cataracts. Scientists also believe CFCs can cause global warming, 
increase smog, and endanger ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
An increasingly major source of the problem is CFC 113, a solvent still used 
widely by industry to clean electronic parts, according to Rowland's report. 
Manufacturers have said they know of no low-polluting substitute for the 
chemical in most of their metal-cleaning operations. 
</P>
<P>
Use of the industrial chemical in 1988 was about three times greater than in 
1976, according to Rowland's data. It is now about equal to emissions from the 
two other major CFCs that are used mostly in air conditioners and refrigerators 
and as blowing agents during the manufacture of foam and polystyrene. 
</P>
<P>
In the four-county Los Angeles basin, about 7,000 tons of CFCs are released 
into the air a year, with the largest sources industrial plants using them as 
cleaning solvents, according to a recent report by the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District.

Rowland said that even with a downturn next year, he and other scientists are 
concerned that the hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica will continue to 
grow rapidly because CFCs can take 10 years after they are released into the 
air to reach their maximum ozone-destroying potential. The compounds have a 
life of at least 60 years, with some lasting over 100 years.

When Arizona Republic investigative reporter Don Bolles died on June 13, 1976, 
from wounds suffered in a car bombing 11 days earlier, police quickly arrested 
John Harvey Adamson. 
</P>
<P>
Officials and newspaper executives said the arrest was only the beginning. They 
vowed not to rest until everyone connected with the murder had been brought to 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
But more than 14 years later, only Adamson remains behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
And while the investigation continues, many wonder whether the case will ever 
be solved, whether the conspirators will ever be punished, whether it's even 
worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Those who knew Bolles and have been close to the case over the years agree on 
one thing: They can't believe the investigation is still open at this late 
date. 
</P>
<P>
But their opinions on the probe vary. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like Bill Shover, spokesman for the company that owns the Arizona 
Republic, believe in the state's original theory: Adamson, a local greyhound 
breeder, planted a remote-controlled bomb and it was detonated by plumber James 
Robison. The two were hired by Phoenix contractor Max Dunlap, the theory goes, 
because Bolles had written articles that damaged the business interests of 
Dunlap's friend, Kemper Marley. 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap and Robison were convicted in the case and sentenced to death, but in 
1980 the state Supreme Court ruling reversed their convictions and they were 
never retried. Still, Shover said, the state's theory has yet to be disproved. 
</P>
<P>
"All this new stuff that comes up, I don't know where it comes from," said 
Shover, who testified in January before a state grand jury that has been 
looking into the case for a year. "They're chasing all these shadows." 
</P>
<P>
In disagreement with Shover is Jonathan Marshall, former publisher of the 
Scottsdale Progress, a neighboring newspaper that competes with the Arizona 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall, who over the years led a campaign to keep alive interest in the 
crime, said when Adamson, Robison and Dunlap were charged "most people thought 
they got the right guys. It all sounded very real." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Marshall has become convinced of Dunlap's innocence and subscribes 
to another theory -- that the murder was ordered by Bradley Funk, whose family 
and Emprise Corp. owned most of Arizona's dog racing tracks at the time of 
Bolles' death. Emprise, now known as Delaware North, was a New York-based 
sports conglomerate that recently had been convicted of conspiring to hide a 
Mafia interest in a Las Vegas casino. 
</P>
<P>
"Emprise" was one of the words a wounded Bolles uttered after the explosion. He 
also said "John Adamson" and "Mafia." 
</P>
<P>
Marley and Funk -- both of whom denied involvement in the slaying -- were never 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
Marley, 83, an Arizona real estate baron and liquor magnate, died of cancer 
June 25 at his La Jolla, Calif., home. Funk, 57, suffered a fatal heart attack 
Jan. 30 while driving in the parking lot of a Phoenix hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Early, city editor at the Republic when Bolles was killed, labeled 
Marshall's views "hokum." He considers the reversal of the Robison and Dunlap 
convictions "absolutely outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
Although a new trial was ordered, it never occurred. Adamson, who had 
cooperated with the prosecution in return for a plea-bargained 20-year term on 
a charge of second-degree murder, refused to testify again without further 
concessions from the state. When prosecutors refused, charges against Dunlap 
and Robison were dropped and Adamson was retried, convicted of murder and 
sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
His death sentence was overturned in 1988 by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals, which reinstated the original sentence. After the U.S. Supreme Court 
in June declined to review that decision, prosecutors asked the circuit court 
to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Atty. Gen. Bob Corbin said he is more hopeful than he has been in 
years about the investigation, which was intensified two years ago. Corbin, who 
did not run for reelection after serving 12 years, knows critics believe he has 
not done enough to bring the case to a close. 
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to what people say, honestly, we have investigated every lead no 
matter how ridiculous it may have seemed. Most have gotten nowhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Robison, who has been serving a 29-year term for an unrelated 
assault, was again charged with murdering Bolles. His second trial -- which is 
not expected to include testimony from Adamson -- is slated for January. 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap has remained free since his conviction was overturned and has pursued a 
lawsuit alleging the Phoenix Police Department hid evidence that would have 
cleared him. Since August, his home has been searched twice by investigators.

WAR POWERS;

COURTS RELUCTANT TO RESTRICT PRESIDENT IN STARTING CONFLICTS

<TEXT>
<P>
The Constitution, though vague on many points, is quite clear on one: "Congress 
shall have the power . . . to declare war." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the White House says President Bush can begin a war against Iraq on his own 
authority. Bush has promised only to "consult" with congressional leaders but 
not to seek a formal vote of approval by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
If the President is violating the Constitution, why doesn't someone go to court 
and force him to stop? 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many have paraded into court over the last 25 years, urging that the 
President's war powers be curtailed. So far, however, no one has succeeded in 
stopping a war in court. 
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND: "The courts have developed all sorts of technical ways to say: 'We 
don't want to get into this,' " said Hofstra University law professor Leon 
Friedman, who spent much of the Vietnam era trying to get a court to halt that 
undeclared war. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, judges have said that those challenging the President do not have 
"standing" in court because they have not suffered a true "injury." 
</P>
<P>
On other occasions, judges have said the challenge is "premature" or "not ripe" 
because the injury had not yet occurred. Other judges have said simply that 
these issues are "political," not legal, and cannot be resolved by a court. 
</P>
<P>
But the many admonitions to "go away" have not stopped lawyers from trying. 
Today, attorneys representing 54 members of Congress will go before a federal 
judge here, asking him to block Bush from undertaking "an offensive military 
attack" in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ratner, an attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights in New 
York, said: "We are in the best position we could be in." That is so, he said, 
because the White House admits that an outbreak of fighting in the Persian Gulf 
will be a "war," not a "police action" such as in Grenada. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley) and the other congressmen say they are 
protecting their constitutional right to vote on whether the nation should go 
to war. Judge Harold Greene, a notably independent jurist, will hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
If that lawsuit fails, Ratner has a second waiting. Sgt. Michael Ange, 26, a 
reservist, is challenging Bush's authority to send him to the gulf for duty in 
an undeclared war. His suit will be heard on Dec. 10 by Judge Royce Lamberth. 
Ange says Bush has violated the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution of 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department attorneys do not have to persuade the courts that Bush has 
the power he claims. That might be difficult, considering the Constitution's 
clear language and "original intent." 
</P>
<P>
"In no part of the Constitution is more wisdom to be found," said James 
Madison, its prime author, "than in the clause which confides the question of 
war or peace to the legislature, not to the executive department." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the government says the lawsuits should be thrown out of court without 
a ruling on their merits. "The plaintiffs do not have proper standing, the 
issues are political and not judicial, and the (suit) is premature," the 
Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: The precedents are all on the government's side. In 1987, for example, 
a court dismissed a suit by 110 members of Congress contending that President 
Ronald Reagan violated the War Powers Resolution by putting U.S. flags on 
Kuwaiti oil tankers in the war-torn Persian Gulf. The court said the 
congressmen had no "standing" to challenge Reagan, and their suit raised a 
"political" issue. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court has rarely had to rule on these war-powers cases because they 
have been dismissed in the lower courts. But, in 1980, the justices suggested 
that no congressional representative, or bloc of representatives, can speak for 
Congress. To have legal power, a majority of Congress must act in concert, the 
court said. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department takes the same view. The proper way to handle a dispute 
over the war powers is through a "give and take between the two political 
branches" of government, the Justice Department said.

U.S. ARAB ALLIES SKEPTICAL OF BUSH OFFER FOR IRAQ TALKS; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: SOME FEAR THAT HUSSEIN WILL PRY A WEDGE IN THE INTERNATIONAL 
ALLIANCE AND ATTAIN A COMPROMISE ON KUWAIT.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arab leaders have greeted recent moves to set up direct talks between the 
United States and Iraq with substantial skepticism, and representatives of the 
multinational military force here are predicting that war will be the final 
outcome of this latest diplomatic initiative. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials characterize President Bush's invitation for an exchange of 
visits by top foreign-policy officials as a last chance to convince Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein of the formidable odds against him. However, some Arab 
officials fear that Iraq could seize on the dialogue to pry a wedge in the 
international alliance and gain ground toward a compromise regarding Kuwait, 
which it invaded Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"If the talks are going to liberate Kuwait and avoid the war, that will be 
fantastic. But you have to know the psychology of the Iraqis. Iraq may see this 
as an opportunity to split the alliance," said one leading Persian Gulf 
diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's be frank," he declared. "We don't want war. Nobody wants war. We will be 
maybe more the losers than the Americans, who may lose casualties, but we will 
lose everything. But that doesn't mean to give up Kuwait to the Iraqi regime." 
</P>
<P>
Western officials here who are backing the dialogue insist there will be no 
options tendered by Secretary of State James A. Baker III other than a complete 
withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. But even those most optimistic about 
the talks admitted that a peaceful settlement remains unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
"What I hope is that Baker can give a more convincing rendition to Saddam, and 
he therefore realizes the error of his ways. But I am frankly very pessimistic 
that will happen," said a Western diplomat allied with the multinational forces 
in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that in fact . . . Hussein still feels that he has sufficient control 
over his people that even if their sacrifice is greater than ours in terms of 
casualties, in the end his people will endure that burden better than we will 
endure ours," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think one thing Saddam has not calculated is the speed with which we can 
attack. . . . I suspect that President Bush would have a week to two weeks 
before he would face severe repercussions in terms of the casualty reports at 
home, and whatever time period that is, it's not going to be long enough for 
Saddam Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
The message from multinational force leaders here is that no options for 
compromise exist until Iraq complies with the full text of U.N. Security 
Council resolutions demanding a complete withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to pull all the way out, the Sabahs (Kuwaiti ruling family) have to 
be restored, the hostages have to be released and there's nothing that's going 
to be negotiated until that happens," one Western envoy said. "He either 
withdraws or he doesn't, and if he doesn't, we're looking at a war." 
</P>
<P>
Arab political leaders and intellectuals remain split over the advisability of 
going to war, but a large number of Saudis say plainly that the world has 
already waited too long. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not warmongers. But war is a continuation of diplomacy, and it is the 
last resort when politics fail," said Wahid Hashem, a columnist and political 
science professor at King Abdulaziz University in Jidda. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the time is now. In August, I thought it would be two weeks, three 
weeks before we entered into Kuwait, and now we are three months? The more we 
are philosophizing, the more we are losing time and the more he gets entrenched 
in Kuwait," said another Saudi with close ties to the government. 
</P>
<P>
Some Arabs have complained that the United States was premature in extending 
the dialogue invitation to Iraq so soon after passage of the U.N. Security 
Council resolution authorizing the use of force to dislodge Iraqi troops after 
Jan. 15, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"There's some feeling that Bush is kind of killing the resolution of the 
Security Council. He should have waited two or three days just to see what the 
Iraqi reaction would be," said one gulf area official. "There's sentiment as if 
he wanted to reduce the tension. Why? You see, the Arab world, they don't trust 
the Americans. . . . They think all of this is starting to sell (out) Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
Several Arab officials said they are convinced that Hussein will use the talks 
as a means of introducing new complications into the picture, such as an offer 
to partially withdraw from Kuwait or to release the hostages pending more 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"The grace period between now and Jan. 15 will be utilized by Saddam getting 
all sorts of rabbits and pigeons out of his political hat," Salman Abdul-Razek 
Mutawa, Kuwait's exiled minister of planning, said in an interview. "Saddam 
Hussein will use all the tricks available. He will fill the 45 days with 90 
items, and maybe before the zero hour, he may appear with yet another 
half-baked idea. He will pull at any rope that is thrown to him." 
</P>
<P>
Some gulf officials expressed fears that such Iraqi offers could allow the Jan. 
15 deadline to come and go, eventually leaving Kuwaitis themselves so 
despondent that they will begin pushing for compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you very frankly what I fear: If the 15th of January arrives and 
nothing happens, Kuwait will lose hope, will lose patience," said one Arab 
diplomat. "We will see some pressure from the Kuwaiti people to have some 
compromise, from people saying I prefer to have half of the house than being 
totally out." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, both the Saudis and the Kuwaitis have left open the possibility of full 
negotiations with Iraq on border and financial disputes after a complete 
withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations are not ruled out after a complete withdrawal; there will be some 
things to negotiate, to work out between Iraq and Kuwait," Mutawa said. 
</P>
<P>
"All that is up to the Kuwaitis. Any deals the Kuwaitis make, as long as our 
demands are met, including guarantees that such a thing would never happen 
again, are OK," said a Saudi government official. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Saudi and Kuwaiti governments have officially welcomed Bush's dialogue 
proposal despite some private reservations. "Bush wants to give the Iraqis 
another chance," a Saudi official explained. "There are too many people who are 
saying you didn't give the guy a chance. You didn't even talk to him." 
</P>
<P>
Western officials rejected fears expressed by some Kuwaitis and other Arabs 
that Kuwait could become another Palestine, left to years of fruitless 
negotiations and no ultimate resolution. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as there are hundreds of thousands of troops here in Saudi Arabia, 
while the oil price goes up and down, nobody's going to forget about it. We're 
not going to forget about it while there are hostages there. Too many people 
are involved, very directly, for that to happen," said one Western envoy. 
</P>
<P>
Western officials also rejected assertions that the United States is allowing 
Iraq to wrest away control of the situation in the gulf. To the contrary, said 
one official, "The U.S. has had the benefit of seizing the initiative without 
having some side actor come up with yet another peace plan, of having the 
calendar of events be dictated from Washington, rather than Baghdad, which is 
about time." 
</P>
<P>
Privately, some officials expressed hope that a Baker visit to Baghdad could, 
if not persuade Hussein to withdraw, perhaps convince some of his lieutenants 
that the Iraqi president is leading the nation on a ruinous expedition. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Saddam will be scared lightly, but I hope some people around him 
will have some second thoughts, including the Iraqi people," said one official. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Western official here said the key to avoiding war is the West's 
determination to firmly hold onto the military solution as an option over the 
next few critical weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a question of being optimistic or pessimistic," he said. "It's a 
question of being resolute or not. 
</P>
<P>
"If the international community keeps very resolute, and (keeps) threatening to 
resort to force if they don't withdraw, I think there is a good chance for 
peace. If there are trends trying to make peace at any cost, at any price, 
showing there might be some disunity in the community, then in my view there is 
no choice for peace. It is as simple as that."

U.S. MAY TOUGHEN TRAVEL ADVISORY, CUT GULF AREA STAFFS; 
</P>
<P>
MIDEAST: IT MAY URGE MORE AMERICANS TO LEAVE SAUDI ARABIA, YEMEN AND JORDAN AS 
U.N. DEADLINE APPROACHES.

<P>
U.S. officials are considering a stronger travel warning for Americans in Saudi 
Arabia and contemplating a reduction in embassy staffs throughout the Middle 
East in areas where there might be popular opposition to a military conflict 
with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The British Embassy already has reiterated an earlier travel advisory for 
citizens in Saudi Arabia's oil-rich Eastern province, advising British 
dependents to take holiday vacations in England and remain outside Saudi Arabia 
"until the situation in the (Persian) Gulf becomes clearer." 
</P>
<P>
Both moves come shortly after passage of a U.N. Security Council resolution 
giving Iraq a Jan. 15, 1991, deadline for pulling out of Kuwait, a move that 
officials here say has prompted a re-evaluation of whether the thousands of 
foreign workers in Saudi Arabia can safely remain at their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is obviously a new development that could lead to something, so you have 
to review your guidance," said one source familiar with the reviews. "How can 
they make it a little bit stronger without causing unnecessary panic?" 
</P>
<P>
Since mid-August, a U.S. travel advisory has advised families of American 
workers in the Eastern province, the center of the U.S. military buildup and 
the region closest to the Kuwait border, to leave the country. About 6,000 to 
7,000 Americans have either left the province or failed to return from summer 
vacations outside the kingdom, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, U.S. officials are looking at the possibility of extending the 
recommendation for dependents to include non-essential employees in the Eastern 
province, or perhaps to make such departures mandatory. Another proposal under 
review would extend the travel advisory to all or part of the Central province, 
which includes the capital of Riyadh. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials are also looking at reducing embassy staffs in Saudi Arabia and 
in countries elsewhere in the Middle East, such as Jordan and Yemen, where a 
conflict with Iraq might spark popular unrest. Some non-essential embassy 
personnel already have left the embassy in Yemen, and some embassy dependents 
in Jordan have left the country. 
</P>
<P>
Travel advisories recommending departures for dependents in Bahrain, the United 
Arab Emirates and Qatar are also under review. 
</P>
<P>
Embassy officials here refused to comment on the proposals. Spokesman John 
Kincannon said the State Department has made no decision on tightening travel 
restrictions or reducing embassy staffing levels. "We're sort of assessing 
possibilities, discussing contingencies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of an impending upgrade in the travel advisory have already sent some 
shock waves through the business community in Riyadh, where companies may face 
large costs for sending dependents home. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't mind evacuating them if it's really not safe here. What we want to 
know is why they've told us all along it was safe to be here, and all of a 
sudden now it's not safe?" one U.S. business manager asked. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, most officials believe that Riyadh would likely not be severely 
threatened even in the event of a war with Iraq. However, the northern portion 
of the Central province, near the Iraqi border and the giant military base at 
Hafar al Batin, likely would be threatened, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi officials have also expressed concern over any travel advisories that 
would prompt an exodus of foreign workers, who form the backbone of some of the 
kingdom's most critical industries, including the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Saudi Arabia's not quite like other countries. We all know about the large 
foreign presence here and the large number of basic services that are provided 
by foreigners, and that includes the military," said one diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 15,000 to 18,000 U.S. citizens in Saudi Arabia, about 13,000 of 
them in the Eastern province. About 23,000 British citizens are in the kingdom. 
Embassy officials said about 3,000 to 4,000 Britons have left Saudi Arabia 
since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.

Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, facing a runoff this weekend against dark-horse 
candidate Stanislaw Tyminski in the race for the national presidency, has 
received the backing of Poland's powerful Roman Catholic church. 
</P>
<P>
A pastoral letter issued by Polish bishops was read at most church services 
Sunday, and although the letter itself did not name Walesa, it noted that the 
"leadership of our state should be entrusted to a person who, guided by 
Christian values, will guarantee continuation and consolidation" of the 
struggle against "the yoke of totalitarian constraint." 
</P>
<P>
Most pastors, if samplings in Warsaw are a fair indication, were far more 
direct in their commentaries delivered along with the reading of the letter. 
</P>
<P>
"Practically," said one pastor, "we have one candidate to vote for. The other 
is simply a KGB agent, as we could plainly see from television and other 
publications, who has been placed in Poland in order to destroy Poland's 
newborn democracy and throw us back into the darkness of a totalitarian 
system." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, knocked out of the running 
for president by Tyminski in the Nov. 25 elections, asked his supporters to 
vote for Walesa in the final round of the election, which is scheduled for 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"In the face of the irresponsibility that may endanger Poland and everything we 
have been struggling toward for 10 years, we should cast our ballots for Mr. 
Walesa," Mazowiecki said in a weekend speech launching the Union of Polish 
Democracy, a group that, he added, may be devoted to opposing Walesa in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki was a key adviser to Walesa for nine years, dating from the earliest 
days of the Solidarity movement, but the presidential campaign brought about a 
sharp cleavage between the two men and their followers. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of the challenge by Tyminski, an unknown Canadian businessman, most 
of Mazowiecki's followers, although bitterly antagonistic to Walesa's ambitions 
during recent months, have urged voters to support Walesa. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old Tyminski has been bedeviled in the last week by mounting 
accusations in the Polish press that his campaign staff is composed of a large 
number of former Polish SB (security service) agents of the former Communist 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech Sunday, Tyminski did little to dampen the suspicions over his 
background, asserting that he had been approached "repeatedly" to work as a spy 
for the Communist authorities. He said he rejected the offers. 
</P>
<P>
"I had proposals several years ago to work for the SB, . . . and I refused," 
Tyminski said in a rally in Bialystok in eastern Poland. Those approaches came, 
he said, after he had emigrated from Poland. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he had also been approached before he left Poland, 21 years ago, 
to go to Sweden, but "I did not agree to collaborate." 
</P>
<P>
The pro-government daily newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza alleged Monday that Tyminski 
was able to get a passport to leave Poland for Sweden in 1969, when he was a 
student, only after talking to military intelligence officers. The newspaper 
did not cite a source for its information. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, United Press International reported that it has documentary 
evidence showing that Tyminski had been judged unfit for regular military 
service in 1968, a year before he emigrated to Canada to make his fortune. 
</P>
<P>
A two-page document from the local military draft commission that handled 
Tyminski's case said he qualified for military service in 1967, but a 1968 
entry in the document said he was unfit for basic military service and could 
only serve in the auxiliary, such as in hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
According to UPI, the document cited paragraphs 66 and 71 of the military 
commission qualifying code. Paragraph 66 refers to "epilepsy with frequent 
bouts and changes in the area of intellect and behavior." The explanation for 
Paragraph 71 is listed as "reactive psychosis," a mental disease characterized 
among other things by an inability to differentiate critically. 
</P>
<P>
A third entry in 1969 judged him again unfit for basic military duty but 
eligible for auxiliary duty, on grounds of Paragraph 69 -- "an incorrect 
psychic personality which is treatable." 
</P>
<P>
Tyminski, who returned to Poland last September, has denied all the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Poland's interior minister said the ministry's records show that 
Tyminski received seven visas for travel to Poland from the Polish Embassy in 
Tripoli, Libya, between 1980 and 1989. Tyminski has denied repeatedly that he 
has ever been in Libya.

<P>
A rebellious faction of Argentine officers staged a bloody but unsuccessful 
anti-government uprising Monday, two days before a scheduled visit here by 
President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Rebels seized the army headquarters in downtown Buenos Aires, a block from the 
presidential palace, and three other military installations, battling troops 
loyal to the government throughout the day. The hostilities included heavy 
rifle fire, cannon shots and even aerial bombing of rebel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
At least six military personnel were killed and an estimated 200 people were 
wounded, the local news agency DYN reported. It said five civilians were killed 
in a bus hit by a rebel armored vehicle. The wounded included four news 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth rebellion since April, 1987, by a movement of disgruntled 
nationalist officers nicknamed the Painted Faces for the camouflage grease 
paint they have used. But it was the first uprising since President Carlos Saul 
Menem took office in June, 1989, and Menem called it a coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference Monday night, Menem said the government had foiled the 
uprising and dismantled the movement behind it. 
</P>
<P>
"It is definitively concluded," he said. "It is finished, and the Painted Faces 
are being finished, and all of this veritable clown act that has caused so much 
damage to the country." 
</P>
<P>
Menem, 60, said that "more than 50" rebels have been arrested. He indicated 
that they would be court-martialed for rebellion, which can bring the death 
penalty under Argentina's military code. 
</P>
<P>
"The president's hand will not tremble, no matter what the penalty may be," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's revolt began before dawn, at about the same time that Bush was 
arriving in neighboring Brazil to begin a weeklong South American tour. Bush is 
scheduled to come to Argentina on Wednesday, and Menem said that the visit has 
been "totally ratified" since the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina's Painted Faces are right-wing officers with the rank of colonel and 
lower who complain that civilian government has reduced the living standards 
and prestige of the armed forces. They oppose many of Menem's economic 
policies, including the privatization of government-owned enterprises such as 
the telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of rebels, acting in coordinated operations, seized the army 
headquarters, the Patricios infantry regiment barracks in the capital's eastern 
district of Palermo, a tank factory at Boulogne on the outskirts of the city, 
and part of a coast guard base. 
</P>
<P>
Menem quickly imposed a state of siege and ordered military commanders to put 
down the uprising. Speaking Monday night, the president said the commanders 
obeyed his instructions to move forcefully and accept only unconditional 
surrender by the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Argentines watched the sporadic fighting live on television. Government offices 
and many stores closed early, and traffic was sparse during what is normally 
the evening rush hour. Otherwise city life was hardly disrupted outside the 
cordoned areas of conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The first rebels to surrender were those who seized part of the coast guard 
installation in the city's River Plate port. Two loyalist sailors were 
reportedly killed. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting was heaviest at the Patricios infantry regiment, where rebels killed a 
colonel, a lieutenant colonel and a noncommissioned officer when they took over 
the compound. Fighting there continued into the afternoon, when government 
tanks moved into the compound and a 105-millimeter howitzer fired on the 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, about 100 rebels surrendered the compound, which was heavily damaged 
by the battle. Col. Enrique Baraldini, identified as the leader of the 
uprising, was among those taken prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting was less severe at the Boulogne tank factory, where rebels retreating 
in an armored vehicle hit a bus, killing five civilians. In the province of 
Entre Rios, north of Buenos Aires, air force Canberra warplanes bombed a column 
of rebel tanks on a highway near the city of Gualeguaychu, damaging some of the 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
The body of a rebel colonel was found in a damaged tank, DYN said. No other 
rebellious activity was reported in the provinces. 
</P>
<P>
During fighting at the downtown army headquarters, stray bullets hit the nearby 
presidential office building, called the Casa Rosada. 
</P>
<P>
Loyal troops surrounded the massive army building. It was not clear how many 
floors the rebels held, but shooting issued periodically from the neoclassical 
structure. The rebels inside finally gave up shortly after 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The army did not report the total number of captured rebels, but it far 
exceeded the "more than 50" mentioned by Menem, who said that justice would be 
swift. 
</P>
<P>
"The courts-martial already are functioning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the rebels were followers of Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin, the top 
leader of the Painted Faces who currently is under military detention, Menem 
said he did not know. But a rebel spokesman told reporters earlier in the day: 
"Within the army, we do not recognize any other legitimate authority than that 
of Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin." 
</P>
<P>
The rebels claimed that their purpose was to bring changes in the army high 
command, but Menem insisted: "For the president of the nation, it was an 
attempted coup d'etat." 
</P>
<P>
The armed forces governed Argentina from March, 1976, to December, 1983. In the 
late 1970s, about 9,000 Argentines disappeared in a "dirty war" between 
security forces and leftist rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, military pressure has resulted in pardons for all but a few of the 
hundreds of officers jailed for violating human rights. Menem pardoned 39 of 
them and also pardoned more than 100 officers who took part in earlier 
rebellions. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night he said there will be no more leniency for rebellious officers, 
but he repeated a promise to pardon former junta leaders imprisoned for human 
rights violations in the 1970s. They are former President Jorge R. Videla, the 
general who led a coup in 1976; former President Roberto E. Viola, the general 
who succeeded Videla, and former Adm. Emilio E. Massera, a member of Videla's 
junta. Menem said the pardons are needed for "national reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Monday's military uprising was Argentina's fourth in four years. In April, 
1987, Lt. Col. Aldo Rico and about 130 men briefly seized an infantry school. 
No one was killed. In January, 1988, Rico fled house arrest and, with about 200 
followers seized a rural garrison. Surrounded by government troops, they 
surrendered. Again there were no deaths. In December, 1988, Col. Mohamed Ali 
Seineldin and scores of followers took over an army arsenal before giving up. 
One civilian was killed.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS DEAL BLOW TO GINGRICH IN LEADERSHIP VOTE

In a sharp setback for combative Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and 
hard-line conservatives, House Republicans on Monday rejected his candidate for 
the No. 3 leadership post and reelected a moderate Californian, Rep. Jerry 
Lewis (R-Highland), after a bitter contest that left deep divisions in GOP 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
The usually affable and soft-spoken Lewis, who defeated Rep. Carl D. Pursell 
(R-Mich.) by a surprisingly large margin of 98 to 64, declared the outcome a 
"disaster" for Gingrich and two of his close allies who tried to oust Lewis as 
chairman of the House Republican Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"Their purpose was not to help Carl Pursell but to dump Jerry Lewis," snapped 
Lewis, who said that Reps. Duncan L. Hunter (R-Coronado) and Vin Weber 
(R-Minn.) were "designated deputies" by Gingrich in the campaign against him. 
</P>
<P>
Another candidate backed by Gingrich in a hard-fought race -- Rep. Guy Vander 
Jagt (R-Mich.) -- decisively won his campaign for reelection as chairman of the 
National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee over Rep. Don Sundquist 
(R-Tenn.) by a vote of 98 to 66. 
</P>
<P>
The House GOP campaign fund-raising organization under Vander Jagt's direction 
was accused by Sundquist of making improper financial arrangements with 
consultants and polling organizations and getting unsatisfactory results. 
Vander Jagt promised to review the complaints and make changes, if warranted. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, who was reelected without opposition to his No. 2 position in the GOP 
hierarchy, insisted that the Lewis-Pursell contest was not a referendum on him 
or his followers. "I am for Jerry Lewis in some elections and against him in 
others," Gingrich said. "The conference voted for the established leadership." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast with the sharp infighting among Republicans, House Democrats 
reelected Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and their other leaders by 
acclamation as they organized for the 102nd Congress that will convene in 
January.

VERDICT BACKING POLICE STIRS PROTEST;

NARCOTICS: A MIAMI CRACK DEALER WAS FATALLY BEATEN. THE JURY HAD TO DECIDE IF 
THE OFFICERS CONSPIRED TO VIOLATE HIS CIVIL RIGHTS.

Fiery protests erupted in the streets at nightfall here Monday, hours after six 
undercover Miami drug squad officers were acquitted of federal charges that 
they conspired to violate the civil rights of a small-time crack dealer who was 
punched, kicked and beaten to death with a heavy flashlight almost two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
In a largely Puerto Rican neighborhood just blocks from the house where 
Leonardo Mercado died, several businesses were set afire and bands of young 
people threw rocks and bottles at patrolmen. Police initially withdrew from the 
area, just north of downtown, but around 9 p.m. the first of about 300 special 
riot police were sent in to reclaim the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities managed to bring the area under control by 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the delay in responding to the disturbance, Miami City Commissioner 
J. L. Plummer said: "We were not prepared for this." 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations of anger in the streets stood in sharp contrast to earlier 
jubilation on the part of the accused policemen and their relatives on the 
courthouse steps. 
</P>
<P>
One of the defendants called the verdict a vindication of the "war on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
"If it weren't a war on drugs, we wouldn't have been fighting Mercado," said 
Thomas Trujillo, 33. 
</P>
<P>
The jury was unable to reach a verdict on a second count, that the six men 
violated the civil rights of Mercado, a native of Puerto Rico and cafeteria 
owner well known to both neighbors and police. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Dexter Lehtinen told reporters that the civil rights charge was "the 
core of the indictment," and said he would decide by Jan. 17 whether to retry 
the officers on that charge. If convicted, they could have faced life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
A few friends and relatives of Mercado were also present for the verdict. "They 
treated him like an animal!" his ex-wife, Maritza Soto, screamed as she ran out 
of the courthouse. "They killed him worse than an animal!" 
</P>
<P>
Mercado, 35, died Dec. 16, 1988, soon after the officers took him into a tiny 
apartment bedroom in a house in an inner-city neighborhood to question him 
about a death threat one of them had received just an hour earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Mercado suffered massive injuries, including a brain hemorrhage, broken ribs 
and internal bleeding. He had 44 areas of cuts and bruises on his body, 
according to the autopsy report, and an expert prosecution witness testified 
that he had been kicked so hard that footprints from the officers' shoes 
remained on his face long after he was dead. 
</P>
<P>
A biracial jury of 10 men and two women sat through six weeks of testimony and 
spent four days deliberating before giving up on the charges they couldn't 
decide. 
</P>
<P>
"We said from the beginning that we were innocent, and we proved it," said 
defendant Pablo Camacho. "Now I'm going fishing for about a week." 
</P>
<P>
Miami Police Chief Perry Anderson said the six men, who have been suspended 
with pay, would be welcomed back to their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Not even prosecutors had a kind word for the victim. Mercado was a drug dealer 
"with a despicable, reprehensible past," Assistant U.S. Atty. Dan Gelber said 
in his closing argument last week. But Gelber insisted that what the six burly 
men did to Mercado was a crime. "He was beaten to soup, folks," said Gelber. 
"He was gone in . . . minutes." 
</P>
<P>
The critical question for the jury was whether the officers had conspired to 
deprive Mercado of his civil rights and then carried out the plan. Camacho, the 
only defendant who testified, said there was no plan even to stop at the corner 
house where Mercado was known to hang out, but that the caravan of three 
unmarked cars pulled over after he noticed something suspicious. Camacho was 
never able to say what that something was. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contended that the six had planned to threaten Mercado. "They 
didn't intend to kill him," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Edward Nucci, "but 
something went wrong in that apartment." 
</P>
<P>
Within 20 minutes, Mercado was dead, a victim of what a police spokesman later 
said was "just a frenzy.' 
</P>
<P>
Camacho said it was Mercado who instigated the frenzy, by inexplicably lashing 
out at him with "supernatural" strength. "My life was hanging by a thread as 
far as I'm concerned," Camacho, 43, testified. A small amount of cocaine was 
found in Mercado's blood. 
</P>
<P>
Each officer was also charged with conspiracy and civil rights violations in 
connection with the arrest of brothers Pedro and Jose Soto, who considered 
Mercado their stepfather. All but officer Nathaniel Veal Jr. were acquitted of 
those charges. The jury could not decide on that charge against Veal. 
</P>
<P>
The Soto brothers, along with their mother, are plaintiffs in a $10-million 
civil suit against the police and the city of Miami. The defense cited their 
lawsuit as a way to attack their credibility. "They are witnesses you couldn't 
believe if their tongues were notarized," said Milton Hirsch, attorney for 
Camacho. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors acknowledged that undercover work can be tough and dirty. "But 
(police) also have a Constitution to abide by," Nucci said. "They are bound by 
rules. No matter how despicable you find Leonardo Mercado, he had a right not 
to be brutalized by the police. If not, why have courts? Just let the police 
administer their own brand of justice."

FLOAT BRINGS CALL FOR AUDIT OF RIDE-SHARING PROGRAM

Following disclosures that $100,000 is being invested in a parade float to 
promote ride-sharing, transportation officials ordered an internal audit Monday 
of the entire ride-sharing program to see if there were any more questionable 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Drago, a spokesman for the California Department of Transportation, 
confirmed that the audit of the $8.4-million program was requested by J. F. 
Maloney, the agency's chief deputy director, to determine "if all the money is 
being spent properly." 
</P>
<P>
"Any time the merits of any program are questioned, as a matter of routine we 
would go back and look at it," he said. "We want to know if the money is being 
spent as intended to promote ride-sharing." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans has been criticized by several legislators, including the chairmen of 
both the Senate and Assembly transportation committees, for a decision to spend 
$100,000 on a float for the Tournament of Roses Parade. The float, depicting 
magical characters, encourages motorists to do their part to help unclog 
highways by sharing rides. 
</P>
<P>
Drago said the state would continue with the float project. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans' $100,000 investment covers half the cost of the float. The rest is 
being met by other government agencies and private companies. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) called the $100,000 expenditure "ill-timed" 
because he said it gave the impression that Caltrans did not know how to spend 
additional gas tax money approved by the voters in June. By approving 
Proposition 111, voters endorsed a phased-in, 9-cents per gallon gasoline tax 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
"On Dec. 1, fuel taxes (increased) another 5 cents per gallon nationally, and 
on Jan. 1, 1991, the state fuel tax rate will increase another penny a gallon," 
Katz wrote to Caltrans. "The first and most visible use of those new revenues 
will be a parade float. That's not what the voters expected when they approved 
Proposition 111."

BORDER AREA TO GET 120 NEW CUSTOMS INSPECTORS

The U.S. Customs Service says it plans to place an additional 120 inspectors 
along the California-Mexico border, but authorities say little immediate relief 
is in sight to alleviate the frustrating traffic delays that plague the busy 
crossings. 
</P>
<P>
The new hires -- representing an increase of more than one-third of the 
inspection staff here -- are not expected to be posted to the border area until 
almost next spring, customs officials said, after the busy holiday season that 
usually brings some of the biggest traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
The congestion in the lanes of traffic leading to San Diego, Calexico and other 
U.S. border cities is a major irritant for travelers and businesses on both 
sides of the border.

HERE'S WHERE L.A. COUNTY'S MENTAL HEALTH FUNDS GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health's $256-million budget for 
fiscal 1990-91 was designed to support a complex network of services for the 
mentally ill, including 24 county-run outpatient clinics and 42 private, 
nonprofit clinics running programs under contract to the department. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the department provides funding to psychiatric units at four 
county hospitals, maintains residential programs for abused children or other 
special groups, and has rights to 1,080 beds in the state mental hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
When the budget was adopted in August, the county Board of Supervisors was 
gambling on receiving millions of dollars of revenue from the passage of the 
Proposition 134 liquor tax on the Nov. 6 ballot. But Proposition 134 was 
defeated, leaving county mental health officials with the task of slashing 
$41.9 million in programs. 
</P>
<P>
Unless alternative funding is found, the department plans to close 19 
county-run clinics and cancel numerous program contracts that will cause an 
estimated 14 of the 42 private clinics to close and greatly reduce services at 
others. About 27,000 patients of 58,000 currently treated at the clinics will 
be cut off from care, mental health officials estimate.

Simone Cousteau, an accomplished underwater diver who accompanied her husband, 
Jacques Yves Cousteau, on hundreds of voyages aboard the marine research ship 
Calypso, has died at her home in Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
The Cousteau Foundation said Monday that she was 72 when she died Sunday of 
undisclosed causes. 
</P>
<P>
Married in 1937, the Cousteaus for years spent most of their time aboard the 
Calypso, sailing throughout the world to study marine biology, conduct 
underwater explorations, make films and promote conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Known by the Calypso's crew as "the shepherdess," Mrs. Cousteau served as nurse 
and purser while also participating in underwater missions. 
</P>
<P>
She was one of the first women to dive using an autonomous underwater helmet 
and believed to be the first to live in an underwater house when she spent a 
week in 1963 with her husband and four assistants 33 feet beneath the surface 
of the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Jean-Michel. A second son, 
Philippe, died in a plane crash in 1981.

SUPERVISORS TO WEIGH PLAN TO SMOKE OUT POLLUTING VEHICLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County residents would be able to report smoke-belching cars, trucks or 
buses on a new toll-free hot line, under a program to be considered by county 
supervisors today. 
</P>
<P>
Also, under the proposed Smoking Vehicle Program -- to be operational this 
spring -- a California Highway Patrol officer would be hired and placed under 
contract to the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District to search area 
roads for mobile polluters and ticket offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Multiple offenses would bring fines of up to $250 for automobile drivers and up 
to $5,000 for commercial truck drivers, said Richard H. Baldwin, Ventura County 
Air Pollution Control officer. 
</P>
<P>
The Smoking Vehicle Program is part of a county anti-pollution plan that 
Baldwin said he will present to the supervisors today. 
</P>
<P>
The program is one of 12 facets of the anti-pollution plan that Baldwin 
proposes to create or augment with $950,000 in new county revenue due this year 
from a motor vehicle registration fee increase. The increase, authorized by 
state legislation signed Sept. 30, allows the county to add $2 to the 
Department of Motor Vehicle registration fees of an estimated 500,000 vehicle 
owners in Ventura County. The legislation also permits counties to double the 
increase to $4 in subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
"Motor vehicles cause half the county's ozone pollution," Baldwin said. "It's 
time that the drivers of these motor vehicles begin to pay to help solve the 
problems they cause." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Susan Lacey, who has pushed for measures to improve the county's 
air, said the new fees are a reasonable means to pay for cleaner air. 
</P>
<P>
"I've wanted smog cops for a long time," she said. "Maybe now we can get people 
to follow the law." 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin said he has requested (800) NO-SMOKE as the hot line phone number for 
the Smoking Vehicle Program, but he hasn't yet received phone company approval. 
The district expects to receive about 350 calls each month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the proposal is approved, the Air Pollution Control District would add 10 
new employees to its existing 54-member staff. 
</P>
<P>
Until the legislation was approved, Baldwin said, "the California Clean Air Act 
mandated that we establish a lot of new programs and meet emission-reduction 
goals, but it didn't give us the resources to do the work." 
</P>
<P>
The district proposal also includes provisions to: 
</P>
<P>
* Help the county, cities and school districts develop programs to begin using 
automobiles that are powered by methanol or compressed natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
* Enhance the air pollution control district's public education program. 
</P>
<P>
* Expand an existing regulation that requires large employers to provide 
incentives to employees to share rides or reduce their use of automobiles to 
get to work. 
</P>
<P>
* Improve the district's ability to forecast violations of the federal and 
state health standards. 
</P>
<P>
* Help the Ventura County Transportation Commission to develop a traffic model 
to show how future development would affect traffic and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County's air pollution district has the ninth worst ozone air pollution 
in the nation according to the most recent reports, Baldwin said. The South 
Coast Air Quality Management District -- which includes Los Angeles, San 
Bernardino, Orange and Riverside counties -- has the smoggiest air in the state 
and nation. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County ties with Fresno and Kern counties for third worst in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone pollution is formed when emissions from motor vehicles and industry mix 
together and cook in sunlight.

JUDGE CITES DEFENDANT'S HANDLING OF OWN CASE IN DENYING HE IS UNFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

David Michael Murray opened his defense on 12 counts of fraud Monday by asking 
Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kenneth R. Yegan to declare him mentally 
incompetent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
Yegan denied the motion. 
</P>
<P>
"After having observed you throughout this trial, it's clear to me that you 
certainly are competent to stand trial and to act as your own attorney," Yegan 
said. "You are doing as good a job as any lawyer, with some exceptions in some 
cases where you don't have the code sections down." 
</P>
<P>
Then the judge smiled slightly, as he has frequently while watching Murray 
manage his own defense. 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Murray is accused of defrauding Ventura County business people 
of goods and services, including hotel rooms, clothing, a bicycle and a 
blood-coagulant medicine to treat his hemophilia. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say Murray was arrested while posing at Nordhoff High School in 
Ojai as Shi Stone, the 17-year-old son of an Air Force colonel wounded in the 
Panama invasion. 
</P>
<P>
During his opening statement, Murray said that the facts could be interpreted 
several ways and that several people could be responsible for the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Acting as his own lawyer, Murray began questioning defense witnesses Monday 
with the same articulate, if hesitant, confidence that he showed while 
cross-examining prosecution witnesses during the first five days of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Murray often objected during cross-examination by Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles R. 
Roberts Sr., and Yegan frequently upheld the objections on grounds that 
witnesses were testifying to more than they were asked or that Roberts' 
questions were improper. 
</P>
<P>
Yegan also sustained objections by Roberts about Murray's vague or improper 
questions. For instance, Murray asked a re-called prosecution witness, "Did 
anything occur to you after you left the stand the first time that you felt 
like you should have mentioned?" 
</P>
<P>
Murray has also offered his own probation report as evidence, even though it 
describes a 1980 fraud arrest that charged him with defrauding Carol Moynahan 
of $3,000 and a new Mustang while posing as Steven Randall Stringer, an Exxon 
oil surveyor afflicted with leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Murray proceeded gamely, always addressing Yegan as "your honor" and 
occasionally passing notes to his private investigator, Russell Noragon, on a 
yellow pad covered with notes, stick figures and cartoon speech balloons. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to himself in the third person, Murray retraced the week in January, 
1990, when Moynahan testified that he showed up outside her trailer at Hobson 
Park on the Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
He then asked if she'd ever known him to use the alias Michael Myers, and if 
she knew that it was the name of the killer in the movie "Halloween." 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen 'Halloween,' " Moynahan testified. 
</P>
<P>
Murray then played a taped interview between investigators and Moynahan, who 
could be heard saying she saw Murray in court in 1987 under the name Michael 
Myers. Moynahan's taped voice said she believed that she'd heard the name in 
discussion about a Simi Valley policeman, "or in 'Halloween,' the horror movie. 
His name was also Myers." 
</P>
<P>
On hearing the contradiction, Moynahan looked at Murray from the witness stand 
with a bemused smile and shook her head. He showed no emotion and continued the 
questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Closing arguments are scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. today.

HIGH COURT BACKS RULING AGAINST PLAY BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ruling in a San Diego case sparked by a racially charged play, the U.S. Supreme 
Court on Monday let stand a decision that college officials do not have the 
authority to censor plays to be performed on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving intact a California court ruling, the Supreme Court refused to hear an 
appeal by San Diego Community College District officials who contended that 
they, not instructors or students, have final control over plays, publications 
and other "expressive activities" on campus. 
</P>
<P>
The court's refusal to hear the case suggests that college administrators do 
not have the same broad powers the justices granted high school officials -- in 
a case decided two years ago -- to limit freedom of speech in school-sponsored 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
The high court's action Monday also signaled a victory not only for the college 
instructor and student who brought the suit, but for anyone with an interest in 
freedom of speech, said an ACLU lawyer who helped bring the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the principle involved -- that First Amendment issues were at the 
heart of what happened -- has been established and, more importantly, that a 
very resounding defense of the First Amendment for college students, and 
academic freedom for college instructors, has been affirmed," ACLU attorney 
Betty Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
The case arose in 1986 when Alan DiBona, then a San Diego community college 
instructor, chose the play "Split Second" for his drama students to perform. 
The plot revolves around the shooting of a white suspect by a black policeman 
in New York City and the racial tensions that result. 
</P>
<P>
DiBona, who now lives in Seattle, planned to have the play performed at the 
Educational Cultural Complex in Southeast San Diego, a branch of the community 
colleges. Students auditioning for the play were to receive course credit. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, racial tensions in San Diego were high over the case of Sagon 
Penn, a young black man who was twice acquitted in the shooting of two white 
San Diego police officers and a Latino woman who was riding in the officers' 
squad car. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing of the play, several local ministers complained to Robert 
Matthews, who was then president of the Education Cultural Complex. Matthews 
now heads another college branch, the Continuing Education Centers. 
</P>
<P>
After examining the play, Matthews concluded that its language was 
"inappropriate" and its plot "not very uplifting." Then, saying the class 
lacked adequate enrollment, he ordered DiBona to cancel the production. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even think the First Amendment should have been an issue there," 
Matthews said Monday. "The issue as I'm looking at it was simply the procedures 
of the school. We had the right to close the class if we didn't have the 
numbers necessary to keep class in operation. There was never any class, as far 
as we're concerned." 
</P>
<P>
DiBona and one of his students, Scott Gundlach, filed the lawsuit against 
Matthews and James Hardison, then the dean of arts and sciences, contending 
that they had violated the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech. 
Hardison is now dean of another college branch, the Midway Center. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, San Diego Superior Court Judge Arthur Jones ruled for the college 
administrators, saying DiBona and Gundlach did not have legal standing to bring 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
But last May, the 4th District Court of Appeal, on a 2-1 vote, reversed that 
decision and revived the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court said it was aware of "no authority which would allow a 
college or university to censor" class materials selected by the instructor 
"because they contain 'indecent' language or deal with 'offensive' topics." 
</P>
<P>
Community college students, many of whom are adults, have full First Amendments 
rights, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
The college appealed, relying on the 1988 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that 
granted a high school principal, not the student editors, final control over 
what appears in the school newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The First Amendment rights of high school students are not the same as those of 
adults, the U.S. Supreme Court said in that decision, adding that school 
officials legally control the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the San Diego Community College District said the logic of that 
decision should apply also to colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
On July 25, the California Supreme Court refused to hear the college's appeal, 
and, on Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court did the same. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler, the ACLU attorney, said the Supreme Court action could bring about the 
end of the case because DiBona and Gundlach "have, to a large extent, achieved 
what they set out to achieve," which was an affirmation of their constitutional 
rights. Neither the instructor nor the student sought monetary damages, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 4th District Court's opinion, which still stands, the college retains 
the right to go to trial on the case. But Matthews said he had no burning 
desire for a trial. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing I want to happen," he said. The case "can continue on if 
others so desire, or it can stop where it is if others so desire. I don't care 
at this particular point." 
</P>
<P>
Donal M. Hill, the deputy county counsel who handled the case for the college, 
could not be reached Monday for comment. Neither could DiBona nor Gundlach.

SCHOOL WORKSHOP HELPS IMMIGRANTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Assembled in a circle, a group of students enthusiastically performed "The 
Hokey Pokey" in a crowded cafeteria last week. This would not be an unusual 
activity for kindergartners, but these were high school freshmen and the 
teachers were only a year or two older than their pupils. 
</P>
<P>
Ten young Latinos -- new members of a group called Future Leaders of America -- 
joined 70 new migrant students from Oxnard Unified School District at Camp 
Sholom in Malibu for a three-day workshop held under FLA auspices. 
</P>
<P>
Used as a warm-up for a full day of lectures, discussion groups and confidence 
builders, the Hokey Pokey circle helped the immigrants drop their reserve. They 
also learned some English. 
</P>
<P>
Founder Gilbert Cuevas, who designs and runs program workshops, said the 
Ventura County-based Future Leaders organization has helped 2,000 students in 
six California counties get started on the right track. Dedicated to boosting 
Latino achievement in school and community activities since 1980, FLA has seen 
about 30% of those enrolled become involved in student government, Cuevas said. 
Many have gone on to college. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing pleases Cuevas more than seeing some of his program graduates 
return to help run future camps as peer counselors. 
</P>
<P>
Among the leaders was Veronica de la Cruz, a 16-year-old junior at Hueneme High 
School. Drum major for a 45-pice marching band, de la Cruz had a 4.5 
grade-point average in honors classes last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Her sophomore year was a different story. De la Cruz declined to say just how 
low her grades fell last year, but she admitted that pulling them up to Cs was 
"a major improvement." Attending FLA camp last summer has made a difference. 
"They really helped me pick myself up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her desire to give others a hand was obvious as she tackled the day. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the migrant workshop revolved around pitfalls to avoid in adjusting to 
a new culture, where women play more assertive roles and gangs await those who 
lose touch with their families. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's agenda included a skit by the young counselors on stereotypes to avoid 
-- the clown, the angry cholo, the loner, the sex bomb. The students 
alternately giggled, looked solemn or cast sidelong glances at their neighbors, 
recognizing themselves or fellow students in the caricatures. 
</P>
<P>
"It works," Cuevas said, "because these are not adults talking at them. When 
the message comes from their peers, it touches them." 
</P>
<P>
The process also touches the young leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"I never expected anybody to look up to me," de la Cruz said. "But it means a 
lot, from these kids. They really say it from the heart." JANET BERGAMO

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFFICIALS ORDER 'ABYSMAL' KENNEL TO CLOSED 
DOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Humane society officials have ordered the closure of what they called an 
"abysmal" kennel at a Gardena house, where 10 dogs and a cat recently died in a 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
Officials found pools of urine and feces collected at Fantasy Kennels on La 
Salle Avenue and "declared the property uninhabitable for animals," said Sgt. 
Cori Whetstone of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 
</P>
<P>
The SPCA gave Kathy Schaefer and Sylvia Kelley, who live next to the kennel, 
one week to remove several dozen purebred terriers, Shih Tzus and Lhasa apsos, 
Whetstone said. No charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
About 21 dogs were transported to the SPCA shelter in Hawthorne and will be 
available to the public later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Both women were involved in a 1988 investigation of violations of state humane 
laws at a North Hollywood kennel. Kelley paid $2,700 in fines and was put on 
three years' probation.

MISTRIAL DECLARED IN TEEN'S MURDER CASE

<P>
A Ventura County Superior Court judge declared a mistrial Monday after jurors 
failed to reach a verdict in the murder case of a 17-year-old immigrant accused 
of stabbing a Thousand Oaks nurseryman last spring. 
</P>
<P>
After deliberating for 12 hours over three days, the jury found Jose Luis 
Navarro, 17, not guilty of first-degree murder in the slaying of Jose Narvaez, 
49, who died of deep stab wounds on April 19 in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
But the jurors deadlocked 7 to 5 in favor of acquittal on a charge of 
second-degree murder, and Judge Charles R. McGrath declared a mistrial, which 
could mean that Navarro will be re-tried, Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard E. Holmes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing is set for Monday to schedule further proceedings, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro testified that he had sodomized Narvaez that night. But he told jurors 
that he stabbed Narvaez in self-defense when Narvaez tried forcibly to sodomize 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Narvaez was stabbed once in the stomach and three times in the back with a 9 
1/2-inch butcher knife. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes declined to disclose details of what jurors told him about their failure 
to reach a unanimous verdict. But he said the jury "had problems with the case" 
in determining whether Navarro killed Narvaez in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro is being held at the Ventura County Juvenile Hall in lieu of $250,000 
bail. MACK REED

A memorial Mass will be said today for Joanne Dempsey, professor of English at 
the University of San Diego, who died of heart failure Thursday at her Mission 
Hills home. She was 44. 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Dempsey joined the USD faculty to teach English Renaissance literature in 
1980, a year before she was awarded her doctorate in English from Harvard 
University. 
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, she represented this university at its best -- a person of 
character, faith and intelligence," said Patrick Drinan, dean of USD's College 
of Arts and Sciences. "Dr. Dempsey was a Renaissance scholar and was held in 
deep affection by her students and colleagues." 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Dempsey, a native of Mineola, N.Y., attended Newton College of the Sacred 
Heart in Massachusetts, where she won a two-year scholarship to Sophia 
University in Tokyo to study Western culture. Ms. Dempsey, who was fluent in 
four languages, also studied at the British Museum and Warburg Institute in 
London and at the American Academy in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Dempsey was devoted to the arts and was a patron of the Old Globe Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by her parents, retired Judge and Mrs. William J. Dempsey Sr. 
of Mineola, and a brother, William J. Dempsey Jr., who is with the district 
attorney's office in Nassau County, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The Mass will begin at 11:15 a.m. at USD Founders Chapel.

ABUSE CENTER GETS BADLY NEEDED FUNDS

A residential treatment center in Ventura for women recovering from alcohol and 
substance abuse received $6,000 from an anonymous donor Monday, allowing it to 
continue operations until the new year, said Mary Beth Martin, executive 
director of Miracle House. 
</P>
<P>
Miracle House operates three facilities for women in various stages of recovery 
in Oxnard and Ventura, including a financially troubled six-patient residence 
in Ventura that was started in April with federal and county funding and the 
expectation that two of the women who would be admitted would have insurance 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
But financial problems developed because the Ventura intake center has not had 
one insured patient and the federal grant has ended, Martin said. She said that 
despite the $6,000 donation, the future of the center is uncertain and another 
facility in Oxnard could also be closed. 
</P>
<P>
In the last week, financial problems have forced Martin to reduce the paid 
staff at the residential facilities in Ventura and Oxnard from eight to five, 
with the rest taking pay cuts. The residential center in Ventura still needs 
$30,000 to make it through June, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin has been marketing the center to medical groups and insurance companies, 
two of which -- Blue Shield and Aetna -- have signed it on as a provider. Costs 
for insured patients would be $4,500 a month contrasted with the $18,000 to 
$30,000 for a month spent in some hospital programs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The residential treatment center in Ventura is the first segment of a 90-day 
recovery program sponsored by Miracle House. At the center, at 152 N. Dos 
Caminos Ave., women participate in a month of workshops in drug and alcohol 
education, therapy and recovery. 
</P>
<P>
This is followed by 60 days in the Oxnard residential recovery home, where 
patients undergo vocational training, including the more practical skills of 
how to dress for a job and fill out applications. Miracle House also has a 
nearly self-supporting co-op home in Ventura, which houses women who have gone 
through the early stages of recovery and who have enough income to pay rent. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said about 200 women have gone through Miracle House. In addition to 
county funds, the program is funded by federal grants, private donations from 
health care foundations and fund-raisers. VIVIAN LOUIE

3 HELD IN PROBE OF DRUG NETWORK; 
</P>
<P>
NARCOTICS: THE 2 MEN AND A WOMAN ARE TO BE CHARGED WITH CONSPIRACY TO SELL 
MARIJUANA. DEPUTIES SAY ONE MAN WAS A MAJOR DEALER IN THE VALLEY.

Sheriff's narcotics investigators pursuing the trail of marijuana grown in 
sophisticated underground farms in the Antelope Valley and Arizona have 
arrested a San Fernando Valley drug distributor linked to the network, 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Kumar, 31, allegedly sold more than $1 million worth of marijuana a 
year supplied by the operators of the Antelope Valley and Arizona farms, 14 of 
whom were indicted by a federal grand jury in Phoenix last week, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Stephen L. Cooley said. 
</P>
<P>
Kumar, who will be charged today by county prosecutors with conspiracy to sell 
marijuana and possession of marijuana for sale, was arrested Friday night at a 
Castaic motel after attempting to buy 30 pounds of marijuana in a fake drug 
deal set up by investigators, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's investigators have "taken a major dealer off the street," Cooley 
said. "He appeared to be operating in the seven figures on an annual basis." 
</P>
<P>
Deputies also arrested Gabriel Alfred, 29, of South Los Angeles and Elizabeth 
Haskell, 26, who was described as Kumar's girlfriend. Alfred and Haskell will 
be charged with conspiracy to sell marijuana, Cooley said. 
</P>
<P>
All three were being held at the Antelope Valley sheriff's station on $1 
million bail each, with arraignments expected today. No lawyers could be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests bring to 19 the number of people named in a continuing 
investigation into the high-tech farms and their alleged operators, a group of 
construction contractors investigators say produced millions of dollars worth 
of marijuana sold in California and other states. Sheriff's deputies identified 
Kumar last week as a high-volume distributor, placed him under surveillance and 
set up the phony sale, said Capt. Larry Waldie, commander of the sheriff's 
narcotics bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"We arranged the sale of 30 pounds through an informant," Waldie said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kumar was apprehensive because of the well-publicized series of raids 
and arrests over the past month, he agreed to buy the marijuana for $105,000 at 
the Castaic motel, authorities said. He was arrested about 6 p.m. by deputies, 
who then arrested Alfred and Haskell at a nearby restaurant and found the money 
in a bag in Alfred's car, Waldie said. Alfred was going to deliver the money to 
Kumar to make the payment when the deal was concluded, Waldie said. 
</P>
<P>
Kumar appears to have sold marijuana to lower-level dealers in the San Fernando 
Valley, and investigators are trying to determine whether he also operated 
elsewhere, Cooley said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities gave few details on how Kumar was supplied by the desert farms 
allegedly financed and overseen by Lancaster contractor Frank Gegax, who 
pleaded not guilty Friday to federal charges of possession of and conspiracy to 
distribute marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Kumar may have dealt with the Gegax network through an intermediary, Cooley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He and Gegax may not have known each other," Cooley said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies confiscated two vintage 1950s Cadillacs at Kumar's Woodland Hills 
house and found about $50,000 worth of marijuana in one of the cars, 
authorities said. Prosecutors plan to initiate proceedings to confiscate the 
cars and the house, worth $200,000 to $400,000, Cooley said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the federal indictments against 14 men and the expected local 
charges against Kumar and his two alleged accomplices, two contractors have 
been charged in San Bernardino County in connection with a suspected indoor 
farm under construction near Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
Federal and local authorities are continuing the investigation, which so far 
has turned up four high-tech farms, two more alleged farms under construction 
and $77 million worth of marijuana plants.

Spoiled chicken is being blamed for a case of mass food poisoning that may be 
responsible for the death of one man, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those affected work at border-area factories, known as maquiladoras, on 
Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Mexican Institute of Social Security, the first wave of people 
with food poisoning -- about 30 -- arrived at Clinic No. 20 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Among those first treated was assembly worker Rosario Garcia Montoya, 26. Jaime 
Miranda y Soto, an institute spokesman, said Garcia later died from what may 
have been food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
"We will conduct an autopsy to determine the exact cause of death," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baja California authorities said a food-catering business, Cocinas 
Industriales, which feeds many of the maquiladora workers on Otay Mesa, may 
have served spoiled chicken. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at Samsung Mexicana, one of the assembly plants, said several 
workers at the plant started experiencing stomach aches and dizziness Saturday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Other plants in the area also began reporting similar cases, said the 
spokesman, who identified himself as the plant's manager but declined to give 
his name. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda y Soto said Cocinas Industriales has been shut down while Baja 
California district attorney's officials investigate. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Manuel Vazquez, assistant state attorney general, said as many as 140 
people may have been affected.

LEWIS RETAINS 1 KEY POST, THEN LOSES 1;

<P>
POLITICS: HOUSE COLLEAGUES NAME THE LAWMAKER GOP CONFERENCE CHAIRMAN. BUT HE IS 
DROPPED FROM AN ASSIGNMENTS COMMITTEE.

<P>
Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Highland) was reelected Monday as third-ranking House 
Republican leader, but suffered an embarrassing setback hours later when the 
California GOP delegation narrowly ousted him from another coveted post. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' topsy-turvy day began with a strong show of support from Republican 
colleagues nationwide. They voted 98 to 64 to grant him a second term as GOP 
conference chairman. He turned back Rep. Carl D. Pursell (R-Mich.), who had 
criticized Lewis for supporting a White House-endorsed budget package in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, however, Lewis was narrowly rejected by California 
Republicans in his attempt to remain the California representative on the House 
Committee on Committees, which handles the sensitive task of assigning GOP 
members to various policy panels. Lewis was defeated by Rep. Ron Packard 
(R-Carlsbad) for the post he had held since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-8 vote was part of a broad victory by state GOP conservatives, led by 
Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) and the rest of the Orange County 
delegation, to fill the dozen or so positions as officers of the delegation and 
representatives to other House and Republican Party committees. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer, Packard and others maintained that the jobs had been held for too 
long by too few and should be rotated. GOP moderates, including Lewis and Rep. 
William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield), said the split had more to do with ideology 
and personality. 
</P>
<P>
"It just didn't occur to them that the slaves would rise up," one Orange County 
lawmaker said. "They have always thought of us as the Three Stooges." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, whose 35th District includes half of Palmdale, was undone by the 
11th-hour switch of key votes, said a congressional ally who requested 
anonymity. The lawmaker said Reps. David Dreier (R-La Verne) and Wally Herger 
(R-Rio Oso) -- who Lewis believed were committed to him -- told him shortly 
before the vote that they would support Packard. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, whose 20th District includes Lancaster, was also among those replaced. 
He was succeeded by Dreier, whose 33rd District includes Pearblossom, 
Littlerock and a sliver of Palmdale, as the delegation's chief representative 
on the National Republican Congressional Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas reportedly also was unsuccessful in attempts to win positions as liaison 
to the state Republican Party and chairman of the reapportionment committee. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) was reelected dean of the delegation, a 
post that generally goes to the member who has served the longest. Moorhead, 
68, recently won his 10th congressional term. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis and Thomas both sought to downplay the significance of the delegation's 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
"I have other things to do," Lewis said shortly after leaving the nearly 
two-hour session in Moorhead's Rayburn Building office. "I did not make an 
impassioned plea." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said the NRCC position, which he held for six years, required "a lot of 
time and energy. . . . It wasn't worth it -- not with all the other things I'm 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said he had been assured by Rep. Guy Vander Jagt (R-Mich.), who was 
reelected NRCC chairman Monday, that he would continue to play an important 
role in redistricting. Thomas had been NRCC vice chairman for redistricting.

SOKA WILL CONSIDER LAND TRADE; 
</P>
<P>
PARKLAND: GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO WANT THE CALABASAS CAMPUS ARE SKEPTICAL THAT 
THEY CAN MEET THE UNIVERSITY'S STRINGENT CRITERIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Expansion-minded officials of a Japanese university's campus in Calabasas 
reluctantly agreed during a meeting with state and federal parks officials 
Monday to consider trading their 580 acres for land elsewhere to free the 
campus for park use. 
</P>
<P>
However, the criteria that Soka University administrators set for an acceptable 
alternative parcel exactly described the existing university site, leaving 
parks officials skeptical that they could find a site that would not bring with 
it the same conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are other suitable properties for the university," said Joseph 
T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, who 
attended the afternoon meeting. "But if we find something that meets all the 
criteria that makes Soka's land so important both for them and for us, then it 
would be an equally important and beautiful park site." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter delivered to park agencies Monday morning, Soka University General 
Director Hiroshi Okayasu said that although he personally is opposed to the 
idea of a land swap, the university's board of directors agreed to consider it. 
Okayasu also agreed to wait until April 15 to file an environmental impact 
report for the Calabasas land, the first step toward its development. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy and the National Park Service had demanded last month that Soka 
administrators specify their requirements for a campus so parks officials could 
find another location acceptable to the university. 
</P>
<P>
Soka University, which has its main campus in Tokyo, moved onto the grounds of 
a former Calabasas mansion and monastery in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, university administrators announced plans to grow from an 
80-student language program to a 5,000-student liberal arts college over the 
next 25 years. In August, they disclosed that they had doubled their land 
holdings, bringing their total expenditure to an estimated $56 million. 
</P>
<P>
The National Park Service has long coveted the university's verdant valley for 
use as a park headquarters, nature center and trail head for the Santa Monica 
Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting Monday, Okayasu suggested that a park headquarters and a 
university could coexist on the land. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that's the best option, we really do," said Jeff Ourvan, the campus's 
community relations manager. "It serves not only the parks and the university 
but the public too." 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston said the park agencies will thoroughly review the proposal before the 
Jan. 15 deadline set by the university, but he remained skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Okayasu said his personal view was that this land swap would not really 
work out," Edmiston said. "Well, my personal view is that a park headquarters 
and a 5,000-student university would not necessarily be compatible. But to the 
extent that both of us can look toward compromises, we will." 
</P>
<P>
The criteria outlined by the university administrators for exchange sites, 
included in Okayasu's letter and discussed at the meeting, outlined a detailed 
description of the Calabasas site. 
</P>
<P>
The letter said any alternatives must be of comparable size, location and 
aesthetics. It said the land must be suitable for all legal federal, state and 
local government permits required for building a university. It said it must be 
in "the greater Los Angeles area and be deliverable to Soka University in a 
timely manner, free of any and all encumbrances." 
</P>
<P>
"Although we realize that no two properties are exactly alike, we would like to 
make it clear that any significant deviation from these parameters may be cause 
for our rejecting any proposed exchange sites," Okayasu wrote.

BURBANK AIRPORT OKS PLAN FOR VALET PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burbank Airport officials on Monday approved a 90-day test of valet parking at 
the airport, saying they hope that it will increase patronage while reducing 
congestion in the drop-off area outside the terminals and in the crowded 
short-term parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority unanimously approved the plan, 
under which airport visitors can have their cars parked for a minimum of $6. 
</P>
<P>
Those who valet park for more than three hours will pay the 24-hour rate of 
$18, the same fee paid by those who self-park in the airport's short-term lot, 
which is closest to the two terminals. 
</P>
<P>
Parking attendants will place the cars in a nearby long-term lot, which charges 
a $10-per-day fee for self-parked cars and generally fills up after the 
short-term lot is filled, officials say. Officials expect the parking plan to 
begin by Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our hope that this will free up some space in our short-term lot," said 
Elly Mixsell, airport spokeswoman, "because that is always the first lot to 
fill up." 
</P>
<P>
Officials also said they hope that those picking up or dropping off people at 
the airport will use the valet service rather than circling until they find 
curb space outside the terminals. 
</P>
<P>
"This is also part of our long-range effort to convince the flying public that 
this is a convenient airport that is easy to use," Mixsell said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the fee to be paid to Valet Parking Service for operating the service 
is being negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is not necessarily to make money with this program," she said. "If if 
breaks even, we'll be happy. What we want to do is to make the airport work 
better."

REGIONAL EARNINGS: HOUSE OF FABRICS REPORTS 5% GAIN IN PROFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
House of Fabrics, the Sherman Oaks-based home sewing and crafts chain, reported 
a 5% increase in earnings for the three months that ended Oct. 31, to $4.52 
million from $4.30 million over the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Third-quarter sales rose 13% to $104.4 million, up from $92.5 million last 
year, the company reported. 
</P>
<P>
Gary L. Larkins, the company's president and chief executive officer, 
attributed the increase in part to the addition of larger stores with expanded 
inventories. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings for the nine months that ended Oct. 31 rose 33% to $7.36 million from 
$5.52 million in the same period a year earlier. Sales rose 10% to $278.1 
million from $253.3 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
The company operates 613 stores, and anticipates opening 10 additional stores 
and closing 18 before the end of the fiscal year, Larkins said.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: FORTUNE PETROLEUM PROFIT IS $88,000 IN 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fortune Petroleum Corp., reaping the benefits of the surge in oil prices, said 
its third-quarter profit jumped to $88,000 from $4,000 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune, a small energy concern based in Agoura Hills, said its revenue in the 
quarter that ended Sept. 30 climbed to $342,000 from $230,000. That's because 
the average price Fortune received for its oil in the latest quarter was $21.62 
a barrel, up from $13.80 a barrel in the second quarter. Oil prices rose 
sharply after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Fortune reported a $41,000 loss for the first nine months of this 
year on revenue of $793,000. A year earlier, it lost $36,000 on revenue of 
$734,000.

PICTURE DARKENS FOR IMAGING COMPANY IN SALES SLUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Image Industries started with a bang. The company first sold stock to the 
public in August, 1989, and within a few months, investors had bid the shares 
up from $6.50 to more than $15. In December, one analyst even predicted that 
the company's profits would grow 50% to 100% a year for the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
New Image, based in Canoga Park, makes computer systems that generate before 
and after video images, showing hair stylists, for instance, the effect of a 
new coif on a customer. These days, New Image executives know what it's like to 
see their company's financial picture suffer through a before and after 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, New Image's sales to beauty parlors -- a big market for the 
company -- slowed precipitously, and a deal to sell a large number of the 
systems to a diet-center chain fell through. As a result, New Image lost 
$956,000 in its latest quarter, contrasted with a $229,000 profit a year 
earlier, and sales tumbled 18%. Meanwhile, its stock closed Monday at $1.88 per 
share. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to its woes, the company and four of its top officers last week were 
slapped with a class-action suit filed by a shareholder who claimed that the 
executives had issued misleading statements to jack up the company's stock 
price. The suit also claimed that some New Image officers sold a combined 
100,000 shares of the stock at a premium in March, knowing that the company was 
having financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
New Image, saying it had not seen the suit, declined to comment. New Image also 
did not return calls seeking comment on other aspects of its performance. 
</P>
<P>
There is more than one shareholder who has been stung by New Image's 
performance. Hathaway &amp; Associates, a Rowayton, Conn., money management 
firm and the largest institutional shareholder in New Image, has taken a paper 
loss of about $1.4 million on shares that it bought for an average price of 
about $10. 
</P>
<P>
"New Image looked like it had a product with demonstrated value," said Carl E. 
Hathaway, president of the Connecticut firm, recollecting when it bought the 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
One of New Image's biggest problems is that its sales to beauty salons seem to 
have fallen off a cliff. New Image does have other markets, but beauty salons 
were the company's bread and butter. Sales of the "New Image Salon System" fell 
more than 50% to about $425,000 in the latest quarter from a year earlier. That 
may be because big beauty parlors with enough money to spend on the pricey 
computer systems (the original model sells for more than $23,000) have already 
bought them. Smaller beauty parlors may not have the money to buy the machines. 
</P>
<P>
New Image did make up for some of the lost beauty parlor sales with new devices 
sold to dentists and oral surgeons, so total revenues did not fall as badly as 
sales to beauticians. Then, in September, the company introduced a newer, 
cheaper model of the system that sells for about $10,000. But it's too soon to 
know if the machine can resuscitate New Image's sales. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps a bigger disappointment for New Image came when Nutri/System, a diet 
center chain, decided not to go ahead with plans to use New Image systems to 
show customers how they might look after losing a few pounds. New Image never 
released predictions of how large its sales to Nutri/System might have been. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the poor sales, New Image closed its three regional sales offices 
and cut its work force by about 29% to 78 on Oct. 8 from 110 on June 30. 
Meanwhile, the company has announced plans to begin selling this month a new 
system for beauty parlors that can be operated more simply by customers. 
</P>
<P>
And New Image said it struck a deal with Akzo Corp., a Dutch conglomerate whose 
products include paint, under which New Image will get $75,000 to develop 
software that would allow Akzo customers to see how their businesses or houses 
would look with different paint colors. If Akzo decides to market the product, 
the deal would lead to more sales. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the cost cutting and the new products, in September New Image 
predicted that it would show a profit in its December quarter. But in a 
statement last month, the company seemed to back away from that position. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Image Industries At A Glance 
</P>
<P>
New Image Industries makes computer systems that help beauticians, architects 
and other designers simulate before and after pictures for use in selling their 
products and services. The Canoga Park company, which first sold its stock to 
the public in August, 1989, has 78 employees.

17 REGIONAL STOCKS BUCK BEAR MARKET; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: TAKEOVERS AND FISCAL TURNAROUNDS BUOYED SOME FIRMS. THE BIGGEST GAINER 
THIS YEAR IS AN OBSCURE OIL COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's been a tough year on Wall Street, but some San Fernando Valley area 
companies have bucked the bear market. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
has tumbled 7% since the beginning of the year, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 
Composite Index of 500 Index is down 21%, 17 local stocks have increased in 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these stalwart stocks are shares in companies with a special market 
that seems untouched -- or even helped -- by economic troubles. One example is 
Amgen, a Thousand Oaks biotechnology company that makes a drug too essential 
for patients to stop taking when times are tough. And financial turnarounds at 
companies such as disk-drive maker Micropolis, and takeovers at companies such 
as entertainment giant MCA Inc., helped keep stocks up too. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 50 public companies with headquarters in the region stretching from 
Glendale to Oxnard, 17, or 34%, saw their stock prices increase this year 
through Friday. (Companies whose stocks sold for less than $2 as of Friday were 
not included.) 
</P>
<P>
Headline-making companies such as MCA weren't the biggest winners in the 
survey. In fact, MCA, whose acquisition by Matsushita, a Japanese conglomerate, 
has made a splash in Hollywood, saw its stock rise only 6% as of last Friday. 
MCA's stock rose from $62.25 per share on Dec. 31, 1989, to $66, the price per 
share that the Japanese company offered for the entertainment concern last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest gainer this year is an obscure company: Benton Oil &amp; Gas, a 
Ventura oil and gas exploration and production company, which has thrived 
recently on rising oil prices due to the Persian Gulf crisis. Benton's stock 
rose 228% to $16 per share on Friday from $9.75 per share (adjusted for a stock 
split) at the end of last year. Although it lost $177,462 in the nine months 
that ended Sept. 30, Benton's revenues surged in the third quarter and gave the 
company a profit of $503,068 for the period. And despite a string of losses, 
Benton's shareholders have long seemed convinced that the company -- which has 
a cadre of experienced oil business executives -- will strike it rich. 
</P>
<P>
A number of companies have investors betting that they can outperform most 
competitors during hard times. 
</P>
<P>
The most prominent example is Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, whose stock 
climbed 137% from $24.50 at the beginning of the year (adjusted for a stock 
split) to $58 on Friday. Amgen produces EPO, a drug for treating anemia in 
patients with kidney disease. Amgen's profits have soared since the drug was 
approved for sale in June, 1989. In the most recent quarter that ended Sept. 
30, the company's net income jumped 266% to $14.3 million. And because there is 
no medical alternative for the patients -- and much of the drug's costs are 
paid by Medicare and insurance plans -- sales won't be hurt by a recession. 
</P>
<P>
House of Fabrics, a Sherman Oaks fabric and sewing store chain, has become a 
favorite of some financial analysts who believe that the company can resist a 
recession. House of Fabrics' stock has surged 67% to $29 per share on Friday, 
from $17.38 at the end of last year. Some analysts theorize that more people 
make their own clothes during an economic downturn and that House of Fabrics is 
in a good position to thrive in the coming quarters. The company said its 
profit was up 5% for the most recent quarter that ended Oct. 31 to $4.52 
million from $4.3 million a year ago, while sales grew 13% to $104 million. 
</P>
<P>
Companies that seem to be bouncing back after earlier troubles also made the 
list. 
</P>
<P>
Micropolis, the Chatsworth disk-drive maker, has seen its stock rise in 
response to the recent signs of a turnaround at the company. Micropolis' stock 
closed Friday at $7.13, a 104% increase from $3.50 at the beginning of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988 and 1989, Micropolis was hurt by tough competition and a glut on the 
market for disk drives, which store computer data. But after a round of cost 
cutting, Micropolis has shown better results as its sales surged 50% to $99.8 
million for the third quarter that ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The company had a profit of $2.88 million, compared to a $23.7-million loss a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Another company whose stock seemed to rise because of an improved performance 
was Pinkerton's Inc., the Van Nuys security guard concern. 
</P>
<P>
After selling its stock to the public in April for $14 per share, the shares 
have risen 61% to close Friday at $22.50 per share. Pinkerton's sold stock to 
raise money to pay off some of its debts as a result of a 1988 leveraged buyout 
by company Chairman Thomas W. Wathen. 
</P>
<P>
Although the company's sales fell 4% in the third quarter that ended Sept. 7, 
its profit was $2.79 million, 61% more than a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
A similar comeback story helped the stock of Summit Health Ltd., a Burbank 
hospital and nursing-home chain. Summit increased its debts when it bought a 
string of hospitals in the mid-1980s and wound up losing a combined $14.9 
million in its 1988 and 1989 fiscal years. 
</P>
<P>
But in the most recent quarter, Summit's profit increased 56% to $1.6 million. 
Summit's stock has climbed 58% this year, from $1.50 per share to $2.38 on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
American Ecology Corp., an Agoura Hills waste disposal company, also seemed to 
please investors with a turnaround. Its stock has risen 32% to its $8.25 close 
on Friday, from $6.25 at the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
American Ecology recently reported its second profitable quarter in a row, 
earning $498,000 compared to a year-earlier loss of $1.79 million. 
</P>
<P>
American Ecology, which operates a number of hazardous-waste sites, was in a 
severe cash crunch after it was forced to set up a $23.5-million fund in 1988 
for settling lawsuits stemming from problems at some of the dump sites. 
</P>

Another example of better results bouying a stock is Amwest Insurance Group, 
which saw its stock rise about 5% this year to $11.38 on Friday. Amwest doubled 
its profit to $1.76 million in the third quarter that ended Sept. 30, from 
$729,000 last year.The picture looks brighter than it did a year ago when 
Amwest was having to put aside money in an account to cover potential rebates 
to customers under Proposition 103, the insurance-reform initiative. But in 
August, the state exempted companies such as Amwest -- whose business is bail 
bonds and other surety bonds, not traditional auto or home insurance -- from 
the terms of Proposition 103. As a result, Amwest was able to close the 
$800,000 reserve account.

<P>
But not every company whose stock climbed is doing well. North Hollywood-based 
Ventura Entertainment's stock soared 51% to close at $8.50 on Friday from $5.63 
(adjusted for a stock split) at the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
But Ventura lost $3.5 million between Oct. 31, 1989, and last Sept. 30 on sales 
of $7.16 million. (The company recently shifted its fiscal year-end to June 30 
from Oct. 31.) 
</P>
<P>
Although the stock has increased dramatically, Ventura recently filed suit in 
federal court claiming that two brokerages and a stock-newsletter writer had 
been spreading misinformation about the company to drive the stock down.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: VALLEY FEDERAL SELLS 60% OF ITS MOBILE-HOME LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan in Van Nuys said it made another step toward 
extricating itself from the mobile-home loan business, which was the primary 
reason for the company's loss of $138 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In October, Valley Federal sold $68-million worth of mobile-home loans -- about 
60% of the mobile-home loans that it owned -- to outside investors, according 
to a filing with the federal Office of Thrift Supervision that was released 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
That was an important step because about a year ago, federal regulators ordered 
Valley Federal out of the mobile-home loan business. Because of Valley 
Federal's huge losses in 1989, the thrift's capital, or the cash cushion it 
needs to maintain to protect it from losses, fell far below federal standards. 
As of Sept. 30, the thrift had a deficit of $22.3 million in tangible capital, 
a measure equal to a thrift's net worth, minus the value of some non-cash 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Valley Federal has been operating since May under terms of an 
agreement with the federal government to achieve certain profit levels and 
bolster its capital. So far, Valley Federal has met the terms of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Federal took other steps to eliminate some of the risk of losses from 
other mobile-home loans that it sold to investors prior to this year. To get 
the investors to buy the loans, Valley Federal had to guarantee that if the 
loans went bad, it would absorb some of the losses. 
</P>
<P>
But Valley Federal also said in the filing that during the first nine months of 
the year, it renegotiated with investors who had bought $82-million worth of 
those loans. Under the new deals, the S&amp;L will not have to absorb those 
losses. In addition, the portfolio of loans Valley Federal had sold to 
investors was reduced by another $73 million because borrowers made principal 
payments on the loans.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: PERFECTDATA TO SPEND $100,000 IN BUYBACK PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PerfectData Corp., a Simi Valley maker of computer maintenance supplies, said 
it set aside $100,000 to repurchase its stock in an effort to boost the stock's 
price. 
</P>
<P>
PerfectData's stock traded Monday at a bid price of 44 cents a share; at that 
price, $100,000 would buy about 227,272 shares, about 7% of its total shares 
outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
The company approved the repurchase because "three consecutive successful 
quarters have apparently gone unnoticed by the investment community" and failed 
to bolster the stock, PerfectData President Lee R. Mannheimer said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, PerfectData said it acquired the assets of Coverware Co. of San 
Diego, which makes computer and office equipment dust covers. Terms were not 
disclosed. PerfectData also hired Coverware's former president, Robert Miller, 
as product manager.

GLENDALE COMMERCIAL VACANCY RATE FALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The vacancy rate for commercial office space in Glendale fell 2 percentage 
points, to 10%, in the three months ended Sept. 30, according to a report by 
Grubb &amp; Ellis Commercial Real Estate Services. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, the vacancy rate in Glendale has fallen more 
than 4 points, the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
More office space was leased in the area this year than in the three previous 
years combined, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Total vacant square footage in the third quarter was 365,400, compared with 
371,250 between April and June. 
</P>
<P>
The report said occupied office space increased by 569,000 square feet in the 
third quarter, in large part because Carnation Co. moved into 300,000 square 
feet of office space in the company's recently completed building on Brand 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
An additional 100,000 square feet of the building was occupied by Walt Disney 
Imagineering. 
</P>
<P>
Other major leases signed in the third quarter included 43,000 square feet in 
the Koll Building and 35,000 square feet in the Glendale Corporate Center.

Richard Wentworth didn't talk much about his art during a recent two-hour 
interview, but he really didn't need to. The motivations for his work unfurled 
on their own in the course of a conversation about travel, landscape, comfort, 
expectations and the mechanics of conversation itself. 
</P>
<P>
Wentworth, 43, left his "dinosaur of a studio" in London's financial district 
last month to work in a spare, 1,000-square-foot warehouse near the Miramar 
Naval Air Station. He is the third artist -- after New Yorker Gary Lang and 
fellow Briton Eric Snell to come to San Diego to participate in an unusual 
artist-in-residence enterprise called Quint/Krichman Projects. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Quint, a local dealer in contemporary art, and his partner, attorney 
Michael Krichman, began the program earlier this year. Each artist they invite 
stays in a small La Jolla cottage for one month and works in the Miramar space. 
At the end of the residency, the warehouse becomes a gallery for the artist's 
finished work, and the public is invited to view the show by appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Wentworth's show opened Saturday and continues through the end of the year. Two 
Polish artists and a Dutch and a German are scheduled for residencies during 
the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
Wentworth, a sculptor whose work comments coyly on the idiosyncrasies of place 
and behavior, arrived in San Diego with no work in hand and no set plans. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was more truthful," he said. "It's more risky. I could schedule a 
month's work very easily, and I think it would probably have some interest, but 
it feels slightly immoral. It feels pointless. Why come here and sit under this 
(the roar of the Miramar jets) and not try to be a bit more responsive?" 
</P>
<P>
As the blanket of white noise lifted and descended, smothering the 
conversation, then sucking it in new directions, Wentworth spoke of the 
veracity of using materials and ideas in their own context. Shopping at the 
swap meet and a Santee depot -- something akin to an indoor swap meet -- has 
felt "like checking out the culture's digestive system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like a number of British sculptors of his generation, including Tony Cragg 
(whose work is the subject of a major retrospective currently at the Newport 
Harbor Art Museum) and Bill Woodrow, Wentworth fashions his work primarily out 
of humble everyday objects. Chairs, ladders, washtubs and drinking glasses 
appear often, but only after he has rendered these familiar forms slightly 
unfamiliar and playfully negated their function. 
</P>
<P>
In his show last year at Mark Quint's La Jolla exhibition space, he made solid 
objects appear sinuous, and the inanimate seem alive by soldering three steel 
washtubs together in a squirming line and titling the work "Eel." For the 
current show, he has enrobed a tall steel ladder in a skirt of wire mesh, 
calling attention to the nature of an object usually taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
"Ladders are quite comical," he said. "When they're necessary, they're very 
necessary, and when you don't need them, they're incredibly irritating -- where 
do you put them?" 
</P>
<P>
He has also mounted a pair of crutches high on opposite walls, one of them 
upside down. Normally used to recover from a disaster, Wentworth's crutches 
seem to be part of the calamity itself. His title for the work "Magnet" refers 
to the tense attraction between the separated objects and makes a private pun 
on the Italian word for magnet, calamita. 
</P>
<P>
A spirit of contradiction, thwarted expectation and humorous defiance 
characterizes all of Wentworth's work, which has its roots in the keen 
observation of human behavior as well as the shifting sensibilities of 
20th-Century British sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
Trained as a sculptor at Hornsey College of Art and the Royal College of art, 
both in London, Wentworth is also a photographer. He uses the camera to record 
arrangements of objects brought together by chance or by the unspoken 
procedures that govern our actions, that dictate, for example, that an 
interviewer's notebook belongs on her lap while her purse hangs from the back 
of the chair, and not vice-versa. 
</P>
<P>
"Broadly, if you look at the world that humans operate in, they mimic nature. 
Very occasionally you find a rock balanced on the wrong edge, but for the most 
part, the landscape is completely coherent. Everything is of an order. 
Underneath all of our formality and our manners, we are very like that. 
Essentially, that's what I took photographs of. 
</P>
<P>
"In its extreme form, it was the way people would resolve a predicament, 
precisely when the formal, normal method wasn't available to them," such as in 
his 1979 photograph of a damaged car fender, patched with a remnant of carpet. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a very slow recognition," he said, "that this is what I see all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The snapshots and written notes pinned to the walls of the Miramar warehouse 
bear evidence of that continuing fascination with the eccentric, the poetic, 
the extraordinary in the ordinary. In one photograph, two coat hangers on the 
pavement appear to the artist "sympathetic to each other," one hooked on the 
shadow of the other. The image hangs near the words pirate and overnight, 
inscribed in all their simplicity and potency on individual pieces of paper. 
</P>
<P>
Wentworth's love of "subcutaneous contradiction and rhyme" drew him to the work 
of the American photographer Walker Evans, whose images of vernacular 
architecture and signage were made in the 1930s. But the possibility of 
exploring such a concept in sculpture was laid open to Wentworth's generation 
by several preceding generations of British and American artists. 
</P>
<P>
"We all grew up knowing a lot about Minimalism, and I think that did impress 
us," he said. "That seemed like clearing the decks, intellectually. That was 
followed by quite diverse Conceptualism, and that's the climate we were 
students in, in the late '60s, early '70s." 
</P>
<P>
Around the same time, in 1967, Wentworth worked as an artisan for Henry Moore, 
mixing plaster in the sculptor's busy, business-like studio. Wentworth believes 
Moore gave sculpture back its dignity, and it was just that loftiness that 
following generations of British sculptors found "impossible." 
</P>
<P>
The modest materials and familiar forms that Wentworth uses are highly 
accessible, but they are only the raw material for a playful, subversive art 
that ends up questioning assumptions more than confirming them. 
</P>
<P>
Wentworth sees parallels in his work to alchemy, the ancient practice of 
turning base metals into precious ones. 
</P>
<P>
"The aspect of alchemy that I really like is when you see it in children," he 
said, "when you see them insist that something is something else. They can run 
a whole world around that. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, that's probably all that artists do. Everybody can do it, but a lot 
of people just give up on doing it because they think they'd better be 
grown-up. But most of our lives actually revolve around fantasy, around 
daydreams and night dreams and projections. It seems that one might as well own 
up to it and go with it, really."

THE BIG BRASS OF CLASSICAL APPEAL; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: THE FIVE-MEMBER CANADIAN BRASS HAS FOUND THE RIGHT MIX FOR PRODUCING 
GOLD. 
</P>

<P>
The Canadian Brass is traveling proof that classical music can lure the masses. 
</P>
<P>
The five-piece ensemble, which plays the Civic Theatre in downtown San Diego at 
8 p.m. Wednesday, has struck gold with its mix of classical, New Orleans jazz 
and pop songs. From the sale of its nearly 30 albums, 100 or more annual 
concert appearances and other sources, the group grosses more than $2 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the success is a rollicking live act designed to help the band gain and 
keep the attention of diverse audiences. 
</P>
<P>
A typical evening with the group ranges from an adagio by Samuel Barber to jazz 
tunes by Fats Waller or Jelly Roll Morton -- reworked for brass -- and, this 
time of year, a handful of Christmas favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Shows begin with the group's slow procession from the rear of a concert hall to 
the stage as it plays a New Orleans funeral march. After that, band members 
don't just sit there as they play. They have been known to pirouette while 
delivering ballet music, or dance their own version of the Russian Dance from 
"The Nutcracker." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, unlike pop performers who lip-sync to recorded tracks as they go through 
choreographed moves, the Canadian Brass plays it all live and uniformly 
receives excellent reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"We must be careful not to let the antics get in the way of the real message 
here," said French horn player David Ohanian. "We're really not comedians. 
Without the music, we have no show at all. People may find it hysterical that 
we sometimes do our tribute to ballet or a mini-opera on stage in costume. But 
we've found that audiences who have been to see a string quartet, or chamber 
music audiences, find our approach refreshing." 
</P>
<P>
Although band members are all classically trained, their shows include several 
jazz numbers. Serious jazz fans may find the group's versions of songs such as 
W. C. Handy's "St. Louis Blues" and "Beale Street Blues" a bit sanitary 
contrasted with renditions by pure jazz bands. 
</P>
<P>
The musicianship is faultless, but spontaneity and swing are in short supply. 
Ohanian acknowledges that the group makes no attempt to improvise on jazz 
numbers, sticking to charts prepared for the band by Luther Henderson, who has 
also arranged period jazz for Broadway musicals. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't improvise in this music," Ohanian said. "You're replicating, just as 
when we do a Handel organ concerto. Luther's intent is to create a written 
record of the classic Dixieland sound, with the classic licks and harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
"The trombone is very important -- and the trumpet and the clarinet, which we 
impersonate with a muted piccolo trumpet. The licks Luther uses are indigenous 
to Dixieland players. The trombone has a sliding sound, the trumpet has that 
growling sound. He has coached us so we can emulate the sounds." 
</P>
<P>
The band's recorded jazz has done extremely well. The group's 1987 "Basin 
Street" album stayed on Billboard's Crossover chart (for pop-oriented music by 
classical players) for 42 weeks and sold more than 120,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for this success is the jazz renaissance in America. 
</P>
<P>
"It's coming back," Ohanian said. "During the 1970s, it almost went underground 
when rock came to the forefront, but jazz is really enjoying a resurgence. It's 
always stayed big in Europe, but in the United States, we kind of let it wane. 
I see much more evidence of jazz in record stores and on classical music 
stations. In Canada, there's quite a bit more jazz on the radio than in the 
States. It seems like everywhere but where it was invented, it's been really 
hot." 
</P>
<P>
Not that classical music is any slouch for the Canadian Brass. "Art of the 
Fugue," for example -- an album of Bach's music for organ, rearranged for brass 
-- sold more than 40,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
Classical music purists may question the group's adaptations of classical organ 
pieces, since the compositions were never intended for brass. 
</P>
<P>
"We're brass players, not organists, but we want to play the music," Ohanian 
said. "If you believe in the music, try to make it yours, share that enthusiasm 
with the audience, the audience seems to pick up on it. 
</P>
<P>
"When offered the criticism of, 'Hey, you're brass, leave the organ alone' -- 
well, there isn't a lot of repertoire for brass from the earlier periods of 
music, because the instruments really weren't perfected like they are today. 
The technique of the players was not as advanced either. So this is a really 
modern phenomenon, a brass quintet that fills a 3,000-seat auditorium without 
amplification." 
</P>
<P>
Popularity and the ability to fill large venues didn't come overnight. The 
group has diligently built a following during 20 years together. 
</P>
<P>
Tuba player Charles Daellenbach and trombonist Eugene Watts met in Toronto in 
the late 1960s while Daellenbach was teaching music at the University of 
Toronto and Watts was principal trombonist in the Toronto Symphony. They 
founded the Canadian Brass in 1970, and are the only remaining original 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Trumpeters Fred Mills and Ronald Romm, who played with the Houston Symphony 
Orchestra and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, have been in the band since the 
early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Ohanian, an 11-year veteran of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the band's 
newest member, joined in 1986, moving over from the Empire Brass. 
</P>
<P>
Besides touring and recording, the group is attempting to appeal to the MTV 
generation. It has released four videos during the past five years: three of 
concerts plus an instructional tape for music students. 
</P>
<P>
"And we just got back from London, where Philips (the group's recording label) 
produced the Canadian Brass on Laserdisc. This will be our first release in the 
high-definition television format, next fall." 
</P>
<P>
The new video project weaves the group's music through a fictional tale about 
their boyhoods, with young actors playing the musicians as youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"This really is quite a litmus test for the brass," Ohanian said. "We'll see if 
we can organize and tape classical music in an interesting, attention-grabbing 
way that can be sold commercially to a general audience. If so, that bodes very 
well for other groups of our kind."

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: SINGER LAMENTS THE LACK OF CLUB DATES 
IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Frustrated by the lack of local club dates for jazz singers, Cath Eckert gave 
up on clubs last spring and has been making a living doing casuals -- parties, 
weddings, conventions. 
</P>
<P>
She'll be back in a club for the first time since then when she appears 
Wednesday evenings, from 5:30 to 9:30 through December, at the U.S. Grant Hotel 
lounge downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"My main main love is jazz, and I do it whenever I can," said Eckert. 'But for 
a while, I said, 'Forget it, it's too much trouble.' To get a jazz gig, you 
have to be able to pack the place, and you end up spending all your time 
mailing out flyers." 
</P>
<P>
Eckert said opportunities for jazz singers seem to be at an all-time low in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what's happened. You'd think with the popularity of Diane Schuur 
and other singers that jazz vocalists would be popular. There are some singers 
out there, but mostly doing R&amp;B, 1950s and Top 40 stuff." 
</P>
<P>
At the Grant, Eckert will be singing standards such as Tadd Dameron's "If You 
Could See Me Now," Latin versions of jazz pieces such as "I Concentrate on You" 
and "Street of Dreams," plus holiday songs including "Have Yourself a Merry 
Little Christmas" and "The Christmas Song." She'll be joined by husband Chris 
Conner on bass and Mike Wofford on piano. 
</P>
<P>
"Luv in the Afternoon," the new album by San Diegans Jeannie and Jimmy Cheatham 
and the Sweet Baby Blues Band, continues the band's punchy blend of jazz and 
blues, but with a special grit: the guitar of guest performer Clarence 
(Gatemouth) Brown. Brown contributes his bluesy string bends and T-Bone 
Walker-inspired jazz-blues lines to three songs. The album mixes originals by 
the Cheathams with blues standards such as "Don't You Feel My Leg" and "Baby 
Please Don't Go." Jeannie Cheatham's earthy vocals and swinging piano drive the 
music. 
</P>
<P>
The music is rock solid, but it doesn't have the heat of the band's live 
performances. For that, you can visit Elario's later this month, where they 
close 1990 with a weeklong stay that ends New Year's Eve. It's been a busy year 
for the Cheathams: They appeared at the Blue Note in New York City and guested 
on the "Today Show" in August, played the Chicago Jazz Festival in September 
and entertained travelers aboard the S.S. Norway during a jazz cruise to the 
Virgin Islands. They also made the cover of the September/October issue of 
"Living Blues" magazine, which contained an article on them by San Diegan Jim 
Trageser. 
</P>
<P>
John Patitucci, who opens five nights at Elario's on Wednesday, is equally 
adept at either electric or acoustic bass. On his new album, "Sketchbook," for 
example, Patitucci's playing ranges from earthy, acoustic bass beneath Michael 
Brecker's Coltrane-inspired sax on " 'Trane" to a sliding, sensuous sound on 
six-string electric bass in the funky "Joab." 
</P>
<P>
Patitucci's significant break came in 1985, when he was asked by Chick Corea to 
join the keyboard player's Elektric Band. He continues to play with Corea while 
pursuing a solo career. 
</P>
<P>
"Sketchbook" is his third album. Few bassists are worth several minutes of solo 
time, but Patitucci is one exception. From the difficult upright bass, for 
example, he wrings rapid-fire lines with the ease of the best electric guitar 
players, and he matches saxophonists one-on-one, playing speedy melody lines in 
unison. 
</P>
<P>
As a composer, Patitucci is coming of age. He wrote most of the music on the 
new album (which rated 4 1/2 stars out of 5 in "Downbeat"), and his tastes run 
from jazz to funk to Brazilian. At Elario's, Patitucci will be joined by 
drummer Vinnie Colaiuta, keyboardist John Beasley and saxophonist Steve 
Tavaglione. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Dec. 10, KIFM (98.1) will operate from quarters matching its slick 
on-air image. After four years in an anonymous stucco building in Kearny Mesa, 
the station has spent $1.8 million on a 10-year lease, equipment and interior 
design for a 6,500-square-foot space in the Tishman Hurst Town Centre in La 
Jolla's Golden Triangle, visible from Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
A black marble floor and a splotch-painted wall that looks like a moody sky 
greet visitors. Other walls are painted in bright shades of blue and grape, 
reminiscent of a sixties record store. The new, larger space will accommodate a 
growing music collection, which station program director Bob O'Connor hopes to 
increase from 125 CDs to 1,000 in the months ahead. The station also has about 
1,000 record albums, especially of straight-ahead jazz not available on CDs. 
With the popularity of Ron Galon's Sunday night straight-ahead show, the 
station plans to expand its straight-ahead collection. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Vocalist Michael Franks kicks off winter's "Simply Jazz" series at East 
County Performing Arts Center in El Cajon at 3:30 Sunday afternoon. Tickets are

MILITANT BLACKS MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pan-Africanist Congress, a militant breakaway from the African National 
Congress, is to decide whether to accept a South African government invitation 
to participate in constitutional negotiations at a precedent-setting session 
starting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting inside the country for the first time in three decades, the PAC, which 
was legalized early this year, says its membership has been growing steadily in 
recent months with converts among young blacks unhappy with the ANC's decision 
to open talks with the government. 
</P>
<P>
The PAC has waged its own small-scale guerrilla war against Pretoria, and has 
so far refused talks until government abolishes apartheid and agrees to hand 
over power to a black majority. But some key PAC figures, including leaders 
still in exile, think it may be time to reconsider lest they be left out of the 
important constitution drafting process.

PRESTON MANNING: PREACHING POPULISM IN THE HEARTLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man who has channeled western Canadian disaffection into Canada's 
fastest-growing political party is Preston Manning, 48, the son of a prairie 
populist who governed the province of Alberta for a record 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Manning grew up on a 70-Holstein dairy farm, read the Bible assiduously, 
studied economics at the University of Alberta and watched from the ringside as 
his father, the famous Ernest Manning, governed. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Manning had made a name for himself on western Canada's "Back to the 
Bible Hour" radio show; his political organization, the Social Credit Party, 
was a conservative, religious, populist movement originally formed around the 
free-credit principles of an obscure English engineer.

As a young man, Preston Manning realized he shared much of his father's faith 
and conservatism and felt tempted to follow him into Social Credit politics. 
But by the time young Manning was old enough to make a difference, the 
so-called SoCreds were on the ropes in Alberta. Rather than join the big-time 
Liberals or Progressive Conservatives, he decided to wait until the time was 
right to organize a new movement. 
</P>
<P>
While he waited, Manning ran a business-consulting firm, serving up economic 
advice to top Canadian companies with interests in Alberta. In the mid-1980s he 
helped organize a Vancouver meeting of alienated western Canadians, which 
eventually led to the creation of the Reform Party. He was elected party leader 
at the Reformists' founding convention, in 1987. MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

Huge man-made forests of fast-growing eucalyptus trees, blue-green strangers 
from Australia and Tasmania, are changing the face of the Iberian Peninsula. It 
is good business, but not everybody thinks it is a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
In remote, often backward villages of Portugal and Spain, new forests that 
promise profit also challenge history. They threaten folkways and homespun 
lifestyles that have endured for centuries. In Iberia, the eucalyptus awakens 
great passion. 
</P>
<P>
The 300 inhabitants of Tazones, a Spanish village on the Bay of Biscay, 
revolted against eucalyptus. By night they crept into the surrounding 
countryside and uprooted thousands of seedlings planted the day before. The 
same thing happened in the Asturian village of Luarca. 
</P>
<P>
Near the town of Valpacos in northern Portugal, 2,000 farmers battled police to 
destroy intruder eucalyptus in what had been an olive grove. In another 
Portuguese village, farmers chained themselves to tractors to stop land from 
being cleared for eucalyptus. 
</P>
<P>
In Iberia, where eucalyptus for paper pulp is an increasingly important cash 
crop, farmers are joined in their opposition by environmentalists and leftist 
political parties. They say it is ruinous to the environment, and to the fabric 
of rural society, turning farm towns into ghost towns. The eucalyptus is 
nicknamed the "fascist" or "capitalist" tree in Portugal for the wealth it 
supposedly brings land owners and industrialists at the expense of peasants and 
their land. 
</P>
<P>
Iberia's furor over a tree is testimony to a continental reality muted amid 
West Europe's avid rush to integrate: The majority may benefit but a minority 
will suffer. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of our peasants are poor and ignorant. They don't know they can get 
together and have some say. Then the cellulose company comes in, full of money 
and pressures, and they sell out," said Carlota Lagoa, a director of Portugal's 
League for the Protection of Nature. 
</P>
<P>
Between 2 million and 3 million acres of eucalyptus are now growing in Iberia, 
with most plantations sown in postwar decades. It grows well, but in tumult. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of hostility, Spain worse than Portugal, but it's the same as in 
every country where eucalyptus has been planted as a plantation crop. 
Everywhere, people rise up against it at first," acknowledged Richard Howson 
Jr., the American chairman of Caima, one of four cellulose companies in 
Portugal that build clean, efficient and profitable eucalyptus forests for the 
paper pulp they produce. 
</P>
<P>
In Portugal, an environmentalist group called Quercus, which has organized 
protests against eucalyptus, argues that large-scale planting of a single, 
fast-growing genus dries up water sources, causes soil erosion, ruins the 
beauty of the landscape, destroys wildlife and drives peasants from the land. 
</P>
<P>
"Portugal has an archaic agriculture that uses a lot of manpower. The spread of 
the eucalyptus plantations makes men idle and forces them to migrate to other 
regions," said Armando de Carvalho, vice president of Quercus. 
</P>
<P>
In Spain, where environmentalists complain that eucalyptus is crowding out 
indigenous forests of native oak and beech in Galicia and La Coruna, ecologists 
say that traditional rural lifestyles, while not as profitable, provide more 
employment. By one study, an Iberian olive grove requires 199 worker-days per 
hectare (2.47 acres) to maintain each year, vineyards 128 worker-days and a 
eucalyptus plantation four worker-days. 
</P>
<P>
Landowners are usually receptive to eucalyptus, but farmers hate to see land 
worked by their forefathers surrendered to a big company's quiet trees. 
Shepherds don't like to lose pastureland. Towns even resent the departure of 
sunshine from once-open land now still and forest-shaded. Eucalyptus forests 
are clean, and they are dull. Oil in the tree discourages bugs, which means 
fewer birds. There is no undergrowth in a managed forest, and little wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
The introduction of a eucalyptus species will cause the landscape to change 
within five years, notes Lars Kardell, a Swedish professor of environmental 
forestry. "The people of Portugal have seen their olive plantations and 
vineyards replaced with 20-meter high, blue-green eucalyptus plantations, and 
it is easy to understand their criticism." 
</P>
<P>
Producers, which include government cellulose companies in both Spain and 
Portugal, say their forests do not damage the environment but instead promise a 
bright future for rural areas with indifferent soils that have been bypassed by 
Europe's unprecedented prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems come from remote and backward areas where the people have low 
levels of knowledge and low levels of income and from ecologists -- who tend to 
be city people," said Jorge Casquilho, director of planning and studies for 
Portugal's National Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
One landmark United Nations study on the producer-environmentalist debate urges 
that no large-scale planting take place "without intelligent assessment of the 
social and economic consequences," but it says "there can be no universal 
answer, either favorable or unfavorable, to the planting of eucalyptus." 
</P>
<P>
"The eucalyptus needs a lot of water, true, but so do other trees. We don't 
plant where it would detract from the water supply," said Howson. "They say you 
can't use the soil after eucalyptus. Not true. It does as well as anything else 
at mulching. We plant only on the lowest graded soils, and we cannot touch 
protected trees like cork oak or olives." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, notes Casquilho, Portugal updated its forestry legislation to 
regulate eucalyptus. Portugal has more than its share of forest fires, but now 
it is forbidden to plant burned acres with eucalyptus. Neither can they be 
planted close to watercourses, or towns, or hilltops. Private forest owners are 
not allowed to replace cork oaks or elms with eucalyptus. 
</P>
<P>
Iberia is a peninsular mirror of eucalyptus' international wealth and weight. 
It is already clear that eucalyptus, in nearly 550 sundry and useful species, 
will be man's first-choice forest for the 21st Century. The U.N. Food and 
Agriculture Organization says there were 1.4 million acres of eucalyptus 
planted around the world in 1955, but 10 million acres by 1980. Since then, 
eucalyptus plantations have expanded by around 450,000 acres per year, by FAO 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, eucalyptus will grow only in California and Florida, but 
there are plantations in more than 100 countries where the tree is prized not 
only as a source of paper but also for windbreaks, timber and firewood. 
Eucalyptus already produces about one-third of the world's pulp. And it makes 
money as well as paper: A eucalyptus produces twice as much wood pulp as a 
comparably sized pine. 
</P>
<P>
In Portugal, 13% of forest land is planted in eucalyptus, compared with 21% 
cork oak and 40% pine, but National Forestry Service figures show that exports 
from eucalyptus, nearly doubling between 1985 and 1989, already generate more 
income than either pine or cork, of which Portugal produces half the world 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
"The eucalyptus controversy," as it is known in Spain, is downside counterpoint 
to the good news about the emerging frontier-free Europe. The birth of an 
integrated 12-nation market at the end of 1992 means the free movement of goods 
and people within the European Community. But it also ultimately means imposed 
change and psychic hardship for marginal, high-cost producers, like small 
Iberian farmers and stock raisers, who cannot compete in a free market. 
</P>
<P>
"Marginal areas for agriculture shouldn't be used for agriculture," said Howson 
in a view shared by community planners. 
</P>
<P>
Change is a particularly painful prospect for the Portuguese countryside, 
where, in some of the poorest areas of the new Europe, high agricultural 
production costs have historically been masked by government subsidies that 
must gradually vanish as Portugal lives up to the free-market obligations of 
its European Community membership. That means abolishing tariffs and import 
quotas, and reducing guaranteed high produce prices underwritten by every 
Portuguese government for half a century. 
</P>
<P>
Spain and Portugal are both full members of the community, but in Portugal, 
particularly, life in the countryside is a long way from the Eurocrat's 
carpeted world in Brussels. The difference between the sere minifundios -- 
small farms -- of northern Portugal and the mechanized world of prosperous 
German, French and Dutch farmers is less one of degree than of century. 
</P>
<P>
Portugal has the lowest level of agricultural productivity in the community, 
with yields averaging between one-quarter and one-fifth of those in other 
countries, according to Agriculture Minister Arlindo Cunha. 
</P>
<P>
At least one-third of the rural population in Portugal is illiterate. While 18% 
of the national work force is employed in agriculture, it generates only 7% of 
national income. 
</P>
<P>
In Portugal, marginal lands have been worked for generations for unirrigated 
cereal crops, or used for olives, unimproved pasture and scrub forest. 
Eucalyptus globulus planted three meters apart flourish on that sort of land 
with regimental precision. Trees can reach a mature height of around 90 feet in 
15 years, although they are usually cut before then, and their resprouted 
stumps also harvested twice or three times. 
</P>
<P>
"Walking in a forest we build is like visiting a cathedral: vaulted, hushed, 
peaceful," said Howson. 
</P>
<P>
That may be, but in the back-lands of Iberia, eucalyptus will never have the 
soul of the gnarled cork oak, or of the pine or beech that are the staples of 
nature and of history. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a crime to transform our mountains into monumental stairways of 
eucalyptus," said De Carvalho, referring to the terraces that boost 
productivity of the rich but widely resented immigrant trees.

<P>
When Canada-watchers look north for clues on how well this vast, diverse nation 
is holding together, they usually set their sights on Quebec, the 
French-speaking province in the east that periodically makes noises about 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
These days, though, they might just as well turn their gaze west, toward 
Canada's prairie heartland. 
</P>
<P>
Here in this tiny town in Alberta province, for instance, about two dozen 
citizens turned out on a recent evening in the local recreation center to 
discuss, amid the crashing of bowling balls, the need for a thorough revision 
of the national agenda. They had not a good word to say about the policies 
emanating from Ottawa, Canada's capital. In their own way, they expressed 
convictions just as strong as those of the French-speaking supporters of 
sovereignty in Quebec, 1,500 miles to the east. 
</P>
<P>
"We're bankrupt. We're broke. We're in a mess," said Bob Slavik, a retired 
physician and activist for the Alberta-based Reform Party, who co-chaired the 
meeting. Slavik called for massive changes in the way Canada operates: 
constitutional amendments, a restructuring of the Parliament, deep budget cuts, 
the scrapping of all Indian treaties. His listeners seemed to like his ideas; a 
number of them plunked down a small membership fee and joined the Reform Party 
at the end of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The scene in Thorsby is being repeated in town halls, living rooms and hockey 
arenas all across the West as fed-up locals give traditional Canadian parties 
the slip and rush to join the Reform Party. Unlike the backers of sovereignty 
in Quebec, the Reform Party isn't calling for separation outright. But all the 
same, Canadian federalists are worried about the party's rapid growth, since 
its West-first message -- coming at a time of heightened regional tension -- 
promises to drive this country's geographic wedges even deeper. 
</P>
<P>
The burgeoning Reform Party isn't the only sign of the West's growing 
alienation from the rest of Canada. Treasury officials in Alberta and British 
Columbia have lately been trying to find legal ways of collecting taxes 
themselves, to keep the federal government from taking the money away. In 
Saskatchewan, Premier Grant Devine has been battling the federal government -- 
successfully so far -- for the freedom to build a huge dam complex without 
completing strict, federally mandated environmental impact studies. 
</P>
<P>
But for all this high-level regionalism, the strongest sign of western 
alienation comes not from officials working within the system but from ordinary 
people on the outside -- the disillusioned citizens flocking to join the Reform 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
"They believe the (ruling Progressive) Conservatives have sold them out," says 
Alan Tupper, chairman of the political science department at the University of 
Alberta. 
</P>
<P>
The Reform Party didn't even exist until October, 1987. Now it claims more than 
52,000 members, with 3,000 more signing up each month, many of them disgusted 
defectors from Canada's governing party, the Progressive Conservatives. When 
the Reform Party ran its first slate of candidates in 1988 federal elections, 
it didn't win a single parliamentary seat. But soon afterward, a member died in 
office, a by-election was held, and a Reform Party member won handily. 
</P>
<P>
Six months later, another Reform Party candidate was elected to the Canadian 
Senate, the upper house of Parliament, by defeating the closest of his six 
opponents by a 2-to-1 margin. (The Canadian Senate is, in fact, an appointed 
body, but Prime Minister Brian Mulroney accepted the vote and nominated the 
winner eight months later.) 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts are predicting that if another parliamentary election were 
held today, the Reform Party would win up to 40 more seats in the 295-member 
House of Commons, Parliament's lower house. Although that is far from enough to 
make a majority, such a showing could give the pro-West party significant 
influence in today's Canada, where the two main traditional parties -- the 
Progressive Conservatives and the Liberals -- are fast losing ground. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Weir, a Reform Party executive in Edmonton, Alberta's capital, offers what 
he calls "a very likely scenario" for the next elections, which must be held 
before November, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
In this scenario, neither the Progressive Conservatives nor the Liberals get 
enough votes to form a majority government, but the Socialist New Democratic 
Party and the separatist Bloc Quebecois don't really flower either. If the 
Reform Party could win 40 seats in such a Parliament, Weir says, it would hold 
the balance of power and the ability to force its agenda on any mainstream 
party trying to govern. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't be the prime minister, the next best thing is to be the party 
holding the balance of power," he says. "The party with the balance of power 
can bring down the government, virtually at any time." 
</P>
<P>
Such a prospect is daunting to the many Canadians -- especially eastern 
federalists -- who consider the Reform Party a reactionary movement, out of 
sync with what it has always meant to be a Canadian. By tradition in Canada, 
the federal government takes money in taxes from the wealthier provinces, such 
as oil-rich Alberta, and applies it toward helping the poorer provinces, such 
as Newfoundland. To Canadians brought up in this tradition, Reform Party 
influence would mean not a fair shake for the West but neglect for the marginal 
everywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Reformists want to cut welfare payments, end the funding of 
public-interest groups and screen foreign immigrants on the basis of their 
economic potential. They even want to forbid immigrant Sikhs to wear their 
turbans if they join the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 
</P>
<P>
"They know what they're against, but there's no positive platform," the 
University of Alberta's Tupper says of the Reformists. 
</P>
<P>
Reformists don't like being characterized as negative reactionaries, though, 
and they point out that their platform also includes restructuring Canada's 
discredited Senate, making members of Parliament more accountable and shrinking 
the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Reform Party's most cherished goals is the end of official 
bilingualism in Canada. At the moment, Canadian law requires government offices 
throughout the West to retain French-speaking employees who can deal with the 
Francophone public -- even though there are few unilingual Francophones west of 
Quebec. Westerners have long considered this a waste of money, and now that the 
Canadian economy is in a recession, Reform Party calls to trim the linguistic 
fat fall on receptive ears. 
</P>
<P>
In Edmonton, pro-West activist Alan Clark tells a story that sums up the mood. 
A woman in British Columbia started a small business making jam at home and 
selling it to health-food stores, he says. She was eventually arrested by 
bilingualism authorities for not listing her ingredients in French on her 
labels -- even though French is spoken by only a tiny fraction of the British 
Columbia population. 
</P>
<P>
Clark is the president of a group that predates the Reform Party by about a 
decade, the Western Independence Assn. He takes a harder line than the Reform 
Party, arguing that Canada doesn't "work," that no amount of electoral 
politicking can save it and that the four western provinces should split off 
and form a new country on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Westerners are now flocking to the Reform Party instead of his Western 
Independence Assn., but Clark says that's fine with him: The Reform Party 
"duplicates our agenda almost perfectly," he says. He thinks every angry new 
westerner the Reform Party organizes brings his goal a little closer. 
</P>
<P>
"The Reform Party is doing a fantastic job of educating people," he says. "We 
(western separatists) are in an 'up' phase -- not in terms of membership or 
money, but because our movement is so close to its conclusion."

<P>
What if Mikhail S. Gorbachev falls? 
</P>
<P>
That question is increasingly on the minds of top U.S. officials these days as 
the Soviet Union -- and its president -- are buffeted by rapid deterioration of 
the country's economy, mounting ethnic violence and, now, the possibility of 
serious food shortages. 
</P>
<P>
But surprising as it may seem, the United States has no formal contingency 
plans for use if the Soviet leader is ousted, quits or otherwise leaves office, 
and U.S. officials seem to be in no hurry to put together such a program, 
despite the growing turmoil there. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the void is simply the slow pace of traditional 
analytical procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA has just finished preparing a new national intelligence estimate that 
looks closely at prospects for stability in the Soviet Union -- including a 
variety of scenarios under which Gorbachev may survive or fall. 
</P>
<P>
If the White House decides it is necessary, the National Security Council will 
set up an interagency task force to formulate contingency plans. Some expect 
the order to be handed down soon. "We're ready with some ideas whenever they 
get ready for them," one State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
But the seemingly leisurely approach also reflects a belief -- both within the 
U.S. government and among outside Sovietologists -- that any new Soviet 
leadership is almost certain to follow the same foreign policies as Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Like Gorbachev's, any new Soviet government would need access to food, medical 
help and economic aid while it is trying to calm the domestic chaos. That means 
no threats of nuclear strikes and no efforts to retake the former East Europe 
satellites. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there is increasing confidence here that Gorbachev can keep the lid 
on events in the Soviet Union -- even if it means relying on military force. 
</P>
<P>
He has rejected demands to give up more political and economic authority, which 
would have eroded his ability to control events there. And he has endorsed the 
use of force -- ostensibly to protect the military but potentially to fight 
demonstrators, as well. 
</P>
<P>
"This could lead to confrontation and conflict," a U.S. official admitted. 
"It's very volatile right now, with these wild press accounts of 'Lithuanian 
forests filled with armed bandits' -- much like the Soviet press said about 
Czechoslovakia just before the (1968) invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"One inadvertent spark could set off an explosion," he added. "You saw that 
Gorbachev canceled his trip to Norway" next Sunday and Monday to receive the 
Nobel Peace Prize. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some officials suspect that the new optimism toward Gorbachev may 
reflect Administration hopes rather than Soviet reality. Only reluctantly has 
the Administration moved to broaden its contacts with other Soviet leaders, for 
fear of undermining Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"You know how intelligence estimates can be tailored to fit existing policy," 
said one official familiar with the estimating process. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor in the slow pace of contingency planning might be that 
policy-makers such as Secretary of State James A. Baker III may feel that, 
because of the close contacts with Soviet officials, they know more than their 
Soviet experts about developments in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"Baker has logged more hours with senior Soviet leaders than any American 
official in memory," said RAND Corp.'s senior Soviet analyst, Arnold Horelick. 
"When no one saw Russian leaders, then the remote expertise of trained 
specialists carried more weight. Now, the danger is that some of these people 
will think they are their own Soviet experts." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, U.S. analysts say there may be little that the West can do to 
intervene if Gorbachev is ousted or steps down for some reason. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow already is on notice by the world community that if massive political 
arrests and killings of demonstrators occur -- like the Tian An Men Square 
massacre in China -- the Soviet Union will jeopardize its Western economic 
goals, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"Fundamentally, we don't have much leverage," one official complained. 
"Humanitarian aid, diplomatic warnings, maybe economic sanctions. That's about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials cite three scenarios for Gorbachev's future, which are reflected 
in the new intelligence estimates. They are, in order of probability: 
</P>
<P>
* Gorbachev survives but must crack down between now and spring, possibly even 
imposing martial law to maintain order, ease food distribution and suppress 
speculation in scarce goods. "He uses an iron fist," a senior official 
explained, "but with the benevolent goal of preventing a more severe explosion 
later. But unrest, violent clashes seem to be in the cards." 
</P>
<P>
* Gorbachev leaves and is replaced by a regime that is harder-line on the 
political integrity of the union, but more radical in allowing economic freedom 
to republics. One or more of the major republics, such as the Ukraine, secede 
within two or three years after efforts to intimidate them fail. 
</P>
<P>
* Gorbachev "escapes forward" by sharing power rather than losing it, agreeing 
to the devolution of economic and political authority to the republics. But he 
becomes increasingly irrelevant as the union fragments. Without central 
leadership, the Soviet Union becomes even less a player in world affairs than 
it is today. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and its European allies want to prevent any resort to 
violence which, among other outcomes, could produce a destabilizing flood of 
refugees from the Soviet Union into Eastern Europe and farther westward. 
</P>
<P>
Food and medical aid, which might help forestall an explosion, already are 
being provided, primarily by Germany. U.S. officials remain unconvinced that 
massive famine will occur. They note that Gorbachev's pleas for such help have 
yielded pledges of about $15 billion.

LEGISLATURE TAKES OFFICE IN SOMBER MOOD;

POLITICS: THE SPECTER OF PROPOSITION 140, WHICH LIMITS THEIR TERMS IN OFFICE, 
SETS THE MOOD FOR LAWMAKERS IN THE STATE CAPITOL.

<P>
The first California lawmakers to serve under a new law limiting their terms 
took office Monday amid sober reflection about the Legislature's inability to 
solve many of the state's most pressing problems. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after pledging to change things for the better, the members reelected as 
their leaders Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and Senate President Pro Tem David 
A. Roberti, who have been at the helm of the Legislature since Jimmy Carter was 
President. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly members got an upbeat pep talk from lame-duck Gov. George Deukmejian 
and heard Brown, a San Francisco Democrat, tell them that they have been doing 
a "magnificent" job despite media reviews and public opinion to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
But among the rank and file, the mood was more downcast. 
</P>
<P>
The reality of Proposition 140's term limits, capping service at six years in 
the Assembly and eight in the Senate, was sinking in. One of the ballot 
initiative's other provisions, the elimination of the Legislature's pension 
program, hit home recently when lawmakers got official notice that the program 
had ceased. Still to come is a cut of up to 50% in the Legislature's operating 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a realization that there's a dark cloud hanging over the California 
Legislature," said Assemblyman Sam Farr, a Monterey Democrat, whose father also 
served in the Legislature. "That perception has to be dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
Monday marked the official beginning of the 1991-1992 Legislative session. In 
the Assembly, 12 new members -- the most since 1982 -- were sworn in along with 
68 returnees. In the Senate, a single new member and 19 who were reelected Nov. 
6 took the oath of office to join the 19 members who did not face the voters 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Assembly from the desk he once occupied in the rear of the 
chamber, Deukmejian noted that more than 2,000 people move to California every 
day. He said they do so because he and the Legislature have kept the state 
"great." 
</P>
<P>
"This Legislature should feel very, very proud of the accomplishments that 
you've made," said Deukmejian, who has often criticized the 
Democratic-controlled institution for failures in solving problems. Brown, 
after he was elected to his sixth term as Speaker on a party-line vote, 
suggested that the Assembly might be able to improve its image by following 
through on an experiment to televise its sessions on cable systems statewide. 
</P>
<P>
"The public has no clue as to what we are doing," Brown said. "We intend to 
correct that. We need to let the public know how we are conducting the public's 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the media have focused too heavily on political corruption and the 
budget crisis while downplaying such successes as a bill to help the state 
respond to oil spills and his own legislation to require every motorist to wear 
a seatbelt. In a personal aside, Brown said his daughter Susan's car was struck 
by a speeding automobile on a Los Angeles street over the weekend, leaving her 
with a broken sternum. He said her injuries would have been much worse had she 
not been wearing a seatbelt. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming months, Brown said, the Legislature should address a crisis in 
health insurance, the drug abuse problem, and growth management. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's two newest legislators had different reactions to the ceremonial 
bustle of Monday's swearing-in. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I'm comfortable," said Gotch (D-San Diego), a veteran of the San 
Diego City Council who sat seriously through the business on the Assembly 
floor. "While it's a different city, a different surrounding, a different 
legislative body, I don't feel overwhelmed at all because I've had the benefit 
of serving in a legislative arena before. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm eager to get to work and begin authoring and co-authoring bills," said 
Gotch, adding that he has already offered to sign up as co-sponsor of a 
universal health insurance measure. Other areas of interest: measures dealing 
with the environment, education and ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the more mundane details. Gotch said he will start today to 
interview people applying to be his office secretary. 
</P>
<P>
While Gotch took it all in stride, rookie Assemblywoman Dede Alpert (D-Del Mar) 
said she was a little "nervous." 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the things are overwhelming," she said. "The challenge is just 
incredible. I think I'm going to bring hard work to it (the Legislature) and a 
real effort, and I'm proud to be able to be doing this. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud to represent my district," she said, alluding to her dark-horse 
victory over controversial incumbent Republican Sunny Mojonnier. "I'm going to 
work really hard at doing it and eventually hope people will even know who Dee 
Dee Alpert is." 
</P>
<P>
Alpert stressed that her first job in Sacramento will be "learning . . . and 
listening," and her first shot at legislative business delivered an unexpected 
lesson. 
</P>
<P>
In the voice vote to reelect Speaker Brown for the two-year session, the 
alphabetized roll call dictated that Alpert cast one of the first votes. She 
mistakenly spoke into a dead microphone, and it appeared to many in the 
Assembly chambers that the newcomer was actually abstaining -- a move that 
could be considered a slight to the powerful speaker. 
</P>
<P>
But on the second time through the roll call, Alpert caught on and yelled out 
Brown's name to add her vote to the record. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't intentional," Alpert said about her first-call silence.

At least 64 people have been killed in an explosion of knife and gun battles 
for political supremacy in South African black townships, and military 
reinforcements were called in to help police restore order. The fighting 
erupted between residents loyal to Nelson Mandela's African National Congress 
and migrant workers sympathetic to the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party.

SALES OF NEW HOMES IN FREE FALL, HIT AN 8-YEAR LOW IN OCTOBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sales of new homes dropped 3.5% in October to the lowest level in eight years, 
the government reported today. But analysts said the free fall may be bottoming 
out and sales should begin rebounding by spring. 
</P>
<P>
"Sales should be leveling off at this number in the fourth quarter and the 
first quarter of next year," assuming mortgage rates continue to fall and the 
Mideast problem is resolved, said economist David G. Seiders of the National 
Assn. of Home Builders. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Mark H. Obrinsky of the Federal National Mortgage Assn. suggested 
that sales may zig-zag for several months, "but assuming no blowup in the 
Middle East . . . I expect to see a more sustained pickup by spring of 1991." 
</P>
<P>
Sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 491,000, the Departments of 
Commerce and Housing and Urban Development said in a joint release. That was 
the lowest since 480,000 new homes were sold in October, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, new home sales are off 15.8% from the same period of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Sales fell 4% in September and 2% in August. The September figure was revised 
from 6% in the departments' initial estimate, but the October total was worse 
than the 1.8% drop first reported. 
</P>
<P>
Obrinsky said the main reason for the decline "is great consumer uncertainty 
and generally negative buying sentiment." 
</P>
<P>
The median price of a new home sold in October was $121,800, up from $112,900 
in September but down from $123,000 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Seiders attributed the price increase to a hefty 47.4% gain in sales in the 
Northeast, which has the highest housing costs in the nation. Sales there 
totaled an annual rate of 84,000 units after falling 12.9% the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
Sales in all other regions fell, including a drop of 18.2% in the West to 
112,000 units. That was the lowest since 106,000 homes were sold in September, 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
In the Midwest, sales were off 11.7% to 83,000 units. Sales dropped 4.1% in the 
South to 212,000 units.

CANOGA PARK MAN KILLS 1 OF 3 ASSAILANTS IN ROBBERY ATTEMPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Canoga Park man shot and killed one of three assailants armed with shotguns 
when they forced their way into his house Monday night, causing the two other 
gunmen to flee and foiling what police described as an attempted robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Police today were hunting for the two suspects and investigating the death of 
Minnooie Pat Farjad, 19, who was found dead next to a 12-gauge shotgun in the 
house in the 8500 block of Fullbright Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not release the name of the 30-year-old man who allegedly shot 
Farjad or the names of two other men who were in the house at the time. Police 
said they were investigating the shooting, but said it appeared to be 
justified. 
</P>
<P>
According to LAPD Lt. Harvie Eubank, the incident began about 10:30 p.m. when 
the gunmen confronted a friend of the two men who lived in the house, described 
as construction workers who also worked on race cars at the residence. 
</P>
<P>
The friend, who was approaching a mobile home parked in the front yard to 
retrieve some clothes he had left there, was first ordered to lie on the 
ground, Eubank said. Then he was told he would be killed if he did not open the 
front door of the house, Eubank said. 
</P>
<P>
"He made enough noise that he tipped off his friends inside to what was going 
on," Eubank said. "One of them armed himself with a .38-caliber weapon." 
</P>
<P>
When the friend led the gunmen into the house, he saw one of the residents 
standing in the hallway with the gun and dropped to the floor, police said. The 
resident fired six shots, killing Farjad. The other gunmen, described as a 
black and a Latino, ran without firing a shot and drove away in a black 
Mustang, Eubank said.

MAN'S POCKET RADIO STOPS BULLET

<P>
A pocket radio stopped a bullet fired point-blank at a mugging victim's chest 
early today, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Lee, 24, was in a telephone booth at Gage Avenue and Broadway about 1:10 
a.m. calling for help after his car broke down when he was approached by two 
young men, one carrying a handgun, Sgt. Doug Tantee said. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked him for his wallet and he complied," Tantee said. "Nevertheless, 
the one with a gun put it right up over the left side of his chest, right over 
the heart, and fired once." 
</P>
<P>
Lee reeled from the impact and collapsed to the sidewalk, thinking he had been 
gravely wounded. But when paramedics ripped off his shirt, they found no 
wounds. On closer inspection, they found the slug embedded in the radio in his 
jacket's left breast pocket, Tantee said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee, a security guard, was unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
The assailants, described as 18 to 20 years old, escaped with the wallet, which 
contained $100, Tantee said.

Defending champion Garry Kasparov defeated Anatoly Karpov today to take a 
one-point lead in the World Chess Championship after Karpov resigned on the 
102nd move of the 16th game. 
</P>
<P>
The marathon contest ended after almost 12 1/2 hours of play that stretched 
over four days. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth-longest game in final round history. 
</P>
<P>
Kasparov has an 8 1/2-7 1/2 advantage in the match. The first player to gain 12 
1/2 points wins the championship and $1.7 million of the $3-million purse. In 
the event of a tie, Kasparov retains the title. The players had three draws 
previously in Lyon after 10 draws in 12 games in New York. There had been eight 
consecutive drawn games before Kasparov won.

Despite their sometimes being stereotyped as selfish and self-centered, 
American teen-agers do voluntary charitable work at about the same rate as 
adults, a study reported today. 
</P>
<P>
And, between trips to the mall and the movies, teen-agers also dig into their 
pockets to do good, with 48% contributing money to causes last year. 
</P>
<P>
The average total donated was $46. 
</P>
<P>
The findings, by Independent Sector, an umbrella group of voluntary, nonprofit 
groups and big donors, come on the heels of a mid-November survey that found a 
marked increase in giving and volunteering by the "baby boom" generation. 
</P>
<P>
The survey of American teens found that 58% volunteered in 1989, compared to 
54% of adults. Teens averaged 3.9 hours of volunteer time each week, and more 
than one-fourth of the teen volunteers gave five or more hours each week.

Prime Minister John Major's vision of a "society of opportunity" faces an 
immediate test from some Conservative Party members who are rebelling against a 
black lawyer selected as their candidate for Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
John Taylor, who hopes to be the first black Conservative in the House of 
Commons, was selected last weekend by the Tory organization in Cheltenham, near 
Gloucester in western England. 
</P>
<P>
Some Conservatives complained they were given no choice but Taylor, and one 
inflamed the controversy when he was quoted in a national newspaper as calling 
the candidate "a bloody nigger." 
</P>
<P>
William Galbraith, a Conservative Party member in Cheltenham, confirmed today 
that he had made the remark in a private conversation but had not expected to 
be quoted. 
</P>
<P>
Major, in his first major address to the Conservative Party organization today, 
said he supports Taylor.

President Hussain Mohammed Ershad bowed to an increasingly violent campaign for 
his ouster and agreed today to quit as soon as the opposition nominates a 
replacement, state radio said. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament will meet Saturday to try to choose a successor, the radio said in a 
late-night news bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
Ershad had offered Monday to step down shortly before elections scheduled for 
June, but the opposition, which had staged a seven-week campaign to drive him 
from office, rebuffed that offer and demanded he step down now. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old former army general took over Bangladesh, one of the world's 
poorest countries, in a bloodless coup in 1982. He had declared a state of 
emergency Nov. 27 to quash the opposition campaign seeking his ouster. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the announcement, hundreds of opposition workers thronged the 
streets of the capital, chanting slogans and setting off firecrackers.

federal thrift regulator in support of Charles H. Keating Jr.'s efforts to sell 
his troubled savings and loan shortly before it was seized by the government, 
the official said today. 
</P>
<P>
M. Danny Wall, former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, told the 
Senate Ethics Committee that Cranston called him several times and met with him 
just one week before Keating's Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan collapsed April 14, 
1989. Testifying in the case of the "Keating Five" senators, Wall said both 
Cranston and DeConcini urged prompt action on Keating's application to sell the 
thrift and that Cranston urged approval of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators rejected the sale on grounds the proposed buyers were actually 
associates of Keating and that Lincoln would not be made economically viable.

The western German economy continued to boom in the third quarter, sparked by 
increased domestic investments and high demand from the new eastern part of 
Germany, the Federal Statistics Office said today. 
</P>
<P>
Western Germany's gross national product soared 5.5% in the third quarter this 
year, compared to a year ago, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Increased investment activity within the country and high demand from eastern 
Germany, which became part of the Federal Republic on Oct. 3, boosted the GNP 
in the western part of the country, the report said.

<P>
Stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plummeted nearly 4% today as major 
players abandoned the field to margin selling and arbitrage. 
</P>
<P>
Trading remained light. 
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip Nikkei Average of 225 selected issues, which gained 271.36 points 
Monday, fell 863.38 points to close below the psychologically important 22,000 
mark at 21,862.61. 
</P>
<P>
But the figure many brokers pointed to was the low volume, which continued to 
dwindle as an estimated 240 million shares changed hands, down from 264 million 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, a year ago, when the Nikkei was racing toward an all-time high, 
volume on Dec. 4 was 1.2 billion shares.

Talks to revamp the world free trading system are very close to collapse, a 
U.S. trade official said today. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Rufus Yerxa, a deputy U.S. trade representative, told a news 
conference that the European Community had not responded to demands from most 
other countries for greater liberalization on farm trade. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite clear the ball is now in the community's court," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Australian Trade Minister Neal Blewett's statement that something 
had to give by day's end, Yerxa replied: "It is safe to say we share the 
concern of Minister Blewett of Australia that these negotiations are very close 
to collapse." 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, EC trade ministers were gathering in another building to discuss 
their position in talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a 
treaty pledging its members to free trade. 
</P>
<P>
Yerxa said it was "highly unlikely" there would be further negotiations unless 
the EC changed its position. No talks on the key farm trade question were 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Despite pressure from many sides on the Europeans for deep cuts in the EC's 
costly farm support programs, community officials showed no willingness to make 
new reductions in their agriculture offer at the 107-nation Uruguay Round, the 
most ambitious trade talks ever. 
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no hope of having an agreement this afternoon or even 
tomorrow afternoon -- but possibly by Friday," said Ray MacSharry, the farm 
chief of the 12-nation trading bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are locked in a make-or-break effort to overhaul the global trading 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive agreement they are seeking would lower trade barriers and 
write new rules covering trade in 15 areas, including agriculture, manufactured 
goods, textiles, trademarks and patents, and services, such as banking and 
telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
The Uruguay Round bargaining, which opened in 1986 in the Uruguayan resort of 
Punta del Este, has broken down in recent months because of a stubborn fight 
between the European Community and its major trading partners over government 
payments to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Many European farmers view the subsidy cuts as threatening their livelihood.

A looming global capital crunch will hit most Asian economies, except for 
Japan, in 1991, Merrill Lynch (Singapore) said in its latest Asian economic 
commentary report, released today. 
</P>
<P>
"A slowdown in United States and other OECD (Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development) economies, volatile energy prices, the prospects 
of a breakdown in the Uruguay Round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade) talks and a looming global capital crunch will make 1991 a difficult 
year for the Asian economies," Merrill Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
The countries surveyed were China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, South Korea, 
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
"Our latest estimates are that the 10 major Asian economies, outside Japan, 
will post an average real GDP (gross domestic product) growth of 4.7% in 1991, 
compared with 5.1% in 1990 and 5.7% in 1989," the report said.

EAST GERMAN CITES DOPING NASAL SPRAY; 
</P>
<P>
OLYMPICS: SWIMMER SAYS DRUG DEVELOPED BEFORE GAMES IN SEOUL WAS VIRTUALLY 
UNDETECTABLE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Experts in former East Germany developed a doping nasal spray before the 1988 
Olympics that was virtually undetectable, a leading swimmer alleged today. 
</P>
<P>
Raik Hannemann, who Monday admitted taking performance-enhancing drugs, said 
that the spray had the same effect as anabolic steroids and that traces of its 
use would disappear after three days. 
</P>
<P>
Hannemann and other athletes today accused former East German sports chiefs of 
developing a perfect, systematic doping program and of offering hard currency 
as an incentive for taking drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the magazine Stern said East German experts conducted experiments on 
athletes with drugs designed to improve their performances by influencing their 
nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
Hannemann, writing in a bylined article for the Berliner Kurier am Abend 
newspaper, said the nasal spray was developed by East German sports doctors. 
</P>
<P>
"This spray will make you unbeatable at the Olympics," Hannemann quoted the 
doctors as telling athletes. He said the doctors made it possible "that we 
never had any fear of (doping) controls." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Hannemann wrote in his column that he started taking anabolic 
steroids in 1985, at the urging of his club coach. "We all took them," he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Taking drugs, Hannemann wrote today, "was an obligation. A weapon in the class 
struggle. And many even believed it." 
</P>
<P>
He blamed Manfred Ewald, former chief of the East German Sports Federation, for 
urging athletes to take drugs. The federation was the all-powerful umbrella 
organization that ran East Germany's highly successful sports program. 
</P>
<P>
Joerg Woithe, the 1980 100-meter freestyle Olympic champion, told Sportecho 
that Ewald and his deputy Horst Roeder had urged athletes to take drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Woithe was quoted as saying that he was offered hard currency to take anabolic 
steroids before the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. He said the offer was made during 
talks with the president of his swimming club and an official from the sports 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
Woithe said the officials urged him to take steroids because they wanted him to 
swim the 100- and 200-meter races in addition to the 50-meter event in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Statements by Hannemann and Woithe could cast a cloud over the united German 
swimming team for the World Championships in Australia in January. 
</P>
<P>
Both men swam for Dynamo Berlin, and six Dynamo club members made the team at 
the first all-German championships in November. They include Olympic champions 
Daniela Hunger, Manuela Stellmach and Katrin Meissner.

Outfielder Eric Davis, who accused the Cincinnati Reds of appearing to forget 
about him when he was hospitalized after a World Series injury, has been 
reimbursed for the cost of his medically equipped return flight, Davis' agent 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Goldschmidt said Reds owner Marge Schott authorized reimbursement of about 
$18,000 for the specially equipped airplane that carried him from Oakland to 
Cincinnati after the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Goldschmidt said Reds General Manager Bob Quinn originally had declined to 
approve the reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as Marge learned all the details, she was willing to make the 
payment," Goldschmidt said. "The Reds didn't have to pay for it, following just 
the letter of the rules, but it's the sort of thing any professional 
organization would do for one of its players." 
</P>
<P>
The issue became a sore point for Davis, who said he thought the Reds had 
forgotten about him after he injured a kidney in the fourth game of the World 
Series and remained behind in an Oakland hospital for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Davis injured himself while making a diving attempt at a catch in left field. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Reds wouldn't return his phone calls as he lay in the Oakland 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Schott and Davis met privately Nov. 1 after Davis returned to Cincinnati, and 
they had a joint news conference the following day at Davis' home to tell 
reporters they had patched up their differences. 
</P>
<P>
"Time heals all wounds," Davis said then. "Marge took a big step in calling me, 
even if it was a little late."

Alfred Williams, the defensive leader for top-ranked Colorado, won the Butkus 
Award today as the nation's top linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a 6-foot-6, 236-pound senior from Houston, had 86 tackles and 12 1/2 
sacks this season. He also recovered a fumble, blocked a field goal and broke 
up five passes for the Buffaloes (10-1-1), who will play Notre Dame in the 
Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Williams edged Illinois' Darrick Brownlow for the award. Both players received 
six first-place votes, but Williams topped Brownlow 31-28 in points in voting 
by a panel of sports journalists and football experts. 
</P>
<P>
Players receive three points for a first-place vote, two for second and one for 
third. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame's Michael Stonebreaker finished third, followed by Miami's Maurice 
Crum and Clemson's Levon Kirkland. 
</P>
<P>
Stonebreaker received one first-place vote and 12 points, while Crum got five 
points and Kirkland two. 
</P>
<P>
Williams will be honored Saturday at the Downtown Athletic Club of Orlando, 
Fla., which sponsors the award.

Texas A&amp;M head football Coach R. C. Slocum has criticized CBS for picking 
up and broadcasting a play that the Aggies used for a crucial two-point 
conversion attempt against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The play failed and Texas held on to win, 28-27, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I disapprove of CBS. I think they are out of line to position themselves to 
gather information that could influence the outcome of the game," Slocum said 
Monday. "In the future, we will be more mindful of where their cameramen are." 
</P>
<P>
Robin Brendle, a spokeswoman for CBS Sports, said broadcasting the called play 
was inadvertent, but added, "A big part of our telecast is trying to get in the 
huddle and capture the essence of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Late in the fourth quarter, A&amp;M halfback Darren Lewis was stopped well 
short of the goal line on the play that would have given the Aggies a one-point 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Before the conversion play, the CBS national viewing audience heard A&amp;M 
plan and call the play on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
If the Texas coaches had heard that information, they could have adjusted their 
defense, according to several callers to radio talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Ross, assistant sports information director at Texas, said Longhorn 
coaches could not have heard the broadcast because they don't have their 
television sets turned on in the coach's booth at Memorial Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Ross said the sets are kept off for fear that a planned play may be broadcast. 
"We do it just for that reason," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Perkins, fired as coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, says he wants to 
return to college coaching, even if it's at a small school. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be somewhere where I can possibly make a difference with young 
people," he told The Birmingham News on Monday night from his home in Tampa, a 
few hours after losing his job.

VIDEO A 'CELEBRATION OF SEX' -- MADONNA 
</P>

ABC's "Nightline" today aired Madonna's too-hot-for-MTV video in its steamy 
entirety, and Madonna -- the picture of propriety in a buttoned-up black dress 
-- defended the clip as a "celebration of sex." 
</P>
<P>
"Why are we willing to deal with the reality of violence and sexism and why 
aren't we willing to deal with sexuality?" she asked in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to have censorship, let's not be hypocrites about this," the 
pop singer added. "Why is it OK for 10-year-olds to see someone's body being 
ripped to shreds? . . . Why do parents not have a problem with that?" 
</P>
<P>
Her "Justify My Love" video, which was rejected by the cable music station last 
week, features the bra-and-garter-belt-clad singer in an encounter with a 
lover, played by her real-life boyfriend, Tony Ward, in a Paris hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The video portrays the couple's fantasies, which run to bisexuality, voyeurism, 
group sex, cross-dressing and mild sadomasochism. 
</P>
<P>
"Half of me thought I was going to get away with it," said Madonna, speaking 
via satellite from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
She said the video -- with its chains, black leather and crucifixes -- was 
about "honesty . . . and the celebration of sex. There's nothing wrong with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
The video -- with some naughty bits electronically altered -- had appeared 
previously on NBC's "Saturday Night Live" and on CNN. It also was shown 
uncensored on The Jukebox Network, a pay-TV channel. 
</P>
<P>
Before it was shown on "Nightline," ABC lawyers screened the video, said Laura 
Wessner, a spokeswoman for the program. 
</P>
<P>
"They determined to go ahead with it because of the news value of the video, 
the late air time, and the focus of the discussion," Wessner said. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewer Forrest Sawyer asked Madonna to address herself to feminists who 
have criticized her boy-toy image. 
</P>
<P>
"I may be dressing like the typical bimbo, whatever, but I'm in charge," she 
answered. "I'm in charge of my fantasies, I put myself in these situations with 
men."

Residents pulled out their wallets -- and their best dance steps -- at a lively 
fund-raiser to help country singer Willie Nelson pay some of his back income 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 people attended the benefit Sunday night at the Broken Spoke 
nightclub, where Nelson began his climb to international stardom in the late 
1960s and early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson was not present at the hall. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done a lot of things for a lot of people. I think it's great that people 
want to help him," said Will Light, a Nelson fan. 
</P>
<P>
But while the event was expected to raise a tidy sum, with those attending 
paying $10 apiece for admission, it will not cut too deeply into Nelson's 
enormous tax bill. Internal Revenue Service officials say Nelson owes them 
$16.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS has seized properties Nelson owns in Colorado, Washington, Hawaii, 
Tennessee, Alabama and Texas, including his ranch and recording studio outside 
Austin, to satisfy two liens against him.

NBC REBOUNDS TO WIN THE RATINGS RACE;

<P>
TELEVISION: 'CHEERS' AND A STRONG SHOWING BY THE 'DECORATION DAY' SPECIAL LEAD 
THE NETWORK BACK FROM A NO. 2 SHOWING THE PREVIOUS WEEK.

It was only a repeat, but "Cheers" led a six-show attack that restored NBC to 
the top of the ratings race last week, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
After a No. 2 showing during Thanksgiving week, NBC surged back with a lineup 
that included the top-rated "Cheers," the Hallmark Hall of Fame production 
"Decoration Day," "The Cosby Show," "Different World," "Empty Nest" and 
"Matlock" -- all in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
CBS's "60 Minutes" was a strong second in the ratings, and the network's 
weighed in with two more top-10 shows, "Murder, She Wrote" and "Murphy Brown." 
ABC's only entry among the top 10 was "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
It was the eighth week out of the 11-week-old season that NBC has led the pack. 
CBS won the premier and World Series weeks and ABC won Thanksgiving week. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 7 showing by "Decoration Day," with a 17.9 rating and a 28 share, gave 
NBC the victory in the Sunday night movie war, easily outdistancing CBS's 
"Fatal Image," which tied for 30th place with a 14.1 rating and a 22 share, and 
ABC's "Commando," which was in 40th place with a 13.3 rating and a 20 share. 
</P>
<P>
The fisticuffs between Fox's "The Simpsons" and "The Cosby Show" went to NBC, 
at least in part because "Cosby" (fifth place) was an all-new show, while 
"Simpsons" (45th place) was a rerun of the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
Among new shows, CBS's "Evening Shade" with a 14.0 rating and a 22 share, was 
in 33rd place, overtaking NBC's "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," in 38th place with a 
13.6 rating and in a 21 share. The two shows were a virtual dead heat the 
previous week. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's score for the week was a 13.1 rating and a 21 share, ahead of ABC's 12.4 
rating and 20 share and CBS's 12.3 and 20 share. ABC, which was first the 
previous week, dropped from a whopping 13.4 rating and a 23 share. 
</P>
<P>
In the 11-week-old season-to-date statistics, NBC maintains its lead with a 
13.2 rating and 22 share, while ABC has moved into second with a 12.7 rating 
and a 21 share. CBS is just behind, with a 12.6 rating and a 21 share. 
</P>
<P>
Night-by-night competition saw NBC win Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, while 
ABC took Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and CBS captured Sunday.

RED SOX SIGN PITCHER YOUNG FOR $6.3 MILLION

<P>
In a move to rebuild their pitching staff, the Boston Red Sox today signed 
18-game loser Matt Young to a three-year contract for $6.35 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox were hurt when 17-game winner Mike Boddicker signed with Kansas 
City and came to the meetings looking for pitching help. 
</P>
<P>
With the signing of Young, Boston's rotation now shapes up as Roger Clemens, 
Dana Kiecker, Young, Greg Harris and Tom Bolton. Kiecker, Harris and Bolton all 
had surprisingly successful seasons in helping the Red Sox win the AL East. 
</P>
<P>
Young, 32, pitched for Seattle in 1990 and was 8-18 with a 3.51 earned-run 
average in 34 games. He is 51-78 lifetime with Seattle, Los Angeles and 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit Tigers were close to signing Young on Monday, but the Red Sox 
increased their offer late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
"We like his arm and we needed a left-hander," Boston General Manager Lou 
Gorman said. "We think most of his problems have been control." 
</P>
<P>
Young walked 107 batters in 225 1/3 innings last season and has walked 413 in 
956 lifetime innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I like his arm," Boston Manager Joe Morgan said. "I saw a guy who might be 
able to turn things around this year." 
</P>
<P>
Young tied a major-league record last season when he struck out four Red Sox in 
one inning last Sept. 9. He had a two-hitter July 18 vs. Toronto, a three-hit 
shutout vs. Texas and a three-hitter Aug. 9 against New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody on our team says this is a tough guy to face," Gorman said. "They 
never liked to see him come into Boston." 
</P>
<P>
In another free-agent acquisition, the Kansas City Royals today signed free 
agent reliever Dan Schatzeder to a one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Schatzeder, 36, was 1-3 with Houston in 45 games last season before being 
traded to the New York Mets on Sept. 10. The left-hander appeared in six games 
for the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Schatzeder is 69-68 lifetime in 14 seasons with Montreal, Detroit, 
Philadelphia, Minnesota, Cleveland, Houston and the Mets. He spent part of his 
career as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals came to the meetings looking for some help in the bullpen after 
Steve Farr signed with the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
The signings of Willie McGee, Terry Pendleton and Dennis Martinez on Monday 
have led to all sorts of other possibilities in the frenzied free agent market. 
</P>
<P>
With some of the big names now on the dotted line, serious bids might be 
finalized soon for Bob Welch, Teddy Higuera, Zane Smith and George Bell. 
</P>
<P>
McGee was the big winner on Monday when he signed a four-year deal for $13 
million with the San Francisco Giants. (Story, C1.)
