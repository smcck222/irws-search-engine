BEAUTY LIES IN VICTORY FOR AZTECS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT HOLBREICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Artistry, at least for now, is not what this San Diego State basketball team is 
about. 
</P>
<P>
Five games into a season with only one returning starter and eight new players, 
the Aztecs are a little ragged around the edges. But Monday night the beauty 
was in the result, not the performance. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs defeated Texas Tech, 51-50, in a nonconference game in front of 
1,797 at the San Diego Sports Arena. It was anything but a picture-book 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs shot 36.4% (16 of 44) from the field, went the final 9:25 without a 
field goal and needed two free throws by junior forward Shawn Jamison to go 
ahead with 16 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"We found a way to win," SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg said, "and that is what 
counts." 
</P>
<P>
But even the free throws were not-so-pretty. The first attempt rolled 
precariously on the back of the rim, almost coming to a stop, before falling 
through the hoop. The second one bounced not nearly as much, but enough, to 
keep Jamison guessing, before it, too, dropped through for the last of his 
game-high 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't sure about that first one," said Jamison, who also had a game-high 
nine rebounds. "I felt better about the second one." 
</P>
<P>
But the game was not over. The Aztecs (3-2) still had to hold off a final Texas 
Tech possession before they could claim their third victory in a row, their 
first against an NCAA Division I team. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Raiders (3-2) inbounded the ball in front of their bench with eight 
seconds to play and tried to get an open shot for guard Jerry Mason. But he was 
tightly guarded by the Aztecs and his off-balance, turn-around, 20-foot shot 
with two seconds left barely made it halfway to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was fitting that the Aztecs won the game with defense and at the 
free-throw line. Because, so far, that is what has been keeping them in most 
games. 
</P>
<P>
This time they held Texas Tech to 37.5% shooting from the field (18 of 48) and 
outscored the Red Raiders, 18-9, at the line. The difference was SDSU's 18 of 
22 free-throw shooting as their only four points in the final 9:25 came at the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
The tight finish was not what the Aztecs appeared headed for in the early part 
of the first half. They started as if they were going to make an easy night of 
it against a traveling Texas Tech team that was playing its third game in four 
nights in a city 2,000 miles away from its last stop Saturday night in 
Clarksville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU took its first lead at 7-4 just 2:35 into the game on a three-point play 
by center Marty Dow and stretched its advantage to 21-10 with 10:02 left in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
But then the Aztecs went into another of the scoring dry spells that have 
marked their early-season games. They went 5:41 without a point, missing nine 
shots and committing three turnovers while the Red Raiders scored 11 points in 
a row to tie the game at 21-21 with 5:30 to play in the half. Nine of those 
points came on three three-point field goals. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs awoke just in time to reverse the rally by scoring the next seven 
points to take a 28-21 lead with 2:05 remaining and held a 30-23 edge at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
They started the second half again as if they were going to close out the Red 
Raiders, taking a 44-31 lead on a three-point play by Jamison with 13:09 left. 
But, as has been their custom, the Aztecs suddenly went cold from the field. 
</P>
<P>
They scored only one field goal the rest of the way -- Jamison's dunk with 9:25 
to play -- as Texas Tech came back to go ahead, 50-48, on guard Derex Butts' 
driving four-foot jumper with 2:16 left. Jamison, who scored the Aztecs' final 
10 points, made the first of two free-throw attempts with 1:52 remaining to 
draw SDSU within, 50-49. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs got the ball back after forward Steve Miles missed an eight-footer 
with 50 seconds left and guard Arthur Massey rebounded. 
</P>
<P>
Jamison missed a reverse layup with 20 seconds left. But the Aztecs got another 
chance when Jamison was tied up on the rebound with 18 seconds left and the 
alternate possession arrow went in favor of SDSU. They again tried to set up a 
play for Jamison and this time he was fouled by Miles with 16 seconds to play. 
But after missing two of his previous four free throws, Jamison dropped two 
through. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told myself, 'Make these and we have the game,' " Jamison said. "And 
that's what I did."

MORNING BRIEFING: PLAYER WANTS TO BRING MOM, SO FATHER-SON AFFAIR CANCELED

The father-son banquet honoring the football team at Mohawk Trail Regional High 
in Buckland, Mass., an annual event since 1968, has been canceled. Quarterback 
Owa Brandstein said he wouldn't go if his mother couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people supporting us through hard times were mothers, but they 
couldn't come to our banquet," Brandstein said. "It's blatant discrimination. 
It's just wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Howard Binder, a co-founder of the group that sponsors the banquet, said Monday 
that the banquet was canceled after the guest list became an issue. He said the 
father-son format was used because the hall that his group used for the banquet 
wouldn't hold a bigger crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Brandstein's parents, Marcine and Stewart Eisenberg, said they supported their 
son. 
</P>
<P>
"We said to Owa, 'Look, this is your only senior year. You don't have to do 
this for us,' " Marcine Eisenberg said. "He just said, 'But it's wrong.' " 
</P>

Ralphie III, the school's mascot who is actually a female, will be traveling 
from Boulder, Colo., to Miami for the Orange Bowl. And she needs accommodations 
en route.

Her needs are simple; about five pounds of grass will do for dinner. And if you 
would like to give her stay an old-home-week touch, have a horse on hand. An 
orphan, Ralphie III was raised on a baby bottle. She grew up thinking a horse 
was her mother. 
</P>
<P>
A shot at J.R.: J.R. Richard, whose career with the Houston Astros was ended by 
a stroke, was cut by the West Palm Beach Tropics of the Senior League because 
he weighed more than 300 pounds. Said Bill Lee, player-manager of the Winter 
Haven Super Sox: "I see where Richard claims he throws 90 miles an hour. Maybe 
he does, providing he's throwing out of a car going 60." 
</P>
<P>
The present tense: New York Giant nose tackle Erik Howard, after the club had 
committed five turnovers in a 24-17 loss to the Eagles Sunday: "We gave it to 
them. It was ridiculous. It's tough when the defense gives up three points and 
they end up getting 27. Merry Christmas, Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
A day at the office: University of Maryland forward Jerrod Mustaf, on the hype 
surrounding the ACC-Big East Challenge this week: "People who sit on 
committees, who run the ACC and the Big East, build these things up because it 
puts money in their pockets. To me it's just another game." 
</P>
<P>
He's not alone: The New Jersey Nets' recent five-game West Coast swing featured 
franchise records for fewest points in a quarter, seven; a half, 25, and a 
game, 68. Sam Bowie, a first-year Net, said, "It's to a point where it's even 
difficult to think of yourself as a professional athlete."

SEAHAWKS SWOOP PAST THE BILLS; 
</P>
<P>
SEATTLE: A 51-YARD, FOURTH-QUARTER PASS PLAY, KRIEG-TO-WILLIAMS, PROVIDES A 
17-16 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
With one play, John L. Williams turned a personally miserable night into 
something special. 
</P>
<P>
Until Dave Krieg and Williams combined on Seattle's longest play of the season, 
a 51-yard touchdown pass with 5:38 remaining Monday night, Williams, the 
Seahawks fullback, couldn't get out of his own way, much less away from 
Buffalo's tacklers. But his big play lifted the Seahawks past the sputtering 
Buffalo Bills, 17-16. 
</P>
<P>
"He was in a spot where I thought he might be," Krieg said. "I was hoping we'd 
do something like that. 
</P>
<P>
"I waved him up and he caught it. The linebacker was on him tight. We've done 
that before." 
</P>
<P>
It was a fine improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
"You look to do it by design, if you can," Krieg said. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally made some plays," Seahawks coach Chuck Knox said after his team 
snapped a four-game slide. "At the end, when we had to have it against what I 
think is one of the best defenses in football, John L. made it." 
</P>
<P>
Williams made just as quick a dash out of the dressing room, refusing to talk 
to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had good effort but we haven't made the plays you have to make to 
win," Knox added. "We made them tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Krieg made many of them, particularly on the touchdown to Williams. In his 
first start after being benched for two games, Krieg avoided a heavy rush and 
lobbed the ball over linebacker Ray Bentley. Williams grabbed it at the 35, 
rumbled down the right sideline, got a block from Brian Blades and ran over 
Nate Odomes and into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in a 'red dog,' a five-man blitz," Bentley said. "He was my man all 
the way. He went into the flat and cut upfield. I thought I had good position 
but he has good speed, and he just ran away from me." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Krieg hit rookie tight end Travis McNeal on a similar play for 48 
yards, the team's biggest play of 1989 until the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
The loss damaged Buffalo's chances of catching Denver for the best record in 
the AFC. The Bills (8-5) still lead the AFC East by one game over Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way in the world we should lose games like that," Buffalo nose 
tackle Fred Smerlas said. "You can't have guys throw dink passes for big plays. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the game by six points and they hadn't scored since the first quarter. 
We have to go for the jugular when we've got them down." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle (5-8) clinched the victory -- and Buffalo's fourth successive road loss 
-- when M. L. Johnson recovered a fumble by Larry Kinnebrew. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a minus-14 turnover ratio, and that is not our team," Knox said. 
"Tonight, we got one of those turnovers when we needed it." 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo had taken a 16-10 lead on field goals of 32, 40 and 43 yards by Scott 
Norwood. But he missed from 48 yards just before Krieg hit Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, defensive end Art Still made the first interception of his career to 
set up a field goal, and Jim Kelly hit Andre Reed, the AFC's leading receiver, 
for a 61-yard score. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle moved smartly to its opening score, a 29-yard field goal by Norm 
Johnson. Krieg hit Curt Warner for 13 yards and Steve Largent for 24, extending 
the NFL's all-time leading receiver's record consecutive-game streak with a 
catch to 174. 
</P>
<P>
Then Krieg and McNeal combined on the 48-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Skansi caught an 11-yard pass before Warner scored from the 1, just his 
third touchdown this season -- he's averaged 10 in his five full seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Largent continued his heroics when he ran left, untouched, into the end zone 
for the extra point after Norm Johnson stumbled.

Sparked by their defense, the Portland Trail Blazers pulled away in the second 
half Monday night to defeat the Orlando Magic, 121-95, in the National 
Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers outscored Orlando, 66-44, in the second half to push their

outscored Orlando, 29-14, in the first eight minutes of the third quarter to 
take an 84-65 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Portland's swarming defense made the difference, cutting off the Magic's inside 
game in the second half. The Trail Blazers also got their running game going, 
scoring 26 points on fast-break opportunities after intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Kersey and Duckworth, Portland got double-figure scoring from Clyde 
Drexler with 18 points, Buck Williams and Terry Porter each with 16 and rookie

A fallaway bank shot by Dennis Scott, who scored 42 points, gave No. 18 Georgia 
Tech a 93-92 victory over No. 22 Pittsburgh Monday night at Hartford, Conn., in 
the opening game of the Big East-ACC Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who made eight of 14 three-point shots, took a pass near the lane with 
four seconds left and then drove toward the basket, pulling up for the 
game-winning shot. 
</P>
<P>
"Dennis Scott put on a performance not like too many people are going to see 
too often," Pitt Coach Paul Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Matthews, formerly of St. Monica High, had given Pitt a 92-91 lead, 
making a pair of free throws with nine seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
But Georgia Tech (3-0) advanced the ball to midcourt and called a timeout to 
set up the winning play for Scott, a junior swingman who has scored 101 points 
in three games. 
</P>

HYUNDAI WILL BUILD CONTAINER PLANT IN TIJUANA; 
</P>
<P>
MAQUILADORAS: SOUTH KOREAN COMPANY IS THE SECOND HEAVY-INDUSTRY FIRM TO 
ANNOUNCE PLANS IN BAJA IN THE WAKE OF RELAXED MEXICAN GUIDELINES.

Hyundai Precision &amp; Industries of South Korea, the world's largest 
manufacturer of seagoing shipboard containers and chassis, disclosed plans 
Monday to build a 28-acre plant in Tijuana that may eventually employ up to 
1,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
Hyundai's planned move into the El Florido business park about 5 miles east of 
downtown Tijuana makes it the second heavy industrial company to plan a plant 
in Baja California in the wake of liberalized investment guidelines announced 
by the Mexican government last summer. The guidelines enable foreigners to own 
100% of Mexican corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana-Pacific, a Portland, Ore.-based lumber company, began construction 
last month on a large plant in El Sauzal, north of Ensenada, where it will dry 
and plane rough-cut redwood timber barged down from Northern California. Most 
of the redwood will then be shipped back, mainly for sale in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
With 1988 sales of $1.2 billion, Hyundai Precision &amp; Industries controls 
about 35% of the worldwide steel shipboard container market. The containers 
measure from 20 feet to 53 feet in length and are sold to shipping companies, 
said B. M. Ahn, president of Hyundai Precision America, the company's U.S. 
subsidiary based in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Y. K. Youm, a Hyundai Precision &amp; Industries official, said in a telephone 
interview from Seoul that Hyundai selected the Tijuana site to take advantage 
of the low costs of labor and to be close to the U.S. market. The plant will be 
in operation by next November, and, once fully operational, should produce up 
to 3,000 containers and 500 chassis a month, Youm said. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of construction will contain 270,000 square feet in three 
buildings, at a cost of $10 million, but a second phase could double the square 
footage, Youm said. 
</P>
<P>
Hyundai Precision &amp; Industries is one of 30 independent South Korean 
companies, including Hyundai Motor, under the symbolic Hyundai Business Group 
umbrella, Ahn said. 
</P>
<P>
The El Florido industrial park is a 200-acre development of San Diego Baja, a 
Solana Beach-based real estate development firm whose principals include Hugh 
McCaffrey and Paul Scheibe. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, McCaffrey declined to identify his firm's financial backers, 
but did say the park will be financed partly through a "debt swap," a technique 
by which foreigners buy Mexican debt and exchange it for pesos at a heavily 
discounted rate, under the proviso that the pesos be reinvested into 
preapproved projects in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The Hyundai plant received government approval for the debt swap in part 
because the plant will provide jobs mainly to men. A criticism of the 
maquiladora boom has been that an estimated 90% of the light industrial jobs it 
has created have been taken by women. 
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey said Hyundai was drawn to the El Florido business park in part 
because of its access to the San Diego &amp; Imperial Valley Railroad, a line 
running through the property that connects San Diego with Tijuana and Tecate. 
Although Hyundai's first plans are to transport most of its finished containers 
by truck to Los Angeles, the company will eventually use the rail line to 
deliver products to more distant destinations in the United States, Youm said. 
</P>
<P>
Hyundai once operated a container manufacturing plant in Long Beach, but closed 
it in October because of the relatively high cost of U.S. labor, Ahn said. Youm 
said the South Korean company expects to pay workers an average hourly wage of 
$1.30, contrasted with the $12.60 it would pay to hourly workers in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Construction on the plant will begin in February, Youm said. At its opening, 
the plant should employ 1,000 workers.

Eastern Machinists Cite New Dialogue: The leader of the Eastern Airlines 
machinists, whose walkout is in its 10th month, said there is new dialogue with 
management but that his membership remains committed to the strike. "There's no 
way you can just blink away the trauma that people have been through," Charles 
E. Bryan, president of the machinists District 100, said in Hollywood, Fla. 
Bryan said he had a three-hour meeting last Thursday in Washington with Eastern 
officials and federal mediator Harry Bickford. All agreed "that nobody will put 
any spins on it," Bryan said. "We met, and we'll have more meetings."

MISS MANNERS: HE'S TOO OLD TO GET THE PICTURE FOR CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- I am 22 years old and the oldest of five children; the 
others are 19, 17, 12 and 4. I graduated from college last May and was 
commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force in June. I have been 
living at home for the last six months, working while waiting for my military 
assignment. 
</P>
<P>
Yesterday my mother came to me and said she wanted to take a picture of "the 
children" to send out on Christmas cards. I tried nicely to tell her that I 
would be humiliated to have Christmas cards sent with my picture on them. I 
said I would be much more comfortable sending a family picture, if we had to 
send a picture. She could not understand my embarrassment about sending a 
children's picture. 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Secretly, Miss Manners has misgivings about 
look-how-they've-grown cards. If circulation were limited to people who know 
the children, especially to those who don't often see them and would value an 
annual picture, these would be fine. 
</P>
<P>
In your case, however, we are dealing with the feelings of the sender -- your 
mother. So Miss Manners entreats you to be a sport while you're still at home 
during the picture-taking session. 
</P>
<P>
Your idea about a full family picture is an excellent one. 
</P>
<P>
She has another suggestion: In the group portrait, take the 4-year-old on your 
lap. Rather than wondering what you are doing in a children's picture at your 
age, people will murmur, "I didn't realize Lee was already old enough to have a 
child." 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS: I've found a way to avoid giving out my telephone number. A 
few years ago, I wanted an unlisted number, but did not want to pay the 
additional fee, so I put the account in the name of my bird, Ferd Nurd. 
</P>
<P>
That name was listed in the phone book, and led to very amusing phone calls, 
usually around 11:30 on a Saturday night, from strangers, with loud music in 
the background. They always wanted to talk to Ferd. Also, Ferd received a 
credit card from the phone company. I hung it in his cage. 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Miss Manners is always happy to hear of methods to achieve 
privacy from that intrusive instrument, the telephone. She congratulates you 
and commiserates with your bird on its rowdy friends. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS: My husband and I have discovered a restaurant that has live 
piano music during Sunday brunch. Since I would like to encourage the pianists, 
I have applauded whenever they played something I particularly liked. I have 
noticed that only a few other people applaud, and usually only after I do. Am I 
committing a breach of etiquette? Should I confine my encouragement to a few 
remarks when I am leaving the restaurant? 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Could you open those confines to include a small contribution 
as well? Tipping is one of the differences between the etiquette of music 
appreciation at a restaurant and that appropriate to a concert. 
</P>
<P>
By applauding, you encourage concert manners, and suggest to sensitive fellow 
diners that they really shouldn't be talking during brunch (which is one of the 
things they came there to do). Therefore, it is customary for an especially 
appreciative patron to catch the eye of the performer after a selection, smile 
and move the hands in silent applause.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: DISCIPLINE STYLES NEED BALANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My father-in-law is an old-time military man and a believer 
in firm discipline -- the "do-what-you're-told-because-you're-told" type. My 
husband is of the "laid-back-who-cares" style and I'm in between. We have two 
children and I'm constantly trying to figure out what type of discipline is 
best. -- A.L. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR A.L.: There's a difference between authoritarian and authoritative 
discipline. Authoritarian discipline, such as that of your father-in-law, 
doesn't stimulate or prepare the youngster to be able to think on his own, 
while the authoritative discipline, that which lets the child know what is 
expected and explains why this is correct behavior, teaches the child how to 
think and make good decisions when the parents aren't around. 
</P>
<P>
Authoritative parenting requires more effort than the traditional do-as-I-say 
discipline, but the results eventually pay off. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologist Diana Baumrind and colleagues at University of California at 
Berkeley tracked children from preschool to high school to see what effects 
their parents' discipline style had on their characters. Both youngsters of 
authoritarian and permissive parents had low self-esteem. Those of permissive 
parents were immature, had a hard time getting along with peers, tended to be 
promiscuous and had the heaviest drug use. Children raised by authoritarian 
parents were also immature and scored the poorest on verbal and math 
achievement. Children with authoritative parents were outstandingly 
well-adjusted, mature, happy, motivated and independent. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I can't understand why my 7-year-old daughter has taken to 
hitting and abusing her dolls. She used to love them and now she seems to 
delight in throwing them around and treating them badly. She's never been 
physically abused that I know of, and in every other way, she's a sweet, 
charming little girl. -- W.S. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR W.S.: Maybe part of the problem is that she feels she has to be sweet in 
order to be loved. She may not be able to express her angry feelings in any 
other way. Little girls are often not able to deal with anger directly. 
According to Dr. Helen De Rosis, an associate clinical professor of psychiatry 
at New York University, this is due to subtle differences in the way children 
are raised. 
</P>
<P>
While little boys are encouraged to stand up for themselves and fight, little 
girls usually aren't permitted to punch, scream and yell; it's not ladylike. 
Girls are often expected to be timid and passive, while boys are allowed more 
leniency when it comes to anger. Both little boys and little girls have a right 
to be angry, but both need to be shown how to find constructive ways to express 
it.

DISPARITY IN DISORDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: When it comes to eating disorders, I don't see why the patients are 
almost always women and seldom men. What can there possibly be about food that 
would make women more likely to have a problem with it than men? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: A number of men may undergo strenuous dieting for sports-related 
reasons, but this unusual concern does not bring them to the attention of a 
physician in the same fashion that women would be if they also were extremely 
concerned about their weight. For example, young men who participate in 
wrestling often show a yo-yo pattern of dieting, alternating weight loss with 
weight gain. This can have harmful effects, but the individual involved does 
not seek medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the apparent disparity in the incidence of eating disorders 
between men and women is that symptoms that may identify women as having an 
eating disorder do not apply to men. For example, cessation of menstruation, 
which helps diagnose an eating disorder in women, cannot be used to diagnose an 
eating disorder in men.

MAHONY VOWS NOT TO BE INTIMIDATED BY GAYS; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: ARCHBISHOP RESPONDS TO VANDALISM AT CHURCHES. ACTIVISTS SAY THEIR 
ANGER OVER WHAT THEY VIEW AS CHURCH INTERFERENCE IN ISSUES IS MOUNTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The day after four Roman Catholic churches were spattered with red paint by gay 
activists angry over the church's condemnation of the use of condoms for safe 
sex, Archbishop Roger M. Mahony said he would not be "intimidated by threats or 
attacks." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, AIDS and abortion rights activists said that anger toward what they 
call the church's interference in public health policy issues is mounting. The 
groups said they were planning demonstrations at four other Los Angeles 
Catholic churches on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Posters of Mahony with the word "murderer" printed in large letters were posted 
at the four churches that were spattered with red paint Sunday morning. "Safe 
sex is a lie and a fraud" was printed above the pictures, a reference to 
Mahony's statement last month at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops 
meeting in Baltimore that rejected the use of condoms as a means of fighting 
the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
A group calling itself Greater Religious Responsibility, or GRR, claimed 
responsibility for the vandalism, but as of late Monday, no one had been 
arrested in connection with the incidents. Authorities and AIDS advocates say 
it is the first time they have heard of this organization. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony, in a written statement Monday, said the acts of vandalism do not change 
the church's position that chastity, rather than the use of condoms, is the 
only "morally correct and medically secure way" to prevent the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"It is both sad and ironic that those who will not accept God's revelation as 
taught faithfully by the Catholic Church with respect to human sexuality would 
attack God's houses within Los Angeles," Mahony said. "Neither I nor the 
Archdiocese will be intimidated by threats or attacks against proclaiming the 
truth as God has taught." 
</P>
<P>
But he also said the church's position on chastity and condoms does not mean an 
end to compassion and understanding for those suffering from AIDS or infected 
with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to condemn discrimination against all who are affected by 
HIV, and we will continue to increase our many pastoral and care outreach 
efforts to all so affected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS activist Mark Kostopoulos, reacting to Mahony's statement, said: "We don't 
need compassion when we are sick and dying. What we need is help in staying 
alive." Kostopoulos is a member of ACT UP, or AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, 
which disavowed any involvement in Sunday's vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Norman, another ACT UP member, said her group is opposed to the church 
attempting to set public health policy. She pointed out that the church is 
preaching chastity over condoms while countless health experts, including 
former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, have said that the use of condoms 
is an effective way to cut down on the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
ACT UP is helping to organize the "informational pickets" next Sunday, where 
AIDS and pro-choice activists will pass out literature disputing the church's 
position to those attending Mass at La Placita Church in downtown Los Angeles, 
St. Francis of Assisi on Golden Gate Avenue, Blessed Sacrament on Sunset 
Boulevard and Church of the Good Samaritan in Beverly Hills, a spokesman for 
the group said. 
</P>
<P>
The picketing is planned in conjunction with a "Stop the Church" demonstration 
at New York City's St. Patrick's Cathedral on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
National ACT UP organizers said they want to send the "Catholic Church 
hierarchy a clear message: Stop peddling your religion's morality. . . . This 
chronic meddling is a violation of the legal separation of church and state."

MCMARTIN VERDICTS WILL BE HELD BACK; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: JURORS' APPEALS PERSUADE THE JUDGE IN THE MOLESTATION CASE TO WAIT 
UNTIL AFTER WINTER BREAK TO UNSEAL THEIR DECISIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to jurors' concerns, the judge in the McMartin Pre-School 
molestation trial said Monday he will not unseal and announce any verdicts 
before the panel's scheduled vacation Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
"They are just under incredible pressure," said Los Angeles Superior Court 
Judge William Pounders. 
</P>
<P>
Pounders previously had announced his intent to make verdicts public in 
batches, rather than wait for decisions on all 65 counts of molestation and 
conspiracy against Ray Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the jury has turned in only one verdict -- thought by Pounders to 
relate to the child whose allegations triggered the case -- and the judge had 
said he would announce it and any others received on or before Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
But several jurors, upon learning of the plan from friends, complained 
privately to Pounders on Friday that it was affecting their deliberations and 
that they feared feedback from family, friends and neighbors during their 
two-week break. The jury is not sequestered. 
</P>
<P>
Pounders' unusual plan to take verdicts piecemeal was intended to avoid a 
complete mistrial should any of the remaining jurors become unable to continue. 
Due to illness and other problems, none of the six alternates remain. 
</P>
<P>
The defense had also opposed the taking of partial verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
The trial, which had been expected to last no longer than one year, is now in 
its third year. The toll it has taken on the jury and other participants "shows 
in their faces," Pounders commented. 
</P>
<P>
He said the jury appears to be deliberating counts relating to the fourth of 11 
alleged child victims, but that it is withholding its decisions. He had ordered 
that they sign, date, seal and turn over to the court clerk each verdict as it 
is reached. 
</P>
<P>
With only one verdict in after four weeks of deliberations, it is unlikely that 
the jury will complete its work by the end of next week. In that event, all the 
verdicts would be announced at the same time.

IN THE SOUTHLAND, A POWER CHRISTMAS; 
</P>
<P>
URBAN SCENE: THE SKYSCRAPER 'TREE' IS A FIXTURE IN LOS ANGELES. HERE, SANTA'S 
HELPERS ARE NOT ELVES, THEY'RE ELECTRICIANS.

Dennis Hooper didn't take his assignment lightly. 
</P>
<P>
He had strung 36,000 tiny white electric bulbs around the six-story lobby of 
the Westin Bonaventure in Los Angeles as the centerpiece of the hotel's 
Christmas display. Now, as 1,000 onlookers stood by, it was time to throw the 
switch and dramatically turn them on. 
</P>
<P>
This presented a technical challenge: The lights were hooked up to 1,200 plugs 
that Hooper had wired into eight electrical breaker panels scattered around the 
South Figueroa Street hotel. The oversized "switch" that two child actors were 
about to press was a fake. 
</P>
<P>
As the crowd counted down from 10 for actors Danny Pintauro, 13, and Alex 
Burrall, 6, Hooper, who is house electrician for the hotel, whispered his own 
countdown into a walkie-talkie. 
</P>
<P>
On Hooper's cue, eight hidden hotel engineering workers secretly tripped the 
circuit box switches in unison Thursday night and all 36,000 lights blinked to 
life. A cheer went up from the crowd. A sigh of relief went up from Hooper. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, it was beginning to look a lot like Christmas in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In a city where palms are more common than pines, electric Christmas trees 
herald the season from office rooftops and shopping center plazas. Santa's 
helpers in Los Angeles are electricians, not elves. 
</P>
<P>
Their enemies are bulb-snatchers, Santa Ana winds and those irritating strands 
of Christmas lights that go out when one bulb comes loose or burns out. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the huge light displays have become local traditions. 
</P>
<P>
The 99-foot-tall star-topped electric tree atop the Capitol Records building 
has been a fixture in Hollywood since 1957. Its 4,374 lights blaze with 109,235 
watts that can be seen on clear nights throughout much of the Los Angeles 
Basin. 
</P>
<P>
The tree's location atop the 13-story circular Vine Street building is so 
precarious that 65-year-old steeplejack Paul Gavlak of Woodland Hills is hired 
annually to put it up and take it down. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing burned-out bulbs is all but impossible once the lights go up. So 
Capitol's building engineer Jerry Rodiger spends about 40 hours each November 
screwing brand-new bulbs into each of the 4,374 sockets. 
</P>
<P>
To keep wind whipping through the nearby Cahuenga Pass from breaking the bulbs, 
springs have been attached to the bottom of each of the 36 light strands. That 
holds them taut and prevents them from slapping into each other, said John 
Piro, Capitol's chief building engineer. 
</P>
<P>
"The Capitol tree is one of the few things to see in Hollywood at 
Christmastime," said Mark Willoughby, manager of bookshop off Hollywood 
Boulevard. "I look forward to it every year helping put me in the Christmas 
spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale residents feel the same way about their tree -- a 97-foot electric 
conifer atop Glendale Federal that also dates to 1957. 
</P>
<P>
"It does a lot for Glendale. People here look forward to it every year," said 
Alice Olney, who has lived in the city since 1935. 
</P>
<P>
Bank building engineer Bob Brady said the tree is lit from Thanksgiving to Jan. 
2. Each of its 125 strands uses 150 bulbs. The whole thing is attached to a 
helicopter landing pad 390 feet above Brand Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Santa Ana winds virtually stripped the tree bare before Christmas 
Day, Brady said. "We used up 15 cases of replacements" -- a total of 1,125 
spare bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
"The tree has to be lit promptly at 5 p.m. every day," Brady said. "If it's 
late, we'll have gotten 100 phone calls by 5:15 from people wanting to know 
what's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The tree is "the pride and joy" of Glendale Federal Chairman Raymond Edwards, 
who has ordered similar displays at the firm's 36 other branches in Southern 
California, Brady said. The one on the Beverly Hills branch towers 137 feet; a 
highly visible tree atop the Sherman Oaks branch next to the Ventura Freeway is 
85 feet tall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Woodland Hills, a 1,000-bulb tree has been anchored for six Christmas 
holidays atop the 20-story Warner Plaza One building on Oxnard Street. The 
40-foot display can be seen throughout much of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The building's nine engineers are paid $4,000 to come in on a weekend each 
November to install the tree, said engineering staff member Michelle Fornshell. 
This year, however, the workers voted to donate the overtime fee for toys for 
under-privileged children who have written Santa Claus through the Van Nuys 
Post Office, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown Los Angeles is brightened by a 117-foot-tall electric atop the Unocal 
Center. It uses 2,600 bulbs and has been attached to a microwave tower above 
the building every year except one since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they lighted it in 1973 during the energy crisis," said Barry 
Lane, a spokesman for the oil company. Lane said he can see the tree's 40-watt 
orange-and-white bulbs from his home in La Crescenta. 
</P>
<P>
You won't see a Christmas tree in City Hall this year, however, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A new City Council policy prohibits displays in the ornate City Hall rotunda 
unless the decorations relate to municipal functions, said Greg Wilkins, 
director of special projects for the Department of General Services. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, this year's "official city Christmas tree" is located in a 
downtown shopping mall about a mile from City Hall. It is a $5,000, 75-foot 
white-tip fir that stands outside a 53-story office building at Citicorp Plaza 
on South Figueroa Street. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Sowa, the plaza's chief engineer, watched nervously last week as Mayor Tom 
Bradley stepped forward to press a button to light the tree's 5,000 bulbs. 
Bradley joked to a crowd of about 1,000 that the lights refused to come on four 
years ago when he threw the switch. Happily for Sowa, who supervised the 
installation and wiring of the tree, the switch worked this time. 
</P>
<P>
For his own Anaheim home, Sowa said he plans to decorate the same tree he 
always does -- a 20-year-old artificial one. "It has the same effect," he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Hooper, who installed the 36,000 white lights at the Bonaventure, will hang 
only a few strands of lights on the Christmas tree at his Tarzana home. And 
they won't be white lights. 
</P>
<P>
His wife feels colored lights are more festive. And she should know, Hooper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Her name is Mary Noel," he said. "She was born on Christmas Eve."

BOY'S SUIT OVER SLAYING IS DISMISSED; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIL RIGHTS: THE CHILD WAS UNBORN WHEN POLICE KILLED HIS BANK-ROBBER FATHER 
AND WOUNDED HIS MOTHER. THEREFORE, HE HAS NO LEGAL STANDING TO SUE, A JUDGE 
RULES.

<P>
John Henry Crumpton IV was a fetus in his mother's womb in 1982 when undercover 
Los Angeles police detectives wounded her and killed his father after watching 
the couple rob a bank. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson dismissed a lawsuit brought 
against the Los Angeles Police Department in behalf of John Crumpton, now 7, 
concluding that the boy was unborn at the time of his father's death and thus 
had no legal standing to later sue. 
</P>
<P>
The $10-million lawsuit, filed by Crumpton's aunt, alleged that the officers 
had violated the boy's civil rights by depriving him of his father. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, in essence, declined to challenge a narrow body of existing case law, 
most notably Roe vs. Wade, in which various courts have held that a fetus is 
not a person and, therefore, not entitled to protections under U.S. civil 
rights laws. The issue has become a flash point in the national debate over 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether (they) are correct or incorrect . . . those other cases are 
well-reasoned," Wilson said in granting a motion by Assistant City Atty. Jack 
L. Brown to throw out the Crumpton case. 
</P>
<P>
The boy sued the Police Department in October, 1988, after The Times published 
a series of articles revealing the little-known activities of the LAPD's 
Special Investigations Section. 
</P>
<P>
The Times found that teams of well-armed SIS detectives had, for years, tailed 
career criminals but often ignored opportunities to prevent armed robberies and 
burglaries by legitimately arresting suspects beforehand on lesser crimes or 
outstanding warrants. Instead, records showed, the officers routinely stood by 
until the suspects they were watching had committed violent crimes. Many 
suspects were shot when they returned to their getaway cars. 
</P>
<P>
One of those cases involved John Crumpton III and his wife, Jane Elizabeth 
Berry. The couple, both paroled bank robbers, had been linked by witnesses to 
five bank robberies and already were wanted on federal felony warrants for 
parole violations. 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, they could have been arrested at any time on the federal 
warrants, but because investigators said they could not conclusively link the 
couple to the robberies, the SIS was assigned to shadow them. After 18 days of 
intermittent surveillance, during which the suspects stole a car, the 
detectives in September, 1982, watched Berry and Crumpton don masks and rob a 
bank in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
The detectives confronted the couple at their getaway car. Police reports 
contend that both bandits "whirled" toward the officers after being ordered to 
put their hands up. Four SIS officers armed with shotguns fired a total of 18 
times, striking both Crumpton and Berry repeatedly in the back, records show. 
</P>
<P>
Crumpton was unarmed but was wearing a holster on his belt, which officers said 
they mistook for a weapon. Berry had a semiautomatic pistol but it was not 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
Berry later pleaded guilty to robbery and was sentenced to state prison. She 
will be eligible for parole in 1993 but faces another 44 months in federal 
custody for the parole violations. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, attorney Stephen Yagman, who is representing the Crumpton boy, said 
he intends to appeal Wilson's ruling.

UNCLAIMED BOXES: GOING, GOING, SOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The contents of safe deposit boxes left dormant for five years got new life 
Monday, when they were sold at a state-run auction presided over by State 
Controller Gray Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the auction, held in West Hollywood, came early in the 
proceedings when Beverly Hills art dealer Louis Stern plunked down $2,500 for a 
baseball autographed by Babe Ruth. He hopes to sell it to a Tokyo real estate 
magnate who is creating a baseball museum. 
</P>
<P>
The ball was one of 1,200 lots for sale. Other items included an autographed 
picture of the Beatles (which went for $80), coins, jewelry and trinkets. The 
total appraised value of the lots was $150,000. Information on the total amount 
raised was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
After trying to locate box owners through Social Security and driver's license 
records and by taking out newspaper advertisements for at least a year, the 
contents of the boxes were put on sale, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sale proceeds for each item will be held for the rightful owners or their 
heirs," Davis said. Until claimed, the money is invested and held in the 
state's General Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Through periodic auctions, the controller's office hopes to bring attention to 
the approximately $520 million in unclaimed property and assets that the state 
currently holds, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"One out of every seven people living in the state have something owed to them 
by our office. The odds are much better than winning at Lotto." 
</P>
<P>
For information about unclaimed property, call 800-992-4647. JOHN H. LEE

Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was voted top male newsmaker in the 1989 UPI 
American Editors Poll while two notables tied for top female attention-getter 
-- First Lady Barbara Bush and Cop-Slapper Zsa Zsa Gabor. 
</P>
<P>
The latter verdict was a bit of a surprise. One Florida editor even admitted 
that some of the controversial newsmakers he had chosen "may not be remembered 
in the history books as major players in world events." 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't this guy read his own newspaper? There's no need to apologize for 
voting for Gorbachev and Bush. 
</P>
<P>
While the L.A. Convention and Visitors Bureau has taken one momentous step -- 
changing its name to the L.A. Visitors and Convention Bureau -- it still hasn't 
picked a new president, the last one having been fired several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
But, reports the L.A. Downtown News, "the bruised and benumbed LAVCB is now in 
negotiations with George Kirkland of the Miami Convention Bureau (for that 
post). . . . Kirkland is credited with turning around the image of Miami, which 
once had even a worse national rep than L.A. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Miami's rep was that bad? 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of L.A.'s image, that was a nice cable TV segment the other day on our 
Skid Row, complete with a visit inside an all-transvestite bar. 
</P>
<P>
Charging that a new DMV policy could result in even less food on the table for 
starving comedians, the operators of a comedy traffic school have taken the 
state agency to court. 
</P>
<P>
The $5-million lawsuit, filed here by Comedians Plus -- Learn With Us Inc., is 
the punch line to a DMV decision to cease providing the public with the names 
of the more than 400 licensed traffic violators' schools across California. 
Instead, DMV brochures will list only the serial numbers and telephone numbers 
of schools. 
</P>
<P>
The court action charges that the DMV is dropping the names because of lobbying 
efforts by more traditional traffic schools that have been losing business. 
</P>
<P>
Sort of confirms an old show biz maxim: There's no one more bitter than an 
out-of-work traffic school comic. 
</P>
<P>
Weekend shoppers at the Glendale Galleria this holiday season can park their 
chariots at the L.A. Zoo and take a tram to the mall and back. In other words, 
they can go from one zoo to another. 
</P>
<P>
"Bartenders Stir Up Competition in Absolut Vodka Ski Classic," said the 
headline in a recent issue of Beverly Hills Today newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on the next page, another story was headlined: "Skiing, Alcohol Described 
as a Dangerous Mixture." 
</P>
<P>
Always wise to get a second opinion.

Tyson-Givens Rematch: Boxing champ Mike Tyson and ex-wife Robin Givens are 
still exchanging jabs six months after their divorce. The problem this time is 
the 10 acres of land adjacent to the Bernardsville, N.J., mansion they bought 
as newlyweds. Tyson is being sued by real estate developer Vincent Rasa Jr., 
who claims he is owed $95,000 in commissions for the sale of the $1.9 million 
property. In return, Tyson filed a counterclaim, saying Rasa, Givens, her 
mother Ruth Roper, the previous owner of the land and a real estate company all 
engaged in conspiracy. Tyson claims the group worked together to inflate the 
cost of the property, which he says should have cost about $160,000. DANIEL

Recent ads in the News, Observer of Raleigh, N.C., and Star Log magazine call 
on mature "Star Trek" fans to help form a community where they could live out 
the moral code set by Kirk, Spock and the Starfleet gang. But to boldly go

New Band Aid Version: Pop stars have finished a new version of the 1984 hit 
song "Do They Know It's Christmas?" to raise money for African famine victims. 
More than a dozen singers worked into the early hours Monday to remake the Band 
Aid song that topped the charts at Christmas, 1984, organizers said. The 
participating artists included Tina Turner, Cliff Richard, Chris Rea, 
Bananarama, Jason Donovan and Tears for Fears. The original record raised some 
$10 million for starving Africans and spawned the transatlantic Live Aid rock 
extravaganza on July 13, 1985, which brought in more than $100 million. 
Producer Peter Waterman got involved last week when he was approached by Irish 
rocker Bob Geldof, who conceived the 1984 single. Waterman said he will 
consider a Live Aid II next year. The new single is expected to go on sale Dec.

Universal's "Back to the Future Part II," which toppled box-office records over 
Thanksgiving with a five-day holiday opening of $43 million, fell more than 70% 
last weekend but still led the box office with an estimated $12.1 million. The 
futuristic comedy starring Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd averaged 
$23,065 per screen over the holiday weekend and dropped to $6,490 per theater 
last weekend. Warner Brothers' "National Lampoon's Christmas Vaction" with 
Chevy Chase finished No. 2 with $11.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Tri-Star's "Look Who's Talking" topped the $100-million mark, but dropped to 
the No. 6 spot after spending seven weeks among the top three. The surprise 
comedy hit has grossed a total of $101.5 million.

BEAUX ARTS TRIO AT DOROTHY CHANDLER PAVILION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the occasion of its Los Angeles Philharmonic-sponsored program on Sunday 
evening, the Beaux Arts Trio hewed to dead-center of the standard repertory, 
perhaps for the purpose of attracting as many bodies as possible to the vast 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, hardly a heaven-sent venue for the intimate muse. 
</P>
<P>
Still, to downplay the pleasures of hearing Haydn's Trio in E-flat, Hob. 29, 
Ravel's Trio in A minor and Schubert's B-flat Trio in such vital, informed 
readings as the Beaux Arts' would be churlish if not downright stupid. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Menahem Pressler, violinist Isidore Cohen and cellist Peter Wiley are 
the top of their field and on Sunday they were at the top of their form. 
</P>
<P>
Their Romantic approach to the quietly melancholy Haydn proved appropriate, 
while Ravel and Schubert sang their hearts out, sensuously in the former, with 
pristine sweetness in the latter. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, at least one listener could yearn for a taste of something 
slightly off-center, a bit dangerous -- say a trio by Roussel, Turina or 
Martinu, or Ives, Copland, William Schuman. HERBERT GLASS

DUCKLER DANCE PROGRAM AT SKYLIGHT THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pit-a-pat of a rainy day drizzle grew to an actual indoor downpour as five 
women in leotards slithered around in a bath of water and Freudian connotations 
just inches from their audience in "Wet," a five-part dance with sprinkler 
system choreographed by Heidi Duckler. It was the steamiest moment of an 
impressive if uneven bill called "Fall to Pieces" presented Saturday and Sunday 
at the Skylight Theatre by Collage Dance Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Collage artistic director Duckler also choreographed the brief opening number, 
'Spinster," in which a row of dancers in long dresses stood in isolated pools 
of colored light, each beside their own hanging basket. They tended to the 
pendulous objects with resolute gestural movements suggesting the routines of 
solitude. 
</P>
<P>
"Sight Specific," the "Duckler does L.A." portion of the evening, featured 
Collage's five dancers (Debi Albeyta, Cindy Clarke, Eimi Guirao, Aimee Levine, 
Laura Ozer) in print pants, T-shirts and sunglasses flopping around on deck 
chairs, posing and snapping snapshots. 
</P>
<P>
Spicing up the treatment of this by-now overworked topic were interludes of 
text (by Daniel Rosenfeld and John Milton, read by Lia Sargent and signed by 
Mary Lee Sanders) between the dance riffs and live percussion by Bob Fernandez, 
Joel Hirsch, John Norton and Jim Snodgrass. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the bill was Katherine LaNasa Hopper's "Rocking This Ship," a Southern 
flavored meditation on various aspects of woman's fate. JAN BRESLAUER

CANTINOVA IN AMERICAN MASTERWORKS CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten more lesser-known works by well-known American composers proceeded without 
leaving an unusually bold or memorable impression Sunday evening at the third 
and final concert of a CalArts-sponsored series devoted to American 
Masterworks. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-member vocal group, Cantinova, nonetheless superbly led off the event at 
Santa Monica Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Their vibrant vocal sound filled the resonant hall, creating musical lines that 
were remarkably full and crisp. Paul Vorwerk conducted the group with vitality, 
shaping each phrase carefully and expertly. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Barber's "Agnus Dei" (1967), the composer's vocal arrangement of his 
famous Adagio for Strings (1936), was given special, sensitive attention. Other 
notable efforts included Roger Sessions' "Turn, O Libertad"(1944) and the 
choral version of Ives' song "General William Booth Enters Into Heaven"(1914). 
</P>
<P>
The second half of the program made use of chamber ensembles with members of 
the New CalArts Twentieth Century Players. Charles Griffes' slow, impressionist 
Three Tone Pictures (1915), arranged for nine woodwinds and harp, proved the 
most ambitious undertaking, though the routine music challenged little of the 
players' capabilities. GREGG WAGER

RETELLING AN OLD STORY IN 'JOURNEY TO AMERICA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"When your grandfather came over on the boat. . . ." So the story began about 
our immigrant relatives, and in the back of our young minds, we had to wonder 
if it was all true. Memories color, exaggerate and romanticize the past, which 
is why we need history. Award-winning documentary film maker Charles Guggenheim 
appears to have been so taken by his own family's immigrant story, as well as 
the need to visualize history, that he has made a small career out of the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
First was "The Making of Liberty," for PBS, about the creation of the Statue of 
Liberty, the symbol of immigrant hope. Now, he has assembled and edited what 
must have been endless miles of archival footage into "Journey to America," for 
PBS' "The American Experience" (tonight at 10, Channel 28). The romance is 
gone; all that is left is cold, hard history. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for making the journey to America were far more complex than simply 
an escape from poverty. With a minimum of voice-over narration and a maximum of 
voice-over by the immigrants themselves (well over a dozen were interviewed), 
Guggenheim shows that sheer adventure and freedom of religious belief drove 
people here as much as the desire to make a buck. Still, the images of grinding 
degradation on the plains of Eastern Europe, contrasting with the splendor of 
the first view of the Manhattan skyline, speak volumes about America's real and 
projected identity as the land "where the streets are paved with gold." 
</P>
<P>
Underlying everything in the film is a drama that has now fairly much played 
itself out in American life -- class struggle. The poor immigrant rode like a 
sardine in the ship's steerage section. If he wasn't identified as unacceptable 
for political or health reasons, he made it through the vast Ellis Island 
processing facility -- likely with a new Americanized name given him by a 
customs official. 
</P>
<P>
Then, if he was lucky, he landed a job in the New York ghettos, or the huge 
Chicago slaughterhouses, or the mines of Appalachia or the Far West, where his 
son worked alongside him. It was in these conditions that a radicalized 
socialism took root in America, but this is a chapter of history Guggenheim 
omits. 
</P>
<P>
Not omitted is the fact that seven-day work weeks, 10 people to a single 
apartment and general discrimination against the new immigrants dissolved their 
own ethnic and nationalist differences, despite the urge to re-create the old 
country in the new cities. They became Americanized. Today's popular fears of 
Third World immigration look, in light of Guggenheim's film, like a sad repeat 
of an old story.

SUIT CHARGES DEL MAR FIRM WITH DEFRAUDING MIGRANTS; 
</P>
<P>
AMNESTY: COURT ACTION ALLEGES HUNDREDS PAID UP TO $5,000 FOR WORTHLESS 
DOCUMENTS THAT CLAIMED TO PREVENT DEPORTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Del Mar attorney and a notary public have defrauded hundreds of migrants by 
charging them up to $5,000 to process a post card-size immigration form and 
issuing them phony documents to stop deportation, an immigrant rights law group 
has alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys from the California Rural Legal Assistance office in Oceanside raised 
the allegations against attorney Edward Fitzgerald, notary public Susan M. 
Jeannette and other employees of the American Law Assn. in a lawsuit filed last 
week in Superior Court. Fitzgerald and Jeannette run the business on Jimmy 
Durante Boulevard and claim to be immigration law and amnesty specialists. 
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint, the pair and other office employees charged 
migrants $300 to $5,000 to fill in and mail an Immigration and Naturalization 
Service form for aliens petitioning under the replenishment agriculture workers 
(RAW) program, which ended Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The form is a simple one that INS officials say can be filled out by the 
applicant and which requires only a $10 application fee. 
</P>
<P>
Under the RAW program, aliens will be eligible for amnesty if federal officials 
declare a shortage of agricultural workers and they are picked to work in the 
fields for at least three years. The complaint alleges that Alicia Ramirez, an 
employee of the firm, promised aliens who applied for the RAW program that they 
would be legalized and working by October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But federal officials have not declared a labor shortage and the program has 
not been instituted. 
</P>
<P>
Attached to the lawsuit is a letter written by Fitzgerald and addressed to 
"potential U.S. citizen." The letter tells a client that a new INS ruling 
shortened the deadline for applying for the RAW program to Oct. 31, 1989, a 
month earlier than the real deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the emergency created by this sudden change in the law, payment may 
be made as follows: Cashier's check U.S. $1,500 immediately prior to filing," 
said Fitzgerald's letter, which was attached to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican Consul General Armando Beteta filed an affidavit with the lawsuit, 
saying that his office has received complaints from six Mexican nationals who 
have "experienced problems with the American Law Association." 
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned that many people believe they will legalize their status simply 
by filling out applications and furnishing documents to American Law 
Association," Beteta said. " . . . I know from discussions with these people 
that many of them believe they have some legal protection against INS 
deportation simply by carrying around the papers they have been issued by the 
American Law Association." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Rosenbaum, a CRLA attorney in San Francisco, said American Law is also 
being investigated by INS officials and the Escondido Police department for 
defrauding migrants. Rosenbaum alleged that "hundreds" of migrants have been 
victimized. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of brothers Pedro and Martin de Jesus Martinez, 
of Oaxaca, Mexico. In affidavits filed with the complaint, the two men said 
they paid Ramirez $300 each. The men said that Ramirez gave them each a letter 
"that would allow us to get employment" and which would prevent the Border 
Patrol from deporting them. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, one month after they visited the Del Mar firm, the brothers were 
questioned by Border Patrol agents in Carlsbad. According to their 
declarations, the men showed the agents the letter and official-looking 
identity cards given to them by the American Law Association. 
</P>
<P>
"The agent laughed and said, 'This letter is not good. . . . Let's go.' " said 
Pedro de Jesus' affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
He and his brother were deported. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a receptionist at the firm said that Jeanette, who allegedly signed 
the letter, was out of the office and would not be available for comment until 
next week. Fitzgerald did not return a reporter's phone calls. The receptionist 
said that Ramirez did not work in the office. 
</P>
<P>
The civil complaint asks for at least $500,000 in damages and attorneys' fees 
and asks the court to issue a preliminary injunction against Fitzgerald and 
Jeannette to stop them from engaging in illegal activities. A hearing on the 
request for the injunction is scheduled for Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Besides allegations of fraud, Fitzgerald and Jeannette are charged with 
violating the California Business and Professions Code by "making false and 
misleading statements and . . . conducting unfair and unlawful business 
practices." 
</P>
<P>
The complaint alleges that Fitzgerald and Jeannette told aliens that the RAW 
program was their "last chance" to obtain citizenship, when immigration laws 
allow aliens many other ways to apply for citizenship. Fitzgerald's letter to 
the unidentified client warned that, "under the law as it now stands, there 
will never be another opportunity for you to become a U.S. citizen." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also charged that American Law lied to applicants by telling them 
that "those of you that file with us first will be given the best jobs upon 
acceptance." Aliens were also told that they must agree to work for employers 
designated by American Law, the complaint alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Many allegations of fraud in the amnesty program have surfaced this year in 
Southern California. In June, an Imperial Valley farm labor contractor was 
accused by INS officials of masterminding a ring that falsified more than 1,000 
applications. The owners of two San Ysidro businesses, Notary Public S&amp;S 
and Olvera Bookkeeping Income Tax Notary, were arrested in February and charged 
with providing forged documents to aliens who did not qualify for the 
farm-worker amnesty program.

STATE LOSES TRACK OF TOXIC WASTE SHIPMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A simple computer glitch has rendered the state of California unable to track 
whether U.S.-owned companies in Mexico are returning their hazardous waste to 
the United States, as is required by Mexican law, a state health official 
testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking before a legislative hearing in San Diego, John J. Kearns, the 
regional chief at the Long Beach office of the California Department of Health 
Services, said that the state's computerized tracking system cannot distinguish 
between toxic waste that originates in California and toxic waste that is 
imported from Mexico by a California-based company. 
</P>
<P>
A chemical waste management company based in Azusa, Calif., for example, could 
send waste from its branch in Tijuana back into the United States. But the 
computer would register that the waste was sent from Azusa, Kearns told Sen. 
Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), who chaired the hearing on toxic waste exportation. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where our system is breaking down," Kearns said, adding that he expects 
the computer programming problem to be solved by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
"So we really don't know how much waste is being imported, do we?" Torres 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No, we don't," Kearns replied. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns' remarks set the tone for the three-hour hearing, during which several 
local, state and federal environmental and health experts spoke of limited 
cooperation among agencies and minimal sharing of information, as well as 
outright confusion over whose jurisdiction prevails. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing focused on California's apparently increasing practice of exporting 
its toxic waste to other states and countries, including Mexico. Torres gave 
special attention, however, to how the hazardous refuse from the approximately 
450 Tijuana border plants -- known as maquiladoras -- is affecting San Diego 
County's air, land and water, especially the underground aquifers that provide 
both Mexico and California with water. 
</P>
<P>
The plants, owned by companies in United States, Japan and other countries, 
assemble everything from toys to video games to vehicle parts to foodstuffs, 
but they also create a considerable amount of toxic trash, including solvents, 
heavy metals, plastics, dyes, paints and resins. The precise volume of such 
wastes is unknown, and Torres' indicated during his inquiry Monday that he 
thinks watchdog agencies could do more to try to quantify the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I am concerned about the lack of responsiveness at some agencies," he said. 
"Agencies aren't working together." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Mexican government passed a sweeping new set of environmental 
laws -- based largely on U.S. statutes -- that require, among other things, 
that waste generators report and track hazardous materials, and that they 
submit plans detailing methods of disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican law also requires most maquiladora waste to be shipped back to its 
country of origin -- usually the United States. For each shipment of a waste 
product, companies must file a manifest, good for one year, to show where a 
specific toxin is sent. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the last 12 months, the federal Environmental Protection Agency has 
received only 25 manifests, according to Kathleen Shimmin, chief of the office 
of health and emergency planning with EPA's regional office in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe we are seeing the whole picture," Shimmin said, adding that 
she believes some California companies are illegally dumping in Mexico. She 
cited one incident in which a California company was exporting spent solvents 
to Mexico labeled not as hazardous waste, but as a product. "We believe that 
type of transport is happening, but we haven't been able to issue citations." 
</P>
<P>
Kearns also acknowledged that California has incomplete records of how much 
hazardous waste it ships out of state. If the shipper uses an out-of-state 
manifest form to record the transfer, he said, California has no way to enter 
that information in the data base. Records of those transactions that are 
received are filed by hand, he said, but there is no requirement for 
out-of-state facilities to file those records in California. 
</P>
<P>
By one estimate, data entry problems occur on 25% of manifests received, 
resulting in significant underreporting of how much waste is going where, 
according to Eric Newman, an attorney for Chemical Waste Management Inc., which 
has a plant in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Newman testified that, among the top eight states that import California waste 
-- New Jersey, Utah, Idaho, Texas, Kansas, Arizona, Nevada and Louisiana -- 
several claim to have received more waste than California has a record of 
sending. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, for example, California records show that it sent more than 4 million 
tons of hazardous waste to Nevada. But Nevada records show that it received 
more than 28 million tons of waste from California, according to figures Newman 
provided.

CENTER MUST EXPAND FAST, REPORT SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
CONVENTIONS: TO KEEP PACE WITH COMPETITORS, THE JUST-OPENED SAN DIEGO COMPLEX 
WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE MORE SPACE AND AMENITIES FOR A GROWING CLIENTELE. 
</P>

<P>
San Diego's waterfront convention center has been open all of two weeks, but a 
new consultant's report already urges officials to begin planning for an 
expansion in order to stay competitive with centers in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
The report, which will be discussed in detail by the center's directors Jan. 9, 
says first-year bookings of conventions, trade and consumer shows at the 
$160-million San Diego complex have been so good that they equal that of a 
successful center open for five years. 
</P>
<P>
So what happens to the San Diego facility in five years? According to the 
report, the San Diego center will not only be bursting, but its fully occupied 
status will place the city at a competitive disadvantage in the convention 
center market, a booming business that has several cities expanding their 
centers or planning to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Although the conclusions in the report by Laventhol &amp; Horwath are not 
surprising -- Mayor Maureen O'Connor warned more than two years ago that the 
convention center would be undersized the moment it opened -- it raises several 
new questions, such as how big an expansion, where should it occur and when 
and, perhaps most important, how much will it cost and who will pay for it? 
</P>
<P>
The answers are evident in some cases. The San Diego Unified Port District has 
control of 11 acres south of and next to the center, all or part of which could 
be used for the expansion, according to Don Nay, Port District director. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no expansion timetable, officials estimated Monday that an 
expansion would probably take at least five years to build. 
</P>
<P>
As for how big an expansion and what it should include, Tom Liegler, general 
manager of the convention center, has said he would like to have a plenary hall 
and theater capable of seating several thousand people, 150,000 more square 
feet of exhibition space and about 75,000 more square feet of meeting room 
space. 
</P>
<P>
How much an expansion would cost and who would pay are questions without 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
The Port District, rich with revenue as landlord of the bay front paid for 
construction of the convention center by essentially writing a check, leaving 
the new facility without debt. So the agency would appear to be the obvious 
choice. But the issue hasn't been directly broached by the agency's 
administrative staff or the Board of Port Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has really been decided. There aren't any agreements," Nay said. 
</P>
<P>
James Granby, president of the Convention Center Corp. board of directors, the 
nonprofit organization responsible for operating the center, said Monday that 
he doesn't know who would pay for the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing is essentially providing information and calling people's 
attention to the situation as we see it," he said. "The where, what and who 
should pay for it are matters that have to be explored." 
</P>
<P>
And Liegler said he wanted to be low key about the report. 
</P>
<P>
"This report is just a checkpoint that tells us whether we should even think 
about expansion," he said. "The report says we should, but the details haven't 
been addressed." 
</P>
<P>
The report was commissioned by the Convention Center Corp. in May. In the 
18-page, $17,000 report, Laventhol &amp; Horwath concludes: "We believe market 
demand dictates the expansion . . . however, more in-depth analysis is required 
to determine the sizing and components of the expanded building program." The 
report also recommends an economic impact study to show the financial benefits 
of an expanded center. 
</P>
<P>
"The projected occupancy by conventions, trade shows and consumer shows for the 
first full year of operations far exceeds the original estimates and more 
closely resembles a level of usage indicative of the fourth or fifth year of 
operation," the report said. "This would indicate that the building will 
approach maximum occupancy quickly and may not be capable of hosting additional 
groups that wish to come to San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
The report notes that the convention business and the trade and consumer-show 
industry have been growing steadily for the last decade and that projections 
indicate that the boom will continue. In order to meet the demand, many of San 
Diego's competitors are expanding centers or are in the midst of planning 
expansions. 
</P>
<P>
That means that the San Diego center's main traditional components -- a 
254,000-square-foot exhibition hall, a 40,000-square-foot ballroom, 100,000 
square feet of meeting space -- have been or soon will be overtaken by 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 15 main competitors listed in the report -- ranging from centers in San 
Francisco and Los Angeles to Atlanta and New Orleans -- 10 contain more exhibit 
hall space than San Diego, and when compared to facilities in the West, San 
Diego's center ranks No. 6 in exhibit-hall space. In meeting space, San Diego 
ranks 12th. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the 15 facilities have expansions under way or planned. "These 
expansions could serve to place the San Diego facility at a competitive 
disadvantage within a few years after opening," according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's center is small only in the relative terms of the convention 
industry. Its main exhibit hall, for example, is the size of 4 1/2 football 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the center's size, other factors that could hinder the city's 
ability to attract more conventions are the size of Lindbergh Field, the 
relative dearth of direct flights and the inadequate supply of hotel rooms 
close to the center. But, as the report points out, 2,900 hotel rooms are 
expected to be built downtown by 1992, to go with the 2,125 that are now within 
walking distance of the center. 
</P>
<P>
"These expansions of the lodging supply will improve the city's competitive 
market position; however, the level of air service will still rank ninth among 
the selected cities unless appropriate measures are taken," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
One item not addressed in the Laventhol &amp; Horwath report is how the 
outdoor, 107,000-square-foot patio area under the San Diego center's 
Teflon-coated tents might be used. Since it was designed, the space has been a 
wild card, and, according to the report, no similar facility exists among San 
Diego's main competitors.

SUPERIOR JUDGES BACK ESCONDIDO COURT PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County's Superior Court judges voted Monday to recommend that a new 
courts complex be built as quickly as possible in Escondido -- and eventually 
in Vista as well -- despite a county staff recommendation that new courts in 
North County be built only in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The judges' recommendation will be forwarded to the county Board of Supervisors 
today, although board debate is expected to be delayed a week at the request of 
Supervisor John MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
Vista city officials have pledged to help build a seven-story courthouse 
alongside the existing courts complex in their city, to accommodate 31 more 
courtrooms to serve North County. Part of Vista's offer includes the donation 
of 6 acres next to the existing courthouse site. 
</P>
<P>
The county staff recommended the Vista expansion partly because of the 
logistics problems, and additional costs, of operating two courts complexes in 
North County. 
</P>
<P>
But the caveat to the Vista proposal is that the complex would be funded 
primarily by revenue to be generated by last year's passage of Proposition A, a 
half-cent increase in the county's sales tax to help pay for courts and jails 
expansion. That measure, however, has been challenged in court as unlawful, and 
county officials don't know when -- or if -- proceeds from the measure will 
become available. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, most of San Diego County's 61 Superior Court judges voted to 
endorse Escondido's proposal for a 22-courtroom complex that would essentially 
split North County's courts into two centers, Greer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido had promised $10 million in a combination of cash, land donations and 
property trades toward construction of its courthouse. The rest of the 
construction cost would be financed by the county's share of Escondido's 
redevelopment agency profits. Because of that, Escondido officials have boasted 
that the 22-courtroom complex could be built without any reliance on the 
now-frozen Proposition A funds. 
</P>
<P>
Greer said 51 of the 61 judges voted to support the construction of new courts 
in both Escondido and Vista; six voted to support new courts in Escondido and 
four voted for new courts only in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Vista Municipal Court judges voted last week unanimously to 
support the expansion of the Vista courts complex. 
</P>
<P>
Greer said the majority of the Superior Court judges favor new courts in both 
cities because, by the time money is available to build courts in Vista to 
supplement those in Escondido, both complexes will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to meet both the long-term needs and the short-term needs of the 
Superior Court in North County, we recommend approval and implementation of 
each of the two proposals," Greer said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need all of them," he said. "This is not a North County problem. This is a 
countywide problem. Our criminal case load in Vista is tremendous, and a recent 
decision by the California Supreme Court allows persons to be tried any place 
in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"That means that, when we're filled up in Vista, we'll be trying North County's 
criminal cases in San Diego. In two years, we'll be at a civil (lawsuit) 
shutdown as a result of hearing nothing but criminal cases in this county. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we find a solution as fast as possible to build courtrooms in North 
County, the result will be that the whole county will be disadvantaged," Greer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Escondido has a way to build the courts, and that's our good fortune because 
there's no money elsewhere to build them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Greer said he wasn't sure what influence the Superior Court judges will have on 
the decision by the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"But I hope they'll pay attention to the fact that they are lighting a fuse 
that will blow up in all of our faces in three years, and that Escondido is 
offering a solution. I don't care where the courts are built, but they've got 
to be built now." 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald said he will ask fellow supervisors for a week's delay in discussing 
the courthouse issue in order to provide Escondido officials time to rebut the 
county staff recommendation favoring Vista.

CITY ADDRESSES POST OFFICE PARKING TICKET PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not everybody gets to pitch $1,105 worth of parking tickets into the trash 
without fear of penalty -- but Uncle Sam does. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles transportation official said Monday that the U.S. Postal Service 
does not have to pay 85 tickets issued to mail carriers who parked postal 
trucks overnight in a city-owned lot in North Hollywood without feeding the 
parking meters. 
</P>
<P>
The tickets were issued during the past three weeks after parking 
administrators warned postal officials to begin paying $1 per vehicle for 
parking overnight or to stop using the lot in the 11300 block of Chandler 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
But the warning was a mistake, said Bob Yates, the city's parking 
administrator. Federally owned vehicles are exempt from city parking 
regulations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a matter of the right hand not really knowing what the left was doing," 
Yates said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Mail carriers have used the 48-space lot to park up to 27 government vehicles 
every night since the early 1970s because there is no other place to park 
overnight in the neighborhood, said Bill Guest, manager of the Chandler Station 
Post Office, which adjoins the lot. Prior to that, postal carriers used their 
own vehicles and took them home at night, he said. Before that, they used 
bicycles to deliver the mail, Guest said. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 8, postal officials got a letter from the city telling them to stop 
using the lot for free by Nov. 13, said Dale J.E. Herbert, acting postmaster of 
the Van Nuys division, which includes North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the worst time of year with the holiday mail, and then we had parking 
tickets to worry about," Herbert said. 
</P>
<P>
Yates said he signed the letter because a parking enforcement supervisor 
happened to notice the postal vehicles in the lot one afternoon and was worried 
that residents and shoppers in the area were being deprived of parking spots. 
But Yates said more than 600 area residents have signed petitions supporting 
the post office's use of the lot. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Councilman John Ferraro wrote to the city Department of 
Transportation, pointing out that the post office maintains the city-owned lot 
for free and has installed lights there. "It appears to me that two 
governmental agencies must work together for the good of the entire community," 
Ferraro said in the Dec. 1 letter. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, writing the warning letter to the post office and directing 
parking enforcement officers to issue tickets was "probably a bit ill-advised," 
Yates said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Acting Postmaster Herbert called Yates' admission "quite an achievement." He 
said he will take particular satisfaction in ripping up the 85 tickets because 
he got a ticket last month for illegally parking his personal car when he 
visited the Chandler Station post office to check out the situation.

COUNTY MOVES TO CURB GROWTH IN SANTA CLARITA; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE DEPARTMENT OF REGIONAL PLANNING PROPOSAL WOULD MAKE DEEP CUTS 
IN DEVELOPERS' PLANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County planners, saying there are limits to growth even in the 
burgeoning Santa Clarita Valley, released a development plan Monday that would 
cap growth in the valley, rejecting close to 28,000 dwelling units proposed by 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
The plan still must be approved by the Regional Planning Commission and Board 
of Supervisors and probably will be revised during several public hearings on 
the document. 
</P>
<P>
The first hearing before the Regional Planning Commission is scheduled Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
The plan released Monday by the Department of Regional Planning would revise 
the valley's general plan, which acts as a broad blueprint for growth, 
designating land for commercial, industrial and residential development in a 
region. 
</P>
<P>
The plan upholds a county policy allowing the present 151,000 population of the 
valley -- the county's fastest-growing region for the past four years -- to 
swell to 270,000 by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
Some developers have lobbied the county to ease that population ceiling to 
allow more building. 
</P>
<P>
John Edwards, an administrator in the Department of Regional Planning, said the 
new plan recognizes that growth can continue only if there are roads, water and 
other services to support it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're approaching the limits of the infrastructure," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards cited a recent county report that said a limited water supply could 
slow growth in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the valley used 68% of its currently available water supply in 
1987 and could use as much as 96% by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
That report, tallying the cost of growth in the region for the first time, also 
predicted that the Santa Clarita Valley would need at least $912 million in 
capital improvements -- from roads to libraries to parks -- over the next 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan would allow up to 10,100 new houses, apartments and condominiums 
to be built in the valley in the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
That would be on top of 48,000 dwelling units currently in the valley, another 
19,000 approved but not yet built, and a further 18,000 that would be allowed 
under current zoning. 
</P>
<P>
The plan released Monday will determine the fate of 43 development proposals 
that would exceed the 10,100 units it provides for. Those proposals call for 
38,000 houses, apartments and condominiums -- enough units to fill a city the 
size of Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals were put forth by some of the most influential developers in the 
Santa Clarita Valley and called for drastic changes in the use of land. One 
proposal, for example, called for squeezing 1,215 units onto 43 acres currently 
zoned for 32 units. 
</P>
<P>
After county officials complete the new Santa Clarita Valley general plan, they 
will see how the 43 proposals fit the new planning document, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those projects will have to be rejected or scaled down to meet the 
population ceiling of the new general plan. 
</P>
<P>
A map shows much of the growth allowed by the plan would be in northern 
Valencia, an area being developed by the Newhall Land and Farming Co.

TRIAL OPENS IN EXTORTION MAIL SCHEME; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: PROSECUTORS SAY THEY WILL PROVE TWO MEN SENT THREATENING LETTERS TO 
265 ANTELOPE VALLEY RESIDENTS EVEN THOUGH THE EVIDENCE IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The trial of two former aerospace technicians accused of sending hundreds of 
"pay-or-die" letters to prominent Antelope Valley residents opened Monday, with 
a prosecutor saying he can convict the suspects despite a case based on 
circumstantial evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen L. Cooley acknowledged in San Fernando Superior 
Court that no single witness or piece of evidence conclusively links Richard 
Faroni, 27, and Roman (Moose) Makuch, 28, to the mailing of extortion letters 
to about 265 prominent business people, doctors, lawyers and community leaders 
in the Antelope Valley in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But Cooley said the evidence shows Makuch and Faroni had the capacity, 
equipment and motive to collect information about the people and carry out a 
"bizarre but feasible extortion scheme" in which hundreds of thousands of 
dollars were demanded, but never collected. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a wide variety of circumstantial evidence," Cooley said in an 
interview. "No one piece provides a critical link. But the weight of the 
evidence shows they were involved." 
</P>
<P>
Makuch and Faroni pleaded innocent to charges of conspiracy and attempted 
extortion and opted for a non-jury trial before Superior Court Judge Ronald S. 
Coen. They have spent more than a year in custody and face up to eight years in 
prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
The letters threatened recipients and their families with grisly deaths and 
included details that indicated the writers may have been keeping their 
subjects under surveillance. The letters demanded that hundreds of thousands of 
dollars be sent to other local residents, some of whom also had received 
threatening letters, and it is not clear how the extortionists intended to 
collect the money. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a tip that Makuch and Faroni had bragged of engineering the plot, Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's detectives arrested the two on Thanksgiving Day, 1988, 
in Las Vegas, where several victims had been instructed to drop off payments. 
Detectives confiscated surveillance equipment and small two-way radios of the 
type some people were told to bring to Las Vegas, as well as numerous lists, 
some containing victims' names. 
</P>
<P>
But the informant has never surfaced and the tip is hearsay, inadmissible as 
evidence, Cooley said. Makuch and Faroni have alibis that they were in 
Connecticut when the letters were mailed. And there is no physical evidence 
directly connecting them to the crime, Cooley said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney William Clark said Monday: "There's a huge quantum leap 
between potentiality and reality of accomplishment. I haven't seen anything 
that bridges that gap yet. . . . It's distinctly possible they could have done 
it. So could have half the people in Lancaster." 
</P>
<P>
Monday's proceedings were dominated by the testimony of Lawrence Mock, who 
worked with Makuch and Faroni at Rockwell International. Mock said the three 
often discussed commission of the perfect crime, electronic surveillance 
tactics and elaborate plots to take revenge on people using letters and 
multiple mailings. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorneys said Mock's testimony is tainted because Cooley's office 
charged him with perjury after learning that Mock lied when he said during the 
preliminary hearing that he had been a Navy commando and a Los Angeles police 
officer. Prosecutors agreed not to use Mock's testimony Monday against him in 
the perjury case, in which a plea agreement is being negotiated.

DECENTRALIZED SCHOOL DISTRICT PLAN PRAISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Allowing parents to choose their children's schools has improved academic 
performance and reduced the number of dropouts, a Northern California school 
superintendent told a hearing Monday into the possibility of breaking up the 
giant Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Walter L. Marks, superintendent of the Richmond district, the only one in 
California to allow parents free choice among schools offering different 
educational programs, spoke to a hearing in Studio City organized by 
Assemblywoman Marian La Follette (R-Northridge). 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth and final hearing in the series sponsored by La Follette, who 
has long advocated breaking up the 610,000-student Los Angeles district and 
forming separate districts, including a San Fernando Valley district. 
</P>
<P>
Marks said the free-choice system worked well in his 31,000-student district. 
He suggested that a free-choice system would work in the much larger Los 
Angeles district if it was inaugurated as an experiment in a portion of the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
But La Follette said such an approach might not work in Los Angeles, commenting 
that school district officials and the seven-member Board of Education would 
probably resist it. 
</P>
<P>
La Follette's earlier attempts to break up the Los Angeles district, the 
nation's second largest, have died in legislative committees. She has argued 
that smaller districts would improve education by making schools more 
responsive to parents. 
</P>
<P>
La Follette hopes to persuade the state Board of Education to put the issue 
before voters in 1991. The Los Angeles County Committee on School District 
Organization, a state-appointed board, must also approve of such a vote. 
</P>
<P>
This summer La Follette created the Los Angeles Task Force for Better 
Education, a 10-member advisory committee, to conduct hearings and make a 
recommendation on the question of breaking up the district to the state board. 
</P>
<P>
The task force is expected to submit its recommendations by early next year, 
said a spokesman for La Follette. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the plan, including school board President Jackie Goldberg, argue 
that breaking up the Los Angeles district into 10 or 15 smaller districts would 
probably create constitutional challenges that the plan would promote 
segregation.

23 INJURED IN TOXIC LEAK AT MEDICAL LAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A leak of toxic liquid at a North Hollywood medical laboratory injured 23 
people Monday and forced the evacuation of 200 employees, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Several dozen firefighters, a hazardous-materials team and three ambulances 
were dispatched to the Kaiser Permanente medical laboratory in the 10000 block 
of Magnolia Boulevard about 10:20 a.m. after employees reported the leak, said 
Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen people were treated at the scene for headaches, burning eyes, sore 
throats and nausea, Acevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
Seven others were taken to St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank and Valley 
Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys for treatment and were later released, 
hospital spokeswomen said. 
</P>
<P>
It was discovered that Freon, a clear, nonflammable liquid used in 
refrigeration and air-conditioning units -- had leaked from a freezer inside a 
storage room at the lab, Acevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
Freon contains a series of fluorocarbon compounds that, if inhaled in large 
amounts, can be fatal, said Dr. Mark Bayer of the Los Angeles County Regional 
Poison Control Center. 
</P>
<P>
The leak was contained to the storage room and employees were allowed back 
inside the building shortly after noon, said Kaiser spokesman Allan Mann.

A police officer shot and wounded a 25-year-old man Sunday night after a brief 
chase in East San Diego, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers Gerald Griffin and Teresa Clark were eating at a restaurant in the 
4300 block of University Avenue at about 9:35 p.m. when witnesses told them a 
hold-up was taking place outside, spokesman Dave Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin ran outside and saw Curlee Markson of San Diego holding a knife, Cohen 
said. Griffin shot twice at Markson, but missed, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin chased Markson on foot into a parking lot in the 3800 block of 
Fairmount Avenue, where he hit him once in the stomach with a shot, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Markson, who was in critical but stable condition at Mercy Hospital on Monday 
afternoon, will be charged with robbery and assault with a deadly weapon, Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin, a three-year veteran, was put on administrative leave during an

<P>
A no-bail bench warrant for the arrest of Ruby Mae Brown was issued Monday by a 
judge after Brown failed to show up to begin her 89-day jail sentence for 
cruelty toward dogs in her now-closed kennel. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 61, was sentenced Thursday by San Diego Municipal Judge Robert McDonald 
to 89 days in jail after she refused, through her attorney, to agree to a 
probation condition requiring her to surrender her guns for the next three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney, Hodge Crabtree, said Monday that he did now know where his client 
was. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Brown operated Kelly's Pet Hotel on Morena Boulevard, which was 
raided frequently by animal control officers because of unsanitary conditions. 
It is now closed. 
</P>
<P>
A jury convicted Brown Oct. 25 on four counts of animal cruelty and one of 
interfering with a county official in the performance of his duty, all 
misdemeanors.

A day after she became the first transplant patient to receive a heart, liver 
and kidney, physicians attending Cindy Martin at Presbyterian-University 
Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pa., said she may be able to go home in three to four 
weeks. Martin, 26, was in critical condition under intensive care after the 21 
1/2-hour operation. Dr. John Armitage, who performed the heart transplant 
surgery, said: "Right now, her organ function looks encouraging. She's awake 
and writing us notes." The doctors said they planned to begin weaning her from 
a respirator, and that post-surgical infection would pose the greatest risk to 
her recovery. Although multiple-organ transplants have been done before, this 
was the first involving the heart, liver and a kidney, Armitage said.

Republican state Rep. David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, 
said that he will seek the U.S. Senate seat of J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.). The 
Louisiana GOP plans to endorse a candidate Jan. 12, but Duke said that he 
probably will run even if he is not the party's choice. He joins a field of two 
other Republicans who are seeking Johnston's seat. Duke, who in the past has 
been associated with the far-right Populist Party, disavowed his racist beliefs 
when he was sworn in as a state representative. Since leaving the klan in the 
1970s, he has headed the National Assn. of White People, which he says promotes 
"equal rights for everyone."

Both sides rested their cases and closing arguments were scheduled to begin 
today in the trial of a Miami policeman charged with manslaughter in the deaths 
of two black men that sparked three days of race riots in January. The defense 
rested its case after rolling a motorcycle into the courtroom to show jurors 
how the vehicle looked the day the defendant, William Lozano, 31, shot and 
killed its driver, Clement Lloyd, 23. Lloyd's passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24, 
died later. The prosecution claims Lozano killed Lloyd unnecessarily as the 
Kawasaki Ninja motorcycle, fleeing from a pursuing police car, sped past the 
officer in the opposite lane. The defense says the motorcycle was bearing down 
on Lozano, who shot in self-defense.

U.S. Geological Survey scientists said the October earthquake in the Bay Area 
was "not encouraging" for scientists who hope someday to be able to provide 
warnings of major temblors. A major earthquake should reveal through various 
precursors that it is about to strike, scientists have theorized. But William 
Prescott of the Geological Survey said "there was nothing that we could clearly 
identify" as a precursor of the Oct. 17 quake. Prescott spoke at the fall 
meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco.

IS M. DANNY WALL'S JOB NECESSARY?; 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;LS: AS HEALTHY THRIFTS BECOME MORE LIKE BANKS, MANY INDUSTRY OFFICIALS 
QUESTION WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE TWO SEPARATE REGULATORY AGENCIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The resignation of M. Danny Wall as the country's top thrift regulator has 
raised a bigger question: Is his job necessary? 
</P>
<P>
The agency he resigned from Monday, the Office of Thrift Supervision, is less 
than four months old, having been created this summer as part of the savings 
and loan bailout signed by President Bush in August. Under Wall's tenure, it 
has been a demoralized, embattled successor to the Federal Home Loan Bank 
Board, with considerably less responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many thrifts are going out of business and the healthy survivors are 
becoming more like banks each day. As the line blurs between the two, many 
industry officials and former regulators are questioning whether it makes sense 
to have separate agencies. Why not, they ask, charge the same people who 
regulate banks with regulating savings and loans? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be sooner rather than later. It seems logical," said Edwin J. 
Gray, a Florida thrift executive who headed the bank board from 1983 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The OTS, like the bank board before it, supervises thrifts and approves new 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
Yet an important function, overseeing the deposit insurance system, was carved 
out of the agency and is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 
which historically only was responsible for the guarantee of bank funds on 
deposit. The OTS also is not the independent agency the bank board was, having 
to answer now to the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, was under 
direct control of the bank board. Now Freddie Mac, which buys residential 
mortgages from lenders, answers to an independent board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Many believe that the system would be much simpler if the regulatory systems 
were combined, possibly by merging the OTS with the Office of the Comptroller 
of the Currency, which regulates national banks and also is part of the 
Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very convoluted system at this time. The complexity of it is unworkable 
to begin with," said Richard T. Pratt, another former bank board chairman who 
now is an executive with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The savings and loan industry, through the U.S. League of Savings Institutions 
trade group, has taken no official position on whether the OTS should be 
scrapped. But rumblings have started for a good many reasons. 
</P>
<P>
One main one is that thrifts will pay the agency's $298-million annual budget 
through hefty fees. About $140 million is expected to come from fees for 
examinations and applications, with the rest coming from assessments based on 
asset size of each institution. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, thrift executives have been concerned in recent weeks that the OTS 
will overreact to past criticism that regulators have been too lax by becoming 
too tough. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, banking regulators are becoming more involved in regulating thrifts 
anyway. The FDIC insures and examines thrifts now. And its chairman, L. William 
Seidman, is overseeing the mopping up of the thrift fiasco as chairman of the 
Resolution Trust Corp., a new agency created to manage the assets of the 
nation's failed thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Wall, who took over as head of the bank board in July, 1987, has been 
criticized for downplaying the severity of the nation's savings and loan mess 
and causing losses to mount as a result. Although thrift officials say the 
issue of whether the OTS should exist would have surfaced anyway, no doubt 
Wall's problems and the publicity surrounding them have helped focus attention 
on the question. 
</P>
<P>
"The real problem is in the system and its structure, and that doesn't go away 
with Wall's resignation. OTS is an unneeded agency," said Bert Ely, an 
Alexandria, Va., thrift industry consultant.

LIN CAN'T RESIST: BOARD AGREES TO NEW MCCAW BID; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNICATIONS: DIRECTORS VOTE TO SELL CONTROL FOR $3.4 BILLION AFTER RIVAL 
SUITOR BELLSOUTH FAILS TO RAISE ITS OFFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After nearly six months of struggling, directors of Lin Broadcasting on Monday 
abruptly voted to sell a controlling stake to McCaw Cellular Communications for 
$3.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The vote, coming after McCaw again raised its offering price, drew McCaw closer 
to victory in a high stakes battle for control of some of the most lucrative 
cellular telephone properties in the world. 
</P>
<P>
In light of rival BellSouth Corp.'s failure to make a counteroffer to McCaw's 
bid of $154.11 a share (up from last month's $150-a-share offer), Lin's board 
suddenly dropped its resistance. The purchase of the 21.9 million shares, 
together with the 5.1 million Lin shares it already owns, would give McCaw 
majority control. 
</P>
<P>
Lin's board "was compelled to do what they did. It doesn't mean that they 
suddenly prefer a merger with McCaw to BellSouth," said Frederick Moran, 
president of Moran &amp; Associates, a Greenwich, Conn., investment concern 
that controls shares in both Lin and McCaw. 
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, BellSouth, which had stepped in as the white knight to save New 
York-based Lin from the Kirkland, Wash., upstart, said it was studying McCaw's 
new offer and would have no immediate comment. But many analysts said they did 
not expect BellSouth to raise its offer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if they wanted to continue to play this game, they would have made 
their wishes known by now," said Thomas W. Friedberg, a Seattle-based analyst 
with Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood of Minneapolis. He and others in the industry 
cited BellSouth's conservative management's reluctance to take on a high amount 
of debt and dilute the company's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
The battle for Lin began in June with McCaw's hostile $120-a-share bid for all 
of Lin and seesawed as Lin's board adopted a course of determined resistance. 
McCaw lowered its bid to $110 a share after Lin lost a court bid to compel 
Metromedia Inc., its partner in New York and Philadelphia franchises, to sell 
out to Lin. 
</P>
<P>
Lin finally turned to BellSouth, proposing that BellSouth and Lin merge their 
cellular telephone operations to form the nation's largest company that would 
absolutely control the valuable big city markets. McCaw, currently the nation's 
largest independent cellular telephone operator, pursued Lin vigorously for 
precisely that reason -- it lacks a significant presence in the urban markets 
that are expected to grow the fastest. 
</P>
<P>
As BellSouth showed a determination to go further with Lin, McCaw opted to 
dramatically increase its offer to $125 a share -- but for a majority stake for 
which it could finance instead of the whole. 
</P>
<P>
After raising the offer again without a response from Lin's board, McCaw 
threatened to try to oust Lin's board, and the battle became a war between 
accountants over arcane accounting interpretations that would make each side's 
proposal look best. 
</P>
<P>
The tide turned late Friday when McCaw submitted a new offer. Lin said it 
discussed the revisions with McCaw over the weekend and convened a board 
meeting Monday to review the offer and any other proposal. 
</P>
<P>
While BellSouth Corp. was invited to submit a proposal to revise its merger 
plan, "BellSouth has not done so at this time," Lin said in a statement. Lin 
said it asked BellSouth to withdraw its merger agreement so that it can enter 
into a binding agreement with McCaw. If BellSouth doesn't withdraw, Lin could 
terminate the agreement if its stockholders on Jan. 12 do not approve the 
BellSouth proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout this long process our goal has been to maximize stockholder value," 
said Lin President and Chief Executive Donald A. Pels. "The board's action in 
recommending the revised McCaw offer is in accordance with that goal." 
</P>
<P>
The McCaw offer was superior to the BellSouth proposal at $150 a share, Moran 
said. "Today's further improvement was even better," he explained, forcing the 
Lin board to accept it or face the wrath of shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to raising the cash price, McCaw said it would transfer to Lin its 
nearly 5% interest in a Los Angeles Cellular Telephone. Lin currently owns 35% 
of the franchise and BellSouth holds 65%, meaning that McCaw would become 
partners with its rival in the important Los Angeles market if the new 
transaction is approved. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new proposal McCaw would still cause Lin to buy $425 million of McCaw 
stock and distribute it to Lin holders as a dividend. McCaw also said it agreed 
to amendments to the part of the proposal where it would guarantee to buy 
remaining Lin shares at a certain value including limiting purchases to 75% of 
shares outstanding instead of 81%.

US West, Hungary Sign Cellular Phone Deal: US West Inc. and the Hungarian 
government phone company signed an agreement to operate a cellular telephone 
system in Hungary, the first in Eastern Europe, the company said. Construction 
is expected to start in the second quarter of 1990, with initial service being 
offered in Budapest in the first quarter of 1991, US West and Magyar Posta 
announced. The first phase of the project will cost about $10 million. US West, 
which is based in Englewood, Colo., said the system eventually will provide 
mobile cellular communications throughout Hungary, which has a population of 
10.6 million people. US West is one of the seven regional Bell phone companies.

Treasury Bill Rates Fall: The Treasury sold $8 billion of new three-month bills 
at an average discount rate of 7.55%, down from 7.63% last week. Another $8 
billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 7.30%, 
down from 7.45% last week. The rates were the lowest since three-month bills 
sold for 7.52% on Oct. 23, and six-month bills averaged 7.26% on Aug. 8, 1988. 
The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 7.80% for 
three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,809.20 and 7.69% for a 
six-month bill selling for $9,630.90. The discount rate reflects the price 
discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face 
value.

Leona Helmsley Loses Appeal: The last obstacle between Leona Helmsley and 
sentencing was lifted when a judge refused to set aside her tax evasion 
conviction. Helmsley, who is portrayed in advertisements as the queen of her 
luxury hotels, was convicted Aug. 30 of evading $1.2 million in federal taxes 
by charging personal expenses to her business empire. By denying a request to 
overturn the conviction and dismiss the charges, U.S. District Judge John 
Walker cleared the way for her Dec. 12 sentencing. The judge ruled that 
prosecutors did not use tainted evidence against Helmsley. Her lawyers alleged 
that prosecutors improperly used the testimony she gave to grand juries in 
1985.

PEOPLE: HUGHES AIRCRAFT NAMES RICHARDSON AS PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
D. Kenneth Richardson has been named president and chief operating officer of 
Hughes Aircraft, following a 37-year career at the Los Angeles-based aerospace 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, 58, who has been executive vice president-operations at Hughes, 
succeeds Donald H. White, who retired Dec. 1. Since General Motors acquired 
Hughes in 1985, a new slate of senior corporate executives has taken over, but 
it includes many Hughes veterans. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes officials are still considering whether to fill Richardson's former job 
as head of operations for Hughes' six major operating groups. By filling the 
vacant slot, Richardson would become more involved in financial and strategic 
matters for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes has gone through a difficult year in 1989. It reduced its ranks by 6,000 
in an effort to become more cost competitive and to accommodate declining 
business in some areas. Even with looming federal defense cutbacks, Richardson 
now has a positive outlook. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very optimistic and upbeat about the future of the company," Richardson 
said in a telephone interview. "As we look at the next calendar year, we feel 
very, very good about that." 
</P>
<P>
Richardson is credited by many Hughes insiders with restoring the company's 
tactical missile business during the mid-1980s when manufacturing problems were 
cited by the military services for a series of punitive financial actions 
against the company. After that effort, Richardson was promoted to executive 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
A private pilot, Richardson has flown in a number of high-performance military 
jets and has espoused a philosophy that top executives get out into the field 
to see how their products are functioning. Richardson is a graduate of the 
University of Southern California with a master's degree in mechanical 
engineering and from UCLA, a master's in business administration. RALPH

TOP OFFICIAL AT L.A. GEAR QUITS OVER SALARY CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
L.A. Gear Inc., the rapidly growing sneaker company, announced Monday that one 
of its top officers quit after rejecting a contract offer that would have cut 
his seven-figure salary. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which has been dogged by speculation that its business is cooling, 
also released a preliminary sales report indicating that its revenue jumped 
134% in its fiscal fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Gear's stock, which fell $8.375 last week, rose $2.25 on Monday's news to 
close at $35.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. At that price, the stock is up 
roughly twelvefold since L.A. Gear offered its shares to the public in July, 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
The executive who resigned was Elliot J. Horowitz, who was L.A. Gear's chief 
financial officer and one of its three executive vice presidents. Under a 
three-year contract that expired Thursday, Horowitz earned more than $2 million 
in 1988 and is due to draw more than $4 million for this year. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said Horowitz's contract, negotiated when L.A. Gear was a 
much smaller concern, entitled him to a specified percentage of the company's 
pretax earnings. When the company's business boomed, Horowitz's pay skyrocketed 
along with it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very unusual for a CFO (chief financial officer) to make that kind of 
money," said Gil N. Schwartzberg, the company's chief administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartzberg said L.A. Gear offered Horowitz a restructured contract that, 
among other things, would have cut his pay, but Horowitz balked. "Once a person 
makes this kind of money, it's hard to come to an agreement," Schwartzberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartzberg added that the company was pleased with Horowitz's performance. 
For an interim period, Schwartzberg will assume Horowitz's duties. Horowitz, 
who joined the company five years ago as its controller, could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Gear said it did reach new contract agreements with its president, Robert 
Y. Greenberg, and Executive Vice President Sandy Saemann. Each agreed to annual 
pay caps of approximately $5 million under their new contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, L.A. Gear said its sales exceeded $150 million in its fourth 
quarter ended Thursday, up from $63.9 million in the same period a year 
earlier. For the year, the company's sales exceeded $600 million, up more than 
168% from last year. 
</P>
<P>
Marina del Rey-based L.A. Gear also reported that its incoming orders for the 
fourth quarter amounted to a record high of approximately $306 million. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Gear is the nation's No. 3 athletic footwear maker, behind Nike and 
Reebok.

AIRLINES WOOING EXECUTIVES WITH BUSINESS-CLASS PERKS; 
</P>
<P>
TRAVEL: THE INCREASINGLY POPULAR FARE IS CHEAPER THAN FIRST CLASS BUT PROVIDES 
MORE SERVICE THAN ECONOMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Business is booming in business class. 
</P>
<P>
In the competitive airline industry, many big carriers are racing to cash in on 
the growing popularity of business class, which is more expensive than economy 
but cheaper than first class. 
</P>
<P>
Business class is found mainly on international flights and has grown as 
business has become more globalized, boosting air travel abroad by company 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
"It reflects the amount of international business that's happening," said Randy 
Petersen, editor and publisher of Frequent, a monthly newsletter published in 
Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Jet-powered executives look for service, comfort and more space in which to 
work as they shuttle between the United States, Western Europe and East Asia. 
And their companies are willing to pay extra for them to arrive in better 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
A lot extra. A business-class ticket from New York to London, for example, 
costs about $1,400 to $1,500 one way, compared to an economy fare of $450 to 
$865. First class, which provides even more pampering than the business cabins, 
is the most expensive: $2,400 to $2,800 for the same flight. 
</P>
<P>
Business-class passengers get separate check-in counters and special lounges at 
airports. In the air, they get separate cabins with wider seats than are found 
in economy class, fancier food, free liquor and other amenities. They also get 
a lot more attention than passengers in the cramped coach section: The ratio of 
flight attendants to fliers increases from economy to business to first. 
</P>
<P>
Who flies in business class? United Airlines representatives say about 80% of 
its business fliers are men, mainly business executives, with an average income 
of more than $80,000 a year. They average 11 airline trips per year, two of 
which are international. 
</P>
<P>
Some big U.S. airlines, aiming to capitalize on the business-class boom, are 
emulating foreign carriers with strong reputations for international service. 
</P>
<P>
United, for example, recently announced that it is spending more than $45 
million to upgrade its business-class service in what it calls the largest 
renovation program in U.S. airline history. British Airways, whose revenue from 
business class has jumped 106% in the past year, spent $40 million on an 
upgrade program in early 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Business-class customers are very important to our international air travel 
business," United Chairman Stephen M. Wolf said in launching the improvement 
program. "These new enhancements will give our international service a strong 
competitive edge." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago-based United offers business class on its flights to and from East Asia 
and the Pacific -- the world's longest hauls, where comfort becomes even more 
important. Its flight from Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia, for example, takes 
14 hours and 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Business class accounted for around $390 million of United's $8.9 billion in 
revenue in 1988. The airline plans to include the service on its new flights to 
Europe next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. airlines are catching up with big foreign carriers in the 
international service game, said Dan Smith, director of industry relations for 
the International Airline Passengers Assn. in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, where the airlines have been deregulated since 1978, low 
fares and reduced labor costs have been emphasized more than service. Carriers 
in Western Europe and East Asia, on the other hand, still operate mainly under 
government control of fares and routes. 
</P>
<P>
Closer to home, only Trans World Airlines and Pan Am World Airways offer 
business class to any significant extent on domestic U.S. flights -- notably on 
coast-to-coast flights, which use bigger jets. 
</P>
<P>
The smaller, narrow-body jets used for most domestic flights are difficult to 
divide into three sections, and the majority of U.S. flights offer only economy 
and first class. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, many companies will pay for employees to fly business class on 
long overseas trips but will limit them to economy on domestic flights, 
reducing the incentive for airlines to offer business class within the United 
States.

TOURING 'MISSION' OF SOVIETS BEAT KINGS; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: TIRED KHIMIK VOSKRESENSK TEAM HAS LITTLE TROUBLE WITH UNENTHUSIASTIC 
NHL FOE IN OPENING GAME OF TOUR, 6-3. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Keep in mind that Monday night's game between the Soviet club Khimik 
Voskresensk and the Kings was an exhibition hockey game, and not a superpower 
summit (this time held on frozen water.) A sports-based diplomatic mission, not 
the Canada Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night it was best to keep that in mind. Many in the crowd of 13,513 in 
the Forum caught on and had filed out long before the Soviets had beaten the 
Kings, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Why expect more from this exhibition? After all, Khimik Voskresensk has already 
finished its season in the Soviet National League (19-9-8, second to the Red 
Army -- again) and appeared leg-tired and jet-lagged. After all, the game meant 
little to the Kings other than as a vehicle in which to raise money for the NHL 
players' pension fund.

Monday night's game was the first in the NHL's Super Series in which all 21 
league teams will host one of two touring Soviet clubs. It is the seventh time 
the Soviets have undertaken such a series in North America, and these tours are 
not without their touristic elements. The teams are encouraged to visit local 
points of interest in each NHL city. 
</P>
<P>
The players and entourage of Khimik Voskresensk have been no different here. 
After arriving in Los Angeles Friday, the team watched the Kings play the 
Rangers Saturday night. Sunday they toured Hollywood and asked to go to Marina 
del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying the 35-person team and staff is the requisite security presence of 
men in dark blue suits who stood behind the Khimik bench, watching the Soviet 
players and not the game. 
</P>
<P>
The NHL has provided its own security, and also a recording of the lengthy but 
beautiful Soviet national anthem. There was a slight glitch involving the 
Soviet flag -- the one Khimik brought was much larger than the U.S. flag tacked 
on the Forum wall, an obvious breech of protocol. The Kings had to scramble to 
obtain a smaller Soviet flag. During the anthem, a Forum usher was dispatched 
to stand high in the seats with the flag attached to a stick. 
</P>
<P>
It was hard to figure the game as more than an exhibition. Only late in the 
game, when the crowd had whipped itself into a nationalistic fervor, did the 
Kings respond with like enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
The first period was replete with the usual polite and lovely skating and 
occasional nudge so characteristic of the international game. 
</P>
<P>
Khimik scored after luring King goaltender Mario Gosselin far out of the net to 
clear the puck. Gosselin, faced with an onrushing Soviet line, backpedaled into 
the crease and stopped one shot with his chest. The puck fell in the vicinity 
of Vladimir Eryomin, who shot it into the goal while balancing on one skate. 
</P>
<P>
The visitors scored again at 18:35, on Valeri Zelepukhin's shot. 
</P>
<P>
That 2-0 deficit seemed to light a fire under the Kings. The play and the 
hitting became more brisk, but the King offense became no more effective. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets scored again early in the second period to take a 3-0 lead that 
lasted until King right wing Mikko Makela took Todd Elik's pass and scored on 
goaltender Alexei Chervyakov's glove side. Chervyakov stopped 40 of 43 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Khimik scored two quick goals to take a 5-1 lead midway through the third 
period. Not until Keith Crowder put in a rebound did the Kings score in the 
final period. Mikael Lindholm scored for the Kings late in game, and that set 
off a flurry of King scoring opportunities, none of which came to fruition. 
</P>
<P>
Khimik scored an empty net goal at 19:01. 
</P>
<P>
Kings Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Forum crowd offered polite but scant applause during the introduction of 
the Soviet team -- with one exception. Alexander Smirnov, much to his 
puzzlement, was given a rousing cheer by the crowd which had, at last, heard a 
name it recognized. . . . King Coach Tom Webster watched the game from the 
press box. . . . Khimik right wing Roman Oksyuta is the only player on his team 
to have been drafted by an NHL team. The Rangers selected Oksyuta as the 202nd 
pick overall in the 1989 entry draft. . . . The Kings play their next game -- 
this one counts -- Wednesday at home against the Vancouver Canucks.

MIKE DOWNEY: HE VIEWS 12-3 LAKERS AS A 3-12 TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE DOWNEY

<P>
Pat Riley gave the Lakers a real chewing-out about a week ago. They trailed 
Houston at halftime by 15 points. They looked sluggish. They looked distinctly 
un-Lakerlike. 
</P>
<P>
Even Byron Scott couldn't blame the coach for coming down on everybody, saying: 
"The way we played, he should have kicked the door down and put us through a 
few doors." 
</P>
<P>
Three nights later, the Lakers lost to the Detroit Pistons. Yeah, them. There 
was a five-minute overtime during which the Lakers never scored, which seems 
inconceivable. And Riley suffered afterward, having seen his team handled by 
the NBA champions for the seventh straight time. 
</P>
<P>
"I stayed up until 5 in the morning after that Detroit game," Riley said 
Monday, after practice. "That's how much the way we lost that game bothered me. 
I called my assistant coaches all night and kept them up, too, because misery 
loves company." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, those struggling, struggling Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
They're 12-3. 
</P>
<P>
Don't light any candles for the Lakers. They may no longer be the greatest show 
on Earth -- or even the only game in town, as the Clippers will attempt to 
establish tonight at the Forum -- but they are still the Lakers, still a dream 
team, still the same fearsome fivesome that has had a winning record in 25 of 
its last 28 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Is L.A. still in gear? Have the Lakers lost a step? Have they deteriorated? 
</P>
<P>
Not that we can see. They look faster, quicker, slicker. Scott and A. C. Green 
never looked better. Vlade Divac and Larry Drew have been inspirations -- Jerry 
West's inspirations. And Riley is still the coach of the year, year after year, 
officially or un. 
</P>
<P>
"I think yours truly's spirits are up, for the most part," Riley said. "We've 
put a lot of anxiety behind us. After losing the title, after all the spent 
emotion, we definitely wanted to get out of the blocks quickly. And we pretty 
much have. 
</P>
<P>
"I just never want to make them comfortable. So, occasionally I go off on them, 
which takes its toll on all of us. It becomes: 'When is he ever going to be 
happy? When is he ever going to lighten up?' Well, I won't. Because I don't 
think the Lakers should ever settle for less." 
</P>
<P>
So, any major problems? 
</P>
<P>
No, the Lakers look fine. They had Detroit whipped, most of the way, Friday 
night. And they nearly came back that night at Houston. They very easily could 
be 14-1. To beat the Lakers, teams still have to play some all-out ball. 
</P>
<P>
You don't often see the Lakers losing by scores like 100-75, the way some teams 
do. In the 1980s, the Lakers have lost by margins of 25 or more points exactly 
five times -- twice since 1985. The Lakers never think they are out of any 
game. You don't even have to put them through any doors. 
</P>
<P>
How long can this go on? Not indefinitely. Magic Johnson is 30, which is sort 
of like seeing Shirley Temple grow up. He keeps promising not to play beyond 
his prime. He doesn't want to play without fresh legs. Then again, he sure is 
shooting a lot of those hook shots lately, isn't he? 
</P>
<P>
James Worthy is 28, going on 18. This guy is perpetual motion. Oh, he does get 
tired once in a while, maybe semiannually. Otherwise, he runs and runs and runs 
and runs and runs. He's a Timex. He ought to get an off-season job with the 
Department of Energy. James Worthy could stick his finger in a dead bulb and 
make it illuminate. 
</P>
<P>
What's new with the Lakers? 
</P>
<P>
Vlade is new. He's the one with the scratchy black beard, the one who looks as 
if he just got back from working as a deckhand on a boat off the coast of 
Malta. Twenty-five teams didn't take Divac in the NBA draft. Twenty-five teams 
made mistakes. We'll put him up against anybody you've got, Pervis or J. R. or 
Stacey or Pooh or any other rookie. You go your way; the Yugo goes our way. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense, I consider it a miracle to get a guy like Vlade," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
With Mychal Thompson comfortably settling into his once-unwanted status as 
starting center and the 7-1 Divac as a spare, the Lakers have one of the NBA's 
friskiest front lines. 
</P>
<P>
Also new: Larry Drew. Here is a person who actually tried playing for the 
Clippers before going to Italy, a novel approach. Drew is the backup guard the 
Lakers projected David Rivers might be. Now, by coincidence, Rivers is a backup 
guard for the Clippers. They might bump into one another tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Drew gives the Lakers a needed new dimension -- a "prototype point guard," as 
Riley put it -- on the bench, far better than Rivers or Wes Matthews or others 
who have sat there. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers have enough talent to take another title. Riley just feels the need 
to stay after them from time to time, whenever they take this talent for 
granted. Occasionally he will go all red in the face, as he did that night at 
Houston, or as he did at the "Comic Relief" benefit when Whoopi Goldberg 
flirted with him from the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Is he satisfied by a record of 12-3? 
</P>
<P>
"Are you kidding?" Riley asked. "Did you see that Detroit game?"

NEWSWIRE: OFFICIATING IN COLD-WEATHER GAME FROSTS NOLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pittsburgh Steeler Coach Chuck Noll said Monday that officials must have been 
affected by a minus 29-degree chill factor while criticizing them in his team's 
23-16 loss to the Houston Oilers Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Noll said he'll file a report to the NFL office. He said that Haywood Jeffires 
was clearly out of bounds on his 37-yard catch that set up Lorenzo White's 
game-winning touchdown run. He also maintained that the Oilers were given an 
extra timeout as they scored twice in the final 1:54 of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Noll wouldn't fault cornerback Rod Woodson's coverage of Jeffires along a 
snow-covered Oilers' sideline, three plays before White's touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The reception was upheld by instant replay official Cal Lepore, who made seven 
lengthy replay reviews without overturning any calls. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that ticks you off is having to stand there for five minutes with 
the chill factor what it was, waiting for a decision like that," Noll said. 
"The instant replay is just another in the chain of mistakes. Jeffires had one 
foot in and he fell out of bounds."

Alabama Coach Bill Curry said he will send a letter to Southeastern Conference 
officials criticizing what he said was a missed penalty on Auburn's first 
touchdown in Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn spoiled Alabama's previously unbeaten record with a 30-20 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Curry said a review of the game film revealed that Auburn had 12 men on the 
field as the Tigers scored to take a 7-0 lead with 12:10 to play in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew at the time it was an illegal formation but at the time the play was 
over and nothing could be done," Curry said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Curry added that officiating was not the difference in the game. "The 
difference was that they beat us," he said.

After calling pollsters "flat-out ridiculous" for voting Kansas No. 4 last 
week, Coach Roy Williams was apparently satisfied by the latest Associated 
Press college basketball poll, which has his Jayhawks in the No. 2 spot. 
</P>
<P>
"I still say it doesn't mean a thing now, but at the end of the season it might 
mean something," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse received 48 of the 63 first place-votes and 1,535 points after winning 
four games in its first-ever week as a regular season No. 1 choice. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas (6-0) had 17 first-place votes and 1,443 points, 18 more than Georgetown 
(3-0), which remained No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri and Nevada Las Vegas rounded out the top five and were followed by 
Duke, Illinois, Michigan, Louisiana State and Arkansas.

MACLEOD LETS HIS SPOUSE DO THE TALKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
John MacLeod is too nice a man to say what he probably really feels about his 
firing last week as coach of the Dallas Mavericks. His wife, however, said what 
she thought of it all. 
</P>
<P>
Carol MacLeod raged against "spoiled" Maverick players and Dallas management, 
which she said misled MacLeod over the summer about his status. "These players 
make more money than God, but they never seem to be happy," said Carol MacLeod, 
who pointed out Dallas' 47-point loss to Seattle last week as the prime example 
of players quitting on her husband. "They've got a lot of things bothering 
them. But there are homeless people out there who can't find jobs or something 
to eat. . . . So, I don't feel sorry for them." 
</P>
<P>
Maverick management incurred her wrath for, she said, not living up to 
assurances of MacLeod's job security this summer when he was mulling an offer 
to coach the New York Knicks. MacLeod ultimately turned down the job to remain 
with the potentially talented but combustible Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Donald Carter reportedly had told MacLeod his job was safe for the entire 
season, if not longer. When that handshake agreement was made public, Maverick 
executive Rick Sund expressed his displeasure to Carter, who apparently changed 
his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have told him, so he could've gone to New York," Carol MacLeod 
said. "They should've done that. But I think (the Mavericks) were getting bad 
press then and they didn't want to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Sund, the Mavericks' executive who had the final say on the firing, denied 
misleading MacLeod. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to John at the time, 'I recommended you for the Knicks' job, but I can 
never say that you won't be let go here," Sund said. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, MacLeod obviously wishes now he had taken the Knicks' job. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd say right now it was the incorrect decision," MacLeod said. "You can use 
hindsight right now. My decision to stay (in Dallas) was based on family and 
area. We liked it here. I felt last year, the job was unfinished." 
</P>
<P>
Right. This season, the Mavericks finished a steady disintegration that began 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
After taking the Lakers to seven games in the Western Conference finals in 1988 
before losing, the Mavericks were distracted most of last season by Mark 
Aguirre's moping. They eventually traded him to the Detroit Pistons for Adrian 
Dantley, who moped the rest of last season and reportedly is not happy in 
Dallas this season. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there is the ongoing Roy Tarpley saga. Tarpley missed much of last season 
while serving his second stint in drug rehabilitation for cocaine use. This 
season, Tarpley was leading the league in rebounding when he was arrested for 
drunken driving. He currently is on the suspended list and out indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe MacLeod, who coached the Phoenix Suns for 14 seasons before being fired 
after the 1986-87 season, is fortunate he did not have to endure the Mavericks' 
upheaval for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"There comes a time when it's difficult for a coach to reach the players," 
Maverick center James Donaldson said. "He said all he had to say. He could rant 
and rave, but it just wasn't registering." 
</P>
<P>
Guard Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls was credited with an assist recently, 
but it had nothing to do with basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan explains: 
</P>
<P>
"Seattle, last road trip, I was just walking up the street and a man came up 
and asked me for some dough so he could eat. I guess he knew I was Michael 
Jordan. Maybe he didn't. Doesn't matter. I gave him $100. I didn't have a $5 
bill or a $10 bill, and he had nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how it made him feel when I gave him the money. But I know how it 
made me feel. How can anyone experience the warm feeling you get inside when 
you give something to somebody and not want to do it again?" 
</P>
<P>
The Portland Trail Blazers' fast start can be attributed to several 
improvements, including the addition of power forward Buck Williams and the 
pleasantly surprising play of 6-foot-11 Cliff Robinson, the club's second-round 
draft pick from Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest change for Portland, 12-4 going into tonight's game against 
Orlando, apparently has been Clyde Drexler's attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Talk was that Drexler, the prolific shooting guard, did not play hard for 
former Coach Mike Schuler, who was fired last spring. Drexler did not practice 
much during Schuler's tenure because of a variety of minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Adelman was promoted from interim to permanent head coach partly because 
of his ability to relate to Drexler. 
</P>
<P>
"Clyde has been just super with me," Adelman said. "From Day 1, he has worked 
very hard in practice. He has done everything we've asked him to. He's gone out 
of his way to help the young guys. I can't deal with previous situations. I can 
only deal with my own, and I think he's been fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
Drexler is playing like a happy man. During a recent seven-game winning streak, 
snapped Saturday in Denver, Drexler averaged nearly 24 points and shot 55% from 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, the Phoenix Suns' 6-7 start can be attributed to point guard Kevin 
Johnson's injuries. But even with Johnson back, the Suns are not playing like 
the team that advanced to the Western Conference finals last season. 
</P>
<P>
The real problem is at power forward. The Suns let Tyrone Corbin go in the 
expansion draft, and they may regret it. Neither of the replacements Coach 
Cotton Fitzsimmons has used has been effective. 
</P>
<P>
Armon Gilliam started in the first eight games, but he lost the spot because of 
continued sluggish play. Rookie Kenny Battle started one game and responded 
with two points and one rebound. Tim Perry has started the last five games, but 
has been productive only against the expansion Orlando Magic, scoring 17 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being below .500, Phoenix still received this endorsement from Detroit 
Piston Coach Chuck Daly: "I still think they are a team that can win the 
conference (title). Cotton has done a good job turning them from strictly an 
offensive team into an all-around team. You don't always have to play your best 
basketball (in December)." 
</P>
<P>
Salary cap update: The prosperity of the NBA has led to a 35% increase in the 
money teams can use for player payrolls. Some teams have had problems not in 
exceeding the cap limitations, but in staying above the $7.9 million minimum. 
</P>
<P>
The Denver Nuggets, for example, were below the minimum before reworking 
Lafayette Lever's contract. That is not unusual, since teams in smaller markets 
do not have the same high revenues from attendance as teams in New York, Los 
Angeles or Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to believe (the cap) helped you with fiscal responsibility," Denver 
executive Pete Babcock said. "I still think it does, but on the survival side, 
it makes things more difficult. The disparity is in a (bigger) market, where 
you bring in $400,000 a night, compared with a (smaller) market, $200,000. But 
you have to have the same payroll." 
</P>
<P>
The raves keep coming in for David Robinson, the San Antonio Spur center who is 
the leading contender for rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry West, the Lakers' general manager, has said that Robinson could become 
one of the game's all-time great centers. 
</P>
<P>
And K. C. Jones, now an assistant coach with the Seattle SuperSonics, recently 
compared Robinson to Bill Russell.

RAIDERS: BATTERED JACKSON HAS SLOWED, BUT TEAM HAS WON EVEN THOUGH GROUND GAME

<P>
Whither Bo goest, there also may the Raiders go, they hope. But where is that? 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson's best season breaks down into two parts; the stupendous and the 
mostly ordinary. The division occurred in the Houston game, when he began to 
picking up small injuries, although Coach Art Shell says it's more than that. 
</P>
<P>
In his first five games, Jackson averaged 16.8 carries, 114 yards and 6.8 a 
carry. 
</P>
<P>
In his last three, since feeling a twinge in his left thigh and suffering 
bruised ribs and a bruised knee, he has averaged 14.6 carries, 47.3 yards and 
3.6 a carry. 
</P>
<P>
In his first five games, he never had fewer than 79 yards. 
</P>
<P>
In the last three, he hasn't had more than 64. 
</P>
<P>
His importance can hardly be minimized. In his previous incarnation, the 
Raiders had legitimate reason to believe they were more than mere contenders 
for a wild-card playoff berth. With Jackson at full bore and a revived defense, 
they could envision themselves beating any team on any field, right up to 
you-know-what in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
With Jackson merely mortal, so are they. They have had to struggle to win their 
last two games, both at home, including one with the lowly Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
Might a returning Marcus Allen take the burden off Jackson, allowing him to 
heal? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if Bo wants the burden taken off," Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Bo does not. But will less work return him to superhuman form? 
</P>
<P>
"You guys made him superhuman," Shell told the Raider press corps. "He didn't. 
I didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a human being, just like everybody else. He's not saying he's some 
robo-football player or whatever. He's not. He's a human being. He gets licked 
just like anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of things that go into those numbers of his. We have to make 
sure that we're doing a good job of blocking up front, too. Regardless of how 
superhuman you think he is, he still has to have blocking. If you don't have 
blocking, I don't care who you are, you're not going to get much yardage. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, for whatever reason, we're not getting the running game going. 
We've got to concentrate on that. And we will." 
</P>
<P>
Assuming the offensive line didn't happen to fall into a slump three games ago, 
what else might it be? 
</P>
<P>
"Teams are beginning to do things," Shell said. "They show us one thing on film 
and they're beginning to do things a little differently on the football field." 
</P>
<P>
Such as? 
</P>
<P>
"Any action by Bo going one way or the other, you've got safeties and everybody 
coming up. Even the coaches are coming up. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to find ways to counteract what they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy out there. It's not easy, I'm telling you." 
</P>
<P>
What might the Raiders do? 
</P>
<P>
More play-action passes off fakes to Bo. 
</P>
<P>
More carries for fullback Steve Smith. At Houston, where he seemed to have been 
reserved for guard duty on the injured Steve Beuerlein, he had one carry. He 
had four in regulation Sunday against the Broncos, before his key 16-yard run 
that set up the winning field goal in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
And now a few words from Bo, himself: "I'm always beat up. That doesn't mean 
it's to the point where I can't play." 
</P>
<P>
Was Sunday's a big win? 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of question is that to ask? We're playing to get in the . . . 
playoffs. Of course, it's a big win. Where do you guys come up with those 
questions? Who writes your dialogue?" 
</P>
<P>
Not Nike, but anyway. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What did winning Sunday mean? 
</P>
<P>
"That just shuts up (the Broncos') . . . mouths. Because people that talk as 
much as the Broncos have this week -- they were more uncertain of this game 
than we were." 
</P>
<P>
No one is sure what Jackson was referring to. Dan Reeves said there was no love 
lost between these teams but nothing more insulting was widely reported. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm quite sure you read the papers and saw the news," Jackson said. "I don't 
have to repeat what they said." 
</P>
<P>
Were the Broncos out of line, then? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying they were out of line, but if you're going to talk that . . . , 
at least have some paper to pick it up at the end." 
</P>
<P>
The playoff picture: 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are in a three-way tie with Cincinnati and Miami at 7-6 for the 
second wild-card spot, but they have the advantage in the tie-breakers over 
both teams. 
</P>
<P>
They beat the Bengals head-up. 
</P>
<P>
They have a better conference record (6-5) than the Dolphins (5-6). 
</P>
<P>
If Houston wins its remaining two home games, and the Raiders win their next 
two -- Phoenix here Sunday, then at Seattle -- the Bengals or Dolphins would 
have to finish 3-0 to knock them out. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Steve Beuerlein is now 3-1 as a starter this season, having played three games 
on his wounded knee. . . . The Cleveland Browns have three more games left with 
contending teams, the Bengals two, the Raiders and Dolphins one. . . . Add 
endangered list: Mike Haynes wasn't activated Sunday as Dennis Price returned 
to action.

THE WARSAW PACT CONDEMNS ITS '68 INVASION OF PRAGUE;

<P>
EAST BLOC: THE SOVIET-SPONSORED ACTION REMOVES A CRUCIAL POLITICAL AND 
PSYCHOLOGICAL BARRIER TO REFORM.

Leaders of the Warsaw Pact, removing what had remained an important political 
and psychological brake on reforms under way in Eastern Europe, Monday 
condemned as illegal their countries' 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia that 
brought an end to the political and economic reforms of the "Prague Spring." 
</P>
<P>
The Warsaw Pact's declaration marked a crucial first step toward the 
transformation of the 34-year-old, Soviet-led military bloc into the "political 
alliance" now advocated by Moscow -- and perhaps toward its outright 
dissolution. 
</P>
<P>
Adopted at a meeting here of Warsaw Pact leaders under the chairmanship of 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the joint statement condemns the 
invasion, justified two decades ago as a defense of socialism, as "interference 
in the internal affairs of Czechoslovakia." 
</P>
<P>
"Disrupting the process of democratic renewal in Czechoslovakia, those illegal 
actions had long-term negative consequences," the statement said, accepting the 
legitimacy of the 1968 reforms and lamenting the impact that the invasion had 
not only on Czechoslovakia but on other East European countries in halting the 
reform process. 
</P>
<P>
"History showed how important it is, even in the most complex international 
situation, to use political means for the solution of any problems, to observe 
strictly the principles of sovereignty, independence and non-interference in 
internal affairs," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The declaration, a striking confession of error that will call many other 
actions, both foreign and domestic, into question in virtually all socialist 
countries, was signed by the Soviet Union, whose troops led the invasion, and 
by Bulgaria, East Germany, Hungary and Poland, which all sent support 
contingents. 
</P>
<P>
Romania, the other Warsaw Pact member, had condemned the invasion from the 
outset and refused to send troops. A spokesman for the Romanian delegation said 
that it accepted but did not sign the statement. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu is now the most hard-line 
leader in Eastern Europe and a severe critic of the reforms in the Soviet Union 
and other East Bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
The Czechoslovak government Sunday had called upon the five countries that had 
dispatched troops to repudiate their action as "an infringement to the normals 
of relations among sovereign states." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union also opened negotiations Monday, as requested by 
Czechoslovakia, on the withdrawal of the 75,000 Soviet troops still stationed 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Both Prague and Moscow said, however, that the withdrawal would be carried out 
as part of the general reduction in conventional armed forces in Europe now 
under negotiation between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw 
Pact. 
</P>
<P>
But the talks between Prague and Moscow are likely to be expanded soon, 
according to informed East European sources, to cover the withdrawal of the 
Soviet forces remaining in Hungary and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"With this declaration and the negotiations with Prague, the Warsaw Pact as we 
have known it is coming to an end," a member of one of the delegations from 
Eastern Europe said as he left for home Monday evening. "Do not kill off the 
Warsaw Pact -- at least not yet -- but all is now in question." 
</P>
<P>
The Warsaw Pact meeting here on Monday brought together for the first time new 
leaders from all of those countries, and Gorbachev and other top Kremlin 
leaders spent much of the day consulting with them individually on developments 
in their countries. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the new leaders, notably President Egon Krenz and Prime Minister Hans 
Modrow of East Germany and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland, were 
introduced around by veterans and Soviet officials as the meeting opened in the 
Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev had convened the unusual session, according to Soviet officials, to 
report on his weekend summit with President Bush on Malta but also to discuss 
the recent developments in Eastern Europe with the new leaders emerging in most 
of those countries. 
</P>
<P>
He told the leaders that he had received from Bush a solemn pledge that the 
United States and its allies will not interfere in the changes still under way 
in the region and that this guaranteed that the reforms could proceed freely, 
without fear of becoming embroiled in a renewed confrontation between East and 
West. 
</P>
<P>
"Much attention was paid to the events and the process of change going on in 
Eastern Europe," Gorbachev told the other leaders, according to official Soviet 
accounts. "Great attention was also paid by both sides to stability in Europe; 
what would make Europeans more confident of their future." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, as he has increasingly in recent weeks, then argued strongly for the 
accelerated transformation of the Warsaw Pact into a political rather a 
military alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"Realism makes one proceed from the fact that the existing alliances, NATO and 
the Warsaw Treaty Organization alike, will remain for the foreseeable future," 
Gorbachev said. "They can contribute, however, to the strengthening of European 
security as political alliances; become a bridge on the basis of high and joint 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Although it has long advocated disbanding both alliances, Moscow now sees the 
Warsaw Pact as the best vehicle for negotiating the sharp reductions it wants 
in conventional armed forces in Europe. And, as a political organization, it 
could help resolve the probable conflicts between East European countries as 
historical rivalries emerge with the replacement of communism by nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev met separately on Monday with the East German and Czechoslovak 
delegations and with Ceausescu. The meetings with the East German and 
Czechoslovaks were described as friendly, reflecting Gorbachev's strong support 
for the reforms they have begun. But the session with Ceausescu was 
characterized as "frank," a reflection of the serious differences that 
Gorbachev has with the Romanian leader. 
</P>
<P>
This intense give and take, informed Soviet officials commented, will 
undoubtedly shape further developments in the region. But Moscow is uncertain 
what it can do to manage the change. "Events are running ahead of our 
understanding of them," a senior adviser to Gorbachev said over the weekend. 
"We are trying to get a grip on what is going on, to get ahead of this powerful 
wave sweeping the Continent." 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow's view, the admission of error on the 1968 invasion was "a necessary 
and fundamental act," another Soviet official explained, "because the very 
things that we are doing were being attempted in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
"There are important issues of legitimacy, of integrity and of historical 
imperative involved. . . . You could say that, until we admit we were wrong, 
politically as well as morally, in Czechoslovakia in 1968, then we could not 
assert that perestroika and the reforms in Eastern Europe are correct today." 
</P>
<P>
Although Prague had offered on Sunday to create joint historical commissions to 
assess the circumstances surrounding the invasion, and thus ease its comrades 
through this awkward admission, none of the countries needed such a political 
device. 
</P>
<P>
In its own statement, separate from that signed by the Warsaw Pact leaders, the 
Soviet government went further, accepting the blame for the invasion and 
praising Czechoslovakia's 1968 reforms -- and those now under way there. 
</P>
<P>
"Czechoslovak society is at the stage of a critical reassessment of the 
experiences of its political and economic development," the Soviet statement 
said. "This is a natural process. Many countries undergo it in one way or 
another. 
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, the need for constant socialist self-renewal and realistic 
appraisal of events has not always been taken for granted, particularly in 
situations when such events intertwined in a contradictory way and required 
bold answers to the challenges of the times." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leadership had sided with one group during the 1968 reforms, the 
statement continued, in the belief that developments in Czechoslovakia should 
be assessed as part of the "acute East-West confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
That assessment and the subsequent decision to intervene militarily were 
"erroneous," Moscow said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one years ago, Czechoslovakia experienced a brief period of political 
liberalization that became known as the Prague Spring. Key points of the reform 
movement, instituted by party leader Alexander Dubcek, included reduced 
restrictions on elections, freedom of expression and religion, curbs on police 
and increased trade with the West. The movement was crushed in November, 1968, 
when Soviet tanks rolled into eastern Czechoslovakia. Other Warsaw Pact nations 
joined the Soviets in responding to what a rightist faction in the Czech 
government called Dubcek's betrayal of socialism. Dubcek, and about 500,000 of 
his supporters, were ousted from the Communist Party, and hard-line leader 
Gustav Husak took his place. The ouster of Dubcek effectively ended political 
reform in Eastern Europe.

47% OF RESIDENTS IN POLL FEAR O.C. GOING DOWNHILL 
</P>

<P>
As Orange County enters the 1990s, residents -- weary of traffic, congestion 
and high-priced housing -- are increasingly pessimistic about the future, and 
one in six entertains thoughts of moving elsewhere, according to the 1989 
Orange County Annual Survey. 
</P>
<P>
But while they recognize that the county faces serious problems, residents are 
resistant to solutions that would most directly affect their lives, said Mark 
Baldassare, the UC Irvine social ecology professor who directed the survey. 
</P>
<P>
"They do not see themselves as part of the problem," Baldassare said. "And they 
don't see themselves taking an active role in the solution." 
</P>
<P>
Almost half of those polled -- 47%, compared to 38% in 1988 -- said they fear 
that Orange County will become a worse place to live in the coming years. Just 
28% see Orange County improving, while one-fourth of those polled said they do 
not foresee any change. 
</P>
<P>
The increasingly gloomy view of the county's future represents a return to a 
pessimistic trend that began in 1985 but was interrupted last year by more 
optimistic results, Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
The wide-ranging poll -- which is paid for by public agencies, private 
foundations and corporations, including The Times Orange County Edition -- 
surveyed 1,085 adult residents of Orange County from Sept. 6 to 23, and has a 
3% margin of error. 
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons for the current downturn is an increasingly somber view 
of the county on the part of its wealthiest residents. Last year, 42% of 
respondents who earn $50,000 or more said the quality of life here was still 
very good; this year, only 29% of that group saw things in those terms. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, this has been the most negative survey," said Baldassare, who 
has directed the poll for eight years. "In the past, people said things are 
going well now, but they won't go so well in the future. Now, a growing 
proportion are saying that this isn't so great right now." 
</P>
<P>
Still, three out of four respondents said that, in terms of the quality of life 
in the county, things are going well, while just one in four said they are 
going badly. 
</P>
<P>
But that margin was higher in past years, Baldassare said. Last year, 35% of 
those polled said things were going "very well"; this year, only 28% thought 
that was the case. The number of those who said things are going badly, 
meanwhile, increased from 15% to 23%. 
</P>
<P>
"This remains one of the most desirable areas in California," Baldassare said. 
"However, we're seeing evidence of Orange County slipping from its position of 
excellence to being rated as moderately good." 
</P>
<P>
In two areas -- air quality and traffic -- respondents expressed concern and 
frustration. But they also showed an unwillingness to adapt their behavior to 
help solve those problems, he said. "In both issue areas, people want things 
done, but . . . they are not willing to make sacrifices themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Among the survey's findings: 
</P>
<P>
About one in six residents say they are interested in moving out of Orange 
County; in 1982, the figure was closer to one in 10. San Diego County was the 
single most popular out-of-county destination, mentioned by 16% of those with 
thoughts of leaving; almost two-thirds said they would leave Southern 
California altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Although air pollution is viewed as a big problem in Orange County, residents 
here think it is a bigger problem in other parts of Southern California. And 
while a majority of those polled said they favor clean air "at any cost," fewer 
than half support measures that would directly impinge on their life style. 
</P>
<P>
Residents still see traffic (40%) and growth (17%) as the county's most serious 
problems. But the percentage of respondents who cite those two problems first 
has dropped 15 points since 1987, when 72% mentioned them. The number 
mentioning housing and crime, meanwhile, has doubled in the last two years to 
26%. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are quite perturbed about traffic, but they're starting to 
become desensitized to it," Baldassare said. "Other things are taking their 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse is far and away the most serious social ill on residents' minds. 
Fifty-four percent of those polled cited it first -- up 9 points from last 
year. Another 14% cited health care as the most serious problem, up from 10% in 
1988. Just 12% cited homelessness as the county's No. 1 social problem, down 
from 16% in 1988, while those who ranked child care first dropped from 13% in 
1988 to 7%. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-four percent of respondents who commute to work said they do so alone -- 
about the same as the 82% who said they drove solo in the poll's first year, 
1982. Overall, 60% of the poll respondents say their commute has gotten worse. 
But 69% of South County residents say it is worse, compared to 56% for the rest 
of the county. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the poll respondents -- 52% -- favor building new freeways, 
while 42% support building added lanes. Just 7% said they were satisfied with 
the current freeway system. 
</P>
<P>
A whopping 59% of respondents -- the highest percentage in the survey's history 
-- said local growth controls are not strict enough. Thirty-five percent said 
restrictions are "about right," while 5% said they are too strict. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, residents of central Orange County -- Garden Grove, Santa Ana, 
Tustin and Costa Mesa -- were most likely to say that tighter restrictions are 
needed, with 65% of respondents from those areas taking that position. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty percent of the survey respondents said they regularly volunteer their 
time to charities -- below the national average. The rate of charitable giving, 
meanwhile, after dropping last year to just 0.4% of median income, returned to 
the 1987 level of 0.6% -- still far below the national average of about 2%. 
During the same period, median income in the county rose 2% to $45,000, while 
inflation rose 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Housing payments appear to be leveling off. Half the survey respondents who own 
their homes make mortgage payments of at least $750 a month; that figure was 
49% last year. Similarly, the percentage of renters who pay $750 or more rose 
just 1 point, to 38%. 
</P>
<P>
The rate of home ownership in the county has remained unchanged since the 
survey's inception in 1982. Homeowners make up 65% of Orange County residents. 
</P>
<P>
But 81% of renters hope to own their own homes someday, and 36% say they are 
"very likely" to buy within the next three years -- 13% more than were 
similarly optimistic last year. 
</P>
<P>
The hopefulness among renters is not unexpected, or necessarily false, 
Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're dealing with a profile of people who tend to be more affluent, more 
educated; who tend to have things work out their way in their life," Baldassare 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, while they see the quality of life in the county deteriorating, residents 
are optimistic about their own lives. Fifty-six percent said they think they 
will be better off financially a year from now, compared to 52% last year. 
</P>
<P>
But the same qualities that make them somewhat optimistic in the face of 
growing urban problems may also make them more stubborn in their opposition to 
proposed solutions to those problems. It also may help explain their defeat of 
Measure M, this year's proposed sales tax measure for transportation, and of 
last year's slow-growth measure, Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's harder to tell them what to do," he said of Orange County residents. 
"They reject the idea that someone is going to come along and tell them they 
know how to make things better in their community, whether it's car-pooling or 
mowing the lawn."

POLITICS, SCIENCE SHIFT BUSH STAND ON GLOBAL WARMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's proposal to negotiate a global warming treaty at a U.S. 
conference next year -- a reversal of his position just six weeks ago -- 
followed weeks of criticism of his cautious approach and the conversion of his 
chief science adviser to the idea, scientists, environmentalists and government 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
D. Allan Bromley, Bush's science adviser, met with experts on global warming 
two weeks before the Malta summit to be briefed on scientific evidence on the 
phenomenon. A participant at the meeting concluded, based on remarks Bromley 
made, that the once-reluctant science adviser had a change of heart after he 
"got up on the learning curve" of the science, was "beaten up" by Congress for 
moving slowly, and realized that European nations would charge ahead without 
the United States if Bush continued to drag his feet. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's invitation to hold the session represents a response to international 
and domestic criticism of his previous go-slow approach and suggests that the 
White House is now willing to afford global warming the importance already 
granted it by several other Western nations. The decision also indicates a 
softening of skepticism on the issue by Bromley. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, Dr. Bromley seems to be warming up to global warming," said an 
Administration source who declined to be identified. "This is far and away a 
more progressive position for the United States to take. . . . It looks as if 
some people have begun to realize that the politics of global warming is pretty 
important here." 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Albert Gore (D-Tenn.), one of the chief congressional critics of the 
Administration's handling of global warming, remained dubious of the White 
House move. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing Bromley has discovered in the last month is political reality," 
Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental Protection Agency chief William Reilly had previously sought 
unsuccessfully to persuade Bush to call for a treaty-writing conference. 
Reilly's proposal was rejected by the White House Domestic Policy Council six 
weeks ago at the urging of Bromley and White House Chief of Staff John H. 
Sununu. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Bromley was "semi-ignorant" on the subject and wanted to "go 
slow," recalled Michael Oppenheimer, a senior Environmental Defense Fund 
scientist who helped brief Bromley two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"With Bromley on (Reilly's) side -- a well-respected scientist and the top 
technical man in government -- the odds changed a little bit," Oppenheimer 
said. "I think Bromley changed because he is a man of reason. He was made to 
focus on the issue because of politics but . . . his judgment is a technically 
sound one." 
</P>
<P>
The burning of oil, coal and other fossil fuels that create carbon dioxide and 
the destruction of forests that absorb the gas are causing a warming of the 
atmosphere that scientists say could turn verdant pastures into deserts and 
cause sea levels to rise. The United States and the Soviet Union together 
produce more than 40% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that the phenomenon, known as the greenhouse effect, will bring 
about climatic changes but do not agree on when they will occur or on their 
severity. For example, there is still uncertainity over exactly how the warming 
trend will affect the frequency and intensity of hurricanes and droughts. 
</P>
<P>
F. Sherwood Rowland, a chemistry professor at UC Irvine who pioneered research 
on the destruction of the Earth's ozone layer, said Bromley's background gives 
him more clout than previous scientific advisers. Bromley is a nuclear 
physicist from Yale University. 
</P>
<P>
At a world conference hosted by the the Netherlands the week after the Domestic 
Policy Council debate, relations between the EPA administrator and the science 
adviser appeared to be delicate, and representatives of environmental groups 
publicly charged that Bromley had been sent to the meeting as a White House 
watchdog. 
</P>
<P>
After the United States and Japan succeeded in watering down a declaration that 
called for stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions by the turn of the 
century, the Administration was denounced by members of both parties of 
Congress and other industrial nations that wanted to forge a major agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Bromley told The Times over the weekend that Bush's change had come about 
because "we know a lot more now than we knew even a few months ago." Several 
scientific experts on global warming said Monday there have been no major new 
findings on the warming trend in recent months, nor any new conclusions or 
reports on its economic repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely nothing," said Gordon MacDonald, chief scientist and vice president 
of the Miter Corp., a Virginia-based nonprofit business that works with the 
Department of Defense in the design and development of computer and radio 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald, a greenhouse-effect expert who attended the recent session with 
Bromley, called it an "educational" meeting. "He was very much interested in 
what the state of science is, what we knew and what we didn't," recalled 
MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald said Bromley made it clear that global warming now has his attention 
and he wants "to learn" about it. 
</P>
<P>
Rafe Pomerance, a global warming expert at the World Resources Institute, a 
Washington-based environmental think tank, said Bromley has been "on a steep 
learning curve" since early congressional hearings, when "his knowledge of the 
issues was not very complete." 
</P>
<P>
Even before the President's call for the negotiating meeting, Administration 
officials had indicated that the United States might be prepared to begin work 
on an accord next year. The Bush Administration is not expected to unveil its 
own program and targets for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other 
greenhouse gases until the World Meteorological Convention next November in 
Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said that Bush told Reilly in a brief telephone call 
Thursday that he would call for a conference with the United States as host. 
The President had not discussed greenhouse policy with Reilly since the Holland 
meeting, although Reilly has met several times with Bromley and Sununu.

CZECHOSLOVAKS RENEW CALL FOR GOVERNMENT TO RESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Czechoslovaks renewed their massive street protests Monday as more than 150,000 
people jammed into the capital's main square to demand the resignation of a 
Communist-dominated government appointed only the day before. 
</P>
<P>
The protest set up a new confrontation between the country's recently formed 
opposition movement pressing for free elections and Czechoslovakia's 
beleaguered Communist Party, which is fighting an increasingly desperate battle 
to survive. 
</P>
<P>
After briefly stunning the opposition by taking 16 of 21 seats in the new 
Cabinet named Sunday, the Communists by late Monday showed signs of being once 
again on the retreat. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition Civic Forum speakers set a Sunday deadline for a new, more balanced 
government and threatened a general strike the following day to underscore 
their resolve. 
</P>
<P>
"We demand a complete change of government by next Sunday that will reflect the 
new mood of the people," declared Jiri Cerny, a Civic Forum member. 
</P>
<P>
The new government is transitional, with its principal mandate to prepare 
Czechoslvakia for its first free elections in over 40 years, possibly by next 
July. 
</P>
<P>
There were also large anti-government demonstrations in Bratislava, Ostrava and 
other cities. 
</P>
<P>
In another significant move Monday, Civic Forum said it will for the first time 
nominate individuals for interim government posts. 
</P>
<P>
"Civic Forum will support certain persons toward this new government," 
spokesman Vaclav Maly said. 
</P>
<P>
The group's resistance to put forward specific names despite requests by 
Communist Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec may have been one reason for the 
preponderance of Communists in the government that was announced, analysts 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum also said it plans to endorse a slate of candidates for the 
national elections next year but will still not declare itself a political 
party. 
</P>
<P>
The tactic is similar to that successfully employed by the Polish opposition 
group Solidarity, whose endorsement guided voters to otherwise unknown 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The size of the crowd in Prague and the power of its response to speaker after 
speaker seemed to visibly revive spirits among exhausted opposition leaders, 
who had appeared shocked and in disarray after the unveiling Sunday of a new 
Communist-dominated government. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders had called for an interim government "of professionals and 
technocrats" to lead the country toward full democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was filled with faces young and old, and entire families huddled 
together trying to keep warm in the freezing fog. 
</P>
<P>
Euphoria Missing 
</P>
<P>
Monday's mass protest carried little of the elation and euphoria that came with 
the first doses of freedom two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the gathering had a distinctly harder, impatient edge as speakers 
demanded an end to Communist-dominated government. 
</P>
<P>
The demands, which also including the resignation of President Gustav Husak, 
were met by roars of approval that echoed through the frigid late autumn 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Husak was installed as Communist Party leader after the 1968 Soviet-led 
invasion that toppled party leader Alexander Dubcek and ended his Prague Spring 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
While the initial demonstrations last month that toppled party leader Milos 
Jakes' regime focused heavily on personalities within the ruling Politburo, the 
issue had broadened Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators seemed to be rejecting communism as such. 
</P>
<P>
"We are fed up, we are fed up!" the crowd shouted at one point, while on 
another occasion, the chant, "We hate them, we hate them" rose from the 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
One sign read: "Five Crumbs Won't Feed Us" -- a reference to the five 
non-Communist posts in the new Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, there were also calls to punish those members of the 
hierarchy who had already resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum protest organizers have consistently stressed the moral element of 
their movement and fretted about possible violence. 
</P>
<P>
"People can only be insulted so often," said Michal Horaceck, a Civic Forum 
negotiator, expressing concern that the refusal of the Communists to yield 
power was adding to tensions in the street. 
</P>
<P>
Protest organizers Monday did not immediately call for another demonstration 
for today, instead telling early risers to listen on the radio for 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
In an agreement worked out in recent days with the government, Civic Forum was 
awarded 1 1/2 hours of radio time, including the 6:30-7 a.m. slot, a time of 
peak listening in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to protesters, a representative of the Workers Strike Committee, 
Igor Pleskot, called for elections of the Communist-dominated trade union 
committees by Dec. 20 and an end to party committees at workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
Others called for the abolition of the party's praetorian guard, a body known 
as the People's Militia. 
</P>
<P>
While Monday's demonstration was smaller than some previous protests, it was 
seen as enough to regenerate strong political pressure on the Communist Party 
hierarchy to cede more power. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts questioned whether citizens would respond to a new call for 
demonstrations a week after they had been suspended. 
</P>
<P>
There seemed little hesitation among those in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had it up to here with them," commented a middle-aged store clerk as she 
put her hand level with her nose. "I will protest for weeks if I have to." 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the powerful public reaction, Communist Deputy Prime Minister 
Bohumil Urban met with a Civic Forum delegation Monday in talks that reportedly 
centered on how to build a new government.

A Civic Forum strategist described the talks as paving the way for substantive 
negotiations the group hopes to conduct with Adamec when he returns later this 
week from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Czech regional government responsible for the 
administration of Bohemia and Moravia suspended the announcement of its new 
Cabinet lineup, apparently in light of Monday's demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Tough Talks 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum spokesman Josef Lavrosek said late Monday that "tough" negotiations 
were under way with Frantisek Pitra, premier of the Czech republic government, 
for a new lineup that might contain a minority of Communists. The governments 
of the Czech and Slovak republics control key areas such as justice and 
education in their respective regions. 
</P>
<P>
The Czechoslovak Communists were also buffeted by the mass resignations of 
their East German colleagues and the Warsaw Pact statement in Moscow that 
condemned the 1968 invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition figures predicted the additional weight of such a joint 
international declaration would further damage those members of the country's 
Communist leadership linked with the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's inevitable that the president and a few dozen very high officials and 
members of Parliament will have to resign," said Civic Forum's Jan Urban. "It 
will mean that in a very short time, they will have to rehabilitate one-half 
million people." 
</P>
<P>
In the years after the invasion, Jakes led a purge of Dubcek and the liberal 
wing of the party that supported him that resulted in the expulsion of nearly 
half a million party members.

stunned the opposition by taking 16 of 21 seats in the transitional regime --

ON CALIFORNIA: IMAGE-MAKERS CAN'T HEAL A SHAKEN CITY

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Take a walk through downtown San Francisco these days and you will see the 
change from Christmases past. The buzz of the streets has dimmed. Store crowds 
are thin, the restaurants partially filled. The city is not dead, exactly. Just 
subdued. 
</P>
<P>
It's the earthquake and its aftermath. San Francisco has not bounced back the 
way the city fathers had predicted. The situation has so alarmed the downtown 
business establishment that Mayor Art Agnos spent most of last week on a tour 
of eastern cities trying to get the tourists back in their wide-bodies and 
headed west once again. 
</P>
<P>
This trip was interesting because it made two assumptions. First, that the 
collective decision by thousands of tourists to stay away from San Francisco 
was irrational. And second, that their return would solve the city's problems. 
</P>
<P>
On the local news each evening, Agnos and his entourage were shown making slide 
presentations to travel executives. There were happy shots of cable cars 
climbing to the stars and the Fairmont Hotel standing undamaged atop Nob Hill. 
This presentation was engineered to correct the image of a city in ruins, an 
image that Agnos believes was erroneously stamped into the memories of 
television viewers during the quake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not press coverage unfairly sullied the city, that issue did not 
seem paramount in the minds of the travel officials. In news reports of the 
tour, the executives repeatedly raised another fear, one that was not so easily 
dismissed. They said their customers were afraid of the next earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
It was an issue that seemed to irritate the mayor, perhaps because it could not 
be waved away with a slide presentation. At one point an industry official 
asked Agnos just what assessment geologists were making about the possibility 
of another quake. 
</P>
<P>
"Geologists talk too much," Agnos snapped. 
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding the gabbiness of geologists, the travel executives were 
probably correct in their sense of the real issue. San Francisco has remained 
stunned because Oct. 17 stripped away the pretense that earthquakes are remote 
dangers. What's remarkable is that people outside California -- "tourists" -- 
seemed to have absorbed this lesson more fully than we who live here. 
</P>
<P>
On second thought, maybe it's not so remarkable. People always diminish the 
beast that lives next door. Once I was being carted up Sicily's Mt. Etna on a 
tour bus, and we passed a town built on the volcanic ash of past eruptions. The 
guide said the residents chose to regard the volcano as "their friend," and she 
meant to imply they were brave people. Two years later the town was burned away 
in a new eruption. 
</P>
<P>
And so with us in California. We see the earthquake strike, we see the pictures 
of a freeway clamped shut like a tomb, and then we go back to our lives as if 
the earthquake was our friend. For most of us, in truth, there's little choice 
in the matter, and denial of the danger is as good a device as any. 
</P>
<P>
But let's not mistake who's being rational, and who's not. The good people of 
Iowa and Pennsylvania don't have to diminish this danger; they can afford to 
see it clearly. And until enough time passes for them to conveniently forget 
about Oct. 17, a certain percentage will probably choose to visit cities where 
they can sit in a revolving restaurant, sip a mai tai and not worry about 
taking the big dive to the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Even more interesting was the second assumption of the Agnos tour, namely that 
the missing tourists were the sum total of the problem. In fact, the city's air 
of quiet is more widespread than that, and more mysterious. It seems that San 
Franciscans themselves are staying home. You can go to the local joints and see 
the same empty chairs that you see in the tourist haunts. 
</P>
<P>
I have a friend here who was standing in her kitchen when the earthquake 
struck. Like most people she was not hurt and does not even know anyone who 
suffered an injury. But the shaking, the intensity of it, did something to her. 
Now, six weeks later, she finds herself going straight home after work, putting 
on an old pair of flannel pajamas and crawling into bed by 8:30. She cannot 
explain her behavior except to say that somehow it makes her feel safe. 
</P>
<P>
She is not gloomy in reporting this. She intends to continue the flannel 
pajamas routine until she feels like going out again. 
</P>
<P>
And the truth is the city does not feel gloomy either. More than anything it 
seems like a San Francisco from a slightly earlier time. Say, 1962. After 
Dashiell Hammett, before Ken Kesey. People are a little more polite, seem to 
have a little more time. It won't last, of course. So if you liked 1962, make 
Mayor Agnos happy and get up here quick.

U.S. HIGH COURT AGREES TO RULE ON STATE-FEDERAL WATER RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Supreme Court said Monday it would decide whether states or federal 
regulators control the water that flows into hydroelectric power plants -- a 
dispute with vital environmental and economic consequences in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for California, joined by 43 other states and key national 
environmental groups, say state officials may protect fish by limiting the 
water diverted into power plants. 
</P>
<P>
But federal regulators, backed by the power industry, say that the financial 
health of hundreds of plants could be threatened if states are allowed to limit 
the flow of water to them. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute arose over a small privately owned power plant on a tributary of 
the American River near Placerville in Northern California. But the conflict 
itself dates back to passage of the Federal Power Act in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
The law gave the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the authority to regulate 
all aspects of hydroelectric power plants, but another section of the law said 
that nothing in it preempts state authority "relating to the control, 
appropriation, use or distribution of water." 
</P>
<P>
For more than four decades, the Supreme Court has sided with federal regulators 
in power plant disputes, but Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, a states' 
rights proponent, may be ready to tip the balance in the other direction. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1946 case of First Iowa Hydro-Electric Cooperative vs. the Federal Power 
Commission, the high court ruled that the federal regulators may grant a power 
license without getting a state's approval. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a 1978 case, known as California vs. U.S., involving federal dams 
and irrigation, Rehnquist said that states could put conditions on the 
operation of federal projects. State attorneys hope that Rehnquist, as chief 
justice, can fashion a majority to overrule the First Iowa decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Our view is that the states are entitled to have their own separate voice in 
these matters," said California Deputy Atty. Gen. Roderick E. Walston. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the nation's hydroelectric power is generated in the western 
states, he said, but low levels of rainfall also cut the river flow during 
several months of the year. In California, there are 492 hydroelectric power 
plants licensed to operate and use water flowing in rivers and streams, he 
said. Some are owned by private investors, others by utilities and still others 
by regional government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for these plants say they were built and licensed with the 
understanding that they could depend on a single set of water regulations from 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. It would scare off investors, they 
say, if states could limit the water flow. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the broad impact of a potential Supreme Court ruling, the actual stakes 
in the case before the court are quite small. 
</P>
<P>
They concern a trout spawning area in a one-mile stretch of the South Fork of 
the American River. In 1987, the Rock Creek power plant was licensed to take 
water out of the river, run it through the turbines and return it to the river 
one mile downstream. During the dry season, the plant was required to maintain 
a "minimum flow" in the river of 11 cubic feet per second. 
</P>
<P>
But the state Water Resources Control Board said the plant must maintain a 
river of 30 cubic feet, nearly three times as much. Otherwise, it said, the 
trout would suffer. 
</P>
<P>
In response, federal regulatory officials said California had no authority to 
set its own water-flow requirements, and in June, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals upheld that decision. The case of California vs. Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission, 89-333, will be heard early next year, with a ruling due 
by July. 
</P>
<P>
In another action, the court let stand a ruling allowing damage suits against 
the federal government for injuries caused by servicemen on military bases. 
This case grew out of an accident at the Point Mugu Navy base near Oxnard. The 
ruling applies throughout California and the other western states. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, 10-year-old Christa Washington, who lived in naval housing, was badly 
burned by an explosion caused by two off-duty servicemen. In February, the 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the federal government is responsible for 
the conduct of its servicemen on base and, therefore, must pay for Christa's 
injuries. The Justice Department appealed without success. (U.S. vs. 
Washington, 89-482.)

JURY SELECTION BEGINS IN MONTOYA'S BRIBERY TRIAL

Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), the first legislator indicted in a federal 
corruption probe in the state Capitol, went on trial Monday on 12 counts of 
extortion, bribery, racketeering and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Milton Schwartz, joined by prosecutors, Montoya and his 
attorneys, spent much of the day questioning individual jurors in private in an 
effort to impanel a jury that has not been influenced by media coverage of the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers predicted that a jury would be selected by today and that attorneys 
would deliver their opening statements Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Montoya stem from a sting operation in which undercover FBI 
agents gave the senator $3,000 during a breakfast meeting. The exchange of 
money -- later reported by Montoya as an honorarium -- was secretly videotaped 
by another agent. Federal prosecutors also have alleged that Montoya solicited 
bribes in exchange for his vote on specific bills. 
</P>
<P>
But Michael Sands, Montoya's attorney, expressed confidence in the senator's 
innocence. "We're ready to try a very good case," Sands told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, U.S. Atty. David Levi, who is prosecuting Montoya, filed a 
list of 63 probable witnesses, including actor Ed Asner, Gene Upshaw, executive 
director of the NFL Players Assn., and former sports agent Michael Trope. 
</P>
<P>
Among those on the list of prosecution witnesses were six current and former 
members of Montoya's staff, 14 lobbyists and various state officials, including 
former acting State Treasurer Elizabeth Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
Also included were Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), himself a subject of the 
federal probe, Sen. Rose Ann Vuich (D-Dinuba), and former Assemblyman Bruce 
Young, whose conviction of mail fraud in an earlier Capitol corruption case was 
overturned.

The U.S. Navy successfully launched a Trident 2 missile from a submarine 
submerged off the coast of Florida on Monday, but not before ramming a hole in 
the side of a Greenpeace vessel and towing away protesters who sought to stop 
the test. 
</P>
<P>
Navy spokesmen say the launch of the $26.5-million missile from the submarine 
Tennessee put the troubled Trident program back on track after its last two 
test shots blew up seconds after they broke water. Monday's test firing could 
mean the Navy will meet a March deadline to load the first missile armed with a 
nuclear warhead on the Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
The actual firing of the missile, which rocketed skyward at 10:20 a.m., was 
almost anticlimactic, however, following a two-hour battle at sea which began 
just after dawn in choppy waters about 50 miles east of Cape Canaveral. After a 
Navy submarine support ship put a 3-foot gash in the side of the environmental 
activists' 190-foot ocean-going tugboat and knocked out its engines by pouring 
water down its smokestacks, Navy commandos boarded two Greenpeace inflatable 
rafts, punctured the boats' pontoons and slashed fuel lines. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation was the most serious yet between the Navy and Greenpeace, 
which has vowed to scuttle the $160-billion Trident missile program by 
preventing test launches. In July, the environmentalists did stop one launch by 
following the Tennessee out to sea in its tugboat, called Greenpeace, and 
sending out two inflatable rafts to positions above the submerged submarine. 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, the Navy was ready. "We expected them to expect us, and it was 
clear from the start they were prepared," said Steve Shallhorn, coordinator for 
Greenpeace USA's Nuclear Free Seas campaign, who was aboard the tug. 
</P>
<P>
About 7 a.m., after Greenpeace Capt. Richard Whibley refused a Navy warning to 
leave the area, Shallhorn said the Grasp approached the Greenpeace's port side 
and "repeatedly rammed us, eight or ten times." When the tug began to take on 
water, a hole just above the waterline was plugged with mattresses, Greenpeace 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the Grasp, a second Navy vessel, the submarine rescue ship 
Kittiwake, rammed the tug on the starboard side, Shallhorn said. "They 
sandwiched us. They were there to disable the ship," he charged. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Shallhorn added, Navy crewmen used fire hoses to drench many 
of the 32 people aboard the Greenpeace, and also poured water down the ship's 
smokestacks. For a while, Shallhorn said, the Greenpeace was dead in the water. 
One engine was later started. 
</P>
<P>
For the next 90 minutes, Shallhorn said, the Greenpeace circled the area, 
evading the Navy vessels while launching two inflatable boats called Zodiacs, 
each with a two-man crew. When the Zodiacs hovered over the spot where the 
Tennessee had submerged -- marked by its antenna -- the Navy countered by 
sending out two boatloads of commandos dressed in camouflage and wearing 
visored helmets. After disabling the Zodiacs, the commandos towed the rafts 
back to the Greenpeace. 
</P>
<P>
Navy Vice Adm. Roger Bacon, commander of the Atlantic submarine fleet, told 
pool reporters aboard the amphibious transport dock Nashville, that the 
activists ignored "at least 50 and maybe more" warnings to leave the area. "We 
used the minimum force necessary to clear the area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bacon told Reuters news service that the Dutch-registered Greenpeace was 
"bumped and damaged" by the Grasp, which mistakenly rammed the Greenpeace while 
it sprayed the protest ship with water from fire hoses. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries in the encounter. Once the protesters' vessels were 
muscled outside the 5,000-yard diameter safety circle, the Tennessee fired the 
44-foot missile out of a tube in the deck. It broke the Atlantic surface, 
ignited and propelled a dummy warhead package to an ocean target several 
thousand miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Bahouth, executive director of Greenpeace USA, called the Navy's action 
"a terrible outrage." 
</P>
<P>
"This is an unbridled act of aggression against a peaceful protest in 
international waters. The Navy's assertion that it was acting within 
international law is absolute nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
"Had our vessel belonged to a foreign government it would have been an act of 
war." 
</P>
<P>
The Greenpeace vessel limped toward port at Jacksonville on one engine Monday 
evening. But Shallhorn, evacuated from the ship by helicopter and interviewed 
by telephone from Cape Canaveral, said the environmentalists would not quit the 
fight. "The Navy may have won that tactical situation," he said. "But we'll see 
if this missile system ever gets put into production."

LARGE RETIN-A STUDY FINDS MODEST SKIN IMPROVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Preliminary results of the largest study of its kind have confirmed that the 
active ingredient in Retin-A can produce modest cosmetic improvements in 
sun-damaged or aged skin, UC Irvine researchers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of a two-year study, 68% of 657 patients nationwide 
showed some improvement in wrinkles or sunspots using an emollient cream with 
.05% retinoic acid (tretinoin). A control group showed only 38% improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"This statistically significant difference reflects modest changes for the 
average patient," said Gerald Weinstein, professor and chair of dermatology at 
UC Irvine College of Medicine. Weinstein presented the results Monday at the 
annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The study suggests that, though the tretinoin cream does have an effect, it 
will not replace plastic surgery, Weinstein said. The study was sponsored by 
Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., which manufactures Retin-A. 
</P>
<P>
Retin-A, federally approved only for the treatment of acne, has been prescribed 
by some dermatologists for cosmetic improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Retin-A ointment, which usually has an alcohol base, frequently produces 
temporary skin irritation. The researchers had hoped to avoid this by using a 
cream base, but the cream also produced temporary skin irritation in 90% of the 
patients studied. 
</P>
<P>
Previous reports on the beneficial aspects of tretinoin from the University of 
Pennsylvania and the University of Michigan studied groups of only 48 and 30, 
respectively. Their studies used a higher concentration of the drug and showed 
greater amounts of improvement.

Bowing to intense U.S. pressure and the urging of friends including the Soviet 
Union, the Palestine Liberation Organization agreed not to press for a vote 
Monday on a resolution that would enhance its U.N. status. 
</P>
<P>
Its U.N. observer, Zehdi Labib Terzi, told reporters, "We are not pushing for a 
vote this afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to say how long the deferment will extend. But many delegates said 
no vote is expected before the General Assembly adjourns by the middle of the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO's demand to be called the "State of Palestine" was backed by all Arab 
countries except for Egypt and Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
But Washington has threatened to withhold its 25% share of the U.N.'s annual 
$850-million budget if the PLO is upgraded from an observer organization to 
that of an observer state, putting it on the same level as North and South 
Korea, Switzerland and the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and other Western countries say the state proclaimed by the 
Palestine National Council in Algiers in November, 1988, lacks many of the 
legal attributes of statehood, including control of territory and population 
and an effective government.

Soviet military personnel in East Germany detained a team of U.S. military 
officers for 7 1/2 hours on the eve of President Bush's summit with Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Pentagon said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no U.S. or Soviet injuries. U.S. personnel were released later that 
day. The incident is under investigation," a Pentagon spokesman, Navy Lt. Cmdr. 
Ken Satterfield, said. 
</P>
<P>
Satterfield said the U.S. team was "on their assigned mission" which involved 
observing installations near Halle in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how many U.S. and Soviet personnel were involved 
in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the vehicle in which the U.S. team was riding was held and 
"a tire was punctured with a bayonet." Satterfield said the team was not 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
The incident, which was confirmed by several other Pentagon officials, has 
raised tempers among some military officers. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military mission in Potsdam was established under a 1947 accord that 
allowed the Western allies and the Soviets to set up such offices in each 
other's occupied zones of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The incident had not been announced by U.S. authorities, and Pentagon officials 
offered information about it when questioned by reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want to elevate this," said one Pentagon source, referring to 
efforts by U.S. officials to minimize the incident at a time of improving 
U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
Satterfield said he was not aware that any official protest had been filed over 
the detention. 
</P>
<P>
"The incident was not routine, but it's not unheard of, either," he said. "It's 
being handled on a military-to-military basis." 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the liaison officers operate under an agreement that allows 
contentious issues such as these to be discussed between U.S. and Soviet 
military commanders. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Army Maj. Arthur D. Nicholson Jr., 37, assigned to the U.S. military 
liaison mission at Potsdam, was killed by Soviet guards near the town of 
Ludwigslust, in East Germany. Soviets officials said at the time that Nicholson 
was taking photographs in a restricted area.

A court affirmed Monday that a Palestinian facing charges here of murder in an 
unrelated case is also a suspect in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, and it 
approved the seizure of evidence in his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed abu Talb, 35, is believed to be the first suspect to face a court 
proceeding in connection with the bombing of the jumbo jet on Dec. 21, 1988, 
over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people. 
</P>
<P>
"The court finds that Abu Talb is suspected in Scotland of murder or as an 
accessory to murder," the brief District Court ruling said. 
</P>
<P>
Clothing seized in the raid "can be presumed to carry importance for the 
investigation," it said. 
</P>
<P>
The court classified its hearing records as secret and ordered any evidence 
removed from Sweden to be returned when the investigation is completed. Abu 
Talb, listed in court documents as Abo Talb, appeared at a closed hearing 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A verdict in the case of Abu Talb and three other Palestinians is expected Dec. 
21. Their trial ended Nov. 15 on charges of murder and attempted murder in four 
bombings in Copenhagen, Amsterdam and Stockholm in 1985 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Jamila Mograbi, who is divorced from Abu Talb but still lives with him, denied 
that he was involved in the Pan Am bombing but would not discuss the other 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Abu Talb is a former member of the Palestine Popular Struggle Front, a group 
based in Syria. 
</P>
<P>
Mograbi said three Scottish detectives and seven Swedish officers searched the 
apartment last week for clothing traceable to Malta, virtually emptying the 
closets and filling 15 plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are said to have identified clothing originating in Malta from 
the suitcase they believe contained the bomb that downed Pan Am Flight 103. 
</P>
<P>
That flight, bound for New York, switched planes in London.

DEATH, DOMESTICITY MIX IN 'LAUREL VS. HARDY' WAR

The altar was makeshift: flickering candles on a wooden barricade bearing the 
warning "War Zone, Do Not Enter." 
</P>
<P>
But the dozens of people gathered there Monday night seemed not to mind. They 
linked arms, closed their eyes and prayed as machine-gun fire echoed down the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a prayer for peace," Rosario Saab, 25, an architecture student, said, 
"praying that it will be over soon." 
</P>
<P>
But peace seemed far away in Makati, Manila's financial and commercial 
district. It was a deserted no-man's-land, where rebel snipers fired on 
anything that moved, skirmished with soldiers and turned high-rise apartment 
buildings into towers of terror. 
</P>
<P>
"My windows are shot out," a Philippine travel agent who lives in a 
fourth-floor apartment told a caller through her tears. "I put the mattress up. 
. . . Snipers are all around me." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it was Philippine-style war. Another resident said that after a brutal 
firefight Monday morning, three rebels put down their weapons and began 
sweeping up trash discarded by the troops in front of the Twin Towers 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
A frustrated foreign resident who has watched the fighting said he has not been 
impressed with either side's ability. 
</P>
<P>
"The armed forces versus the rebels," he said, "is like Laurel versus Hardy." 
</P>
<P>
A Makati businessman, pinned down with his wife in their 11th-floor apartment 
since Saturday, said rebels who held his building spent the afternoon relaxing 
and reading newspapers in lounge chairs by the pool. 
</P>
<P>
He said one came up, knocked on the kitchen door and politely asked if he could 
watch TV. The maid said no, and the rebel left. Somewhat anxious, the 
businessman quickly called downstairs and offered a rebel officer TV and food. 
</P>
<P>
"He said they're eating great meals, getting it catered from the hotels they've 
occupied," the businessman said. "And he said he didn't think his men should 
watch TV because the media reports are all false. They've been absolute 
gentlemen." 
</P>
<P>
A foreign resident told a similar story: "They've been very polite. If they ask 
for food and you say no, they say OK and try next door." 
</P>
<P>
The fighting is seen as a spectator sport by many Manila youths -- some of whom 
died in the cross-fire. Crowds have repeatedly gone into areas where fighting 
was in progress, watching and sometimes cheering, then cowering as the shooting 
moved their way. Boys selling cigarettes ran from one barricade to the next, 
hawking their wares. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals report that as many as half the casualties so far are civilians. At 
least 70 people have been reported killed and 500 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
On Ayala Avenue, scores of spectators stood on five fire engines that had been 
drawn up as a barricade. When mortars began thumping down the street, everyone 
ran. Half an hour later, the crowds were back around the smoking, shell-scarred 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
For a third straight day, heavy shooting erupted at sunrise today near the 
Hotel Inter-Continental, which apparently has become rebel headquarters. 
Government troops have used the Manila Mandarin Hotel, about half a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
Rebels continued to hold the Twin Towers and Ritz Towers condominium complexes, 
the Hotel Nikko Manila Garden, the Landmark Supermart, the Philippine Long 
Distance Telephone offices, the Philippine Commercial International Bank 
building and several other office and apartment complexes.

MENCKEN WAS PRO-NAZI, HIS DIARY SHOWS

<P>
The previously secret diary of writer and social critic H. L. Mencken discloses 
virulent anti-Semitism, racism and pro-Nazi leanings, shocking even the 
sympathetic Mencken scholar who edited it. 
</P>
<P>
On Mencken's instructions, the diary, typewritten on 2,100 pages from 1930 to 
1948, remained sealed for 25 years after his death in 1956. The Baltimore 
Evening Sun, where Mencken once worked, published excerpts Monday. The diary 
has been available to scholars since 1981, but quoting either directly or 
indirectly from the 2,100-page document was prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of Jews, Mencken wrote in December, 1943, that the Maryland Club 
had decided against admitting any more Jewish members after the only one on its 
rolls died. "There is no other Jew in Baltimore who seems suitable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of blacks, he wrote in September, 1943, that " . . . it is impossible to talk 
anything resembling discretion or judgment to a colored woman. They are all 
essentially child-like, and even hard experience does not teach them anything." 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 24, 1945, he wrote that "the course of the United States in World War 
II . . . was dishonest, dishonorable and ignominious, and the Sunpapers, in 
supporting (President Franklin D.) Roosevelt's foreign policy, shared in this 
disgrace." 
</P>
<P>
The book, "The Diary of H. L. Mencken," was edited by Mencken scholar Charles 
A. Fecher of Baltimore and published by Alfred A. Knopf. It was scheduled for 
January release but is already available in many bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
The delay in publishing the diary stemmed from legal questions over whether 
Mencken intended it to be published, as well as concern over the extremely 
unflattering statements in it. 
</P>
<P>
Mencken is revered by many writers and journalists for his erudite writing and 
often brilliant social and political criticism. The National Press Club in 
Washington has a library named in his honor and the Baltimore Sun bestows an 
annual writing award named for him. 
</P>
<P>
He spent 40 years at the Evening Sun, edited the Smart Set and the American 
Mercury magazines and wrote dozens of books. 
</P>
<P>
"His feelings about World War II are incredible in a man of his intelligence, 
knowledge and perception," Fecher wrote in his introduction to the book. "He 
seems to have had no conception at all of what a German-Japanese victory would 
have meant to the civilized world, or to the liberties that he himself so 
cherished." 
</P>
<P>
Mencken's attitude toward blacks "was a curious mingling of total 
egalitarianism . . . and patronizing superiority," Fecher wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Mencken regularly published black writers in American Mercury and persuaded his 
publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, to publish their books. The last article he wrote 
for the Evening Sun in 1948 attacked segregation laws in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
But the diary discloses Mencken's "deeply ingrained conviction that black 
people were by their very nature inferior to white," Fecher wrote.

HIGH COURT DISBARS LAWYER ACCUSED OF DMV BRIBERY

<P>
The state Supreme Court on Monday ordered the disbarment of a Torrance attorney 
charged with passing $400 concealed in matchbooks to a Department of Motor 
Vehicles hearing officer in return for favorable rulings. 
</P>
<P>
The justices rejected contentions by the lawyer, Barry G. Sands, 45, that there 
was not enough evidence to warrant disbarment and that the money was a loan. 
</P>
<P>
"All that matters here is that (Sands) passed something of value to (the 
officer) . . . ," the court said in an unsigned 19-page opinion. "What is 
crucial here is the fact that the passing of the money amounted in substance 
and effect to being a bribe." 
</P>
<P>
Sands declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
The court's action came in a professional discipline case that emerged from a 
17-month criminal investigation by Los Angeles County authorities into the 
activities of Michael R. Tarrish, a DMV hearing officer in Long Beach empowered 
to decide whether to revoke or suspend driver's licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Tarrish, who told investigators he had received payments from several 
attorneys, including Sands, in exchange for favorable decisions, was dismissed 
by the DMV in 1987 and placed on three years' probation after pleading no 
contest to accepting a bribe. 
</P>
<P>
In proceedings before the State Bar of California, Tarrish said that Sands on 
four separate occasions had bought him lunch, discussed his clients' cases and 
each time passed him a matchbook containing a $100 bill. Sands said he gave 
Tarrish the money because Tarrish had told him of some personal financial 
problems. A hearing panel of the Bar and the Bar's disciplinary review 
department urged disbarment. 
</P>
<P>
In his appeal to the state Supreme Court, Sands denied he had done anything 
unethical, saying it was "common practice" among attorneys to discuss their 
cases informally with DMV hearing officers. He contended further that he should 
not be punished on the dubious testimony of Tarrish, whose cooperation with the 
Bar was required under the conditions of his probation. 
</P>
<P>
The justices agreed that Tarrish's testimony should be given careful scrutiny 
but noted that the hearing panel had found his account "convincing" and 
"credible."

RETIN-A STUDY POINTS TO COSMETIC IMPROVEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Preliminary results of the largest study of its kind have confirmed that the 
active ingredient in Retin-A, the controversial anti-aging drug, can produce 
modest cosmetic improvements in sun-damaged or aged skin, UC Irvine researchers 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of a two-year study, 68% of 657 patients nationwide 
showed some improvement with wrinkles or sunspots using an emollient cream with 
.05% retinoic acid (tretinoin). A control group showed only 38% improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"This statistically significant dif ference reflects modest changes for the 
average patient," said Gerald Weinstein, professor and chairman of dermatology 
at UC Irvine College of Medicine. Weinstein presented the results Monday at the 
annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Although the study proves that the tretinoin cream does have an effect, the 
product will not replace plastic surgery, Weinstein said. The study was 
sponsored by Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., which manufactures Retin-A. 
</P>
<P>
Retin-A, federally approved only for the treatment of acne, has been prescribed 
by some dermatologists for cosmetic improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Retin-A, which usually has an alcohol base, produces temporary skin irritation. 
Researchers had hoped that the cream used in the study would reduce that, but 
90% of the patients studied reported some skin irritation, Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Previous reports on the beneficial aspects of tretinoin from the University of 
Pennsylvania and the University of Michigan studied groups of only 48 and 30, 
respectively. Their studies used a higher concentration of the drug and showed 
greater improvement. 
</P>
<P>
UCI is one of nine centers nationwide participating in the two-year study.

S. COUNTY NEEDS 54 DEPUTIES, REPORT SAYS 
</P>

<P>
Because no additional Orange County sheriff's deputies have been added to 
patrol the unincorporated South County over the past four years -- despite an 
18% annual population increase -- the department needs at least 54 additional 
deputies to provide proper law enforcement, a county report declared Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Prepared by county administrative office senior analyst Fausto Reyes and 
Sheriff's Lt. George Johnson, the report predicts that by the middle of next 
year deputies in the burgeoning South County will receive 67,472 calls for 
assistance -- more than double the number of requests made five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since a single patrol deputy is capable of handling 1,205 calls annually, the 
report stated, the estimated "67,472 calls for service will require an 
additional 54 deputies dispersed over three shifts per day, seven days a week. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
Hiring the additional deputies could cost $3.6 million a year, the report said, 
although a cheaper option might be to hire eight unsworn officers and 20 sworn 
deputies for an annual cost of $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that there is a need to improve the number of officers," 
said Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, who requested the report because his 3rd 
District covers much of the area. Vasquez, a former police officer from the 
city of Orange, said that although 54 new deputies might be needed now, the 
county is faced with fiscal limitations. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the department has 122 deputies in South County operating from the 
South Patrol Bureau, a temporary facility next to the county courthouse in 
Laguna Niguel. Each year the number of calls to the substation has increased by 
about 4,000, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the report was on the supervisors' agenda for their weekly meeting 
today, no action on its recommendations is expected until after the midyear 
budget review in January, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the supervisors might also consider whether the Sheriff's 
Department should add community services officers to help with some of the 
duties in South County. Community service officers do not make arrests but 
generally act as desk officers, taking criminal or accident reports. The new 
study said salaries for the "non-sworn" officers are considerably less while 
they can free sworn deputies to spend more time in patrolling and answering 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez said the Sheriff's Department needs more deputies to increase its 
preventive patrols. 
</P>
<P>
South County is by far the largest unincorporated area patrolled by the 
Sheriff's Department. Although no patrol officers have been added over the past 
five years, new deputies have been hired by the sheriff to work in the county 
jails. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the additional deputies should serve in the areas of El Toro, 
Lake Forest, Aegean Hills, Rancho Santa Margarita, Coto de Caza, Robinson 
Ranch, Laguna Hills, Aliso Viejo, Laguna Niguel and canyon country.

DRIVERS, STRIKERS SKIRMISH AT PLANT

Truck drivers scuffled with picketers Monday outside a Gypsum Canyon 
pavement-products company after the strikers were accused of damaging trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Brea police and county sheriff's deputies were called to Owl Rock Products Co. 
at 1:30 p.m. after two men began fighting outside the plant. No one was injured 
or arrested, Sheriff's Lt. Richard J. Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Company president Calvin B. Allen said picketers with the Operating Engineers 
Local 12 have been harassing truckers crossing into the plant by throwing 
pieces of metal in front of the trucks, puncturing some tires. 
</P>
<P>
Union leaders could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Four truck drivers not employed by Owl Rock Products began the fight after 
their trucks were damaged as they drove into the plant, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys (truckers) got damned tired of it, and they went at them," he said. 
"They gave the picketers a little working over." 
</P>
<P>
The union, which represents heavy-equipment operators, has been striking 
Arcadia-based Owl Rock Products for two months because the company has been 
hiring non-union specialists for some jobs, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies have been called to the plant several times since the strike 
began Sept. 29, Olson said. TOM MCQUEENEY

MOCK ACCIDENT LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Minutes after the lunch bell rang at Huntington Beach High School on Monday, 
sirens blared from every direction. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of the campus, a student -- his face apparently bleeding -- was 
lying on the ground next to a motorcycle embedded in the front end of a 
crumpled compact car. 
</P>
<P>
As students crowded around the police cars, fire trucks, ambulance and 
television cameras, they quickly realized that the accident was not real, but 
staged to begin the Mothers Against Drunk Driving's Red Ribbon Campaign for the 
1989 holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"Project Red Ribbon is a national MADD campaign that asks all Americans to 'tie 
one on for safety.' That is, tie a red ribbon on your car as a pledge to always 
have a sober driver behind the wheel," said MADD President Sherry Metcalfe, 
whose parents were killed by a drunk driver five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
During the holidays, "a lot of people drink who aren't accustomed to drinking," 
said Huntington Beach Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg, "and the accident rate 
goes up in direct relation to alcohol use." 
</P>
<P>
The mock accident "seemed scary. It made me realize what it would be like to 
see someone I know in that kind of an accident," said senior cheerleader Aimee 
Cebulski. "We just had a smashed car (on campus) last year. Something like this 
has a lot more effect." 
</P>
<P>
The mock accident made a strong statement, said senior Chad Little, who played 
the victim in the accident. "Unfortunately, it might take a real accident to 
get to some" students. 
</P>
<P>
In order to solve the problem, people need to be educated to the dangers of 
drunk driving and "the community as a whole must decide that it will not stand 
for it," said Brian Davidson, Huntington Beach police accident investigator.

'SHRINE' A TARGET FOR CONDEMNATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To local historians, it's the city's first city hall. To preservationists, it's 
one of the oldest buildings in the city. To redevelopment officials, it's an 
obsolete building that must be modernized or replaced. 
</P>
<P>
But to 78-year-old Charles Sarrabere, it's a family shrine -- the place where 
his French immigrant father started business in 1916. 
</P>
<P>
"I was practically raised there," said Sarrabere, who took over his father's 
dry-cleaning business in 1935 and ran it until he retired in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The small shop at 122 Main St., now known as Diamond Lane clothing shop, is one 
of five downtown buildings owned by the Sarrabere family. Three are targeted 
for condemnation as part of the city's Main-Pier Redevelopment Project. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you can't stop progress," Sarrabere said. "And downtown is getting 
pretty old." 
</P>
<P>
Sarrabere's father used his profits to buy Huntington Beach real estate. Now 
his descendants -- Charles Sarrabere, his sister Blanche Wood and their niece, 
Helene Goodman -- own the buildings: two on Main Street and one at Pacific 
Coast Highway and 5th Street, site of the family's old home. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists are interested in the old dry-cleaning store. It not only is 
among the city's oldest remaining buildings, built about 1902, but it 
originally was City Hall for Pacific City, as Huntington Beach was known from 
1901 to 1905. 
</P>
<P>
"That building was one of the very first on Main Street," said Douglas 
Langevin, a downtown businessman and historic-preservation activist. "It's one 
of very few of the original wood structures left in the city. . . . In my view, 
that is the most important (of the old wooden buildings), given its history 
with the city." 
</P>
<P>
The face of the two-story building was remodeled decades ago, but the 
structure's walls are original, according to historical studies. 
</P>
<P>
Under the redevelopment plan, owners may retain their buildings during 
remodeling if they help pay for the upgrade in advance. Advance payments 
average $1 million per building, and the family says it has no interest in 
making such an investment. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, widow of former Huntington Beach City councilman Herbert Wood, said she 
discussed having the building registered as a historical landmark, which would 
block condemnation, "but I didn't really know what to do, so we just figured, 
well, whatever's best." 
</P>
<P>
Langevin said that as a last resort he may try to buy the building and restore 
it. But the family says it may sell the city all three properties and let 
redevelopment run its course. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sentimental thing," Sarrabere said. "It's part of my life, and I hate 
to part with it." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said: "I feel we should be paid for what the building 
will be worth four or five years from now. We're going to sell it (and) a 
developer will make all the money off it, and you're out." 
</P>
<P>
Wood added that after refusing to sell her father's properties for so many 
years, it pains her to do so now. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always stuck together and held onto them," she said. "I know this is a 
new era, and we have to move on. The thing is, it's not because we want to, but 
because we have to." JOHN PENNER

COUNCIL CONFRONTS ZONING CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HERZOG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council tonight is expected to hear the latest debate on a zoning plan 
for South Laguna, including a controversial proposal to preserve the Treasure 
Island Trailer Park. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Kenney, president of Treasure Island Resident's Assn., which fears the 
mobile-home park will be sacrificed to development, said he expects at least 
200 residents to attend the meeting in support of making mobile-home zoning 
permanent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be fireworks, that's for sure," he said. "Now we're talking 
about major leagues; the rest was just a rehearsal." 
</P>
<P>
The mobile-home ordinance will be just one of a dozen zoning changes 
recommended by the Planning Commission since annexation of South Laguna in 
1987. By state law, those changes must be adopted by Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants of Treasure Island Trailer Park and Laguna Terrace, the two existing 
mobile-home parks in South Laguna, have packed previous meetings to complain 
that they might lose their homes if the ordinance is not adopted. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-acre Treasure Island parcel overlooking the ocean was purchased in 
August by a partnership of Costa Mesa-based Richard A. Hall Co. and Merrill 
Lynch Hubbard of New York for $43 million. Residents say they offered the same 
amount to the previous owner, who rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
The new owners, Treasure Island Associates, originally offered residents a 
10-year lease that called for a 20% increase in lease payments the first year 
and 7% increases in subsequent years. Residents said such increases would force 
them out, clearing the way for a million-dollar homes development on the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
The owners later revised their proposal to 10% increases for the first five 
years and 7% increases thereafter, Kenney said. He labeled the lease 
negotiations a "farce" and said no agreement has been reached. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Hall said he will be present at the meeting to oppose the mobile-home 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not provide long-term protection for tenants, and it is not the most 
sensible use of the property," he said Monday. "It also prevents the city from 
getting five acres of beach in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Hall said he has been working for a year to reach an agreement with Treasure 
Island residents. 
</P>
<P>
If no agreement is reached, city officials may defer final action to the next 
meeting, scheduled for Dec. 12. LESLIE HERZOG

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: AIRPORT COMPLETION DELAY CONFIRMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County officials confirmed on Monday that John Wayne Airport's new, $50-million 
passenger terminal will not be completed until Sept. 15, five months behind 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
But the airport's top administrator defended the delay, saying that little 
could have been done to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
During a half-hour news conference at the county Hall of Administration in 
Santa Ana, Airport Manager George Rebella said he probably wouldn't do anything 
differently if he were given a second chance to shepherd the project forward. 
</P>
<P>
"While this is disappointing, it's not a disaster," Rebella said, suggesting 
that the construction problems with the terminal were akin to those any 
homeowner encounters with contractors during a home-remodeling project. 
</P>
<P>
Work at the airport has been delayed for a variety of reasons, among them 
incomplete architectural drawings, late orders for steel delivery and 
subcontractor payment disputes. 
</P>
<P>
When word of the delay was reported by local newspapers last week, aides for 
some county supervisors suggested that Rebella's job could be in jeopardy. 
Asked during Monday's news conference if he had interviewed for a post at the 
San Jose International Airport, Rebella declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Rebella said estimates that the postponement would cost the county $5.6 million 
in lost airline revenue were "highly speculative." Even if the predictions 
prove true, he said, the airport still would have more than $7.5 million in 
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
He said any change in the fees to be paid contractors will be up for discussion 
in coming weeks, then will go before the Board of Supervisors for review. ERIC

PROFESSOR PUSHES BID TO OPEN LENNON FILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for a UC Irvine history professor are scheduled to present arguments 
today before a federal appeals court as they seek to open FBI files on John 
Lennon. 
</P>
<P>
The case will test whether the FBI can cite national security as a reason for 
refusing to open its files on the slain rock musician, said Dan Marmalefsky, 
who is representing the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The appearance before the U.S. 9th Court of Appeals comes after a federal judge 
ruled in favor of the FBI in March, 1988, and refused to release deleted 
portions of the file on the one-time Beatle, who was shot to death by a 
disturbed fan in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
UCI history instructor Jon Wiener launched the lawsuit in 1983 as he sought FBI 
documents under the Freedom of Information Act for a biography of Lennon. 
Wiener could not be reached for comment on the latest twist in his lawsuit but 
said in a statement: 
</P>
<P>
"It's ridiculous to say that releasing the file would threaten national 
security. Lennon hoped to impact the reelection of (President Richard M.) 
Nixon, but that's not a crime. That's precisely the type of activity protected 
by the First Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
Wiener sought the files originally in 1981 as part of his research on his book 
"Come Together: John Lennon in His Time." 
</P>
<P>
He received about two-thirds of the FBI file on Lennon, which included 
transcriptions of Beatles songs, photocopies of album covers and music reviews. 
Some of the reports had been sent to top officials in the Nixon Administration 
and to late FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
But about 69 pages of the file were withheld by the agency, which cited several 
grounds including national security and "retaliation by a foreign power." CHRIS

JUDGE CLEARS STATE GOP COMMITTEE IN POLL INTIMIDATION SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge on Monday absolved the California Republican State Central 
Committee from any civil liability in the decision by local Republicans to 
place uniformed security guards at several polling places in the 72nd Assembly 
District on election day in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts said it would require "piling inference 
upon inference" to argue that the state committee should be held accountable 
for the actions of local Republicans when state party officials were not aware 
until afterward of what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
The judge granted the state committee's request that it be dropped from a 
lawsuit filed by six Latino voters who claim that poll guards at 20 Santa Ana 
precincts were an attempt to intimidate minority voters. Democrats blame the 
guards for Republican Curt Pringle's narrow victory in the state Assembly race 
against Christian (Rick) Thierbach. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle's election committee and the Orange County Republican Party Central 
Committee are the primary targets of the lawsuit, which is scheduled for trial 
in Judge Letts' courtroom Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans have said the security guards were hired because party 
officials feared Democrats would try to tip the election by busing in illegal 
voters. However, the incident sparked a barrage of criticism of local 
Republicans and the county's party chairman, Thomas A. Fuentes. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats have called for investigations by both the district attorney's office 
and the state attorney general. Both offices have declined to prosecute anyone 
connected with the incident. 
</P>
<P>
In federal court Monday, Joseph Remcho, lawyer for the six Latino plaintiffs, 
argued that the state Republican Party was involved in what happened in two 
ways: Local Republican leader Marsha Gilchrist was involved in the placing of 
the guards, and she is also on the State Central Committee's executive board. 
Remcho also argued that there is a "symbiotic" relationship between the state 
and county committees for the party. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have accountability somewhere," Remcho told the court. 
</P>
<P>
But the state committee's attorney, John Mueller, countered that the 58 county 
central committees within the party act as "satellites" that are independent of 
the state committee. 
</P>
<P>
While Letts appeared to play devil's advocate during presentations by both 
sides, he told lawyers for the plaintiffs: "You can't be legally liable for 
things you can't prevent." 
</P>
<P>
After the ruling, Mueller said: "We should never have been sued in the first 
place. After a year, the plaintiffs have yet to come up with any evidence that 
we were in any way involved." 
</P>
<P>
Another defendant, county voter registrar Donald Tanney, has settled rather 
than bear the expense of lengthy litigation. The county agreed to agreed to pay 
the plaintiffs $20,000 and to implement various changes in the training 
procedures for precinct workers aimed at preventing similar incidents.

PEOPLE: FOUNTAIN VALLEY 'TINKERER' IS READY FOR METHANOL EDICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"What if we woke up one day and the government said, 'You guys are going to 
have to use methanol in your cars,' " asked Charles Endicott, 62, who retired 
two years ago as a programmer for Smith Tool Co. in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Endicott posed the rhetorical question while talking about his 1967 Datsun 
Patrol, which he has converted to use methanol instead of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be in a helluva shape if that order came down and I hadn't changed over," 
he said. "Everyone else would have the same problem. It's a good thing I'm a 
tinkerer." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago Endicott wondered about the possibility of having to use a new 
fuel and changed to methanol after reading an article that the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District planned to require cars to burn cleaner fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Although he wants to help clean the air, "I just wanted to know how to use it. 
Ultimately we'll all be using an alternate fuel." 
</P>
<P>
The Fountain Valley retiree said there are several drawbacks to converting to 
methanol, which is 85% alcohol and 15% gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
He notes that there are only 21 stations throughout California -- 10 in Orange 
County -- that sell methanol, charging about 71 cents a gallon. And anyone 
converting to methanol has to register with the California Energy Commission's 
methanol program. It took Endicott two months to get the paper work processed. 
</P>
<P>
Endicott, a machinist most of his life, said methanol shows promise of being a 
cleaner fuel, but there are problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed quite a drop in power and my car's not very strong getting away from 
stop signs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And worse, "on cold mornings I have a problem starting the car." 
</P>
<P>
But Endicott doesn't have a problem on the freeways. "I can keep up with the 
traffic at the maximum speed limit and maybe even more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the time he spent changing the car to a new fuel system, he hasn't 
invested much money in the conversion. 
</P>
<P>
His first expense was $1.35 for a high school chemistry book he bought in a 
secondhand shop to learn something about the fuel. He even talked to race car 
drivers at Ascot Park in Gardena, where many of them use methanol in their 
racers. 
</P>
<P>
He plunked down $2 for some copper tubing, and modified a fuel pump and some 
used carburetors until he got it right. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure I have $50 invested overall," said Endicott, who doesn't expect 
accolades for his work. "I feel I'm helping the environment with the change, 
but I don't want anything from it." 
</P>
<P>
If anything, it has been a pastime. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to see how it would work," he said. "I have fun with it." When 
he isn't tinkering with the car, Endicott is out fishing or inventing things 
such as a brake he installed on his fishing reel. 
</P>
<P>
Endicott, who said he "feels pretty satisfied with myself" since he retired, is 
hedging his bet with methanol. 
</P>
<P>
He has a 1967 Ford Mustang that uses gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
During two-hour sessions over three nights recently, 50 parents became students 
at Hewes Middle School in Santa Ana to find out what their children are 
studying in math, science and English. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents were interested in learning more about these three areas of concern . 
. . because a lot has changed since they were kids," said science teacher Steve 
Goldzman. 
</P>
<P>
The topics and teachers were: "Literature Through Language Arts," Sheralin 
Conkey; "Math in the Hand is Math in the Brain," Diane Mazurie, and "Hands-On 
Science," Goldzman. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers volunteer their time. 
</P>
<P>
The sophomore football team at Mater Dei High in Santa Ana clearly is a team of 
the future for the school. 
</P>
<P>
Coached by John O'Shea, Chuck Ardolino, Mike Beene and Joe McCann, the 
51-member unit recorded a 10-0 season, scoring 307 points while allowing only 
77. 
</P>
<P>
The defense held opponents scoreless in three games, and allowed only one

The highlight of the season was the team's 18-12 win over Huntington Beach 
Edison High's squad, which snapped Edison's 33-game winning streak.

TRIBE SEEKS WOMAN'S ARREST IN CUSTODY FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: ALEUTS REQUEST THE RETURN OF A CYPRESS TEEN'S BABY GIVEN UP FOR 
ADOPTION IN CANADA.

Alaska's Aleut Indian tribe has asked a judge to order the arrest of an Aleut 
woman from Cypress if she refuses to let a tribal family raise her baby. 
</P>
<P>
In court documents made public Monday the Akhiok Tribal Council asks Orange 
County Superior Court Judge Robert J. Polis to declare that Jodi Argleben 18, 
violated the law when she fled the country with 5-month-old Rebecca and gave 
the infant to a Canadian couple for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
Contending that Rebecca is "clearly at substantial risk of suffering serious 
emotional damage," the tribal council asked Polis to order Argleben to return 
the baby to Orange County so the infant's future can be decided. 
</P>
<P>
The Akhiok Tribal Council, which governs the Aleut community in a small town on 
Kodiak Island, contends that a 1978 law gives it the right to see that 
Argleben's daughter is placed with an Aleut family if Argleben chooses to give 
the child up for adoption. The law was designed to preserve Indian families and 
customs. 
</P>
<P>
Argleben, who was raised by a non-Indian family, has resisted the tribe's 
effort, arguing that she should have the right to decide who will adopt her 
child. She gave the baby to a couple in Vancouver, British Columbia, and went 
into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
In a petition filed Friday, the Akhiok Tribal Council asked Polis to order 
Argleben to reveal the baby's whereabouts, and to revoke her consent to any 
adoption that infringes on the tribe's rights to the child. The tribe asked 
Polis to order Argleben's arrest if she refuses. 
</P>
<P>
Argleben's adoptive mother, Judy Argleben, said in an interview that the family 
believes the adoption is "completely legal" based on the advice of several 
lawyers, whom she would not name. Her daughter did not receive money for the 
baby, even to cover travel expenses, Mrs. Argleben said. 
</P>
<P>
Jodi Argleben is preparing documents to explain her actions to courts in 
Canada, where the baby's adoption is pending, and in Orange County, her mother 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Argleben said the Canadian couple heard about her daughter's custody 
battle and had an intermediary call her to express interest in adopting the 
baby. The two Argleben women talked with the couple by telephone and then 
traveled to Canada in late September to meet them, Mrs. Argleben said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a wonderful couple," she said. "As soon as they saw the baby they were 
emotional about it. They fell in love with her. They couldn't wait to hold her 
and they cuddled her. That's what really turned Jodi on: She wanted someone 
who'd love the baby right away." 
</P>
<P>
It was tough for her daughter to sign the adoption papers, Mrs. Argleben said. 
"Everyone was crying," she said of the scene in a Canadian lawyer's office. 
"(The couple) sympathized with her, and yet they were very happy to have the 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
"Jodi looks on it as a gift of love. It's not that she didn't want to keep and 
raise her baby, but she knew she wasn't ready to be the kind of mother she 
needed to be." 
</P>
<P>
At the Canadian couple's suggestion, Jodi wrote a letter to Rebecca and 
enclosed a picture of herself so her daughter would know who her mother was, 
Argleben said. The couple promised to give them to Rebecca when she grows up.

MISSION VIEJO APPEALS PLAYOFF LOSS TO EL TORO

Mission Viejo High School filed an appeal Monday to Southern Section 
administrators protesting last week's overtime loss to El Toro in the Division 
III football playoffs, according to Robert Metz, Mission Viejo principal. 
</P>
<P>
A member of Mission Viejo's athletic department said the appeal was based on an 
alleged viewing by several El Toro players of Mission Viejo game films at an 
assistant coach's home on Sunday, Nov. 26. The meeting allegedly took place six 
days before Mission Viejo played El Toro in the Division III semifinals last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But a member of El Toro's athletic department said only one player, who is a 
starter, was involved, and he was viewing the Chargers' 28-14 victory over 
Villa Park in the Nov. 24 quarterfinals for the purposes of compiling his 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The assistant coach, Bob Bosanko, was not present when the player or players 
viewed the film at his home but planned the gathering, sources said. The 
Southern Section is expected to announce today whether El Toro violated Rule 
1412 of the Constitution of the California Interscholastic Federation regarding 
Sunday restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The rule states: "A school may not play a football game or conduct a scrimmage 
or football practice of any type on Sunday." An explanation of the ruling also 
states that meeting on Sunday "for a skull session or reviewing a game film" is 
not permitted. 
</P>
<P>
Don Martin, El Toro principal, refused to comment. Bob Johnson, El Toro coach, 
said he had been instructed by Martin not to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo coaches, who also declined comment, allegedly learned of the 
viewing of the film at Bosanko's home a day before their 28-21 loss to El Toro, 
then later began questioning whether El Toro had an unfair advantage in 
preparing for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Among the questions that Southern Section officials are reviewing was the 
intent of the film viewing and the possibility of any sanctions. The 
constitution does not specify any penalty for a rule violation. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Thomas, Southern Section commissioner, was attending a meeting in Los 
Angeles and was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro defeated Mission Viejo, 28-21, in overtime, to qualify for its third 
Southern Section championship game in the past four years. El Toro is scheduled 
to meet defending champion Paramount on Saturday night at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Sutch, Paramount coach, said he was not informed of any violations by an El 
Toro coach or player, and that he had not been told of any possible sanctions 
against the school by Southern Section officials. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first I've heard about this," Sutch said Monday night. "We've 
spent three 10-hour days preparing for El Toro. We gave our players the game 
plan this afternoon at lunch and had a walk-through today. 
</P>
<P>
"We exchanged films with El Toro and expect to play them on Saturday night. 
Anything else would be a complete surprise to me."

GROUND GAME IS BROKEN, BUT WHY REPAIR IT? 
</P>

"Nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide." It's been the Rams' theme song this 
season in a startling football role reversal in which a former league rushing 
power has been rendered practically helpless on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas, ranked 24th against the run before Sunday's 35-31 loss to the Rams, 
should move up in the rankings after holding Los Angeles to 78 yards on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, though, the Rams keep escaping, thanks to a few nervous-breakdown 
finishes and the gifted arm of quarterback Jim Everett. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Coach John Robinson knew the pendulum was swinging from run to pass with 
the arrival of Everett and the departure of Eric Dickerson, but he never 
imagined losing the run as a major weapon altogether. 
</P>
<P>
But the Rams have been held to fewer than 100 yards rushing in seven of 13 
games. And tailback Greg Bell, who started the season so brilliantly with 512 
yards and a 5.12 average through the first five games, has been held to 315 and 
a 2.16 average in the last eight. 
</P>
<P>
So it's Bell's fault, right? 
</P>
<P>
No, Robinson said, and he's not considering a tailback switch at the moment, 
even with two first-round picks -- Gaston Green and Cleveland Gary -- riding 
the pine. 
</P>
<P>
"To say you're not running the ball because your runners aren't running isn't 
accurate," Robinson said. "In the group they're failing -- I'm in the group -- 
we're all failing in this area. But I think it's ridiculous to say, 'I confess, 
the runner did it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The problems are numerous and complicated, but are no doubt related to the 
overwhelming success of Everett and the Ram passing attack. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing so often in the second half, and with their quarterback bombing away, 
the Rams haven't had the time to run. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, the starter, hasn't had more than 20 carries since mid-October. He has 
carried 15, 11, 11 and 14 in his last four starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the problem is with the whole thing," Robinson said. "Like anything, 
when that happens you become vulnerable. I think (Bell is) frustrated, and I 
think we're frustrated. I think he can get back in stride, if we get our rhythm 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the Rams are running on two left feet and a passing attack that's 
driving the league crazy. The Rams seem to feel now that they need to pass to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"Your personality begins to change, no question," Robinson said. "The problems 
are real when you're strong in one area." 
</P>
<P>
Problems? What problems? The Rams are 9-4 and still in the playoff hunt. And 
that's the problem. The lack of a running attack is perplexing Robinson, but 
he's not sure what to do. As long as his team keeps winning, who cares? 
</P>
<P>
Opponents insist on rolling out game plans designed to stop the run, not Jim 
Everett, "which I find astounding," Robinson said. "We're getting to the point 
where we're saying, 'OK, we're just going to throw it. If you show it to us, 
we'll throw.' " 
</P>
<P>
Robinson just hopes all those people who have called him inflexible all these 
years are watching now. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you have to be what you are," he said. "I think a lot of you at times 
have been surprised that I have not gone back into a tight T (formation) and 
put on my Ohio State hat and become Woody (Hayes), my patron saint. 
</P>
<P>
"My philosophy is not that. My philosophy is to use what you have. It always 
has been, and I've never varied from it. I find myself personally frustrated in 
that one area, but I like the fact we're scoring and doing well." 
</P>
<P>
Miracles aside, this is how good Everett has been in the clutch this season: 
</P>
<P>
He has led his team on five fourth-quarter comebacks -- against San Francisco, 
Buffalo, Minnesota, New Orleans and Dallas -- giving the Rams the lead each 
time in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
In those five fourth quarters, plus the overtime period against New Orleans, 
Everett has completed 66% of his passes for 748 yards with five touchdowns and 
two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how legends are made, right?" Robinson wondered. 
</P>
<P>
More bad news on the defensive front: Mike Piel's dislocated left elbow will 
sideline him for at least the rest of the regular season, the Rams are saying, 
but the news on Doug Reed's ankle sprain is even worse. Most were expecting him 
back for the 49ers, but now there's a chance he won't be back at all. 
</P>
<P>
"There's some question as to whether Doug Reed will come back this season," 
Robinson said. "He's got an ankle injury that's still quite sore, a rather 
severe strain." 
</P>
<P>
Reed was hurt against Phoenix on Nov. 19, and the injuries to the Rams' 
starting defensive ends leave the team with three down linemen, Shawn Miller, 
Alvin Wright and rookie Bill Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
"We have Miller, Wright and Hawkins," Robinson said. "And their backups are 
Miller, Wright and Hawkins." 
</P>
<P>
The chance of signing another lineman at this point are slim, so the team is 
contemplating two options: playing more Eagle defense, which requires only two 
down linemen, or activating second-round linebacker Brian Smith from injured 
reserve and moving him to defensive end, the position the Rams are projecting 
for him if he can ever add enough weight to his 6-foot-6 frame, which carries 
242 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
It's definitely a new era in San Francisco when it comes to injuries. Coach 
George Seifert has announced already that 49er quarterback Joe Montana is 
probable for Monday night's game despite his tender ribs. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bill Walsh, the 49ers liked to keep the Rams guessing. 
</P>
<P>
"If Bill was coaching, we might have him listed as near death," said Robinson, 
who expects to Montana to play. "Those kinds of guys play in these kinds of 
games." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
If the playoffs started today, the Rams would play host to the New York Giants 
in the wild-card game. . . . Henry Ellard (hamstring) and Cliff Hicks (strained 
knee) are both expected back this week, although Robinson said veteran LeRoy 
Irvin would start at right cornerback ahead of Hicks for the time being. "I'm 
just filling in," the pessimist Irvin concluded. Hicks was still confined to a 
knee-brace in his Monday workout. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson was calling his team's performance on special teams 
"abysmal" and "atrocious," for allowing the Dallas Cowboys a 26-yard average on 
six kickoff returns in Sunday's win. Returner Ron Brown also fumbled a kick at 
his own two-yard line, which led to a Dallas touchdown. Robinson, amazingly, 
isn't anticipating any personnel changes. "If I don't murder some of them, the 
ones that survive will continue to play," he said. "It's not going to be a 
happy place today." 
</P>
<P>
THE RAMS BY THE NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
HIGHLIGHT 
</P>
<P>
JIM EVERETT 
</P>
<P>
As the National Football League's best quarterback, Joe Montana has become 
legendary for his fourth-quarter heroics. Give him the ball with his team 
trailing by less than a touchdown with two minutes to play, and you can bank on 
the San Francisco 49ers winning. But, the newest rival to Montana's reputation 
is the Rams' Jim Everett. For the second consecutive week, the fourth-year pro 
brought the Rams back from apparent certain defeat, this time behind by 10, 
31-21, to the Dallas Cowboys with 4:20 to play. He hooked up with Ron Brown (39 
yards) and Aaron Cox (23) for touchdown pass plays and the Rams' ninth victory 
was assured.

<P>
Deana Shively was forced to shoulder extra responsibility in Saturday's 
Division II state volleyball championship match when La Habra High School 
teammate Missy Clements dislocated her knee in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
Shively, an outside hitter and The Times' Athlete of the Week, led her team 
with 18 kills as the Highlanders (21-1) defeated Moraga Campolindo, 9-15, 
15-10, 4-15, 15-5, 15-7, for their first state volleyball title. 
</P>
<P>
"She was great," La Habra Coach Sandy Blumenthal. "She had to take charge when 
Missy was injured, and she kept pulling the team together, convincing them not 
to give up, besides picking up the slack." 
</P>
<P>
Said Shively: "It's my senior year and I knew we had to do it. It was my last 
game, no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
Shively was named to the all-tournament team and earned all-Freeway League 
honors for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Shively said she was happy about the state title -- though the Highlanders had 
been league champions seven times in the 1980s, they had never won the Southern 
Section 3-A title -- but now she has other things on her mind. 
</P>
<P>
Soccer practice began a month ago and her first game is today. 
</P>
<P>
Shively plays left wing on the soccer team and is a long jumper on the track 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"I've already missed a (soccer) game," Shively said. "Practice started as soon 
as volleyball ended league, but I haven't been able to be there because we went 
on (to the playoffs). 
</P>
<P>
"I'm supposed to play in the game (today). I should really be able to walk 
Wednesday," she said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Shively said she would like to play volleyball in college. 
</P>
<P>
"Volleyball comes easiest to me," she said. "I just love the game. But I wish I 
was taller. I don't think I'll grow much more, so I haven't really looked at 
any four-year schools." 
</P>
<P>
She said she might attend a community college and transfer to a university. 
"I'm not really sure what I'm going to do, but I know I better do it soon," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Shively has a soccer game to play. 
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Almanza and Ana Kristich of La Habra, both juniors, were named to the

UC Irvine will be without its top two point guards -- senior starter Rod Palmer 
and freshman reserve Ben Rishwain -- when it plays at California Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer suffered a sprained right knee trying to draw an offensive foul and 
Rishwain broke the index finger on his left (shooting) hand during the first 
half of the Anteaters' 74-72 loss to Tennessee Chattanooga Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, who averages 13 points and four assists for the Anteaters (1-3), had 
X-rays taken Sunday and underwent a Magnetic Resonance Imaging examination 
Monday, which showed no cartilage damage. He is expected to be out two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Rishwain, a walk-on from Stockton, underwent surgery on Sunday and could be out 
three to four weeks. He has been a steady backup, averaging about 10 minutes a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Dylan Rigdon, a freshman who was a shooting guard at Mater Dei High School last 
season, will start in place of Palmer at California, Coach Bill Mulligan said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Marshall, a freshman who was a swingman at Saddleback High, will be 
Rigdon's backup. 
</P>
<P>
Rigdon played 21 minutes against Tennessee Chattanooga, getting two points and 
three rebounds. Marshall had five points and two rebounds in a season-high nine 
minutes.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: GOLDEN WEST BUILDS CONFIDENCE UP NORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Golden West College women's basketball team is off to an impressive start, 
but that has happened before. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West was the top-ranked team for most of the 1986-87 and 1987-88 
seasons, but didn't win a state title either time, being eliminated in the 
semifinals each year. Golden West was ranked in the top five last season, but 
lost in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But this past weekend, Golden West (10-0) took what co-coaches Dick and Dave 
Stricklin hope is a big step toward doing better in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Rustlers won the four-day, 16-team Visalia tournament at College of the 
Sequoias, site of the state tournament, which will be played the first weekend 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's final, Golden West defeated Sequoias, 63-54. It was the first loss 
for Sequoias (9-1), traditionally one of the stronger teams from Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Stricklins -- Dick and his son, Dave -- know their team has a 
long way to go to make it back to the state tournament, but a little success on 
the floor before then won't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good deal for us to do well there," Dave said. "Several of the top 
teams were there and it helps to build our confidence in that gym against 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Golden West was led by sophomore forward Claudette Jackson, who scored 20 
points in the final game and was voted the most valuable player of the 
tournament. Jackson leads Golden West with 16.6 points and 11.5 rebounds a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West is averaging 93.7 points a game thanks largely to the fast break. 
Golden West is giving up only 63.4 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Men's basketball: Rancho Santiago and Cypress have had impressive starts this 
season. During the weekend, the Dons (10-0) won their Tip-Off tournament and 
the Grossmont tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress (6-O) has won its own tournament and will take part in the Golden West 
tournament, which begins Wednesday with Cypress playing Glendale at 6 p.m. and 
Cerritos playing Riverside at 8 p.m. On Thursday, Antelope Valley plays San 
Diego Mesa at 6 p.m. and Golden West plays Citrus at 8 p.m. Friday's semifinals 
will be played at 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., and the championship game will be held 
Saturday at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Wrestling: Cypress qualified seven wrestlers, Rancho Santiago six, and Golden 
West four for the Southern California regional tournaments this past weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The top three finishers in each weight division advance to the finals, which 
will be Friday and Saturday at Fresno College. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Lopez of Cypress and Eric LeGarreta of Golden West head the list, both 
winning at 118 pounds in different regionals. The two are the favorites for the 
state title. LeGarreta holds the edge, having defeated Lopez twice. 
</P>
<P>
Also qualifying for Cypress: Greg Monteith (167), Ken Stegall (190), Brian 
Bertrand (126), Doug Haring (142), Mike Robles (177) and heavyweight Trevor 
Hargrave. 
</P>
<P>
Qualifying for Rancho Santiago: Marc Aguirre (177), Rusty Espinoza (142), Pat 
Kinney (126), Jeff Combs (143), Ryan Owings (158) and heavyweight Chris 
Yagelener. 
</P>
<P>
For Golden West: LeGarreta, Chris Shaul (167), Phil Meyer (190) and Russell 
Corbin (177). 
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Since this was the first year women played for a state soccer title, it's also 
the first time a college has won both men's and women's titles. The Orange 
Coast women's team defeated Cosumnes River of Sacramento, 1-0, Saturday at El 
Camino. It was the 100th victory for the eight-year program and Coach Barbara 
Bond. Orange Coast is 100-30-12 under Bond. The men's team defeated Fresno 
City, 3-2, Saturday at El Camino.

APPAREL: FREQUENT FASHION CHANGES AND SHARP PRICING HAVE MADE WEEKEND EXERCISE 
CO. A LEADER IN ITS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE SPECIALTY CLOTHING FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boosted by a licensing arrangement with ballet superstar Mikhail Baryshnikov, a 
San Diego apparel concern called Weekend Exercise Co. has quietly become the 
nation's leading specialty manufacturer of women's dance, aerobic and exercise 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
The company is growing at a 20% annual rate despite a recent leveling off in 
the market after a decade-long boom corresponding to the emergence of aerobics 
and fitness as a national preoccupation. The aerobics and exercise fad gave 
rise to a whole new genre of comfortable, form-fitting and stylish apparel 
that, for lack of a better term, has come to be known in the trade as "active 
wear." 
</P>
<P>
Sales of the Weekend's Marika, Baryshnikov and Jazzercise lines should exceed 
$50 million this year, or about 38% of the estimated $130-million women's 
active wear market as a whole, President Arthur Levinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Levinson, 63, is a longtime San Diegan who co-founded Weekend in 1982 with 
retailer Ed Berner and Norm Zwail, who formerly was Danskin's sales 
representative for Southern California. Weekend Exercise now has 150 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Weekend Exercise made its initial splash in 1983 with the introduction of the 
Marika line at prices 20% to 30% under competing lines. Weekend accomplished 
the price reductions by becoming the first active-wear company to move its 
manufacturing offshore, specifically to low-cost plants in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
The success of the line caught the notice of international star Mikhail 
Baryshnikov, who in 1986 went to the company and proposed a cooperative 
agreement to introduce a higher-priced Baryshnikov signature line of dance and 
exercise wear. Baryshnikov chose Weekend after querying retailers and dancers 
as to who the quality clothing makers were. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, Baryshnikov and Weekend signed a licensing deal calling for 
Weekend to manufacture clothes bearing Baryshnikov's name. Three years later, 
the Baryshnikov line is doing $15 million in sales and accounting for 30% of 
Weekend's revenue. Sales of the Baryshnikov line have grown at a 30% to 40% 
clip per year since introduction. 
</P>
<P>
Baryshnikov has final say over design of the line and visits Weekend's Spruce 
Street office two to four times a year to review new products, Levinson said. 
Baryshnikov was performing in Belgium this week and unavailable for comment, 
but Debra Joester of Hamilton Projects, Baryshnikov's New York-based licensing 
agent, said the "timing and chemistry of the agreement have been perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Baryshnikov is "delighted with the product and very pleased with the sales," 
Joester said, noting that the line has expanded from the classic ballet styles 
originally envisioned by Baryshnikov to include more casual dancing apparel. 
Capitalizing on the clothes' crossover appeal as casual attire, Weekend and 
Baryshnikov are in the process of introducing a new line of street wear. 
</P>
<P>
The Weekend-Baryshnikov team's "timing was right for their type of product 
because body wear and leg wear have expanded beyond the old notions of dance 
wear," said Karen Monget, a news editor at Women's Wear Daily. "There are so 
many crossover trends. A lot more people are wearing body-wear pieces as outer 
wear these days." 
</P>
<P>
Weekend's Marika has steadily grown in popularity to the point that it is the 
largest-selling mid- to upper-priced trademark in women's exercise wear in the 
nation. It is sold in specialty dance and exercise clothing shops as well as in 
department store chains including the Broadway, Emporium-Capwell, 
Bloomingdale's, Macy's and sporting goods chains including Oshman's and 
Sportmart. 
</P>
<P>
"They forced a lot of other body-wear manufactures that had long enjoyed 
dominant positions to scramble and drop their prices as well," said Sally Goll, 
executive editor of Sportswear International, a New York-based fashion trade 
publication that focuses on the casual sportswear market. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike a lot of moderately priced lines that are moderately designed as well, 
they combine fashion with a very sharp price point," Goll said, a reference to 
Weekend's "very close to the bone" prices. 
</P>
<P>
Levinson was wrapping up a 30-year career as an apparel and sundry importer in 
1982 and considering retirement when old friend Ed Berner, founder of Fashion 
Conspiracy retail chain, approached him about forming a "low-key business" 
together. 
</P>
<P>
One possible venture, above several other ideas, struck them as particularly 
promising. "We became aware of the growth in the aerobics wear industry, that 
the goods were primarily being made in Southern California and that the people 
involved did not have real heavy business backgrounds," Levinson said. 
</P>
<P>
All three factors combined to spell a business opportunity for Levinson, who 
had spent much of his career learning the ins and outs of offshore 
manufacturing in Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea. If aerobics wear was being 
made stateside, Levinson knew he could produce similar clothing at 
substantially lower cost offshore. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Weekend Exercise was born with the prime objectives being to have fun and 
not work too hard, Levinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Levinson and Berner ran their aerobics wear idea past Norm Zwail, then a 
frustrated regional sales representative for Danskin, which at the time was a 
dominant dance wear manufacturer but losing market share. Zwail, who knew the 
Southern California exercise wear market as well as anyone, thought Weekend's 
idea was sound and joined the company as a co-founder. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a heavy-duty pay cut," Zwail said Wednesday. "I went backwards to go 
forward, and the gamble paid off." 
</P>
<P>
To project a fashion-conscious image, Weekend also committed itself at the 
outset to offer up to five new fashion looks per year, more than the two or 
three new looks then being offered by active-wear manufacturers. (Weekend now 
introduces new fashions almost monthly.) 
</P>
<P>
The result has been that Weekend's Marika line has been able to respond much 
more quickly than most competitors to changes in styles, according to Bill 
Schaaf, senior vice president and general merchandise manager at 
Emporium-Capwell department stores in the San Francisco Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
"The physical fitness market is constantly looking for new things," Schaaf 
said. "They are fashion-conscious people," he said of aerobics clothing buyers. 
Weekend "can deliver it very fast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sales started slowly but gathered momentum as the Marika line demonstrated 
quality as well as price advantage, Levinson said. The company weathered a 
potential crisis in 1984 when Jane Fonda's signature line of women's athletic 
wear was introduced, casting doubt on whether Fonda would leave "room for a 
schleppy little company like ours." But the Fonda line soon faltered, and 
Weekend survived to prosper. 
</P>
<P>
Berner sold his interest last year as part of a recapitalization of the 
company, and new investors include prominent San Diegans whom Levinson declined 
to identify. One investor he did name was Thomas Volpe, a San Francisco 
investment banker who formerly was a top-level executive at Hambrecht &amp; 
Quist investment bankers, well-known for helping start up many Silicon Valley 
high technology companies. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Volpe said he invested in Weekend because of his belief in 
Levinson's integrity and because the "company never seems to stand still. They 
are always thinking of new things to do, and that's why they have grown as well 
as they have." 
</P>
<P>
Levinson said a public stock offering is definitely a possibility eventually 
but is not in the company's immediate plans.

The retail stores of Atlanta Doors and Windows were locked Monday as the 
apparently financially troubled Orange County door and window manufacturing 
company prepared to seek the protection of U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
Ira Katz, lawyer for the San Juan Capistrano-based firm that has retail outlets 
in Orange and Laguna Hills, said the company planned today to file for 
protection from its creditors and reorganize operations under Chapter 11 of the 
Federal Bankruptcy Code.

<P>
"It is the intention of the company to continue operating and do the best it 
can within the limits of the bankruptcy law for its creditors," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Katz declined to give any more information about the company or its financial 
condition. County records show that the firm, which makes fashionable French 
doors and other expensive doors, has been doing business as Atlanta Doors and 
Windows since Feb. 1, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Among its founders was Keith Powell, a Laguna Hills resident who was formerly 
president of the Los Angeles-based Federated Group, the struggling home 
consumer electronics chain bought by Atari Corp in 1987 for $67 million. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Powell said Monday that her husband Keith is a financial partner in the 
door and window business. "We are definitely not going out of business," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Edward Allen, president of the company, declined comment when reached at 
his El Toro home. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, customers of the company were distressed to find Monday that phones 
were disconnected or unanswered at various business locations of Atlanta Doors 
and no representative of the firm was around to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a customer, and they have about $3,200 of my money as a deposit for doors 
and windows," said Phil Bonesteele, a computer programmer for a software 
company in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Bonesteele said he was told that new windows would be installed at his Tustin 
home at 9 a.m. Monday morning. When no one arrived, he tried in vain to call 
the company. Bonesteele said he and his wife got worried and drove to the store 
in Laguna Hills, only to find that the door was locked and a sign said it was 
closed for inventory. Moreover, he said, there were six other anxious customers 
standing at the door. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the company just vaporized overnight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the stores in Laguna Hills and Orange, the company had another outlet 
in the Mission Viejo Mall that it closed about six months ago, a mall spokesman 
said.

JUDGE ALLOWS MEDICAL TESTIMONY IN FRAUD TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge on Monday ruled that Janet Faye McKinzie can call medical 
experts in her criminal trial to support her contention that the late owner of 
North America Savings &amp; Loan plied her with drugs to help him manipulate a 
massive fraud on the Santa Ana thrift. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler said McKinzie can try to prove 
that her mental capacity in regard to racketeering, conspiracy and other crimes 
was diminished by constant drug use. 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie is preparing to defend herself in a criminal trial scheduled to start 
Jan. 9 in what federal prosecutors once called the worst case of insider fraud 
in the history of the state's thrift industry. She also faces charges, at a 
later criminal trial, of bank fraud and making false statements. 
</P>
<P>
She and five others were indicted in April on 40 counts of racketeering, 
conspiracy, bank fraud, wire fraud, making false statements and transporting 
stolen funds across state lines. 
</P>
<P>
McKinzie, 40, was the confidante, business manager and fiancee of Duayne D. 
Christensen, 57, a Westminster dentist who opened North America Savings in 
1983. She also is the sole beneficiary of his will, trust and record 
$10-million life insurance policy, though the proceeds of the policy are being 
held in a court-ordered escrow account. 
</P>
<P>
State regulators seized the S&amp;L in January, 1987, only hours after 
Christensen died in a single-car crash on the Corona del Mar Freeway. They 
closed the thrift in June, 1988, paying $210 million in insured deposits to 
account holders. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators immediately began uncovering bogus deposit accounts, falsified 
records and forged signatures in the S&amp;L's files. They filed a civil 
lawsuit against McKinzie, Christensen's estate and others, seeking $40 million. 
The criminal case accuses the defendants of siphoning more than $16 million 
from the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
In Monday's pretrial hearing, Richard (Racehorse) Haynes of Houston, McKinzie's 
lead defense attorney, said Christensen gave his client a wide variety of drugs 
almost daily and even had a cook sprinkle drugs on McKinzie's food. The dentist 
turned a vibrant 115-pound woman into an emaciated 89-pound hospital patient, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
While Judge Stotler ruled that Haynes can present much of the medical evidence 
in the trial, she did prohibit him from presenting evidence that McKinzie was, 
in essence, a battered woman who was manipulated by Christensen with drugs to 
commit fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Haynes, a nationally known lawyer, has a reputation for raising every possible 
issue and every bit of evidence he can at trials. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Wieben Stock, the assistant U.S. attorney prosecuting the case, had 
argued that the medical evidence Haynes wants to bring to trial would prove 
"confusing and potentially distracting" to jurors. She called the prospective 
evidence "soap opera-type" information that would turn the trial into an 
"incredible circus." 
</P>
<P>
Haynes disputed her characterizations of the evidence and the trial, and 
Stotler decided McKinzie had a right to put on her defense.

MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO FRAUD PLOT WITH EX-TUSTIN BANKER

A man with alleged ties to organized crime pleaded guilty in U.S. District 
Court here Monday to one count of wire fraud in connection with a scheme with a 
former Tustin banker and another man to fraudulently obtain credit lines at 
five Las Vegas casinos. 
</P>
<P>
Morton Goodman, 53, faces five years in prison and a $1-million fine after 
negotiating a plea agreement in which two other wire-fraud charges and a 
conspiracy charge will be dropped. Sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 13. 
</P>
<P>
The former president of Far Western Bank in Tustin, Roger McGinnis, pleaded 
guilty last month to one count of conspiracy in connection with the case, and 
will be sentenced Jan. 18. A third man, John DeMattia, has also pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said that in 1984 McGinnis provided casinos with false financial 
information indicating that Goodman and DeMattia had large bank balances, thus 
enabling the two men to obtain substantial credit lines. 
</P>
<P>
The casinos allegedly defrauded in the scheme were Binion's Horseshoe, the Las 
Vegas Hilton, the MGM Grand and the Desert Inn and Country Club.

'TIS SEASON FOR THIEVES TO SMASH CAR WINDOWS AS GLASS SHOPS THRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the holiday shopping season, leave Christmas gifts unattended in the 
back seat of your car, and, Pete Newberger says, you're bound to receive at 
least two unexpected visitors. 
</P>
<P>
"A thief and me," says Newberger, district manager for five U.S. Auto Glass 
Centers in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
During the Christmas months, thieves and vandals are out in force "busting 
windows, nabbing Christmas gifts, clothing and purses" left inside cars, 
Newberger said. The result: repair work on auto windows "just skyrockets" for 
Newberger and the dozens of other San Diego auto-glass shops. 
</P>
<P>
Work on side and back windows -- thieves' main points of entry -- accounts for 
more than 60% of the 150 repairs conducted daily by U.S. Auto Glass' five 
county service centers during the holiday shopping season, Newberger said. This 
time of year, his fleet of 20 radio-dispatched service trucks is kept busy 
answering the distressed calls of windowless car owners throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
But the holiday season isn't the only time of the year that proves lucrative. 
An escalating crime rate has fed repair shops' growth year-round. Moreover, the 
rising number of vehicles traveling San Diego's roads as a result of the 
county's booming population have resulted in more accidents and stone-chipped 
windows and thus more business for auto-glass shops. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego has about 100 auto-glass repair shops, but Newberger says there is 
plenty of business to keep nearly everybody happy. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Newberger says, the combined revenue of San Diego's five U.S. Auto 
Glass service centers has grown at a compounded annual rate of 20% over the 
last two years and should exceed $4 million in 1989. In addition to the San 
Diego service centers, U.S. Auto Glass, a subsidiary of closely held, 
Chicago-based Globe Glass and Mirror Comp., operates 12 other Southern 
California outlets. 
</P>
<P>
"The No. 1 reason for our growth is more people moving into the county, which 
means there are more vehicles out on the road," Newberger said. "That means 
more accidents, more stone bruises." 
</P>
<P>
Besides replacing shattered windows, most service centers repair "stone 
bruises," which occur when flying debris, including pebbles kicked up by 
trucks, strike the windshield. Stone bruises are repaired by filling the crack 
with a polymer, which makes the window "structurally as good as new," Newberger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "And, where ever you see population growth, vandalism is going to 
follow suit. The bigger the city, the higher the crime rate." 
</P>
<P>
Crime statistics compiled by the San Diego Police Department supports 
Newberger's claim. 
</P>
<P>
Although such statistics do not specifically track the number of car windows 
broken by thieves or vandals, police records do monitor the number of "car 
prowls" -- which include any type of theft from a vehicle, either through 
forced (breaking windows or locks) or unforced entry (unlocked door). Car 
prowls also include theft of car batteries and tires, said Donna Guevara, a 
spokeswoman for the department's crime analysis unit. 
</P>
<P>
From January to November of this year, more than 27,475 car prowls were 
recorded by San Diego police, up 10% from 24,925 posted during the same period 
last year. "With the number of car prowls increasing each year, it's reasonable 
to assume that window break-ins are increasing as well," Guevara said. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies have noticed the trend as well. 
</P>
<P>
Theresa Bedoy, an Allstate Insurance spokeswoman, says that in recent years her 
company has received an increasing number of glass claims from various causes, 
including accidents, theft and vandalism for the Southern California region. 
Through the first 10 months of the year, Allstate alone has processed 9,345 
glass claims for its Southern California policy holders. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's not including November and December, which are typically our high 
months," Bedoy said. "Our claims people say there is a definite increase in 
those months because of an increase in windshield damage due to sand storms and 
vandals striking during the holiday season." 
</P>
<P>
Paying for new windows during the holiday shopping season could mean fewer 
presents under the Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
The following suggested list prices were published in the National Auto Glass 
Specifications (NAGS), a list that auto-glass repair companies use to help set 
prices: a windshield for a Mercedes 190 costs $484.70, an Oldsmobile Cutlass 
windshield costs $249.25 and a windshield for a Ford Ranger costs $255.25. 
Front door windows cost: $165.40 for the Mercedes, $113.35 for the Oldsmobile 
and $190.45 for the Ford. 
</P>
<P>
But auto-glass repairers say such prices vary greatly from shop to shop because 
most offer discounts of 20% to 55% and have different arrangements with various 
insurance companies. Volume of business and availability also significantly 
affect the actual price consumers pay for new windows. 
</P>
<P>
Tom A. Gapen, general manager of San Diego-based All Star Glass, says he has 
noticed a rise in business during the holiday season as well. But, Gapen adds, 
the boost isn't always because of vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people, say those who get their windows broken earlier in the year, 
will hold off getting it fixed during the holidays because they rather spend 
their money on Christmas gifts," Gapen said. "But, as soon as the weather gets 
bad, when it starts raining, those plans get altered and they start coming into 
our shop." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its San Diego service center and corporate headquarters, All 
Star Glass operates four outlets in the county, in Chula Vista, El Cajon, 
Escondido and Oceanside. Since All Star Glass opened in July 1978 with two 
service centers, it has added eight outlets, including three in Los Angeles and 
two in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids hitting baseballs through windshields, tourists getting their cars broken 
into at the Zoo or Sea World, vandalism . . . we're pretty busy year-round," 
Gapen said.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the Dow Jones Industrial Average closes in on its all-time high, most San 
Diego stocks continue to meander in a narrow range, with few exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
New highs this past week were reached by Medical Imaging Centers, at $11.50, 
and Xytronyx, at $14.125. There have been no announcements during the past week 
to account for either of these moves. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed Corp. announced that, by merging with its thrift subsidiary, Columbus 
Savings, it will use some of its net-loss carryforward of $170 million to 
offset fourth-quarter loss allowances of $115 million. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed's allowance will serve to optimize its future earnings and capital 
position as well as prepare for a possible slowdown in the economy, which might 
effect California real estate values. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed stock, which sold in early October at $47.50, fell to $28 last week but 
managed to close Monday at $31.375 as it attracted bargain hunters and found 
favor with some brokerage analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Mail Boxes Etc. seems to be in its own bear market. Reported earnings have been 
rising, but the stock has been under pressure, falling $2.50 the past week. New 
lows were recorded by Rohr Industries, which recently reported poor earnings, 
and TCS Enterprises, which is involved in the Charles Keating-Lincoln Savings 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
First National Corp. dropped $1, to $18.75, down from its year's high of 
$23.125. Agouron Pharmaceuticals holds it annual meeting at 10 a.m. Dec. 7 at 
Embassy Suites Hotel in La Jolla.

National Technical Systems, a Calabasas-based company that provides testing 
services to the aerospace, communications and automotive industries, said it 
won an $800,000 contract to provide test support for Marquardt Corp.'s National 
Aerospace Plane project. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys-based Marquardt is one of a few defense contractors in a race to build 
the jet engines for the National Aerospace Plane, an experimental craft that 
would fly 10 times faster and three times higher than existing commercial 
aircraft. At $3.3 billion, it is the most expensive experimental aircraft

'ARCTIC BLAST' SPREADS TO FLORIDA, SLOWS TRAVELERS IN NORTHEAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Temperatures dropped to record lows Monday as far south as Florida, where Tampa 
registered just 33 degrees, and the cold plus up to 2 feet of fresh snow closed 
schools and slowed travel in parts of the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at an arctic blast here," said Art Lester of the National 
Weather Service in Portland, Me. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Washington, Boston and Philadelphia stepped up efforts to place 
homeless people in warm shelters. At least 11 deaths were blamed on the weather 
during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-dawn temperatures at Albany, N.Y., were in the single digits, but 25-m.p.h. 
wind made it feel like 30 degrees below zero, the National Weather Service 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our first real arctic air outbreak of the season," said meteorologist 
Al Moore of the weather service at Newark, N.J., where it was 15 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
But relief was on the way with a warm front sweeping across the Midwest. At 
midday, temperatures across Illinois ranged from 32 on the Chicago lake front 
to 51 at Belleville, near St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pacific Northwest, the problem was melting snow and heavy rain that 
threatened floods and caused mudslides, one of which pushed a van off a busy 
road east of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures hit record lows all across Florida, including 47 at Miami, 39 at 
Ft. Myers, 33 at Tampa, 40 at St. Petersburg and 27 at Apalachicola. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Alabama had record lows, including 25 at the Gulf of Mexico port of 
Mobile. In Mississippi, Jackson and Meridian each hit a record low of 20. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak reported delays of two hours Monday on trains between New York and 
Washington because of weather-related problems in a fiber-optic cable that 
handles switches, said spokeswoman Sue Martin. Temporary repairs were made by 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Shelters for the homeless were full overnight Sunday in the District of 
Columbia. Officials said two vans were on the street to provide warm food and 
drinks to homeless people who couldn't find shelter. In Philadelphia, a low of 
18 brought additional homeless to already crowded shelters, forcing officials 
to add 125 beds for a total of 2,975.

'LOVE OBJECTS' SHINE BUT DO NOT INCLUDE ARTIST'S WHEELCHAIR

<P>
When he left Mississippi in 1967, Geer Morton wanted to paint huge, angry 
murals protesting the racism he had witnessed there during two years of civil 
rights work. Police dogs attacking helpless black children, Southern whites 
brutalizing innocent black men and women. 
</P>
<P>
Morton's anger was, and still is, authentic. But violence and social comment 
never found a voice on his canvas. What flows more naturally from his brushes 
are the daily, commonplace wonders he calls "little love objects." A disorderly 
desk, a favorite rural porch view, garden roses on a Union Jack, an elderly 
neighbor. He exalts them on his canvasses like paeans to a lover. 
</P>
<P>
Bearded and bespectacled, Morton, 54, has gained increasing national 
recognition for his crude, color-splashed portrayals of those love objects, 
muscular paintings that seem to divulge more from a distance than up close. 
Shows in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Denver have all met with 
success. His latest paintings are on display through Saturday at Tarbox Gallery 
in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
But the one thing Morton has yet to paint is his wheelchair, which for nearly 
30 years has been more an object of his contempt than love. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly not a 'love object' yet," Morton said, sitting in his 
wheelchair outside his Mission Hills studio. 
</P>
<P>
An automobile accident at age 24 left both of Morton's legs paralyzed. Since 
then, he has shunned public use of his wheelchair, preferring to maneuver his 
lanky frame around on leg braces and forearm crutches. And, though he produces 
many of his paintings from his wheelchair, it has never accompanied him to any 
exhibit openings. The opening reception at Tarbox Gallery was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I wasn't friends with my wheelchair," Morton said. "I saw it as a 
symbol of being crippled, and I didn't want to look at that too often. I could 
face it for short periods of time. But there was a lot of resentment about 
that. Still is." 
</P>
<P>
Morton speaks mostly in the past tense because he is slowly loosening the knot 
of fear and bitterness that kept him from truly accepting his paralysis. Since 
his wife's death three years ago, Morton has been on a painful journey of 
self-discovery -- "in the pit of enormous change," as he put it -- from which 
his wife and years of alcoholism protected him. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, Morton abandoned alcohol. To the dismay of one New York art 
dealer, he even swore off making "booze paintings," still-lifes that include 
bottles of booze. A collection of 50 or 60 of the paintings sold quite well at 
the dealer's exhibit several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Morton also has stopped avoiding people with severe physical disabilities. He 
recently joined the Challenge Center in El Cajon, a workout facility for the 
physically disabled. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to identify, and now I do," he said. "I steered clear of 
(disabled people). I found other people's handicaps embarrassing. That's 
embarrassing to say." 
</P>
<P>
Morton's resentment over his disability didn't begin to melt until this year, 
when he saw a photograph of his studio taken by his companion, Joan Crone. With 
no prior arranging, Crone captured his empty wheelchair resting in the center 
of the studio near a self-portrait. The wheelchair seemed as much Morton as his 
physical self. 
</P>
<P>
"That startled me, and yet I was touched by it," he said. "It was a statement 
of acceptance. . . . Seeing the photograph was a gift to me." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, Morton never would have become an artist were it not for the accident 
that put him in a wheelchair. At the time, he was studying politics and 
government at the University of Colorado, after three years in the Army. As an 
honors student he was able to audit any class he wanted; he found himself drawn 
to the art classes. He also discovered an enormous talent. 
</P>
<P>
Reevaluating his career after the accident, Morton decided to attend art school 
and pursue a profession in painting. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I could walk and run and ski, and feel competitive, I could treat 
my talent as something superfluous, as a luxury, a bonus that could be spent or 
not spent," he said. "I had a sense afterwards that it was time I looked at 
that gift in a serious way." 
</P>
<P>
But very little in his life to that point had even hinted at a career in art. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a list of 250 attractive occupations, painting wasn't on it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Even after training at the prestigious San Francisco Art Institute, Morton 
never quite believed that painting had become his profession. Artists were 
flamboyant and bohemian, he thought, not conservative and introspective as he 
was. Artists lived in big cities, aggressively pursuing the artistic fads du 
jour. He lived in the Northern California countryside, toiling at his personal 
view of art. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me 20 years of being a practicing artist to call myself an artist," he 
said, dressed in his customary paint-speckled green fatigues and plaid flannel 
shirt. "I just never thought of myself as one. And I really still today don't 
think of myself as an artist. Finally, I call myself an artist because I know I 
am." 
</P>
<P>
Morton recently left his country home and studio to live part time in San 
Diego. He also spends several months a year in rural Maine, where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
It was in Maine that his art career might have been preordained. His earliest 
memory there is of himself as a 1 1/2-year-old toddler staring awe-struck at 
the circles of sunshine glowing on the Oriental rug where he lay. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still looking at the sun in that way," he said. "The shadows, and the 
combination of shots of sunlight surrounded by spots of shadow, are my earliest 
memories, and they're the subject of my work today." 
</P>
<P>
Light and shadow, space and tension -- those are the pieces of the puzzle 
Morton wrestles with in each painting. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like in our love lives, the interest for us is in the space between us," 
he said. "It's the space between objects, as the space between lovers, that 
makes life work." 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen years of life in the country gave Morton plenty of space to work with. 
There, he and his wife lived self-sufficiently, building their own house, 
raising sheep and other farm animals, bringing up three children. 
</P>
<P>
But the country never cultivated in him the patience that often accompanies a 
slower-paced rural life style. He paints speedily and rarely spends more than 
an afternoon on one painting. He hates to retouch a canvas, preferring instead 
to let the sensual image hang on its initial inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"Like I'm a sloppy eater, I'm a sloppy painter," he said. "Things dribble here 
and there. It's not that I disregard neatness, it's that I'm in a hurry -- it 
takes one too much time and thought to be neat. The sun is always going down or 
the wind is blowing or I'm cold, or something." 
</P>
<P>
Morton can be as relentlessly critical of himself as he is of his work. 
Self-descriptions almost always yield a list of negative traits encased in a 
self-mocking sense of humor. He once likened himself to his 2-year-old 
grandson: "full of sound and fury, blubbering . . . bitching, grumbling, 
commenting on stuff, pointing and demanding . . . dropping stuff on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Morton said he is trying to use the deeper self-revelations of the last couple 
of years to add intimacy and patience to his work, to remove more masks so that 
raw images and ideas will flow through him like a psychic medium onto the 
canvas. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping that there will be an honesty in my work that was only there in 
unusual moments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Already, people familiar with his work through the last two decades, say 
they've noticed his recent work blossoming like the idealized flowers he loves 
to paint. 
</P>
<P>
"His work always had sort of a very spontaneous quality, but it was a little 
moody," said Lisa Dubins, owner of Dubins Gallery in Los Angeles. "The mood 
seems more mature now. There's more of a confidence, though he was always a 
bold painter." 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, any new openness in his painting hasn't extended to his 
wheelchair. In attempting to explain why he hasn't yet painted it, Morton tried 
several avenues of escape. He doesn't want to clutter his work with irrelevant 
social comment. He doesn't often paint machines. Many of his inanimate subjects 
are antique. 
</P>
<P>
"Would I be more inclined to paint a 1910 wheelchair than a new one?" he asked, 
predicting the next question. "Nah, probably not." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, it came down to how Morton views his wheelchair -- both literally 
and figuratively. 
</P>
<P>
"So much of the pleasure of painting is being immersed in the pleasure of 
vision," he said. "With a scene I'd like to paint, I want to take it inside me. 
I want to reach out my arms, gather it all to me and make it part of myself." 
</P>
<P>
Objectively, he conceded that his wheelchair possesses the graceful curves and 
supple lines that he requires of his subjects. And he can see the way the soft 
San Diego sunlight reflects from its metal arms in a way that on any other 
subject might captivate him. But the thing is still too personally repugnant -- 
too much a symbol of limitations -- for him to visually appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure what I want to think about my wheelchair at this point," he said. 
"These are very painful questions that I've been asking myself. I guess it's 
something to look at and do and see where it takes me. It would be a step."

NEW WAVE ANSWER TO STRESS ON THE STREET? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL S. KAPLAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the morning before his first brain spa treatment, Frank Lindemann was 
stressed out, harried and generally in an unpleasant mood. 
</P>
<P>
"That's typical," the 32-year-old financial executive said. "My work is nonstop 
and can be high-pressure." 
</P>
<P>
But after a 35-minute lunch session at the New York Mind Fitness Center, a new 
New Age emporium in the cold heart of New York's financial district, Lindemann 
emerged "incredibly relaxed," ready, even, to face afternoon client meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, "I think I was walking around the street kind of smiling to myself 
without realizing it," said Lindemann, co-owner of Riverside Consultants Inc., 
a New York-based maker of financial software. "I don't usually walk around 
smiling." 
</P>
<P>
This is no joke. 
</P>
<P>
Since The New York Mind Fitness Center opened its door at the end of September, 
dozens of New York's most frazzled money makers and traders have cast their 
skepticism aside to get the "treatment," which consists of staring into a 
sound- and light-emitting machine called Innerquest that allegedly tunes a 
user's brain waves and induces blissful calmness. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 20 to 40 brain spas nationwide that employ electronic machines 
similar to Innerquest, said Michael Hutchison, author of "Megabrain," a book on 
brain enhancement. 
</P>
<P>
Most such facilities cater to spiritual seekers, ex-hippies and the 
scientifically inquisitive. 
</P>
<P>
But the New York Mind Fitness Center, which bills itself as "Wall Street's 
First Brain Exchange," is the first to market its services to business 
executives, Hutchison said. "These machines can help relieve stress, and stress 
is endemic on Wall Street." 
</P>
<P>
The New York Mind Fitness Center is in a small, doctor's-office-like suite two 
blocks from Wall Street. Its wood floors are polished, its walls white matte; 
the shades are drawn. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Dan Perl, 29, a former optician who wears cardigan sweaters and speaks in 
soothing tones, said he decided to open a Wall Street-based mind spa because 
"the great financial corporations are down here, and here is where high-strung 
executives work." 
</P>
<P>
At the spa, clients -- about 20 a week -- are asked to recline in one of six 
white Naugahyde chairs in the cozy "exchange room," so called because stress, 
theoretically, is exchanged for relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
To begin the treatment, users wear goggles containing small pulsing red lights. 
They also wear headphones that emit soothing music -- a mixture of jazz, bird 
chirps, heartbeats, breaking surf and electronic beeps. 
</P>
<P>
The principle behind Innerquest and similar light-and-sound machines is "follow 
the leader," Perl said. 
</P>
<P>
The lights in the goggles, connected to a programmed computer console, begin to 
pulse at a frequency associated with a particular set of brain waves. 
Proponents say that the brain locks onto that frequency, and as the lights 
"ramp down" to a slower rhythm, the brain follows. 
</P>
<P>
At slower-pulsing speeds, Perl said, Innerquest induces in the user alpha and 
theta brain waves -- electrical activity associated with deep meditation and 
calm awareness. 
</P>
<P>
Cost for a 30-minute tuneup: $20. 
</P>
<P>
Wilbur Robinson -- Innerquest inventor, president of Psych-Research Inc., the 
machine's producer, and an Arizona-based psychotherapist -- says that since the 
mid-1980s, he has sold about 100 of the $7,500 console models like the ones 
used by Perl, and perhaps 6,000 to 8,000 portable, home-use models ($495 to 
$595 retail). 
</P>
<P>
Robinson acknowledges there is "no real bona fide scientific study" backing up 
Innerquest's claim of alpha and theta tuning. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, you get the same result by meditating or watching a beautiful 
sunset, but in this case the machine (creates the benefits) for you," Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Victor Herbert, professor of medicine at the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine 
in New York and a frequent critic of medical quackeries, said he is "skeptical, 
to put it mildly," about the effectiveness of Innerquest and similar 
sound-and-light devices -- including Synchro-Energizer, D.A.V.I.D. and 
Minds-eye -- available at various spas. 
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental rule with respect to all therapy is that no product works 
until it is objectively demonstrated to work," Herbert said, adding that brain 
spas sounded like "a lucrative scam" to him. 
</P>
<P>
In the court of human experience, several of Perl's clients said they have 
gained great benefits from Innerquest. 
</P>
<P>
James Searl, 43, a vice president in charge of futures trading for a New York 
money broker, found his brain-spa session "interesting . . . relaxing." 
</P>
<P>
"I work in a very high-pressure job," he said. "You can feel the tension in the 
back of your neck and across your shoulders. (Innerquest) is a good release, 
kind of a quick fix when I don't have time to go to a 90-minute physical 
workout." 
</P>
<P>
For Iris Bell, 37, assistant to the managing director of Robert Fleming Inc., 
an investment banker, brain tuning is better than other stress-busting 
pursuits: "Most people leave work and go out for a beer. I'd rather go down to 
Dan's and get zapped. It's a lot better and cheaper."

CRITIC AT LARGE: DIVING INTO THE 'LITTLE MERMAID' SEXISM ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a USC screening of "The Little Mermaid" the other night, a young woman asked 
the co-authors and co-directors, in a tone that could be characterized as 
civilly indignant, whether a woman had been consulted in the creation of the 
script. 
</P>
<P>
Was what she called the "Some-Day-My-Prince-Will-Come" Syndrome (in which the 
answer to any mermaid's prayer is simply to find a good man) their work solely 
or a coeducational enterprise? 
</P>
<P>
It was clear the questioner could not believe there had been any feminine 
input. She read Disney's new animated feature as reflecting a traditional if 
perhaps unconscious sexist view of the woman's role and goal. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Clements and John Musker, Disney animators and writers since 1974 and 1977 
respectively, said that women had indeed been part of the creative process. 
They admitted, wryly, that the question had come up before. 
</P>
<P>
They argued that the mermaid was a far cry from such enchanting but essentially 
passive heroines as Cinderella and the prince-awaiting Snow White. 
</P>
<P>
It is true on the one hand that the mermaid flips out when she catches sight of 
her handsome, lovelorn, land-dwelling prince. But what is also true, they 
pointed out, is that the mermaid has been established as a resourceful, 
independent-minded and even headstrong, insatiably adventurous and active young 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
More than that, she is at last prepared to say goodby, painfully, to father and 
closest friends and begin a new life in the name of both love and adventure, 
not any more regarded as incompatible aims. 
</P>
<P>
The implication seems clear enough from the film that if the prince is 
expecting a do-nothing princess he has got another think coming. They met when 
she saved him from drowning, after all. 
</P>
<P>
Another questioner observed that in the originating Hans Christian Andersen 
fairy tale, the little mermaid dies, and how come the story line was changed? 
</P>
<P>
The idea of generations of moppets and their parents and grandparents rushing 
off to see an animated film in which the heroine dies for trying to rise above 
her aquatic station, so to speak, fairly well answered itself. It was an undue 
and probably inappropriate risk for a multimillion dollar enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
What does come as an occasional jolt to audiences conditioned to fairy tales as 
popularized historically not only by Disney itself, but by children's books, 
radio and television as well, is that fairy tales were sometimes grim whether 
by the Brothers Grimm or not. They were cautionary moral tales (poor gluttonous 
Hansel and Gretel!) and no one escaped the iron laws of seemly behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The questions from a university audience were instructive. They reaffirmed that 
all films, even animated features, can be interpreted as carrying messages, 
whether intentional or not. "The Little Mermaid" is not about feminine 
consciousness or about the possibility of living in two different worlds. But 
obviously it is, or it can be made to be. 
</P>
<P>
In fact "The Little Mermaid" is a first return in 30 years to the fairy tale 
form with which Walt Disney had such remarkable success commencing with "Snow 
White." It restores the clarity of story that had been missing from many of the 
ambitious animated features from Disney and elsewhere in recent times. 
</P>
<P>
You don't need a score card to know who is good and who is evil in "The Little 
Mermaid." The suspense as to who will win is established early and sustained to 
the end, decorated with some bright songs (from the composers, Alan Menken and 
Howard Ashman, of "Little Shop of Horrors") and some grand slapstick. 
</P>
<P>
Challenged, as Musker and Clements admit, by the immaculate and elaborate 
animation of ex-Disneyite Don Bluth in "The Secret of NIMH" and "An American 
Tail," a new generation of Disney animators went all out -- leaving no shimmer 
unshimmering -- on "The Little Mermaid." It was four years' work by a crew that 
reached 400 strong, and it looks it. 
</P>
<P>
But in animation as in live-action, there is no substitute for a strong script. 
Musker and Clements noted that "The Little Mermaid" was written line for line 
before the first squiggles hit paper. It is the best animated Disney feature 
since "The Rescuers" (which still had no ending, well into production.) 
</P>
<P>
When, finally, it is right, animation celebrates and stimulates the limitless 
human imagination like no other form of film. Audiences seem to agree, as the 
attendance at both "The Little Mermaid" and Don Bluth's new "All Dogs Go to 
Heaven" indicates. 
</P>
<P>
Also like live-action, animation has evolved along with the sophistication of 
even its youngest viewers. "The Little Mermaid" is calypso-hip and has a 
villainess right out of a Klondike saloon. The hip and the innocent can 
coexist.

Michel Warren Bell -- known as Mic Bell when he sang with the Fifth Dimension 
-- will sing Joe in Jerome Kern's "Show Boat" for Opera Pacific July 13 through 
22 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, according to a biography of the 
performer printed in a Los Angeles Philharmonic program booklet last week. 
Opera Pacific officials did not return calls to confirm or deny the 
information. Bell was seen as Porgy in a revival of the Houston Grand Opera 
production of "Porgy and Bess" that Opera Pacific brought to the Center in 
1987.

JESSE JACKSON RESPONDS TO PORTRAIT OF HIM AS WHITE 
</P>

Jesse Jackson, viewing for the first time the controversial painting that 
depicts him as a blond, blue-eyed white man, said, "It's not the picture that's 
the insult. It's the reality behind the picture: That's the insult." 
</P>
<P>
The portrait, entitled "How Ya Like Me Now?" by artist David Hammons and part 
of the Washington Project for the Arts "The Blues Aesthetic" exhibition, was 
placed on a street corner Wednesday evening. Just as three white WPA employees 
completed the installation, a group of about 10 black men took a sledgehammer 
to the work, knocking a major portion down. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon, when he toured the exhibition, Jackson saw the bottom section 
of the work, which shows his face from eyebrows to chin. He made the visit, he 
said, to encourage the gallery, to encourage artistic expression and to put 
both the portrait and the reaction to it "in context." 
</P>
<P>
The "reaction is an extension of the art," he said. "You drop a big rock in the 
water -- the issue is not just the rock. It's also the ripples. This is a big 
rock." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he did not personally find the work insulting "because I 
understand it. My response was interpretation and intent. But I understand 
those that reacted violently. We must appreciate the source of their pain. They 
must not be painted out of the equation." 
</P>
<P>
The work, he speculated, provoked a release of anger that sat just beneath the 
surface. The men who attacked the portrait reacted "without inhibitions, 
without reserve. They said, 'This is an insult.' 
</P>
<P>
"Those that responded without asking 'What does it mean?' -- that was artistic 
too. Reducing the street saying 'If he were white . . .' to art, to a picture, 
is one thing. It's people feeling a sense of indignity. Suppose their insult 
level was so low that this did not provoke them? 
</P>
<P>
"Last year I heard, 'Man if you were not black, you'd be a cinch,' or 'If you 
were white, you'd be President.' Well, that is a sinful suggestion because one 
can only be what God has allowed one to be. In some sense, the artist captured 
what really is a common saying but a rather humiliating predicament. . . . One 
should not have to be anything but what one is." 
</P>
<P>
WPA Board President Jim Fitzpatrick said the work had been displayed inside the 
gallery for three months while the WPA awaited permission from the city for the 
outdoor installation, which is on city property. While inside, he said, the 
work provoked comments but no violence or controversy. Permission to display 
the work outside was granted early last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Anytime you have a work of art out on the street," Fitzpatrick said, "you can 
touch a very raw nerve. 
</P>
<P>
"The piece poses two questions," he said. "It poses to whites: Can you look 
past race to an individual? And it poses to blacks: Can you deal with one of 
the most revered individuals and symbols depicted other than as an icon?" 
</P>
<P>
WPA commissioned "How Ya Like Me Now?" and works by six other artists for the 
exhibition, which explores the effect of black culture on contemporary art. 
Four of the works were intended for public display outdoors.

HOLLYWOOD'S HOTTEST COMEDY DIRECTOR TAKES A BREAK; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: AFTER 'TWINS' AND 'GHOSTBUSTERS II,' PRODUCER-DIRECTOR IVAN REITMAN 
DECIDES THERE'S MORE TO FILM THAN LAUGHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN FARLEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ghostbusters are going out of business and the Twins will have to raise 
their families offscreen . . . maybe. 
</P>
<P>
Producer-director Ivan Reitman, who spent much of his summer hearing what a 
failure "Ghostbusters II" was at the box office, has given Columbia Pictures a 
firm "I don't think so" about doing "Ghostbusters III" and has told Universal 
that he is not going to do a sequel to "Twins." 
</P>
<P>
Most directors would kiss the devil for a box-office hit the size of 
"Ghostbusters II." But in the hottest summer season ever enjoyed by Hollywood, 
the film got ambushed by "Batman" and ended up fifth overall. Comparing its 
domestic grosses against the more than $200 million earned by "Ghostbusters" in 
1984, it left him wanting more. 
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed that it didn't do as well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 12 months, Americans have bought about nearly a quarter of a 
billion dollars worth of tickets to Reitman films. "Twins," which was released 
at Christmas, and "Ghostbusters II," released early in the summer, took in 
about $111 million each. On this kind of roll, a producer generally gets right 
to work on the next set of sequels. 
</P>
<P>
But Reitman, relaxing in his rose-and-green-hued office at the Burbank Studios, 
is in no hurry as he reflects on recent events. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Ghostbusters II' wasn't as much fun to make as the first one," Reitman 
explained. "In comedy, the element of surprise is everything. And I think once 
that element of surprise is gone, once people know there's going to be ghosts, 
there's going to be big ghosts, and they're expecting something big at the end, 
a lot of the tools that are at your disposal are gone." 
</P>
<P>
When Reitman makes a movie, people know there's going to be male buddies and a 
broadly comic theme: Bill Murray as a summer-camp scoutmaster ("Meatballs"); 
Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson as scientists in the silly 
art of busting ghosts, and venal, shrimpy Danny DeVito and big, lovable Arnold 
Schwarzenegger as wombmates separated at birth ("Twins"). 
</P>
<P>
At 42, Reitman has the most lucrative track record in comedy film making. This 
year alone, his movies have grossed over $300 million at the box office, 
counting the domestic and foreign take from "Twins." But he's in no hurry to 
build the account; at the moment, he said, his company has no movies in 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually as I'm finishing a film, I start gestating (an idea for the next 
film). I purposely sort of forced myself not to this time . . . I think (the 
break) will help me develop a fresh perspective on what I'm doing. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the films I've made to date have been relatively large-scale films with 
elaborate concepts and I'd like to try a few things on a more human scale and 
see how it works out. It's not so much that I want to turn to serious drama 
right now and bare my soul any more than it's bared. It's just I think it would 
be fun to tell a smaller story . . . less plot and more character. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have to move people emotionally much more. I think I'm just learning 
what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
The last time Reitman tried something different was "Legal Eagles," which had 
Robert Redford and Debra Winger shoehorned into semi-serious roles originally 
created for Murray and Dustin Hoffman. The result was labeled a disaster, a 
description that "drove me crazy," Reitman said, because the 1986 movie did 
make money. 
</P>
<P>
"Legal Eagles" and "Ghostbusters II" have something in common, in fact. In both 
cases, the long, behind-the-scenes political tango leading up to the actual 
production captured as much press attention as the movies. 
</P>
<P>
With "Legal Eagles," the controversy was over packaging, the industry term for 
loading a movie with a director, writer and stars from the same talent agency 
-- in this case, clients of Creative Artists Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The "Ghostbusters II" controversy concerned former Columbia Pictures head David 
Puttnam, who was reportedly ushered out of his job partly because he alienated 
both CAA head Michael Ovitz (Puttnam publicly denounced packaging) and Bill 
Murray (he reportedly criticized the star for taking from Hollywood without 
giving anything back). In any event, it took five years for Columbia to get the 
"Ghostbusters" sequel into the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
"It really wasn't Puttnam" who caused the delay, Reitman said. The problem was 
that none of the principals wanted to do a sequel for two or three years, and 
by the time most of them had decided they were ready, Murray wanted to sandwich 
another film ("Scrooged") between the two "Ghostbusters." And when Murray was 
ready, the script wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
"At some point, when it appeared that Puttnam was the cause of the delay," 
Reitman said, "executives above Puttnam at Columbia in New York contacted us to 
see whether we could make the deal as a separate company apart from Columbia 
just to make sure that it wasn't Puttnam that was the problem." 
</P>
<P>
But the New York executives who tried to end-run Puttnam were unable to make 
the sequel happen any sooner. 
</P>
<P>
As for "Legal Eagles," Reitman said that he developed the story after Hoffman 
said he'd like to reteam with Murray, who played his roommate in "Tootsie." 
When Hoffman and Murray "disappeared," Reitman said -- Hoffman to make "Ishtar" 
and Murray to take a long vacation in France -- Reitman was stuck with the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
"I mentioned it to Mike (Ovitz) and I asked what actors were looking for what 
kinds of things," Reitman said. "He said, 'Redford's really looking to do a 
comedy. . . . He wouldn't mind working with you, so why don't you go meet him 
and see what happens."' 
</P>
<P>
Redford liked the idea and the two continued to work together on it until the 
actor committed, Reitman said: "We decided that for his particular character, 
it would be better if the partner were a woman. Then I started casting like any 
other director." 
</P>
<P>
Other reports imply that Winger was pressured by her CAA agents to do the 
movie. But Reitman insisted that it's "ridiculous to believe that any agent, no 
matter how powerful, can get actors of the caliber of Bill Murray or Robert 
Redford or Debra Winger or a director as independent as I am to make a film 
that they don't want to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I auditioned probably 100 different women, and in fact Debra Winger auditioned 
for the piece. You know, she's complained many times because it's a useful 
publicity tool for her about being packaged in the story, but she wasn't. She 
fought for the piece." 
</P>
<P>
Few film makers have operated more profitably than Reitman. The deal he cut for 
"Ghostbusters II" gave him and his stars a chunk of the box-office gross that 
was close to 10% each, according to some reports. Reitman said the 10% figure 
is not accurate, "but it's a big one." 
</P>
<P>
Reitman is now testing his magic touch in the vast wasteland. He's launched a 
TV division at his company, and plans to develop one project at a time, as he 
has always done with movies. But film continues to be his main interest and the 
current layoff he has imposed on himself has its own insecurities. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how successful one is, or how many films one has made, there is that 
sort of discomfort when you're not working that you'll never work again," he 
said. "Even though, consciously, I think that's a ridiculous attitude, I do 
suffer from it to a certain extent."

MONEY PROBLEMS PLAGUE TWO THEATERS IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>

<P>
As the year draws to a close, two of Orange County's major theatrical 
institutions -- the oldest and the youngest -- have been afflicted by a common 
disease: broken promises and unfinished business. 
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old Laguna Playhouse, which produces an amateur season at the 
Moulton Theatre, has given up on its planned purchase of the vacant General 
Telephone Building on Mermaid Street, where it had expected to establish a 
second, smaller theater for a professional troupe. 
</P>
<P>
The phone company "scuttled the deal by raising its price almost a million 
dollars," says Douglas Rowe, artistic director of the Playhouse, which had had 
"an informal agreement" to purchase the property for about $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The new price tag of nearly $3 million is beyond the theater's reach, Rowe 
said, making it unlikely that his hope of bringing professional productions to 
this coastal town would be realized any time soon. "It's the most frustrating 
thing I've ever been involved with in my life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the deal has fallen through, the Laguna Playhouse also lost "the most 
valuable board member we had," Rowe said. John von Szeliski, a Newport Beach 
theater architect who had been recruited especially to oversee a second-theater 
project, recently resigned from the Playhouse's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 4 1/2-year-old Irvine Theatre Operating Co., which will run the 
750-seat Irvine Theatre now under construction at UC Irvine, has failed to 
raise even half the money that its officials had vowed to raise in public 
testimony at an Irvine City Council meeting a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the council had to decide whether to ante up $1.8 million to meet 
the city's share of a $5.4 million gap between the lowest construction bid of 
$17.6 million and the $12.2 million initially estimated as the building's cost. 
</P>
<P>
The theater, which is expected to open in October, 1990, is a joint venture of 
the city, the university and the nonprofit operating company. Each partner has 
agreed to share costs equally. 
</P>
<P>
The council wanted assurances from the company that it could afford its 
additional share of the construction costs. Thomas H. Nielsen, chairman of the 
theater's board of trustees, had said that the operating company would raise $3 
million by the end of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
That amount would bring its fund-raising goal to at least $4.5 million, 
including the $1.5 million that the operating company asserted it already had 
raised mainly through corporate pledges during the six months before the city 
council meeting in December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
To date, the operating company has received total of slightly less than $2.3 
million in "verbal commitments," according to the latest figures provided by 
Douglas C. Rankin, general manager of the operating company. And only $840,000 
had been collected, as of Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Rankin denied that the shortfall posed a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Our revised target is to achieve all the fund-raising before the theater 
opens," he said. "I don't know that there is any difficulty that anyone else 
doesn't experience (in fund-raising). It's a challenging task. You always want 
it to go faster than it might seem." 
</P>
<P>
The city council has not been notified of this revision, said Cameron Cosgrove, 
one of the council's five members. "I wouldn't get worried until February or 
March," said Irvine city manager Paul Brady. 
</P>
<P>
Theater construction continues on schedule, Rankin said. JAN HERMAN

O.C. GOES AGAINST LOW TIDE IN TURNOUTS FOR DAY WITHOUT ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Unlike most Southern California museums participating in the national Day 
Without Art observance last week, those in Orange County reported 
better-than-average turnouts for activities marking the impact of AIDS on the 
arts community. 
</P>
<P>
At the Newport Harbor Art Museum in Newport Beach, a performance Friday by Tim 
Miller drew "a much larger and wider audience than we had anticipated," said 
museum spokeswoman Maxine Gaiber. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, a Los Angeles-based performance artist, presented "Sex/Love/AIDS: 
Stories From Life," a solo focusing on his experiences as a gay man, to a 
standing-room only crowd of 140 people. The museum's attendance overall totaled 
215, Gaiber added, noting that fewer than 200 typically attend on Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance was up from the usual 100 to about 120 at the Laguna Art Museum, 
where a Red Cross representative offered information on AIDS and signs referred 
to the day's observance. 
</P>
<P>
And while attendance was normal, about $150 was raised in admission fees at the 
Fullerton Museum Center in Fullerton, which will donate the money to AIDS 
services of the local Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, which showed films on AIDS throughout 
the day, also reported one of the best responses in terms of turnout: About 150 
people visited the museum on Friday, up from the usual 100, according to museum 
spokeswoman Diane Maxwel. In addition, the museum collected about $100 in its 
two donation boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, "we didn't particularly attract crowds, despite the free admission," 
Maxwell said. "I think it's reflected the fear -- I don't think people 
particularly wanted to deal with (events promoting AIDS awareness)." 
</P>
<P>
At the Museum of Contemporary Art in downtown Los Angeles, which also offered 
free admission, attendance was down to about 290 visitors from the usual 400, 
although about $650 was raised for AIDS Project Los Angeles. Spokeswoman 
Cynthia Campoy said that the museum attributed the low turnout to publicity 
reflecting that several museum and galleries were closed for the day. 
</P>
<P>
There were about 35 people at the Santa Monica Museum of Art, about a third of 
the regular Friday attendance, according to executive director Tom Rhoads. He 
attributed the low attendance to the fact that the museum's windows were 
blacked out, making it appear closed. About $100 was raised for AIDS Project 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Photographic Arts in San Diego had a smaller crowd than usual 
Friday but collected about $200 for donation to a local AIDS research 
organization, said director Arthur Ollman. 
</P>
<P>
At the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, which darkened its photography gallery 
to display a photograph of Samuel Wagstaff Jr., an important collector who died 
of AIDS in 1987, staff members said the reaction of museum-goers was very 
positive, although attendance was "pretty normal for a Friday." 
</P>
<P>
The Getty will donate about $800 from Friday's sale of 47 copies of Wagstaff's 
book, "A Collection of Photographs" to the American Foundation for AIDS 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which also admitted all patrons for 
free and passed out envelopes for patrons to mail donations to AIDS Project Los 
Angeles and other AIDS organizations, 843 people visited the museum -- about 50 
more than usual for a Friday, museum officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The museum also darkened a Robert Longo artwork called "Black Planet (for 
A.Z.)," which the artist dedicated to Arnie Zane, a friend who died of AIDS in 
1988. Instead, a spotlight was made to shine on a sign explaining the 
significance of a Day Without Art. Howard Fox, curator of contemporary art, 
said that museum-goers' response was "very effective. It was very poignant. It 
was in a place that everybody had to stop by, and everybody was stopping to 
read (the explanatory sign)." 
</P>
<P>
Response at the few participating local commercial galleries was dismal. Not a 
single painting was sold at LJB Gallery in Newport Beach, which planned to 
donate 10% of the day's proceeds to AIDS research, and at Dorothy Goldeen 
Gallery in Santa Monica, which requested that visitors make $3 donations to 
APLA, Goldeen estimated that less than $20 was raised.

Jazz Unlimited may never entirely shed its image as a Vegas-style dance troupe 
with more speed and pizazz than kinetic substance. But during last weekend's 
concert at San Diego State University's Don Powell Theatre, the company took a 
step in that direction with a pair of premieres that took their cues from the 
flowing lyricism of modern dance. Both "Summons," and "Silahkan" were obvious 
signposts of softer things to come, although the audience showed it preferred 
the old favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Nunn, a choreographer with roots firmly planted in the tenets of 
traditional modern dance, created the blunt-edged motional patterns and pretty 
stage pictures of "Summons." 
</P>
<P>
Despite unflattering costumes for both the men and the women, the dance ebbed 
and flowed nicely along the eerie lines of its Tibetan-flavored score. Brash 
lighting designs enhanced the mood. 
</P>
<P>
There were lapses in unison work at times, and the stop-action balances 
demanded more control, but "Summons" was a worthy addition to the repertory. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Rincon, founding director of the 10-year-old troupe, made a detour of 
her own with a new ensemble work she dubbed "Silahkan." The sextet owed its 
lovely, lyrical quality to the Eastern musical motifs of Zakir Hussain. Its 
East Indian stillness and supple moves of Egyptian dance were quite a departure 
for Rincon and her dancers. 
</P>
<P>
At its best, the dance should ripple along rhythmically, like leaves sailing on 
the crest of a gentle breeze. Unfortunately, the cast had difficulty sustaining 
that seamless flow of movement during its first performance Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The most disappointing work on the program was Rincon's lively "Trilogy," which 
seemed totally at odds with its laid-back, country-style accompaniment and the 
crude photo montage used as a backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
The old hallmarks of jazz dance still showed up in this concert, but not until 
the latter part of the six-piece program. Rincon's second premiere, "Grounded," 
a dramatic dance about stifling relationships and entrapment, began with a 
striking tableau of the five dancers in a huddle. They peeled apart for some 
rapid high jinks, but never strayed far from the core. It was a fine showcase 
for the dancers.

Jazz Unlimited went back to its 1985 signature work, "Company Break," for its 
only all-out crowd pleaser. The piece, with a rollicking score by Rob Mullins 
to propel it, is the kind of sassy show-biz shenanigans that Jazz Unlimited 
fans have come to expect. And it generated a spontaneous outbreak of applause 
and whistles when it burst on the scene for the finale. 
</P>
<P>
Jazz Unlimited may have designs on a new image, but, judging from the response 
it received Saturday night, it may have to find a new audience to accept it.

SNOW REMOVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first real snow of the winter season proved that the California Department 
of Transportation's recent changes in its snow removal procedures where 
shortsighted at best and a detriment to the public safety at worst. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans' plan to cut the use of road salt by 30% to protect the health of 
trees in the Lake Tahoe area is a first step in aiding the environment. 
However, simply cutting the use of salt without any compensation for the 
reduction increases ice on the road and the chance of accidents. This was 
proven over the Thanksgiving weekend when heavy snowfall caused numerous 
accidents, major delays and even hours-long closures on Highway 50 and 
Interstate 80. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens for Better Mountain Highways is a coalition of Sierra business owners, 
residents and visitors who are concerned about the environment as well as 
safety and accessibility of area highways. We urge Caltrans to employ 
alternative road de-icers, additional staff and more equipment this winter both 
to protect the environment and ensure the safety of those traveling Sierra 
Nevada roads.

In response to your editorial "Job Payoff for Teens," Nov. 29: 
</P>
<P>
How can we train kids to get jobs when business teachers are being slowly 
eliminated from California schools? 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles city schools, senior high business departments that once 
bustled with classes and activities are becoming ghost towns of few people and 
few course offerings. Courses in shorthand, business English, accounting, 
advanced typing, law, etc. have been discarded year by year. Business education 
programs that took years to build are being severely cut back in California 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
How do I know? I was a business teacher at Roosevelt High School in East Los 
Angeles for the past eight years. I taught brothers and sisters and cousins. I 
reached kids, and I gave them job skills to prepare for the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
Today I am a displaced business teacher looking for a job.

Cranston should be indicted for stupidity rather than for ethics. He's being 
neither better nor worse than most of those in "public" service. If he had any 
brains at all, he'd have gone to Japan where he could have made a couple of 
speeches telling them how great they are and touting more great deals in 
California real estate. In exchange he could have received fees that would make 
Charlie Keating look like a penny-pinching piker. 
</P>
<P>
Many congressmen, who have put their own interests before those of the nation, 
now want more money for services they never rendered. There are millions of men

the bucks and perks these jerks find so inadequate. Isn't it time we got rid of 
the deadwood? If you are as angry as I am, stop griping and vote!

HOW TO DISCREDIT YOUR CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The vandalism of four Roman Catholic Churches, ostensibly the work of those 
angry with the official position of the church on prevention of AIDS, is 
deplorable. So was the assault earlier on Los Angeles County property by 
so-called AIDS activists who judged the county's response to the epidemic 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic, in its cruel spread of AIDS, 
is violence enough. The solution will not be facilitated by compounding the 
cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
Those who vandalized the churches by smearing their exteriors with red paint 
left behind posters attacking the recent declaration of the National Conference 
of Catholic Bishops on the HIV epidemic. The bishops have been resolute in 
their expressions of compassion for the victims of the disease. But they have 
chosen to oppose the use of condoms, which most public health experts regards 
crucial to reducing the spread of the virus in a society where sexual 
promiscuity is widespread. We disagree with the bishops' prescription for the 
public as a whole. We must respect, however, their right to insist to their own 
members that sex be limited to a man and woman bound in marriage. 
</P>
<P>
There are adequate and appropriate forums for free expression of disparate 
points of view in the United States on this and other controversial issues. 
There have been dignified and peaceful demonstrations in the past protesting 
the position of the Roman Catholic Church on AIDS prevention. The resort to 
violence against church property impoverishes freedom and discredits its 
perpetrators. It risks diverting the community from its efforts to contain the 
disease at the moment when the only tools of containment are educating sexually 
active persons on the means of prevention.

DESERT RACE AND TORTOISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your brief report on this year's Barstow-Las Vegas motorcycle race (Nov. 
26), you quote a Bureau of Land Management spokesperson saying that BLM 
officials went over the course before and after the race and found no desert 
tortoises. The implications that no tortoises were harmed by the race is 
completely misleading. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, tortoises are now hibernating in their burrows and a surface 
sighting is very unlikely. Looking for tortoises crushed by off-road vehicles 
would make sense at other times, but not now. The danger is that off-road 
traffic has crushed burrow entrances, burying the endangered tortoises alive 
and suffocating them. 
</P>
<P>
Depending upon racing bikers to identify and avoid tortoise burrows in their 
path, whether in a race or free play, is an absurd policy, or rather an absence 
of policy.

Some comment on "3 Elderly Women Blame Cranston for Swindle" (Part A, Nov. 15). 
They claim that uninsured American Continental bonds were purchased assuming 
that they were insured. If they were told that the bonds were insured by 
Lincoln S&amp;L personnel, then they have a valid complaint.

I'm well aware many seniors are not sophisticated about financial matters. 
However, I believe some seniors only see the higher investment rate and fail to 
see the higher risk. Finally, some are simply greedy and may have only 
themselves to blame.

As for Cranston and the other four senators, if the allegations are true, I,

THE 'ANYBODY BUT CORY' COUP; 
</P>
<P>
PHILIPPINES: A CONVERGENCE OF PRESIDENT AQUINO'S WEAKNESS AND THE STRENGTH OF 
HER RIVALS HAS COME WITHIN A HAIRBREADTH OF TOPPLING HER GOVERNMENT. AND SHE 
MAY NOT LAST.

leave from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.

MANILA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Col. Gregorio (Gringo) Honasan, the populist right-wing leader of the 
catastrophic and nearly successful uprising here, defines a coup as "a function 
of (a) clear signal from a people to its military." That definition, offered in 
a published interview only the week before the coup began, put the Aquino 
government on notice. But the "clear signals" have been blinking for months. 
</P>
<P>
Manila is a city of crises in a nation in crisis. Garbage has piled up on every 
street. Brownouts bring the city to a halt for up to six hours a day. Public 
transit is so bad that some workers spend five hours a day hanging onto the 
backs of fume-spewing "jeepneys" to commute to work. The day before the coup, 
the government raised the price of gasoline by 25%, despite clear intelligence 
on the coup plot and despite the fact that Honasan's last coup attempt came 
just after a similar rise, with its immediate economic consequences for the 
poor. This city is palpably fed up. 
</P>
<P>
President Corazon Aquino has used up the capital of the 1986 "people's power" 
revolution and is being judged on her merits, now found wanting. To the taxi 
driver she appears as corrupt as Ferdinand Marcos because of her toleration of 
family fingers in the cookie jar. Small wonder that some columnists now remind 
readers nostalgically that the late dictator was at least smart enough to keep 
the price of gas and rice low and the streets clean and safe. 
</P>
<P>
The Philippines hungers for strong leadership. The most recent 1992 
presidential preference poll showed that the military hero of the 1986 
revolution and current secretary of national defense, Gen. Fidel Ramos, is the 
strongest candidate, though far from the only one. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the stage was set for Honasan's move by a successful coup de theatre a 
week before, in the mysterious descent from the skies of Aquino's billionaire 
cousin and political rival, Eduardo (Danding) Cojuangco. After four years of 
exile life in Los Angeles, this one-time Marcos crony managed to evade security 
and arrive secretly in Manila. Once he was here, no one could talk about 
anything else -- until the coup. 
</P>
<P>
This formidable man upstaged the president with his mere presence. His power 
and hold on sections of the country's military and political elite are 
overwhelming; that the country's richest man could reconstruct the presidential 
sweepstakes is as much a comment on Danding Cojuangco's strength as on cousin 
Cory's weakness. "Unless the military kills him, he will be president in 1992, 
by hook or crook," a leading columnist said. No one breathed a word of right or 
wrong; everyone ran to curry favor. 
</P>
<P>
The presumption of a connection between Cojuangco's return and the coup is 
irresistible, but speculative. At the least, Honasan took advantage of the 
humiliation that Cojuangco's arrival brought Aquino. And Honasan's sense that 
the public was fed up is confirmed by the extent to which bystanders, before 
the tide turned in the coup, flashed Marcos "V" signals, suggesting less a love 
for Marcos than an "ABC" -- Anybody But Cory -- attitude. 
</P>
<P>
The coup itself started as an open-handed game; all but the American cards and 
plays were known in advance. Notably absent was the "people's power" card that 
was decisive in ridding the country of Marcos in 1986. What mattered in 1989 
was American air power. When the U.S. Phantoms cracked across Manila from Clark 
Air Base on Friday afternoon, the coup was doomed, though not immediately dead. 
</P>
<P>
The American military card has always been assumed to be an automatic trump, 
but since independence it has never openly been played here. What the United 
States contributed operationally was less important than the seemingly 
open-ended promise of support. Once Manila's leaders knew they wouldn't be 
losers, they began opening fire on the rebels. As even the president conceded, 
until then the troops and pilots were sitting on the fence. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino has promised justice, with a glint of steel, for the rebels. She made 
the same vows last time, in 1987, but soon the mood turned to forgiveness, 
sweetened by a military pay increase. Honasan is the country's Rambo and it 
remains to be seen whether his influence can be eradicated. 
</P>
<P>
The coup attempts are the product of a leadership vacuum. The country is sated 
with weakness, and Aquino now will have to shape up or be pushed aside. "There 
is no way she can last out her term (until 1992) going on like this," a senator 
told me. Even her decision to wear slacks in the presidential palace for the 
first time is an indication that she understands the problem in this 
obsessively macho culture. 
</P>
<P>
Many believe that the top military brass will have to take control, perhaps as 
regents ruling in her name. Ramos, a West Point graduate, has angrily denied 
any such intent. "I did not put down five coups to let this country become a 
banana republic," he has said. But he is also a realist, and a lot has happened 
in the past four days. These events have so grievously damaged the Philippines 
that anything is now seen as possible.

ZIP CODE RATING REJECTED; 
</P>
<P>
BUT GILLESPIE ALLOWS AUTO INSURERS OTHER TESTS FOR POLICY PRICING; 
</P>
<P>
URBAN RATES COULD DIP; RURAL GO UP 
</P>

<P>
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie today struck down the use of sex and 
marital status in pricing auto insurance, and altered use of neighborhood-based 
pricing, the so-called territorial rating system, to reduce urban car insurance 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging emergency regulation issued after a month of hearings, 
Gillespie outlawed the use of "simple territory or ZIP code rating" in setting 
prices, but at the same time she allowed insurance companies to use a number of 
factors -- such as population density, accident frequency and litigation rates 
-- that will serve as surrogates for neighborhood-based prices. 
</P>
<P>
Despite allowing the surrogate factors, the commissioner said she still 
believes that when companies submit new rates based on her regulations, urban 
prices will go down and rural and suburban prices up. 
</P>
<P>
But in order to limit the resulting price increases to millions of rural and 
suburban drivers, Gillespie announced that she will place a cap on annual rate 
increases for nearly all the state's drivers to no more than the rise of the 
previous year's consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
The only exception to this would be drivers who have accidents or accumulate 
driving citations. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie said that in her opinion this would keep price hikes under the new 
system, written under the mandate of Proposition 103, to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
But she acknowledged that many insurance companies may challenge the limit of 
increases as an abridgement of their right to receive a fair rate of return on 
their auto insurance business as laid down in the state Supreme Court's 
decision upholding Proposition 103 last May 3. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie said she will go before Superior Court Judge Miriam A. Vogel in Los 
Angeles on Dec. 18 to seek a ruling upholding the system she laid down in the 
emergency regulation. 
</P>
<P>
She said she will tell the judge the court had protected the insurers with the 
fair rate of return standard, and now is the time to protect consumers with her 
balancing rate increase cap. 
</P>
<P>
Initial reactions by both insurer representatives and consumer groups to 
Gillespie's regulation were reserved. The insurers were critical and the 
consumer groups often said the commissioner had not gone far enough. 
</P>
<P>
The cap pegged to the consumer price index would replace the current freeze on 
rate increases that Gillespie instituted at the beginning of October. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner -- who announced Monday she was bowing out of the first race 
for an elected commissioner next year -- gave the companies 90 days to develop 
a new rate structure in accord with her emergency regulation, which she said 
would be superseded by a permanent regulation in March. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the uncertainties over how much the alterations in the territorial 
rating system would affect prices, it appeared that Gillespie's order, citing 
the Unruh Civil Rights Act outlawing the use of sex and marital status in 
setting auto insurance prices, could have a more immediate dramatic effect.

E. GERMANY'S HONECKER UNDER HOUSE ARREST

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Communist Party chief Erich Honecker and other members of his ousted 
leadership were placed under house arrest today, and the government disarmed 
the Communist Party's private army. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities placed Honecker and other former top officials under house arrest 
in their luxurious Wandlitz compound north of East Berlin. The compound has 
become a symbol of corruption and abuses of the past. 
</P>
<P>
"The former General Secretary (of the Communist Party) and President Erich 
Honecker is among those who are not allowed to leave their houses in the 
elegant compound," the official ADN news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
The house arrests were an act of "national self-defense" and resulted from "the 
will of the people," said Harri Haarland, the deputy chief prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
The house arrests are intended to keep the former Politburo members from 
fleeing the country. Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, the former top foreign 
trader with the West, fled after allegations that he was involved in huge 
weapons deals. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker, 77, has been in ill health after gallbladder surgery last summer and 
had been a virtual recluse in Wandlitz even before his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry said the government was disarming the "fighting groups," 
the Communist Party-run militia based in the nation's factories. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the weapons taken away included automatic rifles, 
rocket-propelled grenades and anti-aircraft guns as well as armored personnel 
carriers. The ministry said it was taking charge of the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Western estimates said the militia counted 3,000 active members, but could draw 
on reserves of 500,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, East Germany's top lawyer, Wolfgang Vogel, was arrested on 
suspicion of "criminal extortion," the news agency said.

1 IN 7 O.C. HOUSEHOLDS COULD AFFORD OCT. MEDIAN HOME PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the third consecutive month, only one in seven Orange County households 
could afford a house at October's median home price. 
</P>
<P>
That price was $253,034, according to the California Assn. of Realtors. That 
meant a household needed an annual income of $83,657 to afford the monthly 
payments of $2,091, the trade association said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Only 14% of the county's households earn that much or more. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, one in five households in the county could afford a median-priced 
house, which then cost $222,036. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County was not the least affordable of the state's big housing markets 
in October. That honor went again to San Francisco and Ventura County, where 
only 11% of households could afford the median price. That price was $262,271 
in San Francisco and $251,364 in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, 19% of households could afford the median-priced house at $193,557, 
up from 18% in September. 
</P>
<P>
That does not mean a big improvement, however. It merely reflects the fact that 
more homes are being sold in lower-priced markets and that fewer homes are 
being sold in high-priced markets like Orange County, the trade association 
said.

Federal tax officials are investigating whether former President Ronald Reagan 
and his wife owe back taxes from their White House days, particularly on 
expensive gowns borrowed by the First Lady, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither the Internal Revenue Service nor the Reagans' lawyer would 
comment on the inquiry, the Washington Post said it examined documents 
indicating the tax agency has spent considerable time reviewing the couple's 
income tax records. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Reagan's practice of borrowing pricey dresses and jewelry from famous 
designers without reporting the loans as income was part of the investigation, 
the newspaper said, quoting unnamed sources. 
</P>
<P>
It also said a former fashion company executive, who has become a free-lance 
journalist, has been sharing information with the IRS while working on a book 
critical of the Reagans. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said in Los Angeles that the Reagans were out of 
town today and he was unaware whether they had read the newspaper report.

A federal grand jury today indicted two associates of Jim Bakker for lying 
during the PTL fraud investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Johnson, former minister at Heritage Village Church, was charged with 12 
counts of perjury for his testimony about a $10,000 check that was part of 
$265,000 in hush money paid to former church secretary Jessica Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
Evangelist John Wesley Fletcher was charged with one count of perjury for his 
testimony about how Bakker was introduced to Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no further PTL-related indictments coming out of this grand 
jury," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Jerry Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher introduced Bakker to Hahn before their sexual encounter at a Florida 
motel room. Reports that Bakker used ministry funds to pay Hahn to keep quiet 
about the liaison led to Bakker's resignation in March, 1987.

POPE PLEADS FOR RIGHT TO A SAFE ENVIRONMENT

<P>
Pope John Paul II called today for a global commitment to save the Earth from 
ecological devastation and said a safe environment should be part of a new 
Charter of Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
In the first papal document exclusively devoted to ecology, the Pope declared 
that the root cause of environmental problems in industrialized countries was 
greed, selfishness and disregard for nature. 
</P>
<P>
He said the issue "lays bare the depth of man's moral crisis." Its only lasting 
solution was to abandon a life style of "instant gratification." 
</P>
<P>
His remarks were contained in a 12-page message called "Peace with God the 
Creator, Peace with All of Creation," issued for the Roman Catholic Church's 
World Day of Peace Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The message, the Pope's most powerful remarks ever on the environment, included 
issues such as deforestation, fossil fuels, industrial waste and the ozone 
layer. 
</P>
<P>
The yearly peace message, sent to world organizations and heads of state, was 
printed in Russian for the first time. The Pope met Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The pontiff said industrialized countries had no right to demand restrictive 
environmental standards from developing countries unless they first applied 
those standards themselves. 
</P>
<P>
There has been heated debate between advanced countries and the Third World 
over issues such as deforestation and the use of ozone-depleting 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). 
</P>
<P>
Using technical language not usually found in church documents, the Pope said 
the depletion of the ozone layer and the resulting "greenhouse effect" had 
reached crisis proportions because of industrial growth and vastly increased 
energy needs. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that unless there is a halt to the erosion of the ozone layer, 
which filters out the sun's harmful rays, the polar ice caps could melt. 
</P>
<P>
A safe environment "is ever more insistently presented today as a right that 
must be included in an updated Charter of Human Rights," he said in a reference 
to the 40-year-old U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

THATCHER GETS PARTY'S VOTE OF CONFIDENCE; 
</P>
<P>
BRITAIN: THE RESULT FALLS SHORT OF THE OVERWHELMING ENDORSEMENT HER SUPPORTERS 
WERE SEEKING.

<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was confirmed as leader of Britain's 
Conservative Party today, but her support fell short of expectations. She won 
314 of an eligible 374 votes in the party's annual leadership election. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel member of Parliament Sir Anthony Meyer, who challenged Thatcher in 
protest over her opposition to closer integration with Europe, won 33 votes, 
the committee organizing the vote said in a statement. The remaining votes, 
made up of abstentions, spoiled ballots or members of Parliament who failed to 
cast one, were also viewed by party members as counting against the prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
The result was seen as falling short of the overwhelming endorsement Thatcher's 
supporters were hoping for at a time that the ruling Conservatives are trailing 
in opinion polls and the government is being buffeted economically. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome was described as "troublesome" for Thatcher and could open the way 
for a more serious challenge to the prime minister, who does not need to call a 
general election until June, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, 64, has been in office since winning the first of a record three 
successive elections in 1979, and it was the first contested election since 
Thatcher ousted former Prime Minister Edward Heath as leader in 1975. The 
longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th Century, she has said she 
will stay in office by "popular acclaim" as long as voters want her. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the vote, Thatcher told Parliament that she had received a 
telephone call from President Bush to say there was no difference in their 
views on Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Bush told NATO leaders in Brussels on Monday that the United States supports an 
integrated Europe. His remarks were seen in some quarters as a prod to 
Thatcher, who has objected to a common European currency and other aspects of 
unification. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft told reporters that 
Bush reassured Thatcher today that the United States has not changed its 
position about a unified European market. Scowcroft said Bush believes that a 
stronger Europe is good for the United States, but the details and timing of 
the integration are up to the Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher is expected to clash with most of her European partners at an EC 
summit in Strasbourg, France, over the weekend on the pace of economic and 
monetary union.

WHITE HOUSE PLAYS DOWN QUAYLE'S SOVIET COMMENTS

<P>
White House officials scrambled today to reconcile skeptical remarks by Vice 
President Dan Quayle about Soviet foreign policy with President Bush's 
optimistic assessments. "There is no policy difference" between the two, they 
said 
</P>
<P>
"We have an Administration that is very closely aligned, but I think it's 
probably not possible for people to speak literally with one voice, and there 
may be a difference in perspective, but there's no difference with the policies 
we're pursuing," National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle had told the Washington Post that the Kremlin's foreign policy does not 
appear to have changed despite improved relations with the West. 
</P>
<P>
"You're still dealing with a totalitarian government" that wants to "create 
instability" in other nations, Quayle said in the interview published today. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle said he "hadn't seen any evidence of their slackening off" aid to Cuba 
and Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
His comments came a day after Bush returned from his Mediterranean summit 
meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev and said that in view of developments, the 
West must adopt "new thinking" toward the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
"My viewpoint is the new thinking and the real reform is in the area of 
economics. I don't think they've changed much in foreign policy," Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no policy difference" between the two men, Scowcroft said. 
</P>
<P>
He and White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater pointed out that Bush 
remained critical of the Soviet role in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said that Bush and Quayle had discussed the Post interview this 
morning when they met but that Bush "doesn't feel there's any need for 
concern." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle has taken a tougher line in the past in his public comments on the 
Soviet Union than other Administration officials, and the interview contrasted 
with Bush's generally upbeat assessment of the weekend's superpower summit. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle told the Post that the Soviets have "very significant interests beyond 
their borders and those interests create instability. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot count on the Soviets, out of the goodness of their hearts, in 
alleviating those tensions for us." 
</P>
<P>
Though Gorbachev has been very helpful in spurring Communist governments in 
Eastern Europe to reform, "I don't view that as a matter of foreign policy as 
much as domestic policy," Quayle said.

European Community transport ministers today agreed in principle on the basic 
outlines of air transport liberalization between the 12 member states by Jan. 
1, 1993, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that today we see a major breakthrough toward the liberalization of 
air transport," Sir Leon Brittan, EC Commission vice president in charge of 
competition, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Brittan said that the ministers after a two-day session adopted "a pilot 
package" but that there will be further evolution in the future. 
</P>
<P>
He said the package applies "pressure toward lower fares and a wider choice for 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
The EC Commission has been trying for a long time to break up the monopolies of 
state-run or state-protected airlines in the community that agreed among them 
on fares and distribution of routes.

IBM TO PARE 10,000 JOBS, TAKE A MASSIVE 4TH-QUARTER CHARGE;

International Business Machines Corp., hurt by product delays and rising 
competition, said today it will eliminate 10,000 jobs without layoffs by the 
end of 1990 and take a huge, $2.3-billion charge in the fourth quarter for 
cost-cutting and other measures to raise profits. 
</P>
<P>
The giant computer company also said at an analysts' meeting in New York that 
its board had authorized spending up to $4 billion to buy back its shares. 
</P>
<P>
"The actions we are describing today underscore our ongoing resolve to make IBM 
the most competitive information processing business in an industry that 
continues to grow," said IBM Chairman John Akers. 
</P>
<P>
Shares of IBM rose in active trading today following the announcement. IBM was 
up $1.25 at $100.50 on heavy volume. 
</P>
<P>
Akers told analysts that the staff reductions would cut IBM's domestic work 
force by at least 10,000 people to 206,000 by the end of 1990, a reduction of 
more than 37,000 employees from 1985 levels. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts would be achieved through restricted hiring and increased attrition at 
nearly every IBM location in the United States, said chief financial officer 
Frank Metz. 
</P>
<P>
Severance pay of one week's pay for every six months of service, up to a 
maximum of 52 weeks' pay, will be offered to those who choose to leave, Metz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The severance pay allocations would total about $500 million, which is part of 
the fourth-quarter charge. 
</P>
<P>
The company also said that "consolidations and capacity reductions at some U.S. 
locations" are being implemented to increase efficiency. It did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
IBM had been expected to take actions to reduce its costs after product delays 
and rising competition hurt 1989 profits. Its third-quarter per-share earnings 
fell sharply to $1.51 from $2.10 a year earlier, due partly to a delay in 
introducing a disk storage device. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street had speculated for several weeks that IBM was considering some sort 
of program to pare its worldwide work force of 387,000. The company has a 
longstanding policy of no forced layoffs, which IBM officials said was still in 
force. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts had said Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM would either need to boost 
revenues significantly above current levels of slightly over $60 billion or cut 
costs substantially to raise profits. 
</P>
<P>
Akers said the fourth-quarter pretax charge of $2.3 billion will cut IBM's 
after-tax profits by $2.25 a share, and would reduce costs and expenses 
starting next year by about $1 billion. The cost savings, he said, would add 
about $1 to its per-share profits in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Chief financial officer Metz said the $2.3-billion pretax charge includes 
actions to recover software and technology investments of about $500 million, 
$1.3 billion for plant consolidations and reduced operations and adjustments in 
the value of special investments. 
</P>
<P>
The new stock repurchase program will bring the company's total stock purchases 
since 1986 to $10.5 billion or about 15% of shares outstanding at that time.

Corning Inc. will receive $25 million from Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. as 
part of an out-of-court settlement of a 1984 patent infringement lawsuit, the 
companies announced today. 
</P>

Corning sued Sumitomo five years ago, alleging that the Japanese company had 
violated its patents for optical waveguide fibers, thin hair-like strands of 
glass that are used for telephone, video and data transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York agreed with 
Corning that Sumitomo had infringed on Corning's patents when it began 
manufacturing its own fibers. 
</P>

The court was in the process of determining damages when the settlement was

The U.S. commodity trade house Philipp Brothers Inc., known as Phibro, was 
expelled from the French cocoa trade association today, dealing the firm 
another setback in its bid to become the world's largest cocoa trader. 
</P>
<P>
Phibro, a unit of brokerage powerhouse Salomon Inc., was banished from the AFCC 
because it missed a Dec. 4 deadline for paying compensation to the 
International Cocoa Organization and five trade competitors, the organization 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
The AFCC had ordered the compensation, estimated to total at least $4.7 
million, after Phibro failed to deliver cocoa to the ICO and the trade houses 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Cocoa traders said the expulsion would have little immediate practical impact 
on Phibro. But they said it would tarnish the firm's image and perhaps damage 
its relations with Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer and a former 
French colony.

Lumber giant Georgia-Pacific Corp. said today that it extended its $3.6-billion 
offer for paper maker Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. to Dec. 11 from Monday, when 
the offer had been scheduled to expire. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta-based company, whose offer has been rejected by Great Northern, 
also said that as of Monday, 32,319,729 shares or nearly 59% of Great 
Northern's stock had been tendered. 
</P>
<P>
"That is a very substantial percentage, and we believe the shareholders are 
sending the clear message to Great Northern's board and management that they 
want our offer to be accepted," T. Marshall Hahn Jr., Georgia-Pacific's 
chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia-Pacific's initial bid of $58 a share, or $3.19 billion, was made Oct. 
31. The company sweetened its cash offer to $63 a share Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Great Northern's stock traded at $61.50 at midday today, up 12.5 cents.

Transport Ministry officials will ask Japanese car makers to pay more attention 
to design and quality control because of defects found in new and remodeled 
cars recently, a ministry official said today. 
</P>
<P>
The officials will issue the request at a regularly scheduled meeting with the 
heads of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Assn. on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Since April 1, 11 Japanese models and 14 foreign models have been recalled 
because of defects. This compares with 15 Japanese models and 24 foreign models 
in the year to March 31, 1989, the Transport Ministry official said. 
</P>
<P>
Daihatsu Motor Co. Ltd. has recalled its new Applause model four-door sedans 
twice this year due to defects, first in October and then in November. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 12, the ministry gave Toyota Motor Corp. a written warning, the first 
strong warning the ministry has issued to a Japanese car maker in 11 years, 
over the car maker's delay in informing it of a defect affecting almost 200,000 
cars, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Toyota recalled all 8,000 of its new Lexus LS 400 luxury cars to 
make three repairs. (Story, D2)

"The Cosby Show" recovered from its Thanksgiving ratings blues and took over 
first place on the Nielsen charts last week, relegating ABC's "Roseanne" to 
fourth place, it was reported today. It was the highest-rated "Cosby" of the 
season, which was important to NBC because the network was using "Cosby" as a 
lead-in to launch its new "Ann Jillian" show. 
</P>
<P>
"Cosby" has been the No. 1 show for four of the last five weeks. The exception 
was last week, when Thanksgiving cut down the "Cosby" numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"Ann Jillian" in its regular Sunday night time slot did not fare as well, 
coming in 52nd. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CBS announced today that Angela Lansbury, star of the highly rated 
series "Murder, She Wrote," will return for a seventh season as Jessica 
Fletcher. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Springer, president of the CBS Broadcast Group, said that in addition, 
Lansbury's production company, Corymore Productions Inc., will develop another 
series for CBS for the 1990-91 season.

ABC will add "America's Funniest Home Videos" and "Father Dowling Mysteries" to 
its schedule, dropping "Living Dolls" and "Homeroom" and temporarily shelving 
"Mr. Belvedere," it was announced today. 
</P>
<P>
"America's Funniest Home Videos," which is just what it sounds -- a collection 
of amateur efforts from around the country -- aired as an ABC special Nov. 26 
and tied for ninth place in the Sunday ratings. 
</P>
<P>
It will become a half-hour prime-time series starting Jan. 14, 8-8:30 p.m., 
bumping the present occupant of that time period, "Free Spirit," into the 
8:30-9 p.m. slot. "Free Spirit" will dump "Homeroom," which goes off the air 
with its last scheduled broadcast Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
"Father Dowling Mysteries," a Fred Silverman production that last year appeared 
on NBC, will premiere Jan. 4 at 8-9 p.m. The present occupant of the time slot, 
"Mission Impossible," moves to Saturday, 8-9 p.m., as of Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Belvedere" will go on hiatus, and "Living Dolls" will go off permanently 
after Dec. 30.

ZSA ZSA AVOIDS JAIL CELL FOR NOW WHILE SHE APPEALS CONVICTION

A Municipal Court judge today put a hold on actress Zsa Zsa Gabor's 72-hour 
jail sentence and fines totaling $2,937 while she appeals her misdemeanor 
cop-slapping conviction. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Charles G. Rubin refused to delay the 120 hours of community service, 
a psychiatric evaluation and $10,000 restitution to the Police Department that 
he ordered during Gabor's sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it clear Miss Gabor still has to do her community service, pay 
her restitution . . . ," Rubin told defense attorney Harrison Bull during a 
short hearing that the flamboyant actress did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, 72, was originally ordered to go to jail before Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Bull said outside court that he had advised Gabor not to show up at any future 
court dates unless she is needed. He said Gabor had already begun one part of 
her sentence by doing community service work at a Venice women's shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor was arrested when she slapped Officer Paul Kramer on June 14 in an 
altercation after he pulled her Rolls-Royce over because its registration tags 
were expired. 
</P>
<P>
A jury convicted her on Sept. 29 of misdemeanor battery on a police officer, 
driving without a valid driver's license and having an open container of 
alcohol in her car.

Playboy Magazine today published a special edition featuring founder Hugh 
Hefner's bride spread across 97 pages in various stages of undress. "Just in 
time for holiday gift-giving," said the magazine in announcing the publication. 
Kimberley Conrad, the 26-year-old blonde from Vancouver, Canada, who became the 
63-year-old Hefner's wife in June, has had previous Playboy exposure. She was 
on the cover in August, 1988, the same year she was featured as "Miss January."

Five families who live without electricity near Ted Turner's 8,100-acre 
plantation say they want the broadcasting executive to allow power lines to 
cross his property to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Dressie Sloan of the Jefferson County National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People accused Turner of trying to get rid of his poor neighbors by 
refusing to extend the electric lines. 
</P>
<P>
"One word from Mr. Turner, and they'd have their lights," Sloan told the 
Tallahassee Democrat on Sunday. But Avalon Plantation Manager George Purvis 
said Turner was only complying with a former owner's restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Turner has never tried to get those people to move out," Purvis told the 
newspaper. "But Mrs. (Alexandra) McKay thought an above-ground wire would 
destroy the national beauty of her land." 
</P>
<P>
But even if Turner did approve the extension, Purvis said he wondered who would 
foot the bill. A power line from the plantation's terminal to the houses would 
cost at least $40,000, according to a manager for Tri-County Electric 
Cooperative.

Rookie quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver will get another start for the San Diego 
Chargers next weekend when they play the Washington Redskins, Coach Dan Henning 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Henning also said Monday that he has not considered whether Tolliver will start 
San Diego's final two games. The Chargers play at Kansas City on Dec. 17 and 
end their season at home Dec. 24 against Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"The main idea is to win football games and at the same time find out as much 
about players as you possibly can," Henning said. "In both games that Billy's 
been in, he's done some things you would expect from a rookie. He's also made 
some plays. The results haven't been a lot different from some of our other 
games." 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver made his second start of the season Sunday in the Chargers' 20-17 loss 
to the New York Jets.

PLEA: SEED ENGLAND TO CURB FAN VIOLENCE

<P>
The Italian and British governments, concerned about the British fans' 
reputation for violence, have put strong pressure on the international soccer 
federation to have England seeded for the World Cup, FIFA Secretary General 
Sepp Blatter said today. 
</P>
<P>
If seeded, England could be sent to Cagliari, the capital of the island of 
Sardinia, where authorities believe it would be easier to control its fans, who 
have spread violence all over Europe during club or national team games. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to listen to what the governments say and we cannot ignore their 
positions," Blatter said. "FIFA's main concern is to organize a good World Cup 
and to have it run as smooth and as quiet as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The logistics of getting to the island should help. 
</P>
<P>
"English fans can travel to Sardinia only by boat or plane," Luca di 
Montezemolo, general manager of the cup organizing committee, said. "It is very 
hard for them to get to Cagliari by car, bus or motorcycle, and this means they 
will not be able to move around freely once on the island." 
</P>
<P>
FIFA sources indicated that a majority of the 25-member commission that will 
designate the six seeded teams for the 1990 Cup are in favor of including 
England instead of Spain in the list. 
</P>
<P>
The decision on seeding England has been a key issue for weeks and it reached a 
climax in Rome this week. The FIFA commission will have to name the six seeds 
on Thursday, two days before the draw for all 24 teams in next summer's 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The World Cup will be played in 12 Italian cities from June 8 to July 8. 
</P>
<P>
"We have met with British and Italian government officials and with the 
organizers of the 1990 Cup," Blatter said. "They all agree that if England were 
to play its three first-round games in Cagliari it would be easier to control 
the fans. 
</P>
<P>
"We, too, at FIFA understand their point, and we acknowledge that security is a 
prime factor in soccer today. But it is not the only factor, and the commission 
will have to weigh all of them when it meets for a decision."

A convicted burglar has told National Collegiate Athletic Assn. investigators 
about alleged improprieties that continued in the University of Oklahoma's 
football program after it was placed on probation late last year, the Dallas 
Morning News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
If Oklahoma's football program is found guilty of major violations, the Sooners 
could face the so-called "death penalty," the suspension of the football 
program for up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
In a copyright story, the Dallas newspaper reported that NCAA investigators are 
checking several potentially damaging allegations about the university made by 
Otha Armstrong III, 24, a convicted burglar and longtime friend of former 
Oklahoma quarterback Charles Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
University President Richard Van Horn said in a statement issued in Norman, 
Okla., today that the university does not believe Armstrong's allegations.

The Penguins fired General Manager Tony Esposito and Coach Gene Ubriaco today 
and hired Craig Patrick, the former New York Rangers executive, as Esposito's 
replacement and interim coach. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel very confident Craig Patrick will be able to lead this team in the 
direction we would like to see it go," Eddie DeBartolo Jr., son of Penguins 
owner Edward DeBartolo, said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Esposito was in his second year, and Ubriaco, a former minor league coach and 
longtime Esposito friend, was hired last season. He was the third coach in 
three years for the Penguins, in fifth place in the Patrick Division at 
10-14-2. 
</P>
<P>
This time last year, the Penguins were 10-11-5 but reached the Patrick Division 
finals, where they lost to Philadelphia in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Martha, Penguins' general counsel who ran the franchise until Esposito was 
hired, said disgruntled Penguins fans asked the DeBartolo family to make some 
changes to turn around the struggling franchise. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people were calling Youngstown," where the DeBartolo family is based, 
Martha said. "Obviously, there was a lot of unrest among the fans." 
</P>
<P>
Martha said the DeBartolos began discussing the need for a change about six 
weeks ago but only recently decided to fire Esposito and Ubriaco. 
</P>
<P>
He said the owners were disappointed with the team's lack of effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected more from our players, and over and over again we didn't get it," 
he said. "The players voiced concern about that themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick is a member of the Patrick family, for which the NHL's Patrick Division 
is named. He was the vice president and general manager of the Rangers from 
1980 to 1986, when the team made the playoffs every season and reached the 
semifinals twice. 
</P>
<P>
He played for Calgary, St. Louis, Kansas City, Minnesota and Washington during 
his eight-year NHL playing career. 
</P>
<P>
The last two years he has been director of athletics and recreation for the 
University of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick said the Penguins first contacted him two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't sure just how serious they were. I didn't know what to expect. 
Nothing really happened" until Monday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he wants to look at his staff and players before he names a new coach.
