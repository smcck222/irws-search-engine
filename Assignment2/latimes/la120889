MEDFLY SPRAYING CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having been in the nursery industry for 30-plus years, I have had more than a 
passing interest in the media's coverage of the latest efforts to eliminate the 
widespread Medfly infestations in Southern California. The news media as a 
whole, including your newspaper, have contributed to the public's concerns and 
fears of the chemical malathion. It is disturbing to me to have reporters 
interview citizens about their concerns over increased aerial sprayings, 
inferring it is the malathion that may damage their possessions. The fact that 
the molasses bait is the casual agent seems to be neglected or overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
Malathion has long been the plant protection chemical recommended for the 
control of a host of chewing and sucking insects in home gardens. For instance, 
when aphids attack your rosebushes, you mix a few tablespoons of malathion in a 
sprayer and saturate the plants. This takes place on quarter-acre properties. 
For the aerial sprayings, less than 3 ounces of malathion are used to cover an 
acre! This isn't any stronger than the spray used on roses. 
</P>
<P>
During a previous Medfly outbreak, when aerial sprayings of malathion were made 
in East Los Angeles, Latinos were widely quoted as saying, "If this was Beverly 
Hills they wouldn't be spraying us." I submit that Beverly Hills has had more 
malathion sprayed within its city limits than any other community, because the 
affluent homeowners there employ professional gardeners who have used malathion 
to control insects in home gardens -- for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, we know malathion is effective, but is it safe? There have been so many 
conflicting stories generated by the media of late it should be apparent this 
safety question won't be resolved soon. The media quote one expert, then seek 
out another to refute or challenge the first person's opinion. The media have 
perpetuated the question of malathion's safety -- and fostered or substantiated 
citizens' fears -- with the practice of pitting "expert" vs. "expert."

<P>
We would like to protest the pesticide spraying of residential areas of Los 
Angeles County. We would strongly like to protest the silence of our elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
We realize that this is a serious economic problem for the Department of 
Agriculture, but the bottom line is which is more important -- people or fruit. 
Right now, money and fruit are winning because our elected officials will not 
protect their people. (How many of these officials live in the areas being 
sprayed?) 
</P>
<P>
We feel that with some creative thinking (and money) there are other ways of 
handling the problem on the ground. (Why are peddlers freely allowed to sell 
bags of fruit to drivers on our roads, year after year?) 
</P>
<P>
Please remember that the same experts who are telling us that malathion (not 
fully tested) is safe, are the same ones who assured us that DDT, asbestos, 
dioxin, PCBs etc. were all safe. JOAN P. CANNON

Please allay the worries of the people under the spray for the Medfly. 
Malathion was chosen as the ideal insecticide for control of mosquitoes in the 
city of New Orleans in 1965. Assuming the formula hasn't been altered, it is 
quite harmless. 
</P>
<P>
I flew the stuff for seven years over the suburbs of New Orleans on an almost 
daily basis and have heard nothing of harm to humans or pets. Please halt this 
unseemly panic by the citizens of Los Angeles County. It is not worth thinking 
about. 
</P>
<P>
We used the chemical in the strength of 4% on a routine basis. The application 
was constantly monitored by the health department and we, in the crews who 
handled this stuff, were subjected to monthly blood tests which were found to 
be negative in all those years. 
</P>
<P>
Stamp out the Medfly with confidence and impunity.

As I lie here in bed listening to the malathion-spraying helicopters flying low 
overhead, I can't help thinking: How ironic it is that with all the concern for 
and pains taken to preserve the thousands of forms of animal life, from the 
huge elephant to the tiny insect in some remote desert pond, we meet with only 
limited success. 
</P>
<P>
Yet when we reverse the procedure and attempt to exterminate one member of the 
animal kingdom (i.e., the Medfly) we find it near impossible.

EAST GERMANY: IMPATIENT WITH POLITICIANS OF EVERY STRIPE, THE PEOPLE ARE 
STARTING TO SEE REUNIFICATION AS A SHORT CUT TO DEMOCRACY AND PROSPERITY.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In East Germany, the party's over -- the Communist Party. Egon Krenz, the 
communist leader, had opened the Berlin Wall to gain a breathing space in which 
to regain some sense of credibility with his people. Instead, Krenz's hoped-for 
breathing space has become his last gasp. Reforms were not forthcoming; the 
regime seemed to dodder from one challenge of crisis management to the next. 
The verdict of the East German people was swift: You can't teach old Stalinists 
new tricks. Krenz and his associates are being swept away. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party has had the wind knocked out of it by the furious force of 
retribution coming from the streets. It is now crumbling in a fit of 
self-incrimination. Krenz's predecessor, Erich Honecker, and his cronies have 
been expelled from the party and are under criminal investigation. Some have 
been arrested. Krenz is likely to be a target of investigations as well. A new 
Communist Party, perhaps with a new name, will be shaped by radical grass-roots 
reformers. But they, too, will become increasingly irrelevant to the forces of 
change in Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The power of the people has also surprised much of the opposition. Those 
political activists who sponsored East Germany's gentle revolution had been so 
engaged because they dreamed of creating an East German alternative to West 
German capitalism and Stalinist socialism. Yet they have been hampered by a 
lack of economic competence and political organization. The so-called bloc 
parties have also been slow to emerge from the shadow of communist co-optation 
in which they operated for 40 years. As a result, a political vacuum has 
appeared in which the grass-roots call for German reunification is growing. The 
political agenda is being set on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Disillusioned by the extent of criminal corruption within the party and the 
state apparatus, demoralized by revelations about the true state of the 
economy, and casting an apprehensive glance at the economic catastrophe 
afflicting other reformist states in Eastern Europe, the East German people are 
now looking hard for a short cut to prosperity and democracy. A growing number 
believe that short cut could be reunification. 
</P>
<P>
Reunification as reform will be the dominating topic in the next four weeks in 
both German states. Although East German political activists have not stressed 
the issue, the silent majority within the population has found its voice and is 
quickly pushing reunification to the top of the political agenda. Watch for the 
time when East German demonstrators change their current slogan, "we are the 
people" to "we are one people." 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the Communist Party last weekend has compressed the timetable 
for change. New elections are now proposed for May, rather than next fall, as 
had been anticipated. The debate on whether reunification is the best route to 
reform will become furious as new political parties seek to capture the issue 
for themselves. The best-organized opposition group, the Democratic Awakening, 
has already responded to the public mood by being the first major political 
grouping to openly support reunification. They have approved of West German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's plan for reunification, calling it "worthy of 
consideration." 
</P>
<P>
If the question of reunification is postponed and the pace of reform falters, 
many East Germans will opt to wait it out in West Germany, rather than suffer 
through the transition in East Germany. The result could be an outflow of 
people from a reforming East Germany that equals or exceeds the earlier outflow 
from an unreformed East Germany. East Germans are impatient for change; more 
are coming to believe that the prospect of German-German reassociation leading 
to reunification could spare them the pain of reform currently suffered by the 
Hungarians and the Poles. 
</P>
<P>
The urge for reform has been further accelerated by events in neighboring 
Czechoslovakia. It was in fact the Czech decision last Wednesday to abolish the 
constitutionally enshrined leading role of the Communist Party that prompted 
the crisis in East Germany over the weekend. In November, the wave of reform in 
East Germany triggered change in Czechoslovakia. Today, the momentum in each 
country has become mutually reinforcing, leading to a whirlwind of change that 
is sweeping through both countries with breathtaking speed -- and is completely 
out of the hands of governments and diplomatic officials. 
</P>
<P>
Reforms in Eastern Europe are now far outpacing reforms in the Soviet Union. 
The dynamic of change has shifted decisively to the smaller Warsaw Pact states. 
Mikhail Gorbachev facilitated these changes, but is he prepared for the impact 
that East European reforms are now likely to have on his own domestic 
situation? As East and West build down the division of Europe, a new division 
is appearing in the East: the gap between the tumultuous changes in Eastern 
Europe and the striking, yet suddenly less revolutionary -- and less successful 
-- reforms in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
There is great cause for euphoria in Europe today. There is also substantial 
cause for concern.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA: THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS MAY LOOK LIKE A RAGTAG CREW 
TODAY. BUT TOMORROW THEY WILL BE READY TO GOVERN.

You look at them on your TV screen and wonder: Is it possible that these people 
could govern Czechoslovakia? 
</P>
<P>
True, there is one familiar face and name. He wears a suit and tie. He is 
Alexander Dubcek, leader of the 1968 Prague Spring, whose search for "socialism 
with a human face" preceded Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika and glasnost by 
many years. 
</P>
<P>
Before Dubcek showed up at Prague's Wenceslas Square late last month to address 
hundreds of thousands of his countrymen, he had not been seen for years. Today, 
he is an anachronism -- a reform-minded Communist in an anti-communist land. 
Still, Dubcek is destined to serve initially as the country's ceremonial 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Dubcek, there are others -- parties and individuals unknown in the West 
but well-known in Czechoslovakia -- who are rapidly changing their political 
color to suit the new popular mood. Allied with and subservient to the 
Communists for decades, the Socialist Party and the People's Party are now 
presenting themselves as a non-communist alternative to the old and discredited 
regime. Yet these allegedly non-communist leaders are tainted; their parties 
would have to be fundamentally transformed before they are accepted by the 
Czechoslovak people. 
</P>
<P>
Take Bohuslav Kucera, chairman of the Socialist Party. He has been a highly 
visible and vocal supporter of the post-1968 political order. In recent years, 
he served as deputy chairman of the Federal Assembly, deputy chairman of the 
Legislative Council, chairman of the European Security and Cooperation 
Committee of Czechoslovakia, chairman of the Czechoslovak-Belgian Friendship 
Society as well as being a member of the Presidium of the Czechoslovak National 
Front. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer by training and an intelligent man, Kucera was the ultimate fellow 
traveler. He showed up at diplomatic receptions and presented himself to 
Western visitors to demonstrate that non-communist politicians fared well in 
"people's Czechoslovakia." Will he now retain his positions? Perhaps with his 
encouragement, his party has made its facilities available to opposition 
forces. Some of the recent speeches shown on TV were made from the balcony of 
the Socialist Party. But Kucera's ability to stay near the center of power in a 
democratic Czechoslovakia is highly doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
The new leaders of this wonderful country in the heart of Europe are likely to 
be those unshaven and casually dressed people seen on TV -- mainly young, 
politically astute but inexperienced, and long dismissed as insignificant 
troublemakers by propagandists of the old regime. They kept their faith in 
jail. They kept their faith while in hiding. They kept their faith when their 
books, papers and typewriters were taken away and when their telephones were 
disconnected. And they kept their faith for two long decades after '68, when a 
largely apathetic public stayed away from the political limelight. While most 
of Czechoslovakia slept, they were awake. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of European political categories, some of them define themselves as 
Social Democrats, some as Christian Democrats, some simply as Western-type 
liberals or conservatives. They are still united because the main issues -- 
removal of the country's Communist leadership and the creation of a democratic 
political order -- unite them. But when elections come in 1990, the struggle 
for power and position will begin. Personal rivalries will surface. That 
appealing sense of camaraderie will fade. Something will be lost, but something 
more will have been gained: normalcy will have returned to Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
The men who are trusted today by the people are not professional politicians. 
Vaclav Havel, the courageous leader of Civic Forum, is a playwright whose works 
have not been performed in his native land for decades. Jiri Dienstbier, the 
forum's very wise spokesman, is a journalist who had to make a living as a 
stoker. Jan Urban, who speaks several languages, is also a journalist working 
(when out of jail) for Western publications. 
</P>
<P>
Some day soon they will get haircuts and trade their bluejeans in for suites, 
and they will begin to govern. 
</P>
<P>
Recall that before he became the gray eminence of Polish politics, Lech Walesa 
was an electrician. In Hungary, the leaders of the new non-communist parties 
campaigning for elections next March are just beginning to look and act like 
the professional politicians they have so quickly become. 
</P>
<P>
There is little left of the simple dichotomy between "us" and "them," the time 
when people could be easily divided into those who sought freedom and those who 
defended communism is all but gone. The topics of today are parliamentary 
procedures, or the privatization of the economy. Increasingly, the main issue 
is not even how to gain power but how to use it once gained. 
</P>
<P>
Bluejeans or not, in Eastern Europe, at long last, the times they are a 
changin'.

There's a perhaps apocryphal story of a high-level Soviet official pleading 
with an American religious society to send Bibles to the Soviet Union. It seems 
that research on the characteristics of efficient factories had found in them a 
high percentage of serious Christian workers who were honest, came to work on 
time, were sober and generally gave a full day's work for their pay. Intrigued 
by this, the researchers pressed further. These Christians, they found, were 
guided by a code called "The Ten Commandments," found in the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Gorbachev himself seems to be a recent convert to the social utility of 
religion. In promising to relax oppressive restrictions on religion, he almost 
paraphrased our own George Washington's opinion that religion and morality are 
the twin pillars of healthy national life. Other Communist leaders of the East 
Bloc are offering similar opinions and making similar moves. The leaders who 
once condemned religion for being an opiate that diverted the attention of 
workers from unjust social conditions are now intent on using religion to 
rescue their societies from calamity. 
</P>
<P>
Will such a strategy work? Or is it an opiate of the leaders themselves, 
diverting their attention from other, less "socially useful," effects of 
religion? 
</P>
<P>
There is a great likelihood of major religious renewals in the Eastern Bloc 
countries. The human spirit's aspiration for transcendent truth has been 
bottled up for decades by ideological and social practices that have attempted 
to reduce the human horizon to a drab one-dimensionality. The religious bodies 
that have resisted this pressure and kept the faith have gained enormous 
respect from the people and now offer them a liberating alternative to a failed 
Marxist vision. Catholics in Poland and Hungary, the Eastern Orthodox in Russia 
and Lutherans in East Germany have remained credible islands of moral and 
spiritual transcendence in a flat sea of state-enforced materialism. Indeed, it 
seems as if the non-coerced materialism of the West is far more lethal to 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt these revivals will produce more productive citizens. The Soviet 
"researchers" were right. Religious renewal will strengthen the moral fiber 
that holds together marriage, family, workplace, voluntary association and, 
yes, even the nation. But the essence of religion is that it marches to the 
beat of a different drummer. Authentic religion "obeys no other God." It shapes 
a morality not in order to be socially useful to the state, though it may in 
fact be so, but rather to become obedient to God. Further, obedience to God 
does not end with private, personal morality. It extends, as indeed the 
prophets extended it, to the public life of the society. The prophetic call for 
justice is discomforting to every nation. 
</P>
<P>
Among Eastern European peoples, particularly the Poles and the Ukrainians, this 
prophetic impulse is closely intertwined with aspirations for national 
self-determination. Religious fervor will intensify the nationalism of those 
peoples and provide a volatile mixture that should awaken Communist leaders 
from their drugged illusions about the irenic qualities of religion. 
</P>
<P>
Religion at its best, however, maintains a distance from every national 
movement or achievement, lest it be reduced to a sacred tool for secular 
purposes. It presses for justice and peace within nations, as has already been 
demonstrated by the long-standing peace movement among East German Christians. 
The nascent ecological movements in several East Bloc countries are led by 
Christians. Human-rights activists are likewise drawn heavily from religious 
communities, particularly Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
Religion is a source of discontent in all societies because it operates from a 
frame of reference that transcends earthly accomplishment. This has been borne 
out not only in communist societies but in every society where human 
possibilities are severely repressed. Witness the role of religion in Central 
America, the Philippines and the Islamic countries. 
</P>
<P>
All of this should not prompt too much celebration among those of us in the 
"successful" West. The "victory" of democratic capitalist ideas should be 
greeted by no more than one cheer. For the moral foundations of the West, which 
make both democracy and capitalism viable, are eroding. We will need as much 
religious renewal in the long run as the East Bloc needs right now. We will all 
need a measure of what the Russians call dukhovnost -- the spiritual life of 
the people.

EL SALVADOR: THE ARREST OF CHURCHWOMAN JENNIFER CASOLO IS A NAKED ATTEMPT, 
AFTER THE MURDERS OF SIX PRIESTS, TO INFLUENCE THE UNITED STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
To kill priests and church workers is no longer enough in El Salvador. To 
discredit those who are alive is seen as more effective. 
</P>
<P>
Churchwoman Jennifer Casolo, accused by the Salvadoran military of storing arms 
for the rebels in the yard of the house she rented in San Salvador, is the 
coordinator of Christian Education Seminars and a chief organizer of U.S. 
congressional and church tours of El Salvador. She is innocent of the 
outrageous accusations, which constitute another example of the judicial farce 
known as the Salvadoran justice system. Prosecutors cannot even decide under 
which law to charge Casolo. 
</P>
<P>
But why is she so important? 
</P>
<P>
People on the Christian Education delegations could see for themselves the 
poverty, hunger and destitution of El Salvador and conclude that its current 
problems go far beyond a struggle for political power. Casolo provided speakers 
who represented both sides in the civil war, and her educational tours included 
talks with government, army and opposition officials. 
</P>
<P>
For many people these tour-seminars have been the turning point in 
understanding U.S. involvement in the civil war, which currently costs the 
United States $1.4 million a day in military aid sent to prop up a weak 
government bent on war. Delegates came to realize that humanitarian aid must 
take precedence and that U.S. involvement should be a force for a negotiated 
political solution. In short, the message the delegates brought home is that 
the status quo in El Salvador is no longer acceptable; change is mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
Polls indicate that most Americans do not support U.S. military involvement in 
El Salvador. Much of the credit for this belief goes to the eyewitness reports 
from church observers. Thus Casolo's arrest is not meant simply to stop the 
delegations from arriving. It is a concerted and symbolic message that attacks 
the credibility of the church's honest attempt to assess the civil war as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
For those laboring in church work, there is another parallel. This week marks 
the ninth anniversary of the murders of U.S. missionaries Maura Clarke, Jean 
Donovan, Ita Ford and Dorothy Kazel. In 1980 these brutal murders rallied 
American citizens to argue and win in Congress a temporary halt to U.S. 
military assistance to El Salvador. It is difficult to discredit dead 
churchwomen. One live churchwoman allegedly caught with arms for the guerrillas 
sows seeds of doubt in the minds of the American public. 
</P>
<P>
So now in 1989 we have before us six dead Jesuits, their housekeeper and her 
young daughter -- and one live, discredited churchwoman. Which church message 
will the American public believe? Each time new martyrs are created, U.S. 
policy is questioned. However, each time church workers are described as 
leftist subversives, U.S. opinion shifts. This is a sinister and despicable 
ploy on the part of the Salvadoran government. 
</P>
<P>
For that government, winning its war is not simply controlling the capital, but 
winning votes in Washington. Many of these votes are based on the credibility 
of the church's message. 
</P>
<P>
Last month the barbaric murders of the six Jesuits and two women rallied 
American churches to demand a halt to military aid to El Salvador. The 
congressional vote to cut aid was 194 in favor and 215 against, with 24 not 
voting. This was a close call for a Congress in a frenzy to pass a huge 
appropriations budget and in a rush to recess for the holidays.

It does not take much to realize that the balance of power is in the non-voting 
members of Congress. When they reconvene in January, how will those 24 cast 
their votes? Will they listen to the authentic message of the churches, which 
are saying "no more military aid to El Salvador"? Or will they fall for the 
false image created by the Salvadoran government, of an allegedly discredited 
churchwoman?

NBA ROUNDUP;

WILLIAMS THE REBOUNDER GIVES BLAZERS A SCORER, TOO

The Portland Trail Blazers acquired Buck Williams in a trade with New Jersey 
last summerbecause they needed inside strength. 
</P>
<P>
The rugged 6-8 power forward was asked to provide rebounding and toughness. 
Anything else was merely a bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Williams not only has provided the rebounding, he has given them some excellent 
shooting, too. Thursday night at Charlotte, Williams missed only two of 13 
shots, scored 23 points and had 17 rebounds to lead the Trail Blazers to a 
96-86 victory over the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Williams replacing Caldwell Jones at power forward, the Trail 
Blazers have the same lineup they had last season. How important is Williams? 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Portland was 10-9 after 19 games. Now, they are 15-4, the 
second-best record in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been just what we needed inside," Coach Rick Adelman said. "His 
shooting has been a big plus." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, eighth in the league in rebounding with a 10.5 average, is shooting 
almost 54% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Drexler led all scorers with 25 points as the Trail Blazers sent the 
Hornets down to their sixth consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is largely responsible for the Trail Blazers being the best rebounding 
team in the NBA. They easily dominated the Hornets, 51-33, getting 18 offensive 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm enjoying playing with a winner," Williams said. "My job is simple. I'm 
here to get the rebounds. If they need scoring, I'm ready to lend a hand." 
</P>
<P>
Utah 107, Dallas 97 -- Karl Malone continued his hot shooting at Salt Lake City 
and the Jazz took over first place in the Midwest Division. 
</P>
<P>
Malone had 31 points, and John Stockton had 22 points and 13 assists. The Jazz 
built a 13-point lead after three quarters and coasted to their third win in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz, 3-3 on the road, are 8-2 at home and lead San Antonio by a half game. 
</P>
<P>
Malone has scored 20 or more points in 16 consecutive games. DAN HAFNER

Does this sound like a coach's dream? 
</P>
<P>
Dean Smith: "It's a big joke . . . our schedule already was too tough." 
</P>
<P>
John Thompson: "I'm not for it and I've said it all along." 
</P>
<P>
What North Carolina Coach Smith and Georgetown Coach Thompson were talking 
about was their matchup Thursday night in the inaugural ACC-Big East Challenge, 
an eight-game matchup of two of the toughest conferences in the country, which 
wound up at four victories apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Tillmon scored 27 points to lead the No. 3 to victory over the No. 17 Tar 
Heels, 93-81, in the final game of the tournament at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first meeting between the team's since the Tar Heels beat 
Georgetown, 63-62, on Michael Jordan's jumper in the 1982 NCAA championship 
game at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown (4-0) held a comfortable lead throughout the second half, and North 
Carolina (4-3) never got closer than five points in the final five minutes. 
Virginia 73, Villanova 65 -- John Crotty scored 25 points and Virginia (5-1) 
beat Villanova at East Rutherford. Virginia grabbed the lead for good at 62-60 
with 5:45 to play on a three-point shot by Crotty. Although Virginia had one 
more field goal the rest of the way, Villanova (4-3) had only two. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia's last field goal, a rebound follow by Bryant Stith, gave the 
Cavaliers a 64-60 lead with 4:34 left. Greg Woodard hit a long jump shot for 
Villanova (4-3) 22 seconds later, but Cavaliers made nine of 12 free throws to 
preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
No. 19 North Carolina St. 126, Duquesne 77 -- Chris Corchiani and Brian Howard 
scored six points each in a 22-0 first-half run that powered North Carolina 
State to victory at Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Monroe scored 22 points as North Carolina State placed six players in 
double figures. Iowa 89, Iowa State 87 -- Ray Thompson, who lost his starting 
job after being arrested last week, scored 20 of his 32 points in the second 
half to rally unbeaten Iowa at Ames. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa, which trailed by 17 points early in the second half, withstood a 36-point 
effort by Iowa State's Terry Woods. 
</P>
<P>
Other games: Doug Able scored 18 points as Boston College (4-1) beat Brown, 
92-63, at Newton, Mass. . . . Andre McClendon scored 15 of his 26 points as he 
keyed a late first-half surge to lead Fordham to a victory over Army, 77-64, at 
West Point, N.Y. . . . Danny Jones scored 13 points and Willie Simms and 
Patrict Tompkins had 10 each as Wisconsin (6-2) stopped Western Illinois, 
69-42, at Madison, Wis. . . . Reginald Slater led a balanced scoring attack 
with 14 points as Wyoming (3-3) blew out Mc Neese State, 76-50, at Laramie, 
Wyo.

BOOK STRUGGLES FOR ANSWERS IN BIAS' DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1986, it was one of college basketball's biggest stories. Len Bias, the 
22-year-old forward at the University of Maryland, died of a cocaine overdose 
two days after the Boston Celtics drafted him in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
If Bias represented the cutting edge of basketball style with his on-court 
blend of power and grace, his sudden, shocking death was in the vanguard of a 
new scourge, with a brutal theme that no matter how talented the individual, 
how promising his future or how true his personality, his previously charmed 
life could be taken in an instant. 
</P>
<P>
Not long after Bias' death, Cleveland Brown defensive back Don Rogers died of 
an overdose of cocaine in what was a fateful summer for young athletes, but it 
was the fatal message left by Bias that may have inspired a new awareness of 
the drug culture and how it affects athletes. 
</P>
<P>
The actual circumstances of Bias' death were never made clear. No one knows who 
bought the cocaine, no one who was in that dormitory room on the Maryland 
campus has said who brought the cocaine into the room, and no one can offer a 
complete picture of the last minutes of Len Bias' life. 
</P>
<P>
In death, Bias remains a haunted memory but also a contemporary one, the 
subject of a new book by Lewis Cole, called "Never Too Young To Die, the Death 
of Len Bias," published by Pantheon Books. 
</P>
<P>
"More than anything else, I wanted to convey the sense of longing and pain that 
people who knew Leonard might have felt," Cole said. "This is a loss that's 
happening to someone out there every day, every minute. If you feel that pain, 
maybe you'll do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
Cole, who dedicated the book to his son, Aaron, was struck by the coincidence 
of the life cycle, how he could be welcoming someone into the world while 
another one was leaving it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was riding in a cab, going to the hospital to see Aaron because he was just 
born, and I saw a newspaper clipping of Bias' death," Cole said. "It just hit 
me with a particular force. How could you ever see this happening? In some 
ways, the answer is, you can't." 
</P>
<P>
Cole does not find fault with Brian Tribble, who was charged with obstruction 
of justice and later acquitted. Tribble was in the dormitory room and called 
911 when Bias went into convulsions. If there is someone to be taken to task, 
he believes, it is the authority figures then at Maryland -- Athletic Director 
Dick Dull and Coach Lefty Driesell. 
</P>
<P>
According to court testimony and public documents, Driesell maintained publicly 
that he knew nothing about possible drug use when he actually had full 
knowledge, all the while attempting a sort of cover-up to limit his own 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Driesell should make some sort of public apology for what he did," 
Cole said. "It wasn't just because he lied, but he lied while being so falsely 
pious." 
</P>
<P>
Driesell, who now coaches at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va., 
refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Cole said when he tried to interview Driesell for the book, Driesell was polite 
but turned him down, saying he didn't read books. 
</P>
<P>
"You can never find a hero in this story," Cole said. "With the possible 
exception of Mr. Bias (Len's father, James), there was no one who stood up for 
the truth." 
</P>
<P>
This should not be surprising, considering there is not a tidy way to find the 
truth in the way Len Bias died. It could be this may just be how the Bias story 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, he remains unrevenged," Cole said. "A ghost . . . a tortured 
spirit." 
</P>
<P>
The final tab: Lynn Nance is the first-year coach at Washington, replacing the 
fired Andy Russo, who coached the Huskies to a 61-62 record in four seasons and 
was paid $204,320 for the remaining two years of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
Cradle Dept.: After defeating Notre Dame Tuesday night, behind Calbert 
Cheaney's 20 points, Indiana is unbeaten in four games going into its own 
tournament, a four-team event in which the Hoosiers begin play tonight against 
South Alabama. Should Knight's Baby Bombers win, they would play the winner of 
the game between Cal State Long Beach and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bob Knight's starting lineup consists of four freshmen -- Cheaney, 
Lawrence Funderburke, Greg Graham and Chris Reynolds -- and sophomore Eric 
Anderson. Knight said he will not redshirt any of his seven-player recruiting 
class. 
</P>
<P>
He's covered: First-year Kentucky Coach Rick Pitino's picture is on the cover 
of the Wildcats' media guide, and other photos of Pitino appear on 12 of its 
first 20 pages. 
</P>
<P>
Pitino has no player taller than 6-feet-7, which means Kentucky's team is its 
smallest in 27 years. The same cannot be said for attendance. Even though NCAA 
sanctions will keep the Wildcats out of the postseason tournament and off live 
television, they have not affected tickets sales at Rupp Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Only 15 of last season's 16,000 season tickets were not reclaimed for this 
season. Those 15 were then distributed in a drawing from among 2,000 requests. 
</P>
<P>
Splish, splash: Dennis Scott of Georgia Tech showers before games, a 
superstitious practice he said he began in high school. 
</P>
<P>
Car and driver: The Las Vegas Review Journal made a lot of Nevada Las Vegas 
basketball fans angry when it investigated which cars players were driving and 
published its findings. Here is what the Review Journal said about the Runnin' 
Rebels' and their driving machines. Happy motoring: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Anderson Hunt, 1989 BMW convertible, believed to be his girlfriend's. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stacey Augmon, 1988 Mustang GT coupe. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Greg Anthony, 1983 BMW sedan and 1986 Nissan 280-ZX. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Larry Johnson, 1989 Nissan.

CARSON HOPES TO KEEP HISTORY FROM REPEATING ITSELF IN SEMIFINAL 
</P>

<P>
Carson is the top-rated high school football team in the City Section, the 
defending 4-A Division champion, and is taking a 9-1 record into tonight's 
semifinal game against Crenshaw at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In last Friday's 31-0 victory over Granada Hills Kennedy, quarterback Armin 
Youngblood threw for three touchdown passes to set a school record for a single 
season with 27. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all that, Coach Gene Vollnogle is worried. Five times since 1978, 
Carson has lost the division championship to a team it had beaten during the 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
So what makes Vollnogle nervous is that on Nov. 17, Carson defeated Pacific 
League rival Crenshaw, 39-12. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a very good team," Vollnogle said of Crenshaw (8-4). "They have two 
excellent athletes in running back Kevin Hicks and quarterback Derrick 
Williams." 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw Co-Coach Robert Garrett believes that the Cougars can win. 
</P>
<P>
"Carson can be had," he said. "We just have to worry about Crenshaw and not be 
overly concerned with what Carson does." 
</P>
<P>
In the other 4-A Division semifinal game, El Camino Real (6-5) which began the 
playoffs under .500, hopes to keep the magic going against Dorsey (8-3) at 
Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
In one 3-A Division semifinal, Locke (6-3-2) and Garfield (9-1-1) play in a 
Southeastern Conference rematch at East Los Angeles College. Garfield defeated 
the Saints, 27-20, during the regular season. In the other semifinal, South 
Gate (10-0-1), the defending champion, and Franklin (11-1) meet at Wilson High 
School. Both games begin at 7:30 p.m. LONNIE WHITE

WRESTLING WIZARDS; 
</P>
<P>
EL CAMINO PAIR LEAD THE WAY TO STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are two big reasons why El Camino's wrestling team is headed to Fresno 
for the junior college state championship tournament this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Well, one, Robert Avila, is big (5-foot-10, 260 pounds). The other, Kyle Onaga, 
is small (5-1, 118 pounds) and stocky, but extremely powerful and quick. 
</P>
<P>
You might say the beefy guy and his tough little teammate have also played 
crucial roles in leading the Warriors, predicted to place fifth in the South 
Coast Conference early in the season, to a second-place finish in the 
six-member league. 
</P>
<P>
After losing every wrestler from a team that placed fourth in the SCC and 14th 
in the state, Coach Tom Hazell wasn't optimistic at the beginning of the 
season, and he had good reason. 
</P>
<P>
His young team got hammered in its first two dual meets against Moorpark and 
Bakersfield, and shortly after that his 126-pounder, freshman Kelly Yokoe (West 
Torrance High), quit wrestling, claiming exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
"We started off a bit slow," said Hazell, a former El Camino and Oklahoma State 
wrestler. "We had all new guys, but they were real tough guys and I knew that." 
</P>
<P>
Avila's recollection was a lot more graphic: "At first I thought, 'Yeah, we got 
a tough team but not a real competitive one. We kind of got a raggedy team 
here.' Then in our first dual meet we got the crap beat out of us. I mean we 
lost our first four meets pretty bad. It was the worst." 
</P>
<P>
But the Warriors came to life after that with six consecutive wins. The streak 
included victories over Caltech, San Bernardino, San Diego, Rio Hondo and SCC 
co-champion Cerritos. El Camino (4-2 in the SCC) lost only two conference 
tests, to Palomar (SCC co-champ) and Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Now Hazell refers to his team as perhaps the best in his 10 years as El 
Camino's coach. The school has had six individual state champions in that span 
but never a championship team or a first-place in its tough league. 
</P>
<P>
While the Warriors don't have the personnel to win the team state title, they 
have the talent to place in the top 10 and add a couple of California champions 
to their list. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Onaga and Avila, El Camino will take West Torrance freshman Craig 
Garriott (150 pounds) and Ben Rice (190 pounds), a freshman from Washington, to 
Fresno City College. Both placed third at the Southern California Regionals 
last week at Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance freshman Jerry Decker (158 pounds) and South Torrance freshman 
John Prefontaine (167 pounds) will go as alternates for placing fourth at the 
regionals. 
</P>
<P>
Onaga finished second at Rancho Santiago after losing to top-ranked Eric 
Legarrta of Golden West College in the final. The 6-5 loss was Onaga's first of 
the season. The 22-year-old has a 10-1 record, which includes five matches in 
the 126-pound division and a 13-9 victory in the 134-pound category, a great 
feat for such a small wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
The Rolling Hills High graduate has reason to feel assurance. After redshirting 
in his first year at El Camino because of a dislocated right elbow, Onaga 
placed second in the state as a freshman All-American in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He quit competitive wrestling after that to attend Cal State Dominguez Hills, 
but Hazell and several team members persuaded him to join this year's 
depth-lacking club after Yokoe quit. 
</P>
<P>
"His height, or rather lack of it, makes it very hard to take him down," Hazell 
said. "He's real tough on his feet and he can take anybody down." 
</P>
<P>
The same applies to Avila, who's twice as large and 142 pounds heavier. The 
portly freshman from Mark Keppel High in Alhambra has racked up a 22-5 mark as 
a heavyweight. He placed first at the regional with a 3-1 overtime victory 
against Palomar's Phil Jones in the final. 
</P>
<P>
"He's extremely strong although he doesn't really look like it," Hazell said. 
"It's very difficult to take him down." 
</P>
<P>
Onaga praises his teammate: "He's a stud. I'm glad I can say we wrestle on the 
same team. He thrives on pressure and he wrestles on power, and he's got 
arrogant confidence." 
</P>
<P>
That's what brought Avila success at Mark Keppel where he was a three-time 
All-Mission Valley League selection. He left the school with a 140-22 career 
mark and broke a six-year school record with 92 pins. The 18-year-old placed 
second at last year's high school state tournament, which he entered with a 
52-0 mark. 
</P>
<P>
The ability to attack the opponent's lower body made Avila a unique 
heavyweight. Most wrestlers in his category strike above the waist because 
they're not agile enough to hit the legs. 
</P>
<P>
"He was good at everything," said Mark Keppel assistant coach Larry Landless. 
"He can even shoot (go for the legs) like a lightweight."

LOYOLA WILL FACE A TOUGH TEST AGAINST RESTED SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the heels of the shoot-out Thursday with U.S. International, the Loyola 
Marymount basketball team could get its toughest test since Nevada Las Vegas 
when UC Santa Barbara comes to town at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara, off to a 3-1 start and coming off a week's rest, has found its 
way into some Top 20s and has lost only to Iowa at Iowa. The Gauchos' victories 
include a 23-point manhandling of Pepperdine, a 17-point win over the 
University of San Diego and a 26-point blowout of Bradley. The loss to Iowa was 
by six points in the championship of the Amana Classic. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos defeated Loyola a year ago in Santa Barbara, 95-94. 
</P>
<P>
Lions guard Jeff Fryer is hoping to get medical clearance to play Saturday. His 
shooting hand, which has a broken bone, remains in a cast and will be 
re-examined today. 
</P>
<P>
In his absence, Hank Gathers and Bo Kimble continue to carry the scoring load, 
averaging 29 and 27.5 points, and Coach Paul Westhead has gotten production 
from the bench. Supersub Tom Peabody has been filling in as the starter -- as 
he did much of last season when Kimble was hurt -- and Terrell Lowery is 
scoring in double figures and leading the conference in assists. 
</P>
<P>
Up front, sophomore John O'Connell has earned Coach Paul Westhead's respect, 
and when O'Connell injured an ankle last week sophomore center Chris Knight 
stepped up with his best performance at Loyola, scoring 12 points and hitting 
several clutch shots against Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the ankle injury, O'Connell played a few minutes last weekend against 
Jacksonville and has practiced all week. "He was hurt badly enough to go to the 
hospital for X-rays, but before the game (the next day) he told me, 'I'm ready 
to go,' " Westhead said of his fellow Philadelphia native, O'Connell. "Monday 
we had a hard two-hour practice and then ran some sprints, and he was the 
winner in his row in every sprint. It goes to show what determination can do. 
He's an old-school player. He's a Philly player from the late '60s, not the 
late '80s." 
</P>
<P>
Peabody and Lowery have been so steady off the bench that Westhead said the 
team doesn't miss a beat with them in. "Lowery and Peabody have been excellent 
off the bench, but we expect that," Westhead said. "It reminds me of two years 
ago when we had Fryer and Enoch Simmons coming off the bench." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara, which gave UNLV a run for the Big West title two years ago and 
may do so again, has a veteran lineup featuring shot-blocking forward Eric 
MacArthur (12.9 points, 10.5 rebounds) and shooting guard Carrick DeHart (20.3 
points, 54% on three-pointers). The other starters are forwards Lucius Davis 
and Gary Gray (15 points per game) and guard Paul Johnson. DeHart, the former 
Santa Monica High star, was named Big West Player of the Week after hitting a 
school-record eight three-pointers against Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jerry Pimm uses a nine-man rotation including freshman guard Idris Jones, 
the highest scorer off the bench (5.3). 
</P>
<P>
The Loyola women will play Division II power Cal Poly Pomona at 5 p.m. 
Saturday, preceding the men's game. The Loyola women, 2-2, lost two games last 
weekend in New York after opening the season with two victories at home. 
</P>
<P>
Guards Kristen Bruich and Lynn Flanagan lead the Lions in scoring, combining 
for 27 points per game. Bruich averages 4.5 assists. Center Tricia Gibson is 
averaging 9.8 points and 8.3 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, 4-0 entering the week, is led by 6-foot-2 All-American forward Niki 
Bracken (23.5 points, 9.3 rebounds), 6-1 center Marcine Edmonds and guard 
Carrie Egan. Point guard Stephanie Coons, 5-11, is averaging 13.5 points and 
4.8 assists.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL NCAA WEST REGIONAL; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA'S WILLIAMS TAKES GAME TO A HIGHER LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Andy Banachowski ran across Natalie Williams, she was playing volleyball 
in a club tournament up north. She was leaps and bounds ahead of most of the 
players in athletic ability, but the UCLA women's volleyball coach was not 
particularly interested. 
</P>
<P>
After all, from what he had heard, Williams was going to concentrate on 
basketball after graduating from high school in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew she was a great athlete, but I had heard she was a basketball player, 
and that she was going to play basketball in college and not really concentrate 
on volleyball, so we didn't really pursue her too much early on," said 
Banachowski, whose top-ranked Bruins will be the host team in the NCAA West 
Regional beginning tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Williams was a basketball player. She averaged 30 points and 17 
rebounds a game at Utah's Taylorsville High. She was contacted by such women's 
basketball powerhouses as Tennessee and Louisiana Tech. 
</P>
<P>
And basketball was part of her heritage, her father Nate having played several 
seasons in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
"I never lived with him," Williams said of her father. "But I guess I just got 
the genes." 
</P>
<P>
But Williams had also played some volleyball, well enough that she became a 
high school All-American in her senior year, in both sports. And by then, she 
was begining to lean more toward volleyball, since her coaches were expressing 
the likelihood of a brighter future for her in the sport that she plays above 
the net, than the one that she plays under it. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Daiva Tomkus, the Bruins' standout middle blocker, remembers hearing 
about Williams' exploits in the various summer volleyball tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
"I just kept hearing stories about when she played club ball, how she would 
just literally destroy other teams," Tomkus said. "She jumped so high and was 
so powerful. I remember hearing different club girls telling me how threatened 
they were by her." 
</P>
<P>
She was one of only two high school players invited to train with the U.S. 
national team. The other is Chula Vista Palomar High's Keba Phipps, who is 
still with the team, training in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who could have stayed with the team, chose college instead, citing 
the desire for an education and preferences for "more experience and (a chance) 
to play with people my own age." 
</P>
<P>
She was soon contacted by Stanford and Hawaii, and as she says, "all the major 
schools." UCLA was one of them, but it wasn't high on her list. 
</P>
<P>
But Banachowski wound up with Williams anyway, courtesy of cross-town rival 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
On a recruiting trip to USC's mid-city campus, Williams was taken by Coach 
Chuck Erbe to a match against UCLA, on the Westwood campus. It proved to be a 
mistake by Erbe. 
</P>
<P>
"After I saw the campus and the gym and everything (at UCLA), I decided I 
wanted to take a trip here. I just loved everything and I knew this was the 
place I wanted to go," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
A 19-year-old freshman, Williams is one of the reasons UCLA is the nation's 
top-ranked team going into tonight's Pauley Pavilion matchup at 6:30 against 
Arizona (18-12). 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins are 28-2 and, according to Banachowski, "Natalie has been a big part 
of helping us have a great year . . . that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
She finished second in freshman-of-the-year voting to Bev Oden of No. 8 
Stanford (18-11), which plays unranked Wyoming (23-6), tonight at 8:30 in the 
other West Regional game. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is hitting a phenomenal .329, a feat not accomplished by many freshmen 
at any school. She is second in that category to Tomkus. Williams is among only 
three Bruins who have had 700 total attempts, joining All-Americans Tomkus and 
sophomore Elaine Youngs, who along with Williams were selected to the 
first-team All-Pacific 10 team. Williams has 364 kills, second only to Tomkus. 
</P>
<P>
Standing 6-feet-1, Williams can jump and touch at 10-7, five inches higher than 
Tomkus or Youngs. 
</P>
<P>
"It still amazes me, even at this stage, that she can do that," marveled 
Banachowski, in his 23rd year at UCLA. "That just puts her on a different 
level, as far as being able to play at a height above the net that other 
players can't."

MORSE'S BACKFIELD WORKS THREE WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forget prime time, front page and all that rot. Morse's backfield isn't going 
to steal any publicity from the guys who carry the ball for miles and miles at 
Rancho Buena Vista. 
</P>
<P>
But Teddy Lawrence, Ututofo Faime and Jesse Campbell don't mind. In case 
anybody has forgotten, they're playing in the stadium Saturday night, too. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't slouch," Morse Coach John Shacklett said. "We wouldn't be here if we 
did." 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 9, Morse (11-2) defeated Point Loma, 42-35, to win the City Eastern 
League title. Since then, the Tigers have playoff victories over Bonita Vista, 
San Dieguito and Mira Mesa. They will defend their 3-A championship against 
Rancho Buena Vista Saturday night at 8. 
</P>
<P>
Taking credit away from the rest of the Morse football team and giving it all 
to the backfield would be unfair. David Dunn has been steady and sometimes 
spectacular, playing both receiver and defensive back. Another defensive back, 
Chris Jones, made crucial interceptions against Mira Mesa and Point Loma during 
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
But there is something special about the way quarterback Lawrence and running 
backs Faime and Campbell have blended to run Morse's option. Morse doesn't have 
the dominating offensive line it did last season, when the Tigers defeated 
Orange Glen in the stadium to win the section championship. So they've gotten 
by with a little bit of juke, a little bit of jitterbug and a lot of 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
While the ball is often in the hands of any one of the three, Shacklett has 
placed the responsibility and leadership in the hands of Lawrence, a 5-11, 
177-pound junior. That's a lot to ask. But Lawrence, who started at defensive 
back last season, is comfortable with his role. He isn't afraid to tell seniors 
what he thinks. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell them 'You're doing this wrong' and not feel bad about it," said 
Lawrence, who has completed 73 of 144 for 1,527 yards and rushed for 505 yards 
in 65 carries. "And then not think 'Oh, they'll beat me up later.' " 
</P>
<P>
To fully understand Lawrence, you should know this. He picks things up quickly. 
His mother, Kathryn, said he was riding a bike at age 3. In the 3-A 
championship game last year, it was Lawrence who picked off a Cree Morris' pass 
in the end zone and took it 106 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
When he made the team as a sophomore, people said to him: "You won't start in 
10th grade." 
</P>
<P>
Kathryn didn't think he would either. 
</P>
<P>
Teddy came home at the beginning of last season and told her he made the team. 
</P>
<P>
She said: "Baby, you know you're going to ride the bench." 
</P>
<P>
He said: "Mom, I'm not going to ride the bench." 
</P>
<P>
She said: "Yeah, Ted. OK." 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, he started. The more he started, the more confident he became. At 
the beginning of this season, he didn't like it when Shacklett called for a 
pass play. 
</P>
<P>
"I would kind of get mad," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Point Loma game, when he threw for 275 yards and three 
touchdowns, he has come to enjoy using his arm almost as much as he enjoys 
using his feet. 
</P>
<P>
If it is Lawrence's talent that makes him Morse's leader, it is perhaps his 
sense of humor that makes it easy for the seniors to accept him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of those guys that smiles all the time," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Just the other day, Kathryn was telling him she was going to send him far away 
to college. His response was this: "Then instead of saying 'Hi, Mom' on 
television, I'll say 'Hi, sister.' " 
</P>
<P>
THE SHORT-YARDAGE GUY 
</P>
<P>
Let's clear the name thing up first. 
</P>
<P>
Ututofo Faime. 
</P>
<P>
Pronunciation: Ooh-TOO-to-foh Fee-AH-may. 
</P>
<P>
Roll call during the first week of class is always interesting. No one ever 
gets it right. 
</P>
<P>
Faime (5-11, 180) doesn't run with the elegance of Campbell or Lawrence. It's 
easier for him to just plow over people. He did that 144 times this season for 
803 yards and 12 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
He also plowed over a number of people to make room for Campbell. Lawrence 
thinks he'll be hard to replace next season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be hard to find somebody with his size, speed and power," 
Lawrence said. "He's just devastating." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, in Morse's 42-21 playoff victory over San Dieguito, Faime showed 
everybody he can run around people once in a while, too, taking a kickoff 82 
yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually," he says, smiling, "I wasn't touched." 
</P>
<P>
"He juked them," Campbell says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Very unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"The team knows me for my power," he said. "I have the reputation of going 
through people." 
</P>
<P>
THE ALL-PURPOSE GUY 
</P>
<P>
And now ladies and gentlemen . . . 
</P>
<P>
The president. 
</P>
<P>
Jessie Campbell's day starts with study hall at 7 a.m., continues on through 
his daily classes, through football practice and then he has his meetings to 
attend. Then he goes home and does his homework. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell is Morse's student body president. He is also a representative for the 
Parent-Teacher Assn. and president of the Good Quality Leadership Club. Nice 
resume for a high school student. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty busy," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He keeps defenders busy, too. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, a 5-8, 175-pound senior, rushed 166 times this season for 1,347 yards 
and nine touchdowns. He was also the guy who went 54 yards in the stadium last 
year to score the winning touchdown against Orange Glen. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's father, Jessie Sr., says he learned a few tricks while playing 
running back at South Carolina State and has passed them along to his son. But 
he says that being a member of a football team is probably the best teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good experience," Jessie Sr. says. "You have to manage your time." 
</P>
<P>
Which is certainly useful for someone with Campbell's schedule.

GRASS GOT GREENER FOR RBV, LEVINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Dust Bowl, they called it. 
</P>
<P>
A dried-out field surrounded by a dirt track, and a few rickety wooden 
bleachers bandaged together by some old metal bars. 
</P>
<P>
There was no grass in the middle of the field, just dry, crumbling brown dirt. 
Lots of it. Thankfully, there were no games there, just practices -- long, hot 
and dusty. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista senior tight end Shannon Levings started his varsity 
football career on this field three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
It was at Lincoln Junior High School in Vista. Each day after school, a few 
dozen RBV players would climb into a bus for the mile trek to the practice 
field. The older guys with drivers' licenses would ferry themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Levings rode the bus. Oh, sometimes he would hitch a ride with one of the 
seniors. But he was just a sophomore, so he usually kept quiet and boarded the 
bus. 
</P>
<P>
Levings was a pioneer, a starter on RBV's first football team. He remembers 
those days well, particularly the days on that Lincoln Junior High School 
field. RBV players still joke about the Dust Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of a bad field," Levings said. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, there wasn't much choice. It was 1987, and a football program 
was being born. 
</P>
<P>
Flip the Shannon Levings scrapbook ahead about three years, and the field is a 
whole lot different. It's still 100 yards long, but now it's covered with 
grass. Lots of grass. And look around. There are lots of seats. San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium seats more than 50,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
They call it The Stadium. All season, high school football players dream of 
playing for the championship in The Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, RBV will be there to play Morse for the section 3-A title. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the second consecutive appearance there for Levings and his 
teammates. RBV won the 2-A section championship last year, 21-10, over San 
Pasqual. This year, the Longhorns can become the first team to win a 2-A 
championship one year and a 3-A title the next. 
</P>
<P>
And one more thing. Since last season, they've been practicing on a field at 
their own school. They've come a long way from Lincoln Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-feet, 190-pounds, Levings isn't a prototype tight end. He isn't 
all-county; he isn't even first-team all-league. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks more like a gardener," RBV Coach Craig Bell said. "Or like a kid in 
the back row struggling to get a passing grade. But his heart is probably 
bigger than the city of Vista." 
</P>
<P>
Levings -- second-team All-Palomar League this season -- has started on the 
varsity for as long as RBV and its football team have existed. He was a split 
end his sophomore season on a team that went 4-5-1, and he was a split end his 
junior year on the 13-0 2-A team. This year, he moved to tight end. He will 
finish his senior season with another trip to The Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
When you read RBV's press clippings, you won't find his name mentioned often. 
He caught only five passes this season for 135 yards and three touchdowns 
despite starting nine of RBV's 11 games (he missed the first two playoff games 
with a strained knee). But he's a solid high school football player, a cog in a 
championship team. 
</P>
<P>
"He isn't real large, yet he's blocked everybody from 280 to 140-pounders," 
Bell said. "He doesn't have great hands, but he always catches the ball. He 
isn't real quick, but he manages to get free. He can't, but he always does. 
</P>
<P>
"On paper, you look at him and say, 'Nope. No way. It can't be done.' But he's 
one of the best things that's happened to us." 
</P>
<P>
In an offense built around the rushing game, a tight end blocks. Markeith Ross 
and O.J. Hall, RBV's two 2,000-yard running backs, get the glory. Levings gets 
the bruises. 
</P>
<P>
He has played football for seven years. He played his freshman season at Vista 
High, three years of Pop Warner before that. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he has reached the end of the line. There are no college scholarships 
waiting -- there's not much of a market for small tight ends. Levings is 
considering San Diego State or Cal State Long Beach. He will study art, not 
square-outs. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe if I were a few inches taller, I'd be thinking about playing more," he 
said. "I like playing, but I will have a lot of good things to look back on." 
</P>
<P>
This week has been one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"With all of the stuff that's been happening to the team lately, everybody is 
telling us it's not very often that stuff like this happens," he said. "It's 
really weird when you think about it. I'm more nervous this year than last 
year. It's my senior year. I have to go out with a bang." 
</P>
<P>
Levings nearly went out with a splash during his sophomore year. He was on the 
Vista swimming team as a freshman, and he enjoyed it so much he was ready to 
give up football for water polo the next fall. He was talked out of it by Bell 
and RBV quarterback David Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
"David Roberts ragged me, and then he told Coach Bell," Levings said. "When we 
registered for sports (the summer before Levings' sophomore year), Coach Bell 
said, 'I hear you play football. But you go to swimming for a year, and we lose 
you to water polo.' He said something about having water in my ears." 
</P>
<P>
So Levings changed his mind. One of his rewards comes Saturday when he makes 
his second trip to the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I never played water polo before anyway," he said. "I was just going to try 
out for something new." 
</P>
<P>
In three years, he has seen a bunch of guys grow from rookie status into a real 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and David played Pop Warner together," he said. "Just yesterday, we were 
talking about how far we've come. We were talking about how important it is to 
make our senior season the best. Now, we have to win one more." 
</P>
<P>
And after Saturday -- win or lose -- Levings will close one chapter of his 
life. He will turn his attention to the rest of his senior year, and football 
will be only a memory. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, he will remember those crunching blocks, lopsided victories, and even a 
few losses. He will remember a handful of catches and a fistful of practices. 
But mostly, he said, he will remember pregame moments, sitting around the 
locker room with friends and catching up on the week's events. 
</P>
<P>
And bottom line, he said, is that the best thing about having played three 
years of varsity football is all of the friends he has made. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure," he said, "maybe I'll hang out with these guys later."

USIU KEEPS IT CLOSE BUT LOSES TO LIONS, 152-137

<P>
U.S. International, which lately has become college basketball's answer to Ed 
McMahon, earned a little of its own limelight against Loyola Marymount Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
USIU Coach Gary Zarecky fancies his Gulls as a team that can run with the likes 
of LMU and Oklahoma. But in two games against the Lions last season and a game 
earlier this season with the Sooners, USIU proved to be just so much fodder. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, USIU played LMU tough in the first half and led, 94-92, with 
13:13 remaining. But the Lions scored the next 18 points on their way to a 
152-137 victory before approximately 800 at Golden Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the fifth in a row for USIU (2-5). Loyola Marymount (4-1) won its 
fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
This one had nothing such as the team records set in last year's two meetings, 
which LMU won, 162-144 and 181-150, or the 97 points Oklahoma scored in the 
first half against the Gulls two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the Gulls' Kevin Bradshaw set a USIU record with 54 points, breaking the 
mark of 47 set by teammate Demetrius Laffitte against Point Loma Nazarene last 
season. Bradshaw also led the team in rebounding with 13. Laffitte scored 25 
points and had 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Neither could offset the dominating play of Hank Gathers, who had 37 points and 
27 rebounds. Four other Loyola players scored in double figures as the teams 
combined for 289 points, the fourth highest in NCAA Division I history. Three 
of those four games were between USIU and LMU. 
</P>
<P>
"The talent kicked in," Zarecky said. "Our kids played a good game for 
three-quarters of the way. They really over-achieved. I thought we did a good 
job breaking their press. We're getting our confidence back." 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls showed that they weren't intimidated by the Lions. USIU trailed, 
34-24, with 12:34 remaining in the first half, but the Gulls rallied to pull 
within 75-72 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
But in the second half, the bench depth between the Gulls and the Lions became 
evident as LMU went on its 18-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
"I said before the season we have the best bench since I've been here and 
they've proven it," Gathers said. "A lot of people laugh at this USIU, but 
they're a remarkable team. I respect a team that can come out and run that 
way."

LIFE IN A BLEAK POST-CIVILIZED WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Better Get Your Angel On by Jennifer Allen (Alfred Knopf: $16.95; 112 pages) 
</P>
<P>
If you stripped away everything that makes contemporary life faintly tolerable, 
you'd be left with the world according to Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Though she's heralded as a scribe of the "post-verbal" culture, the state she 
describes is eerily reminiscent of the prehistoric society so succinctly 
defined by Thomas Hobbes: "No arts, no letters, no society, and which is worst 
of all, continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man, 
solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short." 
</P>
<P>
There's one depressingly crucial difference. The bleak conditions Hobbes 
described eventually improved, but once you're "post-civilized," there's 
nowhere to go but down and out. Though Allen, as a "post-verbal" writer, is not 
geographically as specific as she might be, a close reader can easily deduce 
that most of these horrific tales are set in California. We're already here, in 
the eye of the apocalypse. 
</P>
<P>
All vestiges of love, law and morality are gone, replaced by hatred, violence 
and mindless lust. Taking this unpromising detritus, the author succeeds in 
giving us a vision of the immediate future, one so unnervingly close to present 
reality that the old reliable tranquilizer -- "It's only a story" -- doesn't 
work. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, these aren't stories in the ordinary sense, but mere moments in 
time and space -- structureless and all but characterless, though the 
environment is all too familiar -- the beach, a motel, the freeway, a housing 
project. Allen creates her fiction out of found incidents much the way the 
Dadaists made art from found objects, but while they were only teasing the 
public, Allen is warning us that this is the way life is going to be from now 
on. 
</P>
<P>
Because her actors have all but lost the knack of intelligible speech, the 
direction is not immediately apparent. Even so, you get the drift, or perhaps 
undertow is the better word. 
</P>
<P>
In a grimly sardonic piece called "Dinner," a monstrous family of three boys, a 
mother and father are having a meal. The father wants everyone to say grace, 
which in this context is as unimaginable as expecting a hyena to mind a baby. 
One son sucks the blood off the strings tying the roast, another drinks blood, 
a third breaks the furniture. The father hits the kids, curses, and threatens, 
while the mother endures, saying at the end, "Grace is over," not only the 
understatement of the decade but a concise summary of the content of the whole 
book. 
</P>
<P>
In "Her Name Is Wahoo," the title character is a dog and the narrator "a hoser 
of pens at the pet kennel." Man and dog live in a subdivision so raw that 
coyotes steal infants. Instead of names, the residents are known by the 
position of their houses -- "the first house on the left." If you've been 
looking for an effective dehumanization metaphor, your search is over. 
</P>
<P>
Tough customers can proceed to "Chlorine," in which one character has a 
crucifix stuck in his nose and other is called Skate-Rat Lance. The whole gang 
is "spaced out to the max," enjoying a small-scale race war on the cement-sided 
river bank where they roller-skate. What Allen's publisher calls "a linguistic 
evolution in the very first stages of staking its historical claim" is not only 
evident here, but already in full flower. 
</P>
<P>
These are all worst-case scenarios, written to be perceived rather than 
described. We're dealing here with hyper-reality, and it's not for the 
squeamish. Endowed with perfect pitch for the speech of her humanoids, 
exploiting a macabre and antic imagination, Allen's 13 projections not only 
explore the depths of modern life but wallow in them. You join the fun at your 
peril.

SUPERMARKETS PRESENT KOSHER CHALLENGE; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: SALT, COFFEE AND FRESH FRUIT ARE OK, BUT FORGET CANNED FISH AND, FOR 
HEAVEN'S SAKE, STAY AWAY FROM THE OREO COOKIES. THOSE AND OTHER TIPS WERE 
OFFERED BY A RABBI ON A RECENT FOOD SHOPPING TOUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Did you know that a can of tuna could contain, God forbid, chunks of shark or 
dolphin or something else that isn't kosher? 
</P>
<P>
No? How about this: Did you know that a certain brand of salami, famous for 
answering to a higher authority, includes meat from cows whose lungs may not be 
totally smooth? 
</P>
<P>
And that's not the worst of it: Oreos are made with lard. 
</P>
<P>
Oy. 
</P>
<P>
You could learn a lot about keeping kosher on a tour of a supermarket with 
Rabbi Arye Weiner, West Coast director of the Union of Orthodox Jewish 
Congregations of America. 
</P>
<P>
Pure nuts are kosher, for example, but you have to be careful with peanut 
butter. The emulsifiers that keep it from settling might have come from an 
unkosher animal source. 
</P>
<P>
"Pure nuts is how I feel right now," someone in the crowd of more than 70 
muttered. 
</P>
<P>
"This is leaving me brain-dead," said another. 
</P>
<P>
"Rabbi," came a plaintive plea. "I've got to live in the real world." 
</P>
<P>
And why not? It took almost two hours for Weiner, 33, a tall, slim man in a 
pinstripe suit, purple tie and black fedora, to make his way from the liquor 
department on one side of the store to the fresh fish on the other. 
</P>
<P>
Every aisle was fraught with surprises as the red-bearded rabbi, a graduate of 
the Lakewood (N.J.) Academy, one of the country's premier rabbinical 
seminaries, dispensed guidance to the perplexed. 
</P>
<P>
"Concentrated orange juice?" 
</P>
<P>
"No problem." 
</P>
<P>
"Kosher salt?" 
</P>
<P>
"All salt is kosher. We don't look for problems. We have enough problems as it 
is. So we don't go looking for non-kosher salt." 
</P>
<P>
Any kind of hard liquor is fine, and so is beer, said Weiner. This raised a 
cheer. So did an announcement on the loudspeaker that the store now stocks 
fresh kosher chicken. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was made up largely of people in their 20s and 30s. Most of the men 
wore skullcaps; a few sported less traditional baseball caps. Among the women, 
a few covered their hair with scarves. 
</P>
<P>
Some, who were born into observant homes, came to learn which supermarket 
products were in and which were out. Manufacturers can gain or lose their 
kosher status overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Others, who came to the strict observance of traditional Judaism later in life, 
hoped to learn how to shop for the meals they liked before they accepted the 
restrictions of kashrut, the Jewish dietary laws. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the older generation were content with matzo and gefilte fish and 
boiled flanken, and they considered that a satisfactory kosher meal," said Jodi 
Gross, 32, a librarian and housewife. 
</P>
<P>
"But a lot of the younger people who become kosher later, who're used to fine 
foods, they aren't just content to eat matzo and gefilte fish." 
</P>
<P>
"It makes your life a lot easier to be able to trust a product," said Sue 
Chenetz, 32, a limousine driver. "There are so many things we can cook with. 
The only thing that's missing is kosher gelatin. It just doesn't exist." 
</P>
<P>
The evening at an Alpha Beta market in the Pico-Robertson district was 
sponsored by Weiner's group, which vouches for the status of 80% of about 
17,000 kosher products in American supermarkets, and by Ashreinu, an Orthodox 
women's study group. 
</P>
<P>
Weiner started the tour with a few warnings. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you bluntly," he said. "Keeping kosher is not a ticket to heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it couldn't hurt. The ancient rabbis claimed that a kosher diet can make 
the body a vessel for holiness. 
</P>
<P>
Take the biblical injunction against cooking a goat in its mother's milk. 
</P>
<P>
"Milk represents compassion and meat represents violence and death," Weiner 
said. "You can't combine these two forces in the universe. They don't go 
together. The whole ritual of kosher slaughter is to teach dignity with life 
and death." 
</P>
<P>
Another warning was more prosaic: Beware the letter K on a product. Standing by 
itself, it is no guarantee that the contents are kosher. 
</P>
<P>
Some foods -- sugar, coffee, fresh fruit and vegetables, Grade-A butter -- are 
kosher by nature. They don't need a kosher designation at all. Neither does 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"Hypothetically, if the doctor told you to eat pork, you eat pork," the rabbi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Cough syrup?" 
</P>
<P>
"If you're taking it for a cold, fine. If you're taking it to get high, that's 
another question." 
</P>
<P>
But foods that are not kosher by nature should carry the hekhsher (Hebrew for 
"seal") of an individual rabbi or inspection agency, observant Jews believe. 
</P>
<P>
Many cheeses, for example, are made with rennet, an extract from the membrane 
from calves' stomachs. Since this amounts to mixing milk and meat, most cheese 
is out for Orthodox Jews, although rabbis from other, less stringent strains of 
Judaism have found that rennet is so far from being meat that it isn't a 
problem. Some rennet-free cheese is available with a hekhsher. 
</P>
<P>
Other foods have natural or artificial flavorings that come from who knows 
where. Ambergris from the intestines of whales, for example. Or civet, from the 
sweat glands of a cat. All definitely not kosher. 
</P>
<P>
Even vegetarian baked beans could have been canned on the same line as pork and 
beans, you should excuse the expression. If the can carries a hekhsher, the 
assumption is that somebody was watching to make sure the equipment was 
pork-free. 
</P>
<P>
Which doesn't mean that it's good for you necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
"Kishke (stuffed sausage) can kill you," noted Paul Glasser, the former 
executive vice president of an Orthodox synagogue in Beverly Hills. He and 
partner Sheila Bailey are organizing a Jewish festival featuring kosher 
products at the Los Angeles Convention Center next month. 
</P>
<P>
"People think kosher food is blessed. Kosher food isn't blessed; it's 
supervised," Glasser said in an interview. "Somebody's watching it, but not for 
calories or cholesterol." 
</P>
<P>
At the supermarket Tuesday night, Mariam Weisel, 26, a medical secretary, was 
surprised at some of the complexities of keeping kosher. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm finding out that things I thought were kosher are not, and things that I 
thought weren't kosher are OK." 
</P>
<P>
Meat always needs a hekhsher, since Jewish rules call for it to be slaughtered 
and inspected by trained experts. 
</P>
<P>
Fish does not need expert slaughtering, and many varieties of fish are kosher 
by nature. But canned fish could have been prepared in the same plant as 
shrimp, which is forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
"Rabbi, that can of fish over there has a hekhsher on it," said a wise guy in a 
baseball cap. "Does that make it holy mackerel?" 
</P>
<P>
All observant Jews rely on the same laws and rabbinical interpretations to keep 
kosher, but each household has to make its own decisions on what to buy. 
</P>
<P>
"People have their own stringencies they impose on themselves," Weiner said. He 
pointed out that supermarket milk, which is fine with him, would not be 
admitted into some homes. 
</P>
<P>
Sorting out these questions can keep rabbis busy. Weiner, who operates a 
"kosher hot line" from 8 to 10 p.m. from his home in the Fairfax District, says 
he gets as many as 40 calls a night. (The number is 965-9125). 
</P>
<P>
As for Hebrew National, the firm that claims to answer to a higher authority, 
its meat comes from cows that may have more lung-scarring than the Orthodox 
Union would like, but it is still kosher, Weiner said. 
</P>
<P>
"All of our products are fully inspected. We don't claim to be glatt kosher," 
said Steven Bachenheimer, president of Bronx-based National Foods, which makes 
Hebrew National products. 
</P>
<P>
Glatt, the Yiddish word for smooth, refers to meat from cows whose lungs have 
been found to be totally free of scars. 
</P>
<P>
"With the standard kosher product, you're permitted to have some level of 
scarring," he said in a phone interview. "It's not that the animal is sick. If 
it was sick the USDA would catch it. This is a kind of second level of 
inspection." 
</P>
<P>
Although observant Jews are the bedrock of the kosher food market, Bachenheimer 
said the demand is growing from the general population. 
</P>
<P>
Glasser agreed. He quoted from a study that found 6 million people in the 
United States following diets that fall within the rules of kashrut. 
</P>
<P>
Of these, only about 1.5 million are Jewish, Glasser said. The rest are 
vegetarians, Muslims or health food devotees. 
</P>
<P>
"We estimate that half our business today is with people who are not Jewish," 
Bachenheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
"Kosher has come to signify quality to a lot of people. And I think there's a 
trend toward the mainstreaming of Jewish foods. Like bagels. What's going on is 
that people are gaining a taste for things that traditionally have been Jewish 
foods, much like they acquired a taste for pizza years ago."

SENIORS SEND IN CLOWNS AND BRIGHTEN OTHERS' LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ushers wore green felt handmade smocks and had green feathers sticking out 
of their caps. They were elves for a day, guiding toddlers and seniors to a 
holiday breakfast at the Carson Community Center on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
It was a different act for the Carson Clowners, who prefer dressing in bright 
wigs, greasepaint, oversize shoes and multicolored, baggy clothes. 
</P>
<P>
But even if they had to shed their disguises, the Clowners did not let that 
interfere with what has become for them a tradition of helping others. One of 
them did say: "I feel silly. It's more fun being a clown. I can be silly and 
anonymous." 
</P>
<P>
From a group of four senior citizens in 1985 with a handful of skits, the clown 
club has grown to 12 active members with a repertoire of a dozen skits and a 
barrelful of magic tricks and jokes. 
</P>
<P>
The club originated with Norma Hernandez, senior citizens coordinator at the 
community center. When she joined the center as a volunteer in 1980, she wanted 
to get the seniors more active and to use the many who came there as a resource 
to help others. 
</P>
<P>
"At most senior centers, you have people just sitting around playing bingo," 
she said at the center this week. "I felt that seniors entertaining and 
motivating seniors was better. If you have a group of people just sitting 
around, then someone comes along who is all happy and jolly, the whole group 
brightens up." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, who studied theater arts at Harbor College and has done some 
clowning at parties, taught them the basics of clowning -- everything from how 
to apply makeup to how to move. They applied those skills, learned some skits, 
and the next stop was at convalescent homes in Torrance and Carson and the 
Veterans Hospital in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous at first," said Ruth Torres, otherwise known as Cookie the Clown 
and one of the first four clowners. "But it was fun." 
</P>
<P>
There were a few skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
"Some seniors said, 'They are makin' fools of themselves,' " said Marvin 
(Marvina the Clown) Brown, also an original clowner. 
</P>
<P>
But others wanted to learn. And Hernandez arranged workshops with professional 
clowns, who helped them develop more skits and taught them how to do balloon 
sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
Demand grew. 
</P>
<P>
The clowns were asked to perform at city celebrations, in nursery schools, and 
they even kept children entertained while awaiting fingerprinting for the 
Sheriff's Department child identification program at the Carson Mall. 
</P>
<P>
With names like Dandy, Bonkers, Jolly, Jelly Bean and Popcorn, their reason for 
being has never changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Our primary purpose is to give joy," said Ruben DeLa Rosa, who clowns as 
Corney. 
</P>
<P>
In hospitals, their effect on patients is immediate. 
</P>
<P>
"People were down.. . . The minute they saw a clown come in, it was like going 
from room to room and turning on the lights. They all started smiling," said 
Richard Newman, who goes by the name Smiley. 
</P>
<P>
The pleasure for Hernandez has been in seeing the blossoming of the new clowns. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest reward is seeing the fulfillment the clowns receive. Watching the 
excitement in their eyes when they are performing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen very shy, reserved people become our best clowns."

EVERY REASON UNDER THE SUN FOR RIDING STARLIGHT

<P>
Flanked by her daughter and great-grandson, Frances Shelburne, 75, of Redding 
waits patiently on the Glendale train station platform for Amtrak's Coast 
Starlight to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"Trains are wonderful," she said. "Everybody seems to have such a good time on 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Philip Meador, 50, of Glendale occupies his time reading a paperback while 
relaxing on an outdoor bench. "I'm going to see my wife in San Jose," he said, 
explaining that she is visiting relatives. Why not fly? "I just wanted to 
relax. Besides, it's $40 cheaper." 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun and a wonderful way to travel," said Joan Coston of Northridge, 
waiting with her son, Doug, 23, who was taking the train home to Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
The northbound Coast Starlight pulls into Glendale about 10 every morning as 
Amtrak ticket agent Lawrence Nebrensky wraps up ticket sales, finishes the 
public address announcements and gets ready to make sure that all the baggage 
of the three dozen daily patrons gets on board the Seattle-bound train. 
</P>
<P>
By 6:33 that night, the southbound version of the Starlight will arrive at the 
refurbished Glendale station -- a thick-walled California Mission-style 
building that was originally built in the 1920s by Southern Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good alternative to the downtown station," Nebrensky, 36, said. 
</P>
<P>
On the platform, Kelly Hayman, 28, of Anderson is heading home with her 
8-year-old son, Steven. "I thought it would be different from the bus," she 
said. When asked what his favorite part of the train ride was, Steven replied, 
"the food." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Reynolds, a 92-year-old resident of Danville, is taking his first train 
trip in 50 years, having come down a few days before "just for the pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to adventure one more time before I called it quits," he said while 
standing in the small but well-kept station just off San Fernando Road. "I can 
stand on the platform and see where I lived here until 1952." Looking at the 
train timetable on the wall, he shakes his head. "I remember when there were a 
lot more trains." DAVID LUSTIG

-- "Rhett, you never give me credit for anything" -- may no longer hold true. 
To mark the 50th anniversary of the legendary movie and the eve of its 
re-premiere, Rhett Butler is finally "giving credit" -- with a Gone With the 
Wind MasterCard. Issued by the Citizens and Southern National Bank in Atlanta, 
the cards will be reissued every two years with a different scene reproduced 
from movie stills. The four-card collection will consist of a 1989-91 50th 
anniversary issue with a specially designed commemorative symbol, and scenes of 
Scarlett and her beloved Tara, Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, and a Rhett and 
Scarlet profile.

Conditions Set for Spielberg: Venezuela has granted Steven Spielberg the rights 
to film in a fragile ecosystem but set conditions that Venezuelan officials say 
the Hollywood producer may not accept. Spielberg is trying to win the rights to 
film 30 days worth of scenes in a projected Walt Disney film entitled 
"Aracniphobia" in the restricted and fragile Gran Sabana area of southern 
Venezuela. It is home to dozens of plant and animal species that occur nowhere 
else on the planet, said environment ministry spokesman Luis Gonzalez. Although 
approving the film shoot, environment ministry officials set the following 
conditions: Certain scenes must be filmed from the air only; only a limited 
amount of personnel and equipment will be allowed into the area; overnight 
stays in the area are prohibited, and the film company must hand over an 
audio-visual record of their activities to the environment ministry. No date 
has been set for the projected shoot, and "so far there is no word whether the 
film company will accept the restrictions," Gonzalez said. SHAUNA SNOW

Orbison Tribute Concert Planned: Roy Orbison's widow, Barbara, marked the first 
anniversary of the singer's Dec. 6, 1988 death by announcing a benefit tribute 
concert to be held at the Universal Amphitheatre on Feb. 24. Performers are yet 
to be announced, but some if not all of Orbison's former Traveling Wilburys 
band mates (Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne) are expected 
to be among the performers. The concert -- planned as a live pay-per-view 
television and national radio broadcast event -- will benefit several 
organizations helping the homeless. SHAUNA SNOW

Washington Director Resigns: Jock Reynolds, director of the Washington Project 
for the Arts for the last six years and a key player in the summer censorship 
controversy that gripped the National Endowment for the Arts, resigned Thursday 
to become director of the Addison Gallery of American Art on the campus of 
Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. Officials said Reynolds, who had been at the 
Addison Gallery on sabbatical since September, had quit to explore new 
challenges at Phillips Academy, of which he is a graduate. Earlier this year, 
Reynolds and WPA accepted a show of work by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe 
after Washington's Corcoran Gallery of Art canceled it in an ill-fated attempt 
at political appeasement of conservatives in Congress. SHAUNA SNOW

HUBBARD STREET ADDS ANGST TO ITS REPERTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cute, zany, entertaining -- and, with its typically "Pink Panther" choreography 
on tap, the Hubbard Street Dance Company came across exactly as intended 
Tuesday at the Smothers Theatre, Pepperdine University: as marketers of slinky 
bravura with a consuming desire to please crowds. 
</P>
<P>
While supple bodies and extroversion were de rigueur for the familiar 
disco-jazz routines inspired by artistic director Lou Conte, not all the 
dancers could deliver the ultimate panache needed -- a point understandably 
ignored by an audience seized with the sheer physicality of tightly controlled, 
rhythmic routines. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chicagoans, now in their 11th year, had greater success with the 
program's newer works, journeys into the nihilism of serious contemporary dance 
that demanded less virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
Margo Sappington's 1987 "Step Out of Love," for instance, set a quintet of 
women, suffering a kind of street-corner nervousness, against a hard-rock 
score. Distinctly in an MTV vein, the piece is made of flimsy stuff -- little 
more than jerks and spasms, slides and grinds, flailings and spinnings. 
Packaged as a smoky subterranean excursion, though, it has the easy appeal that 
is the company's trademark. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Ezralow's 1989 "Super Straight," on the other hand, stepped somewhat 
away from this standard. With its ear-battering industrial noise (a score by 
Tom Willems, William Forsythe's favorite composer), its dancers in street wear 
and its material a series of somnolent struts, floor writhings, and 
confrontational stances, a true sense of urban Angst emerged. 
</P>
<P>
Even this, however, evolved into unison maneuvers -- thereby bearing the 
Hubbard Street seal. Couched among such favorites as the "Tango 
Argentino"-inspired "Cobras" and the big-band swing number, "The '40s," it did 
little to detract from the main show-biz thrust. And that's OK too. DONNA

STAGE BEAT: MONOLOGUES AT COMPANY OF ANGELS; 'WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?' AT 2ND 
STAGE; 'NIGHTMARE' AT BELIEVERS REP; 'CHATEAU' AT CALLBOARD; 'TOUR' AT CLUB 
WONG

<P>
The boundaries crossed in these two top-notch monologues at Company of Angels 
aren't fraught with danger, nor do they concern cataclysmic events. They are 
simple, human, affecting boundaries over which the two protagonists traverse in 
playing the best game they can with the cards they've been dealt. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Bailey's "Crowning Glory" concerns the non-steel magnolia who owns 
Annette's Beautyrama in an unspecified town presumably in the playwright's 
native Alabama. Annette is nice, in the best sense of the word. 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't even hold much anger for ex-husband Ray, who beat her up and then 
cut off the bountiful head of hair her mother called her "crowning glory." 
</P>
<P>
Annette even understands why the words don't appear in the Bible as she had 
always thought, because, after all, men wrote the Bible, and "men don't know 
much about hair. Or crowns. Or glory." So she wrote them in herself with an 
"ink pen." 
</P>
<P>
Actress Suanne Spoke is a delight as Annette discovering that on the other side 
of her early boundaries she can be self-sufficient, fulfilled and happy. 
</P>
<P>
She's a charmer. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Colonomos' "The Waiting Room" is a deeper, richer piece of writing, and 
the performance of Joan Darling as a woman in her 50s, visiting her autistic 
husband at his hospital to deliver an unsettling piece of news, is a gem. 
</P>
<P>
Ethel Rosen really loves Melvin and always has. She encouraged him in business 
and totally shared his love for their daughter Thelma. But Ethel has never been 
able to understand his withdrawal from reality, just because of the one 
failure, the bankruptcy which cost him his business. 
</P>
<P>
Now she has something important to tell him, that she is about to cross her own 
boundary to rejoin the living -- and the loving. It is a difficult dramatic 
transition handled by Darling with ease and finesse. Even Ethel's thoughtful 
silences are rich in the detail of this fine characterization. 
</P>
<P>
Both pieces are directed with insight into what makes women tick by Mary Lou 
Belli, who understands that a moment of quiet can be as dramatic as a crack of 
thunder. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2106 Hyperion Ave., Silver Lake, today and Saturday, 7 and 9 p.m.; ends 
Sunday, 2 p.m. Tickets: $10; (213) 664-6598. 
</P>
<P>
'What Can I Tell You?' 
</P>
<P>
What can I tell you? Siobhan Fallon is a very funny lady. 
</P>
<P>
In her evening of one-woman sketches at 2nd Stage she manages to explore the 
same territory Lily Tomlin and Whoopi Goldberg inhabit with equally funny 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Fallon's art is characterization, and that's exactly what allows her to use 
some well-worn cliches as springboards and make them look brand new. Her Valley 
girl clone of "High School Harmony" erases memories of lesser Valley girls, 
just as her platitude spouting, time conscious group therapist gives a new 
comic edge to that stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
Each of her sketches springs from an unerring comic sense. Fallon thinks funny, 
therefore she is. There is heart behind her humor. In a business surfeited with 
unfunny would-be comics, she's an original. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6500 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood, today through Sunday only, 8 p.m. 
Tickets: $9.99; (213) 874-9399. 
</P>
<P>
'A Waitress Nightmare' 
</P>
<P>
Scratch a waiter or waitress and you'll probably find an actor. Apparently you 
might even find a playwright. In "A Waitress Nightmare" at Believers Repertory, 
Nancy D'Aleo puts her experiences to use in a slight sitcom about a contest 
between waitresses in the coffee shop of the Swaying Palms Hotel (at least 
Janet Stout's costumes say coffee shop). 
</P>
<P>
It's not a high-class joint (mustard instead of horseradish is served with the 
roast beef) and it's not a very high-class comedy. Although her characters are 
well drawn (Christina Miller as a dyed-in-the-wool Baptist who lies about being 
a writer, and Leslie Brooks as a new mother with a lactating fixation stand 
out) they mostly just sit around and schmooze. 
</P>
<P>
Bekah Dannelley's direction is bright enough to catch most of the humor but not 
deep enough to erase the feeling that a commercial is just around the corner. 
Larry G. Welch almost saves the evening with a spiraling comic performance as 
the frenetic kooky cook Flash. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9025 Cynthia St., West Hollywood, Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., 
indefinitely. Tickets: $7; (213) 463-6480. 
</P>
<P>
'Chateau in Sweden' 
</P>
<P>
Author-playwright Francoise Sagan has cast her certain smile on many an odd 
situation in her work and doesn't stint in her examination of the definitely 
odd goings-on at this definitely odd chateau in Sweden. A number of interesting 
Gallic theater pieces have been presented by producer Yasmine Golchan and this 
strange comedy at Callboard Theatre is another apt choice. 
</P>
<P>
Sagan borrows the sexual games of "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" and a bit of 
Pirandello (an actor jumps out of the action into the audience to cries of 
"unfair"). It is all very stylish and theatrical, though its staging here tries 
to deny the fact, under Pierre de Moro's plodding, insensitive direction. His 
company is decidedly American and doesn't have the delicacy the work demands. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Armstrong as the sister who owns the chateau, Robert Snively as the 
tippling butler and Patrick Hauser as the sexual dupe from Stockholm come 
closest to the sincerity, if not the spirit, of Sagan's writing. But the others 
are doing Preston Sturges. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8451 Melrose Place, West Hollywood, Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; 
Sundays, 7 p.m.; through Dec. 17. Tickets: $15; (213) 466-1767. 
</P>
<P>
'Comeback Tour' 
</P>
<P>
Fifties' blond starlet Peggy Judy is making her comeback at the Club Wong, 
where she began her illustrious career many years ago (her resume includes such 
films as "Cigarette Girls From Hell" and "The Thing With Two Backs"). She is 
accompanied by her lounge lizard ex-husband Buddy Judy and her two dancing 
boys, exiles from the San Francisco Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
That's the joke. There isn't much more than that in this mercifully brief 
evening, filled out with weak satires of dingy club performances and cliched 
Hollywood ribs. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Magnuson and Don Oscar Smith get the biggest laughs as the backup dancers 
("special choreography" by Geoffrey Webb and Corky Omine is really laughable). 
</P>
<P>
 At 2106 Hyperion Ave., Silver Lake, today and Saturday only, 10:30 p.m. 
Tickets: $6; (213) 653-5871.

<TEXT>
<P>
South Coast Repertory has transformed the time-encrusted mythology of "A 
Christmas Carol" into a sprightly, well-turned comedy with an Ebenezer Scrooge 
who doesn't have a mean bone in his body. 
</P>
<P>
Scrooge is a penny-pinching grumbler, of course. And virtually everybody on 
stage either says he's a meanie or treats him like one. But we don't believe it 
for a minute. We're not meant to. Not in this version. For no matter how bony 
Scrooge's face, how chilly his words, how miserly his deeds, Scrooge is a 
comic. This news should come as no surprise to SCR regulars. Hal Landon Jr. has 
played him this way every year since 1980, and John-David Keller has directed 
the show for as many silly laughs as it can get. 
</P>
<P>
The result happens to be highly entertaining, especially for a family audience. 
But it is not Dickens. It misses the pathos of the story and its emotional 
impact. Furthermore, while Jerry Patch's adaptation conveys the basic message 
that kindness and charity are to be valued, the moral of the story is 
dangerously oversimplified. 
</P>
<P>
Every kid in the audience, and probably some parents, may well be persuaded 
that the inverse of the moral is true. By play's end, Scrooge discovers that 
money is the root of all good, as long as he gives it away. Money buys love. 
Money buys happiness. Money, more than generosity, remains his form of 
salvation. 
</P>
<P>
However, there can be no faulting the production for its liveliness, freshness 
and technical polish. It moves swiftly, yet without sacrificing too much 
detail. The acting is crisp and particular. Party scenes are radiant, with 
minor roles filled out beautifully. The music is warm, the costumes authentic. 
And the special effects, while vivid, are not overplayed. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, this "Christmas Carol" has the great virtue of not being boring, 
which cannot be said for many cultural rites of passage. It certainly works as 
a first taste of theater and may whet a child's appetite for the real Dickens. 
</P>
<P>
 At 655 Town Center Drive in Costa Mesa, Tuesdays through Saturdays, 7:30 p.m. 
with matinees Saturdays at 2:30 and Sundays at noon and 4 p.m. Performances 
Dec. 19 and 21 will be at 2:30 p.m. Ends Dec. 24. Tickets: $20-$22, less for 
children younger than 12; (714) 957-4033.

' 'TIS THE SEASON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A couple of Santa Clauses appear and holiday decorations festoon the barroom 
setting of Actors Forum's Yuletide offering, " 'Tis the Season." But though the 
"Inn Place" is crowded with people who apparently have no other place to 
celebrate, the show really has little to do with Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"Season" is willing to celebrate, but its spirit is weak. The production is a 
loosely connected series of sitcom vignettes that are intent on poking fun at 
current mores and manners. Much of the material is old hat, including a couple 
of Tom Lehrer parodies and the three-decade-old chestnut about the foul-mouthed 
nun slugging down double vodkas (finally unveiled as a fugitive from "The Sound 
of Music"). 
</P>
<P>
The performances are generally energetic and well defined, and some of the 
material (by Roger Karshner, Martha Singer, Valarie Woods and J. C. Curtiss) 
looks as though it might benefit from expansion into longer forms, but the 
one-joke structure of most of the sketches defeats the hearty efforts of the 
company and Curtiss' bright direction. 
</P>
<P>
Notable in the amiable but aimless evening are Shawne Rowe and Lily Tanner-Macy 
as two girls discussing the pros and cons of abortion, and the sharp portraits 
of two brothers bemoaning the passing of the easy '70s in "Safe Sex," with 
strong performances by Vince Palmieri and Steven Rosenbaum indicating the piece 
might make an interesting longer one-act. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Allen provides a beautifully shaded comic performance as a friendly 
type denying she's trying to pick up a sharpie (Shawn Michaels) while she's 
actually doing it. These performances are the brightest ornaments on Actors 
Forum's Christmas effort. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3365 1/2 Cahuenga Blvd. West; Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.; through Dec.

Margaret Honda, a young San Diego artist, is intrigued with "found" structures. 
Her "Traps" are precisely that: mechanical devices used by fishermen and 
trappers. These are modest objects made with the honest materials (wood and 
metal, mostly) and austere, clean-lined silhouettes that get good marks in 
contemporary art. They are also, of course, instruments of killing. In precise, 
matter-of-fact descriptions -- surely as important as the three-dimensional 
components -- Honda explains how each of the seven pieces achieves its ends. 
</P>
<P>
We've been brainwashed with the notion that the utilitarian objects of many 
cultures also have strikingly "aesthetic" aspects; Honda stands this truism on 
its head. The traps are attractive tools, admirable for their elegant 
combination of simple physics and time-tested observation. But they also have a 
deadly power. The canniest viewer-traps are the trickiest looking pieces, like 
"Deadfall," a pair of boards propped at a 45-degree angle with a delicate 
rigging of bamboo, bait wire and tin tack, or "Box Snare," in which airy curls 
of wire prove to be coldly efficient nooses. 
</P>
<P>
The real zinger in this work is its tacit invitation to contemplate the 
mysterious ways of animal and human psychology -- not only those of trapper and 
beast but also that of the viewer, who is enticed (via alluringly 
"contemporary" forms) to investigate the relationship between the hunter and 
his prey. (Saxon-Lee Gallery, 7525 Beverly Blvd., to Jan. 6.) CATHY CURTIS

<TEXT>
<P>
The German sculptor Eberhard Bosslet makes works from unaltered industrial 
materials arranged with elegance and conceptual complexity. They separate from 
current post modern objects intended to remind us that traditional art is dead. 
On the contrary, Bosslet enlivens industrial detritus by subjecting it to the 
rules of classical geometric art. 
</P>
<P>
Bosslet arranges old file cabinet drawers so that they form three-dimensional 
rectangles. Bits of blond raw wood act as physical and visual buffers between 
drawers, tacky yellow industrial paint on facings acts as colored accents, and 
mechanical grooves cast in the metal become pure pictorial devices. Held 
together by flat metal strapping laced around drawers in equidistant bands, the 
structures form Mondrian arrangements executed with a cultivated sensitivity to 
chromatic and structural weights and balances. 
</P>
<P>
He also composes tightly ordered, site specific "towers" that extend from the 
gallery floor to the ceiling rafters via long metal tubes set on rough hewn 
brick bases. Aping the look of weight bearing architecture, dotted with fake 
bolts and fittings meticulously staged but having no function, the towers 
address the myth of the machine, and force our awareness of the space they 
occupy. 
</P>
<P>
Bosslet's queer objects never escape superficial associations with totems, 
sacred covenant arcs, secret maps, but at their core is a deeper interest in 
the concept of ordered work in all its manifestations. Brick and metal suggest 
the step by step drudgery of physical labor; file cabinets suggest bureaucratic 
labor; while the labor of making art, Bosslet seems to say, involves literally 
"pulling apart" the everyday and rearranging its components into some higher 
order of information. (Karl Bornstein, 1658 1/2 10th St., to Dec. 30.) MARLENA

In Eastern Europe, news of contemporary Western art generally comes 
second-hand, via illustrations in books and magazines. So perhaps it isn't 
surprising that Bulgarian artist Tzveti Kirov's figurative paintings -- with 
titles like "Treadmill to Oblivion" and "Blind Ambition" -- have a dated 
quality. Most of Kirov's works -- shown for the first time in the United States 
-- feature a blurred, fragmentary male figure rushing blindly to some unknown 
destination. His face and body are twisted and compacted, and empty space 
whistles through his torso. 
</P>
<P>
Colorful arrows, "twinkling" hatch marks borrowed from commercial illustration 
and the curving lines cartoonists use to show movement dance ironically around 
these hollow men. Some have companions: impassive women with apple cheeks and 
ample figures, nude or clothed, who cohabit interiors liable to funnel backward 
suddenly or flip around in a maniacal curve. 
</P>
<P>
Kirov's combination of '50s-style Angst and '60s-style commercial art 
borrowings doesn't quite come off, at least in the context of contemporary 
Western art. But it does have the authentic tang of ironic commentary on a 
muddled and frantic society that wants answers as simple and easy to follow as 
the arrows on a diagram. It's a pity the gallery sees fit to prop up paintings 
on silly gilt easels, which make even serious, intelligently conceived art look 
like kitsch. (Gene Sinser Gallery, 331 N. Larchmont Blvd., to Dec. 23.) CATHY

Lee Kaplan's clever, relentlessly analytical works take on big issues in 
contemporary culture. Of course, you have to know the territory -- or read up 
on it. "The Subjects of the Artist" consists of 15 color prints of Japanese 
textile patterns. On each panel, silk-screened lettering spells out the 
yen-dollar equivalent on a particular date from 1958 (Kaplan's birth year) to 
1989. The dates have varied significance: major art auctions, events and places 
in Kaplan's life, the deaths of well-known people. 
</P>
<P>
Wrapping art-world and real-world events in the mantle of autobiography, the 
piece is essentially a look at the commercial side of the art world during the 
past 33 years. The dominance of the Japanese market for Western art is linked 
to the dominance of the yen; the hype surrounding Sotheby's 1973 auction of 
works from Robert Scull's collection is compared to the mega-hype surrounding 
Sotheby's record-breaking 1987 auction of Van Gogh's "Sunflowers" to a Japanese 
company. The title of the piece, taken from a museum retrospective of Abstract 
Expressionism -- a movement imbued with unbridled emotion and painterly drama 
-- also ironically applies to the dry, guarded approach to making art that 
Kaplan shares with many of his contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan poaches on the borders of Stephen Prina's territory in "Notes of a 
Painter (Luxe, Calme et Volupte)." Each of four aluminum rectangles is labeled 
with the title of a different Matisse painting and painted a single color 
evocative of that work. On the assumption that viewers who've grown up with 
modernism can get their jollies from mechanically produced swatches of pure 
color, Kaplan gives us the fast-read equivalent of the full-blown Fauve 
experience. Although the piece is more viewer-indulgent than Prina's work, 
Kaplan's approach still -- perhaps unwittingly -- serves as a touchstone for 
the new Puritanism in art, in which the eye must be satisfied with meager 
rewards while the mind is urged toward the greater glory of theory. (Jan Baum 
Gallery, 170 S. La Brea, to Dec. 29.) CATHY CURTIS

FAMILY COPES WITH THE QUAKE ON 'FULL HOUSE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tonight's episode of ABC's comedy "Full House" finds the Tanner family dealing 
with emotional aftershocks from the Oct. 17 Bay Area earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"The show is set in San Francisco, and we didn't want to pretend the earthquake 
hadn't happened," said Jeff Franklin, the series' creator and executive 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
"Children all across the country saw the earthquake footage. We wanted to try 
to help with their anxieties by showing the effect the earthquake had on the 
Tanner family." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin co-wrote the "Aftershocks" episode with Lenny Ripps, using input from 
trauma experts at the UCLA School of Medicine. The program airs at 8 p.m. on 
Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42. 
</P>
<P>
In the show, 7-year-old Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) suddenly can't bear to be 
separated from her dad (Bob Saget), even at bedtime. Dad becomes increasingly 
concerned, not knowing what's wrong. A visit to a family therapist brings 
Stephanie's fears into the open and even offers a sensitive alternative to 
Stephanie's crawling into Dad's bed for reassurance. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin explained in an interview that he wanted to address several issues. 
</P>
<P>
"The episode is a reminder about earthquake preparedness, it's a look at how 
scary these things can be for children and it's a reminder to parents that if 
they encounter a problem with a child that they don't have the answer for, it's 
good parenting to get some help." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin also likes the idea of putting his show "in the real world." 
</P>
<P>
"Our show is seen by millions of viewers," he said, "and we're aware of the 
tremendous impact we can have on young people. So, of course, we try to do 
shows that entertain, but we also want to give viewers something to think 
about." 
</P>
<P>
The show is special to Franklin for another reason. Erin McKnelly, a 7-year-old 
with cystic fibrosis, plays a small role. Franklin cast her after hearing 
through the Starlight Foundation -- an organization that tries to grant the 
wishes of seriously ill children -- that McKnelly wanted to be "a movie star."

ARSON SUSPECT SEIZED IN $5-MILLION BLAZE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: FLAMES DESTROY A CONTROVERSIAL CONDO PROJECT IN PASADENA. A LAID-OFF 
CONSTRUCTION WORKER IS ARRESTED AS HE WATCHES INVESTIGATORS FROM ACROSS THE 
STREET. 
</P>

<P>
A laid-off construction worker was arrested Thursday in a $5-million arson fire 
that destroyed a controversial Pasadena condominium project under construction 
and heavily damaged an adjacent townhouse complex, forcing 30 people from their 
homes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Loxson, 26, of South Pasadena was arrested Thursday morning across the 
street from the fire scene at Orange Grove and Del Mar boulevards, where he had 
been watching arson investigators as they combed the rubble, Pasadena Fire 
Chief David Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
Loxson was booked for investigation of arson and remained in Pasadena City Jail 
in lieu of $10,000 bail. The arrest was based on conflicting statements Loxson 
made to fire investigators earlier in the day and the fact that he apparently 
matched eyewitness descriptions of a man seen running from the condominium 
project moments before it erupted in flames at 11:15 p.m. Wednesday, Leonard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The chief said that "the evidence we've collected shows definite signs of 
incendiary origin," including "signs of a flammable liquid" detected at the 
southeast corner of the half-completed project. He said the complex was the 
site of a minor arson blaze last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night's fire spread quickly to an adjacent 20-unit townhouse complex, 
destroying five units valued at $650,000 each, authorities said. Two other 
units sustained heavy water damage. Thirty residents were displaced, but no one 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The condominium project -- a three-story, eight-unit complex of $500,000 to 
$1-million residences in an exclusive west Pasadena neighborhood dominated by 
Victorian homes and stately mansions -- has been controversial from its 
inception, according to a former owner of a portion of the project site. 
</P>
<P>
"Residents opposed to it circulated petitions to prevent it from going up," 
said Kathleen Thorne-Thomsen, who sold a corner lot to developers. "They didn't 
want to see any other condos going up. They felt it would be a precedent for 
changing zoning in the area." 
</P>
<P>
Five months ago, voters passed the city's Growth Management Initiative, which 
set an annual ceiling of 250 new residential units citywide. The condominium 
project was exempted from the initiative because the property had already been 
subdivided, said Colin Lund, a Pasadena city planner. 
</P>
<P>
The project, the product of a business partnership, was being built by the 
Construction Group of Los Angeles. Robert Klein, a spokesman for the firm, 
would only say, "I have no idea who might have done this." 
</P>
<P>
Many residents reported hearing an explosion moments before flames engulfed the 
project and lighted up the night sky. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard an explosion I thought at first was an earthquake," said Robert Martin 
Sr., who lives two doors away from the construction site. "I saw a highly 
suspicious man running eastward to a car." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said the man entered the car and "took off without his lights on" as a 
security guard from nearby Ambassador College vainly gave chase on foot. The 
security guard could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Other witnesses reported seeing as many as three men running from the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Among the residents displaced by the fire was Katherine Morris, whose 
two-bedroom townhouse was gutted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gone. There's nothing left," said Morris, surveying the ruins of her 
home, which she said contained several original Picasso paintings and pencil 
drawings worth "hundreds of thousands of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview before his arrest, Loxson said he was one of seven construction 
workers relieved of their jobs at the construction site last Friday -- the same 
day a small arson fire caused $5,000 damage to some stairwells and a wall. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard they tried to start three fires in three stairwells," said Loxson, who 
described himself as a carpenter who had worked on the project for six months. 
</P>
<P>
The complex was scheduled for completion sometime in March, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Loxson said he was not very upset about being laid off because his duties were 
nearly completed. 
</P>
<P>
"I took it as it is," Loxson said. "Framers are a dime a dozen." 
</P>
<P>
The other workers, however, took it a little harder, Loxson contended. 
</P>
<P>
"They were bummed out. It's Christmas time and they were upset," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One of Loxson's co-workers, Scotty Adelhelm, 24, said authorities were wrong to 
suspect that Loxson was involved in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"He has alibis," Adelhelm said. "He was with us until 6 p.m. drinking beer in 
the mountains. He was with his wife and kid after that." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand anything that's going on right now," Loxson's wife, Terri, 
said, fighting back tears. "He didn't do it. He was home both nights. That's 
all I have to say." 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, Loxson is the only suspect, although the investigation is 
continuing, authorities said.

BILL BOYARSKY: ONE REPORTER WHO MADE A DIFFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three deaths this winter had an impact on Los Angeles journalism. 
</P>
<P>
You've heard a lot about two of them, the closing of the Los Angeles Herald 
Examiner and the death of Bill Stout, commentator for television station KCBS. 
The third was the death of someone less well-known, Joyce Peterson, who had 
spent many years covering City Hall and the county Hall of Administration for 
City News Service and the Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper and the two journalists helped shaped the public perception of 
government actions and, at times, the actions themselves. That happens when 
news coverage impels officials to do something: For example, public reaction to 
stories on the homeless freezing forces government to build shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Stout and the Herald were highly visible players in this process. The Herald 
spurred things with its choice of stories, many of them then pursued by 
competing papers. Stout, a populist with a big-city manner, prodded officials 
with acerbic commentaries. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson, who was retired from journalism at the time of her death, illustrated 
another, less visible part of the process. She engaged in the daily grind of 
journalism, examining the agendas of City Council and the county supervisors, 
running from meeting to meeting, gathering quotes, and turning out three, four 
or five stories a day. 
</P>
<P>
A glamorous job? Nope. But more influential than you might expect. 
</P>
<P>
I met her when I was a local government reporter. Like many of us, Peterson was 
driven by obsessive curiosity and a competitive desire to get the story first. 
And she was tricky. 
</P>
<P>
After a news event, she'd say, "This was really boring." At first, I thought 
this meant she wasn't going to write the story, and I didn't have to, either. 
But she always did write and my editors always saw it. I learned that the 
meaning of "this was really boring" was that she was trying to steer me from 
the story. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson was a talented, respected reporter who worked against considerable 
odds. Her sight was so bad that she couldn't drive. She took the bus to work. 
When she wrote, her eyes were inches away from the typewriter and, later, the 
computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
She waited in hallways for hours for some public official to come out and lie 
to her about what had transpired behind closed doors. Then she'd make many 
phone calls to determine the extent of the lie. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't a nice way to make a living. Few people other than cops or sales 
people would put up with the waiting. Several years ago, for example, my boss 
ordered me to the County Hall of Administration to verify a tip that a county 
supervisor was dying of cancer. His family and staff were trying to keep it a 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor's chief assistant said he wouldn't talk to me. I said I'd wait. 
I had newspapers to read and plenty of time. I sat in the waiting room for two 
days, waiting long enough to get an answer that satisfied my editor. 
</P>
<P>
You might ask, what's the purpose of such behavior? 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the supervisor, it was important because the sick man's friends 
were trying to line up a successor before his death to assure continued county 
favoritism for industries in the district. Constituents deserved to know what 
was going on. They might have wanted someone else. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson made her impact on government in a subtle way. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, reporters at City Hall and the County Hall of Administration are 
confronted with meeting agendas that are several pages long. In addition, there 
are press conferences and unscheduled events. It's an overwhelming amount of 
work and reporters cannot cover it all. So each reporter picks and chooses. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say the mayor is holding a press conference to promote recycling. Since 
he already announced his recycling program last week, this one is not covered. 
On the other hand, there's a vote coming in the council's Police Committee 
about more police foot patrols. Everyone's concerned about crime. That's the 
one that will be covered. That's the news the public will get. 
</P>
<P>
When Peterson worked for City News Service, her decisions were particularly 
important. City News Service distributes stories to papers and broadcast 
stations, and tips them off on coming events. If Peterson made an event sound 
intriguing, television cameras might also cover it. Or all-news radio stations 
might dispatch a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Part of what influenced her was her belief in the public's right to know. But 
much of it was intangible -- what was hot, or at least sounded hot to her. Her 
decisions were also shaped by what other events were occurring in the news and 
how much time she had. 
</P>
<P>
In this way, rank-and-file reporters like Peterson make news decisions that 
determine what goes into the papers, and what is seen on television or heard on 
the radio. From that often comes public outrage and political action. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Peterson was a valuable part of that process and she'll be missed.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HIGH SMOG LEVELS IN 5 CITIES TO BE STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two anti-smog agencies and an American auto maker launched a study this week to 
find out why an area of southeastern Los Angeles County that includes the 
cities of Lynwood, Compton, Bell, South Gate and Huntington Park has carbon 
monoxide levels more than double those in the rest of the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, carbon monoxide levels in the area exceeded federal health standards 
on 51 days, said Bill Kelly, spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District. The Southland area with the second-highest carbon monoxide 
levels is right next door, starting in Hawthorne and extending south to San 
Pedro and northwest to Marina Del Rey. Kelly said that area violated the 
federal standard on only 26 days. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD, the state Air Resources Board, and General Motors Corp. are paying 
for the three-month, $510,000 study.

NEIGHBOR ARRESTED IN SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to a report of a woman's scream, Covina police arrived at a 
residential complex on Prospero Drive to discover the body of Alexandria 
Hickman, 24, sprawled on her bedroom floor in apartment 4. She had been stabbed 
to death. 
</P>
<P>
Then, seeking a possible witness, investigators went next door to apartment 3. 
The tenant did not answer. After learning that she had not shown up for work, 
officers broke down the apartment door. Inside, they found the body of 
42-year-old Deborah Converse. She, too, had died of multiple stab wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Six hours later, the man who lived in apartment 5, on the other side of 
Hickman, 24-year-old Martin Anthony Navarette, was in custody, booked for 
investigation of the two murders. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said Thursday that they still have not determined a motive for the 
slayings, which occurred early Wednesday. But they said Navarette had recently 
been picked up on suspicion of burglary and several guns were believed missing 
from Converse's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors, who asked that their names not be used, said Navarette had moved 
into the modest, 8-unit complex on the quiet residential street last August. 
</P>
<P>
"He was always in trouble with the police," one of them said. 
</P>
<P>
The same neighbors described the murder victims -- both of whom lived alone -- 
as "kind, quiet people who were nice to the kids and everyone else who lived 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to believe something like that could happen here," a neighbor said. 
"We're all kind of walking around in a daze." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gil Leslie of the Los Angeles County sheriff's homicide division, which was 
called in to assist in the investigation, said the murders were discovered 
after Covina police got a call at about 3:30 a.m. Wednesday from a man who 
lived in the apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he heard a woman screaming and the sound of breaking glass," Leslie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The arriving officers said they were directed to apartment 4, where they found 
Hickman's body. 
</P>
<P>
"There were signs of a struggle," Leslie said. "A window at the back had been 
broken." 
</P>
<P>
The search for witnesses led to Converse's next-door apartment. The woman 
didn't answer the door, but Covina police said that Converse, nervous about a 
burglary at her apartment the day before in which a videocassette recorder had 
been stolen, had told friends she might not spend the night in her home. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie said detectives checked with Converse's employer, a Pasadena auto 
dealer, asking that they be informed when she arrived for her job as a service 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
"When she didn't show up, we decided we should be concerned," Leslie said. 
</P>
<P>
At 2 p.m. Wednesday, sheriff's investigators broke down the door to apartment 
3. Like Hickman, Converse was found sprawled in her bedroom. But, unlike 
Hickman, deputies said that Converse appeared to have been sexually molested. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie said initial tests indicated that Converse died shortly after midnight. 
Hickman apparently died about three hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses said they saw a man running from the front of Hickman's 
apartment moments after the screams and the sound of the breaking glass. 
</P>
<P>
According to Leslie, their descriptions of the man closely resembled Navarette, 
who lives next door to Hickman with his girlfriend and their two children. 
Leslie said that when officers questioned the girlfriend, she told them 
Navarette had not slept there that night. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect did not show up for his job at a paint company Wednesday morning, 
according to detectives. 
</P>
<P>
"That night, at about 8 o'clock, we found him at his mother's home in Covina," 
Leslie said. "He was arrested without incident." 
</P>
<P>
The officers said Navarette, who was ordered held without bail, had been 
released over the weekend after being arrested last week on suspicion of 
burglary.

STATE PANEL GIVES OK TO DOWNTOWN PRISON OVER EASTSIDE PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the objections of Eastside residents and activists, a three-member 
state panel Thursday approved an environmental impact report for a proposed 
1,450-bed state prison in the southeast corner of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-1 vote by the EIR certification panel of the state Department of 
Corrections was the last major administrative hurdle in the 4 1/2-year struggle 
to put the controversial facility on a 20-acre site just west of the 
concrete-paved Los Angeles River. Construction could begin as early as summer. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents, who contend the prison would pose a threat to predominantly 
Latino communities east of the river, vowed to go to court to stop the 
$139-million project. A legal challenge could delay the project several more 
years, state officials acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"The fat lady hasn't sung yet," said Father John Moretta of the Mothers of East 
L.A., a grass-roots group that opposes the prison. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Democratic Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, in whose district 
the prison would be built, said: "Here's another project that we don't need. I 
get madder the more I think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Bitter debate has dogged the issue since Gov. George Deukmejian, responding to 
complaints that Los Angeles County contributes about 40% of the state's prison 
inmates but is home to no state prison, proposed a medium-security facility for 
an industrial lot near 12th Street and Santa Fe Avenue in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Latino politicians, led by state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), immediately 
criticized the location, arguing that Boyle Heights and other Eastside 
communities were close to five other penal institutions and have been the 
"dumping ground" for other unwanted public projects. 
</P>
<P>
To mollify critics in the Democratic-controlled Legislature, Deukmejian 
supported a Senate bill authorizing construction of two prisons in the county 
-- one in the downtown area and the other in mostly rural Lancaster. It swiftly 
became law, but that did little to quiet Eastside prison opponents. 
</P>
<P>
An initial environmental impact report on the proposed downtown prison was 
rejected in March by the state review panel, which asked for more analysis on 
property values near the site. 
</P>
<P>
The report was augmented to answer the panel's concerns, but debate this week 
again focused on arguments that the Eastside already has too many jails. At the 
daylong hearing Wednesday, more than 20 speakers asked the panel to reject the 
planned prison. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Giron, an eighth-grader at a Roman Catholic elementary school in Boyle 
Heights, told of her fear at seeing armed sheriff's deputies appearing on 
campus about four years ago to look for an escapee from nearby County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were to live in this community," she said, "you would be scared, too. 
Why is it that this community always gets the negative things, like the 
prisons?" 
</P>
<P>
Panel member David E. Bess, a professor of urban planning at Cal Poly Pomona 
who cast the deciding vote to certify the report, said he personally opposed 
the prison site, but reluctantly concluded that the river was a sufficient 
buffer zone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terribly compelling argument," he said of statements like Giron's. 
"(But) I wasn't convinced that there was a threat to these children." 
</P>
<P>
Bess added that the report had sufficient information for James Rowland, the 
head of the Corrections Department, to make his expected decision to proceed 
with the prison. 
</P>
<P>
Bess said the panel was "narrowly charged" with ruling on the adequacy of the 
environmental document and not with deciding whether the site is appropriate 
for a prison. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence M. Eagan, the governor's appointee on the panel, joined Bess in voting 
for the EIR. 
</P>
<P>
Robert H. Twiss, a UC Berkeley professor of environmental planning and the 
panel's chairman, voted against the report, saying it was inadequate.

UNOCAL DRAWS FINE UNDER TOUGH NEW POLLUTION LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unocal Corp. was convicted Thursday under a new state environmental law and 
ordered to pay $23,500 in fines for an air pollution violation at its 
Wilmington refinery that nearby residents said caused nausea, burning eyes and 
headaches. 
</P>
<P>
The fine, meted out by Municipal Court Commissioner Joseph Spada following a 
no-contest plea by the oil company, marked the first time that the new state 
law has been used in Los Angeles to impose higher than usual financial 
penalties. The law took effect last January. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a $1,000 maximum fine per violation under the earlier law -- which 
remains on the books -- Unocal was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine, plus $13,500 
in court costs, for a single violation. 
</P>
<P>
"The big difference is that the new law adds the negligence factor and provides 
for an enhanced penalty," City Atty. James K. Hahn said. "We charged Unocal 
with negligence because refinery officials, by exercising proper care, could 
have detected and prevented the release of the toxic odors to the nearby 
community." 
</P>
<P>
The penalty stems from an incident last Feb. 7 when hydrogen sulfide and 
mercaptans were accidentally released as the refinery workers transferred a 
liquid from a refinery tank into a vacuum truck during a cleaning operation. 
</P>
<P>
Area residents, including students and teachers at nearby Taper Avenue 
Elementary School and the San Pedro Science Center, said they suffered nausea, 
burning eyes, headaches and respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
In high enough concentrations, hydrogen sulfide can be extremely toxic, even 
fatal. When concentrations become that high, they cannot be smelled. At lower 
concentrations, hydrogen sulfide can be smelled. Mercaptans are sulfur 
compounds found naturally in crude oil, and also give off a foul odor. 
</P>
<P>
"They are capable of producing the symptoms that were noted," Unocal spokesman 
Jeff Callender said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal pleaded no contest to one of the two air pollution violations that 
reportedly occurred Feb. 7. No charges were pressed in the second incident that 
day, or in another reported on April 13, Callender said. 
</P>
<P>
Callender said Thursday that the company has since purchased pollution control 
equipment "so there's no chance of this recurring." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said Thursday's fine marked the second time in nine months that Unocal has 
been convicted of violating air pollution laws. He said that last March the 
company admitted releasing pollutants into the atmosphere from a refinery 
stack. It paid $5,100 in fines and assessments for three violations. In 
addition, Unocal agreed to pay $70,000 to the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District's alternative energy research program.

ARMENIANS PRAY FOR QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Armenians in Los Angeles County gathered in their churches Thursday to 
commemorate the devastating earthquake that struck their homeland a year ago, 
immediately killing 26,000. Thousands more died later from injuries or disease 
and more than 520,000 were left homeless, leaders of the local Armenian 
community said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a need to recognize this tragedy that has befallen us," said Garen 
Yegparian, executive director of the Armenian National Committee's Western 
Region. "There is also this sense of the series of tragedies that has befallen 
the Armenian people in this century." 
</P>
<P>
Yegparian said those tragedies include what they refer to as the 1915-1923 
genocide when 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Turks, atrocities against 
Armenians during the Stalin era and the more recent suppression of dissent in 
Soviet Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
"Armenians have a tremendous will to overcome, survive and re-establish 
ourselves," Yegparian said. 
</P>
<P>
His Holiness Vasken I, Catholicos of All Armenians, directed Armenian churches 
to ring their bells at 11:43 a.m. Thursday to observe the anniversary. Armenian 
churches in Los Angeles County held morning and evening services to remember 
the tragedy.

'UNO MAS' IS TOO MUCH FOR DURAN; 
</P>
<P>
FIGHT: SUGAR RAY LEONARD WINS UNANIMOUS DECISION WITH BOXING CLINIC THAT 
OUTCLASSES OPPONENT AND DRAWS BOOS FROM CROWD.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sugar Ray Leonard took Roberto Duran to school Thursday night, boxing him silly 
and winning one of the easiest decisions of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard won by scores of 119-109, 116-111 and 120-110 on the judges' cards. It 
was a one-sided, almost boring bout that left a sellout crowd of 16,305 booing 
at the finish. It was difficult to tell if they were booing the bout or Duran, 
who raised his hands as a victor at the final bell and was lifted into the air 
by cornermen. 
</P>
<P>
But at the postfight news conference, Duran really wore out his welcome, 
claiming he won the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I won, I thought I outpointed him," he said, to several hundred 
disbelieving reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"No mas!" someone yelled. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Duran and his people were just happy he made it to the finish on his 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to describe Leonard's 36th career victory in praiseworthy 
fashion, since he fought a guy who couldn't counterpunch, jab, get in a 
straight right, or even, on two occasions, find his own corner. 
</P>
<P>
This was not the Duran of the 1970s. No snarls or sneers. He was almost 
submissive. He fought with an impassive face. 
</P>
<P>
At Montreal in 1980, Duran savagely assaulted Leonard. Punches came from 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, Roberto Duran wasn't even a pest. 
</P>
<P>
Those looking to wake up the echoes from Montreal didn't even get a pantomime. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard will earn a minimum of $15 million for what was one of the easiest 
victories of his $100-million career. Duran gets at least $7.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, who spent his time between rounds under a beige blanket in his corner, 
secure from the 60-degree air, set the tone for a mismatch in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard started out with constant lateral movement, Duran watching . . . as he 
would for all 12 rounds. Duran tried a lunging right hand midway through the 
round and Leonard blocked it. Then Leonard tagged Duran with a hard left jab, 
and rattled him with a left-right combination. Next were two long lead rights 
that landed on Duran's head, followed by two body shots. Leonard, who started 
Round 1 cautiously, quickly sized up his opponent. He finished the round freely 
hitting the Panamanian about the head and body, plainly the aggressor. 
</P>
<P>
That's how it went for 10 rounds -- Leonard boxing superbly, Duran failing to 
do much of anything. At times, Leonard was in such control that he appeared to 
be trying to goad Duran into quitting again, as he had in Leonard-Duran II, in 
New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
He stuck out his chin for Duran, who didn't even try to hit it, and faked a 
bolo punch several times. When Duran bought it, Leonard hit him with the jab. 
</P>
<P>
Duran (85-8-0) did most of his damage in the 11th round, when he landed a right 
hand that opened a cut above Leonard's left eye and sent blood streaming down 
Leonard's face. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard (36-1-1) finished the fight with an aerobics workout after bleeding 
from the mouth earlier in the bout. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard thus retained his World Boxing Council super-middleweight championship. 
There was a premature announcement Thursday morning that Duran's WBC 
middleweight championship might be at stake, too, since Leonard weighed in at 
160 and Duran 158, under the middleweight limit. 
</P>
<P>
The fight was contracted for at 162 pounds. Duran's people protested wildly at 
the suggestion Duran's middleweight title was going up for grabs, with good 
reason, as it turned out. 
</P>
<P>
Duran, who lost 34 of 36 rounds on three Times scorecards, really landed only 
two telling punches. One was a right hand midway through the second round that 
caught Leonard flush, but the impact came at the end of the punch. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the 11th-round right hand. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the third round, the pattern had been set. Leonard, all but 
unchallenged, operated with sharpness, far more so than he showed last June in 
the draw with Thomas Hearns. 
</P>
<P>
Duran couldn't even counter over Leonard's frequent jabs. Leonard barely needed 
to keep his right hand up to protect himself. Once, in the sixth, Leonard 
tripped over his feet, was wide open, and Duran couldn't get off a punch. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard was hitting Duran so effectively at the end of the third round that 
Duran couldn't find his corner at the bell. He went to the wrong one after the 
eighth, too. 
</P>
<P>
There were no knockdowns, but Leonard seemed on the verge of sending Duran to 
the canvas halfway through the sixth. Leonard hurt Duran in the corner with a 
big left hook, then hit him again seconds later with a straight right and a 
left hook. Then came two more long rights that landed flush on Duran's face. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard was making faces at Duran again as the round ended, but this time, as 
the bell rang, instead of getting a glare in return, Duran turned his gaze to 
the floor as the trudged back to his corner. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds before the end of the seventh, Leonard missed wildly with a right hand, 
leaving himself wide open, and Duran only looked at the opportunity, never 
moving his fists. 
</P>
<P>
The boos began midway through the ninth, a quiet round for both fighters. There 
wasn't a real punch thrown for a minute and a half. 
</P>
<P>
Duran's last chance, Round 12, went by without a challenge from the man once 
known as "Manos de Piedra" (Hands of Stone). Leonard ran and Duran watched, 
despite his pleading cornermen motioning for him to attack. 
</P>
<P>
On the undercard, Olympic champions Ray Mercer and Andrew Maynard plodded to 
uninspired, eight-round decisions. Heavyweight Mercer (210) raised his record 
to 12-0 with a split decision over former cruiserweight champion Ossie Ocasio 
(227), but he looked years away from being ready for Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
Maynard, the light-heavyweight gold medalist in 1988, went to 9-0 with a 
unanimous decision over Mike DeVito. 
</P>
<P>
Heavyweight Tommy Morrison, another projected Tyson opponent, looked more 
promising than Mercer in his six-rounder. The aggressive, left-hooking Morrison 
knocked Canadian journeyman Ken Lakusta down three times and went to 21-0 with 
a decision.

HOLIEWAY SAYS HE GOT BOOSTER FAVORS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FORMER OKLAHOMA QUARTERBACK ALSO TALKS ABOUT GIFTS FROM BARRY 
SWITZER BUT DENIES RECEIVING ANY CASH PAYMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Jamelle Holieway, University of Oklahoma quarterback between 1985 and '88, said 
he received favors from boosters and former Coach Barry Switzer while attending 
the school, but denied published allegations that he had received cash payments 
funneled through a convicted burglar. 
</P>
<P>
Holieway, the 1984 L.A. City player of the year from Wilmington Banning High 
School, said in an interview that he does not know why Otha Armstrong III would 
implicate him and Charles Thompson, another one-time Oklahoma quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, serving time in a state correctional center in Lexington, Okla., was 
quoted in the Dallas Morning News Tuesday as having said he worked as a 
middleman through which an unnamed Oklahoma booster in Tulsa wired cash to 
roommates Holieway and Thompson last season. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong reportedly said he gave the cash to Thompson, a longtime friend, who 
gave a portion to Holieway. Thompson, who pleaded guilty to a charge of 
conspiracy to distribute cocaine, is serving a two-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"(Armstrong is) down there and wants to bring everyone down with him," Holieway 
said. "Everybody who knows Otha knows he is lying. I never received (anything) 
from Otha. 
</P>
<P>
"Otha was always in jail, he was a thief. He used to get out of jail by telling 
on people. He was a snitch." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, 24, formerly played tight end at East Central University in Ada, 
Okla. He attended high school in Lawton, Okla., with Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong was sentenced to five years in prison last month after pleading 
guilty to a charge of stealing 25 championship rings owned by Switzer. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Dallas Morning News, Armstrong said he picked up the last 
money transfer in early 1989, after the Oklahoma football program had been put 
on probation by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
If proven, such an allegation would put Oklahoma in jeopardy of receiving the 
NCAA's "death penalty." However, Armstrong subsequently told the Daily 
Oklahoman that he had not picked up any money for the two players in 1989. Both 
newspapers reported that the NCAA is investigating the matter, but Holieway 
said he had not spoken with NCAA investigators concerning Armstrong's 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Holieway said that he and Thompson knew many boosters in Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
"I had people doing me favors all over, not just in Oklahoma and not just in 
California," Holieway said. "(Some) had nothing to do with the university." 
</P>
<P>
Holieway, who failed to make the Raiders last summer as a wide receiver but 
remains hopeful of starting a professional football career next year, said he 
was able to use gas stations, laundries and restaurants owned by Oklahoma 
boosters without having to pay. 
</P>
<P>
When pressed for details, he said: "If I tell you the specifics, that could put 
the school in (position to receive) the death penalty. I won't do that to 
Oklahoma. I don't want to hurt the guys that are there now and had nothing to 
do with all the stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Holieway, who as a freshman led the Sooners to a national championship 
in 1985, said he is frustrated because he believes he is no longer welcome at 
the university and that he was told to leave the sidelines of Sooner games 
against Texas and Colorado this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Did I bring shame to the university?" he asked. "No. Me, along with everybody 
else, we brought millions of dollars in my four years. So now they treat me 
like I'm a stepchild? I mean I never bad-mouthed the school. I never did 
anything wrong to that school. So why do you want to kick me off (the field)?" 
</P>
<P>
Holieway said that school officials, among them Athletic Director Donnie 
Duncan, did not want him on the sidelines because of his relationship with 
Switzer. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer resigned as Oklahoma's coach last summer in the midst of heavy 
criticism after Thompson's arrest, and a shooting and an alleged rape in a 
Sooner football dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Watson, Oklahoma's assistant athletic director for compliance with National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules, confirmed that school officials asked Holieway 
to leave the sidelines, but said that had nothing to do with Holieway's 
relationship with Switzer. Watson said Holieway was asked to leave because he 
had failed to give advance notice that he wanted to be on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Starting last season, sideline passes had to be approved in advance by Coach 
Gary Gibbs, Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
But even if Holieway had asked for sideline approval, he would have been denied 
a pass because he is working for an agent, Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
Holieway recruits clients for Steve Feldman, a Costa Mesa attorney and sports 
agent who represents some prominent former Oklahoma players. 
</P>
<P>
Holieway said his closeness to Switzer did not look good to some. He said 
Switzer has been unjustly smeared and does not deserve the blame for Oklahoma's 
tarnished image. 
</P>
<P>
Holieway described Switzer as a friend and father-figure, saying the former 
coach bought him drinks at a restaurant and gave him athletic bags and other 
promotional items from sporting goods companies. 
</P>
<P>
"The man was a partier," Holieway said. "He was a single man. We would have 
drinks together. I would see him out at the same restaurant. He would buy me a 
drink . . . he would send a drink over." 
</P>
<P>
Holieway said that Switzer once had told him if he earned his degree, Switzer 
would give him a briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a briefcase made of pigskin that I take to work," Holieway said. "He 
gave it to me." 
</P>
<P>
Under NCAA rules, coaches and boosters are prohibited from giving athletes 
anything of value. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer, in North Hollywood Thursday filming a segment for the television 
serial, "Coach," could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, the assistant athletic director, said he was unaware of Oklahoma 
players receiving favors of any kind from boosters. 
</P>
<P>
"If I would have heard of a restaurant offering our players free meals or a 
cleaning establishment doing their laundry for free, I would go and knock it 
out," he said. "If we knew, we would stop it. We don't need any more surprises. 
I would love to hear some names from Jamelle."

Watson also said he was unaware that Switzer had given Holieway any special 
privileges. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest with you, I never saw any of that," he said. "I never saw Barry 
provide any of that." 
</P>
<P>
Holieway also said that Switzer had been unable to help Thompson, who entered a 
drug-treatment center after testing positive for cocaine last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, we all talked to Charles," Holieway said. "But there was nothing anyone 
could have done. If somebody wants to do something they're going to do it."

Michigan State linebacker Percy Snow earned his second honor of the week 
Thursday night when he was given the Lombardi Award as the nation's top 
collegiate lineman. 
</P>
<P>
Snow, who holds the school record of 164 tackles in a season, on Tuesday won 
the Butkus Award as the nation's top linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Snow, 6-feet-3 and 240 pounds, beat out Colorado linebacker Kanavis McGhee and 
two defensive linemen, USC tackle Tim Ryan and Notre Dame nose guard Chris 
Zorich. Snow and Ryan are seniors, McGhee and Zorich juniors. 
</P>
<P>
The award is a memorial to Vince Lombardi, former coach of the Green Bay 
Packers and Washington Redskins, who died of cancer in 1970. The annual award 
dinner benefits the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
Snow has 464 career tackles, the second Spartan to go over 400. 
</P>
<P>
"I started out playing football just wanting to be successful," Snow said. "I 
saw a light at the end of the tunnel. I recognized that I had some talent and I 
just tried to make the best of it." 
</P>
<P>
Snow has 163 tackles this season, one short of the school record he set last 
year. He also has three interceptions and two blocked field goals. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan plays Hawaii in the Aloha Bowl at Honolulu on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
McGhee teamed with fellow outside linebacker Alfred Williams in leading the 
Buffaloes to an 11-0 record. He has 199 tackles and 10 sacks in his career. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan recorded 19 sacks as USC won the Pacific 10 title. He also had 96 tackles, 
three forced fumbles and one recovered fumble. 
</P>
<P>
Zorich was a key to an Irish defense that allowed 15 points a game en route to 
an 11-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn's Tracy Rocker won the award last year.

MARK DAVIS WILL NOT RETURN TO SAN DIEGO; 
</P>
<P>
PADRES: FINAL SESSION TO KEEP CY YOUNG AWARD WINNER GOES NOWHERE. TEAM SIGNS 
LEFFERTS AS LEFT-HANDED STOPPER.

<P>
There was one last-ditch negotiating session Thursday, but when Jack McKeon 
hung up the telephone in his hotel suite, he said it officially is over. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Davis, the 1989 free-agent Cy Young reliever who saved 44 games, no longer 
is wanted by the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"We're out of the free-agent business," said McKeon, manager and vice president 
of baseball operations for the Padres. "There are no hard feelings. He was 
looking out for his best interest, and I was looking out for mine. We gave him 
every chance in the world, and he didn't take it." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon added: "Our left-handed stopper now is Craig Lefferts." 
</P>
<P>
Lefferts, who had a career-high 20 saves for the San Francisco Giants this 
season, signed a three-year, $5.4-million contract Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He will share the stopper's role with right-hander Greg Harris, who has six 
saves in his career. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and his agents, Alan and Randy Hendricks, Monday night rejected the 
Padres' final offer of four years for $12 million. Davis insisted on a 
five-year contract. Padre owner Joan Kroc insisted on four. 
</P>
<P>
"She's made it clear that it's over," McKeon said, "so we've just got to go 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who has not returned telephone calls for the past two weeks, must decide 
where to take his services. He already has five-year guaranteed contracts 
awaiting him from the Montreal Expos, New York Yankees and Philadelphia 
Phillies. And who knows? The Angels just might be in this hunt. 
</P>
<P>
The termination of Davis' career in San Diego culminates nine months of botched 
negotiations. Davis offered to sign a two-year extension for $2.8 million this 
spring, and sources said he would have signed for as little as $2.4 million. 
But Padre President Dick Freeman refused to budge from his $2.2 million 
counteroffer. 
</P>
<P>
There were no negotiations again until the end of the season. The Padres then 
made four offers: three years for $5 million; three years for $5.4 million; 
three years for $6.9 million, and finally, four years for $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as free-agent starter Mark Langston signed a five-year, $16-million 
contract with the Angels, Davis demanded a five-year contract exceeding 
Langston's. 
</P>
<P>
With negotiations at a stalemate, Kroc put McKeon in charge of all baseball 
operations Sunday. He met for about an hour Monday with the Hendricks brothers, 
and the next time they talked on Thursday, the agents asked McKeon to 
reconsider, to no avail.

PARK SPENDING LAST, POLICE 1ST IN VOTER SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County voters rank police first and open space last when asked which 
of seven public services they would open their pocketbooks for, a new survey 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the answer that a parks agency was looking for. 
</P>
<P>
The survey had been commissioned to determine how to finance open-space 
acquisition, specifically a proposed 42-mile-long linear park stretching along 
the San Dieguito River Valley from Del Mar to near Julian. 
</P>
<P>
The park's joint powers authority is scheduled to review the survey results 
today, perhaps to pull out the few positive facts that surfaced, then turn over 
the task of coming up with a financing method to acquire about 5,400 acres of 
private land for the park. 
</P>
<P>
More than 77% of the voters questioned in the survey responded that they were 
willing to pay more to get more police officers. Only 35.5% would shell out 
more of their money to purchase open space. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of voters surveyed were willing to pay more for more jails 
(63.8%), for new roads and highways (59.7%), for public transit (59.9%), for 
water and sewer improvements (59.7%), for parks (58.1%), but not for open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
The further the survey ventured, the worse the results it elicited for the 
policy-makers attempting to find ways to finance the San Dieguito River 
Regional Open Space Park. Decision Research, the San Diego-based firm that 
conducted the voter poll, put it tactfully: 
</P>
<P>
"Combined with the general lack of enthusiasm for open space and parkland 
acquisition compared to other government services and facilities, we are 
cautious about the prospects for success of open-space acquisition measures." 
</P>
<P>
Decision Research polled 1,600 residents who voted in the 1988 general election 
or who have since registered to vote. The poll was conducted from Oct. 18 
through Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
The results showed that voters, by a two-to-one margin, preferred more smaller 
community parks to fewer large regional parks. Most voters believe that 
developers should pay for both regional and local parks. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what they wanted in a park, the interviewees favored educational 
nature trails, hiking trails, bicycling trails and horse-riding trails in that 
order. Interestingly, those with the lowest incomes ($15,000 or less) were most 
likely to say that horse trails are very important. 
</P>
<P>
Without tipping their hand as to the real purpose of their survey, interviewers 
asked voters to rate potential sites for an open space park. The answers gave 
San Dieguito River Valley Open Space Park advocates one of their few lifts. The 
San Dieguito River Valley, coastal portions and inland portions, ranked above 
the other choices, El Capitan Reservoir, San Luis Rey River, Santa Margarita 
River, Otay River Valley and Tijuana River Valley.

MIGRANTS TO GET AID FROM RED CROSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day after a North County minister criticized the Red Cross for doing too 
little to assist residents of a migrant camp burned out by last week's Black 
Mountain brush fire, the agency offered new assistance and said it is 
re-evaluating its performance during the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Rafael Martinez, executive director of the North County Chaplaincy, 
also learned Thursday that the San Diego Housing Commission has set aside 
$10,000 to help the laborers. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the minister charged that the Red Cross had refused to assist 
hundreds of migrant laborers of the Los Diablos migrant camp, many of whom had 
lost all their possessions in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
A Red Cross spokesman said the group did not offer the workers the customary 
emergency services because there was no way to verify if the laborers indeed 
lived in the canyons blackened by the fire. On Thursday, the nonprofit agency 
changed its mind about helping the laborers. 
</P>
<P>
"We called Rev. Martinez this morning to find out exactly what his needs are 
and how they fall under the services we provide," said Tom Custer, a Red Cross 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been criticized for our role in assisting the migrant workers during the 
recent blaze. After every disaster, we review our performance to see how we can 
improve. And that will happen again after this fire." 
</P>
<P>
The blaze burned 4,500 acres in the Black Mountain area near North City West. 
Officials have estimated that, before the fire, 400 to 600 people lived in the 
sprawling camp in makeshift hooches of wood and cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
However, Joann Johnson, chief administrative aide for Deputy Mayor Abbe 
Wolfsheimer, said her office had requested emergency funds from the housing 
commission immediately after learning of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked for the money because we saw that there were 500 to 600 people 
standing on a hillside who didn't have anything left," she said. "So we went 
looking for emergency funds for blankets and food, things like that." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Jo Riley, a spokeswoman for the city's housing commission, said a check 
for $10,000 was sent Wednesday to Catholic Charities, which will disburse the 
funds to several groups -- including the North County Chaplaincy -- that are 
trying to help the migrant workers. Catholic Charities also will be responsible 
for accounting for the money.

VISTA TO TRY TO SELL SCHOOL BOND ISSUE AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: VOTERS HAVE GIVEN MAJORITY APPROVAL BUT DENIED PREVIOUS MEASURES THE 
NECESSARY TWO-THIRDS. SCHOOL LEADERS CALL THEIR SITUATION DESPERATE. 
</P>

<P>
The Vista Unified School District, where crowding is so bad that students 
regularly have to stand in long lines to use the lavatories, will try for the 
third time to convince the community of its plight. 
</P>
<P>
Twice now, voters have rejected the plea of the state's second-fastest-growing 
district to approve bonds for building new schools and repairing old facilities 
to handle nearly 1,850 new students a year. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, just one month since the latest defeat at the polls, somber district 
trustees have declared their intent to try a third time by asking voters in the 
June 5, 1990 election to approve a $63-million bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
School supporters say schools soon will launch year-round classes to 
temporarily ease the crowding and will eventually have unwanted double 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
There remains some disagreement among the trustees over how to sway voters who 
dumped a $63-million bond measure in November, 1988, and a $38.8-million issue 
last month. In both cases, the measures won solid majorities but didn't reach 
the two-thirds required under Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is, we can't play cat-and-mouse games, we have to let the people 
know how desperate the situation is," Trustee Marcia Viger said Thursday, 
acknowledging that the district made mistakes in its ill-fated November bond 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
For the November effort, the district hired a political consultant who 
orchestrated a campaign that still failed, despite no organized opposition. The 
vote was 62% for the bonds and 38% against, but the district had the small 
satisfaction of gaining 3 percentage points over the November, 1988, loss. 
</P>
<P>
"People in Vista, for the most part, still have the feeling this is a sleepy 
little farm town, but things have changed drastically and they haven't figured 
it out," Viger said. "People here don't want to be sent (campaign) mail, they 
don't want a slick campaign, they want a down-home atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
That means next time, bond proponents must win the hearts and minds by making 
personal door-to-door contact with voters and assure -- unlike last time -- 
that huge volumes of parents visit the polls, said Viger, a three-term trustee 
and mother of six Vista pupils. 
</P>
<P>
But there also is sentiment, born of harsh disappointment, to take more drastic 
steps to grip the voters' attention in the 18-school, 17,000-student district 
that serves Vista, parts of Carlsbad, Oceanside, San Marcos and unincorporated 
county area. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Koch, who in frustration resigned his chairmanship of the district's 
citizen budget advisory committee, believes the district must dramatize its 
plight by cutting school bus transportation, reducing programs that don't pay 
their own way, and enacting a hiring freeze. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to have to take a high-profile, hard-nosed approach," said Koch, 
who has two children in Vista schools and is director of a supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
Koch faults trustees for not having mobilized parents before, saying "parents 
didn't go out to vote, and they (trustees) didn't convince them it's a critical 
problem. People don't vote for a tax increase unless it's an emergency." 
</P>
<P>
According to district officials, it's an emergency. A new report by Supt. Rene 
Townsend said "we are avoiding double sessions by the initiation of year-round 
education." But year-round class will only buy time. And Townsend said that, 
unless a school funding source is found soon, double sessions are coming in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
Although a $63-million bond issue would hasten initial construction and make 
the district eligible for matching state funds, her report noted the district 
will need more than $200 million for new facilities over the next 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Today, said Viger, elementary students "must wait in line to go to the 
bathroom. I mean we have to schedule bathroom, and one or two classrooms have 
to line up." More importantly, kids are cramped in classrooms and school yards, 
and, Viger said "a lot of the privations are intangible. We know it's not good 
to cram kids in small spaces." 
</P>
<P>
Vista's elementary through high schools were built for 12,000 students and now 
house 18,000. Enrollment is rising about 1,850 students a year and is projected 
to reach 2,000 more annually over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
For the 1988 bond election, school officials had asked voters to approve $63 
million, and, when that failed, trustees decided it might at least appear more 
prudent -- if not salable -- to trim the amount to $38.8 million next time. 
</P>
<P>
With the lower sum on the ballot, "they thought it would be slam-dunk" for 
approval, said Manuel Robles, the district's communications director. "It was a 
bad decision to drop that amount" from the original $63 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, trustees voted 5 to 0 to put a $63-million question on the June 
ballot, believing that will allow more time to muster voter support and save 
election costs by putting the bond measure on a consolidated ballot. 
</P>
<P>
They also demonstrated that double sessions are clearly possible by naming a 
special committee to begin planning double sessions, which typically teach 
students in two shifts -- 7 a.m. to 1 p.m., and 1 to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will "start up the first of the year to see how soon they can 
bring double sessions on line," Robles said.

and forced the evacuation of the Acapulco Hotel. The fire was started by 
construction workers digging in the area and was allowed to burn until 
SDG&amp;E workers could clamp a nearby supply line, a Fire Department official 
said. Power to some SDG&amp;E customers was disrupted for two hours. No

JUDGES MAY ORDER COUNTY TO PROVIDE MORE COURT SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Superior Court judges, pressing for new courtrooms in downtown San Diego, may 
be forced to order county supervisors to provide them with more space, 
Presiding Judge Michael I. Greer said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the court's 12-member executive committee will meet to take up 
Greer's recommendation that the court proceed under a little-known state law 
allowing judges to order a county board to provide "suitable rooms" and court 
equipment, Greer said. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of providing those facilities must be borne by the county general 
fund, the law says. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing's never been dealt with before," Greer said. "We may unfortunately 
be out in front in San Diego County." 
</P>
<P>
If the committee approves the idea, it would then be put to the entire 
69-member Superior Court bench for a vote, likely within a week, Greer said. If 
a majority of the full court also approves, the judges would form an advisory 
committee and hire a lawyer to more fully research the state law giving them 
the authority to order court facilities. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego judges have known about the law for some time, but Monday's meeting 
will mark the first time the court has formally considered invoking it, Greer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had the trump card for a long time," Greer said. "We've never, ever 
played that trump card, and I hope we don't have to play it now. But we're in a 
crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Greer's concern centers on nine new courtrooms planned for downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The county staff has recommended that the nine be placed at the former El 
Cortez Hotel Convention Center, at Beech Street and 8th Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The city of San Diego has agreed to put up $3 million in redevelopment funds 
for courtroom construction, and earlier this week the City Council voted to 
recommend that the courtrooms be placed in the former Walker-Scott department 
store at 5th Avenue and Broadway. Rehabilitation of that site would do more to 
further overall downtown revitalization, the staff of the Centre City 
Development Corp. contends. 
</P>
<P>
The city declined to release the $3 million to the county, pending next 
Tuesday's county supervisors' meeting, at which the board may discuss the two 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
The failure to release the money turned courtroom planning into an "emergency 
situation," prompting consideration of the state law, Greer said.

MEMORIAL SERVICE PLANNED FOR SCHOOLS PIONEER HOWARD WOOD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Memorial services will be held Saturday for Dr. Howard Asa Wood, the first 
president of the Torrance Unified School District Board of Education and one of 
the district's founders. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, who also was a founder and former chief of staff at Torrance Memorial 
Medical Center, died Nov. 22 at the medical center. He was 95 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very outgoing person, very generous," said Albert Posner, a retired 
assistant superintendent of the Torrance school district, who was one of the 
first principals hired by the fledgling school board in 1947. "He was wonderful 
with children and a fine medical doctor," Posner said. 
</P>
<P>
Born to farmer parents on the South Dakota prairie Jan. 12, 1894, Wood began 
his formal education in a one-room schoolhouse before moving on to 
undergraduate studies at Yale University and Linfield College in Oregon. He 
graduated from Yale University's medical school in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
Wood set up a medical practice in Long Beach, then moved to Beaumont, Calif., 
in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
He came to Torrance in 1942 and quickly became one of several community 
activists pushing for an independent Torrance school system, which at the time 
was part of the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
In 1947, voters approved the new district, and Wood was selected as its first 
president. 
</P>
<P>

BURBANK HOSPITAL REJECTS MERGER WITH ST. JOSEPH'S OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Burbank Community Hospital has decided not to pursue a proposal to merge with 
the hospital chain that owns St. Joseph Medical Center because such a merger 
would probably result in the 103-bed facility being converted into a nursing 
home, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank Community Hospital's foundation, composed of 48 doctors and 10 
administrators, voted secretly during a closed meeting Wednesday night not to 
pursue the merger, said William Daniel, hospital director. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, Daniel said, was because the Sisters of Providence, a nonprofit 
foundation that owns the 450-bed St. Joseph Medical Center, would not guarantee 
that Burbank Community would continue to operate as a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"They basically said there was not a need for two general service hospitals in 
the area," Daniel said. "They wanted to use the hospital for alternate 
health-care purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bettina Kurowski, associate administrator for planning at St. Joseph, said 
that had a merger occurred, the Sisters of Providence would probably have 
turned Burbank Community into a nursing home or hospice. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make sense to run another hospital," Kurowski said. "All you have 
to do is look around the Valley to see that there are far more hospital beds 
than we need." 
</P>
<P>
Both hospitals have experienced a significant drop in patients over the last 
few years, due in part to an increase in outpatient services, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank Community lost more than $1.3 million last year and is expected to lose 
$1 million this year, posing a serious threat to the hospital's future, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel said Burbank Community's foundation will explore other alternatives to 
keep the hospital going, including seeking another partner. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of other hospital chains around," Daniel said. "Right now, 
we're trying to determine the best course to take. . . . I'm convinced that 
we've got a place here in Burbank."

N. HOLLYWOOD PEDESTRIAN TUNNEL CLOSED; 
</P>
<P>
VANDALISM: LOS ANGELES CITY OFFICIALS SAY BECK AVENUE WALKWAY WAS A HAVEN FOR 
GANGS, GRAFFITI ARTISTS AND VANDALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles city officials Thursday closed another pedestrian tunnel in North 
Hollywood that residents said had long been a haven for gangs, graffiti artists 
and vandals. 
</P>
<P>
The closure of the tunnel under the Ventura Freeway at Beck Avenue marks the 
third time in 18 months that the city has boarded up a pedestrian tunnel in 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Two tunnels under the Hollywood Freeway at North Hollywood Park were closed in 
June, 1988, because police said they had become hide-outs for drug dealers and 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, city officials in recent years have closed more than 30 of Los 
Angeles' 221 pedestrian tunnels, which were built as a way to cross busy 
streets and freeways. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a shame, but the tunnels are just being used for the wrong 
purposes," said Mary Presby, a field deputy for Councilman John Ferraro, who 
backed the closure of the Beck Avenue tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
Seven tunnels remain open in North Hollywood, said Sam Matsumura, an engineer 
in the city's Bureau of Engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Workers early Thursday nailed plywood across the two entrances to the Beck 
Avenue tunnel, which was dark, smelly and covered with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Presby said Ferraro will ask the City Council to approve spending about $53,000 
to close the tunnel permanently by filling it with sand and concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this fall, about 120 residents of the single-family neighborhood north 
of the Beck Avenue tunnel submitted a petition asking Ferraro to have the 
tunnel boarded up because of vandalism, which they attributed to students from 
nearby Walter Reed Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to painting graffiti on the tunnel's walls, residents said, vandals 
had dumped trash cans, broken off car antennas and set brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when I went to school at Reed more than 20 years ago, the tunnel had a 
reputation as a tough place," said Larry LaFace, 40, the resident who collected 
the petition's signatures. "Everybody is elated that it's closed." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Rick Dinse of the Los Angeles Police Department's North Hollywood 
Division said authorities considered the tunnel a haven for student 
troublemakers and gang members. 
</P>
<P>
He said he supports its closure because he could not devote the manpower 
necessary to adequately patrol it. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Selsor, Reed assistant principal, said school officials back the closure 
because "whenever we'd have fights, that's where they'd frequently occur."

FORMER DEPUTY IS SENTENCED IN BEATING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A former sheriff's deputy in Georgia was sentenced to a year of probation and 
fined $800 after pleading guilty to misdemeanor charges in the beating of a 
trucker after a 50-mile chase last spring. 
</P>
<P>
The driver's hitchhiking passenger, Mark Charles Nanz, 29, of San Diego, was 
killed by bullets fired during the April 26 chase. 
</P>
<P>
Former Deputy David N. Ryals, 23, pleaded guilty to simple battery in Bryan 
County Superior Court in Pembroke, Ga., last week. 
</P>
<P>
The chase started on Interstate 95 in Glynn County, Ga., after the trucker 
refused to stop for police, and ended in Bryan County when officers fired more 
than 30 rounds into the cab. Both the driver, Klaus Kirk, 37, of Denver, and 
Nanz were struck by bullets, but Kirk survived.

HOW DRY IS IT? STICK AROUND, IT MAY SOON BREAK THE RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas -- in a desert. 
</P>
<P>
If the lip-chapping, cuticle-cracking weather holds three more weeks, San Diego 
will experience the driest year since meteorologists started keeping track in 
1850, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
Back-to-back Santa Anas in the last few weeks and a meager 2.82 inches of rain 
since Jan. 1 have 1989 rivaling 1863 for the driest year on record, said 
forecaster Wilbur Shigehara. The usual annual rainfall for San Diego is about 9 
inches, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always had more than 3 inches of rain," Shigehara said. "There was one 
year, 1863, when we only got 3.02 inches, but I think this year will go into 
the books." 
</P>
<P>
Normally the fourth wettest month of the year, December so far has had no rain, 
and the 30-day extended forecast shows none in sight, Shigehara said. Another 
Santa Ana is expected late Sunday and could clinch the matter. 
</P>
<P>
At Lindbergh Field on Thursday, the high was 80 degrees with a humidity level 
of 14%, Shigehara said. The normal high for this time of year is 67 degrees 
with a humidity reading of 61%. 
</P>
<P>
Shigehara says that, although weather history doesn't always repeat itself, 
there have been many ultra-dry autumns that have segued into wet and wild 
winters. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not giving up hope yet," Shigehara said. "We have a 50-50 chance of normal 
rain returning in January; it doesn't take long for the rain to bounce back." 
</P>
<P>
Highs at the beaches today will range from 68 to 72 and 64 to 68 on the 
weekend. Water temperature is 59 degrees and the surf is 3 to 4 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The high tides will begin to climb this weekend, starting today with 6.1 feet 
at 5:17 a.m., Shigehara said. The high tide Saturday will be 6.7 feet, and 7.2 
feet on Sunday at 6:43 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal highs today will be 72 to 77, and 68 to 74 Saturday and Sunday, 
Shigehara said. Overnight lows will range from 45 to 52. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny days untouched by fog and clouds are forecast for the inland areas. Highs 
today will range from 75 to 83, and from 73 to 78 on the weekend. Overnight 
lows will be 34 to 44 tonight and 36 to 46 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Daytime temperatures in the mountains will be a nippy 48 to 58 degrees this 
weekend, with downright cold overnight lows in the upper 20s, Shigehara said.

PANEL AMENDS, OKS 1-YEAR BAN ON SOME SAN PEDRO PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An ordinance that would curb construction of apartments and condominiums in San 
Pedro for one year is now on its way to the City Council for passage, having 
been approved -- with two significant changes -- this week by a council 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
The San Pedro interim control ordinance is intended to prevent the razing of 
single-family homes, while a citizens advisory committee drafts permanent 
zoning changes. Residents of this harbor town have been complaining for months 
that such "tear downs" are destroying the single-family character of their 
community. 
</P>
<P>
In its 2-0 vote, the Los Angeles council's Planning and Land Use Management 
Committee retained the majority of the ordinance -- which had been approved by 
the city Planning Commission in August. Among the requirements, the temporary 
law includes a ban on new apartment construction on blocks that are zoned for 
apartments but where more than 50% of the homes are either single-family or 
duplexes. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also moved to increase the number of parking spaces at new 
apartment developments and deleted a requirement that builders, who want to 
maintain the right to build under current zoning, must obtain foundation 
permits from the city by Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the committee corrected an oversight in the ordinance by formally 
giving the City Council final authority over appeals. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary ordinance is aimed at developers who string together lots to 
build big apartment complexes, and the tearing down of houses for apartment 
construction in the RD1.5 zone, where one apartment may be built for every 
1,500 square feet of lot space. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called 50/50 ban on new apartments in predominantly single-family 
neighborhoods applies to lots smaller than 6,000 square feet in the RD1.5 zone. 
On lots 6,000 square feet or larger, apartment developers may build only one 
unit for every 2,000 square feet under the new ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ordinance requires that no single apartment building contain 
more than four units, although more than one building may be permitted on a 
lot, if the lot is large enough. 
</P>
<P>
The removal of the Jan. 1 deadline was suggested by Councilwoman Joan Milke 
Flores' staff. Before the proposed ordinance was changed by the committee, 
builders who had filed plans by Aug. 31 and who had obtained a permit to 
construct a foundation permit by Jan. 1 would not fall under the more 
restrictive rules of the new law. 
</P>
<P>
But Mario Juravich, an aide to the councilwoman, said the city's Building and 
Safety Department is so backlogged with applications that it cannot process all 
foundation permit requests by Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The removal of the deadline will allow developers who met the Aug. 31 cutoff to 
build under the old rules for up to 18 months from the filing date of their 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, it will also have the positive effect of staggering development 
in the community. 
</P>
<P>
The new parking provision, meanwhile, means developers must provide as much 
parking for apartment complexes as condominiums -- a requirement that Juravich 
said will benefit San Pedro by promoting the building of owner-occupied 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
In its initial form, the ordinance called for apartment developers to provide 
one guest parking space for every four apartment units, and for condominium 
developers to provide an additional parking space for every two units. The 
condominium requirement is now the standard. 
</P>
<P>
Members of a citizens advisory committee that helped draft the ordinance said 
they were generally pleased with the Planning and Land Use Management 
Committee's changes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think those are fine," said Noah Modisett, who chairs the citizens 
committee. "I particularly think that the parking change was a sound one to 
make."

PICUS WANTS HOUSES, NOT HIGH-RISES, IN WARNER RIDGE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joy Picus said Thursday she will seek to stop a 
controversial office project in Warner Ridge by recommending that the city 
change the zoning of the property from commercial to residential. 
</P>
<P>
Picus said she will make the recommendation Tuesday to the council's Planning 
and Land Use Management Committee, arguing that single-family houses are more 
compatible with the surrounding Warner Ridge community than the planned 
$150-million high-rise office project. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the absolute right thing to do, and I'm going to push it very hard," 
Picus told a luncheon group of Times editors and reporters. "This project has 
never been right for the area, and I'm going to fight it." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Planning Commission in May approved development of the 
nine-building office complex at the northeast corner of De Soto Avenue and 
Oxnard Street despite pleas by Picus and homeowner groups that single-family 
houses be built on the ridge instead. 
</P>
<P>
Picus said she had already had discussions about the project with Councilman 
Hal Bernson, chairman of the Planning and Land Use Management Committee, but 
said she did not know how the committee will vote. She added that she did not 
know if the City Council, which has the final say, would vote against the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Spound, developer of the project, said he was not surprised by Picus' 
announcement. "It's what I expected," he said. He said he had the support of 
the surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
However, Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization Vice President Bob Gross said 
residents wanted the property rezoned residential. "There's no way we want the 
office project, and Joy Picus is doing the right thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Planners had previously praised the 22 1/2-acre proposal as a "quality 
development" with built-in safeguards to keep it from causing traffic jams in 
the adjoining Warner Center area of the west San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents who have spent almost three years fighting the development said 
the project would bring gridlock to nearby streets and the neighboring 
residential community. They complained that high-rises would turn Warner Ridge 
into a crowded urban area that would disrupt the residential atmosphere.

<P>
A 19-year-old man who was living in Balboa Park's canyons was found guilty 
Thursday of the first-degree murder and robbery of a man in the park July 5. 
</P>
<P>
After discussing the case 2 1/2 hours, the San Diego Superior Court jury 
convicted Javier Garcia Gutierrez of killing Franklin Black, 34, who was 
apparently jogging in Balboa Park at the time of the 4 a.m. attack. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing was set for Jan. 4, and Gutierrez faces a maximum sentence of 25 
years to life in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was stabbed in the arm, but the wound hit a critical artery that

FIRE ENGULFS 2 BUILDINGS AT NORTHRIDGE LUMBERYARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A greater-alarm fire raged through a Northridge lumberyard Thursday night in an 
area where an arsonist had set more than 25 small fires since Sunday, the Los 
Angeles City Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Two buildings at the Terry Lumber Co. complex at 18300 Parthenia Street were 
engulfed by flames, said Greg Acevedo, Fire Department spokesman. Thirteen 
engine companies and a Fire Department helicopter were battling the $1-million 
blaze which started about 9:15 p.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries had been reported, and no neighboring structures or houses were 
reported threatened, Acevedo said. A smaller fire was reported at the lumber 
company Tuesday night, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night's fire started about an hour after two burning trees were 
reported only a few blocks from the lumberyard. 
</P>
<P>
Those fires were similar to a string of about 25 fires in trees and rubbish 
piles that were believed to have been set by one or more arsonists Sunday and 
Monday nights in the same area. One of the fires damaged the roof of an 
apartment complex on Napa Street. 
</P>
<P>
A car parked under a burning palm tree also was damaged, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
About 13 of the smaller fires were set Sunday, and at least 12 were reported 
Monday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department arson investigators and four engine companies were patrolling 
the area for possible arsonists when the lumberyard fire broke out. Acevedo 
said the cause of the fire was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was contained about 10 p.m., but it was not expected to be fully 
extinguished until later Thursday night, authorities said.

FORMER OFFICER GETS FINE FOR FAKE REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Torrance police officer was fined $2,250 Thursday in Los Angeles 
Municipal Court and placed on probation for one year, six weeks after he 
pleaded no contest to charges that he filed a false police report and 
obstructed an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Pappas, 27, was fired from the Torrance Police Department after he shot 
an unarmed construction worker, Patrick J. Coyle, and then gave false reports 
about the incident to superiors. 
</P>
<P>
Pappas said at the time of the shooting in May, 1988, that he fired his gun 
when Coyle moved suddenly as if to reach for a weapon, police reports say. Two 
backup officers supported that account for a time but one, Officer Timothy 
Thornton, eventually told superiors the story was a lie and that Pappas fired 
the gun accidentally, the reports say. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton was given immunity from prosecution in exchange for providing 
information about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The third officer at the scene, Mark Holden, is fighting allegations he 
conspired to obstruct justice and to falsely charge another with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
Holden's preliminary hearing began Thursday in Los Angeles Municipal Court and 
is scheduled to continue Dec. 19.

ANTELOPE VALLEY DISTRICT TO RECONSIDER DRESS CODE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: TRUSTEES BACK OFF ON A BAN OF GANG-RELATED ATTIRE AFTER BEING WARNED 
THAT IT WOULD BE VULNERABLE TO LEGAL CHALLENGES. 
</P>

<P>
In a move that dismayed teachers but pleased some students, the board of the 
Antelope Valley Union High School District has balked at adopting a tough new 
student dress code that would ban gang-related attire. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the district's board of trustees came after its attorney warned 
that the draft policy is vulnerable to constitutional challenges. The attorney 
also urged the district to better document its gang problems before passing a 
revised version. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can have some type of dress code. But we can't have people making 
up what is gang attire as we go along," said board President Larry Rucker, one 
of those voicing caution. He said the policy will be considered again at the 
board's next meeting, Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed policy had angered some students in the six-campus district, 
mainly because one of its provisions would prohibit all hats, except those 
related to students' schools. Several told the board that they simply like 
wearing sports-oriented baseball caps or other headgear. 
</P>
<P>
"It discriminates against those of us who have nothing to do with gangs. It 
lets the minority dictate what the majority wears," complained Loren Long, a 
17-year-old senior at Quartz Hill High School who said he often wears a crimson 
University of Oklahoma cap. 
</P>
<P>
However, Beverley Louw, a school principal who led the faculty and parent 
committee that drafted the dress code, said students in the district have been 
attacked on campus just because of wearing hats. And Louw said members of her 
group are upset about the board's delay. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a cry from the community we need to take stands on things, and here we 
are standing on the fence," said Louw, principal of Desert Winds High School, 
the district's continuation school. Her campus on its own last spring 
instituted a strict ban on gang attire. 
</P>
<P>
The policy at Desert Winds came after several gang incidents there, including 
one case in which youths with high-power rifles were spotted near the campus, 
Louw said. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, district teachers began demanding a districtwide ban on gang attire. 
</P>
<P>
At Desert Winds, Louw said the student dress policy outlaws all types of hats, 
solid blue or red clothing because of the association of those colors with 
gangs, bandannas and even British Knight tennis shoes, which are worn by gang 
members who say the BK logo stands for "Blood Killers." 
</P>
<P>
School districts in Southern California have increasingly turned to anti-gang 
dress codes in recent years in attempts to combat their growing gang problems. 
The idea has been under consideration in the Antelope Valley, which also has 
experienced worsening gang violence, for many months. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to hats, the district's proposed policy would outlaw clothing and 
other items, including gloves, bandannas, shoestrings, wristbands and jewelry 
"related to a group or gang, which may provoke others to acts of violence or to 
be intimidated by fear of violence." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also would ban clothing or jewelry "which depicts or suggests 
sexually related or obscene gestures, pictures or wording, or which promotes 
violence, the use/abuse of drugs, tobacco or alcohol." Students violating the 
policy after a first warning could be suspended or expelled. 
</P>
<P>
In a nine-page memo delivered just before Wednesday night's board meeting, 
district counsel Urrea Jones Jr. said he believes that the district may 
lawfully regulate the dress of its nearly 10,000 students. He also submitted a 
revised policy draft that he said cured his legal concerns. 
</P>
<P>
But before taking action, Jones said, the district first needs to demonstrate 
that gang-type attire creates "a clear and present danger" of violence or 
disruption. He urged the board to publicly detail the extent of its campus gang 
problems and allow him to review them. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles school district has no broad anti-gang dress code, although 
many individual schools have imposed restrictions, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A student who sued over one school's policy last year left school and dropped 
his case, leaving the legal issues unresolved by the courts.

LOYOLA WINS, BUT FALLS 48 POINTS SHORT OF 200

<P>
U.S. International University, college basketball's favorite punching bag, 
decided to fight back Thursday night, hanging even with Loyola Marymount for 30 
minutes before falling, 152-137, in front of 1,264 in Golden Hall. 
</P>
<P>
USIU, playing some of the heavy hitters of the NCAA this month -- the Gulls 
fell to Oklahoma, 173-101, last week and play at Arkansas next -- fell to 2-5. 
But they had a 94-92 lead midway through the second half before Loyola turned 
it up a notch. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions (4-1) eventually pulled away with a 58-43 burst in the final 12:35, 
withstanding a school-record, 54-point barrage by USIU guard Kevin Bradshaw. 
</P>
<P>
This game had been billed as Loyola's shot at college's first 200-point game. 
The marquee here even predicted: "History in the Making." But USIU was the team 
that looked hungry when the game began. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions needed 37 points and 27 rebounds from Hank Gathers and five other 
players in double figures to win their fourth in a row. Bradshaw, who hit 20 of 
37 shots, was supported by Demetrius Laffitte with 25 points and Steve Smith 
with 23. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (a record) was on our mind, but my guys didn't really have that 200 
look on their faces," Gathers said. "USIU did a good job of smacking us and 
making us wake up." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions led by as many as 10 points early, but USIU, thanks to second efforts 
and numerous Loyola turnovers, went on a 31-19 run to take a 55-53 lead with 
4:47 left in the half. The Gulls forced 14 Loyola turnovers in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola, with Gathers controlling the boards, forged an 11-3 run to build a 
64-58 lead, but couldn't put the Gulls away in the half. USIU pulled to within 
one point twice in the closing seconds and trailed by only 75-72 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's slim lead was due mostly to the work of Gathers, who had 23 points and 
11 rebounds, and Per Stumer with 14 points. Bradshaw had 20 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The pattern continued into the second half, with USIU starting fast and taking 
leads of five points behind Bradshaw's three-point shooting. Loyola finally 
caught up at 90-90 with 14:05 left but didn't take the lead for good until the 
10-minute mark. The fast break suddenly kicked in and the Lions ran off a 24-4 
surge and built a double-figure lead. This time, USIU didn't have an answer. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Kimble added 27 for the Lions, and guard Terrell Lowery had a career-high 
24. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola and USIU played the highest-scoring game in college history in January, 
181-150. Thursday night's 152-137 was the fourth-highest combined total in NCAA 
history, but Loyola Coach Paul Westhead said he wasn't shooting for records 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year it was midseason," Westhead said. "We're still trying to find our 
team. It's too early to worry about records. I want to accumulate some wins."

Does this sound like a coach's dream? 
</P>
<P>
Dean Smith: "It's a big joke . . . our schedule already was too tough." 
</P>
<P>
John Thompson: "I'm not for it and I've said it all along." 
</P>
<P>
What North Carolina Coach Smith and Georgetown Coach Thompson were talking 
about was their matchup Thursday night in the inaugural ACC-Big East Challenge, 
an eight-game matchup of two of the toughest conferences in the country, which 
wound up at four victories apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Tillmon scored 27 points to lead the No. 3 to victory over the No. 17 Tar 
Heels, 93-81, in the final game of the tournament at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first meeting between the team's since the Tar Heels beat 
Georgetown, 63-62, on Michael Jordan's jumper in the 1982 NCAA championship 
game at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown (4-0) held a comfortable lead throughout the second half, and North 
Carolina (4-3) never got closer than five points in the final five minutes. 
Alonzo Mourning scored 18 points for Georgetown. Scott Williams had 19 for 
North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia 73, Villanova 65 -- John Crotty scored 25 points and Virginia (5-1) 
beat Villanova at East Rutherford. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia grabbed the lead for good at 62-60 with 5:45 to play on a three-point 
shot by Crotty. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia's last field goal, a rebound follow by Bryant Stith, gave the 
Cavaliers a 64-60 lead with 4:34 left. Greg Woodard hit a long jump shot for 
Villanova (4-3) 22 seconds later, but Cavaliers made nine of 12 free throws to 
preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
No. 19 North Carolina St. 126, Duquesne 77 -- Chris Corchiani and Brian Howard 
scored six points each in a 22-0 first-half run that powered North Carolina 
State to victory at Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Monroe scored 22 points as North Carolina State placed six players in 
double figures. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa 89, Iowa State 87 -- Ray Thompson, who lost his starting job after being 
arrested last week, scored 20 of his 32 points in the second half to rally 
unbeaten Iowa at Ames. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, arrested last Friday for public intoxication and two other charges, 
was suspended for one game and has been been a reserve since. He played 29 
minutes against Iowa State and hit 14 of 21 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa, which trailed by 17 points early in the second half, withstood a 36-point 
effort by Iowa State's Terry Woods. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State 70, USF 67 Matt Anderson's fast-break layup with six seconds left 
in the second overtime lifted the Sun Devils (1-3) to victory at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's layup followed a steal by Emilio Kovacic, a Yugoslav newcomer who 
had shot an air ball on a free throw attempt with 32 seconds left.

DURAN SAYS HE THINKS HE WON; 
</P>
<P>
FIGHT: HIS EXCUSE THIS TIME IS THAT REFEREE REFUSED TO LET HIM GET IN CLOSE AND 
THAT 'EVERYBODY' WAS AGAINST HIM.

<P>
It was nine years between humiliating defeats to Sugar Ray Leonard for Roberto 
Duran, nine years between excuses. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Roberto claimed stomach cramps made him say "No Mas'' in the eighth 
round. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, he said he lost a 12-round decision because a country and a 
referee conspired against him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fighting against the United States, the referee, everybody," Duran said 
through an interperter in the press room at the Mirage hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"Leonard came here to clown around. He didn't beat me. But the referee (Richard 
Steele) didn't let me fight. He pulled me away from Leonard every time we got 
in close. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, I was able to hit Leonard as the rounds went on. Yes, I think I won the 
fight." 
</P>
<P>
Among those disagreeing with the erstwhile Hands of Stone were the three judges 
who awarded the quicker, smarter and seemingly even hungrier Leonard the 
decision by margins of 10, 10 and five points. 
</P>
<P>
The winner found no fault with that math. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased with my performance," Leonard said. "My legs are still good. 
They saved me. They got me in and out. Speed was the key." 
</P>
<P>
That old-time speed that had deserted him his last fight in the desert against 
Thomas Hearns couldn't keep him away from one damaging punch in the 11th round, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
Sugar Ray wore dark glasses at the news conference to cover the cut over a left 
eye that once was operated on for a detached retina. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to accommodate the public in the 11th round," he said. "They wanted to 
see a brawl. I was cut by a right hand." 
</P>
<P>
And that was one of Duran's few acts of aggression nine years after the 
embarrassment that was New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," said television commentator Gil Clancy. "I've never 
seen a guy who looked less motivated than Duran tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Promoter Bob Arum, who analyzed the fight a lot better after it than before it, 
thought this was simply a matter of styles. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys have the personalities to mesh, but not the styles," Arum said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been all Leonard since the 13th round of the first fight. We shouldn't 
have expected anything different this time. Leonard is just too quick for 
Duran." 
</P>
<P>
Among those listening to the promoter was Wilfred Benitez, a former champion. 
</P>
<P>
"Use me," Benitez pleaded. "I'm only 31."

SPIRITED MASTER'S ROLLS OVER WHITTIER, 98-71

<P>
Strands of twinkling lights bedeck the trees that surround Bross Gymnasium, 
evoking a pristine holiday spirit on The Master's College campus. 
</P>
<P>
But as the Whittier College men's basketball team discovered Thursday night, 
Master's is wont to be anything but charitable once the Mustangs are within the 
cozy and noisy confines of their home facility. 
</P>
<P>
Master's routed the Poets, 98-71, for a non-district victory that improved the 
Mustangs' record to 6-3, 4-1 at home. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier dropped to 1-6. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we were bigger than them so we just wanted to take it at 'em," said 
Master's forward Tom Bruner, who had a game-high 16 points and nine rebounds. 
"When we come in here, it's just like, 'Bring it on.' We can take on anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Bruner and the Mustangs will get a more challenging opportunity to prove 
themselves Saturday when Master's plays host to Westmont (5-1) in a key 
National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics District 3 game. 
</P>
<P>
Master's shot 61% from the field against Whittier to earn its fourth victory in 
its past five games. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Epperson scored 13 points and grabbed a game-high 10 rebounds for the 
Master's. Jeff Newton also scored 13 points while Ted Hahs and David Moore each 
scored 10 points for the Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite committing six turnovers in the first three minutes, the Mustangs were 
ahead from the outset and enjoyed a comfortable 51-32 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Webster and Bruner each had two baskets as Master's bolted to a 10-1 lead 
before Whittier called a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
It took the Poets, who shot just 32%, more than 4 1/2 minutes to make their 
first field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Master's, meanwhile, shot 63% in the first half and led by as many as 21 
points. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs led, 22-16, with 13 minutes left in the half when Moore came off 
the bench and ignited a Master's scoring run that helped the Mustangs to take 
an insurmountable lead. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, a 6-foot-6, 215-pound junior forward, scored eight points and grabbed 
five rebounds during the 12-2 run that put Master's in front, 34-18.

CITY FOOTBALL PLAYOFF FORMAT MIGHT CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hal Harkness, commissioner of the City Section, said that he will recommend a 
change in the format of the 4-A Division football playoffs next year whereby 
teams will be seeded by strength regardless of league standings. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal must be approved by the Interscholastic Athletics Committee, but 
Harkness is confident that it will pass when he presents it sometime next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two seasons, the top three teams in four 4-A Division leagues 
qualified for the playoffs, and the league champions were granted first-round 
byes. That format doesn't necessarily reward the division's top teams, 
according to Harkness, who pointed to this year's first-round match-up between 
San Fernando and Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
Neither team won a league title but would have been seeded among the top five 
under the new plan, according to Harkness. Carson, Granada Hills and Dorsey 
would have been the top three seeded teams, followed by San Fernando and 
Crenshaw, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Stallworth, a senior wide receiver from Washington State, has been selected 
to play for the West squad in the 65th East-West Shrine Game on Jan. 21 at 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Stallworth, a former Montclair Prep standout, was a second-team selection to 
the All-Pacific Conference 10 team despite missing three games and parts of two 
others after sustaining cartilage damage and undergoing arthroscopic knee 
surgery. The No. 3 receiver for the Cougars, he had 30 catches for 548 yards 
and five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Bridgette Ealy of Cal State Northridge, a two-year starter and an 
All-California Collegiate Athletic Assn. selection as a sophomore, will 
redshirt the 1989-90 basketball season because of an injured right hamstring 
muscle. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ealy has played in four of the first eight games, she is eligible to 
redshirt. Ealy averaged 12.6 points, 5.9 rebounds and 3.1 assists last season. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Myers, the Royal High forward who averaged 19 points last season and 27 
points in two games this season, has contracted mononucleosis, according to 
Coach Joe Malkinson, and will be out for at least two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Friedemann, a senior defensive lineman, was selected most valuable player 
on the Cal Lutheran football team in a vote of players. Friedemann had seven 
sacks, two fumble recoveries and 57 total tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Ashley, who set a school freshman rushing record with 481 yards, was 
selected top running back. Offensive tackle David Bean was the top lineman and 
kicker Greg Maw was given the scholar-athlete award.

Consumer Debt Up Sharply in October: Americans took out $3.34 billion more in 
consumer credit than they retired in October, posting the biggest increase in 
net consumer debt in five months, the Federal Reserve Board reported. The Fed 
said consumer credit advanced in October at a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 5.7%, the sharpest increase since a 7.3% gain in May, when credit rose $4.21 
billion. Consumer credit outstanding had risen 2.3% in September, which was 
revised upward from the 1% increase originally reported. Net loan totals were 
adjusted from $606 million to $1.37 billion.

Producers Near CBS Deal: Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, the producers of 
television's top three programs -- NBC's "The Cosby Show" and "A Different 
World" and ABC's "Roseanne" -- were negotiating the final points of a deal with 
CBS on Thursday evening that would bring the executives to the network. CBS 
apparently will buy the pair's production company and name Carsey president of 
the entertainment division, informed sources said. An announcement could come 
today. Some TV industry sources said an agreement already has been reached, but 
neither side would confirm the reports. If such a deal is completed, last-place 
CBS could end up producing the biggest shows on TV -- for their rivals.

Two More Texas Banks Closed: Regulators closed two Texas banks, Aledo State 
Bank in Aledo and First National Bank of Frisco, bringing to 130 the number of 
bank failures in the state this year. The closures raised the total bank 
failures in the nation to 194 this year. Last year, there were 113 such 
failures in Texas and 200 in the nation. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
said the Aledo bank, with assets of $10.1 million will be taken over by 
Citizens National Bank in Weatherford. The Frisco bank, with assets of $8.7 
million, will be taken over by Hibernia National Bank in Pflugerville.

NINTENDO ACCUSED OF UNFAIR MARKETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN DAVIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While visions of Super Mario Brothers dance through the heads of millions of 
children this holiday season, the maker of the Nintendo home video system is 
playing unfair games with consumers, the chairman of a congressional antitrust 
panel charged Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dennis Eckart (D-Ohio) urged the Justice Department's antitrust division 
to investigate Nintendo of America, the U.S. subsidiary of the Japanese 
electronics firm that revived the electronic games industry and now controls 
80% of the $3.4-billion market. 
</P>
<P>
Eckart's complaint, outlined in an 11-page letter, contends that Nintendo has 
engaged in "unreasonable tactics to restrain competitors" by exercising rigid 
control over production of the game cartridges played on Nintendo consoles sold 
in America. 
</P>
<P>
Eckart, whose House small business antitrust subcommittee has investigated the 
video game industry, would like Nintendo to allow more companies to produce 
software for its machines with fewer strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is that software drives sales in this area," Eckart said in an 
interview. "Nintendo's dominance of the home video game market and its tight 
control of software production has led to an unprecedented level of control 
over the marketing end of the industry." 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo officials angrily denied Eckart's charges that unfair marketing 
practices have created their near-monopoly and accused the congressman of not 
giving them an opportunity to defend themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"He is just grandstanding," said Howard C. Lincoln, senior vice president of 
Nintendo of America, which is based in Redmond, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
In raising the issue less than three weeks before Christmas, Eckart could 
strike a chord with millions of parents across the country who are trudging to 
toy stores to buy Nintendo games and software -- and often finding them in 
short supply. 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo game systems and software have been among the biggest draws for toy 
retailers for two consecutive years, said Michael Karr, store manager at Toys R 
Us in Santa Ana. Altogether, video games account for as much as 25% of all toy 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
"There's quite a bit of traffic in that area," Karr said. "The software is 
doing quite well and is more than living up to sales projections." 
</P>
<P>
Popular software -- such as Super Mario Brothers, Legend of Zelda and Teen-Age 
Mutant Ninja Turtles -- sometimes is hard to find, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo's game-playing units retail for $80 or more, and game cartridges range 
in price from $30 to $60 each. Nintendo officials estimate that the company 
will have its systems in 20% of all U.S. households by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Only games licensed or sold by Nintendo can be played on Nintendo consoles. 
That practice ensures that independent software publishers cannot break into 
the Nintendo market, inflating the cost of games to consumers by 20% to 30%, 
Eckart said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ohio congressman contended that Nintendo has created artificial shortages 
of some games sold by licensed software producers and accused Nintendo of 
intimidating retailers to keep competitors' games off toy store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln said that Nintendo's business agreements and practices have been 
reviewed in depth and cleared by the company's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that (our business practices) fully comply with U.S. laws," 
he said. "They were designed to and have succeeded in restructuring a dead 
industry in the U.S. -- to the benefit of numerous small and large businesses 
from coast to coast, as well as retailers around the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Nintendo requires the installation of a patented computer chip, or "lock-out 
chip," in each game cartridge sold in the United States to ensure that only 
licensed cartridges can be used in Nintendo consoles. Lincoln said the chip is 
a security device aimed at preventing the sale and use of pirated, counterfeit 
or poor-quality games. 
</P>
<P>
Eckart disputed that claim. "If it were a question of quality control, they 
would use a lock-out chip in Japan -- which they don't." 
</P>
<P>
Eckart compared Nintendo's use of exclusive software arrangements and computer 
chip barriers to control the market -- known as bundling -- to a practice 
halted by International Business Machines in 1968 after a threat of Justice 
Department intervention.

LINCOLN WARNED ON UNSAFE LOANS, LETTERS SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A lawyer for Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan warned managers of the Irvine thrift 
nearly two years ago that its loans could be deemed "unsafe," government 
documents reveal. 
</P>
<P>
In four letters, a New York lawyer working for Lincoln questioned the lack of 
documentation for about 90 loans made by the thrift. Copies of the letters, 
which have not been made public, were obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the Office of Thrift Supervision told U.S. District Judge Stanley 
Sporkin in a trial that began Thursday that they would seek to enter the 
letters as evidence to determine whether regulators had sufficient grounds to 
seize Lincoln last April 14. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for the office, James P. Murphy, told Sporkin that the letters showed 
that Lincoln's own legal counsel was raising the same questions about its 
lending practices as government regulators. He added that regulators discovered 
the letters in the S&amp;L's files only in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Federal Election Commission said Thursday that it is 
investigating campaign contributions made by Lincoln owner Charles H. Keating 
Jr., his family and corporate associates. 
</P>
<P>
The commission inquiry is focusing initially on donations to Sen. John McCain 
(R-Ariz.), who requested the inquiry. But a commission spokesman suggested that 
the investigation could spread to four other senators who -- along with McCain 
-- intervened with federal regulators on Keating's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
The trial on Lincoln's $2-billion collapse is based on a lawsuit filed in 
Washington by S&amp;L's parent company, American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, 
challenging the government's seizure of the thrift on April 14. In addition, 
regulators have filed a $1.1-billion racketeering lawsuit against Keating and 
other managers of the failed thrift. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental claims that regulators lacked sufficient cause to take 
over the S&amp;L. The parent company filed for bankruptcy court protection on 
April 13 and wants control so that it can reorganize the thrift under 
bankruptcy laws. Now insolvent, Lincoln is expected to become the nation's 
costliest thrift failure. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Stern, American Continental's lawyer in the conservatorship challenge, 
declined to comment about the letters. He told Sporkin, however, that none of 
the issues in the trial involve the 90 loans discussed in the letters. 
</P>
<P>
One letter from Lois Gordon, a lawyer at Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; 
Handler in New York, praised Lincoln for improving its loan files but cautioned 
the S&amp;L about poor loan documentation. 
</P>
<P>
Keating, his son and one of his sons-in-law have been subpoenaed to testify in 
the trial. But they probably will not appear until January. After a second day 
of hearings today, Sporkin is expected to set a date next month to continue. 
</P>
<P>
The commission inquiry into the Keating group's donations to McCain may be 
broadened to include contributions to Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), Dennis 
DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John Glenn (D-Ohio) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), 
commission spokesman Scott Moxley indicated.

STUART KARL BACK IN HOME VIDEO AFTER BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Video entrepreneur Stuart Karl, who achieved fame and fortune with the Jane 
Fonda workout tapes and then suffered a series of reversals including a felony 
conviction and bankruptcy, has returned to the video business as president of a 
fledgling Los Angeles production company. 
</P>
<P>
Karl was named president of NAC Home Video, a unit of the closely held 
television production and record company Gold 'N M Communications. Gold 'N M 
Chairman Michael E. Marcovsky, himself a successful television and cellular 
telephone entrepreneur, said he hired Karl because of his "tremendous track 
record," referring to him as "Mr. Home Video." 
</P>
<P>
Karl, who has been a consultant for NAC for several months, will head the 
company's non-movie production efforts, such as a home videocassette of 
Thursday night's Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran prizefight. 
</P>
<P>
Marcovsky said he was unperturbed by Karl's ongoing legal and financial 
difficulties. Karl pleaded guilty last year to making $185,000 in illegal 
contributions to the political campaigns of presidential candidate Gary Hart 
and six congressmen, and was sentenced to three years probation and fined 
$60,000. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Karl filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, just as the Internal 
Revenue Service was preparing to auction off his 15,000-square-foot Newport 
Beach home for non-payment of $717,701 in federal taxes. Karl listed $3.9 
million in debts in the bankruptcy petition and no income or significant assets 
other than the home.

Documents in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana indicate that the Chapter 11 
petition, which protects a debtor from creditors while a repayment plan is 
being worked out, was converted to Chapter 7 bankruptcy last month. Chapter 7 
normally requires liquidation of assets to repay creditors, and the court has 
given permission for the home to be put on the market for $1.75 million.

Karl, 37, achieved his first business success with a collection of trade 
magazines and then achieved a spectacular coup in the budding home video 
business in 1984 when he persuaded Jane Fonda to record her workouts for sale 
on videocassette. The Fonda tapes were considered a landmark product in the 
then-undeveloped home video market, and they remain the best-selling non-movie 
tapes ever made. JONATHAN WEBER

The Soviet Union, US West Inc. and seven other telecommunications companies 
plan to form a venture to develop a fiber-optic line linking Japan, the Soviet 
Union and Europe, it was announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-mile line would be the longest fiber-optic line in the world, 
crossing the Soviet Union and making undersea connections to Denmark, Italy and 
Japan, US West said. 
</P>
<P>
The Englewood, Colo.-based communications company, a regional telephone company 
for much of the West, estimated that the project will take three to five years 
to complete once construction begins and will cost $500 million. US West said 
it hopes to begin construction in the second half of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The line will serve growing demand for communications capacity between the 
Pacific Rim and Europe and provide long-distance connections between Soviet 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will participate in 
the venture, called Trans-Soviet Line Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Other principals include Kokusai Denshin Denwa, Societa Finanziaria Telefonica 
of Italy, British Telecommunications PLC and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom and 
Australian and Danish firms.

FLUOR REPORTS SHARPLY HIGHER EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Citing growth in its engineering and construction business -- particularly 
overseas -- Fluor Corp. reported earnings Thursday of $108.5 million for fiscal 
1989, up 92.4% from net income of $56.4 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
The strong earnings punctuated Fluor's continuing three-year recovery since it 
began a painful restructuring and turned away from the oil and minerals 
business. The Irvine-based company's revenue for the year ended Oct. 31 was 
$6.23 billion, up 21.4% from 1988's $5.13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter, the company, the largest publicly held firm based in 
Orange County, reported earnings of $29.1 million on revenue of $1.67 billion, 
compared to earnings of $23.6 million on revenue of $1.61 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said Fluor's performance was on target with expectations. 
Wall Street reacted favorably to the earnings report, as Fluor's stock closed 
up $1.25 at $33.625 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
David S. Tappan Jr., who is stepping down as Fluor's chief executive next 
month, said the company's engineering and construction business did well, as 
did its coal and lead investments. He also attributed the company's financial 
growth to a 44% expansion of its international business, which accounted for $2 
billion of the company's $8.4-billion backlog of orders as of Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
"We are naturally pleased with our earnings progress last year but we still 
have a long way to go to produce the superior results we are capable of 
delivering," Tappan said in an interview Thursday. "I think Fluor Daniel's (the 
company's main operating unit) market strength and geographical diversification 
makes us very confident that we've only scratched the surface of the growth and 
earnings potential that lies ahead of us." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie G. McCraw, Fluor's president who is being promoted to chief executive in 
January and will succeed Tappan as Fluor chairman in 1991, is taking the reins 
at Fluor at a time when analysts predict its fortunes are on the upswing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think McCraw is taking over at a time when the momentum at the company is 
very, very strong. The backlog and the profit margins are still rising," said 
Mark Altman, a securities analyst with Paine Webber in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts expect Fluor to achieve greater profitability in 1990. Altman 
said he believes the company will generate net annual income of $150 million 
and Alan Dorsey, a securities analyst with Dillon, Read &amp; Co., said he 
expects the company will generate net income of between $160 million and $165 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Tappan said that with the prospects good for an extended growth cycle, the 
company will be investing in development and training of engineering and 
construction personnel and in computerized engineering and internal 
communications systems. 
</P>
<P>
Tappan, 67, postponed his retirement for two years to preside over the 
restructuring of Fluor. In 1985 and 1986, Fluor suffered heavy losses due to an 
ill-timed investment in the minerals business and a dive in oil prices that 
killed demand for the large petrochemical projects that were then Fluor's main 
source of revenue. LESLIE BERKMAN

Navistar International Corp.: The Chicago truck maker said net income for 
fiscal 1989 dropped 64% from last year to $87 million. Revenue was $4.2 
billion, about the same as last year. The company reported a fourth-quarter 
loss of $13 million, contrasted with a profit of $82 million in the same period 
a year ago. Navistar officials attributed the decline in earnings to reduced 
industrywide demand for medium and heavy trucks, and to pressure on truck 
margins from higher component costs. The company said earnings for the year 
were also lowered by costs incurred in assimilating a line of 27 new truck 
models.

BEHIND THE WHEEL: THE MERCEDES 500SL BUILDS ON YEARS OF ENGINEERING TO LIVE UP 
TO A REPUTATION FOR IMPECCABLE MOTORING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Wunderwerke that is this new, strapping, brazenly handsome Mercedes-Benz 
starts from its articulated top and works down. To a single button on the 
console that awaits the lazy pressure of one fingertip. 
</P>
<P>
At that touch, a hidden orchestra of 17 switches, 15 pressure cylinders, 11 
solenoid valves and one electric pump combine in an electro-hydraulic concert 
that opens and closes the 500SL like a two-ton cuckoo clock. 
</P>
<P>
Windows whisper down. A trunk lid flaps. Catches clack. Brackets bend and 
hinges hiss. There is a pause. 
</P>
<P>
Then the fully lined, sail-canvas convertible top slaps up, back and down to 
bury itself in the boot. In finale, the trunk lid flops flat, locking itself, 
and windows slide back up. There hasn't been this much mechanical movement from 
anything so typically German since yesterday's performances of the Glockenspiel 
in Munich's Marienplatz. 
</P>
<P>
And at a long traffic signal in Studio City, a crosswalk trio actually stopped 
to watch and then applaud the Mercedes' 30-second special effect. 
</P>
<P>
Techo-nonsense, maybe. Yet also clear verification of Mercedes' current 
commercials that do not undersell its 1990 duet of heavyweight sports cars (the 
300SL and 500SL) as: "The most passionate statement of engineering leadership 
Mercedes-Benz has ever made." 
</P>
<P>
Heritage and the 500SL's descent from the legendary 1954 300SL Gull Wing coupe 
(currently a more promising short-term investment than stock in IBM) has 
something to do with that engineering edge. So does the car's evolution through 
its 35-year ancestry and the 560SL it now replaces, and its reputation for 
impeccable, implacable motoring. 
</P>
<P>
Expensive? At $83,500 for a two-seater (the same price would buy five Mazda 
Miatas), inordinately so. Over-engineered? More than the first DC-3, which was 
tested by a tractor driving over its wing. Durable? As the Brandenburg Gate. 
</P>
<P>
But for the essential truth of a Mercedes 500SL, consider another European 
masterpiece, the Rolex watch. It is carved from a solid block of stainless 
steel or gold. It provides a unique heft, a distinctive integrity, a sense of 
total security from the strength of absolute indestructibility. 
</P>
<P>
Bugatti built cars like that in the '30s for decadent owners wanting to assume 
such poise and power. 
</P>
<P>
Mercedes still builds a car as if it was carved from a block into a two-ton 
ingot. Then the company peers into tomorrow's promising technology and 
automotive appointments, extracts the best and perfects them for today's 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
That convertible top is magic enough. But the car also has a spring-loaded roll 
bar that is hidden around the inner rim of the rear deck. It snaps upright in a 
30th of a second at critical roll angles. Or if one wheel lifts off the road. 
</P>
<P>
Most cars have power-adjustable side mirrors -- but Mercedes allows adjustment 
of the side mirrors and the interior rear-view mirror by the same button. 
</P>
<P>
Many automobiles have power-controlled seats with memory buttons for several 
drivers -- but Mercedes' memory stores three settings for seats, headrests, 
inside and outside mirrors and positions of the tilt and telescoping steering 
wheel. 
</P>
<P>
A singular pain of convertible motoring is its invitation to pilfering when 
parked with the top down. And the SL -- with seven compartments for the precise 
storage of everything from audio tapes in the center console, through 
sunglasses in a felt-lined dash box to parcels in bins beneath the back seat -- 
is a warren. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the car also comes with central key locking (or an infrared remote control) 
that secures both doors, the trunk, all mini-holds and the fuel filler lid. 
</P>
<P>
Safety in a Mercedes, however, is not confined to threats against your David 
Benoit tapes. 
</P>
<P>
In this new generation SL, it is extended fully to all occupants who, with the 
protection of that automatic roll bar and reinforcement of the windshield 
pillars, are surrounded by a virtual roll cage. 
</P>
<P>
There are driver-side and passenger air bags. Seat belts with instant inertia 
locking are mounted to cast-magnesium seat frames so that adjusting the seat 
does not change the set of the belt. Antilock disc brakes, of course, and that 
over-engineering for a frame and body tough enough to survive a collision with 
the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
Externally, the car has lost the angles and edges of previous years, with 
Mercedes' stylists choosing the poised, tiptoe look of a lowered front and 
elevated rear section. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion -- which doubtless will appall purists -- is of a German-built 
Corvette. 
</P>
<P>
In apparent pursuit of aerospace construction that seems to preoccupy many 
manufacturers today, Mercedes has gone to a composite for the aerodynamic skirt 
surrounding the SLs. That might not have been a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
Any plastic, even space shuttle, detracts from that substantial, robust Rolex 
image. Worse, the skirt is in a satin finish that forms a definite second-rate 
contrast to the deep, magnificent luster of the metal above. 
</P>
<P>
In thankful contrast, the interior of the 500SL is almost perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Wood actually twinkles, reflecting sunlight and clouds with the top down, and 
the leather has the tactility of a fine brogan. Instruments are large, analog 
and traditional. The seats would serve Malcolm Forbes' ante room, and any 
switch, any lever, works with that soft whisper of hair's-breadth tolerances. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is only one description for the odd symbology and controls of an 
otherwise peerless climate system and an equally super sound system: 
self-explanation achieving the inexplicable. 
</P>
<P>
Such nits, however, are nothing once the engine fires and the 500SL's enormous 
V8, with its four overhead cams and 32 valves, starts burbling and 
deep-breathing. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a 322-horsepower left hook. The car carries more punch per liter than 
the thunderous Corvette ZR-1, and that's quite enough to intimidate anything on 
the road save the ZR-1, Ferrari and Lamborghini. 
</P>
<P>
That any convertible can motor with only a hint of frame flex or twitch is 
simply incredible. That any rolling stock this heavy is able to deliver such 
pace and smoothness is a smidge short of miraculous. 
</P>
<P>
This car does not accelerate from stop or even the higher levels of its 
performance range. It explodes. The four-speed automatic is not just silken. It 
shifts and transfers power on diamonds dipped in ermine. 
</P>
<P>
The 500SL moves flat and stolid, and its weight goes virtually nowhere. Not 
even when accelerating briskly around a Cadillac braking desperately for a 
sweeping interchange of the Golden State and Glendale freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike so many other convertibles, wind rush and bulging of the soft top, is no 
part of the SL's progress even when approaching its performance perimeter. That 
limit, incidentally, is close to 170 m.p.h. that even on Germany's Autobahnen 
is electrically governed down to 155 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Suspension is taut on anything but billiard table surfaces (since Proposition 
13, however, these are mainly found in pool halls) because despite its 
opulence, distinction and Teutonic reserve, the SL was always born to be wild 
and sporty. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the Mercedes 500SL is the best reason we can think of for East 
Germans to continue moving west. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the high-performance luxury car market is over-dosing on 
comparisons. Prevalent is the debate surrounding Lexus and Infiniti versus 
Mercedes and BMW. 
</P>
<P>
It is, in truth, a non-argument. 
</P>
<P>
Japan does and always will, build its quality cars to rigid budgets. Mercedes 
goes after quality and technological supremacy with little attention to cost. 
</P>
<P>
That philosophy doesn't seem to have intruded upon success. 
</P>
<P>
The 500SL goes on sale in Southern California this month, and several dealers 
are reporting 60-customer waiting lists. Order a car now, said a Mercedes 
spokesman, and delivery will be "in excess of a year, at least." 
</P>
<P>
And out-of-state profiteers already are placing Los Angeles advertisements for 
minimal-mileage, used 500SLs. They are asking for $46,500 over list. That's the 
cost of about three more Miatas.

HIGH-PROFILE DIVORCE WARS ARE SYMBOLS OF WHAT HAS BECOME A TOUGH ERA FOR 
RELATIONSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"Because when I watch you eat, when I watch you sleep, when I look at you 
lately, I just want to smash your face in." Barbara Rose, explaining to her 
husband Oliver why she wants to divorce him, in the film "The War of the 
Roses." 
</P>
<P>
 It's said that war is hell. But a divorce war is even worse. 
</P>
<P>
At least, that's what Hollywood is saying this Christmas with the opening today 
of two black comedies about the ugliest of ugly marital split-ups -- those that 
deteriorate from sheer psychological trauma to actual physical tragedy. Just as 
"Fatal Attraction" put the spotlight on adultery, so these two movies expose 
divorce. 
</P>
<P>
In "She-Devil," middle-class housefrau Roseanne Barr gets revenge by ruining 
everything that's dear to husband Ed Begley Jr. after he leaves her for his 
rich and beautiful girlfriend Meryl Streep. 
</P>
<P>
In the slightly more realistic "The War of the Roses," a $25,000 Morgan classic 
car, $35,000 worth of Staffordshire porcelain and a $60,000 chandelier also are 
victimized when Michael Douglas and wife Kathleen Turner fight for possession 
of their home. Even Douglas' lawyer, played by Danny DeVito, didn't anticipate 
the results when he said: "A civilized divorce is a contradiction in terms." 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is that truer than in Los Angeles, home to the big-bucks break-up, 
where nasty divorces among the rich and famous are increasingly becoming the 
rule rather than the exception. "The problem is you have a cumbersome, costly 
and elaborate legal system attempting to work out problems that it was never 
designed to solve," explains attorney Hillel Chodos, who handled the so-called 
"reeking havoc" divorce between Giorgio perfume creators and store owners Fred 
and Gale Hayman. 
</P>
<P>
"People who are getting divorced usually come to the lawyer to solve problems 
that no one is qualified to solve. The legal system can divvy up the money 
somehow, but it can't make up for the fact that somebody promised to love your 
client and stopped doing it. So a lot of the fighting over money or children is 
really fighting over something else." 
</P>
<P>
And what's happening here seems to be afflicting the rest of the country as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"I talk to lawyers in Houston and Chicago and New York and divorces are getting 
nastier all over," says prominent Century City divorce lawyer Stuart Walzer. 
"It's a spiritual crisis. The whole damn society is suffering from greed and a 
fixation on material things. That makes this a very tough era for 
relationships."

It's no wonder that divorces during the '80s -- known popularly as the "Decade 
of Greed" -- escalated into a Porthault and Picasso feeding frenzy for 
separating spouses and their lawyers. The boom in real estate values 
transformed even the average home into a big-ticket item. Baby boomers competed 
in a consuming contest where the couple with the most stuff wins. The women's 
movement taught wives to fight for their rights down to the last Certificate of 
Deposit. No-fault proceedings moved the emphasis in divorces from adultery to 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
So when USC psychologist and divorce expert Constance Ahrons studied the 
relationships between divorced spouses over five years during the mid-'80s, she 
found nasty vs. nice uncouplings were roughly 50-50. 
</P>
<P>
Things seem to be going downhill from there for the people with the most at 
stake. Indeed, 1989 may go down in history as The Year of the Celebrity Split. 
Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden. Sean Penn and Madonna. Bruce Springsteen and 
Julianne Phillips. And just this week, James Woods and Sarah Owen announced 
their legal separation after five months of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, some couples managed to separate amicably -- Steven Spielberg and Amy 
Irving were seen having dinner together a few days before they called it quits 
-- but many others go through this most wrenching of life experiences with the 
legal and emotional equivalent of a wrecking ball. 
</P>
<P>
So what determines which divorces will be nasty and which will be nice? 
Dollars, a desire for revenge and sometimes even the divorce lawyers 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
California's 20-year-old no-fault divorce law was supposed to divide up 
community property more or less evenly. But exactly what constitutes community 
property -- ahh, there's the rub. The Byzantine legal system becomes bloodied 
when well-off couples have to negotiate tangibles, such as corporate 
divestitures, Platinum Triangle real estate and Laker season tickets as well as 
intangibles, such as the value to place on the loss of celebrity status for the 
soon-to-be-ex of a major star who suddenly finds he/she can't get a great table 
at Morton's anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"Oliver, there's no winning in this. There's only degrees of losing." Divorce 
attorney Gavin D'Amato advising his client in "The War of the Roses." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," responds Oliver Rose, "but I got more square footage." 
</P>
<P>
 It could be said that Spielberg could afford a pleasant parting because he 
gave Irving what is believed to be one of Hollywood's biggest divorce 
settlements, surpassing the $81-million award that one-time Beverly Hills 
resident Mohammed al Fassi was ordered to give to wife Dena in 1983, but 
falling short of the estimated $112 million that producer Norman Lear handed 
wife Frances Lear -- enough to start her own magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, when you have the kind of money Spielberg does, how tough is it?" notes 
L.A. superlawyer Howard Weitzman, who represented boxing champ Mike Tyson in 
his acrimonious divorce from actress Robin Givens. "It's simply, 'Listen, 
honey, I'm leaving you now and giving you $93 million, is that OK?' " 
</P>
<P>
The Tyson-Givens decision wasn't nearly so easy. Weitzman still exults over 
what he calls his TKO against Givens. "We made her look bad in the press and 
she caved in. The truth is, she could have gotten a lot of money" -- maybe as 
much as $10 million, he says. Weitzman estimates she received about a fourth of 
that amount. In fact, Tyson and Givens are still exchanging punches over 
property six months after their divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Think that's bad? Then how about actress Goldie Hawn and her ex Bill Hudson; 
even though they've got families with other people, they're fighting it out in 
the media over such thorny issues as child visitation rights and signatures for 
loans on Malibu real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, recent published reports say Kim Basinger's husband of eight years, 
makeup artist Ron Britton, is threatening to take their divorce case to trial 
-- where he says he will tell tales about some of the high-profile men who've 
been romantically linked with his wife -- if Basinger does not give him a 
multimillion dollar settlement. 
</P>
<P>
And though the couple, who filed for divorce a year ago, were able to resolve 
the house issue painlessly (Basinger let Britton keep the $700,000 manse), they 
can't seem to agree on who should get custody of their 10 dogs, assorted stray 
cats and half-dozen birds. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there's the tug-of-war over the million-dollar-plus home of actors Harry 
Hamlin ("L.A. Law") and Laura Johnson ("Heartbeat"). Just like the characters 
in "The War of the Roses," neither Hamlin nor Johnson will move out. So, 
according to legal circles, they've split up the domicile complete with two 
demilitarized zones. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Hamlin's publicist, Annette Wolf, claims everything is "extremely 
amicable -- to the extent there's a Christmas tree in the house." Of course, 
she also declared in August that her client's marriage "couldn't be more 
solid"; a day later, Hamlin filed for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd better get yourself a damn good lawyer." Oliver Rose to his wife in "The 
War of the Roses." 
</P>
<P>
 "Best your money can buy," Barbara Rose replies. 
</P>
<P>
Gale Hayman, for one, maintains she tried not to mix assets with acrimony when 
her 20-year marriage to Fred Hayman ended in 1983. Still, it degenerated into a 
legal siege that didn't end until 1987 when Avon Products Inc. paid $185 
million to buy the Beverly Hills company Giorgio Inc., which they ran jointly 
even after their divorce was final. 
</P>
<P>
Now Gale has her own cosmetics company, and Fred has his "Fred Hayman" store on 
Rodeo Drive. Avon now owns the Giorgio name and perfume but gone is the Beverly 
Hills boutique Giorgio, a casualty of the divorce. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no intentions of it getting nasty. I anticipated no problems 
whatsoever," maintains Gale, whose divorce is now the subject of a just 
published book, "Reeking Havoc," by Women's Wear Daily writer Steve Ginsburg. 
"It doesn't have to be nasty if people are fair. But being unfair creates 
nastiness and results in a nasty divorce." 
</P>
<P>
The sticking point became the business that both of them started when Fred 
Hayman was the maitre d' at Romanoff's restaurant and Gale was a cocktail 
waitress. "I was fighting for my life. I was fighting for my career," she 
claims. "And the stalemate that ensued was a surprise to me." 
</P>
<P>
In Hayman's view, men like her husband aren't emotionally prepared to deal with 
a settlement where "women stand up for what they believe is morally and 
economically right. They're not being manipulated as easily anymore. They're 
more informed and more self-confident than years ago. And I guess that 
ultimately means a messier divorce." 
</P>
<P>
Prominent divorce lawyer Paul Gutman agrees that women are becoming more 
assertive in pursuing their share of community property. "Unfortunately, that's 
often mischaracterized as over-aggressiveness," he says. "But if a woman is 
truly assertive in her divorce, then that's to be commended." 
</P>
<P>
While Fred Hayman doesn't comment on any aspect of the divorce, Gale Hayman can 
look back and realize that at issue weren't the usual material possessions 
which couples have difficulty splitting; Gale claims she left "everything" in 
their sumptuous home to Fred because "the style of the house was more his than 
mine. I just moved my clothes out." 
</P>
<P>
However, as real estate prices soar, especially in Southern California, the 
concept of two divorcing spouses living under the same roof isn't rare or even 
bizarre. Downtown divorce attorney Pat Phillips, who represents many prominent 
L.A. professionals, "always" advises her clients to remain in the family 
residence unless there's a "physically dangerous situation. But, then, I'm not 
in the position of representing clients wielding knives." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips' so-called "house strategy" is derived from normal human nature, she 
says: the emotion of envy, pure and simple. "Any time one client stays in the 
lovely home with all the amenities and the other moves into a bare apartment, I 
can guarantee that before too long the client in the apartment is going to be 
madder than hell." 
</P>
<P>
Dividing up possessions can't help but become petty. Gutman recalls one couple 
who were able to settle the disposition of their multimillion-dollar house with 
no problem only to come to a standstill over a collection of junk. "These were 
plates about 10 degrees beneath Hummel copies," Gutman sniffs. "The house went 
beautifully but the plates caused real anguish. I don't even remember how it 
all turned out. I only remember the process." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, as in the rest of the country, the nastiest divorces often 
occur when one spouse goes after the other's business as community property. 
According to local legal circles, one of the worst examples of this is being 
played out right now in Glendale Superior Court by feminist attorney Gloria 
Allred and her businessman husband, William. 
</P>
<P>
Although the couple divorced in 1987, Gloria is seeking half of her 
ex-husband's share in his aerospace company, Donallco Inc., while William is 
seeking half of his ex-wife's holdings in her law firm, Allred, Maroko, 
Goldberg &amp; Ribakoff. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria, who usually courts media attention for her flamboyant cases, has sought 
to keep the personal drama as low-key as possible, quietly slipping into court 
without the usual trail of TV cameras. (Her ex-husband can't appear at all; he 
is serving a five-year sentence in a federal prison in Texas after being 
convicted in 1987 of conspiring to defraud the government by selling bogus 
aircraft parts to the Air Force.) 
</P>
<P>
Still the tension is almost tangible. The reason, according to legal observers, 
is that the case is pitting two of L.A.'s pit bull divorce lawyers against each 
other: Arlene Colman-Schwimmer who is representing William Allred vs. Paul 
Gutman for Gloria. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you call 500 divorce lawyers at the bottom of the ocean? An excellent 
start." Divorce attorney Gavin D'Amato to a prospective client. 
</P>
<P>
Divorce lawyers themselves are the first to admit that they should ensure that 
divorces don't get nasty. The trouble is some can't do it. And others simply 
won't. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Stuart Walzer blames this on the growing competition among divorce 
attorneys, especially in Southern California where a dozen top-drawer 
specialists are in constant demand by the affluent despite hourly rates as high 
as $500. Thousands more are hungry for any case at all. "The reality is that 
clients can leave at the drop of the hat and find another attorney and this 
makes the lawyers very nervous," explains Walzer. "And then the clients can sue 
for malpractice, and this makes the lawyers crazy." 
</P>
<P>
The result is that high-priced lawyers go for the jugular in divorce cases -- 
not just because their clients want them to, but because they're good at it. 
For them, keeping a divorce from deteriorating into a "Full Metal Jacket"-like 
affair is about as difficult as keeping an attack dog on a leash. "Most lawyers 
are so eager to win and be hotshots that they get carried away with their own 
zeal. They want desperately to win and look good and talk about their 
million-dollar clients," says Walzer, sighing. 
</P>
<P>
"And here I am doing the very same thing." 
</P>
<P>
To show just how bad things can get, Walzer and Gutman went at it in the 
divorce case, settled in July, of Elizabeth Niklas and high-profile Beverly 
Hills restaurateur Kurt Niklas, part-owner of The Bistro and the Bistro Garden. 
The lawyers hurled charges back and forth in a case legal sources describe as 
one of the messiest in L.A. history. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's why some prominent attorneys are refusing to handle divorce cases 
anymore except in special circumstances. Howard Weitzman, who describes himself 
as a "utility lawyer," admits he "hates" divorce cases and tries to pass them 
to other lawyers. And Hillel Chodos says he's all but given them up unless a 
close friend needs his help. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just too strenuous. People call you up in the middle of the night, 
saying, 'Do you know what he did? Can you imagine what she said?' C'mon, give 
me a break," he complains. "And then there are all those lawyers in the divorce 
field who are consciously milking their cases. But people should have better 
sense than that. 
</P>
<P>
"What I never understand is why buy your lawyer a Mercedes when you can buy 
your wife a Mercedes? And in the process, keep her your friend?" 
</P>
<P>
Even now, Gale Hayman shudders when she looks back on what her divorce cost her 
and her ex-husband. It got to the point where she was interviewing two lawyers 
a day for two weeks just to hear that no one could dispose of her case before 
1992. "Because it was very lucrative for them to do that," she explains. "It 
was like an annuity -- a nice big fat monthly check from Fred and Gale." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, she sought help from Chodos, who told her he could conclude 
negotiations in just three months. She jumped at the chance. "My common sense 
told me there'd be nothing left of the business. There'd be nothing left of 
Fred. There'd be nothing left of me in five years. And the lawyers would be 
very wealthy. The whole key is finding the right lawyer who you can communicate 
with and does what you want . And then, of course, being clear what you want." 
</P>
<P>
 "When a man who makes $450 an hour wants to tell you something for free, you'd 
better listen." Divorce attorney Gavin D'Amato to a prospective client in "The 
War of the Roses." 
</P>
<P>
 Chodos recalls the time an old friend decided to divorce his wife of 20 years. 
"I had handled a lot of litigation for him and he was the toughest guy that 
ever lived. He loved to litigate. It was his hobby. And he could afford to hire 
lawyers up the wazoo." 
</P>
<P>
The friend told Chodos, "Here's my offer. If they don't take it, I'm going to 
take it to the end of the world." Chodos was horrified. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Take my advice. I'm your friend for 15 years. Don't take it to the 
end of the world. You've got so much money you can't spend it in your life 
anyway. Give a little extra. What difference can it make?' So I arm-wrestled 
him down. And he's gone out and made 50 times that amount since. The point is 
he was able to go on with his life in two weeks instead of four years. And he 
still thanks me." 
</P>
<P>
Chodos waits a beat before delivering the story's punchline. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think in all the years he was the only client who took my advice."

BENEFIT GALA HERALDS ART FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The fourth International Contemporary Art Fair opened Wednesday night at the 
L.A. Convention Center with a gala preview that could only have taken place in 
the turbulent art world of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the most important developments this year in the world art market were 
mirrored there: skyrocketing prices for blue-chip collectible art, the toll 
that AIDS continues to take in the American art community, and controversy over 
government funding for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Opening night was a benefit for the Los Angeles Pediatric AIDS Consortium, a 
collection of clinics and hospitals that treat mothers and children with 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
"Freedom of expression in this country is under attack," Mayor Tom Bradley said 
in a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Art fair director Brian Angel greeted guests and 
benefit chairman Doug Cramer presented an award to Councilman Joel Wachs, who 
fought for passage of a city endowment for the arts and an end to AIDS 
discrimination in the city. Also honored were British artists Gilbert &amp; 
George, whose contributions to the fight against AIDS included $1 million 
raised from one exhibit alone. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, art collectors moved quickly from booth to booth. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen a lot of stuff we love -- all with signs that say Sold," said 
collectors Peter and Eileen Norton, taking a snack break at the fair's lavish 
buffet. Fair organizer Charlie Scheips was more sanguine, sipping a drink and 
dealing with constant interruptions from his walkie-talkie. 
</P>
<P>
"The hard job is over," he said, "and now it's time to have a party."

FIRST PERSON: TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A TOY CAN RUIN YOUR HOLIDAY SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY DAVIS, Davis is a Portland, Ore., dentist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now I know what the writers of tax forms do for a living during their 
off-season: They write instruction manuals. 
</P>
<P>
It's that time of year when unsuspecting consumers are off to buy holiday 
presents that sprout the phrase "assembly required." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the words are boldly displayed; but often the phrase is lettered in 
tiny print, somewhere below "Made in Czechoslovakia." 
</P>
<P>
Beware of the modifier "some." What is the difference between "some assembly 
required," and "assembly required"? Perhaps the manufacturer is trying to 
convince you, in using the word "some," that only a little bit is left to do. 
This is not necessarily so. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the carton will state the time needed for assembly. "Takes only 
minutes to assemble" is an indicator of trouble. Why wasn't the manufacturer 
more specific? Minutes lead into hours. Hours lead into days. 
</P>
<P>
I purchased a swing set for my kids, and on the box it said, "three-minute 
frame assembly." It took three days for my father-in-law (who is an engineer) 
and me to put the thing together. The frame may have taken only three minutes; 
but the swings, ladder, slide, glider and "sky shooter" required the other 
4,317 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Another indicator of potential trouble is a listing of tools needed for 
assembly. If nothing is said about tools, you can assume that you will need a 
complete workshop because they didn't have the room to list all the tools that 
are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
If the label calls for a hammer, then assume that none of the parts really fit 
together, but will require smashing into place. One set of directions I have 
calls for a hammer and a block of wood. The manufacturers apparently didn't 
want the buyer to mar the finish on the metal while pounding the bolts through 
the holes that didn't quite match up. 
</P>
<P>
Watch for tool lists that say "adjustable wrench." "Adjustable" hints that 
assembly requires a variety of nuts and bolts, none of which fit any 
standard-size wrench or socket set. 
</P>
<P>
Be aware that if the tool list specifies both a slotted-tip and a Phillips 
screwdriver, then the makers also expect you to know the difference between 
things like axle bolts, shoulder bolts, carriage bolts and hex bolts. 
</P>
<P>
Never purchase anything that comes with its own "Special Tool." The "Special 
Tool" will bend. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, remember that locking nuts come loose easily. 
</P>
<P>
If you get as far as opening the box and finding the instruction manual, watch 
for these pitfalls: 
</P>
<P>
I bought an outdoor gas barbecue grill that came with two instruction booklets. 
On the front of instruction Book "B" was a big rectangle with the words: "READ 
INSTRUCTION BOOK 'A' FIRST!" 
</P>
<P>
Were they afraid to give away the surprise ending? Needless to say, the tools 
needed included an adjustable wrench, slotted and Phillips screw drivers, and a 
hammer. Any fool could have seen that the summer would be over before I could 
get that grill together. 
</P>
<P>
Look at the manual. Is it larger than the telephone book? 
</P>
<P>
Does the manual have the words caution or important printed in bold letters? 
These are put in to specify paragraphs that are garbled or misprinted, so that 
you can't feel confident about what you are doing. 
</P>
<P>
If the instructions are printed in four languages, and the German is more 
understandable than the English, return the item before any further unpacking. 
But I have to give the German instructions credit. They don't make up words, 
like "bell-shaped washer." They call a wassergeschutzten a wassergeschutzten. 
</P>
<P>
If the instructions say that this manual contains assembly instructions for 
more than one model, assume that every picture or illustration is for the model 
that you don't have. After spending more than one hour trying to locate Slot D, 
take the asterisk seriously and read at the bottom of the page in small print 
that your model does not come with Slot D. 
</P>
<P>
Does the manual have a parts list? Does the list have more parts than the 
corner hardware store? 
</P>
<P>
Are there full-scale drawings of the parts? Do the parts included in the 
unopenable plastic bag look anything like the pictures? 
</P>
<P>
Does the instruction manual have "exploded" drawings? These are drawings that 
show each part with a dotted line leading to where it theoretically should end 
up. Does the exploded drawing have smaller close-up exploded drawings of 
"special assemblies?" That means the draftsman could not figure out where the 
parts fitted onto the whole. (If a separate instruction book is included for a 
"special assembly," then stop payment on your check.) 
</P>
<P>
Never attempt to assemble a product that has a toll-free number to call for 
help. If you couldn't understand the instructions while looking at the manual 
and parts, how do you think you are going to communicate your problem over the 
phone to somebody in Illinois?

A SOLUTION TO DANCE ABOUT; 
</P>
<P>
CONCERT: THREE CHOREOGRAPHERS TEAM UP TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF FINDING A STAGE 
TO HOLD A CONCERT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three choreographers in search of a concert stage have found a single solution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very expensive to produce a concert on your own," said San Diego-based 
dance maker Pamela Turner. "Even companies have a hard time because there 
aren't many (affordable) venues in San Diego. But it's really tough for 
independent choreographers. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, it takes so long for me to create enough pieces to fill a whole 
program, it would be at least two years between concerts if I did the whole 
concert. That's why I try to find artists I respect and work with them." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Turner teamed up with Cate Bell, a local independent who turned out 
to be something of a kindred spirit. The results were so rewarding for both of 
them that they decided to have another go at co-presenting this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Choreographer James Kelly was invited to add his modern jazz perspective to the 
kinetic mix -- after Turner discovered his work at a recent low-tech concert. 
The threesome will unveil a program of new works at Sushi Gallery on Friday and 
Saturday night at 8 o'clock. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the motivation for getting together was economics," Turner 
acknowledged, "but I like working with people like Cate and James. We 
complement each other." 
</P>
<P>
The concert, "When Choices Count," takes its name and its thematic content from 
two of the major works on the program -- Turner's "Choices," a dramatic theater 
piece, and Bell's "What Number Were You Expecting?" an abstract suite of dances 
that serves as the curtain-raiser the concert. 
</P>
<P>
"My piece is about making choices," said Turner, "and Cate's is more abstract. 
It's about numbers. That's why we came up with 'When Choices Count.' " 
</P>
<P>
Where does Kelly fit into this odd equation? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really fit into the theme," he noted. "Mine is a straight jazz dance 
-- I don't want to call it just entertainment, but it's pure movement." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no message in mine either," Bell interjected. "I'm more interested in 
abstraction. It's almost as if I'm painting with time and space, moving and 
composition. I don't really have anything to say in my dances. 
</P>
<P>
"'What Number Were You Expecting?' is just abstract modern dance -- no story," 
she explained. "I'm just playing with numbers and groupings. (The dancers) have 
to count a lot, so it takes concentration." 
</P>
<P>
Turner, who spearheaded the concert with support from the San Diego Area Dance 
Alliance's Independent Artist Grant Program, definitely had something to say 
when she conceived her angst-filled foursome, "Choices," a 40- minute theater 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"I always have something to say," she said. "I'm driven by what I have to say." 
</P>
<P>
In "Choices," relationships and the complex emotions they generate, are the 
driving force for Turner. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dance about the repercussions of making choices. First, the dance and 
theater sections are entirely separate (with two actors and two dancers 
interpreting the feelings), but later there's an integration of the dancers and 
the actors. It becomes a cohesive marriage of dance and theater." 
</P>
<P>
Turner credits an original score by composer Mary Kidd (using keyboard, 
synthesizer and a Midi interface to a computer) for the jarring emotional 
depths tapped in the dance. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to add a hopeful ending," she said, "otherwise the audience would be 
completely devastated by it." 
</P>
<P>
The performers in this ad hoc ensemble were culled from different quarters of 
the dance and theater community. However, there is one name that shows up in 
every piece on the program. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonnie Haig (who danced last weekend at Jazz Unlimited's season-opener) is the 
one constant," said Bell. "We all worked with her." 
</P>
<P>
Bell also has choreographed a solo section for her new dance suite on herself. 
</P>
<P>
She said with a laugh that she thought she was retired from dancing. "But it 
was more practical to work on the solo myself, instead of trying to find 
someone else at that point." 
</P>
<P>
Turner is 38 and a new mother, but as she pointed out, "I'm not ready to give 
up. I love to perform." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly is the only one of the three who won't appear on this program. The busy 
choreographer insists he has no intention of returning to the other side of the 
footlights. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly don't," he assured. "I never really wanted to be a performer. When 
I first started dancing, I knew I wanted to be a choreographer, but I realized 
I would have to learn the nuts and bolts first. You learn from watching other 
choreographers work. You really can't learn how to be a choreographer in 
school." 
</P>
<P>
If this pair of performances are successful, the three independent dance makers 
hope to work even more closely in future productions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping to do some collaborative work as the next step," said Turner. Bell 
is game, but she has collaborated with other artists in the past. Only Kelly, a 
self-professed "obsessive," has any real doubts about the results of this kind 
of artistic give and take. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to try, but I don't know how I'd do in that situation. I'd probably 
be the difficult one," he said, only half in jest.

Bogus Bogie Coat: Christie's East, the New York auction house, has withdrawn an 
item listed as the raincoat Humphrey Bogart wore in "Casablanca" from next 
week's sale of Hollywood memorabilia. It turns out that Bogart didn't really 
wear the trench coat in "Casablanca," only in a promotion for the movie. 
Christie's experts had been expecting the coat to bring as much as $20,000.

PROGRAM OF VILLA-LOBOS AT CSUN DISPLAYS BRAZILIAN COMPOSER'S UNUSUAL BLEND OF 
TRADITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WYMA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Heitor Villa-Lobos was a hard man to classify during his career as a musician 
and composer, and the task has not gotten any easier in the 30 years since his 
death. Brazil's tireless innovator delighted in unusual meldings of ideas from 
his classical training and from his homeland's popular music. The result is too 
idiosyncratic to be imitated and too delightful to be overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup of a Villa-Lobos concert coming Tuesday to Cal State Northridge 
shows the extent of the composer's playfulness. Among the scheduled works are 
"Bachianas Brasileiras 5," one of his nine suites that interpret Bach from a 
Brazilian musical tradition. The piece uses eight cellos and a soprano to 
surprisingly lilting effect. Singing will be Janet Momjian, a CSUN student who 
won last year's Metropolitan Opera Western regional competition. 
</P>
<P>
Also to be performed is "Sextuor Mystique," or "Mystical Sextet," which 
features flute, oboe, alto saxophone, harp, guitar and celesta. 
</P>
<P>
"How's that for a collection of instruments," said David Aks, director of the 
CSUN Symphony and one of the principal organizers of Tuesday's concert. "It's a 
very unusual sound. 
</P>
<P>
Aks said the Villa-Lobos works will be performed as chamber pieces by a loosely 
knit collection of students and faculty, including Music Department Chairman 
Jerry Luedders, a saxophonist. About 16 performers will take part, with no more 
than nine appearing at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"We just ignore Latin American composers in this country, which is a big 
mistake," Aks said. "With Villa-Lobos, some of the music is more European 
sounding, and a lot of it has a strong Latin flavor. It's lively, it's rhythmic 
and it's tuneful." 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the event came from Gustavo Neiva Tavares, 28, a Brazilian who is 
pursuing a master's degree in music at CSUN. Tavares, a cellist like Aks, was 
first cello for Brazil's National Theater and studied six years in West 
Germany. He has done considerable research into Villa-Lobos, who wrote more 
than 1,300 works. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the most important composer in Brazil and one of the most important on 
the American continent," Tavares said. "He played many instruments: cello, 
guitar, piano. He came from a family where music was very alive. He was very 
interested in music but also very independent and did not want to go into 
academic settings." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the composer traveled widely in Brazil, learning the popular music. 
</P>
<P>
"He developed a need to become more Brazilian to be honest as a musician," 
Tavares said. "Of course, much of the popular music is by guitar. As a cellist, 
Villa-Lobos played opera and serious music, and as a guitarist he is much more 
acquainted with Brazilian popular music." 
</P>
<P>
Tavares said the works of Villa-Lobos expose the myth of Brazil as a land of 
little more than sun, bananas and simple, bright music. 
</P>
<P>
"He had many ideas about orchestration that were not European. Because of that, 
many people, like Artur Rubinstein and Aaron Copland were influenced by him. 
There is a very rich, complex culture behind him that allowed him to become 
great." 
</P>
<P>
The concert will last about an hour and a half. Preceding it will be a talk by 
Robert Stevenson, a music professor at UCLA who has studied Latin American 
music extensively. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chamber Music of Villa-Lobos" will be Tuesday, Dec. 12, at 8 p.m. in the 
Little Theatre, Speech-Drama Building, Cal State Northridge, 18111 Nordhoff St. 
Tickets are $5 and $2 for students and seniors. For information call 
818-885-3180.

POLICE OFFICER CONVICTED OF KILLING 2 MIAMI BLACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A jury found police officer William Lozano guilty of two counts of manslaughter 
Thursday in the deaths of two black men last January. The verdict in the highly 
charged trial sent shock waves of surprise and relief through Miami, a city 
that for days had been braced for a riot if an acquittal were handed down. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the system had never worked for the black community," said Willie 
Sims, crisis coordinator of the Dade County Community Relations Board. "Today 
it worked. It's my personal feeling that justice has been served." 
</P>
<P>
That feeling was widespread throughout much of Miami's black community. "This 
is an extraordinary, even historic, verdict," said Marvin Dunn, a sociology 
professor at Florida International University who has studied Miami's bloody 
record of civil unrest in this decade. "This kind of case almost always goes in 
the favor of police officers." 
</P>
<P>
The verdict was read to a packed courtroom and over live television to all of 
South Florida at 12:50 p.m., two hours after the jury first signaled that a 
decision had been reached. The reading was held up while security at the 
courthouse was tightened and police units were readied for possible action. 
</P>
<P>
Lozano, 31, was accused of deliberately firing at an oncoming motorcycle ridden 
by Clement Lloyd, 23, and passenger Allan Blanchard, 24. Lloyd was killed 
instantly by a bullet to the head; Blanchard died of injuries the next day. 
Lozano contended that he had shot in self- defense. The deaths touched off 
three days of rioting in the city's predominantly black Overtown section. 
</P>
<P>
Lozano, a short, dark-haired man with a pudgy face, remained expressionless as 
the clerk read out the verdict: guilty on one count of manslaughter with a 
firearm, guilty on one count of manslaughter without a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
Lozano's wife, Ana, broke into tears, and one of his three brothers looked 
stricken. That brother and Lozano's wife also are Miami police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Lozano's defense attorney, Roy Black, had his head down and his hands folded as 
if in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
In Black's office afterward, Lozano -- still very composed -- said, "I was not 
given a fair trial from the beginning. There was a lot of evidence denied and 
quashed." 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing was set for Jan. 24, when Lozano could face a maximum of 30 years in 
prison on the most serious charge. Conviction of a charge of manslaughter with 
a gun carries a three-year minimum sentence in Florida. Meanwhile, he remains 
free on $10,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
The trial began with jury selection on Oct. 23, but for weeks prior to that 
expectations had been rising that, if Lozano were acquitted of the charges, the 
black community would erupt in violent protest. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the acquittal by an all-white jury of several police officers charged 
with beating to death another black motorcyclist resulted in a vicious 
three-day riot in which 18 persons died. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, violent street protests broke out after another black man was shot to 
death in Overtown by a Latino police officer. And rioting erupted two years 
later when that officer, Luis Alvarez, was found not guilty by an another 
all-white jury, which had heard an impassioned defense by Roy Black. 
</P>
<P>
The Lozano case -- although haunted by violence, and the threat of more 
violence, from the start -- was different. Dade Circuit Judge Joseph Farina 
seemed determined to see an ethnically balanced jury seated, and he did. There 
were two blacks, one Latino and three Anglos -- two men and four women. 
</P>
<P>
One of the blacks -- Ezra Simmons, a 61-year-old vice president of a mail 
handlers' union who lives in Miami's Liberty City -- was elected foreman. He 
was also the man Black tried hard to keep off the panel. 
</P>
<P>
During jury selection, Black opted to excuse Simmons, using one of his 
peremptory challenges. But Farina ruled that the move was racially motivated. 
Black, contending that the man was biased against Latinos, appealed the judge's 
order to a higher court. The judge's ruling was sustained. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bitter irony," Black said, "that the man we most feared ended up being 
the foreman." 
</P>
<P>
The rulings by Farina and the state appeals court are sure to form the basis of 
the appeal Black said he would file. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant State Atty. John Hogan, who prosecuted, said on the steps of the 
courthouse after the trial: "I take no pleasure in convicting a police officer, 
but I take a great deal of pleasure in realizing the system works." 
</P>
<P>
Miami Police Chief Perry Anderson, who himself is black, said he understood 
that "it's a difficult time for some of the individuals who have worked with 
this particular officer to accept the verdict, but I think they are 
professionals and will continue to be professionals . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Kinne, head of the police union that represents most of Miami's 
1,093 officers, said that "most of my members are in shock. We all felt William 
Lozano was justified" in using deadly force. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the average officer's reaction, Kinne added: "He's seriously 
thinking what he's going to do in a life-threatening situation. He could become 
concerned and hesitant out in the street." 
</P>
<P>
The case began early on the night of Jan. 16, when Lozano and his partner were 
stopped on a street in Overtown. While Lozano searched the trunk of his squad 
car for a report form, a motorcycle being pursued by a police car because of a 
traffic violation roared toward him. Lozano stepped into the street, pulled out 
his 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol and fired a single shot, killing Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
Lozano contended that he had had no time to escape being hit by the motorcycle. 
"I thought he was going to run me down," he said from the witness stand. "I 
thought I was a dead person." 
</P>
<P>
But the prosecution contended that Lozano, violating police training and common 
sense, stepped into the path of the motorcycle, aimed, tracked the driver in 
his sights and fired when the vehicle drew near. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to believe a police officer could do something so stupid," said 
Hogan in his closing arguments Tuesday. "But this man, on Jan. 16, pulled the 
trigger of a gun and snuffed out two lives." 
</P>
<P>
The 58 witnesses who testified gave often-conflicting accounts of what they had 
seen and heard. 
</P>
<P>
But the case apparently held no particular confusion for the jurors. They 
deliberated for a little more than seven hours before reaching a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Miami Thursday morning, the air was electric with tension and 
anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
Many teachers allowed their students to watch the courtroom proceedings from 
classroom television sets. Some radio stations urged people to drive with their 
lights on in a collective plea to refrain from violence once the decision 
became known. 
</P>
<P>
The halls of the county courthouse were jammed with reporters, lights and 
cameras, along with scores of curious people. Police officers, on alert and 
working 12-hour shifts since Tuesday, seemed to be everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm optimistic we're not going to have any problems," said Miami police 
spokesman David Rivero a few minutes before the jury filed back into the 
courtroom. "I think this community is going to act responsibly." 
</P>
<P>
But, in fact, there were a few problems Wednesday night as rumors that Lozano 
has been acquitted swept the community. Sporadic stone- and bottle-throwing was 
reported at one Overtown intersection, and a few blocks away a car was set 
afire. 
</P>
<P>
After the verdict, police remained on alert. But, in the black communities of 
Overtown and Liberty City, especially, tension had given way to a celebration 
ignited by the feeling that justice had been served. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a time for rejoicing," said Billy Hardamon, leader of a group called 
People United for Justice. 
</P>
<P>
In the Latino community, there was disappointment and anger but no sign of 
street protests. Latinos in Miami are a majority and play a much bigger role in 
the power structure than do blacks.

EAST BLOC: CIVIC FORUM REASSURES THE SOVIETS ON ITS INTENT TO KEEP NATION IN 
WARSAW PACT. DEFENSE CHIEF VOWS ARMY WILL NOT USE FORCE TO PROP UP REGIME.

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec resigned Thursday, opening the way for the 
possibility of the nation's first non-Communist government since 1946, and 
representatives of the country's main opposition group held meetings with the 
defense minister and the Soviet Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition group, Civic Forum, reassured the Soviets that its leaders favor 
remaining in the Warsaw Pact, at least for the present. Defense Minister Gen. 
Miroslav Vacek, meanwhile, reassured Civic Forum's leader, Vaclav Havel, that 
the Czechoslovak army would not use force to prop up the toppling Communist 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with those assurances, Civic Forum for the first time Thursday publicly 
revealed its position in negotiations over a new government, a sweeping set of 
demands that would relegate the Communists to minority status and elevate to 
the rank of deputy prime minister two men who until recently were in jail for 
opposition activities. One of the two would become the second-ranked official 
in a new government; the second would become a deputy prime minister in charge, 
among other things, of the state security police. 
</P>
<P>
Until Wednesday, Civic Forum, which insists it is not a political party, 
refused even to formally offer names of ministers it would support. 
</P>
<P>
The Communists first came to power here in 1946 after winning 38% of the vote 
in the nation's last free election and forming a coalition government. In 
February, 1948, the party staged a coup to block new elections and seized full 
power. 
</P>
<P>
But now Communist power here is crumbling. Thursday, in a bid to retain some 
public credibility, the Communists, who will hold an emergency congress Dec. 
20-21, expelled from the party two of its most powerful figures as of only 
three weeks ago -- former party General Secretary Milos Jakes and former Prague 
party chief Miroslav Stepan. 
</P>
<P>
The party has sought to fix blame on Jakes and Stepan for the Nov. 17 police 
attack on student demonstrators that launched this nation's peaceful 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Fixing blame has become crucially important to the remaining Communist 
officials as they witness the arrests of former Communist leaders across the 
border in East Germany and hear increasing calls here for punishment of those 
involved in the Nov. 17 attack as well as the Soviet invasion that suffocated 
the last reform effort here, in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever has a bad conscience is afraid of justice," playwright Havel said at a 
press conference Thursday night. "I am not out for revenge," he added, "but I 
think justice should take its course." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Civic Forum demanded the right to name historians to a panel 
that will investigate 1968, and student leaders announced they were supplying 
guards to keep watch over party and government archives to prevent officials 
from destroying evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Adamec and the expulsions of Jakes and Stepan increase the 
pressure for the resignation of the last member of the Communist old guard 
still in a position of power, President Gustav Husak. Havel called repeatedly 
on Husak to quit, as did speaker after speaker at a convention of a reform 
group within the party. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Adamec was on the reform edge of Czechoslovak politics. Last week, 
he was seen as a key transitional figure. By Thursday, events had passed him 
by. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the reform group within the Communist Party, Democratic Forum, met 
with Civic Forum on Thursday seeking support, but Civic Forum offered a 
noncommittal response. 
</P>
<P>
Where once the opposition was negotiating to see how much it could wrangle from 
the Communists, now the question appears to be how far the Communists will have 
to go to retain the support of Civic Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The terms, outlined by Civic Forum's spokesmen at a press conference, would 
require the Communists to forfeit much of their power. 
</P>
<P>
The new government, which will lead the country until free elections are held, 
probably in the early summer of next year, must include people who can gain the 
"respect and trust of our people and who could, at the same time, represent a 
guarantee that the present process of change . . . will never be interrupted by 
anybody or anything," Civic Forum declared in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Adamec, as his final act, proposed as his successor a longtime party 
functionary with an undistinguished record, Marian Calfa. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum said it could "work with" Calfa, but only if, as a "precondition," 
he agreed to name as No. 2 in the new government Jan Czarnogursky, a lawyer and 
prominent dissident with close ties to the Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
Czarnogursky, who hails from Slovakia, the poorer eastern portion of the 
country, was tried and convicted of sedition earlier this year for his 
opposition to the regime. He was only recently released from prison. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, at his press conference, said he personally would like to see 
Czarnogursky as the new prime minister, although he would be willing to go 
along with him as the No. 2 man. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Civic Forum said, its support for Calfa would be based on the 
understanding that Husak's successor as president would be a "non-party member 
who will have our support." Havel, asked about this at his press conference, 
said he would be willing to accept Czechoslovakia's presidency if offered, 
although he insisted he would prefer to return to his career in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, at least half the members of the new government would have to be 
experts not connected with any party and acceptable to Civic Forum under the 
formula being pushed by the opposition group and the two small parties -- 
former allies of the Communists -- that have now formed a de facto alliance 
with the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The Communists would have to share the remaining half of the government with 
those two smaller parties, the Socialists and the People's Party. 
</P>
<P>
And in a letter to Adamec released at the press conference, the opposition made 
clear it was not seeking mere token posts. Civic Forum proposed its chief 
spokesman as foreign minister, a leading strategist as minister for labor and 
social welfare and a prominent reform economist with close ties to the 
opposition as the finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
Further, as deputy prime minister in charge of the state police and security 
forces, Civic Forum proposed a prominent former Communist named Miroslav Kusy, 
a political scientist who was expelled from the party in the purge that 
followed the Soviet invasion of 1968. Kusy was later jailed for placing flowers 
on the grave of a Czechoslovak killed by Soviet troops during the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition dropped a demand that the Defense Ministry be put in the hands 
of a civilian, a move that would leave the army chain of command intact.

MANILA'S COUP OF ERRORS; 
</P>
<P>
THE PHILIPPINE REVOLT BEGAN WITH A MISTAKE AND UNFOLDED IN A SERIES OF 
ACCIDENTS. IT NEARLY SUCCEEDED IN TOPPLING THE GOVERNMENT ANYWAY.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The night was quiet in Tagaytay. On a mountaintop perch known as "the palace in 
the sky," tall microwave relay towers and radar, a critical military 
communications link to the south, silently scanned the nation's most strategic 
airspace. In the distance, far below, the lights of Manila twinkled. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly explosions rocked the air. The towers were down. It was 11:45 p.m., 
Wednesday, Nov. 29, and a military mutiny that nearly toppled President Corazon 
Aquino and plunged her government into its worst crisis had begun. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the rebellion was over in the capital Thursday, at least 83 people 
had died and 581 were wounded. The nation's economy reeled. Bomb disposal 
squads combed luxury condos for booby traps. Aquino had assumed sweeping powers 
to censor radio and TV, and take over public utilities. Her aides would not 
rule out another coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
It never should have unfolded as it did. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on Tagaytay gave Aquino's government 24 hours' warning of the coming 
coup. Capt. Jaime Junio, whose Scout Ranger commando team dynamited the 
complex, was captured and told all. And the government did almost nothing to 
prepare. 
</P>
<P>
In coordinated strikes, renegade commandos easily captured the army and marine 
headquarters, the air force headquarters, and two other key air bases. "They 
just walked in," armed forces spokesman Brig. Gen. Oscar Florendo conceded. 
</P>
<P>
But the rebels also erred in the revolt they code-named "7 Days and 7 Nights." 
Junio attacked a day too early. Mutineers could not air pre-recorded videotaped 
victory statements after a government TV executive sabotaged the transmitters. 
Rebel field officers lost touch in a radio frequency foul-up. And 
reinforcements never arrived when there were no pilots to fly the fighter 
planes they captured at a central Philippine air base. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the unlikely heroes were a former German stunt man and a Department 
of Tourism official in designer glasses who won the release of hundreds of 
foreigners trapped in an urban free-fire zone, while Aquino's government and 
the White House stood helplessly by. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth coup attempt against Aquino, and it was her worst nightmare. 
Every armed force and every political faction that had backed previous coups 
combined in a single effort, drawing with them young, reform-minded officers 
who had never before challenged the government. Now they joined to battle a 
government they charge is ineffective in solving the nation's problems, 
tolerant of corruption and lax in pressing the war against Communist 
insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
There are idealistic followers of renegade army Lt. Col. Gregorio (Gringo) 
Honasan, now a career coup plotter and a highly regarded military strategist. 
There were well-financed and heavily armed Marcos loyalists, followers of the 
late Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos and led by rebel Brig. Gen. Jose 
Zumel. And there were politicians. Even her own vice president, Salvador H. 
Laurel, called for her to resign while his deputy, Homobono Adaza, told 
reporters he wanted to be "spokesman for the junta and we can execute some 
people." 
</P>
<P>
And money was no problem. Mutinous troops lined up during lulls in the battle 
to collect $15 a day. Battalion commanders were paid $5,000, nearly a year's 
pay for most. One officer, captured south of the capital, carried $2,500 in 
"crisp, new bills," Florendo said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a harrowing week of death and destruction, of heroism and pain. At one 
point, pro-government Pvt. Robert Salvador fired his jeep-mounted 90-millimeter 
recoilless rifle at a rebel armored personnel carrier, toppling the vehicle and 
helping to stop a pre-dawn Sunday assault on armed forces headquarters at Camp 
Aguinaldo. 
</P>
<P>
"When I looked inside, I saw five persons. All dead. And one was my older 
brother, Roger," Salvador said in a flat voice. "If I didn't kill him, he might 
kill me or my companions. It hurts, but that's the way it is in war." 
</P>
<P>
Marines Came 
</P>
<P>
The battle began in earnest at 11 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 30, a full day after 
Junio's attack on the Tagaytay towers, an hour's drive south of Manila. A 
battalion of 750 marines suddenly appeared at the Villamor Air Base, in a south 
Manila suburb, home of the main Philippine air force aerial assault forces. 
</P>
<P>
"The airport police were not prepared for them and they took over in less than 
an hour," Florendo said. As mortars roared, Brig. Gen. Loven Abadia, commander 
of Villamor's main helicopter strike wing, looked up to see a .30-caliber 
machine gun aimed his way. He jumped from his first-floor window, sprinted 
across a field and climbed a fence to escape. 
</P>
<P>
A mile away, renegade army Scout Rangers occupied Ft. Bonifacio, headquarters 
for the army and marines, taking the entire army operations general staff 
hostage. Others captured Sangley Air Base, across Manila Bay, and its aging 
T-28 fighter-bombers and Sikorsky helicopters armed with rockets. Marines 
captured the government-run television Channel 4, the station that Aquino's 
military supporters used to bring her to power in the "people power" revolution 
of February, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since that revolt that a coup force had taken and held 
Channel 4. So confident were the rebels that one scrawled, "We'll miss you" on 
an office portrait of Aquino. But the station director, before he fled, had 
deliberately removed the "visual exciter," a five-watt crystal that permits 
transmission. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after daybreak Friday, rebel pilots took off in three T-28s, called 
"Tora Toras" here. Swooping low over the city, they strafed Aquino's complex at 
Malacanang Palace, shattering windows in the press room. One fired a rocket, 
hitting a coconut tree and the justice secretary's car. Government F-5 jets 
flew overhead but did not fire at the attacker. 
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina, a rebel ringleader, insisted that no one wanted to 
kill Aquino. "We just wanted to scare her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino was scared. Rebels controlled her top military bases. More important, 
they controlled the skies. And the head of military logistics at armed forces 
headquarters had gone over, taking huge stores of ammunition, trucks and fuel. 
</P>
<P>
A column of 500 rebel reinforcements was headed to Manila from northern Cagayan 
province. A ship had landed 400 rebels at Mactan Air Base, 350 miles south in 
Cebu province, capturing two fighter jets, six helicopter gunships and a C-130 
transport plane. Even though their pilots had fled, it effectively cut the 
country in half. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after noon Friday, Aquino spoke to U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt by 
phone and accepted President Bush's offer of help. 
</P>
<P>
It arrived 45 minutes later in the form of three U.S. Air Force F-4 Phantom 
fighter jets. They joined a squadron of Philippine F-5's and roared over the 
Sangley Air Base. While the Phantoms provided cover, the government jets 
destroyed eight planes on the ground. The F-4 cover was maintained until 6 a.m. 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Most agree that the air assault stopped the rebels cold. "The greatest crime is 
we had victory in our hands," Abenina said. A U.S. Embassy official did not 
disagree. "By 1 p.m. (Friday), they had the government." 
</P>
<P>
Hanging signs out front saying "Closed for Holiday," the embassy barred its 
gates and helicoptered in 100 heavily armed U.S. Marines, who took over the 
ballroom and set up positions in the neatly tended gardens. Two aircraft 
carriers, the Enterprise and Midway, were put on alert for possible evacuation 
of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Retaking the skies gave Aquino the upper hand. In sometimes-fierce fighting, 
government troops retook all the Manila-area bases except Ft. Bonifacio by 
Saturday night. The column from Cagayan was stopped. Fierce fighting raged in 
and around Camp Aguinaldo, nerve center of the Philippine armed forces and the 
civilian Department of Defense, but the camp held. 
</P>
<P>
If Aquino's pilots ruled the air, they didn't always use it well. One F-5 
strafed government troops behind Aguinaldo, killing six with friendly fire. A 
Sikorsky helicopter, firing at rebels from too high and too far away, instead 
rocketed a house in the ritzy White Plains subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
As their losses mounted, the rebels turned to a fallback plan. Apparently 
unnoticed, they had scouted the Makati business district and had begun storing 
caches of arms, ammunition and food. 
</P>
<P>
Makati is the showcase of Aquino's administration, a square mile of 
steel-and-glass office towers, $300,000 condominiums, and five-star hotels, 
surrounded by the most exclusive subdivisions in Manila. 
</P>
<P>
That night, the battle of Makati began. More than 400 renegade Scout Rangers 
and several members of a civilian gun club took sniper positions on rooftops 
and behind walls. For four long days, they trapped more than 2,000 foreigners 
and Filipinos as they fired bazookas, grenade launchers and machine guns 
against government troops. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino Ultimatum 
</P>
<P>
Aquino had already declared the coup crushed, and Sunday she issued an 
ultimatum to the mutinous troops: "Surrender or die," she warned. They fought 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
Bullets riddled the Japanese and British embassies. Rebel snipers in black 
berets fired from the same building as the Australian Embassy. Fires blazed 
inside The Atrium, a swanky nine-story shopping mall and office complex. Red 
Cross ambulances and a group of nuns came under fire. Red tracer bullets filled 
the sky over Forbes Park, home of top politicians, diplomats and businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
"Wednesday night at 6 p.m., it sounded like the Tet offensive," said Galen 
Radke, a former U.S. Embassy military attache who was trapped in the Olympic 
Tower. "The amount of ammunition expended in this area was fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the area's three international hotels and a dozen apartment towers, 
people cowered in fear. In the Tuscany tower, Peggy Matheson, a Norwegian 
Embassy employee, hid in the basement after shots blasted her bedroom window. 
</P>
<P>
"It went behind my maid and it ended in my bed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Blanco Central Apartments, Candy Lehmann, 33, stuffed a mattress against 
the shattered window and hid in the bathroom. For four days, she rationed her 
only food: a can of litchis and a can of tuna fish. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have a phone," she said later, still shaking from the ordeal. "I 
didn't have electricity. I didn't have radio or TV. I didn't have food. And 
there was bombing all around." 
</P>
<P>
In the Peninsula Hotel, staff closed the pool Saturday. Public rooms were shut 
Sunday. The bars closed Monday. At 6 a.m. Tuesday, with a firefight raging 
outside, the 620 guests were herded into a dining room without windows. They 
slept there that night, curling up on the carpet. 
</P>
<P>
"They fed us and gave us free beer the last couple of days," said Dr. Harry 
Richardson, a Canadian physician who had been at the Peninsula to speak at the 
Philippine Congress on Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. The conference was 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush telephoned Aquino to check on trapped Americans. Japanese, West 
German, British and other officials also called, putting tremendous pressure on 
the beleaguered Philippine president. "I've never gotten so many calls," she 
told aides. 
</P>
<P>
Relief came from an unlikely source. Acting on his own, Rafael Alunan, 
Philippine Department of Tourism undersecretary in charge of public assistance, 
broadcast an appeal for an evacuation of tourists and his phone number on radio 
stations DZRH and DZMM at midnight Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here to ensure the safety, comfort and convenience of tourists from the 
time they arrive to the time they leave," Alunan said, when asked to explain 
his role. "There were tourists trapped and it was our job to get them out." 
</P>
<P>
He repeated his radio appeal at 3 a.m., and again at 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Then someone called me probing," Alunan said. He called his friend and 
sky-diving instructor, Max Motchmann. The former German paratrooper and movie 
stunt man knew many of the rebel leaders from their parachute jumps together. 
Soon Motchmann got a call. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to rebel Lt. Col. Rafael Galvez by phone, Alunan and Motchmann arranged 
to send buses into Makati early Tuesday to evacuate the tourists. But the plan 
collapsed when heavy firing broke out. At 3:45 that afternoon, they tried 
another tack. 
</P>
<P>
Motchmann donned a seven-pound vest of body armor thick enough to stop machine 
gun bullets. Alunan shed his sport coat. Together with a national police 
colonel, they jogged nearly a mile through Makati's eerily deserted high-rise 
canyons, dashing for cover or dropping to the street as shots came their way. 
</P>
<P>
When they reached the rebel stronghold at the Inter-Continental Hotel, 
Motchmann offered packs of Hope and Marlboro cigarettes to Galvez and Maj. 
Abraham Puruggunan. As the fiercest fire fight yet blazed outside, they talked 
in the ballroom for nearly an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"No politics," said Motchmann. "Just sky-diving and how to get these people 
out." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was simple. A cease-fire began at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday, although 
one rebel was shot to death two hours later as he stood behind the Twin Towers 
condominiums. His barefoot body still lay on the steps six hours later. 
</P>
<P>
By 7 a.m., the first buses filed slowly past the burned-out buses and 
shell-pocked fire engines that had barricaded fashionable Ayala Avenue. By the 
time Motchmann had checked each building that afternoon, only a few stragglers 
remained. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one Arab, but the maid was afraid to wake him up," Motchmann said. 
"Others were born again. They said they weren't afraid." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't matter. Government negotiators had stepped in. By midnight, the 
rebels had agreed to return to barracks. And shortly after dawn Thursday, they 
did, 418 renegade troops marching four-abreast in formation, singing and 
carrying their weapons along Ayala Avenue behind a waving Philippine flag. 
</P>
<P>
Many Questions 
</P>
<P>
For now, there are more questions than answers. The rebels are under guard at 
Ft. Bonifacio and no one says how or if they will be punished. President Aquino 
must try to repair her credibility at home and abroad. Her military is deeply 
divided. The economy faces a flight of foreign investment. And with up to half 
of the original rebels and most of their leaders still at large, another coup 
threatens. 
</P>
<P>
But the week of war in the Philippines had an especially bitter price for Pvt. 
Salvador, the 25-year-old government soldier who shot his own brother. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't do anything," he said, sitting on his mother's couch beside a 
twinkling Christmas tree. "He turned left. I turned right. I did my job. I had 
no idea my brother was inside (the vehicle)."

GILLESPIE CHARGES FIRMS CONSPIRE TO THWART PROP. 103; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: THE COMMISSIONER FILES SUIT IN HER STRONGEST LEGAL ATTACK YET ON THE 
INDUSTRY. SHE SEEKS AN INJUNCTION TO HALT THE ALLEGED PRACTICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie has filed a lawsuit accusing 
California's insurance industry of "engaging in a conspiracy . . . seeking to 
block, hinder or delay the implementation of Proposition 103" and asking a Los 
Angeles judge to issue an injunction halting such tactics. 
</P>
<P>
The suit -- a cross-complaint in a case where the Farmers group of companies is 
trying to raise its auto insurance rates despite Gillespie's six-month freeze 
on increases -- also accuses Farmers and 2,000 unnamed insurance companies, 
industry trade associations and various company officers and employees of 
antitrust and other violations of the insurance initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"The commissioner believes there is a concerted effort on the part of insurers 
to delay and hinder the administrative process in the hope that the entire 
process will collapse and that the insurers can obtain benefits from the 
resulting chaos," Gillespie's attorney, Karl Rubinstein, asserts in the 
complaint released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"In particular, insurers have been and are still making rate increase filings 
with the intent to finesse these increases into place by overwhelming the 
Insurance Department's ability to administer the process and to drown the 
Insurance Department in paper and administrative procedures," the complaint 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
It further asserts that "insurance carriers, insurance trade associations and 
individuals acting in concert with them (are seeking) to utilize Proposition 
103 as yet another springboard for rate hikes and increased consumer cost." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie also asked the court to issue a broad order upholding the emergency 
pricing regulations and rate increase ceiling she announced in San Francisco on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
An initial hearing on Gillespie's suit, her sharpest legal attack yet on the 
industry, is slated this afternoon before Superior Court Judge Miriam A. Vogel, 
but Vogel is expected to only call for briefs and make no immediate decision. 
</P>
<P>
In connection with the same hearing, Gillespie has filed legal motions asking 
that Vogel issue an injunction today specifically blocking Farmers from 
implementing a 5.9% rate increase the company has been seeking, but which Vogel 
has delayed. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's sweeping assertions in the new lawsuit, and particularly her 
characterization of so many insurers as engaged in a conspiracy, were brusquely 
rejected Thursday by Leonard Venger, attorney for Farmers. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't disagree more," Venger said. "Any allegation of a conspiracy is 
nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
Venger said that throughout the long series of implementation hearings and 
other deliberations on Proposition 103, lawyers representing the various 
insurers have followed different strategies and often even pursued different 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
"The lawyers have taken great pains never to discuss their individual clients' 
operations among themselves," he said. "There is no grand insurer strategy. 
There is no such thing," 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Sacramento, a spokesman for the industry's largest state lobby, 
the Assn. of California Insurance Companies, declared, "It seems apparent that 
the commissioner is asking the courts to sanction insurers for participating in 
the process which she herself created." 
</P>
<P>
"Insurance companies have worked for the fair implementation of Proposition 
103, because they want a system that works both for them and consumers," 
spokesman George Tye said. 
</P>
<P>
"Commissioner Gillespie's job is to listen to all sides in this important 
debate and to deal with the many issues that are presented to her," he went on. 
"It's a tough, frustrating job, but it must be done. It's not proper for her to 
ask a court to wave a magic wand and to make her problems go away." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's complaint expressed frustration not only with the insurers but also 
with consumer groups. 
</P>
<P>
"The process of (Proposition 103) implementation has been hindered by the 
activities of various groups which seek to dictate various interpretations of 
the statute which are diametrically opposed to one another," the complaint 
said. It accused "various consumer groups" of advocating "rate reductions and 
rate plans in disregard of (the state Supreme Court decision on Proposition 
103) and the real limitations it places upon rate reductions." 
</P>
<P>
But the consumers were not named as defendants in the suit, and it seeks no 
action against them. 
</P>
<P>
In other insurance developments: 
</P>
<P>
* A Northern California state senator, Republican James W. Nielsen of Rohnert 
Park, said he will introduce a constitutional amendment in the Legislature to 
restore the right of auto insurers to base their rates on where customers live. 
This would undo some of the effects of Gillespie's regulations issued this 
week, but it would require a popular vote for it to go into effect. 
</P>
<P>
* California's leading auto insurance seller, State Farm, criticized the 
commissioner for ruling out the use of age, gender, academic achievement and 
marital status in the pricing of auto insurance, calling them "proven and well 
recognized indicators of driving habits which fairly and accurately determine 
appropriate prices." 
</P>
<P>
* Allstate, another major seller, said, "We find the commissioner's newly 
introduced guidelines extremely complex, and they will require a significant 
amount of additional study to understand and implement. . . . Until this 
evaluation has been completed, we cannot reach any specific conclusion (about 
them)." 
</P>
<P>
* Harvey Rosenfield, author of Proposition 103, and Walter Zelman, the former 
Common Cause director who is a Democratic candidate for insurance commissioner, 
criticized Gillespie's regulations. Rosenfield said he felt that "regulations 
don't have to be so impossible to decipher. In other states, insurance 
regulations are straightforward." Zelman said he thinks Gillespie's regulatory 
interpretation of Proposition 103's pricing stipulations are "a fraud" and is 
asking the state Office of Administrative Law to refuse to make them permanent.

COUPLE SUE NISSAN OVER CORPORATE 'MOLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last summer, Stephen and Maritza French rented a room in their Costa Mesa house 
to a quiet, bespectacled Japanese man. At the time, the Frenches say, they 
thought Takashi Morimoto was just another foreign visitor, a polite and curious 
young man learning the language and customs of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, the couple now contend, Morimoto was a corporate snoop. 
</P>
<P>
Unbeknown to the Frenches, the 29-year-old Nissan Motor Corp. employee was 
studying their every move as part of a research project for the Japanese car 
maker, the couple contend. They only discovered that Morimoto was some sort of 
automotive mole upon reading an article in The Times that detailed his curious 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
Irked that their lives had been under a corporate microscope, the French family 
filed a lawsuit Thursday against Morimoto and the car maker claiming fraud, 
invasion of privacy, trespassing and unfair business practices. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana, also seeks a 
court order forbidding Nissan from dispatching emissaries like Morimoto into 
the homes of other unsuspecting families, stating that the firm is "engaging in 
a pattern and practice of conducting market research by invading the privacy of 
American consumers." 
</P>
<P>
"They just feel outraged," said Nancy Kaufman, the Santa Ana attorney 
representing the Frenches. "They just wonder what he was writing down, what 
about their private lives is in a Nissan file somewhere. They feel violated, 
they really do." 
</P>
<P>
In a nine-page legal complaint, the family alleges that Morimoto "intentionally 
misrepresented and concealed" the reason for his six-week stay with the couple 
and their two daughters, 22-year-old Sherylinn and Danielle, 13. 
</P>
<P>
"Morimoto's true purpose in renting a room from (the French family) was to spy 
upon them and to record and use every perceivable aspect of their private lives 
for the commercial purposes of Nissan," the lawsuit contends. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Nissan Motor Corp. in Carson said he could not comment since 
the firm has not yet been served with the lawsuit, which also asks for 
unspecified monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, Japanese auto makers have made a practice of dispatching 
researchers to study American families to better understand the strengths, 
foibles, likes and dislikes of the U.S. car-buying public. Typically, the 
families are asked to voluntarily participate in the research. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also named Makoto Tachikawa, a product strategy director for 
Nissan, and two firms allegedly involved in placing Morimoto in the French 
household, Academic Recruit Communication International of Los Angeles and the 
Japanese American Cultural Center. 
</P>
<P>
Chiey C. Nomura and Terry Terasaki, officials with the two organizations who 
were also named in the lawsuit, could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
Nomura was out of the country and Terasaki did not return a phone call from The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman said the episode unfolded after the French family responded in June to 
a newspaper advertisement that Nomura placed to find homes for Japanese 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen French, an accountant, contacted the placement service but was was told 
by Nomura and Terasaki that no student was available, according to the suit. 
Instead, the two men suggested that the family find a spot for Morimoto, who 
moved in June 16. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman said the family was aware that Morimoto worked for Nissan but thought 
he was engaged in some sort of temporary project at the firm's U.S. 
headquarters in Carson and wanted to stay with an American family simply "to 
improve his English and general knowledge of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Morimoto proved a hospitable guest during his stay and when his visit ended on 
July 31, Morimoto and the French family parted "as friends," Kaufman said. 
</P>
<P>
The family was shocked and outraged when they saw an Oct. 2 article in The 
Times on the car culture of Southern California that contained three paragraphs 
outlining Morimoto's stay with them over the summer, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
It said Nissan had dispatched Morimoto, an intern from the Tokyo headquarters, 
to the middle-class Costa Mesa neighborhood to "unearth" the life style of an 
American town as part of the effort to design a future car model targeted to 
U.S. consumers. Morimoto, the story said, was among several "operatives" who 
were lured to Southern California by the region's trend-setting image.

NEW ANTIBODY TECHNIQUE EXPANDS THERAPEUTIC USES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Researchers at the Scripps Clinic in San Diego have developed a powerful new 
technique that will allow scientists to identify and isolate specialized 
antibodies, especially human antibodies, for medical and other uses far more 
quickly and inexpensively than was previously possible. 
</P>
<P>
The advance in producing so-called monoclonal antibodies holds potentially 
important implications for use in medical therapy, particularly for treating 
cancer, transplant rejection and autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes, 
multiple sclerosis and arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
Combined with technology recently developed at Scripps for mass-producing 
monoclonal antibodies in plants, the new development reported today in Science 
magazine places Scripps at the forefront in developing a new technology that 
rivals genetic engineering in its potential scientific and financial 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
Monoclonal antibodies are already widely used in medical treatment and 
diagnostics. 
</P>
<P>
But therapeutic uses have so far been limited by allergic reactions to the 
antibodies, which were previously produced only in animal cells. By making it 
possible to produce purely human antibodies, the new technology should greatly 
expand their use. 
</P>
<P>
"This technology is very interesting, very exciting and potentially very 
useful," said immunologist Jeffrey Schlom of the National Cancer Institute. 
According to Schlom, the technology could reduce the time required for 
producing a new therapeutic antibody from the current 18 months to only a few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Schlom noted that the Cancer Institute will begin testing the new technology as 
soon as possible "to see if we can use it to accelerate the kinds of things we 
are doing." 
</P>
<P>
The technology has so many potential applications, in fact, that La Jolla-based 
Stratagene Inc., which cooperated with Scripps scientists in developing the new 
technology, is establishing a new company to explore uses. 
</P>
<P>
Stratagene has already employed the technology to develop monoclonal antibodies 
that can be used in research laboratories for isolating and purifying proteins 
and other biological molecules, according to Stratagene's chief executive 
officer, Joseph A. Sorge. And the new company, called Stratacyte Corp., will be 
aggressively developing potential therapeutic antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the company will be licensing the technology to others on a broad 
basis, Sorge added. "We couldn't touch 5% of the applications on our own," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Financial analysts are predicting that sales of monoclonal antibodies will grow 
tenfold to $3.5 billion per year by 1995. The new Scripps technologies could 
make that market higher still, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Antibodies are complex proteins produced by white blood cells that target 
invading microorganisms and foreign chemicals for destruction by the immune 
system. Their key property is that a given antibody will bind to only one 
invading chemical or cell, ignoring all others. 
</P>
<P>
The medical use of antibodies was revolutionized in 1975 by the discovery of 
techniques for producing large quantities of a single antibody. British 
researchers injected mice with a specific chemical or cell (called an antigen) 
and then isolated single, short-lived white blood cells that produced an 
antibody against that antigen and fused them with long-lived cancer cells. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting cells, called hybridomas, inherit immortality -- but not the 
ability to produce disease -- from the cancer cell, as well as the white blood 
cell's ability to produce one antibody. Their progeny continue to produce the 
same antibody, called a monoclonal antibody because it is derived from a 
single, cloned cell. 
</P>
<P>
Monoclonal antibodies are widely used in physicians' offices, in hospitals and 
even in home test kits for measuring minute quantities of such biological 
materials as drugs, hormones and vitamins. They are also used to carry toxins 
and radioactive atoms directly to tumor cells in the body so that healthy cells 
will not be injured. 
</P>
<P>
But the process of preparing hybridomas and selecting the antibodies desired 
for a particular application is a time-consuming, labor-intensive process. In 
producing diagnostics, for example, "the real costs are in the manpower for the 
screening and selection process," according to Sidney Aroesty, president of Los 
Angeles-based Diagnostic Products Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The new technology should greatly reduce both the time and the cost of 
developing new antibodies, according to molecular biologist William D. Huse, 
who headed the Scripps team. They achieved these reductions by duplicating in 
bacteria the process by which antibody diversity occurs in humans and other 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
Huse and his colleagues developed a way to insert two antibody genes into 
special viruses, called phage, that infect and kill bacteria. As the phage 
replicate, the antibody genes undergo mutations similar to those that occur in 
white blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
Within a few days, the researchers have an antibody repertoire containing the 
genes for billions of distinct antibody molecules. Using a simple screening 
process they developed, the Scripps researchers can then quickly sift through 
all of these to find one or more antibodies that bind to a desired antigen. 
</P>
<P>
The new technique could have its greatest potential for making human 
antibodies. Clearly, it is not ethical to inject humans with an antigen, such 
as a cancer cell, to stimulate formation of appropriate white blood cells. 
Furthermore, human white cells are extremely difficult to fuse with cancer 
cells to make hybridomas. 
</P>
<P>
By eliminating both of these steps, the Scripps researchers say their technique 
could make the manufacture of human monoclonal antibodies routine.

'DINOBUSTERS' USE HIGH-TECH TO FIND GIANT CRITTER'S BONES

New technology that should move the tedious search for dinosaur skeletons 
beyond the age of the pick and shovel is helping scientists recover the longest 
dinosaur ever discovered. 
</P>
<P>
By using sonic images of the sandstone beneath a site in New Mexico, scientists 
were able to detect the dark shadows of bones of "seismosaurus" -- so named 
because it was so big that when it walked the ground must have trembled. 
Results of the project were presented here Thursday during the fall meeting of 
the American Geophysical Union. 
</P>
<P>
The early digging consisted of hit-or-miss, time-consuming excavations, but 
today about 50 workers know precisely where to dig because of a technology 
developed by the federal Department of Energy to help locate acceptable burial 
sites for waste disposal. Much of the skeleton has already been excavated but 
it will take about two years to finish the project. 
</P>
<P>
The process is similar to computer tomography, which uses X-rays to produce 
images of tissues and bones inside humans, except in this case sound waves are 
used instead. 
</P>
<P>
"We call ourselves the 'dinobusters,' " said geophysicist Alan Witten of Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory. Mimicking the theme from the movie Ghostbusters, he 
added: "Something big in your neighborhood? Who ya gonna call?" 
</P>
<P>
"Seismosaurus" is one of the largest critters ever found, measuring 110 feet in 
length, according to Peggy Bechtel of the Southwest Paleontology Foundation 
Inc., Albuquerque, coordinator of the excavation. 
</P>
<P>
The strange beast, which is mostly tail and neck extending from a 
disproportionately small body, was buried almost intact along a river bank 
northwest of Albuquerque about 150 million years ago. The exact location is in 
a federal wilderness area, and it has not been revealed in an effort to 
discourage uninvited guests who might vandalize the site. 
</P>
<P>
Most dinosaur skeletons are spread over huge areas by erosion and predators, 
but sonic images of "seismosaurus" reveal that it was buried in a fetal 
position that it probably assumed at the time of death. 
</P>
<P>
One reason the bones were not carried off by other animals lies in their great 
size. One chunk from the animal's vertebra weighs about 3,300 pounds, which was 
more than the entire weight of the largest other animal known to inhabit that 
region at that time, said Wilson Bechtel, who is helping to coordinate the 
excavation. 
</P>
<P>
Once the great beast is fully unearthed, it will be reassembled at the New 
Mexico Museum of Natural History in Albuquerque and put on public display. 
</P>
<P>
Shotgun on Wheels 
</P>
<P>
The excavation has been accelerated considerably by the technique developed by 
Oak Ridge's Witten and Jozef Sypniewski of Wayne State University. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the process is an 8-gauge shotgun on wheels, which Witten called a 
"cannon." 
</P>
<P>
"It fires a slug of soft metal into the ground," Witten said. "It hits the 
ground and flattens," sending out sound waves. 
</P>
<P>
An array of 29 microphones lowered down a well on the other side of the site 
picks up the sound waves, which are affected by the different materials they 
pass through. The cannon is then moved two feet away and the process repeated. 
</P>
<P>
By plotting the time at which the sound waves are received, Witten is able to 
show precisely where the bones are hidden beneath the eight-foot-deep layer of 
sandstone that has built up over the last 150 million years. 
</P>
<P>
The system works, he said, because sound waves travel 12,000 feet per second 
through the bones, but only 1,500 feet per second through the surrounding 
sandstone. The difference in arrival time casts a "sound shadow" that can be 
used to create an image of the skeleton. 
</P>
<P>
"This animal has been unique," Witten said, "because usually only one or two 
bones are found, but here we have one bone after another." 
</P>
<P>
The images tell workers precisely where the bones are located, including some 
that broke away from the main skeleton and either slid down a sand dune or were 
washed a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
The technology was developed by the Energy Department to help find sites that 
are suitable for waste disposal and to find past sites that may harbor 
hazardous materials. It cost about half a million dollars to develop the 
technology, Witten said, but paleontologists should be able to build their own 
systems for about $20,000, he said.

The Chinese capital has launched its first large-scale police recruiting drive, 
saying security forces must be expanded to meet "increased demand for 
maintaining public order" during the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing, an official 
newspaper said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
China Daily quoted an official as saying that Beijing's police hope to find 
4,000 recruits. The newspaper said the main reason for the drive is to ensure 
security during the Asian Games, which many residents believe could become a 
focus for renewed anti-government unrest.

BOMBINGS COULD STALL U.S. EFFORTS IN COLOMBIA; 
</P>
<P>
DRUG WAR: OFFICIALS CONCEDE THAT MILITARY ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN OF LITTLE HELP TO 
THE BOGOTA GOVERNMENT. ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION: IMPROVED INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING.

<P>
U.S. anti-drug officials fear that two devastating bombings in Colombia 
represent the onset of a major escalation by cocaine traffickers and could 
seriously complicate the Administration's efforts to help the Colombian 
government win its drug war. 
</P>
<P>
The traffickers are believed to be responsible for explosions aboard an Avianca 
airlines flight and in a Bogota street that together claimed more than 150 
lives, the first time large numbers of innocent civilians have been targeted 
since an "all-out war" against authorities was declared by the cocaine cartels 
four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
While defending U.S. efforts to aid Colombia so far, the anti-drug officials 
conceded that the largely military assistance that has been dispatched to date 
has done little to help the government fend off what increasingly appears to be 
a sustained and bloody terrorist offensive. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, participants in Administration strategy meetings are now 
focusing on proposals to improve intelligence-gathering and to provide more 
protection for particularly vulnerable Colombian targets, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States must "intensify our efforts to provide them with the best 
intelligence we can, not only the whereabouts of the traffickers but also their 
terrorist intentions," Terrence M. Burke, deputy administrator of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Michael M. Skol, deputy assistant secretary of state for South America, said 
that the mayhem will not "shock us into doing more for Colombia," but "it 
confirms that we must do as much as we can." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration officials contended that the new terrorist attacks are an 
indication that the U.S.-backed crackdown in Colombia is driving cartel leaders 
to desperation. "This may make it harder for us," one official said, "but it's 
a sign that we're winning." 
</P>
<P>
Other officials, however, described the new terrorist campaign as a far more 
significant threat. While not likely to put American citizens at risk, it could 
undermine U.S. strategy by causing Colombians to back away from the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
"These people have enough resources to keep up the bombings and terrorism," one 
official said. "And now it appears they really don't care who they kill in 
their efforts to attack a particular target." 
</P>
<P>
Such efforts appear unlikely to be thwarted by any new barriers erected by the 
United States, despite the highly publicized dispatch of $65 million in 
emergency assistance to Colombia last August after the traffickers announced 
their anti-government campaign, the U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The assistance package -- which by law was drawn entirely from U.S. military 
stores -- was composed largely of helicopters and attack jet planes. Other aid 
provided by the State Department under a $5-million judicial assistance package 
has gone largely toward the training of bodyguards and the manufacture of 
armored cars. 
</P>
<P>
The tools have been judged useful in Colombian assaults against traffickers' 
headquarters and in protecting Colombian judges from assassination attempts. 
But the officials acknowledged that the new terrorist offensive raises 
questions about the narrowness of the U.S. response to date. 
</P>
<P>
"The narco-terrorists are not mounting battalion-style attacks on police 
stations," one U.S. official said. "As we saw in Bogota, they're blowing the 
hell out of them -- and everything else for blocks -- with terrorist bombs. 
They certainly couldn't have been stopped by an A-37 circling overhead." 
</P>
<P>
Additional anti-drug assistance has been promised as part of the 
Administration's new Andean strategy, which provides $261 million for Colombia, 
Peru and Bolivia this year. It is expected to be made up largely of military 
aid, but officials said Thursday that there had been some discussion of 
shifting more toward law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Among steps described by one U.S. official as of potential value would be 
training Colombian police in anti-terrorist techniques and helping design and 
erect barriers around vulnerable targets. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their expressions of concern about the U.S. effort, the anti-drug 
officials said that they are certain the political imperative of a victory in 
the war on drugs means that the United States will not back away from the 
Colombian crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, they noted that the fate of the highly touted Andean strategy is 
largely dependent on success in Colombia, where the prospects for progress in 
the anti-drug effort are believed far better than in Peru and Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
"All I hear from the highest levels of the Administration," one senior official 
said Thursday, "is: 'Colombia must succeed. They cannot fail.' "

DIPLOMACY: THE UPHEAVAL HAS BROUGHT A BUREAUCRATIC BACKWATER INTO THE

Their once-measured pace of work has accelerated to a nonstop, 12-hour-a-day 
clip. The White House, which earlier seemed unaware of their existence, now 
calls several times a day. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the suddenly hectic life in the U.S. government offices watching 
events in Eastern Europe -- a longtime bureaucratic backwater that now finds 
itself in the eye of history. 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, the staff expert on Czechoslovakian affairs is 
suddenly in demand to talk to members of Congress, reporters and private 
citizens. At the Commerce Department, the desk officer for Hungary responds to 
30 or more telephone calls a day from American businessmen hoping to make their 
fortune in the capitalistic renaissance sweeping Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In the State Department's Eastern European office, harried diplomats amuse 
themselves with office pools on when the next Communist regime will fall. 
</P>
<P>
"The pace of change has been remarkable," said Curtis J. Kamman, the State 
Department's top Eastern European expert. "The work load, the flow of paper and 
everything else is much heavier, and we have very little additional help. Our 
staffing in the department doesn't expand easily." 
</P>
<P>
The department regularly assigns several specialists to desks that monitor 
nations where diplomatic activity is extensive and the United States carefully 
tends policy interests -- nations like Japan. But in Eastern Europe, it is only 
one officer per country. So far, the staff has been able to cope by working 
much longer hours, buoyed by the rush of adrenalin that comes from being in the 
middle of something big. 
</P>
<P>
"The direction of events is positive," Kamman said. "It is easier to react to 
positive events than when the situation is deteriorating." 
</P>
<P>
Kamman's deputy, James Hooper, said: "The thing you are doing (now) is not the 
usual bureaucratic crap. You can see the connection between what you are doing 
and a larger purpose." 
</P>
<P>
For years, the State Department and Commerce Department desks that follow 
events in the Communist-ruled nations of Eastern Europe were overshadowed by 
the more glamorous offices watching the Soviet Union -- much in the same way as 
Moscow dominated its satellites. It was a static job that appealed mostly to 
people with a strong academic or personal interest in a region where 1,000 
years of history seemed to be submerged in a bog of stagnation. The Bible of 
the government bureaucrat -- a detailed job description known as the "work 
requirement statement" -- seemed to go for years without significant revision. 
</P>
<P>
No longer. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are changing so fast that the work requirement statements are going 
straight from the typewriter to the shredder," Hooper said. "You go out of the 
office for lunch and when you get back another government has fallen." 
</P>
<P>
Hooper's job always has required him to meet frequently with diplomats from 
East European countries. That hasn't changed, but the East European diplomats 
have. 
</P>
<P>
"They have real smiles on their faces," Hooper said. "They are more inclined to 
use our first names instead of the stilted formality they used to use. One of 
the bloc ambassadors is returning to sender any letter addressed 'Dear 
Comrade.' " 
</P>
<P>
At the Commerce Department, officials are swamped with requests for information 
on how to do business in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to get eight to 10 calls a day; now it is 30 to 40, and if there is 
something in the newspaper about Hungary, we can get 60 or 70 calls that day," 
said Russell Johnson, the Commerce desk officer for that nation. "Some people 
come to us with basically no knowledge whatsoever. With some you have to start 
out right from the beginning and explain that these are non-market economies 
with non-convertible currencies. 
</P>
<P>
"The calls run the gamut from people who are knitting lace doilies on the side 
and want to sell them to Hungary to Fortune 500 companies that want to set up 
joint ventures," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Often, he said, his job consists of trying to dissuade naive capitalists from 
plunging into the turbulent Eastern Europe market. 
</P>
<P>
"It is true that smaller companies find it more difficult to work in these 
countries, and we try to be up front about it," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, some career diplomats have been grumbling that 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and his close circle of advisers run 
foreign policy by themselves, without the help of the department's 
professionals. But the Eastern Europe specialists have no such complaints. 
</P>
<P>
When the pace of events caught the attention of the upper levels of the State 
Department and the White House, the Eastern European specialists found that 
they, almost alone in the government, knew the names, places and issues that 
were shaping a revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can concentrate on everything at once," said Cameron Munter, the State 
Department's desk officer for Czechoslovakia. "Both the Seventh Floor (the 
State Department's top officials) and the White House have had a number of 
other things to look at. Now that they are confronted with a situation that we 
know about, we find that what we know is in more demand." 
</P>
<P>
In theory, the State Department's country desks collect and analyze the most 
accurate factual information they can obtain. It is up to higher-ranking 
officials to put the political spin on the facts. Sometimes, when conditions do 
not change very much from day to day, the desks have little to do. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are a lot of chiefs in the State Department, we are the Indians," 
Munter said. "We are supposed to create the raw product that can be shaped at 
higher levels into policy." 
</P>
<P>
These days, Munter and his colleagues on other Eastern European desks arrive at 
the department no later than 8 a.m. each day. Their first priority is to 
prepare the press statements that will be issued by department spokesman 
Margaret Tutwiler or her aides. The statements are supposed to represent the 
U.S. government's up-to-the-minute policy concerning global issues. With 
reporters' questions about East European developments now numerous, and the 
issues in question quite sensitive, drafting the appropriate pronouncements and 
getting the necessary high-level clearances often takes hours. 
</P>
<P>
And by the time 10 a.m. arrives in Washington, it is 4 p.m. in Prague, almost 
the end of another day that, more likely than not, produced political events 
that would have been unthinkable six months ago. Already, the "in" basket on 
Munter's desk is piled high with new cables from the embassy in Prague and 
other messages. 
</P>
<P>
He said he starts to go through the messages, but the routine is frequently 
interrupted by calls from senior State Department officials or from the White 
House for background papers needed for urgent meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Some desk officers stay at their posts until 9 p.m. many days to catch up with 
the cable traffic. Others take the messages home to read there.

"It is very rare that I have time to think about what it all means," Munter 
said. "That is a potential hazard."

Admitting responsibility for "the deepest crisis in East German history," the 
Communist Party met with opposition groups for the first time Thursday and 
agreed on proposals to rewrite the constitution and hold free elections by May 
6. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 pro-democracy demonstrators gathered outside the "round-table 
meeting" in an East Berlin church residence, and the government renewed appeals 
for public calm. 
</P>
<P>
"In a state of chaos and anarchy, we could not continue the process for 
democratic renewal," said government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer said he does not think East Germany is moving toward anarchy, "but there 
are signs some groups are trying it." 
</P>
<P>
The round-table session came on the eve of the most critical congress in the 
party's 40-year history of rule here. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency session called for today will attempt to salvage the party from 
the ruins of a corruption scandal that forced out long-time leader Erich 
Honecker, the Politburo and the Central Committee. Honecker remains under house 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
In outlining its platform Thursday, the party called for "a radical breach" 
from its Stalinist framework. 
</P>
<P>
Although the prime minister and 16 of 27 Cabinet members are Communist, the 
government has made concerted efforts to divorce itself from the party amid 
public cries for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hans Modrow appealed on state television for calm Thursday as 
did the head of the secret police. 
</P>
<P>
The government in recent days has issued numerous warnings coupled with vague 
reports of citizen unrest and violence, but few cases could be documented by 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Wolfgang Schwanitz, head of national security, told a press conference 
Thursday that secret police headquarters in at least a dozen cities had been 
ransacked by angry mobs. 
</P>
<P>
The citizens purportedly occupied the buildings to prevent destruction of any 
files or documents that might link Communist officials to illegal activity. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Schwanitz's dramatic accounts of ransacking and the "life-threatening 
danger" his employees now face proved to be totally unfounded in one of the 
headquarters that was supposedly among the worst hit. 
</P>
<P>
Schwanitz claimed that the headquarters in Cottbus, Dresden, Suhl and Rostock 
were paralyzed by vigilantes. 
</P>
<P>
"Employees and their families fear they're in the utmost danger for their 
lives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pressed for details, Schwanitz said there were "many many injuries," but none 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
He said that some apartments in the compounds were "practically turned on end" 
and that windows were shattered. 
</P>
<P>
But in Cottbus, a coal town of 115,000 near the Polish border, state security 
headquarters were perfectly calm Thursday night and a Times reporter permitted 
inside found no signs of any ransacking. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy director, Eberhard Bender, said his chief's report was "a 
misunderstanding," and that there was "never even any attempt to occupy these 
buildings. Not so much as a single stone was thrown." 
</P>
<P>
Bender said members of the opposition group New Forum came by with local police 
Wednesday morning to check out a tip that documents were being burned inside. 
</P>
<P>
The state prosecutor sealed the office archives and steps were taken to prevent 
erasure of computer files, Bender said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has been destroyed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bender said that citizens were upset by Schwanitz's false report and that the 
Cottbus headquarters had informed Schwanitz that they were not besieged. 
</P>
<P>
Bender said he contacted Schwanitz again Thursday night by telephone when three 
Western reporters arrived. 
</P>
<P>
He said, "The general asked that it be conveyed that his staff made a mistake" 
in naming Cottbus as one of the besieged headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
He did not retract the accusations of public violence in the other three 
cities, however. East German media carried no independent reports Thursday of 
any such attacks. 
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Schwanitz warned that vigilante raids on his 
facilities could "lead to unforeseen consequences." 
</P>
<P>
That followed a thinly veiled warning the previous day by the government, which 
mysteriously cautioned against any "encroachments" on army installations and 
reminded citizens that the soldiers are "armed and trained" to counter any 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's pro-democracy movement has been fast-moving but peaceful, 
although Honecker reportedly favored "the Chinese solution" in Leipzig last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic reforms already are having considerable impact on the national 
security forces, or secret police, whose very jobs demanded unquestioning 
loyalty to the corrupt Communist leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Schwanitz urged the public not to hold secret police responsible for "carrying 
out the incorrect security policy of the former government." 
</P>
<P>
He said the national security forces would be reduced by "up to 50%" but 
refused for security reasons to say how many people that would involve. 
</P>
<P>
Those laid off will either be retired, retrained or placed in new jobs "in the 
mines or in transportation or other sector to help serve the economy," 
Schwanitz said. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's labor force suffered a crippling blow when borders were opened a 
month ago and about 300,000 East Germans emigrated to West Germany.

ANGRY CANADIANS DEMAND STRICTER GUN LAWS

Canada, blessed with a low crime rate and strict gun laws, recoiled in horror 
Thursday at the Montreal massacre, a killing spree of the type many Canadians 
smugly believed only happen south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
But reaction to the killing of 14 female students by a crazed gunman at the 
University of Montreal on Wednesday -- the worst mass murder in Canadian 
history -- turned rapidly from shock to outright anger. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a human tragedy of enormous proportion and a grim reminder of the 
vulnerability of society and of the fragility of life itself," Prime Minister 
Brian Mulroney said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Flags flew at half-staff in the Canadian capital and across Quebec province as 
demands grew for even stricter guns laws and greater protection in general 
against crazed individuals. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not used to this kind of thing in Canada," said Gary Rosenfeldt, 
president of the lobby group, Victims of Violence Society. "I think probably 
it's a sign of the times." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfeldt, echoing concerns of other social groups, said that while Canadian 
gun laws are strict, more could be done to keep mentally ill people off the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
There were also questions of how the gunman could have obtained his 
.223-caliber Sturm Ruger semiautomatic rifle, a kind of weapon that is supposed 
to be strictly controlled in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you justify selling an assault weapon in a downtown store?" one irate 
woman asked on a Montreal radio talk show flooded with calls. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman, dressed as a hunter, went on a shooting rampage on three floors of 
the University of Montreal, killing 14 women and wounding 13. 
</P>
<P>
The French-speaking man, in a rage against feminists he blamed for ruining his 
life, later committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Although there have been other mass shootings -- the most recent when a man 
with a machine gun killed three in the Quebec Legislature in 1984 -- Canadians 
take pride in the country's low crime rate.

MASS KILLER NAMED BY MONTREAL POLICE 
</P>

A gunman who killed 14 women, wounded 13 other people and killed himself here 
Wednesday evening was identified Thursday night as Marc Lapin. He had used the 
name "Marc" to sign a three-page suicide letter that police retrieved from his 
pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian Broadcasting Corp., which reported that police had confirmed his 
identity through his mother, said little was known about the gunman's 
background. The broadcaster described him as being about 5-foot-9 inches tall 
and weighing about 160 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, "Marc" said that he was going to have to die on Dec. 6, then 
blamed his problems on "feminists who had always ruined his life," according to 
Jacques Duchesneau, head of the Montreal police organized crimes unit. The 
letter, which has not yet been released in full, also included a list of women 
in Montreal. Police declined to reveal their names or speculate on why they 
were mentioned in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the lone gunman walked into the Ecole Polytechnique of the 
University of Montreal and went on what witnesses described as an anti-feminist 
rampage. He fired shots into the ceiling and at students, then burst into a 
classroom during an oral presentation and ordered the male students and teacher 
out the door. One student said he heard the gunman say, "I want women." 
</P>
<P>
According to survivors, the man then shouted an obscenity and called the women 
"feminists" in French, and opened fire on them, killing six. He then left the 
classroom and roamed the corridors, pausing to fire and reload as he went. 
Eight women were fatally shot elsewhere in the building. One policeman arriving 
at the scene discovered his own daughter among the dead. 
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday, one of the injured was still in critical condition, and the 
other 12 were said to be "stable." It was the worst mass killing ever in Canada 
-- a country that tends to look upon senseless, violent crime as an American 
phenomenon -- and the third worst in North America. 
</P>
<P>
Duchesneau said the man's suicide note claimed he had "political reasons" for 
committing the massacre but didn't explain what these were. The officer said 
the letter further complained of a life of unhappiness, and especially the 
unhappiness of the man's final seven years. "Marc" also wrote that he had tried 
to enter the armed forces and been rejected as "anti-social," Duchesneau said. 
Police said the killer, thought to be between 22 and 25 years old, didn't 
address the handwritten note to anyone in particular. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, police said, the letter referred to Cpl. Denis Lortie, a 
well-known mass-killer who worked as a supply clerk at a Canadian Forces base 
until 1984, then stole two sub-machine guns and a pistol and went on a shooting 
spree in the Quebec National Assembly in Quebec City, killing three government 
employees and wounding 13 other people. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they were able to get a line on the gunman's identify by tracing 
the purchase and registration of the weapon he used -- a .223-caliber Sturm 
Ruger semi-automatic rifle, a gun commonly used in hunting. They said that they 
had learned where the gun was purchased and that it appeared to have been 
registered properly. 
</P>
<P>
On the university campus Thursday, students seemed stunned by what had 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
"We were doing our oral presentation," said engineering student Roger 
Thiffauld, who was in the room where the gunman killed four women and shot 
himself. "The girl in my team had just finished her presentation, and I did 
mine. Just when we were switching transparencies, the guy came in." 
</P>
<P>
Thiffauld said he didn't hear the gunman make any anti-woman remarks, but as 
all the students dove to the floor, he said he could hear him walking about the 
room on the tops of the desks, picking out students here and there. At the 
time, he said, he didn't realize it, but the killer was finding the women where 
they lay and shooting them. He said that during the ordeal, the woman next to 
him on the floor, just two or three feet away, was shot. She lay moaning and 
eventually bled to death, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was serious," Thiffauld said of the man. "He wasn't excited, or anything 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
Another engineering student, Mario Cantin, said he couldn't understand why the 
man had singled out the women in the building. "The guys at Polytechnique are 
quite happy that the number of women is increasing every year," he said, as he 
bundled up for a candlelight vigil held for the dead in the bitter night air. 
"I don't think they feel the women are stealing our jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, speaking in Ottawa, expressed his shock at the 
mass murders and sent his condolences to the families. Here in Quebec, Premier 
Robert Bourassa told the legislature Thursday: "All of Quebec is in mourning."

ISRAEL ACCEPTS U.S. CALL FOR THREE-WAY PEACE TALKS

On the eve of the Palestinian uprising's second anniversary, Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Shamir accepted a U.S. call for talks by Egyptian, American and Israeli 
officials as a step toward peace, a spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir called a meeting today of the four top Cabinet ministers to approve 
sending Foreign Minister Moshe Arens to the talks, Israel TV reported. 
</P>
<P>
The "forum of four" includes Shamir and Arens of the right-wing Likud Party and 
two left-leaning Labor Party members, Finance Minister Shimon Peres and Defense 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
The moves came as the Israeli army clamped an indefinite curfew on 750,000 
Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip to block protests linked to today's 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, Shamir spokesman Yossi Ahimeir gave the prime minister's response 
to the proposed meeting in Washington after U.S. officials announced that Egypt 
had agreed to the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Americans believe it is a full response and want to see where we go 
from here, we'll go in January to the meeting of the three foreign ministers," 
Ahimeir said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III urged the three-way meeting to pave 
the way for Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo on Israel's initiative for 
elections in the West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
Ahimeir said that Israel still had not seen the full text of Egypt's reply and 
hoped that the Washington meeting could answer questions about Cairo's stance. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be important to determine what Egypt's intentions are, and the ability 
to advance the peace initiative as Israel has proposed, to hold elections," he 
said.

INQUIRY URGED ON CHEMICALS USED BY TRAFFICKERS

A senator Thursday called on the Bush Administration to investigate whether 
chemicals exported by U.S. manufacturers are being used by drug traffickers in 
Latin America as an ingredient to produce cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said in a letter to Drug Control Policy Director 
William J. Bennett that his concern was prompted by a Dec. 5 report in The 
Times that the vast majority of the chemicals used in cocaine production 
originate in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"If these reports are true, major American companies are making a buck off of 
the drug epidemic," Reid wrote to Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
"As drug czar, you must investigate this abhorrent possibility," he said. "You 
must also take immediate action to stop this murderous and unlawful activity if 
these reports are . . .true." 
</P>
<P>
The senator raised particular questions about the role played by the Exxon 
Corp., a principal exporter to Colombia of a solvent known as methyl ethyl 
ketone. The Times reported that 90% of the MEK imported by Colombia is believed 
to be diverted for cocaine production. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett was traveling with President Bush on Thursday and had not yet seen the 
letter, his spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-drug strategy that Bennett drafted this year calls for stringent 
controls on the export of MEK, acetone and other "essential chemicals."

A senior State Department official said that Nicaragua's government has

political activists and voters before February's national elections. John 
Bolton, assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs, 
said the political opposition has grown to represent a real threat to continued 
Sandinista power in Nicaragua, and the leftist government has responded with 
"tactics designed to discredit, confuse and intimidate the opposition and its

India's new prime minister made a dramatic peace overture in the strife-torn 
northern state of Punjab, praying in the holiest Sikh shrine and expressing 
regret for years of bloodshed. The streets of the Sikh holy city of Amritsar 
were clogged as tens of thousands of people welcomed Vishwanath Pratap Singh, 
who rode in an open jeep, stopping to shake hands and hug people. Thousands of 
people have been killed since Sikh militants began a ruthless campaign for an 
independent homeland. Singh plans to seek a vote of confidence in his minority 
government after Parliament meets Dec. 18.

South African President Frederik W. de Klerk announced a major defense 
reduction, cutting mandatory military service in half and promising to close 
some military units and facilities. The announcement in Johannesburg came two 
weeks after South Africa completed the withdrawal of its troops from Namibia, 
where they had fought a bush war against pro-independence guerrillas since 
1966. Ten days ago, in a reversal to longstanding policies of his predecessor, 
Pieter W. Botha, De Klerk scrapped a nationwide security network that was 
denounced as an unaccountable shadow government.

Leaders of the 12-nation European Community, meeting in Strasbourg, France, 
today are expected to discuss a closer relationship with the smaller European 
Free Trade Assn. Under a proposal by the EC Commission, the six Free Trade 
countries -- Austria, Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland -- would 
gain freedom of movement for people, goods, services and capital with the 
Common Market. The New York Times said today that an agreement will probably 
announced later this month.

F &amp; F Fisheries of Hanford and its manager, Dennis Faria, have been charged 
with killing migratory birds, a violation of federal law, authorities said. F 
&amp; F Fisheries, a commercial catfish farm, and Faria were accused of four 
counts of violating the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Federal 
investigators said the carcasses of 41 identifiable waterfowl protected under 
the federal law were found on the F &amp; F Fisheries property during a search 
last February. Investigators said they believe that the birds were killed to 
prevent them from eating the catfish raised at the fishery. Court officials 
said that, if convicted, Faria and the fishery could be fined up to $20,000 for 
each of the four counts, and Faria could face a jail term.

The Orange County district attorney's office will not prosecute a 15-year-old 
high school honor student whose newborn son drowned in a campus toilet minutes 
after birth. Prosecutors initially had sought to file murder charges against 
the girl, who gave birth Nov. 28 in a bathroom stall at Santiago High School in 
Garden Grove, and later considered involuntary manslaughter or child 
endangerment charges. But after interviewing the girl and consulting with 
physicians, prosecutors concluded the student was close to blacking out after 
giving birth and therefore unable to respond to the infant, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
John Conley said. "The way she described it, she never even thinks of picking 
up the baby," he said. The girl apparently never told anyone about her 
pregnancy and tried to hide her condition under loose-fitting clothing. The 
girl's parents only learned of her pregnancy after the birth, authorities said.

A 6-year-old survivor of Oakland's Nimitz Freeway collapse during the Oct. 17 
earthquake has been fitted with an artificial left leg and "is in high 
spirits," a therapist said. Julio Berumen was given the replacement at 
Children's Hospital, where he has been since he was freed from the flattened 
wreckage of his mother's car. His mother was killed and his 9-year-old sister 
was injured. "He's going to hate us before it's over, but we're going to make 
him walk, walk, walk," physical therapist Debbie Wong said. Doctors at the 
Oakland hospital said Julio may be home for Christmas and should be able to 
return to school early next year. He probably will eventually be able to ride 
the bicycle he won in a raffle a few weeks before the quake.

Two brothers aboard a ship that rammed a fragile coral reef pleaded innocent in 
Miami to federal charges of operating the vessel recklessly and while 
intoxicated. A grand jury Wednesday indicted Michael Anthony Bishop, 43, who 
was at the helm, and crew member Jerry Alan Bishop, 40. State and federal 
investigators say the empty freighter cut a 200-foot swath through a reef. The 
Oct. 25 grounding of the 155-foot Alec Owen Maitland off Key Largo was the 
first of three groundings in the Florida Keys during a three-week period.

The citrus canker scare that led to the burning of 20 million fruit trees in 
the mid-1980s reached the state Supreme Court in Tallahassee, Fla., with 
growers arguing that a compensation plan violates their rights. They said a law 
passed by the Legislature providing a $30-million compensation fund and setting 
up an administrative hearing procedure was unconstitutional because it denied 
them their right to have compensations settled in court.

relatives Wednesday after the Supreme Court rejected his request for a stay of 
execution. DeLuna was the 120th person executed since the Supreme Court lifted

MOVIES: DIRECTOR DANNY DEVITO'S 'WAR OF THE ROSES' TAKES A BITING LOOK AT 
MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If the American marriage is frail and on life support systems, then "The War of 
the Roses" (citywide) is the sneak attack that pulls all the plugs. Pay no 
attention to its frenzied trailer, which makes it look like an interpersonal 
destruction derby. In the hands of director Danny DeVito and writer Michael 
Leeson, "The War of the Roses" is biting and vicious, a styptic pencil on the 
battered face of "civilized divorce." It's also thoughtful, laceratingly funny 
and bravely true to its own black-and-blue comic vision. 
</P>
<P>
How could the marriage of Oliver and Barbara Rose go wrong? Upward bound from 
his first casebooks at Harvard Law School, Oliver (Michael Douglas) and 
outstanding college gymnast Barbara (Kathleen Turner) meet on Nantucket in a 
bidding war over a bit of 16th-Century Chinese ivory. 
</P>
<P>
Quickly in lust, they progress to marriage, the perfect junior partnership, the 
perfect set of children -- one boy, one girl -- the perfect old Washington 
house, even the perfect burgeoning career for Barbara when the children are 
older. Then, the perfect pfffft. 
</P>
<P>
The blindsided Oliver doesn't have a clue why, which is exactly the point. 
Although Douglas' performance has been calibrated to give some idea of Oliver's 
charm, particularly with his success-dressed peers, you could call Oliver an 
insensitive, workaholic, self-centered, couthless lox. 
</P>
<P>
With the boss over for dinner, Oliver prods Barbara into telling a family 
anecdote, then cuts in to tell it faster and funnier himself. He belittles her 
first business steps, using her contract papers to squash a fly. Then after 18 
years he wonders how Barbara, having been given everything, including a live-in 
housekeeper (the marvelous Marianne Sagebrecht, fine but underused), could 
possibly want anything more from life. 
</P>
<P>
When it turns out that what Barbara wants is out, and waiving alimony or a 
share of his business, asks only for their house -- which she has turned into a 
showplace -- the lines are drawn. He would rather die than let her have it. She 
feels exactly the same. Then DeVito, in an evil turn as Oliver's friend and 
divorce lawyer, discovers a little-used statute that allows the husband to 
continue to reside in a contested house. Now let the mayhem begin. 
</P>
<P>
Begin it does, escalating into tactics Medea might have admired -- and may even 
have used. This is not comedy in the Ealing Studios tradition; it's comedy in 
the tradition of the Three Stooges armed with tire irons. It may fright the 
genteel, but it won't surprise anyone who saw DeVito's "Throw Momma From the 
Train." Because Adler's novel is better basic stuff, "War" is far funnier 
verbally, but it's something more than punishing comedy. It's tragi-comic Cliff 
Notes on the death of marriage and the emptiness of perfection among the 
have-it-alls, and it can scare you silly. 
</P>
<P>
The beauty of Leeson's script, from Warren Adler's same-named novel, is that it 
builds slowly to Barbara's breaking point, allowing us to wince along with her 
at Oliver's every patronizing act. The tenacity of DeVito's direction, steady 
as a thumb pressing on a bruise, keeps the tone brutally consistent. If he had 
backed away or softened at any point, including our last sight of the Roses, 
the picture would have gone gurgling down the drain. Amazingly, for a film of 
the kinder, gentler era, DeVito (and the film's producers) stand firm. 
</P>
<P>
No one will ever call DeVito a discreet director -- not with his low-angle 
shots suggesting a weasel's-eye view of life, or his shot of Nantucket through 
the V of Barbara's legs as she shows-off with a headstand for Oliver's benefit. 
Yet DeVito also manages to suggest layers to both the potentially unlovable 
Roses, not only to Oliver but to Barbara as well. 
</P>
<P>
Turner's Barbara may be sexually triumphant, but she is socially unsure and 
after all these years with Oliver, her self-esteem has vanished. She is a woman 
who may not have been born to money, but who has learned fast and has poured 
years of studying and collecting into decorating her house until it could pass 
any Georgetown dowager's inspection. No wonder when Barbara's finished "doing" 
every room, there's nothing left to hold her interest. (This house, the work of 
production designer Ida Random, art director Mark Mansbridge and set decorator 
Anne McCulley, is dead-on. It conjures up museum-perfect but sterile 
perfection; the essence of the slick mag drop-dead environment.) 
</P>
<P>
It takes a certain nerve to serve up "The War of the Roses" (rated R for 
pungent language and sexual warfare) now. But if you're tired of cloying 
Christmas eggnog, "War" is Christmas spirits of ammonia. It'll pick you right 
up, leaving no nasty hangover and only a faint brackish taste in your mouth.

MOVIES: IT'S MERYL STREEP, NOT ROSEANNE BARR, WHOSE COMEDY SHINES IN DIRECTOR 
SUSAN SEIDELMAN'S "SHE-DEVIL." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "She-Devil" (selected theaters), the feminine mystique meets its match. As 
Ruth, the dumpy malcontent whose accountant husband Bob (Ed Begley Jr.) leaves 
her for Mary Fisher (Meryl Streep), a famously frilly authoress of romance 
novels, Roseanne Barr swaggers into frame and wreaks ungodly revenge. Her 
mission has rabble-rousing mass appeal. She's intended as a humongous stand-in 
for all the women who have ever been rejected in favor of someone younger, 
shapelier, fluffier. 
</P>
<P>
In her TV series "Roseanne," Barr's roly-poly bulk isn't played for vitriol and 
vengeance the way it is here. Beneath the wisecracking, she's soft and sensual 
on that show, and her big teddy bear of a husband, played by John Goodman, is a 
perfect counterpart -- his bluster is as transparent as hers. 
</P>
<P>
In "She-Devil," Barr's stridency is unimpeded, and director Susan Seidelman 
encourages our identification with her solitary fury. But Seidelman also can't 
resist scoring points against Ruth. She encourages our physical repulsion to 
the character, and so we're continually subjected to immense, looming close-ups 
of Ruth jutting her pudgy face at us. (She has a large mole on her upper lip, 
and more than a hint of mustache.) Her unattractiveness may represent women's 
worst fears of how their philandering husbands view them, but Seidelman appears 
to be in on the razzing. As feminist polemic, "She-Devil" is dubious indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Are there two actresses further apart than Roseanne Barr and Meryl Streep? The 
high anticipation for this movie is largely based on their pairing. But, except 
for an early sequence where they first meet at a book party at the Guggenheim 
Museum -- Ruth, in her floral print dress, accidentally spills wine on Mary 
Fisher -- they hardly have a moment together. 
</P>
<P>
The gloriously scabrous 1983 novel upon which the film is based, Fay Weldon's 
"The Life and Loves of a She-Devil," doesn't allow for much interplay, either, 
and, in literary terms, the separateness works. (It also worked in the 1986 
A&amp;E/BBC-TV miniseries of the novel.) Ruth's guerrilla missions require her 
to be at a distance; they're more fun that way, and more insidious. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a waste to have Barr and Streep in the same movie and then set them to 
shadow-boxing. We want to revel in the loony clash of opposite acting styles, 
but Seidelman and her screenwriters, Barry Strugatz and Mark R. Burns, haven't 
shaped the material accordingly. A few fantasy confrontations might have 
helped, since the film, even at its most "realistic," is such a hot-pink, 
high-camp fantasy anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The funniest sequences in the movie take their cue from this camp floridness. 
Everything about Mary Fisher is flouncy and full of feminine filigree; she has 
created herself in the self-adoring image of her own romantic heroines. But, of 
course, it's all just an elaborate act. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Ruth, the fantasy bottoms out, and Ruth and Bob's children, and 
Mary's unwanted decrepit mother (Sylvia Miles), intrude on Mary's seaside Long 
Island estate. Mary's demureness snaps. Her fragile feathery voice begins to 
bark with annoyance. Meryl Streep may surprise audiences with her comic zing 
here, although she was funny in her brief, explosive scene as Lillian Hellman's 
friend in "Julia," and slyly hilarious, too, as the lawyer in "The Seduction of 
Joe Tynan." 
</P>
<P>
Streep is such a studied, meticulous actress that, at times, her performance 
here seems like an impersonation of funniness rather true funniness. But she's 
so adroit that it's tough to tell the difference. Playing high-style knockabout 
comedy comes naturally to Streep, or at least it comes naturally to her 
performer's sense of craft. After such films as "A Cry in the Dark" and "Out of 
Africa," her role in "She-Devil" may seem like a lark, but Streep goes at it 
with a ferocity that, in itself, is funny to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"She-Devil" (rated PG-13 for strong language) is pitched deliberately shrill, 
in the manner of the TV shows and true-confession magazines it periodically 
parades before us. "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" makes an appearance 
here; so does People magazine and TV talk-show host Sally Jessy Raphael (as 
herself.) 
</P>
<P>
Seidelman is trying to co-opt the trashiness of the pop media to both give her 
movie a charge and to indict the culture that elevates the false prettiness of 
the Mary Fishers of this world. But Seidelman's sensibility is much more in 
line with Robin Leach's than she realizes. That's why Mary Fisher turns out 
rather well at the end. That's why, when Ruth starts an employment agency for 
the "unloved and the unwanted," the women who pass before us are viewed without 
sympathy as drab specimens. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that's why Ruth herself isn't given much of a send-off. She discovers 
her self-esteem in the transforming powers of rage, and it feels like a hollow 
victory. If Ruth is meant to be some kind of new-style heroine, what does it 
say about her that we last see her defiantly alone in the crowd?

About 130 miles off the coast of San Diego, in a claustrophobic, smoke-filled 
cabin aboard the aircraft carrier USS Independence, actor Willem Dafoe is lying 
on his bunk thinking about Auschwitz. It isn't too difficult. Dafoe has 
countless hours to while away over the next 10 days in this tiny metallic 
cabin, which he likens to a prison cell. 
</P>
<P>
He is on board the bulky carrier shooting "Flight of the Intruder," a 
big-budget action film for Paramount. In "Flight," a John Milius film being 
adapted from the best-seller by Stephen Coonts, Dafoe plays a heroic A-6 
bombardier navigator. The role returns him, in theme at least, to a setting -- 
the Vietnam War -- he has visited three times before: as an infantry sergeant 
in "Platoon," as an MP investigator in "Off Limits" and as a returned disabled 
vet in the upcoming "Born on the Fourth of July." 
</P>
<P>
But at the moment, Dafoe is taking a break to reflect on the making of "Triumph 
of the Spirit," for which he spent four months earlier this year filming in the 
haunting remains of the Auschwitz death camp in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"The place, in a very subtle and mysterious way, worked on you," Dafoe says, 
sitting up in his bunk. His gaunt, depleted appearance in "Triumph" has been 
replaced by a scrubbed face and the crisp, sharp edges of a Navy uniform. "I 
mean, it's easy to imagine. You'd pass by places that were so resonant -- a 
holding tank, a furnace. And that would stir your imagination and make you ask 
some hard questions." 
</P>
<P>
At Auschwitz, the 34-year-old actor did his best to relive the true-life 
experiences of Salamo Arouch, a Greek Jew and middleweight boxing champion of 
the Balkans who survived the World War II concentration camp by fighting other 
prisoners -- in between trained poodle shows and female impersonator acts -- in 
a blood-stained arena for the sheer pleasure of Nazi officers. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth, what went on there, is forever going to only stay with the 
initiator," Dafoe says. "There's no way for us (in the film) to tell you 
anything about it, or to explain what it was like. All we could do is create a 
sense of reality in the spirit of Salamo, and hopefully reveal something 
through Salamo. The character is like a witness. He's your guide through 
Auschwitz." 
</P>
<P>
Arouch, now in his 60s and living in Israel, was on the set of "Triumph" as an 
adviser, returning to the camp where, as a young inmate, he fought and defeated 
more than 200 opponents. He had to win each fight, since the loser was often 
marched to the gas chamber. Was the presence of the death camp survivor on the 
set like a ghost rising from the ashes of Auschwitz? 
</P>
<P>
"Oddly enough, no," Dafoe says. "I mean no disrespect -- I'm sure he's deeply 
scarred by this -- but he was a happy, tough old guy who wanted to tell stories 
and take me out in the ring and fight me." Dafoe laughs, and then quickly gets 
very quiet. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand, this is a man who loves life. The guy looked me in the 
eye and said, 'Life is a gift. Enjoy it.' That means something coming from him. 
He gave us his story, his blessing and some good advice. But I felt it was for 
me to go through the story and find my own way. He wasn't sitting there telling 
me what to think or how to feel." 
</P>
<P>
Dafoe says he has no idea how "Triumph" will be accepted in the shifting 
political climate of Poland, volunteering that he is not out to make social or 
political statements with his acting. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point I don't feel like I have anything to say. I feel much more 
comfortable doing things. Serving myself up to roles as if my life depended 
upon them -- that's my contribution. Committing myself to roles that have the 
possibility to express something larger than life." 
</P>
<P>
The actor's personal politics may be elusive off screen, but chances are, no 
one has ever accused a Dafoe character of sitting on the fence. If his 
characters are not out to save the world, they are probably trying to destroy 
it. Most of them have hearts of gold, stone, or fire. The Good, the Bad and the 
Angry. 
</P>
<P>
Dafoe's elemental roles, which he calls "forces of nature," include the 
persecuted Jesus Christ in "The Last Temptation of Christ" (the Good), a 
homicidal counterfeiter in "To Live and Die in L.A." (the Bad) and a shrill 
paraplegic Vietnam War vet (the Angry) in Oliver Stone's "Born on the Fourth of 
July." His portrayal of the "good" sergeant in "Platoon" earned him an Oscar 
nomination for best supporting actor. 
</P>
<P>
"What attracts me to those kind of roles?," Dafoe says, lying back on his bunk 
and repeating the question. His eyes wander upward, unfocused as he frames his 
answer. "I think they're mythic. They have some sort of size. They're fact. 
They go beyond identification, sometimes even beyond logic. They're not an 
imitation of something. They're the thing itself." 
</P>
<P>
A native of Wisconsin, Dafoe lives in New York now, where he got started acting 
on stage more than a decade ago. He began to catch the eye of Hollywood 
directors playing the maniacal urban gang leader in Walter Hill's 1984 "Streets 
of Fire," and he hit the casting agent's A-list with his performance in the 
surprisingly commercial "Platoon." 
</P>
<P>
Since "Platoon," Dafoe has been one of the busiest actors around, starring in 
"The Last Temptation of Christ," "Off Limits," and "Mississippi Burning." He 
has just completed a role as a creepy sociopath in David Lynch's "Wild at 
Heart" and goes directly from "Flight of the Intruder," which wraps next month, 
to star in the comedy, "Arrive Alive," for director Jeremiah Chechik ("National 
Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"). 
</P>
<P>
Despite the string of suffering roles he has played, Dafoe says his decisions 
are guided by characters he thinks would be fun to play. 
</P>
<P>
"Above all, you look at what the character does," Dafoe says, "and you ask 
yourself: 'Do I want to do those things? Is it going to be fun to take a walk 
in those shoes?' Because somewhere, really, it's all about pretending."

PRO ARTE QUARTET PLAYS AT COUNTY MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Extraordinary polish and burning intensity characterized the playing Thursday 
at the County Museum of Art Bing Theater, where the Pro Arte Quartet delivered 
an unusual program of Beethoven and Bloch. 
</P>
<P>
The evening opened with a rare performance of Beethoven's 1799 Quartet in F, 
which a couple of years later became the Opus 18, No. 1. The composer did make 
some substantive changes, tightening up development sections to create stronger 
harmonic motion, but this early version still has the character and drive of 
the familiar opus. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, it is still great music. Having reached that verdict, however, 
one must give credit to the skillful advocacy of the Wisconsin-based ensemble, 
which infused its performance with boundless vitality, telling drama and 
unusual eloquence. Paying close heed to the score's often-sudden dynamic 
changes, the four delivered a strikingly bold yet never unwieldy reading. 
</P>
<P>
A Middle Period quartet -- Opus 59, No. 3 -- followed, and the Pro Arte took 
its fervent, expressive approach a step further. The players may have traded 
subtlety and delicateness for incandescence and power, but as before, the 
ensemble remained taut, the intonation accurate and the technique clean. 
</P>
<P>
Following intermission, they turned up the heat still further. Joined by 
pianist Howard Karp, violinists Norman Paulu and Jae Kim, violist Richard Blum 
and cellist Parry Karp put extraordinary muscle into the driving ostinatos of 
Ernest Bloch's First Piano Quintet. Alas, that wasn't enough to redeem this 
nearly endless stream of melodically barren, rhythmically repetitious, 
thick-textured muck. Moreover, in their zeal for explosive power, the musicians 
lost some of the control they had earlier exhibited, and both intonation and 
tone quality suffered. 
</P>
<P>
Listening to an automobile horn blare for 30 minutes would have been less 
enjoyable, but only slightly. TERRY McQUILKIN

HOME TECH: LOOKING FOR A BELOVED FILM? GOOD LUCK; 
</P>
<P>
VIDEOS: OLD MOVIES ARE PRICED RIGHT -- $19.95 OR LESS -- BUT FEWER OF THEM ARE 
BEING RELEASED DUE TO THE ECONOMICS OF THE MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Most movie fans have a favorite film that hasn't yet been released on home 
video. Maybe it's "Three Coins in a Fountain" (1954) or "Harvey" (1950). Or 
maybe it's some early, obscure John Wayne Western or a movie featuring Mae West 
or Charlie Chaplin. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, fans feel it's just a matter of time before their favorite makes its 
home-video debut. But due to the economics of the vintage film market, they may 
have to wait for years -- or forever. 
</P>
<P>
The old-movie home-video market -- encompassing films that are pre-1980 but 
mostly from 1930-60 -- has changed drastically in the last few years, in some 
ways for the better, but in others for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the best thing about vintage movies on home video is the price -- 
$19.95 or less. That applies to oldies that have been in release for years and 
those put out more recently. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news is that, compared to the first half of the '80s, fewer old movies 
are being released. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the decade, when the home-video boom was getting under way, most of 
the cassettes available were old movies. The VCR population was still 
relatively small and studios hadn't yet started to release the majority of 
their current films to home video. 
</P>
<P>
"Back four years ago, video stores were opening up at an incredible rate," said 
Vallery Kountze, president of Republic Home Video, which has a library of 1,400 
Republic films and serials. "They were desperate for stock to fill their 
stores. The studios were flooding the market with old movies. You could market 
any old movies in those days." 
</P>
<P>
But the growth of the home-video market has slowed, and the market has shifted 
in favor of recent box-office hits. Since video stores now make most of their 
money renting those, it's tough to find shelf space for older fare. 
</P>
<P>
"Video stores don't stock old movies like they used to," Kountze said. "They 
stock up on the latest movies because that's what customers want. So when you 
put out old movies, you can only put out a handful a year and you can only put 
out those that have specific consumer appeal. You have to look at your library 
and carefully gauge what to put out and when. The old days of reckless 
releasing are over." 
</P>
<P>
Lack of shelf space is just one reason why so few are released. The other 
reason is the expense, which includes advertising and promotion, package 
design, sprucing up dilapidated prints and securing rights clearances for 
music, which is often governed by vintage contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"Putting out old movies is very costly," said Steve Chamberlain, vice president 
and general manager of Turner Home Entertainment, whose library includes the 
old RKO movies and pre-1950 Warner Bros. films. "You need to sell a decent 
number to justify the expense. That means you have to carefully select what you 
put out. It has to have appeal in a very competitive market." 
</P>
<P>
Chamberlain estimated that half of the Turner library of RKO and Warner Bros. 
movies won't be released because it's not economically feasible. 
</P>
<P>
Said Republic's Kountze: "A lot of the titles in our vault don't feature stars, 
or they're not well-known movies. They're simply not that marketable." 
</P>
<P>
The situation has improved somewhat in the past year or so, however, thanks to 
a revolution in the sales market. Mass merchants such as Target and K mart 
began stocking low-priced videos. Glenn Ross, vice president of marketing at 
Republic, said that from 35% to 40% of the company's business is now done 
through such outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Chamberlain said that last year, Turner released less than 10 old movies. This 
year, the total was 40. Republic's output is on the rise too. Kountze said her 
company put out 9 last year and 18 this year. 
</P>
<P>
"You can make money in the classic-film market, but the profit margins are 
small," said Ralph Tribbey, MGM/UA's marketing vice president. "That's why it's 
important to keep the expenses down." 
</P>
<P>
One of the marketing strategies is releasing the classics in groups. Generally 
they're put out in bunches of from three to eight, as part of a theme promotion 
based on a star or a genre -- like four Bette Davis movies or four Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Advertising and promotion are too expensive to put out one old movie at a 
time," said Turner's Chamberlain. "When you put out several vintage titles that 
are centered around some theme, you can spread the costs over several titles." 
</P>
<P>
Packaging, Republic's Ross explained, is much more important than it used to 
be: "Years ago, when the stores were buying just about anything that was 
released, packaging wasn't that important. But now, the market is so 
competitive, you want any edge you can get. Fancy packaging will lure customers 
and may make the movie more attractive to store owners too." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is convinced the effort is worthwhile, however. MCA, whose vaults 
are crammed with Universal films and the pre-1948 Paramount movies, is scaling 
down its old movie releases. In 1987, MCA put out 22 vintage films. Last year 
the total dropped to 17 and this year it shrank again to 14. 
</P>
<P>
Some movies in the library, may never come out, said Louis Feola, senior 
marketing vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"In many cases, it just doesn't pay," Feola said. "Some of these old movies may 
have limited consumer appeal. Or they may be tough to market for one reason or 
another. Or it may be hard to get clearances for music rights. With some of 
these movies, the print isn't in very good shape and restoring it would be very 
costly. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these are great movies that many fans would love," he concluded. "But 
we have to do what's dictated by the economics of the market. It's a shame that 
people are waiting for certain movies that may never come out."

HOME TECH: RENEWED INTEREST IN RENTING 'BACK TO THE FUTURE' VIDEO 
</P>

<P>
The smashing box-office success of "Back to the Future II" has rejuvenated the 
market for the original film, "Back to the Future," which has been out on home 
video since May, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"The original has been renting like a new release," said Allan Caplan, head of 
the Midwest Applause Video chain. "If it weren't for the sequel, the original 
would be renting very infrequently, just like any movie that's a couple of 
years old." 
</P>
<P>
Meir Hed, co-owner of the local Videotheque chain, said that "Back to the 
Future" has been a hot rental since the release of the sequel two weeks ago. 
"Rentals are up 2,000%," he said. "The word is out that seeing the first one 
helps you to understand the sequel. Now people who've seen 'II' are coming in 
to rent the first one. Also, some people are now renting the first one before 
they see the sequel." 
</P>
<P>
Louis Feola, MCA's senior vice president of marketing, said it's too early for 
figures on how many copies have been sold. but did say: "The great box office 
of 'Back to the Future II' has obviously stimulated all this activity for the 
original. Without the sequel, we wouldn't be able to do all this business with 
the original." 
</P>
<P>
Feola said that MCA began alerting distributors and retailers in May to stock 
up on "Back to the Future." A TV ad campaign for the movie in the Top 50 
markets includes pitches for the video. 
</P>
<P>
Since "Back to the Future" came out in 1986, industry sources say MCA has 
shipped more than 800,000 copies to retailers and distributors. Originally 
released to the rental market at $79.95, the price dropped to $29.95 last year 
and then to $19.95 in September. 
</P>
<P>
Feola wouldn't say when "Back to the Future II" would be out on home video but 
Applause Video's Caplan speculated that it would be released at a low price -- 
in the $22-$25 range for the sales market -- next May, when "Back to the Future 
III" is scheduled to hit theaters. DENNIS HUNT

THIS IS THE WEEK THAT WASN'T FOR THE RELEASE OF BIG MOVIES 
</P>

<P>
No news is bad news for video fans looking for another big-movie release this 
week. There isn't one. It's the lull between "Batman" and "Ghostbusters II" 
(already out) and "When Harry Met Sally . . .," "Star Trek V," "Road House" and 
"Great Balls of Fire" (all released next week). 
</P>
<P>
This week's slim pickings: 
</P>
<P>
"Listen to Me" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, PG-13). This 1989 drama's cast may 
attract you -- Kirk Cameron, Jami Gertz, Roy Scheider, Amanda Peterson and 
Anthony Zerbe -- even if the reviews were generally poor and the plot is less 
than irresistible. It's all about two members of a college debate team getting 
ready for the big match against Harvard. Yes, it's a very slow week. 
</P>
<P>
"How to Get Ahead in Advertising" (Virgin Vision, $89.95, R). We've had talking 
horses, talking mules and talking cars before, so why not a talking pimple? The 
pimple pops up on the shoulder of an anxiety-ridden advertising hotshot in this 
heavy-handed black comedy starring Richard E. Grant and directed by Bruce 
Robinson (both from "Withnail and I"). 
</P>
<P>
"84 Charlie Mopic" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, R). Even though lost in the shuffle 
of higher-budgeted Vietnam War movies, this 1989 drama about a six-man 
reconnaissance team that's being filmed by a documentary crew received some 
good reviews. The cast (Richard Brooks, Christopher Burgard, Nicholas Cascone, 
Jonathan Emerson and Glenn Morshower), though mostly unknowns, also was praised 
by critics. Patrick Duncan directed. 
</P>
<P>
"A Sinful Life" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, R). The L.A. Groundlings play "Just Like 
the Pom Pom Girls" was turned into this interesting 1989 failure -- a wacky, 
quirky comedy about the lengths a single, unemployed mother named Claire Vin 
Blanc (played by Anita Morris) will go to keep her baby (named Baby) from being 
placed in a foster home. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ann Jillian Story" (J2, $79.95). TV movie starring Jillian in her own 
filmography, tracing her career through her battle with breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"Ghost Writer" (Prism, $79.95, PG). Obscure 1989 comedy about a free-lance 
writer who "ghost writes" the life story of a movie star who's, you guessed it, 
a ghost. Not to be confused with a 1984 PBS adaptation of a Philip Roth story 
by the same name. 
</P>
<P>
COMING ATTRACTIONS 
</P>
<P>
"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" on Feb. 1 for $24.95 (VHS and Beta), 
$29.95 (laserdisc) and $39.95 (Super-VHS). 1989's second-biggest theatrical hit 
(after "Batman," of course) will be Paramount's first release ever in 
Super-VHS. 
</P>
<P>
"Lethal Weapon II" on Feb. 8. Warner will offer the hit sequel for $24.98 (VHS, 
Beta, laserdisc) and $29.98 (8mm). 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
"Anne of Avonlea" (Walt Disney, $29.95 for the double-cassette package) is the 
likable TV sequel to the great Canadian-series version of the classic girl's 
story "Anne of Green Gables." As in the first series, Megan Follows stars as 
Anne -- this time grown up and becoming a teacher. This 224-minute second 
series was shown on both PBS and the Disney Channel. 
</P>
<P>
"Kathy Smith's Ultimate Stomach and Thighs Workout" is a 90-minute exercise 
tape out on Media for $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
There's more new music video than you can shake a microphone stand at, 
including: "Bon Jovi: New Jersey -- the Videos" (PMV, $19.95, 60 minutes), 
"Depeche Mode 101" (Warner Reprise, $19.98, 117 minutes), "Bobby Brown: His 
Prerogative" (MCA, $19.95, 60 minutes), Laurie Anderson's "Home of the Brave" 
(Warner Reprise, $19.98, 90 minutes), "Reba McEntire: Reba" (MCA, $14.95, 30 
minutes), "Kenny G Live in Concert" (6 West, $19.98, 90 minutes), "Ice-T: 
Ice-Berg" (Warner Reprise, $16.98, 90 minutes), "Jody Watley: Video Classics, 
Vol. 1" (MCA, $16.95, 45 minutes), "Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Howe" (6 West, 
$14.98, 30 minutes) and "New Edition: Past and Present" (MCA, $19.95, 59 
minutes).TERRY ATKINSON

VINYL OLDIES GET EXTRA ATTENTION IN NEW FORMAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Hope Springs Eternal" -- the title of one disc in a new two-disc retrospective 
devoted to the inventive but short-lived Ze Records -- could be the slogan for 
one of the most encouraging developments in the field of compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
The fear when CD began driving vinyl out of the pop market in 1985 was that 
lots of valuable music would be lost to consumers because there wouldn't be 
enough sales potential for record companies to re-release old records in the 
new, costlier CD format. 
</P>
<P>
While there is much music of merit still unavailable in CD, there has been a 
positive aspect to the situation. Thanks to the consumer and media interest in 
compact discs, artists that are re-introduced in CD are tending to get far more 
attention than they would if their music were simply re-issued in cassette or 
vinyl. 
</P>
<P>
This is not only true of of special collections -- such as "Zetrospective," the 
Ze Records tribute from Island Records' Great Jones division -- but also the 
re-release of compilations or original studio albums by such acclaimed figures 
as John Prine and John Hiatt. 
</P>
<P>
Ze Records was a wonderfully imaginative New York label operated in the late 
'70s and early '80s by Michael Zilkha, a man with an ear for catchy but offbeat 
sounds that combined arty instincts with strong if quirky pop sensibilities and 
dance-floor impulses. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Ze artists featured in the highly recommended new collection: Was 
(Not Was), Kid Creole &amp; the Coconuts, the Waitresses (whose "I Know What 
Boys Like" cracked the national Top 100 in 1982), Suicide, James White &amp; 
the Blacks and Lydia Lunch.

<P>
HIATT/PRINE: John Hiatt and John Prine are two of the most gifted 
singer-songwriters of the rock era, but they have been seriously 
under-represented in compact disc. 
</P>
<P>
Hiatt -- whose sharply-crafted songs have evolved from bittersweet and 
sarcastic to comforting and warm -- has been making noteworthy albums since the 
mid-'70s, but only his two A&amp;M albums (1987's "Bring the Family" and 1988's 
"Slow Turning") are available in CD. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen Records, however, has now released a single-disc compilation that 
includes 13 of Hiatt's most prized tracks from his MCA Records and Geffen 
Records periods, including "Pink Bedroom" and "She Loves the Jerk." In 
addition, Geffen has released two of its three Hiatt albums (1983's "Riding 
With the King" and 1985's "Warming Up to the Ice Age"). 
</P>
<P>
Prine -- who has given us arguably the most evocative body of work of any 
folk-edged songwriter since Bob Dylan -- made eight albums for Atlantic Records 
and Asylum Records (including a greatest-hits package) before starting his own 
Oh Boy Records a few years ago. But only three of the Atlantic albums (1972's 
"John Prine," 1975's "Common Sense" and 1976's "Prime Prine") are available in 
CD. 
</P>
<P>
Prine, however, has obtained the CD rights to the three Asylum albums and they 
are all now in CD editions through Oh Boy. "Bruised Orange" was released 
several months ago, while "Pink Cadillac" -- an atypical, experimental effort 
stressing Prine's rowdier rock instincts -- and "Storm Windows" -- an 
especially compelling look at disillusionment caused by the break-up of a 
marriage -- have just been released.

GRAD RETURNS WITH PEP TALK FOR LATINOS

It has been 18 years since Jess Araujo was a student at Rancho Santiago 
College, in what he called his jeans-and-tennis-shoes days. 
</P>
<P>
Araujo, this time wearing a tailored, dark blue suit, returned to the campus 
Wednesday for a reception in his honor. Araujo is now a successful Santa Ana 
attorney, businessman and author of a newly published book titled, "The Law and 
Your Legal Rights." The book, in both Spanish and English, offers practical 
advice on issues including immigration, housing and renter's rights. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted something that Spanish-speaking people could use as a simple source 
of information for helping them out," Araujo said. 
</P>
<P>
While the reception was to introduce the book, Araujo directed his comments to 
the college students, most of them Latino. 
</P>
<P>
"Although I was born in El Paso, my barrio was no different than yours, and if 
I can become successful at what I do, so can you," he told the students. "You 
remember all those dichos (axioms) your parents and grandparents used to tell 
you in Spanish? You know, that stuff they told you about working hard now when 
you're young? Well, they're true. Hard work does pay off." 
</P>
<P>
It also helps to find a mentor such as Araujo found in former tennis coach Lee 
Ramirez, who now teaches English at Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Araujo said that in Ramirez he found someone he could talk to about personal 
things. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of Lee, I want to make a promise to you," Araujo told the students. 
"If you ever need anyone to talk to, for whatever reason, please call me. 
That's the least I can do for you because I owe it to this college and Lee 
Ramirez." 
</P>
<P>
One student, Amelia Melgoza, a mother of two, walked up to Araujo, introduced 
herself and asked him a question that had been puzzling her. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to know how hard it was for somebody like me, who is bilingual, to 
succeed in law school. He laughed. He told me I'm fortunate because I can speak 
both languages and not to worry, I'll succeed." 
</P>
<P>
Another student, Veronica Garza, 21, said she copied down Araujo's telephone 
number and intends to call him when she needs to talk to someone. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the middle of finals (exams) right now, and I needed to hear a 
Chicano speaker like him. I needed to hear someone tell me that if he did it, 
then I can do it," Garza said. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from Thursday's sale of Araujo's book will help establish a student 
scholarship. DAVID REYES

ANTI-DRUG MESSAGE IS TAKEN TO SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY PAULSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Preventing drug use among South County's student population was the topic 
Thursday as a dozen local politicians spoke to high school seniors at three 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-drug crusade came during the first Government in Education day 
sponsored by the Capistrano Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Although city, state and federal officials said they were encouraged by the 
positive responses during their classroom visits, the students painted a 
grimmer picture of campus drug use and the ineffectiveness of programs like the 
"Just Say No" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't take it seriously," said one 17-year-old senior who said 
he no longer uses drugs. "I used to laugh at 'Just Say No' all the time. And 
I'm clean now, but I could get (drugs) any time if I wanted them." 
</P>
<P>
The message taken to the classrooms by Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), city 
officials from Dana Point, Mission Viejo and San Clemente, and aides to two 
state assemblymen was that the war on drugs begins with the individual. 
</P>
<P>
But the politicians also acknowledged that their message probably had little 
effect on the beliefs of drug users in an age group that is not old enough to 
vote and pays little attention to government issues. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't (stop drug use) by standing in front of a class and lecturing," said 
Dana Point Councilman William Bamattre. "Most kids say they do drugs out of 
curiosity." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the officials said, the answer to preventing drug use among teen-agers 
is to use role models such as school athletes and celebrities and to establish 
a bottom line that the student is responsible for his own choices -- not the 
choices of his parents or teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Presentations by local police departments, ex-drug addicts and other anti-drug 
campaigns have proved successful, said Nancy Smith, principal of Ole Hanson 
Elementary School in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
But some students disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really think any of this has much impact," said Capistrano Valley High 
School senior Gretchen Fleishcli, 17. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to hear the facts from someone who makes decisions for us, but there 
is always going to be a struggle." WENDY PAULSON

CITY RENEWS DRIVE TO IMPROVE STOREFRONTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council decided this week to increase its efforts to get local 
business owners to participate in the city's storefront rebate program, which 
so far has received a cool reception. 
</P>
<P>
The program was initiated in September and is designed to help businesses 
improve the exterior appearance of their buildings, with the city footing a 
large chunk of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment Agency members expressed concern over the lack of interest shown 
in the program. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to make it a requirement to participate, but we do want to 
encourage the businesses," Mayor Charles V. Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Through the program, businesses can obtain money for: removal of old signs, 
awnings and exterior clutter; cleaning or painting exteriors; and the purchase 
and installation of new signs, awnings and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
They also can receive design assistance and construction-management advice. 
</P>
<P>
The program is targeted for buildings on blocks where improvements are 
scheduled to be made and along major traffic thoroughfares where buildings 
appear cluttered. 
</P>
<P>
Cash rebates of up to 75% are available for businesses that meet the program's 
criteria. Smaller percentages are available for larger jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency instructed city staff to take a more aggressive 
approach in getting businesses to participate. Letters detailing the program 
will be sent with new business licenses, and a brochure on the program is in 
the works. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Jerry Kenny said the personal touch is needed to make the program 
work as it has in other cities across the state. 
</P>
<P>
"Agency members and staff need to go out in the streets promoting the project 
instead of waiting for phone calls," Kenny said. GREG HERNANDEZ

PRIVATE TOLL ROADS GET BOOST AT MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a bid to obtain money for Orange County projects, state and local 
transportation officials gathered Thursday in Brea to tell potential investors 
and builders from as far away as New York, France and Japan about opportunities 
to build private toll roads for profit. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first such meeting in the state where companies could ask questions 
about the new state toll road program, as well as examine which Orange County 
projects may be suitable for private investment. 
</P>
<P>
The symposium, held at Brea City Hall, attracted more than 200 people -- mostly 
representatives of engineering firms rather than investment bankers. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature recently passed a bill permitting four private tollway projects 
in the state, at least one of which must be built in Southern California. Eager 
to position Orange County to get the first one, the Orange County 
Transportation Commission sponsored Thursday's meeting and has put up $300,000 
for preliminary environmental and engineering studies. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed private tollways include an 8 1/2-mile, $1.3-billion extension of the 
Orange Freeway from the Garden Grove Freeway to the San Diego Freeway; a Soquel 
Canyon route between Diamond Bar in Los Angeles County and Brea, and a Tonner 
Canyon route between California 71 in Riverside County and Brea. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth proposal is for a Santa Rosa Expressway between Interstate 15, near 
Rancho California in Riverside County, and the planned Foothill public toll 
road near San Clemente. The Foothill corridor is one of three publicly owned 
and operated toll roads already planned for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Williams, the Caltrans official in charge of the statewide site search, 
told symposium participants that the real test "is going to come in the next 
six months when we ask you to submit projects that make good business sense." 
</P>
<P>
A panel of toll road advocates ranging from Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden 
Grove) to Riverside County developer Dean K. Allen spoke, with several of them 
pitching individual projects. Later, members of the audience were able to 
obtain maps showing proposed projects and pick up other information. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade and Douglas, a Los Angeles-based engineering firm 
interested in the Orange Freeway extension as well as other projects, is one of 
several consortiums that have been forming to bid on California toll road 
projects. PBQ&amp;D's partners include Trans Route, a French firm, and 
Prudential-Bache Securities. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that we could build and operate a toll road profitably in Orange 
County," said PBQ&amp;D's Michael Schneider, who attended the session. "What 
I'm not sure of is the willingness of the financial markets to gamble on it."

DOCTORS FEAR FOR TRAUMA SYSTEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As one of Orange County's four trauma centers prepares to close permanently, 
California's top emergency physicians warned Thursday that if the emergency 
system does not work in a wealthy county such as this one, it may not work 
anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bruce Haynes, director of the state Emergency Services Authority, said, "If 
it can't work here, they're going to have trouble making it work anywhere else 
in the state." 
</P>
<P>
Haynes made his remarks at a public forum on trauma care at United Western 
Medical Center-Santa Ana that was sponsored by California Health Decisions, a 
nonprofit group based in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, some of Orange County's leading trauma doctors accused county 
supervisors of "abrogating their responsibility" and causing the life-saving 
emergency network to fail by refusing to reimburse hospitals fairly for their 
treatment of indigent patients. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dr. William Thompson, "I'm thinking about supervisors' not providing any 
money at all out of their own pockets, and this is ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Rosenzweig, county director of medical services, countered: "There's a 
limited amount of discretionary funds. It has to do with Proposition 13." 
</P>
<P>
Trauma centers, with high-tech equipment and with specialists on call 24 hours 
a day, offer more sophisticated care than a regular emergency room. When the 
system works, paramedics get critically ill or severely injured person to a 
center in less than an hour, thereby saving people who might otherwise have 
died. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County trauma care network was a national model when it began in 
1980 with five hospitals. The number was later reduced to four -- UCI Medical 
Center in Orange, Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, 
United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana and Fountain Valley Regional Hospital 
and Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
But directors of Fountain Valley have decided to close their center, effective 
Dec. 27. They cited $1 million in losses from treating uninsured patients last 
year as the reason. 
</P>
<P>
Trauma surgeons and some civic leaders have warned that without Fountain 
Valley, the Orange County trauma network will collapse. As more people must be 
taken farther to be treated, trauma advocates say, more will not receive care 
quickly enough, leading to more deaths. Advocates have asked the county 
supervisors to start putting funds into the trauma system to keep it 
functioning. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a recommendation by 45 member organizations, the United Way board of 
directors on Thursday urged the supervisors to "make immediate emergency 
allocations to save the trauma system" as it existed on July 1 -- that is, with 
Fountain Valley.

ANGELS CRITICIZE ARENA TRAFFIC STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Echoing concerns of nearby mobile home park residents, the California Angels 
say the city did not consider all the problems posed by traffic from the 
proposed $85-million indoor sports arena to be built near Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Angels Executive Vice President Michael Schreter said Thursday the 
environmental report prepared by the city does not adequately consider the 
increased traffic on Katella Avenue that will occur when events are held 
simultaneously at the stadium and at the arena. 
</P>
<P>
"The traffic in the vicinity of that intersection (Katella Avenue and Douglass 
Road) and backing up onto the 57 (Orange) Freeway will be terrible, if not 
gridlocked," Schreter said. "We are concerned . . . for the safety and 
convenience of our fans." 
</P>
<P>
Schreter also said the city underestimated the number of concurrent events that 
will be held if arena promoters attract professional basketball and hockey 
franchises to play there. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Anaheim Stadium parking lot cannot accommodate the overflow when 
7,000 cars compete for only 2,900 parking places at the arena. In fact, 
Schreter said, the Angels' lease prohibits use of the stadium parking lot by 
arena patrons on days that the baseball team is playing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the remedy is," said Schreter, who stressed, however, that 
Angels' owner Gene Autry is "very supportive" of the arena proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this . . . can be worked out without court," Schreter said. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' criticism, in a letter delivered this week to City Hall, follows a 
detailed, 67-page critical response to the environmental report by Jack 
Stanaland, president of Campanula Properties, which owns the Orangetree Mobile 
Home Park on Douglass Road, northwest of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Stanaland told The Times he is prepared to go to court to challenge the city, 
if the current environmental report is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
The arena is to be built on land purchased by the city for $8 million that is 
next to the mobile home park on Douglass, north of Katella. The arena would be 
privately built, but deeded to the city and operated by a private firm. 
</P>
<P>
Stanaland claims the city gave inadequate consideration to the effects of 
traffic and parking on the 400 residents of the mobile home park when preparing 
the environmental report. He said the city rushed its report to begin 
construction of the arena before a competing arena can be built in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Individual residents of the mobile home park have also filed responses to the 
environmental report, which the City Council is scheduled to consider approving 
on Dec. 15, said Joel Fick, Anaheim planning director. Fick said the city has 
also received responses to the report in from "a number of organizations." 
</P>
<P>
City officials will analyze the comments and prepare responses for the City 
Council to consider next week, Fick said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanaland claims it would be illegal for the City Council to adopt the 
environmental report because it contains inaccurate and misleading information. 
The report must be approved before construction can begin. MARK LANDSBAUM

3RD PROSECUTOR ENTERS CAMPAIGN FOR DIST. ATTY.;

Edgar A. Freeman on Thursday became the third prosecutor to announce that he 
will run for district attorney in the 1990 election to replace Cecil Hicks, who 
plans to retire. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman, 62, a supervisor in the district attorney's office for more than 20 
years, said he decided to run after he was convinced that Chief Deputy Dist. 
Atty. James G. Enright probably would not get into the race against Hicks 
protege Michael R. Capizzi, who is the chief assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the legal community had viewed Enright as the only candidate with any 
real chance of defeating Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said Thursday that he recognizes that he and Thomas Avdeef, a deputy 
who works under him, are viewed as underdogs. 
</P>
<P>
"No question that Mike's position as the front-runner in many people's eyes has 
to be a pragmatic consideration," Freeman said. "But I believe it's possible to 
put together a campaign to show the voters that my experience and my philosophy 
make me the best candidate for the job." 
</P>
<P>
Though some believe Freeman would see the race as futile if he had to face both 
Enright and Capizzi, Freeman said his desire not to run against Enright was 
because the two share similar philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy and I are longtime friends and associates; we think very much the same 
way," Freeman said. "But Mike and I have very different styles." 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef was in court and unavailable to comment on Freeman's candidacy. But 
several courthouse observers said Avdeef should be pleased to see a bigger 
race. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom couldn't possibly defeat Capizzi in June," said one judge who knows all 
the candidates well. "But if he could get Mike into a runoff election, then he 
would instantly gain the media attention he needs to help him go one on one 
with Capizzi." 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said he is committed now even if Enright decides to run. 
</P>
<P>
One problem for Freeman is that he has very little organization, and has only 
begun to think about financing a campaign. Freeman said he was still forming 
ideas for how much money he would actually need to put on a serious campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Though Capizzi was also unavailable to discuss the new three-way race, Freeman 
said he informed Capizzi ahead of time and that the two were cordial. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to treat Mike and Tom the same way I treat opponents in a 
courtroom," Freeman said. "You can fight hard against them without any personal 
animosity." 
</P>
<P>
The nonpartisan election will be in June; a runoff, if needed, would be in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman joined the district attorney's office in 1963, after more than three 
years as a deputy public defender. He was named an assistant district attorney 
in 1966 and is now supervisor for the felony child division, the child abuse 
and sexual assault unit, the hard-core gang and career criminal unit and the 
juvenile division. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman also likes to keep involved in trial work. In 1982 he successfully 
prosecuted Willie Wisely, who gained notoriety as a jailhouse lawyer and an 
advocate of inmate rights at Orange County Jail while awaiting sentencing for 
his murder conviction in the death of his stepfather.

PREP FOOTBALL: LA QUINTA QUARTERBACK CREDITS A RELAXED APPROACH FOR HIS

In these hours leading up to the Southern Section Division VI football 
championship, Richard Weaver is as calm and unassuming as a hidden bomb -- and 
ticking just the same. 
</P>
<P>
Weaver, 17, is the detonator for one of the county's most volatile offenses. He 
and his La Quinta Aztecs meet Corona del Mar at 7:30 tonight at Orange Coast 
College for the division championship. 
</P>
<P>
To look at Weaver there is little hint that he is an explosion looking for a 
place to happen, little hint that behind his easy gaze, the quarterback whose 
mom calls him "Richie," is ticking. 
</P>
<P>
That's because Weaver has learned that the low-key approach is critical to his 
success. While his teammates might get "all hyper and ready to go," Weaver said 
he learned that getting too excited wouldn't work for him. That realization 
came seven games into the season after a 35-24 upset loss to Bolsa Grande. 
</P>
<P>
"I went into the Bolsa game just really wanting to beat those guys really bad," 
he said. "I wasn't relaxed and I threw three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I just try to go into a game relaxed, keep my head, just think about the 
game in a calm way." 
</P>
<P>
The new approach, along with a healthier shoulder, is working. Weaver has 
always been solid, throwing for 1,678 yards and 13 touchdowns during the 
regular season. But in the playoffs, he has raised his performance a notch, 
throwing for more than 200 yards in each of three victories. 
</P>
<P>
In La Quinta's 20-7 semifinal victory over La Mirada he passed for 207 yards 
and two touchdowns, including a 65-yarder to Jason Cherms. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor Coach Jeff Brinkley, whose Sailors lost to La Quinta, 23-16, in 
the second round, saw Weaver during the summer in a passing league and surmised 
then that Weaver, who was the backup quarterback to Trent Julian last season, 
was coming on. 
</P>
<P>
"He was actually their No. 2 guy at that time and we actually felt he had a 
little more talent then their No. 1," said Brinkley. "Obviously he played 
really well against us. He is a good athlete. He makes some things happen back 
there." 
</P>
<P>
One of those things included the game-winning touchdown drive. With the score 
tied, 16-16, and about three minutes to play, Weaver and the Aztecs engineered 
a 69-yard, eight-play drive that included a 26-yard completion from Weaver to 
Wes Kollar that set up Julian's 18-yard go-ahead touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Weaver passed for 234 yards in the first round against Valencia and the Aztecs 
ran up 19 points in the first quarter. Valencia had given up only 46 points 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
All three playoff coaches agree that Weaver has caught fire since the playoffs. 
Part of the reason is he has recovered from a deep bruise in his throwing 
shoulder that hampered him part of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
He had to wear protective padding that hampered his throwing motion. The 
padding made him throw the ball too high, resulting in eight interceptions in 
the next five games. The accuracy was there, Takahashi said, but the ball was 
just going over his receivers to the defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
Weaver's confidence dropped but he kept at it. And when the padding was 
removed, his passing accuracy returned. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Weaver is just waiting and relaxing, ticking quietly, hoping to go out 
with a bang.

Todd Kehrli slugged down the last of his chocolate milkshake, wiped the bubbly 
mustache from his lips and slowly began to put the world of football, as he 
knows it, into perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, I didn't feel like a QB. I felt more like a robot," said 
Kehrli, a sophomore quarterback at Corona del Mar High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always thinking, always trying to think of all the things I was supposed 
to be doing. I didn't want to let down the team. I didn't want to let down the 
seniors. I knew they had faith in me, but inside, I was wondering if they were 
sticking with me 100%. Inside, I knew I could do it if I had the chance." 
</P>
<P>
Kehrli uses the phrase "in the beginning" often, as if he is looking back on a 
long, storied career. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Kehrli, who has yet to receive his driver's license, has played in 
only 13 games of organized football. He didn't play Junior All-American or Pop 
Warner, nor did he play in junior high. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, as a freshman, Kehrli was a member of the varsity -- backing up 
senior Ty Price -- but his sole priority was to carry the coach's clipboard. 
Although he did manage to get in on a few plays -- in late-game, sure-win 
situations -- his playing time would be most accurately measured in seconds, 
not minutes, as it consisted of one simple motion: 
</P>
<P>
Take the snap, hand off and get outta the way. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, Kehrli will be at the helm tonight when Corona del Mar (10-3) 
faces La Quinta (9-4) in the Southern Section Division VI championship game at 
Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
For Kehrli (pronounced kurr-lye), it has been a strange and wonderful season. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar, the defending Division VI champion, came into 1989 with high 
hopes, especially the seniors. Coming into this season, the senior players had 
lost just one game -- as freshmen -- in their tenure. They were undefeated as 
sophomores, and last year helped the Sea Kings to a 12-0-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
And so Kehrli knew that once Price graduated, the pressure to win would fall on 
his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar lost its season opener, 19-6, to Huntington Beach -- the game 
was later forfeited by Huntington Beach because of to the use of an ineligible 
player -- and Kehrli, who had a rough night, continuously overthrowing his 
receivers, began to hear the whispers around campus: 
</P>
<P>
"What's wrong with the football team?" 
</P>
<P>
"People didn't remember that that game was Todd's first football game ever," 
receiver Warren Johnson said. "He was really nervous." 
</P>
<P>
Although the next four games -- all victories -- quieted Kehrli's critics 
momentarily, the wrath started again once Corona del Mar entered Sea View 
League play. Estancia beat a listless Corona del Mar, 16-3, in the league 
opener, and Kehrli could only blame himself. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar, the two-time defending league champion, finished fourth in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
"I started doubting myself," Kehrli said. "I went into a slump. It started 
around the Estancia game and didn't end until (the league finale against) 
Newport. I felt I was a big factor (as to) when the team would get moving. In a 
way, I knew I was holding them up. Coach (Dave) Holland just kept saying, 'Give 
it time, just give it time.' " 
</P>
<P>
Although his passing suffered earlier from control problems, he began -- thanks 
to a few tips from his receivers -- to put more touch on the ball, and to play 
more by his instincts. His improvement would have been for naught, though, had 
Corona del Mar not received a wild-card playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
As he did in the regular season, Kehrli has shown marked improvement through 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
With 1,499 yards this season, Kehrli already has established a single-season 
school passing record, breaking Price's mark of 1,473 set last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nice, I think, to be remembered as one of the best to come out of 
Corona del Mar," he said. "But that's not the big thing on my mind right now. 
The game Friday night is about the only thing I'm thinking about." 
</P>
<P>
Spoken like a true veteran.

<P>
What's wrong with Foothill High School's basketball team? Judging by Thursday 
night's 57-44 loss to Mission Viejo in the first round of the Trabuco Hills 
tournament, just about everything. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill, a preseason top 10 team based on its impressive front line, lost its 
third consecutive game of the season by shooting only 26% from the field and 
committing 19 turnovers against a quicker and more aggressive Mission Viejo 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill opened a 13-8 lead in the first quarter and then made only four field 
goals in the next two quarters to fall hopelessly behind, 44-29 heading into 
the last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill opened last week with an overtime loss to city rival Tustin and then 
lost in double overtime to Dana Hills Tuesday. This time, the Knights didn't 
come close. 
</P>
<P>
"Our shot selection has been poor, our ball handling has been inconsistent and 
our defense has been weak," said Jim Reames, Foothill coach. "I wasn't happy at 
all tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Center Jamal Duff and forward Frank Amos were never factors despite enjoying a 
big height advantage. Duff, 6-foot-7, scored only two points and missed five of 
his six shot attempts. Amos managed five points but was two of 10 from the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill wasn't much better at the free-throw line, where the Knights made only 
13 of 28 attempts. Mark Wilkinson was the only starter to reach double figures 
with 12 points, but his passing left plenty to be desired. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Mission Viejo (2-0) displayed all the ingredients of a top 10 team 
with balanced scoring, depth and clever passing. Junior guard Mark Wright led 
Mission Viejo with 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very close to being one of the top 10 teams in the county," said Bob 
Minier, Mission Viejo coach. "I've got eight or nine good athletes who play 
together well. If we can get crisp, sharp passing and good shot selection like 
we did tonight, we can play with just about anybody in the county." 
</P>
<P>
In the Valencia tournament: 
</P>
<P>
Valencia 53, Katella 50 -- Guard Jason Bae scored 16 points and Richard Tibbie 
added 12 to pace Valencia (4-0). Valencia plays Servite for the championship 
tonight at 7. 
</P>
<P>
Servite 56, El Modena 53 -- Servite was led by forward Steve Marusich with 18 
points and guard Paul Stapleton, who had five three-pointers. Forward Jeff 
Leebdon paced El Modena with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos 58, Esperanza 54 -- Tony Cortez scored 19 points for Rancho 
Alamitos (2-2). Esperanza rallied with five three-point shots in the fourth 
quarter. Rancho Alamitos will play Canyon today at 3 p.m. for fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
Sonora 49, El Monte 48 -- Greg Farlow hit a baseline jumper with 10 seconds 
left for Sonora (1-3) in the seventh-place game. Farlow scored 18 points and 
had eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
In the first round of the Valley Christian Tournament in Cerritos: 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita 46, Brentwood 43 -- Santa Margarita took the lead with 4:30 
remaining in the game. Dan Bathey scored 15 points and had six rebounds for the 
Eagles (1-0). 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian 69, Mayfair 35 -- Ruben Oronoz scored 18 points and had 12 
rebounds for the Herlads. Whittier Christian will play Santa Margarita at 6:30 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
In the first round of the San Luis Obispo tournament: 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View 84, Coast Union 42 -- Lee Quinn scored 22 points and Marcel Tenberge 
and Darrin Ernst added 14 each to lead the Seahawks (2-0) at San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
In the La Jolla Small Schools tournament: 
</P>
<P>
St. Gregory 59, St. Margaret's 49 -- Ryan Westendorf had 20 points and 19 
rebounds as the Tartans lost a consolation game. 
</P>
<P>
In the consolation round of the Laguna Beach tournament: 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley 73, Serra 60 -- Mike Merli scored 25 points, including 13 in 
the second quarter, for Fountain Valley. Derrick Corcoran had 19 points for 
Fountain Valley (2-1), which will play for the consolation championship at 3:30 
p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the Cerritos-Gahr tournament: 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Millikan 95, Woodbridge 75 -- Millikan had four players score in 
double figures at Cerritos High. Bryant McLemore had 17 points and nine 
rebounds for Woodbridge (2-1). 
</P>
<P>
In the Garden Grove tournament: 
</P>
<P>
Magnolia 53, Buena Park 47 -- Magnolia outscored Buena Park 16-8 in the fourth 
quarter to advance to the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills 58, Garden Grove 56 -- George Benjamin 14 to lead Laguna Hills 
into the consolation championship game. Mark Perry had 21 points and 14 
rebounds for Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
In the Santa Ana tournament: 
</P>
<P>
Cypress 90, St. Paul 50 -- Jared Rice scored 37 points, including seven 
three-point shots, for Cypress (1-1). 
</P>
<P>
In the Santa Maria tournament: 
</P>
<P>
Marina 75, Cabrillo 59 -- Guard Travis Boyd had 20 points, six assists and four 
steals to pace Marina (2-1).

Mater Dei High School allowed only six field goals in the first half, made six 
three-point shots and won the featured game of the St. Louis Shootout, 
defeating East St. Louis Lincoln, 62-48, Thursday night in front of 9,569 in 
Kiel Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei (5-0) overcame an 11-5 deficit in the first quarter when guard Glen 
Malone made a three-point shot midway through the second quarter. The Monarchs 
led, 26-19, at halftime and opened the second half with a 9-2 run that was 
capped by two free throws and a three-point shot by guard Chuck Gray. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln (3-2), three-time defending Illinois state champion, suffered its worst 
loss in four seasons. Lincoln made 31% of its shots. Mater Dei made 14 of 27 
free throws and shot 38% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"The key was getting them into a halfcourt game and making them play defense," 
said Gary McKnight, Mater Dei coach. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln forward Cuoano Martin scored 14 of his game-high 25 points in the third 
quarter and led a fourth-quarter comeback.

92.4% EARNINGS JUMP PUNCTUATES FLUOR RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Citing growth in its engineering and construction business -- particularly 
overseas -- Fluor Corp. on Thursday reported net earnings of $108.5 million for 
fiscal 1989, up 92.4% from income of $56.4 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
The strong earnings punctuated Fluor's continuing three-year recovery since it 
began a painful restructuring, shedding its minerals business and putting less 
emphasis on petrochemicals. The company's revenues for the year ended Oct. 31 
were $6.23 billion, up 21.4% from 1988's $5.13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter, the company, the largest publicly held firm based in 
Orange County, reported earnings of $29.1 million on revenues of $1.67 billion, 
compared to earnings of $23.6 million on revenues of $1.61 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said Fluor's performance was on target with expectations. 
Wall Street reacted favorably to the earnings report, as Fluor's stock closed 
Thursday at $33.625 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, up $1.25 for the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
David S. Tappan Jr., who is stepping down as Fluor's chief executive officer 
next month, said in a prepared statement that Fluor Daniel, the company's chief 
operating unit, "achieved significantly improved earnings due to higher margins 
and increased market share." 
</P>
<P>
He also attributed the company's financial growth to a 44% expansion of its 
international business, which accounted for $2 billion of the company's $8.4 
billion backlog of orders as of Oct. 31. He added that the company's coal and 
lead investments also were profitable. 
</P>
<P>
"We are naturally pleased with our earnings progress last year but we still 
have a long way to go to produce the superior results we are capable of 
delivering," Tappan said in an interview Thursday. "I think Fluor Daniel's 
market strength and geographical diversification makes us very confident that 
we've only scratched the surface of the growth and earnings potential that lies 
ahead of us." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie G. McCraw, Fluor's president who is being promoted to CEO in January and 
will succeed Tappan as Fluor chairman in 1991, is taking the day-to-day reins 
at Fluor at a time when most observers predict its fortunes are on the upswing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think McCraw is taking over at a time when the momentum at the company is 
very, very strong. The backlog and the profit margins are still rising," said 
Mark Altman, a securities analyst with Paine-Webber in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts expect Fluor to achieve greater profitability in 1990. Altman 
said he believes that the company will generate net annual income of $150 
million, and Alan Dorsey, a securities analyst with Dillon, Read &amp; Co., 
said he expects the company will generate net income of between $160 million 
and $165 million. 
</P>
<P>
Tappan said with the prospects good for an extended growth cycle the company 
will be investing in development and training of engineering and construction 
personnel and in computerized engineering and internal communications systems. 
</P>
<P>
Tappan, 67, postponed his retirement for two years to preside over the 
restructuring of Fluor. In 1985 and 1986 Fluor suffered heavy losses due to an 
ill-timed investment in the minerals business and a dive in oil prices that 
killed demand for the large petrochemical projects that were then Fluor's main 
source of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
In the restructuring, the company's financial position was improved by the sale 
of most of its natural resources businesses, large layoffs of employees and 
paying down of debt. Tappan delegated to McCraw the task of integrating Fluor 
Engineering with its Daniel subsidiary, creating a more diversified engineering 
and construction organization. McCraw's success at this undertaking, Tappan 
said, is what gave him an edge over other likely contenders to be his 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
Diversification, industry analysts say, now is enabling Fluor to take full 
advantage of a surge in capital spending, which they note is a rolling trend 
affecting different industries at different times. 
</P>
<P>
Altman pointed out that while the capital spending of some Fluor customers such 
as pulp and paper manufacturers recently has started to taper off, plant 
expansion is growing hot in other industries such as biotechnology and 
pharmaceuticals. "That shows the importance of diversification," Altman said. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting Fluor's promising business prospects, the company said Fluor Daniel 
has been chosen by the U.S. Department of Energy as one of three finalists in 
the bidding for a $1.6-billion contract to design and construct research 
facilities as part of the "superconducting supercollider" project. 
</P>
<P>
The research facilities, in which scientists hope to test theories about the 
building blocks of the universe by smashing together atomic particles, will 
include about 53 miles of underground tunnels. It is planned to be built in 
Waxahachie, Tex., about 18 miles south of Dallas.

AD EXECUTIVE LEAVES AC&amp;R FOR COSTA MESA FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Cunningham, senior vice president and creative director at the Irvine 
office of national advertising firm AC&amp;R, has jumped ship to become a 
partner with an Orange County shop. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham plans to join Costa Mesa-based Roberts/Mealer/Emerson on Wednesday. 
The firm will become Roberts/Mealer/Cunningham on Jan. 1, dropping the name of 
James Emerson, who retired in June. 
</P>
<P>
AC&amp;R was Cochrane Chase, Livingston &amp; Co. until about a year ago, when 
it merged into AC&amp;R Advertising Inc., a New York-based agency. Cunningham 
said the change in corporate culture is the main reason he is moving after 16 
years with the same shop. 
</P>
<P>
"AC&amp;R is completely different from anything that Cochrane Chase ever was," 
he said. "There's no home control anymore . . . (and) too much stress on 
profitability rather than doing great work." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts/Mealer/Emerson is a 38-year-old advertising and public relations firm 
with about 20 people and has yearly billings of "less than $10 million," 
according to Jack Mealer, chairman of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts/Mealer clients include Magnavox and Emerson Electronic. 
</P>
<P>
Mealer said he expects that Cunningham will attract a number of new clients and 
hopes that the firm will increase its annual billings to $20 million within 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
AC&amp;R has 70 to 80 employees and West Coast annual billings -- including the 
Los Angeles, Irvine and San Diego offices -- of $80 million to $100 million.

S&amp;L SHUTTING DOWN TUSTIN OFFICE TO MEET NEW RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to help cut costs and improve its finances to meet the new federal 
capital standards that took effect Thursday, Constitution Federal Savings &amp; 
Loan said it will shut down its Tustin office on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The small thrift is one of several Orange County S&amp;Ls scrambling to meet 
the tougher new rules that require thrifts to maintain the same 3% 
capital-to-assets ratio as banks. Continental also said it recently moved its 
headquarters from Tustin to Monterey Park, 
</P>
<P>
At least two of those S&amp;Ls, FarWest in Newport Beach, with $4.7 billion in 
assets, and Huntington Beach-based Mercury, with $2.3 billion in assets, 
previously had said they would not meet the new capital standards in time. 
</P>
<P>
The two are preparing formal plans for increasing their capital -- by reducing 
assets as Constitution is doing, finding new investors or by some combination 
of those things. Mercury, in fact, has said that it must find a buyer to infuse 
needed capital. 
</P>
<P>
Two other smaller county-based thrifts, Charter Savings Bank in Newport Beach 
and Huntington S&amp;L in Huntington Beach, were not expected to be able to 
meet the new requirements. But officials at the two S&amp;Ls could not be 
reached Thursday for comment on their institutions' capital standings. 
</P>
<P>
A sixth thrift, tiny Delta Savings in Westminster, said Thursday that it has 
cut assets and raised additional capital and is in compliance with the new 
federal rules. 
</P>
<P>
When the rules were first announced early last month, top federal thrift 
industry regulators said that about 800 of the nation's 2,700 thrifts would not 
meet Thursday's deadline and that as many as 300 of them would be put out of 
business by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, regulators have seized one Orange County thrift, Security Federal 
S&amp;L in Garden Grove, declared it insolvent and placed it in the federal 
conservatorship program.

HAVING DICKENS OF TIME AT SCR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
South Coast Repertory has transformed the time-encrusted mythology of "A 
Christmas Carol" into a sprightly, well-turned comedy with an Ebenezer Scrooge 
who doesn't have a mean bone in his body. 
</P>
<P>
Scrooge is a penny-pinching grumbler, of course. And virtually everybody on 
stage either says he's a meanie or treats him like one. But we don't believe it 
for a minute. We're not meant to. Not in this version of Charles Dickens' 
Christmas tale. 
</P>
<P>
For no matter how bony Scrooge's face, how chilly his words, how miserly his 
deeds, Scrooge is a comic. This news should come as no surprise to regular 
SCR-goers. Hal Landon Jr. has played him this way every year since 1980, and 
John-David Keller has directed the show for as many silly laughs as it can get. 
</P>
<P>
The result happens to be highly entertaining, especially for a family audience. 
But it is not Dickens. It misses both the pathos of the story and the emotional 
impact. Furthermore, while Jerry Patch's adaptation manages to convey the basic 
message that kindness and charity are to be valued, the moral of the story is 
dangerously oversimplified. 
</P>
<P>
Every kid in the audience, and probably some parents, well may be persuaded 
that the inverse of the moral is true: By play's end, Scrooge discovers that 
money is the root of all good, as long as he gives it away. Money buys love. 
Money buys happiness. Money, more than generosity, remains his form of 
salvation. 
</P>
<P>
However, there can be no faulting the production for its liveliness, freshness 
and technical polish. It moves swiftly, yet without sacrificing too much 
detail. The acting is crisp and particular. Party scenes are radiant, with 
minor roles filled out beautifully. The music is warm, the costumes authentic. 
And the special effects, while vivid, are not overplayed. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, this "Christmas Carol" has the great virtue of not being boring, 
which cannot be said for many cultural rites of passage. It certainly works as 
a first taste of theater and may even whet a child's appetite for the real 
Dickens. 
</P>
<P>
Landon's star turn as Scrooge seems at all times a cross between slapstick and 
caricature, regardless of whether he's playing nasty (in his black suit and 
stovepipe hat) or playing scared (in his red nightcap and white sleeping gown). 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, his performance has been designed for kids. It prizes all sorts of 
amusing goofiness, including baby talk and an acrobatic hat trick. One thing it 
does not include is anything remotely British -- in keeping with most of the 
other performances -- though not for lack of trying. (Landon affects a peculiar 
accent that sounds vaguely Southern.) 
</P>
<P>
Back from previous years in fine form are Ron Michaelson as the Spirit of 
Christmas Present, Art Koustik and Martha McFarland as Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig 
(both doubling in minor roles), Don Took as Marley (also doubling), John 
Ellington as Bob Cratchit and Howard Shangraw as Scrooge's nephew. 
</P>
<P>
Two admirable newcomers to the production, Jarion Monroe and Devon Raymond, are 
outstanding additions. Monroe, who replaces Richard Doyle as the Spirit of 
Christmas Past, brings a precise elegance to the role (as deft in its way as 
the smarmy flair he lent to "A Chorus of Disapproval" earlier this season). And 
Raymond, as Belle, not only fits her character's name but has a quiet, 
authoritative presence that is very appealing, and talent to match. 
</P>

CHARM OF 'A CHILD'S CHRISTMAS' SURVIVES PRODUCTION DABBLING

<TEXT>
<P>
Director Thomas F. Bradac has reworked the Grove TheatreCompany's annual 
production of Dylan Thomas' "A Child's Christmas in Wales," a holiday 
entertainment that many felt was already in fine working order. 
</P>
<P>
Gone this year (the production's fourth) is the turntable set of a Welsh pub 
and Thomas' Swansea home; Bradac decided the old look was too bulky, not 
"aesthetically satisfying." The chummy living room, with its familiar banquet 
table, remains to hold the central action as the poet recalls the bittersweet 
moments of his best Christmas, when he was young enough to appreciate 
everything at face value. 
</P>
<P>
Filling the stage with outsized presents wrapped in shiny foil paper and bold 
bows, Bradac and designer Gil Morales remind us that the season is tantamount 
to a fantasy world for children. The director may be having some fun as well: 
Do the surreal images also evoke the materialism of Christmas? The young 
Thomas, perkily played by Danny Oberbeck, certainly dwells on the gifts he is 
about to receive more than those he is about to give. 
</P>
<P>
Bradac also felt that Thomas' language, a mixture of poetic detail and diary 
prose (adapted for the stage by Jeremy Brooks and Adrian Mitchell), needed to 
be emphasized even more than in past years. And with Gary Bell employing his 
full baritone as the adult Thomas remembering when, all the lovely winter 
images ("irreligious snow," "ear-pinching air") do ring through. 
</P>
<P>
The changes, though, are not extreme. The singing of several traditional carols 
by the able cast is still the show's charming touchstone. This production is a 
bit more fanciful, even a tad precious. But in the end it summons the same 
feelings of earlier efforts -- the pleasures of Christmas minus most of the 
mawkish overcoating that too often smothers other holiday productions. 
</P>
<P>
The faults are pretty much the same as in previous efforts. Certain scenes -- 
especially involving Thomas and his innocently roguish pals -- seem 
overextended. There's a pressing "It's a Wonderful Life" sentimentality that 
bubbles up as Bradac and his cast linger, a little full of themselves. But as 
Christmas shows go, this one has been, and continues to be, remarkable -- a 
tour through a holiday landscape raised above the mundane by the guide's 
touching literary style. 
</P>

A MOSTLY CHEERLESS, CHILLY 'CHILD'S CHRISTMAS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dylan Thomas' "A Child's Christmas in Wales" is not a Yule postcard, dripping 
with sentiment. It's a poet's vivid evocation of a jubilant boyhood Christmas 
Day spent with his large family in Swansea, South Wales. But you would reap 
many more rewards if you read the story this season rather than endure Troupe 
America's touring production. 
</P>
<P>
This bus-and-truck company from Minneapolis is faithful to the story but not to 
its spirit. Christmas here leaves you logy, as in too much turkey. The 15 
actors and the handful of props -- a hearth, a huge Christmas tree, a piano, a 
bar -- get lost on a cavernous stage. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the story's lure is more apparent at other theaters. But Beckman 
Auditorium at Caltech, where the show was seen Saturday, is not a dramatic 
venue. It's an orchestral and concert stage. A feast like "A Child's Christmas 
in Wales" gets swallowed up there, nullifying its ebullience. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset the production seemed chilly, and it only recovered near the 
end when the actors playing Thomas' family, his chums and colorful relatives, 
captured for a warm moment your own cheeriest Christmas memories. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' literary achievement is a Puckish menu of language and imagery 
embracing a morning's frolic in the snow, the unwrapping of presents and the 
gathering of the clan and the family dinner. Everyone is indeed a character. 
</P>
<P>
The story's language is painterly, suggesting those vibrant Christmas scenes 
with the family racing through the vast decorated house in Ingmar Bergman's 
"Fanny and Alexander." 
</P>
<P>
But proceedings at Beckman had the sluggish pace of real life -- that meant 
lots of dead spaces and pauses that deflated the work's buoyancy. Also some of 
the accents and the diction were unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Troupe America, for the most part, did catch the flavor of the '20s. The 
singing was fetching, and the actors playing the Dylan Thomas roles were 
convincing (Bernard Marks as the older Dylan looking back on his childhood and 
Larry Dean Birkett as young Dylan). But too many grinches stole Noel. Even the 
tree seemed bare of ornaments, and Dylan's dearly longed-for new red bike was, 
of all things, a contemporary model. 
</P>
<P>
 Plays Saturday, 8 p.m., at Plummer Auditorium, 201 E. Chapman Ave., Fullerton. 
Tickets: $12.50 to $17.50 (714) 773-3371. Also Sunday, 7 p.m., at Marsee 
Auditorium, El Camino College, 16007 Crenshaw Blvd., Torrance. Tickets: $15 to 
$22; (213) 329-5345.

BIG F TURNS BACK ON HEAVY METAL FASHION MODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is hard to say which Southern California institution is the most 
scandalously bankrupt: Lincoln Savings, or Hollywood Heavy Metal. 
</P>
<P>
The pages of photo ads in the pulp music magazines that chronicle the L.A. hard 
rock scene tell a story of creative and imaginative collapse that would be 
hilarious if it weren't so sad. Band after band appears in one of two ritual 
guises: the frowning, leather-clad tough-guy clones of Guns N' Roses, and the 
fluffy-haired, prettified fops made up in Poison's pouting image. 
</P>
<P>
It is a vision of rock as a beauty pageant, or a game of follow-the-leader, in 
which riches and fame await those who can best embody some pre-cast standard of 
outrageousness and rebelliousness. In a world where walking, cussing cliches 
like Warrant (this year's prize L.A. metal spawn) can sell a million albums, 
the inducements to run from individuality are obvious. 
</P>
<P>
The Big F is one Los Angeles hard rock band that has turned its back on the 
fashion sweepstakes. From the start, said Rob Donin, the power trio's drummer, 
the Big F decided that it would stay clear of the Los Angeles hard rock scene 
and its cliches. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't hang out in the Hollywood clubs, and we're not trying to get in with 
the Sunset scene," said Donin, whose band opens for Soundgarden tonight at the 
Marquee in Westminster. "It seems there are a few bands out there that are 
really sincere, and 2 million others jumping on the bandwagon with this 
instantaneous toughness. To me that's not rock 'n' roll. It's a Hollywood 
fabrication. We didn't want to be a typical rock poseur band. There had to be 
some substance there." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of making the Hollywood scene, Donin, singer-bassist John Shreve and 
guitarist Mark Christian spent most of the past three years in their tiny 
rehearsal room in North Hollywood coming up with the dark-visioned hard rock 
songs that appear on their debut album. 
</P>
<P>
"The Big F" is not a work of striking originality -- the echoes of such power 
rock precursors as Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix and, to a lesser extent, 
Aerosmith are much too obvious for that. But the band does pack a good deal of 
emotional force into its collection of melodic, hard-riffing rockers. If 
Shreve's wailing vocal style owes a big debt to Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant, it 
also carries a raw, all-out immediacy that makes the Big F's songs sound like 
intensely felt statements rather than studied Zeppelin tributes. 
</P>
<P>
The band's adopted emblem, a grotesquely phallic scene from a painting by 
Hieronymous Bosch, tells a good deal about its thematic slant. The Big F's 
ambiguous, symbol-laden songs frequently depict forces of control, ranging from 
religion to drugs to fashion, clashing with a fierce, sometimes threatening 
sexual energy. While the Hollywood metal crowd treats sex as a commercial 
come-on, the Big F seems serious about delving into sexuality as a source of 
mystery and power. 
</P>
<P>
"There are emotional elements within the three of us that we like to purge 
through the music," Donin said in a recent phone interview from a tour stop in 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of frustration and anguish that comes out. We don't repress 
things. There is a violent element within all of us. You repress that and, in 
my opinion, that's when you have these nut cases going around killing people. 
They repress until it blows up." 
</P>
<P>
That let-it-out philosophy also applies to how the band has operated 
internally, Donin said. "The casual observer would think this band is ready to 
fall apart" because of its members' penchant for arguing creative issues 
aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
"It's those instances when we are really angry at each other that things come 
out great. Each of us wants to be a dictator, and I think that's healthy. As a 
result you get a constant clash, and what comes out of it is pretty powerful 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Donin said that he, Shreve and Christian, all in their mid-20s, formed the Big 
F (he said the initial has no set meaning) after running across each other in 
separate Los Angeles bands. The band made no effort to build a local following, 
playing only a few dates last spring to which its manager invited record label 
scouts. The Big F had expected to release its first album on its own but 
Elektra Records offered a deal that Donin said gave the band the full artistic 
control it was seeking. 
</P>
<P>
While a name-brand producer is usually considered a prerequisite for a hard 
rock release on a major label, the Big F's members produced their album 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Other labels that suggested stuff like that (bringing in a producer) were 
immediately dismissed," Donin said. "There are very few labels other than 
Elektra that would accept 100% creative control." 
</P>
<P>
One consequence of not having cultivated a following on the Hollywood scene is 
that the Big F is emerging as a completely unknown band with no base of fan 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what our following is at this point," Donin said. "I don't know 
if the Big F is an alternative band. It certainly isn't in my mind a heavy 
metal band. Extensive touring right now is going to find the audience because I 
don't know where it is right now. There is definitely an audience out there for 
this. We have yet to clash with each other." 
</P>
<P>
The Big F, Soundgarden and Skin Tight play tonight at 8 at the Marquee, 7000 
Garden Grove Blvd., Westminster. Tickets: $10. Information: (714) 891-1181.

ANN CONWAY: BENEFIT FOR AGED ASKS $18,000 PER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The smelling salts, please. 
</P>
<P>
A bash with an asking price of $18,000 per person? At this time of year? 
</P>
<P>
You betcha. A bevy of heavy-hitting donors has already mailed in the megabucks 
to attend the fund-raiser being staged Sunday by Newport Beach newcomers Bob 
and Beverly Cohen (deep background: The couple owns what was once John Wayne's 
beloved bayside digs and the Four Seasons Hotel in the Hills of Beverly, a 
favorite pit stop of magazine giant Malcolm Forbes). 
</P>
<P>
The cocktail cruise aboard the Cohens' 127-foot yacht P'zazz and the dinner in 
their enclosed patio will benefit the new, nonprofit Heritage Pointe Jewish 
Home for the Aging in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Now, this exclusive splash is significant for three reasons. First, it makes it 
crystal clear that an organization can get away with an outrageous admission 
price, providing it provides an exclusive locale (and along Newport Bay these 
days, nothing is as all-out exclusive as the $10-million sea mansion that 
belongs to the charismatic Cohens. For starters, it features Oriental carpets, 
silk-smothered walls, gold-leaf ceilings, a cordon bleu chef and a cadre of 
servants). 
</P>
<P>
Second, it marks the first local benefit staged by the Cohens, who are highly 
regarded in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills charity circles for the mega-benefits 
they have chaired, including a recent one that hailed the philanthropic 
endeavors of Wallis Annenberg, daughter of TV Guide founder Walter Annenberg 
(guests included Jimmy and Gloria Stewart, Ali McGraw, Judith Krantz, Steve 
Allen and a slew of other Cohen-loving superstars). 
</P>
<P>
Third, it marks a celebration on behalf of a nonprofit retirement home that 
will be the first of its kind in Orange County. According to Meryl Schrimmer, 
its president, there are only two facilities in Southern California that offer 
members of the retired Jewish community an environment where they can live in a 
climate of Jewish tradition. One is in San Diego, and another, the Jewish Home 
for the Aged of Greater Los Angeles, is a favorite charity of the Cohens. 
</P>
<P>
When Beverly Cohen was given a tour of the modern Mission Viejo facility three 
weeks ago, she flipped. Flipped enough to want to get the ball rolling 
immediately on the "A Chai Sea Adventure" that has attracted guests such as 
Rita and Bob Teller, owner of the Orange County Market Place at the county 
fairgrounds (the swap meet that thrills the bargain-hunting masses); developer 
Arnold Feuerstein, chairman of the home's board of trustees, and his wife, 
Ruth; Sandy and Allan Fainbarg, a developer who also founded the Wild West 
Stores; Meryl's husband, Hank, owner of the Schrimmer Insurance Agency in La 
Habra, and Dr. Herb Modelevsky and his wife, Loretta, organizer of the home's 
nine Orange County support chapters. 
</P>
<P>
Why $18,000 and not $15,000 or $25,000? "The number 18 is considered good luck 
in Jewish lore," said Meryl Schrimmer, who confided she had found some jazzy, 
rubber-sole shoes -- a must for the teak decks. "And that is known as chai, a 
lucky thing, something that is a positive salute to life!" 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth," Schrimmer added with a laugh, "I told Beverly: Maybe 
we should call the party 'Adventure on the Chai Seas!' " 
</P>
<P>
'Tis a puzzlement: One minute Rudolf Nureyev was on stage at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center on Tuesday night, playing the scowling lead in "The King 
and I." The next, he was howling at a post-performance party at Scott's Seafood 
Bar and Grill in Costa Mesa, mugging it up for the paparazzi by popping a white 
linen napkin in his mouth and making face after slapstick face. 
</P>
<P>
How does he get from mean to madcap in a matter of minutes? No problem, said 
the Tartar who became the most famous ballet dancer in the world in the early 
'60s. "Actually, the King of Siam seems mean, but he really is not. He's just 
trying to protect his kingdom from cultural rape, preserve something that is 
good!" 
</P>
<P>
Nureyev and his co-star, Liz Robertson, widow of lyricist Alan Jay Lerner ("My 
Fair Lady," "Camelot") sat at a cozy table sipping 1987 Rutherford Hill 
Chardonnay while they dined on plump filets and piles of lacy onion rings. 
Beside them were buddies of Nureyev, including Wallace Potts, who had escorted 
actress Leslie Caron to the production (at the Center through Sunday). Caron 
(remember her in "Gigi" with Maurice Chevalier?) was visiting from Paris, Potts 
explained, "because she was looping a remake of the movie 'Heidi' that is being 
produced by Michael Douglas." (Looping has to do with dubbing in new sound, 
Potts said. "You know, you do a scene and later the director realizes an 
airplane is zooming in the background so you have to dub in your voice again.") 
</P>
<P>
Nureyev said he was was ecstatic over the production's Orange County premiere. 
"The theater is great. The story is great. And Liz was just wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Robertson loves playing the role of Anna Leonowens -- an English schoolteacher 
who goes to Siam in the 1860s to tutor the King's children -- she said, 
"because it runs the gamut of emotion. And it's a very feminine role about a 
very strong woman." As for her late husband, whom she met 10 years ago when she 
played the role of Eliza Dolittle in London's West End, she said: "He was a 
genius. He will always live through his words. And those words have helped me 
get through the hard times." 
</P>
<P>
Also in the glittering opening-night audience: the eternally beautiful Loretta 
Young -- stunning in a black velvet evening hat rimmed with blinding 
rhinestones -- accompanied by Henry Segerstrom, his wife, Renee, Renee's 
daughter, Nikette, and the legendary dress designer, Jean Louis. 
</P>
<P>
High times: Washington political humorist Art Buchwald was the laugh-a-minute 
highlight of the Times Mirror Community Leaders Dinner held at the Four Seasons 
Hotel in Newport Beach on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
After a cocktail reception, guests such as Donald Koll, Arnold Beckman, Harry 
Bubb, William Lusk, Reed Royalty, Carl and Don Karcher, and Otis Chandler dined 
on grilled crab cakes and veal medallions, then settled back to hear Buchwald 
regale the 280-strong crowd with gags that touched on topics such as the U.S. 
Postal Service. If the post office has its way, he said, the day will come when 
mail will be delivered only once a year. "They'll call it Mail Day! It'll be a 
holiday, like Christmas!"

Even if you have just cut your own tree an hour ago, when you get it home make 
another fresh cut on the butt to open the pores, which will have been clogged 
by sap. Cut off at least one-half inch. If you do not make a fresh cut, the 
tree will not be able to absorb water. 
</P>
<P>
After the cut is made, put the tree immediately in water; the longer you wait 
the less ability the tree has to absorb water. 
</P>
<P>
If the tree is not going into the house soon after purchase, it should be 
stored in a bucket of water on a cool porch or patio, away from wind and sun. 
</P>
<P>
An average tree may consume between a quart and a gallon of water per day. If 
the water level drops below the cut end of the trunk, a seal will form and no 
more water will be absorbed. So don't forget to add water every day. 
</P>
<P>
Place tree away from heat sources such as vents, fireplaces, wood stoves and 
fireplace inserts, radiators, television sets or sunny windows. 
</P>
<P>
After Christmas, before the tree dries, remove it from the house for pick up by 
your disposal service or for a local chipping and compost program.

Time constraints, modern life styles and weather all conspire to deny county 
residents many of the trappings of a traditional Christmas. There are not too 
many sleigh rides to grandma's, for example, when the thermometer lurks around 
70 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
But one tradition we can enjoy is cutting a fresh Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has a nice crop of tree farms where either you or the farm staff 
can cut a tree. Some farms provide services such as home delivery, flocking and 
fire-retarding; some provide seasonal treats. Most farms plan to be open until 
Christmas Eve but will close when their stocks are depleted.

SHE FINDS SWEET SUCCESS WITH CHOCOLATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six years ago, Leigh Saucer, owner of Azhmere Chocolatiere in Dana Point, knew 
very little about making chocolate and even less about running her own 
business. But Saucer has since gained a reputation for her ability to depict 
almost anything in chocolate -- a talent she says comes from being entirely 
self-taught. 
</P>
<P>
"No one ever told me what I couldn't make out of chocolate," she said. "Since 
it was all new to me, I wasn't afraid to try something different." 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the incorporation of Dana Point last year, Saucer designed molds 
to depict the entire city in chocolate -- resulting in a miniature replica, 
three feet by three feet, that included a chocolate harbor with the landmark 
tall ship Pilgrim cast in chocolate too. The scene included chocolate 
hillsides, streets, houses with miniature electric lights and a chocolate 
"Welcome to Dana Point" sign. 
</P>
<P>
For the holiday season, Saucer is making hollow chocolate houses with white 
chocolate snow on top. The recipient's name and address can be stenciled on the 
house to give the gift a personal touch. She also makes a chocolate Christmas 
card with the sender's greeting engraved or stenciled in white or dark 
chocolate and a solid chocolate Christmas tree surrounded by presents and a 
solid chocolate toy train. Prices for specialty items range from $30 for the 
chocolate houses to $125 for the Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
Saucer, who lives in Laguna Beach, said she entered the chocolate business "by 
way of mistakes, messes and miracles." 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Saucer left her position as director of instructional TV at KOCE-TV in 
Huntington Beach to become national director of children's TV and educational 
services for the Public Broadcasting Service in Washington. There she became 
disenchanted with children's programming and eventually decided to leave the 
field -- "but I had no idea where to go or what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Saucer decided to return to the home she still owned in Laguna Beach and tried 
to transform it into a European-style bed-and-breakfast inn. But the endeavor 
was unsuccessful, and one day she phoned a friend for consolation and wound up 
being invited over to make chocolates. 
</P>
<P>
"She thought it would cheer me up," she said. "I didn't want to go. I hated the 
idea. But I went anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Saucer presented the results of her afternoon's activities to a friend later 
that evening when they got together at a local restaurant to celebrate his 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the only gift I could afford to give him," she said. "But he was an 
entrepreneur type. Everything he touched turned to gold. He loved the 
chocolates and told me that I should start my own business. I didn't have a 
better plan, so I decided to give it a try." 
</P>
<P>
Saucer set out to perfect her recipe and struggled for hours in her kitchen, 
melting chocolate over bowls of hot water in the sink. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed to learn how to form and temper chocolate. I wanted the candies to 
have a distinctive shape. I worked and worked and couldn't get it right. 
</P>
<P>
"One day I just threw the spoon down in disgust and walked off. When I came 
back later and picked up the spoon again, I realized that I had inadvertently 
discovered the proper wrist action needed to shape the chocolates. But then I 
had to figure out how to do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Through continued trial and error, Saucer developed a product line and set out 
to persuade local specialty shops to sell her candies. 
</P>
<P>
"The only sales experience I had was selling vegetables at a produce stand when 
I was a kid growing up in Nebraska," said Saucer, who is 46. "But Linda Brown 
at St. Ives in South Coast Village offered me some pointers on packaging and 
became my first distributor." 
</P>
<P>
The present site of Saucer's candy kitchen is what used to be the office 
portion of a former Weyerhaeuser Co. greenhouse complex overlooking Dana Point 
Harbor. The surrounding greenhouses are still leased to nursery owners, and 
Saucer's operation seems a strange juxtaposition among the large white 
structures coddling exotic orchids and palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
But true chocolate lovers know that 18th-Century botanist Linnaeus was inspired 
to name the cacao plant Theobroma, which means "food of the gods," Saucer 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
And it is a heavenly aroma that wafts from Saucer's kitchen when production is 
in full swing. Her mass-produced line of chocolate candies and novelty items is 
also made here and distributed under the name Beach Cities Chocolates to 
specialty stores throughout Southern California. (Her handmade chocolates are 
sold mostly by telephone or mail order.) 
</P>
<P>
But Saucer retained the handmade Azhmere line to preserve what her favorite 
author, Willa Cather, referred to as "that intimate quality of things made 
entirely by the human hand." 
</P>
<P>
She came up with the name Azhmere after having a dream in which she found 
herself back on a TV sound stage being asked to think of a word that meant 
quality and luxury. In the dream, Saucer replied "cashmere," and a voice told 
her to "drop the C." 
</P>
<P>
This month, Saucer and her staff are prepared to work almost round the clock 
during the Christmas rush to transform 11,922 pounds of chocolate into 
truffles, turtles, liquor balls, chocolate Christmas cards and personalized 
figurines. 
</P>
<P>
Then Saucer plans to take a week off after Christmas to rest and prepare for 
her next project: making 2,000 miniature chocolate replicas of the new San 
Diego Convention Center for its grand opening dinner in January.

DEAR SANTA (ANA): POST OFFICE GETS LETTERS;

VISIONS OF 'SPITER WARS,' 'SOWING MASHINGS' DANCE IN HEADS OF LIST MAKERS

"Dear Santa, 
</P>
<P>
"I have ben a good boy but not prfitck. I would like a Batman costtume and a 
batman game. And maybee spiter wars. If you come I will give you some worm hot 
coco and draw you on paper. 
</P>
<P>
"Love, Tony" 
</P>
<P>
So maybee Tony isn't a prfitck speller. The Irvine boy got his message across 
just the same. By now, Santa Claus must be pretty adept at translating the 
scrawlings of youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Every holiday season, thousands of children throughout Orange County make a 
list and check it twice. Then they drop their wishes in the nearest mailbox. 
Sometimes with "To Santa" the only directive on the envelope. Sometimes with a 
hand-drawn stamp in place of the real thing. Sometimes with no stamp 
whatsoever. And often with no return address -- a guy who knows when you are 
sleeping and knows when you're awake must know where you live as well. 
</P>
<P>
All those "Dear Santa" letters eventually end up at the Santa Ana post office, 
hub of activity for Orange County's mail service. 
</P>
<P>
Letters like Darren's: 
</P>
<P>
"Thankyou for the guitar I relly like it. Next year I want a go cart. How are 
you. Can I ask you a question how many elves are there. And say thank you to 
Mrs. Clause and the chief elve I liked his letter alot. P.S. Will you please 
mail me back or you could let the chief elve to mail me back. And tell me how 
roodalf is and all the raindeers are doing I hope he doesnt have a cold like I 
have." 
</P>
<P>
Rest assured that the "chief elve" -- or perhaps even Santa himself -- will not 
let Darren down. The Mission Viejo child will receive acknowledgement of his 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
"We hand the letters over to the Salvation Army and other organizations that 
volunteer to help out," said U.S. Postal Service spokeswoman Christine Dugas. 
"Every letter with a return address gets a response. The Salvation Army sends 
out four different form letters." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the children employ Darren's tactic: Butter up Santa with a little 
sweet talk, and he will bring you good tidings. 
</P>
<P>
"I am 10 years old and I still think you are real," vowed Katherine of Orange. 
"Some of my friends don't think so but don't worry I do! Oh, by the way I like 
your reindeers A LOT." 
</P>
<P>
Santa must have a bumper sticker on his sleigh coaxing, "Ask me about my 
reindeer," because many a pen pal does just that. 
</P>
<P>
On her long gift list, Leslie Lynn of Costa Mesa included her yen for "a 
picture of Rudoff." Might such a shameless exhibit of flattery be called 
"red-nosing"? 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Lynn did not stop there. She demonstrated to Santa that she does not 
think only of herself by opening with a litany of items her mother could use: 
</P>
<P>
"A beautiful dress, a sowing mashing, a car (real), some stockings, some bras, 
a dozen dresses. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Other children are a bit more straightforward about the purpose behind their 
literary efforts. Gutsy Crystal, of Santa Ana, cut through all small talk and 
got down to the nitty-gritty. In a three-page, single-spaced, margin-to-margin 
letter, the girl supplied Old Saint Nick with what appears to be the unabridged 
inventory of a toy store: 
</P>
<P>
"A barbie corvette and a bike and a baby bunk bed and a little baby play pen . 
. . and a Cinderella vanity set and a Cinderella dress . . . and a rocker chair 
and a pool table and a little couch and the couch please can be red and a toy 
chest and please make it pink and a little electronic keyboard and a feet rest 
for age 8 to 9 and please make it blue. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
One no-nonsense child simply filled an unstamped envelope with ads ripped from 
a toy catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
Other children whittle their list down to one demand -- hard to fulfill, though 
that one demand may be. "I was wondering if you or your elves could make the 
log ride at Knottsberry Farm and then make 4 log cars," Rita queried. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and Kenny wish we were Superman, Santa Klos," wrote Bobby, in first-gradish 
print, from Brea. 
</P>
<P>
Beth, of Orange, registered a more tangible request: "I have learned to ride a 
bike. The bike belongs to my brother. I would like for you to bring me a bike 
that fits a small 7 year old girl." 
</P>
<P>
An anonymous correspondent wanted only "a lizzard and a wagon." 
</P>
<P>
Entreaties for live animals recur almost as frequently as those for Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtles. 
</P>
<P>
Catie, of Orange, distinguished "real live" animals from "breakable" glass 
animals -- and guaranteed Santa that she would take good care of the "real 
live" variety: 
</P>
<P>
"I want a real live bird (the cage is tightly sealed), two real live cats (the 
cats are trained to not eat the bird), a real live turtle, a breakable horse, a 
breakable china doll, a breakable unicorn." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the letters to Santa strike a serious rather than humorous note. "I 
been a good little girl this year," wrote Alicia of Santa Ana. "I would like to 
have a Pee Wee scooter. Mommy and Daddy don't have any money. Please get it for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
"Because Orange County is an affluent area, we don't get many letters 
expressing a drastic need for material goods," postal spokeswoman Dugas said. 
The mail that her division does receive from needy children is directed to 
volunteers interested in donating toys and food. "But some of the children 
don't include a return address. Those are the letters that just break your 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
Whether responding to a letter from a child looking to increase his Nintendo 
game collection, or from one who wants something a little more basic -- like 
shoes -- Santa answers with such noncommittal niceties as, "Merry Christmas! 
Thanks for writing!" 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, children might be disappointed on Christmas morning," Dugas said. 
</P>

GREETINGS NEED SPECIAL HANDLING: COLOR, CLARITY AND NEATNESS COUNT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
At the U.S. Postal Service's busiest time of the year, ironically, all those 
bright red and green Christmas card envelopes slow the process. 
</P>
<P>
The electronic eye in the stamp-canceling machine sometimes cannot distinguish 
a stamp placed on a colored envelope, and banishes the letter to the "reject" 
drawer to be hand-canceled. Such detours can slow delivery of the letter by a 
day or more. 
</P>
<P>
So if you are slow about getting your season's greetings in the mail, yet you 
want them to arrive by Dec. 25, you might consider using white or beige 
envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
Other pointers that will help move your Christmas cards along: 
</P>
<P>
* Address envelopes with dark ink that contrasts with the envelopes' color. 
Green felt tip on green background not only will baffle electronic eyes, but 
also will strain human eyes. 
</P>
<P>
* Better yet, type the address on the envelope. The Postal Service's artificial 
intelligence is not intelligent enough to read handwriting and will send such 
letters to the more intelligent -- but less speedy -- human mail-handlers. 
</P>
<P>
* Positioning the stamp neatly in the right-hand corner, rather than 
willy-nilly wherever it happens to stick, will assure that the stamp-canceler 
will spot it. 
</P>
<P>
* Over-size, bulky envelopes must be handled by hand from the starting line, so 
save your 20-page family update with photos for another letter.

GIN OR GINSENG, WE DRINK TO FEEL BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Why do human beings drink? To quench thirst, to be sure. But also to stay alert 
or get drunk, to cool off or warm up, or to soothe a set of jangled nerves. 
</P>
<P>
Bodies need one primary thing from beverages: water. Every cell in our bodies 
contains water -- an aqueous stock that should be replenished daily. Water is 
mainly what we get from beverages, from seltzer to soda pop. 
</P>
<P>
Even most alcoholic and caffeinated beverages are primarily water, but we don't 
necessarily drink them to quench thirst. Nor could we: Caffeine has a diuretic 
effect. So does alcohol; it interferes with the "anti-diuretic hormone," 
stimulating urination. Diluted beverages such as iced tea or wine spritzers, 
however, may have so much water that they have a net quenching effect. 
</P>
<P>
What, then, are alcoholic and caffeinated beverages? You might say they are 
liquid drugs -- legal, socially acceptable, pharmacologically active. That 
makes their role in our lives a little more complicated than milk's. 
</P>
<P>
Caffeinated coffee is our society's primary legal stimulant, alcohol our 
primary legal depressant. Herbal teas often have proven pharmacologic actions, 
some therapeutic, some mood-enhancing. From gin to ginseng, we drink to feel 
good. 
</P>
<P>
Modest daily amounts of alcohol and caffeine can be safe, even beneficial. Two 
or three cups of coffee appear to be fine for most of us. These days, though, 
fears of alcohol are on the increase. In November, labels from the surgeon 
general -- warning about the risks of drinking while pregnant or driving -- 
began appearing on all alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
But despite these warnings, several studies show that alcohol can be healthful. 
If you control your drinking, and aren't pregnant, a glass or two of wine, a 
couple of beers, even two shots of rye, appear to be reasonable indulgences. 
</P>
<P>
Some doctors similarly advise us that a serving or two of alcoholic beverages a 
day might relax us, benefit the cardiovascular system and stimulate 
conviviality. Three or four a day, however, does damage; over time, it can 
kill. 
</P>
<P>
"At three or more drinks a day, you don't see adverse coronary effects, but you 
do see increases in high blood pressure, cirrhosis of the liver, throat cancer, 
accidents, hospitalizations and mortality," says Arthur L. Klatsky, chief of 
cardiology at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Oakland. For men with high 
blood pressure, for example, going from three drinks a day to none for one week 
may lower pressure. (The Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health 
advises that even one drink is too much for pregnant women; alcohol consumption 
is associated with fetal abnormalities.) 
</P>
<P>
Alcohol can also kill quickly. Half the automobile fatalities and homicides, 
one-third of the suicides, as many as two-thirds of the drownings, and 
one-quarter of the burns, fires and falls in this country involve alcohol, says 
epidemiologist Mary Dufour of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
Alcohol might also play a role in cancer, although no one is sure exactly what 
that role is. A Harvard study of more than 87,000 female nurses (the Nurses' 
Health Study) found that women who have more than one drink a day have a higher 
risk of breast cancer. A National Cancer Institute study found this link even 
at three drinks a week. 
</P>
<P>
A "meta-analysis" of 21 studies, conducted by Harvard School of Public Health 
researcher Matthew P. Longnecker, reveals that two drinks a day or more are 
associated with increased breast cancer risk, but at one drink a day, the link 
is weak. "If alcohol is a risk factor for breast cancer, it's a relatively 
modest risk factor," says associate professor David Klurfeld of the Wistar 
Institute in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, women at high risk for breast cancer -- for example, those with a 
strong family history of the disease -- may want to be especially careful, 
notes Klatsky. "A women should look at the role drinking plays in her life and 
make a decision," adds Boston University epidemiologist Lynn Rosenberg. 
"There's a lot to be said for women not drinking heavily for general health and 
well-being." 
</P>
<P>
What you drink, and in what context, can influence whether alcohol is a 
healthful part of your life, or a problem. In many cultures, drinking wine or 
beer with food is routine, and wine itself is a natural fermented agricultural 
product containing nutrients such as magnesium, calcium and potassium. 
</P>
<P>
Red wine provides 5% of the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance for iron. Red wine 
might even offer some protection against cancer. It contains a substance called 
quercetin that, at least in the laboratory, strongly inhibits the growth of 
cancer cells, according to scientists at the University of California, 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Drinking a glass or two of wine with dinner or a beer after work is one of 
life's pleasures. But as a drug, alcohol is easy to abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"How a person handles alcohol is important," says Klatsky. "It's unhealthy to 
use alcohol as a drug, a sedative, a tranquilizer, or to drown one's troubles."

A 3-year-old Van Nuys boy who was reported missing Thursday was found unharmed 
this morning in Tijuana, and a suspect in the abduction was being questioned by 
authorities there, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Hector Vasquez was reported missing at 8 p.m. but may have been abducted from 
the front of his home in the 14700 block of Delano Street as early as 11 a.m., 
police said. The report was delayed because the boy's mother and other 
relatives each mistakenly believed that he was in one or the other's care, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Dennis Dunn said an unidentified person told police that the boy was taken 
to Tijuana. Two detectives drove to the Mexican border city and with help from 
local authorities found the boy unharmed at the airport. A woman who was with 
the boy was taken into custody, Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
Details on why the boy was taken and the suspect's name and relationship to the 
boy were unavailable, but Dunn called the case a kidnaping. He said the boy was 
driven from Los Angeles to Tijuana; it was unknown whether he was taken to the 
airport to be flown elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The woman in custody is a Mexican citizen, and it was unclear if authorities 
there would release her to Los Angeles detectives. Police here were also making 
arrangements for the boy to be reunited with his family.

A 50-year-old Sepulveda woman was found stabbed to death in her home, which 
apparently had been ransacked by her assailant, Los Angeles police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Gail Bronston was found dead about 5:30 p.m. Thursday when police 
investigated a call from a neighbor in the 8500 block of Decelis Place who 
suspected something was wrong, police said. The victim apparently was stabbed 
when she returned home, and might have surprised a burglar, police said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no arrests or suspects in the case. Police said Bronston's 1981 
Cadillac was missing; it was unknown what property, if any, was taken from the 
house.

MEDFLY FEARS EXPAND; 
</P>
<P>
2ND FOUND IN ORANGE COUNTY TRAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A fertile Mediterranean fruit fly has been discovered in Westminster, a find 
that could signal a drastic expansion of the crop-destroying pest's path of 
infestation, Orange County agricultural officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The non-pregnant fly was found in a trap late Thursday afternoon just south of 
the Garden Grove Freeway on Edwards Avenue, 10 miles south of the spot where 
the county's only other Medfly was found. 
</P>
<P>
County officials immediately began to blanket the region around Westminster 
with more than 1,000 Medfly traps in an effort to determine the severity of the 
infestation. 
</P>
<P>
They were still waiting this morning to learn whether the state will order 
malathion pesticide spraying for the Westminster region. State officials on 
Thursday, conceding that the problem is worse than once projected, revised 
their plans and ordered repeated sprayings -- as many as 16 -- for some 
infested areas in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"We're waiting to hear how this will be treated," county entomologist Nick 
Nisson said. "It's a very bad sign. This is an area removed from the other 
(detections), and that makes the problem appear much more serious and 
widespread." 
</P>
<P>
Entomologists dissected the Medfly this morning at the regional Medfly Project 
in El Monte and determined that the insect was not pregnant but that it was 
fertile and capable of reproducing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the next worst thing (to a pregnant Medfly); it's a wild fly, and we 
certainly didn't want to see that," Nisson said. 
</P>
<P>
How to respond to the detection of fertile but non-pregnant Medflies is a gray 
area in state protocol, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"Because (the Westminster fly) is an unmated female, the decision might be made 
just to trap and see if there are more out there," said William Edwards, a Los 
Angeles agricultural commissioner who is active in the region-wide Medfly 
Project. 
</P>
<P>
"Or we could go out and treat the area (with malathion) immediately. It could 
go either way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state agricultural officials said this morning that they will 
respray a 10-square-mile area of La Habra, Brea and Fullerton next Tuesday 
night, along with previously announced spraying that night of a new infestation 
area around La Habra Heights. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-square-mile region -- the first ever targeted in Orange County -- was 
sprayed with more than 500 gallons of a malathion and insect bait mixture last 
week, alarming some residents who worried about health effects. 
</P>
<P>
State officials maintain that the Medfly pesticide mix poses no risk to humans 
in the doses used in spraying, although its use is under review by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Medfly reappeared in Southern California in August, state officials 
have sprayed roughly 250 square miles from the San Fernando Valley to northern 
Orange County, affecting about a million residents. 
</P>
<P>
State officials are trying -- unsuccessfully, they concede -- to stop the 
further spread of the crop-attacking pest and prevent a repeat of the 1981 
infestation that ravaged the state's agricultural economy.

HONECKER TO GO ON TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
ACCUSED OF USING POST TO ROB STATE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors said today they have filed criminal charges against former 
Communist Party chief Erich Honecker and five other ousted officials accused of 
using their power to rob the state and live in luxury. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement preceded a crucial party congress that opened tonight in East 
Berlin. Party leaders were expected to choose their third party leader in three 
months and radically alter the party structure. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecution spokesman Peter Przybylski told reporters that formal charges were 
filed against Honecker, former Premier Willi Stoph and four other ex-leaders 
ousted in the nationwide pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
"They are accused of damaging the economy of the German Democratic Republic and 
of personally enriching themselves by abuse of office and corruption," the 
spokesman told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
He said the officials' homes were searched but did not say when the charges 
were filed or when a trial will occur. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the six are in prison. The 77-year-old Honecker, ousted from power Oct. 
18, is too sick to be jailed, and former Politburo member Hermann Axen is 
having an eye operation in Moscow, Przybylski said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Stoph, those under arrest are former Politburo members Guenther 
Kleiber, Werner Krolikowski and Erich Mielke, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two months of political upheaval in East Germany set into motion investigations 
into abuses of power by the ousted Communist elite, whose members allegedly 
used their high positions to live in luxury off the state. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker has been under house arrest in the lavish residential compound where 
he and other Politburo members lived. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party's historic emergency congress, held in an East Berlin 
sports hall, this evening began debating the party's proposed new program that 
calls for free elections and broad cooperation with opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
The congress was to elect a new leadership and reportedly planned to consider 
changing the Communists' name to the Socialist Party of Germany and scrapping 
the leadership hierarchy of a general-secretary, a Central Committee and a 
Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
East German Premier Hans Modrow delivered the keynote speech to the congress 
and echoed other calls for Communist Party unity. 
</P>
<P>
"Let us not allow the party to be broken, to go under, but let's make it clean 
and strong," Modrow said as the 3,000 delegates applauded. 
</P>
<P>
"We too are the people," Modrow said, referring to the slogan widely used by 
thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators who have taken to the streets to 
demand democratic reforms and the prosecution of corrupt former officials. 
</P>
<P>
Modrow, one of the few Communists to enjoy popularity, also ruled out 
reunification of the two Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
"Reunification is not on the agenda," he said as the delegates broke into long 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
The party agreed during historic "round table" talks with opposition groups 
Thursday to hold free parliamentary elections May 6, draft a new constitution 
and back the dissolution of the despised security police apparatus.

JOBLESS RATE AT 10-MONTH HIGH OF 5.4%; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: GOVERNMENT REPORT STIRS CONCERN THAT THE NATION IS FLIRTING WITH 
RECESSION.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unemployment climbed to a 10-month high of 5.4% in November and manufacturing 
payrolls shrank for the eighth consecutive month, the government said today in 
a report many analysts said showed the economy was flirting with recession. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in the jobless rate from 5.3% to 5.4% came despite the addition of 
210,000 non-farm jobs last month. A big jump in the number of Americans looking 
for work accounted for the rise. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the November jobless rate rose to 5% from 4.8% in October. 
</P>
<P>
The 210,000 new non-farm jobs reported nationwide by the Labor Department was 
in itself a moderately strong number, but the government also sharply cut its 
job growth figures for October from 233,000 to 93,000. That brought the average 
month-to-month job gain for the second half of the year to about 160,000 -- 
well off the average monthly gain of 270,000 for the previous 2 1/2 years. All 
of the new jobs have been in the service side of the economy; manufacturing 
employment is down 165,000 since March. 
</P>
<P>
"What it means is the economy is weaker than we had previously thought," said 
Elliott Platt, a senior vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette 
Securities Corp. "We're not in a recession yet, but we're perilously close in 
this quarter and probably going to be perilously close in the first quarter 
next year." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, chief economist Allen Sinai at Boston Co. Economic Advisers said the 
economy might already be in recession and at best was "near and certainly 
headed" for one. 
</P>
<P>
They and others predicted the Fed will relax its credit policy, but not all 
analysts shared that view. 
</P>
<P>
"The economy is kind of moving along in second gear," said Michael Evans, head 
of a Washington forecasting firm. "It's not very weak, and it's not very 
strong. I don't think these numbers suggest further easing." 
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate has not been 5.4% since January. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said the huge revision of the October job-growth figure 
stemmed from overestimating the number of teaching and other school jobs added 
this fall. That revision contributed to the reported decline in the number of 
local government jobs last month. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the service sector, which has been carrying the economy, wholesale 
and retail trade posted gains of 18,000 and 33,000 jobs, respectively, health 
services added 40,000 positions and business services added 13,000 positions. 
</P>
<P>
The department said manufacturing employment was down 27,000 in November -- 
with all but 3,000 of the decline coming in the durable-goods sector. The 
biggest problem area there is in automobile manufacturing, which lost 15,000 
jobs last month after losing 10,000 in October. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to evidence of a severe manufacturing slump, the government said the 
average factory workweek fell from 40.8 to 40.7 hours and overtime was 
unchanged at an average of 3.7 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
Mining and construction reported modest employment gains last month, adding 
7,000 and 17,000 positions, respectively.

PHILIPPINES: CHEERING CROWD OF 100,000 TURNS OUT AT RALLY TO SUPPORT HER 
BELEAGUERED REGIME.

President Corazon Aquino urged Filipinos at a rally today to unite against 
those who would "destroy our democracy" as a crowd of 100,000 turned out to 
support her beleaguered regime. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino said she will not relinquish her office to Vice President Salvador 
Laurel, who was elected on her ticket but has become a political rival. He has 
suggested that they both resign and call new elections. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino also pledged to investigate whether opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile 
was involved in the military coup attempt that began Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"He cannot wait to be president," Aquino said of Laurel. "I will never give up 
this position to him." 
</P>
<P>
The president spoke to a rally on the site where hundreds of thousands of 
Filipinos filled the streets in 1986 so tanks could not pass. 
</P>
<P>
Today's crowd was smaller than those in 1986, but appeared to be among the 
largest since Aquino gained power. Government offices encouraged employees to 
attend, and participants were brought by bus from as far away as Angeles, 50 
miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the crowd varied widely. Government television said 1 million 
people attended, but reporters put the number at more than 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino did not mention complaints by the rebels and other critics that she has 
not delivered on promises of social justice and reform. 
</P>
<P>
She delivered most of the speech in Tagalog, the main Philippine language, 
using an earthy accent and phrases associated with uneducated Filipinos. Her 
style recalled the simplicity and frankness that won millions of Filipinos to 
her cause in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking briefly in English, Aquino said: "I want all of us to unite and to 
give support to the democratic systems of government and to go after these 
people who want to destroy our democracy, who want to destroy our economy, who 
want to destroy the Filipino people." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd cheered wildly and chanted "Cory! Cory! Cory!" when she mentioned 
Laurel and Enrile, whom she fired as defense minister in November, 1986, after 
a coup by his followers failed.

Pravda today defended the leading role of the Communist Party, which has been 
scrapped by East Germany and Czechoslovakia and is now under assault in the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party daily said any article of the Soviet constitution could be 
reviewed or abolished but that dumping Article Six, which makes the party the 
guiding force in society, would not promote reform. 
</P>
<P>
It said that among those now calling for its removal were people who wanted to 
weaken the Communists in order to promote their own political ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
The Parliament in the Soviet republic of Lithuania abolished its Article Six on 
Thursday and legalized a multiparty system, while Estonia's leaders gave the 
go-ahead for a similar move by its Parliament later this month. Radical 
deputies, including Andrei D. Sakharov, have called for the issue to be 
discussed next week in the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies, the highest 
legislative body.

More than 1 million Palestinians were under curfew in the occupied West Bank 
and Gaza Strip today to prevent violence on the eve of the second anniversary 
of the Palestinian uprising's start. 
</P>
<P>
As it had done on previous days designated as special occasions by the 
Palestinians, the military confined most of the Palestinians in the occupied 
territories to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
In the Gaza Strip, residents in several neighborhoods broke the curfew to 
attend prayers. Soldiers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the 
worshipers, but no injuries were reported, Palestinian sources said. 
</P>
<P>
In Nazareth, the largest Arab city within Israel, about 30 Arab women held a 
demonstration in the center of the city in support of the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
The underground Palestinian leadership in its latest leaflet instructed Arabs 
to mark the anniversary on Saturday by observing a general strike, raising 
outlawed Palestinian flags and writing slogans.

the spring of 1991 as 1992 models. 
</P>

AMR REPORTEDLY CLOSE TO BUYING EASTERN'S LATIN AMERICA ROUTES

AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, is close to striking an agreement 
to buy Eastern Airlines' profitable Latin American routes for between $300 
million and $400 million, an industry source said today. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very close," said the source, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Eastern, a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., and at AMR declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, however, AMR officials confirmed that the two airlines have 
held discussions about the sale of the Latin routes for several months. The 
acquisition of the routes, which operate out of Eastern's Miami hub, would 
strengthen AMR, already the largest U.S. carrier. 
</P>
<P>
The deal would further erode Eastern, which has been shedding assets, including 
its Washington-New York-Boston shuttle service, since March when it filed under 
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The company filed for bankruptcy a few 
days after its machinists union went on strike. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern has resisted a sale of its Latin American routes, one of its strongest 
services. But industry sources say Eastern resumed talks with AMR last month 
after it discovered that it was facing an unanticipated $200-million shortfall.

816 THRIFTS REPORTED NOT UP TO STANDARDS

About 800 of the nation's 2,700 federally chartered thrifts failed to meet a 
crucial test of their financial health and could face regulatory action, a 
Florida research company said today. 
</P>
<P>
Under new requirements imposed by the federal government Thursday, thrifts must 
have a higher capital cushion in relation to the size of their total loans 
outstanding. Those who failed the test will be given until Feb. 5 to come up 
with additional reserves, but many thrifts will ultimately be closed. 
</P>
<P>
The research company, Bauer Financial Reports Inc., estimated that 816 thrifts 
would fail to meet the new capital guidelines. Bauer said its analysis was 
based on quarterly data for thrifts, as reported to federal regulators for the 
period ended June 30, the most recent figures available.

Chicago Tribune Editor James D. Squires announced his resignation today, 
effective Jan. 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
No successor was named immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"My decision was made for two reasons -- to ease and expedite the transition to 
a new era of newspaper leadership, begun this time last year, with the 
appointment of a new president -- and to placate my own restless heart," 
Squires said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Squires referred to the appointment last year of Tribune President John W. 
Madigan. 
</P>
<P>
Squires was named editor of the Tribune in 1981. Previously he was editor of 
the Orlando Sentinel and chief of the Tribune's Washington bureau. 
</P>
<P>
His tenure at the Tribune has been marked by often surprising and sweeping 
changes in staff assignments, including a recent switch of the newspaper's 
legal reporter to the Notre Dame football beat.

NORTON SIMON ON LIST OF BOGUS REMBRANDTS; 
</P>
<P>
ART: PANEL OF EXPERTS, IN THIRD OF FIVE REPORTS, SAYS ABOUT 50 PAINTINGS BY THE 
DUTCH MASTER WERE REALLY THE WORK OF OTHERS.

<P>
A research panel says about 50 paintings attributed to 17th-Century Dutch 
master Rembrandt van Rijn are works of other artists -- including a 1636 
portrait in the collection of the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The Norton Simon Museum acquired the portrait, which the panel attributes to 
Rembrandt contemporary Carel Fabritius, for about $3.8 million in 1969. If sold 
as a genuine Rembrandt, the painting would probably bring more than $10 million 
today. But as the work of Fabritius, who is known as a Rembrandt imitator, the 
painting's value would drop to about one-tenth of that. 
</P>
<P>
But the Simon museum rejects the panel's assessment of its painting and has no 
plans to change the attribution, according to Vickie Rogers, director of 
program planning. "We do not endorse the methods of the Rembrandt Research 
Group. Rembrandt attributions have been debated for 300 years, and this is just 
the latest chapter in that discussion. History will decide," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
The portrait will remain on view along with the museum's two other Rembrandt 
paintings, "Titus" and "Picture of a Bearded Man in Wide-brimmed Hat," Rogers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rembrandt Research Group, which is looking at all 500 to 600 works 
attributed to the artist, published its third of five volumes today. Of 100 
paintings examined in Volume 3, "about 50% are not genuine Rembrandts," said 
panel member Jozua Bruin. Also questioned was the 1635 "Landscape with 
Carriage," owned by the Wallace Collection in London. 
</P>
<P>
"The outcome of Volume 3 reflects the 50% score in the first two volumes," 
Bruin said. In those volumes, roughly 100 paintings were branded as wrongly 
attributed to Rembrandt. 
</P>
<P>
The third volume, in which Rembrandt's monumental "Night Watch" has gotten the 
stamp of approval, was published today. The first and second volumes were 
published in 1982 and 1986 respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the falsely attributed works probably were painted by Rembrandt 
students or paid assistants in his workshop, according to Bruin. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, which is subsidized by the Dutch government, began its work 21 years 
ago. It scrutinizes each work with a close analysis of the paint, the cloth or 
wood on which it is painted, and ultimately, the painting style, according to 
Bruin.

The volatile mixture of art and commerce has erupted in a multimillion-dollar 
lawsuit filed by a collector against a scholar and the venerable Metropolitan 
Museum of Art in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The man in the middle is American artist John La Farge, a muralist and 
stained-glass maker who lived from 1835 to 1910. La Farge, whose works now sell 
in six figures, decorated the palaces of New York's gilded age and public 
buildings nationwide. He invented the opalescent glass widely commercialized by 
Tiffany. 
</P>
<P>
The vagaries of assigning a monetary value to his individual creative works are 
at the center of the $28-million lawsuit filed in federal court in New Jersey 
by Sean M. McNally, a former investment banker who devotes his time to studying 
and dealing in La Farge works. McNally claims he's the victim of professional 
jealousy, while a lawyer for La Farge scholar James Yarnall of Washington 
charges that the lawsuit challenges the integrity of art scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
According to McNally's court papers, the seeds of the dispute were sown in 
February, 1988, when McNally appraised a La Farge piece called "Moon Window" 
for a private collector at $20,000. Yarnall told Met benefactor Richard M. 
Schwartz that "Moon Window" was worth $200,000, the lawsuit said. Schwartz 
bought the work for $165,000 a month later. 
</P>
<P>
In April, its companion piece sold at auction for $14,200. 
</P>
<P>
That sale showed Yarnall's appraisal to be inaccurate and set him on his course 
to "denigrate and diminish" both McNally's collection and his professional 
reputation, the lawsuit alleged. 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit, Yarnall also told Schwartz in the presence of Met 
officials that a McNally window was unimportant, badly restored and not worth 
the $150,000 Schwartz was ready to pay for it. That appraisal sank the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed Nov. 28, has slander, libel and contract interference claims 
and seeks at least $28 million in punitive and other damages.

Gannett Co. Inc. and television producer Grant Tinker announced they have 
terminated their partnership to produce television shows, which resulted in the 
ill-fated "USA Today on TV." 
</P>
<P>
Both sides said Thursday they were seeking a new financial backer to replace 
Gannett's involvement in GTG Entertainment, as the joint venture is called. 
</P>
<P>
GTG, based in Culver City, was formed in 1987 by Tinker, a former chairman of 
NBC, and Gannett, a media company, to produce television programs for networks 
and for syndication. 
</P>
<P>
GTG's daily syndicated news program modeled on Gannett's USA Today newspaper 
was canceled last month after it received poor reviews and generally low 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
GTG also produces "Baywatch," which has been renewed for this season by NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Sheilah Gibbons, a Gannett spokeswoman, told the New York Times that a mutual 
decision was reached to end the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Neither side offered any specific reason for the decision.

Paul McCartney is singing a slightly different tune now about a possible 
Beatles reunion. 
</P>
<P>
When McCartney suggested last month in Los Angeles that he, George Harrison and 
Ringo Starr might come together for a reunion, Harrison responded that there 
wouldn't be one "as long as John Lennon remains dead." 
</P>
<P>
McCartney said Thursday he understood. But he still held out hope for a 
reunion. 
</P>
<P>
"There can't be a Beatles reunion because John died," McCartney told a news 
conference before his concert at the SkyDome. 
</P>
<P>
"And I don't think any of us would be interested in substituting someone for

Author Tom Clancy, master of Cold War thrillers, says he's not worried that the 
warming of relations between the superpowers will put his career on ice. 
</P>
<P>
Pretending to point a gun at a questioner, Clancy said: "I stand like this for 
30 years, and then the 31st year I say, 'Hey, you're not such a bad guy after 
all,' but I don't move. Would you still be worried?" 
</P>
<P>
As long as the Soviet Union remains a Communist military power, Clancy said 
he'll find plenty of grist for his best-selling novels of Soviet-U.S. conflict 
and intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
During a visit Thursday to his alma mater, Loyola High School, Clancy said his 
Jesuit instructors were firm in teaching him the difference between right and 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys don't let you forget. They beat it into your head," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Clancy, who is the son of a Baltimore mail carrier, said he was a "crummy 
student" at Loyola but then started to dream of becoming a writer.

FRACTURED HIP SIDELINES CHANG AT LEAST 8 WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Michael Chang pulled out of the $650,000 Stakes Match that starts today after 
fracturing his hip during practice. He will be sidelined 8 to 12 weeks, a 
tournament spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The world's fifth-ranked player was practicing with a tennis pro Wednesday and 
"apparently just pulled up after practicing for about an hour," said spokesman 
Kevin O'Keefe. 
</P>
<P>
"I went for a backhand deep in the far corner, I made contact and my hip 
cracked," Chang told The Times today. "I heard it crack. I started to limp all 
over the place. I couldn't stop limping." 
</P>
<P>
Chang said he expects to be on crutches for a month, which may place his U.S. 
Davis Cup hopes in early February against Mexico in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to be able to do anything for at least eight weeks," said Chang, 
who plans to discuss his availability for the Davis Cup with Gorman next week 
when Chang returns home to Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors told me what happened to me was really unusual because I didn't 
knock into anything," Chang said. "There was just so much power or something on 
my swing that it just cracked it." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Paul Shirley, medical director of the Assn. of Tennis Professionals, 
examined Chang at Baptist Medical Center in Jacksonville and diagnosed "a 
fracture of the cup of the left hip joint right at the point where the ball 
goes into socket," O'Keefe said.

South African David Frost fired a 6-under-par 66 today and took a three-stroke 
lead after the second round of golf's most lucrative tournament, the Million 
Dollar Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Frost, winner of the World Series of Golf this year, ended the 
storm-interrupted round with a 36-hole score of 133, eleven strokes under par. 
</P>
<P>
American Tim Simpson, with a 69 today, fell to second place, and Scott Hoch, 
with a 72, dropped six strokes off the pace to third place. 
</P>
<P>
The three began the round tied for the lead at 67. 
</P>
<P>
The purse for the four-day, 10-player event is $2.3 million, including $1 
million for the winner. The last-place finisher will get $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing Hoch were three more Americans: Chip Beck at 142 after a 70; Don 
Pooley at even-par 144 after a 71, and Scott Simpson at 147 after a 75. 
</P>
<P>
Scotland's Sandy Lyle shot 73 for a two-day total of 148; American Ken Green 
was at 149 after a 77; defending champion Fulton Allem of South Africa shot 75 
for a 151 total, and American Andy Bean continued to struggle with a 74 to 
follow his opening-day 81. 
</P>
<P>
Play on the back nine of the 7,665-yard course at the Sun City 
gambling-and-sports resort was halted for nearly an hour by a heavy 
thunderstorm. 
</P>
<P>
Frost, with 33s on both the front and back nine, came within one shot of the 
course record held jointly by Seve Ballesteros of Spain and Fuzzy Zoeller. 
</P>
<P>
Ballesteros won the Million Dollar event in 1983 and 1984. But he, like many 
other well-known players, decided to pass up the tournament as pressure mounted 
to support an international sports boycott protesting South Africa's racial 
segregation policies.

Chicago Bears owner Michael McCaskey says Mayor Richard M. Daley needs to make 
some moves on a new stadium and "get over the myth that it's impossible for the 
Bears to leave Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskey said Thursday that he is "out of time, out of rope and out of 
patience" in his efforts for a new tax-supported football stadium to replace 
Soldier Field along the city's lakefront. 
</P>
<P>
The team is under contract to play at Soldier Field until 1999, but McCaskey 
said the stadium is an "aging, decrepit structure whose useful life is nearly 
at an end." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskey said Republican Gov. James R. Thompson has been "very supportive" of a 
new stadium, but said Daley, a Democrat, is "hoping the problem will somehow go 
away."

Patrick McEnroe, John's younger brother, further polished his reputation as a 
doubles player today when he and partner Jim Grabb advanced to the semifinals 
of the Masters tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The two Americans completed their perfect record in the preliminary matches by 
defeating Australians Darren Cahill and Mark Kratzmann 7-6, 6-1, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Cahill and Kratzmann also qualified for the semifinals despite the loss, having 
won their previous two matches. The other two sets of semifinalists were to be 
determined tonight. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, at 23 seven years younger than his more famous brother, and Grabb won 
the French Open title in July on their way to earning more than $183,000 this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The way they beat defending champions Jim Pugh and Rick Leach in their first 
match of the Masters tournament, and then crushed Pete Sampras and Jim Courier 
to reach the semifinals, showed doubles teamwork at its best.

NFL FINDS NO PROOF OF BOUNTIES ON COWBOYS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The NFL said today it has no proof that bounties were placed on Dallas Cowboy 
players by the Philadelphia Eagles and has no evidence there was intent to 
cause deliberate injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The league issued a two-paragraph statement saying its findings were based on 
an investigation by Commissioner Paul Tagliabue following charges that surfaced 
after the Eagles played the Cowboys on Thanksgiving Day. 
</P>
<P>
"Under no circumstances does the league condone placing 'bounties' on an 
opposing player," the league said. "Nor does the league condone any deliberate 
action taken to injure another player. If any such conduct is proven by either 
direct or indirect evidence, the sanctions will be severe." 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Cowboys had no immediate comment today. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jimmy Johnson had predicted earlier in the week, however, that the NFL 
office would not do anything about the charges because it would be too 
difficult to prove it was a deliberate act. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy has simmered since Johnson charged that Coach Buddy Ryan 
offered bounties to some Eagles players to knock Dallas kicker Luis Zendejas 
and quarterback Troy Aikman out of the Nov. 23 game, which Philadelphia won 
27-0. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan called the charges ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
Bounty wars heated up again in recent days when Zendejas, cut earlier this 
season by the Eagles, said he has a tape recording of Eagles' special teams 
Coach Al Roberts pleading with him not to tell the NFL that he warned Zendejas 
that there would be attempts to knock him out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles and the Cowboys play again Sunday, this time in Philadelphia.

'THE GAME' LAST SHOT FOR NAVY SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP SPORTS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Bob Weissenfels and James Bradley and almost every other senior at Navy, 
this is it. 
</P>
<P>
It's the last chance to beat Army. It's the last chance to avenge three 
straight losses. It's the last chance to win The Game that is everything at the 
Naval Academy and West Point. 
</P>
<P>
"There is one game on the line right now," said Weissenfels, Navy's free safety 
and co-captain. "This is the most important one, especially for the seniors, 
since we haven't won. Not to beat Army would be very disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
The Cadets (6-4) appear to have the statistical and talent advantages over Navy 
(2-8), which has lost four in a row. But that will be forgotten when the teams 
meet at Giants Stadium on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, a halfback and co-captain, has spent all season getting ready for this 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say to my kids or my grandkids, 'Well, son, I went to the 
Naval Academy and we never beat Army,' " Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Beating Army would also help make up for three straight losing seasons under 
Coach Elliot Uzelac, who was hospitalized last month for testing of an internal 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a disappointing record, beating Army takes everything out of the 
way," Weissenfels said. "Years down the road, when people say how did you do, 
we could say we beat Army and that makes everything OK." 
</P>
<P>
The game will have the added attraction of Army halfback Mike Mayweather, a 
junior, looking to break the Cadets' single-season and career rushing records. 
He needs 56 yards to break Doug Black's single-season mark of 1,148 yards, set 
in 1984, and 81 yards to snap Glenn Davis' career mark of 2,957 yards, set in 
1943-46. 
</P>
<P>
Mayweather was expected to break the mark in Army's previous game, against 
Colgate, but he suffered a groin injury and left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, Army has given up an average of 19.3 points per game, compared to 
Navy's 25.5. The Cadets are averaging nearly 30 points per game, while Navy has 
averaged only 12.6 points per game and been plagued by turnovers near the 
opposition's goal line. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is the greatest rivalry," Army Coach Jim Young said. "Nothing I 
know compares to it." 
</P>
<P>
Young also said Navy is better than its record. 
</P>
<P>
"They beat Boston College and Boston College beat us," Young said. "I think 
that says it all. It shows what they are capable of. All the recent contests 
have been very close, hard-fought games." 
</P>
<P>
This is the 90th meeting between the service academies. The Cadets evened the 
series at 41-41-7 last year with a 20-15 victory at Philadelphia, where the 
game will return next year. 
</P>
<P>
Giants Stadium is the 12th site to host the game and the first new one since 
the game was played in the Rose Bowl in 1983.
