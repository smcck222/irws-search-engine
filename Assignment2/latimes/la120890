TOP POLLUTERS MAY HAVE TO ASSESS CANCER RISK; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THE SUPERVISORS COULD REQUIRE COMPANIES WITH MORE THAN 25 TONS OF 
ANNUAL EMISSIONS TO DETERMINE THE CHANCES THOSE LIVING NEARBY MIGHT DEVELOP 
MALIGNANCIES.

Thirty of Ventura County's top toxic air polluters would have to study whether 
their emissions could cause cancer in nearby residents, under a new program to 
be considered by county supervisors on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
If the program is approved, companies on the county Air Pollution Control 
District's "high priority" list must inform the public whether the chance of 
contracting cancer is greater than one in a million if a person lives nearby 
for 70 years, said Karl E. Krause, manager of the air pollution district's 
engineering section. 
</P>
<P>
"People want to know if they are living near facilities with toxic air 
problems," Krause said. "I would not be surprised if half of those who do the 
assessments find the risk to nearby residents is greater than one in a 
million." 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison Co. officials said Friday that they are willing to 
perform the studies, estimated to cost $25,000 to $75,000, for each of the 
utility's two power plants near Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
But Edison officials cautioned that making the high priority list does not 
automatically mean that the electricity plants pose health risks to neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"The only source of contaminants in power plants is when we burn oil, and then 
it is only trace contaminants that are emitted," said Michael Hertel, manager 
of environmental affairs for Edison. "And since we're on gas most of the time, 
we would not anticipate any kind of appreciable health risk at all." 
</P>
<P>
Krause said that Edison will be asked to perform the studies because its power 
plants emit hexavalent chromium, a known carcinogen. 
</P>
<P>
The new program is designed to bring Ventura County into compliance with the 
state Air Toxics Hot Spots Information and Assessment Act of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
That law requires air pollution control districts to make an inventory of the 
sources of more than 400 contaminants released into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Companies that emit more than 25 tons a year of toxic pollutants were required 
to submit their emission lists earlier this year. The results of that inventory 
produced a list of 40 pollution sources in Ventura County, including the two 
Edison plants, 20 oil field pumping stations, five manufacturing companies and 
two defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Of the top 40, Krause estimates that 30 will be required to perform the health 
risk studies, including Edison, several of the oil companies and Reichhold 
Chemicals Inc. of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
In a twist to the state law, Camarillo's 3M plant may not have to perform a 
health risk assessment, even though it has been on the top of the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency's list of toxic polluters for two years, Krause 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The 3M plant emits methyl ethyl ketone fumes, which can cause birth defects and 
central nervous system damage, but not cancer. The chemical was therefore left 
off the state's list, which focuses on carcinogens, Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Fahnoe, plant manager at Reichhold Chemicals Inc. on Arcturus Avenue in 
Oxnard, said his company expects to spend $100,000 for the health risk study. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which produces polyester resin for use in fiberglass products such 
as spas and bathtubs, emits fumes of the solvent methylene chloride, a known 
cancer-causing chemical. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably appropriate for us to do this study," he said. "This is one way 
to quantify whether we're a good neighbor or a bad neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
Texaco Inc. expects to spend up to $180,000 to assess health risks at its three 
facilities on the top-40 list, said company spokeswoman Sharon Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"But those are the kinds of dollars we like to spend," she said. "We want to do 
whatever we have to, to be safe." She said the closest house or business is 
half a mile away from the oil field operations. 
</P>
<P>
Distance from neighborhoods and other businesses is one of the factors 
officials consider when they decide which companies must perform the health 
risk studies. Officials also consider the properties of the chemicals emitted 
and their potential to harm people who breathe them. 
</P>
<P>
Companies that release 10 to 25 tons per year of toxic emissions will be 
required next year to submit their lists. Companies that produce less than 10 
tons a year will follow in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, companies have no further obligation after they disclose public 
health risks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to the politicians to decide what to do after that," Krause said.

</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: BEFORE REVIVING A $500-MILLION FUNDING MEASURE, A COMMISSION 
WANTS TO EXAMINE WHY VOTERS DEFEATED IT NOV. 6. 
</P>

<P>
The Ventura County Transportation Commission said Friday it will consider next 
month whether to resubmit a ballot-measure proposal that would raise the county 
sales tax a half-cent to pay for $500 million in transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a recommendation from its staff that it begin working on another sales 
tax proposal, the commission said it wanted more time to examine why voters 
last month overwhelmingly rejected Measure A. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not coming to a halt," Transportation Chairwoman Susan Lacey said of the 
commission's decision to wait a month before deciding whether to pursue another 
ballot measure. "We're just marching forward a little bit slower." 
</P>
<P>
In a report presented to the commission Friday, Ginger Gherardi, the board's 
executive director, recommended that the sales tax measure be revised and that 
work begin as soon as possible on placing it on the ballot next November. She 
said the sooner work could begin on drafting a new ballot proposal, the easier 
it would be to coordinate a campaign to support it. 
</P>
<P>
In her report, Gherardi outlined several reasons why the sales tax measure was 
defeated in the Nov. 6 election and how some of those problems might be 
corrected. 
</P>
<P>
One problem was that transportation officials did not start working on the 
ballot measure until June, she said. That was because they were waiting to see 
if voters would approve Proposition 111, which raised gasoline and diesel taxes 
to help pay for statewide transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem was that the language used in the ballot statement did not 
specify what projects would be funded by the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Gherardi said proponents of the measure were unable to wage a full-blown 
campaign because of financial problems related to the downturn in the economy. 
The fact that there were 28 statewide propositions competing for voter-approved 
funding also did not help their cause. 
</P>
<P>
"There were problems outside of our control," such as the Middle East crisis 
and state budget shortfalls, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The director restated the county's needs for additional funding for various 
freeway improvements and other roadway projects. She said the county needs 
operating funds for commuter rail service that would link Simi Valley and 
Moorpark with Los Angeles at the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed in the November ballot measure, the half-cent sales tax would 
enable the county to claim $130 million in state highway money and raise 
another $500 million over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the county's longstanding projects include widening California 126 and 
the Saticoy Bridge and completion of a connector road between the Simi Valley 
and Moorpark freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Gherardi reminded the commission that it should act quickly because the cost of 
these and other county transportation projects is only going to increase. The 
cost of the Saticoy Bridge project already has jumped from $3 million to $12 
million because of rising real estate prices, California Department of 
Transportation officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But Commissioners Maggie Erikson and Frank Schillo cautioned colleagues on the 
panel about being to quick to pursue another sales tax measure. 
</P>
<P>
"If it is important to this county, and I believe it is, that we have good 
transportation then let's take some time at this commission to talk about what 
went wrong" with the initial sales tax measure, Erikson said. 
</P>
<P>
"For this commission to take action that says, 'Well, the voters voted us down, 
but we think they were wrong, and so we're going to put it back on the ballot 
again' . . . I'm not ready to say that." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Fred Robinson, who headed a citizens committee that campaigned on behalf 
of the sales tax measure, told the board that his committee is still intact and 
ready to begin campaigning for another ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to go away," Robinson said. "I've got warmed up to the fight 
and we're ready for another go at this. With your help I know we can make it 
successful."

3 HOUSE PLANS OKD AT OXNARD SHORES 
</P>

<P>
The Oxnard Planning Commission approved plans Thursday for three houses to be 
built in an oceanfront subdivision that has not been built on for 18 years 
because of a dispute over beach erosion that pitted property owners against 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
The longstanding dispute over the Oxnard Shores was settled in 1988, resolving 
10 lawsuits designed to force city and state officials to allow development on 
the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
In the past five months, the city has granted nine other building permits for 
Oxnard Shores. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the commission voted 5 to 1, with one commissioner abstaining, to 
give one coastal development permit each to Lycon Properties Inc. of Sherman 
Oaks, Roy Milbrandt of Ventura and Douglas W. Burdge of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Lycon plans to build a two-story, 4,831-square-foot house on pilings on Marine 
Way and Amalfi Way. Milbrandt plans to build a two-story, 6,200-square-foot 
house on Mandalay Beach Road near Breakwater Way. Burdge plans to build a 
three-story, 4,895-square-foot house on the corner of Mandalay Beach Road and 
Reef Way. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Selma Dressler, who has voiced concern about other projects at 
Oxnard Shores, abstained from the vote, saying the structures will form a "wall 
of homes" to block the view of the ocean. She said beach erosion will also make 
it unsafe to live in a house built on pilings. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Stella Spray agreed. "Any home built on sand will not stand," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's decision can be appealed to the City Council and to the State 
Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement, lot owners gave up more than 1,400 feet of property along 
the beach for two public parks and agreed to grant public beach access. In 
return, they were allowed the right to exceed current density restrictions.

<P>
Three men were arrested Friday after CHP officers discovered three loaded, 
sawed-off shotguns in their truck during a routine traffic stop, which ended in 
an altercation, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Westley Williams, 25, of Nipomo was arrested on suspicion of battery on a 
police officer and possession of concealed weapons in a vehicle, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Driver David Grose, 30, of Canoga Park was arrested on suspicion of possession 
of a controlled substance and possession of a concealed weapon in a vehicle, 
CHP officers said. Grose was being held in the Ventura County Jail in lieu of 
$5,000 bail, a jail spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Reed, 40, of Mojave was arrested on suspicion of being an ex-felon in 
possession of firearms and outstanding warrants, officials said. Reed was being 
held in lieu of $25,500 bail, a jail spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests occurred about 3:30 a.m. after two officers noticed a Ford pickup 
without lights southbound on the Ventura Freeway near the Telephone Road 
off-ramp in Ventura, CHP Officer Jim Utter said. 
</P>
<P>
During the traffic stop, all three men got out of their truck. Reed looked 
under the hood, apparently in an effort to figure out why the lights were not 
working, Utter said. Grose followed one officer to the patrol car to receive 
his citation, Utter said. 
</P>
<P>
The second officer noticed weapons under the seat of the truck and told 
Williams to step up on the curb. Instead, Williams struck him, Utter said. 
</P>
<P>
A struggle between Williams and the officer ensued. Williams suffered some head 
and rib injuries. He was taken to the Ventura County Medical Center for 
treatment and was later transferred to the jail, Utter said. The officers were 
not injured, Utter said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers discovered the guns, numerous knives and a small quantity of drugs, 
which are being analyzed, Utter said. CAROL WATSON

REVISED WATER PLAN IS MORE OPTIMISTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Casitas Municipal Water District has drafted revisions of a five-year water 
management plan that sparked controversy when it was adopted in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The board will take public comment on the revised Urban Water Management Plan 
through Dec. 19, when it will hold a public hearing on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 plan was attacked by environmentalists who said it was too vague, that 
it did not do enough to prevent a water shortage and that it gave the district 
too much power over smaller water agencies inside its boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The plan had predicted customer demands for water could outstrip the district's 
available supply before the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
The revised plan paints a rosier picture by showing a possible surplus of 
almost 5,000 acre-feet of water by 2005. The district serves the Ojai Valley 
and parts of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
The new document outlines many conservation measures the district has 
undertaken since the board declared a water-shortage emergency in April, such 
as requiring agricultural irrigation audits and low-flow plumbing fixtures in 
remodeled dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
More conservation efforts, higher water rates and imported water from the 
California Aqueduct are calculated to provide the surplus. THIA BELL

CITY WILL TEST NEW WARNING SIREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents near the Ventura Harbor, the Ventura Keys and Pierpont Bay will hear 
the blare of a siren next week as the city of Ventura tests the latest addition 
to its emergency warning system. The siren, installed last month on Harbor 
Boulevard, is one of 10 that the city uses to notify residents of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
The city has relied on sirens for several decades, using earlier versions 
during World War II, said Barry Simmons, information officer for the city's 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
If the sirens go off during an actual disaster, residents should tune their 
radios to emergency broadcasting stations for information, Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons said the area is in particular need of a warning system because of its 
location. An earthquake along an ocean fault line could produce a wave powerful 
enough to travel a mile inland, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Attached to poles 20 to 30 feet off the ground, the sirens are powered by 
electrical motors and operated by radio control. They are regularly tested the 
first Friday of each month at 10 a.m. But this month's testing of the Harbor 
Boulevard siren will be between 1 and 4 p.m. Monday. VIVIAN LOUIE

BILL WOULD REPEAL TAX-COLLECTION FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) said he and a Northern California 
assemblyman introduced companion bills this week to repeal a new law that 
allows county governments to charge school districts for collecting the 
schools' share of property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Hart said the Legislature made a mistake last summer by passing a budget 
agreement that shifted the financial burden from counties to school districts. 
</P>
<P>
The same law allows counties to charge cities every time their police officers 
book someone into county jail. That provision of the law has come under fire 
from state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita), who proposes overturning the 
booking fee. 
</P>
<P>
"This law pits local agency against local agency," said Assemblyman Ted Lempert 
(D-San Mateo), who joined with Hart in an attempt to exempt schools from the 
law. "Counties are now in a position to take up to $150 million in badly needed 
funds from our schools." 
</P>
<P>
When legislators passed the budget, they assumed Gov. George Deukmejian would 
give schools a full 4.76% cost-of-living raise, Hart said. Instead, the 
governor cut the cost-of-living adjustment to 3%. 
</P>
<P>
"Legislators made a mistake in believing that Gov. Deukmejian would not cut 
education funds," Hart said. "But our schools can't afford to pay for our 
mistake." KENNETH R. WEISS

<P>
The president of California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks was one of 
five college presidents nationwide who has received grants of $100,000 from a 
private philanthropic foundation based in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
President Jerry H. Miller received one of the first Knight Foundation 
Presidential Discretionary Grants, given to leaders of small liberal arts 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
The money may be spent at Cal Lutheran at his discretion. 
</P>
<P>
Miller and other recipients were not aware that they were being considered for 
the award and each received checks on Monday, the day the announcements were 
made, said foundation spokeswoman Virginia Henke. 
</P>
<P>
"It came as quite a surprise," Miller said. "We are pleased beyond measure and 
see this as an acknowledgment of the progress that Cal Lutheran is making." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he is considering using the grant for faculty programs, including 
research; for student programs; and for applying for matching grants from other 
foundations. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran was chosen for its use of computers and other technology 
throughout its curriculum, especially in courses where they are not normally 
used, such as French, English, history and drama. 
</P>
<P>
The other recipients were Clark-Atlanta University in Atlanta and Johnson C. 
Smith University in Charlotte, N.C., both recognized for service to black 
students; Ohio Dominican College in Columbus, for addressing the needs of women 
and adults, and Sinte Gleska College in Rosebud, S.D., for service to Native 
American students and tribal education. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

14 ARRESTED IN STING OF ILLEGAL CONTRACTORS IN HIGH DESERT; 
</P>
<P>
PALMDALE: INVESTIGATORS FOR THE LICENSING BOARD POSED AS PROPERTY OWNERS. ANGRY 
LICENSED CONTRACTORS PROVIDED THE STATE WITH THEIR COMPETITORS' NAMES. 
</P>

<P>
Investigators for the Contractors State Licensing Board conducting an 
undercover "sting" lured 14 masons and landscapers to a house in Palmdale this 
week on the pretext of hiring them, then arrested them for working without a 
contractor's license. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators targeted workers whose names were provided by licensed 
contractors angry at being underbid by unlicensed competitors, said an official 
of the state licensing board. 
</P>
<P>
"They are tired of losing jobs to these individuals," said Dennis Bishop, 
supervising deputy of the board's unlicensed activity unit. "They operate on a 
little lower monetary level as far as their bids are concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The unit, formed in October, 1989, has conducted 15 similar undercover 
operations in the Southern California area this year, Bishop said. The 
operation in Palmdale netted the largest number of arrests in the unit's 
history, and was the first in the Antelope Valley, where the booming 
construction business attracts unlicensed contractors. 
</P>
<P>
In the Palmdale sting, investigators took names and phone numbers they received 
from irate licensed contractors in the area, and made 21 appointments over a 
three-day period, from Tuesday to Thursday, at a house borrowed for the 
operation. When a contractor arrived, one of the investigators posing as the 
owner described landscaping or masonry work he wanted done, and the contractor 
made a bid on the job. 
</P>
<P>
"We ask them for a contract, and they write it up," Bishop said. When the 
contractor was unable to provide a license number, he was placed under arrest 
by one of two members of the unit who are sworn peace officers. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the contractors provided false numbers, which the investigators easily 
identified by checking records in Sacramento by phone. 
</P>
<P>
Unlicensed contractors can work for less because they usually pay their 
employees in cash, and often do not pay taxes or have workers compensation 
insurance, Bishop said. The consumer may lose in the long run, he said, because 
the licensing board can make a contractor redo a shoddy job, but the only 
recourse against unlicensed contractors is to sue. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, because many unlicensed contractors have no workers compensation 
insurance, the homeowner becomes liable for injuries to the workers. 
</P>
<P>
Contracting industry spokesmen praised the board for the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
"The unlicensed people are part of the underground economy," said Mike Leeson, 
executive vice president of the American Building Contractors Assn., noting 
that they are not required to pay many of the fees or post the $5,000 bond 
licensed contractors must shoulder. "They're the scum of the earth." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that unlicensed people are bad people, because some of them really do 
nice work," said Dave Burwell, vice president of the High Desert Chapter of the 
California Landscaping Contractors Assn. But, he added, "most people that are 
involved in landscape scams do not have a license." 
</P>
<P>
The 14 arrested, who face fines of up to $1,000 and up to a year in jail, were 
released on their own recognizance and will be arraigned in Antelope Valley 
Municipal Court on Jan. 3 and 4.

BOYFRIEND, 22, TELLS COURT HE STRANGLED WESTLAKE WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 22-year-old murder suspect charged with the slaying of his Westlake 
girlfriend slumped at the witness stand Friday in Ventura County Superior 
Court, slapped the microphone down and confessed that he killed her. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Velasco testified that he killed Ellen Cleary, 37, of Westlake. But 
Velasco said he wanted to keep secret a confession he made to police the day of 
the slaying because he wanted to spare her family the details of her sex life, 
her substance abuse and her death. 
</P>
<P>
"What I did, I did, and I did it," Velasco said after taking the witness stand 
during a hearing that had been called to determine whether to keep earlier 
grand jury testimony sealed and whether to allow an earlier confession into 
evidence at trial. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco, of Van Nuys, slit Cleary's throat with a steak knife, strangled her, 
then knotted plastic bags over her head to asphyxiate her in her residence on 
Oct. 4, according to the grand jury records which were ordered unsealed Friday 
by Judge Steven Z. Perren. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco told investigators he killed Cleary because "he felt that she was 
tragic, her life was tragic, and he wished to send her to heaven," Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Carol J. Nelson said Friday in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco testified that he thought the Oct. 4 interview with police would be 
confidential and would not have talked to them in such detail had he known he 
was being videotaped. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really nobody's business except Ellen's business," Velasco testified. 
"I felt like I was talking behind her back, bad about her." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender William McGuffey argued that the Oct. 4 confession in a 
sheriff's interview room violated Velasco's rights against self-incrimination 
because he did not know detectives were videotaping it. 
</P>
<P>
But Detective Sgt. Thomas Odle testified that he read Velasco his rights 
several times, although he did not tell him the video camera in the room was 
running during the confession. 
</P>
<P>
Perren refused to throw out the confession and unsealed the grand jury 
transcript, which outlines the grim scene detectives found in Cleary's 
condominium a few hours after Velasco turned himself 
</P>
<P>
in. Detective Richard Gatling told the grand jury that the living room floor 
was spattered with blood. A clean steak knife was found sticking in the living 
room wall, and an identical, bloodied knife was found in the bathroom next to 
the tub, according to the grand jury transcript. 
</P>
<P>
Cleary's nude body floated in the tub, her head almost completely submerged and 
covered with three white plastic bags, which were secured by two more bags 
knotted around her neck, Gatling told the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco told investigators he went to Cleary's house that morning and found her 
engaged in a sexual act with Dr. Donald Alan Lee, a Simi Valley cardiologist, 
Nelson said in a court document. Velasco had just found a job with a small 
courier service and wanted to share the good news with Cleary, his lover of 
several years, who was unemployed and living on a trust fund, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco told investigators that Cleary was an alcoholic and had been taking 
lithium carbonate pills which Lee supplied to her, Nelson said. Lithium 
carbonate is a chemical used to moderate mood swings in manic-depressive 
people, although Cleary was not manic-depressive, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said in a brief telephone interview Friday, "I don't talk about Mrs. Cleary 
right now. Sorry. Bye-bye," and hung up. Nelson said she does not know if she 
will investigate Velasco's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
In recounting the events leading to the fatal stabbing, according to Nelson, 
Velasco told investigators that Lee had quietly left Cleary's condominium after 
Velasco arrived. Velasco said that he and Cleary ate the lunch of salmon with 
green peppercorns which she had planned to eat with the doctor, and then had 
sex, according to the grand jury transcript. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco told investigators that as Cleary lay nude and face-down on the floor 
afterward, he came up behind her with a steak knife and cut her throat, trying 
to find her jugular vein. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said in her closing statement to the grand jury that Velasco then 
"manually strangled her, in his words, 'forever,' " and tied the plastic bags 
over her head to ensure her death. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco then called a friend at Independence High School in Van Nuys, drove to 
meet her in the school and told her he had killed Cleary, the transcript said. 
School officials summoned police and took Velasco into custody. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco is being held in lieu of $250,000 bail. A hearing for pretrial motions 
is scheduled for March 15, 1991.

GROWTH OUTPACES STATE FUNDING 
</P>

<P>
The Santa Clarita Community College District, with only one campus -- College 
of the Canyons in Valencia -- is the fastest-growing community college district 
in the state for the third consecutive year, according to the state Department 
of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
And, like many other community colleges in fast-growing areas, College of the 
Canyons does not have enough funding to keep pace with its growth. 
</P>
<P>
The college's average daily attendance (ADA) is up more than 10% from last 
year, said Dianne Van Hook, district superintendent-president, but the district 
is unlikely to receive state funds to cover the increase. 
</P>
<P>
The average daily attendance funding the college receives from the state is 
based on growth projections, in this year's case, 8.5%. This predetermined 
amount, however, isn't adequate for the college's actual student attendance, 
which means the college is losing funding, Van Hook said. 
</P>
<P>
The total loss in ADA funding to the college from the 1987-88 school year 
through 1990-91 has been more than $6.3 million, Van Hook said. Unfunded ADA 
rose from zero in the 1986-87 school year to 14% in 1987-88 and continues to 
increase, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987-88, enrollment grew by about 16%. The 1988-89 growth rate was 
approximately 12%. 
</P>
<P>
The college's Master Facility Plan predicts the growth rate will continue at 
well above 10%. District enrollment projections range from 16,500 to 39,000 by 
2020. Fall enrollment was 5,668 in 1989 and 6,104 in 1990, Van Hook said. JACI

DISPUTE SENDS PLAY OFF CAMPUS

The first student-produced play at College of the Canyons is being staged off 
campus because students did not want to pay newly imposed fees for use of 
college facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The play, "Feiffer's People," concludes a three-day run tonight at Saugus High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Student government representatives moved it there to avoid fees the college 
began charging student organizations for use of campus buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The student government is paying $300 to use the high school, about $50 more 
than the college would have charged. The issue is one of principle, students 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to accept the price or set a precedent to pay to use our own 
facilities," student senator A.J. Jothikumar said. "We ignored the issue and 
said we'd just take the play elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
College administrators decided to impose rental fees after budget estimates 
last summer showed a $20,000 deficit for use of campus facilities, said John 
Drislane, dean of community and personnel services for the school. Student 
events cost the college money because campus employees provide labor to set up 
stages, arrange seating and clean up afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Students and administrators recently worked out an arrangement they hope will 
avoid such disagreements in the future. Under it, student organizations can use 
campus facilities a specified number of times for free. Student government, for 
example, can hold two major events in the student cafeteria every three months.

ARTISTS PLAN TO TURN RAIL STOPS INTO TRANSIT GALLERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a new "art gallery" planned for the South Bay, an expansive museum 
stretching from El Segundo to Lennox to Inglewood. It also will double as a 
mass transit system. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission is hiring artists to create 
public art projects for the Metro Rail stations under construction. The 
commission is also seeking area residents to volunteer as advisers. 
</P>
<P>
"We all get caught up in a 9-to-5 existence, and we sometimes don't smell the 
roses," said Charles Dickson, a sculptor from Compton who is designing a 
station in El Segundo. "The stations to me are like tremendous flowers." 
</P>
<P>
Art-for-Rail-Transit Administrator Jessica Cusick said the program will produce 
more than murals or paintings on barren station walls. She made it clear that 
the type of art sought could include sound or lights, for example. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do is build a new set of cultural landmarks for Los 
Angeles," she said. ". . . Without trying to sound too grandiose, what we might 
end up with is a countywide museum." 
</P>
<P>
In some instances, the artists will work with the architects to incorporate the 
art into the station design. At the four stations planned for El Segundo, which 
will be used heavily by commuters, the artists have come up with creations 
whose subjects will not be instantly obvious, even to repeat users. 
</P>
<P>
The Douglas Street station, for instance, will feature an abstract pattern 
based on a map of the area with constellations superimposed. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers using the station at Aviation Boulevard and Imperial Highway will 
trigger a sound recorded in outer space -- Cusick said it is reminiscent of 
whale "songs" -- by stepping on a particular unmarked area of the station 
floor. A rush of commuters, triggering many of these sounds, is expected to 
produce a sort of extraterrestrial symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Another El Segundo station, the one designed by Dickson, will have a butterfly 
theme in honor of the endangered El Segundo blue butterfly. A huge sculpture 
will show a metamorphosing butterfly juxtaposed with an airplane under 
production. The station will be at Nash Street and Mariposa Avenue. (Mariposa 
is the Spanish word for butterfly.) 
</P>
<P>
"I think every artist longs for this opportunity," Dickson said. "The freeways 
of today are very much like the pyramids of yesterday. This is giving me a 
feeling of longevity and great accomplishment. I can't wait to go up my 
elevator . . . to see the butterflies." 
</P>
<P>
There will be 14 stations on the Green Line, which will run along the median of 
the Century Freeway from Norwalk to Los Angeles International Airport. Seven of 
the stops will be in the South Bay. Although the new freeway will end at LAX, 
the Green Line, scheduled to open in 1994, will run on an elevated guideway 
through El Segundo to the northern boundary of Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the El Segundo stops, other South Bay stations will be in 
Lennox, and one each on the Hawthorne-Redondo Beach line and the 
Hawthorne-Inglewood line. 
</P>
<P>
The other three artists for the El Segundo stations will be Daniel Martinez, 
Renee Petropolos and Richard Turner. Carl Cheng will do the Hawthorne-Redondo 
Beach station.

MAKE LIFE WORTH LIVING;

SUICIDE: THE KEVORKIAN TRIAL MAY REVIVE THE SPECTER THAT THE DISABLED HAVE NO 
REASON TO LIVE. BUT SOCIETY'S LACK OF SUPPORT IS WHAT CAUSES THEIR DESPAIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOLTE, Bolte is a Los Angeles writer who uses a wheelchair as a result 
of polio when he was an infant. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decision by Michigan prosecutors to file first-degree murder charges 
against Dr. Jack Kevorkian -- the proud inventor of a machine that makes 
suicide push-button easy -- revives a debate that we severely disabled people 
both welcome and dread. Mos of us welcome the filing of charges, yet dread that 
the trial will provide a platform for the hidden prejudices against disabled 
people -- and end with a judicial imprimatur for killing us. 
</P>
<P>
Kevorkian is not being tried for inventing the death machine, but for applying 
it. He hooked up a middle-aged woman, Janet Adkins, who had become convinced 
that she had Alzheimer's disease. Though she had consulted only one doctor 
before asking Kevorkian to connect her to his invention, he agreed to do it 
after spending part of an evening over dinner with her. 
</P>
<P>
The killing machine is a copy of a machine used in some state execution 
chambers, except that the victim pushes the button rather than a prison 
official. 
</P>
<P>
My dread concerning Kevorkian's trial is that both the prosecution and the 
defense will agree on assumptions about the lives of disabled people, as seen 
by people who have never had a severe disability. The undisabled too often 
assume that people would rather die than have a life-altering disability. 
</P>
<P>
Disabled people like me know that there is nothing natural about the desire to 
die. We know, also, that two things drive us to death. One is fear of the 
unknown. What will happen to me now that I am disabled? The other is not being 
able to get the material and psychological support necessary to sustain our 
lives. Who will feed me now that I can't feed myself? How can I bear being 
dependent on others for things I used to do for myself? These are nearly the 
same as the factors that drive the so-called able-bodied to attempt suicide. 
</P>
<P>
A decade and a half ago I lost my job. Soon I lost my wife in divorce, my home, 
and, in a very real way, my children. I was well-qualified for other jobs but I 
was 45, used a wheelchair and had hypertension acquired during my tenure as a 
hospital administrator. It would have been rough enough at 45 to find a good 
job, but add the other factors and I was in trouble. Hundreds of resumes got me 
only a few interviews and no jobs. I felt (as it turned out, accurately), that 
my management career was finished. I had, without realizing it, entered a deep 
depression. If Kevorkian had been around, I might not be writing today. Instead 
I called my HMO about a physical problem and something I said got me an 
appointment with a psychiatric social worker the next morning. Fortunately, she 
did not assume that someone severely disabled should want to die, and my HMO 
didn't have a killing machine. 
</P>
<P>
For some reason, anyone in a bed or connected to assistive machines loses 
humanity and is a target for "right to die with dignity" philosophies. Why not 
a right to live with dignity? Dying with dignity hardly lasts long enough to 
enjoy, though it is cheaper. I worry a lot because I now use a power wheelchair 
and an assistive breathing machine at night. Does that mean that I should be 
urged to die, since I can't live without life-sustaining machinery, a standard 
I often hear used to justify the deaths of fellow disabled people? 
</P>
<P>
When the trial begins, and all of the able-bodied ethicists, doctors and 
lawyers begin discussing the right to die again on "Nightline" and 
"MacNeil/Lehrer," able-bodied people should ask themselves whether they are 
sure they would want to die, and why, if they became severely disabled. I 
suggest that many would realize that the impulse comes from fear of being 
pauperized, of not getting necessary help, of being in the way, a burden, 
unloved, isolated and rejected -- which have nothing to do with the disability 
itself and everything to do with the response of society to the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, no one wants to be disabled. And it is not true that life is always 
worth living. There are cases of extreme, unrelievable pain, of total lack of 
consciousness near death, that may make understandable individual acts 
unendorsed by society. But even in extreme cases we should be careful to 
question alleged suffering. 
</P>
<P>
Are those who support Kevorkian sympathetic to the plight of a 54-year-old 
woman who, though still able, feared that she might become disabled, or are 
they concerned about their own inconvenience and expense if, say, a parent got 
Alzheimer's disease? As a society, have we decided that we can't afford to care 
for the helpless? Have we decided that medical progress has gone too far in 
preserving life and now should be used to terminate life? But what is the 
meaning of progress, if it is not about saving lives and doing our damndest to 
make these lives worth living?

EX-JOINT CHIEFS ON GULF CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial ("Bush Sends a Clear Signal to Baghdad," Dec. 1) posed the 
question as to how Hussein can "negotiate a face-saving retreat from Kuwait and 
avoid war." This is an equally vexing question for the Bush Administration, 
which, like Hussein, has painted itself in a corner by insisting on complete 
withdrawal before negotiations can begin. 
</P>
<P>
What may be a face-saving retreat for both sides is this: Hussein withdraws all 
his troops from Kuwait and allows the restoration of the Kuwait government, as 
the U.N. resolutions demand. In exchange, Bush and the Security Council will 
agree to an international conference to settle all issues in the Middle East, 
including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the interim, a U.N. peacekeeping 
force would replace the U.S. armed forces in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
If such a settlement could be negotiated, each side could claim victory. War 
would be avoided.

FREQUENT-FLIER BUSH COMPLETES VITAL LATIN TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As President Bush completes the latest of his foreign trips, a week-long swing 
through five South American nations, questions are being raised in this country 
about whether it was wise or even useful. 
</P>
<P>
Correspondents who cover the White House have begun reporting that constant 
travel seems to be taking a physical toll on the 66-year-old Bush. The last 
couple of months -- with the Persian Gulf crisis as the constant backdrop to 
everything Bush does -- have been especially punishing. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the case can be made that with an unpredictable crisis playing itself 
out -- especially one that could put the United States in its biggest shooting 
war in a generation -- the President should wander no further from the Oval 
Office than the Rose Garden. But, in fairness, the White House staff can make a 
good argument that each of Bush's recent sojourns served a valid purpose. 
</P>
<P>
His November trip to Europe allowed Bush to join other world leaders at the 
signing of security agreements that marked the end of the Cold War, certainly 
an historic event. And who can question the value of pressing the flesh and 
showing support to American soldiers in the field, as he did on Thanksgiving 
Day. And Mexico, while usually ignored by most U.S. citizens, is not just a 
recurring foreign policy issue but -- with the Soviet Union self-absorbed -- 
now arguably our most important foreign policy challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Which leaves only the trip to South America to be questioned. And, let's face 
it, Latin America, in general, has never been a priority for most folks in 
Washington, be they pundits, politicians or other policy-makers. So what's 
really being asked, we suspect, is whether five days in Brazil, Uruguay, 
Argentina, Chile and Venezuela were worth the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Yes they were. Except for Chile, the nations visited by Bush are not as far 
along as Mexico in moving toward the open economies and free-trade policies 
that Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III so ardently believe in -- 
but they are heading in that direction. Anything this country can do to help 
them along is a matter of enlightened self-interest. At least in the short 
term, the world seems to be realigning itself into trading blocs, with Europe 
and East Asia poised to further challenge the United States for economic 
supremacy in the 1990s. If that happens, our neighbors in the Western 
Hemisphere may just prove our most reliable and eager trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
That is why it's vital for Washington to show Latin America that it is 
important, even if the message is largely symbolic for now. Symbolism counts 
for a lot in diplomacy. And, for all the gringo-bashing that goes on south of 
the border, the United States counts for a lot in Latin America. Most 
Argentines can tell you that the last American President to visit their nation 
was Dwight Eisenhower in 1958. How many of us remember that? We're willing to 
bet that Latin Americans will remember Bush's trip, too, long after this 
country has forgotten it. That'll be good for the United States -- and to the 
President's credit.

STRAWBERRY STATEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The public has grown accustomed to astronomical baseball salaries, but it has 
never seen anything like the dizzying escalation of recent days. The San 
Francisco Giants have shelled out $33 million for three free agents, the Boston 
Red Sox are paying more than $6 million to a pitcher who lost 18 games last 
year, and some journeymen have become millionaires. 
</P>
<P>
Some of baseball's stronger franchises can play mega-bucks for now, but others 
have built in an expectation of future winning that cannot possibly be matched 
by reality. Teams eternally wait until next year and spend freely for it, but 
not all can be financial winners, and there will be only one champion come next 
October. For those that don't perform or draw well, or that languish in weak TV 
markets, ticket prices inevitably go up to meet the payroll. The role of TV 
revenue is a question mark: CBS is asking for money back after a disappointing 
year, and the move to pay channels risks disenfranchising fans who can't pay. 
</P>
<P>
One measure of how expensive things have become is that Mark Langston, the 
Angel's $16-million pitcher, this year has fallen to 14th on the Associated 
Press' list of highest-paid players (Darryl Strawberry, the new Dodger, is 
second.) But the Angels, the soul of prudence in the winter meetings' spending 
spree, already have announced higher ticket and parking prices. 
</P>
<P>
All this makes us uneasy. For baseball's long-term future, you have to wonder 
if down the road there won't be an inverse relationship between player salaries 
and fan access. That would be sad, indeed.

TRAUMA CARE AT COUNTY-USC MEDICAL CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article (Nov. 19) regarding trauma care at Los Angeles County-USC Medical 
Center seriously misrepresents the situation at this facility. It is quite 
apparent that The Times took the American College of Surgeons' (ACS) survey 
report as fact and has simply provided a forum for its dissemination to a 
readership that cannot possibly be expected to evaluate the legitimacy of that 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of two surgeons from the ACS as the only surveyors to visit 
County-USC was inappropriate from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
The contention that emergency physicians are not qualified to evaluate and 
initially manage trauma patients is simply a biased point of view. At 
County-USC our system has evolved because of the volume of trauma patients and 
other factors unique to this institution. What can be shown is that patients do 
very well in our center in terms of outcome. What has not been shown is that 
patients do better in the centers with systems of trauma care espoused by the 
ACS. If there are preventable deaths (few would deny that they occur 
inadvertently), it is because our people (emergency physicians, surgeons and 
nurses) are human, and life being a fragile entity, cannot be pushed beyond 
certain limits. To purport that any of these people would ever put a "turf" 
issue before the welfare of the patient is blatantly irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
Trauma centers throughout Los Angeles County and across the country are 
closing, and one of the major reasons is that the ACS's requirement for a 
surgeon to meet every trauma patient has been found to be unnecessary and 
prohibitively costly. There must logically be a screen of patients by someone 
qualified to make such a screen as well as to begin lifesaving resuscitation 
when indicated. The emergency physician is uniquely qualified to do this and 
that is exactly how the County-USC system operates. Instead of attacking it 
because it does not fit ACS dogma, perhaps it should be considered as the 
prototype of a workable national concept in trauma care.

TRAUMA CARE AT COUNTY-USC MEDICAL CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apart from containing several errors, the report ignores some important facts. 
Firstly, the Department of Emergency Medicine provides attending staff coverage 
24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
The attending emergency physician is board certified with up to 15 years 
experience in resuscitation. Since this physician is ultimately responsible for 
all medical care delivered in the Emergency Department and is the most 
experienced physician on scene, he has to have the authority to determine the 
initial treatment of emergency cases. The surgical care is determined by the 
most senior surgery resident on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the report suggests that "turf battles" have resulted in poor patient 
outcomes. In the six years I have spent in the medical center, I can honestly 
say that I have never seen or heard of any patient dying in the Emergency 
Department because of a "turf battle." 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, I think it is important to point out that the majority of trauma 
patients in the U.S. are not initially treated in "trauma centers." In fact 
most states do not have specifically designated trauma centers. Patients are 
stabilized initially by emergency physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Although emergency medicine is a relatively new medical specialty, residency 
training programs have been in existence for almost 20 years and board 
certification has existed for 10 years (not one year as stated in the article). 
To scrap a system which works well on the basis of the ACS surveyor's report 
would be unjust.

CRANSTON AND LINCOLN S&amp;L DEBACLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was saddened when I read your article about an elderly man taking his life 
over the Lincoln S&amp;L debacle. So many in this great nation have been 
impacted by the raping and pilfering of our nation's banks over the last 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that our country has slid from its stature. We idolize the power 
and wealth of such figures as Donald Trump, Michael Milken, Charles Keating and 
Oliver North. Yet not long ago these men would have been hung, not as heroes, 
but as the villains and criminals they are. These men produce nothing and suck 
the very vitality from the average American person today. Our government is no 
better. Today, instead of a leader, we elected an indecisive follower. 
</P>
<P>
I am further saddened that the baby-boom generation has no leaders in its fold. 
Yet we have the insurmountable task of bringing America from the trillions of 
dollars in debt that recent administrations have bequeathed to us. I see a 
rough road ahead, and no one who is capable of rallying this nation back to its 
roots. May God help us.

CRANSTON AND LINCOLN S&amp;L DEBACLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two news items, separated by a week in time and by 3,000 miles in distance, 
really belong together in the minds of readers and observers. 
</P>
<P>
From Washington, it was announced that Sen. Alan Cranston holds nearly $565,000 
in his campaign coffers, and that while he has not decided what to do with the 
money, he may use it for his legal defense on ethics charges. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, another news story from Burbank reported that an 89-year-old man, 
despondent over losing $200,000 in savings when American Continental Corp. 
(Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan) went bankrupt, committed suicide with a straight 
razor (Metro, Nov. 29). The man in Burbank was reportedly extremely distraught 
over his loss. 
</P>
<P>
Without jeopardizing Cranston's legal defense case, the senator should 
seriously consider placing his leftover campaign funds in a special account to 
be used to help redeem the losses of investors who trusted the company that the 
senator apparently helped over the years. Such an action, symbolic in dimension 
and scope, would help to restore some of the senator's lost integrity.

REBUTTING MILLI VANILLI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Milli Vanilli's attack on my competence and integrity as a journalist requires 
rebuttal ("We Sold Our Souls to the Devil,' Nov. 21). I am the Time magazine 
reporter mentioned in your article to whom Milli Vanilli said, in an interview 
last February, "We are musically more talented than any Bob Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
Musically we are more talented than a Paul McCartney." After they said this, I 
gave them a chance to explain or retract it by asking, "What do you mean by 
that exactly?" They answered, "Creative. To be able to produce." 
</P>
<P>
The context was their description of their music as the "modern rock and roll." 
In the same context they said to me, "(We are) the new modern rock and roller. 
I'm the new Elvis. I'm the new Roy Orbison at this time. I'm the new Beatles. . 
. ." At the duo's insistence, Todd Headlee, Milli Vanilli's ex-manager, was 
present during the interview, ostensibly to protect them from just such 
opinions and their "poor grasp of the language." Headlee never interrupted to 
modify or dilute these remarks. 
</P>
<P>
The interview is on tape. The quotes are as I have presented them. And there 
are others, including, "It's more difficult to sing a song like Milli Vanilli 
than a Beatles song." Really, Rob and Fab, how would you know?

LEARNING THE LESSONS OF IRAN-CONTRA CONSPIRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I can't share Rosenberg's high opinion of Moyers' documentary. While I admire 
much about Moyers, he is not a man without political bias -- and a program of 
this kind should have none. 
</P>
<P>
Moyers might have mentioned the Soviet interference in the politics of Central 
America that brought about the support for the Contras and, more important, he 
might have touched upon the fact that President Reagan was not dealing directly 
with terrorists. The hostages were not captured or held by Iranians. 
</P>
<P>
That Iran had influence is something else. But it is these "something else" 
factors in the complex Iran-Contra affair that makes it almost impossible to 
get it clearly in focus -- and Moyers' interpretation was not quite acceptable.

LEARNING THE LESSONS OF IRAN-CONTRA CONSPIRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerning Howard Rosenberg's Nov. 27 column, "Applying the Lessons of 
Iran-Contra": 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Rosenberg and The Times for alerting us to watch the outstanding Bill 
Moyers' TV special, "Frontline: High Crimes and Misdemeanors," broadcast Nov. 
27. This program, about the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages deal, should be 
required viewing for every voter and every student. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone should see how President Reagan and/or key members of his 
Administration conspired to establish a fascistic group that was willing to lie 
to the public and to Congress; was willing to break the laws; was willing to go 
to almost any extent to cover up their "high crimes and misdemeanors." These 
were the men who set the tone for the country. These were the role models for 
us and for our youth. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson for us today is that when the President speaks about Iraq -- or any 
other subject -- and when members of the Administration testify before 
Congress, we must keep in mind the statement may or may not be true, depending 
on whether it works to their personal advantage and that of the Administration. 
God help us all!

THE SHANGHAI ACROBATS: GIVE 'EM A TUMBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You think you had a rough day at the office? Got stuck in another freeway 
traffic jam? Too bad. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine squeezing though a barrel narrower than your shoulders. Or a keeping a 
stretch of 21 porcelain plates spinning while executing some disco moves. Or 
balancing 19 benches -- that's about 400 pounds -- on your head. 
</P>
<P>
Night after night. 
</P>
<P>
That's some of what the members of the Shanghai Acrobats and Imperial Warriors 
of the Peking Opera did Thursday at Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena. 
Captivatingly. Enthrallingly. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the troupe had performed similar acts at the Bren Center at UC 
Irvine, and the Chinese visitors faced further local appearances within days at 
Caltech in Pasadena and El Camino College in Torrance. What a grind. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, however, the seemingly impossible looked effortless. The challenges 
multiplied quickly. Guesses about how complex things would get proved wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Jing Ni could balance a stack of bowls on her head -- but upside down, 
maintaining a single hand stand on the head of Jia-Cheng Zhang? Well, what 
about balancing on both his hands while he turned over on the floor? And all 
the while maintaining an impish smile. What about . . . oh, forget it. 
</P>
<P>
Contortionist Wen-Tong Yu squeezed her way through a hoop -- and later a barrel 
-- as easily as a loaf of bread rising. 
</P>
<P>
Lian-Hua Pan took time for hot-stuff dance moves between rushing down a row of 
tables to keep an increasing number of plates spinning. 
</P>
<P>
Strongman Lian-Qing Pan hoisted up one, then seven, then 10, then 19 
interlocking benches to balance them all on his head. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most breathtaking act, however, involved acrobat Wei-Zhen Zhu 
balancing on a long, flexible metal pole held by Wei-Zhong Lu and Wei-Feng 
Tang. 
</P>
<P>
Get this. They would hold the pole at throat level, then jerk it upward until 
their arms were fully extended. Zhu would shoot into the air where she executed 
multiple somersaults -- some through a hoop -- with apparently endless time at 
her disposal before returning to balance nimbly on the pole. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese opera incorporates gymnastics in fight scenes, but the opera excerpts 
presented Thursday probably were not seen to their best advantage taken out of 
context and juxtaposed against the other purely gymnastic acts. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, one could appreciate the split-second timing of the near misses in 
"Fighting at the Crossroads," where two men fight one another in a pitch dark 
room. 
</P>
<P>
And one could rejoice in the wit and cleverness more than in the martial 
process by which the Monkey King defeats his opponents in two excerpts from 
"Havoc in Heaven." But the two forms somehow didn't really mesh. CHRIS PASLES

'GOOD COPS, BAD COPS' A SMOOTH CAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ray Sharkey as a Boston police captain in a starched blue uniform is an 
incredulous image. That's because Sharkey has nailed down the market on feral 
con artists. And sure enough, he turns out to be a corrupt cop in NBC's "Good 
Cops, Bad Cops" (Sunday at 9 p.m., Channels 4, 36 and 39), a moderately 
compelling, fact-based yarn about a group of Boston's finest who pulled off 
what may be history's biggest bank heist (some $25 million in cash and jewels). 
</P>
<P>
Ed Asner plays a police official who from the start is wise to Sharkey's 
scam-laden character (based on the real-life Gerry Clemente, who from his cell 
wrote the book "The Cops Are Robbers," on which scenarist Bill Bleich based his 
teleplay). 
</P>
<P>
Director Paul Wendkos and a gritty cast of actors, including bad guys Steve 
Railsback and James Keach, dramatize a nervy and literally almost leisurely 
three-day bank robbery masterminded by a cool group of Boston policemen over 
the Memorial Day weekend in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
They get away with it too. That's the first hour of the show, and it's staged 
with enough veracity that, as with so many daring capers, you find yourself 
pulling for the gangsters. The last hour is equally arresting and implacable as 
the thieves, who know no honor among themselves, of course, fall into the fatal 
trap of mutual distrust. 
</P>
<P>
Sharkey's performance, which is convincingly measured instead of merely hyper, 
is quite good and it anchors the show. There's no violence as such until the 
end, a vermilion moment that unflinchingly lingers on a gunshot victim as he 
crawls home a bloody pulp. The scene is unusually graphic but a casebook 
example of violence dramatized for the right reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting actors Bobby Kellog (an undercover cop who underscores the pressure 
from the Asner character for cops to rat on other cops) and Robert F. Lyons (as 
the gang's alarm system magician) earmark the attention to character detail.RAY

'DONOR' STRAINS PROBABILITY TO THE EXTREME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most folks, hospitals, whether they're in fiction or in fact, are 
uncomfortable, unpleasant, generally scary places. Mid City General, the scene 
of "Donor," a new CBS movie airing Sunday night at 9 on Channels 2 and 8, mixes 
the worst of Robin Cook, Paddy Chayefsky and Stephen King. 
</P>
<P>
Rotten place to visit, wouldn't want to die there. 
</P>
<P>
"Donor" is one of those tricky conspiratorial thrillers, which, like most of 
this genre, strains probability to its extreme, and especially in a big 
hospital, where it's hard to keep secrets. Like if you were going to take gland 
samples from this kid with progeria, the premature-senility disorder, then feed 
them to young men to age them and kill them off and in the process come up with 
an anti-aging pill that would be worth millions and millions and millions, 
wouldn't somebody be suspicious? 
</P>
<P>
Well, as far as we know, the only person who thinks something's amiss is young 
Dr. Kris Lipton (played by Melissa Gilbert-Brinkman). Even as people are 
getting slashed up with a razor, Kris' anxieties are pooh-poohed by handsome 
Dr. Kesselman (Jack Scalia), surly Dr. Farrell (Wendy Hughes) and patriarchal 
Dr. Martingale (Pernell Roberts). 
</P>
<P>
(One, of course, is a secret agent for the Food &amp; Drug Administration -- 
and just in time.) 
</P>
<P>
What starts out with a slick premise on a dark and stormy night in eerie Ward 7 
West, eventually ends up with comic-book tussling in Operating Room 8.

SOLDIER OF FORTUNE FOUND LIABLE IN 'GUN FOR HIRE' AD LINKED TO KILLING

<P>
A jury on Friday found Soldier of Fortune magazine liable for $12.4 million in 
damages for running a "gun for hire" ad blamed on the 1985 killing of a 
businessman. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for the sons of Richard Braun had urged the U.S. District Court jury 
to send a message to publishers by ruling that the classified ad was 
responsible for Braun's death. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the magazine argued in the 1st Amendment case that the 
publication should not be held liable and that publishers have no duty to 
research the background of their advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
Those closing arguments were offered in a lawsuit, which sought $120 million, 
against the Boulder, Colo.-based magazine. It was the second such case against 
the magazine to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
In the previous trial, seeking damages in a woman's slaying in 1985, a Houston 
jury returned a $9.4-million verdict. That award was reversed on appeal, and 
the U.S. Supreme Court let the decision stand. 
</P>
<P>
In the Alabama lawsuit, the jury heard 4 1/2 days of testimony before it began 
deliberating. 
</P>
<P>
Brothers Michael and Ian Braun blamed their father's death on a "gun for hire" 
classified ad in the magazine's June, 1985, issue by Richard Savage of 
Knoxville, Tenn. The Brauns contended that their father's business associate, 
Bruce Gastwirth, used the ad to arrange to have Braun killed. 
</P>
<P>
Michael, then 16, was wounded in the Aug. 27, 1985, attack in the family's 
driveway in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Savage's classified ad read: "GUN FOR HIRE: 37-year-old professional mercenary 
desires jobs. Vietnam veteran. Discrete and very private. Body guard, courier 
and other special skills. All jobs considered." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the magazine stopped running such ads. 
</P>
<P>
Gastwirth, Savage and two associates were convicted of Braun's killing. Savage 
already had been convicted in a similar murder-for-hire case in West Palm 
Beach, Fla.

I wanted to take the time to commend the L.A. Times for your progressive 
affirmative action program. 
</P>
<P>
I have been reading some of the commentaries authored by Mr. Mike Downey and 
have also heard him on KABC radio. Mr. Downey's learning disabilities are 
apparent from the level on which he communicates. His handicap appears to be a 
cognitive reasoning disorder, typically found in adults suffering from 
dysfunctional disorders that keep many unemployed and living nonproductive 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that this has not deterred the L.A. Times from employing Mr. Downey is 
a tribute to your policy to employ people less fortunate than most.

Apparently, Mike Downey is so driven to prove himself a pseudo-liberated male 
that he found it convenient to ignore the numerous polls conducted on the Lisa 
Olson case that found women saying that Olson and her female associates did not 
belong in a male locker room. I'm certain, though, that Downey would blame this 
finding on centuries of male brainwashing or some other phony reasoning 
designed to renew his NOW membership.

Where does Mike Downey get off using his column to express a personal vendetta 
against Kirk Gibson, or anyone for that matter? And where does The Times get 
off allowing a reporter to let loose with such a diatribe? 
</P>
<P>
More often than not, I find Mr. Downey's columns at least mildly entertaining 
and informative. 
</P>
<P>
But the opinions expressed in his column of Dec. 2, whether validated or not by 
other reporters and/or baseball people, were appallingly out of line. Is Kirk 
Gibson an angel? No (he's a Royal). Has he demonstrated surly behavior at 
times? Probably. Has his behavior been at times crude and inappropriate? 
Possibly. But that is no reason to use the much-valued editorial space of a 
major metropolitan newspaper for a blatant cheap shot.

SOMETHING GROSS ABOUT DODGER DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kirk Gibson's leaving the Dodgers leaves me with two unforgettable memories. 
</P>
<P>
The first is his 1988 World Series home run, which ranks as my No. 1 Dodger 
highlight. The second is his turning his back on young autograph seekers after 
a game in 1990. This ranks as an all-time low point. On the one hand, you have 
the player, Kirk the Great. One the other you have the person, Kirk the Jerk. 
Too bad for Kirk, because he has many more years ahead of him as a person and 
only a few as a player.

What do the Dodgers need? A left-handed relief pitcher, a left-handed starting 
pitcher, a second baseman and a leadoff man/center fielder.

<P>
So what do they do? They spend $6.4 million on Kevin Gross -- a mediocre 
right-handed pitcher with a lifetime record under .500 and an ERA over 4.00. 
What a Gross mistake.

ANDERSON EPITOMIZES BEARS' TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG LOGAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LAKE FOREST, Ill. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The gesture was a casual one totally lacking in fanfare of any sort. One day in 
training camp last summer, Chicago Bears Coach Mike Ditka called running back 
Neal Anderson up from the back row of players doing calisthenics and told him 
to move to the front row. Anderson came forward, but when he stopped in the 
first row of the main body of players, Ditka pointed toward the row of team 
captains leading the workout and said, "No, no, no, I want you up there." 
</P>
<P>
It was a moment full of symbolism. Neal Anderson, who came into the NFL faced 
with the daunting task of replacing Walter Payton, the league's all-time 
leading rusher, had proven himself big enough to fill those shoes without 
missing a beat. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the significance of being named one of the captains of the Bears, a 
team with a rich and valued tradition, Anderson said, "Now, I have to make sure 
I do all my calisthenics." 
</P>
<P>
That remark is typical of Anderson's infectious good humor. The compact 5-11, 
210-pound runner has a kind of indefatigable quality about him, a buoyancy that 
can lift a team and carry it to victory. He did it again last Sunday when he 
caught a 50-yard touchdown pass from Jim Harbaugh with 4:03 left in overtime to 
beat Detroit, 23-17. "I told Harbaugh to just throw it up, and I'll go get it," 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson has been bothered all season by painful rib and hamstring injuries, 
but when his teammates needed a winning play, he made it. "The way he comes out 
every week and plays over injuries is a real inspiration," said Harbaugh, who 
has persevered despite his own assortment of hurts. "He's a great one." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks earlier in the season, it seemed as if Anderson's hamstring injury 
was too severe to allow him to play in a game at Denver. But Anderson badgered 
Ditka into letting him play, and he wound up carrying the ball a career-high 28 
times for 111 yards to help the Bears grind out a 16-13 overtime victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that I'm trying to please Ditka or fit the Bears organization," 
Anderson said. "I've been the same type of player no matter where I was. But 
Ditka thinks the toughest guy should win. I kid the guys in the locker room and 
tell them I'm from the old school." 
</P>
<P>
During his Hall of Fame career as a tight end, Ditka epitomized the Bears' 
rugged image. Above all else, Ditka respects a player who has the ability to 
handle the pain associated with the football business and show up for work on a 
regular basis. That's why he loves Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
When Ditka was asked if he was amazed Anderson played so well with the 
hamstring injury, he said, "I'm not amazed he played because he almost drove me 
nuts saying he was going to play. I'm amazed I called his number so many 
times." 
</P>
<P>
In this season of their revival following the 6-10 collapse of 1989, the 10-2 
Bears have run the ball more than any team in the NFL. They have taken to 
pounding away with Anderson and fullback Brad Muster and letting their defense 
do the rest. If the Bears can win in Washington Sunday, it may be tough for the 
10-2 New York Giants to keep pace with them and the San Francisco 49ers in the 
race to gain one of two first-round playoff byes. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense is allowing us to stick with running the ball," center Jay 
Hilgenberg said. "That's the whole key. The defense is healthy now." 
</P>
<P>
Injuries ruined the defense a year ago after the Bears got off to a 4-0 start. 
Uncertainty at quarterback hurt them on offense, but now, Harbaugh has won out 
over Mike Tomczak as the successor to Jim McMahon, who was traded away last 
season. He may lack McMahon's flair for the bizarre, but Harbaugh has shown 
greater durability. 
</P>
<P>
Toughness is a big part of what it means to be a Bear, and Anderson has 
typified that competitive spirit as much as anyone this season. "He played 
under a guy who missed one game in 13 years," noted tackle Jim Covert, 
referring to Payton's remarkable record of durability. "I think he got an idea 
Bear running backs are tough." 
</P>
<P>
In his first two seasons as the full-time starter following Payton's retirement 
at the end of the 1987 season, Anderson rushed for 1,106 and 1,275 yards, 
respectively, and was named to the Pro Bowl both times. When he came out of 
Florida, Anderson was downgraded in the 1986 draft because the scouts believed 
he was a poor receiver, but he has led the Bears in receiving twice. This 
season, Anderson leads the Bears with 853 yards rushing and 37 receptions. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the stats, Anderson's example is what means most to the Bears. There was 
a game earlier this season against Green Bay in which Anderson suffered a 
concussion and then had to take a painkilling shot for a rib injury at halftime 
but still was able to rush for 141 yards and break a 52-yard run late in the 
game that helped secure a 27-13 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always had a high tolerance for pain, especially once I'm in a game," 
said Anderson, who has practiced self-hypnosis in the past as a means of 
blocking out the pain. "I'm not going to jeopardize my career or the team, but 
anything short of that, I line up and play." 
</P>
<P>
The use of painkilling drugs is fairly common throughout the NFL, but care must 
be taken not to mask pain and risk further injury. While Anderson has taken 
injections for the rib injury and a broken left index finger, he never 
considered taking a painkiller for his hamstring injury because of the danger 
it could tear if he couldn't feel it and not know how far he could push it. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on the (injured) area," Anderson said. "I have it checked through 
the medical people to make sure I'm not risking more damage." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason Anderson pushes himself so hard is because he loves any 
challenge, from playing cards to playing tennis, golf, Ping-Pong, pool, darts 
or Nintendo games. But he also has fought hard to free himself of the specter 
of Payton. There was some friction between the two in Payton's last season when 
Anderson led the team in rushing while playing second team. And not long ago, 
Payton made the comment in an interview that the quality of NFL running backs 
"trickles off" after Eric Dickerson and Roger Craig. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to get into that," Anderson said. "Everybody has their opinion 
as to who is considered the best running back in the league. Only Walter can 
answer why he said that." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it had something to do with the way Anderson pushed him into retirement. 
He was not content to wait patiently for his turn until Payton retired. "I came 
in and wanted to play after one week," Anderson recalled. "I met with Ditka and 
that's how I got on special teams. I think I was supposed to say no when he 
said I could play special teams, but I said yes." 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to play even when Walter was here. I admit he's probably the greatest 
running back of all time, but I felt I was ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Anderson was ready. Payton never will be forgotten because he set 
the standard for toughness, but since Neal Anderson has been around, Payton 
hasn't been missed either.

LSU RIPS CHAPMAN TO PREPARE FOR ARIZONA

Both coaches felt 18th-ranked Louisiana State was calculating in its 101-68 
victory over Chapman College on Friday night in Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
LSU's third consecutive victory sent Dale Brown's Tigers into today's 
nationally televised game against No. 2 Arizona with a 3-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Dale's done a very good job of preparing his team," said Chapman Coach 
Bob Boyd, whose team fell to 3-3 with its third consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure his main concern is with tomorrow's game against what I feel is the 
nation's best team, Arizona. Everybody's talking about Vegas, but I think 
Arizona is the top team in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Shaquille O'Neal, LSU's 7-foot-1 sophomore center, had 18 points, 16 rebounds 
and six blocked shots in the 20 minutes. Four teammates also scored in double 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
"The game went just about the way I expected it to. We were just outclassed and 
outmanned," Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman, a Division II team, never tested bigger, deeper LSU. The Tigers did 
not trail, outshooting Chapman from the field, 54% to 40%, with a 50-32 
rebounding edge. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to be cautious of running up the score," Brown said, "but, on the 
other hand, we didn't want to let it get too close and lose the game by being 
Mr. Nice Guy." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Middleton's 22 points led Chapman. Andre Hill added 14. 
</P>
<P>
No. 4 Syracuse 103, Alaska Anchorage 85 -- The Orangemen received 16 points

at Syracuse, N.Y.

DICKSON IS NOT WINNING ANYBODY OVER

<P>
Japan's Nippon Challenge, anewcomer, became a serious contender for the 
America's Cup earlier this year by hiring New Zealand's Chris Dickson to sail 
its boat at San Diego in 1992. Now, there are serious questions as to whether 
traditional Japanese decorum can survive another year and a half of the 
impetuous Kiwi. 
</P>
<P>
There might be no better sailor. Dickson, who won the Congressional Cup at Long 
Beach last March, was the top-ranked skipper going into the Mazda World 
Match-Racing Championships at home in Auckland last month. 
</P>
<P>
But the sailing did not go well for Dickson at Auckland. First, there was his 
former boss, Michael Fay, needling him through the media that he was a 
turncoat. 
</P>
<P>
"For the next Cup series," said Fay, who employed Dickson at Fremantle, 
Australia, in 1986-87, "he is not a Kiwi but a Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
Then Dickson lost five of nine races in the round-robin and failed to reach the 
semifinals. Worse, his John McEnroe-type act turned off observers. 
</P>
<P>
When the on-the-water judges called a foul on him in one race, Dickson yelled 
back, waved a red protest flag at the judges' boat, then did his compulsory 
270-degree penalty turn -- and rammed the judges' boat. Then he ripped out the 
radio used by an on-board officiating aide and threw it overboard. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what America's Cup pressure can do to you," said a rival skipper, Peter 
Isler of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The local newspapers raked their former national hero as "Super Brat," as Fay 
tried to keep a straight face while saying things such as, "We would have liked 
Chris Dickson to have been part of our New Zealand Challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Fay is in a cooperative effort with the other Japanese challenge from Masakazu 
Kobayashi's Bengal Bay Boating Club. Some of his own sailors, including 
American Rod Davis, are working with Bengal Bay through May's International 
America's Cup Class World Championships at San Diego. The teams' first two 
boats are currently bound for California. 
</P>
<P>
Australian Peter Gilmour won the world match-racing title by defeating Davis in 
two consecutive races. He had a tougher time with Isler, who was tied with 
Davis at 8-1 after the round-robin. 
</P>
<P>
In the semifinals, Isler and Gilmour split their first two races, then Isler 
overtook Gilmour on the final, upwind leg of the deciding race for an apparent 
photo-finish victory. 
</P>
<P>
"For about a minute, nobody knew who won," Isler said. 
</P>
<P>
After an instant replay of videotapes, the judges ruled Gilmour the winner by 
two seconds, sending him into the finals. 
</P>
<P>
Skipper Pete Melvin and crew Steve Rosenberg of Long Beach are in Melbourne, 
Australia, tuning their C Class catamaran, "Freedom's Wing," for the 
best-of-seven semifinals of the Little America's Cup against France's tilt-wing 
boat, "Otip," starting Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans represent the Chula Vista Yacht Club. The semifinal-round winner 
will meet the Australian defender, "The Edge II," starting Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Because there is no minimum weight restriction, the 25-foot boats with their 
hard sails tend to be fragile in construction. Virtually every competition 
since the series started in 1960 has been settled by breakdowns. Most recently, 
two years ago, a boat sponsored by the Cabrillo Beach Yacht Club broke apart 
minutes before the first race when caught by a helicopter's downdraft in choppy 
seas. 
</P>
<P>
Gino Morelli, who helped build the Stars &amp; Stripes catamarans in '88, tried 
to build in durability without using too much beef, but up until a week before 
they left, Rosenberg said, "We couldn't go out for 10 minutes without breaking 
something." 
</P>
<P>
They think they solved their problems during the last week of tuning on San 
Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin, an '88 Olympian, and Rosenberg won the ProSail series for Hobie 21s 
last year but have limited experience with hard-sail rigs. They will have had a 
couple of weeks' additional practice on McCrae Bay, before the French arrive 
two days before the event. 
</P>
<P>
"They're either super-confident or so unconfident that they don't want to waste 
their time and money," Rosenberg said. "We might surprise everybody." 
</P>

Sailing Notes 
</P>
<P>
OFFSHORE -- Transpacific Race Committee Chairman Lew Comyns of the Long Beach 
Yacht Club is accepting entries for the 1991 renewal of the West Coast's 
premier offshore event. Entries are restricted to IOR and IMS boats measuring a 
minimum of 30.5 feet at the waterline. The fee is $600 before Jan. 31, $750 
after. So the smaller, slower boats don't miss the award luaus and such, there 
will be two starts for the first time -- on Thursday, June 27, and Saturday, 
June 29. . . . Mike Plant, America's top hope in the BOC Challenge singlehanded 
race around the world, moved from fifth to third place after incurring damage 
when rammed by South Africa's Bertie Reed at the start of the second leg from 
Cape Town, South Africa. Rather than return to port for repairs, Plant 
continued, but reported he was pumping 50 gallons of water an hour in rough 
seas. Plant was 41 hours behind winner Christophe Auguin of France. The first 
boats are expected to reach Sydney, Australia, about Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
NOTEWORTHY -- At Balboa Yacht Club, John Cazier won USYRU's One-Design 
Leadership award for his work with Schock 35s, and Peter Huston was elected 
vice president of the U.S. Pro Sailing Assn. . . . Bill Lynn, a past president 
of the U.S. Yacht Racing Union and one of the sport's most effective 
administrators, died while on vacation in the Bahamas. He was chairman of the 
International Yacht Racing Union's international classes committee, the USYRU 
representative to the U.S. Olympic Committee and president of the U.S. Sailing 
Foundation. He also was instrumental in organizing the U.S. Professional 
Sailing Assn. under USYRU.

TRIP FOR ITALIAN EARTHENWARE DISHES UP THRIVING BUSINESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tucked away in this sleepy town is a store that is carrying on a tradition 
begun in 15th-Century Italy. 
</P>
<P>
In a shop they call Ceramica, Carol LeWitt and Carol Huebner sell Italian 
majolica, brightly colored, ornately painted earthenware made in Deruta, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
LeWitt, 34, and Huebner, 41, own a second shop in New York City's Little Italy 
and plan to open another in West Hartford, Conn., to accommodate a rapidly 
expanding business that grew, appropriately, out of a need for a new dinner 
set. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, LeWitt and her husband, artist Sol LeWitt, moved to Spoleto, Italy, 
and were looking for dishes for their home. 
</P>
<P>
Huebner and her husband, painter Michael Venezia, were visiting at the time, 
and the four decided to drive the 40 minutes from Spoleto to Deruta to see the 
pottery that, for centuries, has formed the livelihood of local artisans. 
</P>
<P>
Sol LeWitt, watching the craftsmen, had an idea. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing he said was, 'If I bring in a drawing, could you make it for 
me?' " his wife said, adding that the question started her thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, I spent all those years at art school, I could do that, too," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
LeWitt and Huebner, a professional photographer who majored in ceramics in 
college, began researching the history of majolica, learning traditional 
patterns and color schemes and visiting with the craftsmen. 
</P>
<P>
They discovered that the artisans had cabinets full of pottery shards that had 
been collected for generations. As LeWitt and Huebner discussed design, the 
craftsmen would through the shards and pull out a classic pattern that hadn't 
been used for some time. 
</P>
<P>
"We got so we could sit down with a potter and say, 'Look, it has to be this 
way,' and then sit down with the painter and say, 'Do you remember . . .," said 
LeWitt, whose fluency in Italian helped convey their wishes. "Because they were 
craftsmen and not artists, they listened." 
</P>
<P>
LeWitt said the artisans at first were skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought we were dilettantes, that we were just doing this for the fun of 
it," she said. "They never thought there would be a business in it." 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the mid-1980s, the Museum of Modern Art in New York bought a dinner 
set designed by Sol LeWitt, whose art has been internationally exhibited. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the first time the artisans had a serious validation that what they 
could do could be considered art," his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
The business from LeWitt and Huebner couldn't have come at a better time for 
the craftsmen, because after centuries of a thriving pottery tradition, it had 
started to dry up. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be in Italy that every town had its own style," said Huebner. 
"There are towns that have lost the tradition . . . but we think we've 
rejuvenated the business a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Although they both live in the United States -- Huebner in New York, LeWitt in 
Chester -- they have an assistant in Italy and travel about four times a year 
to the factories to oversee production. 
</P>
<P>
Although other stores sell majolica, the two say they are able to sell it for 
less because they import it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no middle man," Huebner said. "We also know who does the best 
pottery." 
</P>
<P>
Prices for most pieces range from $2.75 to a few hundred dollars, with most in 
the $20 range. A five-piece dinner set sells for about $100. 
</P>
<P>
"Our idea was the things needed to be useful," LeWitt said. "You should use 
your $7.95 mug every day, and if it chips it won't break your heart."

KILIM RUGS DATED BACK TO STONE AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ISTANBUL, Turkey, Reuter 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Turkey's Anatolian kilim rugs, once used as export wrapping for more valuable 
pile carpets, have soared in value as they have become prized by collectors. 
</P>
<P>
Now new research says they date back to the Stone Age. 
</P>
<P>
"We have found evidence in Turkey of the oldest woven textiles yet found in the 
world, and there is a direct line of descent to kilims still being woven 
today," British archeologist James Mellaart said. 
</P>
<P>
Historians say women weavers in many Turkish villages have for 9,000 years 
preserved patterns that may shed new light on the region's forgotten social and 
religious past. 
</P>
<P>
Mellaart and two colleagues, Turkish kilim expert Belkis Balpinar and West 
German photographer Udo Hirsch, are to publish later this year a study 
comparing archeological remains with present-day kilims. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very exciting. It's a very respectable theory and I'm dying to 
see the book," said Alan Marcuson, editor of Hali, an authoritative Oriental 
carpet trade magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Mellaart said he first made the link in 1961 when excavation of a late Stone 
Age site at Catalhuyuk, east of Ankara, produced evidence of geometric patterns 
and textile wall hangings. 
</P>
<P>
"My Turkish colleagues immediately said, 'Those are kilims,' " Mellaart said. 
"But nobody then knew what kilims were, so we had nothing scientific to go on." 
</P>
<P>
Until about 10 years ago, the flat-weave wool rugs were still being ignored by 
carpet collectors. 
</P>
<P>
They were highly prized in the Turkish villages but were known to the outside 
world only when they were used as wrappings for the more valuable pile carpets. 
</P>
<P>
Since then their low price compared with pile carpets has sparked the interest 
of collectors, and there has been a flood of catalogues, exhibitions and even 
conferences. 
</P>
<P>
Gaudy tourist kilims now sell as fast as knotted pile carpets in the Istanbul 
bazaar and decorate homes worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Serious collectors have made old kilims an investment, and one group now bids 
up to $100,000 apiece for fragments hundreds of years old still being found in 
Turkish mosques. 
</P>
<P>
Balpinar, who in 20 years as a former curator and official Turkish collector 
has seen innumerable examples, said the dating of old pieces was unreliable 
because patterns did not change. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can sometimes tell the place of origin down to a single village or 
tribe, because the pattern is handed down from mother to daughter, probably for 
thousands of years," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some skeptics see the theory as farfetched, including a claim that the niche 
pattern now used for Moslem prayer rugs in fact derives from religious forms 
far older than Islam. 
</P>
<P>
But Balpinar cites a total of 14 kinds of kilim motifs woven today that she 
believes can be traced back to ancient cults in Anatolia, the rectangle of Asia 
Minor that is now Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
The most striking of these is the Mother Goddess represented in dozens of 
examples of Stone Age figurines in museums all over Turkey as fat and pregnant, 
with overflowing breasts. 
</P>
<P>
This fertility goddess is also now the most common kilim pattern, called 
elibelinde by weaver women and reproduced in scores of stylized combinations of 
head or body with hands on hips or under the breasts. 
</P>
<P>
"In one village, they still sacrifice a sheep before weaving an elibelinde 
kilim," Balpinar said. "They say, 'If we don't please the god, we will be 
punished.' " 
</P>
<P>
Balpinar said traditional kilims were woven in at least half of Turkey's 35,000 
villages, showing a strong thread of continuity from prehistoric times. 
</P>
<P>
The theory challenges Turkish lore that Turkey was first populated by nomads 
who arrived from Central Asia from the 11th Century onward. 
</P>
<P>
Hali magazine's Marcuson and Jaqueline Bing of the Islamic section of London's 
Sotheby's auction house told Reuters that the Mellart-Balpinar theory was 
accepted in outline among carpet specialists. 
</P>
<P>
"Anatolia was not empty before the arrival of the Turks," Mellaart said.

SOME FEAR EXTENSIVE TRAVEL HURTS BUSH'S PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's hectic travel schedule, which has included visits to Europe, 
the Middle East, Mexico and South America in the last three weeks, is stirring 
serious concern among some longtime advisers that it is adversely affecting his 
performance at a critical time in his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
With the United States on a virtual war footing with Iraq and congressional 
critics openly blasting his Persian Gulf policy while he is away, some of the 
President's own advisers have said privately that there has been a lack of 
long-range planning on the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy's never in the United States," said one political consultant who has 
worked with Bush over the years. "The theme song of this Administration is 'On 
the Road Again.' " 
</P>
<P>
And, said a former Bush staff member who still advises the President: "I 
sometimes think he substitutes travel for really coping with serious problems." 
Noting that the agenda for the South America trip was more symbolic than 
substantive, this adviser added: "I worry that it's hard to keep him focused on 
major problems." 
</P>
<P>
Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, the President has been on the road 
for 70 days, at times arriving at stops looking drawn and tired. His extensive 
travels during the military standoff with Iraq also have put him in the awkward 
position of spending time addressing less immediate issues while major 
developments were breaking in the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
While Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was in Baghdad Thursday announcing the 
release of hostages, for example, Bush was at a press conference in Santiago 
answering Chilean reporters' questions about Latin American issues. 
</P>
<P>
But White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in Caracas, Venezuela, 
the final stop on the President's current tour of South America, that Bush has 
not been isolated from events in the gulf during the trip. "The President's got 
all the communications he needs. The President's on top of it. We have no 
second thoughts or concerns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation's under control. (Secretary of State James A.) Baker and the 
President have talked. All the decisions have been made that needed to be 
made," he said. But he said Bush had not spoken in recent days with any allied 
leaders because he "hasn't found a need to yet." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the President's advisers have blamed travel fatigue for occasional 
gaffes. After tacking a flight back to Geneva onto the end of his already 
crowded trip to Europe and the Middle East last month in order to visit with 
Syrian President Hafez Assad, Bush stunned his aides by allowing himself to be 
photographed in a smiling, animated pose with a cheerful-looking Assad. 
</P>
<P>
White House staff members considered the resulting front-page photos of Bush 
and Assad a public relations disaster. The Syrian is a dictator whose country 
harbors terrorists and who many consider as evil as Iraq's Saddam Hussein -- 
the dictator the President called "worse than Hitler." 
</P>
<P>
"That would not have happened if he hadn't been tired or if he had had someone 
like Jim Baker there to protect him," one adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident reminded the adviser of the time in June, 1981, when a weary Vice 
President Bush arrived in Manila after an arduous journey and told Philippine 
strongman Ferdinand Marcos that "we love your adherence to democratic 
principles and to the democratic processes." Opposition leaders, meanwhile, 
were condemning the Marcos government's human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about Bush's constant traveling, especially his marathon overseas 
journeys, date to the earliest days of his presidency. Shortly after his 
inauguration, Bush traveled overnight to Tokyo for the funeral of Emperor 
Hirohito. He then flew on to Beijing, and, after meetings there with Chinese 
leaders, flew, again overnight, back to Washington, stopping briefly en route 
in Korea for a speech. 
</P>
<P>
The schedule drew an expression of concern from National Security Adviser Brent 
Scowcroft, who cautioned the President that his frantic pace was exhausting his 
staff and setting up the possibility that jet-lagged aides could make 
potentially damaging errors on sensitive foreign policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
Bush brushed the objections aside and has continued to ignore advice that he 
should go at a more measured pace. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, sources have reported that White House physicians suggested that 
the President slow down and curb his travel. "Doctors have warned him, but he's 
just jet-propelled," one adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
"The more he goes, the more he goes. Somebody said he's a type A personality 
but he's not a type A. They hate what they do. He loves it," the adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lawrence Mohr, deputy White House physician, refused to confirm or deny the 
report, declaring that "any advice of this nature would be confidential between 
the President and his physicians." 
</P>
<P>
But Mohr said that Bush is in good physical shape, "tolerates travel very well 
and is able to sleep and even take a shower on the new Air Force One." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said that Bush has not been given medical advice to rest, "although 
the doctor is always telling him to slow down." 
</P>
<P>
In September, the President did begin traveling in a new $181-million Boeing 
747 fully equiped with a bedroom and a shower. It clearly makes his journeys 
more comfortable, and aides say that he is able to get a good deal of sleep on 
the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, some advisers worry that his overseas journeys involve traveling 
through so many time zones in such a short period that it's almost impossible 
for his biological clock to adapt fully. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to take a toll," one veteran adviser said, "and, when he gets in 
trouble, it's usually because he's too busy and tired. It was when he was going 
at such a frenetic pace during the 1988 campaign that people said he looked 
goofy." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has traveled far more extensively than any other chief executive at this 
stage of his presidency. In less than two years in office, he has logged more 
than 225,000 miles, traveling to 28 foreign countries and all but six of the 50 
states. And there's no end in sight. 
</P>
<P>
After his 17,000-mile trip to Europe and the Middle East last month, he 
returned briefly to Washington before traveling to Mexico, a visit one adviser 
said had such a thin agenda "it could have been taken care of with a telephone 
call." 
</P>
<P>
As for the 11,930-mile journey he is completing today in Caracas, "there 
doesn't seem to be a particular need for this trip," one White House official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He returned briefly from Mexico before starting his current six-day trip to 
South America. Next month, he plans to travel to Moscow, perhaps other cities 
in the Soviet Union, and Greece and Turkey. Plans are also being made for a 
trip in February to Australia and probably one or two other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, a President is accompanied on foreign travels by his secretary of 
state. But Baker, the President's longtime friend, has caught what one mutual 
friend described as "a case of Bushitis" and has been so busy with his own 
travel schedule that Bush has had to do without his advice on some recent 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
Some of their mutual friends have said that they think both Bush and Baker are 
traveling too much to think clearly. "You can't run a country from a plane and, 
when you're working and moving, you can't think clearly," one of them declared. 
</P>
<P>
Baker has traveled so extensively, especially in connection with the Persian 
Gulf crisis, that he frequently has appeared exhausted from jet lag. He 
apparently does not rest as well as Bush during plane trips and frequently 
takes Halcion, a prescription drug, as a sleeping aid, according to sources who 
travel with him. 
</P>
<P>
Medical authorities say that Halcion, a hypnotic drug, is an effective sleeping 
aid and has a wide margin of safety in therapeutic doses. But the 1989 edition 
of "The Essential Guide to Prescription Drugs" cautions that possible risks 
include "minor impairment of mental functions ('hangover effect')" and 
"habit-forming potential with long-term use." 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Baker often joke with each other and with reporters about their 
extensive traveling. When Bush took his maiden flight on the new Air Force One, 
he smiled at reporters and said: "Have plane, will travel." 
</P>
<P>
But it's no joking matter to some of the President's longtime friends and 
advisers, who think that the White House needs to curb his travel and slow him 
down. "It's awfully disconcerting," one veteran adviser said. "Somebody needs 
to take a careful look at his schedule and persuade him to spend more time in 
Washington."

<P>
Gerald D. Wagner hates driving his '87 Jaguar to work. Too much wear and tear 
on the vehicle, his psyche and his eyesight. "You're facing the sun in the 
morning," explains the tweed-jacketed First Interstate Bank vice president. 
"And you're facing the sun when you come back home." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Wagner hops the No. 10 Freeway Express, plunking down 80 cents for a 
45-minute ride from Santa Monica to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Ruby Baker also owns a car, a beat-up Nissan that's been in the shop a month 
while she scrapes together cash for a new transmission. Working the midnight 
shift at a catering company at LAX, Baker shells out $4.30 as she climbs on the 
last bus nightly between San Bernardino and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Problem is, the No. 110 Inland Empire Connection departs at 6:30 p.m., dropping 
her off four hours before work begins -- and leaving her only six hours after 
she returns home before she begins her next nightly trudge. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Wagner are far from typical. For many Southern Californians -- whose 
cars serve as rolling sound systems, grooming salons or telephone booths -- the 
idea of taking a bus or train sounds as inviting as riding a rocket to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
But the pair illustrate the kinds of people found by a Times reporter who spent 
a week traveling 1,000 miles on more than 40 buses, trains and trolleys in the 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
The five-day journey, at a time when the region's commitment to improved public 
transportation is greatest since the heyday of the Red Cars a half-century ago, 
showed the riders to be a diverse and resilient lot. It demonstrated that it is 
possible to reach almost any major destination -- provided a passenger has the 
time, patience and cash. 
</P>
<P>
But it also showed evidence of a two-tiered transit system. 
</P>
<P>
Express buses and Amtrak trains, which generally transport an upper-crust 
clientele, are clean and comfortable, passengers say, while local buses, 
particularly on routes frequented by minority groups in central Los Angeles 
County, tend to be more crowded and less shipshape. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DAY 1: The Sea to the Desert 
</P>
<P>
That old bromide "You can't get there from here," does not necessarily apply to 
public transit in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger can travel from the sea to the desert and back in a single day; 
more specifically, from fashionable Santa Monica, home of the $3.50 cup of 
cappuccino, to rustic Yucaipa, home of the $3.69 seven-course dinner at Mr. T's 
Family Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The 200-mile, round-trip journey, which requires transfers in downtown Los 
Angeles and San Bernardino, begins at 8 a.m., in sight of the churning Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Municipal's No. 10 Express is a sea of business suits half-hidden 
behind newspaper financial sections. No radios boom rock music here; a string 
quartet is more likely to be found on the "Big Blue Bus" as it rolls down the 
Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to drive too much -- I get too anxious," says Diane Allred, a 
Varig Airlines ticketing clerk. Allred, who is poring through a paperback 
collection of Plato, has taken the bus for two months since quitting a car 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
Across the aisle, architect Kenny Turner stares at the bumper-to-bumper 
commuters. "I guess it's the individualism of Los Angeles," he muses. "A lot of 
people like to be alone." 
</P>
<P>
Turner appreciates the 80-cent fare but wishes the express operated after 7 
p.m. He can't stand the slow, gritty RTD local, he says, and when he works 
late, "I usually call my wife, who has to come from Santa Monica and pick me 
up." 
</P>
<P>
From the Freeway Express stop at 1st Street and Broadway, Union Station is a 
short jaunt by DASH, the city's 25-cent downtown mini-bus service. 
</P>
<P>
At noon, The Desert Wind pulls out of the train station, ultimately bound for 
Chicago. Most passengers are on for the long haul, but not Glen Ratcliff, an 
administrator for a security firm specializing in rock concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he is headed for San Bernardino to submit a bid to provide security for 
the National Orange Show. He doesn't need the headache of driving, he says, 
although he's not looking forward to the trip back home either. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm taking the bus back because there's no return train. You know, it was 
awful hard to learn about the bus service. They keep you on hold forever -- 
with classical music. They're trying to improve the RTD image, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
As the Amtrak churns past tract homes, tumbleweed and lots cluttered with car 
carcasses, travelers in the full-service dining car lunch on hot turkey 
sandwiches. Ratcliff snoozes in his $15 one-way coach seat. 
</P>
<P>
Once in San Bernardino, a traveler is faced with one of the all-too-frequent 
problems with Southern California's mass transit system -- a dearth of adequate 
links between major service lines. Although the Amtrak station is several miles 
from downtown, only intermittent bus service is available. 
</P>
<P>
Once one reaches downtown, though, Yucaipa is a clear shot on the Omnitrans No. 
14, which offers a 63-mile tour of the Inland Empire for 60 cents. Some senior 
citizens ride the entire length from Montclair to Yucaipa for recreation. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling past orange groves, the bus arrives in Yucaipa in 90 minutes, just long 
enough for a traveler to stop for coffee before heading back to San Bernardino 
to catch the day's final Inland Empire Express bus to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The finale -- RTD Line 4 -- snakes down Santa Monica Boulevard. The commute 
costs 30 cents more than Santa Monica's Freeway Express and takes twice as 
long. 
</P>
<P>
On board are a short-order cook, a Creative Artists Agency security guard, a 
pair of homeless men and a plastics factory laborer. 
</P>
<P>
The ambience aboard Line 4 shifts between high tension and low comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no money, they robbed me, they always rob me," shouts a homeless 
transvestite climbing aboard at Wilcox Avenue and exiting three blocks later. 
"Yup, this is my stop. That's my bed out there -- that bus bench. Merry 
Christmas to you." 
</P>
<P>
At 9:45 p.m., the ocean is finally back in sight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DAY 2: The Mission to Santa Barbara 
</P>
<P>
Public transit between Los Angeles and Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties is extensive and well-publicized. 
</P>
<P>
But crossing into Ventura County -- where voters recently turned down a ballot 
measure to fund regionwide rail transit -- is like traversing an international 
frontier. 
</P>
<P>
Only four public buses provide service between Los Angeles and Ventura counties 
each day. What's more, there is no municipal bus link between Ventura and Santa 
Barbara counties. 
</P>
<P>
To reach Oxnard from downtown Los Angeles, a traveler climbs aboard RTD Local 
424, which rumbles down the long retail corridor of Ventura Boulevard in the 
San Fernando Valley on its way toward Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
During rush hour, the No. 424 bus is standing-room only, its riders primarily 
high school students and Latino domestic workers who commute daily to pricey 
Valley neighborhoods. The $1.10 journey takes two hours -- about 30 minutes 
longer than the early morning commuter express buses the RTD operates for 
inbound Valley residents only. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we spend more time on the bus than we work," muses Jona, a nine-year 
domestic worker. "But it's hard to find jobs nearer to home." 
</P>
<P>
From Westlake Village, the Ventura County Interconnect bus departs from 
Westlake Boulevard just north of Agoura Road. 
</P>
<P>
At the bus stop, a small blue sign features a drawing of a bus, but is 
otherwise generic. The sign does not state what bus stops there, who owns it or 
where it is going. The destination sign on the bus itself is similarly 
confusing. It reads "Antelope" rather than "Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
Only two people board the plush Interconnect, which descends down the 
picturesque Conejo Grade toward Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
To continue north to Santa Barbara, the only choice is Amtrak. However, the 
connection, the 9:55 a.m. South Coast Area Transit bus -- a clean, comfortable 
Grumman -- leaves Oxnard's Esplanade Shopping Center 10 minutes too late to 
link up with the 10 a.m. Amtrak commuter train. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the next train, a reservations-only "Coast Starlight," with 
service to Seattle through Santa Barbara, has an available seat. 
</P>
<P>
Australian backpackers Julie Heriot and Hamish George are aboard, on their way 
to San Francisco after a hectic two-week stay in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Public transit in Los Angeles is crazy, really," George says. "We looked into 
it and it didn't seem convenient. I presume that's why there's so many traffic 
jams on the freeway. We got caught once in the parking lot from Los Angeles to 
San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Barbara, the MTD bus service is the choice of college students, senior 
citizens and otherwise mobile residents whose cars are laid up in the repair 
shop. From the waterfront, one can make it to the historic Mission Santa 
Barbara in two short bus rides -- some seven hours after leaving Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DAY 3: The Cross-Town Survivors 
</P>
<P>
John Mills, 66, stands on a street corner in Skid Row, discussing the safety of 
RTD buses. 
</P>
<P>
"On the east-west lines there's not a lot of fights," asserts the retired City 
Hall maintenance supervisor, "And on. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Just then, a half-filled Budweiser can whizzes past Mills' head and crash-lands 
on the pavement. A scraggly bearded street person, who flung the beer for no 
apparent reason, resumes his conversation with another lost soul. Mills, 
awaiting the Wilshire Boulevard local after delivering groceries to an old 
friend in an SRO hotel, concludes his thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"On the north-south lines," he says, "You have your problems. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
In some Los Angeles neighborhoods, waiting at the corner for a bus can be a 
profile in courage. Climbing aboard, passengers add, is but the first step in a 
test of endurance. 
</P>
<P>
"There's too many people riding the bus, it's too crowded," declares Wanda 
Arrowhead, 80, after struggling for a seat on a late-morning Wilshire local. 
"They bring baby buggies on board, everything but the kitchen sink. And they 
stuff them in here like sardines." 
</P>
<P>
Others say that inner-city residents, many of whom are without their own 
wheels, seem more apt to be crammed onto aging, overcrowded buses than are 
suburbanites, whom transit officials hope to lure back to the mass transit 
system. Frequently, the windows of these buses have been scoured over so often 
to remove graffiti that it is no longer possible to see out of them. 
</P>
<P>
"The buses on the Westside tend to be much cleaner," says college student Emily 
Jeter, taking a break from a chapter in her Sociology textbook titled "Hidden 
Injuries of Class." "But (overall) RTD is pretty decent." 
</P>
<P>
Passengers on the city's busiest central city routes say that service has 
improved in the last few years. "The buses used to be pretty bad, but now 
they're pretty much on time," says Marva Martin, 51, a fund-raiser for the 
Watts-Willowbrook Boys and Girls Club. "But they do need to have security on 
the buses in the afternoon and at night. 
</P>
<P>
As the typical RTD bus rumbles through central city neighborhoods, the elderly 
tend to congregate close to the driver. Teen-agers move to the back. 
</P>
<P>
Because each bus route passes through a succession of neighborhoods, each 
claimed as the turf of a different street gang, bus transit can be a 
hair-raising experience shortly after public schools let out. 
</P>
<P>
"Safe? It depends on the neighborhood," says college student Tracey Railey, 19. 
"Sometimes gang members are waiting at the bus stop to see who is on the bus or 
if a person gets off with the wrong colors. Then they might start hassling 
them, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
Some riders say the safest mode of inner-city transportation is the new Blue 
Line, guarded by armed sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people who ride the Blue Line feel relaxed," said Damon Brown, 27, of 
Southeast Los Angeles. "It's quiet and clean. There's no violence. On buses you 
can see shootings. (On the light-rail cars), the deputies make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DAY 4: Tourists' Special 
</P>
<P>
What do Mickey Mouse ears, a ceramic Bart Simpson and an autographed copy of 
Richard Nixon's "Six Crises" have in common? 
</P>
<P>
A traveler bent on a break-neck public transit tour of Southern California can 
pick up all three souvenirs in one day, riding trolleys, trains and buses to 
Disneyland, Tijuana and the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
The journey begins at 6:20 a.m. on the Amtrak San Diegan at Union Station, 
which carries commuters to Orange County and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"How you doin,' teach?" smiles conductor Wayne Norwood as he checks tickets on 
a no-smoking car near the snack bar. 
</P>
<P>
Norwood is speaking to Marlys Marsteller of La Crescenta, an elementary school 
music instructor for the San Juan Capistrano school system. 
</P>
<P>
Each morning, Marsteller commutes two hours to work -- driving her car to Union 
Station, boarding the train and then hopping into her second car at the Orange 
County train stop. 
</P>
<P>
"I really like living in the mountains . . . so it's worth it," said the 
19-year teacher, who pays more than $400 in monthly fares and parking to ride 
on this moving kaffeeklatsch. "There's a whole group of us on the train that 
have become friends. There's a jewelry designer, an interior decorator and a 
management consultant. . . . We ride together every day." 
</P>
<P>
The No. 570 zips past surfers, the San Onofre nuclear power plant and the 
racetrack in Del Mar, arriving in San Diego just after 9 a.m. From there, it's 
a one-block walk to the San Diego Trolley. 
</P>
<P>
The highly successful light-rail system, in operation since 1981, carries a 
diverse mix of local residents and tourists on its $1.50-fare, 17-stop journey 
to the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
A quick walk across the border provides a traveler with a large array of 
ceramic shopping possibilities -- Bart on a skateboard, Bart on a surfboard, 
Bart on a football field. After making one's selections, the traveler simply 
strolls back through U.S. Customs to the trolley -- ignoring the crush of cars 
waiting impatiently to cross from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The return trip to Fullerton takes a little more than two hours, pulling into 
the Fullerton Transportation Center at 2 p.m. From there, one can catch the 
Orange County Transit District's No. 26 bus, which stops right in front of the 
Nixon museum. 
</P>
<P>
Don Sedor, a driver education teacher at Esperanza High School in Anaheim, is 
on the No. 26 headed back to Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"It's convenient for me and I feel I'm saving the environment some," Sedor 
says. "But once in a while I drive to school so I won't lose credibility among 
the students." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DAY 5: Orange County and the SuperBus 
</P>
<P>
The dearth of nighttime bus service is a common refrain among mass transit 
riders in Orange, San Bernardino, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everyone gets off work right at 5 p.m." says Carolyn Neu of Anaheim. 
"Sometimes you end up calling anyone you know to get home." 
</P>
<P>
Neu, an office worker waiting for the No. 51 bus outside Disneyland, believes 
that more frequent service would also help commuters who face waits for 
connections. "Now, you really have to plan out your schedule. I have to get to 
work 30 minutes early to get in on time." 
</P>
<P>
But in other ways, bus service in Orange County, appears to be user-friendly. 
Signs on buses include translations in Vietnamese as well as Spanish. And 
transit maps note that surfboards six feet and under are allowed on board. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Transit is also the operator of what is arguably the most 
futuristic, and impersonal, bus service in the region: the SuperBus, which 
leaves the Fullerton Park 'N Ride seven times daily for downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Introduced in 1987, the experimental contraption is a truck-and-trailer rig in 
which the driver, alone in a cab, keeps track of passengers via intercom and 
closed-circuit television. 
</P>
<P>
"I laughed the first time I saw it," says Janelle Dauphin, a para-legal from 
Placentia. "It looked like a cattle car or a moving van." 
</P>
<P>
Dauphin, 22, has since become a believer. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if it looks like a cattle car, I don't feel uncomfortable in it. I mean, 
I don't feel like a cow." 
</P>
<P>
The No. 721 provides a kaleidoscope view of the world out its oversized windows 
-- passing from middle-class Orange County to the Skid Row world of cardboard 
condos and tattoo parlors in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The final truth deals with timing. Scheduled to arrive at 5th Street and Grand 
Avenue in 45 minutes, the 5:29 p.m. SuperBus arrives several minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how up-to-date, it seems, a bus can't go any faster than the rest of 
the traffic on Southern California roadways. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Southland public transit riders, accustomed to standard bus service since the 
decline of the Red Car trolley system in the 1950s, now have several new 
options. Among them: Blue Line light-rail between Los Angeles and Long Beach; 
the San Diego Trolley; truck-and-trailer-style SuperBuses between Fullerton to 
Los Angeles, and daily commuter trains linking Santa Barbara, San Diego and 
Orange County with Los Angeles. In addition, the Metro Rail subway system is 
under construction. Regional transit planners, buoyed by last month's voter 
approval of a half-cent transit sales tax in Los Angeles and Orange counties, 
are proceeding with the purchase of Southern Pacific rights-of-way to operate a 
280-mile rail network linking Los Angeles, San Bernardino and the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Transit Traveler: A Day in the Life 
</P>
<P>
How fare can a Southern California tourist go in one day by public transit? A 
Times reporter starting in downtown Los Angeles learned that with ample 
planning and punctual service, one can make it to Tijuana, Disneyland and the 
Richard Nixon Library. The 12-hour journey, on trains, buses and trolleys, cost 
$34.80 in fares. 
</P>
<P>
1. Tijuana: From the San Diego Trolley stop in San Ysidro, a short stroll 
across the border affords a shopper a wide choice of Bart Simpson busts. 
</P>
<P>
2. Richard Nixon Library: The Orange County No. 26 bus stops in front of the 
Nixon Library, were autographed copies of the ex-president's literary works are 
on sale. 
</P>
<P>
3. Disneyland: Mickey Mouse ears are available just down the block from the 
Disneyland Monorail station.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vladimir I. Sorokoletov is a self-styled detective who tracks not missing 
persons but missing chicken legs and cans of sprats, and he claims to have 
solved the mystery of why there is so little food on the shelves of Soviet 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
He has seen what is in their basements. 
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old pensioner, inconspicuous in hat, overcoat and thick glasses, 
explores the locked freezers and back-room cupboards of his neighborhood's 
stores as part of one of Moscow's more innovative efforts to stem 
under-the-table dealings. He is one of the volunteer food police. 
</P>
<P>
"There is enough food," Sorokoletov asserts. "But they hide it all. There is no 
shortage, only a mafia that wants to see food rot in order to fill its own 
pockets." 
</P>
<P>
The former factory worker has been checking stores since August, but his work 
has taken on extra significance in recent weeks as the Soviet Union has 
appeared to edge closer to hunger and leaders have increasingly blamed sabotage 
and the black market rather than dwindling production. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow has about 1,000 volunteers like Sorokoletov, armed only with slips of 
paper from the city government giving them the right to check any warehouse, 
storage room or rail car where food might be concealed. 
</P>
<P>
Under a decree issued by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev last week, Sorokoletov 
and his colleagues, backed up by police or KGB agents, now have the right to 
ask that employees be fired or corrupt establishments be closed. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Sorokoletov inspected Store No. 57, a typical market in northeastern 
Moscow with sections for dry goods, alcohol, meat and dairy products. He found 
more evidence to support his theory. 
</P>
<P>
In the store's retail area, panicky shoppers in uneasy lines jostled for frozen 
pork, cheap boiled sausage and tins of vegetable oil. 
</P>
<P>
But down in the basement, assistant manager Valentina Popova, forced to open 
storeroom after storeroom at Sorokoletov's behest, revealed barrels of Turkish 
linseed oil and crates of coveted sprats (small, herring-like fish), Bulgarian 
champagne, Polish vodka, American chicken legs and Hungarian sausage. 
</P>
<P>
Sorokoletov nosed into boxes, rummaged in stacks of cardboard and peered behind 
piles of sacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Why is this fish down here and not being sold?" Sorokoletov asked, prompting 
Popova, a plump, curly headed woman wearing heavy blue eye shadow, to order 
stock boys to take the boxes of herring upstairs immediately. 
</P>
<P>
When he came upon the Hungarian sausage, he looked grave. "When did you get 
this?" 
</P>
<P>
"A long time ago," Popova admitted. 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't you sell it?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's for special orders." 
</P>
<P>
"But they are given out every week." 
</P>
<P>
"This is for holidays." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you have a written order to keep it for the holiday?" 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that she did not, just as she had no written excuse for holding 
back 300 pounds of buckwheat oats, 100 crates of cognac, 150 crates of vodka, 
60 crates of sprats and a crate of matches. 
</P>
<P>
Sorokoletov's detective work extended to the store's books as well. He pored 
through listings of special orders and found that the district Communist Party 
committee and local council got hefty special food supplies -- legal but 
indecently generous -- through Store No. 57. 
</P>
<P>
"That explains why you have so much wine and vodka," he said. 
</P>
<P>
More disturbing, however, was that KGB and police units also placed special 
orders through the store. 
</P>
<P>
Sorokoletov said that he has officially documented abuses and hoarding by such 
stores a dozen times, but that police never brought charges in spite of his 
proof. 
</P>
<P>
"Our faithful police don't want to bring retail employees to justice," he said. 
"Why? Because the police are very closely tied to retail trade." 
</P>
<P>
The police and KGB can control civilians, "but there is no one to control 
them," Sorokoletov lamented. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has little faith in Gorbachev's new decree, which mandates that 
groups of workers maintain tight control on food distribution, because the 
authorities will surely send Communist Party functionaries and other "people 
who are basically already corrupt" to check the stores. 
</P>
<P>
If actual workers, tired after a day of labor, made the checks, they would 
probably just fill a bag with food for their families and sign off on the 
inspection, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There will just be one more petty thief created," Sorokoletov said, "and we've 
all been taught to be thieves." 
</P>
<P>
Sorokoletov said he has discovered caches of sturgeon, crabs and cigarettes in 
stores. He told of finding a four-ton stash of canned meat and of preventing a 
2,200-pound shipment of rice from being driven away by black marketeers with 
false documents. But he has never managed to goad the police into action. 
</P>
<P>
Only when he turned to the newspapers, or to the people waiting in line, did he 
get any reaction, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he added, the most common reaction from the shoppers he is trying to 
help is, "Why do you bother? Nothing will change, and you'll only ruin your 
nerves." 
</P>
<P>
Why he bothers was easy to see when, as Sorokoletov sat sifting through the 
books at Store No. 57, an aged man hobbled into the director's office and 
begged to be sold a bottle of wine. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an invalid of the war and I just want a bottle for the holidays," he said. 
"I'm not a drunkard." 
</P>
<P>
Popova went off to order the stock boys to unload more wine, and Sorokoletov 
said angrily: "They load things slowly on purpose so people will give up and 
leave. Then it will all go to the local council or the police or whoever they 
need it to go to. That's the mafia. How can the KGB and the police catch it 
when it feeds them?" 
</P>
<P>
The common ruse among corrupt salespeople, he said, is to make sure goods 
remain unsold until they begin to rot. Then they write off double or triple the 
amount that actually went bad and sell the rest on the black market. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow officials say the scale of the "retail mafia" has been greatly 
exaggerated, and that shortages stem mainly from panic buying. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't believe the people who tell you that," Sorokoletov said.

EVIDENCE OF BLACK HOLES DISCOVERED BY JURY-RIGGED SHUTTLE TELESCOPES; 
</P>

LESSONS TO STUDENTS VIA TELEVISION LINK.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists on Friday bypassed two faulty computers aboard the space shuttle 
Columbia that had jeopardized a historic astronomy mission. They also reported 
major discoveries, including stunning evidence that black holes lurk at the 
hearts of active galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of a second computer Thursday left the crew unable to control 
telescopes aboard the shuttle, and scientists feared they were not going to get 
the results they had hoped for from the long-awaited Astro astronomy mission. 
</P>
<P>
But, employing somewhat crude techniques, several hundred people on the ground 
in Texas and Alabama teamed up with orbiting astronomers to turn the tide in 
favor of science. 
</P>
<P>
The telescopes are now being guided from the ground and then fine-tuned by the 
astronauts, and elated scientists said Friday that they were getting better 
data than they had dreamed possible just hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to go in this morning," said astronomer Morton Roberts, "but, 
when I got there, everybody was ecstatic." 
</P>
<P>
The new process takes more time than the automatic computer-driven system that 
was supposed to point the telescopes and keep them locked on the targets, so 
scientists will not be able to look at as many objects as they had hoped. But 
they will look intensely at the things they do focus on. 
</P>
<P>
Both computers shut down after they overheated, leaving the crew with no way to 
give the telescopes the precise commands needed to point them at the right 
targets. So that function was taken over by Mission Control at the Marshall 
Space Flight Center here. Then, the astronomers aboard the shuttle used a joy 
stick, which resembles a control panel for a video game, to nudge the 
telescopes into exactly the right position and keep them locked on target. 
</P>
<P>
No one was sure it would work, but, by most measurements, it did so quite well. 
</P>
<P>
The astronauts took time out from their work Friday to finally realize the late 
Christa McAuliffe's dream: teaching a lesson from orbit, explaining the wonders 
of astronomy and urging schoolchildren to study math and science. 
</P>
<P>
The lessons from space were beamed down to televisions in classrooms across the 
nation in a project to show students how astronauts live and work in orbit and 
to describe the value of studying the entire electromagnetic spectrum to learn 
more about the structure and evolution of the cosmos. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm talking to you from the space shuttle Columbia orbiting 200 miles above 
the surface of the Earth," astronomer Samuel Durrance said as he began the 
space lesson from Columbia. "I'd like to talk to you today about space, 
astronomy and the electromagnetic spectrum." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, select groups of seventh- and eighth-graders were gathered at the 
Marshall Space Flight Center here and the Goddard Space Flight Center in 
Greenbelt, Md., to observe the lesson. 
</P>
<P>
By using satellite dishes, students across the nation were able to watch the 
lesson live in their classrooms in an unprecedented effort to highlight science 
education. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-minute lesson, entitled "Space Classroom: Assignment the Stars," was 
taught by Durrance and astronaut Jeffrey Hoffman, who took their students on a 
brief tour of the shuttle. Questions from the students were answered by 
astronaut Robert Parker and astronomer Ronald Parise. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are interested in this sort of work and would like to learn something 
about it yourself and perhaps participate in the Space Age in the future, my 
recommendation for all of you students listening is to continue to study hard . 
. . read a lot about astronomy and space, and maybe you can help answer some of 
these questions that we've been talking about," Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's space lesson took place nearly five years after the Jan. 28, 1986, 
explosion of the shuttle Challenger that killed all seven aboard, including 
McAuliffe, a New Hampshire schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Carter, an eighth-grader from Memphis, Tenn., said the country "is sort 
of regaining from the Challenger explosion. This has probably put more hope in 
all of us. I feel better now that we've got something going compared to the 
explosion." 
</P>
<P>
The Astro observatory aboard the Columbia consists of four telescopes that 
study ultraviolet light and X-rays, which cannot penetrate Earth's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The four telescopes, each with different strengths, allow scientists to study 
objects simultaneously, but in different ways. Meanwhile, other teams are 
studying the same objects from ground-based observatories. All that data will 
eventually be compiled, giving scientists a more comprehensive view of the 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the telescopes found strong evidence that mysterious objects known as 
black holes do exist, although no one will ever be able to see them. 
</P>
<P>
Theorists have long held that black holes power galaxies that emit copious 
amounts of radiation, so-called active galaxies, and there has been some 
evidence to support that. Black holes are thought to be so dense that a 
spoonful would weigh as much as Earth, and their gravity is so great that even 
light cannot escape. 
</P>
<P>
A black hole should have a powerful impact on its neighbors, ripping nearby 
stars apart and pulling in the debris like a giant whirlpool in space. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are concentrating on finding features in the disks of material 
swirling around objects believed to be black holes. The disks should emit such 
things as X-rays created in the violent destruction of material as it is swept 
toward the black hole. 
</P>
<P>
Astro's Broad Band X-Ray Telescope was trained on one galaxy, called Markarian 
335, that is thought to be harboring a black hole. The result, said astronomer 
Peter Serlemitsos, the instrument's principal investigator, "tells us that 
indeed there are likely to be giant black holes," because the sensitive 
instrument found exactly what theorists had predicted it would find if the 
galaxy has a black hole at its center. 
</P>
<P>
This telescope does not produce pictures. Instead, it produces a "spectrum" 
that shows the characteristics of the light emitted by the target. Light, for 
example, discloses the chemicals present when the light was produced. 
</P>
<P>
The X-ray telescope also measures the level at which X-rays are being produced 
by the target, and, according to theory, that level should rise enormously near 
a black hole because more material is being ripped apart in the violent 
process. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a dramatic announcement Friday, Serlemitsos said the data collected by 
his instrument amounted to "undisputed evidence that this upturn does indeed 
take place." 
</P>
<P>
Farther out from the region where the X-rays are being produced, the swirling 
gas and dust around a black hole should emit ultraviolet light. And another 
instrument aboard Columbia, the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope, found that to be 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
"He sees the hottest stuff," said Arthur F. Davidsen, principal investigator on 
the Hopkins telescope, referring to the region that produces Serlemitsos' 
X-rays. "I see the stuff that's on its way." 
</P>
<P>
Davidsen said data collected by his telescope fits nicely with the X-ray 
evidence, with one picking up where the other leaves off. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to pull them together, and bingo!" Davidsen said. 
</P>
<P>
Will that prove that black holes exist? 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt that anybody will ever come up with absolute proof," Serlemitsos said. 
"Instead, you will have an accumulation of evidence" that is very convincing. 
</P>
<P>
So, although nobody will ever "see" a black hole, two telescopes aboard 
Columbia searched a closer part of the neighborhood than anyone has been able 
to visit before. Davidsen stopped short of claiming total success for his own 
experiment, but he said of Serlemitsos': 
</P>
<P>
"His data looks fantastic to me."

PERU'S FUJIMORI DELIVERS A JOLT, WEATHERS STORM 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alberto Fujimori astonished Peruvians when he leaped from political obscurity 
to win the presidency. His first four months in office have been equally 
astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
In his boldest move, Fujimori jolted the country with an austerity "shock" 
against rampant inflation that sent the monthly rate racing to nearly 400%, but 
has reduced it since to less than 6%. The shock stunned the already depressed 
economy and added to the hardship of Peru's poor majority. 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori, 52, has weathered the storm without firm backing from established 
political parties. He has played one group against another, often startling the 
nation with his blunt pronouncements. 
</P>
<P>
He has chided the Congress for wasting time in sterile debates. He has 
criticized judicial inefficiency and corruption, referring to judges as 
"jackals." He has quarreled with powerful Roman Catholic bishops over birth 
control, calling a sector of the church "medieval." 
</P>
<P>
"He tends to upset rice bowls," said a diplomatic observer. 
</P>
<P>
The president refuses to meet with his second vice president, Carlos Garcia 
Garcia, an evangelical Protestant leader. Garcia had helped muster key 
electoral support for Fujimori among Peru's well-organized evangelical 
movement, but the two quarreled after the president declined to name any 
evangelicals to the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
For similar reasons, Fujimori has fallen out with his own political movement, 
Change 90, which won 46 seats in the 240-member Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Rospigliosi, a political scientist with the Institute of Peruvian 
Studies, said Fujimori's power is based on the strategy of dividing political 
forces, "playing them off against each other." 
</P>
<P>
Rospigliosi said Fujimori has built a relationship with army intelligence 
officers and uses it as a power base. The armed forces governed Peru from 1968 
to 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori, an agronomy professor and former university rector, defeated famed 
novelist Mario Vargas Llosa for the presidency. Vargas Llosa had made the 
mistakes of allying himself with discredited political parties and advocating 
an economic shock against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori, in contrast, emphasized his political independence and kept his 
economic promises vaguely moderate and upbeat. But there is nothing moderate 
about his so-called Fujishock, imposed by decree in early August. 
</P>
<P>
To stem inflationary deficit spending by the government, he ordered steep hikes 
in subsidized prices for public utilities and petroleum products. The price of 
gasoline increased 30-fold overnight, and other prices also multiplied. 
</P>
<P>
The result: Monthly inflation, out of control at more than 60% in July, reached 
397% in August; but it quickly subsided to 14% in September, and 5.9% in 
November. Hoping to maintain the downward trend, the government has severely 
restricted the amount of money in circulation. 
</P>
<P>
National production in August fell 15% from July, said Armando Caceres, an 
economist with a private think tank known as GRADE. A rash of looting and 
disturbances followed the shock, but analysts say Fujimori's popularity saved 
Peru from widespread price riots. 
</P>
<P>
An 18-day strike by civil servants, protesting low wages and other austerity 
measures, fizzled this week. Strike demonstrations brought disorder on the 
streets, but the government continued to function and Fujimori made no 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts say the government must soon begin tax, monetary and customs 
reforms that are needed to follow through on the Fujishock. They question 
whether the president's economic team, put together rapidly after his election, 
has the depth of experience to carry out such a complex package of reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the government can control inflation and revive the depressed economy, 
it will remain in a weak position for controlling two other major problems, 
cocaine traffic and guerrilla warfare. 
</P>
<P>
Peru is the world's leading producer of coca leaves, the raw material of 
cocaine, and 200,000 families depend on it for their livelihood. The largest 
coca-growing areas are guarded by the Maoist guerrillas of the Sendero 
Luminoso, or Shining Path, movement, whose decade-long war has cost about 
20,000 lives.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia

<TEXT>
<P>
Serbia's date with the ballot box Sunday will end one of Europe's few remaining 
one-party regimes, but the election also provides a last chance for Yugoslavia 
to reconsider its headlong rush toward disintegration and civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Serbia is the last of Yugoslavia's six republics to expose communism to a 
competitive vote. While the multi-party ballot is a sign of democratic 
development, the forces for peace and unity are expected to lose. 
</P>
<P>
Four Yugoslav republics that held elections earlier this year stripped the 
Communists of their parliamentary majorities, voting instead for nationalists 
pursuing independence from Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
In Serbia, by contrast, communism and nationalism have worked hand in hand. 
</P>
<P>
The Serbian Socialists, as the former Communists are known, have won strong 
support among the 6.8 million voters by vowing to settle old scores with rival 
Croatia and by subjugating ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
The leading opposition group, the radical Serbian Renewal Movement, has made 
the same promise of Serbian supremacy, while casting the former Communists as 
despots who will stop at nothing to stay in power. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential contender Vuk Draskovic said on the final day of campaigning 
Thursday that a 30-year-old supporter was slain while hanging political posters 
in the southern town of Vranje. 
</P>
<P>
A victory by either of the front-running parties would probably encourage the 
wealthy and westward-looking republics of Slovenia and Croatia to step up 
efforts to secede from the federation, which they say is controlled by Serbian 
bullies. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's army remains under the command of orthodox Communist generals, 
predominantly Serbs, who have threatened to use force to prevent secession, 
which would probably unleash a civil war. Armed conflict in the volatile 
Balkans would pose a threat to others in Europe, as borders established only 
this century would be called into question. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Veljko Kadijevic warned this week that the army favors 
socialism, heightening fears of a military coup. 
</P>
<P>
Federal unity and peaceful negotiation of differences are the aims of the new 
party of federal Prime Minister Ante Markovic, the Alliance of Reformist 
Forces. But the moderates have been virtually ignored in Serbia's vitriolic 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, a hard-line Socialist, on 
Wednesday condemned the prime minister's party for trumpeting "ideas of a false 
Yugoslavism, the aim of which is to make people afraid of Serbia and the 
Serbian people." 
</P>
<P>
Draskovic, whose black beard and dreadlocks evoke the image of Rasputin, wound 
up his campaign with a fiery appeal to followers for calm in the face of 
provocation. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to have bloodshed because this is the only way for them to retain 
power," he said of the Socialists. "I beg you not to retaliate." 
</P>
<P>
By week's end, Draskovic was said to be running an even race with Milosevic, 
the early favorite. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen opposition parties last week threatened a boycott, charging that the 
former Communists were monopolizing the media and packing vote-counting panels. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 opposition parties are challenging the Socialists, portending a 
divided assembly that would be unable to exert its will over the other 
republics, heightening Serbia's sense of isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia -- the republics that have 
already held elections -- want Yugoslavia reshaped into a loose confederation 
of independent states, like the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Most Serbs insist on a strong federation, with their capital of Belgrade 
continuing to wield central authority. That position is supported only by tiny 
Montenegro, the sixth republic, which has always moved in lock-step with 
Serbia. Montenegrins also go to the polls on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Serbs, who number about 9 million, are the largest ethnic group in Yugoslavia, 
a nation formed in 1918 from remnants of the Ottoman Turkish and 
Austro-Hungarian empires. Today, Yugoslavia's 23 million people remain divided 
by nationality, language, alphabet, culture and religion.

The aircraft carrier Ranger and seven escort ships will leave their home ports 
in San Diego and Long Beach today for deployment to the Middle East, the 
Pentagon announced. 
</P>
<P>
The carrier, with about 75 aircraft on its flight deck, will join three others 
already supporting Operation Desert Shield in the northern Arabian Sea, the Red 
Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
Two other carriers -- the America and the Theodore Roosevelt -- are scheduled 
to leave from Norfolk, Va., after Christmas to complete a doubling of American 
carrier strength in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, two ships sailed from Southern California. The Horne, a guided 
missile cruiser carrying 400 people, sailed from San Diego at 9:30 a.m., Navy 
spokesman Clint Duncan said. The Jarrett, a guided missile frigate with 185 
aboard, left Long Beach Naval Station at 8:50 a.m., spokesman Mike Perron said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Army said Friday that elements of the 2nd Armored Cavalry 
Regiment have begun arriving in Saudi Arabia from their base in Nuremberg, 
Germany. It did not say how many of the approximately 5,000 troops in the 
regiment have arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The Army also announced that it alerted an undisclosed number of National Guard 
and Reserve members in 10 states to be prepared to report for active duty for 
Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Corps announced the call-up of 334 reservists from California and 
Georgia. Those from California are to report for active duty Dec. 18 at the 
Marine Corps Air-Ground Combat Center at Twentynine Palms; those from Georgia 
are to report to Camp Lejeune, N.C., on Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy said it activated 289 reservists from 15 states and the District of 
Columbia.

Instead of slicing open 5-year-old plastic ration pouches, American troops on 
patrol at the front lines in Saudi Arabia soon will be able to eat meals as 
fresh as packaged, preservative-laced food can be. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has placed a $260-million order for nearly 190 million entree 
side-dish packs for its basic battlefield ration in a move to preserve and 
build up dwindling supplies of the food soldiers carry into battle. 
</P>
<P>
That's about a six-month supply of food for a force of 400,000 eating three 
meals a day. 
</P>
<P>
The contracts were let this week to seven food suppliers throughout the country 
and include dishes such as spaghetti with meat sauce, ham slices, chicken a la 
king, omelets with ham, chicken stew and beef stew. 
</P>
<P>
The troops at the front have been using up meals at the rate of about 1 million 
a month, and Lorraine Netzko, a spokeswoman for the Defense Personnel Support 
Center in Philadelphia, which issued the contracts, said officials decided that 
although they had stockpiles for the event of war and had no supply concerns 
for a year, they should start building up the stockpiles again. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the Defense Logistics Agency has been shipping out meals packaged in 
1987, 1988 and 1989. Some troops took with them meals put together in 1984 and 
1985.

NATO ENDS SESSION, AGREES TO FOCUS ON NEW 'OUTSIDE' THREATS

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, citing a "profound transformation" in 
Western Europe's security situation, on Friday identified aggression by Iraq 
and instability in Eastern Europe as threats that must dominate alliance's 
future planning. 
</P>
<P>
In another development of significance to NATO, Secretary of Defense Dick 
Cheney revealed that he has decided to remove permanently from military 
aircraft a Europe-based nuclear-tipped missile called SRAM-2. He said they pose 
safety hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney had ordered the missiles removed from "alert status" in June after 
receiving reports that the weapons could leak radioactive material if they were 
caught in a fire. In announcing their permanent removal Friday, Cheney 
acknowledged that the SRAM's safety problems cannot be corrected easily. He 
added, however, that the missiles would be available for use in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
In two days of meetings here, NATO defense ministers focused mostly on newly 
perceived threats to the alliance. But they also agreed that the organization 
must keep some forces deployed in traditional roles in Europe in spite of the 
disappearance of old Cold War confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in a non-adversarial relationship, prudence requires NATO to 
counterbalance residual Soviet military capabilities, and risks to alliance 
security can also rise from instability in East and Central Europe and from 
elsewhere," the defense ministers said in a final statement. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting marked the first time that NATO leaders have agreed to address 
problems that until now have been considered outside the alliance's charter. 
</P>
<P>
These problems include possible actions to forestall the economic collapse of 
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. NATO's position on Iraq, backed by 
Cheney's appeals for additional help for Operation Desert Shield, also could 
lead the way toward an alliance role in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said that allies offered "generally favorable" responses to his requests 
for more combat forces and logistical support in the gulf. But many allies have 
been reticent to act jointly in addressing that crisis or the economic turmoil 
of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, for instance, Spain opposed a proposal to send a joint NATO 
naval force to Egypt to underline the alliance's concern about developments in 
the Middle East. The opposition has effectively torpedoed the proposal for now, 
NATO officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said that Operation Desert Shield is likely to speed the permanant 
shrinkage of U.S. forces in Europe. Many of the American units sent from Europe 
to the Middle East will probably return directly to the United States, Cheney 
told reporters after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers also agreed that NATO can make "further dramatic 
reductions" in its nuclear forces in Western Europe. But they insisted that it 
must continue to base modern nuclear weapons in Europe to keep the peace.

INTIFADA AFTER 3 YEARS: PALESTINIAN UPRISING SHOWS VIOLENT NEW FACE; 
</P>
<P>
ISRAEL: THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE RECENT SHOOTINGS ARE DIRECTED OR 
SPONTANEOUS.

RAMALLAH, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shots in the dark sounded in this middle-class university town last week and 
Palestinian observers began suggesting that the wave of Arab violence directed 
at Israelis was not a passing fever but a trend. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts disagree on whether the armed violence is directed or spontaneous. But 
they concur that the incidents of shooting and knifing are changing the face of 
the intifada, or Arab uprising. They fear that the outbreak signals the end of 
the "white" intifada, as the uprising is known, the one marked by the limited 
violence of hurled stones and efforts at civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
What will follow is still at issue, but it is clear that moderate voices of the 
uprising have been sidelined in the conflict, which marks its third anniversary 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, in a plea for concrete political steps to reduce Israeli-Palestinian 
tension, Palestinian political leader Faisal Husseini told an Israeli audience: 
"We are living in the jungle. In a year or two, perhaps you will not have me to 
talk to but someone else, someone versed in the ways of the jungle." 
</P>
<P>
Husseini, who is considered the voice of the moderates, insisted that armed 
violence is still the work of out-of-control individuals. But he warned: "Each 
day, the question stands whether this is the way to go." 
</P>
<P>
The Palestine Liberation Organization is leaning toward armed violence, some 
observers contend. Daoud Kutab, a nationalist journalist, commented: "There is 
pressure within the PLO for the use of arms. Moderates face the problem of 
condemning the violence and losing support in the street or going along with it 
and losing Israeli and international sympathy." 
</P>
<P>
A leaflet from the pro-PLO underground leaders of the uprising urged 
Palestinians this week to use "all means" in battling the Israelis. It was 
widely interpreted as a call for the use of guns. 
</P>
<P>
Three nighttime shootings in 24 hours jarred moderate Palestinian activists. In 
one, gunmen sprayed an Israeli bus carrying settlers north of Ramallah, 
wounding three passengers. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a 
Marxist PLO faction, claimed responsibility for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important to revise Palestinian policies, tactics and practices and to 
step up the intifada on the economic and military level and to support it with 
fire," a communique from the organization said. 
</P>
<P>
In a second incident, someone fired on an army jeep from the direction of a 
mosque in Ramallah. And in the third, a Ramallah pharmacist, Hussein Saed, was 
found shot to death in his store. 
</P>
<P>
Saed was not involved in politics and no motive for his killing was evident. 
But Palestinian observers took his death to mean that Palestinian frustrations 
could soon turn into a form of class warfare as economic hardships worsen. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, at least some Palestinian analysts believe that the PLO is urging 
an escalation of violence to ensure that the uprising remains a focus of 
attention and is not swallowed up by the global focus on the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"If the intifada cools, it is no good," said a well-informed political analyst 
here, who asked that his name not be published. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, almost all Palestinians attributed armed violence to passions 
unleashed by the October killings of 20 Palestinians by police at Jerusalem's 
Al Aqsa mosque. The bloodshed set off a wave of intercommunal violence between 
Jews and Arabs, and the fever has lasted longer than expected. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the past year, the intifada has been on a helter-skelter search for 
a new direction without much success. "The mood is grim," said Bernard Sabella, 
a Bethlehem University professor. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the year, it appeared that peace talks might get under way through an 
American-devised plan and the intifada would have achieved a major goal. That 
possibility fell apart when Israel's Labor Party, led by doves, failed to seize 
power from the rightist Likud, led by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who 
rejected talks. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinians began to sense that the intifada had reached the limit of its 
power to move events and some activists began to look outside for inspiration. 
It came in the person of Iraq's Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Hussein pledged to burn half of Israel with chemical weapons if 
attacked and became an instant hero among frustrated Palestinians. With his 
invasion of Kuwait, Hussein rose higher in esteem, although certain harsh 
realities began to set in. Economically, the Palestinians suffered from 
cutbacks in money sent from relatives who work in Kuwait and from a reduction 
in financial support from Arab countries opposed to Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Fatigue has led to fewer mass rallies and mass activities in the uprising. 
Small groups carry on the bulk of visible resistance, including the throwing of 
stones at Israeli traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial strikes are still called and superficially adhered to but, more and 
more, stores stay open through the back door and workers labor in secret. The 
notion of civil disobedience -- setting up alternative institutions to Israeli 
rule, resistance to Israeli bureaucracy and taxes -- became a dead letter. 
Danny Rubenstein, an Israeli reporter who has followed the intifada, wrote: 
"This isn't the intifada we knew. Palestinian organizations have gone back to 
setting bombs and carrying out armed attacks; civil disobedience has died out." 
</P>
<P>
But if not violence, what will be the next phase of the intifada? Palestinians 
say everything is on hold until the gulf crisis ends. "All eyes are on Saddam 
Hussein," said political scientist Mahdi Abdul Hadi. 
</P>
<P>
Israel is debating whether the spate of shootings reflects impulse or plan. 
Defense Minister Moshe Arens has attributed the spasm to growing Islamic 
fundamentalism and enthusiasm aroused by Saddam Hussein. Whatever the cause, he 
issued a blunt warning this week: "Israel will shoot back."

IT'S NOW 'LADY THATCHER,' BUT SHE'LL STICK WITH 'MRS.'

<P>
Queen Elizabeth II awarded former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher the coveted 
Order of Merit on Friday and made her husband a baronet, which is a hereditary 
knighthood. 
</P>
<P>
From now on Denis Thatcher will be formally addressed as Sir Denis and his wife 
as Lady Thatcher, although she insisted Friday she wished to be known simply as 
"Mrs. Thatcher." 
</P>
<P>
"I have done pretty well out of being Mrs. Thatcher," said the former prime 
minister, who resigned Nov. 22 during a fight for the leadership of the 
Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
Palace insiders said Friday that one reason for the quick award of the Order of 
Merit, restricted to only 24 eminent men and women, was the queen's desire to 
demonstrate that there is no animosity between Britain's two most prominent 
women. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Buckingham Palace sources and journalists assigned to the royal 
court have said that the two did not get along. 
</P>
<P>
"This puts (to rest) rumors that the queen and Mrs. Thatcher didn't like each 
other," said Harold Brooks-Baker, director of Burke's Peerage and an authority 
on the royal family. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Order of Merit, created in 1902, Thatcher joins such 
luminaries in the world of arts, science and politics as philosopher Isiah 
Berlin, historian Veronica Wedgwood, writer Graham Greene, violinist Yehudi 
Menuhin and artist Sidney Noland, as well as honorary member Mother Teresa. 
</P>
<P>
Deceased recipients include Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Gen. Dwight D. 
Eisenhower, missionary Albert Schweitzer and actor Lawrence Olivier. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to some reports, the OM, as it is popularly called, does not precede 
all other British royal honors but ranks behind the Order of the Garter, which 
dates from 1348. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher said she was "deeply honored and moved" by the award. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the queen gave a baronetcy to Thatcher's husband Denis, the 
subject of fictional letters from No. 10 Downing Street invented by the 
satirical magazine Private Eye about life as the prime minister's consort. 
</P>
<P>
Baronets date from 1611. Sir Denis' title passes upon his death to his son, 
Mark, who is married to an American, and will eventually pass to Mark 
Thatcher's son, Michael. 
</P>
<P>
With an OM, Thatcher can continue to serve in the House of Commons as the 
member from the North London constituency of Finchley. 
</P>
<P>
Burke's Brooks-Baker believes that Thatcher eventually should be made a 
hereditary countess, which in Britain is the female equivalent of an earl. 
Traditionally, retiring prime ministers of Britain were granted earldoms, 
although Churchill, for one, refused a peerage, preferring to remain in the 
House of Commons.

The United States is speeding up $48.1 million in military aid to help the 
government fight guerrillas who have acquired sophisticated, Soviet-made 
missiles and used them to shoot down two Salvadoran warplanes, the State 
Department said. Administration officials said a spent canister from a 
Soviet-made A-14 surface-to-air missile has been found near the area where one 
of the aircraft was destroyed. The previously budgeted aid will allow the 
government to replace aircraft and equipment damaged or destroyed in the 
attacks, which began Nov. 20.

A plane chartered by the United Nations left Switzerland with 20 metric tons of 
food and medicine for Liberia, where aid workers said hungry orphans were 
wandering through the ruins left by civil war. A team for the U.N. Disaster 
Relief Organization said that the city of Monrovia, with a population of 
350,000, had neither food nor health care. "Of particular concern are the 
registered 90,000 children, of which 10,000 are orphans, many wandering 
aimlessly through the city, reduced to skeletons because of malnutrition," the 
U.N. team said in an statement issued in Geneva.

MILK STIMULANT HORMONE FOUND SAFE BY FEDERAL PANEL; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: A GROUP OF DOCTORS AND VETERINARIANS REPORTS THAT THE SYNTHETIC 
MATERIAL HAS NO IMPACT ON THE NUTRITIONAL QUALITY OF DAIRY PRODUCTS OR MEAT.

Milk and meat from cows treated with a synthetic growth hormone that increases 
their milk production are safe for consumption, a federal advisory panel said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The experimental use of recombinant bovine somatotropin, a synthetic version of 
a growth hormone that occurs naturally in cows and their milk, has raised 
concerns about the possible health implications for humans who consume products 
from treated cows as well as for the animals themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a new technology," said Dr. Melvin Grumbach, emeritus chairman of the 
department of pediatrics at UC San Francisco and chairman of the panel. "There 
is a lot of concern . . . about the safety in terms of our food chain and in 
terms of the health of the dairy cows." 
</P>
<P>
But the panel of medical and veterinary experts, which was convened by the 
National Institutes of Health, concluded that the milk and meat from treated 
cows are safe for humans and that the hormone has no impact on the nutritional 
quality of the products. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not like an antibiotic. This is not like a synthetic steroid," 
Grumbach said. "This is a variant of a natural hormone we all have circulating 
in our blood." 
</P>
<P>
The group acknowledged, however, that it based its judgments on available data 
and did not have access to a large body of information involving the drug's 
effect on animal health that is under review by the Food and Drug 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The panel agreed that the hormone "does not appear to affect appreciably the 
general health of dairy cows," but it called for more research in that area, 
particularly on the incidence of mastitis, or udder infection. 
</P>
<P>
The panel said that use of the hormone "can be a very important management tool 
for American dairy farmers." 
</P>
<P>
Consumer and public interest groups criticized the panel's findings. 
</P>
<P>
"We remain unconvinced . . . that the use of bovine growth hormone in dairy 
animals poses no threat to human or animal health," said Michael K. Hansen, a 
research associate with the Consumer Policy Institute, a division of Consumers 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers Union earlier this week urged the FDA to reconsider its 1985 decision 
that milk from treated cows was safe. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seriously concerned that the data now in public hands may not present a 
complete picture of human and animal health problems," Hansen added. 
</P>
<P>
Food Animal Concerns Trust, a Chicago-based public interest organization that 
deals with issues affecting the livestock and poultry industry, charged that 
use of the hormone would cause more animal disease. This, in turn, would result 
in a greater use of antibiotics to treat the ailments and would further 
increase "dangerous residues" of antibiotics and other veterinary drugs in milk 
and beef, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is widespread disease throughout the U.S. dairy herd because of the 
demands put on each cow to produce abnormally high quantities of milk," Robert 
A. Brown, president of the organization, said. "If you use (bovine growth 
hormones) to increase milk production even further, you will get more disease, 
more veterinary drug use and more drug residues in our food supply." 
</P>
<P>
At least four U.S. companies are seeking FDA approval to commercially market 
the drug. Monsanto Co., one of those seeking approval, Friday praised the 
panel's report. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope this finding will be reported to all American consumers so that they 
continue to feel confident that the milk they enjoy is safe and wholesome," 
said Lee A. Miller, vice president of the company's animal sciences division. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's decision should "quiet . . . critics who have tried to create 
needless concern among consumers about (the hormone's) safety," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the drug is currently in experimental use only, the FDA has declared 
the products safe and has allowed milk from treated cows to enter the regular 
food supply. FDA officials said, however, that milk from treated cows makes up 
about only 1% of the milk supply.

A General Accounting Office official said Friday that a more equitable formula 
for distributing federal Medicaid dollars to states would result in 30 states 
losing money but 19 needier states receiving more funds. 
</P>
<P>
The funding formula for Medicaid, the government's health insurance plan for 
the poor, is unfair because it is based on states' per capita income, Janet 
Shikles of the GAO told a House Government Operations subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Shikles said a more accurate picture of a state's ability to fund its share of 
Medicaid could be drawn if the formula considered the state's total revenue 
income and poverty rates -- not per capita income. She said that the GAO was 
also suggesting that the federal government's guaranteed share be reduced to 
40% from 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Under the GAO plan, 30 states would be losers and 19 would be winners, with 
figures unavailable for Arizona or the District of Columbia. Nine of the 19 
states would receive an additional $100 million or more, Shikles said. 
</P>
<P>
In the GAO proposal, Florida would be the biggest winner financially, netting 
51% more funds, and Wyoming would be the biggest loser, receiving 61.7% less. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate why per capita is a poor indicator of a state's poverty level, 
Shikles paired Arkansas and Utah, which have almost the same average per capita 
income. The formula treats them as if they had the same poverty rate, but 
census data shows Arkansas with a poverty rate of 32% and Utah, 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Among the states that would receive more money under the GAO proposal are 
California, with an 8.8% increase; New Mexico, 19.1%; New York, 12.1%, and 
Texas, 27%. Included in the states that would lose money are Alaska, a 39.6% 
decrease; Colorado, 12.6%; Hawaii, 15.2%; Nevada, 20.7%; Oregon, 0.7%, and 
Washington, 4.4%. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO has been presenting its view on the funding formula to Congress since 
1983. But Gail Wilensky, administrator of the Health Care Financing 
Administration, which runs Medicaid, said no changes in the formula should 
occur until there are discussions for overhauling the entire program. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, who testified he wants the federal government to 
halt Medicaid mandates for two years, said that he is all in favor of the 
formula change, acknowledging that it would hurt many states. 
</P>
<P>
"The formula should be changed," Clinton said in an interview. "If you do it on 
a per capita basis, it obscures the (existence) of poor people in New York and 
California," he said, referring to two of the 19 states that would see 
increases in federal dollars under the proposed formula.

U.S. JOBLESS RATE RISES TO 5.9%, A 3-YEAR HIGH; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: SOME SEE NOVEMBER FIGURES CONFIRMING FEARS THAT A MODERATELY SEVERE 
RECESSION HAS HIT.

<P>
The nation's rapidly slowing economy shed 267,000 jobs in November, causing 
unemployment to rise to a three-year high of 5.9%, the Labor Department said 
Friday in a report that confirmed for many economists their fears that the 
long-heralded recession has arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate, although still well below the levels recorded during the 
last recession in 1982, was the highest since just after the 1987 stock market 
crash. The rate has jumped 0.6 of a percentage point in 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
"This report proves conclusively that the economy is in recession and that it's 
not going to be short and sweet, but moderately severe," said Bruce Steinberg, 
a Merrill Lynch economist in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The number of gainfully employed Americans fell by 450,000 in November, 
according to a Census Bureau survey of U.S. households. But the government 
reported that 168,000 people dropped out of the labor force, resulting in a net 
increase in unemployment of 282,000. 
</P>
<P>
The discrepancy between the employment and jobless numbers reflects an 
inevitable byproduct of recession: In economic downturns, many people stop 
looking for work and the government stops counting them as part of the labor 
force. 
</P>
<P>
The government's companion survey of payroll employment in manufacturing, 
construction, services and government showed losses in every sector except 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The overall decline of 267,000, the worst monthly job loss since the depths of 
the 1982 recession, was considerably greater than expected. The November loss 
followed an October drop in payroll employment of 178,000, for a combined 
two-month total of 445,000. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the brunt once again was borne by the manufacturing sector, which 
has lost more than 800,000 jobs since January, 1989. The decline in factory 
payrolls, as industries scramble to cut costs and hold down inventories, was 
200,000. The slumping auto industry alone accounted for 54,000 layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The construction industry lost 62,000 jobs, reflecting a slump in commercial 
real estate that has hit depression levels in the Northeast and is accelerating 
rapidly on the West Coast. Construction unemployment and the loss of defense 
jobs contributed to a big jump in unemployment in California, to 6.7% last 
month from 6% in October. 
</P>
<P>
The slump extended to the service sector, which once was thought to be 
relatively immune to business cycle contractions but has lost jobs for two 
months in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding a small gain of 3,000 in government employment, mostly at the state 
and local levels, private-sector service industries sloughed off 15,000 jobs. A 
gain of 59,000 new jobs in medical services -- perhaps the only recession-proof 
sector of the economy -- was more than offset by 68,000 lost retail jobs and 
smaller declines in financial services. 
</P>
<P>
The retail employment slump was caused by smaller than expected seasonal 
hiring, as department stores hunker down for a holiday shopping season expected 
to be dismal. 
</P>
<P>
"Just about every industry had a decline in jobs except health care," said 
Steinberg, the Merrill Lynch economist. "And, while manufacturing industries 
are more sharply down, as is the case in every recession, in this case we are 
seeing services down more than usual. The mix of this slowdown may be different 
than in the past." 
</P>
<P>
To some analysts, that different mix was cause for muted optimism. Because the 
job losses in manufacturing have been so steep at a time when inventories have 
been at historically low levels at the outset of a recession, they said that 
the worst could be over soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a sense that, with some hopes of a non-military solution in the Persian 
Gulf, with oil prices and interest rates lower, you could see a rebound in 
consumer confidence in December," said economist Lawrence Kudlow of Bear 
Stearns in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be seeing the economy drop this quarter, but there is a good case to be 
made for improvement early next year," added Giulio Martini of Sanford 
Bernstein &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Martini noted that inventories in goods-producing industries are very lean, 
increasing the probability of a production upturn as soon as consumers start 
buying again. Some of those consumers are overseas, and exports should be 
stimulated by the devalued dollar, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Martini noted that the big drop in retail employment was in part a seasonal 
adjustment caused by less hiring of temporary holiday workers. The reverse of 
that process should occur in January, when smaller post-holiday layoffs should 
produce a statistical recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most anticipated recession in history," Jerry Jordan of First 
Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles observed. "Unless there is war in the Middle 
East, we think this negative sentiment can reverse about as quickly as it 
started."

<P>
Howard Allen Schneiderman, who led Monsanto Co., UC Irvine and St. Louis' 
Washington University in the development of biotechnology and genetic 
engineering, has died. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
Schneiderman died Wednesday at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis after suffering 
from leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
He was chief chemist and senior vice president of research and development at 
Monsanto. He had been dean of the School of Biological Sciences at UC Irvine 
before going on leave to join Monsanto and Washington University of St. Louis 
in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, he was awarded the UCI Medal, highest honor of the Irvine campus, for 
significant contributions to the university's development. In nine years at 
Irvine, Schneiderman was credited with increasing the university's research 
funding, recruiting top professors and guiding expansion of the university's 
Developmental Biology Center. 
</P>
<P>
He also was named by former President Ronald Reagan to the National Science 
Board, the policy-making arm of the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Schneiderman held central roles in both the arena of academic research and 
in the industrial sector," said Frank Press, president of the National Academy 
of Sciences. "He knew that American industry needed to be competitive and the 
government policies necessary to achieve the goal. He was a major figure in 
American science." 
</P>
<P>
Schneiderman was teaching at UC Irvine when he was elected to the National 
Academy of Sciences, the highest accolade for U.S. scientists. Informed of the 
honor by then-Chancellor Daniel G. Aldrich Jr. at a surprise champagne party, 
the low-key Schneiderman reacted: 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my goodness gracious Jones! I'm really proud of this." 
</P>
<P>
He was elected to the academy for his studies and research in the fields of 
insect physiology, endocrinology and development. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Schneiderman told his academic colleagues that his years at 
Irvine had been "the most productive years of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Schneiderman joined Monsanto under a $62-milllion joint research partnership 
between the company and Washington University -- which has led to more than 40 
patents. 
</P>
<P>
Under his leadership, Monsanto built its Life Sciences Research Center for 
Biotechnology Research in Chesterfield and moved into the technology of mixing 
genes from different species to develop new crops, veterinary drugs and other 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Richard J. Mahoney, chairman and chief executive officer at Monsanto, said: 
"Howard, more than anyone, helped set a direction for the company in the 
biological sciences, which is serving us extremely well. We are fortunate that 
the course he helped set will continue to guide Monsanto well into the 21st 
Century. We will miss him deeply." 
</P>
<P>
Schneiderman was the author of more than 200 published papers on scientific 
subjects, including developmental biology and genetics, insect biochemistry and 
plant growth, and was an adjunct professor at Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
Schneiderman was born in New York. He got his bachelor's degree from Swarthmore 
College and both his master's degree in zoology and doctoral degree in 
physiology from Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Audrey; a son, John, of Irvine and a daughter, 
Anne, of Ithaca, N.Y.

JACKPOT WINNER FINDS LIMELIGHT IS GLARING; 
</P>
<P>
LOTTERY: TOM TEHEE, WHO WON $45.3 MILLION, FACES A ROOM OF REPORTERS AND TV 
CAMERAS LIKE A CONDEMNED MAN FACING A FIRING SQUAD.

<P>
The gilded doors of the Biltmore Hotel's Corinthian Room opened grandly, the 
television camera lights beamed and Tom Tehee faced the world for the first 
time Friday as the biggest single winner in California Lottery history. 
</P>
<P>
The jackpot was $45.3 million -- after taxes, that's $4,964 a day, $207 an hour 
for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
He was an overnight millionaire, but he looked more like a condemned man facing 
a firing squad. 
</P>
<P>
The limelight is not exactly home to Tehee, a 34-year-old security dispatcher 
from Upland, who squirmed in his best blue suit as a wall of reporters spit out 
questions in the latest rat-race-to-riches lottery success story. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you feel winning all that dough?" someone asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Nervous as can be" Tehee said dryly, apparently more smitten by the TV cameras 
than the $1.8-million check he will receive annually for the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you going to do with it all?" 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
Never mind kicking up his heels, Tehee scarcely managed a smile as his wife, 
Kathy, chattered about a new house, travel abroad and a possible Ivy League 
education for their 20-month-old son, Justin. 
</P>
<P>
Justin, dressed for the occasion in a black velvet tuxedo and red satin bow 
tie, clapped his hands wildly and tried to take a bite out of the podium 
microphone. But his father stood, partly paralyzed, seemingly in shock, 
promising to take care of his parents and in-laws for the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Tehee didn't think he was buying all this attention when he walked into the 
Cork and Can liquor store in Ontario at 9:45 Wednesday morning and spent $5 on 
a Quick Pick ticket. The lady ahead of him had just purchased $100 in tickets. 
(Had she purchased $105, lottery officials remarked, this would be a different 
story.) 
</P>
<P>
The next day, it was announced that someone from Ontario had won the jackpot 
but no one had stepped forward to claim it. Tehee, who works the night shift, 
was asleep Thursday when the news broke. 
</P>
<P>
He stopped into a Downey liquor store Thursday afternoon to buy a Diet Pepsi. 
Kathy Tehee waited in the truck with the baby while her husband checked the 
numbers matter-of-factly. Then he checked them again. Then he ran out to the 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh my God," he told his wife. "Look . . . look!" 
</P>
<P>
Neither of them believed their eyes, so they went back inside and let the store 
clerk check. The only thing Tehee had ever won in his life was when he hit the 
lottery for $86 last month. 
</P>
<P>
"I was ecstatic," he said flatly. 
</P>
<P>
Tehee's new title as biggest single lottery winner supplants Sherman Oaks 
accountant Ralph Laird, whose 10-number computerized strategy won $27.58 
million last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was pretty heady for lottery officials as well, who said sales had 
been slacking until they came up with bigger jackpots to entice players. 
According to Ulysses Carter, manager of the lottery's Whittier office, $24.9 
million was spent this week by people hoping to do what Tehee did. 
</P>
<P>
A blue limousine, courtesy of lottery administrators, arrived Friday to drive 
the Tehee family to the unveiling at the downtown Biltmore. A white limo, 
courtesy of Tom Tehee, carried several family members and friends, who acted as 
sort of an entourage as Tehee took his place in history. 
</P>
<P>
He wouldn't even consider quitting his job, which, along with his wife's income 
as a police dispatcher, brings in about $50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
He might consider buying a new truck, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no reason to quit, no reason at all," he said bluntly, scurrying away 
from the podium and retreating to an empty banquet room with his family and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
"No press!" was all Tom Tehee was heard to say as the doors to the Roman Room 
slammed shut. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, he's stoical all right," lottery official Carter said. "The last guy who 
did this said $25 million wasn't going to change him. He was driving an old 
Ford at the time. When he came to pick up his first check, he was in a gold 
Mercedes with all the trimmings. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of weeks later he came to the office to ask a question. He pulled up 
in a new Corvette."

LOTTERY SALES SLUMP WILL REDUCE SHARE TO EDUCATION 
</P>

<P>
The failure of a new Lotto game to produce a record-breaking jackpot combined 
with a softening economy has caused a sales slump at the California Lottery 
that officials predicted Friday could reduce the game's contribution to 
education next year by as much as $280 million. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the lower than expected sales already have forced them to cut 
$59 million from their administrative budget by severely reducing advertising, 
declaring a hiring freeze and postponing equipment purchases. 
</P>
<P>
"We are cutting as close to the bone as we can," said Joanne McNabb, the 
lottery's public affairs director. "It's what many businesses are going through 
now. Any business whose sales are down below expectations is looking to cut." 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said sales, totaling $880 million since the beginning of this fiscal 
year, are 5% below the goal for the period. Given this trend, coupled with 
expectations that the economy will continue to decline, McNabb said officials 
are estimating that total sales by the end of the fiscal year will range from 
$2 billion to $2.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
That would provide only $700 million to $800 million for education next year as 
compared to the $980 million the lottery provided this year, McNabb said. Under 
state law, the lottery must allocate at least 34% of its revenues to education. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Lange, public relations director for the California Department of 
Education, said the drop in lottery money would come at a time when schools are 
experiencing tremendous enrollment growth. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be really damaging to districts especially now when many of them have 
become dependent on their lottery money because of the lack of revenue from the 
state," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the lottery was intended to provide "extras" for school districts, but 
many districts in recent years have used proceeds to provide "necessities" as a 
way of balancing their budgets. 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said officials are attributing the slow lottery sales to the same 
nemesis that dogs many of their players -- bad luck. The Lotto game was changed 
in midsummer to produce more of the big jackpots that drive up sales. While the 
change provided some very large jackpots -- four were more than $30 million 
since July 1 -- it did not produce the super jackpots of $70 million or more 
that drive sales up significantly, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We did have a turnaround in the downward trend of Lotto sales and that was a 
good sign," McNabb said. "It just went more slowly then we would like." 
</P>
<P>
In other states that have changed their Lotto games, she said the big explosion 
in sales did not come until there was a jackpot that broke the record for that 
state. In California, the biggest jackpot has been $68 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike many other businesses in this economy," McNabb said, "we have a luck 
factor. What's happened in other states is that the sooner they've hit a record 
jackpot after the change (in Lotto), the sooner their sales have taken off. 
It's our bad luck that we haven't had that." 
</P>
<P>
The change in the game required players to choose six numbers from a field of 
53 instead of 49, making it nearly twice as hard for players to win but also 
adding to the potential size of the prizes. 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said officials also believe economic conditions have been a sales 
factor, but they have no way of determining how much of a factor. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that our lottery has been in an economic downturn," she 
said. "This is new territory for us." 
</P>
<P>
Within the agency, McNabb said advertising will take a particular hit as a 
result of the sales slump. She said television advertising of Decco and Topper, 
two games of chance introduced this year, has been stopped and the advertising 
of Lotto, which produces two-thirds of the lottery's revenue, has been reduced. 
</P>
<P>
She said 50 vacant positions in the department have not been filled and will be 
recommended for elimination. 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said officials believe the volume of lottery ticket sales could rise 
dramatically if there is a record-breaking jackpot or if a game to be 
introduced next spring does exceptionally well. The game, to be called Little 
Lotto, would allow players to chose six numbers from a field of 39. The top 
prize would be $500,000 paid immediately in cash. The Lotto jackpots are paid 
over a 20-year period. 
</P>
<P>
McNabb said revenue projections for Little Lotto have been conservative because 
similar games have had mixed results in other states.

Defendants in a child molestation case that produced the longest sentences in 
state history have been freed because of appellate rulings that their 
convictions were improper. 
</P>
<P>
One of the last to leave prison was Ricky Lynn Pitts, who was greeted by his 
wife and teen-age daughters when he was set free Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"No words can describe the happiness I'm feeling," Pitts said. "it's unreal. 
Six and one-half years in prison and having your girls taken away for something 
you didn't do -- it's unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Pitts' wife, Marcella, was released Wednesday. They and five other defendants 
had been serving prison sentences of 285 to 405 years on a total of 377 counts. 
</P>

The Pitts case was one of the most sensational of several multi-defendant Kern 
County child molestation cases in the early 1980s. They led to a state attorney 
general's report criticizing the methods of investigators, especially for 
asking children leading questions.

14 UNLICENSED CONTRACTORS CAUGHT IN 'STING' OPERATION; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: STATE INVESTIGATORS GO UNDERCOVER TO ARREST GROUP OF MASONS 
AND LANDSCAPERS IN PALMDALE. THEY FACE FINES AS HIGH AS $1,000 AND YEAR IN 
JAIL.

Investigators for the Contractors State License Board conducting an undercover 
"sting" lured 14 masons and landscapers to a house in Palmdale this week on the 
pretext of hiring them, then arrested them for allegedly working without a 
contractors license. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators targeted workers whose names were provided by licensed 
contractors angry at being underbid by unlicensed competitors, said an official 
of the state licensing board. 
</P>
<P>
"They are tired of losing jobs to these individuals," said Dennis Bishop, 
supervising deputy of the board's Unlicensed Activity Unit. "They operate on a 
little lower monetary level as far as their bids are concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The unit, formed in October, 1989, has conducted 15 similar undercover 
operations in Southern California this year, Bishop said. The operation in 
Palmdale netted the largest number of arrests in the unit's history, and was 
the first in the Antelope Valley, where the booming construction business 
attracts unlicensed contractors. 
</P>
<P>
In the Palmdale sting, investigators took names and phone numbers they received 
from irate licensed contractors in the area and made 21 appointments over a 
three-day period, from Tuesday to Thursday, at a house borrowed for the 
operation. When a contractor arrived, one of the investigators posing as the 
owner described landscaping or masonry work he wanted done, and the contractor 
made a bid on the job. 
</P>
<P>
"We ask them for a contract, and they write it up," Bishop said. When the 
contractor was unable to provide a license number, he was placed under arrest 
by one of two members of the unit who are sworn peace officers. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the contractors provided false numbers, which the investigators easily 
identified by checking records in Sacramento by phone. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen people were arrested, and if convicted for the misdemeanor offense 
face fines of as much as $1,000 and a year in jail. The arrested were released 
on their own recognizance and will be arraigned in Antelope Valley Municipal 
Court on Jan. 3 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
Unlicensed contractors can work for less because they usually pay their 
employees in cash, and often do not pay taxes or have worker's compensation 
insurance, Bishop said. The consumer may lose in the long run, he said, because 
the licensing board can make a contractor redo a shoddy job, but the only 
recourse against unlicensed contractors is to sue. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, because many unlicensed contractors have no worker's compensation 
insurance, the homeowner becomes liable for injuries to the workers. 
</P>
<P>
Contracting industry spokesmen praised the board for the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
"The unlicensed people are part of the underground economy," said Mike Leeson, 
executive vice president of the American Building Contractors Assn., noting 
that they are not required to pay many of the fees or post the $5,000 bond 
licensed contractors must shoulder. "They're the scum of the earth." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dave Burwell, vice president of the High Desert Chapter of the California 
Landscaping Contractors Assn.: "It's not that unlicensed people are bad people, 
because some of them really do nice work." But, he added, "most people that are 
involved in landscape scams do not have a license."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPICIOUS HOUSE FIRE KILLS 2 MEN, INJURES 
1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspicious early-morning fire swept through a one-bedroom home in the Lennox 
area Friday, killing two men and injuring another, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The dead, reported to be undocumented workers in their late 20s, were not 
immediately identified because of the extent of their burns, the coroner's 
office said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were living in a small house in the 10700 block of Inglewood 
Avenue, along with five other men. 
</P>
<P>
The house was burning furiously when firefighters arrived at around 3 a.m., 
fire officials said. After putting out the blaze in about 20 minutes, searchers 
found one man dead in the bedroom. The other was found in a sleeping area on 
the back porch. 
</P>
<P>
The fire apparently started in the kitchen and was of suspicious origin, a 
Sheriff's Department spokesman said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 800 PUPILS EVACUATED AFTER DISCOVERY OF 
BOMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 800 children were evacuated Friday from the Del Sur Elementary School in 
Lancaster after discovery of a potentially lethal time bomb, made by a 
10-year-old boy who said he learned how from a TV secret agent show, the 
sheriff's bomb squad said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was unable, however, to determine when the bomb was timed to explode, 
which turned out to be minutes after they confiscated it, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
A boy wearing a Bart Simpson T-shirt was taken into custody after admitting he 
built the bomb from model rocket engines and a digital alarm clock. He said he 
used information from an episode of the "MacGyver" TV show. The show's producer 
said there was no such episode. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb was discovered by third-graders in the boys' restroom shortly after 10 
a.m. and exploded by the bomb squad on the school playground at 11:05, just six 
minutes before it would have gone off, a deputy said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LUGGAGE CARTS NOW FREE FOR LAX FOREIGN 
TRAVELERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move to make Los Angeles International Airport more "passenger-friendly," 
Mayor Tom Bradley announced this week that luggage carts are now available free 
of charge to travelers arriving from foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
Until this week, tourists from abroad and others arriving at the airport's Tom 
Bradley International Terminal had to pay $1 to rent the carts, which are 
generally free at the nation's other major airports. 
</P>
<P>
"Now those who come into this terminal are going to be able to get their 
luggage out of this terminal without any further complaints to me and I'm happy 
about that," Bradley told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
For those travelers who did not carry U.S. currency, arriving at LAX was often 
a frustrating experience because they had to claim their baggage and go through 
Customs -- sometimes a drawn-out ordeal -- before they could exchange their 
money and retrieve a cart. 
</P>
<P>
Now, travelers will be able to collect a cart as soon as they disembark.

POLICE RESPOND TO HOAX, SHOOT MAN AT HIS HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROXANA KOPETMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long Beach police, believing that they had spotted a kidnaper with a gun, shot 
a man Thursday night as he was opening the door to his home. But there was no 
kidnaper, no victim and no gun, police now say. 
</P>
<P>
They acknowledged Friday that they shot an innocent man and that the call about 
a kidnaping was bogus. 
</P>
<P>
The hoax was part of a bizarre tale that led police to the West Long Beach home 
of the Randall family, where everyone had just finished eating dinner when 
William Randall thought he heard a knock on the door. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even remember opening the door all the way and wham!," said Randall, 
who was shot once in the left leg, above the knee. He spent the night at a 
local hospital and was back home by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"(The officers) kinda like stared at me. It was a 'what now, oops'-type 
situation," said Randall, a 24-year-old college student who had arrived home 
for Christmas vacation only a few hours before the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Jose Yarruhs, a 4 1/2-year veteran, accidentally shot Randall because 
he was startled when the door opened, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Yarruhs and Officer Kimberly Krabbe arrived at the Randall home about 9 p.m. 
Thursday, after a caller told police that a kidnaper was holding a woman there. 
</P>
<P>
Yarruhs looked through a window and thought he saw a man carrying a gun, 
according to Homicide Detective Roy Hamand. The officer began to prop open the 
screen door. According to police, Randall heard the noise and opened the door 
abruptly. Randall, however, said he heard a knock on the door and opened it 
casually. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the officer) was scared and startled when the door opened. And he was 
in a position where he thought someone was being held against her will," Hamand 
said. Police found no gun at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, the officer "told me to go outside and I told him I wasn't 
going anywhere," Randall said. Shortly after, he said he went into shock. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the Police Department are 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach police also were looking Friday for the woman who made the false 
report of a kidnaping. Police believe that she is a distant relative of Randall 
but declined to identify her. 
</P>
<P>
The call apparently stemmed from a domestic squabble in which the woman called 
to say that her sister-in-law had been abducted and was being held at the 
Randall home. Police and Randall said they had no idea what prompted the hoax. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Randall was recovering from his wound and trying to understand what 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
"How could something like this happen?" Randall said. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have made a call or investigated what's going on. They were 
working on 100% hearsay," Randall said. "It seems to me (the officer) should 
have been more careful."

CHEYENNE BRANDO NOT COMPETENT, COURT RULES; 
</P>
<P>
MURDER CASE: TAHITI DECISION DIMS PROSECUTION'S HOPES FOR HER TESTIMONY ABOUT 
BROTHER'S ROLE IN THE DEATH OF HER LOVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Marlon Brando's daughter, Cheyenne, has been declared mentally incompetent by a 
French court in Tahiti, dimming prosecutors' hopes of calling her as their star 
witness in the upcoming murder trial of her brother, Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Although the trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 14, this latest development 
increases the likelihood of a plea-bargain agreement. Defense attorney Robert 
Shapiro has said from the outset that a guilty plea to a reduced charge of 
manslaughter would be appropriate, but sources close to the case say that 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven Barshop wants to exhaust all efforts to bring the 
young woman back to Los Angeles before deciding whether to take the case to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
"We've taken the position all along that our trial will go forward with or 
without Cheyenne . . . (but) both sides know she is a very material witness," 
Barshop said. 
</P>
<P>
Cheyenne Brando's mother, Tarita, was appointed as her guardian Thursday, after 
a judge reviewed a psychiatrist's report as well as evaluations by doctors who 
treated Cheyenne during five recent hospitalizations and two suicide attempts. 
She remains hospitalized after attempting to hang herself from a tree last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"She was placed yesterday under conservatorship," her attorney, Michael 
Nasatir, told Santa Monica Superior Court Judge Joel Rudof Friday. "She has 
been declared incompetent to handle her own affairs" or to care for her newborn 
son. 
</P>
<P>
Rudof issued a tentative ruling that he will sign a letter asking French 
authorities to cooperate in returning her to California. Armed with the letter, 
prosecutors say they could then serve her with a federal subpoena and, if she 
did not appear as ordered, seize up to $100,000 in her U.S. assets. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the legal obstacles are cleared and she wants to testify, the final 
decision would rest with her mother, as her guardian. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they are still awaiting the results of a psychiatric 
examination ordered by a French magistrate in connection with charges against 
her in Tahiti for being an accessory to the murder of her lover, Dag Drollet. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a difference between a civil conservatorship and a competent witness 
to testify in a court -- a lot of legal distinctions," said Barshop, explaining 
why he is pressing on in light of her being declared incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
Drollet was shot to death by her half-brother, Christian Brando, last May 16 at 
the Brando family's hilltop estate in Bel-Air. Christian Brando maintains that 
the shooting was an accident; Cheyenne Brando, who had gone to dinner with him 
the night of the shooting, told police it was murder.

YOUNG CANCER PATIENTS WRAP UP A MAGIC WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Christmas music chimed through the Glendale Galleria. Santa Claus jounced 
toddlers on his knee. And seven children with cancer, four of them from Mexico 
and three from Los Angeles, were on a shopping spree arranged by Los Angeles 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
"How about some of these?" Officer Gilbert Escontrias asked Mike Dighero, 
holding up a pair of jeans for the frail, 6-year-old Boyle Heights boy. 
</P>
<P>
The little boy looked less than thrilled -- then he caught sight of something 
else. 
</P>
<P>
"El nino Bart Simpson!" he shouted, ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he left the mall, Mike sported a Bart Simpson T-shirt and warm-ups, 
a Mickey Mouse hat and a pair of Reeboks. The rest of the group walked out with 
packages full of Barbie dolls, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Air Jordans and a 
Nintendo game. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising had brought the glamour of brand names into East Los Angeles 
housing projects and even into dirt-floored homes in Mexico, where the onetime 
expense of a black and white television yields years of entertainment. But 
until Friday, for these seven families, the money to buy such products had 
remained out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, children who had never seen a department store, and in two cases, 
parents who had never shopped anywhere but public markets in a town square, set 
out for the mall. Each family had a mission to spend more than $250, which was 
raised by the Hollenbeck community relations unit of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. The shopping spree was the climax of a five-day trip to Los Angeles 
that included outings to Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm, and, for one 
15-year-old boy, an artificial leg. 
</P>
<P>
Such sprees are conceived as once-in-a-lifetime voyages into happy oblivion, a 
magical few hours where poverty and illness are left behind. On Friday, in 
fact, children seemed to forget the chemotherapy treatments and all the painful 
months in hospitals. They were no longer kids with cancer; they were kids at 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Separated from their parents for part of the spree on the assumption that they 
would feel freer to buy what they really wanted without supervision, they asked 
excitedly for things whose names they had heard on TV, or from friends. 
Meanwhile, their parents -- a mom or dad accompanied each child on the trip -- 
were each given $100 to spend on themselves and their families back home. 
</P>
<P>
The children started out in a shoe store, where the six boys each asked for 
favorite brands, in some cases according to the stars (Michaels Jackson and 
Jordan) who had endorsed them. Raudel Gonzalez of Jalisco, Mexico, who lost one 
leg to cancer last June, couldn't stop smiling as he explained to the clerk 
that he was about to get another foot for the Nike that was left in the shoe 
box. 
</P>
<P>
The only girl, Rocio Romero, 13, spurned "boys' shoes," and chose a pair of 
low-slung black boots. Rocio, who comes from a small town outside Guadalajara, 
said all her family shopping is done in the public market in her small town. 
She gazed longingly at a $69 confection of pink nylon lace, but chose a more 
practical outfit, barrettes for her older sisters, and a neon T-shirt that said 
"California" across the chest. 
</P>
<P>
During this trip, children, who had never met one another and had little in 
common except those things they prefer to forget, turned into a kind of 
extended family. One frail 10-year-old, Salvador Gudino, who did not speak when 
he arrived, learned to use a telephone at the motel where they were staying, 
and kept ringing his new friends just to say hi. His mother, Juana Torres, 40, 
who described herself as a peasant with 10 children, went around saluting 
police officers with a "high five." 
</P>
<P>
In the Glendale Galleria, cancer proved easier to forget than poverty. 
</P>
<P>
As the boys walked through the aisles of a toy store, Officer Maria Martinez 
suggested that they avoid toy cars with batteries. The children understood 
instantly; batteries wore out and at home there would be no money for more. 
</P>
<P>
The three fathers, left alone to shop with their $100 bills, chose gifts for 
their wives and outfits for the children left at home. 
</P>
<P>
The mothers, however, walked through J.C. Penney almost without touching 
anything. They glanced at one another over the counters full of holiday 
trinkets and assorted perfumes. They wended their way past ties for Dad and 
sequinned tops for New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Still, they bought nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Torres and Elisa Romero, Rocio's mother, each have nine other children at home. 
Mike's mother, who lives in a housing project in Boyle Heights, has four other 
children. Would it be possible, they asked politely, to take the cash and spend 
it elsewhere? The store the police officers had chosen for its low prices was, 
they said, for "monied" people. 
</P>
<P>
On the way out, Romero, in one impulsive moment, picked up a small box of 
gift-wrapped perfumed soaps for $7. Guilt flashed across her face. But, after 
the tough going, even the toughened, a mother with the 10 mouths to feed, 
wanted to go shopping. Just this once. 
</P>
<P>
She smiled shyly at her companions. Then she handed the clerk her single, crisp 
$100 bill.

</P>
<P>
Phoenix (8-7) has lost three in a row, while the SuperSonics (5-10) ended a 
six-game losing streak with a 105-103 victory over Miami on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we need this type of player," Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons said of 
McDaniel before the Suns beat New Jersey, 129-110, Friday night. "He's tough, 
physical and an outstanding offensive rebounder, which is an area we need help 
with." 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSonics also said they were happy with the trade. 
</P>
<P>
"Eddie Johnson is instant offense," club President Bob Whitsitt said. "He is 
one of the league's best pure shooters. And this will allow (Coach) K.C. Jones 
to reposition some of our players to their more natural roles." 
</P>
<P>
When the SuperSonics lost, 106-100, Friday night in Orlando, Derrick McKey 
started at small forward and Shawn Kemp at power forward. McKey played power 
forward last season and also has played that role this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Xavier has definitely been a big plus for the Sonics' organization," Whitsitt 
added. "On the basketball court, we're giving up offense and getting offense 
plus two No. 1 picks in return. But in the community, X has been wonderful for 
us and we wish him the very best." 
</P>
<P>
In return for McDaniel, 27, the SuperSonics will receive the Suns' first-round 
draft pick in 1991 and a first-round choice in either 1993 or 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns have two picks in 1993 and will give Seattle the better one if it is 
not a lottery pick. If it is, then the SuperSonics will get the Suns' top 
choice in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel was leading Seattle in scoring with a 21.8-point average. The 6-foot-8 
forward has averaged 20.6 points in his six-year pro career. He was an All-Star 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a nine-year pro, has been the Suns' top player off the bench in recent 
years. He averaged 16.9 points last season after averaging 21.5 and earning the 
NBA's sixth-man award in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
This season, he has averaged 13.5 points in 15 games, but has not been asked to 
score as much. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 31, learned about the trade 75 minutes before the Suns took the court 
against the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known it was coming," said Johnson, who sat in his Suns' uniform 
answering questions. "You can tell. People act differently. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been sensing it over the past week. Once we started struggling, I knew 
something was going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he expected that either he, Tim Perry or Kenny Battle would be 
traded. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives me new life and a chance to go show what I can do," Johnson said. 
"My role changed here from last year in the playoffs to now. I wasn't asked to 
score, so I tried to work on my defense." 
</P>
<P>
With McDaniel, the Suns will probably start a front line of McDaniel, Tom 
Chambers (6-10) and Mark West (6-10) along with Jeff Hornacek and Kevin Johnson 
at the guards. Chambers had played with McDaniel at Seattle before signing with 
the Suns as a free agent.

UCLA OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF IMPEDING PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A UCLA assistant chancellor has been accused of trying to suppress information 
for an NCAA inquiry into the recruiting of Bruin basketball star Don MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Hirsch, a former UCLA assistant basketball coach, said he was told it 
would be in his best interest to stop his attorney, Jerry Roth, from talking 
with an NCAA investigator. 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch, who assisted Walt Hazzard, said his supervisor at the time of the 
incident, John Sandbrook, assistant chancellor and executive assistant, issued 
the order last March. 
</P>
<P>
Such an order would be a violation of NCAA rules against unethical conduct. 
</P>
<P>
"That is categorically untrue," Sandbrook said Friday. "I'm deeply disappointed 
that such an untrue statement would be made." 
</P>
<P>
When Hazzard was fired after the 1987-88 season, Hirsch was reassigned and 
finished his career at UCLA working as an administrative analyst in Sandbrook's 
office. His contract was not renewed last summer and he filed a personnel 
grievance against the university. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said he was contacted by the NCAA last March about MacLean. Roth, who once 
represented Hazzard in contract negotiations, said he told an investigator he 
would consider answering questions. 
</P>
<P>
While deciding what to do, Roth said, he received a call from Hirsch on 
Sandbrook's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack told me that he was asked by Sandbrook to contact me (Roth) and intervene 
after the NCAA contacted me about Don MacLean," Roth said. "They wanted Jack to 
influence me from not giving any information. Jack told me he would not 
intervene." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA contacted Roth about allegations of minor recruiting violations 
involving MacLean that were reported in the book, "Raw Recruits." 
</P>
<P>
According to the book, written by Alexander Wolff and Armen Keteyian, UCLA 
Coach Jim Harrick signed MacLean to a national letter of intent during a 
48-hour pre-signing period although the high school All-American from Simi 
Valley was expected to sign the next day. 
</P>
<P>
A Pacific 10 investigation found no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick said in a statement: "The matter has already been investigated. I 
suggest anyone interested in this to talk to (Associate Commissioner) David 
Price of the Pac-10." 
</P>
<P>
MacLean declined to be interviewed but issued a statement: "Almost a year ago I 
was questioned by the media regarding my recruitment by UCLA. I stated at that 
time there were no irregularities. The Pacific 10 Conference investigated the 
matter and were satisfied there were no violations." 
</P>
<P>
NCAA officials have not pursued the matter since the initial contact with Roth 
and a subsequent conversation with UCLA Athletic Director Peter Dalis. 
</P>
<P>
Dalis told The Times last spring: "It's been investigated and nothing was ever 
found. That's the end of it." 
</P>
<P>
But Sandbrook's involvement could be investigated if it were proven that he had 
knowledge of recruiting violations, said David A. Didion, an NCAA investigator. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have a lot of suspicions," he said. "I would want to go to the school 
and say 'let's undo this. What is it (Sandbrook) doesn't want us to discuss?' " 
</P>
<P>
Didion said NCAA officials need evidence pointing to Sandbrook before launching 
an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"A staff member could have any number of reasons for telling someone not to 
talk to someone," Didion said. "We'd need something to sink our teeth into 
(before pursuing)." 
</P>
<P>
Sandbrook has been with UCLA since 1967 and has been Chancellor Charles Young's 
special assistant since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had no knowledge of MacLean's recruitment. He said he is involved 
with radio and television contract negotiations pertaining to UCLA athletics. 
He also advises the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Assn. and the Pac-10 on TV 
contracts for the Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can tell you is I know very, very well what responsibilities a 
university administrator has with respect to the conduct of an intercollegiate 
athletic program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch was the chief assistant during Hazzard's four seasons at UCLA. He 
recruited MacLean until Hazzard was fired in March of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick, who coached at Pepperdine, was hired to replace Hazzard and continued 
to recruit MacLean until signing him. 
</P>
<P>
Sandbrook said he thinks there is a connection between the personnel grievance 
filed last summer by Hirsch and this week's accusation. 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch has requested an arbitration hearing through UCLA's employee-grievance 
process to determine whether his job in Sandbrook's office amounted to a 
violation of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
He is expected to have a formal hearing in January or February, said Darlene D. 
Skeel, UCLA's director of public information. Skeel and Sandbrook would not 
discuss the specifics of the case because it is a personnel matter. 
</P>
<P>
Although the grievance will be limited to UCLA's contractual agreement, 
Christine Masters, Hirsch's labor attorney, said other issues such as wrongful 
termination, misrepresentation and discrimination might be pursued. 
</P>
<P>
"The grievance hearing is not designed to be the ultimate remedy," Masters 
said. 'We want to get the truth out and see what's going on in that athletic 
department." 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch, who lives in Palm Desert and works at a golf course, said: "I hope this 
formal grievance would bring out the blockbuster truth about my situation with 
the school over the last five years and I hope Charles Young will attend."

<P>
IS CENTER STRAWBERRY'S FIELD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The exchange centered on the ability of Darryl Strawberry to play center field 
and was the liveliest of baseball's winter meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Harrelson, the New York Mets' manager, and Joe McIlvaine, the former vice 
president of the Mets and now general manager of the San Diego Padres, 
expressed doubt. Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda supported the concept and did it 
with some emotion. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line was that despite Lasorda's defense and the Dodgers' desire to 
test the offensive potential of an outfield that would have Kal Daniels in 
left, Strawberry in center and Hubie Brooks in right, it is known that the club 
is shopping Daniels for a pitcher and/or a second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
The departure of Daniels would put Strawberry back at his natural position in 
right field, move Brooks to left and leave Stan Javier or a player still to be 
acquired in center. 
</P>
<P>
As for stationing former Met Strawberry in center, a top Dodger scout who 
demanded anonymity said: "It's a last resort." 
</P>
<P>
Said Harrelson: "I'll believe it when I see it. I still don't believe he's 
going to be their center fielder. That's a position where you better get a good 
jump all the time. If you have a weakness, it'll show up real fast there. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, wanting it is one thing, doing it another. Darryl doesn't get a good 
jump. He's more suited to right field." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda tried to digest the statements, then said: "Does Bud Harrelson know 
everything there is to know about baseball? Is he willing to stake his 
reputation on all that? 
</P>
<P>
"It's like when we were converting Bill Russell from center field to shortstop. 
Five or six scouts told me he would never play shortstop in the big leagues. 
Hell, all he did is play it for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, I agree. Darryl is a better right fielder, but that's only because 
it's what he's been playing. I can't say he's going to be a good center 
fielder, but we're going to find out." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda outlined a rigid spring training plan for Strawberry and said it is 
often forgotten that center field is the easiest outfield position because the 
ball isn't hooking and slicing and is easier to see coming off the bat. 
</P>
<P>
"If Bud Harrelson is an authority on center field, he should have mentioned 
that," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
McIlvaine pointed out that Mark Carreon of the Mets made the switch from left 
field to center and was suddenly an improved player. 
</P>
<P>
"You see the ball much better there," McIlvaine said, "but where Darryl is weak 
is in his positioning. He doesn't study hitters and position himself 
accordingly. He's going to need help there. 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, he has the range, the speed and he certainly can reach. He played 
center field for us in the minors after he signed in 1980 and '81, but he 
hasn't been there in a long time. He needs to take a hundred fly balls a day." 
</P>
<P>
Does he have that kind of work ethic? 
</P>
<P>
"Depends what day it is," McIlvaine said. "Some yes, some no." 
</P>
<P>
Make of It What You Will Dept.: The Toronto Blue Jays, who tap into the 
Dominican market maybe more than any other team, seem to be moving in another 
direction. Sixteen of the last 24 players they have traded, released or allowed 
to leave as free agents are Dominicans. 
</P>
<P>
A feud is flowering between the American League and the National League 
regarding expansion income, and the ultimate pawn may be Florida. 
</P>
<P>
There is growing speculation that the NL, which will add two teams in 1993, 
wants to put both in Florida -- the choices being St. Petersburg and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Any National League move, however, needs at least majority approval by American 
League owners, and the AL is unlikely to hand over that booming state without 
the NL sharing the $190 million -- $95 million per new team -- in expansion 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
The AL first proposed supplying half of the expansion players for half of the 
expansion income. It has since reduced the proposal by a half, but according to 
NL expansion committee chairman Douglas Danforth of the Pittsburgh Pirates, the 
NL is adamantly against sharing any revenue with the AL. 
</P>
<P>
American League President Bobby Brown argued that when his league expanded in 
1977 it provided the NL with 1/26th of the expansion income, even though the NL 
did not contribute any players. 
</P>
<P>
He said there was also a gentlemen's agreement that the NL would share income 
when it next expanded. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Fay Vincent may have to resolve the current conflict, Brown said. 
In the meantime, the NL is expected to announce a "short list" of prospective 
owners and cities before Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Cubs, having invested more than $20 million in free agents Danny 
Jackson and George Bell, must now attempt to re-sign shortstop Shawon Dunston, 
who is eligible for free agency after the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm gone. . . . How are they going to pay $30 million for the three of us?" 
Dunston asked reporters in Chicago, meaning he thinks the Cubs will trade him. 
</P>
<P>
The Cub payroll also includes the following 1991 commitments: $3.3 million to 
Andre Dawson, $2.2 million to Ryne Sandberg and $2 million to Rick Sutcliffe. 
</P>
<P>
Said deputy commissioner Steve Greenberg: "The current system is a prescription 
for disaster. Whether it's around the corner or 10 years ahead, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
George Steinbrenner may be gone, but confusion continues to grip the New York 
Yankees' front office. Who's in charge? New Managing Partner Robert 
Nederlander? General Manager Gene Michael? Director of baseball operations 
George Bradley? 
</P>
<P>
Agent Bill Goodstein said he was shuffled from one to the other and back in a 
futile attempt to have the Yankees negotiate on re-signing reliever Dave 
Righetti, who ultimately agreed to a four-year, $10-million contract with the 
San Francisco Giants on the same day that the Yankees were agreeing to extend 
the contract of second baseman Steve Sax for four years and $12.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on those seemingly conflicting Yankee decisions as he prepared to 
leave the winter meetings, Michael had a similar response to each. "I'm not 
sure we did the right thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bradley, who negotiated the Sax contract with little or no input from 
Michael: "Steve wanted to remain a Yankee, and we decided we wanted to keep 
him. The market is going to escalate way out of proportion. While the contract 
may appear a little high now, it won't later. His leverage was not that good, 
but we escape arbitration (after the '91 season) this way." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why some of that money couldn't have gone to Righetti, Bradley said: 
"There was no tie-in between the two. It's just an organizational policy not to 
go more than three years for a pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, may make it impossible for the Yankees to stay in the bidding 
for free-agent pitcher Bob Welch, who is already said to have received 
four-year offers from the Chicago White Sox, Boston and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Dick Moss said Giant President Al Rosen "panicked" and overreacted to 
Brett Butler's four-year, $15-million contract request. 
</P>
<P>
Rosen pointed Butler toward the door and promptly signed free agent Willie 
McGee to replace him at $13 million for four years. 
</P>
<P>
Moss said he had only one conversation with Rosen and never received the chance 
to amend the opening proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never known Al to react like that," Moss said. "I think it's obvious that 
he had no intention of re-signing Brett, that he wanted to sign Willie McGee 
all along."

MORNING BRIEFING: EVEN THIS NAVY IS CALLING UP ITS RESERVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Preparing for today's Army-Navy game, Navy Coach George Chaump said Thursday: 
"From a coaching perspective, you really don't have time to get into an 
emotional state. We've been locked in our rooms looking at films. So in terms 
of what we're doing, it's pretty much the same -- only more intense." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Chaump somehow found a moment to create one emotional weapon. 
</P>
<P>
He told David Ginsburg of the Associated Press that he'll fill his kickoff 
return unit with members of the Naval Academy's plebe team, which went 4-0 this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Said Chaump: "They earned it. They deserved it. Nothing is better than giving 
them their baptism in the biggest game of their life, and that's the Army-Navy 
game. I think they'll be excited and do a great job, and it will give them a 
shot of confidence when they come back in the spring and fall. They'll play 
like they're veterans." 
</P>
<P>
Add Chaump: Earlier this season, before the first-year Navy coach faced Notre 
Dame, he told Barry Cronin of the Chicago Sun-Times about an episode in 1968, 
when he and Irish Coach Lou Holtz were assistants under Woody Hayes at Ohio 
State. 
</P>
<P>
Before playing Purdue, which had won its previous game against the Buckeyes by 
40 points, Chaump said Holtz told another Ohio State assistant: "We're going to 
shut them out." 
</P>
<P>
The assistant bet Holtz a dollar, laying him 100-1, that Purdue would score at 
least one point. Final score: Ohio State 13, Purdue 0. 
</P>
<P>
Said Chaump: "Lou put the $100 bill in a frame. He always was one for bargains. 
He's the kind of guy who can fall in a manure heap and come out with a diamond 
ring." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: After Yale, with 100, which school has had the most consensus 
All-American football selections? 
</P>
<P>
Jumping mad: Ric Desotell, coach of the La Canada Ribet Academy eight-person 
football team, can't understand why his kicker, Kate Stoll, was left off the 
1990 All-Heritage League team. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Frogs are the only team in the league that kicks extra points, 
Desotell said. The others go for two points. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, as a junior, Stoll kicked five extra points and made the all-league 
first team. This year, after kicking six, she didn't even make the second team. 
</P>
<P>
Said Desotell: "The other kickers just made it for their kickoffs. I find that 
astounding." 
</P>
<P>
Bring on the Kings: When the National Hockey League announced Thursday that in 
1992 it would add an Ottawa team, to be called the Senators, the phone started 
ringing off the hook -- in the offices of the Ottawa Senators, a team in the 
Central Junior Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Hudson, general manager of the junior team, told AP his staff had a busy 
day, adding: "And we're not even in the phone book." 
</P>
<P>
Prolific heights: According to the Guinness Book of World Records, UCLA 
redshirt center Mike Lanier and his brother, Jim, who plays for the University 
of Denver, are the world's tallest living identical male twins at 7-feet-6. 
</P>
<P>
Also according to the Guinness book, University of Virginia basketball players 
Heather and Heidi Burge, at 6-4 3/4, are the world's tallest living identical 
female twins. 
</P>
<P>
The Lanier brothers went to Brother Rice High in Birmingham, Mich., the Burge 
sisters attended Palos Verdes High. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Harvard, with 89. Notre Dame is third with 84. 
</P>

NEWSWIRE: BAVARO AGREES TO PAY FINE FOR BUMPING OFFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tight end Mark Bavaro of the New York Giants agreed Friday to pay a fine of a 
reported $7,500 levied by the NFL for bumping an official during a 31-13 loss 
to the Philadelphia Eagles on Nov. 25. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred seconds after the Eagles' Byron Evans returned an 
interception 22 yards for a touchdown. When Bavaro became involved in a shoving 
match, umpire Dave Hamilton ended up on the ground after either tripping or 
being pushed inadvertently.

VALENZUELA, SAMUEL OFFERED ARBITRATION; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: CLUB MAKES A LATE BID TO KEEP THEM. MICKEY HATCHER ALSO GETS AN OFFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having failed to acquire a left-handed starting pitcher or a second baseman, 
the Dodgers made a final-hour move Friday to keep free agents Fernando 
Valenzuela and Juan Samuel by offering them one-year contracts with arbitration 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
They also virtually guaranteed that free agent Mickey Hatcher would remain a 
Dodger by making him a similar offer. 
</P>
<P>
If the Dodgers had not made the offers, they would have had to wait until May 1 
to try to re-sign the players. The players have until Dec. 19 to accept the 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
If the players accept, they will count against the roster and contracts will be 
negotiated, with arbitration available to settle impasses. If the players do 
not accept, the Dodgers must sign them by Jan. 8 or lose rights to them until 
May 1. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher, who wants to finish his career in Los Angeles, is certain to accept. 
And although originally it appeared that both Valenzuela and Samuel would go 
elsewhere, the feeling is that they might also accept. 
</P>
<P>
They suddenly need the Dodgers because they have not been offered lucrative 
multiyear deals by other teams. By accepting this offer, they would retain 
their free-agent rights for next season, giving them opportunities to benefit 
from another inflated market if their performances improve. 
</P>
<P>
"Who is to say that a multiyear deal would be good for Juan right now?" said 
Jim Turner, agent for Samuel, who batted .242 last season. "Juan is a big 
believer in his ability and I don't think he wants to a sign a contract at 
under-market value when, after a good season next year, he could leave that 
contract in the dust." 
</P>
<P>
Samuel gave both the Dodgers and himself reason to believe that his hitting 
problems were solved by batting .277 after the All-Star break, .377 in the 
final month. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela's chances on the open market are hampered by the top draft choice it 
will cost a team to sign him. He is coming off a 13-13 season with a 4.59 
earned-run average and a reputation for struggling if he has to pitch more than 
six innings. 
</P>
<P>
He would like a multiyear deal, but the Dodgers are not likely to cut his 
$2-million base salary by much, and he likes playing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We are talking to other people . . . it is good to know that we now have more 
options," said Tony DeMarco, Valenzuela's agent. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if Valenzuela was upset that the Dodgers had not offered him a 
contract until now, DeMarco said, "I will not answer that one." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers need both players again because they failed in attempts to sign 
free-agent second baseman Bill Doran or left-handed pitcher Tom Browning, among 
others. 
</P>
<P>
"Face it," a club source said. "These guys are better right now than what we've 
got." 
</P>
<P>
By offering the contracts, the Dodgers also retain draft-choice compensation 
for both players. So if they still choose to go elsewhere, the Dodgers have not 
lost everything. 
</P>
<P>
"Compensation is one factor for this move, but a lot of things go into it," 
said Fred Claire, Dodger vice president. "If we felt they had absolutely no 
place on this team, we would not have made this offer. We are prepared to have 
them on the team." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela and Samuel could also give the Dodgers depth to make a deal for a 
left-handed relief pitcher, their biggest need. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela's presence would allow the Dodgers to trade starters Mike Morgan and 
Jim Neidlinger. The return of Samuel would allow the trading of either Lenny 
Harris or Mike Sharperson, the infielders who are expected to platoon at second 
base. 
</P>
<P>
Claire said Friday that he began discussions with several teams this week about 
a left-handed reliever and, "We could soon have some fallout from that." 
</P>
<P>
Top candidates for acquisition would include Dan Plesac of Milwaukee and Mitch 
Williams of the Chicago Cubs. It would probably take Kal Daniels to acquire 
Plesac, but Sharperson or Harris would be enough for Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll just say we are not finished building this team," Claire said.

ANGELS AGREE TO TERMS WITH MANRIQUE

<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels announced Friday they had agreed to terms with free-agent infielder 
Fred Manrique and had offered arbitration to free agents Donnie Hill and Max 
Venable. 
</P>
<P>
Manrique hit .237 for the Texas Rangers and Minnesota Twins last season. He was 
sent to Minnesota's triple-A affiliate in Portland, Ore., in July and was not 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Hill and Venable have until Dec. 19 to accept or reject arbitration. If they do 
not accept it, the Angels may negotiate with them until Jan. 8. If they do not 
sign by that date, they would be unable to re-sign with the Angels until May 1.

DODGERS ALREADY TALKING TO BUTLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brett Butler, the San Francisco center fielder who became a free agent Friday, 
said that his agent has already been contacted by the Dodgers, whom he 
considers "my dream team." 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I was a kid I wanted to play for the Dodgers," Butler said from his 
Atlanta home after becoming one of 15 new-look free agents in accordance with 
the recent collusion ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a free agent in 1987, they were my first choice. I love Los 
Angeles. It has always been a dream to play there. Hopefully something can 
transpire." 
</P>
<P>
Butler said his agent, Dick Moss, was contacted by the Dodgers Friday morning 
and that the Dodgers promised to get back to him. Butler batted .309 last year 
with 51 stolen bases and could fill the Dodgers' need for a leadoff hitter 
while allowing them to trade Kal Daniels for a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"Our outfield is a bit crowded right now, but I do expect we will speak to 
Butler," Dodger Vice President Fred Claire said. BILL PLASCHKE

LEE VINING GIRL EARNS A PLACE ON THE LINE; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: PLAYING ON OFFENSE, DEFENSE AND SPECIAL TEAMS, ANDREAS IS A UNANIMOUS 
ALL-LEAGUE CHOICE IN EIGHT-MAN GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Football was not in Rebecca Andreas' future. 
</P>
<P>
At least, that's what she told herself after quitting the Lee Vining High team 
when she found the going was tough. 
</P>
<P>
Her teachers and friends talked her into giving it another try, but the new 
coach wasn't convinced. He said he thought she would be too fragile. 
</P>
<P>
It took only two days of practice to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
That was last year. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Ed Blankenship isn't the only coach whose mind has been changed. 
Andreas was unanimously voted first team all-league by the four coaches of the 
Hi-Lo League in the Small Schools Division. She is believed to be the first 
female non-kicker to earn such an honor in the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
A 16-year-old junior, Andreas not only was a left guard on offense this season, 
but also played on the defensive line and special teams for the eight-man team. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Vining is a small community about 30 miles north of Mammoth. Baker Valley 
of Baker, Owens Valley in Independence, and Immanual Christian of Ridgecrest 
are the other schools in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing defense is fun . . . at least this year it has been," Andreas said. 
"Tackling is the most fun. . . . It feels like you're really doing something 
for the team, not just waiting for something to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Blankenship says that although Andreas' speed is average, she has come a long 
way in her second season. 
</P>
<P>
"She is strong, and because of that she's able to put her 148 pounds into 
someone and make it mean something," Blankenship said. 
</P>
<P>
Andreas stands 5 feet 6 and is still growing. Her coach says that with the 
level of intensity she displays on the field, he has little doubt she could 
make the grade at a junior college in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
"If she keeps up with the level of play I have seen since I've been here, she 
could possibly play at Sierra (Junior College)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
She says that her strongest points are her ability to read runners in pursuing 
a tackle and her blocking strength. 
</P>
<P>
The coach does not quite agree. 
</P>
<P>
"Her strongest point is her determination to be consistent," Blankenship said. 
"I can't recall one time in looking at film or otherwise, that she made a 
serious error." 
</P>
<P>
Andreas, a Paiute Indian, lives with her grandmother and has the support of 
family and friends in playing such a physical sport. She also plays basketball 
and softball for Lee Vining. 
</P>
<P>
"I started playing flag football in junior high and (the interest) just grew 
from there," she said. "I want to prove, especially to the other team, that I 
can block and tackle as good as anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers went 1-7 this season, beating only Immanual Christian. But with no 
graduating players, Blankenship says his team will be ready to prove something 
to the rest of the league. 
</P>
<P>
"I have 12 returning players and should get a few additions for next year," he 
said. "I'm confident we'll have a much better season." 
</P>
<P>
Although Andreas plays on three teams, she has managed to remain an honor-roll 
student with a 3.3 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing at a junior college would be tough," she said. "It's still a long way 
off and I haven't even thought about it yet." 
</P>
<P>
In looking far ahead, though, she says she would like to pursue a coaching 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, her coach is convinced that she would make a great tight end or 
running back next season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to run the ball, anything where I can show that I can play the game 
well, I'll do it," Andreas said. 
</P>
<P>
Making such an adjustment on the team could pose problems unless Blankenship 
can find an alternate. 
</P>
<P>
"She can catch well," he said. "I'd like to have her run the ball next year, 
but that means finding someone as qualified to fill her position, which won't 
be an easy thing to do."

SOLIS, PATTON HOSPITALIZED AFTER 3-HORSE SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jockeys Alex Solis, Robbie Davis and Dave Patton escaped serious injury in a 
three-horse spill during the first race Friday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred when Fields Of Belles, Patton's mount, broke down 
entering the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Solis, riding Baffis Habitony, and Davis, aboard Vaunty, went down when they 
were unable to avoid the fallen horse and rider. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who was able to walk away from the spill, was taken to Centinela 
Hospital Medical Center, where X-rays of his right arm proved negative. He was 
sent home and cleared to ride this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Solis, who is third in the Hollywood Park rider standings behind Chris McCarron 
and Kent Desormeaux, and Patton, both suffered concussions and were to spend in 
the hospital for observation. 
</P>
<P>
Solis, who was scheduled to ride Balla Cove in today's $100,000 Affirmed 
Handicap and Formal Dinner in Sunday's $1-million Hollywood Futurity, also was 
treated for a scalp bruise. Doctors said Solis could ride if he is feeling well 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
Patton, who didn't regain consciousness until he reached the hospital, required 
stitches for a scalp cut. 
</P>
<P>
Fields Of Belles, a 3-year-old maiden filly making her second start for trainer 
Mark MacDonald, broke the cannon bone in her right foreleg and was destroyed. 
Baffis Habitony and Vaunty were not injured.

THE COLLEGES / MIKE HISERMAN; 
</P>
<P>
INJURED PITCHER LEAVES CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago, Monte Jones was considered Cal State Northridge's brightest 
pitching prospect. Now he no longer is a member of the baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a right-hander who lit up radar guns while pitching for Tustin High, 
never showed the same zip on his pitches during his freshman season at CSUN. 
After struggling to a 7.94 earned-run average in 22 2/3 innings, Jones 
refrained from throwing last summer, hoping the rest would heal his aching arm. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't. Dr. Frank Jobe, a noted orthopedic surgeon, recommended that Jones 
undergo surgery to replace a piece of tendon on the inside portion of his right 
elbow. Jones would need to redshirt a season while undergoing extensive 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
But he declined to have surgery and transferred to Saddleback College where he 
will attempt a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge Coach Bill Kernen surmises that Jones pitched too many innings 
because of a strenuous summer of tournaments and all-star games after his 
senior season of high school. 
</P>
<P>
"All last season he was just not the pitcher everyone saw in high school," 
Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior at Tustin, Jones had a 12-2 record and was Orange County's 
strikeout leader with 135. 
</P>
<P>
Lean but not mean: With Jones at Saddleback and reserve infielder E. J. Pape 
having transferred to Master's College, Northridge is down to 20 players -- a 
lean roster by Division I standards, but the same number the Matadors had last 
season when they advanced to the Division II championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Said Kernen: "It saves us some money on road trips with rooms and that kind of 
stuff, but if we get in a fight we're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Ratings game: Kernen has been told by a representative from a national baseball 
publication that the Matadors probably will be ranked among the nation's top 25 
teams as they embark on their inaugural Division I season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we belong in there, maybe in the top 20 based on who we have," Kernen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Killian, David Eggert and Kenny Kendrena, recruits brought in by Kernen 
to shore up CSUN's pitching, all looked strong in fall action. 
</P>
<P>
Kendrena, a 5-foot-10, 165-pound right-hander from Cypress College, might 
become the Matadors' bullpen ace. He throws hard enough and has a good 
split-finger fastball. 
</P>
<P>
Kendrena originally signed with Texas A&amp;M as a shortstop out of Bishop Amat 
High. He transferred to Cypress in 1989 and was the Chargers' most valuable 
player last season. He was 4-1 with two saves and an earned-run average of 
3.01. 
</P>
<P>
In good standing: Jeff Barrett aspires to play quarterback for an Ivy League 
team and it looks like the interest is mutual. The University of Pennsylvania 
has shown interest in the former Burroughs High star, and a representative from 
Brown scouted Barrett last Saturday as he led Santa Monica College against 
Moorpark in the Western State Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica lost, 69-34, but Barrett passed for 325 yards and impressed 
Moorpark Coach Jim Bittner, who already thought highly of the 5-foot-11 
left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a quick release, he moves well and he's smart," Bittner said. "To me, 
all that stuff about a quarterback's height is overrated." 
</P>
<P>
That might be true in the Ivy League, but could Barrett be successful at a 
higher level of Division I football? 
</P>
<P>
"He could play at any level," Bittner said. "If I was a Division I coach, I'd 
take him right now." 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: If Northridge upsets Montana State tonight, the Matadors will creep 
that much closer to cracking Division I basketball's Top 200. USA Today's 
computer ranked CSUN 256th (out of 296) this week; Montana State was ranked 
225th. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of rankings, why would Southland sports information directors place 
Moorpark ahead of Glendale in the final football poll? Both teams finished 9-2 
and Glendale defeated Moorpark, 45-21, a month ago. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Attention Cal Lutheran Coach Mike Dunlap: On Monday, Tennessee-Martin announced 
that it had hired Cal Luther as interim basketball coach. Sounds like the 
perfect nonconference opponent. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket is planning live television coverage of the Northridge-USC men's 
basketball game Feb. 4 at the Sports Arena. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark succeeded in winning its own men's basketball tournament last week, 
but rival Ventura dealt a blow to the Raiders' fortunes even though it lost in 
the semifinals. Moorpark Coach Al Nordquist said a championship match between 
the Ventura County rivals might have netted the host school as much as an extra 
$1,500. . . . 
</P>
<P>
So much for the flashy pump-it-up advertising slogans of high-tech and 
high-priced basketball shoes. Sam Crawford, the top player on the Moorpark 
men's team, plays in running shoes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A couple of former Buena High standouts have been reunited on the Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo basketball team. Guard Jeff Oliver, a freshman, has started the 
Mustangs' past two games and scored 21 points in a 118-90 victory over 
Missouri-St. Louis last week. A few days earlier, center Shawn Kirkeby, a 
sophomore coming off shoulder surgery, scored 11 points and had five rebounds 
in a 93-83 loss to Nebraska Omaha. . . .

Looking up down under: Steve deLaveaga, former scoring machine for the Cal 
Lutheran basketball team, appears to have adjusted well to life down under. Now 
playing for a professional team in Australia, deLaveaga recently signed a 
contract that tripled his salary from his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
Exact terms were not disclosed but he probably deserved a raise. In his first 
season, deLaveaga averaged 41 points a game and was second in the league in 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
Pedal to the metal: Add Cal Lutheran to the list of college basketball teams 
pressing a little heavier on the accelerator this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen averaged 73 points a game last season but have averaged 85 a game 
through the first four games this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We just moved it up a notch because the players we have are better," 
second-year Coach Mike Dunlap said. "Let's face it. At this level fans want 
basketball that is really exciting to watch. They don't want to see a slugfest. 
They want a little excitement, some run and gun and up-tempo things. It's 
important for recruiting that we play that way." 
</P>
<P>
Money talks: Dunlap knew he had his work cut out for him when he resigned his 
position as an assistant at USC to take over Cal Lutheran's program before last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a war for the last 1 1/2 years," he said. "We started from scratch 
and we're still about another year away." 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran is caught in transition between conferences. The Kingsmen belong 
to the NAIA District 3 but are recruiting by NCAA Division III rules. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the competition has an important component that the Kingsmen 
lack: players on scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably lost 10 kids on teams we play against because of money," Dunlap 
said. "They like the school, they like the program, but we can't offer them 
anything so they go somewhere that can. It comes down to dollars and cents and 
you can never blame a kid when it comes down to that." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Cal Lutheran, parity might be only a season away. The Kingsmen 
are expected to join the ranks of Division III next season as a member of the 
non-scholarship Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.

nonleague game at home.

FIRST THE PAIN, THEN THE GAIN; 
</P>
<P>
OCHOA'S SELFLESS MOVE UP IN CLASS A KEY IN MOORPARK'S BID FOR STATE WRESTLING 
TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Delfino Ochoa had defeated some devilishly tough wrestlers, but now he was 
grappling with demons of another sort. 
</P>
<P>
It was the day of the 1989 Southern California regional, and Ochoa, then a 
Moorpark College freshman, was in hiding -- from his coach and the pain that 
pierced him like St. Sebastian's arrows. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa had wrestled in pain throughout the season. The small finger of his left 
hand came out of socket at least a half-dozen times, and his knee cartilage was 
so seriously torn it would require surgery. 
</P>
<P>
But this was too much. The pain of trying to drop four pounds in a matter of 
hours to meet his 118-pound limit was becoming too much to bear. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa, craving food or a drink, was wearing three pairs of socks and two 
plastic suits covered by a sweat shirt and a jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Ochoa lay down on the soothingly cool tile of the shower-room floor. 
That eased his feverish burning, but the shower heads were mocking him. 
</P>
<P>
"I broke," Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
In John Keever's 21 years as coach, only one Moorpark College wrestler had ever 
missed weight. Now Ochoa was missing altogether. Missing weight no longer 
mattered to Ochoa. He was quitting then and there. The sacrifice just was not 
worth it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually Keever tracked down Ochoa and urged him not to give up. Ochoa's 
teammates and coaches goaded him back into motion. He made weight with minutes 
to spare. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to be strong up here," Ochoa said, pointing to his head. "That day 
I just snapped because you're going through all this pain to make the weight." 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa finished second in that regional and since then has endured fewer 
tribulations making weight. He went on to win the state title at 118. He enters 
the final rounds of the state tournament today at Cypress College ranked No. 1 
in the 126-pound division, a key to top-ranked Moorpark's bid for its first 
team championship. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa beat Darren Uyematsu of El Camino, 9-2, in the second round Friday to 
improve his record to 30-4-1. He will meet Brandon Keosky of Cuesta in the 
semifinals today. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa has succeeded despite moving up a weight class and competing with an 
injury to his left arch that has left him limping. Wrestling at 126 pounds, he 
watches his diet less and his back more. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't get lazy," Ochoa said. "I can't get lackadaisical. A lot of the guys 
are just massive. When I walk out there, it's like David and Goliath. . . . I'm 
just quicker on my feet than they are." 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa would have been a strong favorite for a second consecutive title at 118 
pounds, but Keever believed moving Ochoa up in weight would help the team even 
if Ochoa did not win an individual title at 126. 
</P>
<P>
Keever wanted to switch Ochoa and Billy Scannell, who wrestled at 126 last 
season, on the theory that the slighter Scannell would do markedly better at 
118 and Ochoa would hold his own at 126. Scannell is ranked No. 2 at 118. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa not only gave up a chance to repeat at 118 but also moved into the domain 
of bigger and stronger wrestlers, including Orlando Montero of Cerritos, the 
defending state champion at 126. 
</P>
<P>
"He made a big-time sacrifice for our team," Keever said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a move at which others might have balked, but Ochoa said: "It benefits 
the team more." 
</P>
<P>
At 5-foot-3 and 126 pounds, Ochoa is relatively stocky for a wrestler in a 
lower-weight class. Although he gives up height to his opponents, he holds his 
own in strength and has bench-pressed more than 300 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
If Ochoa makes a good showing at 126 pounds, Keever believes that will make him 
even more attractive to four-year colleges as a 118-pounder. However, going 
back to 118 will be a painful move for a guy whose weight fluctuates between 
137 and 140 in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
"I like food. I love eating," said Ochoa, who has figured out that he loses a 
pound and a half every night in his sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"Brownies, burritos, Chinese food," Ochoa says wistfully as he lists his 
favorites. "Basically, I like junk food." 
</P>
<P>
Coaches discourage roller-coaster weight swings, but living at home presents 
Ochoa with the nearly irresistible temptation of his mother's cooking. Keever's 
lectures on proper eating habits give Ochoa food for thought, but he still 
thinks a lot about food. 
</P>
<P>
Had Ochoa disregarded the advice of his father and Keever and not continued 
wrestling, he could eat all the food he wanted. After graduating from Hueneme 
High, Ochoa planned to work, but his father was pushing him to go to college 
and Keever was recruiting him. 
</P>
<P>
At Hueneme, Ochoa won three Channel League wrestling championships and was a 
classmate of Freddie Bradley, the standout tailback on Moorpark's football 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always the smallest one in school," Ochoa said. "My freshman year, 
people used to pick on me, and Fred would be there saying, 'Hey, leave him 
alone'. . . . I'd be right behind Fred just saying, 'Yeah, leave me alone.' " 
</P>
<P>
If Bradley is the big man on the Moorpark campus, then Ochoa is the big little 
man on campus. That's fine with Keever, who believes he would have lost Ochoa 
to another sport if Ochoa were taller. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to play basketball," Ochoa said. "When I got to high school, 
everybody just sprouted, and I was still the same size. I went out for the 
freshman team, and every time I tried to shoot, somebody just swatted it." 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa might not be a Spud Webb, but he is one of the best athletes at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are he will not be found lying on the shower-room floor today, but 
don't be surprised if he sends an opponent to an early shower.

Thanksgiving weekend -- traditionally the year's busiest -- Sears executives 
said drastic steps were needed to get shoppers into the stores.

L.A. GEAR GIVES BBDO MUCH OF ITS TV AD WORK;

<P>
MARKETING: THE SNEAKER MAKER, WHICH HAD BEEN HANDLING CREATIVE CHORES ITSELF, 
WANTS A CHANGE OF IMAGE.

<P>
L.A. Gear, eager to establish an advertised image that pleases both sneaker 
buyers and Wall Street investors, handed much of its television ad business to 
the Los Angeles office of the agency BBDO Worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Executives of L.A. Gear and the agency declined to reveal the specifics of the 
agreement. But industry executives estimate that BBDO could initially pick up 
about $15 million in annual billings, with the potential for much more. 
</P>
<P>
"Between their team and ours, we can rewrite the rules," said Michael Albright, 
creative director at L.A. Gear. He said L.A. Gear selected BBDO because 
"they're an international presence and showed us very strong creative work." 
</P>
<P>
Executives from BBDO declined to comment, referring all calls to L.A. Gear. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the nation's No. 3 sneaker maker -- which has been struggling with 
soft sales and disappointing earnings -- has created its own ads. That includes 
the slogan "Unstoppable," which executives say will be scrapped. L.A. Gear will 
at least temporarily continue to create print advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
Another firm, New York-based Vitt Media, will continue to place L.A. Gear's 
broadcast and print ads. Overall, L.A. Gear spends more than $60 million 
annually to create and place advertising. 
</P>
<P>
For BBDO, which also creates ads for Apple Computer, the win represents an 
opportunity to create high-profile spots for another client. L.A. Gear's need 
for a strong advertised image has never been greater. Said one L.A. Gear 
official who asked not to be named, "We have to out-Nike Nike." 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say the agency selection is a good one. "TV advertising and 
promotion is becoming increasingly important in the footwear industry," said 
Gary M. Jacobson, analyst at the New York investment firm Kidder, Peabody &amp; 
Co. "This can only help them." 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Gear stock jumped $1.50 Friday to $15.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
The agency selection, however, had not been publicly announced. 
</P>
<P>
Some BBDO spots could be airing in less than a month. The agency's most 
pressing mission will be to create an ad for LA Gear's new high-tech line of 
basketball performance shoes, "Catapult," to air during the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The agency review set off a flurry of inquiries in late October by dozens of 
West Coast agencies. BBDO was one of four finalists. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most surprising agency to make the cut was the year-old San 
Francisco creative boutique, Atlas Citron Haligman &amp; Bedecarre. "We were 
the long-shot new kids on the block," said Chairman Jeff Atlas.

WORLD'S RECESSION JITTERS EVIDENT AT ART/LA90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the calamitous New York auctions for contemporary art this 
fall have caused a few jitters at the International Contemporary Art Fair, 
which is midway into its fifth annual outing at the Los Angeles Convention 
Center. (The gathering of some 170 galleries from 20 countries continues 
through Monday). 
</P>
<P>
As it's a commercial event, geared exclusively to the selling of art, art fair 
officials have been quick to outline sharp distinctions between the auction 
market and the gallery market. The point is well taken, although it would be 
better taken if the gallery market wasn't feeling a bit of heat too. 
</P>
<P>
Be that as it may, the marketing linchpin that keeps this or any art fair 
afloat is only of interest indirectly. You don't judge the importance of 
architecture by the concrete used in its foundation, or weigh a painting on the 
merits of its stretcher bars. Besides, the degree of market success or failure 
by participating galleries is virtually impossible for an outsider to gauge, 
except in the grossest of terms. For me, the terms go like this: If the fair 
returns next year things must be relatively OK; if not, not. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, even though the Convention Center and the Chamber of Commerce place 
revenues at the top of the art fair heap, the city's cultural life is truly 
enhanced by something else entirely. In this regard, ART/LA90 (as the fair is 
also known) isn't about sales of paintings and sculptures by dealers from 
Brussels and Boston, Santa Monica and Seoul. Except secondarily, it isn't even 
about the paintings and sculptures that are the actual objects of trade. More 
than anything, the fair is about the people in the booths -- selling, buying, 
wandering around or venturing out into the rest of town -- who have come from 
Brussels, Boston, Santa Monica and Seoul. For the cultural life of Los Angeles, 
the art fair is most important as a five-day focal point for The Big Schmooze. 
</P>
<P>
Like mushrooms after a spring rain, subsidiary events crop up all over town to 
coincide with the art fair, creating assorted excuses to bring together 
strangers whose passionate point of reference is art. Foundations choose the 
moment to convene their widely dispersed advisers or to hold symposiums with 
invited guests. Open houses compete with parties, dinners vie with museum 
openings. Out-of-towners find their way to artists' spaces, galleries and 
museums. Artists meet dealers who meet collectors who meet curators who meet 
critics who meet artists. 
</P>
<P>
Seeds get planted. Things happen. Because the fair is now a deeply enmeshed 
component of the city's cultural life, a review of these extracurricular events 
sometimes seems more to the point than a commentary on the fair itself. 
</P>
<P>
The overall level of quality of the international galleries that participate, 
like the significance of the art each chooses to display, is therefore best 
thought of as bait, luring assorted fish from other cities and other countries 
to swim in L.A.'s culture pool. A makeshift booth with glaring spotlights may 
not exactly provide an optimal viewing situation, but the semi-tacky, 
product-showroom motif that characterizes any fair finally doesn't matter. (I'd 
sooner climb down a well to see a great painting than not see it at all.) 
</P>
<P>
So, what of the art and the galleries at the Convention Center this year? I 
wish they were better. This year's array is not as substantive as last year's, 
and recession seems the hard reason why. Space at an art fair costs money, 
especially for galleries that must ship art across a continent and/or an ocean 
to get there. At this uncertain, unstable moment, both politically and 
economically, several top-flight dealers who have participated in the past 
opted to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, I always wish the quality at the art fair was better. Who wouldn't? 
Bemusement at what passes for important painting and sculpture in the minds of 
some purveyors pales quickly when seen in concentration, as is inevitably the 
case. Still, there's plenty of reason to go. It takes a while for your eyes 
(and your nervous system) to adjust, since steady and prolonged winnowing is 
required in the face of glut. Yet, in the sudden encounter with a small drawing 
you almost missed amid the throng, or in the vague detection of accumulated 
trends, persistence pays off. 
</P>
<P>
Herewith, a few random notes of sights seen and thoughts thought at ART/LA90: 
</P>
<P>
* The major gallery motif this year is period furniture -- not in what's for 
sale, but in gallery reception areas. Period furniture, especially of a 1940s 
to 1960s vintage, is everywhere to be seen, including at the Linda Cathcart, 
James Corcoran, Jan Kesner, Ursula Krinzinger and Richard Kuhlenschmidt 
galleries. Beyond basic showmanship, don't ask me what it means. 
</P>
<P>
* The most optimistic dealer at the fair is surely San Francisco's John 
Berggruen, whose gallery occupies not one but two booths across the aisle from 
one another. Each is filled with blue chip stock, including paintings and 
drawings by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Willem De Kooning and Richard 
Diebenkorn. 
</P>
<P>
* Each year the work of one or more artists seems to show up in booths all over 
the place, indicating major movement in that particular market. In recent 
years, work by John Baldessari, Dan Flavin and Edward Ruscha has been 
ubiquitous. This time out, you'll find a lot of sculpture by Britain's Tony 
Cragg (subject of a current survey show at the Newport Harbor Art Museum, which 
is about to begin a national tour) and a lot of photographs by Robert 
Mapplethorpe (you remember him). 
</P>
<P>
* A very quick, very short list of covetable, lesser works would have to 
include: a pencil-and-Polaroid study for a video installation by Bruce Nauman 
(at Angles); side-by-side Suprematist drawings by Kazimir Malevich and Ivan 
Klyun (Modernism), and a beautiful, if badly damaged, painting of a canoeist by 
David Park, from the watershed year of 1957 (Natsoulas-Novelozo). 
</P>
<P>
* A stronger European presence is sorely missed. (Well over half the galleries 
are from the United States.) A spotlight has been placed on a group of younger 
galleries from Belgium, but the more established dealer from Brussels (and 
Paris), Isy Brachot, makes the strongest showing. Especially compelling here 
are a sweet, 1921 collage by Louis Aragon, a 1919 watercolor by Guillaume 
Apollinaire and several appealing paintings by Magritte. 
</P>
<P>
* James Corcoran Gallery, with a big booth right near the entrance, has opted 
for tongue-in-chic stylishness, with walls covered in cork and linoleum and, 
yes, period furniture -- in fact, a whole living-room set. The linoleum wall is 
further papered over with dozens and dozens of small works (Picasso, Ken Price, 
Baldessari, Sam Francis, Arthur Dove), as if a portable survey collection or an 
array of stocking stuffers. 
</P>
<P>
* In fact, "art-as-wallpaper" is a prominent display scheme. One that's 180 
degrees from Corcoran's up-scale demeanor is at Richard/Bennett Gallery, where 
a marvelous group of more than 185 ink drawings by Raymond Pettibon are 
push-pinned cheek by jowl to the booth's exterior walls. (According to a sign 
scrawled graffiti-style above them, it's "The Sam Yorty Wing" of the Convention 
Center-cum-museum.) Pettibon's voyeuristic and obsessive meditations on life, 
death, sex and the spirit make for the most arresting exhibition at the fair.

RICK DU BROW: FOX LOSES SOME OF ITS SHEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
No network came into the new TV season with more swagger and flair than Fox. 
</P>
<P>
It was the riverboat gambler in a nervous business. It was, fittingly, the Bart 
Simpson network, thumbing its nose at the way things were supposed to be done. 
</P>
<P>
Fox's "The Simpsons" took on "The Cosby Show." The network daringly shook up 
its entire lineup and expanded from three nights a week to five. 
</P>
<P>
Cocky young Fox Broadcasting, just four years old, was shooting the works. And. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Oops. 
</P>
<P>
After a heady 1989-90 season behind "The Simpsons" and "Married . . . With 
Children," it is suddenly and soberingly the morning after for Fox. 
</P>
<P>
The big schedule shake-up -- dumping such known quantities as "21 Jump Street" 
and "Alien Nation" -- fizzled. New series that were counted on -- like "Babes," 
about three fat and funny sisters -- just didn't deliver. 
</P>
<P>
As far back as October, Fox was faced with giving free commercial time to 
sponsors for failing to meet ratings projections. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't had a breakout hit" this season, says media analyst Paul Bricault 
of Paul Kagan Associates. 
</P>
<P>
None of the networks had a real breakout hit this fall. "It's been a bad season 
for all of them," adds Bricault. 
</P>
<P>
But after last season's momentum and sudden impact with "The Simpsons," 
"Married . . . With Children" and "In Living Color," Fox was hot. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, Fox's edgy, insouciant attitude and shows -- and its 
freewheeling corporate style -- had finally established the network's image. 
</P>
<P>
Behind its determined chairman, Barry Diller, who virtually willed Fox into 
existence and epitomized its independent tone, the new network stood apart. It 
was ebullient, effusive, wholly different from conservative, old-line CBS, NBC 
and ABC. 
</P>
<P>
These days, however, Fox seems uncharacteristically low-key, perhaps taking 
stock of itself and its future after falling on its face this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, for instance, the seven bottom-ranked shows in the national TV 
ratings all belonged to Fox: "Cops," "Totally Hidden Video," "Beverly Hills 
90210," "Comic Strip Live," "Haywire," "Against the Law" and "American 
Chronicles." 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen of the 19 lowest-rated series were on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
In an increasingly soft advertising market, Fox's season-to-date ratings 
average, as of late this week, was 6.2, well below the 7 rating it reportedly 
pledged to sponsors. (Each rating point represents 931,000 homes.) 
</P>
<P>
It's true that ABC, CBS and NBC usually come on strong as the new season opens 
in September and October, but their weakness this fall was a major opportunity 
muffed by Fox. 
</P>
<P>
Fox has thrived on dramatic moves -- witness its stunning announcement earlier 
this year that "The Simpsons" would challenge "Cosby" head-on. The worst thing 
Fox could do now, while it's back on its heels, is turn conservative -- and 
thus blow its image. 
</P>
<P>
"They may be getting more conservative," says Bricault. "When you're the 
underdog, you can take more chances. You can throw a show like 'Married . . . 
With Children' into prime time, or an animated series like 'The Simpsons.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Bricault points out that Fox did try to push some limits again this fall 
with the new sitcom "True Colors," about an interracial marriage, and also with 
the irreverent "Babes." 
</P>
<P>
"True Colors" ranked 80th among 93 programs last week. "Babes" was 82nd. Both 
were reruns, but neither has been setting the world afire. 
</P>
<P>
None of its failures this season has the saving glamour and publicity value 
that went with Joan Rivers' dismissal from Fox as the host of its late-night 
series. The controversial split with Rivers was almost worth it to Fox in terms 
of the attention it brought the new network. 
</P>
<P>
Unless Fox manages to come up with another smash replacement series like "The 
Simpsons" -- which was a mid-season entry -- the network's fall failure will 
surely delay its plans to expand to seven nights a week. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it's not even up to the five nights a week it announced for this fall. 
The planned, weekly Monday movies have been delayed until at least later this 
season. That means Fox is still really a four-night network. 
</P>
<P>
And it had more impact in the past with fewer nights. Consider some of the 
now-departed series that were on its schedule a year ago when it was still a 
Saturday-Sunday-Monday service: "The Tracey Ullman Show," "It's Garry 
Shandling's Show," "21 Jump Street," "Booker" and "Alien Nation." 
</P>
<P>
Fox made a bad judgment this season by switching series programming from 
Mondays to Fridays, when there's a much smaller TV audience. 
</P>
<P>
Its biggest gamble, of course, was moving the "The Simpsons" to Thursdays -- 
and breaking up a blockbuster Sunday lineup that had quickly developed as the 
cartoon series teamed with "Married . . . With Children" and "In Living Color." 
</P>
<P>
Fox had never had such success before. But on Thursdays, while "The Simpsons" 
is more than holding its own against NBC's "The Cosby Show," it is still not 
averaging the 27% audience share that sponsors were said to have been 
guaranteed. More important, it has failed to be a potent lead-in for "Babes" -- 
or to build the night of hits that Fox had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Fox's former Sunday stronghold has weakened. New series such as 
"True Colors," "Parker Lewis Can't Lose," "Get a Life" and "Good Grief" simply 
haven't given much support to "Married . . . With Children" and "In Living 
Color." 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Fox has a few hits and little else. It is in danger of losing 
its strong image -- a kind of nuts-to-you attitude of fun and arrogance -- and 
becoming just another unexciting network, which would defeat its entire purpose 
for existing. 
</P>
<P>
Being talked about is lifeblood for Fox. The littlest network is at a 
crossroads.

FORMER L.A. DEPUTY MAYOR JOINS KNBC; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: NEWS EXECUTIVES AT OTHER STATIONS SAY THE HIRING OF MIKE GAGE AS A 
REPORTER RAISES CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST QUESTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Mike Gage, the former deputy mayor of Los Angeles and current head of the city 
Department of Water and Power Commission, has been hired as a TV reporter and 
commentator by KNBC Channel 4, the station confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Gage, who has no experience as a journalist, will serve as 
"reporter/commentator for education, as well as (work) on an assignment in a 
new area of coverage under development," Nancy Valenta, the station's news 
director, said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Several news executives at other Los Angeles TV stations said that Gage's 
hiring raised serious conflict-of-interest questions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an outrage," said Michael Singer, executive producer of the investigative 
unit and former news director at KCBS Channel 2, who added that CBS has strict 
rules prohibiting such a situation. "Whether Mike Gage has a conflict is not 
the issue. The issue is that there is an appearance of a conflict. He was a 
deputy mayor. He has a political agenda and is involved with an agency that has 
an enormous amount of power in Los Angeles. The idea that he could act in an 
objective way on stories that may involve his friends or political allies or 
the DWP is asking the impossible." 
</P>
<P>
"This is something we would not do because he could not be expected to report 
objectively," said Dick Tuininga, news director at KTTV Channel 11. "It is 
unrealistic to expect that a reporter in a major-market operation could divorce 
himself of all of the influences of the city. No matter what he was reporting 
on, his objectivity would be in question." 
</P>

Valenta was on vacation and unavailable for comment. KNBC General Manager John 
Rohrbeck could not immediately be reached, nor could Gage, who resigned as 
Bradley's chief deputy a year ago. When word of his KNBC job surfaced earlier 
this week, Gage had said that he had no intention of resigning his post with 
the DWP. 
</P>
<P>
KNBC spokeswoman Regina Miyamoto said, however, that Gage's primary 
responsibility at the station, education, has nothing to do with the city 
government. 
</P>
<P>
In other newsroom changes at KNBC, Pete Noyes, a 29-year veteran in broadcast 
journalism and managing editor at the station since 1985, will move to the 
newly established position of executive producer of investigative coverage. In 
his new job, Noyes, who set up a now-defunct investigative unit at the station 
with reporter Warren Olney in 1979, will tackle both short-term and long-term 
investigative projects. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Boles, currently executive producer of WESH-TV in Orlando, Fla., will 
assume Noyes' job as managing editor early next year. Boles is a former 
producer for ABC News who also has done news management stints in Chicago, 
Houston and Dallas.

GLENDALE CABLE COMPANY YANKS MADONNA VIDEO

A Glendale cable TV company removed Madonna's new video "Justify My Love" from 
its Video Jukebox channel this week after receiving "lots of complaints from 
parents," the general manager says. 
</P>
<P>
"We're real sensitive to the cities we serve," said Shirley Orr of Sammons 
Cable. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't carry the Playboy Channel or anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
The Video Jukebox Network is a national cable channel that offers viewers the 
chance to select what they want to see from a menu of about 100 videos. Each 
selection costs $3. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna's video, which had been rejected by MTV because it is apparently too 
sexually explicit, had been available on the Video Jukebox Network since last 
weekend. Orr said that since every subscriber, including children, can see the 
video once it is selected and paid for by just one other subscriber, the cable 
company decided to eliminate it from the selections on its system. 
</P>
<P>
"Justify My Love" can still be seen on the Video Jukebox Network on most cable 
companies across the country that carry the channel, including United Artist 
Cable in the west San Fernando Valley and Comcast Cablevision in northern 
Orange County. STEVE WEINSTEIN

A HARD DAY'S NIGHT FOR JOHN LENNON TRIBUTE; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: INTERNAL FIGHTING, FAILURE TO GET BIG NAMES TO COMMIT CAUSE CONCERT 
TO FALL SHORT.

<P>
Two L.A. lawyers had a great idea for a big, big rock concert. 
</P>
<P>
One of them had what's known in show business as "a relationship" with Yoko Ono 
and they decided that, with her blessing, they could stage an internationally 
televised concert tribute to John Lennon. It would be the creme de la creme of 
global rock events. Star after star would climb onstage to perform songs 
associated with the slain former Beatle. Maybe, just maybe, the other three 
former Beatles would even reunite for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
It all seemed perfect. What rock star would not want to get involved? 
</P>
<P>
TV viewers will have the chance to find that out tonight during the broadcast 
of the syndicated program "A Tribute to John Lennon" (8 p.m. on KTLA Channel 
5). 
</P>
<P>
A far cry from the original grandiose vision, the Lennon tribute show is a 
mish-mash of performance footage taken from the concert that ultimately took 
place last May in Beatle-birthplace Liverpool, and old videos donated by 
musical luminaries who either couldn't or wouldn't participate in that show. 
Needless to say, there was no Beatles reunion. 
</P>
<P>
The host is Michael Douglas, who glues the package together with patter about 
Lennon's life and work ("John began to write introspective songs, expanding his 
craft with lyrics that expressed his concerns as a man. . . ."). Christopher 
Reeve, who hosted the Liverpool concert with similar narration, has been 
totally extracted from the TV show. 
</P>
<P>
Even the air date, the 10th anniversary of the night that Lennon was fatally 
shot in New York, marks a significant change of plan. The program was 
originally set for broadcast Oct. 9, to celebrate what would have been Lennon's 
50th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
The television show is the culmination of nearly everything that can go wrong 
in trying to produce the sort of global event pioneered by the wildly 
successful 1985 Live Aid concert. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. lawyers David Brody and John Espedal were the ones who first thought of 
staging a tribute to Lennon and got Yoko Ono involved. They also brought in 
executive producer Neville Bolt, who had produced the well-received "Nelson 
Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute" concert. 
</P>
<P>
Factional infighting eventually ensued, however, poisoning the atmosphere to 
the point that, by the time of the concert, Brody and Espedal were not listed 
in the credits. Nor are they credited in the TV show. 
</P>
<P>
"There's some internal things going on that I'd rather not comment on," says 
Brody. "Let's just say I would have been pleased if it had been more of a group 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
Bolt decided to hold the concert in Liverpool rather than in London, New York 
or Los Angeles, as originally planned. It would appear live around the world as 
a pay-per-view event and then be sold to a TV network in the United States and 
in other countries for rebroadcast. Profits would be donated to charity through 
John and Yoko's Spirit Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Liverpool, recognizing the opportunity to put itself in the world 
spotlight, agreed to a joint venture and lent the producers more than $340,000 
of seed money for the concert. The city also agreed to spend an additional 
$850,000 or so to improve the concert site and perform other work, with the 
understanding that they would be paid back half that amount. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to be seen sharing the recognition of John's genius," says Steve 
McGriskin, the city official in charge of concert plans. "We're also sensible 
people. We wanted the city to get publicity coast to coast in the States. The 
promotional aspects were very important." 
</P>
<P>
The show's producers began contacting the talent. Everybody seemed interested. 
There seemed to be a good shot that Elvis Costello would be musical director. 
Paul McCartney indicated he would do it. 
</P>
<P>
"Madonna and Michael Jackson were interested," says Daniel Kaufman, who was a 
partner with Brody in one of the entertainment companies involved in the 
production. "George Michael had two Lennon songs picked out that he was going 
to perform." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest stars in the world all seemed to be interested. But none ever said 
yes. "We just needed to get that one superstar," says Kaufman. "All you needed 
was that one sign that, yes, this was going to be a big event." 
</P>
<P>
But none ever did. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney sent a video that was played at the concert, but was quoted as saying 
that he didn't think the show was something Lennon would have liked. 
</P>
<P>
Various reasons are cited for the lack of stars. Liverpool official McGriskin 
believes the concert came at a time when the top stars had already appeared in 
numerous charity mega-events. Among those who did show up were Cyndi Lauper, 
Hall &amp; Oates and Dave Edmunds. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets went on sale for 25 ($42.50 at that time), a steep price by any 
standard, let alone in economically depressed Liverpool for a show with no 
A-list performers. 
</P>
<P>
David Ravden, the accountant for the production, declined to give any financial 
figures about the cost of putting on the show, the income generated or how much 
will ultimately go to charity. "Some people like to be muckrakers," he says. "I 
don't want to provide ammunition for them." He said he will make the figures 
public eventually. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman is disappointed by what happened with the show and dismayed over the 
lack of cooperation among the planners. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so interesting how things end up," he says. "John Lennon is a symbol for 
exactly what wasn't done here."

GULF CRISIS SPARKS INTEREST IN CLASSES ON MUSLIMS, ISLAM; 
</P>
<P>
MIDEAST: MAINLINE DENOMINATIONS ARE MOVING TO EDUCATE THEIR MEMBERS ON THE 
PEOPLE AND RELIGION IN THE AREA OF CONTENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE ELLEN CHRISTIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Mainline denominations across the country are taking steps to educate their 
members about the Muslim culture and the Islamic religion because of U.S. 
involvement in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Churches, synagogues and religious institutions are offering special 
instruction during adult Sunday school classes, simple after-church 
discussions, seminars and special programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew almost nothing about (Islam) before this," said Ken Ioso, who organized 
a three-week seminar on Islam for his adult class at Macalister-Plymouth United 
Church in St. Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know a lot; we were starting from ground zero," Ioso said. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledged John Borelli, who is in charge of interreligious relations for the 
National Conference of Catholic Bishops: "We as Christians need to learn more 
about Islam." 
</P>
<P>
Catholics, Presbyterians, Methodists, the United Church of Christ, the 
Disciples of Christ and Jews are among those offering the educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Joseph Bragg's adult church school class at the Avenue Christian 
Church in St. Louis, for example, has become a forum for political and ethical 
debate on the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
William Gepford, pastor of a Presbyterian Church in Dearborn, Mich., has given 
a dozen speeches on Islam in the last two months and has eight more scheduled 
before the end of December. He has had more than 40 requests for information 
and appearances at churches and organizations since the crisis. More than 25% 
of the city's roughly 86,000 population is Arab-American. 
</P>
<P>
Many people are looking to religious institutions where knowledge "can be 
apolitical and unbiased," said Gepford, who is also director of the 
Presbyterians' Interfaith Ministry in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"People are asking the question, Why are we there?" Gepford said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have attended the educational programs said they have learned a 
variety of things. 
</P>
<P>
Ioso said the classes in St. Paul taught him what the daily life of a Muslim is 
like. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Riggs said he now understands some of the reasons that Saddam Hussein 
invaded Kuwait, thanks to classes at his Methodist Church in Ann Arbor. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq wants an access to the sea," Riggs said. "There is also a big oil field 
that straddles the border of Kuwait and Iraq." Riggs' classmate Fay Kincaid 
said she gained a clearer view of how the Arab population looked at the 
situation in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, our real object is what we can do to have peace there," Kincaid said. 
</P>
<P>
A basic study book on Islam, called "God is One," is still a bestseller after 
being on the market for almost two years -- an almost unheard-of selling stint 
for its Christian publisher. Requests for the book, published by Friendship 
Press, which is part of the National Council of Churches, have jumped since 
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.

Bragg, of Avenue Christian Church in St. Louis, teaches from a series of books 
and educational materials called "Discipleship Alive!" The series was put 
together by an interdenominational group of educators to elicit comments and 
discussion about contemporary events like the Gulf situation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But some Islamic groups and educators worry that much of the material and 
information available on Islam is incorrect and biased. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much misinformation out there," said Scott Easton of the 
Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee. 
</P>
<P>
John Woods, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University 
of Chicago, trains public school and religious educators to be become better 
instructors on Islam. 
</P>
<P>
"Islam is very misunderstood in this country," said Woods, even though "it is 
rapidly becoming the second-largest religion in the country." Woods estimated 
that there are about 5 million Muslims in America. 
</P>
<P>
A common misperception is that "if Saddam Hussein is a Muslim, and he does 
nasty and brutal things, then anything Muslim is brutal," Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
To help solve the problem, religious groups are seeking local specialists as 
instructors. For example, a history professor from the University of Michigan 
and other local scholars lectured during last month's study series on the 
Persian Gulf at the First United Methodist Church in Ann Arbor. 
</P>
<P>
Organized by the church's Peace Study/Action Committee, the course taught 25 
adults about the history, geography and political motivations of Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Chesbrough, who attended the classes, said it helped to hear from a 
variety of speakers in order to get different viewpoints. "If you get enough of 
them, you begin to be able to draw your own conclusions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Center for Global Education in Minneapolis has been deluged with more 
requests than it can handle from religious and civic organizations seeking 
guest speakers and information, said Ann Haften, the center's coordinator for 
communication and development. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are starting from scratch," Haften said. 
</P>
<P>
Some groups learn in informal settings, such as the gathering on a recent 
Sunday in Louisville, Ky. Christians, Jews and Muslims met at the local mosque 
"to address issues related to the Muslim faith," said Bette Levy of the 
Interfaith Task Force at the National Conference of Christians and Jews, which 
coordinated the event. 
</P>
<P>
Levy said the interdenominational gathering was aimed at combating prejudice 
against Arab-Americans. The Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee says 
there have been hundreds of reports of hostility and abuse toward 
Arab-Americans since the Gulf crisis began, Easton said. 
</P>
<P>
Places such as the Islamic Center of Southern California periodically offer 
public forums on timely topics in attempting to offset misconceptions. 
</P>
<P>
As Msgr. Royale Vadakin, an interfaith leader in Los Angeles pointed out, there 
is "a vast majority of people in the U.S." don't know that only 18% of all 
Muslims are Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
Some Catholic Churches are addressing the Gulf issue in dialogue groups. These 
formal discussion groups bring together Muslims and Catholics to help remove 
religious stereotypes and sort out political and social questions. The groups 
are meeting in several Catholic archdioceses nationwide, including those in Los 
Angeles, New York and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Matthew Simon of B'nai Israel in Rockville, Md., said that since most 
synagogues have ongoing adult education classes on comparative religion, the 
current Persian Gulf crisis has resulted in few new education programs. 
</P>
<P>
But on Yom Kippur afternoon, the rabbi said, he "taught" his congregation of 
1,200 about the historical relationship of Jews and Muslims.

DEPROGRAMMER ADMITS TARGETING AMISH WOMAN

<P>
A San Diego man who specializes in deprogramming cult followers has admitted 
that he had tried to change the religious beliefs of an Amish woman. 
</P>
<P>
Theodore Patrick Jr. of San Diego is being sought by police in the kidnaping of 
Elma Miller, who was taken from her parents' home Oct. 31 and held for 20 days 
while Patrick tried to sway her away from a religious splinter group. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick invented the term deprogramming and turned the controversial practice 
into a national movement in the early 1970s when parental complaints were on 
the rise over the activity of authoritarian Christian and Eastern-based sects. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the Ft. Wayne News-Sentinel, Patrick admitted 
taking part in the attempted deprogramming. "I don't know what they (police) 
are going to do," Patrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, 32, and her 9-year-old daughter, Annie, had lived in her parents' home 
since she left her husband earlier this year. On Nov. 19, Elma Miller escaped 
from a Mt. Vernon, Ill., farmhouse, telling police tales of being secreted from 
home to home in Michigan, Ohio and Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Her estranged husband, Ezra Miller, 37, of rural LaGrange; her brother, Alvin 
Yoder, 34; and Middlebury restaurateurs Robert Miller, 47, and his wife, Sue 
Miller, 44, have been charged with conspiracy to commit criminal confinement 
and conspiracy to commit burglary. They are free after posting bond. 
</P>
<P>
Charges may be filed against people in three states who allegedly hid Elma and 
Annie Miller in their homes, often keeping them in locked rooms, said LaGrange 
County Prosecutor Susan Glick. 
</P>
<P>
Charges also may be brought against Patrick, who allegedly led daily sessions 
intended to bring Elma Miller back into the Amish church. 
</P>
<P>
The deprogrammer wouldn't comment on the roles those charged played in the 
abduction, but in general terms defended their actions. 
</P>
<P>
"This man was legally married to her," Patrick said. "He had a right to take 
her and talk to her. He had a right to get his family. He knew she was in 
imminent danger." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick said Elma Miller was abducted because she had joined a liberal Amish 
sect whose charismatic leader is considering allowing his followers to have 
phones and electricity. Rumors have circulated in the mainstream Amish 
community that the sect's leader, Wilbur Eash, has supernatural powers. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy is nothing new for Patrick, said Anson Shupe, a sociology professor 
at Indiana University-Purdue University at Ft. Wayne. Shupe has written 
numerous books on new religious movements. 
</P>
<P>
Shupe worked with the LaGrange County Sheriff's Department to tentatively 
identify Patrick as the deprogrammer by matching the description of the man and 
his methods given by Elma Miller. 
</P>
<P>
"Deprogramming an Amish may be a first," Shupe said. "This is another bizarre 
story in his legend."

The Los Angeles Episcopal Diocese has defeated a resolution supportive of 
church blessings for faithful same-sex relationships. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal presented to delegates at last weekend's annual diocesan 
convention in Riverside avoided requesting specifically that ceremonies be held 
for committed gay and lesbian couples -- a much-debated issue opposed at the 
denominational level. 
</P>
<P>
The wording appeared to amount to the same thing, however, asking delegates to 
agree that the church "acts appropriately and for the good of the people of God 
when it upholds and celebrates, in the name of Jesus Christ, any two persons 
who are willing to make a lifelong covenant of fidelity and love with each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
Before the convention, Bishop Frederick H. Borsch of Los Angeles issued a 
statement saying that he lacked authority to sanction such blessings, but added 
that he has long worked toward that goal. "I believe that this blessing, 
together with support from the Christian community, can be strengthening for 
the couple, for their service and commitments, and for the larger society," 
Borsch said. 
</P>
<P>
Borsch said that Christians "of profound morality and deep compassion" stand on 
several sides of this question. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution was passed by the clergy, 91 to 55, in the bicameral convention, 
but lay delegates defeated the proposal in a standing vote by a 2-1 margin, 
according to a spokesman. Both "orders" of delegates needed to approve the 
resolution for it to be adopted. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. George Regas, rector of All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena, early 
last month told his parishioners that he has decided to bless committed 
same-sex relationships at some future date despite the denomination's current 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Regas said Thursday that he has appointed a parish task force to "make our way 
together on the best way to do that blessing." Regas said he and the bishop 
have discussed his plans, but the matter was left unsettled. "The bishop is 
supportive," Regas said, "but he is also supportive of church policy that says 
we don't do that." 
</P>
<P>
Borsch was not available for comment, but a diocesan spokesman noted that 
Episcopal Bishop William Swing of San Francisco has also backed the idea of 
same-sex couple blessings, but disciplined a priest who performed one without 
diocesan authority. 
</P>
<P>
In other convention action, the diocese became the fourth to protest its 
denomination's decision to keep the July, 1991, triennial convention in Phoenix 
despite Arizona voters' decision not to honor Martin Luther King Jr. with a 
paid state holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution "registering opposition" also petitioned Presiding Bishop Edmond 
Browning of the Episcopal Church to change the convention site. Browning, 
however, previously announced that the church will stay in Phoenix to support 
residents who are seeking adoption of the holiday. Anglican Archbishop Desmond 
Tutu of South Africa will speak in Phoenix in an anti-racism rally the day 
before the convention starts. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates also registered strong opposition to a military solution to the 
Persian Gulf crisis and defeated a resolution seeking "acknowledgement" of the 
traditionalist Episcopal Synod of America as a loyal body within the 
denomination. 
</P>
<P>
PILGRIMAGE 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Roger M. Mahony will leave Los Angeles today with 180 Catholics on a 
six-day pilgrimage to Mexico City. On Sunday they will participate in the first

a church to be built in her honor. Juan Diego was beatified by Pope John Paul 
II during his pastoral visit to Mexico this year. Mahony has been invited by 
Cardinal Ernesto Corripio Ahumada to concelebrate the feast day Mass with him 
and other prelates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>

MEXICO AGREES TO TALK ABOUT BINATIONAL AIRPORT 
</P>

<P>
After initial meetings this week with a San Diego-area delegation, Mexican 
officials have agreed to further talks on the proposed binational airport on 
Otay Mesa, which would be run jointly by Tijuana and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
A senior official in the Mexican Communications and Transportation Ministry 
said Friday that the government is willing to discuss the idea, but would 
prefer that U.S. federal officials be included in future talks. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to create an informal joint study group to explore the 
issue further, said delegate Jack Doyle, mayor of Santee and president of the 
San Diego Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
"Just to have a willingness (from the Mexican government) to participate with 
us in gathering more information is encouraging," Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings Thursday and Friday were the first direct attempt to gauge the 
Mexican government's interest in a binational airport, although San Diego 
officials have discussed the possibility intermittently for 20 years. Advocates 
see a binational airport as the best solution to crowding and lack of room for 
expansion at Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government's willingness to consider the airport is seen as an 
encouraging sign after reports in August that Communications and Transportation 
Secretary Andres Caso Lombardo opposed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"They have an ongoing plan and feel that their needs will be adequately met 
with their current plan," Doyle said after meeting with officials in the 
ministry. "However, they said they would be willing to look at other 
information." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is to build an airport between Brown Field Air Station on Otay 
Mesa and Tijuana's Rodriguez International Airport. Baja California state 
officials have called for expansion of Rodriguez airport, saying it is crowded 
and needs more air-control equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The California-Mexico Project at the University of Southern California has 
termed the airport one of "several worthwhile proposals that have thus far been 
stymied by funding constraints or by the political hurdles to cross-border 
projects." 
</P>
<P>
However, opponents Reps. Jim Bates (R-San Diego) and Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado) 
and San Diego City Councilman Bob Filner say the idea is impractical because of 
jurisdiction complications. 
</P>
<P>
Binational airport advocate Ron Roberts, whose City Council district includes 
Lindbergh Field, has said the critics dismiss the project "without even 
trying." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts led the delegation that also included Doyle, County Supervisor Leon 
Williams, Port Commissioner Dan Larsen and Kenneth E. Sulzer, executive 
director of the San Diego Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
The delegation met with Gustavo Patino, undersecretary of operations at the 
Communications and Transportation Ministry, which oversees airports, as well as 
Tourism Secretary Pedro Joaquin Coldwell and representatives from the Commerce 
Department, the presidential staff and private industry. 
</P>
<P>
One observer said the Mexican officials appeared interested in the idea, 
although not enthusiastic.

THREE HOUSES DESTROYED IN ARSON FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A fire visible for several miles destroyed a small apartment house and two 
vacant homes Friday in Southeast San Diego. Two firefighters were slightly 
injured battling the blaze, which authorities said was probably started by a 
transient. 
</P>
<P>
Total damage to the structures, in the 2500 block of Imperial Avenue, was 
estimated at $412,000. Smoke and water damage to an adjacent church and 
restaurant were minimal. 
</P>
<P>
The fire began in one of two vacant single-family homes and spread to the 
adjacent four-unit apartment house, which faces Imperial Avenue. Only one unit 
in the apartment building was occupied, by 80-year-old Geryl Walton, owner of 
the property, who escaped unharmed. Walton, who is coordinator for a city aids 
research program, was distraught, however, and was treated by paramedics at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an arson fire," San Diego Fire Department investigator Jeff Carle said. 
"There's been a recurring problem (with) transients and drug users on this 
lady's property, and we believe that they're responsible for the fire today," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The roof of the apartment building collapsed when firefighters first entered, 
causing them to approach the blaze much more carefully for fear of more 
structural weaknesses. In addition, firefighters found piles of highly 
flammable debris and stored materials inside the homes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what type of material was in there, but some (firefighters) said 
it was piled about knee-high," firefighter Mike May said. 
</P>
<P>
From the homes, the fire jumped to several nearby trees and then to the 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 75 firefighters and 20 fire engines battled the blaze for about 
two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Several blocks of Imperial Avenue and connecting streets were cordoned off, but 
only after several youths were arrested after they threw rocks at police and 
firefighters attempting to cordon off the area, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief Vic Smyth said two firefighters suffered minor leg injuries. A 
few firefighters were expected to stay at the scene throughout the night as a 
precaution against the fire reigniting.

PROSECUTORS CALL HARRIS' CLAIMS 'FANCIFUL FABRICATION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
State prosecutors Friday rejected as a "fanciful fabrication" new defense 
claims that authorities enticed a former cellmate to lie when he testified 
against condemned killer Robert Alton Harris in his 1979 trial. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the state attorney general's office urged the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals to refuse a key bid by Harris to avoid becoming the first to 
die in the gas chamber in California since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
The state lawyers said the defense claims came too late in the 12-year-old San 
Diego case -- and that new statements by a jailhouse informant charging that he 
was coached to commit perjury at the trial contained "bald-faced lies." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the new charges were true, the attorneys said, they should be 
disregarded in view of the "overwhelming" evidence that Harris deliberately 
killed his two teen-age victims. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing in these declarations (by the cellmate), even at this late date, 
suggests (Harris) did not commit the murders," the state said in a 28-page 
brief signed by Deputy Attys. Gen. Jay M. Bloom and Louis R. Hanoian. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers are seeking a retrial for Harris in the 1978 murders of John 
Mayeski and Michael Baker, both 16. If he loses in his latest round of appeals, 
he could be executed in the gas chamber next year. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Harris' attorneys asked the appeals court to order a federal 
district judge to hold a fact-finding hearing on their claims that authorities 
improperly recruited a cellmate to obtain incriminating statements from Harris 
while he was awaiting trial for the killings. 
</P>
<P>
The informant, Joey Dee Abshire, testified at the trial that Harris told him he 
killed the boys to prevent them from identifying him in a robbery. That 
testimony was supported by a sergeant with the San Diego County Sheriff's 
Department, who said he overheard Harris make the admissions to Abshire. Such 
evidence was important in showing that the killings were premeditated -- not 
impulsive -- making Harris eligible for first-degree murder and the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
In an affidavit dated Nov. 7, Abshire claimed authorities persuaded him to 
question Harris, provided him with details of the case, coached him on how to 
testify and then told him to lie about his role as a police agent. Abshire 
stood by his previous testimony that Harris said he killed to avoid 
identification -- but he disputed the deputy's testimony that Harris called the 
youths "punks" he had to "waste." 
</P>
<P>
State prosecutors said a new hearing should be denied "for a myriad of 
reasons." They said the new statements by Abshire and another former cellmate, 
Sonny Arthur Wisdom, lacked credibility coming 12 years after the events at 
issue. Abshire's statements recanting his trial testimony were also 
"convenient," in view of the fact that it is too late now to charge him with 
perjury, the lawyers noted. The state said there was considerable evidence to 
show that officials did not recruit Abshire and coach him.

SAGON PENN, WITH NEW NAME, BACK IN COURT FOR NEW TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Meecee Parks, formerly known as Sagon Penn, was back in court Friday as the 
defendant in another Superior Court criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
Parks is charged with two counts of altering a court-issued temporary 
restraining order to make it appear that the fiance of his ex-girlfriend was 
forbidden by court order from seeing the woman. 
</P>
<P>
Parks is also charged with one count of battery on the man, who is now married 
to the former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen Anear presented his case to the jury Friday. The 
defense phase of the trial will be presented Monday morning by attorney Mary 
Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, Anear told the jury that Parks was "essentially 
making a constant nuisance of himself" and was a "pest" to his former 
girlfriend, Donna Vanessa Parks. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying Friday was Maurice Bell, the man now married to Donna Parks. Bell 
said that Meecee Parks was "irritated" and "mad" when Parks arrived at his 
fiancee's apartment on the night of Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Bell quoted Parks as saying, "If I can't have them, no one will," which Bell 
said referred to his fiancee and her child. 
</P>
<P>
Bell testified that Parks grabbed him several times, hit him on the chest, then 
pulled up his shirt and said, "See, no bruises, no proof." 
</P>
<P>
When Parks was known as Sagon Penn -- he legally changed his name several 
months ago -- he was acquitted twice on charges of killing a San Diego Police 
officer and a civilian ride-along in a highly publicized incident with racial 
overtones.

JUDGE DELAYS ACTION ON POMERADO ROAD

<TEXT>
<P>
Poway's attempt to force neighboring San Diego to reopen Pomerado Road to 
traffic between the two cities was detoured Friday, dashing Poway city leaders' 
hopes of giving their constituents an early Christmas present -- the easing of 
ever-increasing traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Jeffery T. Miller ordered the North County community to 
present more evidence in its case against the city of San Diego. Poway contends 
that San Diego has no legal right to keep Pomerado Road blockaded now that a 
$3-million face lift has removed its hairpin turns and other traffic hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Miller set a Dec. 20 hearing for oral arguments by attorneys on both sides and 
ordered Poway City Atty. Stephen M. Eckis to submit further evidence on whether 
Pomerado Road is a major road, and whether it is specified as such in San 
Diego's general plan.

<P>
"Based upon this issue, the city of Poway feels confident that the judge will 
order the reopening of Pomerado Road following the hearing of oral arguments on 
Dec. 20," John Fitch, Poway's assistant city manager, said. 
</P>
<P>
Fitch conceded that Poway officials were "somewhat disappointed" that the judge 
did not order San Diego to reopen Pomerado Road immediately but said he remains 
confident that the smaller city will prevail. 
</P>
<P>
The battle over the road, a popular shortcut that bypasses a 3-mile section of 
Interstate 15 that slows to a crawl during commuting hours, began more than two 
years ago when San Diego annexed several hundred acres of land north to the 
Poway city limits. 
</P>
<P>
Pomerado, which runs through the annexed area, was ordered closed after the 
annexation because the narrow, winding roadway was considered a safety hazard 
that did not meet city street standards. 
</P>
<P>
Last month -- after the San Diego City Council had voted to reopen the newly 
contructed road, then reversed itself -- Poway sued San Diego, contending that 
the bigger city was violating state motor vehicle codes by blockading a 
traveled regional route. Local governments may close major roads temporarily 
for repairs or other safety regions, Poway argued, but cannot keep the roads 
closed after the safety hazards are removed. 
</P>
<P>
Les Girard, San Diego deputy city attorney, said Poway's attorney "is painting 
the issue all black or white." 
</P>
<P>
State laws allow a city to take such actions as closing a major road if certain 
specific actions are taken, Girard said, "and we took those actions in 1988, by 
amending the Scripps Miramar North community plan to provide that Pomerado Road 
would remain closed until another major road was completed" that linked Poway 
with Interstate 15 and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Poway's problem is that they did not challenge the action at that time," 
Girard said, "and now it is too late."

CONFUSION DURING TALK WITH DISPATCHER MAY HAVE LEAD TO SLAYING BY S.D. OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL BEN-ALI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police maintained Friday that the girlfriend of a man shot and killed by police 
a day earlier in South San Diego had told a dispatcher that the man was armed. 
</P>
<P>
But Lori Crosson said in a televised interview that, because she was trying to 
talk to the dispatcher and her irate boyfriend at the same time, the operator 
misunderstood her about whether her boyfriend had a weapon or gun. 
</P>
<P>
Richard W. Cross Jr. was shot by Paul Wright, 39, a 13-year police veteran, 
police said Friday. It was the first time the name of the officer who killed 
Cross was revealed. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, police identified the officer who shot and killed a suspect 
during a drug raid Wednesday as Detective Don Watkins, 38, also a 13-year 
veteran. That victim, who reportedly was slain while reaching for a gun, has 
not been identified. 
</P>
<P>
In the Cross slaying, a police emergency operator called Crosson when her 
number appeared on the dispatcher's screen after a "911 hang-up" -- an 
emergency call where the caller hangs up instead of making a complaint, Lt. Dan 
Berglund said. 
</P>
<P>
The operator asked Crosson if she had called 911, if the man was hitting her, 
if the man had a weapon, and if he had a gun. Crosson's response was yes to all 
the questions, Berglund said. Crosson replied no when asked if she could talk 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Crosson was crying and a man was heard yelling in the background, Berglund 
said. "You could hear this guy yelling, 'I know who you're talking to,' " the 
voice said. 
</P>
<P>
The dispatch went out as a domestic disturbance, and Cross was reported to have 
a gun, Berglund said. 
</P>
<P>
Wright and other officers then approached the apartment in the 2200 block of 
Palm Avenue, announced they were police, and pushed open the door Berglund 
said. Cross turned toward the door and Wright fired a single shot, striking 
Cross in the arm and chest. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, the officer realized (Cross) was unarmed and immediately started 
to render first aid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The woman called 911, asked for an ambulance and said the police had just shot 
her husband -- she referred to him as her husband -- and said it was an 
accident," Berglund said. "That was her initial statement." 
</P>
<P>
The only weapon found in the apartment was a knife, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Buck knife was found in a clothes basket, lying right on top of it, which 
was lying next to (Cross') right leg," Berglund said. "He could have had it and 
dropped it, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
But Crosson discredited the knife as Cross' weapon in the televised interview, 
saying the police might as well bring up her kitchen knife.

A Hawaii-based Marine, who in August became the first to refuse deployment to 
the Middle East, has been transferred to Camp Pendleton to be processed for 
release from active duty, the Marine Corps announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey A. Paterson, a 22-year-old corporal, was granted an administrative 
discharge Wednesday. He had applied for conscientious-objector status. He was 
transferred Thursday to Camp Pendleton to begin at least three days of 
processing, said Staff Sgt. Vicki Turney, a Camp Pendleton spokeswoman. 
</P>

Paterson will not be allowed interviews with the media until his processing is 
complete, Turney said. AMY WALLACE

<P>
What a shame it was to attend the San Diego State-Miami game and have only 
34,200 other "real fans" attend. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure next season the typical San Diego sports fans (also called 
"front-runners") will begin to show up and support the Aztec football program. 
</P>
<P>
Al Luginbill has turned the program around and is a top-notch coach. Look for 
San Diego State in the Top 20 for years to come. Maybe then, even the 
front-runners will regularly attend games.

SDSU HAS ITS HANDS, NOT ITS STANDS, FULL

<TEXT>
<P>
Among the reasons cited for poor attendance at San Diego State football games 
were the availability of so many other things to do in this area and lack of 
local media support. Hmm . . . 
</P>
<P>
In that same edition, we are informed that SDSU will make no refunds on tickets 
for the SDSU-Miami game, although game time has been changed from 7:05 p.m. to 
1 p.m., and some ticket-holders might not be able to make the earlier start. 
</P>
<P>
Those with "serious conflict" will be "accommodated" by having their tickets 
exchanged for a game (of equal or greater value?) next season. Contractual 
agreements with fans be damned. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU should consider changing its nickname from the Aztecs to the Cavaliers.

SDSU HAS ITS HANDS, NOT ITS STANDS, FULL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Fred Miller's bewilderment about SDSU not drawing large crowds 
at home football games, there are three main reasons for this situation. 
</P>
<P>
One, State is basically a commuter school. 
</P>
<P>
A large number of the students are from Orange County and L.A. After they 
attend their last class on Thursday or Friday, they pack their cars and head 
home, unless there is a good party planned. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, another large segment of the student body is made up of more mature 
students, especially ex-military, who are primarily concerned with getting 
their education and are not really into the "school spirit" thing. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, many of the people who live in San Diego have come here from someplace 
else. Their allegiance is still with their home-state team, be it Illinois, 
Penn State, etc. 
</P>
<P>
When you add to these factors the lack of local talent on the team, as well as 
the rowdy behavior of the "frat" boys in the parking lot, and add the parade of 
weak teams on the State schedule, it is not a mystery as to why they are not 
filling the stadium.

SDSU HAS ITS HANDS, NOT ITS STANDS, FULL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Scott Miller's article (Nov. 29) on low attendance at SDSU football 
games, I'd like to offer a few possible explanations for the apparent lack of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
First, as mentioned in the article, it is difficult to get excited about WAC 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, perhaps, a good number of SDSU students are older, with other 
interests that have higher priority than non-academic school activities. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the fact that games are played off-campus compounds the problem. 
At the University of Pennsylvania, where I was an undergraduate, most students 
can walk a few blocks to the stadium, so attendance of football games is very 
convenient. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it doesn't appear that SDSU has any strong, traditional rivalries. At 
Penn, not many students would pass up the chance to see Yale or Princeton 
possibly go down in flames. 
</P>
<P>
If people aren't in the habit of going to games, I don't think they can be 
expected suddenly to turn out en masse, even if the Aztecs have had two winning 
seasons.

TUSTIN BEATS CAPISTRANO VALLEY ON LATE JUMP SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was billed as an early showdown in the second week of the basketball season 
when second-ranked Tustin High School met fifth-ranked Capistrano Valley Friday 
night in the semifinals of the Trabuco Hills Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Although it's early in the season, the big game lived up to its billing when 
Tustin reserve guard Robert Laubach hit a baseline jump shot with 1:04 
remaining to give the Tillers a 61-60 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin (3-0) survived three Capistrano Valley shots in the final minute, 
including a three-point attempt by Cougar guard Tom Airey with two seconds 
left, to move into the championship game at 8 tonight against Marina. 
</P>
<P>
Marina (3-1) advanced with a 60-57 victory over J.W. North of Riverside behind 
the play of All-American center Cherokee Parks. Parks had 14 points, 16 
rebounds and three blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
Laubach had replaced the Tillers' top player, David Beilstein, with three 
minutes remaining when Beilstein fouled out after scoring 18 points. Laubach's 
shot erased Capistrano Valley's 60-59 lead taken when Airey hit a three-point 
shot with 1:35 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But the game was decided early in the fourth quarter when Capistrano Valley 
assistant Steve Scoggins was called for a technical foul after protesting a 
charging foul against Cougar center Brett McCorkle. 
</P>
<P>
McCorkle apparently had scored on the play, but the basket was disallowed and 
the subsequent technical resulted in a seven-point turnaround when Beilstein 
made two free throws and then hit a three-point shot to give Tustin a 52-45 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin center Brian Reider led all scorers with 21 points and had seven 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley (3-1) made only 20 of 59 shots and its two big men -- forward 
Steve Ransom and McCorkle -- had mediocre games. Ransom made only 2 of 10 
shots; McCorkle was five of 13 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a good team, and they beat us," Capistrano Valley Coach Mark Thornton 
said. "Still, we had our chances." 
</P>
<P>
In other Trabuco Hills tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Marina 60, J.W. North 57 -- Cherokee Parks' supporting cast, guards Sean 
Haselrig, Mike Carreon and Christen McLemore, were the difference in the game. 
Carreon scored 12 points, including three free throws and a basket in the final 
two minutes of play. McLemore added eight points. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei 82, Rancho Buena Vista 69 -- Forward J.J. Ballesteros had 18 points 
and teammate Reggie Geary added 17 points as Mater Dei (2-1) rebounded from its 
first loss in nearly a year. TOM HAMILTON

Western 69, Magnolia 38 -- Western (4-0) powered its way to the championship at 
Garden Grove High School. 
</P>
<P>
Magnolia (3-1), which upset Laguna Hills Thursday, was unable to handle the 
Pioneers' full-court pressure and height advantage and fell behind, 14-5, in 
the first quarter. After a brief rally that closed the gap to 18-15 early in 
the second quarter, Magnolia was never close again. 
</P>
<P>
In the third-place game, Laguna Hills nipped Buena Park, 73-71, as Brian Matsen 
scored 36 points including the winning basket at the buzzer. Garden Grove 
defeated Bolsa Grande, 66-54, in the consolation finals.

In the Valencia boys' tournament: 
</P>
<P>
Servite 59, Westminster 48 -- Servite used a stifling man-to-man defense to 
defeat undersized Westminster, 59-48, for the championship of the Valencia 
tournament at Valencia High. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Anderson, the only returning starter from Servite's Division III state 
champion team, led the Friars (4-0) with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, a swingman, added eight steals and was named the tournament's most 
valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Matt Kenney scored 16 for Servite and center Ryan Dodd added 10. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster is 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza 81, Cypress 48 -- Forward Joe Foss scored a tournament-high 36 points 
to pace the Aztecs in the third-place game. 
</P>
<P>
Katella 82, La Habra 60 -- The Knights were led by Kevin Carlson's 22 points in 
the consolation championship. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia 80, Santa Ana 77 -- Santa Ana's furious rally -- it outscored 
Valencia, 35-22, in the fourth quarter -- fell short and Valencia won the 
fifth-place game. The Saints are 1-2. STUART MATTHEWS

LEWIS, WILSON INJURED IN PRACTICE

<P>
The Chargers catch a bye this week, and just in time. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's practice the team lost a pair of wide receivers, including starter 
Nate Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who scored a pair of touchdowns in the team's 38-17 victory over the 
Jets, might have suffered a stress fracture in his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Walter Wilson, who started four games earlier this season, pulled a 
hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Quinn Early had missed Friday's practice with a bruised heel. 
Anthony Miller was kept on the sidelines all week to allow for an assortment of 
bruises to heal, and injured reserve wide receiver Ron Heard has been lost 
again after aggravating a quadriceps muscle. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going to do X-rays on Nate's hand, but it appears it's a stress 
fracture," Coach Dan Henning said. "It's in the bone that comes down to the 
wrist. He just caught a pass and fell down and took the pressure with his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"We think he will be able to play with some kind of cast on his hand, but we'll 
have to see. He's a punt returner and a receiver, and if it's debilitating to 
him, we'll have to go another way." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis leads the team with a 22.5-yard average on 17 kickoff returns, and has 
returned 13 punts with a nine-yard average. He's also caught 11 passes for 161 
yards with one touchdown. Wilson has 10 catches for 87 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Wilson will miss time," Henning said. "He may be out a week or two. He didn't 
have any range of motion at all." 
</P>
<P>
Henning says the personnel department has began looking for help at wide 
receiver, but no decisions are expected to be made until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The club released cornerback Joe Fuller, who was on injured reserve with a 
muscle pull in his thigh, Friday. Fuller started against Houston earlier this 
season and had an interception at Cleveland. T.J. SIMERS

CHAPMAN FINDS THE GAME IT EXPECTED AT LSU

BATON ROUGE, La.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Boyd keeps doing favors for Dale Brown. Nineteen years ago, when Boyd was 
men's basketball coach at Southern Cal, he turned down the LSU job and instead 
recommended Brown. And in the five years he was coach at Mississippi State, 
from 1981-86, Boyd lost to Brown and LSU eight of 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
Then last summer, Boyd called Brown and asked if his Chapman College team could 
come to Baton Rouge and play LSU. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Chapman's Division II status, Brown said yes, and the inevitable 
happened Friday night: 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, ranked 18th, shredded the Panthers, 101-68, before a paid crowd of 
11,488 in the Pete Maravich Assembly Center. 
</P>
<P>
"It only clearly points out what good friends we are and how long we go back 
together," Boyd said. "I'm talking about since the '50s." 
</P>
<P>
LSU won for the third time in a row to improve to 3-1; Chapman lost its third 
consecutive game to drop to 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
For LSU, this was a tuneup for today's game against No. 2 Arizona. Chapman 
plays today in Lake Charles, La., against 1-4 McNeese State, a Southland 
Conference school. 
</P>
<P>
"This game went about how I thought it would," Boyd said. "It fairly well 
depicted the relative strengths of the two teams. We might have been a little 
gun-shy early." 
</P>
<P>
What the Panthers understood was that to get to the basket, they had to go past 
Shaquille O'Neal, LSU's 7-1 sophomore center. In most cases, they didn't. 
O'Neal had six blocks -- three in each half -- and was a major reason Chapman 
shot just 39.7% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal played just 20 minutes and led LSU with 18 points and a game-high 16 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman was led by 6-4 junior Roger Middleton, who scored a game-high 22 
points. Andre Hill, a 6-2 senior, scored 14 points and had seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob's team is a little tiny small-college team, but they tried to execute as 
best they could," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to run the score up, and yet I was afraid of cutting it down too 
close and playing Mr. Nice Guy and then getting defeated. But it came out 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
It was evident from the start it would be just fine for LSU. The Tigers were 
much taller and quicker and built a double-digit lead less than four minutes 
into the game on a three-point shot by Mike Hansen Mejias that made it 15-5. 
</P>
<P>
That marked the start of a 17-3 run, capped by an O'Neal jam, that made it 29-8 
with 10:59 left in the half. Chapman got the lead to less than 20 just twice 
after that.

SYRACUSE DOES WHAT IT MUST BUT NO MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The outcome was never in doubt, but No. 4 Syracuse couldn't turn its 
opening-round game of the Carrier Classic into a rout at Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse sputtered to an 18-point first-half lead but failed to completely 
shake Division II Alaska-Anchorage on the way to a 103-85 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It might have seemed like we were toying with them, but we don't toy with 
anybody. They played a good game," said sophomore Conrad McRae, who joined 
Billy Owens as Syracuse's top scorers with 16 points apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had kept our starting five in, it would have made a big difference," 
said Owens, who played the longest of any starter, 31 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"The second team got to play long minutes. You have to get other players in a 
game like this, because they're not going to play in the close ones." 
</P>
<P>
Scott McCorkle, a freshman from Capistrano Valley, was one of the beneficiaries 
of the playing time, scoring 11 points. Syracuse finished with five players in 
double figures, including McRae, a sophomore whose previous best outing was 12 
points against North Carolina State. Freshman guard Adrian Autry had 15 on 
four-for-eight three-point shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse (6-0) meets North Carolina-Charlotte in tonight's championship game. 
The 49ers overcame a 22-point first-half deficit to defeat Florida 94-92 in the 
other opening-round game. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse appeared to be playing only as hard as they had to against the 
Seawolves (4-4), whose tallest starter was 6 feet 7. Syracuse led just 7-6 
after four minutes and was ahead, 24-18, after Mark Gisseman made two free 
throws with 7:57 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Then Autry came alive from beyond the three-point line. His third three-pointer 
in a three-minute stretch gave Syracuse a 39-23 cushion with 4:06 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse has never lost an opening-round game in the tournament it has played 
host to for 14 years.

SCOTT FINDS EL CAMINO'S COVERAGE TALK OFFENSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kearny's Darnay Scott hears the talk about being single-covered by El Camino 
defensive backs. He can't really believe it, but he likes what he hears. 
</P>
<P>
"If they play me one-on-one, it might be kind of easy," Scott said. "Even Morse 
double-covered me." 
</P>
<P>
But El Camino Coach Herb Meyer says he refuses to conform to everyone else's 
idea of how defense should be played -- even if the stakes are the the 2-A 
section title and he's playing against one of San Diego County's better wide 
receivers. 
</P>
<P>
"We play defense a lot different than most people," Meyer said. "We play 
bump-and-run, man-to-man. We're just going to continue what we've done all 
year." 
</P>
<P>
And that's just fine with Scott, although he'd advise otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they play a little too close," said Scott, who caught four passes for 
144 yards, including an 85-yard touchdown, against Ramona last week. 
</P>
<P>
The man assigned to shadow Scott, sophomore Bryant Westbrook, says he's ready 
for the assignment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be hard," he said. "He's a great athlete. Everybody's been 
talking about him. I'm pretty anxious to see what Darnay Scott is like. But I 
feel like I can handle it." 
</P>
<P>
If Meyer's game plan works, Westbrook, a first team All-Avocado League 
selection, will get some help from his defensive line and blitzing linebackers, 
Abdu McCullough, Dennis Duren and Dan Esposito. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we relieve pressure from the defensive secondary is to put pressure on 
their quarterback," Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Their quarterback is junior Sam Page, who has thrown for 1,459 yards and 15 
touchdowns. In last week's 35-22 semifinal victory over Ramona, Page had his 
best game of the year, completing nine of 13 passes for 280 yards and two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"He's making the right choices now," Kearny Coach Willie Matson said. "He's 
getting the ball into the athletes' hands." 
</P>
<P>
And Meyer says the athletes are spread out all over the field. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you're asking for trouble if you're concerned only about stopping 
Darnay Scott," he said. "They've got a lot of other people who can hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore James Curtis is Kearny's most dangerous running back. He has rushed 
for more than 1,100 yards and is averaging 11 yards a carry. Against Ramona, 
Curtis took a simple pass in the flat, and 52 yards and few seconds later, he 
was in the end zone. In addition to Curtis, there are junior Ted Mack and 
seniors Chris Richmond and Donnell Davis. 
</P>
<P>
In a typical year, Meyer would be able to boast the same kind of athletes that 
Kearny has. In fact the last time Kearny and El Camino met, 14 years ago in the 
section finals, Meyer came to the Stadium equipped with running Toussaint Tyler 
and wide receiver Dokie Williams. Tyler went on to play at the University of 
Washington. Williams played at UCLA and later in the NFL. El Camino won, 39-28. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, Meyer's only returning offensive starter was halfback Von 
Robinson. And Robinson is likely to miss tonight's game with two cracked bones 
in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who injured his hand two weeks ago against Escondido in the 
quarterfinals, has rushed for more than 1,100 yards and 20 touchdowns. Although 
he practiced this week with a soft cast on his hand, Meyer said it was doubtful 
he would play. 
</P>
<P>
"If he were able to play even a little bit, it would help us," Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Without Robinson, El Camino has relied more on junior quarterback Noel 
Prefontaine. And Prefontaine has been coming through. He has thrown five of his 
eight touchdown passes during the Wildcats' three playoff games. Last week 
against La Jolla, he tossed three touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
And Prefontaine began the season as a third-stringer. 
</P>
<P>
"He's developed a great deal of confidence in what he's doing, " Meyer said. 
"He's been making some big plays." 
</P>
<P>
If can continue to make big plays for one more night, Meyer just might walk 
away with his fifth section title in 15 years at El Camino.

KINNEY CROSS-COUNTRY CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What -- This is the only national championship event in high school sports. It 
is the culmination of four regional qualifying meets. 
</P>
<P>
The top eight boys and girls from those regionals will run a 5,000-meter course 
in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
Where -- Balboa Park's Morley Field will be the race site for the 10th 
consecutive year. The course is considered among the nation's most challenging. 
</P>
<P>
When -- The girls' race begins today at 10 a.m. and the boys' race will start 
at 10:45. 
</P>
<P>
Who -- Louie Quintana of Arroyo Grande, third place last year and the first 
underclassmen to finish, is expected to have little competition in the boys' 
race. Already this year he has won the Stanford Invitational (14:47), the 
Virginia Invitational (15:26) and the Clovis Invitational in Fresno (14:56). 
His times at Stanford and Virginia set course records. The two favorites in the 
girls' race -- Melody Fairchild of Boulder, Colo., and Deena Drossin of of 
Agoura -- should duel for the title. Fairchild is attempting to become the 
second person to win two consecutive championships. Erin Keogh managed the feat 
in 1985-86. Fairchild recently won the Colorado State championships by two 
minutes and 30 seconds. Drossin of Agoura finished the West regional at 17:07, 
the fastest time in any regional. Fairchild clocked a 17:08 in the Midwest 
regional. Don't be fooled by Drossin's superior time, however. All courses are 
different and Fairchild has not lost a cross-country or track race since May 
1989. Fallbrook's Milena Glusac, a sophomore, is the only San Diego-area 
entrant. She finished third in the West regionals (17:25) and may have an 
advantage, having run at Morley Field in Section championships for two years.

SWEETWATER'S SANCHEZ QUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andy Sanchez, coach of the Sweetwater High football team the past three 
seasons, resigned Friday, ending weeks of speculation. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez cited time constraints as his primary reason. 
</P>
<P>
He also is director of the Sweetwater Learning Center, a highly regarded 
program for students who have fallen behind academically. He resigned as coach 
after pondering the decision for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I was relieved that I resigned, but at the same time, I was saddened," Sanchez 
said. "I'm going to miss it. I'm going to miss the kids, but it's time to move 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez's teams were 17-15, including 7-4 this year after the Red Devils lost 
to Rancho Buena Vista in the first round of the section 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez' replacement could be the man he replaced, Gene Alim, who was 74-9-1 
from 1981 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"More than likely, Gene will put his name in the hat, and I don't think he'll 
be refused," Sanchez said. "Whoever gets the job, I wouldn't mind helping out 
(as an assistant coach)." 
</P>
<P>
As a wide receiver at Castle Park High, Sanchez was the section player of the 
year in 1969. In 1968, he led the Trojans to the county championship. He later 
played with the Memphis Southmen of the World Football League. Also on that 
team were Larry Csonka, Jim Kiick and Paul Warfield. JIM LINDGREN

YOUNG PIANIST HITS KEYS BUT MISSES SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In his local debut with the San Diego Symphony, Brazilian pianist Jose Carlos 
Cocarelli demonstrated the virtues that have won him numerous awards, including 
second prize in the 1989 Van Cliburn competition. Cocarelli's percussive, 
rhythmically incisive technique handily exploited the virtuoso brilliance of 
Prokofiev's familiar Third Piano Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
Cocarelli mastered all of the composer's daunting keyboard requirements: the 
whirlwind octaves, the rapid cross-hand passages, and the finger-stretching 
dense textures. 
</P>
<P>
What eluded this young performer, however, was a sense of Prokofiev's 
sophisticated musical style. Music director Yoav Talmi and the orchestra 
underscored the sardonic twist to the middle movement's march theme, for 
example, but these nuances eluded Cocarelli's unyielding, humorless approach. 
</P>
<P>
The initial allure of Cocarelli's well-disciplined athleticism wore thin as 
Thursday's concerto progressed. And, in the final movement, Cocarelli pounced 
on the keys with a Bartokian fervor that sounded much too brutal for Prokofiev. 
</P>
<P>
The concert's real star was Talmi, who took Cesar Franck's D Minor Symphony and 
made the old warhorse sound fresh and vital even to jaded ears. The brilliance 
of the brass sections and unusually sweet sonorities from the strings could not 
have been more persuasive. The knowing conductor subordinated Franck's 
constantly fluctuating moods to a clear vision of the symphony's overall shape. 
Talmi found grandeur where many conductors mine only bombast, and, as usual, 
Talmi's pacing was superb. 
</P>
<P>
To open the concert, in memory of Aaron Copland, who died Sunday at age 90, 
Talmi chose the composer's "Quiet City" for trumpet, English horn and strings. 
The work's somber, elegiac quality proved a fitting, understated tribute to a 
composer whose popular image has been unfortunately linked to a constricted 
canon of rambunctious ballet scores. English horn player Sidney Green and 
principal trumpet Calvin Price traversed the wistful solo lines with stylish 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
After the Copland, Talmi and the orchestra offered a calm, sonically shimmering 
interpretation of Ravel's "Mother Goose" Suite. Knowing that this precious 
bauble can easily descend into a chain of clever effects, Talmi elicited a 
measured but graceful, dreamlike progression until the poignant climax of the 
final movement.

"I can't tell a lie any longer." 
</P>
<P>
It's a line Holly Hughes repeats often. It's a line she uses to anchor some of 
her wilder tales as if to say she is not trying to offend anyone -- she is 
merely trying to tell the truth. 
</P>
<P>
In her revealing performance-art monologue, "World Without End" Thursday at the 
Sushi Performance Gallery, Hughes may talk about being a lesbian, about hating 
men and making love with them, about the shock of seeing her mother naked and 
about her mother using her naked body as a way of demonstrating the facts of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
But, despite the heightened expectation of confrontation that has come with a 
Hughes performance ever since the National Endowment for the Arts rescinded a 
grant this summer, the overwhelming feeling here is that what is said is not 
said to shock. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes says it because it is true -- and because she is sorting out where she 
has come from to try to understand where she is and where she is heading. Along 
the way, Hughes has picked up some insights that may prove useful to others, as 
in pointing out that to no mean extent, we are all groping our way through life 
by the light of what our parents taught us. 
</P>
<P>
The backdrop for the show, appropriately, is a constellation chart, but the 
constellations are not Orion or Ursa Major. Instead they take the form of 
Cinderella's slipper and a stork and a bed and a coffee pot, the shape of 
Hughes' mother's life. The light from these images underscores the warning from 
mother to daughter: "I don't want you to be like me. I don't want them to do to 
you what they did to me." 
</P>
<P>
What you feel here is what is conveyed by all important art -- that these 
stories, linked together by reflections on her mother's death, really happened, 
at least on an emotional level. You feel that these stories matter. Each story 
is a puzzle, and the puzzle must be solved to understand how all of these 
pieces of her life fit together. 
</P>
<P>
In "World Without End," Hughes has opened a window on an unusual life. 
</P>
<P>
And oddly, too, as open as she is, Hughes leaves you wanting more, as if pieces 
are missing from this patchwork quilt. 
</P>
<P>
What was her mother like before becoming the crazy, unhappy mother and wife 
(with a perpetually absent husband)? When did Hughes make her break from her 
mother's way of life? Did she ever make peace with that absent father? And does 
she ever consider what might have been? These are some of the missing pieces of 
the story. 
</P>
<P>
It was undoubtedly Hughes' choice of subject matter that frightened off John E. 
Frohnmayer, chairman of the NEA, who personally rejected Hughes' previously 
approved grant. (Frohnmayer, reportedly, has never seen the show.) 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Hughes, all dolled up in a glamorous gown with a black lace slip 
peeking out, doesn't seem all that comfortable with talking about herself. She 
laughs to reassure after she's said something that may sound particularly 
outrageous. She looks nervous from time to time. She seems vulnerable. She 
starts the opening scene sitting on a chair with her back to the audience, 
almost as if she needs a few minutes to build up her confidence before facing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The overall sensation she conveys is that she is having an open, intimate 
encounter with each individual in the space that she commands with such seeming 
effortlessness. She jokes at her own expense. She strides purposefully around 
the room, only to follow up with: "This is what they call using the space." 
</P>
<P>
She breaks the monologue to meet the eyes of people in the audience and 
addresses them directly. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you hungry? If you are, we can stop. I know a great place . . . " and "You 
mad at me? You going to leave? This is the time when most of the people leave 
who are going to leave" and "If you do all leave, I can go home early. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
She gives one the feeling of being at the other end of a tete-a-tete, hearing 
the kind of things said only in the most unguarded moments. The piece, which 
she has done many times since she debuted it in 1989 may be scripted, but it is 
impeccably directed by Kate Stafford with up-to-date references on Hughes' 
battle with the NEA that heighten the sense of spontaneity in her fluid, often 
urgent delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes has an expression for knowing someone else's secret language -- their 
language of tears and fears. It is called learning their French. She began by 
studying her mother's, her own and her acquaintances'. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes will continue teaching you her French through Dec. 16 at Sushi. And, if 
you're a good student, she may put you in touch with your own French, a 
language just below the subconscious that may be more familiar than you think. 
</P>
<P>
The audience at the Sushi Gallery, which can accommodate 120, numbered about 50 
Thursday. Larger crowds are expected this weekend.

RECRUITERS FIND SCHOOLS AREN'T AT THEIR SERVICE; 
</P>
<P>
ENLISTMENT: STUDENTS IN RICH DISTRICTS, WITH SIGHTS SET ELSEWHERE, ARE 
VIRTUALLY UNTOUCHABLE FOR THE MILITARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A high school senior, Tim Gibson has his sights set on an academic scholarship 
to New York University, where he hopes the school's business program will turn 
him into a wealthy stockbroker. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Mancuso, a junior fullback and nose tackle, dreams of someday winning a 
place in the tradition-rich football backfield at USC or UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Both Newport Harbor High School students, Gibson and Mancuso represent the 
hopes and dreams of most young people. But for military recruiters, these 
students and other products of schools in wealthy Orange County beach 
communities are virtually untouchable in the hunt to fill out the military's 
volunteer forces. 
</P>
<P>
Students in these areas come mostly from well-to-do backgrounds where the 
median household income is more than $60,000 per year and enlisted military 
service often is not even considered an option. In good years, recruiters say 
there is cause to celebrate if one or two students from the affluent 
communities make commitments to the enlisted services. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, at Estancia High School in neighboring Costa Mesa, where the 
median income is about $40,000, Army recruiters say they can expect seven or 
more students to enlist this year. Recruiters also have a much easier time 
approaching potential candidates in even less affluent cities, such as Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma that local recruiters face takes on added significance because of 
the growing controversy about the mix of U.S. troops being deployed to the 
Persian Gulf. The troops going there are predominantly minorities and 
less-affluent whites. 
</P>
<P>
In upper-class communities, local recruiters say that they are resorting to 
unusual methods to overcome roadblocks thrown up by uncooperative school 
administrators and parents in Irvine, Corona del Mar and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
One Army officer who trains recruiters for service in the county says the 
reception by school administrators in wealthy coastal schools has been so 
unwelcome that he advises his recruiters to cultivate school janitors as 
sources of valuable information about potential recruits. 
</P>
<P>
"In Irvine or Corona del Mar, if a kid joins the Army he's considered a rebel," 
said Sgt. Gary Watkins of the Army's recruiting station in Santa Ana. "They are 
closed. They let you know that. They look at you like you are not wanted." 
</P>
<P>
With tensions rising in the Persian Gulf, Marine Staff Sgt. Hector Martinez 
said his recruiters are encountering more parents who have carried strong 
anti-war sentiments since Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"The flower children," Martinez said, describing those unreceptive parents, 
"they use it (Vietnam) as an excuse." 
</P>
<P>
Chief Petty Officer Ernie Howton, who heads the Navy's recruiting station in 
Costa Mesa, said the affluence and abundance of educational opportunities makes 
Orange County one of the most difficult recruiting areas in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere within the county is it more difficult than in Newport Beach and Corona 
del Mar. In these communities, Army recruiters say they take into account 
student career opportunities that accompany wealth, and their recruiting goals 
are actually adjusted downward. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in Newport Beach and Corona del Mar, where the median household 
income is an estimated $60,600, according to the National Planning Data Corp., 
recruiters at the Army's Costa Mesa station said their goal from those cities' 
two high schools combined is to sign up three students this year. 
</P>
<P>
School administrators at Newport Harbor High and Corona del Mar High, however, 
say recruiters enjoy good access to their schools. It's only that students from 
wealthier communities tend to have more options open to them after high school 
and enlisted military service is not at the top of their lists, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"I think kids ought to do what they want to do," said Tom Jacobson, principal 
at Corona del Mar High. "But I think it is fair to say that school communities 
in Corona del Mar or Newport Beach probably don't view military service as 
their goal. Some 90% of our kids go on to post-secondary education." 
</P>
<P>
While interest in the enlisted ranks may be down among his students, Jacobson 
said some have sought places in the military service academies. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the actual number of enlistments, recruiters say another measure 
they use for student interest in the military each year is the number of young 
men and women who take the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, or 
qualifying exam. 
</P>
<P>
This year at Newport Harbor High (enrollment 1,250) and Corona del Mar High 
(enrollment 1,169), a total of 83 students took the exam. Across town, more 
than 200 students took the test at Costa Mesa High School, enrollment 980. 
</P>
<P>
Some recruiters who make more than 70 telephone calls a day to the homes of 
prospective enlisted men and women are frustrated, especially by the responses 
they say come from parents in the county's more affluent areas. 
</P>
<P>
"If I wanted my son in the Army, I'd buy him one," said Watkins, quoting the 
recent reaction of one parent to a recruiter's call. "The people are very 
adamant. They say, 'Don't call back here.' 
</P>
<P>
"They'll give you a dissertation and tell you that it (Vietnam) was an unjust 
war. These are the people who tell you, 'Not my son. My son is going to 
Berkeley.' " 
</P>
<P>
The same message is communicated on the high school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
"No, thanks," Tim Gibson said when asked about his prospects for enlistment 
from Newport Harbor High. "I'm trying for a scholarship, academic or football. 
There's no way I'd do it." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Mancuso, whose pursuit of college sports is pushing him on to college, 
said most of his classmates are on similar career paths. 
</P>
<P>
"They would rather do other things," he said, sitting outside school on a 
recent evening, waiting for a ride home. 
</P>
<P>
Army Staff Sgt. Benjamin Guzman said that sometimes the negative responses to 
his inquiries come with a figurative kick in the pants. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he said, a display of brochures at Corona del Mar High promoting 
service in all branches of the military was sabotaged when flyers from an 
anti-war group based in Philadelphia were found stuffed inside the government 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Guzman said the same high school turned down the Army's invitation for its 
teachers to join recruiters for a catered lunch so that enlisted military 
service opportunities for students could be discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson said the incident with the flyers was not reported to him, but he 
indicated that it could have happened, given the diverse interests of student 
groups, some of which are unknown to him. 
</P>
<P>
As for the lunch, Jacobson said the school receives frequent invitations to 
similar events. 
</P>
<P>
"We make a lot of choices," Jacobson said. "Some things just don't get done. We 
don't appear at everything. Teachers teach all day long." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Evans, Newport Harbor High principal, said his school has done all it 
can to cooperate with military recruiters. He said the root of the military's 
dissatisfaction probably lies in Newport Mesa Unified School District's refusal 
to turn over the names, addresses and phone numbers of its graduating seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Although recruiters say other districts provide the valuable information in 
various forms, Evans said the district has discontinued the practice at the 
urging of parents, who began complaining about the influx of telephone calls 
and junk mail to their homes from several sources. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't treat the military any different than we do people from Princeton or 
Stanford," Evans said. "The military is treated exactly the same. Military 
recruiters would love for us to provide them the data. It makes their work a 
little more difficult. We won't give that list to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
On other local campuses, particularly in areas where the household incomes are 
not as high, recruiters say they are warmly received. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent trip to neighboring Costa Mesa High, where students come from more 
middle-class backgrounds, Guzman's visit began with a chat with a school 
guidance counselor who had nothing but praise for the opportunities enlisted 
military service offers. 
</P>
<P>
"College is a status symbol," said the counselor, who declined to be named. 
"Parents project them (children) into four-year colleges. They think their kids 
deserve much better than military service. Some could benefit from the 
discipline the military service has to offer."

JAIL SAGA TAKES YET ANOTHER NEW TWIST; 
</P>
<P>
CORRECTIONS: ANAHEIM MAYOR SAYS COUNTY SHOULD SCRAP PLANS FOR GYPSUM CANYON. 
IRVINE CO. REPEATS INTENTIONS TO BUILD HOUSING ON THE SITE.

<P>
Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter said Friday that county officials should once and for 
all scrap plans to buy Irvine Co. land for a jail in Gypsum Canyon and instead 
put the facility on county property elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't believe that some members of the Board of Supervisors have 
continued to force putting the jail at Gypsum Canyon," Hunter said. "Why don't 
they put it on land they already own . . . and keep their mouths shut and then 
build the jail?" 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. owns a 2,500-acre parcel in Gypsum Canyon, just east of Anaheim, 
and county officials are seeking the site for construction of a massive new 
jail needed to relieve overcrowding in the county system. 
</P>
<P>
The company has long planned to build thousands of single-family houses on the 
site. But on Thursday, executives told The Times that the firm would be willing 
to discuss options with county officials. 
</P>
<P>
The report infuriated Gypsum Canyon jail opponents who feared it signaled a 
change in the company's position. On Friday, Irvine Co. executives reacted 
quickly, firing off a letter to supervisors restating their intention to 
develop homes in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Vice President Gary Hunt wrote that the Times report created "some 
misconceptions" that the company is willing to sell the land. In the same 
letter, however, Hunt acknowledged that, "As always, we are willing to listen 
to and meet with the county regarding this issue." 
</P>
<P>
Such a meeting could occur in the near future, as a majority of supervisors say 
they plan on Dec. 18 to authorize staff members to begin formal negotiations 
with the developer. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of negotiations concerns Anaheim officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The Irvine Co. has assured us that they still want to go forward (with plans 
for a residential development) . . . but who knows what's going to happen at 
the negotiating table?" said Kristine Thalman, intergovernmental relations 
officer for Anaheim. "So, yes, we have to be cautious." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hunter: "We've been working very closely with the Irvine Co. They have 
really no intentions of selling Gypsum Canyon to the County of Orange. Sure, 
they say they will look at all the options, but the way the article came out 
today, it caused a lot of furor in my city. A lot of people were upset." 
</P>
<P>
Some county officials speculated that the Irvine Co.'s letter Friday was 
designed to appease Anaheim officials, who are fiercely opposed to building a 
jail in their back yard. 
</P>
<P>
County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider and others even suggested that 
the company's reaction was part of an effort to increase the value of the land. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say they are in a difficult spot in terms of walking the line between 
the City of Anaheim and the county," Schneider said. "If they sell it to us, 
they are in trouble with the city of Anaheim and the Anaheim council and with 
two of our board members. And if they don't sell it to us they're in trouble 
with three (supervisors)." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Roger Stanton, who supports jail construction in Gypsum Canyon, 
added: "The letter to me says someone is taking shots at them, and if someone 
did that (on Friday) then that is irresponsible and the Irvine Co. is trying to 
be responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Company Vice President Hunt said Schneider is mistaken if he believes that the 
letter was meant as a bargaining chip. 
</P>
<P>
"That's absolutely inaccurate," Hunt said. "Our business is building planned 
communities. . . . Our goal is not to go into this process to increase the 
value of the land, our goal is to go through this process to build a planned 
community." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors, under growing pressure to relieve overcrowding in the county's 
jail system, have not been able to come up with the necessary four votes to 
acquire the land through condemnation -- the taking of property from an 
unwilling seller. 
</P>
<P>
Stanton chided Anaheim officials for presenting another roadblock in the long 
quest to solve the jail overcrowding mess. 
</P>
<P>
"I would only like to say to Mayor Fred Hunter and the other council members: 
'Wake up and realize that Measure A that was on the June ballot (to put the 
jail in Santa Ana, thus killing the Gypsum Canyon proposal) . . . did not pass 
in the City of Anaheim. That means that the vast majority of people in your 
city couldn't give a darn that that jail is in Anaheim or not. They just want a 
jail built,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they get that past their noses, maybe they'll leave the Irvine Co. alone, 
the county alone and let the county get on with the business of building the 
jail which is much needed," Stanton said. "I understand their position, but the 
county has an obligation to discuss this matter. Whatever we have to do to get 
the land we will do. Whatever the Irvine Co. has to do to comply with the 
environment around it, including the political environment, they will do."

COUNCIL OKS LOANS TO UPGRADE BUILDINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has unanimously approved a loan program to upgrade buildings 
in the downtown area in order to meet new earthquake standards adopted in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency proposed the loans as an incentive for property owners 
to make repairs by 1994 to those buildings that city engineers deem hazardous, 
according to agency manager Terry Galvin. 
</P>
<P>
The repair schedule was approved at Tuesday night's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, building owners will receive a $25,000 deferred loan that 
must be repaid when the property is sold. If rehabilitation costs exceed that 
amount, they are eligible for an additional $25,000 to $100,000, but the owner 
must come up with matching funds. This additional, interest-free financing 
requires repayment over a 10-year period beginning two years after completion 
of the work.ROSE APODACA

CITY MAY BUY GROVES TO PRESERVE THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The city may buy orange groves worth about $4 million in an area slated for 
development as a way to preserve open space and keep a link to Irvine's 
agricultural past, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-acre, L-shaped area along Jeffrey Road south of the Santa Ana Freeway 
could be leased to a farmer to pay for its upkeep and perhaps become part of a 
park as "a reminder of Irvine past," said Robert C. Johnson, the city's 
director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
The plan to buy the orange trees from the Irvine Co. has been discussed for 
about a year. The company's orange groves are in an area slated for future 
industrial and commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1989, the City Council asked its planning staff to talk with the 
Irvine Co. about buying a portion of the orange groves along Jeffrey Road and 
adjacent to the freeway. The city would purchase them using $4 million 
allocated to Irvine by a recent state ballot proposition to preserve open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Within the next few months, the city and Irvine Co. will jointly hire an 
appraiser to place a value on the land, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. hasn't committed to selling the land but is willing to talk with 
the city in order to see orange trees preserved, company spokeswoman Dawn 
McCormick said Friday. TOM McQUEENEY

OAK TREE IS SYMBOL OF A FREE ARMENIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just over two years ago, when sixth-grader Taleen Tertzakian visited her 
ancestral homeland, she stood in awe of a statue of Mother Armenia in the city 
of Leninakan. 
</P>
<P>
"It was beautiful," she said. "I was real happy." 
</P>
<P>
Just a month after her visit, the city was among those hardest hit by the 
Armenian earthquake, killing approximately 25,000 and devastating entire 
villages. But the statue of Mother Armenia survived. On Friday, that was a 
special memory in Taleen's mind as she and just over 100 students at Ari 
Guiragos Minassian Armenian School in Santa Ana remembered the devasting quake 
on its second anniversary. Carrying Armenian and U.S. flags, the students 
planted a new oak in front of a church adjacent to the school, and prayed for a 
new, independent and prosperous Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a symbol of how the new Armenia will grow," Taleen said after she had 
placed a red rose near the newly planted oak. "I'm always going to stay 
Armenian." 
</P>
<P>
Although most students didn't know or had never met their relatives in the 
hardest-hit areas, they said they felt a special kinship to them, especially 
after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt sad because all the innocent people died," said sixth-grader Hovsep 
Dakirmenjian, 12, of Santa Ana, the student council president. "There was no 
notice (of the tragedy). This tree will keep that memory alive and will grow 
with the students." 
</P>
<P>
"We have faith that one day we will go home and live in our home country that 
will be our own," Hovsep said. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony also was filled with hope, particularly because of a new spirit of 
nationalism that has arisen in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel kind of sad because of all the Armenians that died," said Taline 
Khojikian, who is the fourth grade. "My family was sad. But pretty soon the 
Armenians will be back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
At a church service after the tree-planting, however, the students and some 
parents were reminded of the hardships of Armenians because of the dismal state 
of the Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a half-million homeless," said Sarkis Yegenian of Cowan Heights, 
president of the school board. "Two years now, they are still in tents." 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's a complete mess, as are the other republics," said Taleen's 
mother, Sylvie Tertzakian, who visited Armenia in October with her husband, 
Garo. 
</P>
<P>
On their most recent visit, the Tertzakians, who live in North Tustin, toured 
hospitals and Garo, a urologist, treated dozens of patients. He had done the 
same two years ago just after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
But Sylvie Tertzakian said that even with the hardships, the people are excited 
about their new freedoms. While she was in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, she 
helped establish a sister-school relationship with School No. 58. Lillie 
Merigian, the principal of the Santa Ana school, is planning to visit the 
Armenian school next August. 
</P>
<P>
While talking to school officials on her visit, Sylvie Tertzakian even 
suggested that they name the school after an author or a poet. She recommended 
Moushegh Ishkhan Hamazkayin, a writer whose works had been banned before 
glasnost. The next day, the name was changed, a sign of how much freedom has 
come to the country. TED JOHNSON

VOTE SET IN MARCH ON TAX, SALARY PLAN

<P>
Advisory votes on a public safety tax, mobile home park rent control and a 
proposal to more than double City Council members' salaries will be included on 
Anaheim's special election ballot in March, the council decided on a 4-0 vote 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the council placed a measure on the March ballot that would open the job 
of mayor to any city resident by eliminating the current requirement that the 
post must go to a City Council member. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Irv Pickler was absent. 
</P>
<P>
The March election was called after residents proposing the mobile home park 
rent control ordinance gathered more than 16,000 signatures in support of an 
initiative to qualify it for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Residents will be asked to vote on Mayor Fred Hunter's proposed tax plan, which 
would declare the entire city a Public Safety Assessment Distict and ask 
residents if they are willing to tax themselves for more police, fire and 
paramedic services. The amount of the proposed tax has not been decided yet. 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimate that 40 additional police officers, and 20 non-sworn 
personnel are needed, at a cost of about $4.15 million. They did not provide 
any estimate, however, for the number of firefighters and paramedics sought. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot measure will ask residents if they favor the tax, leaving the 
details to be worked out by the council. 
</P>
<P>
Council members estimated roughly that the tax would be needed for 10 to 15 
years, even though they have not yet detailed the annual cost per household. 
</P>
<P>
Also, residents will vote on a measure to allow council members to increase 
their salaries from $400 monthly to $1,000 and boost the mayor's pay from $800 
monthly to the $1,000 limit. 
</P>
<P>
The new ordinance, if approved by the city's voters, would allow the council to 
increase salaries 5% annually beyond the $1,000 limit. 
</P>
<P>
This proposal is a scaled-down version of the council's earlier plan to triple 
their salaries to $1,200 monthly. LISA MASCARO

CITY TO BEGIN NEW RECYCLING PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents must sort their trash under a new recycling program that starts 
Monday, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at meeting a state law requiring cities to reduce the 
volume of garbage they produce by 25% by 1995 and 50% by the year 2000. Failure 
to comply will cost cities up to $10,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Each residence has been provided with two 110-gallon cans, a tan receptacle for 
household trash and a green can for recyclable waste, said Mark Gregorek, 
director of operations for Briggeman Disposal Services Inc., which is based in 
Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Residents do not have to divide recyclable waste further into stacks of 
newspaper, plastic or aluminum as in other cities' recycling programs. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the new containers are more than three times larger than standard 
30-gallon trash cans and should be all a single house needs, Gregorek said. But 
he said extra tan cans are available for $3.50 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Additional green cans are free to promote recycling. 
</P>
<P>
However, since the new system is automated and designed around the 110-gallon 
containers, it cannot accommodate standard cans or bags of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
The new program will add $2.40 more to the average $9.25 monthly disposal bill, 
which has caused some residents to complain that it costs more and provides 
less service than before, Gregorek said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are saying, 'Why do I have to pay more and separate my trash?' But 
that's not Briggeman Disposal dictating that, it's the society," he said. 
"We've thrown too much away over the last 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
"If Orange County doesn't do anything, in 10 years there's going to be no more 
landfill space. We'll have to haul it out to the desert by rail and they'll be 
having to pay four times what they're paying now," Gregorek said. "It's a lot 
cheaper to (recycle) now." JON NALICK

<P>
SAN LUIS OBISPO MAN BACKED FOR FIRE CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga said Friday he has recommended that the 
City Council hire San Luis Obispo Fire Chief Michael P. Dolder as the city's 
top fire official. 
</P>
<P>
Dolder, 46, San Luis Obispo's fire chief for the last eight years, would 
succeed retiring Fire Chief Raymond C. Picard. 
</P>
<P>
Dolder said that if he is hired, he would maintain residences in both San Luis 
Obispo and Huntington Beach. Because he has two daughters still in San Luis 
Obispo high schools, Dolder said, he plans to live in Huntington Beach during 
the week and return to his northern home on alternating weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Those plans prompted a recent letter to Uberuaga from three Huntington Beach 
Firefighters Assn. captains, questioning Dolder's commute. 
</P>
<P>
However, both Uberuaga and Dolder downplayed the letter. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as he's available by phone 24 hours a day and puts in 50 to 60 hours 
of work a week, I don't think we could ask for anything more," Uberuaga said. 
</P>
<P>
Dolder said he could easily fulfill those obligations and that spending 
weekends out of town might pose a problem for a fire chief in a smaller city 
such as San Luis Obispo, "but it's not an issue in a big place like Huntington 
Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Dolder "clearly stood out" among 60 candidates for the job, Uberuaga said. 
</P>
<P>
"His city manager said (Dolder) is widely considered one of the top 10 fire 
chiefs in the state," even though he is from a relatively small city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If Dolder is approved as the new chief, he will begin Jan. 28. His starting 
salary would be $89,000, Uberuaga said. After Picard retires Dec. 24, Fire 
Marshal James Vincent will serve as interim chief until the new boss takes 
over. 
</P>
<P>
The council will consider the appointment and two others at a Dec. 17 meeting. 
Uberuaga has nominated Upland City Manager Ray Silver to become the city's 
first assistant city administrator. Uberuaga's choice for the city's new 
community services director is Ronald E. Hagan, who has held that position in 
Fullerton for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
If Silver, 41, becomes the assistant city manager on Jan. 14, he will fill the 
$93,000-a-year job Uberuaga created to assist him in the day-to-day management 
of city business. The new post replaces one of the city's four deputy city 
administrator positions, which has been vacant since Jim Palin retired. 
</P>
<P>
Hagan, 45, would begin Jan. 22 and receive a yearly salary of $89,000 in 
replacing Max Bowman, who retired this year as director of the community 
services department.JOHN PENNER

One of three units at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station was out of 
commission Friday after the failure of an internal power line shut the unit 
down during the night, plant officials said. 
</P>
<P>
According to plant spokesman Dave Barron, the supply of electricity to 
non-nuclear components in Unit 2 failed at about 10 p.m. Thursday, leading to 
an automatic shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
The components are associated with equipment monitoring the turbine generator, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Inspection crews were trying to determine the cause of the problem, which will 
keep the unit out of order until Sunday or Monday, Barron said. Power to 
customers of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. and Southern California Edison 
Co. will not be affected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported and no radioactive materials were released, Barron 
said. The plant is on the ocean side of Interstate 5 in San Diego County, just 
southeast of the San Clemente border.

PROSECUTORS WANT BAIL REVOKED FOR MAN ACCUSED OF SHOOTING HIS WIFE;

CRIME: THEY AND THE FAMILY OF THE PREGNANT VICTIM WERE SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT

Prosecutors prepared Friday to ask a judge to revoke the bail of Anthony L. 
Totten, accused of shooting his estranged, pregnant wife, after the unemployed 
tile setter made $250,000 bail and was released pending trial. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Cher DeCant said that prosecutors were "shocked" to learn 
that Totten, 32, who has pleaded not guilty, had been released Tuesday. DeCant 
said she believes Totten is a danger to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was surprised, because the (municipal) judge set what he thought was 
a reasonably high bail and expected that would protect her safety," DeCant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Totten is accused of shooting his wife, Janet, 29, outside her gynecologist's 
office in Huntington Beach on Oct. 30. Almost seven months pregnant, she is 
recovering from the attack, which left her suffering from sinus problems, 
hearing loss and a broken jaw. Her mouth has been wired shut, and she can only 
speak through clenched teeth, family members said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe he's out," said Janet Totten's sister-in-law, Sheri Quick. 
"He's a dangerous person. I can't believe they didn't tell anybody he was out." 
</P>
<P>
The defendant's lawyer, John F. Hendry, said that his client has no intention 
of going near his wife, his daughter or his year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Hendry said that Totten is staying in Laguna Hills with his family, who "kind 
of put (the $250,000 bail) together," and is looking for work. "He's doing well 
and has no desire to make contact with her," Hendry said. 
</P>
<P>
Since learning on Thursday that Totten had been released, Janet Totten and the 
couple's two young children have been living in fear, family members said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really upset that he gets to go home and have Christmas dinner and run 
around and do whatever he wants," Quick said. "But Janet has to be afraid and 
hide in fear." 
</P>
<P>
Janet Totten declined to be interviewed. Two months ago, she claimed in a 
lawsuit that her husband had a history of abusive behavior toward her and often 
struck and threatened her. Anthony Totten is scheduled to appear in Superior 
Court on Jan. 3.

KARCHER STOCK IS SCORCHED BY DIP IN EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

ANAHEIM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc.'s stock dropped sharply Friday after the operator 
of Carl's Jr. restaurants reported a third-quarter earnings decline of 49% from 
the year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim-based company, citing weak consumer spending and the resulting 
sluggishness in the fast-food business, posted earnings of $2.1 million for the 
quarter ended Nov. 5, down from $4.1 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
That news evidently hurt Karcher stock, which dropped 15.8% to close in 
over-the-counter trading at $6 per share, off $1.125. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the weakening economy, Karcher officials said another factor 
contributing to the earnings decline was the franchising of 40 Arizona 
restaurants previously owned by the company. Sales from those restaurants 
boosted third-quarter earnings in 1989 but did not contribute to the latest 
quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue fell slightly, to $120.9 million for the latest quarter, from $121.6 
million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Loren Pannier, Karcher's chief financial officer, said the company expects a 
stronger fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with the disappointing third quarter, I believe the year will end up as 
the second or third best in the company's history," he said. "Out of a 49-year 
history, that's a pretty strong statement. I had expected the third quarter to 
be a weaker quarter." 
</P>
<P>
The company's operating earnings declined just 15% in the third quarter, to 
$6.8 million from $8 million a year earlier. The company attributed the decline 
to higher revenue a year ago from real estate transactions and a decline in 
investment and other income in the lastest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers on the surface are a little disappointing," said Thomas F. 
Caraisco, an analyst for Emmett A. Larkin, a San Francisco brokerage. "The 
fast-food market has been very difficult and slow. However, they (Karcher 
officials) have indicated to me they have seen some pick-up towards the end of 
the third quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Some fast-food competitors of Carl's Jr. have tried to make up for sluggish 
sales by introducing "value pricing" -- the practice of marking down prices on 
a few key items to lure customers. Fast-food purveyors are betting, for 
instance, that customers will wash down marginally profitable, inexpensive 
hamburgers with more profitable soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine-based Taco Bell Corp. has credited much of its success to the concept; 
now McDonald's and Wendy's are testing the idea. 
</P>
<P>
But Karcher, which operates 561 Carl's Jr. outlets, has resisted so far, except 
with its breakfast menu. Patty Parks, a company spokeswoman, said the fast-food 
chain has introduced a "value menu" of 99-cent items on its breakfast menu but 
does not plan to make similar changes for other meals. 
</P>
<P>
One effect of the weaker economy, analysts and company officials said, is that 
some consumers are eating less frequently at sit-down restaurants and turning 
instead to fast food. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Stack, an analyst for Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles, said 
some customers are eating fast food more frequently "but (some) people have 
resisted . . . quick-service restaurants because prices have gone up 
considerably." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KARCHER'S PERFORMANCE 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter ended Nov. 5, Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc. reported net 
income of $2.1 million, down from $4.1 million in the comparable period a year 
ago. The company attributed the loss to a drop in consumer spending that is 
adversely impacting the fast-food business.

CHARTER SAVINGS' DEPOSITS AND SOME ASSETS SOLD OFF; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: A TORRANCE BANK BUYS THE NEWPORT BEACH FACILITY, WHOSE FAILURE WILL 
REPORTEDLY COST TAXPAYERS $34.4 MILLION.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a transaction that will ultimately cost taxpayers $34.4 million, federal 
thrift regulators on Friday sold the deposits and some of the assets of failed 
Charter Savings Bank in Newport Beach to a Torrance bank. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Heritage Bank, a two-branch bank serving mainly the Japanese community, 
paid a premium of $2.6 million to acquire deposits and some assets of Charter. 
It will also take over Charter's branches in Gardena and Little Tokyo in 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The bank also sold Charter's other two branches and their deposits for an 
undisclosed sum to Far East National Bank in downtown Los Angeles. Those 
branches are Charter's headquarters in Newport Beach and its Monterey Park 
branch. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Heritage received $14.8 million in assets but will be given 90 days to 
pick the best assets and deposits, leaving the rest to the Resolution Trust 
Corp. to liquidate. The agency, which oversees the sale and liquidation of 
failed thrifts, estimates that the liquidation of Charter will end up costing 
taxpayers $34.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Charter had $251.2 million in 21,400 deposit accounts. Henry Dupree, an RTC 
spokesman, said there was a small number of accounts that exceeded the federal 
insurance limit of $100,000 that will not be transferred to the banks. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC sought bids from 624 potential buyers, but only three offers were 
submitted. Pacific Heritage's bid was the least costly to the government, 
regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of Charter's deposits leaves only one failed S&amp;L in Orange County 
unsold. That is Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine, one of the nation's 
biggest failures with an estimated taxpayer bailout bill of more than $2 
billion. Regulators are seeking buyers for it. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, 17 failed thrifts based in the county have been sold or closed. 
</P>
<P>
Charter, which once hoped to grow by acquiring failed thrifts, was declared 
insolvent by regulators and seized by them on June 15. Its problems stemmed 
from its 1988 acquisition of troubled Merit Savings Bank of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Merit, which catered to the Japanese community, was a failing thrift with about 
14% of its $220 million in assets in foreclosed real estate and bad loans when 
Charter bought it. Owned then by Mola Development Co. in Huntington Beach, 
Charter figured it had the development expertise to work out Merit's problem 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
But the assets declined and Charter now is riddled with bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, last year's federal law that restructured the thrift industry 
doomed Charter by setting up strict standards for capital. The law also 
required thrifts to sell their high-risk, high-yield corporate securities known 
as junk bonds. Charter had a small amount of those bonds that lost their value 
and contributed to its losses. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the FBI is investigating bank fraud and embezzlement charges stemming 
from Charter's collapse, federal authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Charter has had a colorful past. It was opened as Orange Coast Savings &amp; 
Loan by flamboyant Douglas Patty and other directors at the once-mighty 
Heritage Bank in Anaheim. But soon after Heritage failed in 1984, the thrift 
found itself mired in the ensuing federal litigation against Patty and others. 
They later sold their interest to Mola. 
</P>
<P>
In its purchase of Charter's deposits and assets, 10-year-old Pacific Heritage 
gains a bigger presence in the Japanese communities of Torrance-Gardena and 
Little Tokyo, where it already has branches. 
</P>
<P>
Far East National, with four branches in Southern California and one in San 
Francisco, picks up new offices in areas where it now has none. 
</P>
<P>
Since opening a branch six years ago in Little Tokyo, Pacific Heritage has 
enjoyed growing success yet remained small. At the end of last year, it had 
only $108.5 million in assets but earned $2.4 million in net income for the 
year, according to Findley's annual report on California banks. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of Pacific Heritage's assets at the end of last year were in real 
estate-related loans, and its bad loans amounted to only $22,000. The bank's 
specialty is making loans for construction of custom-built homes, custom 
duplexes and small apartment buildings. Its business banking targets 
professionals such as doctors, lawyers and dentists. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when bank stocks are stagnant at best, Pacific Heritage raised more 
than $3 million in an offering in October by selling 200,000 shares at $15.75 a 
share.

O.C. FIRMS CAN CUT COSTS OF PROVIDING MEDICAL INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Some Orange County companies that have moved their manufacturing to the South 
and Southeast in search of cheaper labor may be missing an opportunity to cut 
their medical insurance costs as well, one local consultant says. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Linn, an associate with William M. Mercer, a medical benefits consulting 
company in Orange, said his firm found that a client, Calsonic International 
Inc. in Irvine, was spending more than necessary to provide medical care for 
employees at its Shelbyville, Tenn., manufacturing plant. 
</P>
<P>
Linn said Mercer discovered that the 1,500 Calsonic employees who make air 
conditioners for automobiles in that rural Tennessee community were spending 
slightly more time in hospitals than their counterparts in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
A more startling discovery, he said, came from a study that showed that 
Shelbyville residents use hospitals only half as often as Orange County 
residents. The reason, Linn reasons, is that doctors in rural communities are 
more judicious and cost-conscious than their urban counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Calsonic recently signed a contract with a Nashville firm, HealthChoice, which 
in January will review the cost-effectiveness of the medical care provided to 
Calsonic's Tennessee workers and their dependents. 
</P>
<P>
By hiring an outside company familiar with local medical practices to monitor 
health care costs, Linn estimates that Calsonic could save between $200,000 and 
$300,000 a year.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: WYNN'S COMPLETES STOCK REPURCHASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wynn's International Inc., the Fullerton automotive parts and chemicals 
manufacturer, said it has acquired 224,500 shares of its common stock, or 
approximately 5.8% of its previously outstanding shares, under a stock 
repurchase program approved by the board of directors in June. 
</P>
<P>
That program has now been terminated. 
</P>
<P>
In the most recent transaction, Wynn's acquired 131,457 common shares from the 
Wynn Foundation and 68,543 shares from the estate of Carl E. Wynn, who died in 
February, 1988. The company said it acquired the stock at an aggregate price of 
$2.8 million, or $14.12 a share, Tuesday's closing price. In addition, the 
company said, it previously acquired 24,500 shares for $495,635 in open-market 
transactions.

YOUNG VIOLINIST REFLECTS ON HER DIZZYING DECADE; 
</P>
<P>
MUSICIAN: NADJA SALERNO-SONNENBERG, WHO PLAYS O.C. MONDAY, ROCKETED INTO THE 
LIMELIGHT. NOW SHE WANTS TO FOCUS ON MORE PERSONAL PURSUITS.

<P>
It's been a long, hard decade for violinist Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg. And at 
29, her career still booming, she now wants to concentrate on other, less 
professional areas of her life. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the last year, I've just been overwhelmed by it all," she said in a 
telephone conversation from her home in New York. "My 20s went by really fast. 
I think I've made all the right decisions, but as I turn 30, my goal is to 
schedule things so I enjoy my life a little more." 
</P>
<P>
She performs Monday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center with pianist 
Cecile Licad -- a longtime collaborator and childhood friend -- in a program of 
violin sonatas by Mozart, Beethoven and Brahms. 
</P>
<P>
The event is being sponsored by the Orange County Philharmonic Society. 
</P>
<P>
"I still give about 15 to 20 recitals a year," said Salerno-Sonnenberg. "Cecile 
and I last collaborated about two years ago, and it's great to team up with her 
again. We'll have a recording coming out again soon." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Rome and holding dual citizenship, in both Italy and America, 
Salerno-Sonnenberg speaks English like a native, with all of the colloquialisms 
that anyone growing up on the East Coast would acquire. She is also fluent in 
Italian and even Sicilian, a dialect she picked up from her grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
Her hyphenated name, she said, "is the result of combining my mother's last 
name -- which gives me some Italian flavor -- with my ex-stepfather's. I've 
never been married." 
</P>
<P>
She remembers her early music lessons in Italy with Antonio Marchetti and his 
advice that her potential would best be realized in the United States. When she 
was 8, her family moved to New Jersey, where she studied with Jascha Brodsky at 
the Curtis Institute and was one of the first enrollees in its preparatory 
division. 
</P>
<P>
She moved to New York at 17 on a scholarship to study at Juilliard. Three years 
later, she won the Naumberg Award, which launched her solo career so quickly 
that she left school. She never graduated. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't excel in a mold," she observed. "At Juilliard, I was lucky to have a 
teacher like Dorothy DeLay, who became almost like a surrogate mother to me and 
taught me the basics of playing the fiddle. I was a very stubborn student and 
insisted on doing things my way. Then, when I got too frustrated with a passage 
of music, I'd go to her and ask her why I couldn't play it. She recognized my 
need for freedom, and that helped me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Her tours of the world, performing with the finest of orchestras, conductors 
and other artists, brought a tidal wave of publicity. Young, attractive and 
talented, Salerno-Sonnenberg found herself chased by throngs of journalists 
throughout America. 
</P>
<P>
"It was all that media stuff that really made things jump," she recalled. 
"Someone would write an article on me which someone else would read and would 
want to write another article and so forth and so on. 
</P>
<P>
"Then you fly into a big city, look up and suddenly you see your picture where 
you didn't expect it. I remember doing a bit on '60 Minutes' and the next 
morning I had an offer for the lead role in a major Hollywood movie. You start 
to lose track of it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Violinist Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg and pianist Cecile Licad play sonatas by 
Mozart, Beethoven and Brahms on Monday at 8 p.m. at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $8 to $25. 
Presented by the Orange County Philharmonic Society. Information: (714)

COUNTRY-FOLK-ROCK SINGER CARPENTER: DON'T CALL HER KAREN; 
</P>
<P>
FRESH FROM AN ENGAGEMENT AT THE ROXY, SHE BRINGS HER INTIMATE, MELANCHOLY STYLE 
TO THE BANDSTAND IN ANAHEIM ON SUNDAY NIGHT.

<P>
Early in her show at the Roxy on Thursday night, Mary-Chapin Carpenter told an 
odd little story about being chased down a backstage hallway recently by a 
confused woman inquiring "Karen? Karen?" 
</P>
<P>
This D.C.-bred country-folk-rock singer, who is doing a free show at the 
Bandstand in Anaheim on Sunday night, is more likely to be confused with 
Rosanne Cash, for whom she's sometimes a ringer, than with Karen Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
Her "Shooting Straight in the Dark" LP isn't quite as nakedly confessional as 
Cash's current "Interiors," but it's not much less vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
To be thirtysomething and single-something is to recognize too many intimate 
details in her often melancholic, always strong writing. 
</P>
<P>
Like Cash, again, Carpenter is destined to be remembered more for her 
songwriting than her performing, which is naturally limited by the downbeat 
nature of much of the material -- though, toward the set's end at the Roxy, she 
put her acoustic guitar down and let the rather polite backup band carry her 
through such stomps as NRBQ's sprightly rocker "If I Don't Have You" and her 
own two-stepper "How Do." 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter rarely comes off as a doormat in her pointed songs about losing in 
love. At times, however, you might wish she could work up a little more bile. 
In one unrecorded song, she did just that: "Opening Act" was a hilarious 
diatribe directed at a country headliner, unnamed except for a two-syllable 
profanity. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not goin' bald, so I don't wear a hat," she sang in her own defense. "I 
don't wear tight jeans; I'm a little too fat." 
</P>
<P>
Nope, this isn't Karen. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary-Chapin Carpenter sings Sunday at 6 p.m. at the Bandstand, 1721 S. 
Manchester Ave., Anaheim. Admission: free, courtesy of radio station KZLA and 
the Bootbarn in Anaheim. Information: (714) 956-1410.

FLYERS' BASS PLAYER TAKES A SOLO FLIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
BLUES: THE FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE ORANGE COUNTY R&amp;B BAND HAS JOINED OTHER 
LOCAL ARTISTS TO MAKE A WHOLE LOTTA BIG NOISE.

There's a joke about an anthropologist who thinks he knows all the ways of the 
remote tribe he's been living with for two years, but one night a frantic, 
desperate drumming commences, and the chief will say only that if the drumming 
ever stops, a terrible, terrible thing will occur. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, as the night wears on to morning and the drumming pounds on, the 
anthropologist pleads with the chief, "Please, we're blood brothers, tell me, 
what is the terrible, terrible thing that happens if the drumming stops?" 
</P>
<P>
"Bass solo starts." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Mighty Flyers' bassist Bill Stuve knew better than to fill his 
recently released solo album with lengthy pronouncements from his unwieldy 
stand-up bass. Instead, his low notes mostly just provide the solid support 
that has marked Stuve's 13 years as a founding Flyer, while his singing and the 
solid ensemble swinging of his assembled blues stars make his "Big Noise" album 
live up to its title. 
</P>
<P>
This Sunday, Stuve is going live with his Big Noise, performing at Crawford's 
Nightclub in Lakewood with most of the album's artists, who compose a large 
chunk of the local blues scene. 
</P>
<P>
There'll be harpists James Harman and Johnny Dyer (Dyer doesn't appear on the 
album), sax giant Lee Allen (a former Blaster and featured soloist with Little 
Richard and Fats Domino), pianist Steve F'Dor, and fellow Flyers Alex Schultz 
on guitar and Jimi Bott on drums. Rounding out the group are Jeff Turmes 
(bassist with the Harman Band), Brett Wheeler on saxes and Eddie Reed on 
guitar. (The album's Jr. Watson, a former Mighty Flyer and Canned Heat member, 
has a conflicting gig on Sunday.) 
</P>
<P>
The Mighty Flyers have been a staple on the Orange County blues scene for more 
than a decade (they perform one of the final shows at the fading Sunset Pub 
tonight; see story on F1). More recently, they've become a major festival 
attraction in Europe. Two people not appearing on Stuve's album are Flyers lead 
singer/harmonica player Rod Piazza and his keyboardist wife, Honey Alexander, 
but that's not because of a falling out. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, Stuve said, "I just thought if I got them on it, it would be too much 
like a Flyers record, and I wanted to do some different things, like using 
horns. There are only two or three songs with harmonica on the album." 
</P>
<P>
The album boasts three Stuve compositions as well as a Stuve/Bott arrangement 
of the title track, adapted from the Bob Crosby standard "Big Noise From 
Winnetka." The other selections -- including tunes from Clarence (Gatemouth) 
Brown, Muddy Waters, Otis Spann and rockabilly obscurity Lew Williams -- are 
mostly songs Stuve has performed onstage with the Flyers but never recorded 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than creating a conflict with the Flyers, Stuve feels his solo outing 
helps his relations with the group. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens in bands, I've found, with a lot of cats is they're writing and 
doing songs on the bandstand, but it's a different priority when the recording 
comes along," Stuve said. "In this situation, it's Rod's band, and he's such a 
monster on the harp that it's kind of tough to get my stuff out there (on the 
Flyers' records). So instead of getting all negative and bummed out and 
quitting the band or anything, I've got this optimistic outlet, which I think 
has been a healthy thing for me and the band." 
</P>
<P>
Stuve said the solo project is something he'd always wanted to do. "Then when 
we were touring in Europe these companies said, 'Bill, if you ever record 
anything we'd like to hear it.' So I said what the heck and booked some studio 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The "Big Noise" CD has been released only in Europe. Stuve hopes to make a 
distribution deal with Rounder Records in the United States. In the meantime, 
he is distributing the imports himself. "I'm doing like Colonel Parker in the 
old days," he said, "taking them to the record stores and to the gigs." (The CD 
can be found locally at the Music Market in Costa Mesa and Lamar's Records in 
Long Beach.) 
</P>
<P>
Stuve, 39, started in music as a youngster, providing drum accompaniment for 
his piano-playing grandfather. "Then came the Stones and the Beatles, and I 
said, 'Forget that!' and got a guitar. Then I found I was always showing bass 
players their parts -- maybe it came easier because of my drum education. There 
were always a lot of guitar players around, so I got a gig playing electric 
bass, and from there went on to the stand-up." 
</P>
<P>
He cites such influences as Willie Dixon, early Muddy Waters bassist Big 
Crawford and Slam Stewart, and he says bass (which he calls "the big doghouse") 
never gets boring for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a lot you can do with it," he said. "People say, 'Oh, it's 
just three chords,' but there's all these colorings, interactions between the 
band members, and of course working with the audience. So I don't have a 
problem with it." 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers have a new album, called "Blues in the Dark," due in January on the 
Rounder-distributed Blacktop label. They also have a new publicist and booking 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully we'll go to another plateau," Stuve said, "but I really can't 
complain about our success. Everything I've wanted to do since I was a child 
has come true. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something just being able to play music and make a living doing it. And 
we've been able to travel in Europe extensively where, boy, are they 
appreciative of American music. Finland was our first stop ever outside the 
U.S. It was the middle of winter, freezing cold, but the audience was amazing, 
like something you'd imagine the early Stones and Beatles things were like. 
They wouldn't stop clamoring. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always a little frustrating because at home, the style of music we're 
playing really doesn't get the acceptance you'd hope for. But I think now blues 
seems to be making a little turnaround. And sometimes when you're touring 
there's going to be the night-after-night drudgery, but overall, I think if you 
can be happy 75% of the time up there on the bandstand, then that's better than 
most other guys got." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Stuve's "Big Noise" performs Sunday at 8 p.m. at Crawford's Nightclub, 
11529 Carson St. (west of the San Gabriel River Freeway), Lakewood. The Deep 
Blue Sea band opens at 6 p.m. Admission: $2. Information: (213) 924-0446.

PERFORMING ARTS CENTER WOES NO SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The woes of the Orange County Performing Arts Center ("O.C.'s Arts Center Has 
Fallen on Hard Times" by Mark I. Pinsky, Nov. 29) come as little surprise. I 
subscribed to one of the opening series, my seats downgraded when a 
contribution letter sent to me with my order acknowledgment went unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
We sat "in the rafters" in an almost empty section; the acoustics were not as 
good as what we were expecting. We are called six to eight times a year for 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
We support the arts. We think nothing of attending the Hollywood Bowl or the 
Shubert or Ahmanson. We thoroughly enjoy South Coast Repertory, both Mainstage 
and Second Stage. But did the population numbers warrant another performing 
arts center? Or was it artistic and political egos competing with Los Angeles?

The San Diego Museum of Art has appointed Ellen Smart its first curator of 
Indian paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Smart, 45, will be in charge of about 1,400 Indian paintings and manuscript 
illuminations bequeathed to the museum in 1986 by Edwin Binney III, a former 
museum trustee. 
</P>
<P>
The Binney Collection, valued at $40 million to $50 million, spans more than 
seven centuries of Indian art from Rajasthan to Agra, from a rare, 12th-Century 
manuscript on palm leaves to 20th-Century paintings. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take me a couple of years just to see what's here," said Smart, who 
begins at the museum in May. She will continue doing independent art research 
in Rhode Island until then. Her appointment was announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Smart first became acquainted with works in the Binney Collection when she saw 
them in a show in San Francisco in the late 1960s. At the time, she was 
studying for her master's degree at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been working with Indian paintings ever since," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The works -- described by museum director Steven Brezzo as "a breathtaking 
addition to the (museum) collection" -- were held in probate until just last 
month, when complex negotiations between the museum, Binney's estate and the 
Massachusetts attorney general's office finally concluded. 
</P>
<P>
An exhibition of highlights from the collection is scheduled at the museum for 
next December. 
</P>
<P>
Smart, a specialist in 16th- and 17th-Century Mughal painting, received her 
Ph.D. in the art and archeology of South Asia from the University of London. 
She has worked as a research curator and a consultant for such institutions as 
the Nelson-Atkins Gallery of Art in Kansas City, Mo., and the Walters Art 
Gallery in Baltimore. In 1988, she was named a Fulbright Scholar. 
</P>
<P>
Smart's publications range from children's books to articles in scholarly 
journals. According to Brezzo, it was important to find a curator "committed to 
public education" because Indian art has had so little exposure in San Diego.

MUSIC: TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AFTER DEFECTING FROM HUNGARY, THE UCSD VIOLINIST AND 
CHAMPION OF CONTEMPORARY COMPOSERS ALSO MANAGES TO KEEP A FLAME BURNING FOR 
TRADITION.

<P>
It was no surprise that UC San Diego music professor Janos Negyesy chose to 
perform John Cage's "Freeman Etudes" at a Bartok festival in Szombathely, 
Hungary, this summer. The trip was his first visit in 25 years to his native 
country, and his choice of music symbolized the musician he had become in the 
West after defecting in 1965 when the authorities refused him permission to 
study music in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
A proponent of avant-garde violin music, Negyesy has premiered more than 40 
works either written for him or dedicated to him over the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Among those works that give Negyesy special pride are Cage's "Freeman Etudes," 
which he premiered in 1984 in Turin, Italy, and UCSD colleague Roger Reynolds' 
"Personae" for violin and orchestra, unveiled last March. 
</P>
<P>
"Cage is always a good test for audiences," Negyesy said. "It is 80 minutes 
nonstop for solo violin, including many silences." 
</P>
<P>
Much to Negyesy's astonishment, his Hungarian audience loved the challenging 
Cage opus and showered him with 20 minutes of applause. 
</P>
<P>
"It was absolutely a big success, which I didn't expect. I played in a large 
gallery, and the people were lying on a carpet on the floor. It was like 
playing in a church. It was hard for me to know how far they had come in 25 
years. When I was a student in Budapest, composers like Schoenberg, Webern and 
Stravinsky were on the black list. I remember when some older colleagues 
smuggled in recordings of their music from Vienna. We closed the curtains and 
listened to the records at the softest level possible. It was this kind of 
terror I grew up under." 
</P>
<P>
Even after living a quarter of a century in the West, Negyesy remains the 
soft-spoken iconoclast, still eager to subvert party lines. 
</P>
<P>
In the UCSD music department (where the party line is the pursuit of 
contemporary music), Negyesy raised eyebrows when he started his series of 
traditional chamber music concerts, "Soirees for Music Lovers." 
</P>
<P>
How could it be that the violinist they had hired to play Krenek and Xenakis 
was organizing concerts of Schubert and Mozart? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any essential difference between a Telemann sonata and the Cage, 
except that the Cage is not so old," explained Negyesy, who joined the faculty 
in 1979. "I have always felt that, if you play only new music, it is just half 
of the picture. If you play only Mozart and Brahms, that's another half. I'm 
sure that, if somebody plays Cage, his or her Mozart is different, and vice 
versa. I just cannot separate them -- that is why I started the series." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Negyesy said, he had no support from the department. But he continued 
promoting his quarterly chamber music concerts, and they soon became a popular 
fixture of university life. 
</P>
<P>
The soirees also had a side bonus. Recently, Negyesy invited faculty members of 
certain departments to preview the performances. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know anybody on this campus," he said, shaking his head. "It's 
wonderful to see people meet after you've played for them Schubert's 'Trout' 
Quintet. At our last soiree, the head of the chemistry department took me aside 
and said, 'Some of our colleagues from the chemistry department met at your 
concert for the first time!' " 
</P>
<P>
For his performances, Negyesy tries to find the most appropriate visual 
setting. Last year, when he brought a program of recent violin works written by 
young American composers to Bern, Switzerland, he performed them in a gallery 
that was featuring an exhibit by noted American painter Jackson Pollack. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, at La Jolla's Salk Institute, an ensemble of Negyesy's students 
performed Telemann, Schumann and Mozart surrounded by whimsical sculptures of 
musicians made by their fellow UCSD students under the tutelage of art 
professor Peter Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Mixing temporary sculpture and chamber music is symptomatic of Negyesy's 
undogmatic and sometimes fanciful approach to his discipline, an attitude he 
attributes to Cage. 
</P>
<P>
"Cage enlarged my possible borders to receive influences. I don't judge things 
or happenings too soon. He got rid of my black-and-white thinking, as well as 
the tendency to rely on only two choices. Curiosity, I believe, is the engine 
of life. Without it, everything is hopeless." 
</P>
<P>
Among Negyesy's diverse musical projects is a performance with Belgium's Rosas 
Dance Company, an engagement that has turned him into a long-distance commuter 
to Rotterdam for rehearsals. He will perform Eugene Ysaye's three Sonatas for 
Solo Violin as accompaniment to the dancers. Ysaye's arch-Romantic musical 
idiom is light-years away from Cage or Reynolds, but Negyesy relishes the 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really great music in spite of its Lisztian virtuosity, and it's 
remarkable what Ysaye could do using just the four strings of the violin. It's 
also fun for me to work at the other end of the musical spectrum."

The Diocese of Orange, in cooperation with the Fiesta Marketplace and the 
Downtown Santa Ana Business Assn., will conduct a religious procession down 4th 
Street in Santa Ana on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The procession, which starts at 3 p.m., is in anticipation of the Feast of Our 
Lady of Guadalupe, which is celebrated on Wednesday. Beginning at Main and 4th

among the strongest expressions of the fervent religiosity of the Mexican 
people. This potent religious character is an essential part of all Latino 
cultures. Our celebration on the 9th of December will coincide with the first 
Mass, celebrated at the Basilica in Mexico City, in honor of blessed Juan 
Diego, who was among the first evangelizers of the Americas. It is my hope that 
this public celebration by the Catholic community will help engender a respect 
for the cultural roots of the Latino people as well as foster an appreciation 
for their profoundly rich religiosity."

Christmas without "The Nutcracker" would be like Easter without the bunny or 
Thanksgiving without the turkey. It just wouldn't be the same. 
</P>
<P>
And this year, more than enough troupes are continuing the tradition in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nutcracker," the enduring Christmas ballet of a little girl's toy that 
comes to life, will be presented by ballet companies from Poway to San Diego 
this season in live performances running through Dec. 23. An animated version 
also is playing at movie theaters throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's ballet productions, which use children and adult dancers, present 
the traditional tale of Clara, the child who receives a nutcracker from a 
magician at a Christmas party. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nutcracker Prince," an animated movie playing in area theaters, is a 
Canadian feature that incorporates more of E.T.A. Hoffmann's original story 
into the script and includes some elements from Peter Tchaikovsky's ballet. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of the live productions include:

PASTELS PLAY UP AN AIRY ROOM

Question: I want a very modern look for my living room. The floor is white 
ceramic tile, and the walls are white too. The ceiling has one large skylight 
and two smaller ones. There are windows on three of the walls, so the room gets 
lots of light. What do you think of black-leather upholstery and a lipstick-red 
rug? 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Sanders 
</P>
<P>
Answer: While I like black, red and white together, I feel it was a formula 
overused in the modern settings. Why not play up the light, airy quality of 
your room with lucid, pastel colors of aqua, lavender and white? Instead of 
lipstick red, place a white-on-white textured rug on the floor. All of the 
seating can be the palest shade of lavender accented by aqua Turkish corner 
pillows. Seating should be armless and sleek. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is your advice for preparing for the holidays? 
</P>
<P>
Betty Ditmar 
</P>
<P>
A: With Christmas just around the corner, it's time to start cleaning the 
silver and polishing the glasses. That harried season will be here before you 
know it, so here's a simple checklist of things to do before the goose is 
placed on that shimmering candle-lit table. 
</P>
<P>
What is the state of your dining room walls? Do they need repainting? Can you 
find a pretty new wallpaper that will make the walls and the season more jolly? 
You might consider painting your walls a rich peach color and the ceiling a 
soft cream beige. A wallpaper border of peach and green garlands entwined with 
peach ribbon would be the crowning touch. 
</P>
<P>
Do any of your carpets need to be cleaned or replaced? Now is the time to get 
the job done. A bright, clean carpet will light up your whole room, especially 
if it's a dashing color such as emerald green or fire-engine red. Other great 
color picks are forest green, delphinium blue, scarlet red and daffodil yellow. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's time to examine window treatments. To give your dining room a lift for 
the holiday, install a frilly swag and jabot treatment in the windows. A pink 
and apple-green flowered print on a royal-blue background would work 
particularly well here. Lined in apple green, the curtains will look smashing 
against walls of pink. Frame the windows with louver shutters; this classic 
window treatment is always in style. 
</P>
<P>
Let's get to the center of attention -- the dining table. Perhaps you'll need 
new white organdy place mats and napkins to give your table new life. Or 
perhaps you're counting on new glassware, such as pink stemware or aqua-blue 
water glasses, to add that festive touch.

WHAT'S COOKING IN NEW KITCHENS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAROL V. MENZIE and RANDY JOHNSON, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because putting in a new kitchen is one of the single most expensive things you 
can do to a house, it's not a thing you want to make a mistake about. 
Unfortunately, it's one of the easiest areas in which to make mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
If you're hiring a kitchen designer or using a supplier's designer, he should 
keep you out of trouble. If you're doing a kitchen yourself, you need to work 
through the process carefully to avoid pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
Trish Houck, a Columbia, Md., designer who has refashioned many older-house 
kitchens, says there are some things that people simply might not think about 
beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
The following are some of her tips for avoiding the most common problems: 
</P>
<P>
Don't buy any appliances until you know what the kitchen is going to be like -- 
where everything will go and how it will all work together. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Houck says, an extremely large appliance, like a top-of-the-line, 
side-by-side refrigerator-freezer, can put tremendous constraints on the design 
process -- and it may not be the best use of the space. Or, someone who wants a 
"sleek" look may not know that they don't have to buy a cooktop and separate 
oven: There are stoves on the market without the "backstop" that protrudes over 
the cooking surface, so they can be installed in an island. 
</P>
<P>
Appliances should be chosen as solutions to design needs, she says, not as 
impediments that the design must fit around. 
</P>
<P>
She also suggests that even if you've decided what the countertop surface will 
be, you shouldn't get it made up until after the base cabinets are in. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people want to bring in everything at once -- a lot of builders want 
to bring in everything at once," the designer says. "But, particularly in old 
Baltimore houses, there are no two plumb walls, there are no square rooms -- 
and if you buy a square countertop, you're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the wall cabinets go in first, then the base cabinets, then the 
(carefully measured and constructed) countertop. However, there's another 
consideration: Can you get the countertop into the room and set it in place 
with the upper cabinets already there? Countertops take a lot of planning. 
</P>
<P>
Be conscious of the size of the doorways that cabinets, countertops and 
appliances have to go through. "Don't go out and buy a diagonal Lazy Susan if 
you don't have plenty of room to get it though the door," Houck says. Tall 
cabinets, such as pantry units, can also cause problems if they're too tall to 
stand up in the room. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," she says, "people have been known to take out windows to get 
things in." 
</P>
<P>
There are a few tricks for getting in something you really want, the designer 
says. For instance, the toe kick, or recessed bottom of the cabinet, might be 
sliced off. If the cabinets are custom-made -- "and you can have even 
moderately priced cabinets custom-made," she says -- you can have the toe kick 
made as a separate part. Just remember that the harder it is to make or to 
install, the more expensive a piece is likely to be. 
</P>
<P>
Before you make a lot of design decisions, consider realistically what kind of 
use the surfaces are going to get. 
</P>
<P>
You have to ask yourself, Houck says, "How pristine do I want this room to look 
over time?" 
</P>
<P>
For instance, she says, a cabinet look that's currently enormously popular is 
white paint. "Great-looking kitchen," she says. "But if a kid runs into it with 
a tyke bike, it scars or chips -- even if it's a very good finish." Pet 
scratches will show, too. She suggests that light-finished wood cabinets, like 
light oak or birch, might stand up better to daily wear and tear. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you love your old cabinets, it's hard to design a new kitchen around 
them, the designer says. "It makes you do things that aren't necessarily best 
for the design of the room," she says. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean you should toss out an old butler's pantry with lovely glass 
doors. "Find a spot, feature it," she says. But to try to redesign a room 
completely using old cabinets is to risk ending up with a kitchen that's 
different, but still doesn't function well, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure the spaces you design are appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"A vast majority of work in the kitchen is done in the space between the sink 
and the stove," Houck says. But often the sink and stove get crammed together 
"because people think that what they want is a lot of counter space," without 
thinking about how the space is going to be used. "So what they'll do is create 
a big area with a lot of counter space -- but they put it in the wrong place." 
On the other hand, she says wryly, "Ten feet between is not good either." 
</P>
<P>
Whether there's a passage between the sink and stove or whether one is down the 
counter from the other, the designer says, "that's the area where it's most 
crucial that an appropriate amount of space be left."

The water lily season is nearing its end, but there is no reason to wait for 
spring. Just as there is the Burpee's seed catalogue for the home gardener, 
there are water garden catalogues for the water lily enthusiast to ponder over 
during the winter months.

GETTING THE 'ELEMENTS' RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Marilyn Pitts 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When composing a water garden, remember it is an ecological system, said 
Charles Thomas, president of Lilypons Water Gardens in Lilypons, Md. "The 
important thing is to have the right elements." Here are some: 
</P>
<P>
Water lilies not only provide beauty to the pond, but the lily pads create 
shade and reduce algae, he said. Scavengers, such as snails, are also helpful 
in reducing algae. "I especially like the black Japanese snail (Viviparus 
malleatus). It won't come out of the water, it won't overpopulate the pond and 
it won't eat the plants." One black Japanese snail per every 1 to 2 square feet 
of pond surface area should do the job, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Fish are another practical addition to the pond, according to Thomas. "They 
keep the pond from becoming a mosquito factory. Most people use goldfish 
(Carassius auratus)." The comet goldfish and the Japanese fantail are two 
popular pond additions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pond water will naturally keep clear with the addition of submerged plants such 
as waterweed (Elodea canadensis) -- a fernlike plant with tiny white flowers -- 
and Washington grass (Cabomba caroliniana). Sold as cuttings in bunches of six, 
submerged plants are planted by pressing their stems into a bucket topped with 
a thin layer of gravel. The plants are then placed at the pond bottom. Use one 
submerged plant bunch for every 1 to 2 square feet of pond surface area, 
recommended Thomas. "These are secret water cleaners. They feed through their 
foliage, drawing nutrients from the water." 
</P>
<P>
For decorative purposes, add some emergent plants such as water irises or 
cattails. Planted similar to water lilies, these plants grow at the edges of 
the pond, highlighting the water lily setting. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have your water lily pond ecosystem set up, the secret to success is 
patience, Thomas said. "Many first-time lily growers don't give their pond time 
to take care of itself. It takes four to six weeks for everything to get in 
sync. The owner needs to just sit back and relax, and everything will 
straighten out." Marilyn Pitts
